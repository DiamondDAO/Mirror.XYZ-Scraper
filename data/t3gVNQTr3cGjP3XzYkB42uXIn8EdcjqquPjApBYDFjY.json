"rters have the chance to participate.\\n\\n- You will need an Ethereum wallet to participate. If you don’t have one, I recommend [Rainbow’s](https://rainbow.me/) mobile app for those on iOS. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) is another good option and is available on iOS, Android, and web.\\n\\n- The conversion rate is 1 ETH = 1,000 $GENERALIST. That means if someone contributes at the 0.25 cap, they will receive 250 $GENERALIST tokens.\\n\\n- Once we've published the piece, it will be minted as an NFT and posted on Zora, along with Jack's additional artwork. In total, three NFTs will be created.\\n\\n- Once on Zora, all pieces will be open for bidding in ETH.\\n\\n- If a reasonable bid is placed, I have the power to accept it on behalf of token holders. However, token holders can choose *not* to redeem their $GENERALIST for ETH, holding on instead.\\n\\n- If any of our NFTs sell in the future, holders of $GENERALIST will receive a portion of the proceeds.\\n\\nEspecially for those new to NFTs or cryptocurrency, this can be rather head-spinning. To simplify the matter, I've done my best to outline a customer journey, step-by-step.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/94dd3869-142c-4748-8d88-c0aa6684ab83.jpeg?height=1640&width=2360)\\n\\nI should say at this point: *NFTs are highly speculative*. If your primary goal is to grow your wealth, I encourage getting involved with more time-tested assets. Think of this as a Kickstarter, first: you are supporting the creation of an S-1 analysis by world-class experts in their field that can be freely read by anyone in the world. If you are motivated by the opportunity to take part in something novel, experimental, at the fringes, this could be a good fit.\\n\\nBeyond this particular project, I'm incredibly excited by what NFT projects like this might foretell. I hope the future of The Generalist will involve further collaboration and co-creation.\\n\\n### Where Next\\n\\nI don't know. But I do have a few ideas. During my discussions with Denis and Patrick on the Mirror team, we outlined some far-out concepts.\\n\\nTo date, the crowdfunds on Mirror have ranged between 1 - 10 ETH. What could you do if you raised 100 ETH instead?\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eddcff61-c805-4a7e-a6f1-0a58a5e5fffb.jpeg?height=2039&width=2087)\\n\\nVersion 1 and 2 are, I think, exciting because of how they extend the economic relationship between creator and audience and blur the boundaries in the way discussed earlier.\\n\\nWhat would an angel fund look like powered by a $GENERALIST token? In addition to opening up investor access, it could also seamlessly reward contributions from holders. Those that source an investment could receive $GENERALIST for their work, in addition to weighing in on strategic decisions. Founders, for their part, would be accepting capital from a legion of tech-savvy participants invested in the company's growth.\\n\\nWhile this opens up lots of regulatory questions around community-based capital formation combined with funding traditional startups, there are exciting possibilities for experimentation in the crypto-native sphere.\\n\\nA grant program could provide similar benefits. Though holders wouldn't have the potential to return an investment in $GENERALIST, they would guide disbursements and ensure the best community projects received support. There's something rather magical about this: the community elevates and supports itself.\\n\\n***\\n\\nThe writer Robert Musil once said, \\\"To love something as an artist...means to be shaken not by its ultimate value or lack of value, but by a side of it that suddenly opens up.\\\"\\n\\nPerhaps more than any other medium, NFTs fit this description. In their unique cluster of characteristics — the cocktail of scarcity, authenticity, and scalability — the internet's artform opens up new dimensions.\\n\\nFor $GENERALIST, I hope this is just the start.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1615769943,\"title\":\"$GENERALIST: Modern Value\",\"publication\":\"generalist\"},\"digest\":\"1T0h7VGDcECJuifK4TPDfRoUQ3zaO_tPwdZV-dtnNqw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xADbd9aedA5633448e8b4953b4376c9514075abf4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hbcZGijKOvR0YnmDW791OWxH4sS7rSSuAEfqgO1AoDY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"XIswqzPRPo0ORLYWeym_RxQvAn4-tM3i_dC5L9usRkg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"MWeh0zLSPuE1H8UjT7VPMaZai8WgVT_BUs1J47wNnHN2XS3MtpAefyZpcFHGJzL9irMOOLIhsCX3LIhrqQS1wA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x27072733cd0ba5ae1f0ca5dd5b5b04bf194752fc7d6b07287dd81fc7c6705442142a6753ee11afa3605b067116152111e5ed6339682d0abdeb474e0f0a36a9401b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on generalist.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hbcZGijKOvR0YnmDW791OWxH4sS7rSSuAEfqgO1AoDY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"XIswqzPRPo0ORLYWeym_RxQvAn4-tM3i_dC5L9usRkg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"1T0h7VGDcECJuifK4TPDfRoUQ3zaO_tPwdZV-dtnNqw\"}"
