"t some time, available for consumption at no cost.\\n\\nBut this isn’t the same with newsletters. Newsletters have put tangible value on a creator’s work that has allowed them to build a business around both their individual brand and the content that they create. It is both a platform *and *a format. It’s enabled the creator to deliver thoughtful analysis with a consistent point of view. It’s allowed them to create a “micro label” business outside of the management of larger holding companies. It’s valuable.\\n\\n*Let’s compare***: **Readers assume content is free. Music *became* free. Napster wasn’t about making music free as much as it was about user experience and user control. Listeners demanded a better experience and Napster was the catalyst for that. Newsletters, and curation are similar. Out of Napster came streaming. With a new user experience and ability to give listeners control of what they wanted to listen to, they not only stopped stealing music but they started paying for it. The product valued music by the listeners on a level that was lost with the introduction of Napster and earned back again through experience.\\n\\nPrior to this newsletter boom, readers have been doing anything possible to circumvent the payment experience. Again, this isn’t about paying for content but more so about needing control, needing a better experience and thus the casualty of that desire is media companies losing revenue (ad blockers and circumventing paywalls). But what’s incredible with newsletters is, people aren’t looking for ways to steal content. In fact, content is more portable than ever (I forward this email to you) but it’s not being done because the experience and control is finally made available to that particular reader. So much so, that they’re even starting to pay for it.\\n\\nCuration is so similar to playlists — people *steal* content because they don’t want to pay for a bundle subscription in order to read a single article just like people were stealing music because they didn’t want to buy a CD to listen to a single song. New formats breed new models and people value choice. Before streaming, creating custom playlists were difficult and piracy allowed users to curate their own experience. Before newsletters, creating personalized content feeds were difficult but now you, the reader, are able to create your own bundles.\\n\\nAs you can see, not only has this format enabled any creator to enter the venue and launch a media company, but it’s also enabled a new way of thinking of putting value on the creator work which then breeds new business models tied to ownership, consumer relationship (ie. customers are fans) and beyond.\\n\\n***A new value on creator***\\n\\nOptions create value, and what we’re seeing in the creator economy is a recalibration of not just the product that’s produced, but the producers themselves. Traditionally, creators who worked within media organizations were undervalued simply because the reputation is on the company itself. All individuals within the organization contribute to building the business and reputation of the larger holding company, which means individual reputation contribution is difficult to calculate and put value on. It took the Economist 176 years to *finally *[add bylines to some of their content pages](https://www.adweek.com/digital/the-economist-adds-bylines-to-blogs/). The *holy shit! *moment of creator’s realizing that their value \\\\*could\\\\* be larger than it’s getting credit for started with platforms and the ability to accumulate and engage followers directly on platforms. But the emergence of platforms like Substack, OnlyFans, Cameo & Patreon have accelerated that and are creating a new market indicator for individuals similar to what free agency does to athletes.\\n\\nLet’s use the NFL as an example. Not every quarterback in the NFL is valued the same because they’re a quarterback in the NFL. There is an open marketplace, free-agency, that leverages a community and auction process to assess the value of a player based on many factors. Before the enablement of creator’s to operate their own businesses in the passion economy, all creator value under the umbrella of a media organization was generalized or, oftentimes, devalued. It seems obvious that all creators are different, like QBs are, yet we value them the same because there has never been a marketplace or venue for the community/readers to openly bid, purchase and set the value of the creator’s work. In this new environment, creator’s take a step further than the QB in that they are now actually in a free-market. Anyone has a shot. Anyone can demand value.\\n\\nWhat we’re seeing with the emergence of these platforms and adoption by creators is the venue for a market dictating ‘value per individual’ creator. Using Substack for example, each writer can set their own price, product & expand membership products and benefits any which way. It’s dictated by the creator and the consumer decides whether or not they think it’s valuable. If they agree, the value is set. Before Substack, if an individual writer wrote for a publication, they had no idea what their ‘value per individual’ was. They knew their traffic, or their following on platforms outside of that publication, but internally their value was diluted amongst others.\\n\\nWhat platforms in the passion economy bring is a direct value attribution by the fans to creators that’s dictated by all market factors (competition, content, platform, budget). [As I argued in my last piece](https://medium.com/@jarroddicker/the-next-media-business-talent-reputation-and-lessons-from-record-labels-e14b695c43b), these are benefits that larger media companies need to adopt as the attraction of brand reputation is now second to their ability to be excellent distributors, developers and managers of talent and talent’s product.\\n\\nThese models result in more value for creators, a financial opportunity and business tied to independence and a true value reset on the contributors that make the creative economy run.\\n\\nIn the era of the Renaissance Creator, there are options. As media companies position themselves to put a bigger emphasis on the creator and transition their value proposition to include A\\\\&R and an opportunity for individuals to build their brand under the larger halo, individuals are entertaining the value of not only going solo but building micro labels themselves. This doesn’t just change the construct of how creators transact and engage with consumers but alters the actual structure of how the business itself is established. The business of the Renaissance Creator and its creation of micro labels may adopt the models of the major labels, iterate on existing business practices or create new ones entirely.\\n\\nA great example of this is around the announcement of The Defector. The team behind Deadspin just announced Tuesday that they’re launching a new media business, The Defector. It’s a 20 person media operation built on top of Pico, Stripe and Mailchimp. It is truly one of the first structured media Co-Ops in that each journalist owns their IP and owns, literally, about ~5% of the company. This means that if one journalist decides to leave, she can, the structure remains intact. This is one of the first examples of creators moving from the passion to the ownership economy, especially if business models begin acknowledging and rewarding participation from their customers.\\n\\nThis business is accelerating. [We’re seeing independent creators rebundle the unbundled newsroom and developing their own micro-labels anchored on platforms such as Substack](https://www.axios.com/substack-newsletters-journalism-media-5e4332d3-49a7-4f2a-9d95-a282b14b8202.html). We’re seeing creators teaming up and organizing themselves to build [collaboration groups ](https://2pml.com/2020/07/13/type-house/)to naturally support one another. We’ll start to see more products and companies focused on creator comfort (how can I be better at creating?) and confidence (how can I financially do this?) explode and surpass the value of the creative tools these individuals are building on.\\n\\nAnd as business models drive product strategy, we’ll see continued momentum move away from programmatic based advertising models and umbrella subscription efforts and towards an entirely new opportunity for monetization on top of the individual.\\n\\nThe new media economy will be built on a foundation of the very things that drive its value: the creator and the creator’s product\\n\\nRock and roll.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1615915833,\"title\":\"Media 2020: Rise of the Renaissance Creator and the Next Media Model | Medium\",\"publication\":\"darkstar\"},\"digest\":\"hUAvXKuGbfRjzv6JwwIwQZ0J6IXqefjBZvj88GuwTIg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7FdCA0A469Ea8b50b92322aFc0215b67D56A5e9A\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"SV1azfZkgFKUlwwwYxOvxPAN4CAul9EHBsXBrzVs9lY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"7Gy6lpM_Ivmw8ONT3G5Q6HV6y8xpVZ3wiZeRnmQEEh0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"7kEOg-D-kFuoMpr-WcjlaaTPJZq6Eqff34_1TZomfa2K_EwPcM3BByFVd0y1GqxQiQx8IkGdBuBkTBDdMSqyiQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd63ec0b90add050d5cb90bfe732ff295e0d2188a715f1aabc5b0fb3a1d9511bb54a2ad3c09d680d01b89143f664cbaa252a97395adc2587524faa77818dbf92b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on darkstar.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"SV1azfZkgFKUlwwwYxOvxPAN4CAul9EHBsXBrzVs9lY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"7Gy6lpM_Ivmw8ONT3G5Q6HV6y8xpVZ3wiZeRnmQEEh0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"hUAvXKuGbfRjzv6JwwIwQZ0J6IXqefjBZvj88GuwTIg\"}"
