" is no clear way to make decisions or govern them.\\n\\nSure, you can make decentralized applications more efficient and user friendly by, for example, centralizing users' cryptographic signing keys (i.e., control of their coins) with a trusted entity. But then we're mostly back to square one and would be better off using a service that is centralized.\\n\\nThus, bitcoin, for example, isn't best described as \\\"Decentralized PayPal.\\\" It's more accurate to say it's an extremely inefficient electronic payments network, *but in exchange we get decentralization*.\\n\\nBottom line: centralized applications tend to beat decentralized applications on virtually every dimension.\\n\\n**EXCEPT FOR ONE DIMENSION.**\\n\\nAnd not only are decentralized applications better at this one thing, they are the only way we can achieve it.\\n\\nWhat am I referring to?\\n\\n**Censorship resistance.**\\n\\nThis is where we come to the elusive signal in the noise.\\n\\nCensorship resistance means that access to decentralized applications is open and unfettered. Transactions on these services are *unstoppable*.\\n\\nMore concretely, nothing can stop me from sending Bitcoin to anyone I please. Nothing can stop me from executing code on Ethereum. Nothing can stop me from storing files on Filecoin. As long as I have an internet connection and pay the network's transaction fee, denominated in its crypto asset, I am free to do what I want.\\n\\n(If Bitcoin is capitalism distilled, it's also a kind of freedom distilled.)\\n\\nAnd for crypto enthusiasts that don't want to take my word for it, will you listen to Adam Back and Charlie Lee?\\n\\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ee4fbcb7-432a-4282-8752-caec90dc8210.jpeg?height=212&width=691)\\n\\n**So while we can't say \\\"for everyone Bitcoin is better than Visa,\\\" it is possible that for some cohort of users Bitcoin truly is the only way to make a payment.**\\n\\nMore generally, we can ask:\\n\\nFor whom is this the right trade-off?\\n\\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/06abc035-7c45-45d0-a505-58a7d0de5a67.jpeg?height=339&width=717)\\n\\nWho needs censorship resistance so much that they are willing to trade away the speed, cost, scalability, and experience benefits of centralized services?\\n\\nTo be clear, I'm not saying you have to make this trade-off *in order to buy/speculate on crypto assets.* I am saying that in order for decentralized applications themselves to have utility to some cohort, that cohort must be optimizing for censorship resistance.\\n\\n**So, who are these people?**\\n\\nWhile there is not a lot of good data, actual *users* of decentralized applications seem to fall into two categories:\\n\\n1. People who are off the grid: that is, in countries where access to competently operated traditional services is limited (for any number of reasons) but where internet is not\\n\\n2. People who want to be off the grid: that is, people who don't want their transactions censored or known\\n\\nWith that framework in mind we can ask:\\n\\n- For whom is Bitcoin the best/only way to make a payment?\\n- For whom is Filecoin the best/only way to store a file?\\n- For whom is Ethereum the best/only way to compute code?\\n\\nThese are the questions that get at the heart of the value proposition of the technology.\\n\\nSo far, most decentralized applications have very little use relative to traditional services. Bitcoin, for example, has fewer mainstream merchants accepting it as a payment option in the U.S. today than in 2014. And for all the talk of Bitcoin's value as a payments system in developing countries or emerging markets like China, it is traditional software (i.e., apps) like AliPay and Paytm that are actually driving sweeping change in payments in these markets.\\n\\nAt the same time, use of Bitcoin on the dark web and for ransomware is evident, even if it is hard to get good data.\\n\\nBut aren't people using Bitcoin as a \\\"store of value?\\\" Sure, which is just another way of saying people are investing in Bitcoin with a long time horizon. But remember I'm not talking about investing in the crypto asset yet. I'm talking about whether there are people who find a *decentralized application for payments* (which is enabled by that asset) useful. Real estate is only a good store of value *in the long run* if people live and work in the buildings. The same is true of decentralized applications.\\n\\nWhat should we make of Ethereum evaluated through the \\\"censorship resistance\\\" lens? After all, it seems to be getting a ton of use by developers. Since Ethereum is a developer platform for decentralized applications, does that mean it is developers who have been censored or blocked somehow? In a way, yes. Developers and start-ups who wish to build financial products do not have open and unfettered access to the world's financial infrastructure. While Ethereum doesn't provide access to that infrastructure, it does provide a different infrastructure that can be used to, for example, create and execute a financial contract.\\n\\nSince Ethereum is a platform, its value is ultimately a function of the value of the applications built on top. In other words, we can ask if Ethereum is useful by simply asking if anything that has been built on Ethereum is useful. For example, do we need censorship resistant prediction markets? Censorship resistant meme playing cards? Censorship resistant versions of YouTube or Twitter? What are – or will be – the killer applications on Ethereum?\\n\\nSo where does this leave us?\\n\\nGiven how different they are from the app models we know and love, will anyone *ever really use* decentralized applications? Will they become a critical part of the economy? It's hard to predict because it depends in part on the technology's evolution but far more on society's reaction to it.\\n\\nFor example: until relatively recently, encrypted messaging was only used by hackers, spies, and paranoids. That didn't seem to be changing. Until it did. Post-Snowden and post-Trump, everyone from Silicon Valley to the Acela corridor seems to be on either Signal or Telegram. WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted. The press solicit tips through SecureDrop. Yes, the technology got a little better and easier to use. But it is mainly changes in society that are driving adoption.\\n\\nIn other words, we grew up in the rainforest, but sometimes things change and it helps to know how to adapt to other environments.\\n\\nAnd this is the basic argument that the smart money is making on crypto assets and decentralized applications: that it's simply too early to say anything. That it is a profound change. That, should one or more of these decentralized applications actually become an integral part of the world, their underlying crypto assets will be extremely valuable. So might as well start placing bets now and see how it goes. Don't get too hung up on whether we see the killer apps yet.\\n\\nThat's not a bad argument and I tend to agree.\\n\\n**I would summarize the argument as:** in the long-run, a crypto asset's value is driven by use of the decentralized application it enables. While it's early, the high valuations are justified because even if the probability of mass adoption is small, the impact would be very large, so might as well go along for the ride and see what happens.\\n\\n**But how do we explain the recent mania?**\\n\\nBitcoin is up 5x in a year, Ethereum is up 30x. The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies is ~$175B, up from $12B just a year ago. Why?\\n\\nAs in every mania in history, it is currently rational to be irrational.\\n\\nTo understand what's going on, let's look at the buyer and seller mentality right now, starting with the buyers.\\n\\nIf you invested early in Bitcoin or Ethereum, you are sitting on a windfall. It feels like you are playing with \\\"house money,\\\" [a well-known psychological effect](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/1154/thaler_and_johnson.pdf). You feel smart and willing to risk more than you otherwise would if it was \\\"your money.\\\" Might as well diversify a bit and parlay your gains into the next crypto asset, or two, or three.\\n\\nIf you *didn't* invest, the fear-of-missing-out continues to build until the \\\"screw it\\\" moment when you buy in. Maybe you read about Bitcoin, didn't understand it, and followed Warren Buffet's (typically good) advice not to invest in things you don't understand. Some of your friends made money but you still ignored it. Then you read about Ethereum, which you *really* didn't understand, also passed on buying, and later found out that your friends are planning to retire because they did. The lesson seems to be *anti-Buffet*: only invest in things you *don't understand*. This is causing people to check their judgment at the door when the latest all-time high finally convinces them to jump into the market.\\n\\nAnd that is not good.\\n\\nBecause there will be sellers to fill the demand, especially the demand coming from people who have decided they will never understand this stuff so will just place bets on things that *sound complex and impressive.*\\n\\nLet's think about these sellers. And by sellers, I don't mean people selling their holdings of existing crypto assets. I mean new issuers. Teams launching new crypto assets.\\n\\nThe basic model is to pre-sell some percentage of the crypto assets the proposed network will generate as a way to fund the development of the decentralized application before it launches. The project founders tend to hold on to some percentage of these assets. Which means that raising money for a project this way is a) non-dilutive as it is not equity and b) not debt, so you never have to pay anyone back. This is basically free money. It's never been this good for entrepreneurs, even in the 90s dot-com boom. Which makes it incredibly tempting to try and shoe-horn every project that *could perhaps* justify an \\\"initial coin offering\\\" to go for it, even if they aren't actually building a *decentralized* application. After all, an ICO lets you exit before you even launch.\\n\\nAnd there is a pervasive narrative out there that supports entrepreneurs looking to create new crypto assets. The idea is that by selling assets to users before your network launches, you create \\\"evangelists\\\" who will be early users and promoters you wouldn't otherwise have if there were no financial incentive to participate in your community.\\n\\nThe problem with this line of thinking is that it conflates early *investors* with early *users*. The overlap between people who buy your crypto asset and people who actually want to use the service you are building is likely very, very small, especially during market manias like this one. It creates a false sense of \\\"product-market fit.\\\" Yes, people are buying your crypto asset. But that's because the \\\"market\\\" are people who want to get rich and the \\\"product\\\" you are selling is a \\\"way to get rich.\\\"\\n\\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c381a715-69d6-4b9f-ae99-f7066c7b4150.jpeg?height=345&width=727)\\n\\nBut \\\"this is fine.\\\"\\n\\nEveryone's making money. For now.\\n\\nIt's currently rational to be irrational.\\n\\nAs long as that blue line keeps going up.\\n\\n> Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked.\\n\\n**At the same time, I wouldn't bet against crypto assets.**\\n\\n> He who lives by the crystal ball will eat shattered glass.\\n\\nConsider the following. The total market cap of crypto assets has been increasing by an *order of magnitude* every few years. Where will they be in 2022? It's certain that many (most?) of the crypto assets launching today won't make it. But neither did most of the ones that were launched back in the 2013/4 boom (when they were referred to as \\\"alt coins\\\"). Though an important alt coin from 2014 did stick around and drove the most recent boom to new heights by being the platform to power all the others: Ethereum.\\n\\n![image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/97c6751e-3218-4407-a71f-e00e0fe3babe.jpeg?height=190&width=721)\\n\\n**So, Jamie, what's the bottom line?**\\n\\nAllow me to summarize.\\n\\n- Cryptocurrencies (which I prefer to call crypto assets) are a new asset class that enable decentralized applications\\n\\n- Decentralized applications enable services we already have today, like payments, storage, or computing, but without a central operator of those services\\n\\n- Today, this software model is useful to people who need censorship resistance which tend to be people that are either off the grid or who want to be off the grid\\n\\n- For now, most people are better off using normal applications because they are 10x better on every other dimension\\n\\n- Society's embrace or rejection of new technology is hard to predict (think about encrypted messaging)\\n\\n- In the long-run, the value of a crypto asset will rise and fall in proportion to the use of the decentralized applications it enables\\n\\n- In the short-run, there will be extreme volatility as FOMO competes with FUD, confusion competes with understanding, and greed competes with fear (on both the buyer side and the issuer side)\\n\\n- Most people buying into crypto assets have checked their judgment at the door\\n\\n- Many sellers of new crypto assets aren't actually building decentralized applications but are instead shoe-horning an ICO into their service because of the market mania; that doesn't mean decentralized applications are bad, it just means people are capitalizing on the confusion and are probably themselves confused\\n\\n- Don't bet against crypto assets in the long-run: as we approach the 10 year anniversary of the Bitcoin paper it is clear that they aren't going anywhere and that decentralized applications may very well find an important place alongside all the other forms of organization we have come to take for granted.\\n\\nBest,\\nAdam\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1614915724,\"title\":\"Understanding Crypto, or That Time Jamie Dimon Called\",\"publication\":\"adam\"},\"digest\":\"CQRoxRiFs_SA4RYXD49x8jqesI37Dz5bzYv1Y_EGavw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8a32Af4AfFD816978C2Fdfa7C08c27681d05d4Fe\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"TkJraVnXKespMrQORzosGP1BnePVO8L9A9Yq90SIy6c\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1QDLWlZzz4QsnSoGGK3_4qBhmZ6mZFPJ0Ov3bOOYbfc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"FYlrSFtomsa4zqzDiTflhZVu3prKBKldauw_616UDYSTpryeYLdsntTC2LLhZeuBL66D9a6Il32sDLXhM0P3RA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4242b5863aef8a75c44b9fe1726dced9a32225a011c68a9592321204b311f2fb66459c46e22c87f4557be631e61ffd784f333f221ca1b4c91e88e32cce0af4aa1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on adam.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"TkJraVnXKespMrQORzosGP1BnePVO8L9A9Yq90SIy6c\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1QDLWlZzz4QsnSoGGK3_4qBhmZ6mZFPJ0Ov3bOOYbfc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Q-HIDLBN0lRy1ezLFI-Qj5JhLzHWRUgXF4cqwieQWXQ\"}"
