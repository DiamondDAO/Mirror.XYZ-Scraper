"first to liquidate yourself in the same block before any other liquidation bot even sees it. In layman's terms, MEV infrastructure allows you to specify logic that ensures the first Tx is mined ONLY IF the 2nd backrun Tx is successful, otherwise it's as if nothing happened, like a flash loan revert. Unlike a flashloan, you incur zero gas fees when it reverts. It's a cap loss on paper, but in reality you got your collateral back elsewhere. Would be interesting to see whether your local tax office is savvy enough to understand all this.\\n\\n**This is bananas...**\\n\\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg and there's a whole dark forest within the dark forest, where unscrupulous predators stalk other successful predators by decoding their transactions so they can keep stalking them even after they change contracts to evade detection, and that's before we even start talking about how MEV will look on L2, but that's an article for another time.\\n\\n![\\\"who will sandwich the sandwichers?\\\" …  J. Delong](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c76ddac8-556b-4a86-acb2-e46f17b6ae32.jpeg?height=198&width=365)\\n\\n\\n\\n### What about other chains?\\n\\n\\n**BSC**\\n\\nThis question has come up a few times because since Binance Smart Chain is a modified fork of Ethereum, shouldn't they face the same threats?\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/95e312f6-8de5-4c8e-9e98-143b8170dc42.jpeg?height=450&width=800)\\n\\nThe simple answer is no, it is unlikely any one of the established BSC validators would try to develop self serving MEV arrangements and risk the wrath of CZ. It'd only be a short term gain with long term pain (blacklisting). If they do, I guess you could call it CEV (CZ-approved Exploitable Value), which is unlikely to happen.\\n\\n**AVAX**\\n\\nI believe AVAX's consensus model is leaderless, thus MEV would not apply as there isn't a single entity that handles block production or to determine transaction ordering.\\n\\n\\n### So what does this mean for you?\\n\\n- If you're a **DeFi end user**, particularly a Uniswap trader, you might want to review your slippage tolerance settings. You just need to have a look through the various MEV discords to see that there's enough sandwich makers pointed at Uni to make a giant picnic. And their numbers are growing everyday. This would be mitigated if Uni V3 is released with protocol-specific MEV arrangements (not insider alpha, I don't know what's in Uni V3), then all you'll need to do is opt in.\\n- \\n- If you're a **solo miner** in a MEV-active mining pool, keep in mind they're technically not obligated to share their MEV revenue with you, so it's worth asking the question to get some transparency, as it's not easy for you to calculate this yourself.\\n- \\n- If you're a **mining pool** that's yet to get involved in MEV then check out the Flashbot's [miner onboarding page](https://github.com/flashbots/pm/blob/main/guides/miner-onboarding.md). Otherwise you're missing out on an emerging revenue stream.\\n- \\n- If you're an **independent developer** whose arb/liquidation bots have stopped yielding profit, then considering joining the [flashbots discord](https://discord.com/invite/3TjWjBerRb) and partnering up with other like-minded devs to build your own vertically integrated MEV strategies and challenge the cartel's hegemony.\\n\\n![Can someone build this at the next hackathon and open source it?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2bc118ae-69a3-4fe0-ba23-f0d80b164a23.jpeg?height=175&width=800)\\n\\nIt's a scary forest out there, but align yourself with one of the three aforementioned MEV groups instead of going at it alone and you'll have a slightly less horrifying time.\\n\\n\\n\\nStay safe,\\n\\nfifikobayashi\",\"timestamp\":1615796779,\"title\":\"The enemy of your enemy is NOT your friend\",\"publication\":\"fiona\"},\"digest\":\"QXdCOAggA5g_j5R_JpO-V5LqK89EbimnYIV6c2rOsT0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xef03254aBC88C81Cb822b5E4DCDf22D55645bCe6\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BavnxvobU_wBWtxOo5u35uxe0QnlxC_s6yB-o1T92EA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"fzp3xxfsiBdXDgw5-dLViHs6v6S-8OT2P5uLc2Izups\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"D52d5icV7-eWaE0BI1muvDiVyDn14YtzOwaGikHafAyw0XBNhZ0Wx_H6wSfIwm6ZoHSPBS8qjpxxXuSXtncLfQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x758252ec652a27172f20f80523caca15a8f56543be8721d76a376f133c2f5e8f31535a91fb7fb12671fe11e1c28a9d207b2bd143914a8c52f782d40f168f784e1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on fiona.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BavnxvobU_wBWtxOo5u35uxe0QnlxC_s6yB-o1T92EA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"fzp3xxfsiBdXDgw5-dLViHs6v6S-8OT2P5uLc2Izups\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"QXdCOAggA5g_j5R_JpO-V5LqK89EbimnYIV6c2rOsT0\"}"
