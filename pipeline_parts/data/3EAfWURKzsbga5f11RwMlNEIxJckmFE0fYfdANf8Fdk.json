Tokens that get burned (destroyed) are sent to that cursed place.\\n\\nWhen one wants to **destroy an NFT**, be it because of **anger, hate, sadness, incompetence, fear** or just to **manipulate** the market price of the remaining pieces of a collection, one can send it to the *Burn address* -\\n\\n`0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`\\n\\n\\n----------\\n\\nWhen you try to dig deep, archaeologically investigating the stories of the past, searching for the **hidden truth** that no one wanted you to see, you can find pieces of a larger mosaic of former happenings; all leading to real events that made the **history of the cryptoart movement**.\\n\\n\\n----------\\n\\nSome pieces of the mosaic have more value than others since they **tell the tale** of formation of the movement that is changing the future by **emancipating artists** from all over the world while at the same time preserving the cypherpunk tradition of our **cryptographic fathers and mothers**. And on the other side battling (or taking advantage) of the **dazzling monetary gains** the enormous growth of NFTs has caused.\\n\\n// *Others are sometimes deliberately hidden.*\\n\\n\\n----------\\n\\nBut what if you could bring the dead to life and let them reveal the **stories of the past**?\\n\\nWhat if you could **resurrect an NFT** and become an owner of an art piece that was destroyed?\\n\\n*How much is that piece worth?*\\n\\\\*Is it the same as its original look-alike? \\\\*\\n\\\\*The artwork is identical... \\\\*\\n\\\\*Is it worth more since it has an 'extra layer of story'? \\\\*\\n*Or is it worth less since it's an \\\"original duplicate\\\"?*\\n\\n*Is it even allowed to exist without the authors approval might some ask?*\\n\\n\\n----------\\n\\nIn the **spirit of open-source bleeding-edge blockchain innovation** things happen extremely fast - blink and you might miss a new discovery.\\n\\nOn the 8th of October [dhof](https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1446502086850621451) had an idea that he put on Twitter about a collectible that '[resurrects](https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1446504602577383426)' dead NFTs.\\n\\nTwo versions were **immediately coded** - one by [shahruz](https://twitter.com/shahruz/status/1446519581716070408) with infinite copies of a dead NFT and one with\\\\*\\\\* a unique copy\\\\*\\\\*.\\n\\n\\n----------\\n\\nImmediately intrigued by the idea, we started experimenting with the **1/1** version by [m1guelpf](https://twitter.com/m1guelpf/status/1446511619090026496) (published on [github](https://github.com/m1guelpf/necromint)) and minting began.\\n\\n// *Mint nr.1 - wow, nice! Feels like magic*\\n\\nWe were drawn in and couldn't resist the *necromancy* and minted a few more pieces.\\n\\n\\n----------\\n\\nThe exciting part was finding all kinds of individual wallets, PFP project contracts and such then **digging deep and analyzing the ERC-721 transactions** that went from those wallets to the *Burn address*.\\n\\nChecked some dead NFTs via Rarible web interface (OpenSea had some broken previews) to see how they look and if we like them. We decided for a few that we feel are important to live in the afterlife and necrominted them. Still minting...\\n\\n\\n----------\\n\\nNow we have pieces of art that even the artists or collectors themselves don't know we own. Because they **thought they were gone**/destroyed/burned.\\n\\n**// This opens up a lot of questions and reveals some mysteries.**\\n\\nThese artist/collectors knew perfectly well that they are **minting on a permissionless, decentralized network** and that their work will **live forever**. Unless they burn it. Which some of them did.\\n\\n\\n----------\\n\\nBut now we can resurrect those pieces.\\n\\nAnd they *sure* have some stories to tell!\\n\\n\\n----------\\n\\nThat is why we welcome you to visit the first gallery in mankind's history hosting only dead NFTs and see what was destined to be hidden.\\n\\nYou are invited to buy/comment/share and take part in this first of it's kind experiment.\\n\\n\\n----------\\n\\nThis whole project is an **artistic expression** of the powers of decentralized systems and a provoking experiment to open up the dialogue about, and play with, the concepts of **immutability of blockchain, permanence of art, ownership,** de/**centralization, value, social dynamics and technology**.\\n\\n\\n----------\\n\\nLet's say we can monetize these dead works - then they could be used to cover the gas costs for future necromints and distributed to artists, former owner(s), the coders themselves (m&p), incentivize other similar experiments or anything else that could be decided with a potential future DAO...\\n\\n\\n----------\\n\\nIf you have any suggestions or a desire to contribute and collaborate be sure to get in touch and we'll do it together.\\n\\nWelcome to the\\n**[afterfile](https://oncyber.io/afterfile)**\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n[https://oncyber.io/afterfile](https://oncyber.io/afterfile)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n`website`: [afterfile.eth.limo](https://afterfile.eth.limo/)\\n\\n`gallery`: [oncyber.io/afterfile](https://oncyber.io/afterfile)\\n\\n`Twitter`: [@afterfile](https://twitter.com/afterfile)\\n\\n`ETH address`: [afterfile.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/afterfile.eth)\\n\\n`Open Sea`: [opensea.io/afterfile.eth](https://opensea.io/afterfile.eth)\\n\\n`Rarible`: [rarible.com/afterfile](https://rarible.com/afterfile)\\n\\n`authors`: [elesid](https://twitter.com/elesidd), [kript0mat](https://twitter.com/kript0mat) & [Phrankie Phunning Jr.](https://twitter.com/phunk7607)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n![afterfile has the trash @ https://afterfile.eth.limo/](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdH85dsroinUUpPNiWdfHouryDk6e4AtdiCJNJkfnX2xL?filename=afterfile.png?height=1180&width=1588)\\n\\n\\n---\",\"timestamp\":1637278297,\"title\":\"afterfile.eth\"},\"digest\":\"k0W-LXbFX0i6UD3fAGdSS76QqyBa2-U1Mfpm_1Az7Hw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8B59FDD58347F3445b6d2e1223290616c9cc00e2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1XOSQ3tFUoelEMilV-glOVAIqTNBm9CpPisBIX5E6EU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mORjY0umN2DbkgnS7-tM2WYKR3Sx5M8ztvDLYOfycts\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ZzI8SXShHwS7w1u833f6hqI8rsThr8UwfkW2DSLBHHqLZ5TSzcU25Nbri_8f17NzQ8jXbLlEtgD-kyTrZxs8PA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x3497861d5991c3dcdb0f66fd031ac630802cc4454ab30b99c6a5edc1c70c17236cf31614e610214133eb9684cf7d39d7e7a07ea9f649f3a0b6e7e2becfde87051c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1XOSQ3tFUoelEMilV-glOVAIqTNBm9CpPisBIX5E6EU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mORjY0umN2DbkgnS7-tM2WYKR3Sx5M8ztvDLYOfycts\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"NIMZBu01AHIZXYkSIF9A6QrnmdyAgMGvP3Y2HVCuh3k\"}"
