"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"could have reproduced to admiration the group assembled round Annette's tea-tray in the ingle- nook below.  He alone, perhaps, of painters would have done justice to the sunlight filtering through a screen of creeper, to the lovely pallor of brass, the old cut glasses, the thin slices of lemon in pale amber tea; justice to Annette in her black lacey dress; there was something of the fair Spaniard in her beauty, though it lacked the spirituality of that rare type; to Winifred's grey-haired, corseted solidity; to Soames, of a certain grey and flat-cheeked distinction; to the vivacious Michael Mont, pointed in ear and eye; to Imogen, dark, luscious of glance, growing a little stout; to Prosper Profond, with his expression as who should say, \\\"Well, Mr. Goya, what's the use of paintin' this small party?\\\" finally, to Jack Cardigan, with his shining stare and tanned sanguinity betraying the moving principle: \\\"I'm English, and I live to be fit.\\\"\\n\\nCurious, by the way, that Imogen, who as a girl had declared solemnly one day at Timothy's that she would never marry a good man--they were so dull--should have married Jack Cardigan, in whom health had so destroyed all traces of original sin, that she might have retired to rest with ten thousand other Englishmen without knowing the difference from the one she had chosen to repose beside.  \\\"Oh!\\\" she would say of him, in her \\\"amusing\\\" way, \\\"Jack keeps himself so fearfully fit; he's never had a day's illness in his life.  He went right through the War without a finger-ache.  You really can't imagine how fit he is!\\\"  Indeed, he was so \\\"fit\\\" that he couldn't see when she was flirting, which was such a comfort in a way.  All the same she was quite fond of him, so far as one could be of a sports- machine, and of the two little Cardigans made after his pattern.  Her eyes just then were comparing him maliciously with Prosper Profond. There was no \\\"small\\\" sport or game which Monsieur Profond had not played at too, it seemed, from skittles to tarpon-fishing, and worn out every one.  Imogen would sometimes wish that they had worn out Jack, who continued to play at them and talk of them with the simple zeal of a school-girl learning hockey; at the age of Great-uncle Timothy she well knew that Jack would be playing carpet golf in her bedroom, and \\\"wiping somebody's eye.\\\"\\n\\nHe was telling them now how he had \\\"pipped the pro--a charmin' fellow, playin' a very good game,\\\" at the last hole this morning; and how he had pulled down to Caversham since lunch, and trying to incite Prosper Profond to play him a set of tennis after tea--do him good- \\\"keep him fit.\\n\\n\\\"But what's the use of keepin' fit?\\\" said Monsieur Profond.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, sir,\\\" murmured Michael Mont, \\\"what do you keep fit for?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Jack,\\\" cried Imogen, enchanted, \\\"what do you keep fit for?\\\"\\n\\nJack Cardigan stared with all his health.  The questions were like the buzz of a mosquito, and he put up his hand to wipe them away. During the War, of course, he had kept fit to kill Germans; now that it was over he either did not know, or shrank in delicacy from explanation of his moving principle.\\n\\n\\\"But he's right,\\\" said Monsieur Profond unexpectedly, \\\"there's nothin' left but keepin' fit.\\\"\\n\\nThe saying, too deep for Sunday afternoon, would have passed unanswered, but for the mercurial nature of young Mont.\\n\\n\\\"Good!\\\" he cried.  \\\"That's the great discovery of the War.  We all thought we were progressing--now we know we're only changing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For the worse,\\\" said Monsieur Profond genially.\\n\\n\\\"How you are cheerful, Prosper!\\\" murmured Annette.\\n\\n\\\"You come and play tennis!\\\" said Jack Cardigan; \\\"you've got the hump. We'll soon take that down.  D'you play, Mr. Mont?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hit the ball about, sir.\\\"\\n\\nAt this juncture Soames rose, ruffled in that deep instinct of preparation for the future which guided his existence.\\n\\n\\\"When Fleur comes--\\\" he heard Jack Cardigan say.\\n\\nAh! and why didn't she come?  He passed through drawing-room, hall, and porch out on to the drive, and stood there listening for the car. All was still and Sundayfied; the lilacs in full flower scented the air.  There were white clouds, like the feathers of ducks gilded by the sunlight.  Memory of the day when Fleur was born, and he had waited in such agony with her life and her mother's balanced in his hands, came to him sharply.  He had saved her then, to be the flower of his life.  And now! was she going to give him trouble--pain--give him trouble?  He did not like the look of things!  A blackbird broke in on his reverie with an evening song--a great big fellow up in that acacia-tree.  Soames had taken quite an interest in his birds of late years; he and Fleur would walk round and watch them; her eyes were sharp as needles, and she knew every nest.  He saw her dog, a retriever, lying on the drive in a patch of sunlight, and called to him.  \\\"Hallo, old fellow-waiting for her too!\\\"  The dog came slowly with a grudging tail, and Soames mechanically laid a pat on his head. The dog, the bird, the lilac, all were part of Fleur for him; no more, no less.  'Too fond of her!' he thought, 'too fond!'  He was like a man uninsured, with his ships at sea.  Uninsured again--as in that other time, so long ago, when he would wander dumb and jealous in the wilderness of London, longing for that woman--his frst wife-- the mother of this infernal boy.  Ah!  There was the car at last!  It drew up, it had luggage, but no Fleur.\\n\\n\\\"Miss Fleur is walking up, sir, by the towing-path.\\\"\\n\\nWalking all those miles?  Soames stared.  The man's face had the beginning of a smile on it.  What was he grinning at?  And very quickly he turned, saying, \\\"All right, Sims!\\\" and went into the house.  He mounted to the picture-gallery once more.  He had from there a view of the river bank, and stood with his eyes fixed on it, oblivious of the fact that it would be an hour at least before her figure showed there.  Walking up! And that fellow's grin!  The boy--! He turned abruptly from the window.  He couldn't spy on her.  If she wanted to keep things from him--she must; he could not spy on her. His heart felt empty, and bitterness mounted from it into his very mouth.  The staccato shouts of Jack Cardigan pursuing the ball, the laugh of young Mont rose in the stillness and came in.  He hoped they were making that chap Profond run.  And the girl in \\\"La Vendimia\\\" stood with her arm akimbo arid her dreamy eyes looking past him. 'I've done all I could for you,' he thought, 'since you were no higher than my knee.  You aren't going to--to--hurt me, are you?'\\n\\nBut the Goya copy answered not, brilliant in colour just beginning to tone down.  'There's no real life in it,' thought Soames.  'Why doesn't she come?'\\n\\nX\\n\\nTRIO\\n\\nAmong those four Forsytes of the third, and, as one might say, fourth generation, at Wansdon under the Downs, a week-end prolonged unto the ninth day had stretched the crossing threads of tenacity almost to snapping-point.  Never had Fleur been so \\\"fine,\\\" Holly so watchful, Val so stable-secretive, Jon so silent and disturbed.  What he learned of farming in that week might have been balanced on the point of a penknife and puffed off.  He, whose nature was essentially averse from intrigue, and whose adoration of Fleur disposed him to think that any need for concealing it was \\\"skittles,\\\" chafed and fretted, yet obeyed, taking what relief he could in the few moments when they were alone.  On Thursday, while they were standing in the bay window of the drawing-room, dressed for dinner, she said to him:\\n\\n\\\"Jon, I'm going home on Sunday by the 3.40 from Paddington; if you were to go home on Saturday you could come up on Sunday and take me down, and just get back here by the last train, after.  You were going home anyway, weren't you?\\\"\\n\\nJon nodded.\\n\\n\\\"Anything to be with you,\\\" he said; \\\"only why need I pretend--\\\"\\n\\nFleur slipped her little finger into his palm:\\n\\n\\\"You have no instinct, Jon; you must leave things to me.  It's serious about our people.  We've simply got to be secret at present, if we want to be together.\\\"  The door was opened, and she added loudly: \\\"You are a duffer, Jon.\\\"\\n\\nSomething turned over within Jon; he could not bear this subterfuge about a feeling so natural, so overwhelming, and so sweet.\\n\\nOn Friday night about eleven he had packed his bag, and was leaning out of his window, half miserable, and half lost in a dream of Paddington station, when he heard a tiny sound, as of a finger-nail tapping on his door.  He rushed to it and listened.  Again the sound. It was a nail.  He opened.  Oh! What a lovely thing came in!\\n\\n\\\"I wanted to show you my fancy dress,\\\" it said, and struck an attitude at the foot of his bed.\\n\\nJon drew a long breath and leaned against the door.  The apparition wore white muslin on its head, a fichu round its bare neck over a wine-coloured dress, fulled out below its slender waist.\\n\\nIt held one arm akimbo, and the other raised, right-angled, holding a fan which touched its head.\\n\\n\\\"This ought to be a basket of grapes,\\\" it whispered, \\\"but I haven't got it here.  It's my Goya dress.  And this is the attitude in the picture.  Do you like it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's a dream.\\\"\\n\\nThe apparition pirouetted.  \\\"Touch it, and see.\\\"\\n\\nJon knelt down and took the skirt reverently.\\n\\n\\\"Grape colour,\\\" came the whisper, \\\"all grapes--La Vendimia--the vintage.\\\"\\n\\nJon's fingers scarcely touched each side of the waist; he looked up, with adoring eyes.\\n\\n\\\"Oh! Jon,\\\" it whispered; bent, kissed his forehead, pirouetted again, and, gliding out, was gone.\\n\\nJon stayed on his knees, and his head fell forward against the bed. How long he stayed like that he did not know.  The little noises--of the tapping nail, the feet, the skirts rustling--as in a dream--went on about him; and before his closed eyes the figure stood and smiled and whispered, a faint perfume of narcissus lingering in the air. And his forehead where it had been kissed had a little cool place between the brows, like the imprint of a flower.  Love filled his soul, that love of boy for girl which knows so little, hopes so much, would not brush the down off for the world, and must become in time a fragrant memory--a searing passion--a humdrum mateship--or, once in many times, vintage full and sweet with sunset colour on the grapes.\\n\\nEnough has been said about Jon Forsyte here and in another place to show what long marches lay between him and his great-great- grandfather, the first Jolyon, in Dorset down by the sea.  Jon was sensitive as a girl, more sensitive than nine out of ten girls of the day; imaginative as one of his half-sister June's \\\"lame duck\\\" painters; affectionate as a son of his father and his mother naturally would be.  And yet, in his inner tissue, there was something of the old founder of his family, a secret tenacity of soul, a dread of showing his feelings, a determination not to know when he was beaten.  Sensitive, imaginative, affectionate boys get a bad time at school, but Jon had instinctively kept his nature dark, and been but normally unhappy there.  Only with his mother had he, up till then, been absolutely frank and natural; and when he went home to Robin Hill that Saturday his heart was heavy because Fleur had said that he must not be frank and natural with her from whom he had never yet kept anything, must not even tell her that they had met again, unless he found that she knew already.  So intolerable did this seem to him that he was very near to telegraphing an excuse and staying up in London.  And the first thing his mother said to him was:\\n\\n\\\"So you've had our little friend of the confectioner's there, Jon. What is she like on second thoughts?\\\"\\n\\nWith relief, and a high colour, Jon answered:\\n\\n\\\"Oh! awfully jolly, Mum.\\\"\\n\\nHer arm pressed his.\\n\\nJon had never loved her so much as in that minute which seemed to falsify Fleur's fears and to release his soul.  He turned to look at her, but something in her smiling face--something which only he perhaps would have caught--stopped the words bubbling up in him. Could fear go with a smile?  If so, there was fear in her face.  And out of Jon tumbled quite other words, about farming, Holly, and the Downs.  Talking fast, he waited for her to come back to Fleur.  But she did not.  Nor did his father mention her, though of course he, too, must know.  What deprivation, and killing of reality was in his silence about Fleur--when he was so full of her; when his mother was so full of Jon, and his father so full of his mother!  And so the trio spent the evening of that Saturday.\\n\\nAfter dinner his mother played; she seemed to play all the things he liked best, and he sat with one knee clasped, and his hair standing up where his fingers had run through it.  He gazed at his mother while she played, but he saw Fleur--Fleur in the moonlit orchard, Fleur in the sunlit gravel-pit, Fleur in that fancy dress, swaying, whispering, stooping, kissing his forehead.  Once, while he listened, he forgot himself and glanced at his father in that other easy chair. What was Dad looking like that for?  The expression on his face was so sad and puzzling.  It filled him with a sort of remorse, so that he got up and went and sat on the arm of his father's chair.  From there he could not see his face; and again he saw Fleur--in his mother's hands, slim and white on the keys, in the profile of her face and her powdery hair; and down the long room in the open window where the May night walked outside.\\n\\nWhen he went up to bed his mother came into his room.  She stood at the window, and said:\\n\\n\\\"Those cypresses your grandfather planted down there have done wonderfully.  I always think they look beautiful under a dropping moon.  I wish you had known your grandfather, Jon.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Were you married to father when he was alive?\\\" asked Jon suddenly.\\n\\n\\\"No, dear; he died in '92--very old--eighty-five, I think.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is Father like him?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A little, but more subtle, and not quite so solid.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know, from grandfather's portrait; who painted that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"One of June's 'lame ducks.'  But it's quite good.\\\"\\n\\nJon slipped his hand through his mother's arm.  \\\"Tell me about the family quarrel, Mum.\\\"\\n\\nHe felt her arm quivering.  \\\"No, dear; that's for your Father some day, if he thinks fit.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then it was serious,\\\" said Jon, with a catch in his breath.\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"  And there was a silence, during which neither knew whether the arm or the hand within it were quivering most.\\n\\n\\\"Some people,\\\" said Irene softly, \\\"think the moon on her back is evil; to me she's always lovely.  Look at those cypress shadows! Jon, Father says we may go to Italy, you and I, for two months. Would you like?\\\"\\n\\nJon took his hand from under her arm; his sensation was so sharp and so confused.  Italy with his mother!  A fortnight ago it would have been perfection; now it filled him with dismay; he felt that the sudden suggestion had to do with Fleur.  He stammered out:\\n\\n\\\"Oh! yes; only--I don't know.  Ought I--now I've just begun?  I'd like to think it over.\\\"\\n\\nHer voice answered, cool and gentle:\\n\\n\\\"Yes, dear; think it over.  But better now than when you've begun farming seriously.  Italy with you!  It would be nice!\\\"\\n\\nJon put his arm round her waist, still slim and firm as a girl's.\\n\\n\\\"Do you think you ought to leave Father?\\\" he said feebly, feeling very mean.\\n\\n\\\"Father suggested it; he thinks you ought to see Italy at least before you settle down to anything.\\\"\\n\\nThe sense of meanness died in Jon; he knew, yes--he knew--that his father and his mother were not speaking frankly, no more than he himself.  They wanted to keep him from Fleur.  His heart hardened. And, as if she felt that process going on, his mother said:\\n\\n\\\"Good-night, darling.  Have a good sleep and think it over.  But it would be lovely!\\\"\\n\\nShe pressed him to her so quickly that he did not see her face.  Jon stood feeling exactly as he used to when he was a naughty little boy; sore because he was not loving, and because he was justified in his own eyes.\\n\\nBut Irene, after she had stood a moment in her own room, passed through the dressing-room between it and her husband's.\\n\\n\\\"Well?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He will think it over, Jolyon.\\\"\\n\\nWatching her lips that wore a little drawn smile, Jolyon said quietly:\\n\\n\\\"You had better let me tell him, and have done with it.  After all, Jon has the instincts of a gentleman.  He has only to understand--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Only!  He can't understand; that's impossible.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I believe I could have at his age.\\\"\\n\\nIrene caught his hand.  \\\"You were always more of a realist than Jon; and never so innocent.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's true,\\\" said Jolyon.  \\\"It's queer, isn't it?  You and I would tell our stories to the world without a particle of shame; but our own boy stumps us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We've never cared whether the world approves or not.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Jon would not disapprove of us!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh! Jolyon, yes.  He's in love, I feel he's in love.  And he'd say: 'My mother once married without love!  How could she have!'  It'll seem to him a crime!  And so it was!\\\"\\n\\nJolyon took her hand, and said with a wry smile:\\n\\n\\\"Ah! why on earth are we born young?  Now, if only we were born old and grew younger year by year, we should understand how things happen, and drop all our cursed intolerance.  But you know if the boy is really in love, he won't forget, even if he goes to Italy.  We're a tenacious breed; and he'll know by instinct why he's being sent. Nothing will really cure him but the shock of being told.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let me try, anyway.\\\"\\n\\nJolyon stood a moment without speaking.  Between this devil and this deep sea--the pain of a dreaded disclosure and the grief of losing his wife for two months--he secretly hoped for the devil; yet if she wished for the deep sea he must put up with it.  After all, it would be training for that departure from which there would be no return. And, taking her in his arms, he kissed her eyes, and said:\\n\\n\\\"As you will, my love.\\\"\\n\\nXI\\n\\nDUET\\n\\nThat \\\"small\\\" emotion, love, grows amazingly when threatened with extinction.  Jon reached Paddington station half an hour before his time and a full week after, as it seemed to him.  He stood at the appointed bookstall, amid a crowd of Sunday travellers, in a Harris tweed suit exhaling, as it were, the emotion of his thumping heart. He read the names of the novels on the book-stall, and bought one at last, to avoid being regarded with suspicion by the book-stall clerk. It was called \\\"The Heart of the Trail!\\\" which must mean something, though it did not seem to.  He also bought \\\"The Lady's Mirror\\\" and \\\"The Landsman.\\\"  Every minute was an hour long, and full of horrid imaginings.  After nineteen had passed, he saw her with a bag and a porter wheeling her luggage.  She came swiftly; she came cool.  She greeted him as if he were a brother.\\n\\n\\\"First class,\\\" she said to the porter, \\\"corner seats; opposite.\\\"\\n\\nJon admired her frightful self-possession.\\n\\n\\\"Can't we get a carriage to ourselves,\\\" he whispered.\\n\\n\\\"No good; it's a stopping train.  After Maidenhead perhaps.  Look natural, Jon.\\\"\\n\\nJon screwed his features into a scowl.  They got in--with two other beasts!--oh! heaven!  He tipped the porter unnaturally, in his confusion.  The brute deserved nothing for putting them in there, and looking as if he knew all about it into the bargain.\\n\\nFleur hid herself behind \\\"The Lady's Mirror.\\\"  Jon imitated her behind \\\"The Landsman.\\\"  The train started.  Fleur let \\\"The Lady's Mirror\\\" fall and leaned forward.\\n\\n\\\"Well?\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"It's seemed about fifteen days.\\\"\\n\\nShe nodded, and Jon's face lighted up at once.\\n\\n\\\"Look natural,\\\" murmured Fleur, and went off into a bubble of laughter.  It hurt him.  How could he look natural with Italy hanging over him?  He had meant to break it to her gently, but now he blurted it out.\\n\\n\\\"They want me to go to Italy with Mother for two months.\\\"\\n\\nFleur drooped her eyelids; turned a little pale, and bit her lips. \\\"Oh!\\\" she said.  It was all, but it was much.\\n\\nThat \\\"Oh!\\\" was like the quick drawback of the wrist in fencing ready for riposte.  It came.\\n\\n\\\"You must go!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Go?\\\" said Jon in a strangled voice.\\n\\n\\\"Of course.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But--two months--it's ghastly.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said Fleur, \\\"six weeks.  You'll have forgotten me by then. We'll meet in the National Gallery the day after you get back.\\\"\\n\\nJon laughed.\\n\\n\\\"But suppose you've forgotten me,\\\" he muttered into the noise of the train.\\n\\nFleur shook her head.\\n\\n\\\"Some other beast--\\\" murmured Jon.\\n\\nHer foot touched his.\\n\\n\\\"No other beast,\\\" she said, lifting \\\"The Lady's Mirror.\\\"\\n\\nThe train stopped; two passengers got out, and one got in.\",\"timestamp\":1639990152,\"title\":\"\\nGoya, with his satiric and surpassing precision, his original \\\"line,\\\" and the daring of his light and shade, \"},\"digest\":\"2X7jQqemz2CCCwcSoANu-BW9yWOffwcXIOK9dLb50Kc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6b55Ba15E3e103d91f6dec37dd48B84ddF5B245C\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zHzYUxWYjj4mm5YWHIYrOZpz9lyORZ0XmSJ6uiOG2hE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"XlUX674-M1KiCRFYorkPu5vuBtthsFuKOkB5Js4lqv4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"9NnwiMkMixtCU7lKnyU7Zk5Lg-mbaHAeaBxl4OIgH_b4NeHi6pFfqKnW9sxcHo_wZVSzwQWxok06APymmJ8Nnw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x31a2d316852d98da4689a8c290d102461698698be2dff926c4c9b1dbc948cd2f27dff963e91c78916c9a63c251dd15a59d2fdcafbb483efe41d4f4ea467c845b1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zHzYUxWYjj4mm5YWHIYrOZpz9lyORZ0XmSJ6uiOG2hE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"XlUX674-M1KiCRFYorkPu5vuBtthsFuKOkB5Js4lqv4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"2X7jQqemz2CCCwcSoANu-BW9yWOffwcXIOK9dLb50Kc\"}"
