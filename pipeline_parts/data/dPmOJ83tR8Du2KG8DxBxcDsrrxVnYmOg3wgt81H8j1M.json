Last week, Bitcoin's year-to-date (YTD) capital inflow also reached $6.5 billion.\\n\\nBitcoin instruments accounted for 64.6% of the $150.9 million that flowed into digital asset investment products last week. While the scale of Bitcoin's asset management hit a record high, on November 10, Bitcoin reached a record high of around US$69,000, but then the market fell by 10%, and the final transaction price was US$62,100.\\n\\nAlthough CoinShares pointed out that digital asset investment products have seen capital inflows for 13 consecutive weeks, the industry has \\\"lower trading volume\\\" in the second half of 2021.\\n\\nAccording to the report, the average daily transaction volume in the second half of this year was 750 million U.S. dollars, a decrease of 22% from the 960 million U.S. dollars in the first half of 2021.\\n\\nAlthough among the products tracking altcoins, Ethereum had the strongest inflow of funds last week, reaching $17.3 million, but this figure marked a 44% week-on-week decline in this asset class. Despite the gradual drying up of transaction volume, CoinShares reported that the AUM of Ethereum products reached a record 21 billion U.S. dollars, while the price of ETH hit a record high of nearly 4,900 U.S. dollars on November 10.\\n\\nCardano (ADA) ranked closely behind, with an inflow of 16.4 million U.S. dollars and a weekly inflow growth of 227%. CoinShares said it was unable to identify the “obvious catalyst” driving the surge in inflows to the Cardano Fund.\\n\\nDespite the decline in trading volume in the second half of 2021, institutional traders have locked record funds in Bitcoin investment products.\\n\\nThe price of ADA also experienced a sharp rebound this week, rising from around US$2.00 on November 8 to around US$2.36 on November 10. However, the price of Cardano fell back to $2.11 on Friday. Compared with the all-time high of $3.09 in September, ADA is still down 46%.\\n\\nSolana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), and Ripple (XRP) investment products also flowed in at US$9.8 million, US$5.2 million and US$3.1 million respectively last week.\",\"timestamp\":1639396294,\"title\":\"Despite the decline in trading volume, the scale of institutional Bitcoin product asset management still hit a new high\"},\"digest\":\"6MYZN6TEY9Sf8irARwjXuimY49SvK2eth_tLxU36bwY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6955605BA732D21C0491f56F496BabD378e44B31\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cGetI62JCmMPGMoyJaGeyTQFYkkKXdmOOn31E1a9t64\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zsDa9NTBon-eilockwqkXHiU-_GbAoC1Aw5D6ZOe_4k\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"qIm364uqlHYbSajUH9kShZX6cY6RPkP2X0HNF-NhpdqnyB_P33owPyFJPYZNa-cgfn_IrBgQEfrCX-TWoaIlnA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf02ba2c0f4287d32a63c5d713162e6e54e1be4e30bd556459bcc04374a93e28b22442b80d9fe5a372e673a1bbf608ccf449a229276389936a4deb9747a388f391b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cGetI62JCmMPGMoyJaGeyTQFYkkKXdmOOn31E1a9t64\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zsDa9NTBon-eilockwqkXHiU-_GbAoC1Aw5D6ZOe_4k\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"6MYZN6TEY9Sf8irARwjXuimY49SvK2eth_tLxU36bwY\"}"
