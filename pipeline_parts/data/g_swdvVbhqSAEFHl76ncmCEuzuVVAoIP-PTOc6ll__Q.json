"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Today, I am proud to introduce you to the Angel Protocol project (https://www.angelprotocol.io/), a protocol based on Terra's ecosystem created and designed to solve the biggest challenges of empowering charities with financial freedom. The main idea is to democratize access to the best financial tools and put money in the hands of the world's leading charities in an influence-free way, to make everything much fairer.\\n\\n \\n\\nLooking back at history, we can see that the latest analysis, and most of it makes clear that there is a direct correlation between a charity's annual income and its cash reserves for operations, highlighting the difficult survival of those organizations with low annual income as they receive less operating reserves and therefore increase their degree of financial vulnerability. The idea is that all organizations function equally. Actually the functioning of large organizations through the creation of reinvestment funds is good, but it would have to be extended to 100% of the organizations. The problem is, as we have said, these high barriers to entry.\\n\\n \\n\\n### What is Angel Protocol?\\n\\nAngel Protocol (https://www.angelprotocol.io/) was born to put an end to this problem and provide a solution. Going into detail, Angel Protocol is a global social enterprise based on the Terra blockchain that leverages decentralized finance (DeFi) to create perpetual endowments for charities and non-profits. In this way, all charities whether large or small will have financial freedom.\\n\\nAs mentioned above, Angel Protocol's vision is to democratize access to the best financial tools and put money in the hands of the world's leading charities in an influence-free way, to make it all much fairer. How? Through the equitable redistribution and better value alignment of the new collective economy that puts an end to the differences between one organization and another, leaving behind the lack of long-term operating reserves and the vulnerability that comes with it.\\n\\nAt the moment, Angel Protocol seems to be capturing the attention of many, reaching 30 charities already committed before launch and aligned with the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. Any charity can set up its own donation directly on the same platform, with no onboarding costs or setup fees. All that is needed is a Terra wallet address, more on that later and what steps need to be taken.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/w0F5r4CQRTx0dpWrxtOnf.png?height=287&width=711)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638351542,\"title\":\"ANGEL PROTOCOL: GIVE ONCE.
