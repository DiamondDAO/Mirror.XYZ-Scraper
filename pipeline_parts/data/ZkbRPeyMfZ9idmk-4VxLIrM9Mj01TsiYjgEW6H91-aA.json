"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"​​We each produce [6,000](https://www.newsweek.com/humans-6000-thoughts-every-day-1517963) new thoughts every day - where do they go?  What was the last interesting thought you had?  Was it an idea for a Netflix show?  An observation about how children learn?  A prediction for the future of web3?\\n\\nRight now, I’ll bet whenever you have an interesting thought, you likely don’t write it down.  You may tell a friend or colleague, but you probably forget the thought altogether and move on with your day.\\n\\nWe are accustomed to dismissing our thoughts and have been trained to think they don’t matter.  This makes sense because with the way the world works today, they usually don’t.\\n\\nUnless you are one of the select few whose perspective breaks through the noise, your thoughts likely don’t even have the opportunity to make an impact on the world.  But what if they could do more?\\n\\nWe’re not using the power of our collective minds and I think this is a hidden problem that’s holding humanity back.  I believe the key to solving this problem is to build a [new type of network](https://mirror.xyz/bficho.eth/MZqOaHtK_N6tCeX7XrZbV6CfQD7uCV8uW3W_Gr7DnpM) that works differently than a social network.  This new network is called Chaos.\\n\\nChaos is an intelligence network designed to find and spread the best thinking in the world.  It operates as a meritocracy of ideas **where the best thinking wins distribution, regardless of the source.**\\n\\nIf you want to contribute to this new intelligence network, the first thing to do is start capturing your interesting thoughts using Chaos.  This is a powerful and transformative habit that has benefits ranging from mapping your mind to [reducing anxiety](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentID=4552&ContentTypeID=1).\\n\\nAfter you capture a thought, you have two options.  You can save it to your private graph or Stream it (anonymously) to the public graph.\\n\\nThe public graph contains all the thoughts added to our collective consciousness, grouped into Streams.  Streams are collections of anonymous thoughts based on a specific category.\\n\\nEach Stream will be designed to progress innovation and our shared knowledge by finding the people around the world that can contribute useful thinking to every topic.  As more people join the network and new categories of thought emerge, new Streams will be added.\\n\\nEverything comes together in your feed, where you’re matched up with the Streams and thoughts that are interesting, relevant, or otherwise inspiring to you.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QTlYT6vPOf8jjpFw7JRuF.png?height=1500&width=3000)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OizHK5e3H5ynBdxM5B2qU.png?height=1341&width=3655)\\n\\nOur goal is to continuously **find the thinking that inspires you to think**.  You can think of Chaos as a tool to help you maximize the number of new and interesting thoughts your mind generates and then help you activate those ideas so they can have the greatest possible impact on you and the world.\\n\\nIf we get this right, Chaos will become an idea generation machine that accelerates the pace of innovation across every category that we dedicate our minds to.\\n\\nIf this is something that you want to be a part of, you can request access to the private beta [here](https://chaosai.typeform.com/to/n2C2aAxF)!\\n\\n\\\\- Brian Ficho @[bficho](https://www.twitter.com/bficho), Founder, Chaos\",\"timestamp\":1641309916,\"title\":\"Chaos — Activate Your Ideas\"},\"digest\":\"4O6GpoOL4VROZUZXfkpmV-jp0KAu5An3u3GvoWpAyjo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8b9532bD0d02EEc6D18eED6fCC651a85Ed9825a1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MFjHnnrPzmmjHzLT1QjIdlZ6h_6N3usECdWpKp68XGM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0_2KW1aqR6DXHdJvL8z6_iZnbEjDvJ4oH6SngvqowRA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"YSuoBn-Of7AdUvQrfxABwJ3HxPVRpYxi2tom6BslSh2eEoUwYvRZQiWgvilZwY90w-NAgMFRk6aJqe49_62cXg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x944044d6836129a0ecb7023bd276464796a92dfd9010d52e9601e6214192e7553f7a4b04e14b3deff4df632f86fb84a9077dcd620fd21b81becfd8a1a9a2b0bc1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MFjHnnrPzmmjHzLT1QjIdlZ6h_6N3usECdWpKp68XGM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0_2KW1aqR6DXHdJvL8z6_iZnbEjDvJ4oH6SngvqowRA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"VGqcT009ru_48wRFmn6YrapKThDDMix_jfbgnhdiWS0\"}"
