"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Being a developer to me isn‚Äôt just about money but it‚Äôs about creating.\\n\\nSo, your first goal should not get money but be good at creating.\\n\\nNow, the world of development is very wide, and one should not admire to be proficient at programming in every language. Every painter knows how to draw well, but none can do it proficiently with all the different methods at the same time. You aim to get to the top of one programming method and then you‚Äôll be able to use most of them.\\n\\n## Creating better\\n\\nWhen it comes to learning how to create, it‚Äôs up to the person to have the required motivation to do so. At the same time, some methods will make it easier.\\n\\nDo not frustrate yourself. Starting with something too hard or out of the imaginable can lead to abandoning. I truly think that no one can understand how hard something is until they try it.\\n\\nSo to mitigate: start doing what looks good to you and stop if you see that effort is too much in respect of progress made.\\n\\nToo easy, and you won‚Äôt learn.\\n\\nI suggest doing 1 or 2 things:\\n\\n* Follow a respectable course, it will go from too easy to very complex and catch your attention. All of this while teaching you proper execution. I suggest Dev Ed courses for frontend, and net ninja for javascript backend (follow the node one after the dived js one).\\n* Copy. Go to other websites which you like and copy every feature that you like. And entire page if you want\\n* Focus on less. Try focusing on a category of sites that revolve around your end goal. Don‚Äôt try to be an expert in every available website -every niche has its peculiarities.\\n\\nDo all of this while keeping progress on a personal website. You can use AWS 1year free plan to host your first ec2 or a lightsail server. It will teach you how to use SSH, FTP and how to manage files.\\n\\nOtherwise, Heroku will work fine as well. (Use any host that you like but KEEP ALL OF YOUR LEARNING WORK SOMEWHERE ONLINE AND VISIBLE).\\n\\n## To the money\\n\\nIf you know how to create, you know what specific parts can be customized. ‚ÄúWhat colors will the site be in‚Äù ‚Äúwho is the website for?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat do I have to show on the page?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhich are your landing pages?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere do you want your buy button?‚Äù‚Ä¶\\n\\nThe more you learn, the more specific questions you can make.\\n\\nCompare: ‚Äúwhat colors do you want it to be in:\\n\\nTo: ‚ÄúWhich is the target audience‚Äù\\n\\nThe latter is more professional and means you have a style. When you still don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing, you should ask a bunch of questions and learn how people in the niche you choose think.\\n\\nQuick note: keep a sheet with everything that the person told you, this way you can look back and ask more professional questions moving forward. This said, you aim to make a good website, not to look professional. Do what it takes.\\n\\nIf they ask for a portfolio, give it. But your focus is knowing what to build, not what you have built in the past. If your portfolio is good, you‚Äôll get more of the clients who look for one, not more clients in general.\\n\\nBut good grief, make a good-looking portfolio, it‚Äôs their window on you.\\n\\n## How to find these people?\\n\\nWe went over what to do when we have found a client and before going to how to price your services we should find a way to look for clients.\\n\\nIn my career, I‚Äôve made more money by creating relationships than by offering a service. The biggest misconception around clients is that a sale is made in a single moment.\\n\\nLet‚Äôs step back for a second.\\n\\nAfter assessing our goal as developers, we have to start looking for any contact who would be interested in a service of ours/who can make us grow.\\n\\nThis is going to be a list of the methods which got me a job, with stars regarding the quality of the relationship that got created (hence how much monetary potential they have yielded me over the past years)\\n\\n* Messaging Youtubers which I enjoy watching in the 1k-50k sub-area +++++\\n\\nVery high-quality method. You can use the email, write a comment or find them on discord. After that, simply engage by liking their content and maybe being active for a little with them. If on discord discuss with the community for a while, creating a ‚Äúparticipation bias‚Äù ‚Äî then get to know them and scout to see if they have a project that you can help them with. This can apply to other contact methods as well. It‚Äôs simply a template to create a working relationship.\\n\\n* Being on discord/fb/telegram groups for developers. ++++\\n\\nIf someone is looking for a website, they will probably resort to a resource like this, and you should be there to greet them and ask them to tell you more about the project.\\n\\n* Looking for badly made websites ++++\\n\\nThis can be done anywhere. If you smell that the company/website owner has money then you can look for a way to connect with them. To find the websites, simply ‚Äúlive‚Äù and write down every single thing that looks bad TO YOU. Then offer with a contact found on the website to change that thing you didn‚Äôt like (whether it was a button color or a whole page).\\n\\n* Helping random people ++\\n\\nGo on entrepreneur discords and help anyone asking for it.\\n\\nCon: if they ask on a disc they may not have money. So you‚Äôd be wasting a lot of time\\n\\nPro: It‚Äôs a lot of volumes and gets you in a ton of relationships. Also helps to learn what sells and what doesn‚Äôt\\n\\nThere are many more ways of finding clients, but the one essential thing is:\\n\\nYou‚Äôre not a product ‚Äî He is not a discount buyer.\\n\\nCreate a relationship with someone, be there to help them, and you won‚Äôt run out of jobs.\\n\\n## Money üí∞\\n\\nMoney is value created, not time spent (or at least this is the trend right now for freelancers).\\n\\nExample: \\\\[SEO expert\\\\]\\n\\nImagine a company is making 1m dollars per year. Their site is now loading in 2.4s and you can make it load in 1.7s. Statistics say that this will cause an increase in sales of 7% (random number).\\n\\nFor them this means an increase in revenue of 70k.\\n\\nSo whatever amount under 70k they pay will give them a profit. The job may take 5 hours, even if they pay you 10k they will be making money.\\n\\nNow, this sounds wonderful, but you have to deliver increases, and a million-dollar company won‚Äôt have an SEO issue. If you are the best at doing a niche thing, then it‚Äôs hard for someone to do it better than you (or at least this is the mentality business owners have).\\n\\nIn short:\\n\\n* You have to deliver value and get paid on that, not time.\\n* To do so, estimate how much value you‚Äôll be giving back by asking for % increases and realistic estimates. (Use your questions. And remember, you are looking to create a longer term relationship, not making money in one day).Of course, this sounds phenomenal but it‚Äôs highly unlikely to get there in the first talks ‚Äî so I used this trick: Think about a number for the work you‚Äôre doing it, and double it. You‚Äôll get better at estimating later but this gives you more room to ‚Äúplay‚Äù when giving reasons for lower prices (ex: ‚ÄúBut this is the first time we work together, so I‚Äôll make it 20% less‚Äù)\\n* Discard jobs. If they are not respectful or not for you, skip them.\\n* Don‚Äôt focus on closing in one day. At one point you‚Äôll work with the client. If their budget doesn‚Äôt allow it at the moment, simply step away and wait (of course, while keeping a good relationship). Most of my clients took a few days and reached out to other people before coming back. The difference: the other ones wanted money, and the clients feel it.\\n* ALWAYS work for money. NEVER FOR FREE. Contracts are a good weapon of yours. I used the free plan of HelloBonsai to get my first ones and then used LaTex to edit them.\\n\\nAt last, a personal tip: you‚Äôre not friends with any of your clients. Keep distance and privacy for yourself\\n\\nBy Mattia,\\n\\nCo-Founder at\\n\\n[innectedpodcast.com](http://innectedpodcast.com/)\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*EUI4HJ59JxzBrLI_TwGpbA.png)\\n\\nThumbnail, made by me :D\",\"timestamp\":1634768752,\"title\":\"My view on finding a job as a web developer - and how to do it \"},\"digest\":\"ZN9xMz1Qbxjtd49aKHppUpVNyxE410keFegZ6HNH0CU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xc4B697E24091B2eBcC9C30f0BfdaD38BC347a744\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-YBoEytV-y5pfTGiLkk0QbApWolO_YzJdIiZOtdgQK8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_ylLU2q5y6MqwCrmb0F27BH-37b73sEDqL_JYLU0lrE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"vCpTT4TEIjsTchtjTkJCmu0V0szeFfIamYS5C7VuEVSk2PyplABM-FuYzBdRqmdur8S5VigzfrlzQxTcqBcRlA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0f70ded9b247d9bcc1bdc188d63c450ba1a68af169c85f1fcf3bd99e36ae5e01517b10a5383ebb3af5c51b170ccd0606cd078c5295b595d605d568c75cd75fa71c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-YBoEytV-y5pfTGiLkk0QbApWolO_YzJdIiZOtdgQK8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_ylLU2q5y6MqwCrmb0F27BH-37b73sEDqL_JYLU0lrE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ZN9xMz1Qbxjtd49aKHppUpVNyxE410keFegZ6HNH0CU\"}"
