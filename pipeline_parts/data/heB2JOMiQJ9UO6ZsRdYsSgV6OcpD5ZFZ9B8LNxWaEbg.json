"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"> *I want to be the first person in my town to turn my music video into an NFT.*\\n\\nHarlem native 27Delly has been gaining momentum as an emerging talent in NYC Hip-Hop. Stepping out of his brother [A$AP Ferg’s](https://ps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASAP_Ferg) shadow, Delly is focused on bringing Harlem back to the limelight this decade. He is **deleting the music video off of YouTube** for his most streamed song on Spotify - “Flashy” - to mint as an NFT on Glass on this **Saturday,** **August 28**. From his origins to his Glass debut, the story of his rise is inspiring to say the least.\\n\\n![AYE!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/10f11512-cc8b-445d-87b8-9e67e6a81be1.jpeg?height=960&width=768)\\n\\n## The Come Up\\n\\nDelly was raised in Uptown, New York between the Bronx & Harlem. His father was the late “D-Ferg,” a pioneer of Harlem culture. His mother, Cheri Lezama, was raised to the sounds of the steel pan, ringing from Trinidad to New York. Delly lost his beloved father at the age of 5, followed by his cousin and grandfather.\\n\\nThrough those losses, Delly persevered. He began to work for a brighter tomorrow and never failed to fill each room he entered with an irreplaceable energy. An energy that reminds you that you are here, you are alive, and you have **power**.\\n\\nVisually inclined and astute to his surroundings, Delly has always been involved in the creative arts. As early as 6 years old, he was enrolled in the Harlem School of Arts and found himself immersed in music and art. He learned several different instruments, including the violin, viola, and many percussion instruments.\\n\\n> *I had a very bounce-around childhood. I was enrolled in a school for the arts as a child, and that’s where I was formally introduced to all these different instruments. Before that, I learned how to play **djembe** from my extensive time spent with my grandmother at her African dance class. It was there that I learned to play bongo, djembe and lots of other types of African instruments.*\\n\\n![Energy rising.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9507eb77-51cf-4014-b138-a2c9c49c154e.jpeg?height=1410&width=940)\\n\\n## Dream Chasing\\n\\nDelly dropped out and chased his passion for music. From the gritty streets of Uptown to the trendy scene of SoHo, Delly began to leave his mark on the city working for the [VFILES Foundation](https://www.vfiles.org/), a non-profit providing the next generation of cultural innovators with the resources they need to reimagine and redefine the world.\\n\\n> *Aside from music, I just want to use my platform to benefit those around me. It should be cool to know where your City Council is located, or how to be involved in local politics. It just isn’t advertised to the youth in that manner. If we strive towards these things as opposed to fame, the retention rate of the music will only grow.*\\n\\nHe eventually released his first EP at 19 - “Twenty7” - which has accumulated over 5+ million streams and counting. And Delly’s just getting started.\\n\\n![A man of the people.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/500b4211-b947-4282-9995-f4e82286071f.jpeg?height=574&width=768)\\n\\n## Fly $ince Birth\\n\\n> *Being fly is a mentality and state of mind. It's tangible, but not purchasable. It starts from within and I'm showing you an unlimited currency we all got within.*\\n\\nDelly’s highly anticipated debut tape “Fly Since Birth” will be his second project and a staple to his music legacy.\\n\\nWith 10 effervescent tracks that will shake the room, the music on the tape ranges from the some of the dirtiest “[Frankie P](https://twitter.com/frankiep325?lang=eu)” 808’s you can find to the jiggiest Uptown bounce. The tape already features two smash singles - “Bonita” and “Flashy.”\\n\\n> *Fly Since Birth is to fill in those who are on this journey with me now as to where I’m at in life. How I’m feeling, the confidence, the spiritual journey that I’m on. I have a few official songs out but I’ve been making music for years, so I’m learning a lot of people don’t know a lot about me, so I think it’s time to show people how I think.*\\n\\n![Up and stuck.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/da8ebeec-c5b0-4fda-8faf-3b41f3cb7ec8.jpeg?height=1500&width=1000)\\n\\nFor listeners looking for an artist who is showing great promise early on in his career, 27Delly is definitely someone to keep your eye on for the rest of the year.\\n\\n## VISIONS OF GLASS\\n\\nDelly wanted to accompany his upcoming album “Fly Since Birth” with a one-of-a-kind visual experience - to extend his image from the block to the blockchain. Now it’s here.\\n\\n> *The music I make is transparent, and I think transparency and how real you’re keepin’ it is important because no then no one can question you, you just stay ten toes down.*\\n\\n![Transparency.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3bad2710-1a2c-4140-ae79-ccc5ed6a9b57.jpeg?height=1600&width=1255)\\n\\nLike Delly’s music, the mission of Glass is rooted in the idea of **transparency** - a video platform transparent to who and how everyone benefits in a new economy for digital media.\\n\\nEach of the coming drops acts as an audiovisual time capsule, minting the spirit of Harlem forever on the blockchain.\\n\\nDelly is bringing parties to the blockchain…\\n\\nCall that a ***BLOCKPARTY.***\\n\\n## The First Drop: FLYGUYS\\n\\nDelly will drop his first series of **27** NFTs on Glass on his birthday - **August 27, 2021** at **6:27 PM EST**. The NFT is a 3D audiovisual experience - taking Delly’s artistic vision to the clouds.\\n\\n![Ready for takeoff.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a6ad6397-ec00-4ee5-9da1-fae950f0c1d2.png?height=2198&width=3120)\\n\\nStay tuned for the release of his **1/1 “Flashy” Music Video NFT on August 28**, followed by the release of another series of **NFT editions “Exclusivity” on August 29**.\",\"timestamp\":1630035364,\"title\":\"27Delly: HARLEM PRINCE\",\"publication\":\"glass\"},\"digest\":\"dDV9D-8qE88f9wSZdUHtqbgaVyuzQuZSGe2BBRPquFA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xDb6c1a8aF1883262aaD221A25816468ef693D4A2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8aFz1Mt_pZb6XnolDDex1EQDKe45gvcOCyl_T4atKBc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Yzs2dilWoRXTm0lbGZe_-YTE940f2d0VTVVdUkhakBU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"aZIhdI8zqv8CyzGCrNFZp_lWZ_KOTcx9vlr_UMqCLVcHDsQHY32zaoZlocZap4yUj60p71DYJLCj-AAfYHc67w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x24dffc7f2115d8c4cddc26b165f717cc84bd89096ae3d91032e3223fef1b37cd1c69f3d2f21283785af43c3eee9258520061e498fd0aa6d8efb31126a1e9d87e1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on glass.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8aFz1Mt_pZb6XnolDDex1EQDKe45gvcOCyl_T4atKBc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Yzs2dilWoRXTm0lbGZe_-YTE940f2d0VTVVdUkhakBU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"pWO8VOCLR0J_dkPiwygdDd4Im9UPY4p_T3JlpGNJR1w\"}"
