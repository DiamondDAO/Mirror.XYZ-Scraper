If not, follow this [guide](https://blog.wetrust.io/how-to-install-and-use-metamask-7210720ca047?gi=cc916bf25609) to set up Metamask.\\n\\n***Note**: To borrow funds on Compound, you're required to supply funds first. Make sure you check out our Compound lending tutorial [here](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/lamLNPpV2nAKrPjBkvGQcpEFtBhwrzSBxZ_APgRq9FE).*\\n\\nAlright, let‚Äôs dive in!\\n## Compound 101\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0470879b-e4da-46fc-a3e3-0cab7d9d865a.png?height=246&width=512)\\n\\n\\nCompound is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. \\n\\nThey are the third largest DeFi asset, at the time of writing, with around $9 billion in total value locked (TVL) and are considered the catalysts for DeFi Summer 2020. \\n\\nThink of Compound like a high-yield savings account, where you can lend and borrow Ethereum-based assets without any middleman.\\n## How to Borrow and Pay Back a Loan\\nBefore I show you how to borrow an asset, it's important to understand *why* you would want to borrow in the first place:\\n\\n- You want long exposure to a particular asset\\n- You want short exposure to a particular asset\\n\\nEssentially, you borrow assets if you want to go long or short leverage on some asset, such as ETH. Learn more about why you would want to borrow an asset in this article.\\n### Step 1: Borrow the desired asset.\\nClick the asset you want to borrow.\\n\\nA pop-up will appear with the Borrow APY for the chosen asset and Distribution APY (amount of COMP/year). Type the amount you want to borrow, and pay close attention to the `Borrow Limit Used` bar.\\n\\n***Important Note**: If the meter below reaches ‚â• 100%, your account will be liquidated. This can happen when collateral declines in value, or borrowed assets increase in value. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so crucial to monitor your balance limit to avoid liquidation.*\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d0443522-6b62-4ec5-a7ae-37e36937824e.png?height=512&width=288)\\n\\nAfter clicking `Borrow`, you are officially borrowing on Compound. \\n\\nYou will see your `Net APY` drop to account for the borrowed asset. The borrowed asset will continue to accrue interest until you repay the loan.\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e12439c5-0f5a-4ff6-9c45-d4ecc876be1c.png?height=449&width=1155)\\n\\n### Step 2: Repay your loan (when you‚Äôre ready).\\nOnce you‚Äôre ready to repay the loan, click the asset and toggle to `Repay`. \\n\\nType the amount you want to repay in the top bar. Make sure you have enough of the asset to cover the interest accrued.\\n\\nOnce you click `Repay`, you have officially repaid your loan!\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/369fa111-7eec-4fc3-bb42-f2cfbf5d71cf.png?height=637&width=357)\\n\\n### That‚Äôs all you need for now! \\n\\nNow that you can borrow on Compound, you‚Äôre well on your way to becoming a DeFi expert.\\n\\nFor a more technical overview, read the Compound protocol [documentation](https://compound.finance/docs).
