"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"As the lead developer of Polkadot, Wood oversaw a busy 2020 for the project, which began with its initial launch in May. The Polkadot developer also worked on the DOT token redenomination event in August, helping the project and the community to fight against unscrupulous exchanges that listed the “new DOT” tokens before the redenomination was concluded. \\n\\nDetailing the achievements for the year, Wood revealed that Polkadot has gone on to dominate the crypto staking scene, with over 63% of the blockchain’s token supply held in wallets.\\n\\n**Wood’s 2021:**\\n\\nIn 2021, Wood’s developmental activities will most likely revolve around Substrate 3.0 to bring full Ethereum compatibility to the Polkadot network. Cross-chain interoperability protocols will also be a major part of Wood’s schedule for the coming year. \\n\\nAdditional advancements in the Acala and Moonbeam toolkits could also make DeFi become a reality on Polkadot in 2021. Indeed, given the scale of protocol developments slated for 2021, Polkadot could establish itself as the second major DeFi ecosystem after Ethereum. Thus, it is possible for DOT to continue its positive price-action run as activity builds on the Polkadot chain.\",\"timestamp\":1639030715,\"title\":\"As the lead developer of Polkadot, Wood oversaw \"},\"digest\":\"IY9IhVObsYgaXaKGsMi79CLL3vltA-0uDkamopnJDwE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x58d28442E01c8CD1DFEb3089234234A147ED063e\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"e4CPZ_kOiYx5R3Lf4uW6XKFbzbr88rXu4_KZX4svgHg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3xCEQxbffvyvAO6bx3hUOhkbyIudfJR-YcF84O5DhYs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"-V-9K2jFG6T8t0mr6fZYeleLpO3t8RTNETTUzIYkThH6AldHdyNr9xHjdommu9SxBaNcbE0SfJ8GStn3n7ON5g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe0ccb9b6bbcb1855c1d78d1bb1cb0613b55e0f07b1b07d7ac032cb89389a435074e1456faf776a91b49ac675bd659e6d1c3e2089a6570cc7fa99a0ab300704741c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"e4CPZ_kOiYx5R3Lf4uW6XKFbzbr88rXu4_KZX4svgHg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3xCEQxbffvyvAO6bx3hUOhkbyIudfJR-YcF84O5DhYs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"IY9IhVObsYgaXaKGsMi79CLL3vltA-0uDkamopnJDwE\"}"
