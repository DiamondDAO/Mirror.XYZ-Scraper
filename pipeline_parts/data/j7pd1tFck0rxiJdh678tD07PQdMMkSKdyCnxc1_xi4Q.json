"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"It has been long debated if there is a cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin that can be seen as ‘money’. A while ago it has been proclaimed that Ether is money. Henceforth it has even been evaluated as a ‘tripple point asset’ as it is being used as a store of value (i.e. as collateral), a commodity asset (i.e. for paying gas fees) and a capital asset (i.e. generating profits by staking). I believe, that also Matic is money as it fulfills the same properties. This can become particularly obvious in the short term, as transaction fees are significantly lower than on the Ethereum main chain, where L2’s are just starting the race and ‘sharding’ can only bee seen at the horizon. Let’s see what the future holds for Matic.\",\"timestamp\":1638137315,\"title\":\"Matic is Money\"},\"digest\":\"MeSM1eLGlja1HOCt5THvC_Ic733W1PcU8fX6XfZqYj8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4Cf100cce352029e726185980E4611de835D6C7B\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"y62RV13ZE4hnyf27rfNJnPmX0E1VZW4qUlsuIxuDtFY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"p4eGj_drGqdw6jpiPZLPyY1J6Y2N0oHL7lMovC_QPbQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Cvx1rdCzsvIHsAlzYt38FmY6C5aWn-7B9OgawzkXskG659Lokw1BiPrV1YmZsSwVFE3IBFbZq9O-FWnrtJv4DA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x026d94cb431f1453fc75eb3247cc6fc93f73f70724e602d3a4fc1d73ac33a07c12b4c60fb45e4491dd36d490f18e304d8873481d16597565b727e04821377b6b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"y62RV13ZE4hnyf27rfNJnPmX0E1VZW4qUlsuIxuDtFY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"p4eGj_drGqdw6jpiPZLPyY1J6Y2N0oHL7lMovC_QPbQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"MeSM1eLGlja1HOCt5THvC_Ic733W1PcU8fX6XfZqYj8\"}"
