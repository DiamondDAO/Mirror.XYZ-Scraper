"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"At dinner no word was dropped that gave a hint of their errand. The conversation was on general topics; but Joan could not help noticing the troubled, absent expression that occasionally came into Sheldon's eyes.  After coffee, she left them; and at midnight, from across the compound, she could hear the low murmur of their voices and see glowing the fiery ends of their cigars.  Up early herself, she found they had already departed on another tramp over the plantation.\\n\\n\\\"What you think?\\\" she asked Viaburi.\\n\\n\\\"Sheldon marster he go along finish short time little bit,\\\" was the answer.\\n\\n\\\"What you think?\\\" she asked Ornfiri.\\n\\n\\\"Sheldon marster big fella walk about along Sydney.  Yes, me t'ink so.  He finish along Berande.\\\"\\n\\nAll day the examination of the plantation and the discussion went on; and all day the skipper of the Malakula sent urgent messages ashore for the two men to hasten.  It was not until sunset that they went down to the boat, and even then a final talk of nearly an hour took place on the beach.  Sheldon was combating something-- that she could plainly see; and that his two visitors were not giving in she could also plainly see.\\n\\n\\\"What name?\\\" she asked lightly, when Sheldon sat down to dinner.\\n\\nHe looked at her and smiled, but it was a very wan and wistful smile.\\n\\n\\\"My word,\\\" she went on.  \\\"One big fella talk.  Sun he go down-- talk-talk; sun he come up--talk-talk; all the time talk-talk.  What name that fella talk-talk?\\n\\n\\\"Oh, nothing much.\\\"  He shrugged his shoulders.  \\\"They were trying to buy Berande, that was all.\\\"\\n\\nShe looked at him challengingly.\\n\\n\\\"It must have been more than that.  It was you who wanted to sell.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Indeed, no, Miss Lackland; I assure you that I am far from desiring to sell.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't let us fence about it,\\\" she urged.  \\\"Let it be straight talk between us.  You're in trouble.  I'm not a fool.  Tell me. Besides, I may be able to help, to--to suggest something.\\\"\\n\\nIn the pause that followed, he seemed to debate, not so much whether he would tell her, as how to begin to tell her.\\n\\n\\\"I'm American, you see,\\\" she persisted, \\\"and our American heritage is a large parcel of business sense.  I don't like it myself, but I know I've got it--at least more than you have.  Let us talk it over and find a way out.  How much do you owe?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A thousand pounds, and a few trifles over--small bills, you know. Then, too, thirty of the boys finish their time next week, and their balances will average ten pounds each.  But what is the need of bothering your head with it?  Really, you know--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What is Berande worth?--right now?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Whatever Morgan and Raff are willing to pay for it.\\\"  A glance at her hurt expression decided him.  \\\"Hughie and I have sunk eight thousand pounds in it, and our time.  It is a good property, and worth more than that.  But it has three years to run before its returns begin to come in.  That is why Hughie and I engaged in trading and recruiting.  The Jessie and our stations came very near to paying the running expenses of Berande.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And Morgan and Raff offered you what?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A thousand pounds clear, after paying all bills.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The thieves!\\\" she cried.\\n\\n\\\"No, they're good business men, that is all.  As they told me, a thing is worth no more than one is willing to pay or to receive.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And how much do you need to carry on Berande for three years?\\\" Joan hurried on.\\n\\n\\\"Two hundred boys at six pounds a year means thirty-six hundred pounds--that's the main item.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My, how cheap labour does mount up!  Thirty-six hundred pounds, eighteen thousand dollars, just for a lot of cannibals!  Yet the place is good security.  You could go down to Sydney and raise the money.\\\"\\n\\nHe shook his head.\\n\\n\\\"You can't get them to look at plantations down there.  They've been taken in too often.  But I do hate to give the place up--more for Hughie's sake, I swear, than my own.  He was bound up in it. You see, he was a persistent chap, and hated to acknowledge defeat. It--it makes me uncomfortable to think of it myself.  We were running slowly behind, but with the Jessie we hoped to muddle through in some fashion.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You were muddlers, the pair of you, without doubt.  But you needn't sell to Morgan and Raff.  I shall go down to Sydney on the next steamer, and I'll come back in a second-hand schooner.  I should be able to buy one for five or six thousand dollars--\\\"\\n\\nHe held up his hand in protest, but she waved it aside.\",\"timestamp\":1638930578,\"title\":\"But Joan decided that they were men of importance in the Solomons\"},\"digest\":\"_b_yZ-72H-FP2OUbo9zrOZaKi5sKw7PIZGjInn-r_yA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x336f98da5BDeF1692C4dE51f67eafA44062a418E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GunwQaYc5Z4kvVZdpy7PZ6GsgxWRqEjkXCxEtsre2QM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"HSQS7KlxP2Wbl3LanTYPFZxwHwlAbuiwRGo5xlhNVUQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"zkCAUDv6P52tHylsn86ZblQiecU6lNCCl7anGP9VwmWd1m2j1znQ2Lwl-TyRBTY2yzOtKEqz2OTPxbR2cng2-A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x210a8d9e4c70f4543ef61d281e8e8bb34870d524b6d0b24a7519d2c96e995a286e1fa34e2f37d5a731b320522f62bdd54049639cc3dbe1e3599ccd8e16ee23ce1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GunwQaYc5Z4kvVZdpy7PZ6GsgxWRqEjkXCxEtsre2QM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"HSQS7KlxP2Wbl3LanTYPFZxwHwlAbuiwRGo5xlhNVUQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"_b_yZ-72H-FP2OUbo9zrOZaKi5sKw7PIZGjInn-r_yA\"}"
