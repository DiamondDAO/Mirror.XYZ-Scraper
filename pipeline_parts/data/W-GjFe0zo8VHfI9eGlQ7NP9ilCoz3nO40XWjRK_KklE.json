Today is my first day working full-time in **Web3** and I truly couldnâ€™t be more excited. In this article Iâ€™ll share a bit about how a DC Hooper I ended up living in Miami and working in Crypto. \\n\\nWorking on my storytelling. \\n\\nThe first time I ever heard about Blockchain was in 2017 during my Senior year at the University of Maryland when a guest speaker from IBM spoke to my Information Architecture class.

Against my own will, my brain started to crave learning more and more.Â \\n\\nOutside of my Web2 job, I worked on @bitcoinhubapp and was one of the first members of @miamitechruns DAO which has grown to over 200 people!
