"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"What’s good mirror\\n\\nBack after a small hiatus, I’m sure my zero readers missed me dearly. \\n\\nCurrently in the middle of my senior exams so I’m quite busy and haven’t had any time to route energy towards creative outlets or career progression. I’ve added some new tracks to my monthly playlist which I’m enjoying a lot. \\n\\nFeel free to listen here..: \\n\\n[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/27kNHPOwPDt7pYMHmFksY2?si=4b29925fe54f4d36](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/27kNHPOwPDt7pYMHmFksY2?si=4b29925fe54f4d36)\\n\\nRevisited A$AP Rocky’s debut album and found some tracks I missed upon my first couple listens in high school. If I was able to blip a blip it would be blip. Blip.map. Shoutout my guy that created vine and working on @blitmap. Seems like a smart guy. i follow him and think he’s doing some cool things but tbh have no idea what any of it is. seems like a GUI god. o swell. C\\n\\nCurrently super hammered and sitting w my friends who are about to go out. It’s our last day of classes and this normally is the best night to go out of the year, yet I have no desire to do so. My friends are so fucking pumped to go to this bar and and bool w friends but experiencing something like that literally makes me feel nothing. Maybe it’s because I need to get on the verge of blacking out to curb the anxiety that normally prevents me from going out but for some reason I doubt that. My guy brett playing fifa with chase the northern trust fund kid who just got dumped from his long distance GF. dude seems to be taking it pretty well on the outside, but relative to his normal self i can tell he’s pretty broke inside. Dude how about mirror right. This shit is pretty cool and provides liquidity to fundraisers, writers, and other ballers. If i was to invest in any web3 project, It’d likely be Mirror or Royal. seems like two professions that have been extremely overlooked in recent years and performance is in no way correlated to the firm that employs them or the label that licenses their music. \\n\\nApplying web3 and decentralized ownership fundamentals to music publication and licensing will be extremely important in coming years, I’m positive of it. The ownership economy is truly the next creator economy. It not only allows consumers and viewers to invest in what they enjoy and believe in, it allows them to align their values with those artists. They can contribute, earn rewards and contributions from the artist, additionally aligning incentives with other consumers and artists. I truly don’t know what I’m talking about when it comes to technical concepts in crypto and web3 but I’m sure I can understand emerging concepts in the sphere and specific industries that are leveraging the technology to their benefit. I think there’s a significant imbalance between the fans of music and creators, similarly to the users of social media and the developers that created it. Sure, the music or platform wouldn’t exist without the inspiration and skill to create from the artists and developers, however no fandom or monetization possibility would exist without the fans. This represents a fundamental imbalance between the two parties, something that needs to and will be changed with web3 projects. If web3 is electric cars, web2 and traditional consumption of media is going to represent the past themes of oil and natural gas consumption. This is going to prove to be a tectonic shift in the way that individuals consume and interpret media. If I was an artist in the 21st century, I would be shifting almost all of my focus towards fractional ownership and distribution of ownership to my fandom. It seems like a no-brainer but an extreme majority of artists are in such a distant position to where they should be.
