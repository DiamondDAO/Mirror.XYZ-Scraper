I go to aquariums twice a month before Covid, and I’m a member of some non-profit animal rights organizations.\\n\\nJapan has many aquariums, most of them are good, but some of them are abusing animals. They just do not care about the value of lives and think animals are just livestocks, circus members, and tools to make money.\\n\\nI met a bottle nose dolphin, “Honey”, in 2018, before the Inubosaki Marine Park closed.  She was captured in [Taiji’s brutal drive hunts](https://www.dolphinproject.com/campaigns/save-japan-dolphins/) in 2005 for “life” in captivity. She was alone, sad, and even didn’t want move and eat, just laid in the dirty small pool, which was full of green water that you can even seen the anything in it. Someone told me she was not so bad before, because there was another dolphin, another prisoner, with her, as her friend. But after that dolphin dead, she lost all spirit to keep alive.\\n\\nThen she died, in 2020, 2 Years after the Marine Park closed. The park just don’t care about her, just want to sell her for a good price. But no aquarium need a dolphin that can not play a show to entertainment visitors.\\n\\nSo she died. In two years, without good feeding, without any other animals, without hope. We want to save her, we contact other aquariums, and one of them agree to receive her, but Inubosaki Marine Park just didn’t reply to us because it would not make any profit.\\n\\nMaybe she has dead in 2005. There is only a body in the pool.\\n\\nI know it’s not much about plastic pollution, but we need more help.\\n\\nWe are all for the ocean, and we share the same ocean, right?\\n\\nI’m so need to get a whitelist to keep our organizations running.\\n\\nYou can contact me to get more information about us.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/cryptonerdcn](https://twitter.com/cryptonerdcn)\\n\\nOur article& videos:\\n\\nhttps://animals-peace.net/honey/\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZVEZslkCCY&t=47s&ab_channel=AnimalLiberatorNPO%E6%B3%95%E4%BA%BA%E5%8B%95%E7%89%A9%E8%A7%A3%E6%94%BE%E5%9B%A3%E4%BD%93%E3%83%AA%E3%83%96 \\n \\n\\nEnglish news:\\n\\nhttps://wildwelfare.org/concern-over-solitary-dolphin-in-japan-aquarium/\\n\\nhttps://www.dolphinproject.com/blog/lonely-dolphin-honey-dies-in-japan/ \\n \\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1638830225,\"title\":\"A story of Honey.\"},\"digest\":\"124INocRJxElU6uak4dZxtMVtMb6YRIWN8PHVaKC-4U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4DAF1f3e75D724ee09871A8464DC67e294997c53\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Hk7S_AN2bba03U6lZ3ONCoi82E-V0DsJKP3zAtvSgrQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YMzIDKf8cJn6bnB_VU3-HuhsYyc6bwAQL89IpGM8nnI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"iaYEnHXicECT1s_VtccXEHtRgvdlf09Ga0z8wvonjHfkDFYJOPrHlBmOZlN72htCkTXIB7X1qeAcsRCoi6ftDw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf23b4191112c8d45fba381efb1a8f709de1f606e36819c431a5612c8dea31dd95cb519b224a7550d4bd1246e63d7ccdb5da8e07da4e7897139700ee96fca16721c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Hk7S_AN2bba03U6lZ3ONCoi82E-V0DsJKP3zAtvSgrQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YMzIDKf8cJn6bnB_VU3-HuhsYyc6bwAQL89IpGM8nnI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"124INocRJxElU6uak4dZxtMVtMb6YRIWN8PHVaKC-4U\"}"
