It is a new style synthesized from a fusion of folk art and imaginative world art. At its base are Mother Nature and her many fascinating representations in Indian folk art. She anchors this series, probably representing my deep concern about her erosion in our race for urbanization and a sense of urgency to get reconnected with her.\\n\\nSpirit of the collection reconnects with Mother Nature and tries to fix issues of it by spreading awareness through art and work towards disappearing folk art and artisans.

In my paintings, these coalesce to take a visual form—sometimes they connect and make a continuum of meaning. Sometimes, they become a means for my self-expression.\\n\\nIn the painting series “Natura,” I’ve worked with a new style synthesized from a fusion of folk art and imaginative world art. At its base are Mother Nature and her many fascinating representations in Indian folk art. She anchors this series, probably representing my deep concern about her erosion in our race for urbanization and a sense of urgency to get reconnected with her.\\n\\nThey lend both solidities with their details and otherworldliness to my work. Through this layered lens, I have viewed characters, culture, emotions, and instances. They are sometimes poignant, sometimes funny, and sometimes even trippy.\\n\\nI chose mediums like Acrylic on canvas, Watercolours on paper to complement the richness I wanted to bring alive. Ethnic colors add fullness. Original gold foil is the finishing touch.\\n\\n### Solo Exhibition\\n\\n* Jehangir Art Gallery, Dec 2013- Jan 2014\\n* India Art Festival 2015, Mumbai\\n* Art Gallery RDD  Neroy Gallery, Mumbai\\n* India Art Festival 2016, Mumbai\\n* The Art Enclave at Index Fair 2017, Mumbai\\n* National Gallery of Modern Art 2017, Bangalore\\n* India Art Festival 2018, Mumbai\\n* Artisan Art Gallery, Mumbai\\n* Online at 'storyltd.com' of Saffron art Art Gallery\\n\\n### Paintings in collection of\\n\\n* Mr. Amitabh Bachchan,Bollywood superstar\\n* Aamir Khan, Bollywood superstar\\n* Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, Bollywood Director\\n* Nandita Das, Bollywood Actress\\n* Soumen Roy, Star Middle East FZ LLC\\n\\n### Awards\\n\\n* **Gold medal** (Honorable Mention award) in the 80th International Photographic Salon of Japan 2019- 2020\\n* ***Outstanding Individual Achievement*** *for Character Animation Award’ from 4th Global Youth Marketing Forum 2012*\\n* **4th Apsara Film & Television Producers Guild Awards** for title animation of Film ’Taare Zameen Par”2009\\n* **Best Title Sequence** – Film ’TaareZameen Par” Prize of effort DIGICON Japan 2009\\n* **Best Title Sequence** - Film or TV ”TaareZameen Par” Golden Cursor Awards for Excellence in Animation 2008 by CNBC TV18\\n* **Best social welfare short** film”Happy Planet” FICCI Frames Award 2008\\n* **Best short film** “Happy Planet” Third Prize DIGICON 6+3 Japan 2007\\n* **Gold Award** for Children short film” Cute Bunny” Kalamazoo Animation Film Festival (KAFI), 2003\\n* **Gold medal** in the 55th International Photographic Salon of Japan 1995-96\\n\\n*More details will be released soon!* [Join the Natura channel on Seva.Love’s discord to learn more.](https://discord.gg/ErSCzUxydd)\",\"timestamp\":1641616848,\"title\":\"Natura, an NFT for Good collection by Dhimant Vyas\"},\"digest\":\"LiAxkPvlBvPFTVZHhk_NbzrLjxdVPeVuAYQ4zaU_7bA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x14F3a84c49f166901791A0570bd9E82f0Fd3bFd7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jsWxrdrR8hawxUvBZny0XYASUUI-MJXBnppE6l33meU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"w1Spn2DyQ50OuYzMuG8474pcKCoNCNO7ZpiAABAw8eY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"pu07MY5luOyS7Zh-1_7GZhhwpiHOzig-MOqG7qKoXsPbRoeifSWA-sUvhg-0-jG7KFH2ZSDXEvXTM9pK54WN7A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0add2665172115402d1b728b884c68a20c91ae308b213fee8087f21aea5b128109508b48d327f309a920b624d43904686d14c055b1fbbf61a1c114faf82c6e071b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jsWxrdrR8hawxUvBZny0XYASUUI-MJXBnppE6l33meU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"w1Spn2DyQ50OuYzMuG8474pcKCoNCNO7ZpiAABAw8eY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ShJRDICvi03eJUOUQUfqV_-7vXxM6BXqZA_o7sL8JAI\"}"
