Almost half of these children, about 800M, did not have the technology tools they needed to continue their education.\\n\\nWhile many children have returned back to the classroom, many of the 800M children who did not have access to distance learning still do not today… 2 years later.\\n\\nJara is focused on the children most impacted by the educational crisis who are often in communities with less access to electricity and the internet. These communities include post-disaster zones, low-income communities, refugee camps and more.\\n\\nThe education crisis is not new, but it is exacerbated - Before the COVID-19 pandemic, there were approximately 262 million out of school children worldwide, 565 million who live in conflict or disaster affected countries, for whom access to education was compromised.\\n\\nEvery child on this planet deserves continuous access to the quality education they need to thrive.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IO3xKuubVfSKlzJ2iXI3S.png?height=1536&width=2048)\\n\\n### Providing Quality Education Anytime, Anywhere\\n\\nJara has invented the Jara Unit to address this problem, a solar and crank-powered personal education device that provides children offline access to curriculum-aligned educational content. The Jara Unit can mimic a workbook, personal tutor, a textbook, a quizzing tool, and more. It is a teaching tool for teachers, and a learning solution for students.\\n\\nFunds from the NFT collection will support Jara’s product and program development to support children everywhere,  starting with 10-13 year old children in Nepal, whose communities are still feeling the effects of the 2015 earthquake, where about 60% of children currently do not have access to distance learning, especially in low-internet and low-electricity communities.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QKlzfDk0quDfxKkXVL7mn.png?height=974&width=1861)\\n\\n[Learn more about Jara here](http://www.joinjara.com/) and listen to the founder Soraya Fouladi discuss the need and vision for Jara below.\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcMN6xnOxhI&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcMN6xnOxhI&feature=youtu.be)\\n\\n## About the Artist\\n\\n> **Dhimant Vyas**\\n\\n![Dhimant Vyas - Artist and Animation Film Designer](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Zq4RG2I93sn3dF-92adM7.png?height=787&width=563)\\n\\n### About my Paintings\\n\\n> ### Reimagining the nature of folk art\\n\\nMy world is filled with the rich colors, flavors, and details of stories I hear, literature I read, music I listen to, sounds that fill my days, and life experiences that I come in contact with. In my paintings, these coalesce to take a visual form—sometimes they connect and make a continuum of meaning. Sometimes, they become a means for my self-expression.\\n\\nIn the painting series “Natura,” I’ve worked with a new style synthesized from a fusion of folk art and imaginative world art. At its base are Mother Nature and her many fascinating representations in Indian folk art. She anchors this series, probably representing my deep concern about her erosion in our race for urbanization and a sense of urgency to get reconnected with her.\\n\\nThey lend both solidities with their details and otherworldliness to my work. Through this layered lens, I have viewed characters, culture, emotions, and instances. They are sometimes poignant, sometimes funny, and sometimes even trippy.\\n\\nI chose mediums like Acrylic on canvas, Watercolours on paper to complement the richness I wanted to bring alive. Ethnic colors add fullness. Original gold foil is the finishing touch.\\n\\n### Solo Exhibition\\n\\n* Jehangir Art Gallery, Dec 2013- Jan 2014\\n* India Art Festival 2015, Mumbai\\n* Art Gallery RDD  Neroy Gallery, Mumbai\\n* India Art Festival 2016, Mumbai\\n* The Art Enclave at Index Fair 2017, Mumbai\\n* National Gallery of Modern Art 2017, Bangalore\\n* India Art Festival 2018, Mumbai\\n* Artisan Art Gallery, Mumbai\\n* Online at 'storyltd.com' of Saffron art Art Gallery\\n\\n### Paintings in collection of\\n\\n* Mr. Amitabh Bachchan,Bollywood superstar\\n* Aamir Khan, Bollywood superstar\\n* Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, Bollywood Director\\n* Nandita Das, Bollywood Actress\\n* Soumen Roy, Star Middle East FZ LLC\\n\\n### Hear from Dhimant’s collectors\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FAuFYAIl3zPlqhu-5AZbp.png?height=853&width=1280)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yT1yExcqDcXaCBq98TzPM.png?height=853&width=1280)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mzibYba3vCJ7OLtUoEi8b.png?height=857&width=850)\\n\\n### Awards\\n\\n* **Gold medal** (Honorable Mention award) in the 80th International Photographic Salon of Japan 2019- 2020\\n* ***Outstanding Individual Achievement*** *for Character Animation Award’ from 4th Global Youth Marketing Forum 2012*\\n* **4th Apsara Film & Television Producers Guild Awards** for title animation of Film ’Taare Zameen Par”2009\\n* **Best Title Sequence** – Film ’TaareZameen Par” Prize of effort DIGICON Japan 2009\\n* **Best Title Sequence** - Film or TV ”TaareZameen Par” Golden Cursor Awards for Excellence in Animation 2008 by CNBC TV18\\n* **Best social welfare short** film”Happy Planet” FICCI Frames Award 2008\\n* **Best short film** “Happy Planet” Third Prize DIGICON 6+3 Japan 2007\\n* **Gold Award** for Children short film” Cute Bunny” Kalamazoo Animation Film Festival (KAFI), 2003\\n* **Gold medal** in the 55th International Photographic Salon of Japan 1995-96\\n\\n*More details will be released soon!* [Join the Natura channel on Seva.Love’s discord to learn more.](https://discord.gg/ErSCzUxydd)\",\"timestamp\":1642691222,\"title\":\"Natura: an NFT collection by Dhimant Vyas to benefit child education in collaboration with Jara & SevaLove\"},\"digest\":\"BepZTVcL_4acJlWh0WrvXB755E_zQTbgkrmqiefMl9s\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x14F3a84c49f166901791A0570bd9E82f0Fd3bFd7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"UxUvNueUKzGo1ZNYSLL_gnCS-zWMvr8iS4G-oE1KZq8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"q2fphQK9JEzYZl1WP1aFBAgK3RBqlSUyECOHmXGYoqw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"gwRbfoH6Oj-DIbTStVJUA1BGe6Xg8Ja8q5YAZE-W7Cd6217jq0XuMQ2pLITwIroMgeqBa_2GoATv2oKOhaOePA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c740212a64cd9037d9c61184c97f024d5723794f419ca031dd77838299e2b2372fb948dc83eb211e6edb50d037996c8d2805e2a2ea3f1b29426209c786999c01c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"UxUvNueUKzGo1ZNYSLL_gnCS-zWMvr8iS4G-oE1KZq8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"q2fphQK9JEzYZl1WP1aFBAgK3RBqlSUyECOHmXGYoqw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ShJRDICvi03eJUOUQUfqV_-7vXxM6BXqZA_o7sL8JAI\"}"
