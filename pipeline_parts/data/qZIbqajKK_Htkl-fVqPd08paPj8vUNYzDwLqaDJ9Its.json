The ones I had used for the bouldering earlier that day, in Ihlara. Bouldering, rock climbing…I had a rope!\\n\\nA thin nylon rope, 5 metres long, that my mum got me from the drugstore months earlier. I used it to hang my wet clothes whenever I stayed in places where there were no options other than to do a hand wash in the bathroom’s sink.\\n\\nWith a crucial gentleness in my movements, I took the tablet and small bits out of the ripped tote bag and slid them into the rucksack. After, I tied the groceries bag to the sack and fastened the straps around it.\\n\\nLastly, I tied one end of the rope to the rucksack’s top handle and the other end to my waist bag. The most critical knots I ever tied in my life.\\n\\nWith gloves over my hands, I rolled my body to face the ravine’s shoulder on my right and kneeled. I felt the tuff-made surface. It was soft enough, as expected. I clenched my fists.\\n\\nThe first punch was thrown in fear. It didn’t do much.\\n\\nThe second one managed to dig a small cavity. I dug it a bit deeper with my fingers. The tuff broke into gravel much easier than I imagined. Digging a hole large and deep enough took no longer than a minute.\\n\\nAnother couple of punches, lunged at short distance, reaching up. Another hole.\\n\\n*Just a bit higher up. A hole just enough to fit the tip of the shoe, that’s all.*\\n\\nI created a ladder. A mere four holes, going up half the rock wall.\\n\\nWith my left foot tucked in the lowest cavity, I lunged my right foot up the ravine to give me enough balance for the climb. The shoulder wasn’t more than a couple of metres high, but it would require serious grip.\\n\\nI grabbed the top holes with my hands, and slowly moved my right foot to the middle one, which would be my primary lifting mechanism.\\n\\nIt was now or never. Letting go meant tumbling down the ravine, possibly off the cliff.\\n\\n*Hold on, don’t let go. DO NOT LET GO.*\\n\\nI could feel the inside of the cavities with the tips of my shoes, they were steady. Thrusting myself up, I reached for the ledge with my left hand. I felt my right foot sliding. There wasn’t enough depth to hold my full body weight on one hole, so I had to act swiftly.\\n\\nI grabbed the ledge. My right hand followed immediately. I pulled myself up, my head just above the rock. I held on and frantically felt the wall with my feet, trying to find the top holes to propel the rest of my body up.\\n\\n*I’m up. I’m up.*\\n\\nMy body was lying on the side of the ravine’s shoulder. My muscles were taut. My whole body ached. The whole affair took less than five minutes, but it felt as if I had just climbed for hours. Every part of me wanted to lay there and just calm down, but the clock was against me.\\n\\nI got on my knees and turned around. There was a small boulder just a few steps ahead, big enough to stand on. The pull on my waist was felt as soon as I got up.\\n\\n*The bags.*\\n\\nThe rope tied to my waist bag was on full stretch. The little leeway it had provided for me to get up on the side of the ravine was over, and I couldn’t risk pulling my stuff up while standing on tuff or gravel, as the movements could make me slide down.\\n\\nCrouching and lightly sliding the rope along the edge of the rock wall, I managed to get one foot on top of the boulder and stand up. That would have to do.\\n\\nNylon is a terrible material for a rope, and I was about to find that out the hard way.\\n\\nWith the rope still tied to my waist bag, I firmly held the end which weighed me down and pulled as much as I could. The rope came up to my chest. I alleviated the grip on my right hand, to reach for another chunk. I couldn’t hold it.\\n\\nThe rope started sliding back down through my left hand. On a last desperate attempt, I grasped harder with my fingers. It hurt.\\n\\nNot enough. The rope slithered through my hands. I felt the rucksack hitting the side of the rock wall. I could feel the heat on my palms, from the friction.\\n\\nNylon, a terrible material. The only things standing between my hands and a nasty rope burn were my old cycling gloves, covered in the same dust as the rest of my body.\\n\\nLetting the bags behind was not an option.\\n\\nI grabbed the rope again and pulled, this time all the way up to my face. There was only one thing left to do.\\n\\nI bit the nearest end of the rope, holding it firmly between my teeth. As I eased the grip on my right hand, I felt the weight pulling my neck down. The pain of holding a big part of 15 odd kilos in between my teeth shot all the way down my spine. I wasn’t going to be able to keep the position for long.\\n\\nI reached further down and grabbed another chunk of the rope, pulling it towards my mouth.\\n\\nPull. Bite. Hold. Reach. Grab. Repeat. As fast as possible, before the pain was too unbearable.\\n\\nI could see the top handle of the rucksack, the last bit of rope tied on it. Pull.\\n\\nIt didn’t move. It was stuck. If I let go of the bit of string between my teeth, it would all tumble down to the bottom of the ravine, worst-case scenario making me lose my balance and slide off the edge of the cliff.\\n\\nI had to loosen it a bit, wiggle it around whatever was trapping the bags.I loosened the grip on my left hand and swayed side to side with my body. This meant the full weight was now being held by my teeth and my neck muscles.\\n\\n*It’s too much, I’m going to let go.*\\n\\nGrabbing the rope again with both hands, I pulled as hard as I could. There was less resistance. I could see the top handle again.\\n\\nIn a desperate effort, I held the full weight in between my teeth, bent my back forward and, just for a split second, reached down with both hands at the same time, which allowed me to grip a generous amount of rope. It felt heavier than before, it was stuck somewhere for sure, but at that point, all I had left was pulling. And so I did.\\n\\nThe grey and brown mass that suddenly sprung onto the top of the ledge put a nervous smile on my face.\\n\\n*It’s done.*\\n\\nI pulled the rest of the rope and grabbed the backpack. The plastic shopping bag was gone. The rest was roughened up and scratched but no severe visible damage.\\n\\nI grabbed my phone and sent a one-liner text to my friends saying everything was ok, I was out of danger. It was a lie, but my chances were better now, and at that instant, I realised they’d probably panic if they read the first message alone.\\n\\nWith no time to spare, I untied the rope on both ends, tucked it in my waist bag, threw the rucksack on my back and looked up. There were a few boulders up ahead big enough to hold my weight and just when the rocks formed another wall too steep for me to climb, next to it, back on the ravine, was the fallen pine tree.\\n\\nI hiked my way up, gauging every step, making sure there were no loose boulders or shallow tuff to send me back down. When I got next to the pine tree, I jumped down and got on top of it. I was back inside the ravine but with a completely different agenda. The same branches that seemed to entrap me on my way down now became steps of a ladder to bring me back up.\\n\\nI moved swiftly. I felt reinvigorated and alert, almost as if going up was easier. Incredible what adrenaline does to your body and mind when survival mode kicks in.\\n\\nI got to the top. Standing in the same spot where earlier I had assessed the risk of the descent, I told myself off for a few seconds, turned around and started to stride.\\n\\nThe dusk was fully settled, there was no time left to walk back the same way, I would get lost in the sand racing tracks or worse, trip over a rock and injure myself. I needed a fast way down.\\n\\nAt this point, fatigue clouded most of my actions, so my memory is not precise. All I remember is walking around for a couple of minutes, looking down, until almost miraculously I saw a new ravine. This one was shorter, and I could finally see a direct connection to the ground below.\\n\\nWith no sunlight left and covered in dust from head to toe, I threw myself at it, quite literally.\\n\\nI started jogging down the ravine, and when the floor became unstable, I just let the tuff break and carry me down. I was sliding down a ravine again, but this time in control. I still had the gloves on so I used my palms to stop the descent, the same way a downhill skateboarder uses his special gloves on the tarmac.\\n\\nComing to a full stop near the end, I got back up and walked the last few metres to the valley’s ground.\\n\\nI took a deep breath. Those first few steps on solid, horizontal ground felt immeasurable. I was Armstrong, taking a giant step, not for Humanity but for my peace of mind. Even breathing felt otherworldly, as if oxygen itself was this inexplicable force, invading my lungs in its purest form, making me feel as alive as ever.\\n\\nI searched the rucksack for my headlamp. It was nighttime now, and I had to find a cave to rest my bones.\\n\\nAbsence of light always gives things a completely different aura. The wind was now blowing harder, and the trees — the same ones I had seen from the edge of the cliff earlier — were restless. I ignored the initial haunting feeling this gave me and kept moving towards the first carved house I could see.\\n\\nLooking around, 360 degrees, my eyes scrutinising every rocky chimney that sprung from the ground. I wasn’t really sure what I was looking for. The answer to the question I didn’t want to ask was already slowly crawling under my skin.\\n\\nA few minutes later I came across a hoodoo house that seemed fit for purpose. I went inside. It had several divisions and an upper floor, all with their own window-shaped holes carved along the rock…this created a lot of draft and all sorts of swooping noises. The first thing that popped in my mind was the Blair Witch house.\\n\\nThe floor was sandy and didn’t look very comfortable, and ultimately there was no real door or anything stopping wild animals or bugs from getting to me during the night. I could try to access the upper floor, but I had already explored similar carved hoodoos and knew the steps would be either blocked or broken to stop people from going up.\\n\\n*I can’t sleep here. This is creepy. It feels wrong. And I don’t even have water.*\\n\\n*This was such a stupid idea to begin with. What was I thinking?*\\n\\nAt last, a reckoning. I came to terms with the circumstances, and accepted the only one thing left to do: walk back to Göreme.\\n\\nAnd so I turned my back on the Rose Valley, using the visual map I had in my head, from hours earlier on top of the hill, as guidance. I switched off my headlamp to avoid attracting attention to my walk.\\n\\nThe clear night sky, with all its stars and round-shaped moon, was now my only sources of visibility. Everything looked grey now, almost pale, under a dark blue aura. I thought about the multicoloured spectacle I had witnessed earlier. It was a stark contrast.\\n\\nI eventually found the road. Seeing the town lights from afar gave me hope, but the whole walk back into Göreme lasted a good two hours.\\n\\nI was severely dehydrated, starving, and grey from head to toe. Dirt and dust continually found their way into my eyes and mouth. Several bruises and cuts covered my arms and legs and painful soreness affected most of my muscles. Had to stop several times either because of cramps or to alleviate the weight from the rucksack — the pressure of the straps over my shoulders felt like rubbing salt on open wounds.\\n\\nThere was an overall sensation of desperation progressively weighing on me at each step.\\n\\nBut I made it. I walked inside the first nice-looking hotel I could find in the centre of Göreme, ironically annexed to this gigantic hoodoo. It was pleasantly illuminated from outside, and I could tell they had a rooftop veranda for me to relax on the next morning.\\n\\nAs I stepped in and walked across to the reception counter, I looked inside my wallet: I had eight liras left. This was surely not a cheap place, that much money wouldn’t get me far.\\n\\nBehind the counter, a young Turkish man greeted me with a friendly face but a look of confusion.\\n\\nMy appearance left very little to wonder: I had been through hell and back, and there was no point in asking me about it.\\n\\nI asked if they had any rooms available. He nodded in accordance and asked for how many nights.\\n\\n“One night only.”\\n\\nHe pointed me to the mezzanine that overlooked the hotel lounge, the room would be on the first floor, and asked if that was ok. Breakfast was included.\\n\\n“I don’t have much cash on me. Do you take visa?”\\n\\nHe nodded favourably, went around the desk and asked if I’d like for him to carry the dirty bag up. I politely declined.\\n\\nWhile he led me up the stairs, I asked about checking in procedures and payment. He looked back at me, with a smile on his face.\\n\\n“Don’t worry. We do that tomorrow.”\\n\\nFrom time to time, when I’m having a tough day during my travels, I remind myself of that smile and the relief it brought me, along with the feeling of being safe.\\n\\nA genuine smile is all you need for good fortune.\\n\\n***I wrote this travel memoir as a thank you note to the people of Turkey, who welcomed me with open arms, drove me across states, put food in my belly and sheltered me from the night.***\\n\\n***May their smiles guide others into safe journeys.***\\n\\n### Previous part:\\n\\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x778b5DeBb5127a7B6F87e28E7033Dd54F6d1Ffaa/6N1ahQc57lHYBwcrSETDa0fuYRSYkYS83F2oOTjpu2c](https://mirror.xyz/0x778b5DeBb5127a7B6F87e28E7033Dd54F6d1Ffaa/6N1ahQc57lHYBwcrSETDa0fuYRSYkYS83F2oOTjpu2c)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1640772774,\"title\":\"That Time I Almost Died in Cappadocia (5/5)\"},\"digest\":\"zE5LEDtT9XDOKlVQYQSKfvURaw2dSbaE-72vXNsnDBA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x778b5DeBb5127a7B6F87e28E7033Dd54F6d1Ffaa\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PwYaAPmavm8yMAX7NDWlZjQMI3dT_nl_CVyLhn3v6gQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"w5ioO7jGlEOFm0c5fp9jhr7v32_sAjfTZY1Kn6dU7g8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Y4wBkBKIjKmkn7HnRL8TdrUbHHUb3EONz2scyquTQqbSUXeGW9Pky2opxIT93trwBzTqsSK-nkznPmvckaKOIg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5b8475ac802c007d3f3275bc5ca573854f06e88fe557476e8e02ee217667520d7202f18c98929aac75c363b83d952ff9bc2dacffa90719caa8e96d2956ee58671c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PwYaAPmavm8yMAX7NDWlZjQMI3dT_nl_CVyLhn3v6gQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"w5ioO7jGlEOFm0c5fp9jhr7v32_sAjfTZY1Kn6dU7g8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"-Jp0zeUIz8a5oMV26shgL6EzTU-EtKLp9ZnamktetlI\"}"
