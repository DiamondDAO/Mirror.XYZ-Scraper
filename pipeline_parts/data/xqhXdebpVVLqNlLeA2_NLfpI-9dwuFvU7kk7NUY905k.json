"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### The principles of Justice…\\n\\n[Are simple enough](https://worldjusticeproject.org/about-us/overview/what-rule-law).\\n\\n**Accountability:**\\\\\\nThe government as well as private actors are accountable under the law.\\n\\n**Just Laws:**\\\\\\nThe laws are clear, publicized, and stable; are applied evenly; and protect fundamental rights, including the security of persons and contract, property, and human rights.\\n\\n**Open Government:**\\\\\\nThe processes by which the laws are enacted, administered, and enforced are accessible, fair, and efficient.\\n\\n**Accessible & Impartial Dispute Resolution:**\\\\\\nJustice is delivered timely by competent, ethical, and independent representatives and neutrals who are accessible, have adequate resources, and reflect the makeup of the communities they serve.\\n\\nIndeed one might even posit that they are fairly obvious. But let us play the horrible mind game where we pretend to be a fat fucking feminist intent upon subverting and destroying these principles to the disadvantage of men… Quite a problem!\\n\\nIt may surprise you to hear that there is already a separate legal system which tries a person, almost always a man, along feminist religious principles in complete secrecy. Enter the MARAC!\\n\\n### Multi Agency Risk Assessment Conference.\\n\\nThese were designed by fat fucking feminists in Cardiff back in 2003. Naturally they were only to be used in the most serious of cases, rape and DV initially, to protect those poor women and children who are so utterly oppressed by the Patriarchy or at risk from domestic or sexual violence.\\n\\nIndeed it appears to be loosely based upon a system designed to finger potential terrorists… A system so successful at such that about 3% of the entire male Muslim population of the UK is now on a terrorist watch list! Which is clearly nonsense. Though does also pose quite a problem for the virtue signalling fat fucking feminists constant claims that 99.9% of the Muslim population is peaceful.\\n\\nThey take 16 different agencies front loaded with graceless feminists in the guise of Women’s Aid, [Perfect Rapists](https://redpilluk.wordpress.com/2018/03/23/lets-talk-about-rape/) ( aka Social Workers) and the Women’s Support Unit. They are obliged to treat any allegation against a man as gospel ( believe the victim) and they are not allowed to disclose any part of this procedure to the subject of such.\\n\\nNever heard of them huh? Doesn’t affect me? Sounds reasonable? Then read on…\\n\\n###  If >3% of Muslims are considered potential terrorists by a similar system..\\n\\nThen what proportion of UK based males have been subject to a MARAC without their knowledge?\\n\\nLet’s take their own [figures](https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2007/04/18/risk-assessment-and-domestic-violence-the-multi-agency-marac-model-of-intervention/)… 20 every two weeks back in 2007 just a few years after their introduction. Though the number of MARACs has increased by 70% since 2010. Indeed there are now so many that mini-MARACs by phone alone are commonplace as they take up so much valuable Perfect Rapist time and resources..\\n\\nIf we exclude those too old or too young to be subject to such and take the last census’ figures for Cardiff’s population then well over 10,000 Welsh dudes in their capital have been subject to a MARAC, about 1 in 8.\\n\\nThe figures I have seen from another part of the UK make this sound like an underestimate. Indeed this is clearly an underestimate anyway as we didn’t exclude those who are single, gay or factor in that merely having children or being married / cohabiting will massively increase the odds of having been subject to a MARAC. Nor too the assumed prejudice from fat fucking feminists and the gender cleansing police in favour of ethnic minorities and the like.\\n\\nBasically if you are a stale white male with a normal relationship there is a pretty decent chance that you have been defamed without any knowledge of such.\\n\\nAny involvement with the police, family courts, have had a relationship end acrimoniously or upset any fat vengedful feminist at any time then more than likely you have…. In fact almost certainly have in many of those scenarios…\\n\\n### Surely safeguarding children and women is a laudable aim?\\n\\nOh you naive fool.\\n\\nWhat is laudable is that you assume these unlawful congregations of gossipping witches are designed to be used for good and right.. You clearly don’t understand feminism.\\n\\nAs these are used in cases of rape one would correctly suppose that the 5000+ victims of rape gangs in Skipton, Rotherham, Blackpool, Sheffield, Oxford, Halifax, Bradford, Ipswich, London, Telford, Preston, Derby, Torbay, Bristol, Banbury, Chesham, Birmingham, Barking, Blackburn, Rochdale, Leeds, Stockport, Aylesbury, Yeovil, Newcastle, Burton, Accrington, Ormskirk, Manchester, Keighley, Oldham, Peterborough, Dewsbury, Littlehampton, Middlesborough and Slough would have triggered MARACs.\\n\\nHowever they were used instead to defame the victims themselves… Note that all or most of the above will have separate Social Services departments..\\n\\nThe poor victims would be left reeling and confused as to why no government agency would hear their cries for help and justice, as they had already been labelled as racist drug abusing prostitues by our wonderful Perfect Rapists. Recall that 16 agencies or government departments are involved, basically all of them. Hence all avenues for help and safety were closed off by a mere edict from the Home Office.\\n\\nIf this can happen to schoolgirls being raped on an industrial scale then I’m sure we can all agree that being judged by a coven of blue haired mastodons who firmly believe that all men are rapists is always going to go swimmingly for you…\\n\\n### Okay… But how does this relate to the Principles of Justice?\\n\\nWell let’s remember that our little mental game is to attempt to subvert the principles of justice.. So let’s give the problem to an engineer…\\n\\n“A tricky problem.. Was a three pipe problem in fact..” He muses… “Centuries of common law and the strict adherence to open justice do take some…. ingenuity to subvert.” He says reaching for his pipe. “It will have to be extra-judicial, no point trying to do this through laws as that would involve public scrutiny, or not explicitly so anyway.” He continues.\\n\\n“So what have you come up with? Let’s take accountability first.”\\n\\n“Yes, let’s..” says the engineer with a smile, “That was the easiest part. To make it unaccountable we merely keep it secret. Our [Perfect Rapists](https://redpilluk.wordpress.com/2018/03/23/lets-talk-about-rape/) and anyone else trained by the state in feminist principles have been conditioned to always believe the victim, so we merely make that policy from the Home Office. We simply add a confidentiality clause to that, such that anyone subject to a MARAC could never find out without there being some breach of data privacy.”\\n\\n“Ok I get that…. Simple as you say…. What about Just Laws?”\\n\\n“Mere incrementalism old boy… Merely add clauses to make the law contradictory, as we did with hate speech, and let the judge decide which side of the law to choose.”\\n\\n“But what if the judges choose the wrong side? That doesn’t sound like a sound design, leaving things to chance almost.”\\n\\n“Oh I’ve thought about that and I’m quite proud of my design. I’d like to introduce you to the concept of safeguarding…”\\n\\n“Sounds fluffy!”\\n\\n“Yes it is…” he winks knowingly, “Very easy to sell such a.. fluffy as you put it.. term. If there were any media scrutiny. ” He stifles a laugh, “Then the response writes itself.. How could anyone be against safeguarding women or children? The concept and rule here is that anything relating to safeguarding has to be disclosed to the judge.”\\n\\n“But it will be challenged in court if that happens, that sounds like open justice…”\\n\\n“Oh no you miss the point. Victim confidentiality means that such things will merely be handed to the judge unquestioned, not raised in open court. No need for evidence old boy, merely accusations or hypotheticals.”\\n\\n“How on earth do you propose to do that? No lawyer would risk the entire legal system being subverted by secret evidence whispered into a judges ear!”\\n\\nThe engineer almost falls off his chair. Looks at you as though you were a petulant child, fills his pipe and condescends to explain…\\n\\n“No state barrister or solicitor on £2000 a day will want to win all of their cases you mean? Are you mad? Have you ever met one of them? You think they drive Skodas and shop in Aldi?? Quite the opposite, they will submit such idle gossip or else they will end up on the defence side, and lose all their cases. They will be told that they have a duty to safeguard and submit such errant nonsense, regardless of context. Most of them are male, and quite competitive. They like to win. Anyone who doesn’t… Well the council or police simply contract a different and more…. reliable type… The defence loses 99.9% of all cases in family courts but do you see family law solicitors advertising this fact?”.\\n\\n“Ok I get it… So basically what you propse is an entirely separate legal system where a chap’s guilt or innocence is decided long before a trial by…. well it’s effetively a different court. A feminist court. And that it’s conclusions are whispered to the judge outside of normal court proceedings such that there is no possibility of a defence? Surely the judges won’t buy this?”\\n\\n“They already have old boy!” The engineer smirks, “Blair saw to that, purging the judiciary of anyone considered ‘reactionary’.”\\n\\n“But what if all these agencies at a MARAC don’t reach the conclusion that a chap is a bad type? A bad apple?”\\n\\n“Oh that is simple… We just add more feminists. Barnados, NSPCC, even the RSPCA should his dog ever have had an accident. They’ll all verge on the side of safeguarding and caution, would rather raise suspicion and cover their own backs just in case he is a potential rapist… As they are convinced that all blokes are anyway.”\\n\\nThe engineer starts to look a little smug.\\n\\n“So this is basically just giving fat fucking feminists an active role in the judicial system by encouraging them to defame a bloke by whispering to a judge in ways which he will not even be aware of?”  You ponder this… The full horror dawning on you slowly…\\n\\n“Basically yes. Simple designs are always the best.”  His smugness becomes almost overwhelming..\\n\\n“So what about marketting, propagation? Also the last principle of dispute resolution?\\n\\n“Ah yes, they are taken care of.” He enthuses, lighting his pipe and contemplating his creation “Give anyone ‘raising a concern’ a day off work to sit in a room gossipping with other harpies should help, tea and endless cakes provided of course…. Our friends at the Home Office making such things policy and imposing them upon local authorities pretty much closes the loop. You are aware that gossipping is considered a pleasureable activity by certain gender groups are you not? As for dispute resolution, what disputes could there possibly be?\\n\\n“What if a chap appeals? Challenges the basis for this defamation?”\\n\\n“And how would he even know about it? You think his ex-wife, girlfriend, GP or state employee tells him about it? He wouldn’t know that his GP was prescribing him drugs such as Mirtazipine to mong him out due to secretly considering him a wife beater, he wouldn’t know anything about the process or details, there is in short nothing whatsoever to dispute. And don’t forget that I designed our [Perfect Rapists](https://redpilluk.wordpress.com/2018/03/23/lets-talk-about-rape/) to be immune from defamation. Whilst a chap might feel unfairly treated he would have no clue why.”\\n\\nYou both sit in silence whilst the engineer contentedly sucks on his pipe.\\n\\n“So you designed this along feminist lines, such that they could subvert the justice system…” you begin but the engineer interupts you..\\n\\n“I was merely given a problem to solve. And solve it I have, I think you will agree…”\\n\\n“But what if this is abused? Such as Rotherham, Telford etc. What if this extrajudicial system falls into the wrong hands, is used politically… I hear that increasing numbers of MARACs are held to investigate the supposedly far right. Even religious groups…”\\n\\n“My dear chap I can’t be held responsible for how people misuse my designs.” His smugness dented somewhat..\\n\\n“But is has been misused.” You insist, “What of the victims of Rotherham, how could they possibly seek justice against this state apparatus which destroyed their lives? Defamed them, denied them justice? The entire establishment, all state agencies and media acting in concert against them? What safety valve or recourse have you incorporated to ensure it can’t be misused or abused for political advantage?”\\n\\nThe engineer looks angry. “There was no requirement for one. I merely designed the system as instructed.”\\n\\n“What is to stop members of political parties leaking such things to media, confidential briefings and the like? Dubious allegations from embittered exes… Hang on….This is happening isn’t it?\\n\\nThe engineer looks worried, “No, no… That isn’t the purpose of this design… It is to protect women and children!”\\n\\n“And you’ve never met a feminist with a lefty political agenda then?! You don’t think it beyond them to use this and other spurious bollocks to political advantage? To smear their opponents? You don’t think that this resembles a massive spy network and defamation database? ”\\n\\nThe engineer is now staring out of the window, his pipe has gone out and he suddenly looks 15 years older.\\n\\n“Well that’s a potential problem I admit?” he murmurs…\\n\\n“Potential problem? Have you read the papers these days? How did the BBC know that Cliff Richard was going to be arrested? Even though he was entirely innocent they had time to hire a helicopter to film it, and that wasn’t even political. Have you not noticed that right of centre politicians are constantly having dubious allegations from their past brought up? Where the hell do you think these come from?\\n\\n“Well it could be anywhere really… Journalists have their own sources after all.”\\n\\n“And no one from the 16 agencies, charities and otherwise feminist stocked organisations is ever likely to tip the press off for political advantage or money are they? Meanwhile 95% of those in prison are male, I can’t imagine why! Do you realise that you’ve designed a political police force?”\\n\\nThe engineer squirms…. But doesn’t answer.\\n\\n“One further question…. What happens if this state apparatus is taken over by some group even more obnoxious or hideous than feminists? What happens if they merely measure a chap’s head and whisper to the judge that he is a Jew for instance? What if feminists are just useful idiots and you’ve designed and implemented a system that the Stasi would be proud of?”\\n\\n“Feminists assured me that they merely seek equality.” he mutters weakly, now visibly ashen faced…\\n\\n“So why do they need a system that completely undermines and destroys the justice system, holds a database or potentially useful political smears, targets their political opponents and ensures completely partial and unequal justice for half of the population? Hell next they’ll be making opposition to feminism illegal!”\\n\\n“Erm…. I also did some work for the EU via Tony Blair.” me mutters apologetically… “[You may be interested in section 2E](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009\\\\_2014/documents/libe/dv/11\\\\_revframework_statute\\\\_/11\\\\_revframework_statute_en.pdf)“.\\n\\nEdit: Brief talky talky on this post….
