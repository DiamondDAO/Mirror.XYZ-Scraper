"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The project has raised $6 million to date from Jump Capital, New Form Capital, Kenetic Capital, Cakebox Capital, The LAO, Impossible Finance, The Crypto Founders Network, Big Brain Holdings, Hestia Holdings, Amino Capital, Drop Ventures, XTBO Humla Ventures as well as angels from MakerDAO, IBM, NASA, Google and Deloitte, to name a few.\\n\\n## Striving for social impact\\n\\nIn operation, this is executed through the decentralized autonomous organization or [DAO](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/what-is-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-and-how-does-a-dao-work) model. Unlike DeFi, DAOs look at the community rather than the financial industry, transferring the ability to drive decisions away from the organization and towards the people.\\n\\nPopcorn is kickstarting its project with Butter, a basket of wrapped yield-bearing stablecoins made with DAO treasuries and gas-conscious users in mind that is estimated to yield 20% APY on Tether ([USDT](https://cointelegraph.com/tether-price-index)), USD Coin ([USDC)](https://cointelegraph.com/usdc-price-index), Dai (DAI), or LP 3pool Curve (3CRV), along with a social impact stablecoin. The coin is not only the first of its kind but will allow users to create an impact just by holding the coin. In practice, the stablecoin is the product of an overcollateralized loan and repayment process that operates through smart contracts on Popcorn.\\n\\nAs users extract value, a portion of the fees -- anywhere from 20-50% -- is redirected towards organizations striving for social impact, some of which are nominated by the token holders themselves. The team currently invites social organizations to learn more about becoming a beneficiary.\\n\\nMORE INSIGHTS INTO POPCORN\",\"timestamp\":1639034595,\"title\":\"The project has raised $6 million to date from Jump Capital\"},\"digest\":\"Uk-_1YF8Gm4Eyff-gGrI904-zxM-Ktz8A4JjmhJbSq8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD81B08480d3f7e80f3f4cdDE441f5415b584d208\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fsUIMijJx7quvl4zHvnOjvMdZpZuNHEKMD3oXg5o7y8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KU8ihVH5m0C7KzItBbQEEZIXVQoRel42NctXYfkFeLE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"3Vqd9Ouoc7TxNBcdMQEvxBoPSUtpykGRAkeK1WTZ5GOHCD42-yykO5Js_EffDzuMQcpf65t-Eai1WwLBnvotgQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x13aa8b2c8c8bf3f055c3a194b2858c0c9631c2df5656210a4342771837d386474491b19c099930e497be5134f163c446c2d13a51fb201f775eecfa2f1a6e77291b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fsUIMijJx7quvl4zHvnOjvMdZpZuNHEKMD3oXg5o7y8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KU8ihVH5m0C7KzItBbQEEZIXVQoRel42NctXYfkFeLE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Uk-_1YF8Gm4Eyff-gGrI904-zxM-Ktz8A4JjmhJbSq8\"}"
