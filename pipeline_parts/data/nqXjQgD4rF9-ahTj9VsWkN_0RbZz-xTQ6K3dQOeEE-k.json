"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"If you saw Apollo DAO’s recent post on “[Wen Launch?](https://www.loop.markets/the-most-pressing-question-wen-launch/)”, you should have some idea of our plans for launch, but today we want to go into a little more detail on what exactly our Community Farming Event is, as well as how you can get involved.\\n\\n### When is the Apollo DAO Community Farming Event and how will it work?\\n\\nThe Apollo DAO Community Farming Event will launch on the 14th of September, with 3 million Apollo tokens (3% of the total supply) available to be farmed by our community before the Apollo token is released, at a fixed price of $0.25. \\n\\nThe way the Apollo DAO Community Farming Event will work is; our users will be able to deposit mAsset LP tokens, as well as other Terra Governance token LP pairs, including MIR/UST, ANC/UST and MINE/UST onto the Apollo Platform, with the rewards from these pairs being used to purchase Apollo tokens at the price of $0.25. This will work in a similar way to [Orion’s Private Farming](https://www.loop.markets/why-apollo-dao-is-participating-in-orion-money-private-farming/), however rather than utilising the 20% from Anchor rewards, our users will be able to make use of the yield from mAssets and Terra Governance LP Tokens to farm Apollo tokens. Our Community Farming Event will be open to all users in order to distribute the Apollo tokens widely amongst our community.\\n\\nThe Apollo DAO Community Farming Event will continue until all 3 million Apollo tokens have been farmed, with all Apollo tokens locked until the TGE. All money raised from the Community Farming Event will be used to bootstrap the Warchest.\\n\\n### Apollo Token TGE and initial Liquidity.\\n\\nOnce all 3 million Apollo tokens have been farmed, we will launch the Apollo token. Apollo will launch with a circulating supply of around 5 million Apollo tokens, with Community Farming participants receiving 50% of their tokens up front, with the remaining 50% distributed monthly over the first year.\\n\\nFrom our Community Farming Event, we will be raising $750k UST, all of which will be used to initially bootstrap the Warchest, along with 2 million Apollo tokens (included in the initial 5 million circulating supply) to seed the initial liquidity. Of these 2 million Apollo tokens, 1 million will be used with $250k UST for the initial liquidity on TerraSwap, with the remaining 1 million Apollo tokens used for other opportunities, such as potentially providing liquidity on Loop and Astroport. All funds that are controlled by the Warchest, including the initial liquidity, are owned and managed by the Apollo token holders.\",\"timestamp\":1639557435,\"title\":\"Apollo DAO – Community Farming Event and the Launch of the Apollo token\"},\"digest\":\"8m_blVo3gfBQyo4ltAkm1d_W__7Yeoi1m_4azXAV9M4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x061dc3EEAb67dbe0835BFC4D45135a967b9B20d1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"VFeeBX8pVRMmXwvUBpM1loNSv1RIUJrOUVVHs-Da-mE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"x3hZ0_Xulfm-JgcTyfblskzwN-tEPWKG1HWCAwiim44\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"K6VGrHcZQLhmVfpU43KMQ5ww-USj34v1sjlQ2A22x7uyIUmiMT4Kbk91QdABMxgVBsRA_D4htLc8pLipc6m4Gw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xbb3e2cde7fbd5b4d0502ccd045e6ede5daca3cf6195487fa10b48478e67c57fd3043981413fcb9d5910e7fae381e6fe320cb3e3581692b4ac6048671bffe756a1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"VFeeBX8pVRMmXwvUBpM1loNSv1RIUJrOUVVHs-Da-mE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"x3hZ0_Xulfm-JgcTyfblskzwN-tEPWKG1HWCAwiim44\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"8m_blVo3gfBQyo4ltAkm1d_W__7Yeoi1m_4azXAV9M4\"}"
