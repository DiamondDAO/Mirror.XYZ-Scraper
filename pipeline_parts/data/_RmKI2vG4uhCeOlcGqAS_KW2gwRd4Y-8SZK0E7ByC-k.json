Similar to Kafka producer and consumer.\\n* smart contracts are immutable - include functions to update addresses instead of hardcoding incase dependency breaks\\n* not everyone should have the ability to update the data in the smart contract, use Ownable contract for only the owner to access / use. When the contract is first created, the constructor sets owner to msg.sender. \\n* Modifiers are decorator functions that are executed before the main function. You can attach modifiers to functions such as function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyOwner  \\n* reduce size of structs if possible to reduce gas fees\\n* time units such as 1 seconds/minutes/hours/etc. and add to “now”\\n* calldata instead of memory for external functions\\n* view functions do not require gas fees\\n* storage fees more expensive than memory fees\\n* modifiers are anything that change behavior of function: visibility modifiers (private, public, internal, external), state modifier (view for reading, pure for not saving data), custom modifiers (decorators we create), and payable modifier (receive Ether)\\n* msg.value contains amount of Ether (related to msg.sender)\\n* payable units (0.001 ether)\\n* ether cannot be sent to an address, must be transferred to “address payable”\\n\\n[https://share.cryptozombies.io/en/lesson/3/share/NoName?id=Y3p8MTYxODI2](https://share.cryptozombies.io/en/lesson/3/share/NoName?id=Y3p8MTYxODI2)\\n\\n[https://share.cryptozombies.io/en/lesson/4/share/NoName?id=WyJjenwxNjE4MjYiLDEsMTRd](https://share.cryptozombies.io/en/lesson/4/share/NoName?id=WyJjenwxNjE4MjYiLDEsMTRd)\\n\\nOverall Thoughts: \\n  \\n I completed CryptoZombies in about one hour, and overall it gave a strong overview of Solidity concepts through building a zombies project.
