"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"And she also knew where the Lebruns lived, on Chartres Street.\\n\\nTheir home from the outside looked like a prison, with iron bars before the door and lower windows.  The iron bars were a relic of the old regime, and no one had ever thought of dislodging them.  At the side was a high fence enclosing the garden.  A gate or door opening upon the street was locked.  Edna rang the bell at this side garden gate, and stood upon the banquette, waiting to be admitted.\\n\\nIt was Victor who opened the gate for her.  A black woman, wiping her hands upon her apron, was close at his heels.  Before she saw them Edna could hear them in altercation, the woman--plainly an anomaly--claiming the right to be allowed to perform her duties, one of which was to answer the bell.\\n\\nVictor was surprised and delighted to see Mrs. Pontellier, and he made no attempt to conceal either his astonishment or his delight.  He was a dark-browed, good-looking youngster of nineteen, greatly resembling his mother, but with ten times her impetuosity. He instructed the black woman to go at once and inform Madame Lebrun that Mrs. Pontellier desired to see her.  The woman grumbled a refusal to do part of her duty when she had not been permitted to do it all, and started back to her interrupted task of weeding the garden.  Whereupon Victor administered a rebuke in the form of a volley of abuse, which, owing to its rapidity and incoherence, was all but incomprehensible to Edna.  Whatever it was, the rebuke was convincing, for the woman dropped her hoe and went mumbling into the house.\\n\\nEdna did not wish to enter.  It was very pleasant there on the side porch, where there were chairs, a wicker lounge, and a small table.  She seated herself, for she was tired from her long tramp; and she began to rock gently and smooth out the folds of her silk parasol.  Victor drew up his chair beside her.  He at once explained that the black woman's offensive conduct was all due to imperfect training, as he was not there to take her in hand.  He had only come up from the island the morning before, and expected to return next day.  He stayed all winter at the island; he lived there, and kept the place in order and got things ready for the summer visitors.\\n\\nBut a man needed occasional relaxation, he informed Mrs. Pontellier, and every now and again he drummed up a pretext to bring him to the city.  My! but he had had a time of it the evening before!  He wouldn't want his mother to know, and he began to talk in a whisper.  He was scintillant with recollections.  Of course, he couldn't think of telling Mrs. Pontellier all about it, she being a woman and not comprehending such things.  But it all began with a girl peeping and smiling at him through the shutters as he passed by.  Oh! but she was a beauty!  Certainly he smiled back, and went up and talked to her.  Mrs. Pontellier did not know him if she supposed he was one to let an opportunity like that escape him. Despite herself, the youngster amused her.  She must have betrayed in her look some degree of interest or entertainment.  The boy grew more daring, and Mrs. Pontellier might have found herself, in a little while, listening to a highly colored story but for the timely appearance of Madame Lebrun.\\n\\nThat lady was still clad in white, according to her custom of the summer. Her eyes beamed an effusive welcome.  Would not Mrs. Pontellier go inside? Would she partake of some refreshment?  Why had she not been there before? How was that dear Mr. Pontellier and how were those sweet children? Had Mrs. Pontellier ever known such a warm November?\\n\\nVictor went and reclined on the wicker lounge behind his mother's chair, where he commanded a view of Edna's face.  He had taken her parasol from her hands while he spoke to her, and he now lifted it and twirled it above him as he lay on his back.  When Madame Lebrun complained that it was so dull coming back to the city; that she saw so few people now; that even Victor, when he came up from the island for a day or two, had so much to occupy him and engage his time; then it was that the youth went into contortions on the lounge and winked mischievously at Edna. She somehow felt like a confederate in crime, and tried to look severe and disapproving.\\n\\nThere had been but two letters from Robert, with little in them, they told her.  Victor said it was really not worth while to go inside for the letters, when his mother entreated him to go in search of them.  He remembered the contents, which in truth he rattled off very glibly when put to the test.\\n\\nOne letter was written from Vera Cruz and the other from the City of Mexico.  He had met Montel, who was doing everything toward his advancement.  So far, the financial situation was no improvement over the one he had left in New Orleans, but of course the prospects were vastly better.  He wrote of the City of Mexico, the buildings, the people and their habits, the conditions of life which he found there.  He sent his love to the family.  He inclosed a check to his mother, and hoped she would affectionately remember him to all his friends.  That was about the substance of the two letters.  Edna felt that if there had been a message for her, she would have received it.  The despondent frame of mind in which she had left home began again to overtake her, and she remembered that she wished to find Mademoiselle Reisz.\\n\\nMadame Lebrun knew where Mademoiselle Reisz lived.  She gave Edna the address, regretting that she would not consent to stay and spend the remainder of the afternoon, and pay a visit to Mademoiselle Reisz some other day.  The afternoon was already well advanced.\\n\\nVictor escorted her out upon the banquette, lifted her parasol, and held it over her while he walked to the car with her. He entreated her to bear in mind that the disclosures of the afternoon were strictly confidential.  She laughed and bantered him a little, remembering too late that she should have been dignified and reserved.\\n\\n\\\"How handsome Mrs. Pontellier looked!\\\" said Madame Lebrun to her son.\\n\\n\\\"Ravishing!\\\" he admitted.  \\\"The city atmosphere has improved her. Some way she doesn't seem like the same woman.\\\"\\n\\nXXI\\n\\nSome people contended that the reason Mademoiselle Reisz always chose apartments up under the roof was to discourage the approach of beggars, peddlars and callers.  There were plenty of windows in her little front room.  They were for the most part dingy, but as they were nearly always open it did not make so much difference.  They often admitted into the room a good deal of smoke and soot; but at the same time all the light and air that there was came through them.  From her windows could be seen the crescent of the river, the masts of ships and the big chimneys of the Mississippi steamers.  A magnificent piano crowded the apartment. In the next room she slept, and in the third and last she harbored a gasoline stove on which she cooked her meals when disinclined to descend to the neighboring restaurant.  It was there also that she ate, keeping her belongings in a rare old buffet, dingy and battered from a hundred years of use.\\n\\nWhen Edna knocked at Mademoiselle Reisz's front room door and entered, she discovered that person standing beside the window, engaged in mending or patching an old prunella gaiter.  The little musician laughed all over when she saw Edna.  Her laugh consisted of a contortion of the face and all the muscles of the body. She seemed strikingly homely, standing there in the afternoon light. She still wore the shabby lace and the artificial bunch of violets on the side of her head.\\n\\n\\\"So you remembered me at last,\\\" said Mademoiselle. \\\"I had said to myself, \\\\`Ah, bah! she will never come.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did you want me to come?\\\" asked Edna with a smile.\\n\\n\\\"I had not thought much about it,\\\" answered Mademoiselle.  The two had seated themselves on a little bumpy sofa which stood against the wall.  \\\"I am glad, however, that you came.  I have the water boiling back there, and was just about to make some coffee. You will drink a cup with me.  And how is la belle dame? Always handsome! always healthy! always contented!\\\"  She took Edna's hand between her strong wiry fingers, holding it loosely without warmth, and executing a sort of double theme upon the back and palm.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" she went on; \\\"I sometimes thought: \\\\`She will never come.  She promised as those women in society always do, without meaning it.  She will not come.' For I really don't believe you like me, Mrs. Pontellier.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know whether I like you or not,\\\" replied Edna, gazing down at the little woman with a quizzical look.\\n\\nThe candor of Mrs. Pontellier's admission greatly pleased Mademoiselle Reisz.  She expressed her gratification by repairing forthwith to the region of the gasoline stove and rewarding her guest with the promised cup of coffee.  The coffee and the biscuit accompanying it proved very acceptable to Edna, who had declined refreshment at Madame Lebrun's and was now beginning to feel hungry.  Mademoiselle set the tray which she brought in upon a small table near at hand, and seated herself once again on the lumpy sofa.\\n\\n\\\"I have had a letter from your friend,\\\" she remarked, as she poured a little cream into Edna's cup and handed it to her.\\n\\n\\\"My friend?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, your friend Robert.  He wrote to me from the City of Mexico.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Wrote to YOU?\\\" repeated Edna in amazement, stirring her coffee absently.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, to me.  Why not?  Don't stir all the warmth out of your coffee; drink it.  Though the letter might as well have been sent to you; it was nothing but Mrs. Pontellier from beginning to end.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let me see it,\\\" requested the young woman, entreatingly.\\n\\n\\\"No; a letter concerns no one but the person who writes it and the one to whom it is written.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Haven't you just said it concerned me from beginning to end?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It was written about you, not to you.  `Have you seen Mrs. Pontellier?  How is she looking?' he asks.  `As Mrs. Pontellier says,' or `as Mrs. Pontellier once said.' `If Mrs. Pontellier should call upon you, play for her that Impromptu of Chopin's, my favorite.  I heard it here a day or two ago, but not as you play it.  I should like to know how it affects her,' and so on, as if he supposed we were constantly in each other's society.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let me see the letter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have you answered it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let me see the letter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, and again, no.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then play the Impromptu for me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is growing late; what time do you have to be home?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Time doesn't concern me.  Your question seems a little rude. Play the Impromptu.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you have told me nothing of yourself.  What are you doing?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Painting!\\\" laughed Edna.  \\\"I am becoming an artist.  Think of it!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah! an artist!  You have pretensions, Madame.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why pretensions?  Do you think I could not become an artist?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do not know you well enough to say.  I do not know your talent or your temperament.  To be an artist includes much; one must possess many gifts--absolute gifts--which have not been acquired by one's own effort.  And, moreover, to succeed, the artist must possess the courageous soul.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you mean by the courageous soul?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Courageous, ma foi!  The brave soul.  The soul that dares and defies.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Show me the letter and play for me the Impromptu.  You see that I have persistence.  Does that quality count for anything in art?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It counts with a foolish old woman whom you have captivated,\\\" replied Mademoiselle, with her wriggling laugh.\\n\\nThe letter was right there at hand in the drawer of the little table upon which Edna had just placed her coffee cup.  Mademoiselle opened the drawer and drew forth the letter, the topmost one.  She placed it in Edna's hands, and without further comment arose and went to the piano.\\n\\nMademoiselle played a soft interlude.  It was an improvisation.  She sat low at the instrument, and the lines of her body settled into ungraceful curves and angles that gave it an appearance of deformity.  Gradually and imperceptibly the interlude melted into the soft opening minor chords of the Chopin Impromptu.\\n\\nEdna did not know when the Impromptu began or ended.  She sat in the sofa corner reading Robert's letter by the fading light. Mademoiselle had glided from the Chopin into the quivering lovenotes of Isolde's song, and back again to the Impromptu with its soulful and poignant longing.\\n\\nThe shadows deepened in the little room.  The music grew strange and fantastic--turbulent, insistent, plaintive and soft with entreaty.  The shadows grew deeper.  The music filled the room.  It floated out upon the night, over the housetops, the crescent of the river, losing itself in the silence of the upper air.\\n\\nEdna was sobbing, just as she had wept one midnight at Grand Isle when strange, new voices awoke in her.  She arose in some agitation to take her departure.  \\\"May I come again, Mademoiselle?\\\" she asked at the threshold.\\n\\n\\\"Come whenever you feel like it.  Be careful; the stairs and landings are dark; don't stumble.\\\"\\n\\nMademoiselle reentered and lit a candle.  Robert's letter was on the floor.  She stooped and picked it up.  It was crumpled and damp with tears.  Mademoiselle smoothed the letter out, restored it to the envelope, and replaced it in the table drawer.\\n\\nXXII\\n\\nOne morning on his way into town Mr. Pontellier stopped at the house of his old friend and family physician, Doctor Mandelet.  The Doctor was a semi-retired physician, resting, as the saying is, upon his laurels.  He bore a reputation for wisdom rather than skill--leaving the active practice of medicine to his assistants and younger contemporaries--and was much sought for in matters of consultation.  A few families, united to him by bonds of friendship, he still attended when they required the services of a physician.  The Pontelliers were among these.\\n\\nMr. Pontellier found the Doctor reading at the open window of his study.  His house stood rather far back from the street, in the center of a delightful garden, so that it was quiet and peaceful at the old gentleman's study window.  He was a great reader.  He stared up disapprovingly over his eye-glasses as Mr. Pontellier entered, wondering who had the temerity to disturb him at that hour of the morning.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, Pontellier!  Not sick, I hope.  Come and have a seat. What news do you bring this morning?\\\"  He was quite portly, with a profusion of gray hair, and small blue eyes which age had robbed of much of their brightness but none of their penetration.\\n\\n\\\"Oh!  I'm never sick, Doctor.  You know that I come of tough fiber--of that old Creole race of Pontelliers that dry up and finally blow away.  I came to consult--no, not precisely to consult--to talk to you about Edna.  I don't know what ails her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Madame Pontellier not well,\\\" marveled the Doctor.  \\\"Why, I saw her--I think it was a week ago--walking along Canal Street, the picture of health, it seemed to me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, yes; she seems quite well,\\\" said Mr. Pontellier, leaning forward and whirling his stick between his two hands; \\\"but she doesn't act well.  She's odd, she's not like herself.  I can't make her out, and I thought perhaps you'd help me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How does she act?\\\" inquired the Doctor.\\n\\n\\\"Well, it isn't easy to explain,\\\" said Mr. Pontellier, throwing himself back in his chair.  \\\"She lets the housekeeping go to the dickens.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, well; women are not all alike, my dear Pontellier. We've got to consider--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know that; I told you I couldn't explain.  Her whole attitude--toward me and everybody and everything--has changed.  You know I have a quick temper, but I don't want to quarrel or be rude to a woman, especially my wife; yet I'm driven to it, and feel like ten thousand devils after I've made a fool of myself.  She's making it devilishly uncomfortable for me,\\\" he went on nervously.  \\\"She's got some sort of notion in her head concerning the eternal rights of women; and--you understand--we meet in the morning at the breakfast table.\\\"\\n\\nThe old gentleman lifted his shaggy eyebrows, protruded his thick nether lip, and tapped the arms of his chair with his cushioned fingertips.\\n\\n\\\"What have you been doing to her, Pontellier?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Doing!  Parbleu!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Has she,\\\" asked the Doctor, with a smile, \\\"has she been associating of late with a circle of pseudo-intellectual women--super-spiritual superior beings?  My wife has  been telling me about them.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1639988724,\"title\":\"\\nEdna knew that Madame Lebrun had returned to the city, for it was the middle of November.\"},\"digest\":\"5Cb9MM44M4oqNsUOqrW0WViHvLXa0EMrtJtDP6TceiU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xADCB4dF6dDE8773EbfDdd36e426C63f9732738c9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"357pMJEzAgwJ1NLWG9E1DkNAW1rTfxaqo3MZZZOJbpo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"9XNZHmSmBueD7aR1q9_6j657PCrYKiFv_PZEQm-eLr4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"P8YfmvLe748zHZfzPVQLXHEXnXaRYcvRfdCN1KMmTjb034xNABgR7Sbbvo2knst-n-FSleNYrgWUvLvncwNqIg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x360bc844217f6ca81090b6f74ae7101b192dd03f6ac3ca81f2ffe65229c96ef1158fd8d352e3a30f1d69828b56aa7277bf436fda3010a842659a6d52ce722bf61b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"357pMJEzAgwJ1NLWG9E1DkNAW1rTfxaqo3MZZZOJbpo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"9XNZHmSmBueD7aR1q9_6j657PCrYKiFv_PZEQm-eLr4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"5Cb9MM44M4oqNsUOqrW0WViHvLXa0EMrtJtDP6TceiU\"}"
