"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Ideas / Proposals\\n\\nIn our last community call (or CC3), we brought some ideas on the table such as creating an investment fund, buying properties or even purchasing a basketball or a football team (!). Before setting the vision and the mission of our DAO, we have discussed some small projects to get us off the ground. The suggestion was to do some small projects, to start generating some revenue.\\n\\nWe also talked about building a strong treasury by offering high APYs in order to motivate investors to stake crypto. We discussed creating an investment fund and we are thinking about whether we should build an actively or passively managed fund.\\n\\n## Governance / Citizenship / Logistics\\n\\nIn the recent community call of Jan 13th, 2022, we had our first brainstorming on how to approach the marketing aspect of our DAO. More publicity, means more citizens, more engagement within and outside the community and a fairer and more exciting DAO!\\n\\nFinally, there have been lots of interesting conversations around voting and funding of projects in this early stage. Key to doing this is citizenship and the NFT. But we kind of need an imperfect solution to move forward, at least on the voting side, which leads us to provide temporary citizenship to those who attend the community calls. We are rewarding with POAP NFTs, those who participate in the community calls which enables them to vote and also make new proposals on our snapshot (<https://snapshot.org/#/swoldao.eth>).\\n\\nDeeper discussion about non-citizens having limited access and NFT whitelist (POAP holders) will be carried out in the next community call (CC4).\\n\\n![To the moon!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bhuvQ8ZKOR1TqrVxWJdLq.gif?height=1080&width=1080)\\n\\n## SwolDAO So Farâ€¦\\n\\n*First, letâ€™s do a quick recap of the SwolDAO adventure so far:*\\n\\nMonth 1: December - laying the groundwork\\n\\n* December 1 -[ DAOâ€™s Discord](https://discord.gg/gZMan2r6Hr) is ON\\n* December 7 -[ SwolDAO starts](https://twitter.com/greekdubliner/status/1468318994721656836)\\n* December 23 - First Community call\\n\\nMonth 2: January - more groundwork\\n\\n* January 3 - We finally have our swoldao.eth domain & snapshot for proper voting\\n* January 6 - Second Community call - Roadmap / Mission / Vision and other Ideas\\n* January 7 - Set up Discord POAP bot and Collab.join bot (awesome bots!)\\n* January 13 - Third Community call - Ideas, a look into the future of SwolDAO\\n\\nKeep checking our course as we will trace our journey in the Metaverse Galaxies and follow us on[ Twitter](https://twitter.com/InvestmentDAO) [Â Notion](https://nettle-meteor-58c.notion.site/SwolDAO-43a01412ccd84a98a57550627b57a8ad) and[ Discord](https://discord.gg/gZMan2r6Hr)\",\"timestamp\":1642691535,\"title\":\"SwolDAO community roundup vol. 2: Dream BIG ðŸš€\"},\"digest\":\"44o9l6Tc8fZyIPqIPX_Hh2A9bRypBKF8ablakw70QyY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x33D39De13329D53F668Ace2d387dAbDAdD002E58\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"oWG-pLdNiXB-XdSBqi9qGrP8NBPnX21O6Wc-NlyAJwE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"q3Hw6PAU4_WTrOns5x0G8t9Gptr-SCsSzG7Jd8YpwbY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"qCD9pTh4oNAOebPiYXoGIsWgy6iTRJ9rr_DCSW2BHQ4Q69SAfXVZXMNOGEFQR8OgMVsYjvXdWA-WN8UoLJRAGw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc554143b82de77b0b9439ef11762748ad377ab776f1d51743743c1f277fa7872537013f4ab57e97abf29173558437af6aafa7f7565dd010f2e9daf6ca307a5b21b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"oWG-pLdNiXB-XdSBqi9qGrP8NBPnX21O6Wc-NlyAJwE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"q3Hw6PAU4_WTrOns5x0G8t9Gptr-SCsSzG7Jd8YpwbY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"pSZBZMpJ3JT82-0br_7VKsp0ehva6f-VT8UbAj_XvfE\"}"
