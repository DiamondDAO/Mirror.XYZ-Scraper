"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Treat her as you would treat the Madonna. Do you hear?\\\"\\n\\nThe boatman grinned and took off his cap, and the boat glided away across the path of yellow light that was shed from the window of Frisio's.\\n\\nHermione leaned back against the white cushions. She was thankful to escape. She felt tired and confused. That dreadful music had distracted her, that--and something else, her tricked expectation. She knew now that she had been very foolish, perhaps even very fantastic. She had felt so sure that Emile had written in that book--what?\\n\\nAs the boat went softly on she asked herself exactly what she had expected to find written there, and she realized that her imagination had, as so often before, been galloping like a frightened horse with the reins upon its neck. And then she began to consider what he had written.\\n\\n\\\"La conscience, c'est la quantite de science innee que nous avons en nous.\\\"\\n\\nShe did not know the words. Were they his own or another's? And had he written them simply because they had chanced to come into his mind at the moment, or because they expressed some underthought or feeling that had surged up in him just then? She wished she knew.\\n\\nIt was a fine saying, she thought, but for the moment she was less interested in it than in Emile's mood, his mind, when he had written it. She realized now, on this calm of the sea, how absurd had been the thought that a man so subtle as Emile would flagrantly reveal a passing phase of his nature, a secret irritability, a jealousy, perhaps, or a sudden hatred in a sentence written for any eyes that chose to see. But he might covertly reveal himself to one who understood him well.\\n\\nShe sat still, trying to match her subtlety against his.\\n\\nFrom the shore came sounds of changing music, low down or falling to them from the illuminated heights where people were making merry in the night. Now and then a boat passed them. In one, young men were singing, and interrupting their song to shout with laughter. Here and there a fisherman's torch glided like a great fire-fly above the oily darkness of the sea. The distant trees of the gardens climbing up the hill made an ebony blackness beneath the stars, a blackness that suggested impenetrable beauty that lay deep down with hidden face. And the lights dispersed among them, gaining significance by their solitude, seemed to summon adventurous or romantic spirits to come to them by secret paths and learn their revelation. Over the sea lay a delicate warmth, not tropical, not enervating, but softly inspiring. And beyond the circling lamps of Naples Vesuvius lit up the firmament with a torrent of rose-colored fire that glowed and died, and glowed again, constantly as beats a heart.\\n\\nAnd to Hermione came a melancholy devoid of all violence, soft almost as the warmth upon this sea, quite as the resignation of the fatalistic East. She felt herself for a moment such a tiny, dark thing caught in the meshes of the great net of the Universe, this Universe that she could never understand. What could she do? She must just sink down upon the breast of this mystery, let it take her, hold her, do with her what it would.\\n\\nHer subtlety against Emile's! She smiled to herself in the dark. What a combat of midgets! She seemed to see two marionettes battling in the desert.\\n\\nAnd yet--and yet! She remembered a saying of Flaubert's, that man is like a nomad journeying on a camel through the desert; and he is the nomad, and the camel--and the desert.\\n\\nHow true that was, for even now, as she felt herself to be nothing, she felt herself to be tremendous.\\n\\nShe heard the sound of oars from the darkness before them, and saw the dim outline of a boat, then the eyes of Emile looking straight into hers.\\n\\n\\\"Emile!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hermione!\\\"\\n\\nHis face was gone. But yielding to her impulse she made Andrea stop, and, turning round, saw that the other boat had also stopped a little way from hers. It began to back, and in a moment was level with them.\\n\\n\\\"Emile! How strange to meet you! Have--you haven't been to the island?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. I was tired. I have been working very hard. I dined quietly at Posilipo.\\\"\\n\\nHe did not ask her where she had been.\\n\\n\\\"Yes. I think you look tired,\\\" she said. He did not speak, and she added: \\\"I felt restless, so I took the tram from the Trattoria del Giardinetto as far as the Scoglio di Frisio, and am going back, as you see, by boat.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is exquisite on the sea to-night,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, exquisite, it makes one sad.\\\"\\n\\nShe remembered all she had been through that day, as she looked at his powerful face.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" he answered. \\\"It makes one sad.\\\"\\n\\nFor a moment she felt that they were in perfect sympathy, as they used to be. Their sadness, born of the dreaming hour, united them.\\n\\n\\\"Come soon to the island, dear Emile,\\\" she said, suddenly and with the impulsiveness that was part of her, forgetting all her jealousy and all her shadowy fears. \\\"I have missed you.\\\"\\n\\nHe noticed that she ruled out Vere in that sentence; but the warmth of her voice stirred warmth in him, and he answered:\\n\\n\\\"Let me come to-morrow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do--do!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In the morning, to lunch, and to spend a long day.\\\"\\n\\nSuddenly she remembered the Marchesino and the sound of his voice when he had spoken of his friend.\\n\\n\\\"Lunch?\\\" she said.\\n\\nInstantly he caught her hesitation, her dubiety.\\n\\n\\\"It isn't convenient, perhaps?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perfectly, only--only the Marchesino is coming.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To-morrow--To lunch?\\\"\\n\\nThe hardness of the Marchesino's voice was echoed now in the voice of Artois. There was antagonism between these men. Hermione realized it.\\n\\n\\\"Yes. I invited him this evening.\\\"\\n\\nThere was a slight pause. Then Artois said:\\n\\n\\\"I'll come some other day, Hermione. Well, my friend, au revoir, and bon voyage to the island.\\\"\\n\\nHis voice had suddenly become cold, and he signed to his boatman.\\n\\n\\\"Avanti!\\\"\\n\\nThe boat slipped away and was lost in the darkness.\\n\\nHermione had said nothing. Once again--why, she did not know--her friend had made her feel guilty.\\n\\nAndrea, the boatman, still paused. Now she saw him staring into her face, and she felt like a woman publicly deserted, almost humiliated.\\n\\n\\\"Avanti, Andrea!\\\" she said.\\n\\nHer voice trembled as she spoke.\\n\\nHe bent to his oars and rowed on.\\n\\nAnd man is the nomad, and the camel--and the desert.\\n\\nYes, she carried the desert within her, and she was wandering in it alone. She saw herself, a poor, starved, shrinking figure, travelling through a vast, a burning, a waterless expanse, with an iron sky above her, a brazen land beneath. She was in rags, barefoot, like the poorest nomad of them all.\\n\\nBut even the poorest nomad carries something.\\n\\nAgainst her breast, to her heart, she clasped--a memory--the sacred memory of him who had loved her, who had taken her to be his, who had given her himself.\\n\\nCHAPTER XX\\n\\nThat night when Hermione drew near to the island she saw the Saint's light shining, and remembered how, in the storm, she had longed for it --how, when she had seen it above the roaring sea, she had felt that it was a good omen. To-night it meant nothing to her. It was just a lamp lit, as a lamp might be lit in a street, to give illumination in darkness to any one who passed. She wondered why she had thought of it so strangely.\\n\\nGaspare met her at the landing. She noticed at once a suppressed excitement in his manner. He looked at Andrea keenly and suspiciously.\\n\\n\\\"How late you are, Signora!\\\"\\n\\nHe put out his strong arm to help her to the land.\\n\\n\\\"Am I, Gaspare? Yes, I suppose I am--you ought all to be in bed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should not go to bed while you were out, Signora.\\\"\\n\\nAgain she linked Gaspare with her memory, saw the nomad not quite alone on the journey.\\n\\n\\\"I know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have you been to Naples, Signora?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No--only to--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To Mergellina?\\\"\\n\\nHe interrupted her almost sharply.\\n\\n\\\"No, to the Scoglio di Frisio. Pay the boatman this, Gaspare. Good- night, Andrea.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good-night, Signora.\\\"\\n\\nGaspare handed the man his money, and at once the boat set out on its return to Posilipo.\\n\\nHermione stood at the water's edge watching its departure. It passed below the Saint, and the gleam of his light fell upon it for a moment. In the gleam the black figure of Andrea was visible stooping to the water. He was making the fishermen's sign of the Cross. The cross on Peppina's face--was it an enemy of the Cross that carried with it San Francesco's blessing? Vere's imagination! She turned to go up to the house.\\n\\n\\\"Is the Signorina in bed yet, Gaspare?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, Signora.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where is she? Still out?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signora.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did she think I was lost?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Signora, the Signorina is on the cliff with Ruffo.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"With Ruffo?\\\"\\n\\nThey were going up the steps.\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signora. We have all been together.\\\"\\n\\nHermione guessed that Gaspare had been playing chaperone, and loved him for it.\\n\\n\\\"And you heard the boat coming from the cliff?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I saw it pass under the Saint's light, Signora. I did not hear it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, but it might have been a fisherman's boat.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signora. And it might have been your boat.\\\"\\n\\nThe logic of this faithful watcher was unanswerable. They came up to the house.\\n\\n\\\"I think I'll go and see Ruffo,\\\" said Hermione.\\n\\nShe was close to the door of the house, Gaspare stood immediately before her. He did not move now, but he said:\\n\\n\\\"I can go and tell the Signorina you are here, Signora. She will come at once.\\\"\\n\\nAgain Hermione noticed a curious, almost dogged, excitement in his manner. It recalled to her a night of years ago when he had stood on a terrace beside her in the darkness and had said: \\\"I will go down to the sea. Signora, let me go down to the sea!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There's nothing the matter, is there, Gaspare?\\\" she said, quickly. \\\"Nothing wrong?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Signora, of course not! What should there be?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will fetch the Signorina.\\\"\\n\\nOn that night, years ago, she had battled with Gaspare. He had been forced to yield to her. Now she yielded to him.\\n\\n\\\"Very well,\\\" she answered. \\\"Go and tell the Signorina I am here.\\\"\\n\\nShe turned and went into the house and up to the sitting-room. Vere did not come immediately. To her mother it seemed as if she was a very long time coming; but at last her light step fell on the stairs, and she entered quickly.\\n\\n\\\"Madre! How late you are! Where have you been?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Am I late? I dined at the little restaurant at the top of the hill where the tram passes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There? But you haven't been there all this time?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. Afterwards I took the tram to Posilipo and came home by boat. And what have you been doing?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, all sorts of things--what I always do. Just now I've been with Ruffo.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Gaspare told me he was here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. We've been having a talk.\\\"\\n\\nHermione waited for Vere to say something more, but she was silent. She stood near the window looking out, and the expression on her face had become rather vague, as if her mind had gone on a journey.\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said the mother at last, \\\"and what does Ruffo say for himself, Vere?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ruffo? Oh, I don't know.\\\"\\n\\nShe paused, then added:\\n\\n\\\"I think he has rather a hard time, do you know, Madre?\\\"\\n\\nHermione had taken off her hat. She laid it on a table and sat down. She was feeling tired.\\n\\n\\\"But generally he looks so gay, so strong. Don't you remember that first day you saw him?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah--then!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course, when he had fever--\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1637314436,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"A rivederci, Signora! A demain!
