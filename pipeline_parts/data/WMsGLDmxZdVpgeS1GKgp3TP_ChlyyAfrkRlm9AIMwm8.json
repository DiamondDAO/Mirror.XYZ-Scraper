"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## What is Trader Joe?\\n\\n[Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/#/home) is a one-stop AMM decentralized trading platform on the Avalanche network. Trader Joe combines DEX services with DeFi lending to offer leveraged trading. Trader Joe’s products are community driven which allows them to give fees collected from liquidation and swaps back to the users via the JOE/xJOE staking mechanism. JOE is a governance token that also rewards its holders with a share of exchange revenues.\\n\\n## What is Avalanche?\\n\\n[Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/) is an open-source, proof-of-stake smart contracts platform that allows developers to build decentralized applications. Avalanche offers near-instant transaction finality and uses the native AVAX token to pay for gas and secure the network by staking.\\n\\n## What is an AMM/CFMM?\\n\\nCFMMs are a classification of AMMs which have been applied to crypto DeFi markets. CFMMs were pioneered by several projects in the crypto community to create decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for digital asset trading and based on a mathematical function establishing a pre-defined set of prices based on the assets held in a liquidity pool. Whereas a traditional order book-based exchanges (OBs/CLOBs), traders trade against a specific counter-party.\\n\\n## Why Deposit Liquidity in Trader Joe?\\n\\nSome investors/traders may want to Provide Liquidity (LP) in an AMM style DEX for various reasons. One popular reason is the ability to earn rewards in the native governance token of the platform. This reward structure can be used to offset a concept known as [impermanent loss (IL)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/impermanent-loss) which is when someone’s assets in a pool lose relative value when the price of one asset changes dramatically against the other asset. This concept is often referred to as [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-yield-farming) and can be done under the “Farm” tab on [Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/#/farm). \\n\\n## A step-by-step guide on how to lend assets on Trader Joe:\\n\\n* Visit https://traderjoexyz.com and connect your wallet.\\n\\n![Trader Joe Connect Wallet Pop Up](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/efB_GbeDHGtEh7AgCYgGX.png?height=1474&width=2618)\\n\\n* If your wallet is not on the Avalanche Network, a window will prompt you to switch to the network.
