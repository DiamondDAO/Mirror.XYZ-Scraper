"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Well, that was a harsh weekend. I had a couple K liquidated because of reckless use of leverage. But I'm learning... I hope everybody is okay and that you treat this as a lesson. And for those of you that went shopping - congrats on snatching some bargains!\\n\\n\\nCalls for a slow bleed, end of cycle, double top and impending bear market will no doubt be causing a lot of people to sell and cut their losses. Conviction in the space has been rocked by events like this and many will lose interest or get out of the game.\\nThis is why I think it’s important to share the overall macro picture, to help you gain perspective and build that conviction. \\n\\nThe reasons you're here are the same, so don’t be scared off by a little volatility.\\n\\n## **WHAT CAUSED THIS?**\\n\\nHuge amounts of leverage can be seen through On-chain analytics. Bullish sentiment galore, models saying pump before xmas, buy the dip, buy the dip. Over-leverage is an obvious cause of the cascading liquidations and crazy price volatility, however there's another reason that many are not thinking of. \\n\\nThere are new players in the game. Institutions, hedge funds, private offices - it's not just retail folk anymore. \\n\\n* these types of players need to readjust their portfolios as crypto has gone from the allocated 5%, up to 20% of their portfolio.\\n* It's also the time for yearly bonuses and so many will be locking in their profits and making their P&L realised. \\n* It’s also Tax time in the US. There will be some HUGE tax bills they need to pay off. This is all hindsight and is easy to attribute yesterdays move to a number of things when looking back.\\n\\n  It's possible the pullback was due to Omicron, Fed announcing inflation fears/tapering, whales coordinating, or simply overleveraged traders getting liquidated into shallow order books. All of the above makes this seem like it was inevitable.\\n\\n## SO WHERE FROM HERE?\\n\\nSlow bleed? \\n\\nBear market? \\n\\nI don’t think so. \\n\\nCome Jan 1. the big players will have settled bills, P&L will be reset and bonuses paid out. They are going to be looking to take on risk, and crypto is inarguably the biggest return out there. \\n\\nWhile every asset class has performed this year - property, stocks etc. - I believe none have actually done very well when you take into account the expansion of the Feds Balance sheet - ie. The huge increase in money supply and govt. debt. Assets like your stocks or your house may indeed go up in USD - but as the USD supply has increased so dramatically, you're making the denominator (USD) worth less. This makes the assets only *seemingly* increase in value. \\n\\nNot the case. What’s really happening is you're debasing the denominator. Think fractions. If you measure everything in terms of USD(as the denominator) - and now there's a whole bunch more USD(money printing)- then everything gets revalued in relation to the new amount of USD. \\n\\n‘Yay! Our house has doubled in value!!!’\\n\\nNo. There's just a whole bunch more money going around. The lack of ACTUAL returns in other assets makes me believe we will see a huge amount of institutions take on risk and bet on BTC and other baskets of crypto. The % gains are just too much to ignore and everyone needs to be ahead of inflation this coming year.\\n\\n> ## Noone wants to be first. But NOONE wants to be last.\\n\\nThis is why my outlook is that December will remain choppy/uninteresting, maybe head back to the region of 55-65k. But come Jan/Feb - there’s going to be a lot of money looking for risk-on bets. My macro view is that the Fed is not going to cease money printing as it has been very effective strategy thus far. \\n\\nEven with Jpow’s admission of persistent inflation and talks of earlier than expected tapering of asset purchases(money printing) - they will continue the fiscal stimulus for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nThey are in a hard place where they can't raise rates as the debt burden is too high and they would risk defaulting - cant happen. The only thing left to do is print.\\n\\n## **WHY ARE YOU IN CRYPTO?**\\n\\nTime for a review of why you are involved in this space.\\n\\nBlockchain and tokenisation - together these allow for the mass coordination and aligning of incentives of humans like never before in history. This is changing the social and economic framework we all operate under, and it’s going to continue to grow for the next decade. \\n\\nWe're only at 2.5T. Comparative asset classes are 50-100x this. \\n\\nThis is a revolutionary asset class and tokenisation is huge. We can all OWN a piece of the network. Networks go up in value relative to the number of people and the number of connections. BTC is literally just a big network - and anybody can own a tiny fraction of it! ETH is a Network that can run computer code and therefore complicated programs. \\n\\nSocial tokens will allow us to invest in CULTURE and COMMUNITIES. We will have a unique digital identity that allows us to exist on the Internet and OWN the things we produce and the things we buy. We will have control over our DATA and will be able to sell it - not have it sneakily harvested and sold by the platforms we use. \\n\\nWe are in the process of rapidly innovating and rebuilding our legacy systems. Almost everything will be put on blockchain and/or be tokenised in some dimension.\\n\\nThere is no way to stop this. Too much money. Too many votes. Too much potential. More bullish than ever.\",\"timestamp\":1638747085,\"title\":\"Conviction in Crypto - Exploring the future ahead.\"},\"digest\":\"d6Qei3FJaPxazAAyLlsu1WlVlys7YJe6l56w2_l07WQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3c6f739fC6153446eC6Ca71bc483cAF1F59dC70a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"25jR3lA0EAmPQqdlL6YfL0f5xpebzXRWCyVs8hARnew\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ulM16VnK20UuJCR9_t1g76iirkQdVT-h3lm_xotZQac\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ZCdfX3kI2kKgY1qzYogiHp9wqATQU-_8tQpO_IYEv93-iamwu9KdFIad6UhEDR_X3F_uFfil1vAcw66v_h2cVw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd7575e12b09cf828bbf1949d0fd295ba1a0ff19ad99b34cc7ac7361aa95a44f27e75a7ae33b7a7af46702bbcd24e0ffb9cd17d2cb659bd8d76c53153277dd4cb1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"25jR3lA0EAmPQqdlL6YfL0f5xpebzXRWCyVs8hARnew\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ulM16VnK20UuJCR9_t1g76iirkQdVT-h3lm_xotZQac\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"d6Qei3FJaPxazAAyLlsu1WlVlys7YJe6l56w2_l07WQ\"}"
