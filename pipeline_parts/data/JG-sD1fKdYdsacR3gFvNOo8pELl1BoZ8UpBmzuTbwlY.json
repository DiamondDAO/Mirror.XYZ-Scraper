"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I hold the belief that everyone is living a life path that guarded by the destiny. But also I think that all of us should work hard for our own lives. These two thoughts are totally different which makes me myself confused a lot of time. Today, I found something that may combine them.\\n\\nEveryone\\\\`s life in paticular time just likes a point on a line，in fact each point has 360 degrees to choose which line his life what to be.

On the other hand, if you has strong desire to choose a way other than destiny, you will have a lot of things to struggle with, from both outside and inside.\\n\\nAs we all know, it needs two coordinates for a point to choose one direction.
