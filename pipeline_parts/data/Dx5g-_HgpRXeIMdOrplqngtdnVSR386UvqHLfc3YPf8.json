"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I’ve been hearing the term Metaverse for at least twenty years and I have always struggled with it. As I told my colleagues last week “I like the real world, I don’t want to live in a video game.”\\n\\nMy colleagues explained to me that I am thinking about it incorrectly. They said that as digitally mediated experiences have become a more important part of our everyday lives, we are already living in the metaverse.\\n\\nI’ve started thinking about it that way and it has helped me to be more enthusiastic about these digitally mediated experiences.\\n\\nI read this tweet stream yesterday and I found it very helpful in this new understanding I am developing.\\n\\n> Hot take: Everyone is wrong about the Metaverse.\\n>\\n> here's my 3 part theory..\\n>\\n> — Shaan Puri (@ShaanVP) [October 29, 2021](https://twitter.com/ShaanVP/status/1454151237650112512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\\n\\nBut then I was passing by the [Bright Moments NFT Gallery in Soho](https://goo.gl/maps/pSpFgiUiabPf6TUx7) yesterday and there was literally a line around the block to get into the Bored Apes Yacht Club event. It seemed like there were thousands of Bored Apes NFT owners standing in line for hours to be able to hang out together in person. I texted my colleagues “I guess this metaverse thing is overrated”.\\n\\nThat’s mostly me amusing myself.\\n\\nBut it does suggest to me that hanging out together online is still not quite as much fun as hanging out together in person.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1635781320,\"title\":\"The Metaverse\",\"publication\":\"avc\"},\"digest\":\"LgECTv6I4DkqmwaE6ij3mFQmrdKZ1o8XWcVK_qrSBBg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"G4zYfkpcj2_OViGlk8zlUX3DHdayO3TJ-781S3eud_k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DhednLO2HMS8h7FkGMTpgGhPiw2cbLGmh2l7x17zYJY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"uwTdU_mDdO_JlRzUm8BR5YPt7S-xiw-34_qAugfWC5m3HYI7L1jfsQqMYFQLLdJg9ZbBTPDJmwdR9OlfDAi-6Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xecabbe68f396aae1427f5971898f7fe2b013fa130d216dcf250eba219792d3653aecc90eb45518d05b73702fbd93ee558b056569727c256e9cd3f5df50e2cbff1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"G4zYfkpcj2_OViGlk8zlUX3DHdayO3TJ-781S3eud_k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DhednLO2HMS8h7FkGMTpgGhPiw2cbLGmh2l7x17zYJY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"LgECTv6I4DkqmwaE6ij3mFQmrdKZ1o8XWcVK_qrSBBg\"}"
