"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Huma Abedin, a longtime close aide to Hillary Clinton, has written in a new book that [she was sexually assaulted by a US senator](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/26/huma-abedin-sexual-assault-us-senator-book-memoir), an incident she says she “buried” until allegations against the supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh triggered her memory years later.\\n\\nAbedin makes the shocking claim in a memoir, Both/And: A Life in Many Worlds, which will be published next week. She writes that after a dinner attended by some senators and their aides, a senator invited her into his apartment for coffee.\\n\\n“Then, in an instant, it all changed. He plopped down to my right, put his left arm around my shoulder, and kissed me, pushing his tongue into my mouth, pressing me back on the sofa,” she describes. “I was so utterly shocked, I pushed him away.”\\n\\nAbedin writes that the senator seemed surprised, apologized and said he had “misread” her “all this time”. She considered how to leave “without this ending badly”, she writes, and apologised and left.\\n\\n* **What happened after?** Abedin writes that she stayed friendly with the senator and soon “buried the incident”, which she wanted to forget, succeeding in erasing it from her mind “entirely”.\\n* **Who was the senator?** Abedin does not name the senator or his party or give any other clues as to his identity.\\n* **Why is this coming out now?** Abedin’s memory of her experience on the unnamed senator’s couch, she writes, was triggered when she read about Christine Blasey Ford “being accused of ‘conveniently’ remembering” her alleged assault by Kavanaugh.\\n\\n## Pair arrested over death of child found in Texas apartment with siblings\\n\\nThree children were found apparently abandoned in an apartment in Houston along with a body believed to be their brother, which had been in the unit with them for a year, police said.

The mother, Gloria Y Williams, 36, was charged with felony injury to a child by omission, failure to provide medical care and failure to provide adequate supervision, authorities said.\\n\\nThe Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences in Houston, which conducts all autopsies in the county, listed the child’s primary cause of death as homicidal violence with multiple blunt force injuries.\\n\\n* **What is the background to this?** One of the surviving siblings, a 15-year-old, called the sheriff’s department on Sunday and told authorities that his nine-year-old brother had died a year ago and the body was in the apartment, according to the law enforcement agency.\\n* **How did the other children survive?** Their apartment did not have any power and a neighbor had helped the children by charging a cellphone and buying them food, police said. It appeared that the surviving children were “fending for each other”, with the oldest sibling caring for the younger two.\\n\\n## These Trump fans were at the Capitol on 6 January. Now they are running for office\\n\\nTeddy Daniels, candidate for US Congress, speaks at the third Annual Rod of Iron freedom festival this month.

He is running for congress in Pennsylvania and is one of the more sophisticated candidates, having appeared on Fox News and met Trump.\\n* In New York, **Tina Forte** is running an extremely long-shot bid to unseat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A [Snopes investigation](https://www.snopes.com/news/2021/08/25/tina-forte-capitol-riot/) found that Forte attended the Capitol riot, where she [livestreamed videos](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=673031746709618) from outside.\\n* **Derrick Van Orden**, from Wisconsin, has been [endorsed](https://www.stevenspointjournal.com/story/news/politics/2021/08/12/trump-endorses-van-orden-2022-wisconsin-3rd-congressional-race/8109129002/) by Trump and the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy. He was also at the Capitol on 6 January, and has been called an “insurrectionist” by the Democratic congressional campaign committee.\\n* In New Hampshire, **Jason Riddle** is running for the state’s second congressional district, despite [pleading guilty](https://www.unionleader.com/news/crime/second-jan-6-nh-insurrection-defendant-says-he-will-plead-guilty/article_8fac5b6b-bf51-515a-8b21-d2611bb6ae8a.html) in September to five charges arising from him entering the Capitol during the riot. Once in the Capitol, Riddle took – and drank from – a bottle of wine he found in a lawmaker’s office.\\n\\n## Weather whiplash: California’s historic downpour interrupts historic drought\\n\\nRecent storms raised Lake Oroville more than 16ft, according to the California Department of Water Resources. Photograph: Noah Berger/AP\\n\\nIn two days the dramatic scenes of dried landscapes and wildfires that have defined California’s summer were replaced with [surging rivers](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/26/weather-whiplash-historic-downpour-interrupts-historic-drought), floods and mudflows as a historic rainstorm – deemed a category 5 atmospheric river – pummeled the state.\\n\\nFor scientists, the storm – though shocking in its magnitude – was not a surprise. It has been clear that the climate crisis would intensify the extremes between wet and dry seasons, but many wonder whether this weather whiplash is a preview of catastrophes to come.\\n\\nSteven Ostoja, the director of the US Department of Agriculture’s California Climate Hub, said that even though climate scientists expected shifts of this intensity, it was nonetheless startling to witness. “All of a sudden it’s just like, my God. I have never seen it rain this hard outside of being in the Belizean rainforest,” he said.\\n\\n* **How bad was the drought?** Days before the storm, the state’s capital of Sacramento, where Ostoja is based, set a record of more than 200 days without measurable rain.\\n* **Is the rain good news?** It has brought some gains, adding a few percentage points to the volume of water in lakes and reservoirs and extinguishing wildfires that have been ravaging the state.\\n* **Should we be concerned?** The state is widening its weather extremes, experiencing stronger storms interspersed with intense dry spells. Historic droughts are being followed by the wettest years on record. So, yes.\\n\\n## In other news…\",\"timestamp\":1635338644,\"title\":\"First Thing: Hillary Clinton aide describes sexual assault by a senator\"},\"digest\":\"AjaEyw_28RMN-4B72H8BCkEkoRNFyoG79dg6cOAkqHE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6140E4c4b50f53D4a2621DF028b75Ce94f88De5b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"I4IpWXmdlKoRm2v7b3OWpZ-JFg3QFPz2tBeTxuu36o8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"HyQF_Y6PXyG83gyOZapihHD2vp4r2j6MCH5FMWenfqs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"HfDUROaWy0qZLWSgrGnU9LiccGf8bh5D1E34bkPExZul8gv52V1WMUkH5LSMji-QQraHF6BZyvGeKGZjkZApKg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2ec2bc92053f12547bae70ea3aebbe22d2a5a9a22774b967cf283837b3309e88505cc99ad8b13547e284804fe3fb1eff28fcb038b2c6270f719f80ebc0bd519e1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"I4IpWXmdlKoRm2v7b3OWpZ-JFg3QFPz2tBeTxuu36o8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"HyQF_Y6PXyG83gyOZapihHD2vp4r2j6MCH5FMWenfqs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"AjaEyw_28RMN-4B72H8BCkEkoRNFyoG79dg6cOAkqHE\"}"
