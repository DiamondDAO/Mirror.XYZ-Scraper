"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**If I go to your social and see 10,000 followers and 4 likes on your latest post with no comments or RTs, then I’m out. I’m not joining your discord, I’m not checking out your roadmap. I’m not even going to look at the rest of your art, and you can forget about me checking your utility. You’re lying to me and I just met your brand. It’s hurting me, and it’s definitely hurting you. If you’re trying to build an active community, you cannot do it dishonestly. There’s no shortcuts.**\\n\\n**A few tips:**\\n\\n**STOP BUYING FOLLOWERS, on ANY platform. It destroys your credibility, and it destroys any chance of the algorithm actually learning who your followers are. Hashtags are not going to be able to overcome the weight of 10k fake followers.** \\n\\n**BE MORE TRANSPARENT. No one cares if you don’t have a big name. We all know Web 3.0 is on its way, and with that, consumers want more control of what they are purchasing, and who they are purchasing from. They want to know who they are supporting. You can sell ice to an eskimo if they like you enough. Show your personality, be active in your own discord, give hot takes on newsworthy subjects. Let people engage with you.**\\n\\n**COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT. This doesn’t mean setup a discord, crown a few mods, and then do other things. People want to hear from you, they want to feel heard, they want to bounce ideas back and forth. If you are not good at this, hire a dedicated community manager to be the voice of your brand and let them connect on the one-to-one level. But don’t just give them a title. Give them tools to work with--empower them to have giveaways and other benefits**\\n\\n**One last this, and consider this a public service announcement:**\\n\\n**Aesthetic instagram feeds are outdated. Content is king. It’s better to push 2 posts a day about relevant topics, like news, NFT education, etc. than to constantly push a product. A good rule of thumb is one in every five posts should be something personal about the founders, two posts of every five should be evergreen content (more on that later), and the last two posts can be your product. ‘**\\n\\n**P.S. It’s completely OK to delete the SPAM out of your comment section. It makes your IG look unmaintained.**\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1639948198,\"title\":\"You don't have to lie to build a community\"},\"digest\":\"uHrHjQ7mhQEscUhjNPOfMe99Chlp6sfbGWyxVhFDrYI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9d4979cD1861a73c62a6DCAF698f7b812318cf29\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"63SHgK44TNoO-BYt8tjsbe30-XITiaJXa7-2X7FfyBY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ELcQIoxiMSxD7qXjwFzp1cuuaNCNYyDzTNqaVeTeS-s\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"bNEJLHDBqgthdMW4xyTW-ayWPSF1pftvE4UBmYVuZTba_MYmjmlgq94XzE356cx2Mw9YK6I5KIhiL9mjddrCbQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1b6fbae92631eb4952582c6ed50e00f8c0fb5e0161ed3f753dc8d3bc133e5b87519701803ee3090acae335a284ebe839575e304bff05623b63095ef20bdbffff1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"63SHgK44TNoO-BYt8tjsbe30-XITiaJXa7-2X7FfyBY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ELcQIoxiMSxD7qXjwFzp1cuuaNCNYyDzTNqaVeTeS-s\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"P8CJ4_loYNngCPhW9KYNWMxrfTbXbJksZAaQOgBHP2s\"}"
