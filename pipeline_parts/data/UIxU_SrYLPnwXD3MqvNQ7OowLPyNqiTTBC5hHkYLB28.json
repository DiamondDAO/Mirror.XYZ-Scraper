"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"the decoration you obtained in 1819; it seems the fashion nowadays not\\n\\nto wear orders.\\\"\\n\\nMistigris and the pretended Schinner blushed to their ears.\\n\\n\\\"Well, with me,\\\" said the artist, \\\"the case is different. It isn't on\\n\\naccount of fashion; but I don't want to be recognized. Have the\\n\\ngoodness not to betray me, monsieur; I am supposed to be a little\\n\\npainter of no consequence,--a mere decorator. I'm on may way to a\\n\\nchateau where I mustn't rouse the slightest suspicion.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah! I see,\\\" said the count, \\\"some intrigue,--a love affair! Youth is\\n\\nhappy!\\\"\\n\\nOscar, who was writhing in his skin at being a nobody and having\\n\\nnothing to say, gazed at Colonel Czerni-Georges and at the famous\\n\\npainter Schinner, and wondered how he could transform himself into\\n\\nsomebody. But a youth of nineteen, kept at home all his life, and\\n\\ngoing for two weeks only into the country, what could he be, or do, or\\n\\nsay? However, the Alicante had got into his head, and his vanity was\\n\\nboiling in his veins; so when the famous Schinner allowed a romantic\\n\\nadventure to be guessed at in which the danger seemed as great as the\\n\\npleasure, he fastened his eyes, sparkling with wrath and envy, upon\\n\\nthat hero.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said the count, with a credulous air, \\\"a man must love a woman\\n\\nwell to make such sacrifices.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What sacrifices?\\\" demanded Mistigris.\\n\\n\\\"Don't you know, my little friend, that a ceiling painted by so great\\n\\na master as yours is worth its weight in gold?\\\" replied the count. \\\"If\\n\\nthe civil list paid you, as it did, thirty thousand francs for each of\\n\\nthose rooms in the Louvre,\\\" he continued, addressing Schinner, \\\"a\\n\\nbourgeois,--as you call us in the studios--ought certainly to pay you\\n\\ntwenty thousand. Whereas, if you go to this chateau as a humble\\n\\ndecorator, you will not get two thousand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The money is not the greatest loss,\\\" said Mistigris. \\\"The work is\\n\\nsure to be a masterpiece, but he can't sign it, you know, for fear of\\n\\ncompromising HER.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah! I'd return all my crosses to the sovereigns who gave them to me\\n\\nfor the devotion that youth can win,\\\" said the count.\\n\\n\\\"That's just it!\\\" said Mistigris, \\\"when one's young, one's loved;\\n\\nplenty of love, plenty of women; but they do say: 'Where there's wife,\\n\\nthere's mope.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What does Madame Schinner say to all this?\\\" pursued the count; \\\"for I\\n\\nbelieve you married, out of love, the beautiful Adelaide de Rouville,\\n\\nthe protegee of old Admiral de Kergarouet; who, by the bye, obtained\\n\\nfor you the order for the Louvre ceilings through his nephew, the\\n\\nComte de Fontaine.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A great painter is never married when he travels,\\\" said Mistigris.\\n\\n\\\"So that's the morality of studios, is it?\\\" cried the count, with an\\n\\nair of great simplicity.\\n\\n\\\"Is the morality of courts where you got those decorations of yours\\n\\nany better?\\\" said Schinner, recovering his self-possession, upset for\\n\\nthe moment by finding out how much the count knew of Schinner's life\\n\\nas an artist.\\n\\n\\\"I never asked for any of my orders,\\\" said the count. \\\"I believe I\\n\\nhave loyally earned them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"'A fair yield and no flavor,'\\\" said Mistigris.\\n\\nThe count was resolved not to betray himself; he assumed an air of\\n\\ngood-humored interest in the country, and looked up the valley of\\n\\nGroslay as the coucou took the road to Saint-Brice, leaving that to\\n\\nChantilly on the right.\\n\\n\\\"Is Rome as fine as they say it is?\\\" said Georges, addressing the\\n\\ngreat painter.\\n\\n\\\"Rome is fine only to those who love it; a man must have a passion for\\n\\nit to enjoy it. As a city, I prefer Venice,--though I just missed\\n\\nbeing murdered there.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Faith, yes!\\\" cried Mistigris; \\\"if it hadn't been for me you'd have\\n\\nbeen gobbled up. It was that mischief-making tom-fool, Lord Byron, who\\n\\ngot you into the scrape. Oh! wasn't he raging, that buffoon of an\\n\\nEnglishman?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hush!\\\" said Schinner. \\\"I don't want my affair with Lord Byron talked\\n\\nabout.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you must own, all the same, that you were glad enough I knew how\\n\\nto box,\\\" said Mistigris.\\n\\nFrom time to time, Pierrotin exchanged sly glances with the count,\\n\\nwhich might have made less inexperienced persons than the five other\\n\\ntravellers uneasy.\\n\\n\\\"Lords, pachas, and thirty-thousand-franc ceilings!\\\" he cried. \\\"I seem\\n\\nto be driving sovereigns. What pourboires I'll get!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And all the places paid for!\\\" said Mistigris, slyly.\\n\\n\\\"It is a lucky day for me,\\\" continued Pierrotin; \\\"for you know, Pere\\n\\nLeger, about my beautiful new coach on which I have paid an advance of\\n\\ntwo thousand francs? Well, those dogs of carriage-builders, to whom I\\n\\nhave to pay two thousand five hundred francs more, won't take fifteen\\n\\nhundred down, and my note for a thousand for two months! Those\\n\\nvultures want it all. Who ever heard of being so stiff with a man in\\n\\nbusiness these eight years, and the father of a family?--making me run\\n\\nthe risk of losing everything, carriage and money too, if I can't find\\n\\nbefore to-morrow night that miserable last thousand! Hue, Bichette!\\n\\nThey won't play that trick on the great coach offices, I'll warrant\\n\\nyou.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, that's it,\\\" said the rapin; \\\"'your money or your strife.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, you have only eight hundred now to get,\\\" remarked the count,\\n\\nwho considered this moan, addressed to Pere Leger, a sort of letter of\\n\\ncredit drawn upon himself.\\n\\n\\\"True,\\\" said Pierrotin. \\\"Xi! xi! Rougeot!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You must have seen many fine ceilings in Venice,\\\" resumed the count,\\n\\naddressing Schinner.\\n\\n\\\"I was too much in love to take any notice of what seemed to me then\\n\\nmere trifles,\\\" replied Schinner. \\\"But I was soon cured of that folly,\\n\\nfor it was in the Venetian states--in Dalmatia--that I received a\\n\\ncruel lesson.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Can it be told?\\\" asked Georges. \\\"I know Dalmatia very well.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, if you have been there, you know that all the people at that\\n\\nend of the Adriatic are pirates, rovers, corsairs retired from\\n\\nbusiness, as they haven't been hanged--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Uscoques,\\\" said Georges.\\n\\nHearing the right name given, the count, who had been sent by Napoleon\\n\\non one occasion to the Illyrian provinces, turned his head and looked\\n\\nat Georges, so surprised was he.\\n\\n\\\"The affair happened in that town where they make maraschino,\\\"\\n\\ncontinued Schinner, seeming to search for a name.\\n\\n\\\"Zara,\\\" said Georges. \\\"I've been there; it is on the coast.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are right,\\\" said the painter. \\\"I had gone there to look at the\\n\\ncountry, for I adore scenery. I've longed a score of times to paint\\n\\nlandscape, which no one, as I think, understands but Mistigris, who\\n\\nwill some day reproduce Hobbema, Ruysdael, Claude Lorrain, Poussin,\\n\\nand others.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But,\\\" exclaimed the count, \\\"if he reproduces one of them won't that\\n\\nbe enough?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you persist in interrupting, monsieur,\\\" said Oscar, \\\"we shall\\n\\nnever get on.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And Monsieur Schinner was not addressing himself to you in\\n\\nparticular,\\\" added Georges.\\n\\n\\\"'Tisn't polite to interrupt,\\\" said Mistigris, sententiously, \\\"but we\\n\\nall do it, and conversation would lose a great deal if we didn't\\n\\nscatter little condiments while exchanging our reflections. Therefore,\\n\\ncontinue, agreeable old gentleman, to lecture us, if you like. It is\\n\\ndone in the best society, and you know the proverb: 'we must 'owl with\\n\\nthe wolves.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I had heard marvellous things of Dalmatia,\\\" resumed Schinner, \\\"so I\\n\\nwent there, leaving Mistigris in Venice at an inn--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"'Locanda,'\\\" interposed Mistigris; \\\"keep to the local color.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Zara is what is called a country town--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Georges; \\\"but it is fortified.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Parbleu!\\\" said Schinner; \\\"the fortifications count for much in my\\n\\nadventure. At Zara there are a great many apothecaries. I lodged with\\n\\none. In foreign countries everybody makes a principal business of\\n\\nletting lodgings; all other trades are accessory. In the evening,\\n\\nlinen changed, I sat in my balcony. In the opposite balcony I saw a\\n\\nwoman; oh! such a woman! Greek,--THAT TELLS ALL! The most beautiful\\n\\ncreature in the town; almond eyes, lids that dropped like curtains,\\n\\nlashes like a paint-brush, a face with an oval to drive Raffaelle mad,\\n\\na skin of the most delicious coloring, tints well-blended, velvety!\\n\\nand hands, oh!--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They weren't made of butter like those of the David school,\\\" put in\",\"timestamp\":1637316192,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"I see, Monsieur Schinner,\\\" said the count, \\\"that you are not wearing\\n\"},\"digest\":\"7dhRCKpmYCcZzG42_7Skl-kAnExyUK_VWht3-OJqg_U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x368119602f169B8146fb749c112EF9CC81197C53\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7cc1NIsugsGc49-dKPhTV_wqjIpZ9rCgJvAM4raQe8E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"hqh-DCfkf-N6Eap0GVSoDLDz7JFUAgt4jIPk3HOiWqs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"CC9crPyO39UzWZHkp0RzKCdwaYv_Fr-_BsSfHiw-RNLQOvEay9KzUAjCoGgxuOuXRRN3Rshdf1NIP9SGj2n_OA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa410e8bfe743fe185754154c6985ff33bd77376c8f1018f9b67bb646a232d7d2362c474173f27231ee7d5822a33b04d4d30bb3df38479aecabbff0480ae1bd871c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7cc1NIsugsGc49-dKPhTV_wqjIpZ9rCgJvAM4raQe8E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"hqh-DCfkf-N6Eap0GVSoDLDz7JFUAgt4jIPk3HOiWqs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"7dhRCKpmYCcZzG42_7Skl-kAnExyUK_VWht3-OJqg_U\"}"
