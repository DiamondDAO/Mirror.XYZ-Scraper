"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"As a kid, I used to retreat to my room and wait till the guests left. I’d feel safe there, alone, knowing I won’t be seen or judged or invariably determined to be too different. Someone who just wasn’t quite right, someone who didn’t fit in. The last kid picked in gym class.\\n\\nLater, I learned how to act when in front of people. I got really good at it. I had an amazing coach. A leader and educator who taught me the virtues of kindness, patience, and compassion by example.\\n\\nI got really good at acting. So good that it became a part of who I am.\\n\\nThere is an idea of ‘computational irreducibility’ that goes something like:\\n\\nFor a sufficiently complex computation sequence there are no shortcuts to the final answer. The only way to get to the end of the computation is to actually do each step in the sequence.\\n\\nI think this is also true of some behavior. In order to be a confident public speaker (if that were one’s goal), a person without confidence must act confident. In learning how to act confident, one recreates the computational steps of being confident. Done often enough, the computational sequence forms an easily accessible neural pathway.\\n\\nActing becomes the default state, instead of an intentionally triggered state. Normally, one acts when on a stage.\\n\\nLet’s take a hypothetical actor and engage in a thought experiment. If an actor is *forced* onto a stage in front of the entire world, what will he do?\\n\\nAn actor *acts.*\\n\\nHis audience tells him no we don’t want acting! His audience is a massive sea: a packed auditorium of critics, judges, friends, and teachers.\\n\\nThe teachers and friends are of course who our actor will try to focus on. The friendly faces in the sea of unknowns.\\n\\nEver aware he is being watched, unable to turn off his awareness, unable to relax into himself, eager to please, an actor *acts*. He puts on a poor performance unworthy of his friends and teachers.\\n\\nTeachers who create incredible lesson plans, who take time to reach him & teach him, even when their schedules are packed. Those teachers, they care. That is why they’re teachers.\\n\\nPerformance finished, the actor tried to leave the stage and retreat into the safety of his room. But alas, the whole world has become a stage!\\n\\nHe will just work harder. He will also remember. He will remember his teachers and friends. He will be grateful, in his heart, for them.\",\"timestamp\":1641138258,\"title\":\"2021/01/02 Morning Meditation \"},\"digest\":\"mp4LUaDU3ud_cpcFHmYlzSO2yJ8myR8Nd5Fw1FiGW0A\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x616caD18642F45d3fa5FCaaD0a2d81764A9cBa84\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uENU8fWzJ5lAhtJFr5dpdlzKfoQCUuGFS9-eALUx6Ps\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Uk8woAgmnhB-xPOeFhtTMsr1E7DHeP7tAaR3ljk_5WA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"sTNliLBeBRqwc-OzZVmA3i1kQeOvdy5u0eXjRT6SC5VvF6OxZ5ELYnmI017qcjqRHkDYk1qxeVMZGOrqC6Uyjg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb5ff8c45804293fb8af83bbee88f753edf751a0405303035a2ebb1b452b42c46741262638014b9bedfdbced171f5b20607648ef1d4543c85d2b5f8fc911c374d1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uENU8fWzJ5lAhtJFr5dpdlzKfoQCUuGFS9-eALUx6Ps\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Uk8woAgmnhB-xPOeFhtTMsr1E7DHeP7tAaR3ljk_5WA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"mp4LUaDU3ud_cpcFHmYlzSO2yJ8myR8Nd5Fw1FiGW0A\"}"
