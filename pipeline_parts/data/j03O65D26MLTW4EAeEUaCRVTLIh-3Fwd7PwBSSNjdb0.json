"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Although the value of NFT is constantly being explored in the process of breaking the niche circle, low liquidity and the sharp drop in prices after hot speculation have made it difficult for the NFT ecosystem to sustainably develop.\\n\\nIn this regard, ENVELOP realizes the value-added of NFT by using the four elements of protocol (Protocol), oracle (Oracle), index (Index), and token (Token). With the help of ENVELOP's protocol (Protocol), users can create and configure their own unique NFTs on the platform, such as adding some cryptocurrencies, establishing a liquid asset pool, and adding a certain percentage of royalties, and then all of these can be packaged into one NFT , And then converted to platform tokens (Token); if you donâ€™t know how to price, Oracle will help users set the correct current price for NFT; the platform also provides index (Index) as a reference,\\n\\nIn other words, the protocol part protects users who purchase NFTs from the full depreciation of assets by creating collateral storage facilities. However, this part of the agreement only applies to on-chain activities.\\n\\nOracle has created a map of the origin, movement, freezing, and various transactions of the asset, and protects users by analyzing the on-chain and off-chain dynamics of the asset in the NFT. In addition, the oracle machine will also include the main participants related to the NFT into the inspection, such as: issuers (publishers), distributors (platforms, etc.), buyers, etc. In addition, the oracle machine also includes a scoring system for evaluating assets and an anti-fraud system. On the one hand, the system notifies holders of changes in the asset data embedded in the wNFT; on the other hand, the oracle machine is also used for buying, selling, leasing and The parties to the pledge transaction provided complete information.\\n\\nIndex aims to use wNFT to tokenize micro-indices such as any niche industry or market: the sum of wNFT in niche markets is classified as industry data; the sum of data in subdivisions is classified as market index. At the same time, the final index is not linked to any legal currency basket or encrypted assets. It is an objective indicator in the NFT field. The index created by ENVELOP to hedge the overall position of the NFT market is one of the first real-time indexes for NFT and related assets that integrate the decentralized market and the mortgage market.\\n\\nTokens can connect protocols, oracles, and indexes together, and circulate through the micro-DAO architecture. Everyone can pass ENVELOP's token NIFTSY (NIFTSY will be ID0 in Scalesap on October 21) Come to pledge (Pledge 2.0), and become a member of this type of DAO, and allocate expenditures and possible income according to the proportion of capital contributions.\",\"timestamp\":1634575789,\"title\":\"How to promote a virtuous circle of NFT ecology?\"},\"digest\":\"DMrJ-c6R8wwWkwzn0MOk8F6PYRK_xIhDOWDPSWt87vo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2a4dE29e5C00A28152D5113bed5A1BfbAAFA54d7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HYt7AFFtt3X0I6dUxrlbj1ZMMe2oFswWK3mT0gVD-nA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NlpF7Q9K1Qyu8nnGb6Oz_O5AKSV8ps9CpA_LXEdoT4U\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"0GnOzN0dUtsiGUvNwqIfrqCiuLUBHK7eD5THktCRtNyqQX0G88eh9oxkXWs-D0JVnVolZfPo09lzuKP748evkA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe1ce4eb859b2b1126597b135940db24b39d5ef31e2b4ab7108f1fce09c129154159d17d8e49cab58129642af9ca0584a54c6010a4609bb87f06107d0d907bbc61c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HYt7AFFtt3X0I6dUxrlbj1ZMMe2oFswWK3mT0gVD-nA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NlpF7Q9K1Qyu8nnGb6Oz_O5AKSV8ps9CpA_LXEdoT4U\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"DMrJ-c6R8wwWkwzn0MOk8F6PYRK_xIhDOWDPSWt87vo\"}"
