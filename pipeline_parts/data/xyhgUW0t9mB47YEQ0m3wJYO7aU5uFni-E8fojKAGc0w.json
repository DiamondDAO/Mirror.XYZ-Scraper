"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"> Don't read books, ***read clusters of books***.\\n\\nClusters transform your reading experience because:\\n\\n> 1. ***They give you an information edge***. Reading a single book on a topic will give you an edge over most who don't read. Reading more than one will give you an edge over most of those who read (and don't go much further than one).\\n\\n> 2. ***Clusters let you build a unique worldview***. Read-only one book and you've only seen one perspective. You have to see the topic through the author's eyes. Read 5 books and now you can suddenly compose your own complex view of the topic.\\n\\n> 3. ***Clusters compound the value of every individual book.*** A cluster lets you develop a unique set of the model of how to think about something. The more models you have, the more you can combine them and creates connections and links across pieces of knowledge.\\n\\nRather than impulsively buying the next book, choose the next mental tool you want to acquire. Choose your topic depending on how important is it for you to know about it, and how little you know about it. Then choose 5 books to read about it and start building that mental models armoury!\\n\\nAs an example here's my next cluster, about the world of Venture Capital:\\n\\n* *E-boys* by Randall E.
