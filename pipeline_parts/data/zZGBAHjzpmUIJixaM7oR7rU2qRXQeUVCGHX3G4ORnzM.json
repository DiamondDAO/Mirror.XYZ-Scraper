"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"What kind of people are suitable to be the boss? Teach you how do I use others to make money? The first type: I like to be the king of children since I was young, like to be the monitor, labor committee, and command\\n\\nOthers, who manage others, have developed a kind of nature. Seeing people can command others with perfection. Others didn't understand, so they just listened to him and went to work.\\n\\nThe second type: people with a strong sense of acting, President Reagan was born as an actor. Schwarzenegger was also an actor and became governor. In fact, many of our bosses in China, including some officials, are master actors. And I'm especially worried about everyone being confused unconsciously and willing to work with this kind of person.\\n\\nThe third type: people who like to brag, you can't be the boss if you don't know how to brag. You can also call it a picture cake, or you can call it a vision for the employees. For example, when you are in school, you want your little brother to mess with you, how do you play it? You said, who bullied you, I stabbed him to death by force. Blow every day, and the younger brother will pay the protection fee. When Ma Yun started his business, 18 people were crowded into one house. Ma Yun said that in the future, each person will own 50 houses. Huawei's Ren Zhengfei told everyone that in the future, everyone buys a bigger house and the balcony must be bigger. Why do you ask? Ren Zhengfei said, because I will earn a lot of money in the future, the money will have to be exposed to the balcony, otherwise it will be moldy. Being the boss is\\n\\nTo brag, to brag optimistically, in fact, entrepreneurs must be optimistic people. Bragging is to draw a pie, a vision, whatever you call it, you must be able to do this trick.\\n\\nThe fourth type: generous people. If you have the first three tricks, or three kinds of people, you will not do it. There is one last trick, generous. A stingy person cannot be the boss.\\n\\nShiyu Songjiang in the Water Margin is a generous person. He will give whatever others want, so he is the boss. The first leader of Liang Shan was called Wang Lun, a white-robed scholar, and he couldn't bear to give him anything else, so Lin Chong killed him.\\n\\nHow do you call it generous? For example, if you have a good bottle of wine, you can take it out for everyone to drink. In history, the famous Huo Qubing was appointed by Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty as a Li Yao at the age of 17. I say one thing. During the Battle of Hexi, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty specially sent a jar of fine wine from the capital. Huo Qubing did not enjoy it alone. Instead, he poured the wine into the spring water for the whole army and soldiers to drink. The soldiers were moved to tears. If the war is not fought, it will be victory. NS. Later, this spring was called Jiuquan, and the local name was also named after the spring.\\n\\nIn modern society, if you have a cigarette, if you can smoke one sip, others will mix with you. A deeper and generous performance is that if you make money, you will advertise that you have made money everywhere, and you will not hide it. Those who make a fortune in a muffled voice can't be the boss. You must learn to lead people around to listen to your instructions and work for you. When I am in my circle, I often share my income, and there will be many people who want to learn from me and let me take it. Some of my friends also said that they would gang up with me and don't want salary.\\n\\nOnce a friend asked me whether I was making money or not, I would show him my Alipay, show him my online banking, and show him my Tenpay. But I said, the money is not borrowed, it belongs to the company. I want to use it for my career. When others see it, they will say, \\\"How can you make so much.\\\" Let me fuck with you, or teach me.\\n\\nThen, I will ask him, what resources do you have and what will you do? Then he said, what I have and what I will do, absolutely obey the command.\\n\\nI will arrange him one thing and say, if you want to do it, what do you start to do\\n\\nWhat? If you don't do it well, I will tell you to fuck off. Generally, he said, I work hard and try not to shame you.\\n\\nOf course, if you deal with people who have a certain social status and have certain social resources. I will try to work with him on a project. As a person, I usually think about projects everywhere and have developed many prototypes. I will pick a project that I think is suitable for him, and then say, should we cooperate on this project. Make money, three or seven points, you seven and three, if you fail. Each bears 50% of the loss. If he says yes, I will say, I will leave the job to you. I vote first\\n\\nFor 50% of the money, we can sign a letter of intent immediately.\",\"timestamp\":1634795309,\"title\":\"What kind of people are suitable to be the boss\"},\"digest\":\"gjt16sg4HGqP0hGWs75u7lY8hbY8S-I-ZZCbtdmNpmc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"me_2sRO-zSLxHBScGcYtKMIpDCW-EvdS8a7wZju-cjJmHtxdvyNOGWwyye8jCRhHNRK4W5HZdl7LM0ZyPtg1ag\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"gjt16sg4HGqP0hGWs75u7lY8hbY8S-I-ZZCbtdmNpmc\"}"
