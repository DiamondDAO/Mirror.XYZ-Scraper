"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Then he lifted his head up with a jerk.\\n\\n\\\"Signora,\\\" he said, in a hard, uneven voice that betrayed the intensity of his excitement, \\\"I see how it is. I understand perfectly what is happening here. You think me bad. Well, I am like other men, and I am not ashamed of it--not a bit. I am natural. I live according to my nature, and I do not come from your north, but from Naples--from Naples.\\\" He threw out his arm, pointing at a window that looked towards the city. \\\"If it is bad to have the blood hot in one's veins and the fire hot in one's head and in one's heart--very well! I am bad. And I do not care. I do not care a bit! But you think me a stupid boy. And I am not that. And I will show you.\\\" He drew his fingers together, and bent towards her, slightly lowering his voice. \\\"From the first, from the very first moment, I have seen, I have understood all that is happening here. From the first I have understood all that was against me--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marchese--!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Signora, pardon me! You have spoken, the Signorina has spoken, and now it is for me to speak. It is my right. I come here with an honorable proposal, and therefore I say I have a right--\\\"\\n\\nHe put his fingers inside his shirt collar and pulled it fiercely out from his throat.\\n\\n\\\"E il vecchio!\\\" he exclaimed, with sudden passion. \\\"E il maledetto vecchio!\\\"\\n\\nHermione's face changed. There had been in it a firm look, a calmness of strength. But now, at his last words, the strength seemed to shrink. It dwindled, it faded out of her, leaving her not collapsed, but cowering, like a woman who crouches down in a corner to avoid a blow.\\n\\n\\\"It is he! It is he! He will not allow it, and he is master here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marchese--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I say he is master--he is master--he has always been master here!\\\"\\n\\nHe came a step towards Hermione, moving as a man sometimes moves instinctively when he is determined to make something absolutely clear to one who does not wish to understand.\\n\\n\\\"And you know it, and every one knows it--every one. When I was in the sea, when I saw the Signorina for the first time, I did not know who she was, where she lived; I did not know anything about her. I went to tell my friend about her--my friend, you understand, whom I trusted, to whom I told everything!--I went to him. I described the Signora, the Signorina, the boat to him. He knew who the ladies were; he knew directly. I saw it in his face, in his manner. But what did he say? That he did not know, that he knew nothing. I was not to come to the island. No one was to come to the island but he. So he meant. But I--I was sharper than he, I who am so stupid! I took him to fish by night. I brought him to the island. I made him introduce me to you, to the Signorina. That night I made him. You remember? Well, then--ever since that night all is changed between us. Ever since that night he is my enemy. Ever since that night he suspects me, he watches me, he hides from me, he hates me. Oh, he tries to conceal it. He is a hypocrite. But I, stupid as I am, I see it all. I see what he is, what he wants, I see all--all that is in his mind and heart. For this noble old man, so respected, with the white hairs and the great brain, what is he, what does he do? He goes at night to the Galleria. He consults with Maria Fortunata, she who is known to all Naples, she who is the aunt of that girl--that girl of the town and of the bad life, whom you have taken to be your servant here. You have taken her because he--he has told you to take her. He has put her here--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marchese!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I say he has put her here that the Signorina--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marchese, I forbid you to say that! It is not true.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is true! It is true! Perhaps you are blind, perhaps you see nothing. I do not know. But I know that I am not blind. I love, and I see. I see, I have always seen that he--Emilio--loves the Signorina, that he loves her madly, that he wishes, that he means to keep her for himself. Did he not hide with her in the cave, in the Grotto of Virgil, that night when I came to serenade her on the sea? Yes, he took her, and he hid her, because he loves her. He loves her, he an old man! And he thinks--and he means--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marchese--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He loves her; I say he loves her!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marchese, I must ask you to go!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I say--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marchese, I insist upon your going.\\\"\\n\\nShe opened the door. She was very pale, but she looked calm. The crouching woman had vanished. She was mistress of herself.\\n\\n\\\"Gaspare!\\\" she called, in a loud, sharp voice that betrayed the inner excitement her appearance did not show.\\n\\n\\\"Signora,\\\" vociferated the Marchesino, \\\"I say and I repeat--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Gaspare! Come here!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Signora!\\\" cried a voice from below.\\n\\nGaspare came running.\\n\\n\\\"The Signore Marchese is going, Gaspare. Go down with him to the boat, please.\\\"\\n\\nThe Marchesino grew scarlet. The hot blood rushed over his face, up to his forehead, to his hair. Even his hands became red in that moment.\\n\\n\\\"Good-bye, Marchese.\\\"\\n\\nShe went out, and left him standing with Gaspare.\\n\\n\\\"Signore Marchese, shall I take you to the boat?\\\"\\n\\nGaspare's voice was quite respectful. The Marchesino made no answer, but stepped out into the passage and looked up to the staircase that led to the top floor of the house. He listened. He heard nothing.\\n\\n\\\"Is the French Signore here?\\\" he said to Gaspare. \\\"Do you hear me? Is he in this house?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, Signore!\\\"\\n\\nThe Marchesino again looked towards the staircase and hesitated. Then he turned and saw Gaspare standing in a watchful attitude, almost like one about to spring.\\n\\n\\\"Stay here!\\\" he said, loudly, making a violent threatening gesture with his arm.\\n\\nGaspare stood where he was with a smile upon his face.\\n\\nA moment later he heard the splash of oars in the sea, and knew that the Marchesino's boat was leaving the island.\\n\\nHe drew his lips together like one about to whistle.\\n\\nThe sound of the oars died away.\\n\\nThen he began to whistle softly \\\"La Ciocciara.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXII\\n\\nThe ghostly day sank into a ghostly night that laid pale hands upon the island, holding it closely, softly, in a hypnotic grasp, bidding it surely rest, it and those who dwelled there with all the dreaming hours. A mist hung over the sea, and the heat did not go with day, but stayed to greet the darkness and the strange, enormous silence that lay upon the waters. In the Casa del Mare the atmosphere was almost suffocating, although every window was wide open. The servants went about their duties leaden-footed, drooping, their Latin vivacity quenched as by a spell. Vere was mute. It seemed, since the episode of the Carmine, as if her normal spirit had been withdrawn, as if a dumb, evasive personality replaced it. The impression made upon Hermione was that the real Vere had sunk far down in her child, out of sight and hearing, out of reach, beyond pursuit, to a depth where none could follow, where the soul enjoyed the safety of utter isolation.\\n\\nHermione did not wish to pursue this anchorite. She did not wish to draw near to Vere that evening. To do so would have been impossible to her, even had Vere been willing to come to her. Since the brutal outburst of the Marchesino, she, too, had felt the desire, the necessity, of a desert place, where she could sit alone and realize the bareness of her world.\\n\\nIn that outburst of passion the Marchesino had gathered together and hurled at her beliefs that had surely been her own, but that she had striven to avoid, that she had beaten back as spectres and unreal, that she had even denied, tricking, or trying to trick, her terrible sense of truth. His brutality had made the delicacy in her crouch and sicken. It had been almost intolerable to her, to see her friend, Emile, thus driven out into the open, like one naked, to be laughed at, condemned, held up, that the wild folly, the almost insane absurdity of his secret self might be seen and understood even by the blind, the determined in stupidity.\\n\\nShe had always had a great reverence for her friend, which had been mingled with her love for him, giving it its character. Was this reverence to be torn utterly away? Had it already been cast to the winds?\\n\\nPoor Emile!\\n\\nIn the first moments after the departure of the Marchesino she pitied Emile intensely with all her heart of woman. If this thing were true, how he must have suffered, how he must still be suffering--not only in his heart, but in his mind! His sense of pride, his self-respect, his passion for complete independence, his meticulous consciousness of the fitness of things, of what could be and what was impossible--all must by lying in the dust. She could almost have wept for him then.\\n\\nBut another feeling succeeded this sense of pity, a sensation of outrage that grew within her and became almost ungovernable. She had her independence too, her pride, her self-respect. And now she saw them in dust that Emile had surely heaped about them. A storm of almost hard anger shook her. She tasted an acrid bitterness that seemed to impregnate her, to turn the mainspring of her life to gall. She heard the violent voice of the young Neapolitan saying: \\\"He is master, he is master, he has always been master here!\\\" And she tried to look back over her life, and to see how things had been. And, shaken still by this storm of anger, she felt as if it were true, as if she had allowed Artois to take her life in his hands and to shape it according to his will, as if he had been governing her although she had not known it. He had been the dominant personality in their mutual friendship. His had been the calling voice, hers the obedient voice that answered. Only once had she risen to a strong act, an act that brought great change with it, and that he had been hostile to. That was when she had married Maurice.\\n\\nAnd she had left Maurice for Artois. From Africa had come the calling, dominant voice. And even in her Garden of Paradise she had heard it. And even from her Garden of Paradise she had obeyed it. For the first time she saw that act of renunciation as the average man or woman would probably see it; as an extraordinary, quixotic act, to be wondered at blankly, or, perhaps, to be almost angrily condemned. She stood away from her own impulsive, enthusiastic nature, and stared at it critically--as even her friends had often stared--and realized that it was unusual, perhaps extravagant, perhaps sometimes preposterous. This readiness to sacrifice--was it not rather slavish than regally loyal? This forgetfulness of personal joy, this burnt-offering of personality--was it not contemptible? Could such actions bring into being the respect of others, the respect of any man? Had Emile respected her for rushing to Africa? Or had he, perhaps, then and through all these years, simply wondered how she could have done such a thing?\\n\\nAnd Maurice--Maurice? Oh, what had he thought? How had he looked upon that action?\\n\\nOften and often in lonely hours she had longed to go down into the grave, or to go up into the blue, to drag the body, the soul, the heart she loved back to her. She had been rent by a desire that had made her limbs shudder, or that had flushed her whole body with red, and set her temples beating. The longing of heart and flesh had been so vehement that it had seemed to her as if they must compel, or cease to be. Now, again, she desired to compel Maurice to come to her from his far, distant place, but in order that she might make him understand what he had perhaps died misunderstanding; why she had left him to go to Artois, exactly how she had felt, how desperately sad to abandon the Garden of Paradise, how torn by fear lest the perfect days were forever at an end, how intensely desirous to take him with her. Perhaps he had felt cruelly jealous! Perhaps that was why he had not offered to go with her at once. Yes, she believed that now. She saw her action, she saw her preceding decision as others had seen it, as no doubt Maurice had seen it, as perhaps even Artois had seen it. Why had she instinctively felt that because her nature was as it was, and because she was bravely following it, every one must understand her? Oh, to be completely understood! If she could call Maurice back for one moment, and just make him see her as she had been then; loyal to her friend, and through and through passionately loyal to him! If she could! If she could!\\n\\nShe had left Maurice, the one being who had utterly belonged to her, to go to Artois. She had lost the few remaining days in which she could have been supremely happy. She had come back to have a few short hours devoid of calm, chilled sometimes by the strangeness that had intruded itself between her and Maurice, to have one kiss in which surely at last misunderstanding was lost and perfect love was found. And then--that \\\"something\\\" in the water! And then--the gulf.\\n\\nIn that gulf she had not been quite alone. The friend whom she had carried away from Africa and death had been with her. He had been closely in her life ever since. And now--\\n\\nShe heard the Marchesino's voice: \\\"I see what he is, what he wants, I see it all--all that is in his mind and heart. I see, I have always seen, that he loves the Signorina, that he loves her madly.\\\"\\n\\nVere!\\n\\nHermione sickened. Emile and Vere in that relation!\\n\\nThe storm of anger was not spent yet. Would it ever be spent? Something within her, the something, perhaps, that felt rejected, strove to reject in its turn, did surely reject. Pride burned in her like a fire that cruelly illumines night, shining upon the destruction it is compassing.\\n\\nThe terrible sense of outrage that gripped her soul and body--her body because Vere was bone of her bone, flesh of her flesh--seemed to be forcibly changing her nature, as cruel hands, prompted by murder in a heart, change form, change beauty in the effort to destroy.\\n\\nThat evening Hermione felt herself being literally defaced by this sensation of outrage within her, a sensation which she was powerless to expel.\\n\\nShe found herself praying to God that Artois might not come to the island that night. And yet, while she prayed, she felt that he was coming.\\n\\nShe dined with Vere, in almost complete silence--trying to love this dear child as she had always loved her, even in certain evil moments of an irresistible jealousy. But she felt immensely far from Vere, distant from her as one who does not love from one who loves; yet hideously near, too, like one caught in the tangle of an enforced intimacy rooted in a past which the present denies and rejects. Directly dinner was over they parted, driven by the mutual desire to be alone.\\n\\nAnd then Hermione waited for that against which she had prayed.\\n\\nArtois would come to the island that night. Useless to pray! He was coming. She felt that he was on the sea, environed by this strange mist that hung to-night over the waters. She felt that he was coming to Vere. She had gone to Africa to save him--in order that he might fall in love with her then unborn child.\\n\\nMonstrosities, the monstrosities that are in life, deny them, beat them back, close our eyes to them as we will, rose up around her in the hot stillness. She felt haunted, terrified. She was forcibly changed, and now all the world was changing about her.\\n\\nShe must have relief. She could not sit there among spectres waiting for the sound of oars that would tell her Vere's lover had come to the island. How could she detach herself for a moment from this horror?\\n\\nShe thought of Ruffo.\\n\\nAs the thought came to her she got up and went out of the house.\\n\\nOnly when she was out-of-doors did she fully realize the strangeness of the night. The heat of it was flaccid. The island seemed to swim in a fatigued and breathless atmosphere. The mist that hung about it was like the mist in a vapor-bath.\\n\\nBelow the vague sea lay a thing exhausted, motionless, perhaps fainting in the dark. And in this heat and stillness there was no presage, no thrill, however subtle, of a coming change, of storm. Rather there was the deadness of eternity, as if this swoon would last forever, neither developing into life, nor deepening into death.\\n\\nHermione had left the house feverishly, yearning to escape from her company of spectres, yearning to escape from the sensation of ruthless hands defacing her. As she passed the door-sill it was only with difficulty that she suppressed a cry of \\\"Ruffo!\\\" a cry for help. But when the night took her she no longer had any wish to disturb it by a sound. She was penetrated at once by an atmosphere of fatality. Her pace changed. She moved on slowly, almost furtively. She felt inclined to creep.\\n\\nWould Ruffo be at the island to-night? Would Artois really come? It seemed unlikely, almost impossible. But if Ruffo were there, if Artois came, it would be fatality. That she was there was fatality.\\n\\nShe walked always slowly, always furtively, to the crest of the cliff.\\n\\nShe stood there. She listened.\\n\\nSilence.\\n\\nShe felt as if she were quite alone on the island. She could scarcely believe that Vere, that Gaspare, that the servants were there--among them Peppina with her cross.\\n\\nThey said Peppina had the evil eye. Had she perhaps cast a spell to-night?\\n\\nHermione did not smile at such an imagination as she dismissed it.\\n\\nShe waited and listened, but not actively, for she did not feel as if Ruffo could ever stand with her in the embrace of such a night, he, a boy, with bright hopes and eager longings, he the happy singer of the song of Mergellina.\\n\\nAnd yet, when in a moment she found him standing by her side, she accepted his presence as a thing inevitable.\\n\\nIt had been meant, perhaps for centuries, that they two should stand together that night, speak together as now they were about to speak.\\n\\n\\\"Signora, buona sera.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Buona sera, Ruffo.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Signorina is not here to-night?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think she is in the house. I think she is tired to-night.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Signorina is tired after the Festa, Signora.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You knew we were at the Festa, Ruffo?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ma si, Signora.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did we tell you we were going? I had forgotten.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It was not that, Signora. But I saw the Signorina at the Festa. Did not Don Gaspare tell you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Gaspare said nothing. Did he see you?\\\"\\n\\nShe spoke languidly. Quickness had died out of her under the influence of the night. But already she felt a slight yet decided sense of relief, almost of peace. She drew that from Ruffo. And, standing very close to him, she watched his eager face, hoping to see presently in it the expression that she loved.\\n\\n\\\"Did he see you, Ruffo?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ma si, Signora. I was with my poor mamma.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your mother! I wish I had met her!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signora. I was with my mamma in the Piazza of Masaniello. We had been eating snails, Signora, and afterwards watermelon, and we had each had a glass of white wine. And I was feeling very happy, because my poor mamma had heard good news.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What was that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To-morrow my Patrigno is to be let out of prison.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So soon! But I thought he had not been tried.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, Signora. But he is to be let out now. Perhaps he will be put back again. But now he is let out because\\\"--he hesitated--\\\"because--well, Signora, he has such friends, he has friends who are powerful for him. And so he is let out just now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I understand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, Signora, and after the white wine we were feeling happy, and we were going to see everything: the Madonna, and Masaniello, and the fireworks, and the fire-balloon. Did you see the fire-balloon, Signora?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Ruffo. It was very pretty.\\\"\\n\\nHis simple talk soothed her. He was so young, so happy, so free from the hideous complexities of life; no child of tragedy, but the son surely of a love that had been gay and utterly contented.\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signora! Per dio, Signora, it was wonderful! It was just before the fire-balloon went up, Signora, that I saw the Signorina with the Neapolitan Signorino. And close behind them was Don Gaspare. I said to my mamma, 'Mamma, ecco the beautiful Signorina of the island!' My mamma was excited, Signora. She held on to my arm, and she said: 'Ruffino,' she said, 'show her to me. Where is she?' my mamma said, Signora. 'And is the Signora Madre with her?' Just then, Signora, the people moved, and all of a sudden there we were, my mamma and I, right in front of Don Gaspare.\\\"\\n\\nRuffo stopped, and Hermione saw a change, a gravity, come into his bright face.\",\"timestamp\":1637315418,\"title\":\"\\nHermione got up.
