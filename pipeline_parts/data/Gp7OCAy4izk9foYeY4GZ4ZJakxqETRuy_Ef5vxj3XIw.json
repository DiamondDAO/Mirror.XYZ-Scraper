"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The peak of NBA rivalries were through the 80s and 90s but there is still a lot of ill feelings from rivalries that peaked during those periods, as well as new rivalries that have developed. Let’s take a look at the six biggest rivalries in the NBA today:\\n\\n*   [6. LA Lakers vs. San Antonio Spurs](#6\\\\_LA_Lakers_vs_San_Antonio_Spurs \\\"6.

LA Lakers vs. Boston Celtics](#1\\\\_LA_Lakers_vs_Boston_Celtics \\\"1. LA Lakers vs. Boston Celtics\\\")\\n\\n## 6. LA Lakers vs. San Antonio Spurs\\n\\nThe Lakers and Spurs have a special rivalry and at one stage was considered to be the biggest rivalry in the NBA. The Lakers are the only team that has a winning overall record against the Spurs in both the regular season and the playoffs.\\n\\nThe rivalry kicked off with San Antonio winning their first title in 1999. Throughout the 2000s the Lakers and Spurs dominated the Western Conference with the pair meeting each other in the playoffs four times, the Lakers winning three series. Shaquille O’Neal would depart the Lakers in 2004 with the Lakers taking a turn. The Spurs would then dominate the Western Conference winning three championships between 2003-2007.\\n\\nOne of the most memorable moments of the rivalry was when Derek Fisher made an impossible fadeaway in the Western Conference semifinals in 2004. With the series tied at 2-all and with just 0.4 seconds left, Tim Duncan gave San Antonio the lead. Fisher then hit an impossible fadeaway just before the buzzer sounded to give the Lakers a win and the momentum to win the series.\\n\\nAdding some more spice to the Lakers-Spurs rivalry is Robert Horry who spent six years with the Lakers, winning three championships. Horry would sign for the Spurs in 2003 and played a surprisingly key role in helping the San Antonio to two titles in five years. Dennis Rodman also played for both the Spurs and the Lakers as did Pau Gasol and Danny Green.\\n\\n## 5. New York Knicks vs. Miami Heat\\n\\nThe Heat-Knicks rivalry was at one stage the most fiercest in the NBA. The peak of the rivalry was between 1997-2000 where both teams met in the playoffs for four years straight, the first time that’s ever happened in NBA history. The Knicks got the better of the Heat, winning three of those four series which were all played with intense defensive struggles, many foul calls and aggressive physicality.\\n\\nPatrick Ewing vs. Alonzo Mourning was one of the best matchups in the Heat-Knicks rivalry, the pair meeting 22 times in the regular season and 23 times in playoff games between 1992-2002. Ewing has a better record over Mourning, winning 25-20 overall and 14-9 in playoffs. Historically the head-to-head record between the Knicks and the Heat is very close.\\n\\nInterestingly one of the most contentious moments in the rivalry was off the court, when beloved New York coach Pat Riley left the Big Apple for Miami. Riley’s signing to the Knicks in 1991 was instrumental in keeping Patrick Ewing in New York and making a complete U-turn from free agency. What made things worse was that Riley told the Knicks he was leaving in a fax to the Knicks front office.\\n\\nLosing Riley was significant because of how he was able to transform the Knicks into the strongest, most conditioned and physical team in the league. Unfortunately for the Knicks he couldn’t bring ultimate glory to New York, their last championship in 1973. Riley would however end up guiding the Heat to an NBA Championship in 2006.\\n\\n## 4. Detroit Pistons vs. Chicago Bulls\\n\\nThe Pistons-Bulls rivalry began in the late 80’s and was one of the most fiercest in the NBA for years. Geographically the areas are quite close – separated by 280-miles – and both Chicago and Detroit are the two largest metro areas in the Midwest, sharing rivalries across many sports.\\n\\nBoth the Pistons and Bulls were Eastern Conference contenders in the 80s and 90s. Initially the ‘Bad Boys’ of Detroit got on top of the Bulls by carefully devised the ‘Jordan Rules’, a strategy used to limit the impact Michael Jordan had on games. The game plan involved limiting Jordan from taking clutch shots as well as playing a physically imposing defense. Through 1988-1990 the plan worked as the Pistons knocked the Bulls out of the playoffs in three straight seasons on their way to winning back-to-back championships.\\n\\nAt the turn of the 90’s, Bulls coach Phil Jackson deployed the Triangle Offense which changed the entire course of the Chicago Bulls franchise and added fuel to the the Pistons-Bulls rivalry. The Bulls would win six championships throughout the 90’s, Jordan ultimately too explosive and dangerous to keep in check.\\n\\nOne of the most intense feuds of all-time was created in the Pistons-Bulls rivalry: Michael Jordan and Isiah Thomas. Where feuds have healed and players have reconciled over time, the Jordan-Thomas rivalry has never faded. Jordan believes that Thomas was behind the infamous ‘Freezeout’ of Jordan at the 1985 NBA All-Star Game. It’s also said that Isiah, a Chicago native, wasn’t pleased with Jordan transforming the Bulls and having the entire city of Chicago behind him. Jordan has admitted to hating Thomas, but respecting his game enough to rank Thomas as the second best point guard of all-time.\\n\\n## 3. Golden State Warriors vs. Cleveland Cavaliers\\n\\nThe Warriors-Cavs rivalry has developed only recently, beginning in the 2014-15 season as the Golden State and Cleveland met in four consecutive NBA Finals. The Warriors built a dynasty surrounding Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, winning three championships in four seasons. What makes the rivalry special is that the Cavaliers won the 2016 NBA Finals, the Warriors blowing a seemingly unassailable 3-1 lead in a season which they achieved the best regular season record of all-time finish 73-9 (.890).\\n\\nCleveland would spice up the rivalry by mocking Golden State at a Halloween party, with tombstone cookies supposedly featuring the names of Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry. In a TNT interview, Warriors’ power forward Draymond Green stated: “I don’t have much love for the Cleveland Cavaliers at all, nor do I think they have much love for us…that’s the true meaning of building a rivalry”. Since Lebron James’ departure, the rivalry has simmered in recent years as the Cavaliers faced a rebuild but Cleveland will never forget the championship that ended a 52-year title drought for the city.\\n\\n## 2. Chicago Bulls vs. New York Knicks\\n\\nThe Bulls-Knicks rivalry is one of the biggest NBA rivalries of all-time. The rivalry peaked during the 90’s between the biggest city in the East and the biggest in the West. Chicago and New York always managed to find themselves matched up in intense and high-stakes games which was filled with spectacular dunks, trash talk and immense physicality.\\n\\nSumming up the rivalry was the ultimate match-up of Michael Jordan vs. John Starks. It was a battle of the heavyweights with Starks one of the only few players who could make an impact and limit Jordan’s game. The rivalry was so intense that Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing, friends off the court, were involved in a heated exchange during the 1993 Eastern Conference Finals. The two had to be pulled apart following an exchange of angry words mid-court.\\n\\nOne of the most iconic moments of the rivalry was Scottie Pippen’s slam dunk on Ewing. Following the dunk Pippen shoved an already unbalanced Ewing over and took it a step further by walking over Ewing. Pippen then taunted Spike Lee who was on the sidelines and earned himself a technical foul.\\n\\n## 1. LA Lakers vs. Boston Celtics\\n\\nThe Celtics and Lakers were always destined to be the biggest rivalry in the NBA as the two oldest teams in the league. The rivalry, like most, peaked in the 80’s. Throughout the 80’s it was either the Celtics or the Lakers who would be competing in the NBA Finals.\\n\\nThe Larry Bird and Magic Johnson rivalry is among the greatest in NBA history and the 1986 Celtics (67-15) and the 1987 Lakers (65-17) NBA championship teams are considered to be among the best teams in NBA history.\\n\\nBoston are historically the better team in the rivalry with a 9-3 series record when both compete in the NBA Finals as well as a better head-to-head record. In the 2020 NBA Finals, the Lakers also matched the Celtics 17 championships to both become the most successful franchises in history. Both the Lakers and Celtics have won more than 45% of all NBA championships in history making the Lakers-Celtics rival the biggest in NBA history.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638353832,\"title\":\"The 6 Biggest Rivalries in the NBA Today - WOLFGANGSPORT\"},\"digest\":\"t9bAmeOTQHLtloIX04k6d_D54YYq6vXv3TcB2edtVIs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x239734245217b5aE0FB74D5a712cF823f471A2aE\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Ld4NKEH2xxptSU9PIOuO1C0kUHwgmUYa-f7tHBSqb6M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"HE4focnIYE3jmeVgQYMPE6oY1vI92Dgiu5XHGPTP8Nw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"0BM33cMzpAD9BGHSCEPsRIrdEq3Or06vOQQVa5ehiROyzejbF4EkoaBKixxe5GJWlI4iTeFpRgHrGgx14T5gmg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9e9f8cce509d791b46a0785df9c674af5197e86498034dc906a67e77c1d485ae2ac5defd5b244acff593dab571e22bfd8dc83a4d19da986c310e637421fdf2fe1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Ld4NKEH2xxptSU9PIOuO1C0kUHwgmUYa-f7tHBSqb6M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"HE4focnIYE3jmeVgQYMPE6oY1vI92Dgiu5XHGPTP8Nw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"t9bAmeOTQHLtloIX04k6d_D54YYq6vXv3TcB2edtVIs\"}"
