We choose to go to the moon, not because it easy, but because it is totally sick‚Äù -JFK*\\n\\n![Join our DAO for a chance of being sent into low earth orbit in 2022.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lfeyKnoqp_tKEo3x8Icyj.png?height=500&width=1500)\\n\\nYou may have heard of tokens ‚Äúgoing to the moon‚Äù ‚Ä¶ but only one token is *literally* going to the moon: **$MOON.** Our token launches on December 17th, check out [moondao.com](https://moondao.com) for more information on how to purchase our token!\\n\\n### What is MoonDAO?\\n\\nIf you‚Äôre new to web3 or not hip on all the lingo: MoonDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO for short). This means we are a group of people that coordinate online in a decentralized manner and are united by a common mission. In our case, our mission is simple: **To decentralize access to space**.\\n\\n### Why should we decentralize access to space?\\n\\nWe are currently living in the inflection point of a space race, and the implications for the outcome of that race is massive. Few people comprehend the magnitude of the opportunity to go to the moon or mars. Going to the New World made Spain the richest country on the planet, and that was ‚Äúonly‚Äù discovering two continents.\\n\\nCreating an economic connection with an entirely new planet will be such a massive wealth creation opportunity that few can wrap their heads around it. Trillions and trillions of dollars. And who would benefit most from this? The people that are *already* the richest in the world: Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX, Jeff Bezos‚Äôs Blue Origin, Richard Branson‚Äôs Virgin Galactic.\\n\\nNow, we don‚Äôt doubt that making life multi-planetary is a bad goal, quite the opposite, **we believe that making life multi-planetary is one of the most inspiring and important missions in our lifetime**, the big question is: *how?*\\n\\n**We believe that an international, decentralized, inclusive, and transparent organization would be much better aligned with the needs of the everyday person.**\\n\\nWe‚Äôre not saying that Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos are ‚ÄúDr. Evil‚Äù like characters, but at the end of the day the incentives often dictate the outcomes.\\n\\nAt MoonDAO we do not believe in \\\"emperors of the moon,\\\" ‚Äúkings of mars,‚Äù or \\\"CEOs of space,\\\" but instead we believe in extending the unalienable rights of citizens of planet earth to the solar system and beyond, and sharing the benefits of space exploration with ‚Äúthe people.‚Äù\\n\\n*So‚Ä¶ how do we intend on going to the moon? Hasn‚Äôt no one been there since the 70s? Also what capability do you have that well funded space companies that have been working on this for years don‚Äôt?*\\n\\n## MoonDAO‚Äôs Roadmap\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gCSAGzAL_QJL2ToyOuDXP.png?height=500&width=1500)\\n\\n### üåí¬†Moon Phase 1: Deploy a token for decentralized governance of MoonDAO.\\n\\nIn order to be a DAO, we need a governance token for decision making. This is our first step. **We are not using this token to raise enough money for the rest of our roadmap, this is just to coordinate our governance.**\\n\\nThe core team has not pre-mined any tokens for ourselves. This is unusual for an Ethereum project, but we thought it would be more fair for everyone involved that we did not airdrop or pre-mine any number of tokens for people ahead of time. We are not VC funded, we are community organized and led, this is very important to us!\\n\\n**What are the properties of this token?**\\n\\n1. Our token will have a fixed supply. Once our initial token raise is over, **we will never increase the supply of the tokens.**\\n2. Our token will be used for governance decisions. We will have proportional governance up to a community decided limit. The limit is needed such that if one person buys more than 51% the tokens they cannot centrally control the DAO‚Äôs decisions.\\n3. The money raised from this token will fund the workers (NFT designers, website developers, solidity developers, marketing, legal consulting, etc.) needed to complete the rest of the roadmap.\\n4. The token raise will occur on [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money), and for every contribution we will create governance tokens at a fixed rate of 1 ETH = 1,000,000 $MOON tokens. You will receive a portion of those tokens in your wallet, and then some will stay with the DAO in order to fund the work required to make this DAO function, and those tokens will form part of the shared treasury that you can vote on with your tokens.\\n\\nThere is no expectation of profit with this token. It is a governance token. You are not receiving and fractionalized ownership of the DAOs assets in exchange for the token, check our FAQs for more information and disclaimers.\\n\\n[https://moondao.com/docs/faq](https://moondao.com/docs/faq)\\n\\n### üåì¬†Moon Phase 2: Send a MoonDAO member to space in 2022.\\n\\n1. We will release the *Ticket to Space* NFT collection. **These NFTs can only be bought with our token**, and will put you into a lottery to win a ticket to fly to space in 2022.\\n2. The money raised from the sale of these NFTs will be used to buy tickets to space on a SpaceX/Blue Origin/Virgin Galactic etc. rocket ship.\\n3. Send MoonDAO member(s) to space in 2022.\\n\\n**How much will this cost?** Virgin Galactic has sold tickets for $250K and it has been reported that Blue Origin will sell tickets in the range of $300K-$400K. MoonDAO wants to help create a world where anyone can fly to space regardless of their financial situation. We hope that this can be a meaningful and inspirational first step in decentralizing space exploration.\\n\\nSo far in history, space exploration has been gated to the rest of the world ‚Äî accessible to only the privileged. MoonDAO changes this for the first time in history.\\n\\n### üåî¬†Moon Phase 3: Provide funding to space research and exploration.\\n\\nThe exploration of space should unify the world, not pit us against each other like the last space race. After all, aren't we all just curious earthlings that want to explore the unknown? Now, Web 3.0 represents a technology that can unify earthlings and decentralize space exploration.\\n\\n### üåï¬†Moon Phase 4: Put a MoonDAO colony on the moon.\\n\\nThat's¬†one small step for DAO, one giant leap for DAO-kind.\\n\\nThe 1967 Space Treaty forms the basis for all law concerning space. In this treaty it states that no *national* appropriation of the moon can take place. However, a DAO is not a nation ‚Äî it is an international collective of frens.\\n\\nWe have the opportunity to use these new governance and coordination tools in order to form a more perfect union as we extend the rights and liberties of every human on earth into the solar system.\\n\\n### üåù¬†Moon Phase 5: Have sweet moon parties (everyone's invited).\\n\\nThey're gonna be sweet. BYOB but we'll provide transportation.\\n\\n## Interested in contributing?\\n\\nWe are launching our governance token on Friday, December 17th!\\n\\n[https://juicebox.money/#/](https://juicebox.money/#/)\\n\\nTo stay up to date follow us on twitter:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/OfficialMoonDAO](https://twitter.com/OfficialMoonDAO)\\n\\nDAOs are all about communities working together, join us on Discord to get involved and help us achieve our mission.
