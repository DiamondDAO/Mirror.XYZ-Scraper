"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Preface**\\n\\nWriting is not necessarily a strong suit of mine and I often find it hard to convey my thoughts and ideas in a coherent manner. To address this problem, I have created a block of time within my daily schedule that forces me to covert my current thoughts and ideas into words on paper.\\n\\n**Background**\\n\\nI started Raedam (raedam.co) my sophomore year at Portland State University (PSU). Raedam’s mission was to upend the parking industry’s archaic methodologies and systems. With today’s technologies, one might ask, why is it necessary to rely on outdated count boards or roam around looking for open parking spaces? If you ever inquired about the previous question, I am here to offer you some insights.\\n\\n**Why I started Raedam**\\n\\nIn any given situation, my mind defaults to seeing my surroundings as systems. As such, I always find myself looking for ways to simplify these systems to produce a more efficient and enjoyable process. As PSU is located in downtown Portland, Oregon, it wouldn’t take too much thought or imagination to visualize that parking is quite scarce and people’s patience is even more so.\\n\\n**Understanding of the parking industry**\\n\\nParking, in the context of populous cities, is more often than not under the control of local governance. Contrary to popular belief, the majority of the parking in any given city is often located on the street and not in parking structures.\\n\\n**Primary point of failure**\\n\\nWith the surface-level information provided, you can possibly identify that primary point of failure that took me just under three years to understand. Despite having many mentors and advisors throughout my journey running Raedam (most of which have repeatedly warned of my this exact problem)\\n\\n**Lessons learned**\\n\\n**Final thoughts** \\n\\n1. It’s not worth your time trying to make change in any aspect that requires government approval or contracts at any large extent, especially as a startup and one without prior success to help vouch for your ability to deliver on your ideas.\\n2. A Startup really does require your full-time. You can’t expect to succeed in building a company without providing it with the proper attention and effort. This claim especially holds true when your startup is trying to build out a hardware and a software product that also happened to be B2B2C. It’s too complicated. \\n3. Avoid hardware at all costs. As much as it is fun to touch and hold a tangible item you built from scratch, the associated pain is not worth it. \",\"timestamp\":1639284891,\"title\":\"Why Raedam failed\"},\"digest\":\"IDC_suwVVeC8kgYFtiwQ_crgdzEHWaH8Bw4Psedco3c\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd269259ed7Fa5d3B04a114DA788744E72540Ba01\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nsdOLt3ros5s8DC8buyojjPDjYg0Pt2ETIpGLeobrr4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"LzpeTWyI3d-TPQyD19ezFzX8HiA9LOIaRoylIIgc3b0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"vKxHbK6TH13oHr05RtX2ymrImF-2Urwh1qM_5VAT8v-mzWhFQKb0o05WiGLpwN4IqnEmiL0JjtC_hPp33La3Hg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd076700831ad8a47c8e1a55aba16fc89be3d385c4937267b37d33e1a7e9eaf694f2265889c5044411257896f103e24116a89ab8b5d78b8b3933943392ae784421b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nsdOLt3ros5s8DC8buyojjPDjYg0Pt2ETIpGLeobrr4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"LzpeTWyI3d-TPQyD19ezFzX8HiA9LOIaRoylIIgc3b0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wr7-MeSfspv75UOIHziLsDnBYRddXMm7NEPVtADcfRY\"}"
