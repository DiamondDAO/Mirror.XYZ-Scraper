"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I lost an earlier post in which I described the process of setting up a **.eth** domain. It seems we need to explicitly press Publish in order to save data. Now I know. Well, I don’t mind publishing and then editing. This is just a public log for the time being.\\n\\nLike I mentioned, I bought a new domain at **9981.eth**. Nine times nine equals eighty-one. With more capital, I would probably want to speculate on a whole bunch of domains, but in my position it’s better to be patient and strike at the right opportunities. The Web3 space is still a giant, unmapped territory. All the same, I’m really happy to have my little plot of land in this growing world. It’s the little sort of triumph I needed after my defeat yesterday trying to buy this:\\n\\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/105198](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/105198)\\n\\nRight now, I feel intimidated by the whole space, and there is a nagging sense of FOMO, plus a wealth of negative thoughts: Why hadn’t I gotten in earlier? I was already bored last year at this time, I could have gotten way ahead of the NFT craze and built more of a nest egg and safety net, financially. I’m already too late—all the good ideas are built or have smart people working on them already, ENS already airdropped all the $ENS they ever will, and I’m just someone trying to grab onto the smoke from a train that’s already careened past me while I was sleeping.\\n\\nThose thoughts are understandable. Anyone who looks at the history of NFT prices in the past six months will see a line going up and to the right at a more rapid cadence than any new collector would like to see.\\n\\nStill, I am no slave to my emotions. Doubts and fears come and go like the wind. There is so damn much to do still, and so much that piques my curiosity. I taste the future on my tongue and feel the storm blowing in, and by God am I doing anything else but charging in headfirst.\",\"timestamp\":1636617105,\"title\":\"Day Three: Over the river and through the woods\"},\"digest\":\"UY3ouiZFHwD-DKNQkWe4Lz3r1xWlbZ2UsZ6m4S5wbtI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xf164161838b3b1DD8DBA320611d2a8ab993a56d7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"m5c59Onb6xFOnUIJtgUm4bkKZBPH-YSobZrXFlqE4JU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"7aNtU_MtXj5SHplU98ZOAW1xwE44p6Ma7LQyH5zmyw8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"eZynyIkwf20kkOxXBJtE44YVWHAoN6YDfpy94We7_b_WSMCppKDLG_qp09igZzZZTDLu6u42wMCd9fPdjAK3sw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xcca05650cd660a55b814680f0794ac79a114e63fb6c05c7dab6ef2d305d4878608c5cbb2d142724dc5a3071ea3524802520b1ab5d90f99b66a93ec11c9708f801c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"m5c59Onb6xFOnUIJtgUm4bkKZBPH-YSobZrXFlqE4JU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"7aNtU_MtXj5SHplU98ZOAW1xwE44p6Ma7LQyH5zmyw8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"MBQVcoVewSTVah2xVOmGT4B_LkF0Xv4Qslqioxj2N2k\"}"
