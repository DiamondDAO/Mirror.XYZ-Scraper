"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I always wondered what is the immediate effect of the crypto market to the retail investors that makes them jump into it like “apes” – this is the word that describes the communal sentiment of flocking to a particular crypto project. Hence, I had some difficulty deciding on how to draw a fine line of where “aping” starts and where a well-articulated and thoughtful financial decision is being made.\\n\\nMy following on my Twitter account shows me how “sentimentally volatile” people are in there and mainly how they hunt down “[Green Dildos](https://www.cryptoemotions.com/dildo-in-cryptocurrency/)”, as they are calling the big green candles when doing their Technical Analysis. Catastrophic, in some sense, as I can’t exclude from the equation how our brains get really addicted to that “Green Dildo” chase, the constant exploration for the “next big gem” that is promising – one way or another – to make us rich… Saw this story many times, and while I am an investor myself and am with full throttle into the blockchain world, I cannot stress enough how precarious this kind of mentality can be, leading (potentially) to mental deterioration and a dreaded sequence of sleepless nights (does this ring a bell for some of you?).\\n\\n![Ah those sleepless nights...](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b2dHgr9JJRjmDGZdTPELk.jpeg?height=225&width=768)\\n\\nSure, there have been loads of people out there who have certainly been affected enormously by this, and to be honest I do not see this situation getting less negatively impactful for people, especially, since the crypto-space is constantly evolving.\\n\\nThe other pattern, I clearly see, is that whenever someone is overly or overtly bearish people start to hate and be very bitter towards them. There is a confirmation bias with regards to how people analyze an asset, do fundamental and technical analysis, and then see what they WANT to see. This is an intrinsic problem which from my understanding is being prominent in not only the crypto-space but, generally, it gloriously spreads to the stock market.\\n\\nHaving said that, what if we – retail investors – took another approach into how we make our supposedly educated guesses with regards to the cryptoassets (or crypto projects, or whatever you want to call it)? Or we “think” that because we buy into them, these are simultaneously going to explode up-and-up?\\n\\nDoes our psychology need some optimal priming? Do we really know how we can benefit the most after we fix our mental game…to the highest level possible? [Research](https://www.apa.org/monitor/feb03/overestimate) has already proven how human beings overstimate their ability to make good judgements and choices, as well as their abilities.\\n\\nYou can, obviously, recognize that a plethora of questions can pop-up if – and that is a big IF – we go into an “inquisitive mind mode”. And by inquisitiveness I want to stress enough and accordingly enhance the phenomenon where someone endeavors to investigate, judge critically, and delve deep into a particular subject that needs important decision-making before you jump in.\\n\\nThe risk lies beneath the high risk/high reward conundrum that infiltrated the crypto community and which gave the basis for the infamous “pump and dump schemes” (PADS) that have emerged, since the times of ICOs hunting. The PADS, though, are not an (unfortunate) event that is regarded as unprecedented. I will drive a parallel now to the stock market, which you might know that it has those uber-speculative penny stocks that have low trading volume, and means to some extent that their volatility can either “make you or break you”.  The equivalent cryptocurrency pump and dump schemes, thus, can be unfortunate for the speculators who lose and very fortunate for those who gain loads of money on the peak of the pump. To be able to receive those gains, two are the most fundamental features that can distinguish you:\\n\\n1. To know when to exit by taming your greediness (take profits incrementally on the way up)\\n2. To have the know-how on discovering those risky projects, if you think you have the mental strength and capacity to take an “L”(loss), if things don’t turn out as you would have thought.\\n\\nCompared to the penny stock market, there are exquisite attributes that make the cryptocurrency pump and dump ecosystem yielding rug-pulls that will be reminiscent to the ages of ages.\\n\\n![It has happened to the best of us I think, especially in the beginning of our crypto journey!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a-ko753YCbMe17HET-zmO.jpg?height=480&width=852)\\n\\n\\nLet’s start, now, with the first significant difference between crypto and penny stock PADS and that is the usage of new technology, with main attention given to the immense impact that some social media platforms have. Two “new-age” specific platforms have their unique contribution into the promotion of PADS: a) Telegram and b) Discord. \\n\\nI do not think I have to explain why these two, because I am hilariously sure that you and me, and all the people who are well into the crypto-space recognize the popularity and effect of these platforms. Their power into forming communities ready to ape into some (shit)coins cannot be overstated as much as I would like to.\\n\\nApart from the social media, consider the huge influx of new cryptocurrencies (13.024 at the time of writing) that have been created – and are still being created through the easiness that forking provides. Limitless opportunities for exploitation, manipulation, and rug-pulling for thinly traded coins.\\n\\nAnd who can neglect (I wonder) the role that numerous unregulated exchanges have played into this? (Shit)coins are being traded with ease, while exchanges are profiting from the transaction fees that are over-bloated due to the pump.\\n\\nThe endless DeFi innovation, Flash Loans’ birth, DAOs’ incremental adoption, and the constant development of novel cryptocurrencies re-instated the fear of a non-regulated monetary exchange space. It is for this reason that the CFTC, SEC and all the relevant regulatory authorities do not manage (to a significant level so far) “catching” those PADS. The incredibly fast pace of the crypto world and the ever-present strength that aping communities have, alongside the above mentioned technological advancements, do not make crypto-regulation an easy task.\\n\\nSome of you will argue that tight regulation is not something that we really want and desire. And you may be right on this!\\n\\nHence, I will personally introduce the notion that there must be some regulation. This necessity, at least in my naïve mind, can be argued by many of you whether it will truly solve or create many other issues.\\n\\nStill, how can all of us cumulatively protect retail investors from being rug-pulled and lose lifesavings? [Marta](https://twitter.com/martabcalvinho?s=20), on Twitter, has tried to convince me a couple of days ago that WE, the crypto community, can lead the way for the newcomers by being driven from “feelings of empathy” to our fellow crypto friends. It is the community of each coin that makes the project special and great…or the coin we get attached to stops pumping and we forget all the community feelings?\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/martabcalvinho/status/1451495259528171523?s=20](https://twitter.com/martabcalvinho/status/1451495259528171523?s=20)\\n\\nMaybe DAOs are one solution, that might take some time to be completely trustless and widely adopted. Creating smart DAOs with equally really smart-contracts which can encode monetary protection through blind scripted bilateral agreements, could be a solution, right?\\n\\nA selfless, community driven, monetary environment seems itself like a utopia, an outlandish achievement. And I am saying this with full conviction that I can be totally wrong, something that I take full accountability.\\n\\nSo, because this essay started getting quite big, I will finish with some final thoughts.\\n\\n> I hope for less PADS through the education of all new crypto adopters, less aggressive marketing strategies that lead to unthinkable levels of aping, “normal” regulatory frameworks, further explored innovation of DAOs and a world that none will be unbanked (or maybe uncrypto-ed?), a world that its people will take care of each other by not only chasing “Green Dildos”, but by being considerate to their crypto “degen frens”!\\n\\nDon’t hesitate to comment or continue the discussion below on the comment section.\\n\\nI will try to write more of these (I hope) thought provoking essays, while mediating myself from my biotech job and my passion for the enthralling crypto/blockchain world.\\n\\nI just need to find more time!\\n\\n[crowdfund://undefined?features=overview,backers](crowdfund://undefined?features=overview,backers)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1635000256,\"title\":\"The Chase of Green Dildos and the Future of A Crypto Utopia\"},\"digest\":\"4Ombyzu34bVA0Q4FQHrnvYfibjmJwcegg1h4Qh7DtDw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xdef67F7206b988C28cEFbeD5499bE7B690c111a7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ORZR2neYLbCdjOe5R-o7dABW1hObNmjgbc_59WxA5Sg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YelMlM4xPKg3jEKmWeA1RQRJVCeCfCzFCc_xE2L0te4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"VIJtg7eQFSZQIXO6p4NobrkA3_03dLgkDtrfL1yi3-0SWdUkseCYnoOchSPWPtv36UTwuLhN-Yklr481VL3QTQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x81197f5494508a03454d5a1efc3fa1d7e3f258ec7108cb061c037f1c3c167e137eb5c9b62742e23968b077b0808294ea3f9d4de511ed5ccc0c2df0dd5989bfe91c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ORZR2neYLbCdjOe5R-o7dABW1hObNmjgbc_59WxA5Sg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YelMlM4xPKg3jEKmWeA1RQRJVCeCfCzFCc_xE2L0te4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"4Ombyzu34bVA0Q4FQHrnvYfibjmJwcegg1h4Qh7DtDw\"}"
