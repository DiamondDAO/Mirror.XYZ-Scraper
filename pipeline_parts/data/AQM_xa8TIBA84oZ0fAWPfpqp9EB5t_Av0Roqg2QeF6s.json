"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**\\\"Side-eying Chloe\\\" Clem - a young girl who became an internet sensation when a picture of her looking unimpressed went viral - is selling the original image for thousands of dollars at auction.**\\n\\nIt's being offered as a \\\"non-fungible token\\\" (NFT), a way of owning the original digital image.\\n\\nWhere Bitcoin was hailed as the digital answer to currency, NFTs are now being touted as the digital answer to collectables, but plenty of sceptics fear they're a bubble waiting to burst.\\n\\n## What is a non-fungible token?\\n\\nIn economics, a fungible asset is something with units that can be readily interchanged - like money.\\n\\nWith money, you can swap a £10 note for two £5 notes and it will have the same value.\\n\\nHowever, if something is non-fungible, this is impossible - it means it has unique properties so it can't be interchanged with something else.\\n\\nIt could be a house, or a painting such as the Mona Lisa, which is one of a kind. You can take a photo of the painting or buy a print but there will only ever be one original painting.\\n\\nNFTs are \\\"one-of-a-kind\\\" assets in the digital world that can be bought and sold like any other piece of property, but which have no tangible form of their own.\\n\\nThe digital tokens can be thought of as certificates of ownership for virtual or physical assets.\\n\\n## How do NFTs work?\\n\\nTraditional works of art such as paintings are valuable precisely because they are one of a kind.\\n\\nBut digital files can be easily and endlessly duplicated.\\n\\nWith NFTs, artwork can be \\\"tokenised\\\" to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought and sold.\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1634579282,\"title\":\"What are NFTs and why are some worth millions?\"},\"digest\":\"7Zc-CKqEIvA7-FcxuMeIH8RguXtJMyZB2T3Weso71S8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2Df1f8a66d2a8f32293E10321aCb25365F0c549a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cUrCj-f4HUQsX7bZqo1J7I30lhelYlj9aq-firjKOEE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"BtOcvctC5VTDwLLOjVIg6mHEwocP5ECtQaa_t_k8Pq4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"QSrviJOdVNe5EGjuDVC2_S1b8uD2vQ7bLTUbs_IA9sb8olFwoXvyIjYCvE7MVrVi0nqBLeDIRBHnAM_7R9cm6A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc964fd97bcfe44db6ffda7f20909b1359485dfc4104fb977283983fe426716766930460b82d0e64b8dec905c8a3f8c946eebfc6a2373737beb82a0defa546bac1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cUrCj-f4HUQsX7bZqo1J7I30lhelYlj9aq-firjKOEE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"BtOcvctC5VTDwLLOjVIg6mHEwocP5ECtQaa_t_k8Pq4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"7Zc-CKqEIvA7-FcxuMeIH8RguXtJMyZB2T3Weso71S8\"}"
