"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Blockchain addresses generally refer to wallet addresses. A wallet on a blockchain is \\n\\nbasically a tool to manage digital assets (commonly referred to as coins). The transfers \\n\\nand transfers of your coins, as well as the records of transfers and transfers, are \\n\\nimplemented through the wallet. Just as you need a home address to go home to, so \\n\\ndoes digital money. The difference is that the address of the digital currency is \\n\\nunique. You have an address so someone can transfer money to you. What's the \\n\\naddress? In a block chain system, the private key is randomly generated by a special \\n\\nrandom algorithm 256 2 hexadecimal string, the public key is generated by the private \\n\\nkey by the algorithm of irreversible, (i.e. you only by your initial value calculated results, \\n\\nthe initial value) but unable to get the results calculated, public key and by the address \\n\\nof the irreversible algorithm (note: In some blockchain systems, the address is the \\n\\npublic key, and the public key to the address is computed again to make the system \\n\\nmore secure.) It has to be mentioned that, because it is an irreversible algorithm, only \\n\\nthe private key can deduce the public key, and the public key can deduce the address, \\n\\nwhereas if you know someone else's address or public key, you can't deduce someone \\n\\nelse's private key at all. How to get the address information of the blockchain. If you \\n\\nbuild it yourself or in a team, it takes time and effort. In fact, it can also learn from third-\\n\\nparty node services, and directly call the interface to obtain address information, which \\n\\ncan be used to build a blockchain wallet.\",\"timestamp\":1641281516,\"title\":\"What is the contract address?
