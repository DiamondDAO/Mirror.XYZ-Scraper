"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*Important: Do not purchase anything marketed as IMX unless an official announcement is made. [United States citizens or residents are not allowed to receive IMX tokens due to regulatory uncertainties in the US.](https://bit.ly/37OzMKh)*\\n\\n**Latest Update: 6 November 2021 at 5:00 AM AEDT**\\n\\nTo reward those who have helped Immutable X grow, we are excited to announce the multi-stage Play to Earn campaign with rewards worth up to 60,000,000 IMX via the Retrospective and Alpha rewards stages. Our early users have provided invaluable support and feedback during the earliest stages of Immutable X’s development. To celebrate their dedication, they’ll be eligible for this exclusive campaign as an incentive to continue evangelizing Immutable X to the entire Ethereum community.\\n\\n# Retrospective Rewards\\n\\nA share of 10,000,000 IMX will be allocated to users who complete the three tasks below (1262 IMX per user):\\n\\n1. Play at least [1 multiplayer game of Gods Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/account/register) (Direct Challenge or Ranked) before the reward claim deadline\\n2. Have your [wallet connected](https://godsunchained.com/manage-wallets) to your Gods Unchained account and [linked to Immutable X](https://blog.godsunchained.com/wallet-linking-immutable-x/) before the reward claim deadline\\n3. Held a Gods Unchained NFT in your Immutable X wallet before the Retrospective rewards snapshot date (**22 July 2021 at 12 am UTC**)\\n\\n# Alpha Rewards\\n\\nAnother 40,000,000 IMX will be distributed to users as part of the Alpha Rewards. For clarity, users can earn both rewards from the Retrospective and Alpha stages!\\n\\nTo be eligible for Alpha rewards, you must complete all three tasks:\\n\\n1. Play at least [1 multiplayer game of Gods Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/account/register) (Direct Challenge or Ranked) before the reward claim deadline\\n2. Have your [wallet connected](https://godsunchained.com/manage-wallets) to your Gods Unchained account and [linked to Immutable X](https://blog.godsunchained.com/wallet-linking-immutable-x/) before the reward claim deadline\\n3. Hold Gods Unchained NFT in your Immutable X wallet before the Alpha rewards snapshot date (**21 September 2021 at 11.59 pm UTC**)\\n\\nTo allocate this reward, we will employ a points system based on each user’s Gods Unchained holdings in their inventory on the Alpha snapshot date. Every Gods Unchained card you own on Immutable X (including any platform powered by our protocol such as [Immutable X Marketplace](https://market.x.immutable.com/) or [TokenTrove](https://tokentrove.com/)) when we take this final snapshot will earn you points according to the table below. Take note that Mythic cards will be worth 50,000 points.\\n\\nIn the initial announcement, we mentioned that chests would be taken into consideration for the Play to Earn campaign points calculation. Due to the high gas fees, we don’t want our community to spend more on gas to migrate their chests from L1 to L2. We will still acknowledge users who complete the Alpha rewards step 1 & 2 and hold chest on L1 with allocated points highlighted in the table below.\\n\\nEach user’s share of the 40,000,000 IMX will be proportionate to their share of the total points on the snapshot date. An additional 10,000,000 IMX may be used in other promotional activities during this period.\\n\\n# What if I’m a US Citizen or Resident?\\n\\nOn Monday 16 August 2021, we shared an [announcement ](https://immutablex.medium.com/important-announcement-imx-alpha-rewards-update-929f7bc89513)on how the ongoing regulatory uncertainty in the US affected the reward campaigns for our United States-based community. As advised by our legal team to align with our commitment to being a long-term pillar of the Ethereum NFT ecosystem and partnering with some of the largest companies in the world, we have to go above and beyond when it comes to legal compliance.\\n\\nWe understand how disappointing the impact is to our US supporters and we know that most of you will have traded on Immutable X in the hope of sharing in the campaign rewards. We’re going to make sure that you’re still rewarded for your contributions to the Immutable X ecosystem in the Play to Earn campaign!\\n\\nIf you are based in the US (which is determined by your IP address upon claiming), you can still participate in the Play to Earn campaign by completing the same three tasks for the Retrospective and Alpha Rewards.\\n\\n**[Instead of receiving rewards in IMX, you will get the USDC equivalent of IMX you earned via two price options](https://immutablex.medium.com/updates-to-the-imx-play-to-earn-for-us-supporters-d0ab5a465009).** You will have 1 week to select your preference before it defaults to the fixed price option due to logistical considerations.\\n\\nYou can find the explanation Medium articles below:\\n\\n* [Legal Considerations](https://immutablex.medium.com/important-announcement-imx-alpha-rewards-update-929f7bc89513)\\n* [USDC Rewards for US Participants](https://bit.ly/389EthY)\\n\\n**Reward Claim Activation Date: [5 November 2021](https://twitter.com/Immutable/status/1456504261005627395)**\\n\\n# Non-US Reward Claim Process\\n\\nAfter the campaign ends, we will activate the claim process.
