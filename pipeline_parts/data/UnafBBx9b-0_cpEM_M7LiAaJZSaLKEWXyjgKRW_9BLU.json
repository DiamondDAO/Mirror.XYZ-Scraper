"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"im fairly new here and figured i should introduce myself. i first fell into this rabbit hole by the gentle push of a friend named cooper, who advised me against creating and launching an alt-coin (i did it anyway) and i watched it rise and fall faster than goliath at magic mountain. but something hooked me. the electricity in the community that amassed was palpable even through my computer screen, i would wake up every day to hundreds of messages by strangers from all across the world all centered around my silly little idea. it may not have accomplished what id envisioned entirely, but it did serve a different and ultimately more valuable purpose in redirecting the trajectory of my life.\\n\\ni make music. ive been captivated by it since before my voice dropped and itâ€™s been the molten core of my life ever since. i always loved learning about the technicalities of production, which in its own right is also a bottomless rabbit hole. but i needed balance. music is universally ingested but selfishly manufactured, in a room alone with a head full of emotions. i wanted to build something WITH people that shared the passion i did, and web3 revealed itself to fit exactly that craving i was looking to satiate. \\n\\nas i leaned into web3 more and more i found a seemingly endless line of insightful and curious mentors that apparently thrive off of being helpful. they always had time to answer my entry level questions, and be nba grade backboards for my ever growing string of ideas. after putting out a few nft projects of my own i realized i wanted to take that passion for community and apply it to the space. and now here we are, putting love on the blockchain.\\n\\nsee you in the metaverse\\n\\ngrady\",\"timestamp\":1634774990,\"title\":\"grady has entered the chat\"},\"digest\":\"u9ERKJ_HfdoL0xw4NyLzrZM4Fu4DfPowsk2VR5g1gZc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xe6445bd1d9674fE7fbEdAD2F56F3B1eAEA1b029e\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Zpi1SR6_mkoDapC-MEHoP4z2TF8_eKXwJ_fre7sEvzk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Pn_ufr8xWrC-vj2DFT7OQ9_XY5XHP8gHx0R9Eat3qyA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"JKTj7iRS17nrDsLYnCnc3PD-bXIgeHMH6XPDqFIuQkC19tG5qVPC-MVRG2wtpgWRVYzQc5Fhd_lD95hKqNrRFQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x64769d60d3e2c1a6611edd395c9dc230765ec179215bd0f6301e84bcd8644bec43a102f2285d1aeaa2b76c5cea0dd4bd500eec8bbb196ce74b4cb220ab2481ac1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Zpi1SR6_mkoDapC-MEHoP4z2TF8_eKXwJ_fre7sEvzk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Pn_ufr8xWrC-vj2DFT7OQ9_XY5XHP8gHx0R9Eat3qyA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"u9ERKJ_HfdoL0xw4NyLzrZM4Fu4DfPowsk2VR5g1gZc\"}"
