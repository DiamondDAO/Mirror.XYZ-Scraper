"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"2917 Earth, The Necklace\\n\\nThe Grand Ball marked an end to the latest crisis, the \\\"Decay of the DeepShips\\\", sparked by the tragic accidental deaths of a salvage crew in the Asteroid Belt.\\n\\nContractors would renovate an armada of forgotten ships made from asteroids. It would be touted as a \\\"pro-Great Upload\\\" program. One DeepShip, renovated, was in orbit, on Earth's \\\"Necklace\\\" for a party.\\n\\nThe Praetor was coming. Jacob C. Tagore, Jr. was meeting her in private, far from the party. The room was stealth modified. He was alone.\\n\\n\\\"Praetor, it's an honor. The private keys have been secured, the Mars Trade Association is satisfied, and we thank you for your support of this work.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think we know why we're both meeting... Jacob.\\\"\\n\\nJacob was trained to handle surprise. The military grade nanos in his body kept him focused. He prepared himself for a fight.\\n\\n\\\"When and how did you know?\\\" His cover was blown, and he was concerned for his team.\\n\\n\\\"It was very recent. It’s just me. None of the rest of the Triumvirate know. Your father was a hero. I regret the loss of his son, the \\\"first\\\" Jacob Junior. Your older brother died years before you were born, in a weapons test....”\\n\\n\\\"Your father's work, manifold technology. Something went wrong near the end of the Long War.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The deaths affected Father's judgment. He used to be more logical but that all changed after the Commander's son lost his life. I used that failed test to help save many others and end the war. After the war, father changed.”\\n\\n\\\"Some say you used it to take over, and create the Triumvirate. You may end up killing everyone.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I was created by my father to win. And that is just what I did, given the circumstances. The war would have dragged on and killed billions more if we allowed it. The rumors about the Great Upload are incomplete. There are risks for a change of this scale but there always are. Acceptable risks.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You still killed a lot of people since. You killed most of your own family.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That was due to the Enforcers' zeal. I gave the orders for house arrest when Father was resisting. I learned to accept what happened.”\\n\\n\\\"And you killed again, when you caught your father on the run, years later.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My father was a deluded man, and chose to end his life, and take the life of those sent to apprehend him. Nobody made him start that fire.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's not how I see it. That's not how AL sees it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"AL? Ah yes, \\\"AL\\\", of course. Where is ALEP-H? Where is my brother?\\\"\\n\\nJacob thought of his Uncle AL, formerly \\\"Automated Learning Entity prototype, Series H\\\".\\n\\nJacob didn't answer. He blew the charges and the room burst into violent light, opened to the vacuum of space. Other charges blew around the \\\"safe room\\\" and took out the enforcers.\\n\\nJacob thought about his father as he remembered him when Jacob was 10.\\n\\nAnd of Uncle AL, of June, and the others. Of his team. The Director who took him in. Then he lost consciousness, prepared to die.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QGaJf2ra4SfWG6i71P0Dz.png?height=2400&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633901970,\"title\":\"1961: 5.27 Party At The End of The World, 2917\"},\"digest\":\"_WPjbeT9rFoMQp5_WXf0mBg5k7I1BsCQsoswAAolue0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"y9F7LuMYPM9pZfBHajxHaPg6lW_ZnNmECENId2g9PgvnOiCv-Nf1Zx7jwEfwpkbAXonJG6WRixiIttOInxvmRQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"_WPjbeT9rFoMQp5_WXf0mBg5k7I1BsCQsoswAAolue0\"}"
