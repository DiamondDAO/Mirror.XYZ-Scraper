"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"And your head, Citizen Chauvelin,\\\" concluded Robespierre.\\n\\n\\\"Nay! I know that well enough, and you may believe me, and you will, Citizen, when I say that I care but little about that. The question is, if I am to lure that man to France what will you and your government do to help me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Everything,\\\" replied Robespierre, \\\"provided you have a definite plan and a definite purpose.\\n\\n\\\"I have both. But I must go to England in, at least, a semi-official capacity. I can do nothing if I am to hide in disguise in out-of-the- way corners.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is easily done. There has been some talk with the British authorities anent the security and welfare of peaceful French subjects settled in England. After a good deal of correspondence they have suggested our sending a semi-official representative over there to look after the interests of our own people commercially and financially. We can easily send you over in that capacity if it would suit your purpose.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Admirably. I have only need of a cloak. That one will do as well as another.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is that all?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not quite. I have several plans in my head, and I must know that I am fully trusted. Above all, I must have power--decisive, absolute, illimitable power.\\\"\\n\\nThere was nothing of the weakling about this small, sable-clad man, who looked the redoubtable Jacobin leader straight in the face and brought a firm fist resolutely down upon the table before him. Robespierre paused a while ere he replied; he was eying the other man keenly, trying to read if behind that earnest, frowning brow there did not lurk some selfish, ulterior motive along with that demand for absolute power.\\n\\nBut Chauvelin did not flinch beneath that gaze which could make every cheek in France blanch with unnamed terror, and after that slight moment of hesitation Robespierre said quietly:\\n\\n\\\"You shall have the complete power of a military dictator in every town or borough of France which you may visit. The Revolutionary Government shall create you, before you start for England, Supreme Head of all the Sub-Committees of Public Safety. This will mean that in the name of the safety of the Republic every order given by you, of whatsoever nature it might be, must be obeyed implicitly under pain of an arraignment for treason.\\\"\\n\\nChauvelin sighed a quick, sharp sigh of intense satisfaction, which he did not even attempt to disguise before Robespierre.\\n\\n\\\"I shall want agents,\\\" he said, \\\"or shall we say spies? and, of course, money.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You shall have both. We keep a very efficient secret service in England and they do a great deal of good over there. There is much dissatisfaction in their Midland counties--you remember the Birmingham riots? They were chiefly the work of our own spies. Then you know Candeille, the actress? She had found her way among some of those circles in London who have what they call liberal tendencies. I believe they are called Whigs. Funny name, isn't it? It means perruque, I think. Candeille has given charity performances in aid of our Paris poor, in one or two of these Whig clubs, and incidentally she has been very useful to us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A woman is always useful in such cases. I shall seek out the Citizeness Candeille.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And if she renders you useful assistance, I think I can offer her what should prove a tempting prize. Women are so vain!\\\" he added, contemplating with rapt attention the enamel-like polish on his finger- nails. \\\"There is a vacancy in the Maison Moliere. Or--what might prove more attractive still--in connection with the proposed National fete, and the new religion for the people, we have not yet chosen a Goddess of Reason. That should appeal to any feminine mind. The impersonation of a goddess, with processions, pageants, and the rest. ... Great importance and prominence given to one personality. ... What say you, Citizen? If you really have need of a woman for the furtherance of your plans, you have that at your disposal which may enhance her zeal.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I thank you, Citizen,\\\" rejoined Chauvelin calmly. \\\"I always entertained a hope that some day the Revolutionary Government would call again on my services. I admit that I failed last year. The Englishman is resourceful. He has wits and he is very rich. He would not have succeeded, I think, but for his money --and corruption and bribery are rife in Paris and on our coasts. He slipped through my fingers at the very moment when I thought that I held him most securely. I do admit all that, but I am prepared to redeem my failure of last year, and ... there is nothing more to discuss.--I am ready to start.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1636532216,\"title\":\"And your head\"},\"digest\":\"emtWD4UOGmwTj7sEbrFFSHZX4x62mpbXgnExrQ5oPpg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xb58Fb3bc38b2ACb99CcfBc6A4e3223f798F927DE\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JuGy4Uh6GlvW-RLUBKftDN9Skeps30sBqLrkE2EyI0Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"M0OcZAIUCIQkH8xE0PTHTeEAnmxtEIpKKhgxhGY8B_A\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"f9ormTYtlsjrGbIPPDTiqyGm52LkwLPZA9mSB97O9oyjxxwXba7X0Cski630bY8yKxZMBokyo_DHSaxdpSfbWA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9214f3729524f94e2062f5790faa8a88affb02b5555289c1d85d10ba9215c49f0f1bc19745328a9bc96df3b4e76dd730606799ba743dfa63473ee4b9af5789281c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JuGy4Uh6GlvW-RLUBKftDN9Skeps30sBqLrkE2EyI0Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"M0OcZAIUCIQkH8xE0PTHTeEAnmxtEIpKKhgxhGY8B_A\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"emtWD4UOGmwTj7sEbrFFSHZX4x62mpbXgnExrQ5oPpg\"}"
