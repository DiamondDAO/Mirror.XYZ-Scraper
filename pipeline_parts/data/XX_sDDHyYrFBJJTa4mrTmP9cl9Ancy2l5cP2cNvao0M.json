No, these students were in my class several years ago. My kids. Any teacher will tell you that this is how it works.\\n\\nWhen a student comes into my classroom, I tell them they have a lifetime warranty on their experience as my student. Struggling in college? Call. Need a reference? Email. Want to meet up for an in-person pep-talk? Text.\\n\\nMany do.\\n\\nI’ve attended college graduations and weddings and baby showers and birthday parties to celebrate them. I’ve held their brand new babies. I’ve let toddlers waddle across the colored tiles in my classroom as their parents fill me in on their adult lives. I’ve met them for brunches, lunches, dinners, and coffees. I’ve scheduled their appointments with therapists and talked them through post-college crises.\\n\\nI tell them to call. Many do.\\n\\nThe ones who don’t are the ones who linger in my mind. They’re the ones I wonder about on some random cloudy afternoon as I drive down Interstate 5, my mind wandering to the crystal-clear centers of otherwise foggy memories: the stickers they carefully arranged on their water bottle or the playfully doodled notes they left on their assignments or the tears they shed as they sat in my classroom and cried over a break-up.\\n\\nIn sixteen years of teaching, I have yet to be able to convey the depth of the care I feel for my students. Every day they sit in front of me, vulnerable in their roles as learners, trusting me to guide them in a manner that will make them feel valued and capable. It’s the greatest responsibility of my life.\\n\\nI just wish they knew.\\n\\nI wish they knew that I root for them as I grade their essays.\\n\\nI wish they knew that I see their pain on a bad day, the pain they try to hide behind a hoodie, and I cross my fingers, hoping that the next time I see them, the hood will be down and the smile will be back.\\n\\nI wish they knew that I see them vying for acceptance every day, earnestness sparking quietly in their eyes, even as they work so heartbreakingly hard to make it seem like they don’t care what anyone else thinks.\\n\\nI wish they knew how often they make me laugh — even when I have to hide it.\\n\\nI wish they knew just how much they’re capable of accomplishing — especially when they have resigned themselves to the fate of being “bad” in school.\\n\\nI wish they knew how much I love the notes they leave for me — on assignments, on the whiteboard, and on post-its. The crooked smiley faces and the silly jokes are fuel for another day.\\n\\nI wish they knew that I carry their successes and failures with me long after the final bell of the day.\\n\\nI wish they knew that I cross my fingers and toes for them on graduation day. That I hope post-high school life is everything they hope it will be and more. That if I could pave the road they’re about to travel to glass-like smoothness, I would. But I can’t and I know it’s for the best.\\n\\nI wish my students knew how much I think about them after they leave me. I wish they knew how proud I am when they become mothers, fathers, teachers, nurses, lawyers, mechanics, firefighters, baristas, artists, welders, problem-solvers, soul-searchers, world-travelers, or whatever it is that fills them with a sense of their own tremendous worth.\\n\\nI try to tell them these things— explicitly first — and then through my actions. I talk to them every single day. I try to cultivate silly little inside jokes with them. I tell them I’m glad they’ve come to class — even when they’re 30 minutes late. I invite them to stay after school if they need help — or just a quiet place to work. I encourage them to join the clubs I advise, and I tell them I miss them on the days that they’re gone.\\n\\nI lost two students last month. Gone forever. Two truncated sentences in what should have been two full-length stories of vivacity and accomplishment.\\n\\nI can’t help but wonder if they knew the richness they added to *my *life.\\n\\nI hope they did.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1640445231,\"title\":\"Things I Wish My Students Knew - Ellie Reaves - Medium\"},\"digest\":\"XopufNQaIDF_DTrFa2pptUefCl7iaczeQUp32KCoGw0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xaA368adD4d9a471036b1F0d421373fa4202bC04c\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fux1uvS2thm-QZTFd7CoXbbna390Aw3UnmGOY4vCerA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"vMPcOkC9shQVxXUz8uzZMSm8bT2vWcSpRuFCe6j3Phg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"RyoK_2PSVis0mZblSPsbb992k99H04Z7sYN2Qly0sEgKd_K78QQ6jUaHEDDHdyFemDzG0NdY8vRB4tcP_Z3CxA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x662f7a810d1210872852cf0659211d1fb0c39a006332459477e58a340a4222ca4f760f2fe62ae8026b6fa2c5e6ffec5fbf37e9e0b4cc39e47ced3ac44508b9931b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fux1uvS2thm-QZTFd7CoXbbna390Aw3UnmGOY4vCerA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"vMPcOkC9shQVxXUz8uzZMSm8bT2vWcSpRuFCe6j3Phg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"XopufNQaIDF_DTrFa2pptUefCl7iaczeQUp32KCoGw0\"}"
