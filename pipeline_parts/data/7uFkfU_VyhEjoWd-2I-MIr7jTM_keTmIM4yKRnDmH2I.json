Why is a observation period** **necessary for REI Network mainnet launch? How long will it take?**Â \\n\\nA: In order to provide developers with a more stable development environment and a smoother experience for users, REI Network will reserve a BUG Bounty for 0-3 months at the beginning of its launch, and invite outstanding developers to find out bugs on the chain with rewards. During the public beta period, REI's ecosystem cooperation and rebrand will be carried out as planned. The public beta period is about 0-3 months, and the specifics will be determined according to the progress of the network development.  For detailed progress, please follow the official channels of REI Network.\\n\\n**2. Does REI Network start to swap its token as soon as the mainnet is launched?**\\n\\nA: The token swap has not yet started after the mainnet is launched. We will start the token exchange after the end of the public beta observation period, under the premise of ensuring network security.\\n\\n**3. When will the REI Network mainnet token swap start?**\\n\\nA: Please refer to the announcement from the crypto exchange for the GXC token in crypto exchanges, and refer to the announcement from the REI Network official for the GXC token in the GXC wallet.\\n\\n**4.

How many chains will exist after REI Network Mainnet launch?**\\n\\nA: REI Network is a chain. In the initial stage, taking the interests of those who have staked on GXChain into account, the GXChain will keep running for about half a year (the longest GXChain staking period is 6 months), and GXChain will be suspended after half a year, thus only REI Network will remain.\\n\\n**7. Will the username/wallet address be updated at the same time?**\\n\\nA: Because GXChain and REI Network adopt different underlying technologies and different private key generation methods, the username of the GXChain wallet will not be applied to REI Network, and the wallet will be updated at the same time.\\n\\n**8. How to swap GXC tokens in other wallets into REI tokens?**\\n\\nA: GXC token in other wallets needs to be transferred to GXC Wallet first, and then exchanged and split through the official converter.\\n\\n**9.
