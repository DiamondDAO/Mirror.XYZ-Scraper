This essay surveys:\\nFunctionalities of the non-custodial wallet;\\nWhy the user cares about it;\\nAvailable options provided to the user in existing wallet products;\\nMost importantly, what does/would a best-in-class implementation look like.\\n\\nA non-custodial wallet is the default entry point to all crypto financial services; allowing the user to access them all in one place is extremely powerful. Excelling on all possible functionalities and experiences convinces the user to stay.\\nThe functionalities range in three categories:\\nTechnical properties: Features of the wallet components defined by implementation details.\\nProvided services: The financial services that a wallet can provide to the user. These are the reasons people want to use a wallet.\\nUser experiences: Aspects of a wallet experience that makes it seamless, intuitive and magical to use.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nTechnical Properties\\nSecurity\\nWhy: The user cares about the robustness of the wallet architecture, libraries, implementation to secure the key storage, which controls full custody of the assets.\\n\\n1. Options set:\\n   Key storage: in browser (e.g. chrome extension wallets, encrypted by password), in software (e.g. file in Apple Secure Enclave), in hardware, bring-your-keys (software wallet interface with hardware support).\\n   Key control: single-sig, multi-sig (multiple shards of the keys stored).\\n   Access control: whether it uses a second factor (e.g. NFC, USB).\\n   Trade-off with fee savings (using Layer 2) and usability.\\n\\nPrivacy\\nWhy: The user cares about being fingerprinted on a public blockchain based on the activities.\\nOptions set:\\n\\nFull node vs. light client.\\nTor network.\\n\\nLatest protocol releases\\nWhy: The user wants to take advantage of the latest network upgrades that unlocks features such as fee savings, privacy and securing the token networks.\\n\\n1.
