"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Essentially, a P2P system is maintained by users in a distributed network. Generally speaking, they do not have a central system administrator or server, because each node has a copy of the file - for other nodes it is equivalent to a user and a server. Therefore, each node can download files from other nodes or upload files to them. The client device of the traditional server system needs to download files from the central server. This is the difference between the P2P network and other traditional service systems.\\n\\nIn P2P networks, files shared by interconnected devices are stored on their hard drives. And use software applications to transfer shared data, users can also find and download files in other devices. If a user downloads a specified file, he can act as the source of the file.\\n\\nIn other words, when a node acts as a user, he has to download files from other nodes. But if he works as a server, other nodes can download files from him. In fact, these two functions can be performed at the same time (for example, downloading file A and uploading file B).\\n\\nSince every node can store, transmit and receive files, and as the user base of the P2P network gradually grows, it also becomes faster and more efficient. The distributed structure also makes the P2P system more resistant to network attacks. Unlike the traditional model, the P2P network does not have a single point of failure.\\n\\nAccording to its structure, we can classify P2P systems. The three main types are: unstructured peer-to-peer networks, structured peer-to-peer networks, and hybrid peer-to-peer networks.\",\"timestamp\":1636029045,\"title\":\"How P2P works\"},\"digest\":\"1oDLSeO6hiPgZPghkORfu7DmQGIBo53y75PQx_5OcOE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xaF26aD360E58A8447572B86412A085F11277806D\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3oDa5Rxsm0yRr1F-oNqZHWfiyCWG1yK4tZz6sDDtYIg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"j0JPOje4i_bkKt2SQiiiLfjrHyNXulAUfWsdP3n8Whk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"1jOivafFfy1oR7BToBKbmuy6cLZYEHJ4NERgiSS5kM6F_B81s0g21uPp2eX_GAbrtuCgA9OzPQt_hnpeVqMnZw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x63b20a91888ac47a18b31506560151516a66ee423962f84b6c9a170fb6579d196af63a96b73e03558b52f73c746f4b658460a31b134e052c56cdf22f345f64131b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3oDa5Rxsm0yRr1F-oNqZHWfiyCWG1yK4tZz6sDDtYIg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"j0JPOje4i_bkKt2SQiiiLfjrHyNXulAUfWsdP3n8Whk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"1oDLSeO6hiPgZPghkORfu7DmQGIBo53y75PQx_5OcOE\"}"
