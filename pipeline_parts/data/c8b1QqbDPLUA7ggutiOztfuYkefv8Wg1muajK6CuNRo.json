"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Before talking about the ideal world, let's first discuss the political system, economic systems, and ideology of the currently existing society.\\n\\nMany people think that the concept of the country has always existed. This is an illusion. The entire history of humanity has lasted millions of years from primitive society. However, the first country near the Nile River began to appear bout 5000 to 7000 years ago. In China, we all know that it was in the Xia Dynasty around the 21st century BC, right? Why did that country appear? And will it exist forever in the future? Let's think about this, the emergence of the country, this is the form of a tribe with dozens of people or hundreds of people in primitive society. At that time it was impossible for too many people to gather together. People were in the era of gathering and hunting, if too many people gathered together, there would not be enough food, so there is no conditions to form a country. With the emergence of the agricultural era, the energy density human could gather is much much higher. What does it mean? That is to say, compared to one hectare of forest with one hectare of cultivated land, no doubt cultivated land can feed more people. Therefore, human beings could make large-scale gatherings possible, and then cities and nations can be formed. So the forming of a country is related to technology. It’s the technology that determines the country, not technology determines the form of the country. So geopolitics has been around for thousands of years. However, In a longer time dimension, will it continue to exist?\\n\\nFirst of all, from the biological point of view, the current genetic sequencing and archaeology have fully proved that modern humans evolved from early Homo sapiens in Africa. We are the same in terms of blood relationships and genetics. No matter which country you are from, Whether it is black, brown, or white, everyone comes from a unified ancestor.\\n\\nFrom an economic perspective, Today, the civilization of industry and commerce have highly developed, we carried out an unparalleled global division of labor. Any commodity, like a mobile phone, a car, may have the American chip, the Japanese semiconductor included, and the Chinese assembled, right? Many products around us have already condensed the wisdom and labor of people from all over the world, so this is a global collaboration in the economy, which is integrated.\\n\\nThought and ideology. In history, due to differences in ideology, ideology, and religious beliefs, constant and endless conflicts, and killings have been causing. But for modern society, you can learn about different cultures and different thinking at your fingertips through the Internet. For example, many Chinese understand the way of thinking of Western countries, such as concepts like freedom, democracy, and equality. They also study Western political systems. Americans also study Chinese culture and political systems, right? So in terms of way of thinking, technology has laid the foundation for humans to understand and tolerate each other.\\n\\nBut currency, there is still no global integration. A philosopher said that the modern monetary system is the greatest slavery. The current monetary system has three problems:\\n\\n1. Inflation: The Federal Reserve dilutes people's wealth through continuous currency issuance. It is the eternal shackles on the people. In any country’s legal currency system, its genes are destined to be an inflation currency, and there is no solution for the inflation problem;\\n2. The inefficiency of cross-border transfers: the currencies of various countries in the world are not unified, the United States has the US dollar, China has the RMB, the Russian ruble, the Indian rupee, and so on. In the process of international economic and trade exchanges, the flow of money will be hindered and frictional. International remittances are time wasted and are costly. Currency has to go through different bank accounting systems, and there are foreign exchange settlement losses, many of which require manual processing. Therefore, after Qin Shihuang unified the six countries, the first thing to do was to unify weights and measures, unify currency, otherwise, it would be difficult to conduct transactions. Today, with the integration of the global economy and trade, we still do not have a unified currency.\\n3. The US dollar uses its currency status to isolate and sanction other countries. The US-led SWIFT system can exclude other countries’ banks from entering their system, preventing other countries from conducting normal trade with other countries. It even freezes the assets of other governments and enterprises. This type of event has occurred many times in history.\\n\\nWhen I learned about Bitcoin in 2013 for the first time, I instantly understood the problems that Bitcoin was trying to solve.\\n\\nAbove all, I just want to state that politics, economics, and thinking, and ideologies have been constantly changing. There are still a lot of problems in the current economic and political systems in the world. Our future generations will look back to our current political and economic systems in the future, and they will certainly ask why we use such a backward system.\\n\\nTherefore, the ideal society should be a society without discrimination against certain nationality, no political oppression, and no war anymore; regardless of religious and ethnic differences; currency is unified, without economic oppression and trade friction, economic rules are transparent and freely chosen by the people, A new world where everyone can realize their self-worth. Readers may think that this is just a dream, a Utopia that could never be achieved. Then I want to say that this solution has arrived, the answer is METAVERSE!\\n\\nIn METAVERSE, do people’s nationalities, races and religious beliefs matter? Is there any political oppression? Is there a METAVERSE police will arrest you and state that your remarks are contrary to the political purpose of METAVERSE? Does Cryptocurrency have national boundaries? Will anyone block you and prevent you from trading on ETH? Are the protocols of ETH, SOLANA, ICP, etc. transparent? Are you free to choose between different protocols, ETH, EOS, ICP, and other different chains? But in the real world, you can choose the nationality you like freely, right? In the Metaverse, there will be various divisions of labor soon. Everything in it needs us to build. like literary works, artistic works, the basic construction in the metaverse, the design and generation of various objects, and so on. There will be production, transactions, consumption, and social activities. Details will be discussed in the next chapter. Hopefully, everyone would find their place and belonging in the metaverse.\\n\\nIn summary, METAVERSE for the first time makes a perfect ideal world come true, which is in the minds of idealists for thousands of years. Mankind is about to enter a new era. The currency is unified, economic rules are transparent, there is no political oppression, regardless of nationality, religion, and race.
