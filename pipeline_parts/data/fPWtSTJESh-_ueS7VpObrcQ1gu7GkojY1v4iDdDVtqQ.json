However, when considering extreme scenarios, like a post-singularity world, or one that includes transhumanism, our concept of morality itself can break down (\\\"any moral rule followed to infinity will diverge from large parts of what we mean by morality\\\").\\n\\n## What key terms and distinctions are used in stating the reasons?\\na) Mediocrestani -- from Taleb; within the domain of the expected and ordinary. See [Taleb's Concepts of Mediocristan and Extremistan](https://people.wou.edu/~shawd/mediocristan--extremistan.html)\\n\\n## What central examples are used to illustrate the argument?\\nMediocrestani: \\n* Starting a Catholic hospital\\n* Stealing from the pool\\n\\nExtremistan:\\n* 1000-year reign of Christ and all non-believers go to hell\\n* The mass of the universe is covered by euphoric nervous tissue\\n\\n![](https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/tails5.png)\",\"timestamp\":1609126624,\"title\":\"Analysis: The Tails Coming Apart As Metaphor For Life\",\"publication\":\"g\"},\"digest\":\"8506b55d6dbee523fc6525d377ac7786709c7f44a3499a21d8b2806cb5418209\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xCC65fA278B917042822538c44ba10AD646824026\",\"signingKey\":\"-----BEGIN EC PUBLIC KEY-----\\r\\nMFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAE4fq+zRsvAYGFE4RYG4sz8mmgulJ4\\r\\n+uAN61xTRs4mD7VNuW/eekbe7D3THsWmh/xkd4G10YtYVp+FWnG+HunK/Q==\\r\\n-----END EC PUBLIC KEY-----\\r\\n\",\"signature\":\"FObzvzjxNL5PWXNtlnOCV9s5tlRT2TUQv3M0zue6fL9/Z8rf9uH0pFkLC4lcGlSSKXDdO6fXG/FiKGkjFUFuIw==\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x88d1a5f5aced3be27d48a1e095275987f0adc5a28046a999edd9f57841735ebd666df1cf0435cf78fec2179e0948f5bd49b0401a149c3008bfb24e34e4466d201b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on g.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n-----BEGIN EC PUBLIC KEY-----\\r\\nMFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAE4fq+zRsvAYGFE4RYG4sz8mmgulJ4\\r\\n+uAN61xTRs4mD7VNuW/eekbe7D3THsWmh/xkd4G10YtYVp+FWnG+HunK/Q==\\r\\n-----END EC PUBLIC KEY-----\\r\\n\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\"}"
