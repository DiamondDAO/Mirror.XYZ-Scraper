"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"He will not be content as long as he has a shadow of discontent left in his heart.  And how blessed is such holy discontent!  For, would you know, asks Law, who is the greatest saint in all the world?  Well, it is not he who prays most or fasts most; it is not he who gives most alms or is most eminent for temperance, chastity, or justice.  But it is he who is always thankful to God, who wills everything that God willeth, who receives everything as an instance of God's goodness, and has a heart always ready to praise God for it.  \\\"Perhaps the shepherd's boy,\\\" says Thomas Scott, \\\"may refer to the obscure and quiet stations of some pastors over small congregations, who live almost unknown to their brethren, but are in a measure useful and very comfortable.\\\"  Perhaps he does.  And, whether he does or no, at any rate such a song will suit some of our brethren very well as they go about among their few and far-off flocks.  They are not church leaders or popular preachers.  There is not much rattling with coaches or rumbling with wheels at their church door.  But, then, methinks, they have their compensation.  They are without much molestation.  They can be all the more thinking what they are, whence they came, and to what their King has called them.  Let them be happy in their shut-in valleys.  For I will dare to say that they wear more of that herb called Heart's-ease in their bosom than those ministers do they are sometimes tempted to emulate.  I will add in this place that to the men who live and trace these grounds the Lord hath left a yearly revenue to be faithfully paid them at certain seasons for their maintenance by the way, and for their further encouragement to go on in their pilgrimage.\\n\\nHere little, and hereafter bliss, Is best from age to age.\\n\\nBut, now, from the shepherd boy and from his valley and his song, let us go on without any more poetry or parable to look our own selves full in the face and to ask our own hearts whether they are the hearts of really humble-minded and New Testament men or no. Dr. Newman, \\\"that subtle, devout man,\\\" as Dr. Duncan calls him, says that \\\"humility is one of the most difficult of virtues both to attain and to ascertain.  It lies,\\\" he says, \\\"close upon the heart itself, and its tests are exceedingly delicate and subtle.  Its counterfeits abound.\\\"  Most true.  And yet humility is not intended for experts in morals only, or for men of a rare religious genius only.  The plainest of men, the least skilled and the most unlettered of men, may not only excel in humility, but may also be permitted to know that they are indeed planted, and are growing slowly but surely in that grace of all graces.  No doubt our Lord had, so to describe it, the most delicate and the most subtle of human minds; and, no doubt whatever, He had the most practised skill in reading off what lay closest to His own heart.  And, then, it was just His attainment of the most perfect humility, and then His absolute ascertainment of the same, that enabled Him to say: Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me.  At the same time, divine as the grace is, and divine as the insight is that is able to trace it out in all its exquisite refinements of thought and feeling in the sanctified soul, yet humility is a human virtue after all, and it is open to all men to attain to it and intelligently and lovingly to exercise it.  The simplest and the least philosophical soul now in this house may apply to himself some of the subtlest and most sensitive tests of humility, as much as if he were Dr. Duncan or Dr. Newman themselves; and may thus with all assurance of hope know whether he is a counterfeit and a castaway or no.\\n\\nTake this test for one, then.  Explain this text to me:  Phil. ii. 3--\\\"In lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than himself.\\\"  Explain and illustrate that.  Not from a commentary, but straight out from your own heart.  What does your heart make of that scripture?  Does your heart turn away from that scripture almost in anger at it?  Do you say you are certain that there must be some other explanation of it than that?  Do you hold that this is just another of Paul's perpetual hyperboles, and that the New Testament is the last book in the world to be taken as it reads? Yes; both bold and subtle father that he is:  counterfeits abound!\\n\\nAnother much blunter test, but, perhaps, a sufficiently sharp test, is this:  How do you receive correction and instruction?  Does your heart meekly and spontaneously and naturally take to correction and instruction as the most natural and proper thing possible to you? And do you immediately, and before all men, show forth and exhibit the correction and the instruction?  Or, does this rather take place?  Does your heart beat, and swell, and boil, and boil over at him who dares to correct or counsel you?  If this is a fair test to put our humility to, how little humility there is among us!  How few men any of us could name among our friends to whom we would risk telling all the things that behind their backs we point out continually to others?  We are terrified to face their pride.  We once did it, and we are not to do it again, if we can help it!  Let a man not have too many irons in the fire; let him examine himself just by these two tests for the time--what he thinks of himself, and what he thinks of those who attempt, and especially before other people, to set him right.  And after these two tests have been satisfied, others will no doubt be supplied till that so humble man is made very humility itself.\\n\\nAnd now, in the hope that there may be one or two men here who are really and not counterfeitly in earnest to clothe themselves with humility before God and man, let them take these two looms to themselves out of which whole webs of such garments will be delivered to them every day--their past life, and their present heart.  With a past life like ours, my brethren--and everyman knows his own--pride is surely the maddest state of mind that any of us can allow ourselves in.  The first king of Bohemia kept his clouted old shoes ever in his sight, that he might never forget that he had once been a ploughman.  And another wise king used to drink out of a coarse cup at table, and excused himself to his guests that he had made the rude thing in his rude potter days.  Look with Primislaus and Agathocles at the hole of the pit out of which you also have been dug; look often enough, deep enough, and long enough, and you will be found passing up through the Valley of Humiliation singing:\\n\\n\\\"With us He dealt not as we sinn'd, Nor did requite our ill!\\\"\\n\\nAnother excellent use of the past is, if you are equal to it, to call yourself aloud sometimes, or in writing, some of the names that other people who know your past are certainly calling you.  It is a terrible discipline, but it is the terror of the Lord, and He will not let it hurt you too much.  I was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious, says Paul.  And, to show Titus, his gospel-son, the way, he said to him:  We ourselves were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.  And John Bunyan calls himself a blackguard, and many other worse names; only he swears that neither with his soldiering nor with his tinkering hands did he ever plash down Beelzebub's orchard.  But if you have done that, or anything like that, call yourself aloud by your true name on your knees to-night.  William Law testifies, after five-and-twenty years' experience of it, that he never heard of any harm that he had done to any in his house by his habit of singing his secret psalms aloud, and sometimes, ere ever he was aware, bursting out in his penitential prayers.\\n\\nAnd, then, how any man with a man's heart in his bosom for a single day can escape being the chief of sinners, and consequently the humblest of men for all the rest of his life on earth, passes my comprehension!  How a spark of pride can live in such a hell as every human heart is would be past belief, did we not know that God avenges sin by more sin; avenges Himself on a wicked and a false heart by more wickedness and more falsehood, all ending in Satanic pride.\\n\\nToo long as I have kept you in this valley to-night, I dare not let you out of it till I have shared with you a few sentences on evangelical humiliation out of that other so subtle and devout man, Jonathan Edwards.  But what special kind of humiliation is evangelical humiliation? you will ask.  Hear, then, what this master in Israel says.  \\\"Evangelical humiliation is the sense that a Christian man has of his own utter insufficiency, utter despicableness, and utter odiousness; with an always answerable frame of heart.  This humiliation is peculiar to the true saints. It arises from the special influence of the Spirit of God implanting and exercising supernatural and divine principles; and it is accompanied with a sense of the transcendent beauty of divine things.  And, thus, God's true saints all more or less see their own odiousness on account of sin, and the exceedingly hateful nature of all sin.  The very essence of evangelical humiliation consists in such humility as becomes a man in himself exceeding sinful but now under a dispensation of grace.  It consists in a mean esteem of himself, as in himself nothing, and altogether contemptible and odious.  This, indeed, is the greatest and the most essential thing in true religion.\\\"  And so on through a whole chapter of beaten gold.  To which noble chapter I shall only add that such teaching is as sweet, as strengthening, and as reassuring to the truly Christian heart as it is bitter and hateful to the counterfeit heart.\\n\\nOLD HONEST\\n\\n\\\"An honest heart.\\\"--Our Lord.\\n\\nNext tell them of Old Honest, who you found With his white hairs treading the pilgrim's ground; Yea, tell them how plain-hearted this man was, How after his good Lord he bare his cross: Perhaps with some grey head this may prevail, With Christ to fall in love, and sin bewail.\\n\\nYou would have said that no pilgrim to the Celestial City could possibly have come from a worse place, or a more unlikely place, than was that place from which Christian and Christiana and Matthew and Mercy had come.  And yet so it was.  For Old Honest, this most excellent and every way most delightful old saint, hailed from a far less likely place than even the City of Destruction.  For he came, this rare old soul, of all places in the world, from the Town of Stupidity.  So he tells us himself.  And, partly to explain to us the humiliating name of his native town, and partly to exhibit himself as a wonder to many, the frank old gentleman goes on to tell us that his birthplace actually lies four degrees further away from the sun than does the far-enough away City of Destruction itself.  So that you see this grey-haired saint is all that he always said he was--a living witness to the fact that his Lord is able to save to the uttermost, and to gather in His Father's elect from the utmost corner of the land.  Men are mountains of ice in my country, said Old Honest.  I was one of the biggest of those icebergs myself, he said.  No man was ever more cold and senseless to divine things than I was, and still sometimes am.  It takes the Sun of Righteousness all His might to melt the men of my country. But that He can do it when He rises to do it, and when He puts out His full strength to do it--Look at me! said the genial old soul.\\n\\nWe have to construct this pilgrim's birth and boyhood and youth from his after-character and conversation; and we have no difficulty at all in doing that.  For, if the child is the father of the man, then the man must be the outcome of the child, and we can have no hesitation in picturing to ourselves what kind of child and boy and young man dear Old Honest must always have been.  He never was a bright child, bright and beaming old man as he is.  He was always slow and heavy at his lessons; indeed, I would not like to repeat to you all the bad names that his schoolmasters sometimes in their impatience called the stupid child.  Only, this was to be said of him, that dulness of uptake and disappointment of his teachers were the worst things about this poor boy; he was not so ill-behaved as many were who were made more of.  When his wits began to waken up after he had come some length he had no little leeway to make up in his learning; but that was the chief drawback to Old Honest's pilgrimage.  For one thing, no young man had a cleaner record behind him than our Honest had; his youthful garments were as unspotted as ever any pilgrim's garments were. Even as a young man he had had the good sense to keep company with one Good-conscience; and that friend of his youth kept true to Old Honest all his days, and even lent him his hand and helped him over the river at last.  In his own manly, hearty, blunt, breezy, cheery, and genial way Old Honest is a pilgrim we could ill have spared.  Old Honest has a warm place all for himself in every good and honest heart.\\n\\n\\\"Now, a little before the pilgrims stood an oak, and under it when they came up to it they found an old pilgrim fast asleep; they knew that he was a pilgrim by his clothes and his staff and his girdle. So the guide, Mr. Greatheart, awaked him, and the old gentleman, as he lifted up his eyes, cried out:  What's the matter?  Who are you? And what is your business here?  Come, man, said the guide, be not so hot; here is none but friends!  Yet the old man gets up and stands upon his guard, and will know of them what they are.\\\"  That weather-beaten oak-tree under which we first meet with Old Honest is an excellent emblem of the man.  When he sat down to rest his old bones that day he did not look out for a bank of soft moss or for a bed of fragrant roses; that knotted oak-tree alone had power to draw down under its sturdy trunk this heart of human oak.  It was a sight to see those thin grey haffets making a soft pillow of that jutting knee of gnarled and knotty oak, and with his well-worn quarterstaff held close in a hand all wrinkled skin and scraggy bone.  And from that day till he waved his quarterstaff when half over the river and shouted, Grace reigns! there is no pilgrim of them all that affords us half the good humour, sagacity, continual entertainment, and brave encouragement we enjoy through this same old Christian gentleman.\\n\\n1. Now, let us try to learn two or three lessons to-night from Old Honest, his history, his character, and his conversation.  And, to begin with, let all those attend to Old Honest who are slow in the uptake in the things of religion.  O fools and slow of heart! exclaimed our Lord at the two travellers to Emmaus.  And this was Old Honest to the letter when he first entered on the pilgrimage life; he was slow as sloth itself in the things of the soul.  I have often wondered, said Greatheart, that any should come from your place; for your town is worse than is the City of Destruction itself.  Yes, answered Honest, we lie more off from the sun, and so are more cold and senseless.  And his biographer here annotates on the margin this reflection:  \\\"Stupefied ones are worse than merely carnal.\\\"  So they are; though it takes some insight to see that, and some courage to carry that through.  Now, to be downright stupid in a man's natural intellects is sad enough, but to be stupid in the intellects of the soul and of the spirit is far more sad.  You will often see this if you have any eyes in your head, and are not one of the stupid people yourself.  You will see very clever people in the intellects of the head who are yet as stupid as the beasts in the stall in the far nobler intellects of the heart.  You will meet every day with men and women who have received the best college education this city can give them, who are yet stark stupid in everything that belongs to true religion. They are quick to find out the inefficiency of a university chair, or a schoolmaster's desk, but they know no more of what a New Testament pulpit has been set up for than the stupidest sot in the city.  The Divine Nature, human nature, sin, grace, redemption, salvation, holiness, heart-corruption, spiritual life, prayer, communion with God, a conversation and a treasure in heaven,--to all these noblest of studies and divinest of exercises they are as a beast before God.  When you come upon a man who is a sot in his senses and in his understanding, you expect him to be the same in his spiritual life.  But to meet with an expert in science, a classical scholar, an author or a critic in letters, a leader in political or ecclesiastical or municipal life, and yet to discover that he is as stupid as any sot in the things of his own soul, is one of the saddest and most disheartening sights you can see.  Much sadder and much more disheartening than to see stairs and streets of people who can neither read nor write.  And yet our city is full of such stupid people.  You will find as utter spiritual stupidity among the rich and the lettered and the refined of this city as you will find among the ignorant and the vicious and the criminal classes.  Is stupidity a sin? asks Thomas in his Forty-Sixth Question.  And the great schoolman answers himself, \\\"Stupidity may come of natural incapacity, in which case it is not a sin.  But it may come, on the other hand, of a man immersing his soul in the things of this world so as to shut out all the things of God and of the world to come, in which case stupidity is a deadly sin.\\\"  Now, from all that, you must already see what you are to do in order to escape from your inborn and superinduced stupidity.  You are, like Old Honest, to open your gross, cold, senseless heart to the Sun of Righteousness, and you are to take care every day to walk abroad under His beams.  You are to emigrate south for your life, as our well-to-do invalids do, to where the sun shines in his strength all the day.  You are to choose such a minister, buy and read such a literature, cultivate such an acquaintanceship, and follow out such a new life of habits and practices as shall bring you into the full sunshine, till your heart of ice is melted, and your stupefied soul is filled with spiritual sensibility.  For, were a man a mountain of ice,\\\" said Old Honest, \\\"yet if the Sun of Righteousness will arise upon him his frozen heart shall feel a thaw; and thus hath it been with me.\\\"  Your poets and your philosophers have no resource against the stupidity that opposes them.  \\\"Even the gods,\\\" they complain, \\\"fight unvictorious against stupidity.\\\"  But your divines and your preachers have hope beside the dullest and the stupidest and even the most imbruted.  They point themselves and their slowest and dullest-witted hearers to Old Honest, this rare old saint; and they set up their pulpit with hope and boldness on the very causeway of the town of Stupidity itself.\\n2. In the second place,--on this fine old pilgrim's birth and boyhood and youth.  The apostle says that there is no real difference between one of us and another; and what he says on that subject must be true.  No; there is really no difference compared with the Celestial City whether a pilgrim is born in Stupidity, in Destruction, in Vanity, or in Darkland.  At the same time, nature, as well as grace, is of God, and He maketh, when it pleaseth Him, one man to differ in some most important respects from another. You see such differences every day.  Some children are naturally, and from their very infancy, false and cruel, mean and greedy; while their brothers and sisters are open and frank and generous. One son in a house is born a vulgar snob, and one daughter a shallow-hearted and shameless little flirt; while another brother is a born gentleman, and another sister a born saint.  Some children are tender-hearted, easily melted, and easily moulded; while others in the same family are hard as stone and cold as ice. Sometimes a noble and a truly Christian father will have all his days to weep and pray over a son who is his shame; and then, in the next generation, a grandson will be born to him who will more than recover the lost image of his father's father.  And so is it sometimes with father Adam's family.  Here and there, in Darkland, in Destruction, and in Stupidity, a child will be born with a surprising likeness to the first Adam in his first estate.  That happy child at his best is but the relics and ruins of his first father; at the same time, in him the relics are more abundant and the ruins more easy to trace out.  And little Honest was such a well-born child.  For, Stupidity and all, there was a real inborn and inbred integrity, uprightness, straightforwardness, and nobleness about this little and not over-clever man-child.  And, on the principle of \\\"to him that hath shall be given,\\\" there was something like a special providence that hedged this boy about from the beginning.  \\\"I girded thee though thou hast not known Me\\\" was never out of Old Honest's mouth as often as he remembered the days of his own youth and heard other pilgrims mourning over theirs.  \\\"I have surnamed thee though thou hast not known Me,\\\" he would say to himself in his sleep.  Slow-witted as he was, no one had been able to cheat young Honest out of his youthful integrity.  He had not been led, and he had led no one else, into the paths of the destroyer.  He could say about himself all that John Bunyan so boldly and so bluntly said about himself when his enemies charged him with youthful immorality.  He left the town in nobody's debt. He left the print of his heels on no man or woman or child when he took his staff in his hand to be a pilgrim.  The upward walk of too many pilgrims is less a walk than an escape and a flight.  The avenger of men's blood and women's honour has hunted many men deep into heaven's innermost gate.  But Old Honest took his time.  He walked, if ever pilgrim walked, all the way with an easy mind.  He lay down to sleep under the oaks on the wayside, and smiled like a child in his sleep.  And, when he was suddenly awaked, instead of crying out for mercy and starting to his heels, he grasped his staff and demanded even of an armed man what business he had to break in on an honest pilgrim's mid-day repose!  The King of the Celestial City had a few names even in Stupidity which had not defiled their garments, and Old Honest was one of them.  And all his days his strength was as the strength of ten, because his heart was pure.\\n3. At the same time, honesty is not holiness; and no one knew that better than did this honest old saint.  When any one spoke to Old Honest about his blameless youth, the look in his eye made them keep at arm's-length as he growled out that without holiness no man shall see God!  Writing from Aberdeen to John Bell of Hentoun, Samuel Rutherford says:  \\\"I beseech you, in the Lord Jesus, to mind your country above; and now, when old age is come upon you, advise with Christ before you put your foot into the last ship and turn your back on this life.  Many are beguiled with this that they are free of scandalous sins.  But common honesty will not take men to heaven.  Alas! that men should think that ever they met with Christ who had never a sick night or a sore heart for sin.  I have known a man turn a key in a door and lock it by.\\\"  \\\"I can,\\\" says John Owen, \\\"and I do, commend moral virtues and honesty as much as any man ought to do, and I am sure there is no grace where they are not. Yet to make anything to be our holiness that is not derived from Jesus Christ,--I know not what I do more abhor.\\\"  \\\"Are morally honest and sober men qualified for the Lord's Supper?\\\" asks John Flavel.  \\\"No; civility and morality do not make a man a worthy communicant.  They are not the wedding garment; but regenerating grace and faith in the smallest measure are.\\\"  \\\"My outside may be honest,\\\" said this honest old pilgrim, \\\"while all the time my heart is most unholy.  My life is open to all men, but I must hide my heart with Christ in God.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1641293847,\"title\":\"\\nThe only thing this sweet singer is discontented with is his own contentment.\"},\"digest\":\"rU957hbZBklPsgfrlZgRNYOalShXRqz6dMubKlry6Bw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x601114c3e2cfa182D83a451a3c41d4e615b07E56\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nG6dVb_Q1oiQsC2cmsFgW3fqZDRwu9V9XFdxEvK7jPc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gdLbH8brdnltwCC0MHwHFKE3Yxz3Vft3bjBYB2qMNaI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"J_ZMhW6Ag052XLI93dH8H3DCzLnFoeOih5dZ8uXNlmkvkJabOTHisMT1BAz9myqbBQIZz1B01KooBrQqT8bHHQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4070ceacde1c4532d8eabae1e798fa86d8fe02dc4fda751cdfd3aff6af0695ff796147996005cfdb3cb06a1e04bb5224b87f928557fbfb00a877f631175cf4901c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nG6dVb_Q1oiQsC2cmsFgW3fqZDRwu9V9XFdxEvK7jPc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gdLbH8brdnltwCC0MHwHFKE3Yxz3Vft3bjBYB2qMNaI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rU957hbZBklPsgfrlZgRNYOalShXRqz6dMubKlry6Bw\"}"
