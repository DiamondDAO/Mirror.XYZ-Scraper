When you set up a new wallet, you are are given a 12 or 24 word “[seed phrase](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-seed-phrase#:\\\\~:text=A%20seed%20phrase%20is%20a,crypto%20associated%20with%20that%20wallet.&text=As%20long%20as%20you%20have,delete%20or%20lose%20the%20wallet.)”.\\n\\nThis string of words serves as the keys to the wallet. **The words must be spelled correctly, and arranged in the correct order to unlock the wallet.** You are NEVER supposed to share this phrase with anyone. *(Unless, as is true in this case, you actually WANT someone to steal the contents.)*\\n\\nI opted to use a 24 word phrase, hoping it might take longer to crack, and then warped and twisted each word into the design above.\\n\\nOnce completed, I used [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) to “mint” the piece (publish it as an NFT), then transferred it into the wallet accessible by that seed phrase where it will remain until stolen.\\n\\n## HOW TO GET YOUR HANDS ON IT\\n\\nKeeping things simple for this first piece, starting today clues will intermittently drop on [here on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TEKSTartist). *(Following is not mandatory, but individuals who follow **and have notifications turned on** will have a head start with each clue.)*\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JKg1Owk24sAqh1o4g13AG.png?height=180&width=604)\\n\\nWhoever manages to decipher the seed phrase, break into the wallet, and transfer the NFT (as well as any crypto that may happen to make its way in there) to themselves will win this contest/experiment and will become the rightful owner of the piece.\\n\\nWhat the new owner chooses to do with it (hold it, destroy it, even sell it) is entirely up to them, but then again… there may just be some perks to holding onto it. ;)\\n\\nThere are *far more ambitious* plans wth future PHRASE canvases, but for now, this genesis proof of concept should be a fun way to kick things off.\\n\\nGood luck!\\n\\n\\\\-Jaason.eth\",\"timestamp\":1639501698,\"title\":\"STEAL THIS NFT\"},\"digest\":\"2fZ3EKrUz8cx23pdlDG3wLVe6QvX717ZgX6SfBJfhnk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x35Eee1F835A08e4B0dF848197c4d377c23B79aE9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"iA4zDoSHY8YbY9O9-7O728ZFaOlS5G1hH5yywT-m1rU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"t4AwGfg-siBQeybgYxYHHJTyVFrJgDpXWA0BwjU1HeU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"coYJgSJBj46J0j7RwKDFXyPRTgWXK8x3hBMDSwK1tRMtBhGV-yEiQTIeyuvwcVoHsMTG-Go7KZb1vyoR_7SKpA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4ab9276dc30799fb9077f63990e2a5ea254e00a5ffac76f88007b0c8be178a6056576b2a1e290d0e432f3e8c2bf80d5915bb17d9eca852879f60f1e22be967c01c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"iA4zDoSHY8YbY9O9-7O728ZFaOlS5G1hH5yywT-m1rU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"t4AwGfg-siBQeybgYxYHHJTyVFrJgDpXWA0BwjU1HeU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"eqgO_ILWRmRDaKDsXkdDjR9jJM3xSQNySfsXDehV8w8\"}"
