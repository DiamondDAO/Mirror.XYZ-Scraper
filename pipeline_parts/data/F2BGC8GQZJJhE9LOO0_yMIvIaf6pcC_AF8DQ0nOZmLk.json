"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"If you want to have another enemy, lend him money\\n\\nI have never liked borrowing money from others, and I hate others borrowing money from me. If I have to lend money to others, I always have the mentality of giving others away. For example, if you give you 1,000 yuan, it's a small favor, and you don't need to pay it back. Basically, it will be difficult to become friends in the future.\\n\\nYou can help your friend in other ways, but don't lend him money. To lend him money is to buy an enemy for himself. The Jews are very good at doing business. Among the Jews, everyone is very good with each other, but when you want to borrow money, they rarely agree. It's not because they don't trust each other, but their shrewdness in the world.\\n\\nJews have a lot of self-esteem. They generally refuse to ask for help. Jews borrow money in life, which is different from what they borrow in business. If a person borrows money from his friends, it means that the person is already in a difficult time in life. When someone lends him money, he always feels uneasy, and feels embarrassed when he meets a friend, although the friend is still very close to him, even the person who borrows the money is not even aware of the embarrassment of the borrower. In order to avoid this feeling of guilt, borrowers generally avoid their friends, hoping to repay the money as soon as possible, so that they feel calm in front of their friends. With this kind of psychology, such a friendship will be due to money. Become very uncomfortable and make people feel uncomfortable. Therefore, the Jews tacitly reached a tacit agreement: not to lend money to their friends.\\n\\nIn fact, it’s the same between male and female friends. It’s best to be financially independent. If you lend money to each other, one of you will always feel owed, and one of you will feel noble. There are subtle changes, and these subtle changes can easily deteriorate the feelings.\",\"timestamp\":1634794608,\"title\":\"Focus on what you can do.\"},\"digest\":\"kx_8GJfpTZOfFGGfolgNUtTEthawSYtDZAxT5cHlYo8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"SNRMWwBMAIW4pwOIScY_5PN1qsGhL7YmUnHEmWQSwvcHNPnGIMaKGOkQnRqr93BM6Zy9ZfMBv0onOcNerIQ9eg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"kx_8GJfpTZOfFGGfolgNUtTEthawSYtDZAxT5cHlYo8\"}"
