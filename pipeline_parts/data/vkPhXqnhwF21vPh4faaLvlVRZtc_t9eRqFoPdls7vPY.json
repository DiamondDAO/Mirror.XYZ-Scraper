"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"That depends upon wind and weather,\\\" said the elf king; \\\"they\\n\\ntravel economically. They will come when there is the chance of a\\n\\nship. I wanted them to come over to Sweden, but the old man was not\\n\\ninclined to take my advice. He does not go forward with the times, and\\n\\nthat I do not like.\\\"\\n\\n```\\nTwo will-o'-the-wisps came jumping in, one quicker than the other,\\n```\\n\\nso of course, one arrived first. \\\"They are coming! they are coming!\\\"\\n\\nhe cried.\\n\\n```\\n\\\"Give me my crown,\\\" said the elf king, \\\"and let me stand in the\\n```\\n\\nmoonshine.\\\"\\n\\n```\\nThe daughters drew on their shawls and bowed down to the ground.\\n```\\n\\nThere stood the old goblin from the Dovre mountains, with his crown of\\n\\nhardened ice and polished fir-cones. Besides this, he wore a\\n\\nbear-skin, and great, warm boots, while his sons went with their\\n\\nthroats bare and wore no braces, for they were strong men.\\n\\n```\\n\\\"Is that a hill?\\\" said the youngest of the boys, pointing to the\\n```\\n\\nelf hill, \\\"we should call it a hole in Norway.\\\"\\n\\n```\\n\\\"Boys,\\\" said the old man, \\\"a hole goes in, and a hill stands\\n```\\n\\nout; have you no eyes in your heads?\\\"\\n\\n```\\nAnother thing they wondered at was, that they were able without\\n```\\n\\ntrouble to understand the language.\\n\\n```\\n\\\"Take care,\\\" said the old man, \\\"or people will think you have\\n```\\n\\nnot been well brought up.\\\"\\n\\n```\\nThen they entered the elfin hill, where the select and grand\\n```\\n\\ncompany were assembled, and so quickly had they appeared that they\\n\\nseemed to have been blown together. But for each guest the neatest and\\n\\npleasantest arrangement had been made. The sea folks sat at table in\\n\\ngreat water-tubs, and they said it was just like being at home. All\\n\\nbehaved themselves properly excepting the two young northern goblins;\\n\\nthey put their legs on the table and thought they were all right.\",\"timestamp\":1636531728,\"title\":\"That depends upon wind and weather\"},\"digest\":\"FZQdgJfl6e0bxBf5UTYCN7YhWR7pcQRlhzWKTkEX-0E\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD6FFaeE2D21c98999e3c40052687ea652b1411a9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1ZNGbA8hw50NqTEH60pjWtttAxTmj-O0q7ZAWIpIk0I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Epibr8SDl9ci73c4unNeA-8NllUfAXuSKPWIm6Niu6Y\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"VrF2LoMwpY3hFL4o2nx5kSh_WYyr_ENs7Sx_v0c2ItKG-rIQ0McttJQ3NgBXoJXYD8vcdOhrQ_GHAc5XRdGhqQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb13d364ecd5e04aa25ca6557de5d189f61a2cbb86427e42295a20a7b062a8d42191f967d5c21fc550f4cef070e74615201c656b41dc700c6e43dad71f764389b1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1ZNGbA8hw50NqTEH60pjWtttAxTmj-O0q7ZAWIpIk0I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Epibr8SDl9ci73c4unNeA-8NllUfAXuSKPWIm6Niu6Y\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"FZQdgJfl6e0bxBf5UTYCN7YhWR7pcQRlhzWKTkEX-0E\"}"
