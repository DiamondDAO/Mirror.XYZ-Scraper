"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"stuttered the unfortunate Leggett, in the short spurts of a winded man, a few stertorous syllables at a time.  \\\"Been up myself, my lord.  Bedroom door - dressing-room door - both locked inside!\\\"\\n\\nBut by this time the noble master was in worse case than the man. His fine forehead was a tangle of livid cords; his baggy jowl filled out like a balloon.  In another second he had abandoned his place as our host and fled the room; and in yet another we had forgotten ours as his guests and rushed headlong at his heels.\\n\\nRaffles was as excited as any of us now: he outstripped us all.  The cherubic little lawyer and I had a fine race for the last place but one, which I secured, while the panting butler and his satellites brought up a respectful rear.  It was our unconventional author, however, who was the first to volunteer his assistance and advice.\\n\\n\\\"No use pushing, Thornaby!\\\" cried he.  \\\"If it's been done with a wedge and gimlet, you may smash the door, but you'll never force it. Is there a ladder in the place?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There's a rope-ladder somewhere, in case of fire, I believe,\\\" said my lord vaguely, as he rolled a critical eye over our faces.  \\\"Where is it kept, Leggett?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"'William will fetch it, my lord.\\\"\\n\\nAnd a pair of noble calves went flashing to the upper regions.\\n\\n\\\"What's the good of bringing it down,\\\" cried Parrington, who had thrown back to the wilds in his excitement.  \\\"Let him hang it out of the window above your own, and let me climb down and do the rest!  I'll undertake to have one or other of these doors open in two twos!\\\"\\n\\nThe fastened doors were at right angles on the landing which we filled between us.  Lord Thornaby smiled grimly on the rest of us, when he had nodded and dismissed the author like a hound from the leash.\\n\\n\\\"It's a good thing we know something about our friend Parrington,\\\" said my lord.  \\\"He takes more kindly to all. this than I do, I can tell you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's grist to his mill,\\\" said Raffles charitably.\\n\\n\\\"Exactly!  We shall have the whole thing in his next book.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hope to have it at the Old Bailey first,\\\" remarked Kingsmill, Q.C.\\n\\n\\\"Refreshing to find a man of letters such a man of action too!\\\"\\n\\nIt was Raffles who said this, and the remark seemed rather trite for him, but in the tone there was a something that just caught my private ear.  And for once I understood: the officious attitude of Parrington, without being seriously suspicious in itself, was admirably calculated to put a previously suspected person in a grateful shade.  This literary adventurer had elbowed Raffles out of the limelight, and gratitude for the service was what I had detected in Raffles's voice.  No need to say how grateful I felt myself.  But my gratitude was shot with flashes of unwonted insight. Parrington was one of those who suspected Raffles, or, at all.  events, one who was in the secret of those suspicions.  What if he had traded on the suspect's presence in the house?  What if he were a deep villain himself, and the villain of this particular piece? I had made up my mind about him, and that in a tithe of the time I take to make it up as a rule, when we heard my man in the dressing-room.  He greeted us with an impudent shout; in a few moments the door was open, and there stood Parrington, flushed and dishevelled, with a gimlet in one hand and a wedge in the other.\\n\\nWithin was a scene of eloquent disorder.  Drawers had been pulled out, and now stood on end, their contents heaped upon the carpet. Wardrobe doors stood open; empty stud-cases strewed the floor; a clock, tied up in a towel, had been tossed into a chair at the last moment.  But a long tin lid protruded from an open cupboard in one corner.  And one had only to see Lord Thornaby's wry face behind the lid to guess that it was bent over a somewhat empty tin trunk.\\n\\n\\\"What a rum lot to steal!\\\" said he, with a twitch of humor at the corners of his canine mouth.  \\\"My peer's robes, with coronet complete!\\\"\\n\\nWe rallied round him in a seemly silence.  I thought our scribe would put in his word.  But even he either feigned or felt a proper awe.\\n\\n\\\"You may say it was a rum place to keep 'em,\\\" continued Lord Thornaby.  \\\"But where would you gentlemen stable your white elephants?  And these were elephants as white as snow; by Jove, I'll job them for the future!\\\"\\n\\nAnd he made merrier over his loss than any of us could have imagined the minute before; but the reason dawned on me a little later, when we all. trooped down-stairs, leaving the police in possession of the theatre of crime.  Lord Thornaby linked arms with Raffles as he led the way.  His step was lighter, his gayety no longer sardonic; his very looks had improved.  And I divined the load that had been lifted from the hospitable heart of our host.\\n\\n\\\"I only wish,\\\" said he, \\\"that this brought us any nearer to the identity of the gentleman we were discussing at dinner, for, of course, we owe it to all. our instincts to assume that it was he.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I wonder!\\\" said old Raffles, with a foolhardy glance at me.\\n\\n\\\"But I'm sure of it, my dear sir,\\\" cried my lord.  \\\"The audacity is his and his alone.  I look no further than the fact of his honoring me on the one night of the year when I endeavor to entertain my brother Criminologists.  That's no coincidence, sir, but a deliberate irony, which would have occurred to no other criminal mind in England.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You may be right,\\\" Raffles had the sense to say this time, though I flattered myself it was my face that made him.\\n\\n\\\"What is still more certain,\\\" resumed our host, \\\"is that no other criminal in the world would have crowned so delicious a conception with so perfect an achievement.  I feel sure the inspector will agree with us.\\\"\\n\\nThe policeman in command had knocked and been admitted to the library as Lord Thornaby spoke.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't hear what you said, my lord.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Merely that the perpetrator of this amusing outrage can be no other than the swell mobsman who relieved Lady Melrose of her necklace and poor Danby of half his stock a year or two ago.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I believe your lordship has hit the nail on the head.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The man who took the Thimblely diamonds and returned them to Lord Thimblely, you know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps he'll treat your lordship the same.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not he!  I don't mean to cry over my spilt milk.  I only wish the fellow joy of all. he had time to take.  Anything fresh up-stain by the way?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, my lord: the robbery took place between a quarter past eight and the half-hour.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How on earth do you know?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The clock that was tied up in the towel had stopped at twenty past.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have you interviewed my man?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have, my lord.  He was in your lordship's room until close on the quarter, and all. was as it should be when he left it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then do you suppose the burglar was in hiding in the house?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's impossible to say, my lord.  He's not in the house now, for he could only be in your lordship's bedroom or dressing-room, and we have searched every inch of both.\\\"\\n\\nLord Thornaby turned to us when the inspector had retreated, caressing his peaked cap.\\n\\n\\\"I told him to clear up these points first,\\\" he explained, jerking his head toward the door.  \\\"I had reason to think my man had been neglecting his duties up there.  I am glad to find myself mistaken.\\\"\\n\\nI ought to have been no less glad to see my own mistake.  My suspicions of our officious author were thus proved to have been as wild as himself.  I owed the man no grudge, and yet in my human heart I felt vaguely disappointed.  My theory had gained color from his behavior ever since he had admitted us to the dressing-room; it had changed all. at once from the familiar to the morose; and only now was I just enough to remember that Lord Thornaby, having tolerated those familiarities as long as they were connected with useful service, had administered a relentless snub the moment that service had been well and truly performed.\\n\\nBut if Parrington was exonerated in my mind, so also was Raffles reinstated in the regard of those who had entertained a far graver and more dangerous hypothesis.  It was a miracle of good luck, a coincidence among coincidences, which had white-washed him in their sight at the very moment when they were straining the expert eye to sift him through and through.  But the miracle had been performed, and its effect was visible in every face and audible in every voice. I except Ernest, who could never have been in the secret; moreover, that gay Criminologist had been palpably shaken by his first little experience of crime.  But the other three vied among themselves to do honor where they had done injustice.  I heard Kingsmill, Q.C., telling Raffles the best time to catch him at chambers, and promising a seat in court for any trial he might ever like to hear. Parrington spoke of a presentation set of his books, and in doing homage to Raffles made his peace with our host.  As for Lord Thornaby, I did overhear the name of the Athenaeum Club, a reference to his friends on the committee, and a whisper (as I thought) of Rule II.\\n\\nThe police were still in possession when we went our several ways, and it was all. that I could do to drag Raffles up to my rooms, though, as I have said, they were just round the corner.  He consented at last as a lesser evil than talking of the burglary in the street; and in my rooms I told him of his late danger and my own dilemma, of the few words I had overheard in the beginning, of the thin ice on which he had cut fancy figures without a crack.  It was all. very well for him.  He had never realized his peril.  But let him think of me - listening, watching, yet unable to lift a finger - unable to say one warning word.\\n\\nRaffles suffered me to finish, but a weary sigh followed the last symmetrical whiff of a Sullivan which he flung into my fire before he spoke.\\n\\n\\\"No, I won't have another, thank you.  I'm going to talk to you, Bunny.  Do you really suppose I didn't see through these wiseacres from the first?\\\"\\n\\nI flatly refused to believe he had done so before that evening.  Why had he never mentioned his idea to me?  It had been quite the other way, as I indignantly reminded Raffles.  Did he mean me to believe he was the man to thrust his head into the lion's mouth for fun? And what point would there be in dragging me there to see the fun?\\n\\n\\\"I might have wanted you, Bunny.  I very nearly did.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For my face?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It has been my fortune before to-night, Bunny.  It has also given me more confidence than you are likely to believe at this time of day.  You stimulate me more than you think.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your gallery and your prompter's box in one?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Capital, Bunny!  But it was no joking matter with me either, my dear fellow; it was touch-and-go at the time.  I might have called on you at any moment, and it was something to know I should not have called in vain.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But what to do, Raffles?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Fight our way out and bolt!\\\" he answered, with a mouth that meant it, and a fine gay glitter of the eyes.\\n\\nI shot out of my chair.\\n\\n\\\"You don't mean to tell me you had a hand in the job?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I had the only hand in it, my dear Bunny.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nonsense!  You were sitting at table at the time.  No, but you may have taken some other fellow into the show.  I always thought you would!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"One's quite enough, Bunny,\\\" said Raffles dryly; he leaned back in his chair and took out another cigarette.  And I accepted of yet another from his case; for it was no use losing one's temper with Raffles; and his incredible statement was not, after all., to be ignored.\\n\\n\\\"Of course,\\\" I went on, \\\"if you really had brought off this thing on your own, I should be the last to criticise your means of reaching such an end.  You have not only scored off a far superior force, which had laid itself out to score off you, but you have put them in the wrong about you, and they'll eat out of your hand for the rest of their days.  But don't ask me to believe that you've done all. this alone!  By George,\\\" I cried, in a sudden wave of enthusiasm, \\\"I don't care how you've done it or who has helped you. It's the biggest thing you ever did in your life!\\\"\\n\\nAnd certainly I had never seen Raffles look more radiant, or better pleased with the world and himself, or nearer that elation which he usually left to me.\\n\\n\\\"Then you shall hear all. about it, Bunny, if you'll do what I ask you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ask away, old chap, and the thing's done.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Switch off the electric lights.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All. of them?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think so.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There, then.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Now go to the back window and up with the blind.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well?\\\"?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm coming to you.  Splendid!  I never had a look so late as this. It's the only window left alight in the house!\\\"\\n\\nHis cheek against the pane, he was pointing slightly downward and very much aslant through a long lane of mews to a little square light like a yellow tile at the end.  But I had opened the window and leaned out before I saw it for myself.\\n\\n\\\"You don't mean to say that's Thornaby House?\\\"\\n\\nI was not familiar with the view from my back windows.\\n\\n\\\"Of course I do, you rabbit!  Have a look through your own race-glass.  It has been the most useful thing of all.\\\"\\n\\nBut before I had the glass in focus more scales had fallen from my eyes; and now I knew why I had seen so much of Raffles these last few weeks, and why he had always come between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and waited at this very window, with these very glasses at his eyes.  I saw through them sharply now.  The one lighted window pointed out by Raffles came tumbling into the dark circle of my vision.  I could not see into the actual room, but the shadows of those within were quite distinct on the lowered blind.  I even thought a black thread still dangled against the square of light.  It was, it must be, the window to which the intrepid Parrington had descended from the one above.\\n\\n\\\"Exactly!\\\" said Raffles in answer to my exclamation.  \\\"And that's the window I have been watching these last few weeks.  By daylight you can see the whole lot above the ground floor on this side of the house; and by good luck one of them is the room in which the master of the house arrays himself in all. his nightly glory.  It was easily spotted by watching at the right time.  I saw him shaved one morning before you were up!  In the evening his valet stays behind to put things straight; and that has been the very mischief. In the end I had to find out something about the man, and wire to him from his girl to meet her outside at eight o'clock.  Of course he pretends he was at his post at the time: that I foresaw, and did the poor fellow's work before my own.  I folded and put away every garment before I permitted myself to rag the room.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I wonder you had time!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It took me one more minute, and it put the clock on exactly fifteen.  By the way, I did that literally, of course, in the case of the clock they found.  It's an old dodge, to stop a clock and alter the time; but you must admit that it looked as though one had wrapped it up all. ready to cart away.  There was thus any amount of prima-fade evidence of the robbery having taken place when we were all. at table.  As a matter of fact, Lord Thornaby left his dressing-room one minute, his valet followed him the minute after, and I entered the minute after that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Through the window?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To be sure.  I was waiting below in the garden.  You have to pay for your garden in town, in more ways than one.  You know the wall, of course, and that jolly old postern?  The lock was beneath contempt.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But what about the window?  It's on the first floor, isn't it?\\\"\\n\\nRaffles took up the cane which he had laid down with his overcoat. It was a stout bamboo with a polished ferule.  He unscrewed the ferule, and shook out of the cane a diminishing series of smaller canes, exactly like a child's fishing-rod, which I afterward found to have been their former state.  A double hook of steel was now produced and quickly attached to the tip of the top joint; then Raffles undid three buttons of his waistcoat; and lapped round and round his waist was the finest of Manila ropes, with the neatest of foot-loops at regular intervals.\\n\\n\\\"Is it necessary to go any further?\\\" asked Raffles when he had unwound the rope.  \\\"This end is made fast to that end of the hook, the other half of the hook fits over anything that comes its way, and you leave your rod dangling while you swarm up your line.  Of course, you must know what you've got to hook on to; but a man who has had a porcelain bath fixed in his dressing-room is the man for me.  The pipes were all. outside, and fixed to the wall in just the right place.  You see I had made a reconnaissance by day in addition to many by night; it would hardly have been worth while constructing my ladder on chance.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So you made it on purpose!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My dear Bunny,\\\" said Raffles, as he wound the hemp girdle round his waist once more, \\\"I never did care for ladder work, but I always said that if I ever used a ladder it should be the best of its kind yet invented.  This one may come in useful again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But how long did the whole thing take you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"From mother earth, to mother earth?  About five minutes, to-night, and one of those was spent in doing another man's work.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What!\\\" I cried.  \\\"You mean to tell me you climbed up and down, in and out, and broke into that cupboard and that big tin box, and wedged up the doors and cleared out with a peer's robes and all. the rest of it in five minutes?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course I don't, and of course I didn't.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then what do you mean, and what did you do?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Made two bites at the cherry, Bunny!  I had a dress rehearsal in the dead of last night, and it was then I took the swag.  Our noble friend was snoring next door all. the time, but the effort may still stand high among my small exploits, for I not only took all. I wanted, but left the whole place exactly as I found it, and shut things after me like a good little boy.  All. that took a good deal longer; to-night I had simply to rag the room a bit, sweep up some studs and links, and leave ample evidence of having boned those rotten robes to-night.  That, if you come to think of it, was what you writing chaps would call the quintessential Q.E.F.  I have not only shown these dear Criminologists that I couldn't possibly have done this trick, but that there's some other fellow who could and did, and whom they've been perfect asses to confuse with me.\\\"\\n\\nYou may figure me as gazing on Raffles all. this time in mute and rapt amazement.  But I had long been past that pitch.  If he had told me now that he had broken into the Bank of England, or the Tower, I should not have disbelieved him for a moment.  I was prepared to go home with him to the Albany and find the regalia under his bed.  And I took down my overcoat as he put on his.  But Raffles would not hear of my accompanying him that night.\\n\\n\\\"No, my dear Bunny, I am short of sleep and fed up with excitement. You mayn't believe it - you may look upon me as a plaster devil -  but those five minutes you wot of were rather too crowded even for my taste.  The dinner was nominally at a quarter to eight, and I don't mind telling you now that I counted on twice as long as I had. But no one came until twelve minutes to, and so our host took his time.  I didn't want to be the last to arrive, and I was in the drawing-room five minutes before the hour.  But it was a quicker thing than I care about, when all. is said.\\\"\\n\\nAnd his last word on the matter, as he nodded and went his way, may well be mine; for one need be no criminologist, much less a member of the Criminologists' Club, to remember what Raffles did with the robes and coronet of the Right Hon. the Earl of Thornaby, K.G.  He did with them exactly what he might have been expected to do by the gentlemen with whom he had foregathered; and he did it in a manner so characteristic of himself as surely to remove from their minds the last aura of the idea that he and himself were the same person. Carter Paterson was out of the question, and any labelling or addressing to be avoided on obvious grounds.  But Raffles stabled the white elephants in the cloak-room at Charing Cross -  and sent Lord Thornaby the ticket.\\n\\nThe Field of Phillipi\\n\\nNipper Nasmyth had been head of our school when Raffles was captain of cricket. I believe he owed his nickname entirely to the popular prejudice against a day-boy; and in view of the special reproach which the term carried in my time, as also of the fact that his father was one of the school trustees, partner in a banking firm of four resounding surnames, and manager of the local branch, there can be little doubt that the stigma was undeserved.  But we did not think so then, for Nasmyth was unpopular with high and low, and appeared to glory in the fact.  A swollen conscience caused him to see and hear even more than was warranted by his position, and his uncompromising nature compelled him to act on whatsoever he heard or saw: a savage custodian of public morals, he had in addition a perverse enthusiasm for lost causes, loved a minority for its own sake, and untenable tenets for theirs.  Such, at all. events, was my impression of Nipper Nasmyth, after my first term, which was also his last I had never spoken to him, but I had heard him speak with extraordinary force and fervor in the school debates.  I carried a clear picture of his unkempt hair, his unbrushed coat, his dominant spectacles, his dogmatic jaw.  And it was I who knew the combination at a glance, after years and years, when the fateful whim seized Raffles to play once more in the Old Boys' Match, and his will took me down with him to participate in the milder festivities of Founder's Day.\\n\\nIt was, however, no ordinary occasion.  The bicentenary loomed but a year ahead, and a movement was on foot to mark the epoch with an adequate statue of our pious founder.  A special meeting was to be held at the school-house, and Raffles had been specially invited by the new head master, a man of his own standing, who had been in the eleven with him up at Cambridge.  Raffles had not been near the old place for years; but I had never gone down since the day I left; and I will not dwell on the emotions which the once familiar journey awakened in my unworthy bosom.  Paddington was alive with Old Boys of all. ages - but very few of ours - if not as lively as we used to make it when we all. landed back for the holidays.  More of us had moustaches and cigarettes and \\\"loud\\\" ties.  That was all.  Yet of the throng, though two or three looked twice and thrice at Raffles, neither he nor I knew a soul until we had to change at the junction near our journey's end, when, as I say, it was I who recognized Nipper Nasmyth at sight.\\n\\nThe man was own son of the boy we both remembered.  He had grown a ragged beard and a moustache that hung about his face like a neglected creeper.  He was stout and bent and older than his years. But he spurned the platform with a stamping stride which even I remembered in an instant, and which was enough for Raffles before he saw the man's face.\\n\\n\\\"The Nipper it is!\\\" he cried.  \\\"I could swear to that walk in a pantomime procession!  See the independence in every step: that's his heel on the neck of the oppressor: it's the nonconformist conscience in baggy breeches.  I must speak to him, Bunny.  There was a lot of good in the old Nipper, though he and I did bar each other.\\\"\\n\\nAnd in a moment he had accosted the man by the boy's nickname, obviously without thinking of an affront which few would have read in that hearty open face and hand.\\n\\n\\\"My name's Nasmyth,\\\" snapped the other, standing upright to glare.\\n\\n\\\"Forgive me,\\\" said Raffles undeterred.  \\\"One remembers a nickname and forgets all. it never used to mean.  Shake hands, my dear fellow! I'm Raffles.  It must be fifteen years since we met.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"At least,\\\" replied Nasmyth coldly; but he could no longer refuse Raffles his hand.  \\\"So you are going down,\\\" he sneered, \\\"to this great gathering?\\\"  And I stood listening at my distance, as though still in the middle fourth.\\n\\n\\\"Rather!\\\" cried Raffles.  \\\"I'm afraid I have let myself lose touch, but I mean to turn over a new leaf.  I suppose that isn't necessary in your case, Nasmyth?\\\"\\n\\nHe spoke with an enthusiasm rare indeed in him: it had grown upon Raffles in the train; the spirit of his boyhood had come rushing back at fifty miles an hour.  He might have been following some honorable calling in town; he might have snatched this brief respite from a distinguished but exacting career.  I am convinced that it was I alone who remembered at that moment the life we were really leading at that time.  With me there walked this skeleton through every waking hour that was to follow.  I shall endeavor not to refer to it again.  Yet it should not be forgotten that my skeleton was always there.\\n\\n\\\"It certainly is not necessary in my case,\\\" replied Nasmyth, still as stiff as any poker.  \\\"I happen to be a trustee.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of the school?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Like my father before me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I congratulate you, my dear fellow!\\\" cried the hearty Raffles - a younger Raffles than I had ever known in town.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know that you need,\\\" said Nasmyth sourly.\\n\\n\\\"But it must be a tremendous interest.  And the proof is that you're going down to this show, like all. the rest of us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, I'm not.  I live there, you see.\\\"\\n\\nAnd I think the Nipper recalled that name as he ground his heel upon an unresponsive flagstone.\\n\\n\\\"But you're going to this meeting at the school-house, surely?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know.  If I do there may be squalls.  I don't know what you think about this precious scheme Raffles, but I . . .\\\"\\n\\nThe ragged beard stuck out, set teeth showed through the wild moustache, and in a sudden outpouring we had his views.  They were narrow and intemperate and perverse as any I had heard him advocate as the firebrand of the Debating Society in my first term.  But they were stated with all. the old vim and venom.  The mind of Nasmyth had not broadened with the years, but neither had its natural force abated, nor that of his character either.  He spoke with great vigor at the top of his voice; soon we had a little crowd about us; but the tall collars and the broad smiles of the younger Old Boys did not deter our dowdy demagogue.  Why spend money on a man who had been dead two hundred years?  What good could it do him or the school?  Besides, he was only technically our founder.  He had not founded a great public school.  He had founded a little country grammar school which had pottered along for a century and a half.  The great public school was the growth of the last fifty years, and no credit to the pillar of piety. Besides, he was only nominally pious.  Nasmyth had made researches, and he knew.  And why throw good money after a bad man?\\n\\n\\\"Are there many of your opinion?\\\" inquired Raffles, when the agitator paused for breath.  And Nasmyth beamed on us with flashing eyes.\\n\\n\\\"Not one to my knowledge as yet,\\\" said he.  \\\"But we shall see after to-morrow night.  I hear it's to be quite an exceptional gathering this year; let us hope it may contain a few sane men.  There are none on the present staff, and I only know of one among the trustees!\\\"\\n\\nRaffles refrained from smiling as his dancing eye met mine.\\n\\n\\\"I can understand your view,\\\" he said.  \\\"I am not sure that I don't share it to some extent.  But it seems to me a duty to support a general movement like this even if it doesn't take the direction or the shape of our own dreams.  I suppose you yourself will give something, Nasmyth?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Give something?  I?  Not a brass farthing!\\\" cried the implacable banker.  \\\"To do so would be to stultify my whole position.  I cordially and conscientiously disapprove of the whole thing, and shall use all. my influence against it.  No, my good sir, I not only don't subscribe myself, but I hope to be the means of nipping a good many subscriptions in the bud.\\\"\\n\\nI was probably the only one who saw the sudden and yet subtle change in Raffles - the hard mouth, the harder eye.  I, at least, might have foreseen the sequel then and there.  But his quiet voice betrayed nothing, as he inquired whether Nasmyth was going to speak at next night's meeting.  Nasmyth said he might, and certainly warned us what to expect.  He was still fulminating when our train came in.\\n\\n\\\"Then we meet again at Philippi,\\\" cried Raffles in gay adieu.  \\\"For you have been very frank with us all., Nasmyth, and I'll be frank enough in my turn to tell you that I've every intention of speaking on the other side!\\\"\\n\\nIt happened that Raffles had been asked to speak by his old college friend, the new head master.  Yet it was not at the school-house that he and I were to stay, but at the house that we had both been in as boys.  It also had changed hands: a wing had been added, and the double tier of tiny studies made brilliant with electric light. But the quad and the fives-courts did not look a day older; the ivy was no thicker round the study windows; and in one boy's castle we found the traditional print of Charing Cross Bridge which had knocked about our studies ever since a son of the contractor first sold it when he left.  Nay, more, there was the bald remnant of a stuffed bird which had been my own daily care when it and I belonged to Raffles.  And when we all. filed in to prayers, through the green baize door which still separated the master's part of the house from that of the boys, there was a small boy posted in the passage to give the sign of silence to the rest assembled in the hall, quite identically as in the dim old days; the picture was absolutely unchanged; it was only we who were out of it in body and soul.\\n\\nOn our side of the baize door a fine hospitality and a finer flow of spirits were the order of the night.  There was a sound representative assortment of quite young Old Boys, to whom ours was a prehistoric time, and in the trough of their modem chaff and chat we old stagers might well have been left far astern of the fun.  Yet it was Raffles who was the life and soul of the party, and that not by meretricious virtue of his cricket.  There happened not to be another cricketer among us, and it was on their own subjects that Raffles laughed with the lot in turn and in the lump.  I never knew him in quite such form.  I will not say he was a boy among them, but he was that rarer being, the man of the world who can enter absolutely into the fun and fervor of the salad age.  My cares and my regrets had never been more acute, but Raffles seemed a man without either in his life.\\n\\nHe was not, however, the hero of the Old Boys' Match, and that was expected of him by all. the school.  There was a hush when he went in, a groan when he came out.  I had no reason to suppose he was not trying; these things happen to the cricketer who plays out of his class; but when the great Raffles went on to bowl, and was hit all. over the field, I was not so sure.  It certainly failed to affect his spirits; he was more brilliant than ever at our hospitable board; and after dinner came the meeting at which he and Nasmyth were to speak.\\n\\nIt was a somewhat frigid gathering until Nasmyth rose.  We had all. dined with our respective hosts, and then repaired to this business in cold blood.  Many were lukewarm about it in their hearts; there was a certain amount of mild prejudice, and a greater amount of animal indifference, to be overcome in the opening speech.  It is not for me to say whether this was successfully accomplished.  I only know how the temperature of that meeting rose with Nipper Nasmyth.\\n\\nAnd I dare say, in all. the circumstances of the case, his really was a rather vulgar speech.  But it was certainly impassioned, and probably as purely instinctive as his denunciation of all. the causes which appeal to the gullible many without imposing upon the cantankerous few.  His arguments, it is true, were merely an elaboration of those with which he had favored some of us already; but they were pointed by a concise exposition of the several definite principles they represented, and barbed with a caustic rhetoric quite admirable in itself.  In a word, the manner was worthy of the very foundation it sought to shake, or we had never swallowed such matter without a murmur.  As it was, there was a demonstration in the wilderness when the voice ceased crying.  But we sat in the deeper silence when Raffles rose to reply.\\n\\nI leaned forward not to lose a word.  I knew my Raffles so well that I felt almost capable of reporting his speech before I heard it.  Never was I more mistaken, even in him!  So far from a gibe for a gibe and a taunt for a taunt, there never was softer answer than that which A. J. Raffles returned to Nipper Nasmyth before the staring eyes and startled ears of all. assembled.  He courteously but firmly refused to believe a word his old friend Nasmyth had said  - about himself.  He had known Nasmyth for twenty years, and never had he met a dog who barked so loud and bit so little.  The fact was that he had far too kind a heart to bite at all.  Nasmyth might get up and protest as loud as he liked: the speaker declared he knew him better than Nasmyth knew himself.  He had the necessary defects of his great qualities.  He was only too good a sportsman.  He had a perfect passion for the weaker side.  That alone led Nasmyth into such excesses of language as we had all. heard from his lips that night.  As for Raffles, he concluded his far too genial remarks by predicting that, whatever Nasmyth might say or think of the new fund, he would subscribe to it as handsomely as any of us, like \\\"the generous good chap\\\" that we all. knew him to be.\\n\\nEven so did Raffles disappoint the Old Boys in the evening as he had disappointed the school by day.  We had looked to him for a noble raillery, a lofty and loyal disdain, and he had fobbed us off with friendly personalities not even in impeccable taste. Nevertheless, this light treatment of a grave offence went far to restore the natural amenities of the occasion.  It was impossible even for Nasmyth to reply to it as he might to a more earnest onslaught.  He could but smile sardonically, and audibly undertake to prove Raffles a false prophet; and though subsequent speakers were less merciful the note was struck, and there was no more bad blood in the debate.  There was plenty, however, in the veins of Nasmyth, as I was to discover for myself before the night was out.\\n\\nYou might think that in the circumstances he would not have attended the head master's ball with which the evening ended; but that would be sadly to misjudge so perverse a creature as the notorious Nipper. He was probably one of those who protest that there is \\\"nothing personal\\\" in their most personal attacks.  Not that Nasmyth took this tone about Raffles when he and I found ourselves cheek by jowl against the ballroom wall; he could forgive his franker critics, but not the friendly enemy who had treated him so much more gently than he deserved.\\n\\n\\\"I seem to have seen you with this great man Raffles,\\\" began Nasmyth, as he overhauled me with his fighting eye.  \\\"Do you know him well?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Intimately.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I remember now.  You were with him when he forced himself upon me on the way down yesterday.  He had to tell me who he was.  Yet he talks as though we were old friends.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You were in the upper sixth together,\\\" I rejoined, nettled by his tone.\\n\\n\\\"What does that matter?  I am glad to say I had too much self-respect, and too little respect for Raffles, ever to be a friend of his then. I knew too many of the things he did,\\\" said Nipper Nasmyth.\\n\\nHis fluent insults had taken my breath.  But in a lucky flash I saw my retort.\\n\\n\\\"You must have had special opportunities of observation, living in the town,\\\" said I; and drew first blood between the long hair and the ragged beard; but that was all.\\n\\n\\\"So he really did get out at nights?\\\" remarked my adversary.  \\\"You certainly give your friend away.  What's he doing now?\\\"\\n\\nI let my eyes follow Raffles round the room before replying.  He was waltzing with a master's wife - waltzing as he did everything else.  Other couples seemed to melt before them.  And the woman on his arm looked a radiant girl.\",\"timestamp\":1637495091,\"title\":\"Locking your lordship's dressing-room door behind your lordship, my lord\"},\"digest\":\"C2HnhzbB2d8X9mfPhko0Fxxii6tP3JDXnlkoUkkbsX4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x104C9415d8cF60006fA1f2ecb12Aa1B60108c24D\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"VojXruRchGuLpF6IHNmI6OGfBnA2hebYGqe1TKPd7BI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"guU5ljnepO92VTSMVitzmA_k1y59idxDfAFkK3xqjfw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"rnKmFcIGNRhCSXi84VzvzbMuZjyWkpOVrD7P4tDxg7jF20YkuVYC3aFaPG5JYGquMcajll6LoLvHfvKEAUgnPQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x467345f671b6a4c961cee8755c9f18ab2984351ffc8b7e141114ed5dcca5ed4d0ee692aecde36ab28f688bfc3bef57ed4b78b335ac249331c6f87f179a65cec11b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"VojXruRchGuLpF6IHNmI6OGfBnA2hebYGqe1TKPd7BI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"guU5ljnepO92VTSMVitzmA_k1y59idxDfAFkK3xqjfw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"C2HnhzbB2d8X9mfPhko0Fxxii6tP3JDXnlkoUkkbsX4\"}"
