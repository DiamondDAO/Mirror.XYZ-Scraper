"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"That year, I went to a company to apply for a job. The company is looking for two positions, one is an assistant manager and the other is an ordinary salesman. For a student like me who graduated from a first-class university, the goal is naturally the first post, which is the minimum, otherwise how can I be worthy of my diploma? As a result, there was a queue and an interview. After five passes, I was defeated by six generals. Unexpectedly, at the end of the session, I was confident, but I was out in the brutal competition! When I walked out of the company, I passed the application room of the ordinary salesman, which was empty! Not surprisingly, a young man with a little diploma who wants to be an ordinary salesman? When I walked out of the gate, it was almost the rush hour after work, and the traffic on the road began to be crowded. I needed to change buses or take the subway. I was going to take a taxi home to comfort myself when I failed to apply for the job. It happened that a taxi came out of an alley and reached out to stop it. After getting on the bus, I told the driver to go to Yiyuan New Village. The driver didn't drive immediately, so he turned around and asked me, \\\"Do you want to take the shortest road or the fastest road?\\\" \\\"Isn't the shortest way the fastest way?\\\" I asked curiously. \\\"Of course not! Now, the traffic is high, and the shortest road is also the most crowded road. If there is a traffic jam, it may take an hour or two, so I suggest taking a long detour and passing by Stadium Road. Although it is far, it can get there quickly! \\\" \\\"Then take a detour!\\\" I answered without thinking. The driver drove forward as soon as he stepped on the gas pedal. Trees and shops on both sides of the street ran quickly behind my head, but my mind was opened by the driver's words. Obviously, the position of assistant manager is a \\\"straight road\\\", which is the direct goal of the candidates. It is precisely because of this that many people crowded into this road, forming a fierce and cruel competition. I am also a person who stared at this straight road wholeheartedly, but failed! If this is the case, then the ordinary salesman is undoubtedly a detour for me, but it may be more beneficial for my future work to start from the lower level step by step and accumulate more experience! In this case, why can't I take a detour and choose this detour? Thinking of this, I immediately told the driver to turn around and go back to that company, and walk into the application room of the unattended ordinary salesman ... Ten minutes later, I was told that I could start working formally from tomorrow! In this way, I became an ordinary salesman in this company. After a year of tempering, I was promoted to the team leader. In the second year, I was promoted to director ... Today, five years later, I became the manager of the sales department with my excellent work performance! It is said that the winner who stood out when applying for the position of manager assistant is still the manager assistant, which is my assistant. Although being a manager is not a great achievement, for me personally, it is also a staged or certain degree of success. Assuming that I didn't choose to apply for an ordinary salesman at the beginning, of course, maybe I will develop elsewhere, but I believe I will never appear in this company, let alone become the youngest sales manager in this company's history. Thanks to the unknown taxi driver, he made me realize that the distance of detours is sometimes the nearest distance! \\n \",\"timestamp\":1642492000,\"title\":\"istance of detour\"},\"digest\":\"LiBEQeGu1lf8Bx-SaMGAPzn4GJ0Ju7U7GkmLUc5zUM8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0a3377dC1F1bF55Ce82f87229259567fbCA1933E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"SnpLNBlQnxyFnk1CVuw3ZxsivKTyPdLrxc5-2BzE-B0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Z0c5dUzCCalYdMzH9keSDr9al3raRiFwxZtxtnnQBPU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"eOQqCTfWFxOtY2qH4gaYzapOu6a44aq7u6SRHMvJEOqDQ2ZpvVqdYIB9F0uhBQxy2WNFIeESkk9-4XtqNPCTvA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5f25602aa6986c1635a65cb12b3189482053aeb0b2ba47f6de22c0a4f8494abd57f04e34859eca47ef1aa821f55d5a2fb076e341cfbd51ffef379cc03f1db6c11b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"SnpLNBlQnxyFnk1CVuw3ZxsivKTyPdLrxc5-2BzE-B0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Z0c5dUzCCalYdMzH9keSDr9al3raRiFwxZtxtnnQBPU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"LiBEQeGu1lf8Bx-SaMGAPzn4GJ0Ju7U7GkmLUc5zUM8\"}"
