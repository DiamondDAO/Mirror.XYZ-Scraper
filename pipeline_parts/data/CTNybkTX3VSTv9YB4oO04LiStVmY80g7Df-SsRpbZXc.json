"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The goddess, with her great wings outspread behind her, is being carried forward, her firm rounded limbs striking through the draperies which flutter behind her, and fall about her in soft folds.  Vigorous and stately, the goddess poises herself on the prow of the ship, swaying with the impulse of conquering daring and strength.\\n\\nAnother statue which belongs, so far as artistic reasoning may carry us, to the period and school of Praxiteles, is the so- called Venus of Milo.  The proper title to be given to this statue is doubtful, for the drapery corresponds to that of the Roman type of Victory, and if we could be sure that the goddess once held the shield of conquest in her now broken arms we should be forced to call the figure a Victory and place its date no earlier than the second century B.C.  However this may be, the statue is justly one of the most famous in the world.  It represents an ideal of purity and sweetness.  There is not a trace of coarseness or immodesty in the half-naked woman who stands perfect in the maidenly dignity of her own conquering fairness.  Her serious yet smiling face, her graceful form, the delicacy of feeling in attitude and gaze, the tender moulding of breast and limbs, make it a worthy companion of the Hermes or Praxiteles.  It seems scarcely possible that it should not have sprung from the inspiration of his example.\\n\\nThe last of the great sculptors of Greece was Lysippos of Sikyou. He differed from Pheidias on the one hand and from Polycleitos on the other.  Pheidias strove to make his gods all god-like; Lysippos was content to represent them merely as exaggerated human beings; but therein he differed also from Polycleitos, who aimed to model the human body with the beauty only which actually existed in it.  Lysippos felt that he must set the standard of human perfection higher than it appears in the average of human examples.  Hence we have from him the statues of Heracles, in which the ideal of manly strength was carried far beyond the range of human possibility.  A reminiscence of this conception of Lysippos may be found in the Farnese Heracles of Glycon, now in the Museum of Naples.  Lysippos also sculptured four statues of Zeus, which depended for their interest largely on their heroic size.\\n\\nLysippos won much fame by his statues of Alexander the Great, but he is chiefly known to us by his statue of the athlete scraping himself with a strigil, of which an authentic copy is in the Vatican.  The figure differs decidedly from the thick-set, rather heavy figures of Polycleitos, being tall, and slender in spite of its robustness.  The head is small, the torso is small at the waist, but strong, and the whole body is splendidly active.\\n\\nThe changes in the models of earlier sculptors made by Lysippos were of sufficient importance to give rise to a school which was carried on by his sons and others, producing among many famous works the Barberini Faun, now at the Glyptothek, Munich.  The enormous Colossus of Rhodes was also the work of a disciple of Lysippos.\\n\\nBut from this time the downward tendency in Greek art is only too apparent, and very rapid.  The spread of Greek influence over Asia, and later, in consequence of the conquest of Greece by Rome, over Europe, had the effect of widening the market for Greek production, but of drying up the sources of what was vital in that production.  Athens and Sikyou became mere provincial cities, and were shorn thenceforth of all artistic significance; and Greek art, thus deprived of the roots of its life, continued to grow for a while with a rank luxuriance of production, but soon became normal and conventional.  The artists who followed Lysippos contented themselves chiefly with seeking a merely technical perfection in reproducing the creations of the earlier and more original age.\\n\\nAt Pergamon under Attalus, in the last years of the third century, there was something of an artistic revival.  This Attalus successfully defended his country against an overwhelming attack of the Gauls from the north.  To celebrate this victory, an altar was erected to Zeus on the Acropolis of Pergamon, of which the frieze represented the contest between Zeus and the giants.  These sculptures are now to be found in Berlin.  They are carved in high relief; the giants with muscles strained and distended, their bodies writhing in the contortions of effort and suffering; the gods, no longer calm and restrained, but themselves overcome with the ardor of battle.  Zeus stretches his arms over the battle-field hurling destruction everywhere. Athene turns from the field, dragging at her heels a young giant whom she has conquered, and reaches forward to the crown of victory.  The wild, passionate action of the whole work remove it far from the firm, orderly work of Pheidias, and carry it almost to the extreme of pathetic representation in sculpture shown by the Laocoon.\\n\\nThe contests with the Gauls, the fear inspired by the huge forms of the barbarians, seem to have influenced powerfully the imaginative conceptions of the sculptors of the school of Pergamon.  One of the most famous works which they have left is the figure long known as the Dying Gladiator, of which a copy exists in the Capitoline Museum.  This represents a Gaul sinking wounded to the ground, supporting himself on his right arm.  It is remarkable for its stern realism.  The pain and sense of defeat comes out in every feature.  Moreover, the nationality of the fallen warrior is clearly expressed in the deep indentation between the heavy brow and the prominent nose, in the face, shaven, except the upper lip, in the uncouth, fleshy body, in the rough hands and feet.  Usually the artist preferred to hint at the race by some peculiarities of costume.  Here nothing but uncompromising realism of feature will satisfy the sculptor.  A companion piece to the Wounded Gaul, though less famous, is the group of the Villa Ludovisi, which represents a Gaul, who has slain his wife, in the act of stabbing himself in the neck.\\n\\nIn addition to inspiring the sculptures at Pergamon, Attalus dedicated to the gods of Athens a votive offering in return for the help which they had given him.  This was placed on the Acropolis at Athens.  It consisted of four groups, representing the gigantomachia or giant combat, the battle of the Amazons, the battle of Marathon, and the victory of Attalus.  Figures from these survive, a dead Amazon at Naples and a kneeling Persian at the Vatican being the best known.\\n\\nAnother state which became famous in the declining days of Greek art was the republic of Rhodes.  The Rhodian sculptors learned their anatomy from Lysippos, and caught their dramatic instinct from the artists of Pergamon.  Two of the most famous sculpture groups in the world were produced at Rhodes,   the Laocoon, now at the Vatican, and the Farnese Bull, now at Naples.  The former was the work of three artists, given by Pliny as Agesandros, Athanodorus, and Polydorus.  It has been accepted as one of the masterpieces of the world, but as we shall see, it is manifestly a work of a time of decadence.\\n\\nThe Laocoon illustrates excellently the extreme results of the pathetic tendency.  The priest Laocoon is represented at the moment when the serpents of Apollo surround him and his two sons, born through their father's sin, and bear them all three down to destruction.  The younger son, fatally bitten, falls back in death agony.  The father yields slowly, his desperation giving way before the merciless strength of the serpents.  The elder son shrinks away in horror though bound fast by the inevitable coils.\\n\\nThe Laocoon shows the pathetic tendency at its utmost.  The technical difficulties have been overcome with astonishing success, and though the combination of figures is impossible in life, it is marvellously effective in art.   But the group depends for its interest purely on the accidental horror of the situation.  There is no hint in the sculpture of the motive of the tragedy, no suggestion of ethical significance in the suffering portrayed.  It does not connect itself with any principle of life.  In this way the work became a superb piece of display, a TOUR DE FORCE of surprising composition but with little serious meaning.\\n\\nThe same judgment may be extended to the Farnese Bull, the work of Apollonius and Tauriscos, artists from Tralles who lived at Rhodes.  This group represents the punishment of the cruel Dirke at the hands of the sons of Antiope.  The beautiful queen clasps the knee of one of the sons praying for grace, while the other boy is about to throw over her the noose which is to bind her to the bull.  Antiope stands in the background, a mere lay figure, and scattered about are numerous small symbolical figures.  Like the Laocoon the Farnese Bull exhibits surprising mastery of technical obstacles, but, like the Laocoon, it falls short of true tragic grandeur.  In a greater degree than the Laocoon it trenches upon the province of painting.  It is more complicated in its subject-matter; and the appearance in the group of many small subsidiary figures, which in a painting might have been given their proper value, being in the marble of the same relief and distinction as the major characters, give a somewhat absurd effect.  The little goddess who sits in the foreground, for instance, is smaller than the dog.  Again, there is less of the motive shown than in the Laocoon.  The group is seized at the moment preceding the frightful catastrophe, but that moment is as full of agony as the succeeding ones, and in addition there is the feeling of suspense and oppression that comes from the unfinished tragedy.  Altogether, the group, in spite of the marvellous technical skill shown in details, is a failure when judged on general lines.  Its interest lies in momentary and apparently ummotived suffering, not in any truly serious conception of life.\\n\\nWith the conquest of Greece by Rome, the final stage of Greek art begins.  But the vigor and originality had departed.  The sculptors aimed at and attained technical correctness, academic beauty of form, sensuous feeling, perfection of details, but they lost all imaginative power.   A good example of the work of this period is found in the Apollo Belvidere now in the Vatican.  This famous statue is an early Roman copy of a Greek original.  It represents the god advancing easily, full of vigor and grace.  It is marvellously correct in drawing, but quite without feeling of any kind.\\n\\nAnother work of this period is the sleeping Ariadne of the Vatican.  This represents a woman reclining in a studied sentimental attitude, her arms thrown about her head, her body swathed in its protecting drapery.  To the same period also belongs almost the last notable work of Greek art, the degenerate and sensuous conception of the Venus de Medici.  In this statue the goddess stands as if rising from the sea, her attitude reserved, yet coquettish and self-conscious.  The form is technically perfect, graceful, and soft in its refinement, but compared with the earlier Aphrodites it is an unworthy successor.\\n\\nStill another famous statue is the Borghese Gladiator, of Agasius of Ephesus, now in the Louvre.  The statue is merely a bit of display, an effort to parade technical skill and anatomical knowledge.  The gladiator throws his weight strongly on his right leg, and holds one arm high above his head, giving to his whole body an effect of straining.  The figure is strong and wiry. Agasius was distinctly an imitator, as were most of the artists of this age, among whom must be reckoned the skilful sculptor of the crouching Venus, also in the Louvre.  The goddess is shown as bending down in graceful curves until her body is supported on the right leg, which is bent double.  The form is strong and healthy, graceful and easy in its somewhat constrained posture.\\n\\nDuring all of this final period Greek art was very largely influenced by the relations which existed between Greece and Rome.  About the year 200 B.C. the Roman conquest of Greece led to an important traffic in works of art between Rome and the Greek cities.  For a time, indeed, statues formed a recognized part of the booty which graced every Roman triumph.  M. Fulvius Nobilior carried away not less than five hundred and fifteen. After the period of conquest the importation of Greek statues continued at Rome, and in time Greek artists also began to remove thither, so that Rome became not only the centre for the collection of Greek works of art, but the chief seat of their production.  At this time the Roman religious conceptions were identified with those of Greece, and the Greek gods received the Latin names by which we now know them.  The influence of the Greeks upon Rome was very marked, but the reflex influence of the material civilization of Italy upon Greek art was altogether bad, and thus the splendor of classical art went out in dilletantism and weakness.\\n\\nThe destruction of the Roman Empire by the barbarians makes a break in the artistic history of the world.  Not for many centuries was there a vestige of artistic production.  Even when in Italy and France the monks began to make crude attempts to reach out for and represent in painting and sculpture imaginative conceptions of things beautiful, they took their material exclusively from Christian sources.  The tradition of classical stories had nearly vanished from the mind of Europe.  Not until the Renaissance restored the knowledge of classical culture to Europe do we find artists making any use of the wealth of imaginative material stored up in the myths of Greece.  Then, indeed, by the discovery and circulation of the poets of mythology, the Greek stories and conceptions of characters, divine and human, became known once more and were used freely, remaining until the present day one chief source of material and subject-matter for the use of the painter and sculptor.\",\"timestamp\":1641285930,\"title\":\"\\nAnother work of an unknown artist, probably a follower of Scopas, is the splendid Victory of Samothrace, now in the Louvre.  \"},\"digest\":\"l4SlMxxrhkxfcSi23hx3LepS5Xl1wTYHjaYUhepHRg0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x755Bda80E984cd5fAabcbf90e065196EEDb3214A\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3ExW68T4p3CGpItQiUtasRuOy__jkjtMOTe_x63obA0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"uNkCZ1QnPoCGmjip9zRzaLBIHxzkL5_6NIORcLp-_8w\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Vnod8MKRzbuLLhNL-Uo31HWDUALnaRswSgd_cdmrYvYY0Gjs7VinCzdZsGLSuLkAUM0YvIyAMSnl8fFrs2FlBQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2407ef72eb38f2e86ebaa2fc7d0ce1358c1883106098e3074a1466e2af01f3617ac1fa4577ece901d82c339603574a14c02f86d99c0e06ae249f16db654149881c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3ExW68T4p3CGpItQiUtasRuOy__jkjtMOTe_x63obA0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"uNkCZ1QnPoCGmjip9zRzaLBIHxzkL5_6NIORcLp-_8w\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"l4SlMxxrhkxfcSi23hx3LepS5Xl1wTYHjaYUhepHRg0\"}"
