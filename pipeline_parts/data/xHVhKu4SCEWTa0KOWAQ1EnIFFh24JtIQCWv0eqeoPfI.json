"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Knowledge is the purpose of reading (An End); exams are just a method (A Means).\\n\\nI can suggest some practical ways for students to study based on four major premises. If you can get used to using them, you can not only reduce the pressure of exams, but also invest in the more important knowledge with half the effort.\\n\\nFirst, understanding instead of memorization\\n\\nMany people know that lessons that are understood are easier to remember. But understanding is not actually an aid to memory - understanding is a substitute for memory. Not only is it difficult to remember the theory accurately; when it needs to be applied, the theory of strong memory simply does not help. Understand the basic concepts and implications of the theory, and you will suddenly feel that your memory is aided by God. The reason is simple: if you understand something, you don't have to memorize it. But there are different depths of understanding and different levels of accuracy in theories. The deeper the understanding, the more accurate it is, the clearer the memory, and the more comfortable it is to apply it. So reading should be coherent - the conjoined relationship of different emphases in the theory should be understood; thorough - the evolution of the concept or principle should be clear.\\n\\nIt is easy to make significant progress in these areas, and it does not take the student much time. If he can change three bad habits, he will be a different person within a year.\\n\\nThe first bad habit is to \\\"binge\\\" copy notes in class. Notes are secondary, or even optional. This is because copying notes has an irremediable disadvantage - too much distraction while listening! It is more than worthwhile to copy down what you don't understand and ignore the need to concentrate on understanding the main points of the speaker. I am sure this is a bad habit of Hong Kong students in general. For example, on several occasions I deliberately wrote obvious mistakes on the blackboard, and none of the 200 students noticed them, but just kept their heads down and copied the mistakes into their notes.\\n\\nNotes have two purposes. (1) To take notes on the main points of what is understood. However, if you feel that noting only the main points is distracting, you should give up taking notes. You will never forget the speaker's content within a few days after understanding it. Many of the lecturer's data can be found in the books, and those that are not in the books can be added after the class. The main difference between the teacher and the book is that the former is alive and the latter is dead. The main purpose of the class is to learn the teacher's way of thinking and reasoning. (2) If you don't understand something in class, and if you see too many students to ask questions, you can write down what you don't understand in your notes and ask the teacher or your classmates after class. In other words, it is more important to write down what you don't understand than what you do understand.\\n\\nThe second bad habit is to read each topic in the course separately, ignoring the relationship between the topics, so that understanding is not integrated. In order to cope with the exam, students read each topic separately, memorize it, and when they see a test question, no matter what the question is, as long as it seems to be related to a certain topic, they will \\\"open their throats\\\" and hope to \\\"hit\\\" it.\\n\\nIn order to change this bad habit, we need to take some time to think about the relationship between sections, chapters, or topics after reading a certain topic, or a chapter in a book, or even a section in a chapter that can stand alone. By knowing a little of these necessary connections, understanding will grow by leaps and bounds. This is because there is simply not much that humans know in the context of any one academic discipline. If you read it separately, you will find it too much to remember; if you read it coherently, there is much less to know and remember. Any academic discipline is built from the foundation of several units, and then leads to a thousand different applications. The more you learn, the more basic you know. If you ignore the coherence between topics, you will not be able to enter the door.\\n(Thinking is originally a whole, only when writing it is divided into different chapters according to the need, the union between the chapters to reflect a complete thinking, so do not encounter do not understand the deadlocked chapter does not put ah, then read on, gradually will be coherent)\\n\\nThe third bad habit, mainly referring to college students, is that when choosing a course, only want to choose the easier or lecture dynamic teacher. In fact, after you decide on a certain department, you should choose a course based on the teacher's knowledge and nothing else matters. It is far better to learn from a master than from a mediocre one. This is because the various subjects that are separated in any academic discipline are all the same. The growth of comprehension is to know the same, not to demand the different. The teacher cannot inspire the students to find the general theory between different subjects unless he has considerable skills.\\n\\nII. Concentration of mind is the only way to get interested\\n\\nWe all know that we read better in subjects in which we have an interest. But interest is not cultivated. Interest can only come about if the mind can focus on a subject. What can be developed is the ability to concentrate. If you can concentrate your mind on any subject, no matter how far it is from your interest, your interest will grow.\\n\\nA few hours of distraction in a book is far less than a few minutes of concentration. Students who think they don't have enough time to read are not concentrating enough. Even in college, it is enough to be able to concentrate for two or three hours a day after class. To develop concentration is also very simple. First, allocate time - you don't need to spend a lot of time reading, but you need to be consistent. You should not read when you know you will be disturbed. Second, try to leave the book when you don't intend to read - \\\"hungry books\\\" can strengthen the concentration when reading. Thirdly, if you feel a little forced to read, you should simply stop reading and wait for a time when you are in the mood - boredom with books is a big no-no. Remember that it takes very little time to read if you can concentrate.\\n\\nPut a watch on your desk. Look at your watch first, then start reading or doing your homework. If you find that you can often forget about your watch for 30 minutes, you have achieved a small degree of concentration. If you can completely forget about external objects for an hour or more every time you read, you don't have to worry about your concentration.\\n\\nQuestions are more important than answers\\n\\nMany students are afraid to ask questions because they are afraid that their teachers or classmates will think they are too shallow or too stupid to be ridiculous. But learning without asking questions is not real learning. The first golden rule of asking questions is to be thick-skinned! Even if the question is shallow, you have to ask if you don't understand it; you can ask anyone who can give you an answer.\\n\\nThere is never a question that is too shallow. On the contrary, many important discoveries in academia have been made by asking three or so shallow questions. Academic progress often depends on a blind fist to kill the teacher. Many scholars who do advanced research teach because young students can ask shallow questions that a person who knows too much cannot ask. Although there is no such thing as asking too shallow questions, the list of stupid questions is endless. An important purpose of learning is to learn what questions are stupid or superfluous. If you don't ask questions, it's hard to learn the subtleties.\\n\\nA teacher cannot spend much time on each student because there are so many students. A serious student should prepare before asking questions. This work is an important process in learning. Confucius said well: \\\"To know is to know, to not know is to not know. The easiest way to distinguish between \\\"knowing\\\" and \\\"not knowing\\\" is to do the preparation work before asking questions. There are three general steps in this preparation.\\n\\nFirst, questions can be divided into three categories - A, \\\"What? Students must first determine which category the question is: Category A asks about facts; Category B asks about methods; Category C asks about theories. Once the questions are identified, students should immediately know what they \\\"don't know\\\" about and thus avoid confusion. If the questions to be asked include more than one category, the questions should be separated into categories. This will reveal what they do not know. Second, try to add characteristics to the questions. In other words, the more pointed you ask, the better. Third, before asking the teacher, students should ask themselves if the answer to the question can be easily found in the book. If so, it should not take the teacher's time. Roughly speaking, if you use the above steps to ask a question, the answer can be found easily by yourself. If you still have to ask the teacher, you ask questions before the preparation will make him feel that you are teachable.\\n\\nFourth, the book is divided into three readings - the general idea, details, focus\\n\\nThe student sits down to the book, picks up a ruler, and uses a color pen to add underlines and other emphasis marks. Read the book once, line by line with marks, which is ruining the book, not reading. The book should be read in three readings.\\n\\nThe first reading is a quick read, reading the general idea, but seeking to know exactly what issue the chapter being read is about. Quick reading is to turn the book, jump reading, read the words but not the whole sentence, to get a general impression. The speed can be amazingly fast when you are used to flipping. Read the general idea, fast turn two or three times the effect is better than not fast and not slow turn once. The second reading is a slow reading, reading details, to ensure understanding of the content. In this second reading, do not understand the place available in pencil on the side of the page as a question mark, but other underlines or marks are not used. The third reading is a selected reading, reading the focus. Emphasis on the mark is to be added to this last pass, because which point is the focus to be selected after a close reading. And the main reason why you need to go through two readings first is that if you do not go through a fast and slow, it is easy to choose the wrong focus.\\n(Indeed, after reading a few times, the knowledge is integrated, then it will be clear which is the focus, which is the same as Qian Zhongshu's reading method)\\nIn college, it is extremely important to choose books to read. A good book or article should be reread and reread again; a single quick reading of a mediocre one will suffice. Top students in graduate school often spend more time selecting readings than reading.\\n\\nAlthough the reading methods I suggest above are focused on college students, the vast majority are also appropriate for elementary and middle school students to study. Take a year or two to develop these reading habits from a young age, and you will find that the joy of reading is hard to describe to the outside world\",\"timestamp\":1639289299,\"title\":\"Zhang Wuchang: The way to read\"},\"digest\":\"i90wUKNAsY6dUz3LhoG51CqnkJk3tBEFSErh1LlYLAU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x078Ad5270b0240D8529f600f35A271Fc6E2b2bD8\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nfoG-CW606K4AadbGslUGcioPZ4-b0kK_uObgVsc2q0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"V1m2-uFUqezX5i_liRFLTisOqXegZo4bDnBIokhWi9A\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"T6Unu0DRI96BnNg65oOoDkC1H_JyHMPossBz1AoGyV_tFuHS4Q-qWgBSFiwWSicdLpf_5wSSHFrFUAeHoxPaMw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x7764069a1a9d93366617eca68c4ca060e5f1166ab33dabc329cb61ebbb47d3f63a1afe7c37fbc1a2d2fee6051297eb48ad17c13afcc1d81c49950b56a76412721b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nfoG-CW606K4AadbGslUGcioPZ4-b0kK_uObgVsc2q0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"V1m2-uFUqezX5i_liRFLTisOqXegZo4bDnBIokhWi9A\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"i90wUKNAsY6dUz3LhoG51CqnkJk3tBEFSErh1LlYLAU\"}"
