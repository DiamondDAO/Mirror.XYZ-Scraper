Contrary to Merkel's welcoming attitude in 2015, the EU as a whole has sought to reinforce its frontier fences and to pay countries such as Libya and Turkey to prevent would-be migrants from traveling on to Europe.\\n\\nRather than sharing the burden of accommodating the newcomers, prosperous northern EU states have placed the burden on countries such as Greece to cope with the challenges. It is a policy that has fostered illegal smuggling of refugees and multiple deaths among migrants thrown from leaky boats at sea.\\n\\nThe debate in Europe has highlighted the problems but almost entirely ignored the benefits of immigration.\\n\\nWith its aging population, Europe stands to benefit from an influx of overwhelmingly young, working-age newcomers. Rather than undermining the economies of host countries, the migrants can actually enhance them.\\n\\nIf and when the present crisis is resolved, it might be time for a more sober debate among Europeans about a more rational strategy that will respond to both the needs of the continent and those who wish to make it their home.\",\"timestamp\":1637330443,\"title\":\"EU crisis puts bloc's long-term failures in spotlight\"},\"digest\":\"d0sXC-xtv25KZQ2FqNAe38G-4xXJfI8R26kuS6fkZOA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x490709d6E7A4A7034e0dB2596f95aFe57a0bda46\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"f58t5Vbx9Z05Rcpq8t06G_EEhubq2-H3DeBlPAYGaTA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"6FDCCbcaMuuyYr8v_2qRYa1tw_eOv5gl2_9YSRPkkAs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"vwnoFB_d3r7hUZzkuZfY6kUHztXLVltfltoEyqqDetVkc3rg6yG4phJeuzHTtxV_e8SYKZ6Njyi7KPfobiUcoQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x578e9e0a9032b2d7ab12b84f019a87e7de0e0de632f2ea78c6e390d567b84f8f1553b8a9e7e614c65af9813a8256d9f133640b299cd663177fee6dbbce40f6861b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"f58t5Vbx9Z05Rcpq8t06G_EEhubq2-H3DeBlPAYGaTA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"6FDCCbcaMuuyYr8v_2qRYa1tw_eOv5gl2_9YSRPkkAs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"d0sXC-xtv25KZQ2FqNAe38G-4xXJfI8R26kuS6fkZOA\"}"
