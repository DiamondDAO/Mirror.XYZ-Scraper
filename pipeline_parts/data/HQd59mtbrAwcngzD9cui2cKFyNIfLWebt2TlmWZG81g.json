"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"[Adshares](https://adshares.net/docs/adshares_whitepaper.pdf) is a decentralized advertisement ecosystem which is an online marketplace between advertisers and publishers based on the open and decentralized blockchain or the open cryptocurrency technology. The goal of this kind of advertisement ecosystem is to directly connect advertisers and publishers which removes the monopoly of intermediaries with as little cost as possible. Although there are no such thing as no cost but the cost for the ecosystem here is only strictly for running the infrastructure. Agreements on the advertisement system are not decided by authorities like the ones found in centralized advertisement platform such as [Adsense](https://www.google.com/adsense/) but decided by both direct advertisers and publishers. Publishers decides what advertisement are allowed on their platforms for example no adult contents and gambling, advertisers decides amount of payment and its mechanism, and without interference from the ecosystem itself except for the fixed fee needed to keep the infrastructure running. In centralized advertisement platforms, publishers are often denied services because of the quantity of contents, quality of contents, and sometimes the origins of the publishers, set the rules which advertisements are allowed where often politics are mixed in, and even the fees that all party have to pay to them. When these platforms decided to ban their advertisers and publishers, the ban can last for indefinite amount time where most of them are for eternity. In decentralized advertisement ecosystem, any publishers can join no matter how small their contents are, and any advertisers can join as long as both parties advertisers and publishers are interested in each other. For advertisers and publishers who are troubled with adblockers, Adshares maybe for you because of its decentralized nature, adblockers will have more difficulty in blocking Adshares ads compared to traditional ads.\",\"timestamp\":1639376278,\"title\":\"Quick Guide to Adshares Decentralized Advertisement Ecosystem\"},\"digest\":\"GH1Rf9eCmtqaBeXYYqcfDadd76JSWFHoCVJEkYUqq9M\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x89305669af6aAf719Ca1Ccf8e6deac2321c21101\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_4pDvj6Mt_lG-5UAbw77WwyJqnAfL_jSt-1SpNHxDlw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"095WDf1fZdgYVR2YHq9ZEXer6krwvERwvMFOKNz0ndE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"aii10xs3RJ2JIDvrZPKd8QdWWwNaQsWyl0YjheqoNo20g7fHsjKLp772KgRU757Iuf_JP-vz1kUeIvveDQDqpw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x75e028ab927a34105a6df1959cdb701dd97f121f7085a7e768075c658ca2233a62a56984d811384d29c229f7f7f02acb098f4316dd1ea4162d01226cd932f2b21c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_4pDvj6Mt_lG-5UAbw77WwyJqnAfL_jSt-1SpNHxDlw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"095WDf1fZdgYVR2YHq9ZEXer6krwvERwvMFOKNz0ndE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"GH1Rf9eCmtqaBeXYYqcfDadd76JSWFHoCVJEkYUqq9M\"}"
