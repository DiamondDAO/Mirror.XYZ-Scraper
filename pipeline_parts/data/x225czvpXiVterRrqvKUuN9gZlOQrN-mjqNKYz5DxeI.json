"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*As part of an ongoing effort to be an early adopter of the metaverse, I am trying something new with this essay. It has been minted as a **collectible edition of NFTs** here on Mirror. By collecting this essay, you get a limited edition NFT of it that you can show off on your profile here on Mirror. All proceeds from the sales will go to the treasury of the Metaverse DAO.*\\n\\n### Foreword\\nI first wrote about the Metaverse in 2018, and overhauled my thinking in a January 2020 update: [The Metaverse: What It Is, Where to Find it, Who Will Build It, and Fortnite](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse). Since then, a lot has happened. COVID-19 forced hundreds of millions into Zoomschool and remote work. Roblox became one of the most popular entertainment experiences in history. Google Trends’ index on the phrase “The Metaverse” hit 100 in March 2021. From January 2005 to December 2020, it never exceeded seven. With that in mind, I thought it was time to do an update - one that reflects how my thinking has changed over the past 18 months and addresses the questions I’ve received during this time, such as “Is the Metaverse here?”, “When will it arrive?”, and “What does it need to grow?”. Welcome to the  ‘THE METAVERSE PRIMER’.\\n\\n### Part 1: A Framework for The Metaverse\\n[](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/forwardtothemetaverseprimer)\\n\\n### Part 2: Hardware and The Metaverse\\n[](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/hardwaremetaverse)\\n\\n### Part 3: Networking and The Metaverse\\n[](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/networkingmetaverse)\\n\\n### Part 4: Compute and The Metaverse\\n[](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/computemetaverse)\\n\\n### Part 5: Virtual Platforms and The Metaverse\\n[](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/virtualplatformsmetaverse)\\n\\n### Part 6: “Interchange Tools & Standards” and The Metaverse\\n[](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/interchangemetaverse)\\n\\n### Part 7: Payment Services and The Metaverse (Coming soon)\\nThis post will be updated when Part 7 launches.\\n\\n### Part 8: Content, Services & Assets in The Metaverse (Coming soon)\\nThis post will be updated when Part 8 launches.\\n\\n### Part 9: Evolving User Behaviors and The Metaverse (Coming soon)\\nThis post will be updated when Part 9 launches.\",\"timestamp\":1625850272,\"title\":\"The Metaverse Primer\",\"publication\":\"d\"},\"digest\":\"qW1wjhJaV_qig2cISpoxy1gStvak2fgeWZgDhkjb4hc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5507dbd48a5A5bAcE8a6030e878cC4E0af147C33\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"F_E5yXpey_ouFci12fHrGSuhnJ4V_IFMydfuqwCbNIw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8wPfdWSwBIGb7v6_ErQeeR0foNAP9_C-3rYNy-WMzjg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"tr8hXHYoClyv6bqkrK111etPEryb-564Ht4BIroLvTe5L9Q-lAijgdXEZK1Lqnk3UDkVCpFC8aTpANqKIinvrg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x45ec88dc0784b1548d8ef45782486336cacd959a8e1b04d0303aa60b82b9319851c7fac5a46f156ef252c5ba4367a92b3215e7cf97a1df6562d103d108323a271c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on d.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"F_E5yXpey_ouFci12fHrGSuhnJ4V_IFMydfuqwCbNIw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8wPfdWSwBIGb7v6_ErQeeR0foNAP9_C-3rYNy-WMzjg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"zRmyR5fi2bJArZkizDxxbyNWn6uaJQBMZgx0V0knRgg\"}"
