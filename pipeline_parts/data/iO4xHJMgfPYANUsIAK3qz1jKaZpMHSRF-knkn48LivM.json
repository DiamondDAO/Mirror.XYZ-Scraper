Fantom生态机会\\n\\nA thread on why I think $FTM can 5-10x in 2022\\n\\nI'll cover:\\n\\n* Why Fantom is one of the most undervalued projects in crypto\\n* How it can 5-10x in 2022 (fundamental analysis and upcoming catalysts)\\n\\nLet's dive in \\n\\n1/25\\n\\n[$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) was 2021's 4th best performer, increasing a massive 14,474%. Yet, it still finds itself lagging behind other L1s like [$AVAX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AVAX&src=cashtag_click), [$SOL](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click) and [$ADA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ADA&src=cashtag_click), despite possessing the qualities to command a top 10 ranking (currently 36). Let's dive into what makes [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) special 2/25\\n\\n[$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG), meaning it is highly scalable and offers near-instant transactions at almost no cost. 3/25\\n\\nIts advanced consensus algorithm, Lachesis, allows $FTM to offer:\\n\\n* Finality in \\\\~1 second: vs $SOL \\\\~11s, and $AVAX \\\\~3s\\n* TPS of 10,000+ (end goal of 300k+)\\n* Extremely cheap transactions (cheaper than $AVAX and comparable to $SOL and $LUNA)\\n\\n4/25\\n\\nConsidering the blockchain trilemma, the only drawback to [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) is centralisation (50 validators), BUT: 1) \\n\\n[@FantomFDN](https://twitter.com/FantomFDN)\\n\\n plans to on board 1000+ validators over the next couple of years 2) Investors have shown they simply don't care (as evidenced by SOL and BNB). 5/25\\n\\nL1s are the backbone of DeFi, NFTs and the Metaverse. Hence, fast, cheap and scalable L1s like [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) offer enormous scope for growth as blockchain utilisation rapidly expands. I believe that [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click)'s superior tech and ecosystem position it nicely to outperform in 2022. 6/25\\n\\nSo, we've established that [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click)'s tech is impressive, but what makes [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) undervalued today? 7/25\\n\\nFirstly, it's size relative to other blockchains means it still has room to grow. [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) is still small compared to other L1s, meaning less capital inflow is required to achieve a 5-10x multiple. Take a look at what the Fantom price could be at competitor's mkt caps: 8/25\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/F3x7senCTDhAcLr8eOxUb.png?height=282&width=679)\\n\\nAs profits filter down from the bigger L1s such as [$SOL](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click) and [$BNB](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BNB&src=cashtag_click), projects with smaller market caps like [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) stand to benefit. [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) presents a valuable opportunity to those who missed the recent explosions of [$SOL](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click) and [$AVAX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AVAX&src=cashtag_click). 9/25\\n\\n2\\\\. [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) is extremely undervalued in TVL terms. TVL (total value locked) represents the dollar amount locked in the ecosystem. Thus, is a great indicator of where DeFi liquidity is flowing. [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) is currently ranked 6th for TVL, yet only has a Mcap/TVL ratio of 1. 10/25\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iR2i4LR7NZGcQJQv7MlSu.png?height=862&width=2228)\\n\\nTake a look at what [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click)'s price would be if it possessed the same Mcap/TVL ratio of its competitors. It's clear based on this metric that [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click)'s price is severely undervalued relative to other chains. 11/25\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ck08e3U_ZZkR4YnlQkuxw.png?height=394&width=1074)\\n\\nThis means that in TVL terms: At today's prices, you're essentially buying [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) at a 2.32x discount to [$AVAX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AVAX&src=cashtag_click), 4.94x discount to [$SOL](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click) etc. This discrepancy should even out over time, thus providing us with a huge opportunity to take advantage now. 12/25\\n\\nTotal TVL is almost touching ATH's, despite the price being down 32% since then (so even relative to [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) itself you're getting a discount). TVL has grown 36% over the past week alone, indicating a strong flow of liquidity back into the [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) ecosystem. 13/25\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gLw0QDTmCR3NeUvX8h5La.png?height=732&width=2236)\\n\\n3\\\\. The Fantom network is one of the most utilised chains, with over 561k daily transactions. At peak, the network reached 1.8m transactions - something not many other chains have achieved. Daily transactions have been consolidating whilst price/TVL are rising (bullish). 14/25\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/npZDMZUSa3FaSN03R8cMZ.png?height=1148&width=2700)\\n\\nThis means [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) has more daily transactions than [$AVAX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AVAX&src=cashtag_click) (470k) and [$ADA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ADA&src=cashtag_click) (500k). Yet, it's price is still 4.83x and 8.79x away respectively. 15/25\\n\\n4\\\\. Fantom has 1.46m active adressess. This is the SAME amount of addresses as [$AVAX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AVAX&src=cashtag_click), and 1.2m more than [$ADA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ADA&src=cashtag_click). This number has been rapidly growing, as shown by the graph below. That's a lot of addresses for a network valued at only $5.8b.. 16/25\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-c1jQoBB9GPWbcmYZ4wZE.png?height=1124&width=2690)\\n\\n5\\\\. Developer activity on [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) is increasing rapidly, and has now overtaken [$AVAX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AVAX&src=cashtag_click) and is comparable to both [$MATIC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&src=cashtag_click) and [$LUNA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LUNA&src=cashtag_click). This suggests many developers are actively building on the Fantom network, which will stimulate the on-boarding of new users over the long term. 17/25\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2nXGEBbYK-6fsrr1oTQc9.png?height=827&width=1600)\\n\\nSo why is it that every [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) metric we look at indicates that it is undervalued compared to other chains? Luckily for us, crypto is an inefficient market. Price often lags behind key metrics - thus providing us a valuable opportunity to capitalise on this discrepancy. 18/25\\n\\nNow let's explore some upcoming catalysts which can assist [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) to 5-10x in 2022. 19/25\\n\\n1\\\\. \\n\\n[@danielesesta](https://twitter.com/danielesesta)\\n\\n has hopped on the [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) train and has implied BIG things are coming in 2022. Fantom integration into Dani's ecosystem will be extremely powerful. \\n\\n[@danielesesta](https://twitter.com/danielesesta)\\n\\n[@AndreCronjeTech](https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech)\\n\\n is a match made in heaven. Don't underestimate the power of the frog nation. 20/25\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PIWL80x-UeohjsgJTXuC2.png?height=782&width=1284)\\n\\n2\\\\. Accessibility. [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) simply hasn't been given the opportunity to appreciate due to lack of US retail access. But, FELIX (Fantom's Binance powered CEX) is coming early Q1 which will finally give retail both access to FTM's ecosystem and provide much needed liquidity. 21/25\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/C0jncfs_cZ1sjCXhoihMN.png?height=722&width=1239)\\n\\n3\\\\. Coinbase. It's no secret the listing is imminent. FELIX + Coinbase in 2022 will be a double whammy of retail accessibility. Coinbase has added 4.6M [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) tokens in the last 30 days (they'll need way more to list, but could be confirmation that a listing is coming). 22/25\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gbA8iEBLYG1rPxbenGrg1.png?height=1194&width=2678)\\n\\n4\\\\. FVM. Fantom Virtual Machine is coming in 2022/2023 and will massively increase scalability, allowing the network to both expand and become more secure. I'm expecting the price to rise significantly \\\"in the hype\\\" to FVM as more info is released. Mega bullish. 23/25\\n\\n1. A few more potential catalysts\\n\\n@AndreCronjeTech\\n\\n* Artion v2 (NFTs)\\n* AAVE $FTM integration\\n* Fantom Name Service\\n* \\n\\n@harryyeh\\n眨眼脸\\n\\n24/25\\n\\nIt's clear there is A LOT to look forward to, and that [$FTM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTM&src=cashtag_click) is one the most undervalued projects in crypto right now. I'm personally continuing to accumulate, with accelerated purchasing during dips.
