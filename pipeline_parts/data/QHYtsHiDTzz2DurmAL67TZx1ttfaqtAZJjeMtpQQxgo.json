"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Any behavior consumes time and energy. A good boss invests his energy and time in the most rewarding place. A boss must figure out exactly what he should do to make the most worthwhile.\\n\\nFirst of all, I think making money is the most important thing, because with money, I can live a good life and survive, and with money, I can reproduce. In fact, every species essentially only\\n\\n146 Entrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs\\n\\nTwo things, the first is survival; the second is reproduction. Both of these things are based on resources, and for most people, there are resources when they have money.\\n\\nSo making money, the money I can make by myself is very limited. I have to bring the team, but unfortunately there is no ready-made team to bring me, then I have to do a good job of recruiting. After this reasoning, I should devote a lot of time and energy to recruiting excellent talents; secondly, I should lead the team.\\n\\nI like to study history. Zeng Guofan fought with Shi Da. Zeng Guofan basically lost. In fact, Zeng Guofan basically loses when he fights with anyone. But why does a person who often defeats battles gain such a high reputation? Why is the status so high?\\n\\nIt was because Zeng Guofan went to any place, regardless of military machinery, food and grass, or local government affairs. The first thing he asked was whether there were talents here. Once there were talents, he asked the people to write them down and train them. For example, Li Hongzhang and Zuo Zongtang were all cultivated by Zeng Guofan. Zeng Guofan couldn't beat himself, so he asked a capable person to fight. The capable person was beaten to death, and he found another capable person to fight. As long as he doesn't die, he will look for talented people everywhere, and he spends most of his time on the Internet, so he has a lot of talents. There is a saying that Zeng Guofan's big camp basically gathered talents from the entire Qing Dynasty. Therefore, Zeng Guofan can certainly win the final victory.\\n\\nI think that recruiting talents is the most important job of the boss, and even the team can be handed over to talents! Therefore, the recruitment work basically takes up one-third of my time, and the recruitment work is always carried out by the boss himself, which is considered the core work. This is what the boss really should do. All other tasks are trivial, and only by grasping the roots of things can they be considered superior.\",\"timestamp\":1634797649,\"title\":\"What should the boss do\"},\"digest\":\"siyG0Xkctp_8ZrNfbAtW6BB3oH3reI_EenBD_BtnQ4U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"nN5UewvE-MpvzJJoT-ruOM2kZiw239hJy32zvmFBj5PvZLZaWI1WJy1NjPqWfXlNOx8YHSteF2PgWzg_EOGyTg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"siyG0Xkctp_8ZrNfbAtW6BB3oH3reI_EenBD_BtnQ4U\"}"
