"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"SparkDAO is an investment research group focusing on the field of digital encryption, with members distributed all over the world. We are keen to explore the underlying logic and cutting-edge tracks in the field of digital encryption. Welcome to our Twitter: sparkdao_io\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vZ7dlextoFgHUyjDOaMEy.jpg?height=388&width=900)\\n\\nWith the advent of different virtual environments like VR applications, social networks, and virtual worlds, we are taking a big step towards the mainstream metaverse.Due to external factors such as the epidemic, people began to adapt to isolated environments such as indoors, and it has now become a trend to leisurely experience the vast virtual world at home.\\n\\nEvery technological advance, at a cost, while seemingly inevitable, is not unconditional.The metaverse will change the way we interact and socialize with each other, and the way we travel, shop, and consume information.But in this interconnected universe, we will also face more new challenges and risks, especially with respect to data privacy.\\n\\n### Greater data correlation in the virtual world\\n\\nFrom a current perspective, most of the virtual worlds today are [fragmented.As](http://fragmented.As) ultra-high speed and technology support an immersive experience, we can expect them to slowly merge.Technology allows everyone to have a full metaverse [experience.As](http://experience.As) a result, more users will have access to the metaverse and more data will circulate through the metaverse.\\n\\nProjects in the metaverse can collect personal information through multiple channels (such as wearable devices, microphones and respiratory monitors, and user interaction) for personal identification, advertising tracking, which will be tracked to an unprecedented level.This easily creates a virtual world without privacy.\\n\\nAt the same time, the project party can selectively place users in a specific environment and provide users with content that only selected people can see, thus distorting the reality, forming user-biased views and expanding the differences between people.Leaving the Mettaverse will not be as easy as removing AR glasses, as users already rely heavily on technology.\\n\\nTherefore, both users and companies need to carefully consider and protect the privacy in the meta-Universe, and when developing dependent technologies, they should start to achieve privacy protection through design.\\n\\n### How does multi-dimensional data ensure security?\\n\\nThe first thing is the hardware data.The current hardware of the metaverse has been significantly improved, especially in the VR field.Data and AI applications will become more widespread.Today's data analysis and AI technology are just starting, but the potential are many uses.\\n\\nThe new generation of hardware devices will collect more user information, including testing user pressure levels, and even facial recognition information.This data will comprehensively collect the biometric features generated by individuals and be able to use it to enhance the virtual experience.\\n\\nUsers may just run software on digital devices, but in fact, they unknowingly have leaked multiple dimensions of data, so users can output the data through gesture control, gaze mode, and gaze position.\\n\\nIf we consider big data security as a whole, we can divide it into two parts: —— static data and real-time data.Everyone understands why it is more valuable to provide multi-dimensional real-time information to make business decisions faster.The most rapid response to provide data analysis is with the head when the data is [generated.So](http://generated.So) as we slowly build the metaverse, real-time data security will be a new security paradigm for various projects to focus on.\\n\\n### 6 Dimensions of the Metaverse Project Data Security Assessment\\n\\nCompanies must consider six factors when preparing to operate in the Metaverse.\\n1\\\\.With the inflow of new data types, the mechanism must be flexibly improved;\\n2\\\\. Whether the device can collect various types of data, including user biometric information;\\n3\\\\. Users must be educated on privacy impacts, and consent mechanisms must be simple enough for users to understand; moreover, consent terms should be updated regularly without assuming permanent permissions, and these mechanisms must be upgraded for each new data type.\\n4\\\\. Users must be notified when interacting with AI; the metaverse will consof human and AI entities —— over time, it may be difficult to distinguish the [two.To](http://two.To) be fully transparent, AI robots (or digital humans) must be labeled so that users can always know who they share their data with.Furthermore, these AI robots are —— modeled on human models willing to share their biometric data and must therefore clearly outline the rights and consent rules governing these transactions. 5. Projects need self-supervision.For example, in privacy-conscious browsers such as Brave, cookie is closed by default, and users can collect rewards or tokens if they want to view targeted ads. 6.VR equipment must be specially designed specifically for data security. Since the metaverse will accommodate a large amount of user data, the technology must be unassailable.Developers must be careful to control vulnerabilities to a minimum and adopt security coding [principles.In](http://principles.In) the long run, data leaks and unexpected exposures can be costly for the company and require regular testing and upgrades to address the problem.\\nOf course, in some cases, projects must choose between data privacy and user convenience or ease of use.But all this effort will greatly help to build a secure, privacy-sensitive, and regulated meta-universe for its users.Meanwhile, other Web2.0 companies that build their own or wish to operate in a metaverse now must follow similar principles, even more than a decade before true mass acceptance.\\n\\n\\\\*The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of SparkDAO.
