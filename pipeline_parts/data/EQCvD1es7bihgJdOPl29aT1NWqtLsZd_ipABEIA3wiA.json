"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Many visitors come to Wikipedia to acquire knowledge, while others come to share knowledge. At this very instant, dozens of articles are being improved, and [new articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:NewPages) are also being created. Changes can be viewed at the [Recent changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:RecentChanges) page and a random page at [random articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random). 6,024 articles have been designated by the Wikipedia community as [featured articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_articles), exemplifying the best articles in the encyclopedia. Another 35,261 articles are designated as [good articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Good_articles). Some information on Wikipedia is organized into [lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists); the best of these are designated as [featured lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_lists). Wikipedia also has [portals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Portals), which organize content around topic areas. Articles can be found using the [search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Searching) box on the screen's top-right side or, if using the Monobook skin, a bit lower along the left-hand side.\\n\\nWikipedia is available in languages other than English. Wikipedia has [more than 300 languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:SiteMatrix), including a [Simple English](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/) version, and related projects include a dictionary, quotations, books, manuals, scientific reference sources, a travel guide, a data repository, and a news service (see [sister projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About#Sister_projects)).
