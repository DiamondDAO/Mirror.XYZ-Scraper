"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"NFT Collections on GENIACE are all about iconic imagery: people, places, or moments in time. So we are super excited to introduce our beta NFT drop which features our adopted symbol of good fortune and prosperity: the iconic maneki neko (often simply knows as the Lucky Cat, in Japanese it literally translates to ‚Äúbeckoning cat‚Äù). These iconic cats can be found in art, fashion, and even video games.\\nWe have big plans for our MANEKIS ‚Äî over time, we will be releasing different collections featuring this icon, each with a different creative theme, holder benefits, and even a P2E game idea in the works.\\nIn this very first MANEKI Collection, we have gone back to basics, to the very fundamentals of nature ‚Äî to the Periodic Table of Elements ‚Äî and picked 10 metals to cast our MANEKI NFTs in. We hope you love them as much as we do. Read on below for the FAQ detailing the drop:\\nQ: How many NFTs in the MANEKI Metals Collection?\\nA: There will be a total of 150 individual NFTs in this Collection structured as follows:\\n‚Äî 120 Collectible (6 metals with 20 editions each)\\n‚Äî 20 Rare (2 metals with 10 editions each)\\n‚Äî 10 Ultra Rare (2 metals with 5 editions each)\\nSee the full collection here: <https://www.geniace.com/metalmanekis/>\\n\\nMANEKI Metal Drop Structure\\nQ: How do I get my hands on MANEKI Metal NFT?\\nA: As a reward to our earliest community supporters, we are airdropping ALL of the 120 Collectible rarity editions in this Collection to those who signed up early. The remaining 30 will be put on sale on the GENIACE marketplace when it goes live in late 2021 (yes, real soon).\\nQ: How much will MANEKI Metals NFTs cost?\\nA: Pricing for the Rare and Ultra Rare editions in the Collection will be announced closer to the time of sale. Collectible rarity editions can be placed for sale our marketplace by holders (our early community supporters who received them in the Airdrop) ‚Äî but we expect them to hold on tightly to them, as they come with benefits beyond their art and trading value.
