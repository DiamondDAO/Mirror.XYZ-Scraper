When tokens are leveraged properly, we have the ability to create value sponges built upon virtuous economic loops that reflect the holistic prosperity of those that coordinate. We break past the false dichotomy of the business and the customer and realize that each is part of the same whole providing value to the collective. Such value need not be only thought about as transactional and extractive.\\n\\nSuch dynamics are often studied in the developing field of tokenomics.\\n\\nIn the title of this essay, we are very intentional about using the word ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù. We purposefully avoid using words like protocols, DAOs, or just tokens. This is because the dynamics we describe can only be realized by looking at collections of people \\\\[companies, DAOs, nonprofits, clubs\\\\] as integrated ecosystems, as opposed to input-output factories. Such is the evolution in organizational understanding.\\n\\n# Status Quo\\n\\nMuch has been written about the present-day problems with Web2. We‚Äôll touch on these briefly in case you are unfamiliar with them.\\n\\nMuch of it can be summed up in this famous graphic:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Y0x3ol5sMz0-sRf2xO6T0.png?height=546&width=1344)\\n\\nIn essence, companies building platforms leverage VC dollars to incentivize users to embed the company‚Äôs technology within their lives. With the goal of eventually making you dependent on them \\\\[in tech parlance ‚Äústicky‚Äù\\\\]. After which, they have the total economic freedom to sell your data, add 3rd party restrictions, vertically integrate, and other extractive behaviors in order to generate massive cash flows.\\n\\nNot only are the participants in these platforms not given ownership of the value they helped generate, but the employees that work in these companies are largely jaded, unchallenged, and dissatisfied. Really only the founders, early employees, and investors get the symmetric economic upside and feel satisfied by the system as it exists today. At the macro level, we see this as the economic and social gulf between Silicon Valley and the rest of the world.\\n\\nWhen we begin thinking about organizations as ecosystems, the key change in thinking is understanding how integrated the different members of the organization are with each other. With that understanding, one realizes how dependent the health of the whole is dependent on the health of each of its constituents. Whereas, in a factory, we think of each worker as replaceable and modular.\\n\\nIn ecological ecosystems, when one species dies, the balance is thrown off, and everyone feels that pain. Symmetrically, when there is general health and balance, the ecosystem can thrive and each participant experiences prosperity.\\n\\nThe relationship idealized in a graph can be summarized as:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qk2nTq1YmgY984wVaBIlJ.png?height=656&width=758)\\n\\n# Token Ecosystems\\n\\nToken ecosystems allow us to create such localized economic systems that can access the virtuous loops which leverage the integrated nature between the individual and the ecosystem. To be really specific about the relationship the graph alludes to - not only can virtuous loops be used to produce more value with the ecosystem, but that value generation can also be directly cycled back to the individual. A deeply bilateral relationship.\\n\\nLet‚Äôs understand what this means with an example. Consider a DAO that exists to create a worker-owned, decentralized UpWork. A token, call it $GIG, exists as the governance token of that ecosystem. Such a token may be used to pay for the education of the workers on the platform such that the value of service the workers can provide to their customers is of higher quality. Workers then can actually get paid to get educated and upskilled. The token used to fund that public good, like education, is ultimately able to capture the value the public good provides.\\n\\nThis is magical! And it should also look familiar. Human society‚Äôs biggest institutions: governments, states, and cities, have been precisely able to function in this capacity because they can access the same virtuous loops. Instead of paying for and capturing that value with a token, governments do it through taxes.\\n\\nThe model the government runs on approximates this model. Providing certain services at free or reduced costs to its citizens by charging them a % rate of their income for access to that service. It hopes that access to the service increases the wealth of its citizenry and therefore covers the cost of providing that service. It can provide healthcare for free because healthier people produce more tax dollars. It can provide education for free since better-educated individuals produce more tax dollars. It can provide legal and financial services for free for the same exact reason ‚Äî people with access to the service will be richer in the future. So the government makes money by making its citizens richer and taking a percentage of that newly increased amount.\\n\\nHowever, taxes certainly don‚Äôt feel this way. Because they are enforced by violence, they can be easily abused and end up feeling more extractive. Certainly, private individuals and companies cannot utilize the same mechanism to fund the goods that they think are valuable and important.\\n\\nThat is at the core of why token ecosystems are so beautiful. Tokens let protocols pay customers with equity to use them if the developers believe their protocol will make people‚Äôs lives better. As that thesis plays out, the token ends up being worth more. A similar relationship with the people that contribute, and not just use, to the development of the protocol.¬†\\n\\nThis is an unprecedented economic model that was previously gated to governments but can now be accessed by individuals. Imagine colleges actually paying people to get educated because them getting educated properly is such a massive net benefit to the society and economic system we all participate in. That‚Äôs the future relationship we are all building towards.\\n\\n# Existing Usage - MetaFactory\\n\\nWe talk about MetaFactory a lot in these essays about Web3 and Value Physics as they are really defining this frontier.\\n\\nMetaFactory:\\n\\n1. MetaFactory airdrops $ROBOT tokens to all contractors, designers, and artists that they work with.\\n2. Artists are totally shaken by this as they are not used to a relationship that isn‚Äôt purely transactional by nature.\\n3. Their art is turned into a product of whatever form and distributed by MetaFactory.\\n4. When their art is recognized, valued, and bought by people, the value of $ROBOT increases.\\n5. The artist is makes money from the sale and from the appreciation of the governance token.\\n6. The artist can use that extra capital and do more to contribute to the MetaFactory ecosystem, driving more value to the $ROBOT token!\\n7. MetaFactory is also able to pay people to purchase their gear because they know when people own their merchandise, they are supporting sustainable fashion done by artists that are directly able to share in the value that they created.\\n\\nWeb3 must exist to perpetuate this model further.\\n\\nWe‚Äôre in a world of ecosystems, not companies. Of emergent organisms, not factories.\\n\\nWe‚Äôre not trying to destroy old institutions, we‚Äôre just throwing a better party!\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n**METADREAMER NOTE:**\\n\\nüíØüíØüíØ gigabrain shit\\n\\nI think that‚Äôs exactly how it will be, the thing we need to get there is a way to measure and quantify the long term value created by certain actions and then retroactively reward those things. Right now the only time Value is distributed is at the intersection of monetary transactions, but if we have a cryptographic record of everything that happened leading to that transaction then we can ‚Äúback propagate‚Äù resources to the chain of events and people that led to that value creation.\\n\\nAt that point people won‚Äôt just optimize to do actions that result in their immediate personal monetary gain, but actions that long term benefit the most number of people. Climate change is a perfect example of this, e.g. we have no way to quantify the long term value that a tree has, but someone can cut that tree and sell it for immediate monetary gain so that‚Äôs what they do, even though that tree would likely create 100x more net value for the world than the value of cutting and selling it. From the individuals perspective leaving the tree along benefits them 0.001x but cutting it benefits them 1x, so that‚Äôs what they choose. If instead they had a way to capture the 100x value they would instead turn to planting more trees and taking care of them since they would become a part of the ‚Äúcausal chain‚Äù of value creation by that tree.\",\"timestamp\":1636412133,\"title\":\"Token Ecosystems as Value Sponges\"},\"digest\":\"qqYKlCrIg-cOsCIA69vru0vtUPFgy7wBoLXTzHKIweA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x421f223e19877D9765Ecd6e8EC4812457229B36A\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"oDf7gKlrJWhskpT9bw-guLKwMuwXPBmGxbY9aYNQJ2E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0ceGL8Pg8Y07Ua9ZixqSgfmiaIqv4CvPiDmZRjEkGyg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"RGemJvMILIl0xW4ovplANgNmwC5GeMWmuewUqJd2GoGS96FYhf3qsEmWrKGi_m_w1hFkN4vOeA2QTZ-ZLosX2g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4c028a6a60cef63369d24dcdc3e3044e51a431c82fbd8c7ff0dd8d3abd8cb89266268c770aa4a8244314e73f4d7bc5fad926c7f8bd9425ff071d9e849755a8eb1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"oDf7gKlrJWhskpT9bw-guLKwMuwXPBmGxbY9aYNQJ2E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0ceGL8Pg8Y07Ua9ZixqSgfmiaIqv4CvPiDmZRjEkGyg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"qqYKlCrIg-cOsCIA69vru0vtUPFgy7wBoLXTzHKIweA\"}"
