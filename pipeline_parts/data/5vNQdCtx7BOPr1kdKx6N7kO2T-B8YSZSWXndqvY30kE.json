"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"> This can happen by achieving a synergy between AML, fraud investigations and an open data ecosystem that takes the security of crypto financial markets to a level never seen before or even thought possible in traditional finance.”\\n\\nIn this regard, he believes that a threefold solution is needed — i.e., one that is based on an AML technological platform that enables institutions to verify the risk of blockchain transaction counterparties and meet their regulatory obligations. Not only that, but the platform should also have the capability to facilitate end-to-end investigations in cases where funds are reported missing as well as incentivize the reporting of suspicious activities. Aleksander closed out by saying: “If the industry collectively adopts such solutions and processes, the capability of such scams of not only being successful but being able to take advantage of the stolen funds will become severely limited.”\\n\\nA similar point of view is shared by Jefferies, who also believes that banks, VASPs and other money service businesses can safeguard themselves against bad actors that are utilizing their platforms and payment networks to launder money as well as engage in other illegal activities by deploying effective AML measures.\\n\\n## How do Bitcoin ATMs fit into all of this?\\n\\nA striking aspect of CipherTrace’s above-mentioned report involves the “exponential” rise of funds being sent to high-risk exchanges from United States-based [Bitcoin ATMs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/cointelegraph-research-demand-for-bitcoin-grows-after-halving) rather than lower-risk entities such as established crypto exchanges. This has prompted experts to believe that BATMs may be at a greater risk of being used to launder money, especially given the preponderance of funds sent from them overseas, potentially to jurisdictions with lax AML and Know Your Customer policies.\\n\\nProviding his insights on the matter, Jefferies stated that part of the reason for the increasing use of BATMs by money launderers, such as in the Kunal Kalra [case](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/westwood-man-agrees-plead-guilty-federal-narcotics-money-laundering-charges-running), is their increasing ubiquity across the U.S. He added:\\n\\n> “Even in spite of the growing availability of priv\",\"timestamp\":1639122056,\"title\":\"Related: On the Darknet Side: The Role of Crypto as a Means of Exchange\"},\"digest\":\"k-OFTIeztWKHDrLcDlwJdUi64NeDc-98ekXmXJpIokU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x96A7136A24B3132c359ED5C28e1507D5AE738d33\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"QCK9r5mcvo4tqtnKe17X5LH0WIcN0LTRyt1Mf9A1kRc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"X--0EXkE-Vm6Kt0JeBoiALekH4-a9IOQf-Q8jWzm4W4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"r6dDMBu9cbU9l4qE5hcw9JISE5Pq8phvmSXdZUiufYGqahglX30Sjtai3fKXkRiLYS0pbpdJCA64QSF_ZGNVow\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xcc8ad8ece14190e800f39a7095e37fb6197e16e270b6c30ebec27ed1efc05e657fec3114da7181b4afad31a98a3178970d77e6d7b9a1122da377b4ad88891bad1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"QCK9r5mcvo4tqtnKe17X5LH0WIcN0LTRyt1Mf9A1kRc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"X--0EXkE-Vm6Kt0JeBoiALekH4-a9IOQf-Q8jWzm4W4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"k-OFTIeztWKHDrLcDlwJdUi64NeDc-98ekXmXJpIokU\"}"
