"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"It seems like Web3 and NFTs became a household name in the past few weeks. Major publications are constantly writing about the topic. If you are working in the “startups world” that’s all you can hear about.\\n\\nIt’s easy to make a mistake and think that Web3 has already taken over the world and become mainstream. But the reality is that Web3 is still in a very early stage. Many problems still need to be solved, and many basic building blocks still need to be developed for the average consumer to hop on the train.\\n\\nOne of these building blocks is identity.\\n\\nThe beauty of Web3 is that it allows us all to stop for a second, reflect on how the Internet (Web2) became what it is today, and understand all the mistakes we have made building this industry. Then, we get a chance to start fresh and do things better.\\n\\nAs such, identity in Web3 should behave very differently than in Web2. There are several essential features and values it should adhere to:\\n\\n* The right for anonymity - Today, in Web2, almost any service you register to requires you to enter your private information and tie your user name to an email or a phone number, which in many cases points to your real-world identity.\\n  Web3 promise is based on the fact that all you need is a wallet. You can use this wallet to connect to any Web3 service and maintain your privacy. In fact, you can own multiple wallets and as such, maintain multiple identities.\\n* Owning your personal information - In Web2, you have to provide your personal information again and again to each service you start using. If tomorrow you decide to change your email address, phone, or even name, you have to go and change it across every service you use. \\n Web3 allows us to change that. Your personal information can be a native construct, fully owned and managed by you. This in return will enable each service to to ask your permission to access things like name, gender, phone number, or even things such as interests and hobbies. If you want to change this data, you will have to change it just one time, and all services you connect to immediately will receive the new info. Even better, ideally, you will be able to manage multiple identities and decide which one to use for each service. For example, you could have one identity for the metaverse games you play and a different one for your professional/business services. We can already see the emergence of such capabilities with [IDX](https://idx.xyz/) and potentially [ENS](https://ens.domains/).\\n* A living CV - NFTs are a game-changer for almost any industry you can imagine. They open up numerous new potential business models. And with the emergence of social tokens, they can also represent your passions and activity.\\n  Even better, they leave a trail of breadcrumbs of your involvement with different projects and services. Maybe you were one of the early fans of a particular band, and you received a special NFT giving you access to their fan club. Or perhaps you were one of the early backers and activist of a particular DAO or nonprofit?\\n\\n  This data - the social tokens you got and when you got them will forever be written in the blockchain. It’s living proof of when and potentially how much you were involved with (or how passionate you are) with different services, projects, and brands. You can finally prove you are indeed the biggest fan of X.\\n  Even better, because the data is written in the blockchain, there is no entity that owns it and the chance that if they go down, you will lose all the data and your reputation.\\n* Multichain support - The same way you don’t expect to have one identity for Windows and one for Mac or Xbox or PlayStation or any other platform, also in Web3, your identity should just work across different chains.\\n\\nIf you are excited about such a future like me, the next question probably in your mind is, where do we start?\\n\\nThat was what I was asking myself a few weeks ago. As I dove deeper and deeper into Web3, I wanted a way to represent myself in this world. I wanted a way to showcase my profile and do it in a way that would be customizable and express my personality.\\n\\nI was surprised that I simply couldn’t find such a way. Most people still use their Twitter profile or some other Web2 profile. Others were sharing their OpenSea page as a way to showcase their NFTs, but this felt like the equivalent of using your eBay profile as your identity.\\n\\nAnd this is how [Gallerium](https://www.gallerium.xyz) was born. I decided that if such a service doesn’t exist, I should just build it. Gallerium is built on top of the vision I described above - A Web3 native project that respects the values of web3. A service that allows you to control how to showcase your identity fully. Whether it’s by showcasing the topics you care about or the art and artists you appreciate - you can easily claim your profile handle and URL, decide which personal data to share and fully customize your profile using pre-defined layouts and themes.\\n\\nYou are in complete control of what personal data you want to share with the world and can make your identity page look and feel, well, like you.\\n\\n[Gallerium](https://www.gallerium.xyz) supports six different chains (and adding more) and unlimited wallets, allowing you to truly build and represent your Web3 identity no matter where you operate most.\\n\\nAlthough I think [Gallerium](https://www.gallerium.xyz) is already the most versatile and beautiful way to represent yourself in Web3, it is still a very early stage product. There are so many things we want to add to it. As such - I would love to get your feedback. Please feel free to comment here or DM me with your thoughts, suggestions, and yes - also criticism.\\n\\nI'm excited about the potential of Web3, and hopefully, we can all learn from our Web2 past mistakes and build a better future together.\",\"timestamp\":1641136604,\"title\":\"The Future of Web3 Identity\"},\"digest\":\"Z7yezxhx23xQ_yYRWL_mdXQvotI7Yv55v3ryx9Ec4ys\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xF574377771de70D876119A650E5BA660c0d0A423\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Cqxxj5L6zF4UIyeyeyZHbvRm9gc7v_60MQTcssP_ETo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"WLNFsbPBxv6h-6XEQI4QGQf6ux7Ssvu4Rfvbb6kJA2M\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"mFbOz6Vl_yPDhCaeGRfcdb3RJYgA3voEEXFOp1RbECxtwtkQqN_FWKf0VjY_wzbyYN362uWaLPIrq7l45GGu0Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5f3eae8a48e30a0852451f572aaa6a7a92864e9b03b571225aeec8d347bf907512540bd829163abfc8c6a8713c60fb721d305cff7ea983811c7e30a8081539881c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Cqxxj5L6zF4UIyeyeyZHbvRm9gc7v_60MQTcssP_ETo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"WLNFsbPBxv6h-6XEQI4QGQf6ux7Ssvu4Rfvbb6kJA2M\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"8TQ1jGpUDERwV6azKWAmqgIZkbCdBwFyluPBvdKpA48\"}"
