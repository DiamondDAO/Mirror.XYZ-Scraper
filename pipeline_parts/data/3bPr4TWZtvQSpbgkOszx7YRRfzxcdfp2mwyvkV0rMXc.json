"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"DAS is the future, the best decentralized identity choice in the web3.0 world. In the following, I will use the simplest description to make the conclusion about DAS.\\n\\n## 一、What is DAS:\\n\\nDAS is a blockchain-based, open source, cross-chain decentralized account system that provides a globally unique naming system with a .bit suffix that can be used for cryptocurrency transfers, domain name resolution, authentication, and other scenarios.\\n\\nDAS is the first decentralized account system with broad compatibility, allowing users to register and manage the DAS accounts using any public chain address or even email.\\n\\nThe core elements of a DAS account are: the owner/manager, and the parsed record (i.e. the data it is associated with). Unlike ENS, the owner/manager of DAS can be any public chain private key or even email; unlike DNS, DAS supports any type of parsed record.\\n\\nIn summary, you need a decentralized identity in the world of web3.0 (or in the current fiery meta-universe world). You have a decentralized identity. You are not afraid of entering the wrong address and copying the wrong address. Don’t be afraid of not having personality. They are all a long list of words, have an identity, and have a unique identity that belongs to you.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Y7Rw-ZvvXkI1pDhqOYcHz.png?height=1100&width=2622)\\n\\nAll DAS accounts end with .bit, have a hierarchical structure and are unique. A typical DAS account is in the form of alice.bit, office.bob.bit. Each DAS account contains the following basic abstract structure:\\n\\nOwner, the ultimate owner of the DAS account, can transfer the account and set up the administrator of the account.\\n\\nManager, the administrator of the DAS account, can manage the records, sub-accounts, etc. of the account.\\n\\nRecords, the analytical record array of the DAS account. Parsing records are a series of key-value pairs, which are defined by users or applications. Various analysis records constitute a complete description of an identity. Records can only be managed by Manager, not by Owner.\\n\\nOwner and Manager are generally one or more public keys. When there are multiple public keys, it means that the role of the role can be achieved through some kind of multi-signature.\\n\\n## 二、What are the advantages of DAS:\\n\\n1. Support cross-chain. The decentralized identity of other people's homes basically does not support cross-chain. This is powerful enough.\\n2. Support forward and reverse recording. You can easily set up reverse records, and your identity is up to you.\\n\\nSetting up reverse records allows DApp to display your favorite .bit account instead of a lengthy blockchain address, and at the same time makes transfers more secure. At present, all wallets and transfers and withdrawals use addresses, which is inconvenient and not easy. It's easy to get it wrong.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZEMFN9N9dQllOdd4BCQzL.png?height=792&width=1400)\\n\\n3、DAS also has your personal domain name address and automatically obtains your NFT, your POAP, binds your Twitter and other information, owns your personalized address and spatial information, and can ensure authenticity, is it very cool.\\n\\n## 三、How to obtain DAS:\\n\\nVery simple, click on the URL:\\n\\n[https://app.da.systems/explorer?inviter=dooog.bit](https://app.da.systems/explorer?inviter=dooog.bit)\\n\\nAfter jumping in, check the URL you want and click to buy. There are many ways to purchase and payment. You can transfer and pay. You can buy by yourself. Currently, it is gradually open, except for some reserved accounts. Others can try your luck. After purchase, set up and bind your various addresses. In the future, in the supported exchanges and wallets, you can identify your address as long as you enter your DAS identity information. Both the commonly used binance and imtoken are supported.\\n\\nBefore the real outbreak of DAS, you can consider having your own DAS account.\\n\\nHaving a decentralized identity of DAS is also a step for you to enter web3.0.\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1640536554,\"title\":\"Das is the future\"},\"digest\":\"AnEvQrdimhE7YhXHcClq3vW-KT6-swDffH0SvnbCFaw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8068BD398396B060d820745FDE9C545a38bb776d\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MWWVRqt-pc_Kf15dKQ-tY8gyj7HV6kg8JEhPr3EIJ08\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Wx_j45SmjEPbXbaCR0zoQxVpTvBWgUB65FQsYHvQCGw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"aSefIy5qd4u-xsBxmy0wfNnygXcvtpbZRmnIWmXGFFseIp-5cf9F3iI0iMXyeH_IqhqC5Xn_UyS9GXCnMtcePw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x693ac3d40158468559bd90dbc9154bd4329588cfe732453b1edd9b16f899bed937b1c769e95011e586b108a68750ebefc6d2f9bdaf11248820222015ec3e9e381b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MWWVRqt-pc_Kf15dKQ-tY8gyj7HV6kg8JEhPr3EIJ08\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Wx_j45SmjEPbXbaCR0zoQxVpTvBWgUB65FQsYHvQCGw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"AnEvQrdimhE7YhXHcClq3vW-KT6-swDffH0SvnbCFaw\"}"
