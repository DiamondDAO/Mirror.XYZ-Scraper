"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"October has always been a month of change for me. This year, October was the month I decided to leave “corporate America”, and start working full time in web3. However, it’s a big leap to go from a steady paycheck, benefits, and fiat ACH deposits, to identifying as an S Corp, getting paid in crypto, and being the master of your own ship. I was wrestling with the uncertainty of this throughout the duration. The good news is that a lot of the ducks are already in a row if you know where to look.\\n\\nThere is an abundance of opportunity for developers, and other skill sets I can’t speak first hand on, to go full time DAO. There are legal structures out there in innovative states like Colorado and Wyoming which make it possible to obtain liability protections, pseudo-anonymity, and benefits as a public utility. [Opolis](https://opolis.co/), for example, takes a lot of the concern out of benefits and tax compliance that a new entrepreneur might face, especially one whose accounts receivable are denominated in crypto. Banking for new crypto companies can be hard to find, a lot of banks just won’t bank an early stage company involved in the blockchain development space. But there are banks out there if you can’t go completely bankless.\\n\\nFinding work? It’s a bonanza at present, with huge capital inflows, and more things to be built than builders. Organizations like [Raid Guild](https://raidguild.org/) provide a place for developers to partner with business development, project management, artists; all without the overhead of traditional corporations. This efficiency leads to a better bottom line, and stakeholder benefit for the member.\\n\\nThe only question I had in my hand after lamenting the risks for a month was, could I afford not to leap? The answer for me; no.\",\"timestamp\":1635895226,\"title\":\"Towards an on chain life\"},\"digest\":\"t0IhcJEjcScobHFA3bLm9v5R4-iIVn6TDGdT9xvfoKY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x36273803306a3C22bc848f8Db761e974697ece0d\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"CqG2vMoi2kV7gx9PM908z8MnYcn71elEM4_bsG-tY-M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Y7nUblpvEh4sTy0A-tB-fOsZj3QFFH5vV6dEvegvTFw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"JkTr2rbXmso28HYI4mP2NPAnYItdqiIa2iKPN3tR2C7-EX_42J1e6VMyFJ4guZYeRM-ZKrNNbZVhpCBZ5GZAnw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x679b27506f6bef4b716300306d0b1f3e6defecb7fa7304763c428b156a97da7941173f7d6b3f91e2dd6dcc97706b9ca1e6ab6d6d58a199c2f091c3f4a43c42aa01\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"CqG2vMoi2kV7gx9PM908z8MnYcn71elEM4_bsG-tY-M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Y7nUblpvEh4sTy0A-tB-fOsZj3QFFH5vV6dEvegvTFw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"yTVcI-QT5oPnOrrJuVXF2UnnFyLPPhIQ3NxlCGqGqDY\"}"
