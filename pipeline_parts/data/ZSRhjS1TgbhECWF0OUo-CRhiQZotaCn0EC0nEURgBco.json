Is there any art there or we like, what we value in them is only money?”.\\n\\nWatch the full interview on our YouTube channel and don’t forget to subscribe!\",\"timestamp\":1639207881,\"title\":\"Why the world’s largest museum is embracing NFT technology\"},\"digest\":\"OxL2dq3vyDOCwd5yuszWu9v7JRxCKFQ8MAwt47wIfTQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x505A84687FEdD24447Abc123C0af5f606275435c\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tE_2rqFmqJsIoH4RB8oYCyzIqV3zbFfjGavcOPrbxf8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"CWCJjQv44ZDDBpyGB2wZ3uGnt-zoMTy2ajmE8S6T4z0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"nOKi-OzU-5ERlnD_zYNI5UsLPG3_yY_1omyYmqqr1oizf2oni5Cs_mf3qibU8N1D25BHKWGijlTgBPzKEqSDHw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x80761498258046f11345a69d120dd417e7fd9335c2e92662e7b7439aac683837763ac0d8ccfc36d5494c2c35e161c858f8ca89009fcad790f130b8feadf0794b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tE_2rqFmqJsIoH4RB8oYCyzIqV3zbFfjGavcOPrbxf8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"CWCJjQv44ZDDBpyGB2wZ3uGnt-zoMTy2ajmE8S6T4z0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Z3Pa5E3px9g5tHPKd1kdMwxabfh6rZT80BZB5RIPwPs\"}"
