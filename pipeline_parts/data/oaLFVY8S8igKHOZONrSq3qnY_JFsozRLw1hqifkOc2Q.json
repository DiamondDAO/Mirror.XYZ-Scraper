But many people are vague and abstract about the concept of the Metaverse. So this article hopes to explain some successful metasverse projects and name their connections to the market.\\n\\nThis article focuses on two Metaverse projects: Sandbox and Decentraland.\\n\\n**The Sandbox**\\n\\nSandbox has been around since 2012 and has been named one of Apple's most popular games. In 2012, they accumulated a large number of game users. Meanwhile, it launched its own version of blockchain in 2018. This traditional Metaverse game, combining a mature sandbox shell with the rapid development of blockchain technology, has no doubt been successful in breaking out of the Metaverse when it became popular.\\n\\nOne of Sandbox's most famous mechanisms is land auctions. By combining it with blockchain, Sandbox was able to NFT and auction the land in the game. Therefore, you can purchase the land in the game by buying the governance currency, SAND.\\n\\nIn 2019, Sandbox conducted its first land auction. More than three hours later, only three plots had been sold. Now, in less than a minute, more than 400 plots have been sold out. At the same time, many well-known blockchain brands, such as Binance, Dogecoin, Alpaca, as well as many well-known project parties or institutions, will purchase a large amount of land in Sandbox in order to participate in the future Metaverse market.\\n\\nThe value of buying Sandbox land can be seen in many ways: basically everything you can do in real life can be done here. For example, some people will host parties and concerts on land, or develop indie games for others to play. You can also do many, many things, such as recreating movie scenes and teaching classes in them. All these things give land a commercial value and thus a source of rising prices.\\n\\nSandbox also gives users more freedom. First, users can use audio on the land, see video and images, and improve entertainment. At the same time, users are free to build the model of the house, give play to their own creativity, depending on their preferences to build.\\n\\nWith Workedit and Gamemaker, users create models without any coding ability. Like heads, houses, cars, and stages. You can even put your model on the marketplace. Other players can also purchase the model at will. While all of this is spontaneous, it can't have been done without a huge amount of infrastructure  from the project side.\\n\\n**The Decentraland**\\n\\nDecentraland was originally developed in 2015 and its core gameplay is not very different from sandbox, it is a sandbox where users can buy and sell land, provide a variety of gameplay, and have a variety of NFT transactions.\\n\\nThere are two main differences between Decentraland and Sandbox.\\n\\nFirst, although Decentraland also allows users to create models themselves, the process of creating models requires programming knowledge. Barriers prevent too many users from participating, but also encourage a small number of users to monetize programming items.\\n\\nSecondly, Decentraland allows users to purchase NFT items they see during map shopping. For example, when visiting a museum, they can buy a nice painting on the scene, rather than Sandbox, where they can only purchase it in the mall. Therefore, Decentraland has a much better user experience than buying it in the mall.\\n\\nIn addition, a comparison of maps produced by Sandbox and Decentraland clearly shows that Decentraland's map presentation is not as attractive as the Sandbox's.\\n\\nThis is the Sandbox map. It puts the owner of the land in a very visible place, which is a great way to satisfy the user's desire to show off and encourage them to pay for it. \\n\\nDecentraland's maps are difficult to sell because the land that users bought are not that clear and identifiable enough.\\n\\nThese two projects belong to the same type, both of which have existed for a long time, Sandbox + NFT class, but more in line with the spirit of the Metaverse: I created a new world, you have created their own in this world, it and centralized Sandbox games the biggest difference is that users have more self-help rights, for example, mall props model is not square design  project, but the user's own design, and through the community governance, the user can decide this project all rights and functions, which is difficult to achieve in a decentralized game.\\n\\nSo, we've sort of summed up the common denominator that makes the Metaverse work. So how does Metatube stand out as another meta-universe game in 2022?\\n\\n**Why is MetaTube so unique?**\\n\\nTHE METATUBE is a 3D and AR Metaverse game built on the zkTube Layer2 network for users to earn NFTs with the concept of Play to Earn and Move to Earn.\\n\\nTo understand Metatube, we need to understand the game's worldview. You can capture pets, make a few like-minded friends, and strangers to fight, as well as a group of magical operations. Metatube will also use realistic picture quality and decentralized governance to bring users the most real experience. Also, all sprites, items, and experience points are tradeable NFT, and you can trade them whenever you want on the Metatube market.\\n\\nAdditionally, The Metatube world will be divided into four parts. Universal, Cyber City, Forest, Woodland, and Desert. Each of these four sections has its own unique character and culture, and the experience of playing in different regions is fantastic and diverse.\\n\\nAs far as we know, games in the Metaverse usually have a grand setting and world view, and we can take the famous open world game: World of Warcraft for example.\\n\\nFirst, it will have open virtual worlds, such as the land of Azeroth in World of Warcraft, which could be called the \\\"pan-Metaverse.\\\" There will be different regions of the continent, and these regions will belong to different races, and players will experience very different things in different regions, and even different worlds.\\n\\nAt the same time, the diversity of races and classes in the open world adds variety and interest to the Metaverse. Taking World of Warcraft as an example, there are known races such as humans, orcs, elves, dwarves, etc. These races may determine the basic attributes of the player, such as endurance, intelligence, agility, and so on. Classes determine what skills the player is good at, such as melee fighters, magic wizards, and ranged archers.\\n\\nWe have to admit that it would be exciting to actually experience a game with such a grand worldview in 3D or AR. This good will have been a lot of people are expressed in the form of indirect: such as the \\\"number one player” directed by Steven Spielberg or \\\"out of control the player\\\" by Ryan Reynolds  the two movies are described a virtual world of the yuan to the universe, it has a lot of both players and NPCS should, and they all live in a wonderful and diverse in the virtual world. \\n\\nWith a grand world view, a good AR experience, and commercial empowerment, Metatube will definitely become the brightest new star in the Metaverse market.\\n\\n**MetaTube World Social Links:**\\n\\nWebsite: <http://meta.zktube.io/>\\n\\nTelegram: <https://t.me/MetaTubeWorld>\\n\\nDiscord: <https://discord.gg/YN43V2N5Rc>\\n\\nTwitter: <https://twitter.com/MetaTubeWorld>\\n\\nYouTube: <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuAmMsNzuJCS1yvHkOOWozQ> \\n \",\"timestamp\":1641466108,\"title\":\"The Outstanding Representatives of the Metaverse World & Why MetaTube is So Unique\"},\"digest\":\"7GYXzCp7R8UZ7yzNfjloPa2BaZ28Use-RHwKkMMVZqo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9ac7B56F9e681005D22516C04BE9D45e5d866A4F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"5IAoOMv1aGXMWfYRjLXYnCl1ShXCDdykChRslQx87ec\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"i64IUBQ2f9_2JHSUTqWQpAq_Yh48YZYSC3nzjMwjbWw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"qC2siVWUUD1sHAp89GlbdhjdAP6XvKs3H_4AhhP2Km6pW7cMGOGYcKcp8e0ia-71REX7gOwkz8Eu0SP8V-RmOQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa02b418dc5a523fbe4e6b47f1b46288f2bd0a554736dafdceb616f277e7cd451643b9e6c6191d0c59180a1a211e45dd7121414b1f882feb9aac5e9982d50789b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"5IAoOMv1aGXMWfYRjLXYnCl1ShXCDdykChRslQx87ec\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"i64IUBQ2f9_2JHSUTqWQpAq_Yh48YZYSC3nzjMwjbWw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"7GYXzCp7R8UZ7yzNfjloPa2BaZ28Use-RHwKkMMVZqo\"}"
