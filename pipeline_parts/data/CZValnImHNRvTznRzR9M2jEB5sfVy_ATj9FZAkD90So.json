"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"When Kenmuir Queen, the prize short-horn heifer, calved unexpectedly and unattended in the dip by the lane, Tammas and the Master, summoned hurriedly by Owd Bob, came running up to find the little man leaning against the stile, and shaking with silent merriment. Again, poor old Staggy, daring still in his dotage, took a fall while scrambling on the steep banks of the Stony Bottom. There he lay for hours, unnoticed and kicking, until James Moore and Owd Bob came upon him at length, nearly exhausted. But M'Adam was before them. Standing on the far bank with Red Wull by his side, he called across the gulf with apparent concern: \\\"He's bin so sin' yesternight.\\\" Often James Moore, with all his great strength of character, could barely control himself.\\n\\nThere were two attempts to patch up the feud. Jim Mason, who went about the world seeking to do good, tried in his shy way to set things right. But M'Adam and his Red Wull between them soon shut him and Betsy up.\\n\\n\\\"You mind yer letters and yer wires, Mr. Poacher-Postman. Ay, I saw 'em baith: th' am doon by the Haughs, t'ither in the Bottom. And there's Wullie, the humorsome chiel, havin' a rare game wi' Betsy.\\\" There, indeed, lay the faithful Betsy, suppliant on her back, paws up, throat exposed, while Red Wull, now a great-grown puppy, stood over her, his habitually evil expression intensified into a fiendish grin, as with wrinkled muzzle and savage wheeze he waited for a movement as a pretext to pin: \\\"Wullie, let the leddy be--ye've had yer dinner.\\\"\\n\\nParson Leggy was the other would-be mediator; for he hated to see the two principal parishioners of his tiny cure at enmity. First he tackled James Moore on the subject; but that laconic person cut him short with, \\\"I've nowt agin the little mon,\\\" and would say no more. And, indeed, the quarrel was none of his making.\\n\\nOf the parson's interview with M'Adam, it is .enough to say here that, in the end, the angry old minister would of a surety have assaulted his mocking adversary had not Cyril Gilbraith forcibly withheld him.\\n\\nAnd after that the vendetta must take its course unchecked.\\n\\nDavid was now the only link between the two farms. Despite his father's angry commands, the boy clung to his intimacy with the Moores with a doggedness that no thrashing could overcome. Not a minute of the day when out of school, holidays and Sundays included, but was passed at Kenmuir. it was not till late at night that he would sneak back to the Grange, and creep quietly up to his tiny bare room in the roof--not supperless, indeed, motherly Mrs. Moore had seen to that. And there he would lie awake and listen with a fierce contempt as his father, hours later, lurched into the kitchen below, lilting liquorishly:\\n\\n\\\"We are na Lou, we're nae that Lou, But just a drappie in our e'e; The cock may craw, the day may daw', And ay we'll taste the barley bree!\\\"\\n\\nAnd in the morning the boy would slip quietly out of the house while his father still slept; only Red Wull would thrust out his savage head as the lad passed, and snarl hungrily.\\n\\nSometimes father and son would go thus for weeks without sight of one another. And that was David's aim--to escape attention. It was only his cunning at this game of evasion that saved him a thrashing.\\n\\nThe little man seemed devoid of all natural affection for his son. He lavished the whole fondness of which his small nature appeared capable on the Tailless Tyke, for so the Dales-men called Red Wull. And the dog he treated with a careful tenderness that made David smile bitterly.\\n\\nThe little man and his dog were as alike morally as physically they were contrasted. Each owed a grudge against the world and was determined to pay it. Each was an Ishmael among his kind.\\n\\nYou saw them thus, standing apart, leper-like, in the turmoil of life; and it came quite as a revelation to happen upon them in some quiet spot of nights, playing together, each wrapped in the game, innocent, tender, forgetful of the hostile world.\\n\\nThe two were never separated except only when M'Adam came home by the path across Kenmuir. After that first misadventure he never allowed his friend to accompany him on the journey through the enemy's country; for well he knew that sheep-dogs have long memories.\\n\\nTo the stile in the lane, then, Red Wull would follow him. There he would stand, his great head poked through the bars, watching his master out of sight; and then would turn and trot, self-reliant and defiant, sturdy and surly, down the very centre of the road through the village--no playing, no enticing away, and woe to that man or dog who tried to stay him in his course! And so on, past Mother Ross's shop, past the Sylvester Arms, to the right by Kirby's smithy, over the Wastrel by the Haughs, to await his master at the edge of the Stony Bottom.\\n\\nThe little man, when thus crossing Ken-muir, often met Owd Bob, who had the free run of the farm. On these occasions he passed discreetly by; for, though he was no coward, yet it is bad, single-handed, to attack a Gray Dog of Kenmuir; while the dog trotted soberly on his way, only a steely glint in the big gray eyes betraying his knowledge of the presence of his foe. As surely, however, as the little man, in his desire to spy out the nakedness of the land, strayed off the public path, so surely a gray figure, seeming to spring from out the blue, would come fiercely, silently driving down on him; and he would turn and run for his life, amid the uproarious jeers of any of the farm-hands who were witness to the encounter.\\n\\nOn these occasions David vied with Tammas in facetiousness at his father's expense.\\n\\n\\\"Good on yo', little un!\\\" he roared from behind a wall, on one such occurence.\\n\\n\\\"Bain't he a runner, neither?\\\" yelled Tammas, not to be outdone. \\\"See un skip it--ho! ho!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Look to his knees a-wamblin'!\\\" from the Jon, I'd wear petticoats.\\\" As he spoke, a swinging box on the ear nearly knocked the young reprobate down.\\n\\n\\\"D'yo' think God gave you a dad for you to jeer at? Y'ought to be ashamed o' yo'self. Serve yo' right if he does thrash yo' when yo' get home.\\\" And David, turning round, found James Moore close behind him, his heavy eyebrows lowering over his eyes.\\n\\nLuckily, M'Adam had not distinguished his ?Ofl's voice among the others. But David Iearcd he had; for on the following morning the little man said to him:\\n\\n\\\"David, ye'll come hame immediately after school to-day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Will I?\\\" said David pertly.\\n\\n''Ye will.\\n\\n\\\"Why?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because I tell ye to, ma lad\\\"; and that was all the reason he would give. Had  he told the simple fact that he wanted help to drench a \\\"husking\\\" ewe, things might have gone differently. As it was, David turned away defiantly down the hill.\\n\\nThe afternoon wore on. Schooltime was long over; still there was no David.\\n\\nThe little man waited at the door of the Grange, fuming, hopping from one leg to the other, talking to Red Wull, who lay at his feet, his head on his paws, like a tiger waiting for his prey.\\n\\nAt length he could restrain himself no longer; and started running down the bill, his heart burning with indignation.\\n\\n\\\"Wait till we lay hands on ye, ma lad,\\\" he muttered as he ran. \\\"We'll warm ye, we'll teach ye.\\\"\\n\\nAt the edge of the Stony Bottom he, as always, left Red Wull. Crossing it himself, and rounding Langholm How, he espied James Moore, David, and Owd Bob walking away from him and in the direction of Kenmuir. The gray dog and David were playing together. wrestling, racing, and rolling. The boy had never a thought for his father.\\n\\nThe little man ran up behind them, unseen and unheard, his feet softly pattering on the grass. His hand had fallen on David's shoulder before the boy had guessed his approach.\\n\\n\\\"Did I bid ye come hame after school, David?\\\" he asked, concealing his heat beneath a suspicious suavity.\\n\\n\\\"Maybe. Did I say I would come?\\\"\\n\\nThe pertness of tone and words, alike, fanned his father's resentment into a blaze. In a burst of passion he lunged forward at the boy with his stick. But as he smote, a gray whirlwind struck him fair on the chest, and he fell like a snapped stake, and lay, half stunned, with a dark muzzle an inch from his throat.\\n\\n\\\"Git back, Bob!\\\" shouted James Moore, hurrying up. \\\"Git back, I tell yo'!\\\" He bent over the prostrate figure, propping it up anxiously. \\\"Are yo' hurt, M'Adam? Eh,\\n\\nA stranger might well have mistaken the identity of the boy's father. For he stood now, holding the Master's arm; while a few paces above them was the little man, pale but determined, the expression on his face betraying his consciousness of the irony of the situation.\\n\\n\\\"Will ye come hame wi' me and have it noo, or stop wi' him and wait till ye get it?\\\" he asked the boy.\\n\\n\\\"M'Adam, I'd like yo' to--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"None o' that, James Moore.--David, what d'ye say?\\\"\\n\\nDavid looked up into his protector's face. \\\"Yo'd best go wi' your feyther, lad,\\\" said the Master at last, thickly. The boy hesitated, and clung tighter to the shielding arm; then he walked slowly over to his father.\\n\\nA bitter smile spread over the little man's face as he marked this new test ci? the boy's obedience to the other.\\n\\n\\\"To obey his frien' he foregoes the pleasure o' disobeyin' his father,\\\" he muttered. \\\"Noble!\\\" Then he turned homeward, and the boy followed in his footsteps.\\n\\nJames Moore and the gray dog stood looking after them.\\n\\n\\\"I know yo'll not pay off yer spite agin me on the lad's head, M'Adam,\\\" he called, almost appealingly.\\n\\n\\\"I'll do ma duty, thank ye, James Moore, wi'oot respect o' persons,\\\" the little man cried back, never turning.\\n\\nFather and son walked away, one behind the other, like a man and his dog, and there was no word said between them. Across the Stony Bottom, Red Wull, scowling with bared teeth at David, joined them. Together the three went up the bill to the Grange.\\n\\nIn the kitchen M'Adam turned.\\n\\n\\\"Noo, I'm gaein' to gie ye the gran'est thrashin' ye iver dreamed of. Tak' aff yer coat!\\\"\\n\\nThe boy obeyed, and stood up in his thin shirt, his face white and set as a statue's. Red Wull seated himself on his haunches close by, his ears pricked, licking his lips, all attention.\\n\\nThe little man suppled the great ash-plant in his hands and raised it. But the expression on the boy's face arrested his arm.\\n\\n\\\"Say ye're sorry and I'll let yer a.ff easy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll not.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"One mair chance--yer last! Say yer 'shamed o' yerself'!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm not.\\\"\\n\\nThe little man brandished his cruel, white weapon, and Red Wull shifted a little to obtain a better view.\\n\\n\\\"Git on wi' it,\\\" ordered David angrily.\\n\\nThe little man raised the stick again and-- threw it into the farthest corner of the room.\\n\\nIt fell with a rattle on the floor, and M'Adam turned away.\\n\\n\\\"Ye're the pitifulest son iver a man had,\\\" he cried brokenly. \\\"Gin a man's son dinna haud to him, wha can he expect to?--no one. Ye're ondootiful, ye're disrespectfu', ye're maist ilka thing ye shouldna be; there's but ae thing I thocht ye were not--a coward. And as to that, ye've no the pluck to sa)ye're sorry when, God knows, ye might be. I canna thrash ye this day. But ye shall gae nae mair to school. I send ye there to learn. Ye'll not learn--ye've learnt naethin' except disobedience to me-ye shall stop at hame and work.\\\"\\n\\nHis father's rare emotion, his broken voice and working face, moved David as all the stripes and jeers had failed to do. His conscience smote him. For the first time in his life it dimly dawned on him that, perhaps, his father, too, had some ground for complaint; that, perhaps, he was not a good son.\\n\\nHe half turned.\\n\\n\\\"Feyther--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Git oot o' ma sight!\\\" M'Adam cried.\\n\\nAnd the boy turned and went.\\n\\nChapter VI. A LICKING OR A LIE\\n\\nTHENCEFORWARD David buckled down to work at home, and in one point only father and son resembled--industry. A drunkard M'Adam was, but a drone, no.\\n\\nThe boy worked at the Grange with tireless, indomitable energy; yet he could never satisfy his father.\\n\\nThe little man would stand, a sneer on his face and his thin lips contemptuously curled, and flout the lad's brave labors.\\n\\nIs he no a gran' worker, Wullie? 'Tis a pleasure to watch him, his hands in his pockets, his eyes turned heavenward!\\\" as the boy snatched a hard-earned moment's rest. \\\"You and I, Wullie, we'll brak' oorsel's slavin' for him while he looks on and laffs.\\\"\\n\\nAnd so on, the whole day through, week in, week out; till he sickened with weariness of it all.\\n\\nIn his darkest hours David thought sometimes to run away. He was miserably alone on the cold bosom of the world. The very fact that he was the son of his father isolated him in the Daleland. Naturally of a reserved disposition, he had no single friend outside Kenmuir. And it was only the thought of his friends there that witheld him. He could not bring himself to part from them; they were all he had in the world.\\n\\nSo he worked on at the Grange, miserably, doggedly, taking blows and abuse alike in burning silence. But every evening, when work was ended, he stepped off to his other home beyond the Stony Bottom. And on Sundays and holidays--for of these latter he took, unasking, what he knew to be his due-- all day long, from cock-crowing to the going down of the sun, he would pass at Kenmuir. In this one matter the hoy was invincibly stubborn. Nothing his father could say or do sufficed to break him of the habit. He endured everything with white-lipped, silent dogged-ness, and still held on his way.\\n\\nOnce past the Stony Bottom, he threw his troubles behind him with a courage that did him honor. Of all the people at Kenmuir two only ever dreamed the whole depth of his unhappiness, and that not through David. James Moore suspected something of it all, for he knew more of M'Adam than did the others. While Owd Bob knew it as did no one else. He could tell it from the touch of the boy's hand on his head; and the story was writ large upon his face for a dog to read. And he would follow the lad about with a compassion in his sad gray eyes greater than words.\\n\\nDavid might well compare his gray friend at Kenmuir with that other at the Grange.\\n\\nThe Tailless Tyke had now grown into an immense dog, heavy of muscle and huge of bone. A great bull head; undershot jaw, square and lengthy and terrible; vicious, yellow-gleaming eyes; cropped ears; and an expression incomparably savage. His coat was a tawny, lion-like yellow, short, harsh, dense; and his back, running up from shoulder to loins, ended abruptly in the knob-like tail. He looked like the devil of a dogs' hell. And his reputation was as bad as his looks. He never attacked unprovoked; but a challenge was never ignored, and he was greedy of insults. Already he had nigh killed Rob Saunderson's collie, Shep; Jem Burton's Monkey fled incontinently at the sound of his approach; while he had even fought a round with that redoubtable trio, the Vexer, Venus, and Van Tromp.\\n\\nNor, in the matter of war, did he confine himself to his own kind. His huge strength and indomitable courage made him the match of almost anything that moved. Long Kirby once threatened him with a broomstick; the smith never did it again. While in the Border Ram he attacked Big Bell, the Squire's underkeeper, with such murderous fury that it took all the men in the room to pull han off.\\n\\nMore than once had he and Owd Bob essayed to wipe out mutual memories, Red Wull, in this case only, the aggressor. As yet, however, while they fenced a moment for that deadly throat-grip, the value of which each knew so well, James Moore had always seized the chance to intervene.\\n\\n\\\"That's right, hide him ahint yer petticoats,\\\" sneered M'Adam on one of these occasions.\\n\\n\\\"Hide? It'll not be him I'll hide, I warn you, M'Adam,\\\" the Master answered grimly, as he stood, twirling his good oak stick between the would-be duellists. Whereat there was a loud laugh at the little man's expense.\\n\\nIt seemed as if there were to be other points of rivalry between the two than memories. For, in the matter of his own business--the handling of sheep--Red Wull bid fair to be second only throughout the Daleland to the Gray Dog of Kenmuir. And M'Adam was patient and painstaking in the training of his Wullie in a manner to astonish David. It would have been touching, had it not been so unnatural in view of his treatment of his own blood, to watch the tender carefulness with which the little man moulded the dog beneath his hands. After a promising display he would stand, rubbing his palms together, as near content as ever he was.\\n\\n\\\"Weel done, Wullie! Weel done. Bide a wee and we'll show 'em a thing or two, you and I, Wullie.\\n\\n\\\"'The wand's wrack we share o't, The warstie and the care o't.'\\n\\nFor it's you and I alane, lad.\\\"  And the dog would trot up to him, place his great forepaws on his shoulders, and stand thus with his great head overtopping his master's, his ears back, and stump tail vibrating.\\n\\nYou saw them at their best when thus together, displaying each his one soft side to the other.\\n\\nFrom the very first David and Red Wull were open enemies: under the circumstances, indeed, nothing else was possible. Sometimes the great dog would follow on the lad's heels with surly, greedy eyes, never leaving him from sunrise to sundown, till David could hardly hold his hands.\\n\\nSo matters went on for a never-ending year. Then there came a climax.\\n\\nOne evening, on a day throughout which Red Wull had dogged him thus hungrily, David, his work finished, went to pick up his coat, which he had left hard by. On it lay Red Wull.\\n\\n\\\"Git off ma coat!\\\" the boy ordered angrily. marching up. But the great dog never stirred: he lifted a lip to show a fence of white,  even teeth, and seemed to sink lower in the ground; his head on  his paws, his eyes in his forehead.\\n\\n\\\"Come and take it!\\\" he seemed to say.\\n\\nNow what, between master and dog, David had endured almost more than he could bear that day.\\n\\n\\\"Yo' won't, won't yo', girt brute!\\\" he shouted, and bending, snatched a corner of the coat and attempted to jerk it away. At that, Red Wull rose, shivering, to his feet, and with a low gurgle sprang at the boy.\\n\\nDavid, quick as a flash, dodged, bent, and picked up an ugly stake, lying at his feet. Swinging round, all in a moment, he dealt his antagonist a mighty buffet on the side of the head. Dazed with the blow, the great dog fell; then, recovering himself, with a terrible, deep roar he sprang again. Then it must have gone hard with the boy, fine-grown, muscular young giant though he was. For Red Wull was now in the first bloom of that great strength which earned him afterward an undying notoriety in the land.\\n\\nAs it chanced, however, M'Adam had watched the scene from the kitchen. And now he came hurrying out of the house, shrieking commands and curses at the combatants. As Red Wull sprang, he interposed between the two, head back and eyes flashing. His small person received the full shock of the charge. He staggered, but recovered, and in an imperative voice ordered the dog to heel.\\n\\nThen he turned on David, seized the stake from his hand, and began furiously belaboring the boy.\\n\\n\\\"I'll teach ye to strike--a puir--dumb--harrnless--creetur, ye--cruel-- cruel---lad!\\\" he cried. \\\"Hoo daur ye strike--ma----Wullie? yer-- father's----Wullie? Adam--M 'Adam's--Red Wull?\\\" He was panting from his exertions, and his eyes were blazing. \\\"I pit up as best I can wi' all manner o' disrespect to masel'; but when it comes to takin' ma puir Wullie, I cantia thole it. Ha' ye no heart?\\\" he asked, unconscious of the irony of the question.\\n\\n\\\"As much as some, I reck'n,\\\" David muttered.\\n\\n\\\"Eh, what's that? What d'ye say?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ye may thrash me till ye're blind; and it's nob'but yer duty; but if only one daurs so much as to look at yer Wullie ye're mad,\\\" the boy answered bitterly. And with that he turned away defiantly and openly in the direction of Kenmuir.\\n\\nM'Adam made a step forward, and then stopped.\\n\\n\\\"I'll see ye agin, ma lad, this evenin','' he cried with cruel significance.\\n\\n\\\"I doot but yo'il be too drunk to see owt-- except, 'appen, your bottle,\\\" the boy shouted back; and swaggered down the hill.\\n\\nAt Kenmuir that night the marked and particular kindness of Elizabeth Moore was too much for the overstrung lad. Overcome by the contrast of her sweet motherliness, he burst into a storm of invective against his father, his home, his life--everything.\\n\\n\\\"Don't 'ee, Davie, don't 'ee, deane!\\\" cried Mrs. Moore, much distressed. And taking him to her she talked to the great, sobbing boy as though he were a child. At length he lifted his face and looked up; and, seeing the white, wan countenance of his dear comforter, was struck with tender remorse that he had given way and pained her, who looked so frail and thin herself.\\n\\nHe mastered himself with an effort; and, for the rest of the evening, was his usual cheery self. He teased Maggie into tears; chaffed stolid little Andrew; and bantered Sam'l Todd until that generally impassive man threatened to bash his snout for him.\\n\\nYet it was with a great swallowing at his throat that, later, he turned down the slope for home.\\n\\nJames Moore and Parson Leggy accompanied him to the bridge over the Wastrel, and stood a while watching as he disappeared into the summer night.\\n\\n\\\"Yon's a good lad,\\\" said the Master half to himself.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" the parson replied ; \\\"I always thought there was good in the boy, if only his father'd give him a chance. And look at the way Owd Bob there follows him. There's not another soul outside Kenmuir he'd do that for.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ay, sir,\\\" said the Master. \\\"Bob knows a mon when he sees one.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He does,\\\" acquiesced the other. \\\"And by the by, James, the talk in the village is that you've settled not to run him for the Cup. Is, that so?\\\"\\n\\nThe Master nodded.\\n\\n\\\"It is, sir. They're all mad I should, but I mun cross 'em. They say he's reached his prime--and so he has o' his body, but not o' his brain. And a sheep-dog--unlike other dogs--is not at his best till his brain is at its best--and that takes a while developin', same as in a mon, I reck'n.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, well,\\\" said the parson, pulling out a favorite phrase, \\\"waiting's winning--waiting's winning.\\\"\\n\\nDavid slipped up into his room and into bed unseen, he hoped. Alone with the darkness, he allowed himself the rare relief of tears; and at length fell asleep. He awoke to find his father standing at his bedside. The little man held a feeble dip-candle in his hand, which lit his sallow face in crude black and white. In the doorway, dimly outlined, was the great figure of Red Wull.\\n\\n\\\"Whaur ha' ye been the day?\\\" the little man asked. Then, looking down on the white stained face beneath him, he added hurriedly: \\\"If ye like to lie, I'll believe ye.\\\"\\n\\nDavid was out of bed and standing up in his night-shirt. He looked at his father contemptuously.\\n\\n\\\"I ha' bin at Kenmuir. I'll not lie for yo' ur your likes,\\\" he said proudly.\\n\\nThe little man shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n\\\" 'Tell a lee and stick to it,'is my rule, and. a good one, too, in honest England. I for one 'II no think ony the worse o' ye if yer memory plays yer false.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"D'yo' think I care a kick what yo' think o' me?\\\" the boy asked brutally. \\\"Nay; there's 'nough liars in this fam'ly wi'oot me.\\\"\\n\\nThe candle trembled and was still again.\\n\\n\\\"A lickin' or a lie--tak' yer choice!\\\"\\n\\nThe boy looked scornfully down on his father. Standing on his naked feet, he already towered half a head above the other and was twice the man.\\n\\n\\\"D'yo' think I'm fear'd o' a thrashin' fra yo'? Goo' gracious me!\\\" he sneered. \\\"Why, I'd as lief let owd Grammer Maddox lick me, for all I care.\\\"\\n\\nA reference to his physical insufficiencies fired the little man as surely as a lighted match powder.\\n\\n\\\"Ye maun be cauld, standin' there so. Rin ye doon and fetch oor little frien' \\\"--a reference to a certain strap hanging in the kitchen. \\\"I'll see if I can warm ye.\\\"\\n\\nDavid turned and stumbled down the unlit, narrow stairs. The hard, cold boards struck like death against his naked feet. At his heels followed Red Wull, his hot breath fanning the boy's bare legs.\\n\\nSo into the kitchen and back up the stairs, and Red Wull always following.\\n\\n\\\"I'll no despair yet o' teachin' ye the fifth commandment, though I kill masel' in doin' it!\\\" cried the little man, seizing the strap from the boy's numb grasp.\\n\\nWhen it was over, M'Adam turned, breathless, away. At the threshold of the room he stopped and looked round: a little, dim-lit, devilish figure, framed in the door; while from the blackness behind, Red Wull's eyes gleamed yellow.\\n\\nGlancing back, the little man caught such an expression on David's face that for once he was fairly afraid. He banged the door and hobbled actively down the stairs.\\n\\nChapter VII. THE WHITE WINTER\\n\\nM'ADAM--in his sober moments at least-- never touched David again; instead, he devoted himself to the more congenial exercise of the whiplash of his tongue. And he was wise; for David, who was already nigh a head the taller of the two, and comely and strong in proportion, could, if he would, have taken his father in the hollow of his hand and crumpled him like a dry leaf. Moreover, with his tongue, at least, the little man enjoyed the noble pleasure of making the boy wince. And so the war was carried on none the less vindictively.\\n\\nMeanwhile another summer was passing away, and every day brought fresh proofs of the prowess of Owd Bob. Tammas, whose stock of yarns anent Rex son of Rally had after forty years' hard wear begun to pall on the loyal ears of even old Jonas, found no lack of new material now. In the Dalesman's Daughter in Silverdale and in the Border Ram at Grammoch-town, each succeeding market day brought some fresh tale. Men told how the gray dog had outdone Gypsy Jack, the sheep-sneak; how he had cut out a Kenmuir shearling from the very centre of Londesley's pack; and a thousand like stories.\\n\\nThe Gray Dogs of Kenmuir have always been equally heroes and favorites in the Dale-land. And the confidence of the Dalesmen in Owd Bob was now invincible. Sometimes on market days he would execute some unaccotmtable maneuvre, and .. strange shepherd would ask: \\\"What's the gray dog at?\\\" To which the nearest Dalesman would reply: \\\"Nay, I canno tell ye! But he's reet enough. Yon's Owd Bob o' Kenmuir.\\\"\\n\\nWhereon the stranger would prick his ears and watch with close attention.\\n\\n\\\"Yon's Owd Bob o' Kenmuir, is he?\\\" he would say; for already among the faculty the name was becoming known. And never in such a case did the young dog fail to justify the faith of his supporters.\\n\\nIt came, therefore, as a keen disappointment to every Dalesman, from Herbert Trotter, Secretary of the Trials, to little Billy Thornton, when the Master persisted in his decision not to run the dog for the Cup in the approaching Dale Trials; and that though parson, squire, and even Lady Eleanour essayed to shake his purpose. It was nigh fifty years since Rex son o' Rally had won back the Trophy for the land that gave it birth; it was time, they thought, for a Daleland dog, a Gray Dog of Kenmuir--the terms are practically synonymous--to bring it home again. And Tarnmas, that polished phrase-maker, was only expressing the feelings of every Dalesman in the room when, one night at the Arms, he declared of Owd Bob that \\\"to ha' run was to ha' won.\\\" At which M'Adam sniggered audibly and winked at Red Wull. \\\"To ha' run was to ha' one--lickin'; to rin next year'll be to-- Win next year.\\\" Tammas interposed dogmatically. \\\"Onless \\\"--with shivering sarcasm\\n\\n\\\\--\\\"you and yer Wullie are thinkin' o' winnin'.\\\" The little man rose from his solitary seat at the back of the room and pattered across.\\n\\n\\\"Wullie and I are thinkin' o' t,\\\" he whispered loudly in the old man's ear. \\\"And mair:\",\"timestamp\":1641283189,\"title\":\"\\nHe haunted Kenmuir like its evil genius.
