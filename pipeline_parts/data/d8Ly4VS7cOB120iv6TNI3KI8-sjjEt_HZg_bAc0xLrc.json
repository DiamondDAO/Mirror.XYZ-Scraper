"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*From Building Permit, a short story collection*\\n\\nThis plague is a godsend for me. I’ll never say this openly because I’m not successful enough to professionally survive such a statement, but *unofficially*, it *is* a godsend for me — me, myself and I, and no one else to suck time and sanity out of me. *How in Covid-19 Lockdown Zelda Gravestone Reinvented The Great American Novel*, I can almost see the headline sprawled in unusually large font across two pages of *The New Yorker*.\\n\\nZelda is not my real name. It is my novelist pseudonym — an homage to Zelda Fitzgerald whom I’ve been obsessed with ever since I first read about her marriage to F. Scott, and a safety net too, just in case my writing career doesn’t work out and I need to start over. This is the first of two safety nets I have in place. The second one is moving from Sheridan, Wyoming, population of eighteen thousand, to San Francisco, where I have no family and no one knows me. Big cities are a good place to succeed and a great place to fail anonymously.\\n\\nI’m about a hundred pages deep into my first novel and although I’m not unhappy with my overall progress, the past couple of weeks have been a mess. The past couple of weeks have been day in and day out of waiting for words to explode onto the page in some sort of readable pattern. It’s not a writer’s block, I don’t think. I don’t even believe in writer’s blocks. I believe that if something needs to be said and you are the right person to say it, the words will pour out of you in tidy streams of glittering prose. My editor says that I’m self-sabotaging with this sort of thinking although apparently that’s not my main problem. According to her, my main problem is that I’m too good at decimating my own work. I need to be bolder, put myself out there, and not write like a little girl scared of her own shadow. These are the exact words she used by the way: *a little girl scared of her own shadow*. Of course, this metaphor is well pre-meditated. What my editor is really saying is that I’m scared of my own writerly existence, ergo I can’t develop a vision that is uniquely my own, ergo it’s questionable if I’ll ever be able to make any notable literary dent, or any sort of dent for that matter. *A little girl scared of her own shadow.* My editor knows many ways to kill a person.\\n\\nThe good news is that I have a strong opening sentence for my novel (I think!). It goes like this: *The most boring man on Earth lives in my apartment building*. Incidentally, this happens to be true. His name is Bruce, he owns a Maltese named Carla, and is my left-door neighbor. Bruce is tall and skinny, and entirely unremarkable. *Suspiciously* unremarkable, one might say. So much so that when I first moved in here last summer, I thought that it was all a front. I thought that he just *had* to live a secret second life somewhere in which he was a top spy with a flair for fast cars and red-haired women. *A Study of Studied Blandness,* that’s how I titled Bruce’s character exploration in my notes. In my mind, I was convinced that if only I made friends with him, he’d invite me over for a glass of fine Malbec from his family’s vineyard, would sink in his brown leather armchair, and proceed to give me detail after detail of his dangerous, sexy, yet lyrical secret life.\\n\\nNever happened of course; never managed to get past the dark blue door of apartment 2B. So naturally, I made an alternative plan. Over the following two months, I spent four to six hours a day with my left ear glued to the wall separating my apartment from his. Butt nested on top of the sofa, body contorted at an angle fit for a gymnast, mind frantic with expectation. Carla would start barking and Bruce would shush her in the British accent of his other life: “Quiet, darling, lest we should wake up the dead.” Or something dramatic like this. I had to stop eventually because my neck was hurting too much. Whatever I was doing to keep my head in this position, I had to stop because it was not healthy, that’s what the doctor said. I couldn’t help but roll my eyes a little when I heard this. Of course it was not healthy, obsession never is. The problem is that in my line of business, it works literary miracles.\\n\\nBut look!, while I’ve been sitting here and telling you all this, evening has snuck up on me again. Time to pour myself a glass of my favorite Syrah. I take a sip, but I don’t swallow. I keep the wine in my mouth until the flavor sinks into every cell. I pull my dress up and slide my hands between my thighs. I lean forward, wrap my arms around my legs, and kiss my thighs. I lean back and stroke my thighs with my palms. My skin is smooth and shiny, and the bruises he left are almost gone. He’s back in the city next week, that’s what his email read. He sounded so regretful, so sincere, in so much pain. He wants to meet up, and I’m not sure what to do. Maybe I should give him a chance to explain in person one last time, for old times’ sake. I’m not sure, I haven’t made up my mind just yet. I wish things were more black and white, I would know what to do then. But I’m rambling again, I have to stop.\\n\\nI pull my dress down and wrap a scarf around my shoulders. I grab my purse and hurry down the stairs. SZA is moaning gently in my ears. God, I love this song.\\n\\n*Do you really wanna love me like you say you do?*\\n\\nI sway my head left\\n\\n*’Cause it’s hard enough you got to treat me like this*\\n\\nAnd right,\\n\\n*Lonely enough to let you treat me like this*\\n\\nAnd left again.\\n\\n*Do you really love me*\\n\\nI put my hand on my heart. It’s instinct.\",\"timestamp\":1636474069,\"title\":\"Instinct\"},\"digest\":\"giBgK9bvW7YJUNweBQi4HlKaqUxB-6BPcN89Me8MxEU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x60566cb8D8dfb84d0B25A7cd3daE7C1eaDfbDb5F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"EOoQN-1fhzyhWK9HQ-FKIbtq158ns9I7etMOCTQj53Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"d8xFD2uClamm1CYCaawrohwzb6XefS6bk0hCH0ZPVt4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"HHiUahjrVk5PlTrptnlcPhSudTn9jwwykAdpDMbQCYD5sKhjopDGwbljBTwmsjlAqLvo2sj071f_CLHQS-nkKA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd3708dbdc06d3814665229f45343f6584d29248f3f52e3be35995b6ed13934dd7ebc69f983aa989319448280a3006c81aa6a39904445edf39f31031afca9775e1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"EOoQN-1fhzyhWK9HQ-FKIbtq158ns9I7etMOCTQj53Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"d8xFD2uClamm1CYCaawrohwzb6XefS6bk0hCH0ZPVt4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"giBgK9bvW7YJUNweBQi4HlKaqUxB-6BPcN89Me8MxEU\"}"
