"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Cardano comes up with a solution, Hydra, which is the second layer on top of the Cardano layer, to enhance scalability. Furthermore, Aleksandra Huk, a Cardano fan, thinks that hydra will be capable of processing 2 million transactions per second.\\n\\nCardano is a blockchain platform that is designed to do more, faster. The ADA token has been steadily growing in value and now the network can handle 2 million transactions per second (TPS).\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Pa9bFjM1TIQrbAyrfIkHp.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\\n\\nThe cardano layer 2 projects is a project that has been in the works for a while. It will allow for scaling of the cardano network to 2 million transactions per second.\\n\\nThe second layer of Cardano is Hydra, whereas the first layer is based on PoS consensus. Hydra is set up in a manner that makes it easy to use with a stake pool approach. Smart contracts may also be implemented, enabling consumers to build dapps with micropayments, voting, and other features.\\n\\nAccording to Input Output Global, Cardano’s layer 2 scaling solution, Hydra, is in active development. IOG also sent out a tweet regarding Hydra’s phase development process.\\n\\nCardano’s initial layer relies on PoS consensus, but Hydra is pushing the limits of PoS scalability. Furthermore, according to Aleksandra Huk, hydra can push Cardano to the next level in terms of scalability.\\n\\nEach stake pool may produce a new Hydra’s head since Hydra fits nicely with the stake pool concept. Adding additional pools increases scalability since each Hydra head can process 1000 TPS. Cardano may potentially grow up to 1 million TPS with 1,000 pools, and transaction finality will be lightning fast.\\n\\nFinally, with 2,000 staking pools, Cardano could handle 2 million transactions per second (TPS). Hydra also supports horizontal scaling. It involves integrating additional nodes to improve performance.\",\"timestamp\":1638350405,\"title\":\"Hydra Layer Scales Cardano Up To 2 Million TPS\"},\"digest\":\"K4ECiiX5RlF-rXUpEDUBgtoVU_LFP2LOFRdkTQRyRAQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x85B5aa0d479cFcD9F8eBB0ccD5E72A6DbE312E4e\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ommsk4o1KvrKeh_8hhErS_BS9FVFQ0xkIvxmy2gQh6A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZCfNxbmdt6mjVPJu32i8kEg_vHLVCkO55QsPHAb7Ttw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"VwwH1TfrSuiwudo3VJC7EyIasbKMDAYTOSqAGKaUWeMYhUY4pKI4qv4Ti_tkuXPCBoqhFPh0PLYltO4ZUBlroA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9f21325fb3b8e2a341a19010abcb86475d12e433780765f19396a81c0b3b2684429c35993c85edc95bbd8a5a4138b9e7290cfe1639968c571bb12339ea41bae71c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ommsk4o1KvrKeh_8hhErS_BS9FVFQ0xkIvxmy2gQh6A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZCfNxbmdt6mjVPJu32i8kEg_vHLVCkO55QsPHAb7Ttw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"K4ECiiX5RlF-rXUpEDUBgtoVU_LFP2LOFRdkTQRyRAQ\"}"
