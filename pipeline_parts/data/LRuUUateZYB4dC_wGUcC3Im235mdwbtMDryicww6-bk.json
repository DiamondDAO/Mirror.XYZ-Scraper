"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"In ancient China, lay down the country and called to create a foundation. It is a successful business! Rebellion is actually starting a business.\\n\\n```\\nDuring the period of Emperor Shun of Liu Song, Jingzhou Shen Youzhi rebelled. His capital is not small. According to history books, he has a lot of horses and a lot of food. He has one hundred thousand elite soldiers and two thousand elite cavalry. His army arrived in Yingcheng, which was easy to defend and difficult to attack, and it was impossible to take it down within ten and a half months! His counselor told him that if he could not win successfully, the strength of the army would be lost. When the soldiers fail to act in the rebellion, the military will change. We might as well abandon the easy-to-defend and difficult-to-attack Yingcheng and directly attack the empty Nanjing, and lay down the roots of Liu Song, and Yingcheng voluntarily surrendered.\\n\\nShen Youzhi refused to listen, and attacked with his own elite soldiers, but he did not fight for a long time. Following the rebel soldiers, the first battle was so difficult to fight, and they all fled. Shen Youzhi saw that the major event had gone, and went to hang himself in the woods. The rebellion simply fails, and it can also be called an entrepreneurial failure.\\n              \\nWhen I was playing World of Warcraft 11 years ago, I established a guild and organized 40 people to fight a very difficult monster in the dungeon. As a result, the group continued to be destroyed, and then my guild broke up. Like Comrade Shen Youzhi, I also failed. Later, I ran into an expert in World of Warcraft. He said that all you want is activities. You don't need to organize them to fight difficult monsters. You can organize them to fight very simple monsters. Therefore, I organized a group of people to fight simple monsters. As a result, everyone's enthusiasm for fighting became high, the team gradually became emotional, and the sense of cooperation became stronger. Later, my guild naturally developed to be able to fight too difficult. It's weird.\\n            \\nWhat does this mean is that we are just starting our business, so we don’t want to find the hard ones, and don’t fight the ones that can’t be beaten. Go and play.\\n             \\nWhen you start a business, if you take a group of brothers for a long time, you don’t see the cash and the morale is low, the team will not be able to bring it, and the team will only break up. Therefore, at the beginning of the business, as long as there is cash in, no matter what the job is. , Do it first. In this way, team morale will become more and more prosperous. First, find a very simple profit point, so that everyone can quickly taste the sweetness. The confidence of the team can be built quickly. Everyone will think that there is a future with you.\\n```\",\"timestamp\":1634804300,\"title\":\"How they rebelled\"},\"digest\":\"sSkk9gfUYoOvI2a0Xf6xggeedbE_z3AraEGi_Pk3m9A\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0B27cE1053585ef548Cd78618Ee0b73D84246712\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FWHKuUadZNUD2AcIaH2jGL63PlPKxJxdB2P-UVSGKyo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TGI_NAnOwHtvZb-9m7wqNj24YxnrIjurKisiIm7dHV0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"plhyZ0WdNxXtKX9BV2DFrGvAInlSva3n1cxV5bG_SYQpT01NZQroJNRBKu9BPXZ2_j5DaIyiDsx7k8MKYNdQ7w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9d86f85b2660a8cb6873525924f9adb0c5f51dfb6229fed7a757ade2793c2f19347cb8076af39b12116743e30b34d1bacb42c80a0030cd272dd62c1ad0ad21081b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FWHKuUadZNUD2AcIaH2jGL63PlPKxJxdB2P-UVSGKyo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TGI_NAnOwHtvZb-9m7wqNj24YxnrIjurKisiIm7dHV0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"sSkk9gfUYoOvI2a0Xf6xggeedbE_z3AraEGi_Pk3m9A\"}"
