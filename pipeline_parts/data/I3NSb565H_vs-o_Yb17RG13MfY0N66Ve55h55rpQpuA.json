Something beautiful and cold. I had no category in my mind for this creature other than a human being. But as he approached, I began to understand that this man was not one of us, but another life form altogether.”*\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RJ0TLox4Oe7If3JLfqNZQ.png?height=100&width=1300)\\n\\nHumanity is facing the sixth extinction. Climate change is unyielding and most species are disappearing from the planet. As if answering a call, hidden creatures we thought only existed in tales are suddenly rising around the world. A secret organisation is monitoring them closely trying to uncover the truth behind their uprising.\\n\\nReports describe encounters with the creatures as life changing… Some subjects describe their terrifying encounter as a form of possession or haunting. But for others, trauma becomes a kind of enlightenment or revelation. We don’t know what causes such intense psychic changes, but it is clear that an encounter with these creatures has lasting effects, often causing a wide range of unexplained behaviors or abilities.\\n\\nTo help understand this phenomena, and to keep those who witnessed the creatures under surveillance, a secret organization was created – the [CRYPTO-Z AGENCY](https://discord.gg/X5ACCZTYBg).\\n\\nVictims of encounters are given a chance to start a new story about themselves, and their changed lives as *Crypto-Z Agents*.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p8XfyPUDSdfOvwsuCfDcf.png?height=800&width=1300&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=large)\\n\\nCrypto-Z started as a high-concept, cinematic adventure series created by [Hadrien Royo](https://twitter.com/hadrien_royo) and NYTimes Bestselling Novelist [Danielle Trussoni.](https://twitter.com/DaniTrussoni) The narrative world of Crypto-Z began as an audio drama podcast, with more than +350K downloads since last year of only 5 episodes published.

While still largely unproven, a greater body of\\nevidence seems to confirm the theory that cryptids might be able to “transmit” certain\\nabilities defying our current understanding of biology and evolution.\\n\\nWhile no one knows for sure where the creatures come from nor for what purpose they are suddenly appearing. But their uncanny resemblance to creatures of stories, legends and myths from all the world, makes some believe they have been with us all along, hidden, maybe in remote parts of the world.\\n\\nAnd because their origin is shrouded in mystery, people have started to call them:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z-WYMLsSgFCZPNMQxAh4r.png?height=100&width=1300)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pmsS4Pv4IbD_KIV553M95.png?height=113&width=1292&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=large)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VZk4yoh49Vd8Lu6Y8fV3j.png?height=200&width=1300&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\\n\\nCrypto-Z is **inspired by real creatures of legend and myth** found around the world.
