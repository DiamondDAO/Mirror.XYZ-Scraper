"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I was fascinated when I first came across the idea, [popularised by radreads](https://radreads.co/10k-work/), that no matter what your actual salary level, some of the actual work you do is worth something like $10/hour, but sometimes it’s worth a whole lot more.\\n\\nI've been thinking about this idea that we all do a mix of different types of work with markedly different values. $10/hr, $100/hr, $1000/hr and $10,000/hr. I realized a few things.\\n\\n## It’s not hard to figure out\\n\\nFirst, I was surprised but it’s relatively easy to know what price level a task is. Almost everything that I do professionally feels easily mappable to $10 or $100 or $1,000, at least loosely. Some tasks that perhaps take an hour might be separated into 15 mins of $1,000 and 45 mins of $10. Some examples:\\n\\n* **$10:** Arranging meetings, basic slack stuff, finding people on Linkedin, sending rote messages. Copying and pasting, refreshing marketing reports. Checking on task statuses.\\n* **$100:** most professional thinking/doing tasks. building reports, writing decent emails, feedback on docs, writing any kind of code or setting up reports. Most writing that I do.\\n* **$1,000:** This is harder and more rare so I have fewer examples. Discussing strategy with Taavi (my co-founder) and others. Pushing people in the team to stretch themselves. Coaching people in the team to get over hard things. Organizing big projects so they actually get done.\\n* **$10,000:** I'm not sure I've done this recently, but I think it might include, impressing our board, coming up with the metaphors, diagrams, etc. that make the complicated simple, obvious and appealing. Very strategic and hard choices within Salv. Probably firing someone (because the cost of not doing it is so enormous).\\n\\n## What it means\\n\\nAs expected, most of the work I do is at the lower price range. But it got me thinking that I have a duty to try to increase my average hourly rate. And thinking about what tasks that I was doing that were $10/hr tasks made it easier to imagine delegating it either to someone in our team or hiring a Personal Assistant (PA).\\n\\nBut if I could take away the vast majority of the work I do that's $10/hr with a PA, and delegate perhaps half of the work I do that's $100/hr to professionals in the team, I'd have perhaps 10-50x more time to spend on $1,000 and $10,000 than I do now. That’s an incredible opportunity. It's so easy to get bogged down in $10-$100 type work. There's an endless backlog of this type of work in any company.\\n\\nI was also thinking that I could incorporate it into my task system. I could try to *make the most* each day - i.e. 4h of $10, 2h of $100, 30 mins of $1,000, etc. That'd give me a strong incentive to think super carefully about the tasks I take on. If I optimize my days around making the most in funny-money-impact-dollars, I’d maximise my impact at work.\\n\\n## Can it extend beyond the office?\\n\\nBecause of my ancient GTD-addition, my whole life is in my task system. So I was wondering what value I’d put on things that weren’t work. Like making a delicious meal, or going to the gym.\\n\\nWhat I realised is that some non-work activities are way super refreshing (like exercise, or writing, or playing with kids). Some just give mild satisfaction from accomplishing them (cutting the grass, washing the car). So even there, there’s multiple orders-of-magnitude difference in the same way. I should ask, **What would I pay** to have this experience? For instance:\\n\\n* **$10/hr** - kinda don't like it, but happy to get it done.\\n* **$100/hr** - satisfying. A good meal.\\n* **$1,000/hr** - absolutely thrilling. Incredible conversations or moments with kids or my wife.\\n* **$10,000/hr** - once in a lifetime experiences.\\n\\nTherefore, my goal outside work could be to *spend at the highest level possible*. If I do this, I maximise the happiness in my life.\\n\\nAnd not only that, it comes full circle because if I spend a lot (of this hypothetical fun-money), I’m far more energetic at my work. A great life helps me bring my A-game. Relaxing, sleeping and eating well, exercising, spending time with my kids, working with my hands all give me an awesome feeling. When I'm tired, miserable, or just have a boring weekend, I'm far more likely to want to work on $10/hr tasks than $1,000.\\n\\nI’d love to hear if this framework seems useful.
