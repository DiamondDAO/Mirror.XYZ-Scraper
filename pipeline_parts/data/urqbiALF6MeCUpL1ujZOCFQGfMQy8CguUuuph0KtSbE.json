"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"![The Blockchain Trilemma](https://miro.medium.com/max/680/1\\\\*Fbc94JXnsZReg1361Kdgvg.png)\\n\\nThe **Blockchain Trilemma** is a word coined by Vitalik Butlerin(The Mastermind behind Ethereum). It basically defines the three important elements which are difficult to implement all at once when working with blockchains. We have to always disregard one, for the other two. If we consider them as three vertices of a triangle, the edge represents the two features you have chosen.\\n\\nThe three fundamental elements being\\n\\n1. **Scalability** — It basically defines how well the blockchain system can operate when more people start using it. One good example of this is the sudden rise in popularity of Crypto Kitties(a game to breed and sell cats) which congested the ETH Network in December 2017, lowering the transaction speed on the network.\\n2. **Decentralization** — To achieve decentralization, you just have to make sure that a single party is not controlling the network. The \\\\*\\\\*PoW (Proof of Work) \\\\*\\\\*consensus algorithm is a good example for decentralization, wherein multiple nodes validate and approve a transaction.\\n3. **Security** — When using an application especially one dealing with transactions involving funds. You would want the network to defend itself from malicious attacks and be stable and bug-free. Moreover, the source remains open-source most of the time. So, anyone can read the code and find loopholes and exploit it.\\n\\nIn Short,\\n\\n> *Scalability <=> High Transaction Speed + Less Gas Fee*\\n>\\n> *Decentralization <=>No Central Authority + Equal Privileges*\\n>\\n> *Security <=> Hackproof + Bug-Free*\\n\\nNow recall the triangle example I gave at the beginning. Let’s just select an edge and analyze.\\n\\n1. **Decentralization & Security = Low Transaction Speed**\\n\\nThis is the current scenario of how Bitcoin and Ethereum networks work. The transaction speed is less than **10** **transactions per second** (TPS). Since the nodes are spread all over the world, it takes time for the validation and synchronization of nodes.\\n\\n2\\\\. **Scalability & Security = Centralized**\\n\\nTo make the network highly scalable, there needs to be a smaller number of nodes on the network and the larger part of the network might be owned by a single entity to validate and approve the transactions at a higher rate, making it a single point of control.\\n\\nYou can further use the **Blockchain Trilemma**, to analyze crypto projects and make an investment. Chains like Solana and BSC have low transaction fees and better speed but do always remember that the \\\\*\\\\*DECENTRALIZATION \\\\*\\\\*is the ethos of blockchain technology.\\n\\nThanks for Reading.\",\"timestamp\":1641145519,\"title\":\"A Dilemma about the Trilemma!\"},\"digest\":\"z9N1G3QzqEH-98mOm1-4Ai8duMNhXeJcpWy9wykeXH4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xc69Fca2365e36663a3DCE7e8f2a1eF6C31E45f07\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"KlV5wV4uzHBUpGZw9BS2PJnWnmhKr8_W7sd15JPgKNY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"lK4_Kjgq8zg1o_OXnfx0OrK1wuhoJquYN2kCFwG9kKM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"3OKT2GPSC-mw6uXA1NQkIO3K9qIao7EWymfujg0FzI6KkraJOGv0nBagem5lMKbWxrgzC07Fzp56Q0bwiiZMEg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x52bbbe736722aba300a71a5c55b6077a4055947af55b65b6e0b63279247e546b5539107d776d9299becaa271a10db095a1a74e35593328c923b87b60e0ad0a091b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"KlV5wV4uzHBUpGZw9BS2PJnWnmhKr8_W7sd15JPgKNY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"lK4_Kjgq8zg1o_OXnfx0OrK1wuhoJquYN2kCFwG9kKM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"z9N1G3QzqEH-98mOm1-4Ai8duMNhXeJcpWy9wykeXH4\"}"
