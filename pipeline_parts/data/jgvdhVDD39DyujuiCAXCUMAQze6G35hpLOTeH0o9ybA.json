Dropping the collection in Miami is particularly significant, as in 1951, Josephine Baker’s refusal to perform for a segregated crowd at the Copa City Club in Miami Beach led to integration sweeping across the US. \\n\\nThis NFT collection connects the important moments in Ms. Baker’s life: the Pantheon in Paris, French Consulate of Miami, the African Heritage Cultural Arts Center, and the world via web 3.0 and NFTs. Addonis and his community are grateful for the opportunity to honor the legend that is Josephine Baker.\\n\\n[Visit the collection on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/addonis) to view how Addonis brought these NFTs to life\\n\\n[https://opensea.io/collection/addonis](https://opensea.io/collection/addonis)\\n\\n### How to participate\\n\\nNFT sale will open to the public on December 2nd.\\n\\nTo buy the NFTs that are being sold at a fixed price, you will need to have Ethereum (ETH) in a crypto wallet that is compatible with OpenSea, we recommend MetaMask.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U8TSMN6eFA1RWyUCYfOvb.png?height=509&width=1218)\\n\\nTo place a bid on the NFTs that are being sold at auction, you will need to have USDC in your MetaMask.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XRd8k8hwstxgP1v5r4QCB.png?height=569&width=1607)\\n\\nETH and USDC can be easily purchased within the MetaMask browser extension or by using an external exchange.
