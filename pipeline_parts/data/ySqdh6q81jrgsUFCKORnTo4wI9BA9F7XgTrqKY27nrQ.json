"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"***At the end of the year, most of my friends are not very excited to talk about what they have achieved this year.***\\n\\n***Some have been hit by life's blows, others have put important life plans on hold.***\\n\\n***A young couple who had planned a honeymoon \\\"when the epidemic was over\\\" had delayed for two years before they could make up for their anticipated honeymoon.***\\n\\n***A friend, who will soon turn 50, has been running around and staying up late all year and was diagnosed with stomach cancer at a medical check-up this year.***\\n\\n***\\\"Life is so meaningless sometimes, you don't know if the next thing that falls on your head is a halo, or bird shit.\\\" says a friend who is ill.***\\n\\n***When I was young, I loved the bravado of \\\"my life is up to me\\\", but the older I get, the more I realise that there are many things that are out of my hands, and all I can do is to live my life within the limits of my abilities.***\\n\\n***The year 2022 is about to begin, and the 7 tips in \\\"Live your life with your heart today\\\" are for everyone who lives their life with heart.***\\n\\n**part 1**\\n\\nAn hour to make yourself at ease\\n\\nEvery day as an adult is a race against time.\\n\\nYou have to make sure the kids are in school at 8am, you have to be at your workstation at 9am, you have to finish your work at 12pm, and you have to have dinner ready at 18pm ......\\n\\nIf you don't know how to manage your time, you'll be stuck in a situation where you have to do a job that takes 30 minutes to complete in 10 minutes.\\nBy giving yourself a 'one-hour cushion', you can free yourself from the rush and anxiety.\\n\\nBy waking up an hour earlier than usual, you can spend your morning at a leisurely pace.\\n\\nYou can freshen up, enjoy your breakfast, and then slow down and take your time on your way to work.\\n\\nWith a cushion of time, there is room to live mindfully.\\n\\n\\\"If you want to have a little more fun and flexibility in your life, set your alarm clock one hour earlier.\\n\\nAn hour in the morning is as precious as gold.\\n\\n**part 2**\\n\\nThe gesture of cleanliness\\n\\nCleanliness is the foundation of all things.\\n\\nSimple clothes look like high class even on well-groomed people. Conversely, high-class clothes look nothing like high-class when worn by people with bad grooming.\\n\\nWhen one walks with one's head down, one becomes depressed.\\n\\nCleanliness is not only about keeping neat and tidy on the outside, but also about the attitude of life.\\n\\nTo maintain a clean posture means that even as you grow older and gain experience, you must not lose your originality. To be excited about new things, to dance around when you are happy and not to lose that genuine temperament.\\n\\nYou will simply apologise when you have done something wrong, admit defeat graciously when you have failed, never lie and always have a decent and affectionate heart.\\n\\nIt is on the premise and foundation of cleanliness that a life of freedom, good work and new ideas can be bred.\\n\\n**part 3**\\n\\n\\\"The scale of 'giving'\\n\\nLife is not determined by what you do, what you work at or what you make. The key is what you give to others.\\n\\nGiving is not about goods, it is about the wisdom to survive, the way to be comfortable, the knowledge of new things.\\n\\nWhen you are past middle age, life lessons and insights are not just hidden away in your own drawer, but shared out unstintingly and will benefit those around you.\\n\\nIf you just wait for the goodwill of others and only ask for it, you will get nothing. You have to give yourself first, before the return will come.\\nEveryone has something to pass on to others, find out what that is, strive to do it, show your pure and sincere heart and when you have done that, then pass it on to more people.\\n\\nMaybe you can make one person smile, then make more people feel joy because of you, and you will get more back.\\n\\n**part 4**\\n\\nTake a deep breath on gossip\\n\\n\\\"We are often confronted with negativity and criticism about our work.\\n\\nWe often face criticism and criticism for not doing a good job here and there, and have no place to vent our frustrations.\\n\\nTo put it another way, being criticised means that someone is paying attention to you, and this is an opportunity to start, not only in business but also in everyday life.\\n\\nIf you are also very concerned about slander or gossip, think of it this way.\\n\\nFirstly, people don't care about you as much as you think they do, they don't think about you 24/7. You think, \\\"Now, that person must be saying something bad about me\\\", but they have already forgotten about you.\\n\\nSecondly, negative voices are easy to hear, but positive comments are often subtle and not easily heard. If there are ten people who criticise and vilify your performance or style of acting, there will also be ten people who praise your work performance and admire you behind your back. It's just that they don't say it, or you don't realise it.\\n\\nIf thinking this way doesn't calm you down, take a deep breath.\\n\\nIf you take a deep breath, your mind will be incredibly calm and you will become calm.\\n\\nAs long as you take more deep breaths than you care about what other people see, you will be at ease for the rest of the day.\\n\\n**part 5**\\n\\nSubtraction in life\\n\\nYataro Matsuura says: \\\"Whether you have something or develop a hobby, you have to be in the same frame of mind as if you were in love. If you are attracted to someone new, break up with your current lover, and this sincere attitude can be applied to all the big and small things in life.\\\"\\n\\nRather than embarking on superficial relationships with multiple people, it is better to give your heart to one person. Such a mindset is the same for people, things and interests alike.\\n\\nGet into one new thing and get rid of one old thing in the house, so that you don't enter into an overcrowded life.\\n\\nBy not buying extra things if you don't have to, you save yourself a lot of time choosing and organising, for example, by not buying clothes that need to be dry-cleaned, you free up space for your clothes and save yourself from having to send them for dry-cleaning.\\n\\nAlways check your life and try to cut back, even if it means making more space in the house, it will make you feel better, better ventilated and lighter on your feet.\\n\\n**part 6**\\n\\nThe seeds of money\\n\\nSaving money is not the only way to treat money ideally. Many people cling to meaningless savings without changing their quality of life in the slightest, while those who can spend money will spend it on things that will make them richer, just like planting money seeds.\\n\\nSpending tens of thousands of dollars on a fancy watch, if only because of the caprice of a \\\"want\\\" or to compensate for a desire that cannot be satisfied, is like eating the seed of money, a pure act of consumption.\\n\\nIf you go on a trip, it may not leave a tangible memento, but if you gain experience and insight, it is an investment that nurtures the seeds of money.\\n\\nA small amount of money for lunch, if you just buy random noodles for your stomach, is just to satisfy your physical desires; if you buy food that will keep your body and mind healthy, it is an investment in your future.\\n\\nWhenever you use money, the savings in your bank book will definitely decrease, but if you have a sense of investment, you will take the money and exchange it for something more valuable than the money itself.\\n\\n**part 7**\\n\\nA complete break\\n\\nThere comes a time when difficulties are overcome and grief always goes away; the hard part is the process of dissipating those feelings of frustration, disappointment and sadness.\\n\\nWhen you are depressed, let yourself be depressed to the end, no need to force a smile, hide alone, isolated from the outside world, but also to create a \\\"refuge\\\" for yourself.\\n\\nWhen you're in pain, you don't have to gloss over it. If you are feeling sullen, give yourself a break and let out the pent up misery.\\n\\nJust like when you have a cold, it doesn't help to hold back your cough, so the flow of emotions cannot be stopped.\\n\\nA complete rest is a full emotional flow and total mental relaxation.\\n\\nWhen the emotions are fully released and you face the thing you were most afraid of facing, you will find yourself stronger.\\n\\nThe most essential element of life is \\\"yourself\\\", so putting yourself first and cherishing yourself is not being selfish, but for the sake of the meaning of life.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1641176902,\"title\":\"7 small changes that can turn your life around\"},\"digest\":\"AnzhlLZCX7LDWBwaC50FT_9vamcYK-VKLS1BwHQeMnU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8864486C1be43143B2Fb2992777bA0B85129f3e4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eh7A4AGSpjQWR61FMROKytkFHAKmcKQSic4ESTaIR1E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FZrTiXDyR4bRz3fSVzXrF_HY7n73eTUUXHbYwCqRjik\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"3uQcQJrXlHJBNqW1EhQOlzBk5GN0DyMUem6vtO10eVehmlK_oMA0SKpmdQdX9uw5a6FumOJgy46jKv2w2n39pw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x86c9dae009d08617bdac4bb03ba8f8898cffb0e47a359f0fcf7eb396a23a4d573d2e131913999f07befdba0ede14ce8c3f62b373541f2c7db388553b59b157141b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eh7A4AGSpjQWR61FMROKytkFHAKmcKQSic4ESTaIR1E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FZrTiXDyR4bRz3fSVzXrF_HY7n73eTUUXHbYwCqRjik\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"AnzhlLZCX7LDWBwaC50FT_9vamcYK-VKLS1BwHQeMnU\"}"
