"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Last week I previewed [my OKRs](https://mrsenorhill.blog/2021/12/27/its-never-too-late-to-start-again/) for 2022. That post was my public commitment to the goals I want to reach by the end of the year.\\n\\nThis post serves as the “why.” Today, I’ll share my thought process behind setting them. I’ll cover the “how” in a future post.\\n\\nI could have easily called them “New Years Resolutions.” Why did I choose to wrap them in business jargon? It’s only 20% because I’m an asshole.\\n\\nThe other 80% is probably because of two reasons:\\n\\n1.  Avoid the curse of resolutions (emotional)\\n2.  Learn from setting goals in the past (logical)\\n\\n**The Resolution Curse**\\n\\nIt’s easy to set goals. It’s as simple as writing them down and gloating. Using the end of the year to make promises is an ancient practice. Marking time this way makes sense, as ending the year is a reflective time and a chance to start anew.\\n\\nAnd while many people make resolutions, most people fail at keeping them ([one study showed around 80%](https://www.inc.com/marla-tabaka/why-set-yourself-up-for-failure-ditch-new-years-resolution-do-this-instead.html)).\\n\\nI don’t intend to start my 2022 with the baggage of such failure. New Year’s Resolutions are like the [Madden Curse](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/what-is-the-madden-curse/) of goal setting.\\n\\nBut that explanation isn’t satisfying. There’s a better one.\\n\\n**Learn from setting goals in the past**\\n\\nThere’s a difference between hopes and goals. And most resolutions are hopes. I’m world-class at *setting *goals in my personal life but routinely fail *to keep* the New Year’s Resolutions I set. \\n\\nAs recently as this past year, in fact:\\n\\n> Every year, I set measurable goals for myself that should guide my behaviors throughout the year. Tracking this year’s goals here for personal accountability:\\n>\\n> 1.) Bike 3,000 miles\\\\\\n> 2.) Read 50 books\\\\\\n> 3.) Drink 46,720oz water (128oz/day)\\\\\\n> 4.) Walk 876 miles (2.4/day)\\\\\\n> 5.) Save $50k\\n>\\n> — mrsenorhill.eth 🌱 (@mrsenorhill) [January 21, 2021](https://twitter.com/mrsenorhill/status/1352105219019169795?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\\n\\nI did not fail to write my goals down or make them measurable. They were [SMART](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals). But I *did* fail to reach them. All of them.\\n\\nBut something changed this year: I met a big goal. In September, I decided (at 280 pounds and completely out of shape) to sign-up for a [Sprint Triathlon](https://www.triathlete.com/events/what-you-need-to-know-about-every-triathlon-distance/). And much to my surprise, I followed through on my commitment.\\n\\nBefore that commitment, I couldn’t swim more than a 25-yard length in the pool without convincing myself I would die. And I couldn’t run a mile without resting. But I did it. In November, I finished the Swim, Bike, Run distances locally in my “Trial Triathlon” and am currently training for an actual race on April 30.\\n\\nAnd honestly? What I initially thought was impossible ended up being easier than I imagined, mostly because I made a hard commitment to break.\\n\\nI later arrived at [Tim Ferriss’ excellent DISS](https://tim.blog/2018/06/05/the-tim-ferriss-show-transcripts-the-art-and-science-of-learning-anything-faster/) framework, but my initial approach was more about the “what” than the “how”:\\n\\n1.  I decided I was going to do something (commit)\\n2.  As quickly as possible, I told as many people that care about me what I was doing (accountability)\\n3.  I selected the first trustworthy plan I found for a pre-determined period (I chose 12 weeks)\\n4.  I followed the schedule religiously to completion (stupidity)\\n\\nI found the above behaviors, and by removing all obstacles (freely borrowing from Tim’s POV here), I could do it.\\n\\nThe nuance between this goal setting and previous years was slight but powerful.\\n\\nFlushed with confidence, I wanted to extend into 2022, which led me to my day job.\\n\\n**Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**\\n\\nWe attribute [OKRs to Andy Grove](https://www.whatmatters.com/articles/the-origin-story#:\\\\~:text=Andy%20Grove%2C%20OKR%20inventor%2C%20explains.), the former CEO of Intel. Most companies have adopted them as ways to align work to outcomes. [Google famously put them into practice](https://www.whatmatters.com/resources/google-okr-playbook) to significant effect.\\n\\nMeasuring what’s important is key to any team’s success. I talk about OKRs all day at work. I must mention that acronym 100 times a day. Yet I never brought them to my personal life, where I hope I’ve convinced you my goal setting is shit.\\n\\nTL;DR: The “Objective” is the “What,” and the “Key Results” are the “Hows.” Objectives let you express aggressive yet realistic goals and intents. Objectives should be obvious to anyone why they’re important and when met. Key Results define measurable milestones that serve as stepping stones towards the objectives or proof an objective has been met.\\n\\nBy framing my “Resolutions” in OKRs, I am bringing more intention to my goal setting. Because of this, I’m more confident I will meet them. \\n\\nBut there’s one last power to them: they natively support longer-term thinking.\\n\\n**5 Year Plan**\\n\\nOn New Year’s Day, I ran across a Tweet from [@Suhail](https://twitter.com/Suhail) that referenced a [@brian_armstrong](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong) tweet from back in 2020.\\n\\nThat tweet led me to think about what I want to be in 5 years (I’ll be 41) and how my 2022 can lead to that.\\n\\nWhile the details are blurry, the outline is clear:\\n\\n*   I want to be healthier\\n*   I want to be wealthier\\n*   I want to be wiser\\n\\nIdeally, I don’t want to sleep less to do this ([hat tip Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking_up_early))\\n\\nAnd so, each of my 2022 objectives directly relates to those concepts by the end of 2026. I’m smart enough to know the specifics of the world might change, so I want to remain flexible. But ultimately, those north stars are evergreen. The key is aligning my current behavior to that future vision. \\n\\nAnd I resolve that my OKRs will help me get there.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1641361017,\"title\":\"Why I set personal OKRs this year\"},\"digest\":\"qNYRW8VlNEvMvISrYZKVkQbm4sfwmR6vMh1wANyi34s\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x34ce371934D701b69Cf83C03a3f1d2878a2BEf27\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"v6PRWiN0IGLJl4UN5_op1eZ8ltE35z2Yw4FEpToau2k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JR0SHwk4bAHlXEPC_symxo7B5cnUcYybIHPzXCRFy0c\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"KN-jKiBtCDq79ywiqoWsIAMSf1bJuVMt8oe6b37-LFra8fxO3GMOOcDDdhukoPVqzEN75Iv6tTwANlIi3cxBiA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0a5743fa7a22fa2c8070af567b332daab88ae338174894cab0d75faabfa543137a07343639a888b995f82941448340203d8e0043da0e037d4a1ff617a9ff779c1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"v6PRWiN0IGLJl4UN5_op1eZ8ltE35z2Yw4FEpToau2k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JR0SHwk4bAHlXEPC_symxo7B5cnUcYybIHPzXCRFy0c\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"qNYRW8VlNEvMvISrYZKVkQbm4sfwmR6vMh1wANyi34s\"}"
