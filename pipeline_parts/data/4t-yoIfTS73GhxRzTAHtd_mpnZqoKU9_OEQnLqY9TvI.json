"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"If you’re reading this you’ve probably used a social network.  Social networks are the place we share everything from baby photos to political opinions.  These network are our de-facto public squares and the culture they enable and incentivize translates to the real-world and impacts all of our lives.\\n\\n> “Ask yourself, what are we doing here as a species, for the most part, we're creating and consuming culture. The near term goal should be pretty obvious, we have to build a culture that is conducive to sanity.\\n>\\n> We need a culture that is at minimum compatible with our long term survival. And we have serious problems to solve.  Infrastructure, pandemic preparedness, climate change, cybersecurity, education, wealth inequality, our relationship with China.\\n>\\n> Wouldn't it be amazing to just get busy and sort this stuff out without all the animosity and conspiracy thinking and dogmatism and perverse incentives and everything else that makes sane policies and compromises impossible?”\\n>\\n> \\\\- [Sam Harris](https://www.samharris.org/) (Neuroscientist, Philosopher, Best Selling Author)\\n\\nThis thinking resonates with me because I want to live in a culture that is conducive to sanity and compatible with our long term survival and I want to solve the serious problems that we face.  I believe that the vast majority of you agree.  These desires are non-partisan and independent of socioeconomic status.\\n\\nAt [Chaos](https://www.trychaos.ai/) we believe that a in order to build this culture and solve these problems we need to first build a new type of network that enables and incentivizes it.  A place to have complicated conversations, share ideas, and problem solve.  This isn’t what social networks were designed for, so we’re building something new.\\n\\nChaos is a network designed to capture, identify, and distribute the best thinking in the world.  We’re calling it an “anonymous brainstorming network”, but that’s a mouthful so if you’ve got a better idea [let us know](https://twitter.com/trychaos_ai).  I personally like to think of it as collective intelligence.\\n\\nThis anonymous brainstorming network will be different from social networks in many ways, but two of the most important are anonymity and distribution.\\n\\n* Every post is anonymous.  Your engagement with every idea is based on the idea alone, not on a bias you may hold towards the source.  Chaos is a place to think and exchange thoughts without fear.  On this network you can’t destroy an idea by discrediting the creator.\\n* There are no friends or followers.  Your distribution and influence are driven by your positive contributions to the community.  Act in bad faith and no one will see what you have to say.  Contribute constructively and you can become an influential thought leader regardless of your current social network celebrity.  On this network everyone’s ideas get a shot.\\n\\nThere are precisely 0 networks that have ever succeeded doing what we’re trying to do, but we believe that if we succeed this network will accelerate the shift to a culture that values rational, logical, and collaborative thinking.  And if we fail we hopefully provided the next team the learnings they need to succeed.  That’s a shot worth taking 100/100 times.\\n\\nWe’ve got a long way to go, but if this is something you want to be a part of we’d love you to [join our beta](https://www.trychaos.ai/)!  If this is a project you’re interesting in working on, [let us know](https://chaosai.typeform.com/to/NNQ0JMKP)!\\n\\nI’m looking forward to sharing more as we continue to progress.
