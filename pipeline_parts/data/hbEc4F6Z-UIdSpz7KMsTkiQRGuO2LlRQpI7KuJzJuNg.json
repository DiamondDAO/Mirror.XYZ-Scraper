"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Part 1 — Fundamental Analysis\\n\\n\\nMany people coming into crypto go through a similar path:\\n1 — This crypto thing sounds like a total scam, I’m not going anywhere near it\\n2 — Wait a minute though, people are making a lot of money and I wouldn’t mind a piece of that\\n3 — There’s something to this crypto thing after all. These are real problems that I’ve been thinking about for a while and the solutions are being worked on by really smart people\\n4 — Alright you got me, crypto is fucking awesome\\nYou join Twitter, follow a bunch of people, think you’ve got it all figured out, keep reading, make some bets, make some money, lose some money, lose even more money and then\\n\\nSo what now?\\nI’m going to give you everything you need to start building out your network, the rest is up to you\\n\\nThe Importance of Having a Network:\\n\\n\\nIn any market, especially one as dynamic and fast moving as crypto, there are always opportunities to make money\\nWhich is great but when there’s always opportunity it makes it very difficult to zoom in on the few that you really should be taking\\nYou quickly come to the realization that the big multiples are made in taking selective early bets on solid projects that are under the radar but which you believe will get a lot of traction when word gets out\\nIt’s clearly obvious to you that the people that have the best networks are getting access to this kind of information all the time\\nTheir asymmetrical access to information gives them an edge\\nTo be clear — we’re not talking about the much discussed “pump and dump” schemes here but good projects with real potential for upside over time\\nBut you don’t know any of these people personally\\nWorse than that — it seems like everyone is trying to be their “friend”\\nWhat are you meant to do?\\n\\nNo Such Thing as a Free Lunch\\nI’ll tell you what 99.9% of people do:\\n\\n* Simp\\n* Beg\\n  Whether comments on Tweets, being tagged or in DMs every large account has thousands of messages that are a variation on the following:\\n* Sir you’re the greatest of all time, please shine some of your light on me\\n* Sir I’m poor. Please throw me some scraps of money and/or alpha\\n* Sir please spend time and effort teaching me things. I promise I’ll be the best student of all time\\n\\nTo be blunt, this doesn’t work\\nWhy?\\nTalking personally, I am REALLY busy\\nI literally never, ever have anywhere near enough time to finish even a small percentage of the things I want to do\\nOn top of that, the nature of my work life means I am constantly battling to spend time and effort nurturing the relationships that are most important to me — my friends and family\\nMoney is no longer my number one priority, time is\\nThis hasn’t always been the case\\nIn the distant past I moved continents with my meagre life savings and a dream\\nI had all the time in the world but no money\\nBelieve me, I have done my fair share of grunt work, toilet cleaning and all nighters in my time to slowly but surely shift that balance\\nI don’t think it’s a stretch to assume that the vast majority of people who you’d like to be in your network are in a somewhat similar situation\\n\\nCut out The Survivorship Bias\\n\\n\\nAs a business owner you learn the hard way that you’re not going to be the next Mark Zuckerberg\\nYes, some people have an idea, launch a website and boom, they’re a Billionaire\\nBut most people don’t\\nIn fact, most people just fail and give up\\n(for proof — check on every one of your friends/cousins/neighbors who’ve launched an “awesome business idea” and see how they’re getting on)\\nThe vast majority of those who “make it” have taken the age old path\\nWorking harder than most people would be willing to, having an obsessive ability to continue in the face of seemingly endless failures and overwhelming evidence that you should give up and patience to grind through the long process towards success\\nIt’s the same in crypto\\nYes some people took their last $100 in their mom’s basement and bet on a DeFi coin, rolled it forward and ended up with millions of dollars that they’ve managed to keep\\nGuess what, it isn’t going to be you\\nThe odds are so tiny it’s not even worth considering\\nSo drop that bullshit in your head right now and strap in for the grind\\nIt’s going to take time, it’s going to take monumental effort, you’re going to want to quit over and over and over again\\nThere’s not going to be any instant satisfaction here\\nAre you ready?\\n\\nHelp First\\n\\n\\nWhen your biggest asset is time, then you can use it as currency\\nIf you’re offering time to people who have very little of it, they’re much more likely to pay attention to you\\nBut how do you do this?\\nWhat not to do\\n“Sir, I’m willing to help you with anything you want, just tell me what to do”\\nI’ll tell you why\\nI own businesses — I know people are willing to help me with anything I want if I give them something in return for it\\nI know this because I have staff, it isn’t news to me that this is how things work\\nWhat I do know is that getting people to help me out almost always first involves a significant amount of my time — again, the one thing I don’t have to spare\\nWhen I started in crypto I had 0 followers, knew nobody and didn’t know where to start\\nAlthough I had developed a good network offline, eventually I decided that I wanted to build out my online network too — from the ground up\\nI had to figure out a way to stand out and get the attention of the people I wanted to notice me\\nSo here’s the secret, you ready?\\n\\nWhat to do\\n\\n\\nWatch big accounts on Twitter, ones you would like to be in your network\\nSee what they’re commenting on and what they’re posting about\\nWhen you see them post something that seems like a question such as:\\n“I keep seeing $XYZ mentioned. Sounds cool actually but I don’t have the time to look into it”\\nBoom, now it’s your chance to shine with your DM:\\n“I saw you posted a question about $XYZ on (wherever they posted it)\\nI’m not related to the project at all but it looks interesting and I’ve done some research on the project for you, here’s a link to my report (insert link)\\nI’m not looking for anything in return, just happy to help\\nIf you’ve got any questions about the project let me know!”\\nHad I done FA on the project before I saw the comment?\\nOf course not, the comment was the first I’d heard of it\\nI then took the time to do my research on the project, put together a quick, easy to read FA report and sent it over (as a link to a Google doc, because people don’t want to open random files)\\nMany times this meant jumping off my couch, opening my computer and putting in 2–3 solid hours of work at 11pm on a Friday night instead of drinking a few beers and relaxing\\nThis is just the nature of the beast\\nEither you’re willing to put in the work or someone like me will do it first and you’ll be shit out of luck\\n\\nWhat Next?\\n\\n\\nA lot of the time I never heard back, that’s going to happen\\nIt doesn’t matter, in the end you only need one domino to fall to start making progress\\nIf you don’t hear back, that’s just one more for your portfolio, one more chance you got to practice and, if you were lucky enough to be researching a project you actually liked in the end— a chance you didn’t have before to learn about a potentially great investment\\nI guarantee that eventually you will hear back with a:\\n“wow this is awesome, thanks a lot”\\n“So Now You Ask for Something, Right?”\\nNope, that’s how you fuck it up\\nWhat you do now is let them know, as Jordan Belfort would say, that you are:\\nSharp as a tack. Enthusiastic as hell. An expert in your field\\nYou reply back with something like:\\n“Glad you liked it! I love doing this kind of research\\nIf you see something else that you’re interested in just shoot the name over to me and I’ll do the same again, anytime”\\nWill you always hear from them again? No\\nBut eventually you will start getting some responses\\nWhat’s the Point?\\nThis seems like a lot of work for nothing, right?\\nWrong\\nSincere effort is never wasted, even if the result isn’t what you expected\\nEven if nothing comes out of it at all in terms of building a network, now you’re someone who knows how to do FA on any project that you come across in a quick an efficient manner because you’ve put in the time and effort to practice\\nBut with persistence something will come out of it\\nIn my experience, once I’d gained even a little traction it snowballed pretty quickly\\nSuddenly I was being asked by big players, even ones I hadn’t reached out to directly, if I wouldn’t mind helping them out with something\\nI was being invited into private discussions, offered positions and asked if I was interested in participating in investments\\nAs with all things in my life — first came the effort, then the money followed\\nSo that’s the theory — but maybe you’re stuck about exactly how to put it into practice now?\\nDon’t worry, I’ve got you\\n\\n\\nStep by Step Guide\\n\\n\\nTwitter\\nIf you’ve used Twitter already then you’ll know about following accounts, turning on Notifications and creating Lists\\nAll of these are fine and will do what you need\\nPersonally, I like to streamline data and minimize alerts as far as possible\\nThis method can help you to put the data automatically into a format that’s easy to manage\\n\\nReports\\nWriting an Investment Thesis before making an investment is very helpful\\nI have done it both inside and outside of crypto, for myself and for others\\nIt takes a LOT of time and effort\\nIt has a time and a place but this isn’t really it\\nIf you start getting really good at FA you could try to write one for yourself just to go through the process, who knows where it might lead?\\nI’m telling you right now, there’s no way on earth you’re knocking one of these out in 2–3 hours (at least, not well)\\nYou want to start with a simple, structured template that you can follow to get yourself started\\n\\nNow you have all the tools you need to start building out your network while at the same time practicing and honing your skills as a fundamental analyst\\nBoth of these will help you on your path towards success\\nOne last tip I will give you — have initiative and be nice\\nSo much of what I see and receive myself on Twitter is “Sir, please explain this”\\nSomething that would be easier and better explained by a quick Twitter, Google or Youtube search\\nDon’t be that guy\\nBe the guy who replies to other’s questions with thoughtful answers\\nReply to messages asking for help with “Of course, what do you need?”\\nMake a note of things you don’t understand and research them fully. If you’re going to ask a question make it an insightful one, not a basic one\\nBe the kind of person that people want to come to with interesting information and feel kindly disposed towards offering things to\\nSo now, get off your ass and get to the grind\",\"timestamp\":1640099972,\"title\":\"How to Build Your Network in Crypto\"},\"digest\":\"DybIbfrzLYPtdB3dEKzUzZCkfFcclBjohAxRldxfGNY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x69d4b6Ef6E58365af264023C899CDD77c2F271aF\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xYPcATWTXUHjGXW7Rzt474xAIf8okDcvUWb1nWmvcSU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"x27Q8d5DEYqSOPDEceXzOcYmfshIG6ZLNnQr4UWJwhk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"WAgS3WZh9m_LmADvgcBOd4yDrJFj7wI6OuYS5VoL3lPB0hlVGNpwS4ZsKn7Vi1CTNAr5JZ6_QR0_BPhnYZRmPg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x75a90a02d92ecd34da299ae261f4f2fb35792f939a8808aec8623b779a47a9ff13e7b0e8657ab48ddafd41c6d898042c739bc5b07b0c60805495dfd10c08c04d1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xYPcATWTXUHjGXW7Rzt474xAIf8okDcvUWb1nWmvcSU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"x27Q8d5DEYqSOPDEceXzOcYmfshIG6ZLNnQr4UWJwhk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"DybIbfrzLYPtdB3dEKzUzZCkfFcclBjohAxRldxfGNY\"}"
