"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Uniswap is definitely one of the biggest innovations in the DeFi segment track, leading the development of decentralized exchange DEX. Uniswap has been iterating from V1, V2 to V3, which is the highest version, and it was launched in May this year. The launch of V3 has once again put Uniswap at the forefront of the market as more and more users choose to trade with Uniswap. Uniswap V3 of the biggest innovation is to choose the price interval market, in the previous version and DEX, are the company in all price ranges, namely currency price falls to zero or increased to infinity, the LP is market funds can provide liquidity, but tokens of the actual transaction price is often in a relatively narrow fluctuation range, Therefore, the biggest drawback of market making on a full scale is the low utilization rate of capital. With V3, users can choose to make a market within a certain price range, so that the utilization rate of market funds has been greatly increased, according to the official introduction of the capital utilization rate increased 4,000 times. V3 also implements single currency market making. When LP sets the market making price range outside the current market price range, it implements single currency market making. For example, we use ETH/USDT and the current market price of ETH is 4544 USDT. For example, 5000--6000 USDT, 3000--4000USDT, then as long as the deposit of a token can make the market. In addition, the Uniswap V3 platform allows LP to choose fees for market making. However, fees are not unlimited and there are currently three tiers available. The process rate effect step set up, mainly in order to balance the benefits and risks, while LP at high risk, should earn a higher fee as compensation, and for stable currency transaction, the LP risks (e.g., volatile loss) is relatively lower, so the formalities should be set to relatively low rates. The launch of Uniswap V3 has led to the evolution of the DEX market. More and more DEX are working on implementing all the functions of V3. SheepDex has implemented Uniswap V3 as the DEX running on the BSC chain most quickly. It is currently the first DEX on the market besides Uniswap to implement V3 functionality and has received a lot of attention in the market. SheepDex has implemented selective price range market making, multi-stage fee setting and single currency market making, so let's focus on single currency market making and what it gives us for trading purposes. Before taking a look at single-currency market making, we'll take a look at the SheepDex option for price range making. You can go to SheepDex with your digital wallet, for example, if you go to TokenPocket and you type in <https://sheepdex.org/#/home> and click the link to go to SheepDex, Then market - making operations can be carried out in the flow pool interface. For example, we choose a BNB/BUSD pair. After selecting the pair, the system displays the current BNB price (in BUSD) and gives the pair (BNB in BUSD) a default market making price range. You can see from the market making screen at SheepDex that the default market making price range is 50% down to 100% up.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qyOE101v9NgFTXALejrlq.png?height=1226&width=872)\\n\\nThe current market price for BNB is 592.205 BUSD and SheepDex defaults to 592.205 between 50% down and 100% up, beyond which liquidity will no longer be available. Of course, we can modify the default price range and set a more reasonable market making price range according to our own understanding of the market. The method of modification is also very simple, you can slide the price upper limit and lower limit scroll bar to modify, you can also click the \\\"-+\\\" symbol to modify, of course, you can also directly enter the lowest exchange rate and the highest exchange rate input box that you think more reasonable market price upper limit and lower limit.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d68tZmt-TCTcYWl9b-plA.png?height=1222&width=872)\\n\\nSheepDex has greatly improved the efficiency with which market-making funds are used by pooling liquidity and you will get more for the same amount of money. It is much easier to understand single-currency market making once you have understood the selective price range for SheepDex, but to understand the single-currency market making function and the changes it has made to us, we will use BNB/BUSD as an example. The current market price of BNB is 592 USDT, we can set the market price range to be higher than the market price of this token (592 USDT), for example we now set the market price range to 883.3USdt to 1338.9USdt, as shown in the figure below.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GMDuNGuNORlhkw8zOpwD_.png?height=1230&width=860)\\n\\nThat is, the current market range is higher than the current market price, when we only need to deposit a token BNB to make the market, namely a single currency market.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/suiqHPSTXSyfF_v6dlHjm.png?height=1258&width=868)\\n\\nWhen we deposit BNB in the market and the market price of BNB rises to the market price range (883.3usdt to 1338.9USdt), LP can earn the market profit. However, our BNB will be sold continuously, i.e., exchanging BNB for BUSD. In fact, the realization of \\\"high sales\\\".\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7pcGOjniNH_qrmIS6RTWI.png?height=1244&width=860)\\n\\nWhen we set the BNB/BUSD market price range below the current market price, such as 181.95 BUSD to 398.5 BUSD, we can make the market only by deposing BUSD in a single currency.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/clpuZKEhEo8U4ec292RBD.png?height=1222&width=866)\\n\\nWhen the price of BNB falls into the market-making price range, the system will use BUSD to buy BNB again and again. This is what is called \\\"low buying\\\". When the price of BNB falls below a certain level, the system will buy BNB again and again. It seems that CEX does not automatically implement this functionality. As is known to all, if you want to make money in the investment field, is four words \\\"buy low/sell high\\\", when the subject matter to buy when prices are low, and then sell when prices, so as to realize profit, though only four simple words, but it is very difficult to do, before we are all in the centralized exchange CEX to buy low/sell high, Although the threshold of use of the centralized exchange is low, it also has many inherent disadvantages, such as the need for KYC certification, and the tokens are held by the exchange.\\n\\nEvery year, users always lose a lot of assets because the exchange runs away or other security problems occur. With the development of decentralized exchange DEX, more and more users choose to trade in DEX, such as SheepDex for assets on the BSC chain. Not only does SheepDex not require registration and KYC to protect personal privacy, but also the private key of token is in the hands of users. Don't worry about the exchange running away. In addition, you can buy tokens at a low price and sell them at a high price through single-currency market making in SheepDex, which allows you to set more complex strategies based on users' needs. \\n\\nFor example, users can set a reasonable buying or selling price range and then buy or sell tokens at a low or high price when they enter the specified price range. Whereas in centralised exchanges there is usually a fixed price point for listing, SheepDex has a range that you think is reasonable, so SheepDex is much more widely used.\",\"timestamp\":1636118691,\"title\":\"SheepDex acts as Uniswap V3 on the BSC chain and this allows you to buy tokens low and sell tokens high\"},\"digest\":\"u6p-DlKAjZEtJxXI10tbBRe3keKtrTUHbl0K_cWM_48\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x29bD5940438dabeef8D7384fC1AC4A471dE2B668\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"KbWwF5xdzf0V7PcBw1JxAEAqkc2N22KsCgPUTsk669w\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eLrh20_IkwxbanNr2BZdZof9K8aCZi5Wr6F55JV4v28\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"AhCdSEosfNBWaCatvPqmxkVCitNpxfSl0iop5ZVw2gJwr46-esj-vXZcxNmVfkRFzZOCtQp5HKEurHspBB9H2A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe3852c0a9c0c8d7f6366f829bf2a8d8c331754b0bb9ff210aa6c1786fd18cd4d229e26680b05236bb3d04ada1870e118c53e8f52ea3c71b56d68aa307bf941901b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"KbWwF5xdzf0V7PcBw1JxAEAqkc2N22KsCgPUTsk669w\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eLrh20_IkwxbanNr2BZdZof9K8aCZi5Wr6F55JV4v28\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"u6p-DlKAjZEtJxXI10tbBRe3keKtrTUHbl0K_cWM_48\"}"
