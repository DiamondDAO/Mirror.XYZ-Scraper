"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"With the vigorous development of blockchain technology, digital currency is the most successful application. The characteristics of blockchain itself are somewhat similar to those of digital currency. We all know that the characteristics of blockchain are decentralized, distributed point-to-point transaction ledger, tamper proof, traceable, open and transparent, anonymity, etc., and digital currency is the landing application of its technology itself, What are the specific characteristics?\\nThe rapid development of digital currency can form an upsurge all over the world, surpassing the achievements of electronic currency and virtual currency, and creating many myths of wealth creation. This is obvious all over the world. Such extraordinary achievements are closely related to the characteristics of digital currency itself: global, exclusive ownership, no hidden costs, cross platform Low transaction cost and decentralization.\\nGlobal.\\nIn any corner of the world, as long as there are network equipment, you can buy, sell, mine and other behaviors. Any networked computer can manage its own digital assets.\\nLow transaction costs.\\nIn the Internet age, we need to pay a certain fee to the third-party platform for transaction transfer in China. If it is cross-border transfer, the fee will be more, and we can't transfer in real time, so we need a waiting process; The point-to-point transaction of digital currency realizes basically low cost and saves a lot of time; Even now, many exchanges still carry out the behavior that trading is equal to mining, and the trading can still be profitable.\\nNo hidden costs.\\nIn the process of transaction between both parties, we can make payment to the other party as long as we know the other party's collection address, and unlike the restrictions on transfer limit and handling fee of current banks and third-party platforms.\\nExclusive ownership.\\nNow we store third party organizations, such as banks, Alipay, etc., in addition to ourselves, in fact, these third parties can manipulate our account assets, but because of our legal and moral constraints, it seems that we are very safe, but we can also see some bank staff's mistakes or losses caused by hacker attacks from some news reports. For example, some people suddenly have hundreds of millions more bank cards, and some people inexplicably have less money, so it shows that it is not absolutely safe or exclusive ownership; However, the digital currency of blockchain technology is different. As long as you control the private key of digital currency, you can save the digital assets in any relevant media. No one can obtain it except the owner who controls the private key. This is the real exclusive ownership.\\nCross platform.\\nThe use of digital currency is not limited by the scope of the platform and can be transferred freely on each platform. The brick moving we are familiar with is a typical cross platform operation.\",\"timestamp\":1640223714,\"title\":\"5 features of blockchain\"},\"digest\":\"iMT3eUBO_RHmQp4zYst_UfQIi6sM0fU_8y0U-CWHY6M\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5469f22Fc52ad7a5E1f430A75B1Cbd542393DFB0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_IJZL8hXaSkuCIE0tI7n_8ASHLnVeJ_LcxPrrsBZTKY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ggF0A8gJumA5rFLd-qeOi6zBU7F5-iQlcoJHZiI3Q8I\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"G_4F6rfYOq0B1c8CVdsM16ohkFrh8zeVbtAE6_8KAPFqHS_jEStN-kCKeMCn3CTzfdbnVUtWVYsmpbbEqHdyig\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1105db673b7a76229175e1c63d2e72c84c937b1970ce57e5d0e92f90629775416799d177fed0364991d16fb22a28f727d1116e893539b4ebbb2e59a6bda813b01c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_IJZL8hXaSkuCIE0tI7n_8ASHLnVeJ_LcxPrrsBZTKY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ggF0A8gJumA5rFLd-qeOi6zBU7F5-iQlcoJHZiI3Q8I\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"iMT3eUBO_RHmQp4zYst_UfQIi6sM0fU_8y0U-CWHY6M\"}"
