"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"To our Forefront community, we‚Äôre excited to announce we‚Äôve applied to become an [ENS delegate](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-dao-delegate-applications/815). For those not familiar with ENS, they are building a truly decentralized identity solution. If you‚Äôve seen people with names like myname.eth, you‚Äôve seen ENS‚Äô work. Now, they are introducing a delegate committee to help shape the future of ENS.\\n\\n[https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-dao-delegate-applications/815/798](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-dao-delegate-applications/815/798)\\n\\n## Calling on our community\\n\\nTo show your support for Forefront‚Äôs application, you can delegate your vote to our application when claiming your $ENS allocation or directly on our [delegate page](https://claim.ens.domains/?delegate=forefrontdao.eth). \\n\\n### How to choose Forefront DAO as a delegate\\n\\n1. When you arrive to the \\\"Choose a delegate\\\" screen be sure to click the search bar at the top right hand corner that says \\\"Enter ENS or address\\\".\\n2. Search the following ENS domain üëâ ***ForefrontDAO.eth***\\n3. Click and confirm to select Forefront as delegate ü§ù\\n\\nBelow is a great video by [Alisha.eth](https://twitter.com/futurealisha/status/1457048630276222977?s=21) on how to to claim the airdrop and delegate.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/futurealisha/status/1457048630276222977?s=21](https://twitter.com/futurealisha/status/1457048630276222977?s=21)\\n\\n## Why apply?\\n\\nOur interest comes from our strongly aligned mission with ENS. As ENS works to build a truly decentralized global identity platform, our mission at Forefront is to provide the port of entry to web3 for all of those people who choose to participate in it.\\n\\nIn addition to overlapping missions, we have and want to continue to have strong ties to ENS as organizations. We believe deeply in the approach ENS is taking towards community ownership and stewardship of the steps that will ensure the future we build is better than what came before. That is the same approach we are taking to paving clear paths to important projects in web3.\\n\\nThanks as always for your continued support, and congrats to the ENS team on an exciting next step.\",\"timestamp\":1636349748,\"title\":\"GM!
