Music is the fuel, electricity, and light of the world.\\n\\nCenturies ago, Elektra had a thriving civilization with a deep rooted sense of value towards art. But soon, motives around greed and self-interest took over, and the music that powered this world was lost.\\n\\nYour mission is to travel to Elektra, and help us collectively revive, restore and reignite this once beautiful world back to health.\\n\\n***Will you accept your mission?***\\n\\n[Elektra QA](crowdfund://0x15343f1AC209aAd292ae5dbB7Db68e8E0d075b7E?version=tiered_1&network=rinkeby&features=backers,podium&podium_media=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F1b024368-be13-4117-b9a9-bbe7a2ede9d7.jpeg,https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F61683cd8-f0aa-4f69-b74a-9c67a9393400.jpeg,https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F2d77a4f0-38f3-4eb0-a91f-b01c7c24871f.jpeg)\\n\\n[Elektra QA](crowdfund://0x15343f1AC209aAd292ae5dbB7Db68e8E0d075b7E?version=tiered_1&network=rinkeby&features=editions)\\n\\n\\n\\n### The Songcamp Elektra Crowdfund\\n\\n**Songcamp Elektra** is the second experiment created by *Songcamp* — a community of musicians, artists and strategists with a deep interest in learning what happens when music and **the new internet** crash into each other.\\n\\nSongcamp acts a lot like a **web3 laboratory** — experimenting at the far out edges of how web3 tools and tech can affect positive change in the lives and work of artists.\\n\\nThe Songcamp Elektra project is made up of ~42 artists, project ops and strategists working together to bring this world to life. This crowdfund intends to raise the funds that will enable us to do just that. \\n\\nWe will use **90% of the amount raised to put towards the *Elektra* project**. These funds will go toward the core team of project managers, web developers, strategists and artists working directly on the project. Other costs include transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain, web hosting and file storage. We intend to save a portion of these funds to act as the *seed money* in standing up the *ElektraDAO* once this initial phase of the project is complete. (more on this below)\\n\\nThe remaining **10% will go directly to the artists who created the *Portal Ticket* visuals**. \\n\\n[Chi](edition://0x9adDcb5546d5bBFf5C6bCb582279c6aE61CD67C1?editionId=26&version=crowdfund_1)\\n\\n[Psi](edition://0x9adDcb5546d5bBFf5C6bCb582279c6aE61CD67C1?editionId=24&version=crowdfund_1)\\n\\n[Phi](edition://0x9adDcb5546d5bBFf5C6bCb582279c6aE61CD67C1?editionId=25&version=crowdfund_1)\\n\\n### Phase 1: Songcamp Elektra\\n\\n*Songcamp Elektra* will run for 4 weeks, until the first week of August. \\n\\nOnce through the portal, you will begin your journey. You will work with other players to move through this foreign land, discover more about the history of Elektra, and find your way to victory. \\n\\nIf successful, you will unlock the help you need — the people and items along the way that will help you accomplish your mission. Remember, **it is music that powers the world of *Elektra***. Luckily, you’ll have a lot of talented musicians to help along the way. \\n\\nAt times during the camp, 1-of-1 NFTs will be released. A 20% share of the proceeds from collected NFTs will go towards the ElektraDAO, while a select few of the NFTs will be placed in the ElektraDAO Vault.\\n\\n### Phase 2: ElektraDAO + The $ELEKTRA Token\\n\\n> We will build a world, and own that world together. \\n\\nUpon purchasing your *Portal Ticket* NFT, you will also receive a portion of $ELEKTRA tokens based on the amount contributed. You will receive 100 $ELEKTRA for every 0.1 ETH you contribute to the crowdfund. \\n\\nWe will retain 75% of $ELEKTRA’s supply in the project’s treasury, and distribute the majority to the artists, project ops and strategists working directly on the project. The remaining amount will be used to create bounty rewards for the wider network, as well as vest a portion in the Songcamp treasury. \\n\\n**As this project evolves, the lines between creator and audience will blur.** Game builders will also play the game they are building; and game players will also help in building the game they are playing. \\n\\nBy the end, we will have a community of contributors to the *Elektra project* that all hold $ELEKTRA tokens based on their contribution levels. At this point, **we will have *exited to community* — and the project will be owned and governed by $ELEKTRA token holders.**\\n\\n### What Happens Then?\\n\\nWell, then it’s up to the network. \\n\\nThe *ElektraDAO* will have created an incredibly strong backbone:\\n1. A core group of musicians, visual artists, project ops, strategists and backers with sharp coordination and collaboration skills — plus an overflowing level of squad energy.\\n\\n2. 1-of-1 NFTs from the Elektra story secured in the DAO’s vault.\\n\\n3. A flow of royalties from the artwork created in-camp.\\n\\nWe then have the exciting opportunity to collectively decide what to do with all this. \\n\\nSome early ideas: make more art together, continue evolving the world and story of *Elektra*, experiment with and carve out new paths to monetization and value realization for the art and artists we have, or our personal favourite: \\n\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1626015788,\"title\":\"Songcamp Elektra Crowdfund\",\"publication\":\"d\"},\"digest\":\"HJXMdeHHULJDogZhXbbltcooFH8GIqxxgApiIeeNXD4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5507dbd48a5A5bAcE8a6030e878cC4E0af147C33\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"F_E5yXpey_ouFci12fHrGSuhnJ4V_IFMydfuqwCbNIw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8wPfdWSwBIGb7v6_ErQeeR0foNAP9_C-3rYNy-WMzjg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"u9W7_FJlp-hlj0unAcDNeQ9zWsErGc_IwEtVXCWW9LylqbGnMWHT-EP-HxNDvw14IACAbmW0utgxxFwo9u1aRQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x45ec88dc0784b1548d8ef45782486336cacd959a8e1b04d0303aa60b82b9319851c7fac5a46f156ef252c5ba4367a92b3215e7cf97a1df6562d103d108323a271c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on d.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"F_E5yXpey_ouFci12fHrGSuhnJ4V_IFMydfuqwCbNIw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8wPfdWSwBIGb7v6_ErQeeR0foNAP9_C-3rYNy-WMzjg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"HJXMdeHHULJDogZhXbbltcooFH8GIqxxgApiIeeNXD4\"}"
