"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"In the Euler Finance information update, the team revealed that its internal quantitative analysts are further improving Euler's risk framework.\\n\\nAt the same time, Euler's fifth audit is also in progress.\\n\\nIt can be seen that in order to prevent being affected by the frequent large-scale hacking incidents in the second half of 2021, Euler has always maintained a rigorous and responsible attitude towards its own security.\\n\\nNext, we continue the content of the first part and introduce you to other aspects of Euler's innovations.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/omA8TrLSHG_7wXy3QA2SR.png?height=1245&width=1080)\\n\\nBrand new clearing mechanism\\n\\nEuler has also made many innovations in liquidation. In its liquidation model, Euler adds the value of the borrower's debt assets, and considers the combination of mortgage rate and borrowing rate to customize its exclusive liquidation threshold.\\n\\nIn addition, in terms of resistance to MEV, Euler used classic Dutch auctions and set up a \\\"discount acceleration mechanism\\\" for lps (liquidity providers) to strengthen the shield.\\n\\nEuler also established a \\\"multi-collateral stable pool\\\" internally for liquidators to conduct liquidation at low cost.\\n\\n1\\n\\nLiquidation surcharge\\n\\nIn the process of liquidation, the liquidator needs to provide slightly more borrowed assets than the violator to repay the assets. This extra amount will be included as an expense in the liquidator's borrowed assets reserve.\\n\\nThe basic liquidation discount starts at the level of the fee and is therefore ultimately paid by the offender.\\n\\nOn this basis, more volatile assets that usually lead to more liquidation tend to accumulate reserves at a faster rate than less volatile assets, which helps protect loans to such assets people.\\n\\nIn addition, this fee can ensure that \\\"self-liquidation\\\" is always a net negative value, which increases the profit margin that some uncompliant and unethical manipulation strategies could have achieved.\\n\\n2\\n\\nResistance to MEV\\n\\nBasic knowledge:\\n\\nBefore introducing this method, let's add a bit of knowledge about miner extractable value (MEV).\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EKUUc9nwl7aYfoGfa3jj6.png?height=112&width=650)\\n\\nMEV refers to a measure of the profit obtained by miners through the ability to arbitrarily include, exclude, or reorder transactions in the blocks they produce.\\n\\nBased on the principle that every transaction in the Ethereum network is open and transparent, the following types of \\\"attacks\\\" that affect normal traders' transactions will appear in the network:\\n\\nFront-running: Refers to making a profit by placing a transaction before the target transaction (the attacked transaction) in the same block; it often occurs in clearing and arbitrage transactions.\\n\\nBack-running: Refers to making a profit by placing a specific transaction after the target transaction in the same block; it often occurs in Oracle transactions or large transactions.\\n\\nSandwich Attacks: This method is a combination of the above two forms, allowing the attacked transaction to be caught in the middle of two specific transactions \\\"forged\\\" by the miners for profit.\\n\\nThe sandwich attack greatly expands the range of attacks that miners can attack by virtue of their familiarity with the transaction sequence through the \\\"front and back attack\\\". Even an AMM transaction on an ordinary decentralized exchange may become the target of the attack. .\\n\\nThe method is: the attacker first opens the first \\\"pre\\\" transaction in order to create huge token price fluctuations, and then executes the second \\\"post\\\" transaction immediately after the execution of the attacked transaction, in exchange for the token that launched the attack to gain profit.\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nSo how does Euler's Dutch auction work? After the borrower reaches the liquidation line, Euler makes the liquidator's mortgage asset liquidation discount price gradually rise from the lowest point (that is, the income gradually decreases), thus creating a Dutch auction in the field of loan liquidation.\\n\\nExamples are as follows:\\n\\nIf the liquidator Bob can make a profit with 4% of the proceeds in a liquidation, the liquidator Alice may be able to grab the auction from Bob at a lower discount price (for example: 3%) through various means.\\n\\nThose who accept the lower discount price first will have priority in obtaining the right of liquidation.\\n\\nIn addition, Euler also provides another safeguard for liquidators:\\n\\nProvide a discount booster for LPs, which allows them to conduct Dutch auctions at lower prices for arbitrage before miners rush away.\\n\\nStress test on bad debt warning\\n\\nSimulation environment:\\n\\nTo ensure that bad debts are minimized under extreme conditions, the Euler team will stress test the liquidation scenarios by simulating the long-tail risk events of individual assets and asset portfolios to estimate the risk of bad debts.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0Rcu4v2_2gn_bYJUwHFPr.png?height=512&width=1024)\\n\\nExamples are as follows:\\n\\nSingle asset\\n\\nIf the index list of the agreement shows that the token jumps from 250th to 30th and can maintain that position for a long enough time, the team will simulate activities to check the share of bad debts in total loans under different borrowing factors, so that the team may The borrowing factor will be increased from 0.28 to 0.35.\\n\\nPortfolio\\n\\nIt is also possible to simulate a more complex environment, using 50 tokens from below quartiles as borrowed assets, and under high volatility, 4 mortgage assets (including 3 time-tested and 1 proposed new Mortgage) unified support.\\n\\nBy simulating tail risk scenarios, the team can assess the worst-case scenario of the agreement and decide whether it is appropriate to include collateral assets.\\n\\nAgreement governance\\n\\nIn Euler's white paper, the token economic model and community governance have not yet been supplemented. According to the existing information, we can currently know the following contents:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5Rumg2opN2aoM-mOQppIm.png?height=408&width=713)\\n\\nAbout EUL token\\n\\nThe Euler protocol is also based on the traditional DAO governance method, and long-term management is carried out by a community composed of the holders of the original token of the Euler (EUL) protocol.\\n\\nAs a voting right, EUL can be used to propose an upgrade agreement or vote on other people's proposals; EUL holders can directly vote on the proposal, or delegate the vote to a third party.\\n\\nEUL holders can finally vote on the following matters:\\n\\n1. Set the calculation factor borrowed by the isolation layer\\n2. Set calculation factors for specific asset mortgage and borrowing\\n3. What kind of assets are included in the cross layer and mortgage layer\\n4. Choice of risk parameters and changes to universal lending methods\\n\\nEuler Treasury\\n\\nThe Euler vault will also be managed by EUL holders.\\n\\nPart of the treasury will initially be locked and used to assist the agreement when problems such as funding difficulties arise in the agreement.\\n\\nThe remaining funds will be allocated to agreement users (lenders and borrowers), those who provide guarantees for the agreement (pledgers), and other contributors to the Euler ecosystem (grant recipients).\\n\\nThe ultimate goal of Euler Treasury is to transfer control of the agreement to all stakeholders.\\n\\nEuler Grants\\n\\nIn order to encourage developers to build on Euler and help integrate it into the wider DeFi ecosystem, a portion of Euler funds will be allocated to the Euler Grants program.\\n\\nThe purpose of the grant is to promote the development of Euler by establishing a community-driven DAO culture.\",\"timestamp\":1641228868,\"title\":\"EulerFinance: Borrowing the big energy of the small and medium physique on the track\"},\"digest\":\"rKndnDexL0RqkKCLwCzyxP636KeDlPqd8_ZB5pDwnN0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x79517dE7fce0De6A57a7B20Fa4947D85175a1a79\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wfbLpyNV6o7Q2-fvzOs-OZEks9y_BdoErk8UX7Sqc_Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"9ZGlCV4tkPyOGiAzuq4ugBI3OPCn7xaP7khI1O__p7M\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"CBYvvlLgzmxMQzsx7b8j5HXAeMT3LgeAMDGMkBxZRgFbZ11HRb24wjTM6EiflS6xd2Y7iU9YxarArWl0wvas6g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x26a37ea84c527a2cca946ec765d3266aef3b441b7f5142570a2e8f11f0ec11713615c9bb8f397a4f8ad132e30e49288584df8f9c525f1efed485330dccc3f8611c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wfbLpyNV6o7Q2-fvzOs-OZEks9y_BdoErk8UX7Sqc_Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"9ZGlCV4tkPyOGiAzuq4ugBI3OPCn7xaP7khI1O__p7M\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rKndnDexL0RqkKCLwCzyxP636KeDlPqd8_ZB5pDwnN0\"}"
