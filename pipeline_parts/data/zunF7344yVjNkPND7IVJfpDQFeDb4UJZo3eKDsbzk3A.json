Someone published the \\\"first book\\\" of Metaverse, some became the \\\"top analyst\\\" of Metaverse, and some were already selling paid courses on Metaverse knowledge...\\n\\n**Even Stanford University has launched a course with a special meta-universe taste in this semester** :\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4_w0Xz8vbANjeGUuwj3iF.png?height=297&width=600)\\n\\nThe number of this course is COMM166/266, and the topic is \\\"Virtual Humans\\\". Students can wear VR headsets in their dormitories or anywhere in the world and take classes remotely. At most, nearly 300 students may appear in the same virtual \\\"class\\\" at the same time.\\n\\nThese classrooms may be a virtual museum, or some more life-like scenes, or corners that have been visited by the least people on the earth, such as volcanic craters and submarine reefs. According to the course schedule, all students will complete more than 3300 hours in VR together this year...\\n\\n**More importantly, COMM166/266 became the first course in the history of Stanford University to be conducted entirely in VR.**\\n\\nStanford University Communication Professor Jeremy Bailenson said: “In this class, students don’t play VR occasionally. In fact, VR will become the cornerstone of our class.”\\n\\n**Almost 20 years old class, this time has new ideas**\\n\\nProfessor Bailenson is also the initiator and director of the Stanford Virtual Human Interaction Lab (VHIL). He has been teaching \\\"Virtual Humans\\\" at Stanford University since 2003.\\n\\nAccording to Bailenson, \\\"Virtual Human\\\" is Stanford University's \\\"flagship course\\\" on VR technology. This is the first time the students complete the course completely in a VR environment. This year, they are finally able to act as real \\\"virtual people\\\" in a real virtual space...\\n\\n\\\"No one has ever organized hundreds of students. In a few months, they wore VR headsets together and wandered in a virtual space. As far as I know, in the history of virtual reality and education, such things have changed from Never before,\\\" Bailenson said.\\n\\n\\\"In other schools, there may be a class with more than ten people using VR together. In our class, it will reach hundreds of people, and we will spend more than half of our time in VR. In this class We will break through the boundaries of VR experience.\\\"\\n\\nVR is becoming more and more popular. According to statistics, the number of VR equipment systems in use exceeds 10 million in the United States alone.\\n\\nThe COMM166/266 course will allow students to learn more about VR, a technology that will soon become mainstream with the explosion of Metaverse, from a variety of perspectives such as pop culture, engineering, behavioral science, and communication. In-depth understanding.\\n\\nThe VR scenes that will be used in the class are also varied.\\n\\nThere are museums:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KC6O2ZHomyRSlQ9FDu7NL.png?height=299&width=600)\\n\\nThere is a laboratory where students can do experiments together in a virtual space:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zgZohb3wiCc-qbEJs8L1x.png?height=342&width=600)\\n\\nThere is a \\\"virtual reality\\\" field trip, where students can watch the underwater coral reefs gradually destroyed by human activities through 360° panoramic video:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/N5emZKD1VYDTorAFZMYG-.png?height=344&width=600)\\n\\nYou can also take physical education classes in a virtual environment...\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nloLRK9tV1DKC78Z2AE6g.png?height=341&width=600)\\n\\nThe space created by the students themselves in VR:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hhFkWWZDw0qOrIxnsi6Fp.png?height=346&width=600)\\n\\nMany Stanford students have signed up for this course this year. The final selected 263 students come from economics, communication, anthropology, computer, comparative literature, psychology, sociology, political science, etc., and the diversity of departments is very high.\\n\\n**What's even more powerful is that every student who is selected for COMM166/266 can receive an Oculus Quest 2 headset and matching dual handles on the Stanford campus. For those students who are not in the local area, the school will also send the equipment to them:**\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JNsk3-2bCofhTX4pLZG8o.png?height=306&width=600)\\n\\nThe design of the course is very interesting: it emphasizes learning from practice, requires students to experience and participate more in VR scenes, and even design scenes by themselves. The core of this class is to allow students to experience the things that can only be learned in books in the past in a new, virtual, and interactive environment.\\n\\nFor example, when we talk about racial discrimination, no matter how the teacher explains it, it is difficult for a white-skinned person to see the discrimination that people of color experience daily. In the course of COMM166/266, there is such a class, the scene is co-designed by Stanford University VHIL and Columbia University sociology professor Courtney Cogburn.\\n\\n**This class is called \\\"1000 Cut Journey\\\". It was previously used as a VR immersive experience content, which has attracted much attention at the Tribeca Film Festival. In this class, students play a role of Michael Sterling, who has experienced all kinds of racial discrimination that he has experienced since childhood.**\\n\\n**It is for students to play black people in the virtual space and experience first-hand the various discriminations that black people face in their daily work and life.**\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JL6UedkAJQc5rZxjagKZt.png?height=338&width=600)\\n\\nComputer science student Allison Lettiere said that before this, his stereotype of VR was that it could only be used to play games. **After taking this class, she found that VR is also very suitable for creating a more immersive experience and helping people build empathy, which is very important for the direction of technological accessibility that she is concerned about.**\\n\\nHana Tadesse, a student who will graduate next year, also spoke highly of COMM166/266: **“Personal experience is the best way to understand things, and this class really did it.”**\\n\\n**| In the beginning, in response to the epidemic, VR classes have now become a stepping stone for Yuan Universe**\\n\\nSince the \\\"Virtual Human\\\" course was founded at Stanford University in 2003, VR hardware has always been part of the course, but in the past, teaching assistants and student volunteers were usually used for demonstrations, the number of people used at the same time, and the VR space shared by multiple people The scale has never been so big as today.\\n\\nHowever, last year, the new crown epidemic hit suddenly. Like many universities in the United States, all courses at Stanford University have to be taught remotely.\\n\\nThe new crown has brought challenges as well as opportunities. Professor Bailenson realized that although the epidemic prevented students from seeing each other in physical space, he had been studying VR technology for decades, but he could bring the students together again in the era of the epidemic.\\n\\n\\\"More importantly, after teaching remotely for more than a year, everyone has really had enough of Zoom,\\\" said the professor. With VR technology, everyone finally \\\"breaks\\\" Zoom’s grid screen and tried a lot of integration. The past was completely different and very exciting.\\n\\n(Professor Bailenson’s laboratory also released a research report on Zoom fatigue)\\n\\nIn order to further create a highly interactive classroom experience, the teaching assistants of COMM166/266 will frequently organize group discussions. Students stand together in a virtual space through VR virtual human avatars-this experience introduces a spatial dimension (although it is still virtual), which is easier than the previous experience of students having classes and meetings in Zoom Substitution makes it less prone to fatigue.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vl-ahPVbqi7iR3HyMrK0R.png?height=400&width=600)\\n\\nThis class has been in full swing at Stanford University, and its popularity also reflects how fashionable the \\\"meta universe\\\" is as a new popular technology concept, now outside of Stanford University in the Silicon Valley technology industry. As mentioned at the beginning of the article, Facebook, the leading company in Silicon Valley, even changed its name just to prove its determination to \\\"all in\\\" the meta universe.\\n\\n\\\"Our class is the meta-universe,\\\" Bailenson said. \\\"This class is a standard example of constructing the meta-universe. Our course covers hardware, software, content, and people, and our goal is to build a lasting, full-blown To understand the space and scene of the virtual person, and really use them to achieve (teaching) goals.\\\"\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JdJ5dYRwIZ7xqpmN2b1g1.png?height=359&width=600)\\n\\nThe long-term goal of this professor is to make students familiar with VR as soon as possible and more deeply. After all, it has established its position as one of the core technologies of the metaverse and will become a key communication tool and carrier in the future metaverse era.\\n\\n**In Professor Bailenson's view, for VR technology, today may also be a key point in time to determine the direction of technology in the next few decades. At this moment, let Stanford University students understand, be familiar with, and master VR technology-in turn, they can continue the path of innovation in Silicon Valley and use VR technology to promote technological progress.**\\n\\n\\\"From the beginning of the 21st century to today, VR has made great progress. I believe that in the hands of Stanford students, it will continue to bear fruit.\\\" Professor Bailenson said.\\n\\nNote: The cover image is from Ula Lucas for Stanford Daily, and the copyright belongs to the original author.
