"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1 Encounter\\n\\nI am waiting for you, waiting for the day when you find that you can finally like me. I am waiting for you, waiting for the day when you promise to be with me without hesitation. I am waiting for you, waiting for your prodigal son to turn around and finally feel that I am the best day. I have turned all the thoughts of Lian Chenghe into an addiction that others can't take away or experience. I also secretly liked the sweetness and troubles of this luxury. It's about you, it's about me, and it's a little bit of our distant connection. Look, how happy I am.\\n\\nI always feel that my story with her is like a TV series. I have liked her for seven years, from the first time I met her in college. I am definitely not a person who would believe in love at first sight, but for her, it really became an exception. I still clearly remember that at that time I was a young man who had just graduated from an 18th-tier county seat, with blank vision and curiosity. I found the dormitory very quickly in accordance with the requirements of the school’s online notice, and rushed to the playground in the central district to gather for registration. I am not a road idiot. I can quickly find my destination through my own observation and judgment. This also promoted me to become a person with few words.\\n\\nI ran to the banner that said our professional class. There was a plane tree next to it, and beside the tree was the rectangular table where we signed in. When I was about to lean over to write my name, I couldn't help but look up and see her. Maybe it's a habitual pause when I write, maybe it just so happens that I feel someone is coming, maybe it's because it's hot that I want to raise my head and wipe my sweat. I saw her. At that moment, I felt that I had seen another kind of world, so beautiful, so soft, and so throbbing. With her entire face, with her beautiful handwriting. I owe all this to the fate of our two holy gods. Rejoicing and pious. From then on, I knew that I no longer belonged to me, and my heart had followed her.\\n\\nI only met once, and she completely occupied my entire brain. I knew she was in the same class as me. This incident was enough for me to be excited for several days. Finally, when the class was assembled for the first time, everyone went to the podium to introduce themselves. I want to introduce myself better, and then better, so that she might notice me, and notice me, a chaotic young man who fell in love with her at first sight. I tried to raise my voice, trying to make my aftermath seem casual, like a breeze stroking the sea, but glancing at her so fiercely. I think of myself as a job applicant who is about to apply for a job, and I scrupulously fear that any part of my rhetoric will annoy her.\\n\\nI have always created opportunities for us to say hello when we meet, have always created topics that we can discuss together, and have always created the illusion that I have a good relationship with every girl in our class. Yes, we are familiar with each other, we should be friends. I still didn't confess, I don't know how I should confess to her. I like her so much, I can't even accept it. After she rejects me, we may not be able to achieve this reality. I am afraid of such a situation, I am afraid of her leaving, I am afraid that there is no clue about her in my world. Therefore, my love was driven to a dead end by me. Being alive again seems dead.\\n\\nI want to make her a Valentine's Day every day, so that she can receive my gifts every day and receive surprises happily every day. Therefore, not only Christmas, Christmas Eve, Labor Day, March 7 Girls’ Day, National Day 11, Children’s Day, etc., I will carefully choose a gift for her, as well as our class. The girl or his roommate in his dormitory wanted my love for her to be so blatant without embarrassing her. In normal school days, I would often buy milk tea and buy breakfast for her and her roommates. I smiled and said, I am used to getting up early, and helping you bring it is a matter of effort. At that time, they believed, and she also believed.\\n\\nI only think about her, and I want to wait for her. Not only did I have four years of college, but I still have a lifetime, although it seems that I am very superficial to say this sentence for a lifetime. However, I do think so.\\n\\nAdditional content: This is a true story. The protagonist of the story describes it verbally and the tacos describe it in words. The boy still loves her. It has been three years since graduation. In the past few days, the girl came to the city where the boy works-Shanghai. I hope he can have the courage to confess.\",\"timestamp\":1639284338,\"title\":\"I won't wait for you\"},\"digest\":\"OQSBtvBYo2wMpTPNEW1CjXTa2WrhTVPd8ezkYwhxfU4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xA14Ef0E1C1B3FE72706dC5F69Ce0595e9dBa0646\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"b9esoLr4kfLzxATlajVqrPTIK4K0G8bbj6Xm9DitIDE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"U5S-SKkrCczvwxX-eOjsMRcwAudFChgi20Rix4HL0vs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"L7wNClnaM5MxzqcbzvTMw6hCaOWDGlJbjKyNg_1hiWU0guNmhFaG7La7ZLRODyAZNKF32zbewdrhcuvnLeIbnQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd58add13146d7657a2f925b6b2b70d5227dd583a229058ccb98e9d7a996981681cdd4a8b1108ba632d230a80939d5a25c29228b39e3d9d68da020f7fe6499f3d1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"b9esoLr4kfLzxATlajVqrPTIK4K0G8bbj6Xm9DitIDE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"U5S-SKkrCczvwxX-eOjsMRcwAudFChgi20Rix4HL0vs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"SINKh_qiCSYbX2a9_0zAcsrdEvCPY7orE4Ovv8RkZ-Y\"}"
