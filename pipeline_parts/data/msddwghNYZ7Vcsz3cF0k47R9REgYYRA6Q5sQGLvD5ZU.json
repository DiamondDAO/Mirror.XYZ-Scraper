"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Close your eyes for a moment. \\n If I ask you to picture the streets of Hong Kong, what do you see? \\n  \\n Red taxi drivers honking impatiently… shouting on a street lined with pungent dried seafood shops, trams passing elegantly with the “Ding ding” sound… skyscrapers that pierce the sky… pawn shops with half-broken neon signs that keep blinking to survive…  \\n  \\n For me, it’s those blinking, fading neon signs that are sooo iconic of traditional Hong Kong – represent who we are as people, shining, resilient, entrepreneurial, creative. \\n Neon is the visual identity and language in Hong Kong.\\n\\nSadly, this symbol is starting to fade... \\n\\nIn 2018, I wanted to show a visiting journalist around what I remembered were the iconic streets of Hong Kong, streets that come to life with neon glow after dark. We walked around Wellington Street, Lockhart Road, Nathan Road.\\n\\nBUT \\n\\nTo our dismay, instead of being dazzled by the neon signs, only 10% remained, and more are being taken down every day. \\n\\nThat’s because of government policies, the lower production cost of LED neon and digital billboard signs, misinformation about their sustainability, and local sifus - masters of the craft, unable to teach this practice. This originates in Asian culture where one would only pass on all his skills to their descendants. Traditionally, even the sifus learned simply by observing their sifus, experimenting, and practicing on their own. And to this day, there are no academic guidelines or scientific textbooks in Hong Kong for the skills to be passed along, and it is still seen as a secret trade.\\n\\nI want to change all this.  \\n\\nI am the only active female neon practitioner in Hong Kong.  \\n\\nWhen I was 30, I begged 70-year-old Master Wong to teach me everything he knew, and with no formal methodology, we struggled together - him to teach, and me to learn.  \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MggLNRl6nuQ8kCMJqAYs-.png?height=606&width=1244)\\n\\nWhen I learnt all I could from him, I began to travel the world, learning and collaborating with neon artists for “The Neon Girl Project”. In the US, I learnt experimental Xenon gas injection from James and joined “She Bends”, a global network of female-identifying neon artists and in the Netherlands, I learnt glass sculpting from Remy.\\n\\nI have plans to go to France, Italy, South Korea and Taiwan. Forging international neon communities is vital for me.  \\n\\nNeon bending is a complex art form.\\n\\nFirst I design the pattern,  decide on the tube diameter, then I bend the glass by heating it over open flames as hot as 600 degrees Celsius. I have to carefully turn it, weld different pieces together, vacuum out the air, pump it with gas, wire it for electricity, create supportive backings and finally install the piece. It took me 3 months to master a perfect 90 degree bend. And it takes me around 10 to 15 hours to make a neon sign.\\n\\nNeon benders also have a deep knowledge of chemistry. \\n Did you know neon gas emits red light, and argon gas emits blue light.   \\n  \\n  \\n Neon bending requires physical strength, high mind control and quick body reaction. \\n A new neon glass tube is mostly 1.2m to 1.5m long. One challenge in making neon sign is that sometimes I have to hold a heavy 8m piece tangled glass tube with my left hand whilst balancing another 1.2m with my right. When I’m doing neon bending and welding, one millimeter of miscalculation would mess up the accuracy of the whole sign. \\n\\nIt is definitely a complicated craft where our heritage meets art, meets science, and a little bit of weightlifting and dance too. \\n \\n\\nI now see a trend of “opensourcing” knowledge in the community. \\n\\nI am proud to be part of a new generation of neon artists who are making this skill accessible and sharing the knowledge, opening up more opportunities for this complicated artisanal practice to evolve.\\n\\nAn example of this is my piece “Every Body Is A Beach Body”. With neither neon or argon gas, this work uses Xenon gas and experimental glass-blowing techniques I learnt from an emerging artist in the US.  \\n \\n\\n![\\\"Every Body Is A Beach Body\\\" at Soho House Hong Kong](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dGXZvyvGn8Q2VaWeeRkI7.JPG?height=1102&width=826)\\n\\n[https://theneongirl.com/every-body-is-a-beach-body/](https://theneongirl.com/every-body-is-a-beach-body/)\\n\\n[https://theneongirl.com/every-body-is-a-beach-body/](https://theneongirl.com/every-body-is-a-beach-body/)\\n\\nWe are reclaiming our visual heritage – and creating whilst looking forward. \\n\\nThe future of neon is up to us now. \\n\\nI truly enjoy how we, the new neon artists are supporting each other, and how I, as a Hong Kong neon practitioner with experimental techniques, can ensure neon signs live as a new form, memory and landscape in our city.  \\n\\n \\n Next time, you spot an old neon sign, appreciate its history, and when you see a new and experimental neon artwork, know that a new generation of artists is here, relighting our future in Hong Kong.\",\"timestamp\":1636467228,\"title\":\"Neon Art Holds Our Tradition and Relights Our Future\"},\"digest\":\"luR4Llq9W2YkRzZyi18kIZBycBZtQv012LZbpfFCBo8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4F1729602808AC6395F820B52d991Dc78Af944e3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"TqkFYw2EsgFbrxM4txvhLc44VLD9PTzE_GTjq-8952A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YKXRMXQAbXic4Ibi7Dkv2nP4kiesgsWnm8iVgRU2Zqg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"iRseL7UFE-_n0tJCglkBvzKcWufn3VScwaQE50oEhLRLi1aP3buj0x9cxemldU0mKYYb2mBcxvmw3mthwgYHGA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd02aaf8fbc8489cc1a6b71357b5d8c6c0c1967f902adad8de0d9d313a0a165813648a122ebc200575584a8e460e7a7c02ba483737ec78edb381443bc25b3d73301\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"TqkFYw2EsgFbrxM4txvhLc44VLD9PTzE_GTjq-8952A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YKXRMXQAbXic4Ibi7Dkv2nP4kiesgsWnm8iVgRU2Zqg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"luR4Llq9W2YkRzZyi18kIZBycBZtQv012LZbpfFCBo8\"}"
