"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"A browser designed to help creators create. But how would a browser do that? Surely, Iâ€™m not suggesting that Opera created their own functionalities similar to Figma, Canva and other web-based creator functionality... of course not!\\nIâ€™m talking about helping creators in a different way. Iâ€™m talking about creating core functionalities that allows creators to find inspiration. Iâ€™m talking about helping them earlier in their creation process.Iâ€™m talking about a **vehicle to navigate and use inspiration.**\\n\\n\\\\[ðŸ”’ Deep dive on [Opera GX](https://www.notion.so/Opera-GX-ece727ceebf94f1ba91a3a8960b0a870)\\\\]\\n\\nSimilarly to OperaGX, Opera.Rocket will leverage the foundation of the core Opera experience and enhance it with functionality specific to creators.\\n\\nLetâ€™s dive into why this makes sense and what this could look like.\\n\\n**Why now:**\\n\\nThe Creator Economy - Tapping into the wave of upcoming creators that will utilise progressive software & hardware to help them create unique assets, goods and experiences that their community will enjoy.\\nKnowledge Management - My view right now is that our ability to create, manage and store knowledge is at the cusp of disruption. In terms of impact, I think it will be on the same magnitude as the internet.\\n(This is something Iâ€™m looking to explore further in my writing.)\\n\\n**Recap on creator economy:**\\n\\nThe creator economy refers to the fact that increasingly people who are able to create and provide a unique good or service can earn a form of income comparable and sometimes even more than a normal corporate job. The creator can create anything ranging from music, arts and craft, knowledge, merchandise - anything of distinct value that someone else is willing to pay for.\\n\\n**\\\\[Read more ðŸ”’ [Creator Economy](https://www.notion.so/Creator-Economy-e204180d3c6b425aade93c7b7a3c844c)\\\\]**\\n\\n**[Explosion of NFTs, Web3](https://www.notion.so/Explosion-of-NFTs-Web3-350aaccb7c534104b22f867d8acf6ee2)**\\n\\n> The experience at the intersection of apps is a real battleground. Creating seamless experiences that transcend your own software will increasingly become a differentiator for software & apps, especially if their main purpose is primarily functional and there are more value-adding services downstream.\\n\\n**Recap on Unbundling vs bundling**\\n\\nItâ€™s easy to see the dominance of a few companies in their respective domains as software goes through the wave of convergence.\\n\\nWith the likes of:\\n\\n* GCP, Azure & AWS owning the cloud space\\n* JIRA, Trello, Asana, Airtable & Monday owning the Project Management space\\n\\nBut at the same time, a lot of these companies have the smart thing of creating a marketplace for plugins. What that allows them to do is essentially outsource a lot of the heavy lifting for key uses cases outside of their target demographic. Software has indeed eaten / taken over the world, and as people become increasingly more comfortable with software and their respective functionalities, they start demanding more.\\n\\nAs humans, we crave progression, itâ€™s what has allowed to build skyscrapers, reach the moon, travel through continents - we have the distinct ability to envision something - and realise it. The other side of that coin is that our default baseline of expectations continually increases, as our experiences with frontier leading companies bleeds into our expectations for other applications and software.\\n\\n### **Target Audience:**\\n\\nCreators that want to be Productive with their iPad (and potentially find themselves with a laptop replacement)\\n\\n### **Macro Jobs - A primer of JTBD**\\n\\n<aside>\\nðŸ’¡  *\\\"Improve your life-situation; become more than you are\\\"*\\n\\nJob to be Done is the process a consumer goes through whenever she aims to change her existing life-situation into a preferred one, but cannot because there are constraints that stop her.\\n\\n</aside>\\n\\n### **Understanding the Marco Job for Creators**\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/F6SPB2ca7Sbu3H5sh5KIB.png?height=1640&width=2360)\\n\\n\\\\[ðŸ”’Breaking down macro jobs using JobCards\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[ðŸ”’Understanding the abstraction of job to solve\\\\]\\n\\n### Features worth building\\n\\n**Moat & Monetisation Feature:**\\n\\nInstead of the GX Corner, design a Productivity Studio, a suite of carefully curated apps that you believe can truly help them become a better creator.\\n\\nThis builds on the idea opinionated software\\n\\n[Make Opinionated Software](https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/04.6-make-opinionated-software)\\n\\nHelp your customers become more productive by creating opinionated software stacks.\\nBest set of workflows (and apps) for -\\n\\n* Storing knowledge\\n  Drawing\\n  Creating mood boards\\n\\nMake this a highly searchable and customisable experience\\n\\n**And it all starts with Opera.Rocket**\\n\\n**Painpoint Feature:**\\n\\nNo keyboard shortcuts - How can I quickly navigate through to where I want to be.\\n\\nAdditional Features to consider:\\n\\nItâ€™s an iPad, so there needs to be a consideration for keyboard shortcuts & pen input.\\n\\n**Moat & API Focus Feature**\\n\\nCreate opera relevant integrations for creators.
