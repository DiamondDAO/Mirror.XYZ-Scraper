"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Since I go to high school, I am so excited about English class, because we have a foreign teacher, whose name is Paul. Paul likes to share funny things about how foreigners think about China. The way he talks makes us laugh out loudly. I learn that a lot of foreigners misunderstand our culture. Before they come to China, all they learn about this big country is from media. The media always report the negative sides, such as woman has low status, and Chinese people eat all kinds of animals. When they come to China, what they see is very different. This country is not that poor and people here are very friendly. Foreign people misunderstand our culture, and this situation happens all the time. Of course, we also will misread their culture. It is important to have real communication, so as to get further understanding.\",\"timestamp\":1639129113,\"title\":\"The Misunderstanding In Culture\"},\"digest\":\"We8snFx24iK8zV7Ht0OJcjhRPfQLZEkwRIJfZSKTM_U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xBF70b4C0250DEbF3C3Ee1cAb3FAAa2dd011b0bAd\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0PtAu43UzZwYIT7DWOpncKxC3yettnmRZAr1KZ4HTSc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eGrfBaUGp537eTfIN-DwZwjH6OfHITavlgwIjZyxElU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"lCiJ1VsKbhfEeva2c1oe4VIGWKVh0C4OGZJboDI-qnGMf4RucEsoPbkYXTCAXP3bboeylLXGTGrqpzEERsS1Cg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x42d5af95f8a38448604d3e7505a5f35862eb5f9c57224c52ed7b4c753f61a1c81004ab8bb69999f4e89556b75a2505b58a611262d42ea8a3761ad9a7238d4ae91c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0PtAu43UzZwYIT7DWOpncKxC3yettnmRZAr1KZ4HTSc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eGrfBaUGp537eTfIN-DwZwjH6OfHITavlgwIjZyxElU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"We8snFx24iK8zV7Ht0OJcjhRPfQLZEkwRIJfZSKTM_U\"}"
