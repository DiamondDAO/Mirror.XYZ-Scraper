Artificial Intelligence (AI)\\n\\n![from \\\\*‘A.I. Artificial Intelligence’, directed by Steven Spielberg, 2001 CE, ‘fair use’ assertion \\\\*\\\\[1\\\\]](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*CYDZG49p0lwNrHfLmuRpBA.jpeg?&size=medium)\\n\\nRay Kurzweil famously described the coming age of super-intelligence as the ‘Singularity’ , based on the cosmological concept of the Big Bang (a zero-dimensional concept where space and time begins). He expects humans to merge with digital intelligence to become the super-intelligence[\\\\[2\\\\]](#_ftn2) — a theme being explored by Elon Musk with his[ Neuralink](https://neuralink.com/) project. However, if we are not careful, artificial intelligence (AI) may emerge before we are ready to deal with it.\\n\\n*One might also ask: if it was already here, would we definitely know that?*\\n\\nNick Bostrom has been a consistent philosophical and ethical thinker in respect of the potential impact of artificial intelligence and super-intelligence on humans. He essentially asks how we should structure our ethical thinking about such developments to ensure AI is developed safely and that our ethics are adapted as needed for those new conditions.\\n\\nIn his recent draft paper with Carl Shulman, “[Sharing the World with Digital Minds](https://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/monster.pdf)”, Bostrom returns to the fertile ground he explored in papers such as “[The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/artificial-intelligence.pdf)” and in his book *[Superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence)*. His paper, with Shulman, is primarily an exploration of the moral conundrum posed by the concept of a ‘[Utility Monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_monster)’.\\n\\nFirst, let us consider a simple thought experiment from Bostrom.\\n\\nAn AI built without any compensating mechanisms, such as having value for human life, can give rise to some disturbing consequences — such as a powerful AI paper-clip-maximiser, tasked with making paper clips, that decides to turn the future (and us) into a factory for paper clip components.\\n\\n**“Suppose we have an AI whose only goal is to make as many paper clips as possible. The AI will realize quickly that it would be much better if there were no humans because humans might decide to switch it off. Because if humans do so, there would be fewer paper clips. Also, human bodies contain a lot of atoms that could be made into paper clips. The future that the AI would be trying to gear towards would be one in which there were a lot of paper clips but no humans.”**\\n\\n(*Nick Bostrom*)[\\\\[3\\\\]](#_ftn3)\\n\\nThe ‘Utility Monster’ takes this conceptual thought-experiment further. Before deeper consideration of the ethical issues involved, let us take a look at how science fiction (sci-fi) has set the scene.\\n\\nOur wider culture informs all of our assumptions, discussions and thinking about how AI might impact humanity, for better or worse.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n## 7.1. Sci-Fi Speculation on AI\\n\\n**“the future is already here, it’s just not very evenly distributed”**\\n\\n(*William Gibson*)[\\\\[4\\\\]](#_ftn4)\\n\\n‘Hard sci-fi’ and advanced science have always had a healthy relationship. Sometimes this interaction has helped drive ideas about the future of advanced science (including AI and space travel). This is partly due to the influence of Isaac Asimov as a founding father of modern sci-fi. It is helpful to consider a number of different literary treatments of AI, as they have set the scene for much of our cultural hopes and fears.\\n\\n![“I, Robot”\\\\[5\\\\]](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*_W_ePKfuESDbS9U92LWuzA.png)\\n\\nThe film “I, Robot”***[\\\\[5\\\\]](#_ftn5)*** features a situation which highlights the ethical issues involved in AI in real life, and the amount of insight required to determine ‘good’ from ‘poor’ conduct. A robot saves an adult detective and leaves a child to drown in a car that is sinking under water.[\\\\[6\\\\]](#_ftn6) In the story, the detective is angry at the robot for making a rational choice that lacks ‘heart’ and wisdom.\\n\\nThe detective eventually befriends another robot, ‘Sonny’, who shows him that robots can evolve into wiser beings. The audience is shown that Sonny is unusual in being a new type of sapient robot; this is made clear when Sonny, demonstrating insight and reflection, refuses to follow rules or orders that lack compassion or unnecessarily curtail freedoms for humans.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n## i. Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein\\n\\n**“How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery!”**\\n\\n(*Mary Shelley*)[\\\\[7\\\\]](#_ftn7)\\n\\nPrometheus was a Greek god, a giant who apparently gave humanity the gift of fire. For this he was punished by Zeus, who ensured that he was chained to a rock, where an eagle ate his liver every day. Every night his liver would grow back, and his punishment resumed the next morning.\\n\\nIn some tellings, Prometheus created humans from clay, whereas in others he decided to help humans in their struggle for survival. The fascinating stories of Prometheus will likely live as long as humans do.\\n\\nIt is in his role as the creator of life from clay that Prometheus is most relevant to Shelley’s story of Victor Frankenstein (earning him a reference in the official longer book title).\\n\\n![Peter Paul Rubens, “Prometheus Bound”, 1611–1612 CE, Wikipedia, public domain.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*z64tWtcfXkAyZVGYuzu6iw.jpeg?&size=medium)\\n\\nPrometheus’ suffering for the gift of science and life are also echoed in Frankenstein’s misery at the results of his own creation.\\n\\n**“Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these reflections, I thought, that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.”**[\\\\[8\\\\]](#_ftn8)\\n\\nThe story of Frankenstein’s monster is interestingly fractal, since both the human scientist and his monster represent a form of challenge against their own creator mythos. Shelley’s *Frankenstein* has had a major impact on our culture, and particularly our science-fiction. That is not surprising given how well she tapped into our deeper archetypes of science, creation, sacrifice, suffering and the inability to know the consequences of our actions (ironically, the name Prometheus apparently meant ‘forethought’).\\n\\n**“From women’s eyes this doctrine I derive: They are the ground, the books, the academes From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire.”**\\n\\n(*William Shakespeare*)[\\\\[9\\\\]](#_ftn9)\\n\\nIn *Frankenstein*, the monster created by the scientist Victor is ultimately despised for his hideousness — so he exacts his revenge in a murderous spree after his creator abandons him.\\n\\n**“At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection, which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came running into the recess I had chosen with all the sportiveness of infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me, that this little creature was unprejudiced, and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him, and educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth.”**\\n\\n(*Mary Shelley*)\\n\\nUpon seeing him, Victor’s younger brother William screams at the monster’s hideous looks; when the monster discovers the boy is related to Victor, his rage is boundless, and he strangles the boy in a frenzy.\\n\\nDespite all of this bloodshed and violence, Frankenstein’s monster inspires sympathy from the outset: in his loneliness and in his lack of free will in choosing to be born, as well as in how humans naturally react to him.\\n\\n**“‘Hateful day when I received life!’ I exclaimed in agony. ‘Cursed creator! Why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust? God in pity made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid from its very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow-devils, to admire and encourage him; but I am solitary and detested.’”**\\n\\nFrankenstein, hearing the monster’s pleas and threats, eventually agrees to create a female companion for him.\\n\\n**“You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life? Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind. I… but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.”**\\n\\nHowever, the enmity between the two is too great and Victor can not forgive the death of a servant (wrongly accused of William’s murder) and the murder of William. Victor abandons plans to create a female partner for the monster, destroying his work in progress. In fury, the monster kills Victor’s bride Elizabeth. \\n\\nThe story ends with Victor dying of exhaustion and exposure in the cold Arctic, where he has been chasing the monster, still regretting that his monster (and sworn enemy) remains alive. The monster, full of regret for his sins, departs, possibly with thoughts of suicide.\\n\\n**“‘But soon,’ he cried, with sad and solemn enthusiasm, ‘I shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning miseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly, and exult in the agony of the torturing flames … My spirit will sleep in peace; or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus. Farewell.’ He sprung from the cabin-window, as he said this, upon the ice-raft which lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves, and lost in darkness and distance.”**\\n\\nIn this story, the genesis of which arose during a storm whilst on holiday with friends, Shelley manages to bring to life with sympathy and compassion the idea of a scorned human-willed creation.\\n\\n**“Mary wanted to write a story, too, but she couldn’t land on a subject. ‘I was asked each morning, and each morning I was forced to reply with a mortifying negative,’ she later wrote. But one sleepless night, as thunder and lightning echoed off the lake, she had a vision. ‘I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out,’ she wrote, ‘and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life.’”**\\n\\n(*Erin Blakemore*)[\\\\[10\\\\]](#_ftn10)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n## ii. Isaac Asimov’s “Foundation” Series\\n\\n![Adrian Cabedo, “Mister Lister”, c. 2014 CE.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*KIgsU31SjludnFh3r3J8gw.png)\\n\\n**“one of the stock plots of science fiction … robots were created and destroyed their creator. Knowledge has its dangers, yes, but is the response to be a retreat from knowledge? Or is knowledge to be used as itself a barrier to the dangers it brings?”**\\n\\n(*Isaac Asimov*)[\\\\[11\\\\]](#_ftn11)\\n\\nIsaac Asimov’s impact on the popularity and themes of sci-fi that followed his books would be hard to overstate. In addition to sci-fi, he also wrote many non-fiction books on science, literature, religion and history.[\\\\[12\\\\]](#_ftn12) He was a polymath (of wide-ranging knowledge), so much so that he was once asked by Kurt Vonnegut “how it feels to know everything”.[\\\\[13\\\\]](#_ftn13) He published a book on entropy, energy and life[\\\\[14\\\\]](#_ftn14) and even wrote a seminal short sci-fi story[\\\\[15\\\\]](#_ftn15) dealing with the subject.\\n\\nHere, we are most interested in his impact on the development of concepts related to the ethics of AI, as contained in a number of his stories. Asimov invented the concept of the ‘Laws of Robotics’, which, though fictional and so not necessarily intended as actual scientific laws, have had a deep impact on the development of the ethics of AI.\\n\\nThe laws were first given in a short story, published during World War II,[\\\\[16\\\\]](#_ftn16) in which a mining robot[\\\\[17\\\\]](#_ftn17) on Mercury is assigned a task which causes an unexpected conflict due to the interaction of three laws.\\n\\n**1. A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.**\\n\\n**2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.**\\n\\n**3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.**\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nIn the story, the conflict between these laws gives rise to an unexpected potential infinite loop for the robot, ‘Speedy’. This is a variation of the famous computer program ‘halting problem’ that is easier to understand (for lay people like me) — a well-known and fundamental issue in computing and mathematics we have previously considered.\\n\\nAsimov also believed this was the first time that the word ‘robotics’ had ever been used.[\\\\[18\\\\]](#_ftn18) The laws are Asimov’s response to humanity’s “Frankenstein complex”.\\n\\n**“‘You see how it works, don’t you? There’s some sort of danger centering at the selenium pool. It increases as he approaches, and at a certain distance from it the Rule 3 potential, unusually high to start with, exactly balances the Rule 2 potential, unusually low to start with.’ Donovan rose to his feet in excitement. ‘And it strikes an equilibrium. I see. Rule 3 drives him back and Rule 2 drives him forward –’ ‘So he follows a circle around the selenium pool, staying on the locus of all points of potential equilibrium…he’ll stay on that circle forever, giving us the good old runaround.’”**\\n\\n(*Isaac Asimov*, “[Runaround](https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/sjmiller/public_html/105Sp10/handouts/Runaround.html)”, 1942 CE.)\\n\\nAs a young reader (aged 13 or so), in addition to a fascination with the laws, I remember how much I enjoyed the character of Daneel, the first humanoid robot, who becomes involved in helping a human detective (Elija Baley) solve crimes.[\\\\[19\\\\]](#_ftn19) Baley is initially sceptical about Daneel and believes he may be the murderer in an early case — questioning whether he is really a robot and whether, if he is, he has been programmed with the *Laws of Robotics*. Their lives are thereafter intertwined in a number of stories. Thousands of years later, long after Baley’s death, Daneel still honours his memory.\\n\\nAt the end of Baley’s life he provides Daneel with comfort, asking Daneel to leave him to die in peace given that the laws mean Daneel will suffer watching Baley die whilst being unable to help him. Baley’s last words of comfort are about humanity.\\n\\n**“‘The work of each individual contributes to a totality, and so becomes an undying part of the totality. That totality of human lives — past and present and to come — forms a tapestry that has been in existence now for many tens of thousands of years and has been growing more elaborate and, on the whole, more beautiful in all that time … An individual life is one thread in the tapestry and what is one thread compared to the whole? Daneel, keep your mind fixed firmly on the tapestry and do not let the trailing off of a single thread affect you.’”**[\\\\[20\\\\]](#_ftn20)\\n\\nBaley’s words later inspire Daneel in his own creation of the new prime ‘zeroth law’ for robots, with priority above the three laws.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n**0. A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.**\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nIn the ethical framework proposed in Part II of this book, as a mark of respect to the power and influence of Asimov’s work and to the simplicity of the *Laws of Robotics*, I have used the format of Asimov’s laws in creating the proposed *Prime Laws for Sapients*.\\n\\n![detail from Simon Vouet, “Aenas and Anchises fleeing Troy”, 1635 CE, CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication.\\\\[21\\\\]](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*PCsOFryQTNWlqz7He2I6_A.png)\\n\\n![Seamus Heaney \\\\[21\\\\]](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\\\*kxpB6qgQemEpH_qEwU1-gQ.png?&size=medium)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\ncontinued in:\\n\\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x6e2fBc139e37b43f4F29cC10B7BeDe36587f7306/svY9ffcBWEO-6pu_Ob05W5qNYJEZMhURYdjHE6yX99M](https://mirror.xyz/0x6e2fBc139e37b43f4F29cC10B7BeDe36587f7306/svY9ffcBWEO-6pu_Ob05W5qNYJEZMhURYdjHE6yX99M)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n[\\\\[1\\\\]](#_ftnref1) Image: from *‘A.I.
