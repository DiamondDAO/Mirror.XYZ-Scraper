"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"To learn to be a boss, you can learn how the founding emperor in ancient times did it, and learn how the generals did it. The shopping mall is like a battlefield.\\n\\nWhen Emperor Song Taizu Zhao Kuangyin first rebelled, the army surrounded the palace and asked the gatekeepers in the palace to open the door and surrender. The gatekeepers of Chenqiao refused to let Zhao Kuangyin enter. So when Zhao Kuangyin arrived at the Qiu Gate, the gatekeeper saw that Zhao Kuangyin had rebelled, so he acted as a favor, opened the door and let Zhao Kuangyin come in. Zhao Kuangyin became the emperor, and then called the gatekeepers of these two gates. Killed the gatekeeper who helped him open the door, and rewarded the official position to the gatekeeper of Chen Qiao.\\n\\nThis is called the distinction between rewards and punishments. As bosses, we should reward people who respect the rules of the company and those who are good for the entire company, not people who act according to their own personal interests. As a boss, you must pay special attention to staying away from these villains.\\n\\nOne more thing, during the Yuan Dynasty, there was a general named He Zhen in Guangdong who arrested the rebellious Wang Cheng. This Wang Cheng made his own camp very tall and thick. He Zhen besieged for a long time but couldn't get in. He offered a reward of 1W, saying who captured Wang Cheng and rewarded him with a reward of 10,000. As a result, Wang Cheng's attendants tied Wang Cheng out.\\n\\nAfter seeing Wang Cheng, He Zhen smiled and said, how did you raise a white-eyed wolf! Wang Cheng was ashamed. The attendant who tied Wang Cheng asked He Zhen to reward him. He Zhenru counted him, and then sent someone to cook a big pot of soup. Wang Cheng was very scared, thinking he was going to cook himself. As a result, He Zhen asked his subordinates to take the waiter\\n\\nEntrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs 189\\n\\nFrom tied up, thrown into the pot and boiled. Then announced loudly, if there is a servant who binds the master,\\n\\nDispose of it in this way.\\n\\nThis really achieved a clear distinction between rewards and punishments. What you have promised must be done. But can't do it\\n\\nThe bad guy has a good end. Everyone must respect the corporate rules and regulations.\\n\\nThis is the reward and punishment that our boss should do.\",\"timestamp\":1634801031,\"title\":\"The boss must be rewarded and punished clearly\"},\"digest\":\"Uv2I8McEHMyTjmU9mDpoU_sPlppO5MgA3u9PUTlhG8w\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"eNR7GtLZVXUNurmHiZ7ps_MXpNl7gO2oRMYVionrQ9xiivLdPkRAihBAFs9PuaalwM04xlwuIU7Hz0H3rmQUWg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Uv2I8McEHMyTjmU9mDpoU_sPlppO5MgA3u9PUTlhG8w\"}"
