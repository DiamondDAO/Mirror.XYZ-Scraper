These rays of light illuminate the forest undergrowth which is otherwise difficult to see. Inspired by this sentiment, the Komorebi Collective aims to illuminate and elevate a group of otherwise underestimated visionary founders building in crypto. \\n\\n## Our Collective \\nWe’ve been participating in the crypto ecosystem as builders, investors and community shepherds. We’re proud to take the next step in ensuring a more diverse future of crypto builders and beneficiaries around the world.\\n\\nOur core team consists of members from [she256](http://she256.org/), a 501c3 nonprofit dedicated to increasing diversity and breaking down barriers to entry in the blockchain space, as well as [Women in Blockchain](https://blockchaingirls.org/), an organization focused on increasing diversity through education and community building. \\n\\nStructurally, Komorebi runs as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) on the [Syndicate Protocol](https://twitter.com/SyndicateDAO).\\n\\n## Why Now?\\nInvesting in women and non-binary folks isn’t just a necessity, **it’s financially sound**. Teams with at least one female founder [exit faster](https://files.pitchbook.com/website/files/pdf/PitchBook_All_Raise_2019_All_In_Women_in_the_VC_Ecosystem.pdf) (6.9 years compared to 7.4 years for all-male teams). According to [First Round](http://10years.firstround.com/), companies with a female founder performed 63% better than their investments with all-male founding teams. \\n\\nAnd yet, last year, **women-led startups received only [2.3%](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-to-female-founders/) of venture funding**. In addition, [65%](https://allraise-data-dashboard.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/center/html/index.html) of venture funds still have NO female checkwriters. These two stats are very much related; female VCs are [2x](https://www.kauffmanfellows.org/journal_posts/women-vcs-invest-in-up-to-2x-more-female-founders) more likely to fund a female founder than male VCs.\\n\\nKomorebi plans on addressing both of these issues head on. We refuse to let broader tech and venture’s shortcomings trickle into crypto. With crypto growing faster than ever, a recent [research survey](https://blockchaingirls.org/global-research-report) of women around the world by Women in Blockchain highlighted that 36% of respondents were interested in the underlying technology, 14% saw crypto as a means to improving their financial independence and a resounding 80% prefer to be paid in crypto. We now have the unique opportunity to set the course of the space — we aim to redefine funding and founding in web3.\\n\\n## Meet the members\\n\\n### Core:\\n\\n- Eva Wu, she256, Mechanism Capital\\n- Kristie Huang, she256, Pantera Capital\\n- Medha Kothari, she256, Celo\\n- Manasi Vora, Women in Blockchain, Skynet\\n- Kinjal Shah, Blockchain Capital\\n\\n### Members:\\n\\n- Kleiner Perkins\\n- Mechanism Capital\\n- Dragonfly Capital \\n- IDEO CoLab Ventures\\n- Stacks Accelerator\\n- Dovey Wan, Founding Partner at Primitive Ventures \\n- Justine Humenansky, Investor at Playground Global\\n- Maria Shen, Investor at Electric Capital\\n- Vanessa Slavich, Partner at Celo Foundation\\n- Tess Rinearson, VP Engineering at Interchain GmbH, Tendermint\\n- Isabelle Wei, Engineer at Valora\\n- Mimi Idada, Head of Open Web Collective, Mentorship Lead at she256\\n- Joyce Yang, Investor at Globalcoin Ventures\\n- Leigh Cuen, Journalist\\n- Alexis Gauba, Co-founder of Opyn, Co-Founder of she256\\n- Amy Jung, Head of Community at MakerDAO\\n- Maggie Love, Founder of W3bcloud, Founder of SheFi \\n- Andrea Lo, Sr Director of Investments at Stellar Development Foundation \\n- Fulvia Morales, Product at 0x, Investor at FreeCompany\\n- Stani Kulechov, Founder of Aave\\n- Robert Leshner, Co-founder of Compound\\n- Ian Lee, MD at IDEO CoLab Ventures, Co-founder of Syndicate\\n- Jesse Pollak, Head of Engineering for Consumer Products at Coinbase\\n- Daryl Lau, Principal at Mechanism Capital\\n- Vivek Singh, Co-founder of Gitcoin\\n- Hamdi Allam, Engineer at Twitter, Co-founder of FourthState\\n- Marc Weinstein, Portfolio Development at Mechanism Capital\\n- Connor McEwen, Engineering Lead at Celo Labs\\n- Benjamin Simon, Research at Mechanism Capital\\n- David Vorick, Founder of Skynet Labs\\n- Jesse Walden, Founder of Variant Fund\\n\\n## Starting a Crypto Company?\\nIf you’re interested in learning more, please reach out!.
