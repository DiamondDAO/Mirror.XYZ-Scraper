"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"By this time Mr. and Mrs. Billings, having between them lighted the lamp, stirred up the coal in the grate, closed the doors, and taken possession of comfortable chairs, the latter proclaimed--\\n\\n\\\"The Chapter (isn't that what you call it?) will now be held!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Was it in '43 when you left home, Ned?\\\" asked Mr. B.\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, the A. C. culminated in '45.  You remember something of the society of Norridgeport, the last winter you were there?  Abel Mallory, for instance?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let me think a moment,\\\" said Mr. Johnson reflectively.  \\\"Really, it seems like looking back a hundred years.  Mallory--wasn't that the sentimental young man, with wispy hair, a tallowy skin, and big, sweaty hands, who used to be spouting Carlyle on the `reading evenings' at Shelldrake's?  Yes, to be sure; and there was Hollins, with his clerical face and infidel talk,--and Pauline Ringtop, who used to say, `The Beautiful is the Good.'  I can still hear her shrill voice, singing, \\\\`Would that *I* were beautiful, would that *I* were fair!'\\\"\\n\\nThere was a hearty chorus of laughter at poor Miss Ringtop's expense.  It harmed no one, however; for the tar-weed was already thick over her Californian grave.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I see,\\\" said Mr. Billings, \\\"you still remember the absurdities of those days.  In fact, I think you partially saw through them then.  But I was younger, and far from being so clear-headed, and I looked upon those evenings at Shelldrake's as being equal, at least, to the symposia of Plato.  Something in Mallory always repelled me.  I detested the sight of his thick nose, with the flaring nostrils, and his coarse, half-formed lips, of the bluish color of raw corned-beef.  But I looked upon these feelings as unreasonable prejudices, and strove to conquer them, seeing the admiration which he received from others.  He was an oracle on the subject of \\\\`Nature.'  Having eaten nothing for two years, except Graham bread, vegetables without salt, and fruits, fresh or dried, he considered himself to have attained an antediluvian purity of health--or that he would attain it, so soon as two pimples on his left temple should have healed.  These pimples he looked upon as the last feeble stand made by the pernicious juices left from the meat he had formerly eaten and the coffee he had drunk.  His theory was, that through a body so purged and purified none but true and natural impulses could find access to the soul.  Such, indeed, was the theory we all held.  A Return to Nature was the near Millennium, the dawn of which we already beheld in the sky.  To be sure there was a difference in our individual views as to how this should be achieved, but we were all agreed as to what the result should be.\\n\\n\\\"I can laugh over those days now, Ned; but they were really happy while they lasted.  We were the salt of the earth; we were lifted above those grovelling instincts which we saw manifested in the lives of others.  Each contributed his share of gas to inflate the painted balloon to which we all clung, in the expectation that it would presently soar with us to the stars.  But it only went up over the out-houses, dodged backwards and forwards two or three times, and finally flopped down with us into a swamp.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And that balloon was the A. C.?\\\" suggested Mr. Johnson.\\n\\n\\\"As President of this Chapter, I prohibit questions,\\\" said Eunice.  \\\"And, Enos, don't send up your balloon until the proper time.  Don't anticipate the programme, or the performance will be spoiled.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I had almost forgotten that Ned is so much in the dark,\\\" her obedient husband answered.  \\\"You can have but a slight notion,\\\" he continued, turning to his friend, \\\"of the extent to which this sentimental, or transcendental, element in the little circle at Shelldrake's increased after you left Norridgeport.  We read the `Dial,' and Emerson; we believed in Alcott as the `purple Plato' of modern times; we took psychological works out of the library, and would listen for hours to Hollins while he read Schelling or Fichte, and then go home with a misty impression of having imbibed infinite wisdom.  It was, perhaps, a natural, though very eccentric rebound from the hard, practical, unimaginative New-England mind which surrounded us; yet I look back upon it with a kind of wonder.\\n\\nI was then, as you know, unformed mentally, and might have been so still, but for the experiences of the A. C.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Johnson shifted his position, a little impatiently.  Eunice looked at him with laughing eyes, and shook her finger with a mock threat.\\n\\n\\\"Shelldrake,\\\" continued Mr. Billings, without noticing this by- play, \\\"was a man of more pretence than real cultivation, as I afterwards discovered.  He was in good circumstances, and always glad to receive us at his house, as this made him, virtually, the chief of our tribe, and the outlay for refreshments involved only the apples from his own orchard and water from his well.  There was an entire absence of conventionality at our meetings, and this, conpared with the somewhat stiff society of the village, was really an attraction.  There was a mystic bond of union in our ideas: we discussed life, love, religion, and the future state, not only with the utmost candor, but with a warmth of feeling which, in many of us, was genuine.  Even I (and you know how painfully shy and bashful I was) felt myself more at home there than in my father's house; and if I didn't talk much, I had a pleasant feeling of being in harmony with those who did.\\n\\n\\\"Well, 'twas in the early part of '45--I think in April,--when we were all gathered together, discussing, as usual, the possibility of leading a life in accordance with Nature.  Abel Mallory was there, and Hollins, and Miss Ringtop, and Faith Levis, with her knitting,--and also Eunice Hazleton, a lady whom you have never seen, but you may take my wife at her representative--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Stick to the programme, Enos,\\\" interrupted Mrs. Billings.\\n\\n\\\"Eunice Hazleton, then.  I wish I could recollect some of the speeches made on that occasion.  Abel had but one pimple on his temple (there was a purple spot where the other had been), and was estimating that in two or three months more he would be a true, unspoiled man.  His complexion, nevertheless, was more clammy and whey-like than ever.\\n\\n\\\"`Yes,' said he, `I also am an Arcadian!  This false dual existence which I have been leading will soon be merged in the unity of Nature.  Our lives must conform to her sacred law.  Why can't we strip off these hollow Shams,' (he made great use of that word,) \\\\`and be our true selves, pure, perfect, and divine?'\\n\\n\\\"Miss Ringtop heaved a sigh, and repeated a stanza from her favorite poet:\\n\\n```\\n    \\\"`Ah, when wrecked are my desires             On the everlasting Never,          And my heart with all its fires             Out forever,          In the cradle of Creation          Finds the soul resuscitation!\\n```\\n\\n\\\"Shelldrake, however, turning to his wife, said--\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Elviry, how many up-stairs rooms is there in that house down on the Sound?'\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Four,--besides three small ones under the roof.  Why, what made you think of that, Jesse?' said she.\\n\\n\\\"`I've got an idea, while Abel's been talking,' he answered.  `We've taken a house for the summer, down the other side of Bridgeport, right on the water, where there's good fishing and a fine view of the Sound.  Now, there's room enough for all of us--at least all that can make it suit to go.  Abel, you and Enos, and Pauline and Eunice might fix matters so that we could all take the place in partnership, and pass the summer together, living a true and beautiful life in the bosom of Nature.  There we shall be perfectly free and untrammelled by the chains which still hang around us in Norridgeport.  You know how often we have wanted to be set on some island in the Pacific Ocean, where we could build up a true society, right from the start.  Now, here's a chance to try the experiment for a few months, anyhow.'\\n\\n\\\"Eunice clapped her hands (yes, you did!) and cried out--\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Splendid!  Arcadian!  I'll give up my school for the summer.'\\n\\n\\\"Miss Ringtop gave her opinion in another quotation:\\n\\n```\\n    \\\"`The rainbow  hues of the Ideal          Condense to gems, and form the Real!'\\n```\\n\\n\\\"Abel Mallory, of course, did not need to have the proposal repeated.  He was ready for any thing which promised indulgence, and the indulgence of his sentimental tastes.  I will do the fellow the justice to say that he was not a hypocrite.  He firmly believed both in himself and his ideas--especially the former.  He pushed both hands through the long wisps of his drab-colored hair, and threw his head back until his wide nostrils resembled a double door to his brain.\\n\\n\\\"`Oh Nature!' he said, `you have found your lost children!  We shall obey your neglected laws! we shall hearken to your divine whispers I we shall bring you back from your ignominious exile, and place you on your ancestral throne!'\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Let us do it!' was the general cry.\\n\\n\\\"A sudden enthusiasm fired us, and we grasped each other's hands in the hearty impulse of the moment.  My own private intention to make a summer trip to the White Mountains had been relinquished the moment I heard Eunice give in her adhesion.  I may as well confess, at once, that I was desperately in love, and afraid to speak to her.\\n\\n\\\"By the time Mrs. Sheldrake brought in the apples and water we were discussing the plan as a settled thing.  Hollins had an engagement to deliver Temperance lectures in Ohio during the summer, but decided to postpone his departure until August, so that he might, at least, spend two months with us.  Faith Levis couldn't go--at which, I think, we were all secretly glad.  Some three or four others were in the same case, and the company was finally arranged to consist of the Shelldrakes, Hollins, Mallory, Eunice, Miss Ringtop, and myself.  We did not give much thought, either to the preparations in advance, or to our mode of life when settled there.  We were to live near to Nature: that was the main thing.\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`What shall we call the place?' asked Eunice.\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Arcadia!' said Abel Mallory, rolling up his large green eyes.\\n\\n\\\"`Then,' said Hollins, `let us constitute ourselves the Arcadian Club!'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Aha!\\\" interrupted Mr. Johnson, \\\"I see!  The A. C.!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, you can see the A. C. now,\\\" said Mrs. Billings; \\\"but to understand it fully, you should have had a share in those Arcadian experiences.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am all the more interested in hearing them described.  Go on, Enos.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The proposition was adopted.  We called ourselves The Arcadian Club; but in order to avoid gossip, and the usual ridicule, to which we were all more or less sensitive, in case our plan should become generally known, it was agreed that the initials only should be used.  Besides, there was an agreeable air of mystery about it: we thought of Delphi, and Eleusis, and Samothrace: we should discover that Truth which the dim eyes of worldly men and women were unable to see, and the day of disclosure would be the day of Triumph.  In one sense we were truly Arcadians: no suspicion of impropriety, I verily believe, entered any of our minds.  In our aspirations after what we called a truer life there was no material taint.  We were fools, if you choose, but as far as possible from being sinners.  Besides, the characters of Mr. and Mrs. Shelldrake, who naturally became the heads of our proposed community were sufficient to preserve us from slander or suspicion, if even our designs had been publicly announced.\\n\\n\\\"I won't bore you with an account of our preparations.  In fact, there was very little to be done.  Mr. Shelldrake succeeded in hiring the house, with most of its furniture, so that but a few articles had to be supplied.  My trunk contained more books than boots, more blank paper than linen.\\n\\n\\\"`Two shirts will be enough,' said Abel: `you can wash one of them any day, and dry it in the sun.'\\n\\n\\\"The supplies consisted mostly of flour, potatoes, and sugar.  There was a vegetable-garden in good condition, Mr. Shelldrake said, which would be our principal dependence.\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Besides, the clams!' I exclaimed unthinkingly.\\n\\n\\\"`Oh, yes!' said Eunice, `we can have chowder-parties: that will be delightful!'\\n\\n\\\"`Clams! chowder! oh, worse than flesh!' groaned Abel.  `Will you reverence Nature by outraging her first laws?'\\n\\n\\\"I had made a great mistake, and felt very foolish.  Eunice and I looked at each other, for the first time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Speak for yourself only, Enos,\\\" gently interpolated his wife.\\n\\n\\\"It was a lovely afternoon in the beginning of June when we first approached Arcadia.  We had taken two double teams at Bridgeport, and drove slowly forward to our destination, followed by a cart containing our trunks and a few household articles.  It was a bright, balmy day: the wheat-fields were rich and green, the clover showed faint streaks of ruby mist along slopes leaning southward, and the meadows were yellow with buttercups.  Now and then we caught glimpses of the Sound, and, far beyond it, the dim Long Island shore.  Every old white farmhouse, with its gray-walled garden, its clumps of lilacs, viburnums, and early roses, offered us a picture of pastoral simplicity and repose.  We passed them, one by one, in the happiest mood, enjoying the earth around us, the sky above, and ourselves most of all.\\n\\n\\\"The scenery, however, gradually became more rough and broken.  Knobs of gray gneiss, crowned by mournful cedars, intrenched upon the arable land, and the dark-blue gleam of water appeared through the trees.  Our road, which had been approaching the Sound, now skirted the head of a deep, irregular inlet, beyond which extended a beautiful promontory, thickly studded with cedars, and with scattering groups of elm, oak and maple trees.  Towards the end of the promontory stood a house, with white walls shining against the blue line of the Sound.\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`There is Arcadia, at last!' exclaimed Mr. Shelldrake.\\n\\n\\\"A general outcry of delight greeted the announcement.  And, indeed, the loveliness of the picture surpassed our most poetic anticipations.  The low sun was throwing exquisite lights across the point, painting the slopes of grass of golden green, and giving a pearly softness to the gray rocks.  In the back-ground was drawn the far-off water-line, over which a few specks of sail glimmered against the sky.  Miss Ringtop, who, with Eunice, Mallory, and myself, occupied one carriage, expressed her \\\\`gushing' feelings in the usual manner:\\n\\n```\\n    \\\"`Where the turf is softest, greenest,             Doth an angel thrust me on,--          Where the landscape lies serenest,             In the journey of the sun!'\\n```\\n\\n\\\"`Don't, Pauline!' said Eunice; `I never like to hear poetry flourished in the face of Nature.  This landscape surpasses any poem in the world.  Let us enjoy the best thing we have, rather than the next best.'\\n\\n\\\"`Ah, yes!' sighed Miss Ringtop, `'tis true!\\n\\n```\\n    \\\"`They sing to the ear; this sings to the eye!'\\n```\\n\\n\\\"Thenceforward, to the house, all was childish joy and jubilee.  All minor personal repugnances were smoothed over in the general exultation.  Even Abel Mallory became agreeable; and Hollins, sitting beside Mrs. Shelldrake on the back seat of the foremost carriage, shouted to us, in boyish lightness of heart.\\n\\n\\\"Passing the head of the inlet, we left the country-road, and entered, through a gate in the tottering stone wall, on our summer domain.  A track, open to the field on one side, led us past a clump of deciduous trees, between pastures broken by cedared knolls of rock, down the centre of the peninsula, to the house.  It was quite an old frame-building, two stories high, with a gambrel roof and tall chimneys.  Two slim Lombardy poplars and a broad- leaved catalpa shaded the southern side, and a kitchen-garden, divided in the centre by a double row of untrimmed currant-bushes, flanked it on the east.  For flowers, there were masses of blue flags and coarse tawny-red lilies, besides a huge trumpet-vine which swung its pendent arms from one of the gables.  In front of the house a natural lawn of mingled turf and rock sloped steeply down to the water, which was not more than two hundred yards distant.  To the west was another and broader inlet of the Sound, out of which our Arcadian promontory rose bluff and bold, crowned with a thick fringe of pines.  It was really a lovely spot which Shelldrake had chosen--so secluded, while almost surrounded by the winged and moving life of the Sound, so simple, so pastoral and home-like.  No one doubted the success of our experiment, for that evening at least.\\n\\n\\\"Perkins Brown, Shelldrake's boy-of-all-work, awaited us at the door.  He had been sent on two or three days in advance, to take charge of the house, and seemed to have had enough of hermit-life, for he hailed us with a wild whoop, throwing his straw hat half-way up one of the poplars.  Perkins was a boy of fifteen, the child of poor parents, who were satisfied to get him off their hands, regardless as to what humanitarian theories might be tested upon him.  As the Arcadian Club recognized no such thing as caste, he was always admitted to our meetings, and understood just enough of our conversation to excite a silly ambition in his slow mind.  His animal nature was predominant, and this led him to be deceitful.  At that time, however, we all looked upon him as a proper young Arcadian, and hoped that he would develop into a second Abel Mallory.\\n\\n\\\"After our effects had been deposited on the stoop, and the carriages had driven away, we proceeded to apportion the rooms, and take possession.  On the first floor there were three rooms, two of which would serve us as dining and drawing rooms, leaving the third for the Shelldrakes.  As neither Eunice and Miss Ringtop, nor Hollins and Abel showed any disposition to room together, I quietly gave up to them the four rooms in the second story, and installed myself in one of the attic chambers.  Here I could hear the music of the rain close above my head, and through the little gable window, as I lay in bed, watch the colors of the morning gradually steal over the distant shores.  The end was, we were all satisfied.\\n\\n\\\"`Now for our first meal in Arcadia!' was the next cry.  Mrs. Shelldrake, like a prudent housekeeper, marched off to the kitchen, where Perkins had already kindled a fire.  We looked in at the door, but thought it best to allow her undisputed sway in such a narrow realm.  Eunice was unpacking some loaves of bread and paper bags of crackers; and Miss Ringtop, smiling through her ropy curls, as much as to say, `You see, *I* also can perform the coarser tasks of life!' occupied herself with plates and cups.  We men, therefore, walked out to the garden, which we found in a promising condition.  The usual vegetables had been planted and were growing finely, for the season was yet scarcely warm enough for the weeds to make much headway.  Radishes, young onions, and lettuce formed our contribution to the table.  The Shelldrakes, I should explain, had not yet advanced to the antediluvian point, in diet: nor, indeed, had either Eunice or myself.  We acknowledged the fascination of tea, we saw a very mitigated evil in milk and butter, and we were conscious of stifled longings after the abomination of meat.  Only Mallory, Hollins, and Miss Ringtop had reached that loftiest round on the ladder of progress where the material nature loosens the last fetter of the spiritual.  They looked down upon us, and we meekly admitted their right to do so.\\n\\n\\\"Our board, that evening, was really tempting.  The absence of meat was compensated to us by the crisp and racy onions, and I craved only a little salt, which had been interdicted, as a most pernicious substance.  I sat at one corner of the table, beside Perkins Brown, who took an opportunity, while the others were engaged in conversation, to jog my elbow gently.  As I turned towards him, he said nothing, but dropped his eyes significantly.  The little rascal had the lid of a blacking-box, filled with salt, upon his knee, and was privately seasoning his onions and radishes.\\n\\nI blushed at the thought of my hypocrisy, but the onions were so much better that I couldn't help dipping into the lid with him.\\n\\n\\\"`Oh,' said Eunice, `we must send for some oil and vinegar!  This lettuce is very nice.'\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Oil and vinegar?' exclaimed Abel.\\n\\n\\\"`Why, yes,' said she, innocently: `they are both vegetable substances.'\\n\\n\\\"Abel at first looked rather foolish, but quickly recovering himself, said--\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`All vegetable substances are not proper for food: you would not taste the poison-oak, or sit under the upas-tree of Java.'\\n\\n\\\"`Well, Abel,' Eunice rejoined, `how are we to distinguish what is best for us?  How are we to know WHAT vegetables to choose, or what animal and mineral substances to avoid?'\\n\\n\\\"`I will tell you,' he answered, with a lofty air.  `See here!' pointing to his temple, where the second pimple--either from the change of air, or because, in the excitement of the last few days, he had forgotten it--was actually healed.  \\\\`My blood is at last pure.  The struggle between the natural and the unnatural is over, and I am beyond the depraved influences of my former taste.  My instincts are now, therefore, entirely pure also.  What is good for man to eat, that I shall have a natural desire to eat: what is bad will be naturally repelled.  How does the cow distinguish between the wholesome and the poisonous herbs of the meadow?  And is man less than a cow, that he cannot cultivate his instincts to an equal point?  Let me walk through the woods and I can tell you every berry and root which God designed for food, though I know not its name, and have never seen it before.  I shall make use of my time, during our sojourn here, to test, by my purified instinct, every substance, animal, mineral, and vegetable, upon which the human race subsists, and to create a catalogue of the True Food of Man!'\\n\\n\\\"Abel was eloquent on this theme, and he silenced not only Eunice, but the rest of us.  Indeed, as we were all half infected with the same delusions, it was not easy to answer his sophistries.\\n\\n\\\"After supper was over, the prospect of cleaning the dishes and putting things in order was not so agreeable; but Mrs. Shelldrake and Perkins undertook the work, and we did not think it necessary to interfere with them.  Half an hour afterwards, when the full moon had risen, we took our chairs upon the sloop, to enjoy the calm, silver night, the soft sea-air, and our summer's residence in anticipatory talk.\\n\\n\\\"`My friends,' said Hollins (and HIS hobby, as you may remember, Ned, was the organization of Society, rather than those reforms which apply directly to the Individual),--`my friends, I think we are sufficiently advanced in progressive ideas to establish our little Arcadian community upon what I consider the true basis: not Law, nor Custom, but the uncorrupted impulses of our nature.  What Abel said in regard to dietetic reform is true; but that alone will not regenerate the race.  We must rise superior to those conventional ideas of Duty whereby Life is warped and crippled.  Life must not be a prison, where each one must come and go, work, eat, and sleep, as the jailer commands.  Labor must not be a necessity, but a spontaneous joy.  'Tis true, but little labor is required of us here: let us, therefore, have no set tasks, no fixed rules, but each one work, rest, eat, sleep, talk or be silent, as his own nature prompts.'\\n\\n\\\"Perkins, sitting on the steps, gave a suppressed chuckle, which I think no one heard but myself.  I was vexed with his levity, but, nevertheless, gave him a warning nudge with my toe, in payment for the surreptitious salt.\\n\\n\\\"`That's just the notion I had, when I first talked of our coming here,' said Shelldrake.  `Here we're alone and unhindered; and if the plan shouldn't happen to work well (I don't see why it shouldn't though), no harm will be done.  I've had a deal of hard work in my life, and I've been badgered and bullied so much by your strait-laced professors, that I'm glad to get away from the world for a spell, and talk and do rationally, without being laughed at.'\\n\\n\\\"`Yes,' answered Hollins, `and if we succeed, as I feel we shall, for I think I know the hearts of all of us here, this may be the commencement of a new EEpoch for the world.  We may become the turning-point between two dispensations: behind us every thing false and unnatural, before us every thing true, beautiful, and good.'\\n\\n\\\"`Ah,' sighed Miss Ringtop, `it reminds me of Gamaliel J. Gawthrop's beautiful lines:\\n\\n```\\n    \\\"`Unrobed man is lying hoary             In the distance, gray and dead;          There no wreaths of godless glory             To his mist-like tresses wed,          And the foot-fall of the Ages             Reigns supreme, with noiseless tread.'\\n```\\n\\n\\\"`I am willing to try the experiment,' said I, on being appealed to by Hollins; `but don't you think we had better observe some kind of order, even in yielding every thing to impulse?  Shouldn't there be, at least, a platform, as the politicians call it--an agreement by which we shall all be bound, and which we can afterwards exhibit as the basis of our success?'\\n\\n\\\"He meditated a few moments, and then answered--\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`I think not.  It resembles too much the thing we are trying to overthrow.  Can you bind a man's belief by making him sign certain articles of Faith?  No: his thought will be free, in spite of it; and I would have Action--Life--as free as Thought.  Our platform-- to adopt your image--has but one plank:  Truth.  Let each only be true to himself: BE himself, ACT himself, or herself with the uttermost candor.  We can all agree upon that.'\\n\\n\\\"The agreement was accordingly made.  And certainly no happier or more hopeful human beings went to bed in all New England that night.\\n\\n\\\"I arose with the sun, went into the garden, and commenced weeding, intending to do my quota of work before breakfast, and then devote the day to reading and conversation.  I was presently joined by Shelldrake and Mallory, and between us we finished the onions and radishes, stuck the peas, and cleaned the alleys.  Perkins, after milking the cow and turning her out to pasture, assisted Mrs. Shelldrake in the kitchen.  At breakfast we were joined by Hollins, who made no excuse for his easy morning habits; nor was one expected.  I may as well tell you now, though, that his natural instincts never led him to work.  After a week, when a second crop of weeds was coming on, Mallory fell off also, and thenceforth Shelldrake and myself had the entire charge of the garden.  Perkins did the rougher work, and was always on hand when he was wanted.  Very soon, however, I noticed that he was in the habit of disappearing for two or three hours in the afternoon.\\n\\n\\\"Our meals preserved the same Spartan simplicity.  Eunice, however, carried her point in regard to the salad; for Abel, after tasting and finding it very palatable, decided that oil and vinegar might be classed in the catalogue of True Food.  Indeed, his long abstinence from piquant flavors gave him such an appetite for it that our supply of lettuce was soon exhausted.  An embarrassing accident also favored us with the use of salt.  Perkins happening to move his knee at the moment I was dipping an onion into the blacking-box lid, our supply was knocked upon the floor.  He picked it up, and we both hoped the accident might pass unnoticed.  But Abel, stretching his long neck across the corner of the table, caught a glimpse of what was going on.\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`What's that?' he asked.\\n\\n\\\"`Oh, it's--it's only,' said I, seeking for a synonyme, `only chloride of sodium!'\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Chloride of sodium! what do you do with it?'\\n\\n\\\"`Eat it with onions,' said I, boldly: `it's a chemical substance, but I believe it is found in some plants.'\\n\\n\\\"Eunice, who knew something of chemistry (she taught a class, though you wouldn't think it), grew red with suppressed fun, but the others were as ignorant as Abel Mallory himself.\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Let me taste it,' said he, stretching out an onion.\\n\\n\\\"I handed him the box-lid, which still contained a portion of its contents.  He dipped the onion, bit off a piece, and chewed it gravely.\\n\\n\\\"`Why,' said he, turning to me, `it's very much like salt.'\\n\\n\\\"Perkins burst into a spluttering yell, which discharged an onion- top he had just put between his teeth across the table; Eunice and I gave way at the same moment; and the others, catching the joke, joined us.  But while we were laughing, Abel was finishing his onion, and the result was that Salt was added to the True Food, and thereafter appeared regularly on the table.\\n\\n\\\"The forenoons we usually spent in reading and writing, each in his or her chamber.  (Oh, the journals, Ned!--but you shall not see mine.)  After a midday meal,--I cannot call it dinner,--we sat upon the stoop, listening while one of us read aloud, or strolled down the shores on either side, or, when the sun was not too warm, got into a boat, and rowed or floated lazily around the promontory.\\n\\n\\\"One afternoon, as I was sauntering off, past the garden, towards the eastern inlet, I noticed Perkins slipping along behind the cedar knobs, towards the little woodland at the end of our domain.  Curious to find out the cause of his mysterious disappearances, I followed cautiously.  From the edge of the wood I saw him enter a little gap between the rocks, which led down to the water.  Presently a thread of blue smoke stole up.  Quietly creeping along, I got upon the nearer bluff and looked down.  There was a sort of hearth built up at the base of the rock, with a brisk little fire burning upon it, but Perkins had disappeared.  I stretched myself out upon the moss, in the shade, and waited.  In about half an hour up came Perkins, with a large fish in one hand and a lump of clay in the other.  I now understood the mystery.  He carefully imbedded the fish in a thin layer of clay, placed it on the coals, and then went down to the shore to wash his hands.  On his return he found me watching the fire.\\n\\n\\\"`Ho, ho, Mr. Enos!' said he, `you've found me out; But you won't say nothin'.  Gosh! you like it as well I do.  Look 'ee there!'-- breaking open the clay, from which arose `a steam of rich distilled perfumes,'--`and, I say, I've got the box-lid with that 'ere stuff in it,--ho! ho!'--and the scamp roared again.\\n\\n\\\"Out of a hole in the rock he brought salt and the end of a loaf, and between us we finished the fish.  Before long, I got into the habit of disappearing in the afternoon.\\n\\n\\\"Now and then we took walks, alone or collectively, to the nearest village, or even to Bridgeport, for the papers or a late book.  The few purchases we required were made at such times, and sent down in a cart, or, if not too heavy, carried by Perkins in a basket.  I noticed that Abel, whenever we had occasion to visit a grocery, would go sniffing around, alternately attracted or repelled by the various articles: now turning away with a shudder from a ham,--now inhaling, with a fearful delight and uncertainty, the odor of smoked herrings.  `I think herrings must feed on sea- weed,' said he, `there is such a vegetable attraction about them.'  After his violent vegetarian harangues, however, he hesitated about adding them to his catalogue.\\n\\n\\\"But, one day, as we were passing through the village, he was reminded by the sign of \\\\`WARTER CRACKERS' in the window of an obscure grocery that he required a supply of these articles, and we therefore entered.  There was a splendid Rhode Island cheese on the counter, from which the shop-mistress was just cutting a slice for a customer.  Abel leaned over it, inhaling the rich, pungent fragrance.\\n\\n\\\"`Enos,' said he to me, between his sniffs, `this impresses me like flowers--like marigolds.  It must be--really--yes, the vegetable element is predominant.  My instinct towards it is so strong that I cannot be mistaken.  May I taste it, ma'am?'\\n\\n\\\"The woman sliced off a thin corner, and presented it to him on the knife.\\n\\n\\\"`Delicious!' he exclaimed; `I am right,--this is the True Food.  Give me two pounds--and the crackers, ma'am.'\\n\\n\\\"I turned away, quite as much disgusted as amused with this charlatanism.  And yet I verily believe the fellow was sincere-- self-deluded only.  I had by this time lost my faith in him, though not in the great Arcadian principles.  On reaching home, after an hour's walk, I found our household in unusual commotion.  Abel was writhing in intense pain: he had eaten the whole two pounds of cheese, on his way home!  His stomach, so weakened by years of unhealthy abstinence from true nourishment, was now terribly tortured by this sudden stimulus.  Mrs. Shelldrake, fortunately, had some mustard among her stores, and could therefore administer a timely emetic.  His life was saved, but he was very ill for two or three days.  Hollins did not fail to take advantage of this circumstance to overthrow the authority which Abel had gradually acquired on the subject of food.  He was so arrogant in his nature that he could not tolerate the same quality in another, even where their views coincided.\\n\\n\\\"By this time several weeks had passed away.  It was the beginning of July, and the long summer heats had come.  I was driven out of my attic during the middle hours of the day, and the others found it pleasanter on the doubly shaded stoop than in their chambers.  We were thus thrown more together than usual--a circumstance which made our life more monotonous to the others, as I could see; but to myself, who could at last talk to Eunice, and who was happy at the very sight of her, this \\\\`heated term' seemed borrowed from Elysium.\\n\\nI read aloud, and the sound of my own voice gave me confidence; many passages suggested discussions, in which I took a part; and you may judge, Ned, how fast I got on, from the fact that I ventured to tell Eunice of my fish-bakes with Perkins, and invite her to join them.  After that, she also often disappeared from sight for an hour or two in the afternoon.\\\"\\n\\n\\\\----\\\"Oh, Mr. Johnson,\\\" interrupted Mrs. Billings, \\\"it wasn't for the fish!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course not,\\\" said her husband; \\\"it was for my sake.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, you need not think it was for you.  Enos,\\\" she added, perceiving the feminine dilemma into which she had been led, \\\"all this is not necessary to the story.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Stop!\\\" he answered.  \\\"The A. C. has been revived for this night only.  Do you remember our platform, or rather no-platform?  I must follow my impulses, and say whatever comes uppermost.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Right, Enos,\\\" said Mr. Johnson; \\\"I, as temporary Arcadian, take the same ground.  My instinct tells me that you, Mrs. Billings, must permit the confession.\\\"\\n\\nShe submitted with a good grace, and her husband continued:\\n\\n\\\"I said that our lazy life during the hot weather had become a little monotonous.  The Arcadian plan had worked tolerably well, on the whole, for there was very little for any one to do--Mrs. Shelldrake and Perkins Brown excepted.  Our conversation, however, lacked spirit and variety.  We were, perhaps unconsciously, a little tired of hearing and assenting to the same sentiments.  But one evening, about this time, Hollins struck upon a variation, the consequences of which he little foresaw.  We had been reading one of Bulwer's works (the weather was too hot for Psychology), and came upon this paragraph, or something like it:\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Ah, Behind the Veil!  We see the summer smile of the Earth-- enamelled meadow and limpid stream,--but what hides she in her sunless heart?  Caverns of serpents, or grottoes of priceless gems?\\n\\nYouth, whose soul sits on thy countenance, thyself wearing no mask, strive not to lift the masks of others!  Be content with what thou seest; and wait until Time and Experience shall teach thee to find jealousy behind the sweet smile, and hatred under the honeyed word!'\\n\\n\\\"This seemed to us a dark and bitter reflection; but one or another of us recalled some illustration of human hypocrisy, and the evidences, by the simple fact of repetition, gradually led to a division of opinion--Hollins, Shelldrake, and Miss Ringtop on the dark side, and the rest of us on the bright.  The last, however, contented herself with quoting from her favorite poet, Gamaliel J. Gawthrop:\\n\\n```\\n    \\\"`I look beyond thy brow's concealment!          I see thy spirit's dark revealment!          Thy inner self betrayed I see:          Thy coward, craven, shivering ME!'\\n```\\n\\n\\\"`We think we know one another,' exclaimed Hollins; `but do we?  We see the faults of others, their weaknesses, their disagreeable qualities, and we keep silent.  How much we should gain, were candor as universal as concealment!  Then each one, seeing himself as others see him, would truly know himself.  How much misunderstanding might be avoided--how much hidden shame be removed--hopeless, because unspoken, love made glad--honest admiration cheer its object--uttered sympathy mitigate misfortune--in short, how much brighter and happier the world would become if each one expressed, everywhere and at all times, his true and entire feeling!  Why, even Evil would lose half its power!'\\n\\n\\\"There seemed to be so much practical wisdom in these views that we were all dazzled and half-convinced at the start.  So, when Hollins, turning towards me, as he continued, exclaimed--`Come, why should not this candor be adopted in our Arcadia?  Will any one-- will you, Enos--commence at once by telling me now--to my face--my principal faults?'  I answered after a moment's reflection--`You have a great deal of intellectual arrogance, and you are, physically, very indolent'\\n\\n\\\"He did not flinch from the self-invited test, though he looked a little surprised.\\n\\n\\\"`Well put,' said he, `though I do not say that you are entirely correct.  Now, what are my merits?'\\n\\n\\\"`You are clear-sighted,' I answered, `an earnest seeker after truth, and courageous in the avowal of your thoughts.'\\n\\n\\\"This restored the balance, and we soon began to confess our own private faults and weaknesses.  Though the confessions did not go very deep,--no one betraying anything we did not all know already,--yet they were sufficient to strength Hollins in his new idea, and it was unanimously resolved that Candor should thenceforth be the main charm of our Arcadian life.  It was the very thing *I* wanted, in order to make a certain communication to Eunice; but I should probably never have reached the point, had not the same candor been exercised towards me, from a quarter where I least expected it.\\n\\n\\\"The next day, Abel, who had resumed his researches after the True Food, came home to supper with a healthier color than I had before seen on his face.\\n\\n\\\"`Do you know,' said he, looking shyly at Hollins, `that I begin to think Beer must be a natural beverage?  There was an auction in the village to-day, as I passed through, and I stopped at a cake-stand to get a glass of water, as it was very hot.  There was no water-- only beer: so I thought I would try a glass, simply as an experiment.  Really, the flavor was very agreeable.  And it occurred to me, on the way home, that all the elements contained in beer are vegetable.  Besides, fermentation is a natural process.  I think the question has never been properly tested before.'\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`But the alcohol!' exclaimed Hollins.\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`I could not distinguish any, either by taste or smell.  I know that chemical analysis is said to show it; but may not the alcohol be created, somehow, during the analysis?'\\n\\n\\\"`Abel,' said Hollins, in a fresh burst of candor, `you will never be a Reformer, until you possess some of the commonest elements of knowledge.'\\n\\n\\\"The rest of us were much diverted: it was a pleasant relief to our monotonous amiability.\\n\\n\\\"Abel, however, had a stubborn streak in his character.  The next day he sent Perkins Brown to Bridgeport for a dozen bottles of \\\\`Beer.'  Perkins, either intentionally or by mistake, (I always suspected the former,) brought pint-bottles of Scotch ale, which he placed in the coolest part of the cellar.  The evening happened to be exceedingly hot and sultry, and, as we were all fanning ourselves and talking languidly, Abel bethought him of his beer.  In his thirst, he drank the contents of the first bottle, almost at a single draught.\",\"timestamp\":1640141936,\"title\":\"acting upon the hint, \\\"if the remainder of the ceremonies are equally agreeable, I should like to be a permanent member of your order.\\\"\"},\"digest\":\"rmFdwc4OZVapHBwUKFYQYFiV_xpgLrtRNu91YGUAbOU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x104C9415d8cF60006fA1f2ecb12Aa1B60108c24D\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"WC9SYqKrr8gWySgOhYI8UEqjuaPSCUzzBatni6RqNJg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ATRew8VXesLsYbBg8nh_Q6UeuxJ_Px5PWpEE4ixwtpk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"znz72g_6d27BqFN1Ri8OSg3YRG70T6tFlfWC45IEEIqrRwcx24Akh4Yg-cFz0osXHgvdWM0ixWIHnWGw5DgkoA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x05d5a8db221353e9e3663392072c4cd7eb61ad8350f25bd29a49d9bdcdedf3017696138ab23521e9ce35c3d19106ed0ca0501e487dc96e808c52cf78f731dc991c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"WC9SYqKrr8gWySgOhYI8UEqjuaPSCUzzBatni6RqNJg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ATRew8VXesLsYbBg8nh_Q6UeuxJ_Px5PWpEE4ixwtpk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rmFdwc4OZVapHBwUKFYQYFiV_xpgLrtRNu91YGUAbOU\"}"
