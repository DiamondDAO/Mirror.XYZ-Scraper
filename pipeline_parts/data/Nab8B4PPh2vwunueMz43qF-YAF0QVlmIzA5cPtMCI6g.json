"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I believe history will always remember 2021. This year, the NFT works of encryption artist beeple sold at Christie's, making NFT popular all over the world overnight. It not only swept the art field, but also jumped into the mainstream vision and became a hot topic in society.\\n\\nLast week, Christie's announced that beeple would take his first physical work human one to the Christie's studio again and shoot it in New York on the evening of November 9. Since this auction will be beeple's first return after every day: the first 5000 days, it is estimated that it will attract more than $15 million in bids, which has attracted unprecedented attention and pressure from artists to auction houses. Noah Davis, head of digital art and online sales at Christie's, said that after a record breaking auction, \\\"any artist will face pressure to surpass himself\\\".\\n\\nPressure is not without reason. After beeple, many large traditional auction houses (Christie's, Sotheby's and Fuyis) have quickly accepted NFT art transactions and dug up more NFT works with collection value for collectors to buy. So far, four of the top ten high priced NFT works have been sold through traditional auction houses, indicating that even in this most advanced and cutting-edge technology field, the excellent reputation guarantee of traditional platforms is still very important for sellers.\\n\\nHowever, at present, many popular encryption art works have reached sky high prices. When more new buyers want to rush into the market, does their purchase preference change? In the face of the constantly fluctuating NFT market, are artists and auction houses still full of confidence? Entering the autumn auction season this year, maybe we can see where the wind is blowing in the NFT art auction market.\\n\\nNFT artist Andreas Ivan collaborated with the auction house for the first time to exhibit his 16 \\\"smoochies\\\". Source: Poly Hong Kong\\n\\nReturn to Rationality: the works of new artists with reasonable prices are popular\\n\\nAt the end of May and the beginning of June this year, the first global NFT encryption art exhibition was held in Shanghai, presenting the outstanding works of 27 top digital artists at home and abroad. In the list of artists as famous as beeple and Pak, the name of artist Andreas Ivan is impressively listed. In the middle of this year, Singapore's business times selected the Millennium generation Asian encryption artist with the highest income, and Andreas Ivan, a rising star, was also included.\\n\\nAndreas Ivan may not be familiar to most domestic audiences, but he is no stranger to China. In fact, Andreas of Russian and Mauritian descent was born in Russia but worked in China for a long time. He is the co-founder of a creative agency in Beijing. He revealed to the 21st Century Business Herald that at first he started NFT creation through the introduction of a friend toomuchlag who started playing NFT very early. So far, he is still very grateful for this unintentional experience, which makes him a part of witnessing this historical moment. \\\"It was my friend who shared with me the rising art revolution that gave me the opportunity to enter the market at its early stage of development.\\\"\\n\\nFortunately, Andreas's first NFT work, a short animation cycle called \\\"Dali dream\\\", was sold to NFT collector matrix at the price of 1.66 eth (ether, about 49000 yuan). Matrix is known as a famous collector who is good at discovering blue chip artists in the circle. Therefore, Andreas was soon regarded as a potential star and attracted wide attention in the industry. At present, this work is also being sold at an amazing high price of 22 eth (about 650000 yuan) in the secondary market.\\n\\nSimilar to digital art works such as cryptopunks and the boring ape Club (bayc), Andreas's most influential work is also a surreal character living in the meta universe, named \\\"smoochies\\\". Smoochies series is composed of cute 3D cartoon characters with plump lips like ready to kiss. Each has a carefully rendered appearance (such as Audrey Hepburn, Harry Potter and Bruce Lee), and has its own name and special story setting. The creation origin of smoochies series can be traced back to 2016. Since Andreas's mother lives thousands of miles away from him in Mauritius, he began to create \\\"this love letter to his mother\\\". \\\"Every time I feel sad, my mother will come to me, kiss my forehead and tell me that everything will be all right. Her lips are the shape of smoochies lips,\\\" he told reporters\\n\\nAndreas once said that he would only launch 100 smoochies in his creative career. After launching the first 36 smoochies at the beginning of this year, they were sold on the Ethereum blockchain platform at a record price, becoming the NFT series with the highest sales record in Asia at that time. Last month, poly Hong Kong auction announced the first NFT special exhibition and online auction, in which the personal special part is Andreas's \\\"smoochies: m Ã† tertiary\\\". He created 16 smoochies for the exhibition again, and the number of members of the smoochies series has reached 52. The exhibition also printed 8 physical prints for each smoochies for the first time, and all physical prints were sold out soon after the opening. His NFT works will be open for auction from November 8 to 12.\\n\\nBut Andreas's popularity does not depend solely on \\\"limited supply\\\" or luck bonus. According to the newly released hiscox online art transaction report in 2021, NFT art collectors have changed from following the trend of buying sky high priced works to more rationally explore the works of new encrypted artists with reasonable price and appreciation potential. \\\"Perhaps critics will think that art itself is insignificant, but the combination of uniqueness, ownership, Gamification and storytelling is driving a new generation of collectors and investors to trade,\\\" the report said\\n\\nThe explosive NFT boom at the beginning of this year made people only pay attention to the works of certain famous artists, such as beeple, Pak, etc. then their works were sold at a sky high price, which was higher than most people's tolerance. Therefore, as people gradually return to the essence of NFT art as a digital art enabled by science and technology, the \\\"code generation art\\\" (such as crypto punks and smoochies) with personality and story connotation can attract the interest of collectors in the long run.\\n\\nAuction line upgrade: high participation supplemented by technical blessing\\n\\nAt the beginning of this year, NFT officially entered the traditional auction industry. However, in order to follow the trend, most auction houses basically sell hot second-hand NFT, and less really participate in exploring the artistic value of NFT. With the demand of collectors returning to more rational art appreciation from the lively blind pursuit of buying, auction houses have simply provided popular auctions and systems for digital currency trading from the beginning, and gradually returned to looking for digital works of art with long-term investment and collection value for collectors.\\n\\nPoly Hong Kong recently announced to jointly hold the first NFT special exhibition and online auction with the authority, which is an official announcement of poly Hong Kong's joining the NFT art auction group. Whether it is Andreas's personal special session or the digital artist group exhibition of \\\"are you bound or not?\\\", poly Hong Kong has been highly involved in it since the selection of artists. They worked with artists to find valuable perspectives, discuss curatorial matters, and bring a series of NFT works tailored for the exhibition. The degree of investment is really high.\\n\\nA high degree of investment comes from full confidence. Although the overall trend of NFT art trading market still fluctuates recently, Zhang Yixiu, general manager of poly Hong Kong Auction Co., Ltd., is still very optimistic about the prospect of NFT art. He told the 21st Century Business Herald reporter: \\\"NFT art is a new blue ocean, so both artists and collectors have high expectations. Although it is really very different from the traditional art field, it is mostly limited (market) I'm confused about its digital nature, but I believe this will be gradually overcome under the development of science and technology. For example, we didn't know the development of smart phones ten years ago, so I'm very confident in the future. \\\"\\n\\nAlthough in the eyes of most people, NFT starts with blockchain, digital currency and other elements, it seems to be a new product of \\\"another dimension\\\". However, for auction houses, NFT art is essentially an emerging art type with technology addition. Like other art categories, there is no need to overemphasize its investment value. He pointed out: \\\"This emerging art field is like any kind of investment, which complements the investment of funds. But NFT art, driven by cryptocurrency and blockchain, will not generate disputes about authenticity or ownership of traditional art products. Therefore, collectors at any stage can invest directly without burden. I don't think NFT art needs to be too complicated.\\\"\\n\\nAccording to Zhang Yixiu, pricing NFT works of art is actually similar to the pricing rules for general works of art. It still takes the artist's experience, the work itself, and the past price level as a reference. After completing the pricing, formulate publicity and promotion strategies that can be better understood by collectors according to the digital form of NFT art itself. He told reporters: \\\"In this exhibition, we have exhibited prints for artists' solo digital works. On the one hand, we hope that collectors can better cut in from the perspective of physical collection, on the other hand, we can also make collectors look forward to the future NFT art online auction.\\\"\\n\\nThe authority, an art, culture and Technology Incubation Platform, has long focused on the promotion of new media art and blockchain art. As the technical partner of poly Hong Kong NFT's first exhibition, its founder sun Kangqiao pointed out the \\\"resource fill\\\" requirements of traditional auctions for technology companies in the blockchain field. He told the 21st Century Business Herald: \\\"A highly developed civilization will realize a high degree of virtualization and digitization. We are about to usher in a future dominated by digital assets. The high integration of virtual and reality in the future means that virtual assets must be endowed with rights and interests in the future society and injected with values equal to or greater than those of physical assets.\\\"\\n\\nHe stressed that in the future, large-scale commercial use of NFT will blossom everywhere. However, in the planning of NFT by traditional auctions, many experts in auction houses know art very well, but do not necessarily know the trend of blockchain or encryption market. Therefore, \\\"we hope that this cooperation will bring a positive impact on the Asian NFT art market and improve the status of blockchain technology and digital art in the art world.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1636206805,\"title\":\"NFT art auction observation: return to rationality and original intention in ups and downs\"},\"digest\":\"Byywe0xNWI-SimCHe67JtxS769suNqAJpYLaWC4eTW4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x44e7D23d6eDca23E145F1Cf54fb46627aD8863eD\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"siSp9F191Kfz2HFY4DtSbH2mR8b48vaf0FuPF9ZnAoU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Y4xw_EX6s7ODQX7wbg1cpGfHCXbkg2s5j2zz41KKuuw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"EDfYQoiK-Wlbt1pdmv98pJRM7b0ibOcHdOHsfy-seqGA8SNH5djfIwa-_CHFC5UajuXdED8SeWTQ2tfTcgYRXQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa981c58fc55a2b29468456816557e0fcd562357fc6b477d2d67ccfb5d524940e70977b1891e003230b446054c31b6d23caa09b3310a2e9e6b7caf027497c94811b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"siSp9F191Kfz2HFY4DtSbH2mR8b48vaf0FuPF9ZnAoU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Y4xw_EX6s7ODQX7wbg1cpGfHCXbkg2s5j2zz41KKuuw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Byywe0xNWI-SimCHe67JtxS769suNqAJpYLaWC4eTW4\"}"
