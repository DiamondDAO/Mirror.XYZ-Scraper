"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Integrated blockchain world is the next gen.\\n\\nNowaday, Blockchain is growing blazing fast and going to well-known in many fields. Since the generation of smart contract (ETH1.0) getting started. The world of blockchain is going to be the different. Many corporate looking forward to adopt blockchain infrastructure and make applications on top of it.\\n\\nSeems like each of network have their own blockchain (likely each world!)\\n\\n> World of Solana,\\n>\\n> World of Ethereum,\\n>\\n> World of Binance Smart Chain,\\n>\\n> World of Polkadot\\n\\nYou cannot make buy ERC-20 on Ethereum in Binance Smart Chain. (only if it’s created one representative in Binance Smart Chain) like ETH in Binance Smart Chain named as bETH\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*BW9k9hyqsoCajXGx)\\n\\nEcosystem Comparison (Solana) by Sol mates\\n\\nSo, What is the issue?\\n\\nLet’s think about if… You buy bETH in Binance Smart Chain but you need to use ETH in Ethereum Mainnet. What can you do?\\n\\nCurrently technology available nowaday is only “Bridge” There are many service that available such as [wormhole bridge](https://wormholebridge.com/), [anyswap](https://anyswap.exchange/),[ xPollinate](https://xpollinate.io/)\\n\\nNormally, You transfer bETH to Bridge contract (Binance Smart Chain)\\n\\nBridge Contract send you ETH (Ethereum Chain)\\n\\nSound easy but complicated when you want to do much more transaction. Let’s me show you\\n\\n> In example. You have $1000 ETH staked in dApp (ETH Chain) and You want transfer to Arbitrum for staking in same dApp but in Arbitrum Chain which will give you the reward.\\n>\\n> *1. You have to unstake from dApp in Ethereum*\\n>\\n> *2. Bridge $1000 ETH to Arbitrum*\\n>\\n> *3. Stake $1000 ETH to dApp in Arbitrum*\\n>\\n> 4\\\\. Claim reward in Arbitrum\\n\\nVoila! in this case, Atleast 3 transactions have to been done.\\n\\nSo Axelar Network come to solve this issue to much more simpler. Why you should unstake and bridged while it’s similar dApp? What if you staked in Ethereum network and claim reward in Arbitrum?\\n\\nThe goal of Axelar is to be the universal connector of Web3. Allow every network and every chain can connect each other and send the data across.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*nnVZjD86S4jfprbANCdZxA.png)\\n\\nAxelar Network had their own Network which being as the middleman for interoperability by deployed bridged contract in supported network. When transactions occured (such as you transfer token to bridged wallet) The Axelar validators will check and confirmed the transactions. Then doing a transaction on target chain.\\n\\nAxelar also make gateway for the contract. That’s dApp builder can trigger smart contract after something happen in another chain. In example.\\n\\n> One dApp that normally launched in Ethereum mainnet but dApp just deployed on Solana. dApp builder want to use criteria that only people stake more than 1000 xToken in Ethereum can claim their starter NFT in Solana. In this case, Axelar can be the middle-man that linked data from Smart Contract in Ethereum Mainnet to Solana Smart Contract.\\n\\nThis example shown one of use-case of Axelar Network. To have inter-operability network across all network may help to improve flexibility and enhancing the power of Smart contract. This also help dApp more user-friendly.\\n\\nThe Integrated network will come in one day.\",\"timestamp\":1641742401,\"title\":\"Axelar Network — The Blockchain Network Interoperability\"},\"digest\":\"r9YD-3RvYH4KarQHI9bDJGGfxZ9xTn-UW2em2qbuGsg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x87049c7C047A84F58a3549da0D2d48e7347A4e06\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"yyL1FankTyZODufOjDCGFBNIUl6wy_yfQqWY86_FqhI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"M1PQF0CltwFZ1lgPtuFRLpkG2Oq5CW-QIOF2kgrnezM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Wpu5HJBSd5PD2OWnz6X3GQJ30kW2USSlT7NF3ugrPMnhCgafJdNqNacHrlZ-Yulb0WwHj_zz3acg3LrEwEIetg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa608b11bbe8756dd1820f78496d91ef9880e27d756d444fa8b7724e083a9280b5145f24ae0c155f0594ed7011662d4fb48a33bf3589530a561fe18d9a104d2691b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"yyL1FankTyZODufOjDCGFBNIUl6wy_yfQqWY86_FqhI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"M1PQF0CltwFZ1lgPtuFRLpkG2Oq5CW-QIOF2kgrnezM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"r9YD-3RvYH4KarQHI9bDJGGfxZ9xTn-UW2em2qbuGsg\"}"
