"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"It’s been a month since I left my job in Technology Investment Banking (M&A) to explore  other industries, such as consumer tech and fintech. However, after stumbling upon the Web 3.0, and going down the crypto rabbit hole, I have to admit that there is no turning back. \\n\\nThis industry (movement?) is developing 5x faster than I am able to track it. This has kept me on my toes since the day I started investing in the space (back in March 2021). As an investor, getting into crypto even at the peak of its bull run has had its rewards. When the market subsequently crashed by \\\\~50%, I naturally asked: WTF am I invested in ? Each day I ask a new question, and each day I get rewarded for doing do. Despite entering the crypto investing scene at the worst possible time from a macro perspective, my crypto portfolio has fared better than my stock investments. That begs the question: Why leave my job to explore the industry full time?\\n\\nThe answer: I fundamentally believe in the vision Web 3.0 brings for all internet users. For those who are new to the term itself, Web 3.0 is the coming version of the Internet (hopefully!), that takes the best parts about Web 2.0 (the tech stacks, infrastructure, connectivity through mobile, social and cloud) and combines that with the open source and decentralized nature of Web 1.0 (individuals utilizing technologies and tools built by other creators). Web 2.0 created a closed-walls approach to software production and sales. Web 3.0 has created an open source model where everyone has the power to create and monetize tools, art, technology and experiences on an open, trustless and censor-resistant Web (“Web 3.0”). \\n\\nThe purpose of this blog is to keep me honest, help me contextualize my research into some cool Web 3.0 projects, track my progress as I learn something new in this space, and hopefully, inspire an individual or two to join the movement. \",\"timestamp\":1635360868,\"title\":\"Introduction\"},\"digest\":\"YsSsgyM3FgjG4hVz59Ravgy1zRMd0pP7D-uYE3p-41o\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xA2B9c5C0B544Aa161624b6767744D4106a1e32C1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uUzjrWAowHb0vtOQi5vqOd4bCXHlgdoq9QOqzmau4eM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FoH2IgXpZ_6nLNWtORsHXwJihfZI-NPfKkhoWT4kEtA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"101EAACmsgHl_Snj5wvRuUrbXtkuw6v-_I4IMBDC1v89R-fWhdYyQocm1oz7yVRCfAI-Bv3tmQth-yWFVPHAyg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8a3222f9af3d99b847871d0b7632d89fe52b3c9521eb8b7f4969585283ff226440446a234893de612bce5141be46eac9f4d543f1cc21de311ca721504c66cff81c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uUzjrWAowHb0vtOQi5vqOd4bCXHlgdoq9QOqzmau4eM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FoH2IgXpZ_6nLNWtORsHXwJihfZI-NPfKkhoWT4kEtA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"YsSsgyM3FgjG4hVz59Ravgy1zRMd0pP7D-uYE3p-41o\"}"
