"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Middle period\\n\\nAs a holder of the Grand Prix de Rome, Debussy was given a three-year stay at the [Villa Medici](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Villa-Medici) in Rome, where, under what were supposed to be ideal conditions, he was to pursue his creative work. Most composers who were granted this state scholarship, however, found life in this magnificent Renaissance palace irksome and longed to return to simpler and more familiar surroundings. Debussy himself eventually fled from the Villa Medici after two years and returned to Blanche Vasnier in Paris. Several other women, some of doubtful reputation, were also associated with him in his early years. At this time Debussy lived a life of extreme [indulgence](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/indulgence). Once one of his mistresses, Gabrielle (“Gaby”) Dupont, threatened suicide. His first wife, Rosalie (“Lily”) Texier, a dressmaker, whom he married in 1899, did in fact shoot herself, though not fatally, and, as is sometimes the case with artists of passionate intensity, Debussy himself was haunted by thoughts of suicide.\\n\\nThe main musical influence in Debussy’s work was the work of [Richard Wagner](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Wagner-German-composer) and the Russian composers [Aleksandr Borodin](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Aleksandr-Borodin) and [Modest Mussorgsky](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Modest-Mussorgsky). Wagner fulfilled the sensuous ambitions not only of composers but also of the Symbolist poets and the Impressionist painters. Wagner’s [conception](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conception) of *[Gesamtkunstwerk](https://www.britannica.com/art/Gesamtkunstwerk)* (“total art work”) encouraged artists to refine upon their emotional responses and to exteriorize their hidden dream states, often in a shadowy, incomplete form; hence the more [tenuous](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tenuous) nature of the work of Wagner’s French [disciples](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/disciples). It was in this spirit that Debussy wrote the [symphonic poem](https://www.britannica.com/art/symphonic-poem) *Prélude à l’après-midi d’un faune* (1894). Other early works by Debussy show his [affinity](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/affinity) with the English [Pre-Raphaelite painters](https://www.britannica.com/art/Pre-Raphaelite-Brotherhood); the most notable of these works is *La Damoiselle élue* (1888), based on “The Blessed Damozel” (1850), a poem by the English poet and painter [Dante Gabriel Rossetti](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dante-Gabriel-Rossetti). In the course of his career, however, which covered only 25 years, Debussy was constantly breaking new ground. Explorations, he maintained, were the essence of music; they were his musical bread and wine. His single completed opera, *[Pelléas et Mélisande](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pelleas-et-Melisande-opera-by-Debussy)* (first performed in 1902), demonstrates how the Wagnerian technique could be adapted to portray subjects like the dreamy nightmarish figures of this opera who were doomed to self-destruction. Debussy and his librettist, [Maurice Maeterlinck](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Maurice-Maeterlinck), declared that they were haunted in this work by the terrifying nightmare tale of [Edgar Allan Poe](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edgar-Allan-Poe), *The Fall of the House of Usher.* The style of *Pelléas* was to be replaced by a bolder, more highly coloured manner. In his seascape *La Mer* (1905) he was inspired by the ideas of the English painter [J.M.W. Turner](https://www.britannica.com/biography/J-M-W-Turner) and the French painter [Claude Monet](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Claude-Monet). In his work, as in his personal life, he was anxious to gather experience from every region that the imaginative mind could explore.\",\"timestamp\":1637008215,\"title\":\"Let's know about Debussy - Part 2\"},\"digest\":\"JLfD7XmeCjlsCONqOYafW8xoT07lYoOEh8kH2EGuzww\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x13BdD13534Dcec07a2E7B862a126D2F09D04A094\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Z8zUrBEdficZiD7UpANEHBsWmdviLCvLTsFvUJ6FUO8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KADdZY4m4M1xJKrjp_UI_AkF6xVLnOI7OIPTZ5rnQ0A\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"-fSjFCPVLvSxjog_RxXXv0Jg6_-RdzU3GzYireSUBat2zlvIcJpMk3xbx_2EHr61xB0zPbKDUsMeXjncizmL5Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5aa98da35445da9f533b413c2e62231af1eb2e997d9abb2cb9878b8b66e7c06f1b113bb4371b03454d55601c47aa6fb58138b2a7fdc92a867dcf3efdb745735f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Z8zUrBEdficZiD7UpANEHBsWmdviLCvLTsFvUJ6FUO8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KADdZY4m4M1xJKrjp_UI_AkF6xVLnOI7OIPTZ5rnQ0A\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"JLfD7XmeCjlsCONqOYafW8xoT07lYoOEh8kH2EGuzww\"}"
