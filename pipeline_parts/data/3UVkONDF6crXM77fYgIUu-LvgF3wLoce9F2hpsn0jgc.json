"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I had no idea anyone else would, but the company sent it to The Mail without my name but describing me as \\\"an American gentleman\\\"-- Instantly the foreign correspondents went to them to find out who I was and to whom I was sending the letter-- I told the company it was none of their damned business--that I employed the boy by the week and that I could send him where-ever I chose.  Then the boy's father got proud and wrote to The Mail about his age and so they got the boy's name.  Mine, however, is still out of it, but in America they are sure to know as the people on the steamer are crazy about him and Kinsey the Purser knows he is sent by me.  After he gets back from Chicago and Philadelphia, you can do with him as you like until the steamer sails.  If the thing is taken up as it is here and the fat is in the fire, then you can do as you please-- I mean you can tell the papers about it or not-- Somerset holds one end of the bets and I the other.  There are two bets: one that he will beat the mail to Chicago, Somerset agreeing to consider the letter you give him to Bruce, as equivalent to one coming from here.  The other bet is that he will deliver and get receipts from you, Nora and Bruce, and return here by the 5th of April-- You and Bobby ought to be able to do well by him if it becomes, as I say, so far public that there is no possibility of further concealment-- You have my permission to do what you please-- He is coming into my employ as soon as he gets back and as soon as the company give him a medal.\\n\\nOver here there is the greatest possible interest in the matter-- At the Clubs I go to, the waiters all wait on me in order to have the latest developments and when it was cabled over here that the Customs' people intended stopping him, indignation raged at the Foreign office.\\n\\nof love,\\n\\nDICK.\\n\\n89 Jermyn Street, S. W.\\n\\nMarch--1899 DEAR NORA:\\n\\nThis is to be handed to you by my special messenger, who is to assure you that I am in the best of health and spirits-- Keep him for a few hours and then send him on to Chicago-- As he is doing this on a bet, do not give him any written instructions only verbal ones.  I am very well and happy and send you all my love-- Jaggers has been running errands for me ever since I came here, and a most loyal servitor when I was ill-- On his return I want to keep him on as a buttons.  See that he gets plenty to eat-- If he comes back alive he will have broken the messenger boy service record by three thousand miles.  Personally, it does not cost me anything to speak of.  The dramatization of the Soldiers continues briskly, and Maude is sending Grundy back the Jackal, to have a second go at it.  Maude insists on its being done--so I stand to win a lot. RICHARD.\\n\\nBeefsteak Club, 9, Green Street, Leicester Square, W. C. Tuesday.  March--1899. DEAR MOTHER:--\\n\\nThe faithful Jaggers should have arrived to-day, or will do so this evening-- I am sure you will make the poor little chap comfortable-- I do regret having sent him on such a journey especially since the papers here made such an infernal row over it-- However, neither of us will lose by it in the end--\\n\\nI dined with Lady Clarke last night and met Lord Castleton there and he invited me up to Dublin for the Punchtown Races-- I have a great mind to go and write a story on them-- Castleton is a great sport and very popular at home and in England and it would be a pleasant experience.  Kuhne Beveridge is doing a bust of me in khaki outfit for the Academy and also for a private exhibition of her own works, which includes the Prince of Wales, and the Little Queen of Holland.\\n\\nHays Hammond has invited me down to South Africa again, with a promise of making my fortune, but I am not going as it takes too long. DICK.\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\nTHE BOER WAR\\n\\nOn May 4, 1899, at Marion, Massachusetts, Richard was married to Cecil Clark, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John M. Clark of Chicago.  After the marriage Richard and his wife spent a few weeks in Marion and the remainder of the summer in London and Aix-les-Bains.\\n\\nMARION, May 28th, 1899. DEAR MOTHER:\\n\\nYou sent me such a good letter about the visit of the three selected chorus girls.  But what was best, was about your wishing to see me.  Of course, you know that I feel that too.  I would have it so that we all lived here, so that Dad could fish, and Nora and Cecil could discuss life, and you and I could just take walks and chat.  But because that cannot be, we are no further away than we ever were and when the pain to see you comes, I don't let it hurt and I don't kill it either for it is the sweetest pain I can feel.  If sons will go off and marry, or be war-correspondents, or managers, it does not mean that Home is any the less Home.  You can't wipe out history by changing the name of a boulevard, as somebody said of the French, and if I were able to be in two places at once, I know in which two places I would be here with Cecil at Marion, and at Home in the Library with you and Dad and The Evening Telegraph, and Nora and Van Bibber.  You will never know how much I love you all and you must never give up trying to comprehend it. God bless you and keep you, and my love to you every minute and always.\\n\\nDICK.\\n\\nLate in January, 1900, Richard and his wife started on their first great adventure together to the Boer War.  Arriving at Cape Town, Richard left his wife there and, acting as correspondent with the British forces for the New York Herald and London Mail, saw the relief of Ladysmith.  After this he returned to Cape Town, with the intention of joining Lord Roberts in his advance on Pretoria.  But on arriving at Cape Town he learned that Lord Roberts did not intend to move for three weeks, and so decided to say farewell to the British army and to return to London in a leisurely and sightseeing fashion along the east coast.  It was after they were well started on this return voyage that Richard conceived the idea of leaving the ship at Durban, going to Pretoria, and, as he expressed it, \\\"watch the Boers fighting the same men I had just seen fighting them.\\\"\\n\\nR. M. S. Scot February 4th, 1900. DEAR MOTHER:\\n\\nA great change has come since I wrote you from Madeira.  We are now on Summer seas and have regulated the days so that they pass very pleasantly--not that we do not want to be on land-- I never so much wanted it-- Somers is with us and is such a comfort.  He is even younger than he used to be and so quick and courteous and good tempered.  He is like a boy off on a holiday-- I think he is very much in love with his wife, but in spite of himself he is glad to get a holiday, and like all of us he will be so much more glad when he is homeward bound.  They threatened to shut us out of our only chance of putting foot on land at Madeira-- In the first place, we were so delayed by the storm that we arrived at eight o'clock at night, so that we missed seeing it in its beauty of flowers and palms.  And then it was so rough that they said it was most unsafe for us to attempt to go ashore.  It was a great disappointment but I urged that every one loved his own life, and if the natives were willing to risk theirs to sell us photographs and wicker baskets it was probably safer than it looked-- So we agreed to die together, and with Somers got our rain coats, and the three of us leaped into a row boat pulled by two Portugese pirates and started off toward a row of lamps on a quay that seemed much lower than the waves.  The remainder on the ship watched us disappear with ominus warnings-- We really had a most adventurous passage--towards shore the waves tossed us about like a lobster pot and we just missed being run down by a coal barge and escaped an upset over the bow anchor chain of a ship.  It was so close that both Somers and I had our coats off and I told Cecil to grab the chain-- But we weathered it and landed at a high gangway cut in the solid rock the first three steps of which were swamped by the waves.  A rope and chain hung from the top of the wharf and a man swung his weight on this and yanked us out to the steps as the boat was on the wave.  The rain beat and the wind roared and beautiful palms lashed the air with their fronds-- It was grand to get on shore once again-- At the end of the wharf we were hustled into a sled on steel runners, like a hearse with curtains around it and drawn by bullocks-- The  streets were all of mosaic, thousands of little stones being packed together like corn on a cob.  Over this the heavy sledge was drawn by the bullocks while a small boy ran ahead through the narrow streets to clear the way-- He had a feather duster made of horse's tail as a badge of authority and he yelled some strange cry at the empty streets and closed houses.  Another little boy in a striped jersey ran beside and assured us he was a guide.  It was like a page out of a fairy story.  The strange cart sliding and slipping over the stones which were as smooth as ice, and the colored house fronts and the palms and strange plants.  The darkness made it all the more unreal-- There was a governor's palace buttressed and guarded by sentinels in a strange uniform and queer little cafe's under vines--and terraces of cannon, and at last a funny, pathetic little casino.  It was such a queer imitation of Aix and Monte Carlo-- There were chasseurs and footmen in magnificent livery and stucco white walls ornamented with silk SHAWLS.  Also a very good band and a new roulette table-- Coming in out of the night and the rain it was like a theatre after the \\\"dark scene\\\" has just passed-- There were some most dignified croupiers and three English women and a few sad English men and some very wicked looking natives in diamonds and white waistcoats.  We had only fifteen minutes to spare so we began playing briskly with two shilling pieces Cecil with indifferent fortune and Somers losing-- But I won every time and the croupiers gave me strange notes of the Bonco de Portugal which I put back on the board only to get more of a larger number-- I felt greatly embarrassed as I was not a real member of the club and I hated to blow in out of a hurricane and take their money and sail away again-- So I appealed to one of the sad eyed Englishmen and he assured me it was all right, that they welcomed the people from the passing steamers who generally left a few pounds each with the bank.  But the more I spread the money the more I won until finally the whole room gathered around.  Then I sent out and ordered champagne for everybody and spare gold to all the waiters and still cashed in seventy-five dollars in English money.  It was pretty good for fifteen minutes and we went out leaving the people open-eyed, and hitting the champagne bottles-- It was all a part of the fun especially as with all our gold we could get nothing for supper but \\\"huevos frite\\\" which was all the Spanish I could remember and which meant fried eggs-- But we were very wet and hungry and we got the eggs and some fruit and real Madeira wine and then rowed out again rejoicing.  The pirates demanded their pay half way to the boat while we were on the high seas but they had struck the very wrong men, and I never saw a mutiny quelled so abruptly-- Somers and I told them we'd throw them overboard and row ourselves and they understood remarkably well-- The next day we were the admired and envied of those who had not had the nerve \\\"to dare to attempt.\\\"  It was one of the best experiences altogether we ever had and I shall certainly put Madeira on my silver cup.\\n\\nRICHARD.\\n\\nAfter their arrival at Cape Town, where Richard arranged for his wife to stay during his absence at the British front, he started for Ladysmith, sailing on the same vessel on which he had left England.\\n\\nFebruary 18th, 1900 board Scot. DEAR MOTHER:\\n\\nI got off yesterday and am hoping to get to Buller before Ladysmith is relieved.  I could not get to go with Roberts because Ralph has been here four months and has borne the heat and burden of the day, so although I only came in order to be with Roberts and Kitchener I could not ask to have Ralph recalled-- They wanted me with Roberts and I wanted it but none of us could make up our minds to turn down Ralph.  So I am going up on this side track on the chance of seeing Ladysmith relieved and of joining Roberts with Buller later.  I shall be satisfied if I see Ladysmith fall.  Fortunately I am to do a great deal of cabling for The Mail every day and that counts much more with the reading public than letters--\\n\\nCape Town is a dusty, wind ridden western town with a mountain back of it which one man said was a badly painted back drop-- The only attractive thing about the town is this mountain and a hotel situated at its base in perfectly beautiful gardens.  Here Cecil is settled.  I got her a sitting room and a big bedroom and The Mail agent or Pryor pays her $150 a week and will take good care of her.  It really is a beautiful and comfortable hotel and grounds and she has made many friends, and also I forced a pitch battle with a woman who was rude to her when we visited the hospital-- So, as the hospital people were very keen to have me see and praise their hospital they have taken up arms against the unfortunate little bounder and championed Cecil and me.  Cecil had really nothing to do with it as you can imagine-- She only laughed but I gave the lady lots to remember.\\n\\nOn the other hand every one is as kind and interested in Cecil as can be.  Mrs. Waldron whose son is Secretary to Milner and his secretary were more than polite to each of us.  Milner spent the whole evening we were there talking to Cecil and not to the lady we had had the row with, which was a pleasing triumph.  He sent me unsolicited a most flattering personal letter to the Governor of Natal, saying that I had come to him with my strong letters but that he had so enjoyed meeting me that he wished to pass me on on his own account.  Cecil asked me what it was I had talked so much to him about and I asked her if it were possible she couldn't guess that of course I would be telling him how to run the colony.  My advice was to bombard Cape Town and make martial law, for the Cape Towners are the most rotten, cowardly lot of rebels I ever imagined as being possible.  He seemed so glad to find any one who appreciated that it was a queen's colony in name only and said, \\\"Mr. Davis, it is as bad as this--I can take a stroll with you from these gardens (we were at the back of the Government House) and at the end of our stroll we will be in hostile territory.\\\"\\n\\nWe spent the last day after I had got my orders to join Buller (who seemed very pleased to have me) calling on the officials for passes together and they were in a great state falling into their coats and dressing guard for her and were all so friendly and hearty.  The Censor seems to think I am a sort of Matthew Arnold and should be wrapped in cotton, so does Pryor The Mail agent who apologizes for asking me to cable, which is just what I want to do.  They are very generous and are spending money like fresh air.  I am to cable letters to Cape Town, only to save three days.  So, now all that is needed is for something to happen.  Everything else is arranged.  All I want is to see three or four good fights and a big story like the relief of Ladysmith and I am ready and anxious to get home.  I shall observe them from behind an ant hill--I don't say this to please you but because I mean it.  This is not my war and all I want is to earn the very generous sums I have been offered and get home.  We are just off Port Elizabeth.  I will go on shore and post this there.  With all love. DICK.\\n\\nDeal's Central Hotel, East London. February 20th, 1900. DEAR MOTHER:\\n\\nWe are stopping at every port now, as though the Scot were a ferry boat.  We came over the side to get here in baskets with a neat door in the side and were bumped to the deck of the tender in all untenderness.  This is more like Africa than any place I have seen.  The cactus and palms abound and the Kaffirs wear brass anklets and bracelets.  A man at lunch at this hotel asked me if I was R. H. D. and said he was an American who had got a commission in Brabants horse-- He gave me the grandest sort of a segar and apparently on his representation the hotel brought me two books to sign, marked \\\"Autographs of Celebrities of the Boer War.\\\"  It seemed in my case at least to be premature and hopeful.\\n\\nGood luck and God bless you.  This will be the last letter you will get for ten days or two weeks, as I am now going directly away from steamers.  This one reaches you by a spy gentleman who is to give it to Rene Bull of The Graphic and who will post it in Cape Town-- He and all the other correspondents are abandoning Buller for Roberts.  Let 'em all go.  The fewer the better, I say.  My luck will keep I hope. DICK.\\n\\nImperial Hotel, Maritzburg, Natal. Feb. 23rd, 1900. DEAR MOTHER:--\\n\\nI reached Durban yesterday.  They paraded the band in my honour and played Yankee Doodle indefinitely-- I had corrupted them by giving them drinks to play the \\\"Belle of New York\\\" nightly.  The English officers thought Yankee Doodle was our national anthem and stood with their hats off in a hurricane balancing on the deck of the tender on one foot-- The city of Durban is the best I have seen.  It was as picturesque as the Midway at the Fair-- There were Persians, Malay, Hindoo, Babu's Kaffirs, Zulu's and soldiers and sailors.  I went on board the Maine to see the American doctors--one of them said he had met me on Walnut Street, when he had nearly run me down with his ambulance from the Penna Hospital.  Lady Randolph took me over the ship and was very much puzzled when all the hospital stewards called me by name and made complimentary remarks.  It impressed her so much apparently that she and the American nurses I hadn't met on board came to see me off at the station, which was very friendly.  I have had a horrible day here and got up against the British officer in uniform and on duty bent-- The chief trouble was that none of them knew what authority he had to do anything--and I had to sit down and tell them.  I wonder with intelligence like theirs that their Intelligence Department did not tell them the Boers fought with war clubs and spears.  I bought a ripping pony and my plan is to cut away from all my magnificent equipment and try to overtake Buller before he reaches Ladysmith and send back for the heavy things later.  It is just a question of minutes really and it seems hard to have come 1500 miles and then to miss it by an hour-- I arrive at Chievely tomorrow at five--that is only ten miles from where Buller is to night, so were it not for their d----d regulations I could ride across country and join them by midday but I bet they won't let me and I also bet I'll get there in time.  Of course you'll, know before you see this.  Marelsburg is the capital and its chief industry is rickshaw's pulled by wild Kaffi's, with beads and snake skins around them and holes in their ears into which they stick segars and horn spoons for dipping snuff.  The women wear less than the men and have their hair done up in red fungus.\\n\\nWell, love to you all, to Nora and Dad and Chas, and God bless you.\\n\\n[ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/77](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/77)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639126343,\"title\":\"\\nI hope you are not annoyed about Jaggers.
