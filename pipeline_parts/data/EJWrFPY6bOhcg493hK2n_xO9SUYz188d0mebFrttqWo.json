"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*This post is the PRD for [Paymagic](https://polygon.paymagic.xyz/), a hackathon project built as part of EthOnline. A ‚ÄúPRD‚Äù is a Product Requirements Document that described a customer problem in an emerging market, proposes a set of features that meets their need, and provides tangible criteria for measuring success and enabling future product iterations.*\\n\\n*If you have a new crypto product ideaüí°, reach out to [@0xviabull](https://twitter.com/0xViabull) or [apply here](https://airtable.com/shrmAbN0ZVHBexScl) for us to create a PRD for your idea.*\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5_BeMfrvpvQFyLm6BeImS.png?height=242&width=1024)\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nPaymagic empowers DAOs and crypto teams to send specialized crypto payments, like batch transfers, vesting schedules, streaming, escrow, airdrops, etc, deployed to any EVM compatible blockchain or L2s.\\n\\n## Problem\\n\\nBlockchains are frequently used for executing special crypto payments, but there‚Äôs no simple application for managing them all in one place. DAOs and crypto teams need developers to deploy contracts and execute payments, rather than allowing the finance or ops team to handle these tasks.\\n\\n## Target Users\\n\\n* **DAOs & crypto teams** want to send specialized crypto payments to reward contributors, pay contractors, issue vesting tokens, and more.\\n* **Crypto savvy users** want to easily get paid in crypto for their contributions.\\n\\n![From Cooper Turley & Carlos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zVkGU9u09Q3F13L1e-Zi-.png?height=505&width=898)\\n\\n## Description\\n\\nThe market for DAO tools is exploding! üöÄ  And they need simple payment tools for sending a variety of smart contract-enabled payments for their operations but no single, easy-to-use app exists for them. L2s and sidechains open up more usage of crypto payments since the gas cost and transaction time are greatly reduced. Paymagic operates at the intersection of all these trends and seeks to provide the best tools and user experience to support the growth of these markets.\\n\\n**Initial payment types:**\\n\\n* **Disperse** - Send tokens to multiple recipients at once\\n  * Great for rewarding followers or paying contributors\\n* **Vesting** - Create a token vesting schedule for a recipient\\n  * Great for vesting tokens over time to your team or investors\\n* **Stream** - Send tokens continuously by the second\\n  * Create real-time subscriptions, salaries, or vesting\\n* **Airdrop** - Send token rewards for recipients to claim\\n  * Reward liquidity providers, users, or communities\\n\\n![Payment Types](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/P9AwO-_G8oHZ6qbgZQBQp.png?height=185&width=748)\\n\\n**Initial network support:**\\n\\n* [Mainnet](https://mainnet.paymagic.xyz/)\\n* [Polygon](https://polygon.paymagic.xyz/)\\n* [Kovan](https://kovan.paymagic.xyz/)\\n\\n### Success Metrics\\n\\n* Complete user testing with DAOs and crypto teams to use the application for their operations\\n  * Documented conversation with 5 teams\\n  * Document 3-5 key learnings from user interviews\\n* Working web app prototype deployed to Polygon\\n  * No critical bugs\\n  * Average 5 transactions initiated through the web app each week\\n\\n## Solution\\n\\nWe built the Paymagic web app to meet the needs of DAOs and crypto teams. We hope you‚Äôll give it a try, send some transactions on Polygon or Kovan, and give us your feedback!\\n\\nFor any usage or user feedback, we‚Äôll be compensating you with future tokens or NFTs as the project matures. Send your user feedback here! üôè\\n\\n![Paymagic app v0.3](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bOsj1RBRjQ-ZN56v92G6c.png?height=738&width=936)\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nPaymagic was developed by David Eiber, Seth Feibus, and Corbin Page. We hope to onboard more team members and build the project into a DAO over time.\\n\\n### Product Backlog\\n\\n* Gnosis Safe support\\n* Better network switching\\n* New Payment types\\n  * NFT Airdrops\\n  * Private transactions\\n  * Different Escrow contracts\\n* New networks\\n  * BSC\\n  * Optimism\\n  * Arbitrum\\n\\n## Thanks To\\n\\nPaymagic was inspired by the ideas and creations of projects like Disperse.app, SuperFluid, Sabler, MerkleDrops, and many many more. üôè\\n\\nThanks to users, DAOs, SMEs that informed the project and contributed to its development. We hope you‚Äôll eventually join the DAO going forward. üí∏‚ú®\\n\\n![Standing on the shoulders of giants](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ABp9qSh1BFRYSSSGFKtCI.png?height=1392&width=2184)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633633875,\"title\":\"PRD: Paymagic  üí∏‚ú®\",\"publication\":\"launch\"},\"digest\":\"O1oq8NaGXX55ZA4PEqHdylgjZGwfAX5js8A7CGgKxFg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x869eC00FA1DC112917c781942Cc01c68521c415e\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PAr0OUZjzYm4yU9isScHb_6_DafdCakbb2t2WaCRSHI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8OhSFb99YGsXZU6w2DzgS_uqgv5_bxS9OguWpn_GD-U\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"HYIxxOc093qntJtNNF6fMQyWby0S72PMh0dSBAsRIiNsMd1sl0cYH8gYm4cr98iZDANtfDfbivhbY-fMyrvPCg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x3c24aa1ceffbf62c09ce5423b7d7ad40cf6ca72cedf060ca5075d255ee773a0929be521d4e3c035f8ca8324b8f8365db42fadaff98d63c48bb43e2fe265f888f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on launch.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PAr0OUZjzYm4yU9isScHb_6_DafdCakbb2t2WaCRSHI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8OhSFb99YGsXZU6w2DzgS_uqgv5_bxS9OguWpn_GD-U\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"tkvx9MAcsuSag0l5fa_7CmRTKyPSlyRtrMHulwknMUw\"}"
