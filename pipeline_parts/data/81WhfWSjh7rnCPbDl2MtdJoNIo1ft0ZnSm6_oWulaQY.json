"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*In this post, I will put on my shilling cap, and will attempt to shill the Sushi Token. So gear up to learn more about Sushiswap, why it may be a smart investment. Remember, I am a random Flipsider, and **none of what I mention is financial advice**, and can’t stress this enough, but **Do Your Own Research.** As I am shilling, I will strategically leave out vital information that might push you away from Sushi, cause that’s what shillers do !!!*\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nIn the last days of February 2020, Compound, the lending behemoth on Ethereum announced plans to go completely Decentralized by allowing the community to vote on the governance of the protocol by the launch of its own governance token.\\n\\nIt kickstarted the OG DEFI Summer, which saw a lot of popular protocols on Ethereum launch their own governance tokens. Around this time, Uniswap was the premier DEX. However, Uniswap was funded by Centralized VC firms, and in early August, Series A funding of 11 Million USD was announced.\\n\\nIt was around this time, with Decentralization and Venture Capitalism at crossroads, **[chefNomi](https://twitter.com/nomichef)** decided to take advantage of the Open Source nature of Uniswap and add some extra features and deploy it as Sushiswap. One of the major features of Sushiswap was Yield Farming SUSHI tokens. These SUSHI tokens were to be distributed to Liquidity Providers. The SUSHI token was to act as the governance token of the Protocol, thus making Sushiswap Community Owned DEX when compared to VC-funded Uniswap. It was a classical case of Decentralization ETHOs being put in a war. It was this Community Owned nature that brought in **[0xMaki](https://twitter.com/0xMaki)**\\n\\nSushiswap bootstrapped its Liquidity Pools by allowing Users to Deposit Uniswap Liquidity Tokens (tokens that represent the Liquidity deposited in Uniswap) in order to get SUSHI Tokens. This would lead to the conversion of UNI LP tokens to SUSHI LP tokens on the main-net release. This lead to the infamous Sushiswap Vampire Mining of Uniswap Liquidity. In less than a week, Uniswap's TVL halved. Sushiswap demonstrated the true power of incentives.\\n\\nThe following week, Disaster struck, with Ethereum prices crashing almost 30%, chefNomi decided to sell his share of Sushi tokens at the market, which lead to many people calling it a rug-pull or exit scam. Although chefNomi regretted the action, apologized, and returned the Funds, it was a major blow for David in its battle against the Goliath.\\n\\nHowever, chefNomi transferred protocol control to Alameda Research **Sam Bankman Fried**. **Sam Bankman Fried**, along with **0xMaki** guided Sushiswap through this chaos as it rebounded from the darkness into a mainstay in Ethereum. Along with other community-owned protocols like Yearn, AAVE, with **20+ core contributors**, **5 DeFi products** under a single ecosystem over **10+ EVM compatible chains**, Sushi has truly arisen from its ashes into a DeFi competitor, fighting Behemoths on all fronts. With Shoyu and Trident in the works, the future looks bright for the Sushiswap ecosystem.\\n\\nIn this context, is SUSHI still a good choice for investment? Let us find out.\\n\\n## Products\\n\\nSushiswap has 5 major DeFi products right now :\\n\\n* **Automated Market Maker** - DEX\\n* **Bentobox** - Smart Contract layer for gas-efficient Dapps\\n* **Kashi** - Lending and Borrowing protocol on top of BentoBox\\n* **SushiBar** - Passive distributed protocol income from staking Sushi\\n* **Onsen** - SUSHI token yield farming for community elected Protocols\\n\\n### AMM\\n\\nThe AMM is the most important part of Sushiswap and allows swapping of ETH or ERC-20 tokens to ERC-20 tokens or ETH. Forked from Uniswap v-2, Sushiswap is the 2nd largest AMM on Ethereum mainnet.\\n\\n```\\n<iframe src=\\\"https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/velocity/visuals/4ce20560-17b3-4b27-869b-ac3e55a276c0/fb38ecc5-7e61-445a-9b7f-8214e35ccac5\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"600\\\"></iframe>\\n```\",\"timestamp\":1640787210,\"title\":\"Sushi Moon?\"},\"digest\":\"G1GD9Evxni5ONp3PK0VxU6Psw8Y4oDGELPNIAJ0UV5Q\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x364F7Fd945B8c76C3C77d6ac253f1fEa3B65E00d\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"6MGjF9XTICOjmtVElqYUamJ6U_Hz7MIAN42Qs9NXxpc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"lu0fLsjhTt5mIfds2Njv6cLjqagdmh1Trwj3YYdVr94\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"sx5GWqxYQts2dIVGNscXK771m3QlLNF6MBsuHxbI0DjYpSBj3b6eLzAkEFQhSMFoxE5Tdb5uO0oa1S42kDHl7A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x06eede118abad5a2d06bca3c472afaade44132011a81e920c2850888d6ead5b244323a26c6c9ba98440ca51d6e1c1695d692a496d25b60283091df57e98904dd1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"6MGjF9XTICOjmtVElqYUamJ6U_Hz7MIAN42Qs9NXxpc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"lu0fLsjhTt5mIfds2Njv6cLjqagdmh1Trwj3YYdVr94\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"J7avg_gikeN3pdm2rtLWEKU6QTbrObCs65rqxsTbmYA\"}"
