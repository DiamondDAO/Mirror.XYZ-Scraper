"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I hope this article will bring you value and help you begin your cryptocurrency’s journey\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*o4B0xbYSEXTXINqk2vWluA.png)\\n\\nSome coins you will meet during your journey\\n\\nDecember 2020. My cousin starts sending me updates about the cryptocurrency markets. I watched videos about bitcoin 2 years ago. I was not really interested in it at that time. What caught my eyes during those updates in how the market fluctuated.\\n\\nAt that time, bitcoin just passed $25k. I didn’t understand why it keep going up and down. I needed to go deeper. I kept digging. I started watching Youtube videos about financial markets, trading basics, and blockchain/currency explanations. It was eye-opening.\\n\\nFrom then, I started my journey with cryptocurrencies. I started with $2.\\n\\nFrom there, my journey was a rollercoaster trip :\\n\\n* Tesla bought some bitcoin\\n* Beeple sold his NFTs for 69 million dollars\\n* China cracks down miners in their country\\n* Tesla stops accepting bitcoin\\n* The market crashed in May 2021\\n* El Salvador accepts bitcoin as a legal tender\\n\\nEvery single one of these events had an effect on the market.\\n\\nWhat kind of effect?\\n\\nLemme show you.\\n\\n## Understand market moves\\n\\n![Psychology of market cycle from Binance](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*dqswBfaNfUiTgEnL)\\n\\nI went through all of those phases.\\n\\nPrices of assets go down and up depending on the market.\\n\\nA definition of a market is where people meet and exchange value.\\n\\nFor example :\\n\\n* in the stock market, people exchange shares with money.\\n* in the bond market where participants can issue new [debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt), known as the [primary market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_market), or buy and sell debt [securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)), known as the [secondary market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_market).\\n\\nAnd now, the crypto market: you buy coins in exchange for fiat.\\n\\nThe number of people buying coins and the amount of people selling determines the market moves.\\n\\nYou can analyze the market move using two factors :**Technical analysis**: look at the chart for different indicators of a pattern.\\n\\n![Typical chart view from tradingview.com](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*cv5HQb6Cs3pVe2ua.png)\\n\\n**Fundamental analysis**: looks at the bigger picture, regulation, market cap, other news, or issues around a specific market. This methodology looks at the BTC value for example, as a technology regardless of the current price and its outside prices in order to determine what will happen.\\n\\nWith the understanding of these two basics analysis of market moves, lemme explain the market conditions.\\n\\n**Bull market :**\\n\\n![The psychological effect of a bull market](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*z1G_i7F-Q52Lca6tDdnrFA.png)\\n\\nA [bull market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp) is a market that is on the rise and where the conditions of the economy are generally favorable.\\n\\nA bull market is typified by a sustained increase in prices. In the case of equity markets, a bull market denotes a rise in the prices of companies’ shares. In such times, investors often have faith that the [uptrend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptrend.asp) will continue over the long term. In this scenario, the country’s economy is typically strong and employment levels are high.\\n\\nIn the case of the crypto market, it means the price per coin (in $) is going up.\\n\\n**Bear market :**\\n\\n![The psychological effect of a bear market](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*2XvHswIwpRSPX902IWdwMg.png)\\n\\nA bear market exists in an economy that is receding and where most stocks are declining in value.\\n\\nA [bear market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp) is one that is in decline. A market is usually not considered a true “bear” market unless it has fallen 20% or more from recent highs. In a bear market, share prices are continuously dropping. This results in a downward trend that investors believe will continue; this belief, in turn, perpetuates the downward spiral. During a bear market, the economy slows down and unemployment rises as companies begin laying off workers.\\n\\nin the case of the crypto market, the price per coin is going down.\\n\\nBecause the financial markets are greatly influenced by investors’ attitudes, these terms also denote how investors feel about the market and the ensuing economic trends :\\n\\n> You are bullish if you believe that an asset will increase in price;\\n>\\n> You are bearish otherwise.\\n\\nNow you understand the basics of market moves, let’s jump into the cryptocurrency market.\\n\\n## Cryptocurrency as an investment\\n\\nInvesting is different from trading.\\n\\n> Trading means you are for the short term market move. You take profit as soon as the market move the way you predict it. If you open a position saying the trend is going up (meaning you are taking a long position), once it does, you take profit. If not, you lose. If you open a position saying the trend is going down (meaning you are taking the short position), once it does, you take your profit. If not you lose\\n\\nLike I said in [my recent article](https://medium.com/coinmonks/beginner-guide-for-first-time-nfts-buyers-2021-7abecb8dd059), Bitcoin was created in the context of an economic crisis. Satoshi Nakamoto quotes :\\n\\n***The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible*.**\\n\\nThis was the beginning of a long road.\\n\\nIn 2008, an anonymous person called Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin. It’s money on the Internet, without banks, without a middle man.\\n\\n**First, what is money?**\\n\\nMoney is often defined in terms of the three **functions** or **services** that it provides :\\n\\n* **Medium of exchange**: Money’s most important function is as a medium of exchange to ease transactions. Without money, all transactions would have to be conducted by **barter.** It involves the direct exchange of one good or service for another.\\n* **Store of value:** To be a medium of exchange, money must hold its value over time; that is, it must be a store of value. Otherwise, money could not be stored for some period and remain valuable in exchange.\\n* **Unit of account**: Money also functions as a unit of account, providing a *common measure of the value* of goods and services being exchanged.\\n\\nHow did Satoshi manage to create “Internet money” with these functions?\\n\\nHe leveraged something called **Blockchain**.\\n\\nBlockchain is a register where every transaction is recorded. Its characteristics :\\n\\n* **Immutability**: No possibility to make a change on the register once data is in the ledger.\\n* **Decentralized**: No one owns the technology, it’s shared among the users.\\n* **Anonymity**: You don’t need to give your credentials, a random password is given to you only.\\n* **Security**: It’s almost impossible to hack because of the density of the network.\\n\\nWith it, Satoshi made Bitcoin. No possibility to double spend. A store of value. A medium of exchange. A unit of account. All combined using blockchain and cryptography.\\n\\nSince then, Bitcoin has exploded. After 13 years, a unit of bitcoin is now worth between $30k and $65k depending on the demand.\\n\\nIn 2015, a group of 8 persons figured out they can do more things with the blockchain: ***they can build some kind of contract on top of it***.\\n\\nGiven the fact that the blockchain is a register, what you put on it depends on the writer of the code. If they can figure out a way to codify functions and put it on the blockchain, they will have another use case.\\n\\n> And they made it. Ethereum was born.\\n\\nYou can create your coin(or token) like Bitcoin, determine the max supply, and release it in under 5 min, using something called **“Smart contract”**: lines of codes you write and deploy on the blockchain.\\n\\nIn January 2021, I programmed the first token I called “Wetchit” which means “spare change”. I couldn’t believe it. It took me less than 5 min :\\n\\n* I went on Youtube\\n* Research “How to create a coin with Ethereum”\\n* I watched the tutorial\\n* Click on the Github link\\n* Copy the code\\n* Paste it on [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)\\n* I change the name of the token\\n* Define the max supply, the abbreviation of the token name, the divisibility, and leave the rest unchanged.\\n\\nDone. I compile it. No error.\\n\\nNow, I connect my Metamask and it was ready to deploy.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I didn’t have enough Ethereum to pay gas fees.\\n\\nBut I had the option to test the coin on Kovan Test Network. I was working well. I sent some tokens to different wallets.\\n\\nI was like “WOW, this is the next thing”.\\n\\nDo you see how easy it was to create a token in under 5 min, with an open-source program?\\n\\nThat’s why you need to know some statistics.\\n\\n## Macro view of the cryptocurrency market\\n\\nHere are the statistics in 09/21/2021, based on Coinmarketcap:\\n\\n* [12,037](https://coinmarketcap.com/) cryptocurrencies\\n* [$1,828,977,121,702](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/) market cap\\n* [$139,985,252,175](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/) 24h volume\\n\\n12,037 coins !!!!!!! That’s 66.8722222222 times the number of fiat currencies.\\n\\nKnowing cryptocurrency market follows the same market rules, how do you choose the best ones to invest in?\\n\\nFirst, every coin has a cycle, like the figure from Binance above. We can group them into two categories :\\n\\n* Bitcoin season\\n* Altcoin (all coins different from BTC) season\\n\\nWith the data record, scientists develop a model for the evolution of bitcoin, called the **Stock-To-Flow model**.\\n\\n![Stock-to-flow model of bitcoin](https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0\\\\*Xm_on3EwB4AOPcHP)\\n\\nIt represents the evolution of BTC since the beginning of its creation.\\n\\nOn the X-axis, you have Years, Y-axis you have the price per BTC.\\n\\nBitcoin has a 21 million coins supply. No more will be created.\\n\\n**If 75% of the Top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last 30 days it is Altcoin Month. Otherwise, it’s Bitcoin month.**\\n\\n**If 75% of the Top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last season (90 days) it is Altcoin Season. Otherwise, it’s Bitcoin season.**\\n\\n**If 75% of the Top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last year it is Altcoin Year. Otherwise, it’s Bitcoin year.**\\n\\nHere is an index to find out which season we are: [Blockchain Center index](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/altcoin-season-index/)\\n\\nThe macro view allows you to have a global view of the market.\\n\\n**Here is how to approach bitcoin and altcoin season from a macro perspective.**\\n\\nA great opportunity to invest in Bitcoin.\\n\\nCounterintuitive right?\\n\\nLemme explain.\\n\\nWhen you know everyone is buying a house from a specific location, what happen? Prices go up. You have then two choices :\\n\\n* FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): do whatever possible to have a slot for you (at a higher price with maybe a smaller slot because of the high demand)\\n* Research an alternative to the location, not far and with a lower price.\\n\\nThat’s the same strategy here.\\n\\nIf it’s altcoin season, it means bitcoin is undervalued in some way. It’s ‘cheap’.\\n\\nWhen you buy an asset when it’s cheap, it gives you leverage to take profit sooner, when you needed.\\n\\nSame concept here. You want to invest in cheap options. In this case, it’s altcoins.\\n\\nNow, how do you choose which altcoin to invest in?\\n\\nHere is my methodology I called: ***themetapick***\\n\\n## How to invest in altcoins using themetapick strategy\\n\\n**12,036** altcoins. That’s a lot.\\n\\nHow to wrap your head around those?\\n\\n**1-Understand blockchain**\\n\\n**2-Understand cryptocurrency market (I gave you an overview, but you need to go deeper)**\\n\\nBegin here: [100 Tools and References to Begin with Blockchain and Cryptoassets (2021)](https://medium.com/coinmonks/100-tools-and-references-to-begin-with-blockchain-and-cryptoassets-2021-9d7efb5b4797)\\n\\n> **Do you homework for at least 50 hours.**\\n\\nAfter that you should be able to answer these questions :\\n\\n* What is a blockchain?\\n* What is a market cycle?\\n* What is the difference between bitcoin and Ethereum?\\n* What is a support? What is a resistance?\\n* What is a wallet? How to secure a wallet?\\n* How to buy a coin? Where to buy a coin?\\n* How to transfer a coin?\\n* What is the difference between a cold wallet and a hot wallet?\\n* What is a seed phrase? What is the difference between a seed phrase and a password?\\n* What is the difference between Bitcoin and Dogecoin?\\n* What is the difference between Dogecoin and Shiba INU ?\\n* What is the difference between Ethreum and the coin built on top of Ethreum?\\n* What is a gas fee? What is a gas price? What is a gas?\\n* What is the definition of circulating supply? What is the difference between circulating supply and max supply?\\n* Why not buy a hardware wallet on Amazon or another third-party company? Why do you have to buy from the company making them?\\n* What is the best way to protect your coins?\\n* What is the best way to lose your coins?\\n* Why can’t you invest more than you can afford to lose?\\n\\nIf you cannot answer one of these questions after 50 hours, DM me on [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/themetaboy)or [Instagram](http://instagram.com/themetaboy), I will be happy to help.\\n\\nNow that you can answer all these questions. We can move forward.\\n\\nWhen It comes to investing, you have to consider 4 cases :\\n\\n***Low risk/low reward potential***: If you are a real risk-averse person, I suggest you look into the top 5 coins. You can find them on [Coinmarketcap](http://coinmarketcap.com/) or [coingecko](http://coingecko.com/).\\n\\n***Low Risk/High Potential reward:*** These are scams. When you don’t have something to lose, you are not investing. you are gambling.\\n\\n***High Risk/Low Potential reward:*** Think of it like digging a well, you go deeper and deeper, with all the risk, you finally find out there is a little quantity of groundwater. Worth the risk? Don’t know, maybe now you learned how to dig a well. In the case of cryptocurrencies, I may be a way to experiment.\\n\\n***High risk/high potential reward:*** Those are the ones you need to investigate and it will take time.\\n\\nif you are a high-risk/high reward-looking person, the rest is for you.\\n\\n## Level 1: All new beginner\\n\\n***1-Unique value proposition***\\n\\nIs it clear?
