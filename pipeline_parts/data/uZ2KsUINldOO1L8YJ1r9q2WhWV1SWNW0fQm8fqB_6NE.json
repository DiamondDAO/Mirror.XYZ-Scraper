"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Everyone knows that time moves differently in the crypto space. For us, 2021 began back in 2019…\\n\\n# Origins of Charged Particles\\n\\nIt was a warm day at ETH Waterloo and Rob Secord was musing about the idea of NFTs holding interest-bearing assets. Later, when he started thinking more seriously about this concept, he realized that eGift cards could be represented as NFTs with the ability to grow in value. One of the main things he was trying to solve at the time was enabling small businesses to receive revenue through gift cards so that they might keep their businesses open during slower times. For example, a $50 eGift card (as a NFT) = $25 stays in card earning interest through DeFi protocols, and $25 to the business immediately with store credit. By early 2020 [Charged Particles](https://charged.fi/) was conceived!\\n\\nIn February 2020 we got “[DeFiNFT](https://twitter.com/DefiNft)” as our Twitter handle — long before most were considering the intersection of DeFi and NFTs. Our co-founders Ben Lakoff and Rob Secord met during Kernel in July 2020. Then In October 2020 Ben and Rob went full force into Charged Particles.\\n\\nIn February 2020 we got our Twitter handle DeFiNFT\\n\\n![Charged Particles Twitter - Feb 2020](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PvTNTrsy-mWfzlptnmtiD.png?height=1010&width=1390)\\n\\n# Launch\\n\\nOur pre-seed funding round began in December 2020 closing at $750k in February when our protocol officially went live on mainnet. In the same month, we organized the [Big Bang](https://medium.com/charged-particles/the-big-bang-charged-particles-global-launch-party-art-drop-30eb4b9c66f) launch party in [Cryptovoxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/), one of the largest Metaverse events ever, where 100 ETH worth of NFTs were sold in an hour. February was an eventful month indeed!\\n\\nWe continued throwing these massive Metaverse events that drew thousands of participants including [Zero Gravity](https://medium.com/charged-particles/zero-gravity-charged-particles-art-drop-2-c8b07edfd051) in March 2021 where featured artist [Shytoshi Kusama](https://twitter.com/ShytoshiKusama) listed 5 NFTs for sale with 5 billion $SHIB nested in each (valued at around $175k each at time of writing. We also saw [IMT](https://medium.com/charged-particles/first-inversion-imt-album-launch-recap-cf868c51006d) sell an NFT-shirt for 2.5 ETH, making it one of the top ten most expensive t-shirts ever sold.\\n\\n![Our second big Metaverse event](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tOJL2FjYnV5fh1EobHsMk.png?height=787&width=1400)\\n\\nThis was followed by the launch of the [Pandora’s Box](https://medium.com/charged-particles/nested-nft-pandoras-box-sells-for-42-eth-19b86f124e28) Nested NFT in April 2021 created by The Guild which was sold for 42 ETH. In the beginning of May 2021 we closed our seed round at $1M, launched our IDO on [Polkastarter](https://polkastarter.com/) and listed IONX on [Uniswap](https://v2.info.uniswap.org/token/0x02d34fedbb6fdd46574f5db740bc96a6bb9c4217).\\n\\n![Pandoras Box nested NFT sells for 42 ETH. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1Y0rIzU8_7k6MRT1VHhQi.png?height=787&width=1400)\\n\\nThe summer brought with it a number of huge milestones including going live on [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), launching a liquidity rewards program for IONX staking, and crossing the 500 ETH mark in NFT sales.\\n\\n# Partnership\\n\\nThis year we have formed many strategic partnerships with a wide variety of different crypto and NFT related sub-sectors.\\n\\n![Charged Particles partnership ecosystem](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-mARqE-_DIpBQrhO6PneE.jpeg?height=628&width=1200)\\n\\n## Music\\n\\n[Unchained Music](http://unchainedmusic.io/), [Ashby Projects](http://ashbyprojects.com/), [Bars and Melody](https://twitter.com/barsandmelody), [Beacon Bloom](https://www.beaconbloom.com/), [Intro to Music Theory](https://www.introtomusictheory.com/)\\n\\nCreating a more balanced and equitable music industry is something that we are very passionate about.

Each of these have their own Guild structure moving towards complete DAO ownership with monthly stipends that are voted on by their members. Music, Gaming, Fashion, Restoration Ecology, Charity, and Visual Arts Guilds are continuously expanding exponentially.

In 2022 as we move towards decentralized community ownership, liquidity mining within NFTs, further development of tools and support (e.g. SDK / API) to integrate our protocol, as well as empowering artists and builders to innovate, community will remain the core focus of what we do. We’re in this together and this is only just the beginning!\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PzQ3Nay8FmQOpIodODBzV.png?height=466&width=1400)\\n\\n# About Charged Particles\\n\\n*Charged Particles is a protocol that allows users to deposit ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 tokens into NFTs. A scarce NFT (e.g. Art, Collectible, Virtual Real Estate, In-Game Item, etc.) can now be transformed into a basket holding a number of other tokens. The Principal amount can be time-locked inside the NFT, and through integration with [Aave’s aTokens](https://aave.com/aTokens), the programmable yield from these DeFi yield-generating assets is just a few clicks away.*\\n\\n# Stay in touch with Charged Particles\\n\\n[Website](http://charged.fi/) | [Docs](https://docs.charged.fi/) | [Telegram](https://t.me/chargedparticles) |[ Twitter](https://twitter.com/DefiNft) |[ ](https://github.com/BlindBoxesNFT)[Instagram](https://instagram.com/definft) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/HdRx4SBMDv) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/charged-particles) | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdFyFUS4FE_j977OZ4VKjaQ) | [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/chargedparticles) | [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@chargedparticles)\",\"timestamp\":1641431984,\"title\":\"A Year In Review — Charged Particles\"},\"digest\":\"Khc5sahjGnt9y25EmAs5gvPOoPVs7CBouuOzZsGkzdQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x436BAaDF3a43d8a3cAb2D64d5D09A2f3ca80F409\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"r8589ievSd-Sfcc6YAm8yoMR_hRGME2_yzuFkloV4FA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"A-pfonBrf6pJocZ1kHGXUa_cEtCHKbmw8ATR5PkyRZI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"owpttK3A6k2JOXnmKVOVZp5ceHKrA5euaQCDsRtqgx-LVAsgeeZB-FSPKl8Bxw2sFIa_5F4YLhQQ5i1wAl60ag\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x72d88bed58906c7c786582597cfc429e3b9d9d5bad77a1185baed60068ce2d896172c1361f00cfa23991866e7fc4f2b67f88b51b565eaf8b282b7f833f86f39d1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"r8589ievSd-Sfcc6YAm8yoMR_hRGME2_yzuFkloV4FA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"A-pfonBrf6pJocZ1kHGXUa_cEtCHKbmw8ATR5PkyRZI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Khc5sahjGnt9y25EmAs5gvPOoPVs7CBouuOzZsGkzdQ\"}"
