"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Tonight was the first showing of the opera ''La Traviata''（ The Lost Lady ）at Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Memorial Hall. The Chinese performers were singing the western opera. As the crowd of people grew outside at seven-thirty, my excitement grew, too. Some people wore fancy clothes, but most people wore clean, comfortable ones. In the hall we were seated close to the musicians below the stage. They played exceptionally well. And when the singing started, we lost track of the time and place. The costumes and stage settings, and the music and singing were beautiful. The program lasted three memorable hours.\",\"timestamp\":1639031265,\"title\":\"Going to the Opera\"},\"digest\":\"dfA0AOmNkaAz9CU0nnK8LSC_UqHIV9b_8i1YFlBAd4E\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3bE82185b1DDE598407beB9d7ae6a0c6150b7e69\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eCgxCH4MJ2aU5QZTBV6Z1N1rQmXrQDxT7Ke_h5SKDw4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1ZL4E0_7fLak2rvRhap442BGKXbtxJOdNAA2S8mQMKQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"uqVmP2EbbF5fCJfx-Do1_eMeUN5SKa46QP5xKPqBm1W_gk_tSVqcGfKxFcrm66CVbiLeUeY-A_u5kslEivaGNA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x36902fc3656e01d9298ecfc0f104f875854e63ce14186f4fcb74ee4e9d1aaa4b7502c93e9c609cca1baa0a6ab7e8741362a3974db9437cf63c87dada19e5db231b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eCgxCH4MJ2aU5QZTBV6Z1N1rQmXrQDxT7Ke_h5SKDw4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1ZL4E0_7fLak2rvRhap442BGKXbtxJOdNAA2S8mQMKQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"dfA0AOmNkaAz9CU0nnK8LSC_UqHIV9b_8i1YFlBAd4E\"}"
