This is why Mundo Lingo is remembered, appreciated and cellebrated. This is why people want to have Mundo Lingo in their cities. Manager’s work is not always visible but it’s the reason why people keep coming. Nothing less than that.\\n\\n## So… what’s that, again?\\n\\nThese are the things a Manager is in charge of:\\n\\n* Make sure everything at the venue is organized and ready to start the event (yes, that means arriving earlier).\\n* Be kind, nice and polite with everybody. Stablishing good relations with the venue staff and ML team is not only good but essential. Managers are the face of the organization.\\n* During the event, the enviroment must be kept up to Mundo Lingo standards. That means temperature, volume music, lights intensity, service quality, etc.\\n* Make sure the reception table staff is performing well. That the “speech” is being said with a smile, that people is getting the attention they need.\\n* Make sure the Ambassadors feel comfortable and have what they need. Offer them a drink and bring it. Listen to what they have to say. Count on them.\\n* Make sure the photographer arrives and provide for what he/she needs.\\n* Check around, chat with the people. Know the community and be present at every corner of the event. Be aware.\\n* Once the event is finishing, Managers have to collect the receipts and take the payment (that night or the following days).\\n* Count the flags delivered to have the number of people that attended the event.\\n* Get in touch with associates and promote the event so it gets more and more successful each week.\\n* Moderate the social networks to ensure also a good online experience.\\n* Receive and upload the photographs of the event.\\n* Manage the flagsheet stock so there’s always enough of each language per event.\\n* Manage the finances of the event: paying for supplies, services, fees.\\n\\n## How to get there?\\n\\nThere are some steps a Manager should take before becoming one.
