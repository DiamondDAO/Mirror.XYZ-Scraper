"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**tl/dr:** *We're a community of over 150 marketing and advertising professionals, from 100+ agencies, fortune 1,000 brands, and web3 startups.* \\n\\nIt seems like just yesterday we were at the beginning of the web2 era, with the promise of the democratization and removal of middlemen. \\n\\nIf you worked in the marketing or advertising field, the excitement of having a direct conversation and relationship with your customers was almost euphoric. \\n\\nHowever, that change never fully materialized. Just like independent creators, brands got the short end of the stick as web2 matured. Rather than investing marketing dollars into content, experiences, and events that create value for their customers, brands were forced to pay yet another rent seeking middleman. This time around those middlemen came in the form of Google, Facebook, and Amazon, the three largest advertising machines to ever exist. \\n\\n### A new future for marketing \\n\\nAs we look ahead to web3, those in the marketing and advertising industry are yet again excited about the prospect of having a direct relationship with their brand's customers—and, the removal of extractive middlemen isn't the only thing to get excited about with the rise of web3.\\n\\nThere are new models for brand architecture yet to be discovered. \\n\\nThe financial model for brand equity will be redefined. \\n\\nCommunity ownership will change how brands create and add value. \\n\\nDecentralized and ubiquitous creative story telling across a world of dapps will flip every customer journey and marketing funnel framework on its head. \\n\\nThere is no question that a brand building renaissance is upon us. \\n\\nAnd that's just the business-to-consumer side. The business-to-business, and soon, the DAO-to-DAO side of the marketing and advertising industry is set for a sea change like we've never before seen. \\n\\nJUMP is a manifestation of this change—the first tokenized community for marketing and advertising professionals.\\n\\nIn the mid-1990s the Internet Advertising Bureau was born. If you wanted to learn about building brands on the Internet, it made no sense to talk about it on the phone, or write newspaper articles about it. The natural step was to get hands-on by creating a website, a blog, and a newsletter. \\n\\nAs the social and mobile era of web2 emerged in the early 2000s, associations were created to help move the marketing and advertising industry forward once again.\\n\\nWe've reached a new inflection point. A next-generation community is needed to make the transition to web3. \\n\\nHowever, the traditional industry association model isn't adequate—it cannot teach us or solve for the needs of tomorrow. \\n\\nIn February of this year, JUMP joined [Seed Club's](https://medium.com/seedclub/11-new-projects-join-the-seed-club-social-token-incubator-sc02-33260e64f070#:~:text=Seed%20Club%2C%20the%20%E2%80%9CCrypto%20Y,and%20NFT%20pioneer%20Connie%20Digital.) second social token accelerator cohort to build a new framework for how a B2B industry community, with B2C dynamics, could come to life. \\n\\nToday, JUMP has over 150 members representing over 100+ advertising agencies, fortune 1,000 brands, and web3 startups.\\n\\nBy design, JUMP is a tokenized community that will learn, educate, and build using web3 fundamentals. This begins with the $JUMP token, our native access, rewards, and coordination mechanism. \\n\\n## JUMP's Mission\\n\\nWe imagine a world where the best creatives, strategists, project managers, brand managers, technologists, analysts, media planners, content creators, PR managers, and many more within the marketing and advertising industry have shared value creation through the $JUMP token.\\n\\n**Here's our roadmap:**\\n- Create a space for education, networking, and professional growth.\\n- Set industry best practices for web3's creative, marketing, and advertising services.  \\n- Fund, build, and contribute to web3's martech and adtech stack. \\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/jeffkauffmanjr/status/1417685491923759104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1417685491923759104%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Fquery%3Dhttps3A2F2Ftwitter.com2Fjeffkauffmanjr2Fstatus2F1417685491923759104widget%3DTweet\\n\\n- Use tokenomics and web3 fundamentals to build the JUMP community. \\n\\nCurrently, $JUMP tokens can only be earned through participation and value creation within the community. Never before have independent participants in the marketing and advertising industry been able to create and share value like this.\\n\\nIt's time to JUMP into web3.\\n\\n## Here's How You Can Get Involved\\n\\nAre you a PR professional?
