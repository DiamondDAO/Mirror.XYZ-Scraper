"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The way we value art, culture & community is changing before our eyes.\\n\\nWeb3 introduced digital ownership to the internet, opening the floodgates for creators to capture the value they create.\\n\\n**Today, we‚Äôre excited to unveil Bonfire, a platform that aims to unlock the power of ownership for online communities.**\\n\\n[https://trybonfire.xyz/](https://trybonfire.xyz/)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn the ownership economy, it‚Äôs not just creators benefitting - it‚Äôs their communities too. In fact, the very definition of a creator is changing. We‚Äôre observing a shift from a world where creators monetize individually *from* their fans, to one where they build wealth *with* their communities.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1454096372261609473?s=20](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1454096372261609473?s=20)\\n\\nIt's hard to overstate how profound a shift this is.\\n\\nAnd while the results thus far have been jaw-dropping, you don‚Äôt have to squint too hard to see that much of what‚Äôs driving these outcomes is unfettered speculation more than any form of real utility. And while a powerful tool when used appropriately, speculation alone is insufficient to create long-lasting communities. Today we're seeing communities built primarily on hype and FOMO, with vague assurances of *future* utility. This implicitly values speculators over engaged community members, uniting people around something transient and undependable (‚Äúnumber go up‚Äù) rather than the intrinsic motivators that have always been at the core of successful communities.\\n\\n**In the long-run, value will be driven by strong and lasting communities, not the other way around.**\\n\\nFor creators, engagement has always been predicated on utility, entertainment, and community. Fans invested their time, minds and hearts *for free*. Augmenting that with ownership and shared incentives is the revolutionary promise of web3. Replacing it with speculation is not.\\n\\nA problem we‚Äôve seen with current approaches is that communities can become disjointed when pure speculators share little overlap with fans that existed before. The end result is that instead of creating one community with aligned incentives, there‚Äôs a risk of creating fragmented pockets with misaligned incentives.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nSo why is this happening? Ultimately we see 2 main problems today:\\n\\n* **1) Most tokens can only be acquired via purchase**. This inherently favors speculators over true fans, and excludes those who have time, attention, or passion to give but not capital.\\n* **2) It‚Äôs hard to create real utility with today‚Äôs tools**. In its absence, there isn‚Äôt much to do with a token *but* to speculate. There are now hundreds of platforms to mint new tokens, and still few tools to unlock utility around all these new assets.\\n\\n**To create healthy and lasting communities, we need more ways to earn membership and ownership in communities, and a greater focus on real utility.**\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Introducing Bonfire\\n\\nAt Bonfire, we‚Äôre focused on helping web3 communities unlock this full potential. We‚Äôre building infrastructure to enable creators to build their own branded platforms, powered by their web3 assets (social tokens¬†and NFTs). Don‚Äôt worry, we won‚Äôt make you run your own server ;)\\n\\n### Build A Home For Your Community\\n\\n* ü¶ã **Your Brand** - keep your brand at the center of the experience, while our white-label tools are behind the scenes making things easy\\n* **üè†¬†Custom Domains** - host your community on your own custom domain (or subdomain)\\n* **ü™ô¬†BYOT (bring your own token)** - Bonfire works with your existing assets\\n* **üß± Web3 Integrations & Interoperability** - if you want to go far, go together. We‚Äôre excited to work with other web3 product and protocol teams on this mission to empower creative communities\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/imdanielallan/status/1479527995287040001?s=20](https://twitter.com/imdanielallan/status/1479527995287040001?s=20)\\n\\n### Token Distribution\\n\\nWe‚Äôre also focused on better tools for token distribution. We‚Äôve got *much* more planned here, but the first two tools we‚Äôre excited to be launching are:\\n\\n* **1) Airdrops**: Create custom airdrops, from smart contract to branded claim page\\n* **2) Bounties**: Incentivize & reward members for specific contributions of time, skills and attention\\n\\n### Token Utility\\n\\nFinally, we make it easy to layer additional utility and functional benefits on top of your existing assets. In his iconic post on [New Internet Logic](https://j.mirror.xyz/k0yCgq0bjgn2X0AujhwjKIYk4SDBpdNayjU5_E8Wm4I), [John Palmer](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer) opens with the line that ‚Äú*The Internet is now a place where everyone has an inventory‚Äù.* We‚Äôre building Bonfire on this new mental model of the internet. For us this means treating token-gating as a core substrate of the platform, a capability that can be applied across the features and experiences we build. Whether you want to gate access to events & community experiences, merch, content, or just about anything else on our roadmap, we aim to provide the tools and templates to make it easy to give your assets utility.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nOver the past year, communities empowered with ownership have exploded onto the scene, and there‚Äôs a growing body of evidence supporting the core thesis of the ownership economy - share value with those who create it.\\n\\nWe‚Äôre on a mission to build a community-owned platform powering this next era of the creator economy, and we‚Äôve got an ambitious roadmap ahead.\\n\\nCome join us around the fire. It‚Äôs cozy üî•\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nP.S.
