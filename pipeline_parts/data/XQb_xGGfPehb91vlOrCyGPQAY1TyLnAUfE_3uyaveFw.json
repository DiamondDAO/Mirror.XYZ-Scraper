"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**What is Gitcoin?**\\n\\nGitcoin is a decentralized platform that funds open source builders. On Gitcoin, developers can earn while building open source public goods projects; project founders can raise money from supporters and Gitcoin itself; learners can learn from industry leaders and build meaningful relationships; supporters can donate to open source projects freely as they like.\\n\\n So far, Gitcoin has helped builders raise and distribute about $20.4 million through bounties, hackathons, and quarterly grants rounds. except that, Gitcoin also gathered an army of active developers!\\n\\n \\n\\n**Gitcoin economic model**\\n\\nGitcoin was founded in 2017 by Kevin Owocki, by that fall, it gained the support of Joe Lubin and was brought into the ConsenSys family. On April 2021, Gitcoin raised $11.3m from investors include [Paradigm](https://www.paradigm.xyz/), IDEO, 1kx, Electric Capital, Naval and so on.\\n\\nOn May 2021, Gitcoin established Gitcoin DAO and issued its government token GTC, which aims to progressively decentralize the Gitcoin platform. The Gitcoin DAO and GTC serve as coordinating community members to make key decisions such as fund allocation, matching pools, and grant collusion. The Gitcoin team said GTC has no economic value, it is a governance token used to oversee the Gitcoin ecosystem, it has no claim on financial rights. The total supply of GTC is 100,000,000 (100M) tokens, broken down as follows.\\n\\nl  Retroactive Airdrop – 15%\\n\\nl  Gitcoin DAO – 50%\\n\\nl  Existing Stakeholders – 35%\\n\\nGTC allocated to the Gitcoin DAO will become available for distribution in equal monthly installments over the course of the next 2 years, meaning the full allocation will be unlocked by May 2023; and GTC allocated to Gitcoin’s existing stakeholders are non-transferrable for at least 500 days!\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Gitcoin team did not disclose how many tokens have been allocated to investors, let’s assume the last round investors get one third of 35,000,000 GTC (35%) tokens that allocated to the stakeholders, with the GTC price at $10 now, it is a 10x return investment only in a month, what a magic!\\n\\n \\n\\n**What Gitcoin could be?**\\n\\nGitcoin could be a super incubator and accelerator of block chain startups. Here are my reasons.\\n\\n \\n\\n**Block chain economic models give birth to a new era of open source software.**\\n\\nSo far famous open source software foundations such as The Linux foundation and The Apache Software Foundation, which mainly receive revenue from program service or contributions. The Linux Foundation is a non-profit technology consortium to standardize Linux, support its growth, and promote its commercial adoption. All though cloud computing is a trillion-dollar market, most of the servers run with Linux operating system, Linux Foundation which hosted Linux only earns its $90 million income mainly from providing program services. The Apache Software Foundation is another famous open source software foundation, it hosts more than 350 projects that produce $22B+ worth of software, only has an annual total revenue of $2.58 million which mainly from contributions and grants. But in the block chain world, we have tokens, we have economic models, projects can collect fees from the services they provide, and we have the culture that projects allocate tokens to contributors and donators when they issued a token. Gitcoin could get revenue mainly from investment in the future, because there are thousands of block chain projects have received funds from Gitcoin, it is for sure some of them will grow up into big trees and Gitcoin will benefit from their success.\\n\\n**Gitcoin funds projects with all the community members.**\\n\\nWhen funds block chain projects Gitcoin is not alone. When a project listed on Gitcoin for grants, community supporters no matter small or large have the freedom to support the project as they like. Gitcoin have a grants pool, the higher the number of individual donators a project gets, the more funds it will get from the grants pool at the same time. It is not only a funding process, but also a process that projects build relationships with the whole Gitcoin community.\\n\\n**Gitcoin has gathered an army of developers.**\\n\\nAs a block chain startup, smart brains and developers are the core. Gitcoin has successfully gathered an army of active developers on its platform. Those developers are eagerly working on open bounties, taking part in hackathons sponsored by some of the most innovative Web3 organizations, or starting the next great public works project. This is an invaluable catalyst to the whole block chain ecosystem!\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nGitcoin is a platform with the mission of building and funding the open web! It builds on Ethereum, it has run for 4 years, it has helped thousands of projects raise more than $20 million, it has gathered more 160000 active developers. This is indeed a project that has true value, and its token GTC which gives holders the right to take part in the government also has true value. So far GTC has a market capitalization of $1 billion, buy at the bull market may not a good choice, but, as a participator in the block chain world, no matter for profit or for the human wells, you should hold some GTC! All in all, advanced block chain economic model coordinates with funds and an army of developers, Gitcoin could be a super incubator and accelerator of block chain startups and it’s a valuable project that deserves your holding.\\n\\n20210609\\n\\n**References**\\n\\n<https://gitcoin.co/blog/introducing-gtc-gitcoins-governance-token/>\\n\\n<https://gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-grows-treasury-to-accelerate-open-source/>\\n\\nhttps://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/460503801\",\"timestamp\":1635851657,\"title\":\"Gitcoin could be a super incubator and accelerator of blockchain startups\"},\"digest\":\"jqEXIoV7ucrJ_CMji_yDbWL6i34P8J_gmhDzeXggj1o\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xFC74aB67F16da3a0C7095340401fD6129Be433f7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BzFm0qOP6A2qGQnD2b2pKXMxgYb_1ztL9QIft1zHybw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"v4MUbJulMyaPJbtC_4iyynx5l-zrPcWQoDtvYxQKvi4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"bBKYJf76bdQ1Bdgqa1iN0c5_Nj6wt52HTcP0YoSfPm6XSirQ1arZxbjMx2pEdAgbHyFObcR9c--YbM79b55q-g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8620d686060ed320e5335baf9075adf0d0cace0ac9373b6f889f8cab740b6037636900200b16f2f9f735405e0e3124939d2edf63ab6ea30ffce2645504eeb1e01b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BzFm0qOP6A2qGQnD2b2pKXMxgYb_1ztL9QIft1zHybw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"v4MUbJulMyaPJbtC_4iyynx5l-zrPcWQoDtvYxQKvi4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jqEXIoV7ucrJ_CMji_yDbWL6i34P8J_gmhDzeXggj1o\"}"
