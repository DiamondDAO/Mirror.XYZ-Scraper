Creating visual narratives surrounding culture, family and the elements of life that inspire him to create. We caught up with him to discuss his art background, inspiration, and thoughts on the wider NFT space.\\\\*\\n\\n## **Could you tell us a little about your artistic background?**\\n\\nI am a digital and traditional artist. I am self-taught which means I have no formal training but I am continuously learning about my craft. I’ve been into simple exhibits in our community to showcase young talents and won some contests. Creating art serves as a medium for me to engage in meditation and a conversation with my inner self. My goal is to produce works of art that reflect on and engage the human spirit, both yours and mine. The goal is to have fun, to spread pleasure, and to inspire and be inspired by this amazing journey.\\n\\n## When did you first start seriously creating art?\\n\\nWhen I was 12, I realized I was destined to be an artist. I was completely absorbed by everything around me. Flowers, birds, and trees are just a few examples of the many things that nature has to offer. As a result, I couldn’t keep myself from making copies of them on paper. Even though my skill was lacking, my passion for painting was already encrusting itself into my soul on a daily basis. I started to use oil pastels to draw many things when I was 12. I tried to join on poster making contests and won some that boosted my moral as an artist.\\n\\n## Where are you from, and is there an NFT scene?\\n\\nI’m from Philippines and there is no NFT scene here. Mostly artists like me earn using our talent by accepting commissioned works or if someone bought our works.\\n\\n## What inspires you to create?\\n\\nPeople’s experiences and tales serve as sources of inspiration for me. My own experiences and cultural background are combined with theirs to produce one-of-a-kind narrative artworks that commemorate their most significant life events.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*aDR54p8_02jPICVdR7sHMg.png)\\n\\n## Do you have a favourite style of artwork to produce, and could you talk a little about about the process behind it?\\n\\nI have no particular favourite style of artwork but right now, I’m into a combination of traditional and digital art. I’m doing simple sketches in my journal and transfer it to an application and colour it and work with some details. I am using my phone to do the digital side of every piece.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*rLDPOqwFXZPeCWQIOLVgwQ.png)\\n\\n## What made you pursue NFT art?\\n\\nI pursue NFT art because I wanted to use my talent to earn. I want to prove to everyone in our community that saying that art can’t take me anywhere, art can take me somewhere, a place where I can be me, a place that I can meet wonderful people, and a place that can help me sustain my needs and my family.\\n\\n## What is your creative process like, from inception to the finished piece?\\n\\nSketching in my journal, transferring to Ibis paint x (art application), polishing the line art, colouring, then adding polishing details.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*nzpZk7DzrxVfGNvbSp05Qg.png)\\n\\n## How has your artistic style evolved over the years?\\n\\nAfter I met many artists in my current journey, I could say that my artistic side matured and developed. I watched so many tutorials and asked many artists about their art to acquire more information. My art evolved from stickman to more complex artworks now with substance, meaning and story.\\n\\n## Do you have a favourite piece that you’ve created?\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*lB7x9eu63SizL2U5oKfqdw.jpeg)\\n\\n## Who is your favourite NFT artist?\\n\\nMy favourite artist is a local artist here in the Philippines, he is also about my age but his knowledge about art is so vast. He is known as Jai.\\n\\n## If you could collaborate with another artist, who would it be?\\n\\nI still want to learn and I still see myself as a newbie in art so I’m still not confident to work with other artists right now.\\n\\n## How did you first discover the world of NFTs, and what is your impression on the space as a creator?\\n\\nI discovered NFTs in a microblogging site where I shared my works. Someone told me that I should try to make my artworks into NFTs. I was hopeless that time because I thought I needed high-tech materials to mint, but I encountered marketplaces like Uptick where I can mint my works with ease. As a creator, the NFT world is so vast and full of uncertainties but I really enjoyed and still enjoy seeing so many artists showcasing amazing arts.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*c0m3bFvkqgo7KZwuNoq43Q.png)\\n\\n## **Could you talk about your ‘Symbolic Burn’ ?**\\n\\nI’m contemplating about myself and my art as a creator of NFTs. I tried to ask myself “Why is my art an NFT?” I thought about it for a long time when I came up with an answer: It is an NFT because it is a unique digital asset, a one of a kind artwork. Upon answering the question, another question popped up, “How would I emphasize it?” I came up with the idea of turning the physical copies of my artworks into ashes to emphasize “uniqueness”\\n\\n**[Video](https://twitter.com/ArtistryOrga/status/1452100345732104196?s=20)**\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*vVR6cVUjOnfe68GqVdICPQ.jpeg)\\n\\n## Check out more of Artistry Organica’s work on Uptick, and follow him on Twitter to keep up to date with all the latest developments.\\n\\n*Uptick app is the world’s first decentralized full-featured mobile NFT app, based on the commercial-grade NFT infrastructure of Uptick Network.
