"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Human desire is mimetic. We want things because people around us want them. We value things because it's valued by the people close to us.\\n\\nIf our value formula is predicated on the value formula of random people who happen to be \\\"close\\\" to us, then what everybody thinks valuable would be amplified in value, meaning its value is less than we think. By the same logic, the \\\"worthless\\\" things that are hidden from most people's view are actually worth more than what people value it for.\\n\\nThis is why you need to think really deeply about what you want to work on. There is more to see out there than our mimetically blinded eyes can see. What's out there is the only thing that actually matters since it has the value that we need to capture.\",\"timestamp\":1640386668,\"title\":\"The only valuable things are the worthless things\"},\"digest\":\"HH4d3w0rG6NCMRCVpC25vTc1a8cR5Hg0y5Pr72Irwtw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xb1D71b7E0f94353E8CbF6fe68cD4dDeD7195AFbA\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eV2hqtiWnhlvLjiaEWJWXht320Z62c4et4ThddtXFtI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AMd7sRV24z_-wezsuhfoEd2h1V5QgGNSMfnK3TI03JI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Di7p64fFAWK-finqjsfADwBVs69Xc9ItbwNI4zXrrmfiaBUgJWETb6rOGD7O78oDAJnHFKp0Dm5rMQUOpducgw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xbdf072151d22aabf001d6b669f2c08c03c21cbb5d49fc1a9f652124f42602e1f475d26266f3621f881084c593b6dc4a8958cee61587a919151970ef229c16ce31c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eV2hqtiWnhlvLjiaEWJWXht320Z62c4et4ThddtXFtI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AMd7sRV24z_-wezsuhfoEd2h1V5QgGNSMfnK3TI03JI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"cmw3eQtKy9FwKJYMIsqVBi7U1gyokw7_uJHTkMFdkgg\"}"
