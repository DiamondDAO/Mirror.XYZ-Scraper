"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Only a few weeks after launch, [KlimaDAO](https://klimadao.finance/) has become the most successful project in the climate crypto space. It solves a simple problem in a unique way:\\n\\n**Global market prices for carbon credits are too cheap**. This leads to greenwashing. As companies can “offset” their emissions buy buying nearly free carbon credits on commodity markets. Today, not enough cost are incurred for companies to emit carbon dioxide. \\n\\nKlimaDAO tries to change this **increasing carbon prices** using a smart market mechanism. But how?\\n\\nFrom the outside, KlimaDAO is a somewhat typically opaque sounding crypto project: “Klima aims to become a reserve currency that is backed by carbon offsets”. Users bond Carbon Credits (BCT) into the KlimaDAO treasury and get Klima tokens in return. \\n\\nTaking a close look, the carbon bonding mechanism is powerful: By removing carbon credit supply in the market, carbon prices will raise. This will make it more expensive for companies to offset their greenhouse gas emissions, and therefore increase the incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As prices of carbon credits go up, the value of the KlimaDAO treasury increases too - for the benefit of the KLIMA investors and holders.\\n\\nThis mechanism marries two different things that were separate before: Climate activism with greed. Funny enough, this combination is insanely powerful and also subversive, as it beats the excesses of capitalims at his own game. In a podcast, one of the founders KlimaDAO also made the comment: \\\"we gamestop the carbon market\\\".\\n\\nSo, Klima aims to become a decentralized, algorithmic based, reserve currency. What does the protocol do to achieve that? On a high level the protocol has the following properties:\\n\\n1. Klima tokens have intrinsic value (IV). They are backed. There is price floor, but no price ceiling of the protocol. Right now, the intrinsic value of one Klima is 1 Carbon Ton.\\n2. The Klima protocol has the ability to contract (\\\"burn\\\") and expand (\\\"mint\\\") the supply. It is like a central bank for fiat currencies, but - obviously - decentralized.\\n3. Whenever the price of a KLIMA token is above the intrinsic value of one carbon ton, the protocol expands supply (\\\"mints tokens\\\"), and sells KLIMA to the market.\\n4. As long as there is intrinsic value backing the token, the protocol can  create more supply. The spread between the intrinsic value and market price it the protocol's profit.\\n5. Whenever Klima is trading below the intrinsic value, the protocol buys and burns Klima, thereby contracting supply.\\n\\nThese market operations make sure that Klima will not trade under the intrinsic value. The protocol will step in as the last buyer, because the protocol can and will buy Klima below the intrinsic value.\\n\\nIf the supply is reduced to 0, theoretically, this would be very profitable for those who didn't sell, as their % supply grows rapidly.\\n\\nToday the protocol makes a profit. In the starting setup, 90% of the profits go to the stakers, and 10% to the DAO. This can and probably will be changed by decentralized governance decisions.\\n\\nThe staking rewards, paid to the user in Klima, incentivize users to keep their Klima staked. This reduces the pressure to sell the token.\\n\\nKlimaDAO’s long term goal, is to become a reserve currency with a stable price, independent on the actual price of BCT. But the short and midterm focus is on fast growth and treasury accumulation of Carbon tons.\",\"timestamp\":1639381691,\"title\":\"KlimaDAO - the Black Hole for Carbon\"},\"digest\":\"P1_9eTTb31-wfl4nLLX0N01qikiS6uVqx_asNimTd5Q\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x22AC0E18853d749d46716274682b4aDDa206cA3f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"CC1D-ryh1KjHi7VyX5XlFA_lPlHDaqHxNtu1pdnvhyA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Xy7YvNRXbmzGqVicsG0LwtPABh6ngNRdKvR8i6uHxA4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"bzTTcNXz7HAUfA0AQhLN2xW1-iOzTC14F0cF57a79G55XwRMSFrxWxArLjoRA4C5Xt_yGA-C94mxJUsToPFduQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf5f22f78cae0de7157abca194e1418376beffcdf77e3866951858f32cbc901001cf966df1137870ad832c616d76ca8b4aba1538d6955e321b930f813757b148d1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"CC1D-ryh1KjHi7VyX5XlFA_lPlHDaqHxNtu1pdnvhyA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Xy7YvNRXbmzGqVicsG0LwtPABh6ngNRdKvR8i6uHxA4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"P1_9eTTb31-wfl4nLLX0N01qikiS6uVqx_asNimTd5Q\"}"
