Short for \\\"cryptographic blind signature\\\", users could sign data without revealing it, with a secure verification it was untampered.\\n\\n\\\"It would be a misuse of the word \\\"ecash\\\", if something which was revocable were dubbed ecash\\\".\\n\\nTo work, ‘ecash’ needed tamper resistant hardware. Otherwise \\\"reliance on a mint, or double spend database means the cash'\\\" would be worth nothing if someone, like the government, held the database, and could switch it off. It had to be hands off.\\n\\nOther key ideas:\\n\\n\\\"Make the double-spending public\\\" and \\\"whenever someone receives a coin they broadcast its value\\\" - no lies, no fraud.\\n\\nThe database \\\"operates in parallel across a large number of servers so that is intractable to shut it down”. No OFF switch.\\n\\nA bigger danger was if the \\\"mint\\\" were taken over, 'forced to behave badly, say by issuing too many coins.\\\" and make it worthless.\\\"\\n\\nAnother form of ecash could be \\\"Wei Dai's B-money\\\"... like Hashcash, which represents a measurable amount of computational work to produce.\\\"\\\" It \\\"can't be forged\\\".\\n\\n\\\"This could be a very robust payment system and is worth pursuing further\\\". \\n\\nIt was pursued further, less than 10 years later, when the banking system, controlled by the State, imploded.\\n\\n \\n **2877 Earth, The Necklace, Outside the Mars Consulate \\n ** \\n ”Two meetings. We draw them out, show them something, and then we agree to meeting place, to make an exchange, they get the device and they free her.”\\n\\n  ”Proof of life. They did not have time to make downloads from deep memory. They can’t deep-make her on a feed. I need access to Oracles in the consulate, from your office.”  \\n\\n”These people haven’t made it this far without putting people on the inside. I’m guessing you got to know her on the transport. Both proof of life and no deep-makes on a remote feed.”  \\n\\n”That’s what I’m guessing. They have to bring her both times. It will be me. They’ll be bristling with contraband gear, prepared for me to try something. I’ll show them a sample that convinces them.”\\n\\n  ”I want the head of their crew. This thing is not up to a footsoldier. Their head has to be at the final exchange, wherever it is.”  \\n\\n”My guess is for the exchange, they pick the ground. Maybe it’s in one of their fronts. One of the new peace-time Co-ops they use.” \\n  \\n “Okay. I’ll send word through our neighborhood assets. One of them will get word for the first meeting. Maybe in 2, 3 days.” \\n  \\n “That will give me enough time to pull together a sample from the device, something that doesn’t exist on any ‘chain. Authentic.”\\n\\n  ”After that, we’ll see where they want to make the trade. I can only go to trusted people, because we served together, in the War, then in the Force.”\\n\\n  ”I understand. The people protecting her family back home, served with me. Neither of us knows who else is involved in this.”  \\n\\n”Okay, back to you tonight, by then, we should hear something. First meeting leads to the exchange. Then you get your friend, I get my arrest. Then I’m going to escort you both to the next flight home.” \\n\\n[https://audius.co/deadmau5/deadmau5-unlucky-work-in-progress-333797](https://audius.co/deadmau5/deadmau5-unlucky-work-in-progress-333797)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/csXDjHZyE9c5XIOwg_PV2.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4xZMTCkcmCWJl78bzQxSW.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \",\"timestamp\":1635807271,\"title\":\"1999 7.24 A System Worth Pursuing Further\"},\"digest\":\"VBu_i7NyfYV3ufQa0-AZhE9BGDwHVr2AqpVZuh94qM8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cp69EkVmGPN56udTPoj_01QpW6eGaXZ1zbeS531jad8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zYwhIf2jaKC_Er3nNncHMRuE7eXBXlkdLz-3zM8ikGE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"MTJRbljQI1cks7xPQ8l6EwJ1gfkR6Ji743XOLRESRBUTMdHgjajrBChS8JCzPwGjWFy3SUDRPf04IeQhPE4DDg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe4c1bcaa88b6fe2c67d195f4a76d1a91640647a2c63ec8f8083673f941e8ee412d804077222237104c51130677298bdcb163cbc3b2eb0bb6193f6b825a8e06141c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cp69EkVmGPN56udTPoj_01QpW6eGaXZ1zbeS531jad8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zYwhIf2jaKC_Er3nNncHMRuE7eXBXlkdLz-3zM8ikGE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"VBu_i7NyfYV3ufQa0-AZhE9BGDwHVr2AqpVZuh94qM8\"}"
