"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"found alone, But rush upon me thronging, and present Times past, what once I was, and what am now.\\\"\\n\\nNor can I leave this point without asserting it to you that no church and no school of theology has ever developed the mind as well as sanctified the heart of the common people like the preaching of the Puritan pulpit.  Matthew Arnold was not likely to over-estimate the good that Puritanism had done to England. Indeed, in his earlier writings he sometimes went out of his way to lament the hurt that the Puritan spirit had done to liberality of life and mind in his native land.  But in his riper years we find him saying:  \\\"Certainly,\\\" he says, \\\"I am not blind to the faults of the Puritan discipline, but it has been an invaluable discipline for that poor, inattentive, and immoral creature, man.  And the more I read history and the more I see of mankind, the more I recognise the value of the Puritan discipline.\\\"  And in that same Address he \\\"founded his best hopes for that so enviable and unbounded country in which he was speaking, America, on the fact that so many of its millions had passed through the Puritan discipline.\\\"  John Milton was a product of that discipline on the one hand, as John Bunyan was on the other.  Christiana was another of its products in the sphere of the family, just as Matthew Arnold himself had some of his best qualities out of the same fruitful school.\\n\\n1. Her heart, her deep, strong, tender heart, is present on every page of Christiana's noble history.  Her heart keeps her often silent when the water in her eyes becomes all the more eloquent. When she does let her heart utter itself in words, her words are fine and memorable.  As, for one instance, after Greatheart's discourse on redemption.  \\\"O Mercy, that thy father and mother were here; yea, and Mrs. Timorous also.  Nay, I wish with all my heart now that here was Madam Wanton, too.  Surely, surely, their hearts would be affected, nor could the fear of the one, nor the powerful lusts of the other, prevail with them to go home again, and to refuse to become good pilgrims.\\\"  But it was not so much what she said herself that brought out the depth and tenderness of Christiana's heart, it was rather the way her heart loosened other people's tongues.  You must all have felt how some people's presence straitens your heart and sews up your mouth.  While there are other people, again, whose simple presence unseals your heart and makes you eloquent.  We ministers keenly feel that both in our public and in our private ministrations.  There are people in whose hard and chilling presence we cannot even say grace as we should say it.  Whereas, we all know other people, people of a heart, that is, whose presence somehow so touches our lips that we always when near them rise far above ourselves.  Christiana did not speak much to her guides and instructors and companions, but they always spoke their best to her, and it was her heart that did it.\\n2. And then a widow indeed is just a true and genuine widow; a widow not in her name and in her weeds only, but still more in her deep heart, in her whole life, and in her garnered experience. \\\"Honour widows that are widows indeed.  Now, she that is a widow indeed and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and in prayers night and day.  Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.\\\"  These are the true marks and seals and occupations of a widow indeed.  And if she has had unparalleled trials and irreparable losses, she has her corresponding consolations and compensations.  For she has a freedom to go about and do good, a liberty and an experience that neither the unmarried maiden nor the married wife can possibly have.  She can do multitudes of things that in the nature of things neither of them can attempt to do. Things that would be both unseemly and impossible for other women to say or to do are both perfectly seemly and wholly open for her to say and to do.  Her widowhood is a sacred shield to her.  Her sorrow is a crown of honour and a sceptre of authority to her.  She is consulted by the young and the inexperienced, by the forsaken and by the forlorn, as no other human being ever is.  She has come through this life, and by a long experience she knows this world and the hearts that fill it and make it what it is.  A widow indeed can show a sympathy, and give a counsel, and speak with a weight of wisdom that one's own mother cannot always do.  All you who by God's sad dispensation are now clothed in the \\\"white and wimpled folds\\\" of widowhood, let your prayer and your endeavour day and night be that God would guide and enable you to be widows indeed. And, if you do, you shall want neither your occupation nor your honour.\\n\\nTHE ENCHANTED GROUND\\n\\n\\\"Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel.\\\"--Balaam.\\n\\n\\\"I saw then in my dream that they went till they came into a certain country whose air naturally tended to make one drowsy if he came a stranger to it.  And here Hopeful began to be very dull and heavy of sleep, wherefore he said unto Christian, I do now begin to grow so drowsy that I can scarcely hold up mine eyes; let us lie down here and take one nap.\\\"  And then when we turn to the same place in the Second Part we read thus:  \\\"By this time they were got to the Enchanted Ground, where the air naturally tended to make one drowsy.  And that place was all grown over with briars and thorns, excepting here and there, where was an enchanted arbour, upon which, if a man sits, or in which if a man sleeps, 'tis a question, say some, whether they shall ever rise or wake again in this world. Now, they had not gone far, but a great mist and darkness fell upon them all, so that they could scarce, for a great while, see the one the other.  Wherefore they were forced for some time to feel for one another by words, for they walked not by sight.  Nor was there on all this ground so much as one inn or victualling-house wherein to refresh the feebler sort.  Then they came to an arbour, warm, and promising much refreshing to the pilgrims, for it was finely wrought above head, beautified with greens, and furnished with couches and settles.  It also had a soft couch on which the weary might lean.  This arbour was called The Slothful Man's Friend, on purpose to allure, if it might be, some of the pilgrims there to take up their rest when weary.  This, you must think, all things considered, was tempting.  I saw in my dream also that they went on in this their solitary way till they came to a place at which a man is very apt to lose his way.  Now, though when it was light, their guide could well enough tell how to miss those ways that led wrong, yet in the dark he was put to a stand.  But he had in his pocket a map of all ways leading to or from the Celestial City, wherefore he struck a light (for he never goes also without his tinder-box), and takes a view of his book or map, which bids him be careful in that place to turn to the right-hand way.  Then I thought with myself, who that goeth on pilgrimage but would have one of those maps about him, that he may look when he is at a stand, which is the way to take?\\\"\\n\\n1. \\\"But what is the meaning of all this?\\\" asked Christiana of the guide.  \\\"This Enchanted Ground,\\\"--her able and experienced friend answered her, \\\"this is one of the last refuges that the enemy to pilgrims has; wherefore it is, as you see, placed almost at the end of the way, and so it standeth against us with the more advantage. For when, thinks the enemy, will these fools be so desirous to sit down as when they are weary, and when so like to be weary as when almost at their journey's end?  Therefore it is, I say, that the Enchanted Ground is placed so nigh to the land Beulah and so near the end of their race; wherefore let pilgrims look to themselves lest they fall asleep till none can waken them.\\\"  \\\"That masterpiece of Bunyan's insight into life, the Enchanted Ground,\\\" says Mr. Louis Stevenson, \\\"where his allegory cuts so deep to people looking seriously on life.\\\"  Yes, indeed, Bunyan's insight into life!  And his allegory that cuts so deep!  For a neophyte, and one with little insight into life, or into himself, would go to look for this land of darkness and thorns and pitfalls, alternated with arbours and settles and soft couches--one new to life and to himself, I say, would naturally expect to see all that confined to the region between the City of Destruction and the Slough of Despond; or, at the worst, long before, and never after, the House Beautiful.  But Bunyan looked too straight at life and too unflinchingly into his own heart to lay down his sub-Celestial lands in that way; and when we begin to look with a like seriousness on the religious life, and especially when we begin to look bold enough and deep enough into our own heart, then we too shall freely acknowledge the splendid master-stroke of Bunyan in the Enchanted Ground.  That this so terrible experience is laid down almost at the end of the Celestial way--the blaze of light that pours upon our heads fairly startles us, while at the same time it comforts us and assures us.  That this Enchanted Ground, which has proved so fatal to so many false pilgrims, and so all but fatal to so many true pilgrims, should lie around the very borders of Beulah, and should be within all but eye-shot of the Celestial City itself,--that is something to be thankful for, and something to lay up in the deepest and the most secret place in our heart. That these pilgrims, after all their feastings and entertainments-- after the Delectable Mountains and the House Beautiful--should all be plunged upon a land where there was not so much as a roadside inn, where the ways were so dark and so long that the pilgrims had to shout aloud in order to keep together, where, instead of moon or stars, they had to walk in the spark of a small tinder-box--what an encouragement and assurance to us is all that!  That is no strange thing, then, that is now happening to us, when, after our fine communion season, we have suddenly fallen back into this deep darkness, and are cast into these terrible temptations, and feel as if all our past experiences and attainments and enjoyments had been but a self-delusion and a snare.  That we should all but have fallen fast asleep, and all but have ceased both from watching against sin and from waiting upon God--well, that is nothing more than Hopeful himself would have done had he not had a wary old companion to watch over him, and to hold his eyes open.  Let all God's people present who feel that they are nothing better of all they have enjoyed of Scriptures and sacraments, but rather worse; let all those who feel sure that they have wandered into a castaway land, so dark, so thorny, so miry, and so lonely is their life--let them read this masterpiece of John Bunyan again and again and take heart of hope.\\n\\n\\\"When Saints do sleepy grow, let them come hither And hear how these two pilgrims talk together; Yea, let them hear of them, in any wise, Thus to keep ope their drowsy slumb'ring eyes; Saints' fellowship, if it be managed well, Keeps them awake, and that in spite of hell.\\\"\\n\\n1. But far worse than all its briars and thorns, far more fatal than all its ditches and pitfalls, were the enchanted arbours they came on here and there planted up and down that evil land.  For those arbours are all of this fatal nature, that if a man falls asleep in any of them it arises a question whether he shall ever come to himself again in this world.  Now, where there are no inns nor victualling-houses, no Gaius and no Mr. Mnason, what a danger all those ill-intended arbours scattered all up and down that country become!  Well, then, the first enchanted arbour that the pilgrims came to was built just inside the borders of the land, and it was called The Stranger's Arbour--so many new-comers had lain down in it never to rise again.  The young and the inexperienced, with those who were naturally of a believing, buoyant, easy mind, lay down in hundreds here.  Hopeful's mind was naturally a mind of a soft and easy and self-indulgent cast; and had he been alone that day, or had he had for a companion a man of a less wary, less anxious, and less urgent mind than Christian was, Hopeful had taken a nap, as he so confidingly called it--a fatal nap in that arbour built by the enemy of pilgrims, just on purpose for the young and the ignorant, the inexperienced and the self-indulgent.\\n2. The Slothful Man's Arbour has been already described.  It was a warm arbour, and it promised much refreshing to the pilgrims.  It also had in it a soft couch on which the weary might lean.  \\\"Let us lie down here and take just one nap; we shall be refreshed if we take a nap!\\\"  \\\"Do you not remember,\\\" said the other, \\\"that one of the shepherds bid us beware of the Enchanted Ground?  And he meant by that that we should beware of sleeping; wherefore let us not sleep as do others, but let us watch and be sober.\\\"  Now, what is a nap?  And what is it to take a nap in our religion?  The New Testament is full of warnings to those who read it and go by it-- most solemn and most fearful warnings--against SLEEP.  Now, have you any clear idea in your minds as to what this divinely denounced sleep is?  Sleep is good and necessary in our bodily life.  We would not live long if we did not sleep; we would soon go out of our mind; we would soon lose our senses if we did not sleep. Insomnia is one of the worst symptoms of our eager, restless, over- worked age.  \\\"He giveth His beloved sleep\\\"; and while they sleep their corn grows they know not how.  But sleep in the great exhortation-passages of the Holy Scriptures does not mean rest and restoration; it means in all those passages insensibility, stupidity, danger, and death.  In our nightly sleep, and in the measure of its soundness, we are utterly dead to the world around us.  Men may come into our house and rob us of our most precious possessions; they may even come up to our bed and murder us; our whole house may be in a blaze about us; we may only awaken to leap out of sleep into eternity.  Now, we are all in a sleep like that in our souls.  There is above us, and around us, and beneath us, and within us the eternal world, and we are all sound asleep; we are all stone-dead in the midst of it.  Devils and wicked men are stealing our treasures for eternity, and we are sound asleep; hell is already kindling our bed beneath us, but we smell not its flames, or we only catch the first gasp of them before we make our everlasting bed among them.  Therefore let us not sleep as do others, but let us watch and be sober.  What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise and call upon thy God!  When the guide shook Heedless and Too-bold off their settles in that slothful arbour, the one of them said with his eyes still shut, \\\"I will pay you when I take my money,\\\" and the other said, \\\"I will fight so long as I can hold my sword in my hand.\\\"  At that one of the children laughed.  \\\"What is the meaning of that?\\\" asked Christiana.  The guide said:  \\\"They talk in their sleep.\\\"  So they did, and so do all men.  For this whole world is full of settles on which men sleep and talk in their sleep.  The newspapers to-morrow morning will all be full to overflowing of what men have said and written to-day and yesterday in their sleep.  The shops and the banks and the exchanges will all be full of men making promises and settling accounts in their sleep.  They will finger their purses, and grasp their swords, and all in their sleep.  And not children but devils will laugh as they hear the folly that falls from men's lips who are besotted with spiritual sleep and drugged with spiritual and fleshly sin.  A dream cometh through the multitude of business.  I had just got this length in this lecture the other night when I went to sleep.  And in my sleep one of my people came to me and asked me if I could make it quite clear and plain to him what it would be for a man like him after a communion-time to begin to walk with God.  And I just wish I could make the things of the Enchanted Ground as plain to myself and to you to-night as I was able to make a walk with God plain to myself and to my visitor that night in my ministerial dream.  I often wish that my business mind worked as well in my study chair and in my pulpit as it sometimes does in my bed and in my sleep.  \\\"Now, I beheld in my dream that they talked more in their sleep at this time than ever they did in all their journey.  And being in a muse thereabout, the gardener said even to me:  Wherefore musest thou at the matter?  It is the nature of the fruit of the grapes of those vineyards to go down so sweetly as to cause the lips of them that are asleep to speak.\\\"  The reason my poor lips spake so sweetly about a walk with God that night most have been because I spent all the summer evening before walking with God and with you in the vineyards of Beulah.\\n3. Listen to Samson, shorn of his locks, as he shakes himself off a soft and sweetly-worked couch in The Sensual Man's Arbour:\\n\\n\\\"No, no; It fits not; thou and I long since are twain; Nor think me so unwary or accurst To bring my feet again into the snare Where once I have been caught; I know thy trains, Though dearly to my cost, thy gins, and toils; Thy fair enchanted cup and warbling charms No more on me have power, their force is null'd; So much of adder's wisdom have I learnt To fence my ear against thy sorceries. If in my flower of youth and strength, when all men Loved, honour'd, fear'd me, thou alone couldst hate me, Thy husband, slight me, sell me, and forego me; How wouldst thou use me now, blind, and thereby Deceivable, in most things as a child, Helpless, thence easily contemn'd, and scorn'd, And last neglected?  How wouldst thou insult, When I must live uxorious to thy will In perfect thraldom!  How again betray me, Bearing my words and doings to the lords To gloss upon, and censuring, frown or smile! This jail I count the house of liberty To thine, whose doors my feet shall never enter.\\\"\\n\\n1. The love of money to some men is the root of all evil.  There came once a youth to St. Philip Neri and, flushed with joy, told him that his parents after much entreaty had at length allowed him to study law.  St. Philip was not a man of many words.  \\\"What then?\\\" the saint simply asked the shining youth.  \\\"Then I shall become a lawyer!\\\"  \\\"And then?\\\" pursued Philip.  \\\"Then,\\\" said the young man, \\\"I shall earn a nice sum of money, and I shall purchase a fine country house, procure a carriage and horses, marry a handsome and rich wife, and lead a delightful life!\\\"  \\\"And then?\\\" \\\"Then,\\\"--the youth reflected as death and eternity arose before his eyes, and from that day he began to take care of his immortal soul. Philip with one word snatched that young man's soul off The Rich Man's Settle.\\n2. The Vain Man's Settle draws down many men to shame and everlasting contempt.  Praise a vain man or a vain woman aright and enough and you will get them to do anything you like.  Give a vain man sufficient publicity in your paper or on your platform and he will become a spy, a traitor, and cut-throat in your service.  The sorcerer's cup of praise--keep it full enough in a vain man's hand, and he will sleep in the arbour of vanity till he wakens in hell. Madam Bubble, the arch-enchantress, knows her own, and she has, with her purse, her promotion, and her praise, bought off many a promising pilgrim.\\n3. And then she, by virtue of whose sorceries this whole land is drugged and enchanted, is such a bold slut that she will build a Sacred Arbour even, and will fill it full of religious enchantment for you rather than lose hold of you.  She will consecrate places and persons and periods for you if your taste lies that way; she will build costly and stately churches for you; she will weave rich vestments and carve rich vessels; she will employ all the arts; she will even sanctify and set apart and seat aloft her holy men--what will she not do to please you, to take you, to intoxicate and enchant you?  She will juggle for your soul equally well whether you are a country clown in a feeing-market or a fine lady of aesthetic tastes and religious sensibilities in the capital and the court.  But I shall let Father Faber speak, who can speak on this subject both with authority and with attraction.  \\\"She can open churches, and light candles on the altar, and intone Te Deums to the Majesty on high.  She can pass into the beauty of art, into the splendour of dress, and into the magnificence of furniture.  She can sit with high principles on her lips discussing a religious vocation and praising God and sanctity.  On the benches of bishops and in the pages of good books you will find her, and yet she is all the while the same huge evil creature.\\\"  Yes; she is all the time the same Madam Bubble who offered to Standfast her body, her purse, and her bed.\\n\\nNow, would you know for yourself, like the communicant who came to me in my sleep, how you are ever to get past all those arbours, and settles, and seats, and couches, with all their sweet sorceries and intoxicating enchantments--would you in earnest know that?  Then study well the case of one Standfast.  Especially the time when she who enchants this whole ground hereabouts set so upon that pilgrim. In one word, it was this:  he remembered his Lord; and, like his Lord, he fell on his face; and as his Lord would have it, His servant's lips as they touched the ground touched also the healing plant harmony and he was saved.\\n\\n\\\"A small unsightly root, But of divine effect. Unknown, and like esteem'd, and the dull swain Treads on it daily with his clouted shoon; And yet more med'cinal is it than that moly That Hermes once to wise Ulysses gave; He call'd it haemony, and gave it me, And bade me keep it as of sovran use 'Gainst all enchantments, mildew, blast, or damp, Or ghastly furies' apparition. And now I find it true; for by this means I knew the foul enchantress, though disguised, Enter'd the very lime-twigs of her spells, And yet came off.  If you have this about you (As I will give you when you go) you may Boldly assault the necromancer's hall: Where if she be, with dauntless hardihood, And brandished blade, rush on her, break her glass, And shed her luscious liquor on the ground, And seize her wand.\\\"\\n\\nPrayer, my sin-beset brethren, standfast prayer, is the otherwise unidentified haemony whose best habitat was the Garden of Gethsemane; and with that holy root in your heart and in your mouth, there is \\\"no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel.\\\"\\n\\nTHE LAND OF BEULAH\\n\\n\\\"Thou shalt be called Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah.\\\"--Isaiah.\\n\\nThe first thing that John Bunyan tells us about the land of Beulah is this--that the shortest and the best way to the Celestial City lies directly through that land.  The land of Beulah has its own indigenous inhabitants indeed.  Old men dwell in the streets of Beulah, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age.  The streets of the city also are full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.  The land of Beulah has its frequent visitors also, and its welcome guests from the regions above.  Some of the shining ones come down from time to time and make a short sojourn in Beulah.  The angels in heaven have such a desire to see the lands from which God's saints come up that at certain seasons all the suburbs of the Celestial City are full of those shining servants of God and of the Lamb.\\n\\nBut what made the dreamer to smile and to talk so in his sleep was when he saw that all the upward ways to the Celestial City ran through the land of Beulah.  He saw also in his dream how all the pilgrims blamed themselves so bitterly now because they had misspent so much of their time and strength in the ways below, and so had not come sooner to see and to taste this blessed land.  But, at the same time, as it was, they all rejoiced with a great joy because that, after all their delays and all their wanderings, their way still led them through the borders of Beulah.  Now, my dear fellow-communicants, how shall we find our way at once, and without any more wanderings, into that so desirable land?  How shall we attain to walk its streets all the rest of our days with our staff in our hand?  How shall we hope to see our boys and our girls playing in the streets of Beulah, and eating all their days of its sweet and its healing fruits?  How shall we and our children with us henceforth escape the Slough of Despond, and Giant Despair's dungeon, and the Valley of the Shadow of Death?  The word, my brethren, the answer to all that, is nigh unto us, even in our mouth and in our heart.  For faith, simple faith, will do all that both for us and for our children beside us.  A heart-feeding faith in God, in the word of God, and in the Son of God, will do it.  Faith, and then obedience.  For obedience, my brethren, is Beulah.  All obedience is already Beulah.  Holy obedience will bring the whole of Beulah into your heart and into mine at any moment.  It is disobedience that makes so many of those who otherwise are true pilgrims to miss so much of the land of Beulah. Ask any affable old man with his staff in his hand for very age, and he will tell you that it was his disobedience that kept him so long out of the land of Beulah.  While, let any man, and above all, let any young man, begin early to live a life of believing obedience, and he will grow up and grow old and see his children's children playing around his staff in the streets of Beulah.  Let any young man make the experiment for himself upon obedience and upon Beulah.  Let him not too easily believe any dreamer or even any seer about obedience and about the land of Beulah.  It is his own matter and not theirs; and let him make experiment upon it all for his own satisfaction and assurance.  Let any young man, then, try prayer as his first step into obedience, and especially secret prayer.  Let him shut his door to-night, and let him see if he is not already inside one of the gates of Beulah.  Let him deny himself every day also, if it is only in a very little thing.  Let him say sternly to his own heart every hour of temptation, No! never! and on the spot a sweet waft of Beulah's finest spices will fall upon his face.  \\\"The ineffable joy of renouncing joy\\\" will every day make the lonely wilderness of this world a constant Beulah to such a man.  For, to live at all times, in all places, and in all things for other men, and never and in nothing for yourself--that is the deepest secret of Beulah.  To say it, if need be, three times to-night on your face and in a sweat of blood, \\\"Not my will, but Thine be done!\\\"--that will to-night turn the garden of Gethsemane itself into the very garden of Glory.  Do you doubt it? Are you not yet able to believe it?  Then hear about it from One who has Himself come through it.  Hear His word upon the whole matter who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.  \\\"Come unto Me,\\\" says the King of Beulah, \\\"all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.  Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.  For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.\\\"  So after He had washed their feet, and had taken His garments and was set down again, He said unto them, \\\"Know ye what I have done to you?  For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you. If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.  If ye love Me, keep My commandments.  And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you for ever. If a man love Me, he will keep My words; and My Father will love him, and We will come unto him and will make Our abode with him. Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you:  not as the world giveth, give I unto you.  These things have I spoken unto you that My joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full. Hitherto ye have asked nothing in My name; ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.  Father, I will that they also, whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where I am.\\\"  And thus I saw in my dream that their way lay right through the land of Beulah, in which land they solaced themselves for a season.\",\"timestamp\":1641296144,\"title\":\"Ease to the body some, none to the mind From restless thoughts, that like a deadly swarm Of hornets armed no sooner\"},\"digest\":\"8WF8FByydrDKzMq-jjh8Zlta5cAeW8jsbRjCbXEdwLc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xADCB4dF6dDE8773EbfDdd36e426C63f9732738c9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Aj_W5njqp70pt87rkGhLUuOybgEmErb60bJJF6IdYpo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0VCXsEdIR7xecITZa4V9qkxJx3pk92Zy2bU8FivsWQY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"zXxSv5-YSyTLJyC9rTIwNJ04F0b__4uzU8TxQH_B7f8dU05FlTbGWQbedaJ-d9DssrzA_BGqmiRFf-Hb0wd2jw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5cc90695ea2206e9d7ceb0eb44ac7e362b2fa56bcc392637ca07ae91f21f075629e73eede81056fa6e3880d451903ace702f187090007f593ba70c55195032881b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Aj_W5njqp70pt87rkGhLUuOybgEmErb60bJJF6IdYpo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0VCXsEdIR7xecITZa4V9qkxJx3pk92Zy2bU8FivsWQY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"8WF8FByydrDKzMq-jjh8Zlta5cAeW8jsbRjCbXEdwLc\"}"
