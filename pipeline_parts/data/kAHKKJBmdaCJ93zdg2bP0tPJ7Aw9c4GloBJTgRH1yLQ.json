If you are, please check the following links to get basic understanding of Gala platform and Town Star Game.\\n\\nGala \\n\\n[https://app.gala.games/](https://app.gala.games/)\\n\\nTown Star\\n\\n[https://townstar.com/?utm_source=Platform&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=ts_townstarwebsite_platform&utm_id=ts_townstarwebsite_platform_1](https://townstar.com/?utm_source=Platform&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=ts_townstarwebsite_platform&utm_id=ts_townstarwebsite_platform_1)\\n\\nLogic:\\n\\n1\\\\.  How to play to earn?\\n\\nYou can take the weekly competition. If you have a significant rank, you will get the bonus.\\n\\nOR\\n\\nYou can benefit from the NFTs. Getting some from early bird airdrop and sell for money. Getting some from running a Gala Node. Getting some from the Opensea and sell at better price.\\n\\nOR\\n\\nYou can just accomplish the daily task and collect the $TOWN reward. The $TOWN token is currently 0.89 USD.\\n\\n2\\\\.  How to Earn $TOWN\\n\\nThe first two options I mentioned above will not be explained any further. You can do your research if you like them. I am now explaining the last option.\\n\\nCurrently, the game offers only 1 daily task: Reaching 10000 stars to get X $TOWN. The  “X” determined by your Gala power and NFT holding.\\n\\n3\\\\.  How to reach 10000 stars?\\n\\nEach time you trade your goods, will win you some stars. The number of stars each trade is determined by the kind of goods. Every resource in the game is limited at the very beginning. And you should make yourself above the breakeven line to survive as the first challenge. After that you should continue to step into the precedule of producing the gasoline, so that you can still get stars in the next several days.\\n\\nIf you finished the work above, congratulations, you has meet one of the criterias to collect $TOWN.\\n\\n4\\\\.  What else is needed?\\n\\nAs I mentioned, you need to have Gala power and NFTs in your Gala account. Otherwise, you can only get 0 $TOWN after you finish the daily task.\\n\\nYou can open a Gala account on the official website. Actually it will guide you to finish a wallet set up. Thus you will own a Ethereum wallet after the account registered. And you need to deposit some $GALA in order to have gala power. Then you can buy NFTs from the market in Gala Platform or from the Opensea. \\n\\n5\\\\.  My Experience?\\n\\nIn my research, I bought the Mr. Puddles for 0.27 ETH, thought it was the cheapest. Based on my Level 1 Gala Power and 1 Mr. Puddles, I can have 9 $TOWN every day if I finish the daily task.\\n\\n6\\\\. Opinions?\\n\\nIt is a great game, but not a great P2E game.\\n\\nThe point is that if you want to play it well or at least get more $TOWN everyday, you need more NFTs on your farm. The NFTs are very useful utilities to give you advantages in the game by the way. And the number of NFTs you are allowed to use is limited by your Gala power, which means you need to deposit satisfying number of $GALA token. Normally, the NFTs will be firstly go public on the game store market and then go to the secondary market like the Opensea. Some NFTs will be airdropped to your account, but valuable or tradeable or not, it depends. In my research, I found out the price of some of the NFTs are not satisfying in the secondary market. But some of the unique NFT such as Mirandus Vox Dragon sold for 1.48m USD today seems still fascinating. I have not got an opportunity to research that, so I have no comment on it.\\n\\n7\\\\.  Conclusion\\n\\nAs $TOWN is supplied by the Gala platform other than Town Star, and the game mechanisms are tending to guiding players to buy more $GALA, thus I assume most of other games on the platform could be the similar mechanism. So, we got the key.\",\"timestamp\":1640707673,\"title\":\"Gamefi Research - Town Star\"},\"digest\":\"eZF1WgZBrWNnweWY0fg0fH9a7-_Rro-ph4frBnnXSQg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd49A5f128318874dE690EBf2c85623232008D964\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"yq4wf7o8B8RHfxgWyHSYEhLdUsH9gb7YLFM10lbcOG0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"B-yvSeaSPr7M1-9b29K5osj0PDUYWLJBjfyKRaZ3CRY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"YI0iQ3ajo03gvS4kpt9TEFF3T0GbA6FLqqvLB76OSPjSJG28WXAbZtBAIwFVCykoQ4g3AeqMQ71Ylxht42GLFQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe7acf200afb76eb5e21ea244be4095f791b95ed05866c67a49279adbef2cf0355c39af4d968e5adaee46a8665df5781a714c23ab032acc8e84f199b37d8545a41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"yq4wf7o8B8RHfxgWyHSYEhLdUsH9gb7YLFM10lbcOG0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"B-yvSeaSPr7M1-9b29K5osj0PDUYWLJBjfyKRaZ3CRY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"eZF1WgZBrWNnweWY0fg0fH9a7-_Rro-ph4frBnnXSQg\"}"
