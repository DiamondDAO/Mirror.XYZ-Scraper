The two parties will jointly explore the possibilities of technology integrations, and work together to build a cross-chain DeFi ecosystem.\\n\\nCeler Network is a layer-2 scaling platform that brings fast, secure and low-cost blockchain applications on Ethereum, Polkadot and other blockchains to mass adoption. Celer launched the world’s first Generalized State Channel Network and continues to push the frontier of layer2 scaling with advanced Rollup technology. Applications and middlewares like CelerX, cBridge, layer2.finance and more built on Celer have attracted more than one million users in the gaming, DeFi and blockchain interoperability space.\\n\\nWePiggy focuses on building an open-source, non-custodial crypto-asset lending market protocol that helps users realize asset appreciation and maximize utilization across many blockchain networks. On the premise of giving priority to funding security, WePiggy actively creates a more diverse lending market, optimizes the execution efficiency of smart contracts, and expands more dimensions of the business logic. Under the WePiggy multi-chain deployment plan, WePiggy is covering Ethereum, OKExChain, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Huobi Eco Chain, and innovative public and Layer-2 networks.\\n\\n## WePiggy + Celer Network\\n\\nWePiggy and Celer Network have reached an agreement on the cross-chain DeFi ecosystem building. The cooperation will move forward steadily in stages according to the will of both parties.\\n\\nAs the first step, WePiggy will add an entrance in its application to give users an alternative solution of cross-chain bridge, called “cBridge”, which is powered by Celer Network.\\n\\nThe core development team will also, at the appropriate time, propose to list $CELR through a community proposal. This will help connect the WePiggy community to the Celer Network community and allow Celer Network to better integrate into WePiggy’s DeFi ecosystem.\\n\\nMore features, such as diversified portfolio management, cross-chain asset transfer and lending, will be released to $CELR token holders in the future.\\n\\n***“Celer cBridge enables instant, low-cost and ANY-to-ANY value transfer, which is a very useful feature for the most users. Through this cooperation, we can expand WePiggy’s influence to a larger user base and provide them with secure, powerful and user-friendly cross-chain DeFi applications.”***\\n\\n***– Ron, Zheng, Founder and CEO of WePiggy***\\n\\n***“WePiggy is undoubtedly a pioneer in DeFi lending space with a clear vision in the multi-chain and layer-2 world. We hope to work with WePiggy in a long-term partnership to reduce the user friction for multi-chain DeFi applications. ”***\\n\\n– ***Mo Dong, Cofounder of Celer Network***\\n\\n## About WePiggy\\n\\nWePiggy is an open-source, non-custodial, crypto asset lending market protocol.
