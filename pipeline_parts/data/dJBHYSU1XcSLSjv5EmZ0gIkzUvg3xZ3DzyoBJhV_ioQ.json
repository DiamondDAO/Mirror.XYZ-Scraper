In that era, it was used to refer to a registered cohabitation relationship that did not marry. As of today in 2140, the word marriage has long become a text that only exists in history textbooks, and it has died out all over the world.\\n\\n娜娜和我是sambo的关系。这个词据说是源自于古代北欧斯堪的纳维亚半岛上的瑞典语。在那个年代，它被用来指称一种不结婚的登记同居关系。到了2140年的今天，婚姻（marriage）一词早已成为只存在于历史课本上的文字，而在全世界范围内都消亡了。\\n\\nIt is not only marriage that has been swept into history by time, but also going to work (employment system). Due to the highly developed productivity and the advancement and popularization of AI (artificial intelligence) and robotics technology, almost all tasks that were originally completed by humans have been taken over by machines. UBI (Universal Basic Income) has long been realized, and people no longer work to make a living. People are liberated from work and can freely choose and allocate time in labor, rest, study, entertainment, etc. based on their own interests and hobbies, and according to their own talents. Making money is no longer the purpose of any behavior, everything is for the better growth of people and the experience of happiness. In addition to UBI, there are only two ways to make extra money: entertainment and rest. This is to motivate people not to over-indulge in labor and study, sleepless sleep and food, and exhaust their bodies.\\n\\n同样被时间扫进历史故纸堆里的不只有婚姻，还有上班（雇佣制度）。由于生产力的高度发达，AI（人工智能）和机器人技术的进步和普及，几乎所有原本靠人完成的工作都已经由机器接管。UBI（全民基本收入）早已实现，人不再为了需要赚钱糊口而工作。人从工作中解放了出来，可以凭自己的兴趣爱好，以及根据自己的天赋特长，自由地选择和分配时间在劳动、休息、学习、娱乐等各个方面。赚钱已经不再是任何行为的目的，一切都是为了人更好地成长和获得幸福的体验。除了UBI之外，额外赚钱的方法只有两个：娱乐和休息。这是为了激励人们不要过度沉迷于劳动和学习，废寝忘食，累坏了身体。\\n\\nIn the morning, Nana arranged a study course on gene editing early. After breakfast, she will rush to the North Center to attend a practical class. She took this course very seriously, because she had a good wish to personally participate in the design of our first child.\\n\\n上午娜娜早早地就安排了基因编辑的学习课程。吃过早饭，她就要赶去北方中心参加实践课。这门课她学的特别认真，因为她有个美好的愿望，就是要亲自参与设计我们两人的第一个孩子。\\n\\nThe word childbirth has changed its meaning in this era. It no longer refers to a woman using the uterus to conceive and give birth to a baby, but refers to the process of genetically designed fertilized eggs to grow and produce in an incubator machine. Women have been completely liberated from production, and men and women have achieved a higher degree of equality. Applicants for childbirth have priority to adopt babies born out of them. Raising a child will bring an increase in the basic income of the raiser to cover the cost of raising. All processes and equipment are free. Childbirth is regarded as an important and outstanding contribution.\\n\\n生产孩子这个词在这个时代已经改变了它的含义，不再指女性使用子宫孕育婴儿并将其诞出，而是指经过基因设计的受精卵在孵化机器中生长并产出的过程。女性从生产中彻底解放了出来，男女两性实现了更高程度上的平等。生产申请人可以优先领养产出的婴儿。养育孩子会为养育者带来基本收入的增加，以覆盖养育成本。所有的流程和设备都是免费的。生育孩子被视为是一项重要而杰出的贡献。\\n\\nI forcibly endured the beating of my heart and the tumbling of thoughts, and finished my breakfast peacefully. Seeing that Nana had finished eating, I got up and packed the used tableware into the sink, and calmly waved goodbye to Nana who was about to go out. After washing the tableware, I turned and went into the study, locked myself in it. Only then can I really take a long breath, relax myself, calm my thoughts.\\n\\n我强忍着心脏的狂跳和思想的翻江倒海，平静地吃完了早饭。见娜娜也吃完了，我起身把用过的餐具收拾到水池里，平静地和要出门的娜娜挥手告别。洗完了餐具，我转身进了书房，把自己反锁在里面。这时我才真的可以长呼一口气，让自己放松下来，冷静地理一理思绪。\\n\\nWhen my mood calmed down, I double-checked the original UTXO amount used by Nana to transfer me 2 satoshis. The result is unequivocal, clearly 42069 Satoshi. Although I haven't seen this figure for many years, once I see it, I still feel so familiar and familiar. I can hardly be more familiar with this number. This is what Su Lin liked to play with me most during her lifetime. She often uses this stalk when making bitcoin transfers with me.\\n\\n待心情平复下来以后，我再次仔细检查了娜娜给我转账2聪所用原始UTXO的金额。结果确凿无疑，清清楚楚地就是42069聪。虽然已经有好多年不见这个数字，但是一旦看到，却仍然是感到如此的亲切和熟悉。我对这个数字简直无法更熟悉了，这就是苏琳生前最喜欢和我玩的一个梗。她常常在和我做比特币转账时用这个梗。\\n\\nSu Lin likes to study archeology. She said that this stalk came from the ancient and mysterious East, and it was a very, very old and beautiful stalk. But as for the answer to the mystery, she never told me. Every time I asked her, she always said, wait, I will know when the time comes. But until she left unexpectedly, there was no time to tell me the answer.\\n\\n苏琳喜欢钻研考古学，她说这个梗来自古代神秘的东方，是一个非常非常古老而美丽的梗。但是至于梗的谜底，她却一直都没有和我说。每一次我问她，她总是说，等等吧，等时机到了我自然就会知道。可是一直到她意外离去，也没有来得及告诉我答案。\\n\\nI can hardly contain the excitement that I have to figure out this matter. What I want to figure out is not the answer to the mystery, but is Su Lin's true body (dharmakaya) still alive after so many years? However, Su Lin is not a name in my current metaverse, but in another metaverse. I noticed and remembered the current Bitcoin block height displayed on the wall clock, which is the Bitcoin block time. Then, I handed my avatar to the AI hosting and operation, and logged out the meta-universe \\\"Plato\\\" where I was currently located from the coordinate position of the study.\\n\\n我难以抑制住自己必须要搞清楚这件事的激动。我要搞清楚的，不是梗的谜底，而是这么多年过去，苏琳的真身（dharmakaya）还活着吗？不过，苏琳并不是我当前所在元宇宙（metaverse）中的一个名字，而是在另外一个元宇宙里面。我留意并记忆了一下墙上钟表里显示的当前比特币区块高度，也就是比特币的区块时间。然后，把自己的化身（avatar）交给了AI托管运行，从书房的坐标位置登出了我当前所在的元宇宙“柏拉图”（Plato）。\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DxCdc4lovXdaOmja2zHqt.jpg?height=830&width=1920)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639141336,\"title\":\"Good morning, Nana｜早安，娜娜——Chapter Two｜第二章\"},\"digest\":\"JjgsxnHOiz7fl0xyNgrhICGXtaSgZtKBuSxXkRUzeYc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x43B004D591808B79cAe88F29C32Fff781Aee0e11\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"J0K6WSYCAiNsDyfYKfNQUBwz5Y2DHM1lClyZHsES8J8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"T756lTat5fLMyTAcCBeRUgArjhma_41p1QdFqw3bY4E\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"gwRJwwXMeHaCWLCDDGQ1d1GlM9cZVYiCWX2O-x9ztigM5wJVcvIrAZy_-9TlHP0sRHAT8nkIEwEDezrpXDQbaQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4499ae3483ae8a062ad6bae21a5f5564218c00d5d5f042da8178ab89b45bad5221946568fb243bbb56120558dea32ce17d5fc49e7f8609949a27d439840d69591b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"J0K6WSYCAiNsDyfYKfNQUBwz5Y2DHM1lClyZHsES8J8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"T756lTat5fLMyTAcCBeRUgArjhma_41p1QdFqw3bY4E\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"7sqfehLIoEEtWG4gyNrUQbZF_R4LIqrR3arof9RK-PA\"}"
