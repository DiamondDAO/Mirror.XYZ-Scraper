"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Among the booming crypto gaming projects, a new game called Warcraft Civilization Hegemony (WCH) is catching my eyes, which I found more amusing after I did my research. Check out the storyline here first.\\n\\nIn 2077, a group of adventurous humans sent their consciousness back to the age of Warcraft...\\nTyria is in chaos, if you want to survive here, there is only one way to go, fight. You start to transfer assets to this world through the space-time tunnel, thereby recruiting more heroes to fight for you. In order to make your camp stronger, you start to upgrade your heroes and army with all your efforts...\\n\\nAt the same time, brand new civilizations and technologies are unfolding in front of you. Middle-earth, medieval, modern and future civilizations are waiting for you to experience … ​\\n\\nI know I know, can't wait to know more? You are in the right place as today I  will review this game for you as comprehensive as possible.\\nGame Overview\\nWCH is a new massive online game running on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). In this game, players will play the role of a Warcraft lord, recruit heroes, challenge PVP/PVE, level up in the game, obtain treasure chest fragments to synthesize NFT treasure chests. With the endless battle going on, the land of Warcraft will become chaotic, and you will lead your Warcraft to build your territories and fight against various external forces.\\n\\nWCH has inherited some classic elements to pay respect to the 27-year-old game \\\"World of Warcraft\\\", and developed a game based on the hottest play-to-earn (P2E) mode.\\nEconomic Model\\n$WCH\\nWCH will run the economy with $WCH as the governance token.\\n\\n$WCH\\nTotal supply: 500,000,000,000\\n\\nAllocation Ratio:\\nInitial liquidity: 8%\\nSeed round: 5%\\nInstitutional Round: 7.5%\\nIDO: 1%\\nTeam and development: 15%\\nMarketing purpose: 10%\\nEcosystem and Incentives: 53.5%\\n\\nAs the governance token of Warcraft Civilization Hegemony, $WCH can be used to participate in governance and voting, enabling the holders with certain voting powers in the decision-making regarding the future direction of the game itself. At the same time, $WCH holders will receive regular airdrops of gold coins. In addition, $WCH will be needed to perform certain key operations in the game, such as, initiate a battle, mint scarce equipment, and top-level copies.\\n\\nGold Coin\\nGold coins are the circulating tokens in the Warcraft Civilization Hegemony.\\nTotal amount of gold coins: 25,000,000,000\\n\\nAllocation ratio:\\nYield-farming: 19,000,000,000\\nInitial liquidity: 5,000,000,000\\nRaised fund output: 1,000,000,000\\n\\nGold tokens will be generated through yield-farming, and they could be used for upgrading the heroes, minting new equipment, covering the employment cost, synthesizing new materials, etc.\\n\\nThe new WCH world will come into shape after the the gold coins are farmed out.\\n\\nIn the new WCH world, the player can choose to farm under the governance of a lord and pay the tax. Otherwise, the player can try to build alliances, fight from north to south, to become a lord to get additional earnings. It should be noted that, the income from a land does not belong to a specific player, yet it belongs to the DAO that governs the land. It will be the DAO that decides how to allocate the income.\\n\\nThe hero with level of 60+ will be able to enter the WCH kingdom to be part of the Kingdom, Guild or Community DAO, to fight for his own territory. Being in charge of the territory means being in charge of the resources to generate economic income. By then, the players will be allowed to battle in a specific territory, where the lord of the territory will be able to charge tax to the profit of players. Owning a land will bring huge profit, which will motivate the players to interact with each other, to come up with strategies, to recruit more heroes to maximize their profit.\\n\\n**Utilities of $WCH and Gold Coins\\n$WCH**\\n\\n1. WCH will be needed to initiate a PVP battle, the 10% of collected WCH will be used to buyback NFTs and burn. The rest 90% will be locked up in the pool for ecosystem construction of the game.\\n2. Part of the WCH paid by the players to purchase NFT treasury chests from the official platform will be locked up.\\n3. Out of the 5% transaction fee in the NFT market, 3% will be locked up in the pool for ecosystem construction of the game.\\n4. Along with the booming metaverse ecosystem, there will be more utilities for WCH, where the more WCH will be staked, the less WCH will be in circulation.\\n\\nGold Coins\\n\\n1. Gold coins can be used to upgrade the heroes and will be burnt as a result.\\n2. There will be farms with 6 different levels. After the primary-level farm is open, the yield of gold coins will decrease gradually. There will be higher farming yield in the higher-level farm because of the allocated incentives, where only heroes with certain levels can access.\\n3. The farmed gold coins will have to be refined in the refinery. 30% of the gold coins will be deducted if the players want to accelerate the refining process and get them out in the 1st day, where this deduction fee will decrease gradually in the following days, and it will be only 6% in the 5th day.\\n4. With more and more game stories involved, there will be a mystery furnace where the players can use gold coin and materials to mint the equipment NFTs for their heroes and create new heroes.\\n5. With the evolving of WCH world, the resources will be scarcer, so the heroes have to keep strengthening themselves until they can survive the new world. By then the heroes can group together to cultivate new attributes. It should be noted that there is a certain chance that this cultivation fails.\\n\\n   \\n   **How to Play**\\n   1. PVP Battle The hero can battle PVP 20 times per day at maximum, after which they can earn certain amount of fragments of treasure chest and experience. A complete treasure chest can be synthesized when 1000 of fragments are accumulated, which can be opened with a NFT key and get some gold coins, potions, runes, or heroes in different categories.\\n\\nThe hero can upgrade when experience of 100 is reached.\\n\\nPlayers can play for the ladder leaderboard, and the top players in each season will win rewards.\\n\\nPlayers choose the corresponding battlefield level according to the level of their heroes\\n\\nRookie Arena (Level 1-20)\\n\\nAdvanced Arena (Level 21-40)\\n\\nArena (Level 41-60)\\n\\nThe higher the league level, the better the reward.\\n\\nPlayers can choose the enemy they want to fight against, or they can battle by random match.\\n\\nWhen a player’s hero challenges an opponent's hero, each challenge in the primary battlefield consumes 50 WCH. The winner of the battle gets a reward.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8aNWXZ3de1dS6M_TtXA97.png?height=434&width=783)\\n\\n2\\\\. Dungeon Adventure\\n\\nWhen the player’s hero reaches level of over 60, the three heroes can team up to challenge the territory dungeon.\\n\\nTerritory adventure is the most passionate and exciting part of the game. Kill monsters, challenge bosses, and battle for territories to plunder treasure chests. Gold coins, materials, skill books, top-notch equipment, you name it.\\n\\nDungeon adventures include both single-player and team-player (multiple players) modes.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hQ8yIGahNs1p0AogRoTvK.png?height=436&width=784)\\n\\n3\\\\. Yield Farm\\n\\nThe hero can farm when certain amount of gold coins are staked, where the hero also needs a NFT mining pick to enable that. The hero will deliver new pack of mines (yields) every hour, and the player will need to claim them consistently. The delivery of new mines will be paused if the player does not claim the mines in time, as the backpack of the hero will be full.\\n\\nHero\\n\\nClass of Hero\\n\\nThe hero recruited by the player will be randomly assigned a class. At present, these classes include Warrior/Assassin/Wizard/Templar/Shaman/Hunter. More classes will be supported in the future along with the updates of the game, even for some legendary hidden classes.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MNMHu3xyxXkX227xlHsG-.png?height=395&width=808)\\n\\nAttributes of Hero\\n\\nThe heroes recruited by the player have multiple attributes: strength, agility, physique, intelligence, will, spirit, etc. The values of these attributes are highly relevant to class of the hero.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3BFeFIGx17DxGp9XX50rM.png?height=440&width=793)\\n\\nBattle\\n\\nDuring the battle, the hero's multiple battle attributes will directly affect the outcome of the battle. These battle attributes include: health point, damage, defense, magic resistance, hit, combat skills, talent, skill, etc.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YZLHTtyuRooK9SOc7pWgy.png?height=421&width=818)\\n\\nMysterious Treasure Chest\\n\\nThe treasure chest is an independent NFT. The player will accumulate the fragments of treasure chest to synthesize a complete one, which can only be opened with a NFT key. Most of the rare heroes are generated from the treasure chest, where only 5% is from the treasure chest sold by the official platform and the rest 95% will be earned by players in the game. Only 1 million heroes will be generated from the treasure chest, and there will be no more heroes from the treasure chest after this number is reached.\\n\\nFragments of Treasure Chest\\n\\nAfter playing against each other in the PVP ladder, the player will get treasure chest fragments, a total amount of 1,000 of which can be further synthesized to form a treasure chest in the player’s backpack. The treasure chest is an independent NFT, which contains:\\n\\nPotion\\n\\nThe potion from the treasure chest can be used to upgrade the hero in category R.\\n\\nPotion can also be used to boost the damage of the hero. The player can choose to use potion to temporarily increase the damage of the hero when they are in the bad situation in the battle.\\n\\nIt should be noted that potion is consumable and could not be stacked to increase its effect.\\n\\nKey\\n\\nThe key will be needed to open the treasure chest.\\n\\nMining Pick\\n\\nThe mining pick will be needed by the hero for yield farming.\\n\\nRune\\n\\nThe runes from the treasure chest can be used to upgrade the hero in categories SR and SSR.\\n\\nHero\\n\\nHeroes are in categories of N, R, SR and SSR.\\n\\n**Roadmap**\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lp7dcfRw0GZ4E88mqwJ8o.png?height=447&width=824)\\n\\nHighlights\\n\\n1. Plentiful game challenges. Either the single-player or multi-player dungeon adventure is so exciting. The PVP mode adds another layer of flexibility for the player to fight and interact with each other, definitely a bonus. Besides the battle, the hero can be staked for yield-farming as well. You may also notice that there will be more features released soon, according to their White Paper, e.g., you will be able to synthesize high-tier hero from low-tier heroes.\\n2. Potential of Expansion. WCH is just the first step of this gaming metaverse. After the release of all the 1 million heroes, there will be a totally new stage with evolved game mechanism, along which the player will experience different civilizations from middle-earth, medieval, modern and future civilizations. In a nutshell, WCH is not just a game, it will be metaverse consisting of multiple games and civilizations.\\n3. Inclusion of DAO. WCH will be the first one to run crypto gaming with DAO. The interaction between the community and developers, as well as the following gaming launchpad vision will all contribute positively back to the DAO. Along with this process, as the governance token of this DAO, there will be huge potential for $WCH to appreciate its value.\\n\\nThese comments are based on my understanding of WCH, which is worthy of huge recommendations although more details of the investors await revealing.\\n\\nOfficial Links\\nWebsite：<https://wch.gg/>\\n\\nTwitter：<https://twitter.com/warcraft_ch>\\n\\nTelegram：<https://t.me/WarcraftCivilizationHegemony>\",\"timestamp\":1640786106,\"title\":\"A New Play-to-Earn On-Chain Game | Warcraft Civilization Hegemony \"},\"digest\":\"D3LZLmfJ0rJzg7gOzqXm5QmyuH03gHO7JOt29OuT2DM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7b83C3e82457838A697f440a714688794d424E03\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_R1b0TFBQPkFS2XM7VeRgyDSFhR3OUUHX3dlx0jUjiw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2JZT3UxWPP0n3WKpioNw41pmK71WdCOttP3uk4jpJ2g\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"N8ylpvXwmLIgMj8oT9i-FdOduMXFBFiizqqBGA5673SismJqlS2042iIFVSu4b-W2itZVR4Ohcl3sMd2asFEBw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd4efcf740b7f22813409acc2479232480d11c0c38c0ce2a223f2b14f70560b957fb63d49b25c80c6b6add4de120996d77bba3e3a472c41b0685d337cfcdd47d31b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_R1b0TFBQPkFS2XM7VeRgyDSFhR3OUUHX3dlx0jUjiw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2JZT3UxWPP0n3WKpioNw41pmK71WdCOttP3uk4jpJ2g\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"D3LZLmfJ0rJzg7gOzqXm5QmyuH03gHO7JOt29OuT2DM\"}"
