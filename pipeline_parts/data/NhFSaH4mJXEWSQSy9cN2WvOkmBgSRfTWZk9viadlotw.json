As its benefits raised a huge public interest, problems and risks came along. \\n\\n![Current DeFi TVL (10/19/2021) - https://defipulse.com/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z5RU0UfJovzLcd4zJtTOD.png?height=834&width=1367)\\n\\n[https://defipulse.com/](https://defipulse.com/)\\n\\nDeFi allows every user to use decentralized applications and protocols in order to have a complete control over their wealth and their financial decisions, without any intermediaries, via smart-contracts.\\n\\nNevertheless, it is not a perfect environment. \\n\\nDeFi has suffered from many exploits :\\n\\n* Flashloans \\n* Wallet hacks\\n* DEX hacks\\n* Rugpulls\\n* etc…\\n\\n  \\n---\\n\\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/fr/currencies/lossless/](https://coinmarketcap.com/fr/currencies/lossless/)\\n\\nThe vision of **Lossless** is to create a trustable DeFi ecosystem with very low risks and potential losses due to hacks. Lossless provides a “piece” of code which any developer can implement in their contract. \\n\\nThis code gives **Lossless** the power to freeze any fraudulent transaction, if one is detected via a set of parameters.\\n\\nThis is the first project to include such feature. Some of its indirect competition are :\\n\\n* [Kaspersky Blockchain security](https://www.kaspersky.com/blockchainsecurity/)\\n* [Slowmist](https://www.slowmist.com/en/#home)\\n* [ABDK Consulting](https://abdk.consulting/)\\n* [Bugcrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n> ### $LSS token :\\n>\\n> **Token utility:**\\n>\\n> * **Finders Staking** : In order to join the Lossless community and be eligible for finders fees, white hackers must stake $5,000 worth of LSS tokens before a hack freeze can occur. If the hack is false, however, staked tokens can be confiscated from finders.\\n> * **Finders Fees :** Community Finders are paid in LSS tokens after the fee is collected from the hacked project.\\n> * **LSS Token Governance :** LSS governance token functionality will also be introduced. This functionality will allow active users (white hackers who are actively engaged in the Lossless ecosystem and have staked their LSS tokens) to provide feedback and make suggestions about the protocol, roadmap, various parameters, and the whole codebase.\\n> * **Promotion and Referral program :** To further increase our popularity and recognition in the crypto world, as well as acquire more token creators and hack finders to our platform, we will do different promotions and launch a referral program. We will pay different influencers, audit companies, other platforms, blogs, and social media accounts their bonuses for referrals in LSS tokens. On top of that, all the airdrops that help to control the liquidity of our wallets will be sent in LSS Tokens, as well.\\n> * **Early Access and Insights :** TOP LSS token holders will have early and exclusive access to our newest product features, tools, and the latest cybersecurity insights. To show how much we value our loyal customers and community members, we will also create invite-only initiatives for people who hold a certain amount of LSS tokens.\\n>\\n> [https://lossless-cash.gitbook.io/lossless/#lossless-token](https://lossless-cash.gitbook.io/lossless/#lossless-token)\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nMore technical information and one usecase on the **Lossless** whitepaper and website. \\n\\n### Website :\\n\\n[https://lossless.cash/](https://lossless.cash/)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Whitepaper :\\n\\n[https://lossless-cash.gitbook.io/lossless/](https://lossless-cash.gitbook.io/lossless/)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Integration :\\n\\n[https://lossless-cash.gitbook.io/lossless/lossless-integration](https://lossless-cash.gitbook.io/lossless/lossless-integration)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Personal analysis of the project (NFA) :\\n\\nI myself have suffered from DeFi exploits, rugpulls and flashloans on different chains, not to name any.\\n\\nHaving such a project can be really helpful for DeFi’s future and longevity.\\n\\nThere are hundreds of millions of cryptocurrencies holders, but only a small % of them actually benefit from blockchain’s potential and DeFi. Most of them are scared or just don’t know anything about what we’re building. At the current stage of things, we are clearly years if not decades early.\\n\\nDecentralized is the future of finance, I am a convinced DeFi and blockchain user. \\n\\n**Lossless** can help the ecosystem attract millions of new users and reduce people’s fear and doubts to transform these into curiousity. This project will definitely help speed up mass adoption if they meet our expectations. \\n\\nMoreover, the project still has a very low marketcap (\\\\~$30 millions) and the $LSS token has plenty of room to grow.\\n\\n![Current roadmap (10/19/2021)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IZ7JvwoYsNW05DsgcfjDL.png?height=921&width=1887)\\n\\n![Lossless partners - https://lossless.cash/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3n0YNn-wnTM750zU-uXwb.png?height=828&width=1829)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1634644962,\"title\":\"A safer DeFi - Lossless ($LSS)\"},\"digest\":\"vIyvVmoF_yzvBrv7jkNHHxWlhcx-bZzr2LATdQtluLM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5feFDb8E576BDA70f63E8e8EdaAc7426C67C6B5a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xYKSWiwUyKC5_264AeaXwyCOYmzhS-wk0284OWqHW_I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8qH8NhzJy4ED1PJUHB0fuh7f8PGHqLzmQGcu5ZKTHKM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"5m6GQAyVkjALsgqDAOSmvopfzlhOyYGis5NoKoUqtvW_iMHOF6vZS3y9gDUPf1NohHaK64TeGucB1j86nhWwCw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf46a0983dd75e10ebb261cbebafb9f21dc7ac5be3d69cac54dcee9864b1b57d36a77b65725873206e6d410a53ef21ea7dc44c0d39061231f59e32eeb62f3c16f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xYKSWiwUyKC5_264AeaXwyCOYmzhS-wk0284OWqHW_I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8qH8NhzJy4ED1PJUHB0fuh7f8PGHqLzmQGcu5ZKTHKM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"tVmc3Bm2lK8L1Yw9XXcc6acQeafvugmAK2nf6VuLRrg\"}"
