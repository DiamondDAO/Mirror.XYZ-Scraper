"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The most valuable thing you can do as a creator is to develop a deep relationship with your audience. A loyal audience will help spread your message like wildfire and buy whatever you put out. The quickest and most effective way to build this deep connection is by getting them to consume your content bank. A content bank is your YouTube page filled with 2-10 minute topic clips repurposed from your podcast that educate or entertain around a certain topic. The videos are titled with SEO in mind and have the proper tags so that when people search for similar topics, yours show up. YouTube has become its own search engine and is one of the prominent ways younger generations educate and entertain themselves. The goal is to make these topic clips easily discoverable and get your audience to spend as much time binging them to satisfy their curiosities and be entertained. This will help them get to know you and your expertise at a deeper level.\\n\\nWe need to get people from 0 to the content bank though, so we provide shorter clips as support to bring awareness and interest. For awareness, we focus on short 10-30 second clips for Twitter, IG Stories, IG reels, TikTok, and Youtube Shorts. A quick pop of entertainment or wisdom. We then hit them with 30-120 second clips that tell a brief story, raise a question, or entertain them to get them interested in seeking out more information. These clips live on Twitter, IG, and LinkedIn. All clips are branded and include an intro and outro to hammer the branding \\\\~ vibe \\\\~ into potential listeners' brains. The combination of shorter clips tease the topic clips and full podcast episodes. It’s a classic sales funnel, just from a content perspective. We move them down the funnel by making them aware, creating interest, and then encouraging them to take action. Once the listener has watched enough content and consumed what you have to offer, they’ll continue to listen to new content and buy what you put out.\\n\\nOnce you build a loyal following, which can take years, the goal is to decentralize from social media platforms and own all your content. We aren’t there yet, but the future is coming, and it is decentralized. Once you have a loyal following, they’ll follow you anywhere. We help you get off the major media platforms and monetize content directly through your website, Patreon, NFTs, and more as new platforms and protocols are released. Currently, creators rent out their content to platforms in exchange for a share of the profits. In the future, creators will own all their own content and make more money by monetizing directly through their audience and cutting out the middleman. We are staying on the cutting edge of decentralized monetization strategies for content creators and will help with this transition once it becomes more relevant to you.\\n\\nDoes this strategy interest you? Reach out and we can have a conversation about it, I want to hear your thoughts.\\n\\n\\\\-mk\",\"timestamp\":1640828350,\"title\":\"Content Bank - YouTube Clip Content Strategy\"},\"digest\":\"rKxcp17i9DG2WDWxjLAUqqtv8MgHetXW_jV8dvtQy8E\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x955c38FC81B60dA6da1BbC6b4EBd168B70FF3744\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"DsRXap1axl--PNJCc6KbZkz1QvDz3VWo003QFM9ryHQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"iAu_7Es8zN-JTpDOWVkDgXnIXA0ovVLMDod30aIW-Lo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"1Ahp4z1Wl6qlmum6l1-P4AZszGeTrmELjK_2VIixvEvMebkYi7BDv-MF3e4-ArZJ4IIOj_nsTk0B_u0HXKb2Fw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc4886e4fc5ece36f76f67bb821298af8aea0a8bf88c692abf20e18a04990a1cf1a56acd6d376685ce9c0fd8ab5e0bdbec147e7900f0eb4310311e7724abc88341c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"DsRXap1axl--PNJCc6KbZkz1QvDz3VWo003QFM9ryHQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"iAu_7Es8zN-JTpDOWVkDgXnIXA0ovVLMDod30aIW-Lo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"L5-x8lHUQ_YHoMItkKnFpcqHQ7X-fiprkv6ECcOSsHM\"}"
