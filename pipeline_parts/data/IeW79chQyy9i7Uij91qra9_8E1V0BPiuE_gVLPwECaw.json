Healthcare services also deteriorated amid a growing number of COVID-19 cases.\\n\\nRasheed said it was completely unfair that developing countries are being asked to \\\"pay the price\\\" for the \\\"mess\\\" made by developed countries.\\n\\nNadim Farajalla, director of the Climate Change and Environment Program at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon, said Iraq has the resources and assets to enable it to meet its green goals, but it would still need help to wean off oil.\\n\\nHe said developed countries can provide the scientific and technological knowledge to help developing countries develop clean energy.\\n\\n\\\"It is incumbent upon the United States, first and foremost, and then the Europeans, and then the Arab world to support Iraq,\\\" he said.\\n\\n**Less polluting practices**\\n\\nFarajalla said developing countries should also take the responsibility to adopt less polluting practices and should leapfrog, rather than take a step-by-step approach toward sustainable and clean energy.\\n\\nAt last month's COP 26 climate conference in Scotland, Iraqi Deputy Minister of Health and Environment Jasim Abdulazeez Humadi called for a \\\"fair\\\" fight in climate action in an interview with the Riyadh-based newspaper Arab News.\\n\\nHe said the richest and most developed countries have not fulfilled their commitments to tackle climate issues.\\n\\nSujata Ashwarya, associate professor at the Centre for West Asian Studies at the Jamia Millia Islamia University in New Delhi, noted that Iraqi authorities have been collaborating with European firms to expand the country's renewable energy capacity.\\n\\nThis includes a deal with French oil company TotalEnergies to build a 1-gigawatt solar plant in the Basra region.\",\"timestamp\":1639751896,\"title\":\"Iraq needs help for shift to clean energy, analysts say\"},\"digest\":\"KkqpiJxQOq4eGY7PXaABjz7gAcmzBALQf6ahKHfEKBk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x855FF86E6dE80B029e533FC91F253A5008Ce69F7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kDhqvNyKkgAoyZ7D7HPJ4lVFefYpfaIRTVkGjbscydg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"a3ceTckqp6o7kJ0SXPdF0ouzO49WPS-X48-JEJsioxA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"w8Nib9zewDlKZ1gBtdgDqHvh_35QNLvHvXqRxeD7yng82Jr5ud1TTYzmO2XJW37JbrXBxY9n-mD8ZYPWoCdfrg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc29ec9212fe5c2e4d05bc4144f50beff2084fec74ce86447d6cef735de408c08019131f6c9813276df626cbffc5dc1dd46ff2ca42c0133812f985f380234e65f1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kDhqvNyKkgAoyZ7D7HPJ4lVFefYpfaIRTVkGjbscydg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"a3ceTckqp6o7kJ0SXPdF0ouzO49WPS-X48-JEJsioxA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"KkqpiJxQOq4eGY7PXaABjz7gAcmzBALQf6ahKHfEKBk\"}"
