"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"it was written in the eighteenth century. Twenty-seven reports of\\n\\nreceptions of neophytes followed, the last in the fatal year of 1792.\\n\\nThen came a blank of fourteen years; after which the register began\\n\\nagain, in 1806, with the appointment of Bordin as attorney before the\\n\\nfirst Court of the Seine. And here follows the deed which proclaimed\\n\\nthe reconstitution of the kingdom of Basoche:--\\n\\nGod in his mercy willed that, in spite of the fearful storms which\\n\\nhave cruelly ravaged the land of France, now become a great\\n\\nEmpire, the archives of the very celebrated Practice of Maitre\\n\\nBordin should be preserved; and we, the undersigned, clerks of the\\n\\nvery virtuous and very worthy Maitre Bordin, do not hesitate to\\n\\nattribute this unheard-of preservation, when all titles,\\n\\nprivileges, and charters were lost, to the protection of Sainte-\\n\\nGenevieve, patron Saint of this office, and also to the reverence\\n\\nwhich the last of the procureurs of noble race had for all that\\n\\nbelonged to ancient usages and customs. In the uncertainty of\\n\\nknowing the exact part of Sainte-Genevieve and Maitre Bordin in\\n\\nthis miracle, we have resolved, each of us, to go to Saint-Etienne\\n\\ndu Mont and there hear mass, which will be said before the altar\\n\\nof that Holy-Shepherdess who sends us sheep to shear, and also to\\n\\noffer a breakfast to our master Bordin, hoping that he will pay\\n\\nthe costs.\\n\\nSigned: Oignard, first clerk; Poidevin, second clerk; Proust,\\n\\nclerk; Augustin Coret, sub-clerk.\\n\\nAt the office.\\n\\nNovember, 1806.\\n\\nAt three in the afternoon, the above-named clerks hereby return\\n\\ntheir grateful thanks to their excellent master, who regaled them\\n\\nat the establishment of the Sieur Rolland restaurateur, rue du\\n\\nHasard, with exquisite wines of three regions, to wit: Bordeaux,\\n\\nChampagne, and Burgundy, also with dishes most carefully chosen,\\n\\nbetween the hours of four in the afternoon to half-past seven in\\n\\nthe evening. Coffee, ices, and liqueurs were in abundance. But\\n\\nthe presence of the master himself forbade the chanting of hymns\\n\\nof praise in clerical stanzas. No clerk exceeded the bounds of\\n\\namiable gayety, for the worthy, respectable, and generous patron\\n\\nhad promised to take his clerks to see Talma in \\\"Brittanicus,\\\" at\\n\\nthe Theatre-Francais. Long life to Maitre Bordin! May God shed\\n\\nfavors on his venerable pow! May he sell dear so glorious a\\n\\npractice! May the rich clients for whom he prays arrive! May his\\n\\nbills of costs and charges be paid in a trice! May our masters to\\n\\ncome be like him! May he ever be loved by clerks in other worlds\\n\\nthan this!\\n\\nHere followed thirty-three reports of various receptions of new\\n\\nclerks, distinguished from one another by different writing and\\n\\ndifferent inks, also by quotations, signatures, and praises of good\\n\\ncheer and wines, which seemed to show that each report was written and\\n\\nsigned on the spot, \\\"inter pocula.\\\"\\n\\nFinally, under date of the month of June, 1822, the period when\\n\\nDesroches took the oath, appears this constitutional declaration:--\\n\\nI, the undersigned, Francois-Claude-Marie Godeschal, called by\\n\\nMaitre Desroches to perform the difficult functions of head-clerk\\n\\nin a Practice where the clients have to be created, having learned\\n\\nthrough Maitre Derville, from whose office I come, of the\\n\\nexistence of the famous archives architriclino-basochien, so\\n\\ncelebrated at the Palais, have implored our gracious master to\\n\\nobtain them from his predecessor; for it has become of the highest\\n\\nimportance to recover a document bearing date of the year 1786,\\n\\nwhich is connected with other documents deposited for safe-keeping\\n\\nat the Palais, the existence of which has been certified to by\\n\\nMessrs. Terrasse and Duclos, keepers of records, by the help of\\n\\nwhich we may go back to the year 1525, and find historical\\n\\nindications of the utmost value on the manners, customs, and\\n\\ncookery of the clerical race.\\n\\nHaving received a favorable answer to this request, the present\\n\\noffice has this day been put in possession of these proofs of the\\n\\nworship in which our predecessors held the Goddess Bottle and good\\n\\nliving.\\n\\nIn consequence thereof, for the edification of our successors, and\\n\\nto renew the chain of years and goblets, I, the said Godeschal,\\n\\nhave invited Messieurs Doublet, second clerk; Vassal, third clerk;\\n\\nHerisson and Grandemain, clerks; and Dumets, sub-clerk, to\\n\\nbreakfast, Sunday next, at the \\\"Cheval Rouge,\\\" on the Quai Saint-\\n\\nBernard, where we will celebrate the victory of obtaining this\\n\\nvolume which contains the Charter of our gullets.\\n\\nThis day, Sunday, June 27th, were imbibed twelve bottles of twelve\\n\\ndifferent wines, regarded as exquisite; also were devoured melons,\\n\\n\\\"pates au jus romanum,\\\" and a fillet of beef with mushroom sauce.\\n\\nMademoiselle Mariette, the illustrious sister of our head-clerk\\n\\nand leading lady of the Royal Academy of music and dancing, having\\n\\nobligingly put at the disposition of this Practice orchestra seats\\n\\nfor the performance of this evening, it is proper to make this\\n\\nrecord of her generosity. Moreover, it is hereby decreed that the\\n\\naforesaid clerks shall convey themselves in a body to that noble\\n\\ndemoiselle to thank her in person, and declare to her that on the\\n\\noccasion of her first lawsuit, if the devil sends her one, she\\n\\nshall pay the money laid out upon it, and no more.\\n\\nAnd our head-clerk Godeschal has been and is hereby proclaimed a\\n\\nflower of Basoche, and, more especially, a good fellow. May a man\\n\\nwho treats so well be soon in treaty for a Practice of his own!\\n\\nOn this record were stains of wine, pates, and candle-grease. To\\n\\nexhibit the stamp of truth that the writers had managed to put upon\\n\\nthese records, we may here give the report of Oscar's own pretended\\n\\nreception:--\\n\\nThis day, Monday, November 25th, 1822, after a session held\\n\\nyesterday at the rue de la Cerisaie, Arsenal quarter, at the house\\n\\nof Madame Clapart, mother of the candidate-basochien Oscar Husson,\\n\\nwe, the undersigned, declare that the repast of admission\\n\\nsurpassed our expectations. It was composed of radishes, pink and\\n\\nblack, gherkins, anchovies, butter and olives for hors-d'oeuvre; a\\n\\nsucculent soup of rice, bearing testimony to maternal solicitude,\\n\\nfor we recognized therein a delicious taste of poultry; indeed, by\\n\\nacknowledgment of the new member, we learned that the gibbets of a\\n\\nfine stew prepared by the hands of Madame Clapart herself had been\\n\\njudiciously inserted into the family soup-pot with a care that is\\n\\nnever taken except in such households.\\n\\nItem: the said gibbets inclosed in a sea of jelly.\\n\\nItem: a tongue of beef with tomatoes, which rendered us all\\n\\ntongue-tied automatoes.\\n\\nItem: a compote of pigeons with caused us to think the angels had\\n\\nhad a finger in it.\\n\\nItem: a timbale of macaroni surrounded by chocolate custards.\\n\\nItem: a dessert composed of eleven delicate dishes, among which we\\n\\nremarked (in spite of the tipsiness caused by sixteen bottles of\\n\\nthe choicest wines) a compote of peaches of august and mirobolant\\n\\ndelicacy.\\n\\nThe wines of Roussillon and those of the banks of the Rhone\\n\\ncompletely effaced those of Champagne and Burgundy. A bottle of\\n\\nmaraschino and another of kirsch did, in spite of the exquisite\\n\\ncoffee, plunge us into so marked an oenological ecstasy that we\\n\\nfound ourselves at a late hour in the Bois de Boulogne instead of\\n\\nour domicile, where we thought we were.\\n\\nIn the statutes of our Order there is one rule which is rigidly\\n\\nenforced; namely, to allow all candidates for the privilege of\\n\\nBasoche to limit the magnificence of their feast of welcome to the\\n\\nlength of their purse; for it is publicly notorious that no one\\n\\ndelivers himself up to Themis if he has a fortune, and every clerk\\n\\nis, alas, sternly curtailed by his parents. Consequently, we\\n\\nhereby record with the highest praise the liberal conduct of\\n\\nMadame Clapart, widow, by her first marriage, of Monsieur Husson,\\n\\nfather of the candidate, who is worthy of the hurrahs which we\\n\\ngave for her at dessert.\\n\\nTo all of which we hereby set our hands.\\n\\n\\\\[Signed by all the clerks.\\\\]\\n\\nThree clerks had already been deceived by the Book, and three real\\n\\n\\\"receptions of welcome,\\\" were recorded on this imposing register.\\n\\nThe day after the arrival of each neophyte, the little sub-clerk (the\\n\\nerrand-boy and \\\"gutter-jumper\\\") laid upon the new-comer's desk the\\n\\n\\\"Archives Architriclino-Basochiennes,\\\" and the clerks enjoyed the\\n\\nsight of his countenance as he studied its facetious pages. Inter\\n\\npocula each candidate had learned the secret of the farce, and the\\n\\nrevelation inspired him with the desire to hoax his successor.\\n\\nWe see now why Oscar, become in his turn participator in the hoax,\\n\\ncalled out to the little clerk, \\\"Forward, the book!\\\"\\n\\nTen minutes later a handsome young man, with a fine figure and\\n\\npleasant face, presented himself, asked for Monsieur Desroches, and\\n\\ngave his name without hesitation to Godeschal.\\n\\n\\\"I am Frederic Marest,\\\" he said, \\\"and I come to take the place of\\n\\nthird clerk.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Monsieur Husson,\\\" said Godeschal to Oscar, \\\"show monsieur his seat\\n\\nand tell him about the customs of the office.\\\"\\n\\nThe next day the new clerk found the register lying on his desk. He\\n\\ntook it up, but after reading a few pages he began to laugh, said\\n\\nnothing to the assembled clerks, and laid the book down again.\\n\\n\\\"Messieurs,\\\" he said, when the hour of departure came at five o'clock,\\n\\n\\\"I have a cousin who is head clerk of the notary Maitre Leopold\\n\\nHannequin; I will ask his advice as to what I ought to do for my\\n\\nwelcome.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That looks ill,\\\" cried Godeschal, when Frederic had gone, \\\"he hasn't\\n\\nthe cut of a novice, that fellow!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We'll get some fun out of him yet,\\\" said Oscar.\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\nLA MARQUISE DE LAS FLORENTINAS Y CABIROLOS\\n\\nThe following day, at two o'clock, a young man entered the office,\\n\\nwhom Oscar recognized as Georges Marest, now head-clerk of the notary\\n\\nHannequin.\\n\\n\\\"Ha! here's the friend of Ali pacha!\\\" he exclaimed in a flippant way.\\n\\n\\\"Hey! you here, Monsieur l'ambassadeur!\\\" returned Georges,\\n\\nrecollecting Oscar.\\n\\n\\\"So you know each other?\\\" said Godeschal, addressing Georges.\\n\\n\\\"I should think so! We got into a scrape together,\\\" replied Georges,\\n\\n\\\"about two years ago. Yes, I had to leave Crottat and go to Hannequin\\n\\nin consequence of that affair.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What was it?\\\" asked Godeschal.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, nothing!\\\" replied Georges, at a sign from Oscar. \\\"We tried to\\n\\nhoax a peer of France, and he bowled us over. Ah ca! so you want to\\n\\njockey my cousin, do you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We jockey no one,\\\" replied Oscar, with dignity; \\\"there's our\\n\\ncharter.\\\"\\n\\nAnd he presented the famous register, pointing to a place where\\n\\nsentence of banishment was passed on a refractory who was stated to\\n\\nhave been forced, for acts of dishonesty, to leave the office in 1788.\\n\\nGeorges laughed as he looked through the archives.\\n\\n\\\"Well, well,\\\" he said, \\\"my cousin and I are rich, and we'll give you a\\n\\nfete such as you never had before,--something to stimulate your\\n\\nimaginations for that register. To-morrow (Sunday) you are bidden to\\n\\nthe Rocher de Cancale at two o'clock. Afterwards, I'll take you to\\n\\nspend the evening with Madame la Marquise de las Florentinas y\\n\\nCabirolos, where we shall play cards, and you'll see the elite of the\\n\\nwomen of fashion. Therefore, gentleman of the lower courts,\\\" he added,\\n\\nwith notarial assumption, \\\"you will have to behave yourselves, and\\n\\ncarry your wine like the seigneurs of the Regency.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hurrah!\\\" cried the office like one man. \\\"Bravo! very well! vivat!\\n\\nLong live the Marests!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What's all this about?\\\" asked Desroches, coming out from his private\\n\\noffice. \\\"Ah! is that you, Georges? I know what you are after; you want\\n\\nto demoralize my clerks.\\\"\\n\\nSo saying, he withdrew into his own room, calling Oscar after him.\\n\\n\\\"Here,\\\" he said, opening his cash-box, \\\"are five hundred francs. Go to\\n\\nthe Palais, and get from the registrar a copy of the decision in\\n\\nVandernesse against Vandernesse; it must be served to-night if\\n\\npossible. I have promised a PROD of twenty francs to Simon. Wait for\\n\\nthe copy if it is not ready. Above all, don't let yourself be fooled;\\n\\nfor Derville is capable, in the interest of his clients, to stick a\\n\\nspoke in our wheel. Count Felix de Vandernesse is more powerful than\\n\\nhis brother, our client, the ambassador. Therefore keep your eyes\\n\\nopen, and if there's the slightest hitch come back to me at once.\\\"\\n\\nOscar departed with the full intention of distinguishing himself in\\n\\nthis little skirmish,--the first affair entrusted to him since his\\n\\ninstallation as second clerk.\\n\\nAfter the departure of Georges and Oscar, Godeschal sounded the new\\n\\nclerk to discover the joke which, as he thought, lay behind this\\n\\nMarquise de las Florentinas y Cabirolos. But Frederic, with the\\n\\ncoolness and gravity of a king's attorney, continued his cousin's\\n\\nhoax, and by his way of answering, and his manner generally, he\\n\\nsucceeded in making the office believe that the marquise might really\\n\\nbe the widow of a Spanish grandee, to whom his cousin Georges was\\n\\npaying his addresses. Born in Mexico, and the daughter of Creole\\n\\nparents, this young and wealthy widow was noted for the easy manners\\n\\nand habits of the women of those climates.\\n\\n\\\"She loves to laugh, she loves to sing, she loves to drink like me!\\\"\\n\\nhe said in a low voice, quoting the well-known song of Beranger.\\n\\n\\\"Georges,\\\" he added, \\\"is very rich; he has inherited from his father\\n\\n(who was a widower) eighteen thousand francs a year, and with the\\n\\ntwelve thousand which an uncle has just left to each of us, he has an\\n\\nincome of thirty thousand. So he pays his debts, and gives up the law.\\n\\nHe hopes to be Marquis de las Florentinas, for the young widow is\\n\\nmarquise in her own right, and has the privilege of giving her titles\\n\\nto her husband.\\\"\\n\\nThough the clerks were still a good deal undecided in mind as to the\\n\\nmarquise, the double perspective of a breakfast at the Rocher de\\n\\nCancale and a fashionable festivity put them into a state of joyous\\n\\nexpectation. They reserved all points as to the Spanish lady,\\n\\nintending to judge her without appeal after the meeting.\\n\\nThe Marquise de las Florentinas y Cabirolos was neither more nor less\\n\\nthan Mademoiselle Agathe-Florentine Cabirolle, first danseuse at the\\n\\nGaiete, with whom uncle Cardot was in the habit of singing \\\"Mere\\n\\nGodichon.\\\" A year after the very reparable loss of Madame Cardot, the\\n\\nsuccessful merchant encountered Florentine as she was leaving Coulon's\\n\\ndancing-class. Attracted by the beauty of that choregraphic flower\\n\\n(Florentine was then about thirteen years of age), he followed her to\\n\\nthe rue Pastourel, where he found that the future star of the ballet\\n\\nwas the daughter of a portress. Two weeks later, the mother and\\n\\ndaughter, established in the rue de Crussol, were enjoying a modest\\n\\ncompetence. It was to this protector of the arts--to use the\\n\\nconsecrated phrase--that the theatre owed the brilliant danseuse. The\\n\\ngenerous Maecenas made two beings almost beside themselves with joy in\\n\\nthe possession of mahogany furniture, hangings, carpets, and a regular\\n\\nkitchen; he allowed them a woman-of-all-work, and gave them two\\n\\nhundred and fifty francs a month for their living. Pere Cardot, with\\n\\nhis hair in \\\"pigeon-wings,\\\" seemed like an angel, and was treated with\\n\\nthe attention due to a benefactor. To him this was the age of gold.\\n\\nFor three years the warbler of \\\"Mere Godichon\\\" had the wise policy to\\n\\nkeep Mademoiselle Cabirolle and her mother in this little apartment,\\n\\nwhich was only ten steps from the theatre; but he gave the girl, out\\n\\nof love for the choregraphic art, the great Vestris for a master. In\\n\\n1820 he had the pleasure of seeing Florentine dance her first \\\"pas\\\" in\\n\\nthe ballet of a melodrama entitled \\\"The Ruins of Babylon.\\\" Florentine\\n\\nwas then about sixteen. Shortly after this debut Pere Cardot became an\\n\\n\\\"old screw\\\" in the eyes of his protegee; but as he had the sense to\\n\\nsee that a danseuse at the Gaiete had a certain rank to maintain, he\\n\\nraised the monthly stipend to five hundred francs, for which, although\\n\\nhe did not again become an angel, he was, at least, a \\\"friend for\\n\\nlife,\\\" a second father. This was his silver age.\\n\\nFrom 1820 to 1823, Florentine had the experience of every danseuse of\\n\\nnineteen to twenty years of age. Her friends were the illustrious\\n\\nMariette and Tullia, leading ladies of the Opera, Florine, and also\\n\\npoor Coralie, torn too early from the arts, and love, and Camusot. As\\n\\nold Cardot had by this time acquired five additional years, he had\\n\\nfallen into the indulgence of a semi-paternity, which is the way with\\n\\nold men towards the young talents they have trained, and which owe\\n\\ntheir success to them. Besides, where could he have found another\\n\\nFlorentine who knew all his habits and likings, and with whom he and\\n\\nhis friends could sing \\\"Mere Godichon\\\"? So the little old man remained\\n\\nunder a yoke that was semi-conjugal and also irresistibly strong. This\\n\\nwas the brass age for the old fellow.\\n\\nDuring the five years of silver and gold Pere Cardot had laid by\\n\\neighty thousand francs. The old gentleman, wise from experience,\\n\\nforesaw that by the time he was seventy Florentine would be of age,\\n\\nprobably engaged at the Opera, and, consequently, wanting all the\\n\\nluxury of a theatrical star. Some days before the party mentioned by\\n\\nGeorges, Pere Cardot had spent the sum of forty-five thousand francs\\n\\nin fitting up for his Florentine the former apartment of the late\\n\\nCoralie.
