Ownership shares economic, social and political components, creating best practices for digital coordination.” - [@Coopahtroopa](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw)*\\n\\nDAOs are ‘organisations-as-code’ - a set of smart contracts that run entirely autonomously on public ledgers (blockchains) where all resources, decisions, and ownership can be seen in real-time by anyone.\\n\\nThis radical transparency levels the playing field in terms of commercial advantage and trade secrets, meaning organisations are forced to compete directly on culture and the shared value they create for their users.\\n\\n![Audacity.fund, building the next 100 years of new markets powered by culture and community](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/03xtoPNzeF1IoDr42hf-u.png?height=857&width=1579&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&)\\n\\n[Audacity fund](https://www.audacity.fund/) puts it well in that culture and community are becoming the new asset classes, and in this world, everything is decentralised, with this new economy rewarding contributors, collaborators, and creators.\\n\\nIf companies organised the industrial age, then DAOs are organising the Internet age.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/awrigh01/status/1437032638720663558](https://twitter.com/awrigh01/status/1437032638720663558)\\n\\nAnd DAOs are effectively online communities, powered up by bank accounts and governance.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/awrigh01/status/1383423710569197577](https://twitter.com/awrigh01/status/1383423710569197577)\\n\\nIt’s this [intertwining of financial assets with social capital](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/gWY6Kfebs9wHdfoZZswfiLTBVzfKiyFaIwNf2q8JpgI) that is the real magic of DAOs, because perhaps the biggest limiting factor in most self-organising communities up to now has been their lack of ability to monetise and reward the people who work in them.\\n\\nCryptocurrencies change that for the better, allowing communities to create and hold their own treasury, mint their own tokens, and use these tokens to reward participation and contribution towards the community’s shared values.\\n\\nAs we’ve started to see over the last year with the explosion of DeFi (decentralised finance), finally the financial frameworks and tools (whilst mostly unregulated for now), are allowing communities to start capturing value through buying and selling these community tokens to early adopters and users of their communities, taking early crowdfunding models like Kickstarter to entirely new levels.\\n\\nAnd this isn’t just a geeky fringe edging its way in slowly - peel back the onion, and you’ll see there’s a Cambrian explosion happening right under our very feet with DAOs, and the necessary infrastructure required to bring these communities to life.\\n\\n![DAO Landscape 2021 (partial) - coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CEck9Vp3W8QVWy_CUPADZ.jpeg?height=2160&width=3840&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&)\\n\\nIf you work in tech and `Web3, Blockchain, DAOs, DeFi, and NFTs` aren’t in your lexicon yet, you better upskill soon, as I predict that’s all anyone will be talking about in this space within the next year or so…\\n\\n## Friends With Benefits (FWB)\\n\\nPerhaps the most prominent example of this cultural revolution is an experiment in community building from Trevor McFedries, founder of the [Friends With Benefits](https://www.fwb.help/) DAO.\\n\\n![Is FWB the future of communities of shared values and interests?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WnXPk8LyGLY8DMg96M9H7.png?height=1206&width=1655&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&)\\n\\nFounded last year, FWB describes itself as the ultimate cultural membership powered by a community of our favourite Web3 artists, operators, and thinkers bound together by shared values, shared incentives ($FWB), and shared IRL + URL experiences.\\n\\nBut they didn’t start as a DAO.\\n\\nInitially FWB was a token-gated discord server attracting like minds to share their expertise, values, and thoughts in one place.  But this quickly evolved over a series of rapidly successful seasons (or experiments) to where it is today.\\n\\nTo join FWB, you must be referred in by an existing member, and also hold 75 $FWB tokens in your Web3 wallet (purchasable on a decentralised exchange).  These tokens, which once traded around $10 each, have risen to $50+ per token as the community creates more and more collective value.\\n\\nBy holding $FWB tokens, members not only get access to major benefits from exclusive events, content, and community, but are also literally invested in the community’s success, participating in the upside of the value they create together.\\n\\nThe beauty of this model allows community members to earn $FWB tokens from it’s own treasury for providing value in a number of ways, including being active in Discord, attending community calls, hosting recurring events and overseeing collaborative programs, and all of this is decided and rewarded by the community.\\n\\nThe FWB model [continues to evolve](https://zhang.mirror.xyz/9sRa2kNDUpkWoQkWw67bJ8PczFyTSX8fotf7JOddxew) as the community scales to more roles and better decentralised operational structure is put in place to manage that growth.  Last year they took in more traditional venture funding, but in a new model of governance and venture-funding, increasing the value of the $FWB token and the entire community’s wealth in the process.\\n\\n## What’s This Got To Do With Startup Community?\\n\\nEverything.\\n\\nBecause this evolution of community, to centre around collective ownership of ideas, products, values, and people is exactly what function a startup community serves to its founders, and to its member enablers.\\n\\nBut, with one big caveat:\\n\\n> *Until now, value in startup communities has mostly been captured by **founders and financiers**, and not the whole village of people that helped create that value in the first place (including mentors, advisors, programmes, and ecosystem connectors).*\\n\\nI’ve watched for decades in our startup community as community leaders come with  energy, passion, and dedication to help a new raft of startups grow.  They tirelessly put on events, they help teach founders the benefits of their experience through mentorship, they run focussed- ideation and growth programmes, and help give founders unfair advantage through their networks, but are rarely compensated for their efforts.\\n\\nAnd when those companies and founders ultimately become successful, the rewards go not to those who helped them on their journey, it mostly goes to those who invested financially in the company, rewarding only one type of capital (financial) and leaving social, network, and knowledge capital as ultimately second-class citizens.\\n\\nI can’t count the number of times I’ve seen these high-impact and high-energy leaders come into our community, be a bright spark, and then fizzle out soon after because there was no way for the community to reward their contribution other than with gratitude.\\n\\n> The community enablers that make up the fabric of the startup community rarely make the cap-tables of the companies they help grow, but are highly value-accretive to the *‘cap-table of the community’* as a whole.\\n\\nCommunity tokens with actual financial value seem an excellent solution to incentivising and rewarding this type of positive community behaviour, especially when it’s governed by the community itself.\\n\\n## Tokenising Startup Programmes?\\n\\nBut this burnout problem doesn’t just stop at people.\\n\\nI’ve seen the same problem in our *startup programmes*, our incubators, our accelerators, and other startup support systems too.\\n\\nIt happened to a virtual [community-led incubator experiment](https://blog.zeropoint.ventures/the-economics-of-government-led-founder-incubators-in-new-zealand-99b9109e7340) we piloted a few years ago.\\n\\nEach year these programmes and organisations have a fight to survive and beg for operating fund handouts from governments or over-committed sponsors.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nBecause whilst value in startups is *accreted* during the formative stages of getting to product-market fit, that value is only *realised* (and thus becomes liquid) at a stage where most startup support programmes, people, and networks are no longer connected to those companies, even though they’re often a part of what got them there in the first place!\\n\\nSome programmes might take equity out of these companies early or charge hefty programme fees up-front, but in many ecosystems, the mean-time-to-payback and venture maths of such small equity holdings doesn’t really scale to make this a useful stream of operating revenue to sustain such programmes.\\n\\nWhilst value creation is distributed across all startup ecosystem participants, it’s only really able to be captured by a few siloed, later-stage parts of that system.  Whilst this capital is often recycled into the next startups, rarely does it touch the community coffers to help support and grow the next generation.\\n\\nIn smaller communities like ours, such programmes aren’t connected to huge venture capital funds that can cover the operating costs out of fund management fees, and arguably, the venture capital business model is already so risky in the first place, that supporting this type of initiative is rarely a sensible move when return on investment drives most VC LP agendas.\\n\\nBut these people and programmes who are huge connectors of mentors, financial, social, and network- capital, and provides the energy and momentum to help founders push hard to breakthrough in their respective domains are so vitally important in helping build a vibrant startup community.\\n\\nWhat if that community did capture that value throughout the chain?\\n\\nWhat if the community itself was incentivised and rewarded to perform these functions themselves - finding great companies, referring them into the network, sharing their own knowledge as education and mentorship; connecting them to capital, customers, other mentors; and helping design and build the engine to keep the operating fabric of that required culture, processes, and incentives alive in the first place?\\n\\nWhat if early community members or supporters were given NFTs to reward early participation or investment, allowing new models of supporting community such as getting exclusive access to new initiatives like first right of refusals on certain investment deals, beta or premium access to new initiatives, events, or access additional distributions or earn passive income on their community tokens - the possibilities are endless....\\n\\nThis is Startup Community x Web3.\\n\\nFor those already operating in the Web3 world, we’re starting to see the rise of a new model to fill this gap: Investment DAOs, like MetaCartel, Angel DAO, Stacker Ventures, Komorebi, and Seed Club are a few examples.\\n\\nThese investment DAOs are community governed groups who seek to invest the combined capital of the community, but some are also starting to leverage the resources of the community to support those (mostly crypto-native) investments too with startup labs, accelerator programmes, and more.\\n\\n## Startup Culture x Community Values\\n\\nThe highly-aligned shared-value cultures we see in investment DAOs and social DAOs (like FWB), are really what set these communities apart.\\n\\nStartup communities are great exemplars of supportive, highly-aligned groups of people who love to help other founders get a leg up and be successful.\\n\\nLike the founders themselves, these communities have an altruistic spirit-of-service, who give before they get, and play a zero-sum game to make the community as a whole better.\\n\\nProgrammes like [YC](https://www.ycombinator.com/) and [OnDeck](https://www.beondeck.com/) have taken this culture to another level by effectively creating exclusive social memberships to do exactly that based on very clear cultural sets of aligned values (e.g. growth for YC, and spirit-of-service for OD).\\n\\nBut many of these startup support organisations still operate on centralised models who are governed by old-school models of control, which in these circles are still (VC) money (which as an aside, is still the biggest risk for true decentralisation in Web3 communities whereby governance tokens can be simply bought with the biggest wallet, rather than earned through biggest commitment to community service).\\n\\nThe real promise of Web3 is to take the power out of platforms and return it to the people where it belongs, and this is what excites me most about levelling up our startup communities and merging them with DAOs.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/joincolony/status/1483394234598105091](https://twitter.com/joincolony/status/1483394234598105091)\\n\\n## Scaling Culture in Startup Communities\\n\\nWhilst I’ve seen individual startup support programmes create amazing cultures, it often exists inside their own four walls rather than being shared across the community at large.\\n\\nIndeed our small, but highly-connected community last year was [rocked](https://jenenecrossan.medium.com/unfiltered-b7522d910963) by a high-profile suicide from a far too-young founder, with many commentators pointing the finger back to bullying by media and angry investors on social media.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/kcolbin/status/1466873534110580737](https://twitter.com/kcolbin/status/1466873534110580737)\\n\\nWhilst you’re going to get bad actors in any community, preventing this sort of outcome, is the sort of thing you hope that communities with shared-values and clear operating systems can put safeguards and support systems around.\\n\\nBut our current concept of startup community isn’t gated or policed by a set of commonly agreed-on principles or behaviours, so it’s prone to those bad actors who refuse to see the human underneath the entrepreneurial cloak of bravado that they are so often forced to wear to be ‘successful’ in this world.\\n\\nTragedies such as Jake’s make me think how can we create the conditions for a more supportive community that young founders can grow up in, with psychological and emotional safety guard-rails, understood by others because they know what the journey is really like, and where we’re all vested in the individuals’ success because it leads to the collective’s success.\\n\\n## The Future Of Startup Communities\\n\\nIn my mind Web3 and DAOs wrap up these startup community cultural aspects nicely.\\n\\n* DAOs are membership communities with a set of shared values and people who are closely aligned in group behaviour.\\n* Entry and value is created and can be rewarded by those who contribute to it in positive rather than negative ways, and those behaviours are defined by the community.\\n* DAOs are powered by cryptocurrencies which incentivise the collective to work together and increase the value of what they own, and builds wealth for everyone.\\n* By default, DAOs are equitable, inclusive, and fair with transparent compensation - web3 members are simply identified by a unique Web3 address and the value they deliver to the collective - not by gender, not by race, and not by their location.\\n* And DAOs build everything in public, laying bare culture, community, and forcing us to rethink delivering true value as our real competitive advantage.\\n\\nMake no mistake, even if you haven’t seen it yet - this is the new frontier of online communities and the future of work, and it’s heading at us with thunderous velocity.\\n\\n## BUIDLing The New Village\\n\\n> *The future is distributed in those who care to be curious, to explore the unknown, and think about better ways to support and grow the next generation of our future companies and leaders.*\\n\\nBringing all of those thoughts to a head...\\n\\nI strongly believe that crypto and DAOs will be the future of not only our global economies, but our digital and cultural interactions too.\\n\\nI believe that DAOs will underpin every values-aligned startup community around the world tomorrow.\\n\\nI thought I’d lost my community-building mojo over the last few years as I struggled to grasp what comes next.\\n\\nBut I’m boots into this new way of thinking about and building community.\\n\\nWhen I started building online communities 20 or so years ago, I helped onboard the first 2 million people onto the internet.\\n\\nI want to bring the next 2 million companies into this new Internet age and see them share the value with *all* of the people who helped them get there.\\n\\nWe all know it takes a village to raise a startup.\\n\\nI believe it takes a DAO to raise the next startup community.\\n\\n**And I want to help build that village.**\\n\\nA web3 village of values-aligned startup founders, operators, and community enablers who exist to to help people start companies, find talent, and create shared value through our collective networks and expertise.\\n\\nA village operating as a DAO on the blockchain, and is owned and governed collectively by its members, who are rewarded for positive value-adding behaviours to help the community grow.\\n\\n**I don’t know exactly how this new village could look and work, but I’d love for you to join me as I find out!**\\n\\nI’m all in -
