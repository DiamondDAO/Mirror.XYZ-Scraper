"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"This is a summary of *Some Economics of Property Rights (1965),* by Armen A. Alchian.\\n\\n### Defining property rights\\n\\n> Property rights are assigning to particular individuals the authority to select, for specific goods, any use from a non-prohibited class of uses. \\n\\nWhile there are many uses for a baseball bat, only some are *non-prohibited*. Using the bat to play baseball is fine, clubbing your neighbor over the head is not. Property rights allow the owner of the bat the right to choose what to do with it, so long as it is non-prohibited.\\n\\nAnd, if you use the bat to physically destroy your neighbour’s house or car, you’re violating their property rights as you’re interfering with how they can use their own property. However, if you decide to renovate your house such that people want to buy your house instead of your neighbors, you’re not violating their property rights. Even though you’re negatively affecting your neighbors, because you’re not affecting the way they use their property, it is not a violation of their property rights.\\n\\nTo clarify, property rights “does not imply that a person may use his property in any way he sees fit so long as no one else is hurt. Instead, it means “the right to use goods (or to transfer that right) in any way the owner wishes so long as the physical attributes or uses of all other people's private property is unaffected. \\\\[T\\\\]hat leaves plenty of room for disturbance and alienation of affections of other people.”\\n\\nProperty rights can be **partitioned**, such that different people own different parts. For example, someone may own the land, a farmer may own the wheat that grows on it, and someone else might own the right to create a road that runs through it.\\n\\nProperty rights can be **transferred**. It may be that the original owner of the right to create a road has less need for it than the farmer does to plant his wheat. The ownership of this right can be  transferred between them\\n\\nProperty rights can also be **shared**, such as in corporations, DAOs, sidewalks, and more.\\n\\n### Public versus private ownership\\n\\nWhile people may argue that the difference between public property and private property is that public property does not try to maximise profits. While this is true, there is no reason for this to be the case. With public property, the owners **can not sell their share of the public good.** Owners of private property can. This dramatically changes the cost-rewards system for owners of public property versus that of owners of private property.\\n\\n**Transferability** of private property has two major implications.\\n\\n* First, if you can transfer ownership of something, you can decide to own more of less of that thing. And, the more you own of something, the greater share of the upside and downside that you get, which in turn means that you have more responsibility over your actions as it pertains to that thing.\\n\\n\\n* Second, it opens up the possibility for *comparative advantage*. Often, we discuss comparative advantage in terms of labor. But, it can also be applied to ownership, in areas such as management. In this case, someone may want to gain more ownership of a company as they have a comparative advantage in management. Transferability allows for this to happen.\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nPrivate property allows you to choose to use your property as you see fit, so long as it does not physically alter someone else’s property. Property rights can be partitioned, shared, and transferred. The difference between private and public property is that with public property you don’t have transferability of ownership. This means that the upside and the downsides of any decision are less borne by the decision makers. Rather, they are shared equally across all the owners (i.e. society at large).\",\"timestamp\":1636595215,\"title\":\"Towards a theory of digital property rights.
