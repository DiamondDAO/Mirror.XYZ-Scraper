We’re happy to report that it went well! Over 80 Squiggles were received and DAO now has over 100, including two Hypers.\\n\\nRound 2 was designed to allow anyone to either join the DAO or to expand their voting influence by donating additional Squiggles (there was a limit of 1 in Round 1). Note, the SQUIG distribution amounts remain the same for this round. The only incentive for donating early was that you were guaranteed at least 1 spot. This time it’s different…\\n\\n## Guidelines for Participating in Round 2\\n\\n* View FAQs & Contribution Guide HERE\\n* Contribution period is CLOSED\\n\\n*The contribution limit has been reached.
