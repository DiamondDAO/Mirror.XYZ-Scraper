"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"When US President Joe Biden signed a bill to raise the government debt ceiling to 28.9 trillion U.S. dollars, Senator Cynthia Lummis called \\\"Thank God for Bitcoin (Thank God for Bitcoin).\\\" Senator Cynthia Lummis delivered a speech in the Senate on Thursday, presenting his views on how digital currencies such as Bitcoin may help countries such as the United States solve the looming crisis of cash shortages. Lummis said that one of the reasons she is so interested in non-statutory digital currencies such as Bitcoin is that these currencies are not issued by the government, so they are not affected by \\\"government accumulation\\\" debts such as the United States. Lummis believes that since cryptocurrencies are not subject to government and political elections, they should grow and exist, allowing people to save when the government fails. According to a previous CNBC report, US Senator Cynthia Lummis disclosed that on August 16 he purchased bitcoins worth between US$50,001 and US$100,000. The purchase appeared to have been disclosed outside the 45-day reporting deadline set by Congress. It is reported that the 2012 \\\"Stocks Act\\\" requires members of Congress to disclose the buying and selling of stocks, bonds and commodity futures within 45 days after the transaction. She previously stated that she had purchased Bitcoin for the first time in 2013 at a price of $330 each. It is reported that Lummis' Bitcoin disclosure has been censored before.\",\"timestamp\":1634314042,\"title\":\"Senator Cynthia Lummis commented on the U.S. raising the government debt ceiling: Fortunately, there is Bitcoin\"},\"digest\":\"DUqJGNT2VdSnlr7VueKJ5ZNB0WFrWqHZdD0knTzjB6E\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xB21aC2Bf5014b928B66534c159E06D89bb5a899f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jeJkRu97glpSvkM3fG0TGDnq0ouzSbbmO5DJJSk8QAo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3Sz9kpLPp5cvCzZ3ZaaO-AakTGaVh1iRPDtNwd0kSjY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"3H0C9TaUAT0F6EJvXaec-5bW97SZOW84-qL6aR5iQlZ5W_CBuI9QiF15AtSeingnu3KIufHJt6x-Du4C9GXwTQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd07a210ad80984b1de2fe7cbf9f838a970782adc49b5d83671cb97c27e53624e4e9fc03eca87db0087191afed4c41a304980dc672a20547c65011691387739ba1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jeJkRu97glpSvkM3fG0TGDnq0ouzSbbmO5DJJSk8QAo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3Sz9kpLPp5cvCzZ3ZaaO-AakTGaVh1iRPDtNwd0kSjY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"DUqJGNT2VdSnlr7VueKJ5ZNB0WFrWqHZdD0knTzjB6E\"}"
