With the multiplier, the NFT staking period will be a specific amount of time. We will provide a calculation formula in the latter parts.\\n\\n# NFT Mining\\n\\nThe Staking Game will create a balance of the tokenomics between face and items with a tight demand-supply relationship. Instead of letting NFTs lay in the wallet, MYPUNKS holders are able to mine extra NFTs by staking. \\n\\nTo participate in the Staking Game, a user has to **hold a combination (1 face with 1 item equipped). There are two pools that you can choose to mine.**\\n\\n### Face Mining\\n\\nBy staking the combination, you will be able to mine a face in a certain period. When the staking time is over, you can claim a face for free (but, definitely pay for the gas). Due to the limited supply of the faces, this mining pool will be closed when all the faces are mined.\\n\\n### Item Mining\\n\\nThe Item Mining Pool will be opened until all the items are sold out. You will be able to mine an item by staking your combination. The claiming process is pretty much the same as that of the face.\\n\\n### Mining Factors\\n\\nMining Factors will affect the staking time as well as the traits of the items and faces. \\n\\nThese factors are:\\n\\n1. Rarity Score of the Combination\\n2. Number of Items equipped on the Face.\\n3. Productivity Multipliers of the Item\\n\\n### Rarity Score of the Combination\\n\\nEach Item and Face will be tagged with a certain rarity score. The rarity score will help to determine the rarities of the faces and items being mined. The rarity score of the combination will be calculated by the sum of the items equipped on the face plus the face rarity. \\n\\n```\\nCombination_RS = ∑ITEM_RS + FACE_RS\\n```\\n\\nFor example, if you have 2 items with RS(rarity score) of 10 and 50, and a face with RS 40, your Combination RS will be 100. \\n\\nWith the higher Combination RS, you will have a better chance of getting rare items from mining.\\n\\n### Number of Items Equipped on the Face\\n\\nThe staking time will be directly affected by the number of items equipped on the face. When you stake the face, you will have a specific locking time until you can claim your face. The staking time will be reduced by the formula below. To talk about the formula, let us address the Productivity Multiplier first, which is also an important factor that directly affects the staking time.\\n\\n### Productivity Multiplier of Item\\n\\nEvery Item will have a productivity multiplier. The productivity multiplier varies based on the Token_Id. The productivity multiplier will help to determine the time reduction of mining a new NFT. This will work for both mining pools. The Staking Time Reduction will be calculated based on the following formula:\\n\\n```\\nStaking Period = Base Period * (∏(Item_PDM))\\n```\\n\\nThe ∏(Item_PDM) denotes the product of Item Productivity Multiplier.\\n\\nFor example, if you have three items equipped on the face with multipliers of: 1.05, 1.10, 1.15. Then your μ(Item_PDM) will be (1.05\\\\*1.10\\\\*1.15) = 1.328. If the base period is 336 hours, then your staking time will be reduced to 253 hours.\\n\\n# Extra Design: ERC-20 Governance Token\\n\\nThe staking model allows us to introduce a ERC-20 Governance Token, which helps to power up the system. A certain amount of ERC-20 token will be airdropped to the NFT holders based on the rarity scores. Some utilities of the ERC-20 will be cultivated as the project goes along. A few utilities that I’ve been thinking of:\\n\\n1. Use to open the blind boxes for items & faces that are higher rarities.\\n2. Build ERC-20 Staking pools to generate Faces and Items.\\n3. Staking Faces and Items to acquire ERC-20 rewards based on rarities.\",\"timestamp\":1641636722,\"title\":\"MYPUNKS NFT Game Model\"},\"digest\":\"vz5jGgI2UvXAJUFJ_O5YP91pSRQNRYGZGA7eq-mVuo4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xEcBeBC5F295C05BfDeC51bdCFDafB02D2E9a1179\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"G-jMFJVEhF81mu1G4M4RoiYbLQlEMmY0fgXoIKc3ctQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ryz8bioANuxh0mRRQQw_JCbfKBJuOKPXhFek-YvYvxw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"zEzU_5tKWGwn-lv2z09EPeR4NMfwq4ltStrWaEdAYZKkU3bsUcncFvpjNUKH1NvWZedDurxe52ZxLTSgpOJ3Ww\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x99452ff83f5481082c552ebd64294ef55f6f864176a1c02489daa392118880700f3d8774544f32283a50c4aea52a1fea5d1c21cdca6970c63d990cd3a9c451be1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"G-jMFJVEhF81mu1G4M4RoiYbLQlEMmY0fgXoIKc3ctQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ryz8bioANuxh0mRRQQw_JCbfKBJuOKPXhFek-YvYvxw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"-J9FlGKSP6LZ8Mf_n6apGYcXd9PfQa7BkWkoPg8Wucw\"}"
