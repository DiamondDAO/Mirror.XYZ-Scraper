"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"During the Sichuan earthquake, a teacher quickly fled the classroom. After the incident came to light, many people began to scold the teacher, saying that he should be a good teacher and that students should not be discarded.\\n\\n```\\nIn fact, when a person is in danger, it is instinct to run for his life. Some people just want to sacrifice others and fulfill themselves. Constantly educate others to be fools and to be smart. It is a pity that human instinct will help him become rational. Even if he promises you to be a fool, he will still be a smart person when things really happen. Therefore, as bosses, we should talk less about what we should do for the big family of the company and serve our customers less. In other words, there should be less corporate culture to brainwash employees. To put it in a high-sounding way, isn't it just trying to give employees less money, but also wanting employees to work hard for you.\\n\\nIt is difficult for anyone who makes this calculation to grow a company because it violates human nature. Employees only want to do it for themselves, not for others.\\n\\nWhat we have to do is to guide employees according to their selfish nature.\\n\\nIf we are the boss of a private university, we shouldn't let every teacher earn so much income for teaching with heart, and so much income for teaching without heart. We can run the school by selling teacher tickets. Teachers who don't care can only eat rice porridge, teachers who are careful can eat meat, and teachers who are careful can eat the delicacies of mountains and seas. This is the mutual use of employees based on their human nature. This is true justice. Moral people all day long like to say that education canâ€™t be for money. This kind of ethical people is actually the most unethical. Letting them run a business must be very inefficient. They think that all teachers should sacrifice themselves. In other words, they want to exploit the teachers without giving enough money. This can only make good employees change jobs, leaving a bunch of messy people to do things with you.\\n\\nThis is called being clever against being mistaken by cleverness. If you really want to promote the progress of a society, you must consider it from the perspective of interest. If you really want to do a good job in a company, you must also consider the interests of outstanding employees. Don't preach nonsense such as sacred mission all day long.\\n```\",\"timestamp\":1634802899,\"title\":\"To promote the progress of a society, we must think from the perspective of interests\"},\"digest\":\"KaagxhEu21bNqOMQlIls3k2efhNRtHL9qYeFV-sbFEg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0B27cE1053585ef548Cd78618Ee0b73D84246712\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FWHKuUadZNUD2AcIaH2jGL63PlPKxJxdB2P-UVSGKyo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TGI_NAnOwHtvZb-9m7wqNj24YxnrIjurKisiIm7dHV0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"krQuZltjpw3qhWxgkhBWGC72pE7Dxknwpg7bdBYglWz_H0Vq2RnqmBkoOeDd2v5jnsMKxKwh0WZErtz3jc1q0A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9d86f85b2660a8cb6873525924f9adb0c5f51dfb6229fed7a757ade2793c2f19347cb8076af39b12116743e30b34d1bacb42c80a0030cd272dd62c1ad0ad21081b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FWHKuUadZNUD2AcIaH2jGL63PlPKxJxdB2P-UVSGKyo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TGI_NAnOwHtvZb-9m7wqNj24YxnrIjurKisiIm7dHV0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"KaagxhEu21bNqOMQlIls3k2efhNRtHL9qYeFV-sbFEg\"}"
