He talked about making Europe a major continent for production, innovation and job creation to reduce dependence and to \\\"compete with China and the United States\\\".\\n\\nDing Chun, director of the Center for European Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, said that Macron, as someone promoting EU autonomy, will push forward and secure the sovereignty agenda as his political capital and legacy.\\n\\n\\\"He will maintain the status quo when it comes to relations with China,\\\" Ding said, citing Macron's recent announcement that France will not join the US in a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games.\\n\\nThe ratification of the China-EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment has stalled in the European Parliament due to tit-for-tat sanctions between the EU and China early this year. In a telephone conversation with China's President Xi Jinping on Dec 21, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz voiced his hope for an early ratification of the agreement.\\n\\nStanley Pignal, a writer for The Economist in Paris, said: \\\"France is one of two major EU powers. It steers the agenda whoever chairs EU meetings. Europe matters to Macron anyway. It would feature in the 2022 (French presidential) race.\\\"\\n\\nMacron has not formally announced he is standing for reelection, but many expect him to do so in the coming days.\\n\\nManon Aubry, a French member of the European Parliament, said that with France holding the EU presidency, \\\"Macron will instrumentalize it to support his electoral campaign\\\".\\n\\nMujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe of the political and corporate consultancy Eurasia Group, said Macron's agenda is too ambitious.\\n\\n\\\"Macron's extraordinary EU wish list went far beyond what can be even started, let alone finished\\\" in the six-month presidency, Rahman said.\\n\\n\\\"Emmanuel Macron may not be France's leader after April, but he spoke today as if he planned to be the leader of Europe for the next decade or more.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1640864546,\"title\":\"Macron lists priorities for a sovereign Europe\"},\"digest\":\"miDjhd4KgdY93lTvMeOhsFD2oeIlJN7lS7mYDLYJpH0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x703e93caDe9c1d2dEd6aCcDabb618B241F5D782C\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-5mOi7yJaw1jbpwuXwqzrzxqX1_g_MPGxMLhRay7T8c\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"aI5ztHvBGK1526ORCM7jjyA3RpvP-5WzcJClYz6ihVg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Xzyl6Z_Dw8mauoENToCR90bfCtlj3VKX1Ub0qHGi9bMRn0lt64cCNf55-zevMNvE-gEbspWvnlDRPZ2wFsWfEQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2c4d2802fc27ded7a71dc06d4d162bea05516e9b24ec5e1894c747fa6a112245037a87bd3e90c623827b8ee30e2a3402880a44551e19847b10f6c60bc05b36191c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-5mOi7yJaw1jbpwuXwqzrzxqX1_g_MPGxMLhRay7T8c\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"aI5ztHvBGK1526ORCM7jjyA3RpvP-5WzcJClYz6ihVg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"miDjhd4KgdY93lTvMeOhsFD2oeIlJN7lS7mYDLYJpH0\"}"
