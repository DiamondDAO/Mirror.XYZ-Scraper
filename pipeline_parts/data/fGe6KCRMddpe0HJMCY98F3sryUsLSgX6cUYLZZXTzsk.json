Kush Jones\\n\\nNew York’s independent dance community has regained some of its former lore during the last decade. A community of great venues, radio stations, artists and labels has birthed sweltering dance floors, new sounds and (some) renewed hope for the city’s dance culture. The entire spectrum of sounds and tropes is being represented - everything from ur sludgy deep reggaeton (DJ Python 4L) to ur blistering 140 techno (Umfang and Discwoman crew lets go). And Kush Jones is sitting square at the nexus of this new generation. Though he is maybe slightly less recognized than fellow techno producers, AceMo and MoMa Ready, there is simply no producer working in North America today with [a more exciting range and skillset](https://kushjones.bandcamp.com/). Like Martyn, Roman Flügel, Shed, Objekt, Moodymann, Eris Drew, other cross-genre, multi-disciplinary luminaries, it’s hard to describe the Kush Jones sound as anything other than an inspired texture. His tracks harness the pleasures of digital and analog tools with stand-out songwriting and exceptional dancefloor functionality. It’s that good good that takes you to work, holds your hand home then also wants to go out past 9…til 4..\\n\\n### 2. Bambii\\n\\nThe bias here is exceptional but I have to speak for a moment on my friend and former colleague, Bambii. For transparency, Bambii is one of my closest friends - we worked and went to parties together for six years as (iconic) artist-manager duo. She is also a mentor, therapist and excellent cook - don’t try and help when she’s in the kitchen. Almost as crucial, though, are her incredible and wide ranging contributions to the international dance underground, Toronto and beyond. Fundamentally, [the skills are just wicked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBZ6-5EjZa0) - a pronounced attention to vocally-driven dance music from every pocket of the world coalesces as a highly danceable, extremely wine-able, excursion through tempos, communities and expressions of kick+snare+hi hat. Her staple event, the bi-annual (on hiatus cuz COV) event [JERK](https://www.thefader.com/2018/08/06/caribana-toronto-jerk-streetstyle-summer-details), has grown from 200ish attendees to 2000+ in it’s six or so years of existence. Anyone with half a pulse in Toronto will tell you that it is a singular event with exactly zero rivals. Beyond her elite rave presence, Bambii is an active community organizer and a vocal cultural critic - her Facebook posts used to shake the internet, now her [Insta posts trigger the masses](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXG4u7Pp6ML/). As a producer, she’s just getting started - a series of singles with LA label Innovative Leisure is just a single step into the mind and abilities of one of dance music’s most compelling new tastemakers. That’s my shooter..\\n\\n### 3. Sam Gendel\\n\\nYou’re unlikely to find an indie music aficionado who is not featuring Sam Gendel’s album *Fresh Bread* on their best of 2021 list. There is something so perfectly kitsch about the sound - is it pastiche electronica? Is it a new take on ‘cool jazz’?  Whys it feel so good to listen to? Is it actually good? It’s this unknown quantity, the ghost in Gendel’s shell that has propelled his sound, via *[Fresh Bread](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3luuQQRuSBuDNnrkYvatnk?si=itHdIDCjSTyg6tQa_kOMzg)*[ and a host of successful collaborations](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3luuQQRuSBuDNnrkYvatnk?si=itHdIDCjSTyg6tQa_kOMzg), into the cov-era zeitgeist - the new jazz and ambient movements are singing here. This shit had me mellow during no doubt some of the most hectic moments of my life. The bandwidth of textures is warm, elusive, seductive. The songwriting is abstract yet strangely grounded in a pulse, a resolve. And the vibe continues with very little interruption (check Iguana Queen for a subby, sin-wavy off-colour joke). It’s the elevator music for the three-story mansion of your dreams. It’s internet music par excellence (he’d probably hate if you called it that). Most importantly, it feels really, really good to listen to, over and over again..\\n\\n## 2d\\n\\n### 1. @greenjacket_e @d0ggma @e___90\\n\\nBò (I don’t know her last name) is a 2d artist I met while living in Vietnam during parts of 2020 and 2021. Her multi-disciplinary practice extends across 2d digital works, illustrated and photographic, and into sculpture, music and styling projects. She dresses extremely well, uses an entry-level camera, one prime lens and a broken computer running a cracked version of photoshop to execute some of the most compelling, inimitable 2d work I’ve come across IRL or online. [She’s like Erika Kamano (who I love btw) on two balloons of nitrous, six beers, a pack of smokes and a plate of cơm tấm](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUoCXNlPfbF/). Her work is cyber-punk but sexier, queer, vibrant, unleashed. Her skills and generally awesome personality have made her a hyper-active member of Saigon’s burgeoning arts community, working with everyone from middle-of-the-stream influencers to popular local brands like [Aah Midnight Club](https://www.instagram.com/aahmidnightclub/) and [Mama Virus](https://www.instagram.com/mama.virus/). She’s also a member of the exciting and hyper-paced dance music collective [Nhạc Gãy](https://www.instagram.com/nhac_gay/), for whom she produces visual work and DJs. Her talent is simply immense, a visionary in the making. Someone give her a budget!..\\n\\n### 2. Joshua Advincula\\n\\nWe like painting and drawing again! In a simplistic sense, our obsession with screens produces the opposite and equal urge to interface with non-luminous surfaces, a flatness that shines without glare. One level deeper, I can imagine it just feels great to wield a pencil and paper, brush and canvas, hands and paint. The renewed impetus to express humanity with these tactile tools is colliding with youth culture and traditional gallery narrative, and exploding into a massive spectrum of new analog, 2d practices. Everything from graf and anime, to pattern making, oil painting and collage feels fresh and exciting. Josh is one proponent of this energy and one of Toronto’s all-around good people making the stuff. His illustrations and painted works evoke [a strange sense of nostalgia](https://www.instagram.com/p/CU82eXvtB_i/), somehow transmitting both the pleasures and pains of childhood, growing-up and adulting in the same works, with the same lines and shades. The references embedded therein touch many worlds - the muscularity of graffiti text, the kindness of a children’s television program from the 90s, the doodles you made in AP Chemistry. There is a rendering of these works that would function in the digital space…I just know it..\\n\\n### 3. Ping Chao\\n\\nThere are so many streetwear brands, so little heart. Ping Chao’s brand, Paradise, is a key exception. This exceptional 20-year old is one of the key players in Saigon’s youth culture renaissance. He is a Taiwanese ex-pat embracing his adopted land and closely examining the fabric of the city’s culture, an amorphous blend of indigenous and west-leaning proclivities. The designs may seem simple at first, but a closer look at the feed produces a range of sensibilities, a fearless embrace of community and an expansive, historically conscious practice. [Saigon is the survivors of the Vietnam War](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXbL4YyP3hq/) living [with skaters](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWFc0hajOc3/) next to [flexers](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVSm7T5PCVo/) and [monks](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXAF2qxvc2E/). That proximity, the exchange that it furnishes, is a melding of time, politics and progress. And Paradise is the gift shop for that ethos. With his cohort of photographers, designers and artists, Ping Chao manages the production, manufacturing and distribution of every piece the brand creates. He is a one-man army and he is not old enough to drink in the US of A. He literally pulls up on a moped to hand you a t-shirt and thank you for the support. It’s people like him (and Bò) that make Saigon feel like Paradise..\\n\\n### \",\"timestamp\":1640142419,\"title\":\"Artists I'd love to see with NFTs\"},\"digest\":\"Iqm0HIQ1zCAVMuw6rJacYuVqRRw91S-Nv-z9G_8_CT8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x717FF1fE8ECEF9c6fa607a75EAa6A57aD9ffcC21\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"WB1z-GU-ElXDXl7zlHDy0Z-aALiZIkvrsDzUh1D6CQA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"IfLgSZ_K2Sq7qFQ8THmP234OHiM4gmEj3zZxiekKORs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"8iOITXSfTOkDMKRSTBySbG1xFnO1eLQm58XymwRXdU6u-vUHwlNa1RlHHaYC4wEE3K4a0nLH99YDjIA3QX2Zeg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5b15c991f258ed343d605281cdb1e436f6aa0657613e490d01c2fa9dcdd52272112e5a5d454afee5a08086d1118a91b6d774c0febecb5f85a93cada0ae67e11e1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"WB1z-GU-ElXDXl7zlHDy0Z-aALiZIkvrsDzUh1D6CQA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"IfLgSZ_K2Sq7qFQ8THmP234OHiM4gmEj3zZxiekKORs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Yl1fWmMY64HNFt6XcdSmqSMNSZ4MC9Rv_T1dNh9Uo0U\"}"
