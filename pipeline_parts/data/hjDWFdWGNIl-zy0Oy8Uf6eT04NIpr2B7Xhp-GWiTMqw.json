On the premise of giving priority to funding security, WePiggy actively creates a more diverse lending market, optimizes the execution efficiency of smart contracts, and expands more dimensions of the business logic. Under the WePiggy multi-chain deployment plan, WePiggy is covering Ethereum, OKExChain, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Huobi Eco Chain, Arbitrum and other innovative public and Layer-2 networks.\\n\\n## WePiggy + QuickSwap\\n\\n$QUICK is the native token in QuickSwap’s ecosystem, while users can get $dQUICK by staking their QUICK token, 0.04% trading volume of QuickSwap will be routed to $QUICK stakers.\\n\\nWhat’s more, $dQUICK holders are able to earn more passive income though staking their $dQUICK in Dragon’s Syrup pools.\\n\\nSo, compared with $QUICK, $dQUICK is a more ideal wealth appreciation tool for users, a more ideal asset for the lending market as well.\\n\\nWePiggy has applied for the price feed service from the leading oracle network Chainlink and the price feed address of $QUICK has been officially launched.\\n\\nWePiggy community will evaluate $dQUICK token and propose to list $dQUICK on the lending market of Polygon mainnet.\\n\\nThe QuickSwap team will contribute to the liquidity building of $dQUICK in WePiggy’s lending market, to eliminate systemic risk of WePiggy protocol as much as possible.\\n\\nMore cooperation, including diversified portfolio management, cross-chain asset transfer and lending, will be released to $dQUICK token holders in the future.\\n\\n***“Through this cooperation, we can expand WePiggy’s influence to a larger user base, expand the scale of high-quality assets of the WePiggy lending protocol on the Polygon mainnet. If $dQUICK gets listed on WePiggy, that will expand the use of $dQUICK, reducing the barrier for users to join in the ecosystem of QuickSwap. More users can earn extra profits through borrowing $dQUICK rather than buy it. Meanwhile, that will give $dQUICK holders more choices to use their $dQUICK and maximize their profits. Also, token holders of $dQUICK can enjoy the powerful and secure application of WePiggy. ”***\\n\\n– Ron, Zheng, Founder and CEO of WePiggy\\n\\n***“Listing dQUICK on WePiggy is an easy decision for us. We have seen many messages from users asking about using dQUICK for lending and borrowing, now they will finally have the chance! When users stake dQUICK on WePiggy, they will earn interest from the borrowing fees, WPC token through lend and borrow, and earn QUICK tokens from volume fees! Then, users can also borrow another asset using dQUICK as collateral. Big win for both projects.“***\\n\\n\\\\*– \\\\****Tyler, QuickSwap BD***\\n\\n## About WePiggy\\n\\nWePiggy is an open-source, non-custodial, crypto asset lending market protocol.
