"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Its been a crazy ride since I attended to my first blockchain meeting back in 2018 and a lot of things changed since them. \\n\\nI must confess wasn’t so impressed about **crypto** I mean I know a few things about bitcoin but it seemed so distant to my reality so I heard about smart contracts and all the possibilities I could bring to create an *open financial ecosystem*.\\n\\nMarcos Schultz was the one who lead the talk that night and I got surprised about how humble and accessible he was. We started to talk regularly and he incentivized me to study more about blockchain and he showed a lot of resources and courses that could help me. \\n\\nThat was the very first day I started to feel part of a community of people who really cares about each other.\\n\\nMoments like this remind me why I’m still here trying, learning and building everyday. Ive been part of a lot of groups and never felt so welcoming before. Web3 is a incredible space  where people have this strong sense of community.\\n\\nNo matter how much you know, your background or how old you are, this community will always take care of you and you cant see this on web2.\\n\\nI’m 34 and Ive been using facebook, instagram, twitter and other social platforms for years and most of the time you are treated like a number. You are just another user and they want your precious data cause when they sell it they get profit.\\n\\nIn other words when you use web2 you are the product. I believe most of the people started to realized its not sustainable anymore and the number of users started to decrease or be split to multiple platforms.\\n\\nWeb3 platforms found the perfect balance between profit and community satisfaction. We have **Daos**, we have open conversations using telegram, discord and AMA and we have airdrops to reward OG’s. \\n\\nI can see a bright future for the ones who are getting involved right now specially because a lot of projects are starting to use **Social Tokens** to leverage their communities. The most I read most I get exited about it and that’s why I started to write this blog.\\n\\nEverything we don’t like about web2 we can change here in this space and I know for a fact that sky inst the limit anymore. The huge amount of lives changed with cryptos are surreal. Not only cryptos but **NFT’s** and **Defi** too.\\n\\nThis is the Open Financial Ecosystem and we just started.\",\"timestamp\":1640536961,\"title\":\"Web2 Users vs Web3 Communities\"},\"digest\":\"wB-Ij-_E8HCOARkYMlsoDqEuEguZ5OJiJ5-lO9HQ6vU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2A6f479E2f11ef7A2Ad10137F52f5E768F50A241\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MAbeiTsW_6RWFgY3nKdfgRzAPiDi3fFq7OY6zjFcByo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YotXvbSdnlFaNNvyv6ABhy0SslVr00wCtd9i1eAkrLY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"b2RW2Q4NORRODM2SicxIuYPvPrs96SFCmSIIa4KocwAJ93Fs7_UV6YdNTGmDU_8Skh9GKTTT6PiSXIeGn36gYw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf6f7496c9eaf0bd744d7a67f1832a886cae6842d9a3cbf385feae755277a31cb553c150e3c4dbc32f2fb5febbbcaae7090644dc90bea13b5388910d1c0b9d5041b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MAbeiTsW_6RWFgY3nKdfgRzAPiDi3fFq7OY6zjFcByo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YotXvbSdnlFaNNvyv6ABhy0SslVr00wCtd9i1eAkrLY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wB-Ij-_E8HCOARkYMlsoDqEuEguZ5OJiJ5-lO9HQ6vU\"}"
