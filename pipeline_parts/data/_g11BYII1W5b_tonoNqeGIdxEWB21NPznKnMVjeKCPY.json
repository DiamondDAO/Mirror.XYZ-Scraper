"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"There are seven client implementations of ETH 2.0 currently available: The Ethereum Foundation Trinity, Prysm Labs Prysmatic, Sigma Prime Lighthouse, Status Nimbus, Lodestar ChainSafe, Teku PegaSys and Cortex Nethermind. \\n\\nThe so-called “first specification” approach was adopted by the development team to create the basis on which each client will be able to operate. The amount of work involved was colossal, as the approach foresees first the completion of the entire draft of the protocol, followed by the implementation process itself. This “multi-client paradigm” is causing delays, as human resources seem to be insufficient for ensuring optimal development, [according](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYNqoKh3KWs) to project lead Danny Ryan.\\n\\nThe fact is that having multiple clients is critical to maintaining a high level of network security, and the development team seems to be unwilling to compromise security for optimal launch timing. Even if that means breaking a few promises and [postponing](https://twitter.com/Marcolevarato/status/1260136573766688768) the launch.\\n\\nIn an effort to speed up polishing the system, the bug bounty program [offers](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/phase0-bounty) hunters anywhere from $1,000 to $20,000 for critical errors capable of breaking the chain. The bounty program is running in parallel with the audit of the Phase 0 specification, which is being conducted to make sure the network can pass to the next stage of its development in preparation for launch.\",\"timestamp\":1639035382,\"title\":\"There are seven client implementations of ETH 2\"},\"digest\":\"97yFCwCBdnWgSEZP1LqAxGATXm5tr5LM5ySZxtpIP24\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xcd17565e77B8DF79252E1682B4E2F7ebA87A13eE\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"K0VzJsVlSsZ6Cr9dmt7iKPLddaZ37pNOsbXJfdS1lIY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"be3yiGk9wd7dbAbTA8fY3hHtfrYRr9VMRGc1InrIV1w\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"wLT_c3I8D-rHr19EqP2H7-ERd4tjCEPcMOYPMRtxYVQtTXIJ7-bKg5hmhMClqs6DRUfZxptgEmRDd3Zu-PdfqQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x40baf2e93371e5796ef21145e68a9f6c5c5dfbeeee836baf22043c8afc3cb28b570cea2e6e06acd594c5c199d59f714c2aedaae9688462d460f52ae3639ee1981b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"K0VzJsVlSsZ6Cr9dmt7iKPLddaZ37pNOsbXJfdS1lIY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"be3yiGk9wd7dbAbTA8fY3hHtfrYRr9VMRGc1InrIV1w\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"97yFCwCBdnWgSEZP1LqAxGATXm5tr5LM5ySZxtpIP24\"}"
