"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"and as he has never spoken to me, I do the most prudent thing I can, and take no notice. Should he attempt to intrude himself on me, then it will be time to have him stopped in the hall, and I shall do it *cou'te que cou'te.* Ah, my dear friend, mine is a difficult and trying position.\\\"\\n\\nAfter a very long wait, Ina went down and sung her principal song, with the usual bravas and thunders of applause. She was called on twice, and as she retired, Severne stepped forward, and, with a low, obsequious bow, handed her a beautiful bouquet. She took it with a stately courtesy, but never looked nor smiled.\\n\\nRhoda saw that and wondered. She thought to herself, \\\"That is carrying politeness a long way. To be sure, she is half a foreigner.\\\"\\n\\nHaving done his nightly homage, Severne left the theater, and soon afterward the performance concluded, and Ina took her friend home. Ashmead was in the hall to show his patroness to her carriage--a duty he never failed in. Rhoda shook hands with him, and he said, \\\"Delighted to see you here, miss. You will be a great comfort to her.\\\"\\n\\nThe two friends communed till two o'clock in the morning: but the limits of my tale forbid me to repeat what passed.\\n\\nSuffice it to say that Rhoda was fairly puzzled by the situation; but, having a great regard for Vizard, saw clearly enough that he ought to be sent back to Islip. She thought that perhaps the very sight of her would wound his pride, and, finding his mania discovered by a third person, he would go of his own accord: so she called on him.\\n\\nMy lord received her with friendly composure, and all his talk was about Islip. He did not condescend to explain his presence at Carlisle. He knew that *qui s'excuse s'accuse,* and left her to remonstrate. She had hardly courage for that, and hoped it might be unnecessary.\\n\\nShe told Ina what she had done. But her visit was futile: at night there was Vizard in his box.\\n\\nNext day the company opened in Manchester. Vizard was in his box there--Severne in front, till Ina's principal song. Then he came round and presented his bouquet. But this time he came up to Rhoda Gale, and asked her whether a penitent man might pay his respects to her in the morning.\\n\\nShe said she believed there were very few penitents in the world.\\n\\n\\\"I know one,\\\" said he.\\n\\n\\\"Well, I don't, then,\\\" said the virago. \\\"But *you* can come, if you are not afraid.\\\"\\n\\nOf course Ina Klosking knew of this appointment two minutes after it was made. She merely said, \\\"Do not let him talk you over.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is not so likely to talk me over as you,\\\" said Rhoda.\\n\\n\\\"You are mistaken,\\\" was Ina's reply. \\\"I am the one person he will never deceive again.\\\"\\n\\nRhoda Gale received his visit: he did not beat about the bush, nor fence at all. He declared at once what he came for. He said, \\\"At the first sight of you, whom I have been so ungrateful to, I could not speak; but now I throw myself on your forgiveness. I think you must have seen that my ingratitude has never sat light on me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have seen that you were terribly afraid of me,\\\" said she.\\n\\n\\\"I dare say I was. But I am not afraid of you now; and here, on my knees, I implore you to forgive my baseness, my ingratitude. Oh, Miss Gale, you don't know what it is to be madly in love; one has no principle, no right feeling, against a real passion: and I was madly in love with her. It was through fear of losing her I disowned my physician, my benefactress, who had saved my life. Miserable wretch! It was through fear of losing her that I behaved like a ruffian to my angel wife, and would have committed bigamy, and been a felon. What was all this but madness? You, who are so wise, will you not forgive me a crime that downright insanity was the cause of?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Humph! if I understand right, you wish me to forgive you for looking in my face, and saying to the woman who had saved your life, 'I don't know you?'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes--if you can. No: now you put it in plain words, I see it is not to be forgiven.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are mistaken. It was like a stab to my heart, and I cried bitterly over it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then I deserve to be hanged; that is all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, on consideration, I believe it is as much your nature to be wicked as it is my angel Ina's to be good. So I forgive you that one thing, you charming villain.\\\" She held out her hand to him in proof of her good faith.\\n\\nHe threw himself on his knees directly, and kissed and mumbled her hand, and bedewed it with hysterical tears.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, don't do that,\\\" said she; \\\"or I'm bound to give you a good kick. I hate she men.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Give me a moment,\\\" said he, \\\"and I will be a man again.\\\"\\n\\nHe sat with his face in his hands, gulping a little.\\n\\n\\\"Come,\\\" said she, cocking her head like a keen jackdaw; \\\"now let us have the real object of your visit.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, no,\\\" said he, inadvertently--\\\"another time will do for that. I am content with your forgiveness. Now I can wait.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What for?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Can you ask? Do you consider this a happy state of things?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certainly not. But it can't be helped: and we have to thank you for it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It could be helped in time. If you would persuade her to take the first step.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What step?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not to disown her husband. To let him at least be her friend--her penitent, humble friend. We are man and wife. If I were to say so publicly, she would admit it. In this respect at least I have been generous: will she not be generous too? What harm could it do her if we lived under the same roof, and I took her to the theater, and fetched her home, and did little friendly offices for her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And so got the thin edge of the wedge in, eh? Mr. Severne, I decline all interference in a matter so delicate, and in favor of a person who would use her as ill as ever, if he once succeeded in recovering her affections.\\\"\\n\\nSo then she dismissed him peremptorily.\\n\\nBut, true to Vizard's interest, she called on him again, and, after a few preliminaries, let him know that Severne was every night behind the scenes.\\n\\nA spasm crossed his face. \\\"I am quite aware of that,\\\" said he. \\\"But he is never admitted into her house.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How do you know?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is under constant surveillance.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Spies?\\\"\\n\\n[ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/123](ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/123)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637672505,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"We should have an _esclandre._ I find he has had so much consideration for me as to tel\"},\"digest\":\"BzR453gtipLIk_C7ThLpXjX0jjsDT5PsdYDtnVpi5QI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x025bE40F20d6f0f04d76fE7Ad916e5d61bc4D69f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"IH9isPrty1JlZ0fX74OtBebN92RXEHlcTj_pc5evXys\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DzjcuwiJN_-cac6EE4yckkH5gpQcpiRfy8Y2qN8ryjY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"4HQk81xxJnen95iTDaxHJRT9oouShq34p6A0pLLNsaOJCdJYSicRUh4LgaqUAlKWj1URmHGEcSeF6Sem7oaPSA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x62ba375dab264dc6fc954f91ac483a89b142ac267d9d02e3b7835ec42ec4f31f086febef7c2e46cd0768609da217e62c23b2c07b03facee55b037fb453aa9c701b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"IH9isPrty1JlZ0fX74OtBebN92RXEHlcTj_pc5evXys\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DzjcuwiJN_-cac6EE4yckkH5gpQcpiRfy8Y2qN8ryjY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"BzR453gtipLIk_C7ThLpXjX0jjsDT5PsdYDtnVpi5QI\"}"
