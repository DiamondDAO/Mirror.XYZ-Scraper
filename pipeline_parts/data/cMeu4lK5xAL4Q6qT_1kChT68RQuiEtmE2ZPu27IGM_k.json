"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"Then I think I ought to see her,\\\" continued the Captain. \\\"She can't know at present what is my income.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lady Albury has told us that it is sufficient.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But that means nothing. Your niece cannot be aware that I have a very pretty little place of my own down in Berkshire.\\n\\n\\\"I don't think it would make a difference,\\\" said Mrs Dosett. \\\"Or that I shall be willing to settle upon her a third of my income. It is not many gentlemen who will do as much as that for a young lady, when the young lady has nothing of her own.\\\" \\\"I am sure you are very generous.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I am. I always was generous. And I have no impediments to get rid of; not a trouble of that kind in all the world. And I don't owe a shilling. Very few young men, who have lived as much in the world as I have, can say that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am sure your position is all that is desirable.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's just it. No position could be more desirable. I should give up the service immediately as soon as I was married.\\\" At that Mrs Dosett bowed, not knowing what words to find for further conversation. \\\"After that,\\\" continued the Captain, \\\"do you mean to say that I am not to be allowed to see the young lady?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I cannot force her to come down, Captain Batsby.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I would if I were you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Force a young lady?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Something ought to be done,\\\" said he, beginning almost to whine. \\\"I have come here on purpose to see her, and I am quite prepared to do what is handsome. My half-sister, Lady Albury, had her down at Stalham, and is quite anxious to have her there again. I suppose you have no objection to make to me, Mrs Dosett?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, dear no.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Or Mr Dosett?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do not say that he has, Captain Batsby; but this is a matter in which a young lady's word must be paramount. We cannot force her to marry you, or even to speak to you.\\\" The Captain still went on with entreaties, till Mrs Dosett found herself so far compelled to accede to him as to go up to Ayala's room and beg her to come down and answer this third suitor with her own voice. But Ayala was immovable. When her aunt came near her she took hold of the bed as though fearing an attempt would be made to drag her out of the room. She again declared that if she were forced into the room below nothing could oblige her to speak even a word.\\n\\n\\\"As for thanking him,\\\" she said, \\\"you can do that yourself, Aunt Margaret, if you like. I am not a bit obliged to him; but, if you choose to say so, you may; only pray do tell him to go away -- and tell him never, never to come back any more.\\\" Then Mrs Dosett returned to the drawing-room, and declared that her embassy had been quite in vain.\\n\\n\\\"In all my life,\\\" said Captain Batsby, as he took his leave, \\\"I never heard of such conduct before.\\\"\\n\\nNevertheless, as he went away he made up his mind that Lady Albury should get Ayala again down to Stalham. He was very angry, but his love remained as hot as ever.\\n\\n\\\"As I did not succeed in seeing her,\\\" he said, in a letter to his half-sister, \\\"of course I do not know what she might have said to me herself. I might probably have induced her to give me another hearing. I put it all down to that abominable aunt, who probably has some scheme of her own, and would not let Miss Dormer come down to me. If you will have her again at Stalham, everything may be made to go right.\\\"\\n\\nAt home, in Kingsbury Crescent, when Ayala had gone to bed, both Mr and Mrs Dosett expressed themselves as much troubled by the peculiarity of Ayala's nature. Mrs Dosett declared her conviction that that promised legacy from Uncle Tom would never be forthcoming, because he had been so much offended by the rejection of his own son. And even should the legacy remain written in Sir Thomas's will, where would Ayala find a home if Mr Dosett were to die before the baronet? This rejection of suitors -- of fit, well-to-do, unobjectionable suitors -- was held by Mrs Dosett to be very wicked, and a direct flying in the face of Providence. \\\"Does she think\\\", said Mrs Dosett, urging the matter with all her eloquence to her husband, \\\"that young men with incomes are to be coming after her always like this?\\\" Mr Dosett shook his head and scratched it at the same time, which was always a sign with him that he was not at all convinced by the arguments used, but that he did not wish to incur further hostility by answering them. \\\"Why shouldn't she see an eligible man when he comes recommended like this?\\\" \\\"I suppose, my dear, she didn't think him nice enough.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nice! pshaw! I call it a direct flying in the face of Providence. If he were ever so nasty and twice as old she ought to think twice about it in her position. There is poor Tom, they say, absolutely ill. The housekeeper was over here from Queen's Gate the other day, and she declares that that affair about the policeman all came from his being in love. And now he has left the business and has gone to Merle Park, because he is so knocked in a heap that he cannot hold up his head.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't see why love should make a man punch a policeman's breath out of him,\\\" said Mr Dosett.\\n\\n\\\"Of course Tom was foolish; but he would do very well if she would have him. Of course your sister, and Sir Thomas, and all of them, will be very furious. What right will she have to expect money after that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tom is an ass,\\\" said Mr Dosett.\\n\\n\\\"I suppose Colonel Stubbs is an ass too. What I want to know is what it is she looks for. Like any other girl, she expects to get married some day, I suppose; but she has been reading poetry, and novels, and trash, till she has got her head so full of nonsense that she doesn't know what it is she does want. I should like to shake her till I shook all the romance out of her. If there is anything I do hate it is romance, while bread and meat, and coals, and washing, are so dear.\\\" With this Mrs Dosett took herself and her troubles up to her bedroom.\\n\\nMr Dosett sat for a while gazing with speculative eyes at the embers of the fire. He was conscious in his heart that some part of that attack upon romance in general was intended for himself. Though he did not look to be romantic, especially when seated at his desk in Somerset House, with his big index-book before him, still there was left about him some touch of poetry, and an appreciation of the finer feelings of our nature. Though he could have wished that Ayala should have been able to take one of these three well-to-do suitors, who were so anxious to obtain her hand, still he could not bring himself not to respect her, still he was unable not to love her, because she was steadfastly averse to accept as a husband a man for whom she had no affection. As he looked at the embers he asked himself how it ought to be. Here was a girl whose only gift in life was her own personal charm. That that charm must be powerful was evident from the fact that she could attract such men as these. Of the good things of the world, of a pleasant home, of ample means, and of all that absence of care which comes from money, poor Mr Dosett had by no means a poor appreciation. That men are justified in seeking these good things by their energy, industry, and talents, he was quite confident. How was it with a girl who had nothing else but her beauty -- or, perhaps, her wit -- in lieu of energy and industry? Was she justified in carrying her wares also into the market, and making the most of them? The embers had burned so low, and he had become so cold before he had settled the question in his own mind, that he was obliged to go up to bed, leaving it unsettled.\\n\\nCHAPTER 40 AUNT EMMELINE'S NEW PROPOSITION\\n\\nA few days after this, just as the bread and cheese had been put on the table for the modest mid-day meal at Kingsbury Crescent, there came a most unwonted honour on Mrs Dosett. It was a call from no less a person than Lady Tringle herself, who had come all the way up from Merle Park on purpose. It was a Saturday. She had travelled by herself and intended to go back on the same day with her husband. This was an amount of trouble which she very seldom gave herself, not often making a journey to London during the periods of her rural sojourn; and, when she began by assuring her sister-in-law that she made the journey with no object but that of coming to Kingsbury Crescent, Mrs Dosett was aware that something very important was to be communicated. Mrs Dosett and Ayala were together in the dining-room when Lady Tringle appeared, and the embracings were very affectionate. They were particularly affectionate towards Ayala, who was kissed as though nothing had ever happened to interfere with the perfect love existing between the aunt and the niece. They were more than friendly, almost sisterly towards Mrs Dosett, whom in truth Lady Tringle met hardly more than once in a year. It was very manifest that Aunt Emmeline wanted to have something done. \\\"Now, my darling,\\\" she said, turning to Ayala, \\\"if you would not mind going away for ten minutes, I could say a few words on very particular business to your aunt.\\\" Then she gave her niece a tender little squeeze and assumed her sweetest smile.\\n\\nIt will be as well to go back a little and tell the cause which had produced this unexpected visit. There had been very much of real trouble at Merle Park. Everything was troublesome. Gertrude had received her final letter from her lover, had declared herself to be broken-hearted, and was evincing her sorrow by lying in bed half the day, abstaining from her meals, and relieving herself from famine by sly visits to the larder. It was supposed that her object was to bend the stony heart of her father, but the process added an additional trouble to her mother. Then the Trafficks were a sore vexation. It was now nearly the end of January and they were still at Merle Park. There had been a scene in which Sir Thomas had been very harsh. \\\"My dear,\\\" he had said to his wife, \\\"I find that something must be done to the chimney of the north room. The workmen must be in it by the first of February. See and have all the furniture taken out before they come.\\\" Now the north room was the chamber in which the Trafficks slept, and the Trafficks were present when the order was given. No one believed the story of the chimney. This was the mode of expulsion which Sir Thomas had chosen on the spur of the moment. Mr Traffick said not a word, but in the course of the morning Augusta expostulated with her mother. This was also disagreeable. Then the condition of Tom was truly pitiable. All his trust in champagne, all his bellicose humour, had deserted him. He moped about the place the most miserable of human beings, spending hour after hour in imploring his mother's assistance. But Lucy with her quiet determination, and mute persistency in waiting, was a source of almost greater annoyance to her aunt than even her own children. That Lucy should in any degree have had her way with Mr Hamel, had gone against the grain with her. Mr Hamel, to her thinking, was a person to be connected with whom would be a disgrace. She was always speaking of his birth, of his father's life, and of those Roman iniquities. She had given way for a time when she had understood that her husband intended to give the young people money enough to enable them to marry. In that case Lucy would at once be taken away from the house. But now all that had come to an end. Sir Thomas had given no money, and had even refused to give any money. Nevertheless he was peacefully indulgent to Lucy, and was always scolding his wife because she was hostile to Lucy's lover.\\n\\nIn this emergency she induced him to accede to a proposition, by which one of her miseries would be brought to an end and another might perhaps be remedied. A second exchange should be made. Lucy should be sent back to Kingsbury Crescent, and Ayala should once more be brought into favour at Merle Park, Queen's Gate, and Glenbogie. \\\"Your brother will never put up with it,\\\" said Sir Thomas. Lady Tringle was not afraid of her brother, and thought that by soft words she might even talk over her sister-in-law. Ayala, she knew, had been troublesome in Kingsbury Crescent. She was sure, she said, Ayala's whims would of their nature be more troublesome to such a woman as Mrs Dosett than Lucy's obstinacy. Ayala had no doubt been pert and disobedient at Glenbogie and at Rome, but there had been an unbending obduracy about Lucy which had been more distasteful to Aunt Emmeline than even Ayala's pert disobedience. \\\"It will be the only way\\\", she had said to Sir Thomas, \\\"to put Tom on his legs again. If the girl comes back here she will be sure to have him at last.\\\" There was much in this which to Sir Thomas was weak and absurd. That prolonged journey round by San Francisco, Japan, and Pekin, was the remedy which recommended itself to him. But he was less able to despatch Tom at once to Japan than the elder Faddle had been to send off the younger Faddle to the stern realities of life in Aberdeen. He was quite willing that Tom should marry Ayala if it could be arranged, and therefore he gave his consent.\\n\\nSo armed, Lady Tringle had come up to Kingsbury Crescent, and was now about to undertake a task, which she acknowledged to herself to be difficult. She, in the first place, had had her choice and had selected a niece. Then she had quarrelled with her own selection, and had changed nieces. This had been done to accommodate her own fancy; and now she wanted to change the nieces back again! She felt aware that her request was unreasonable, and came, therefore, determined to wrap it up in her blandest smiles.\\n\\nWhen Ayala had left the room Mrs Dosett sat mute in attention. She was quite aware that something very much out of the ordinary way was to be asked of her. In her ordinary way Lady Tringle never did smile when she came to Kingsbury Crescent. She would be profuse in finery, and would seem to throw off sparks of wealth at every word she spoke. Now even her dress had been toned down to her humbler manner, and there was no touch of her husband's purse in her gait. \\\"Margaret,\\\" she said, \\\"I have a proposition of great importance to make to you.\\\" Mrs Dosett opened her eyes wider and sat still mute. \\\"That poor girl is not -- is not -- is not doing perhaps the very best for herself here at Kingsbury Crescent.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why is she not doing the best for herself?\\\" asked Mrs Dosett, angrily.\\n\\n\\\"Do not for a moment suppose that I am finding fault either with you or my brother.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You'd be very wrong if you did.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No doubt -- but I am not finding fault. I know how very generous you have both been. Of course Sir Thomas is a rich man, and what he gives to one of the girls comes to nothing. Of course it is different with you. It is hard upon my brother to have any such burden put upon him; and it is very good both in him and you to bear it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What is it you want us to do now, Emmeline?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well -- I was going to explain. I do think it a great pity that Tom and Ayala should not become man and wife. If ever any young man ever did love a girl I believe that he loves her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think he does.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is dreadful. I never saw anything like it. He is just for all the world like those young men we read of who do all manner of horrible things for love -- smothering themselves and their young women with charcoal, or throwing them into the Regent's Canal. I am constantly afraid of something happening. It was all because of Ayala that he got into that terrible row at the police court -- and then we were afraid he was going to take to drink. He has given all that up now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am very glad he has given drink up. That wouldn't do him any good.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is quite different now. The poor fellow hardly takes anything. He will sit all the afternoon smoking cigarettes and sipping tea. It is quite sad to see him. Then he comes and talks to me, and is always asking me to make Ayala have him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't think that anybody can ever make Ayala do anything.\\\" \\\"Not quite by talking to her. I dare say not. I did not mean to say a word to her about it just now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We can do nothing, I fear,\\\" said Mrs Dosett.\\n\\n\\\"I was going to suggest something. But I wanted first to say a word or two about poor Lucy.\\\" They were just at present all \\\"poor\\\" to Lady Tringle -- Ayala, Lucy, Tom, and Gertrude. Even Augusta was poor because she was to be turned out of her bedroom. \\\"Is she in trouble?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, dear, yes. But,\\\" she added, thinking well to correct herself, so that Mrs Dosett might not imagine that she would have to look forward to troubles with Lucy, \\\"she could arrange her affairs, no doubt, if she were not with us. She is engaged to that Mr Isadore Hamel, the sculptor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So I have heard.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He does not earn very much just at present, I fear. Sir Thomas did offer to help him, but he was perhaps a little hoity-toity, giving himself airs. That, however, did not come off, and there they are, waiting. I don't mean to say a word against poor Lucy. I think it a pity, you know; but perhaps it was natural enough. He isn't what I should have liked for a niece who was living with me just as though she was my daughter; but I couldn't help that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But what are we to do, Emmeline?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let them just change places again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Change again! Ayala go to you and Lucy come back here!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Just that. If Ayala were with us she would be sure to get used to Tom at last. And then Lucy could manage her affairs with Mr Hamel so much better if she were with you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why should she manage her affairs better if she were with us?\\\" Lady Tringle was aware that this was the weak part of her case. On the poor Ayala and poor Tom side of the question there was a good deal which might be said. Then, though she might not convince, she might be eloquent. But, touching Lucy, she could say nothing which did not simply signify that she wanted to get rid of the girl. Now, Mrs Dosett had also wanted to get rid of Lucy when the former exchange had been made. \\\"What I mean is, that, if she were away, Sir Thomas would be more likely to do something for her.\\\" This was an invention at the spur of the moment.\\n\\n\\\"Do you not feel that the girls should not be chucked about like balls from a battledore?\\\" asked Mrs Dosett.\\n\\n\\\"For their own good, Margaret. I only propose it for their own good. You can't but think it would be a good thing for Ayala to be married to our Tom.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If she liked him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why shouldn't she like him? You know what that means. Poor Ayala is young, and a little romantic. She would be a great deal happier if all that could be knocked out of her. She has to marry somebody, and the sooner she settles down the better. Sir Thomas will do anything for them -- a horse and carriage, and anything she could set her heart upon! There is nothing Sir Thomas would not do for Tom so as to get him put upon his legs again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't think Ayala would go.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She must, you know,\\\" whispered Lady Tringle, \\\"if we both tell her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And Lucy?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She must too,\\\" again whispered Lady Tringle. \\\"It they are told they are to go, what else can they do? Why shouldn't Ayala wish to come?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There were quarrels before.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes -- because of Augusta. Augusta is married now.\\\" Lady Tringle could not quite say that Augusta was gone.\\n\\n\\\"Will you speak to Ayala?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps it would come better from you, Margaret, if you agree with me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am not sure that I do. I am quite sure that your brother would not force her to go, whether she wished it or not. No doubt we should be glad if the marriage could be arranged. But we cannot force a girl to marry, and her aversion in this case is so strong -- \\\"\\n\\n\\\"Aversion!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Aversion to being married, I mean. It is so strong that I do not think she will go of her own accord to any house where she is likely to meet her cousin. I dare say she may be a fool. I say nothing about that. Of course, she shall be asked; and, if she wishes to go, then Lucy can be asked too. But of course it must all depend upon what your brother says.\\\"\\n\\nThen Lady Tringle took her leave without again seeing Ayala herself, and as she went declared her intention of calling at Somerset House. She would not think it right, she said, in a matter of such importance, to leave London without consulting her brother. It might be possible, she thought, that she would be able to talk her brother over; whereas his wife, if she had the first word, might turn him the other way.\\n\\n\\\"Is Aunt Emmeline gone?\\\" asked Ayala, when she came down. \\\"I am glad she has gone, because I never know how to look when she calls me dear. I know she hates me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hope not, Ayala.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am sure she does, because I hated Augusta. I do hate Augusta, and my aunt hates me. The only one of the lot I like is Uncle Tom.\\\"\\n\\nThen the proposition was made, Ayala sitting with her mouth wide open as the details, one after another, were opened out to her. Her aunt did it with exquisite fairness, abstaining from opening out some of the details which might be clear enough to Ayala without any explanation. Her Aunt Emmeline was very anxious to have her back again -- the only reason for her former expulsion having been the enmity of Augusta. Her Uncle Tom and her aunt, and, no doubt, Gertrude, would be very glad to receive her. Not a word was said about Tom. Then something was urged as to the material comforts of the Tringle establishments, and of the necessary poverty of Kingsbury Crescent.\\n\\n\\\"And Lucy is to have the poverty?\\\" said Ayala, indignantly.\\n\\n\\\"I think it probable, my dear, that before long Lucy will become the wife of Mr Hamel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you want to get rid of me?\\\" demanded Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"No, my dear; not so. You must not think that for a moment. The proposition has not originated with me at all. I am endeavouring to do my duty by explaining to you the advantages which you would enjoy by going to your Aunt Emmeline, and which you certainly cannot have if you remain here. And I must tell you, that, if you return to Sir Thomas, he will probably provide for you. You know what I mean by providing for you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, I don't,\\\" said Ayala, who had in her mind some dim idea that her cousin Tom was supposed to be a provision. She was quite aware that her Aunt Margaret, in her explanation as hitherto given, had not mentioned Tom's name, and was sure that it had not been omitted without reason.\\n\\n\\\"By providing, I mean that if you are living in his house he will leave you something in his will -- as would be natural that he should do for a child belonging to him. Your Uncle Reginald' -- this she said in a low and very serious tone -- \\\"will, I fear, have nothing to leave to you.\\\" Then there was silence for some minutes, after which Mrs Dosett asked the important question, \\\"Well, Ayala, what do you think about it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Must I go?\\\" said Ayala. \\\"May I stay?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, my dear; you may certainly stay if you wish it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then I will stay,\\\" said Ayala, jumping up on to her feet. \\\"You do not want to turn me out, Aunt Margaret?\\\" Then she went down on her knees, and, leaning on her aunt's lap, looked up into her face. \\\"If you will keep me I will try to be good.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My dear, you are good. I have nothing to complain of. Of course we will keep you. Nobody has thought for a moment of bidding you go. But you should understand that when your aunt made the proposition I was bound to tell it you.\\\" Then there was great embracing and kissing, and Ayala felt that she was relieved from a terrible danger. She had often declared that no one could make her marry her cousin Tom; but it had seemed to her for a moment that if she were given up bodily to the Tringles no mode of escape would be open to her short of suicide. There had been a moment almost of regret that she had never brought herself to regard Jonathan Stubbs as an Angel of Light.\\n\\nAt Somerset House Lady Tringle made her suggestion to her brother with even more flowery assurance of general happiness than she had used in endeavouring to persuade his wife. Ayala would, of course, be married to Tom in the course of the next six months, and during the same period Lucy, no doubt, would be married to that very enterprising but somewhat obstinate young man, Mr Hamel. Thus there would be an end to all the Dormer troubles; \\\"and you, Reginald,\\\" she said, \\\"will be relieved from a burden which never ought to have been laid upon your shoulder.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We will think of it,\\\" he said very gravely, over and over again. Beyond that \\\"we will think of it\\\" he could not be induced to utter a word.\\n\\nCHAPTER 41 \\\"A COLD PROSPECT!\\\"\\n\\nThree days were allowed to Frank Houston to consider within his own mind what he would say for himself and what he would propose finally to do when he should see Miss Docimer on the appointed Sunday. He was called upon to decide whether, after so many resolutions made to the contrary, he would now at last bring himself to encounter poverty and a family -- genteel poverty with about seven hundred and fifty pounds a year between himself and his wife. He had hitherto been very staunch on the subject, and had unfortunately thought that Imogene Docimer had been as firmly fixed in her determination. His theory had in itself been good. If two people marry they are likely, according to the laws of nature, to have very soon more than two. In the process of a dozen years they may not improbably become ever so many more than two. Funds which were barely enough, if enough, for two, would certainly fail to be enough for half a dozen. His means were certainly not enough for himself, as he had hitherto found them. Imogene's means were less even than his own. Therefore, it was clear that he and Imogene ought not to marry and encounter the danger of all those embryo mouths. There was a logic about it which had seemed to him to be unanswerable. It was a logic which applied to his case above all others. The man who had a hope of earning money need not be absolutely bound by it. To him the money might come as quickly as the mouths. With the cradles would arrive the means of buying the cradles. And to the man who had much more than enough for himself -- to such a man as he had expected to be while he was looking forward to the coffin of that iniquitous uncle -- the logic did not apply at all. In defending himself, both to himself and to Imogene, he was very strong upon that point. A man who had plenty and would not divide his plenty with another might with truth be called selfish. Rich old bachelors might with propriety be called curmudgeons. But was it right that a man should be abused -- even by a young lady to whom, under more propitious circumstances, he had offered his heart -- when he declared himself unwilling to multiply suffering by assisting to bring into the world human beings whom he would be unable to support? He had felt himself to be very strong in his logic, and had unfortunately made the mistake of supposing that it was as clear to Imogene as to himself.\\n\\nThen he had determined to rectify the inconvenience of his position. It had become manifest to him whilst he was waiting for his uncle's money that not only were his own means insufficient for married life but even for single comfort. It would always come to pass that when he had resolved on two mutton chops and half a pint of sherry the humble little meal would spread itself into woodcock and champagne. He regarded it as an unkindness in Providence that he should not have been gifted with economy. Therefore, he had to look about him for a remedy; and, as Imogene was out of the question, he found a remedy in Gertrude Tringle. He had then believed that everything was settled for him -- not, indeed, in a manner very pleasant, but after a fashion that would make life possible to him. Sir Thomas had given one of his daughters, with a large sum of money, to such a man as Septimus Traffick -- a man more impecunious than himself, one whom Frank did not hesitate to pronounce to be much less of a gentleman. That seat in the House of Commons was to him nothing. There were many men in the House of Commons to whom he would hardly condescend to speak. To be the younger son of a latter-day peer was to him nothing. He considered himself in all respects to be a more eligible husband than Septimus Traffick. Therefore he had entertained but little doubt when he found himself accepted by Gertrude herself and her mother. Then by degrees he had learned to know something of the young lady to whom he intended to devote himself; and it had come to pass that the better he had known the less he had liked her. Nevertheless he had persevered, groaning in spirit as he thought of the burden with which he was about to inflict himself. Then had come the release. Sir Thomas had explained to him that no money would be forthcoming; and the young lady had made to him a foolish proposition, which, as he thought, fully justified him in regarding the match as at an end.\\n\\nAnd then he had three days in which to make up his mind. It may be a question whether three days are ever much better than three minutes for such a purpose. A man's mind will very generally refuse to make itself up until it be driven and compelled by emergency. The three days are passed not in forming but in postponing judgment. In nothing is procrastination so tempting as in thought. So it came to pass, that through the Thursday, the Friday, and the Saturday, Frank Houston came to no conclusion, though he believed that every hour of the time was devoted to forming one. Then, as he ate his dinner on Saturday night at his club, a letter was brought to him, the handwriting of which was familiar to him. This letter assisted him little in thinking.\",\"timestamp\":1639991463,\"title\":\"Miss Dormer is at present in her own chamber.\\\" \"},\"digest\":\"N67H8EkZwIYbKbhXjlmdiVupP5natSj3GvuIete7Duc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x90172af57cfCfbdA1dac8055668d7B5df7f90f1E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"O_x5roVKSQoFwGZ13crfzEXpICRqZqrTqXHpNGFZfW0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"iMZ72YuBplP16h98QxbCRv6aAvmmQyMGzhlkxp_DRps\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"NVVxm6LjFb3B4VbSurpD3wFyU9gxzfz9oVbLfBy85bxX4H8D1tVUgzh9Pbfb4rHXfuIS-ZNvfreQA0gLVUZtnw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x105dcae251e6530ebdd20da9497aa466328769b124c60d94ccf1c52a67f432266ee6c54f0076039003badf0b0239b734432acf22fbc05d5a2f0a3312dbd2d1411c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"O_x5roVKSQoFwGZ13crfzEXpICRqZqrTqXHpNGFZfW0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"iMZ72YuBplP16h98QxbCRv6aAvmmQyMGzhlkxp_DRps\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"N67H8EkZwIYbKbhXjlmdiVupP5natSj3GvuIete7Duc\"}"
