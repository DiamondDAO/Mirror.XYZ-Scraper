Our community is full of thousands of smart, talented individuals looking to get hands-on experience working for a DAO.\\n\\nA common frustration we hear from many is how hard it is to “break into” existing DAOs. There are hundreds of people who want to participate, but have yet to find their way into an operational role.\\n\\nSo we asked ourselves …\\n\\nWhat if we used Mirror’s full set of creator empowering tools to launch a DAO that supports creative projects on Mirror, and gives individuals hands-on experience in building and operating a DAO?\\n\\nWell, today we’re excited to announce Mirror Club: a Grant Giving DAO designed to support creators and make it easy for individuals to gain valuable DAO experience.\\n\\n### Mirror Club starts now with the $mCLUB crowdfund.\\n\\nHere’s the game plan.\\n\\n- Backers can support the crowdfund with ETH in return for $mCLUB tokens.\\n- $mCLUB tokens represent membership in Mirror Club.\\n- The first feature of Mirror Club will be a tokenized Discord, gated by $mCLUB. Backers will immediately be able to access the Mirror Club section of the Seed Club Discord.\\n- $mCLUB holders, with the support of Seed Club, will coordinate in the Discord to decide on a plan for governance and how to allocate the contributed funds.\\n- 50% of $mCLUB supply will be held back to airdrop toon quality community members who'd like to participate but may not be able to back the project with ETH.\\n- The crowdfund will target a fundraise of 25 ETH, which will be deposited into a multisig governed by the backers at mirror.club.eth\\n\\nSo what will the Mirror Club DAO do?\\n\\nThat’s really up to you.\\n\\nPerhaps the DAO becomes known for being the first backer of the most inspiring creative projects launching on Mirror. It might help recruit new creators into the Mirror ecosystem (and help them win a future $WRITE RACE), or help steward the development of new features, templates and modules. The DAO could even launch its own MediaDAO, funding its operations using NFTs and splits.\\n\\nThe future is up to $mCLUB holders.\\n\\n[Mirror Club](crowdfund://0xEF42258fB2B3f2ac0Ccf545240b7332B4ba4bB25?version=tiered_1&network=rinkeby&features=overview)\\n\\n[Mirror Club](crowdfund://0xEF42258fB2B3f2ac0Ccf545240b7332B4ba4bB25?version=tiered_1&network=rinkeby&features=backers)\\n\\n[Mirror Club](crowdfund://0xEF42258fB2B3f2ac0Ccf545240b7332B4ba4bB25?version=tiered_1&network=rinkeby&features=editions)\\n\\n[Hepburn](edition://0x92F424663F2E52DeDa4471D4560157eFEC7fAAd0?editionId=28&version=crowdfund_1)\\n\\n[Nietzsche](edition://0x92F424663F2E52DeDa4471D4560157eFEC7fAAd0?editionId=29&version=crowdfund_1)\\n\\n[Zen](edition://0x92F424663F2E52DeDa4471D4560157eFEC7fAAd0?editionId=30&version=crowdfund_1)\\n\",\"timestamp\":1626485455,\"title\":\"Introducing Mirror Club\",\"publication\":\"patrickv1\"},\"digest\":\"uM1CTr8jaT01FO-emgRECgci_p43S05H_b1kHpRS9pM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x942cBEa64876Ff0b2e23c0712B37Dc0091804e9c\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"itjqTeiX3O1pTtpjNCKfOcfDMizQasJIjuvUVIntm-Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"cj1WwnOTHGszqe3aRA863olZfsyqodFZXrcaT2ofHIQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"a6NYJM_573FVDVJIdrMjJ43fPmDfQdlQomNNsz-RqJzhUDJ3gXlbzaBbncK9E3AKPNzu8I8eLQv7WzrM2ugCcw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x7cbc87cdc8efd6b4955f0dee5121573b647a08d13a6375ecfb553c1501abfdb8555dad37e5cd259e291084492a6af8eedebd36af88768bbb6714c5c28ff8ea821b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on patrickv1.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"itjqTeiX3O1pTtpjNCKfOcfDMizQasJIjuvUVIntm-Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"cj1WwnOTHGszqe3aRA863olZfsyqodFZXrcaT2ofHIQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"p0q6UuQYQHHvlBbcjqzpD0MC_t3R1DhO3cRZgWfbdDE\"}"
