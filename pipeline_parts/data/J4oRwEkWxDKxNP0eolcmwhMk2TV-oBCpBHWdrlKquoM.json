"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"[Recent airdrop of $LYRA](https://twitter.com/lyrafinance/status/1466222054915522566) was conducted in a novel way that utilizes off-chain reputation to ensure ideal distribution and prevent from Sybil attack.\\n\\nFor a governance token, the primary goal of an airdrop is to **allocate to potential governors**, other than rewarding early adopters. Past airdrops either neglected this task or was subject to a small group. The reason might be the difficulty to filter out potential governors from the community.\\n\\n[Lyra finance](https://twitter.com/lyrafinance) just paved the way in their discord community and here is how: first, calculate the **weighted character count** for each member, where weights are varied between different channels. The team decided that the weights should reflect the quality of discussion, for example “mechanism” channel gets 3 times the weight of “memes”. The weighted character count is then boosted by **multipliers**, defined by the discord roles. The **roles** also serve as a measure of contribution, for example the MVP role gets a x1.3 boost, who were chosen per community call by the Lyra Council based on contribution. A **low threshold** is chosen to prevent from Sybil attack and also maximize the number of users for decentralization purpose. A **Box-Cox transformation** is applied to further reduce the variance. This mechanism finally picked 1712 out of 10k+ discord members.\\n\\nThis is by far the most sophisticated airdrop architecture. I believe that other projects are likely to follow, and I want to **suggest some DAO tools to achieve the scale**.\\n\\nLinking the discord account to Ethereum address is coming soon, and I think allocate more tokens to discord members who have their Ethereum addresses verified by [@BrightIDProject](https://twitter.com/BrightIDProject) deals with bots that spam messages.\\n\\n[@sourcecred](https://twitter.com/sourcecred) can create an auto and visible reputation system for discord community that measures contribution. Such system could save some tailor-made effort of the Lyra team and also, with open rules, potentially encourage more contribution.\\n\\n[@arcxmoney](https://twitter.com/arcxmoney), who issues \\\"Defi passport\\\" based on on-chain behavior, plans to add “Airdrop Score” that evaluates whether an address holds airdrops or dumps immediately. I think utilization of on-chain identity is another important part of airdrop mechanism in the future.\",\"timestamp\":1640833577,\"title\":\"Better airdrop with off-chain reputation\"},\"digest\":\"FMrUDtmtBmqoEwiMeL_B5xAsR_jh4cPE2cAKDG0bifc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x68d78B8A5910Df57e1a8961bDeA4d4a99A42D141\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"27SXT5OK7bIKM0AO9p01GPhUE-oRT2YQhtJqWO6YTd4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"vL1D6yYF59ocgAVWYlHXwablWmQOYmwyAtPB8JK9TAw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"iyR3d6PDJRD8nxg0YFo8w1JpST3FncsBwSiVJ6beAn7uVpCMmTy3tKyKzpyhQpLLOr8fEyjlpaonkJ1jpI-MJQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x68979e4c3cd6d76d0663f85f0840c10c5a3ceb34d7d849d70bfb45bb091f30447e9333dec6d8e3253318481a58b051393c0e11f5902b0659a6920b7e05f7fcfa1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"27SXT5OK7bIKM0AO9p01GPhUE-oRT2YQhtJqWO6YTd4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"vL1D6yYF59ocgAVWYlHXwablWmQOYmwyAtPB8JK9TAw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"yHrvAXKx-gpTbqu-ffzhqNCQr0vq8XVD5_pluObj1co\"}"
