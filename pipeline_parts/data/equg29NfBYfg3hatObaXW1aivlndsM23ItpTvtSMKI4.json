Is there any art there or we like, what we value in them is only money?”.\\n\\nWatch the full interview on our YouTube channel and don’t forget to subscribe!\",\"timestamp\":1639208092,\"title\":\"Why the world’s largest museum is embracing NFT technology\"},\"digest\":\"DN73jYIniKKLoOKGWoB9nXX4pmTIrwYCQZtaonuEoFA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x505A84687FEdD24447Abc123C0af5f606275435c\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"D7H23oRbSM5TTxsYfg5J_txQtg8jMn7L7rS1816pHYU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gcfnJg6sq1pz3aF1hyGSaLn7N0OvT24bteM87mfpsVg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Jp9m2zmKeVxX9AYkqlie4VoIgq5rRTGzylIANwDeXIrBFLJ06A5J4FQG32SM9LTbMIuonlfSuMOrI4zEOM6Xlw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x28f69cf2dd10933d7ff8009b13d504cd121b70c3cde160ea58b2e8bb518033cb36776ce1f23e086d6f47327560d3076c69c748b4b0af3fd4507989d4e39ccd211c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"D7H23oRbSM5TTxsYfg5J_txQtg8jMn7L7rS1816pHYU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gcfnJg6sq1pz3aF1hyGSaLn7N0OvT24bteM87mfpsVg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Z3Pa5E3px9g5tHPKd1kdMwxabfh6rZT80BZB5RIPwPs\"}"
