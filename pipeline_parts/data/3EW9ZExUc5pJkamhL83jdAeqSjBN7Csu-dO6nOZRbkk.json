"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"You've probably heard of the term \\\"cognitive bias\\\" before, but what does it actually mean? It's what allows us to make snap judgments and decisions without having to think too hard about it. However, while cognitive biases can often lead us astray, they can also be used to our advantage, especially in the virtual world of the Metaverse. In this blog post, we'll take a look at some of the most common cognitive biases and how you can use them to your advantage when trading in the Metaverse. So without further ado, let's get started!\\n\\nHowever, while cognitive biases can sometimes lead us down the wrong path, they also have their place in the virtual world of the Metaverse! In this blog post we'll take a look at some of the most common cognitive biases and how you can use them to your advantage when trading in the Metaverse. So without further ado, let's get started!\\n\\nOne cognitive bias that can be particularly useful in the Metaverse is the sunk cost fallacy. This cognitive bias occurs when we continue investing time or money into something because we've already invested so much into it, even though it might not be rational to do so. For example, imagine you've been trading in the Metaverse for a while and you've made a lot of money. However, you begin to lose money on your latest trades. You might be more likely to continue trading in the hopes of breaking even, because you don't want to \\\"lose\\\" all the money you've already invested. This is the sunk cost fallacy in action!\\n\\nAnother cognitive bias that can be helpful in the Metaverse is the gambler's fallacy. This occurs when we believe that a random event is more likely to happen because it hasn't happened recently. For example, imagine you're playing blackjack in the Metaverse and you've been dealt an ace. You might think that this means you're more likely to get blackjack on the next card, because you haven't had blackjack in a while. This is the gambler's fallacy in action!\\n\\nA cognitive bias that can be helpful in the Metaverse is survivorship bias. This cognitive bias occurs when we focus on examples of success or people who have succeeded, while ignoring failures or those who haven't done so well. For example, imagine you're looking up your favorite avatar's history and they've always had a high balance. You might think of them as a good trader, even though they might have lost money on the majority of their trades. This is an example of survivorship bias!\\n\\nAnother cognitive bias that can be helpful in the Metaverse is bandwagon effect. This cognitive bias occurs when we believe something because other people seem to believe it too. For example, imagine you're in a chat room for traders and everyone is talking about how great a certain coin is. You might be more likely to invest in that coin, because it seems like everyone else believes in it. This is an example of the bandwagon effect!\\n\\nWhile cognitive biases can often lead us astray, they can also be used to our advantage. By understanding the cognitive biases that affect us, we can make better decisions when trading in the Metaverse! So don't be afraid to use them â€“ after all, knowledge is power!\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1640660532,\"title\":\"How will companies and individuals use cognitive bias to their advantage in the metaverse?\"},\"digest\":\"_cMuQ6hDvblcTEtRxRPErRvl5rAqyBlK0oZ3irJtEi0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x894f841AAabFABF9861DA55312F3E898ABE0F4A3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"QHpsIY5gb_i_GPUpjSspjgf8Ch2AXhkwJHQHirqu8uw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"w0yfH4v730WKXuA961eDG-hwMYA83EEGGgPzK7W5Hak\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"OmdD5HdQIH6V35z1EWxr-wMvFMsPyIDTGGcl0uPc8X6hHE35U6_xY5tyEIr1vZ-f66gVZgyuEUbgK_HFEYGwfg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x37a0750f5bf1773959255ea6b0a94be12d67cf55982ddc56ec7e89e806d9bfb870934bacbd170f87253d9b1f55cb76c01ecf91cf1e954c6d778ee5b45d0ffa631c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"QHpsIY5gb_i_GPUpjSspjgf8Ch2AXhkwJHQHirqu8uw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"w0yfH4v730WKXuA961eDG-hwMYA83EEGGgPzK7W5Hak\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"_cMuQ6hDvblcTEtRxRPErRvl5rAqyBlK0oZ3irJtEi0\"}"
