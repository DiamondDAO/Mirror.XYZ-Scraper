"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Public chain competition has become fierce. There are both the exchange public chain BSC compatible with the Ethereum EVM, as well as the new generation public chain Solana, Avalanche, Luna, Polygon, etc., which are rising in the bull market. Ethereum itself is not far behind. Layer2 expansion solutions Near, Abitrum, Zkysnc, Optimism, etc. entered the market to compete.\\n\\nThe new public chains use various technical solutions to try to surpass Ethereum in performance. Avalanche innovated the avalanche consensus. Near used sharding to expand, speed up and reduce fees, DEX, lending, machine gun pool and other applications flooded into the new public chain, and different versions were built.\\n\\nAlthough these public chains have lowered the threshold for using on-chain applications with low GAS fees and high speeds, and attracted users in turn, most of these users are overflow users of Ethereum. In general, the ecology of the new public chain is still a copy of Ethereum, which has entered the bottleneck of homogeneity. Some people in the industry believe that these public chains are more like competing with Ethereum for stock users, rather than developing an incremental market for blockchains.\\n\\nHow to stand out from many similar public chains is a question that all public chain ecology needs to think about, which means that the market needs differentiated competition. Subdivision of the track has become one of the \\\"tactics\\\", and Flow, which is also a new blockchain network, seems to know it well.\\n\\nAt the beginning of the design, the public chain Flow is different from other public chains. Its vision is not too ambitious, and it has no intention of becoming an \\\"Ethereum killer\\\". Its main goal is to become the infrastructure of NFT (non-homogeneous tokens). It is applied to commercial fields such as chain games and artworks, trying to become the position of NFT.\\n\\nThe Flow network is built by Dapper Labs, which is the developer of the originator-level blockchain game CryptoKitties. This pet-raising game created with the ERC-721 standard of the Ethereum smart contract was released in 2017 and only went online for only a few hours, directly blocking the Ethereum network. It is also because of the Ethereum performance problems exposed by CryptoKitties that Dapper Labs has the idea of ​​developing a separate chain, dedicated to NFT construction, and Flow was born from this.\\n\\nIn order to improve the processing efficiency on the chain, Flow adopts an original node management mechanism-a multi-node system architecture. The nodes in the network are divided into four roles:\\n\\nCollection node-mainly responsible for collecting and processing data;\\n\\nConsensus node-check whether the transaction exists and its order in the block;\\n\\nExecution node-execute transaction calculation;\\n\\nVerification node-supervise the execution node to ensure the correctness of the transaction.\\n\\nThe node functions of most blockchain networks are often very complete. A node not only needs to store information such as smart contracts and account balances, but also needs to perform various tasks such as transaction verification at the same time. This is also an important reason for limiting the scalability of Ethereum. Flow has made a change. It has clearly divided labor for each node in the network, and verified the different stages of the same transaction. Such a pipeline design greatly improves the efficiency of the network.\\n\\nIn 2020, the Flow public chain is officially launched. Dapper Labs adopts the method of cooperating with top IPs to launch NFT digital collections and game applications on the chain. The most famous first application is NBA Top Shot (NBA star card), which is online In 6 months, more than 700 million U.S. dollars of transactions have been generated, and the star card has dominated the NFT transaction volume rankings for a long time.\\n\\nThe market impact brought by NBA Top Shot is not only limited to the blockchain or encrypted community, but also attracts the attention of traditional media, enterprises and capital. It is reported that only about 20% of users who purchase NBA Top Shot star cards are encrypted users, and the vast majority are ordinary basketball fans or collectors.\\n\\nCompared with other emerging public chains, Flow has taken a unique path. It cooperates with mainstream IP to absorb the incremental users of the mass world through strong ecological support, and does not focus on the stock struggle of the chain and currency circles. At present, a group of developers who love NFT applications have gathered on the Flow chain. This issue of DeFi Cellular will take stock of representative applications on Flow.\\n\\nNFT Star Collection Card NBA Top Shot\\nIntroduction\\n\\nNBA TopShot is a sports collectible NFT game on the Flow chain-a game that casts star cards into non-homogeneous tokens. It allows users to draw cards and collect cards on the chain. These NFT star cards have been authorized by the NBA's official IP. It is the first sports big IP digital product that has been officially authorized on the chain.\\n\\nAccording to the NFT market data platform Cryptoslam, since the launch of NBA Top Shot, the transaction volume has reached 800 million US dollars, and the number of people with cards is as high as 610,000. In the entire NFT digital product market, the transaction value has been ranked in the top 5.\\n\\nNBATop Shot official website\\n\\nThe NBA Top Shot, which was cast as an NFT, recorded the iconic actions of some star players, such as lore shots, slam dunks, and milestones, such as key blocks in the James Finals, Kobe's free throws and so on. Among them, the record of LeBron James' pitching NFT card, once sold for a sky-high price of 208,000 US dollars.\\n\\nDifferent from traditional printed star cards, NBA Top Shot is issued on the blockchain and the information is recorded on the chain. Each star card is an NFT asset. Each NFT star card is unique and the holder has absolute control over it. This allows the star card screen to avoid the problems of tampering and piracy, and of course, it will not cause the problems of fading, oxidation and damage over time.\\n\\nSince NBA Top Shot is stored on the chain, it has more presentation methods than printed and issued star cards. In addition to pictures and text, NBA Top Shot also has a three-dimensional dynamic presentation effect. Each star card contains A short video of a specific moment of pitching, see the GIF animation for the effect. These contents together constitute a complete NBA Top Shot NFT asset.\\n\\nHow to play\\n\\nThe NBA TopShot star card is divided into three levels: Common, Rare and Legendary. The price is also determined by the star recorded by the card, the rarity and number of the pitching action.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, the higher the popularity of the star, the higher the price of the card; the scarcer the number, or the card that is widely regarded as a classic scoring moment in the competition, the higher the price.\\n\\nPlayers can purchase directly through the NBA Top Shot website. The platform not only supports payment methods for BTC, ETH, USDC and other encrypted assets, but also credit card payment. The purchased star card is allowed to be sold directly on the NFT trading platform.\\n\\nThe NBA TopShot star card is not only a collection value, the team will also develop game functions in the future to give it more playability. For example, players can create an NFT-style team based on their favorite star card and participate in online competitions.\\n\\n\\\"Gold Game\\\" Chainmonsters\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe Chinese name of Chainmonsters is called \\\"Chain Monster\\\", which is a massively multiplayer online role-playing (RPG) game native to the Flow chain. Players can capture monsters (Chainmons) in the game, explore or combine different types of monsters, upgrade their abilities, and battle other opponents.\\n\\nThe gameplay of ChainMonsters is similar to the game \\\"Pokémon\\\" released by Nintendo. Players look for some resources and teammates on the map designated by the game, and then fight monsters.\\n\\nChainmonsters official website\\n\\nUnlike the \\\"P2E (Play-to-Earn)\\\" type gold game that has recently become popular on the chain, in ChainMonsters, players earn not token rewards, but equipment and props presented in the form of NFT in the game. These NFTs are game assets and can be directly traded in the secondary market.\\n\\nChainMonsters players do not have any restrictions on participation thresholds. Unlike the chain game leader Axie Infinity, players who want to participate in the game first need to purchase three Pokemon \\\"Axie\\\", otherwise they cannot participate in the game. In ChainMonsters, players do not need to prepare any game assets to participate in the game. If players want to obtain monsters, they need to capture them in the game.\\n\\nIn Axie Infinity, the game rewards obtained by players are mainly SLP tokens, which are used to realize cash in the secondary market. The \\\"gold mine\\\" of ChainMonsters is a variety of monsters, or game equipment assets such as knives and axes that enhance skill. These assets can be directly traded in the NFT market.\\n\\nThe operation of ChainMonsters avoids the price risk of game tokens, which also ensures that the game itself is the essence of experience.\\n\\nHow to play\\n\\nChainMonsters set a story background: In a virtual world, a mysterious disease makes all creatures more aggressive and become monsters. These monsters come from 9 different elements (such as fire, water, electricity, air, crystals, etc.). Under this setting, the players in the game are \\\"agents\\\" and they need to catch the monster (Chainmon). Some monsters can only be found in specific areas, and some only appear in specific time periods. Catching monsters is the process of participating in the game.\\n\\nAfter the player catches the monsters, they can use the special materials and resources found to feed them and upgrade the monster's level. The process of finding materials and resources is set up as a game mission or level unlocking link. Just like the \\\"Missing Fun\\\" game, every level you pass will reward you with treasure chests. The built-in treasures can help players pass higher levels.\\n\\nPlayers can also combine different monsters against other players in order to win and improve the ranking. When players reach a certain level, they can get additional game equipment or item asset rewards, including character skins, adventure packs that increase energy, and so on. These items can also be traded in ChainMonsters' built-in NFT market.\\n\\nIt should be noted that ChainMonsters has not issued any tokens yet\\n\\nAvatar Genies\\nIntroduction\\n\\nGenies is a technology company that produces 3D virtual images. Under the development of the NFT boom, the company has established a trading market for virtual avatars and peripheral products based on the Flow chain.\\n\\nGenies official website\\n\\nGenies was originally a virtual image design company dedicated to the concept of meta universe. Its main business is to use artificial intelligence to develop a system for users to customize virtual images. Users can dress up their virtual images based on their hobbies and personality. Create richer shapes. Genies has developed 3D avatars for some celebrities, such as Justin Bieber and Daniel Wu.\\n\\nGenies has also established cooperation with the fashion industry. Last year, the company and the luxury brand Gucci (Gucci) reached a cooperation, users can visit Gucci's virtual mall \\\"Gucci wheel\\\", there are this brand of clothing and accessories, users can buy Gucci virtual goods for their avatars .\\n\\nIn May of this year, Genies received $65 million in Series B financing. Investment institutions include Dapper Labs, Coinbase Ventures, Polychain and other cryptocurrency venture capital institutions.\\n\\nAfter accumulating the power of virtual image design in the Internet world, Genies announced not long ago that it would use blockchain technology to build an on-chain transaction platform for virtual avatars and peripheral products, and chose to build on the Flow chain to allow celebrities’ virtual avatars to be combined with Peripheral commodities such as clothing, hair styles, and accessories are on the chain and become NFT assets, allowing users to trade freely.\\n\\nIn addition, Warner Music has reached a partnership with Genies, which will allow its artists to sell exclusive limited edition digital NFT assets to their fans in order to commemorate key life moments, such as the release of song albums or concert events. Singers and lyrics writers can also turn their acting moments or artistic creations into NFT products for fans to purchase.\\n\\nCurrently, Genies' virtual image NFT asset trading platform on Flow is still under construction and has not yet been officially released.\",\"timestamp\":1640312174,\"title\":\"Public chain Flow builds an NFT position\"},\"digest\":\"sRlSQxJpUA-JDBAsw-koMJpT1oJtOE8XFXAjbm3Ohjk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x19a23AfB21e123c626C2c4C19c34d2037Ac35734\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"EL8a_TEZ37Fsk07fsh582qKimmCRgiHSC0qfyO3DXDk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kV5Vnbk820BAjVyS-NuP9KvMyEpmlrG143vfWyV5Rhc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ArqTKZJ_uKWrIC30SSDSYYzBqnOourXpBt4J_lVdavXIxpm-fgrDArroQ_kVemLW8Dz9AXEeVVfZSLPyXy-LTA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc90ac90f7d589dc9b9ade93bd74549ef3371a1ac8188ca1bff6d8384d12a064207d56af5bb682ca55281254bb0b9f5a34f2241cc4f7afd3544bf6d17a1f0ea021c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"EL8a_TEZ37Fsk07fsh582qKimmCRgiHSC0qfyO3DXDk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kV5Vnbk820BAjVyS-NuP9KvMyEpmlrG143vfWyV5Rhc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"sRlSQxJpUA-JDBAsw-koMJpT1oJtOE8XFXAjbm3Ohjk\"}"
