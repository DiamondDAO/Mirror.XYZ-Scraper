"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Month, clear and pure, with a sense of shyness, hung in the dark blue sky.\\n\\n \\n\\nSince ancient times, the moon has been the emotional sustenance and the expression of mood of scholars in all dynasties. It was on such a moonlit night that Su Dongpo sang to the moon, and Li Taibai looked at the moon and fell in love, leaving a thousand immortal masterpieces.\\n\\n \\n\\nI looked up at the sky. The moon was so bright and bright, and the light emitted was so soft and quiet, which made people feel particularly comfortable. The moon is even more mysterious against the street lights.\\n\\n \\n\\nIn the same bright moon, in the quiet moon night, Su Shi took advantage of the wind with wine. It is self-evident that he was bold and broad-minded. Although he was not reunited with his family, he realized that \\\"people have joys and sorrows, and the moon has cloudy, sunny and round\\\" and poured out the best emotion of mankind from the bottom of his heart: \\\"I hope people will be long and beautiful for thousands of miles.\\\"\\n\\n \\n\\nThe same bright moon shines on the remote frontier fortress. \\\"The moon rises from the Tianshan Mountains, the vast sea of clouds, and the long wind blows tens of thousands of miles through the Yumen pass.\\\" The warriors guarding the border looked up at the moon and stood up against the blowing wind. They love the bright moon of the motherland. They are guarding the bright moon of the motherland.\\n\\n \\n\\n亦有海上明月：“海上有明月，此时天涯海角。” 两地的爱情，通过悬在天上的月亮，传递着对彼此的思念和慰藉。将心托在月光下，清光下你的情意更纯洁。\\n\\n \\n\\n月夜是李白“天山明月出，云海茫茫”长城外的崇高情怀；是苏东坡的《月亮来了，向蓝天请酒》的全家小姐；正是李玉的“西无痛之境，月如钩，孤梧桐深院锁秋”。\\n\\n \\n\\nOn the night of the moon, he gave inspiration to poets, boldness to warriors and courage to cowards. The moon night is like a poem and better than poetry. It has poetic emotion and is more flexible and graceful than poetry. Only he can show the unspeakable thousands of feelings incisively and vividly, and tell the joys and sorrows sealed in people's hearts for a long time. Lonely people regard the moon as a friend, confused people regard the moon as hope, and enterprising people regard the moon as faith. The bright moon shines because of people, and people have thousands of thoughts because of the moon night.\",\"timestamp\":1639147973,\"title\":\"CLEAR\"},\"digest\":\"DXScBJBi4g3MtMFoBIojQb6FzPgc-91rmqFr2Tlyj-g\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x23AEa38E737374A136894a0C02C65902D7F15bA4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FxnsPMQbq58R9zW6GWk-fW8f9kMnJk5ToXaZDMw0BdM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xGjIGegFcAiXBFVx_GD9BHwws9kWZEQ6Af4kM59Az_U\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"vAISGgI2ESpOejd3L1UHWzPDBNi-TKQRXwQiDiPdX1KzQPqeQsDGS2hRrFNiU_oLZAbD-MmmI-WhgBfb8aqKgA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9b707f4f415db1a431bb42cda231abd07fa3fcfb8b56fe870f4734bae5f414eb42ffa123065c5bbe50d853c2f99897cdeebce93d810f23cb595dfa855b044cfa1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FxnsPMQbq58R9zW6GWk-fW8f9kMnJk5ToXaZDMw0BdM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xGjIGegFcAiXBFVx_GD9BHwws9kWZEQ6Af4kM59Az_U\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"DXScBJBi4g3MtMFoBIojQb6FzPgc-91rmqFr2Tlyj-g\"}"
