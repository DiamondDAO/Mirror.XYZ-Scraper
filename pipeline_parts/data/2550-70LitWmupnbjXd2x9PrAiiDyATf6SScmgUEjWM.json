Work that arm a little harder! 48–49k levels are holding BTC down pretty strongly. If we don’t break up, we’ll break down. If you thought about buying something sometime, BTC now could be helpful relief for the bulls. Or should I begin to practice my other one, let’s goooo bears! \\n VPVR shows strong levels at 48–49k, right about our current prices. Then the trading book history shows a decently light load up to 56k.\\n\\nThe sun rises, the moon sets. Usually. LUNA isn’t sticking to her faithyfully laid bear path. Full, [bright ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NSE-BRIGHT/)and illuminating our way forward through the [bearish](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/bearish/) lulls since late October early November. Waiting for the light can be exhausting. Stars falling, never knowing which might be your last to see. As long as the market does not dip, LUNA looks good ‘till $110.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AHx1MVuksZGLZfJgpgeLp.png?height=307&width=770)\\n\\nWhat is LUNA? Start with Terra. An algorithmic stablecoin that was built with a Byzantine Fault Tolerant proof-of-stake ( [PoS ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/MYX-POS/)) consensus algorithm; collateralized by a second native token called Luna (LUNA). Luna can exist in three states:\\n\\n* Unbonded: This is Luna that can be freely transacted as a regular token, with no restrictions.\\n* Bonded: While Luna is bonded, it is considered staked and generates rewards for the delegator and validator it is bonded to. The Luna cannot be freely traded and is locked in the ecosystem until it is fully unbonded.\\n* Unbonding: Luna that is instructed to be undelegated from a delegator transition into an “unbonding” state during which neither rewards accrue nor the Luna can be freely traded. This unbonding phase takes 21 days to complete, after which the Luna returns to an unbonded state.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VafOvywaHrF5XX5MKGYip.png?height=277&width=770)\\n\\nLINK has had a rough year. Up only 110% or so for the year. Terrible really. (/me licks his paws) Opportunities came and went in 2021 where 100’s of percent gains, 1000’s were possible, made, lost, made and lost, and watched go’on by.\\n\\nAt $23.69, a move toward $27–28 is in the making. It doesn’t have to be straight up. $21 LINK is likely along the way.\\n\\nMore from me at\\n\\n* <https://mirror.xyz/0x48e1A84CBcAB14ADe9086A4e0812D82f56d3d3C1/>\\n* [https://medium.com/@calmrat](https://medium.com/%40calmrat)\\n* <https://twitter.com/calmrat>\\n\\nTrading bonuses and more at…\\n\\n* *Crypto.com — <https://crypto.com/exch/v4n3pauckj>*\\n* *Binance — <https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=346510770>*\\n* *Bybit — <https://www.bybit.com/en-US/invite?ref=EKJRL>*\\n* *FTX — <https://ftx.com/profile#a=60256726>*\\n\\nMy ideas and opinions are that alone.
