"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"In Los Angeles, USA, there was a drunk man lying on the street. The police helped him up and saw that he was a local rich man. When the police said he was going to take him home, the rich man said: \\\"Home? I don't have a home.\\\"  The police pointed out The villa not far away asked: \\\"What is that?\\\"   \\\"That is my house\\\". The rich man said. In our world, many people think that a home is a house or a courtyard. However, once you or your loved ones move away from there, once the warmth and affection there is lost, do you still think that it is home? For celebrities, it is the former residence; for ordinary people, it can only be said that they were there. I have lived there, and it is no longer a home.  What is a home? A true story that happened in Rwanda in 1983, may be able to make an appropriate annotation for the home. During the civil war in Rwanda, there was a man named Géral, 37 years old, and his family of 40 people, his father, brothers, sisters, wives and children were almost all separated and lost their lives. Finally, the desperate Géral inquired about the 5-year-old child. The daughter is still alive, so he went to and fro, risking his life to find his own flesh and blood. He mixed sorrows and joys and held his daughter tightly in his arms. The first sentence was: \\\"I have a home again.\\\"  In In this world, home is a place full of affection. Sometimes it is in the bamboo fence hut, sometimes in the Gaowuhuatang, and sometimes among the homeless. People who have no family affection and those who are forgotten by love are the real ones. People who don't have a home. A home is a family and affection, not a big house where you live.\",\"timestamp\":1634476614,\"title\":\"What is home\"},\"digest\":\"zhohnP4V3Nogo9_6nceWZMPRAPJoGMaS9KKsK2lXFwA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8F334aC7f2f32F67f6Dc61437a417111495c4eA9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wHX3BA6Y3a45AB5nabMgraP8QESRwqUOXYP7X8Mptpk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"La0z8yjSJoRN0ybPhUG3F2Onl8_uY8W3N2vt39uTuMw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"cE4LwWXWB-WuwzuCuQ-jZluFDtReHLGLVugCZoK1XotNG6CAllIP4C2tX6E3mi3TnfZvUS4PymPFGmIdTiTQNg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8362e32c0d070026b357c877590c2c7133f7003313156bc517fdf4e6c7a9e1112cae8f679d22ef52d6b13cff9e129a7f7cafd4d91ea8cbbb4f6abdbb1698d5411c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wHX3BA6Y3a45AB5nabMgraP8QESRwqUOXYP7X8Mptpk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"La0z8yjSJoRN0ybPhUG3F2Onl8_uY8W3N2vt39uTuMw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"zhohnP4V3Nogo9_6nceWZMPRAPJoGMaS9KKsK2lXFwA\"}"
