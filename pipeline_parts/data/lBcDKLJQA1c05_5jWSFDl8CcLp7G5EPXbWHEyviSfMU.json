Unrestricted NFTs allow for the ownership, buying/selling, or trading of an asset. Restricted NFTs are different in that they do not support any sort of transferability.\\n\\nNFTs do not generate income in their basic form. When they're utilized to create vTokens, on the other hand, they may become part of the decentralized finance landscape.\\n\\n## NFT Vaults & Staking\\n\\nStaking is a less resource-intensive alternative to mining. It entails maintaining funds in a bitcoin wallet to keep the security and functionality of a blockchain network. Staking, in a nutshell, is the process of securing assets to earn incentives.\\n\\nStaking has been adopted by various cryptocurrencies, including VeChain, Tezos, Decred, Navcoin, and many others. In fact, most NFT projects are likely to start staking as a means of generating passive income from their platform. [ZombieToadz](https://opensea.io/collection/zombietoadzofficial), a [CryptoToadz](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptoadz-by-gremplin) derivative, has already embraced this approach, creating $BRAINZ tokens tied to their vault's acquisition of Toadz themselves, staking the value of the pool against the value of the Toadz.\\n\\nThe ability to stake is not unique to NFTs. However, staking has become necessary for gaining the required utility out of NFT vTokens.\\n\\nVaults are storage facilities for NFTs. Vaults are utilized by vToken issuers to offer token holders access to their locked assets.\\n\\nAnyone with an Ethereum address can generate a vault for any NFT asset. Anybody may deposit eligible NFTs into a vault to create a fungible NFT-backed cryptocurrency called a \\\"vToken.\\\"\\n\\nvTokens utilize NFTs as collateral to be held in escrow during a secure, peer-to-peer lending system facilitated by decentralized exchanges. In short, one party leaves an asset locked up as collateral, and the other receives a loan from that asset at a reduced interest rate.\\n\\nThe creator of a vToken can specify the number of underlying assets in a vault and will also have to outline the pricing mechanism, which should be linked directly to the price of the underlying asset or basket of assets. The vToken protocol has been implemented on Ethereum.\\n\\nA vToken is a financial instrument that generates an income from the underlying asset it represents. This income can occur through interest, dividends, or coupons paid out regularly.\\n\\nA vToken representing a digital property can pay out an ongoing fractional income to its owner, which increases in value based on the underlying asset's performance. A tokenized fraction of an NFT would result in ongoing fees that can replace traditional income streams.\\n\\nUsers can earn protocol fees, trade fees as a liquidity provider, and farm with vTokens as loan collateral. vTokens will be a crucial part of building decentralized applications that can rival their centralized counterparts in speed, efficiency, and scalability.\\n\\n## Protocols Designed For Passive Income\\n\\nStaking protocols allow for broader distribution and increased fairness of delivery since they establish a new standard for the settlement and transfer of tokens. Platforms that utilize these protocols will benefit from the increased reach and new fairness of distribution resulting from adoption.\\n\\nNew content may be quickly used to generate liquid markets for virtual assets, which will maximize their utility.\\n\\nDifferent types of staking protocols may offer distinct advantages in the decentralization of finance that is not available in today's tradmarkets.\\n\\nLending protocols allow for the creation financial assets that can be used as collateral on a decentralized lending platform.\\n\\nP2P lending is a massively underserved market but one ripe with potential. The introduction of next-generation credit scoring and asset tokenization will provide the conditions needed to advance lending onto the blockchain.\\n\\nAsset-backed lending could provide borrowers with high liquidity, low margin rates, fast settlement timeframes, and efficient risk management protocols.\\n\\nCollateralized stablecoins represent another class of asset tokenization that can be used as a means of payment or store of value for holding fiat currency on the Ethereum mainnet.\\n\\nNFTs are generally relatively illiquid and difficult to price. Staking protocols make speculating in the NFT market a lot easier. It also enables platforms to price and sell their NFTs faster and provide customers with a better user experience.\\n\\nThis allows for near-instant transaction speeds and dramatically reduces transaction costs.\\n\\nNFTs are an incredibly flexible class of digital property, with applications in art, gaming, finance, and more. This technology will also enable decentralized organizations to control their own governance protocols that do not sacrifice transparency or decentralization. Passive income is a valuable mechanism for monetizing NFTs and generating value from digital properties.\\n\\nCollateralized stablecoins are extremely useful for businesses that primarily operate on the Ethereum mainnet. A collateralized stablecoin can protect businesses from price fluctuations while at the same time increasing their ability to transact with customers in a fast, efficient manner.\\n\\nThe next-gen protocols aim to be an industry standard that enables the tokenization of any asset or financial contract to create a new class of next-generation decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\\n\\n## Recommended Reading\\n\\n*   [An introduction to NFTX V2](https://blog.nftx.io/introducing-nftx-v2/)\\n*   [NFT Staking Explained | How to Earn Income from NFTs](https://coinmarketexpert.com/nft-staking/)\\n*   [ZombieToadz $BRAINZ](https://zombietoadz.com/)\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633599581,\"title\":\"Passive Income Through Staking As An NFT Feature/Benefit\"},\"digest\":\"V59K4QqpaBJlF_7CZiGssbK0MyCvED6shOIr6lq2KXw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xdEb3348Eb6fa98193cE2229a5B71175edb5F5f76\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_4UzcY_SrUdsK55e-hJh5v6U9EmmPZQzx7Ld4UH48gk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"P0MiRV0AwbmGsMNmnO1omIBEz6XLWNW2YrBpet8GbWU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"4C70e3n3aGDKOAf7DOLJ_UgEOwm-7S9-3Bi8LL1DDh53QbOftqAYH2DBkkFIUt5NdCXYId9hl7YQac0Fo6cnxw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xac98ca7a572993673ccc0a1771d13723f9fdcbfb594442bee78cf8ba88ee632b70efbe4e536657a079bc5d5007e6adf6eda4f1f9fe1c1cbda658c127158434c41b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_4UzcY_SrUdsK55e-hJh5v6U9EmmPZQzx7Ld4UH48gk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"P0MiRV0AwbmGsMNmnO1omIBEz6XLWNW2YrBpet8GbWU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"V59K4QqpaBJlF_7CZiGssbK0MyCvED6shOIr6lq2KXw\"}"
