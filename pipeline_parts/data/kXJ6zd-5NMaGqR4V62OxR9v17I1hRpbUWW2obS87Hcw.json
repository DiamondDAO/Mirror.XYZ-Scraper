"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Since announcing NFT DevCon we’ve in inundated with people arguing we should run the conference DAO on this or that ETH L2, with many arguing for Solana. Rather than Mommy and Daddy choosing a favorite, we’re going to choose violence and opt for ETH & Solana. \\n\\nWhile this will undoubtedly cause headaches it’s also the most inclusive and interesting decision. \\n\\nNFTs are a multi-platform phenomenon. If the concept of digital property rights is going to take off, we need to embrace that they will be accounted for on all manner of ledgers. For now, the two leaders are ETH and Solana so that’s where we’re going to sell tickets and hold voting. \\n\\nWe’re not aware of any other DAO that exists cross-chain but we’re excited for what it means. Like states inside a larger union, we have no doubt that the Solana and ETH factions of the NFT DevCon DAO will have different ideas on how the event should go and who should speak. Our hope is that all involved will rise to the challenge and see it as an opportunity to build bridges (technical and interpersonal), not devolve into tribal warfare. \\n\\n## How will two DAO’s work? \\n\\nProbably not very well. The Tooling for NFT DAO’s on Ethereum is in it’s infancy to say the least. NFT events on ETH have some options but still, there isn’t an Eventbrite level product to speak of. On Solana the tooling is even less robust. Both ecosystems move rapidly so we stand ready to be corrected in the above statements. \\n\\nSuffice it to say that we will be taping a few solutions together to make this work, but we’ll do our best to “build public” as the kids say. \",\"timestamp\":1638155409,\"title\":\"Double DAO dare you\"},\"digest\":\"oDCHtyAGpT6THtjH-8qv9GTeDytR9noeo1__Or9Jj-E\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2271fe6D76ab94352eF826d97445048Bd8C4d45F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PMp8O2_akzmx_A4O7GNxYT_w0Rm9ggrsoFvxbiWOkDM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8zL8_Z-YBWKTmEMT7uLxFl_gegFwwVwJgZ5Wtb3Tlxs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"zLdYxw-nr8lN6Q55sUiT_IJeIRWMWjNMBa0GEumTsQV8UwQ_HL8T5nUaJ365Rnx-UUB6zbp02k2OBAfz6eK7og\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb49603e2865862d0e9b3876e4d199d81c9688062658fdaf11b8c8af03a3240de3bff1d26308591c937bb2efbb41e89ff58ac9ba15b2a88c2123e0ffdf8d487f61b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PMp8O2_akzmx_A4O7GNxYT_w0Rm9ggrsoFvxbiWOkDM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8zL8_Z-YBWKTmEMT7uLxFl_gegFwwVwJgZ5Wtb3Tlxs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"oDCHtyAGpT6THtjH-8qv9GTeDytR9noeo1__Or9Jj-E\"}"
