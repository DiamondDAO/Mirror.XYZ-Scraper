"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"NFTs are tokens for digital assets which have already been created, but how to deal with continuously generated data clustering? Such as car driving data, health data, and so on.\\n\\nDigital artworks are only minted on the chain after they are completed, and this can easily be faked. If the artist does not mint his work as soon as he finished it, and he has published this work on the Internet, then there is a possibility that other people may copy this work and mint it in their names. And it will be difficult to prove who creates this work first.\\n\\nHow to solve this problem? For works that have been finished, there is really not much that can be done, just like putting entities on-chain. For works that haven’t been created yet, artists can keep minting the process of them creating that work. All the data of the creating the work can be stored in IPFS. When an artist begins to create a work, he mints the first NFT for the process of the creation. It’s like buying a new canvas in digital world. The ideas, materials, and creation process of the work can all be minted and stored on IPFS. Ipfs storage is not as safe as blockchain, but it is good enough to provide reliable timestamps for the work.\",\"timestamp\":1641275511,\"title\":\"Capsule#13/5/2021 NFT and Continuously Generated Data Clustering\"},\"digest\":\"F1ma4_M0s4Ul-NB235ItZPvSlyiBylC2BOCioog32Fs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xE828f8bE1a3CB994133936fB4D9A708a7D192462\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"gOHMmQ9P_y2TVcV8Qrz8iyXHAv_PMMieU9Wy9Vp0x-I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"yDnUuex-dIKsOpLC_3QhAeEnmSqyhEHK1hoSG8Ekt1M\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"cyp7bnOcLQkFMSJzjhVFkAXrDQlLaMkvrX4ZkJqm7SnGE4zw5nxaLWwbARjYp_5-SYEPFbwIWL7Z5m_yGQn3Jw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x6a283df5b757e824b47d48a1de6fbfb12cf313d4ad86d979a82b3a6197d660ea60471b71df52bcfd00401679cf82d6526d1c3ba18f14d44cc229552486f545681c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"gOHMmQ9P_y2TVcV8Qrz8iyXHAv_PMMieU9Wy9Vp0x-I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"yDnUuex-dIKsOpLC_3QhAeEnmSqyhEHK1hoSG8Ekt1M\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"a8unMfWYSqOCls6glN9a-F9P_cpvUNNgGU01IpGx7ag\"}"
