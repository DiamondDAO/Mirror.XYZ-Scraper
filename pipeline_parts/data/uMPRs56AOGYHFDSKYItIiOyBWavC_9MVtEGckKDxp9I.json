"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## WHITE HAT DAO Vision / Mission\\n\\n> Welcome to **White Hat DAO**. We are a decentralised community with DAO governance. Our mission is to innovate, initiate, apply Blockchain technology, DeFi culture, and education to build a better and transparent world !!\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\nDAO:\\\\*\\\\* A DAO is a blockchain-based system that enables people to coordinate and govern themselves mediated by a set of self-executing rules deployed on a public blockchain, and whose governance is decentralised (independent from central control)DAO Description: Whether \\\"We as a self governed decentralised autonomous organisation\\\" could be considered as an entity separate from the human entities that operate it (i.e. as a legal person) or whether it can only be considered as an entity when it is identified as such by the law (i.e. the law should identify a DAO as a legal person for the DAO to be considered as such). Yet, the common understanding today is that the ‚Äúautonomous‚Äù nature of a DAO is incompatible with the notion of legal personhood, as legal personhood can only be established if there is one or more identified actors responsible for the actions of a particular entity. The discussion on whether a DAO should be recognised as a legal person has important implications in the legal field, as it can determine the extent to which a DAO can be considered as a separate legal entity from its human actors, and therefore the extent to which these actors can be shielded from the liabilities of the DAO.\\n\\n**DeFi:** Decentralised finance, or DeFi for short, is **a system in which customers can access financial products directly on a decentralised blockchain network**, without the need for middlemen such as banks and brokerages. Evolution is the answer to everything that exists, and finance is no exception.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nWhite Hat DAO is a decentralised autonomous organisation.
