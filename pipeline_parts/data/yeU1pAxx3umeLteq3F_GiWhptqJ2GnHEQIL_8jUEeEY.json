"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones is famous for tripling his wealth by shorting the stock market ahead of the 1987 market crash. Born in Memphis, Tennessee and educated at the University of Virginia, he cut his teeth trading cotton futures in the 1970s before founding Tudor Investment Corporation in 1980. The fund now manages $38 billion in assets, and his personal wealth is estimated to be nearly $6 billion. Jones is a philanthropist, having signed The Giving Pledge to donate most of his wealth to charity. He has only a few major regrets: not investing more into tech companies in the 1990s and his friendship with now-disgraced entertainment mogul Harvey Weinstein.\",\"timestamp\":1639032316,\"title\":\"The best profit-maximizing strategy is to own the fastest horse.\"},\"digest\":\"jTOo01XPs5C8wnq-HUVZ_ydJRibay4YjkBSI_P9iXZQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xbFB7274590157C4aAAdd7870A01fBEEfdbfC268b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"TN34qtJcLluBmagRFvapOo13xBg_XJSWofKH3PvqHbM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ruGD1uyf0a068pBE6h4R9haLR4Rjqowa-bMVKGP8BvU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"uWVnDMVlGHBGlMk47xT5HrhKqf3gdPersHpK7sDQX2hNZIbYS1QaduCHAjS9XhcGDEiafxgLv5ALbzO2Y-F3xQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x11cb53ca9a0c63af31ebc5a5056598a36ac0b060a6f38ae0520ee062d2cb93874ec84fb04f3bf8c274a1282c771a230452029dfb70afa657fbcd49173c764a671b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"TN34qtJcLluBmagRFvapOo13xBg_XJSWofKH3PvqHbM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ruGD1uyf0a068pBE6h4R9haLR4Rjqowa-bMVKGP8BvU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jTOo01XPs5C8wnq-HUVZ_ydJRibay4YjkBSI_P9iXZQ\"}"
