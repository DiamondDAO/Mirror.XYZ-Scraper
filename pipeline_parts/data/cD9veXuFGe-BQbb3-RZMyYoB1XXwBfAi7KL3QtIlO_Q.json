"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## The Value of Community IRL and Online.\\n\\nWhen I reflect on my upbringing I always am reminded of the sense of community that I was raised in. I had an extended network of family friends made in church, birthdays, events, concerts, etc. I love connecting with people and getting to know them by spending time in their presence. The past two years I’ve missed out on the frequency of those gatherings- but I’m hopeful we can return to physical spaces once again and create new memories with each other. In this time I’ve also seen the power of community online. I’ve seen us band together to help each other in ways never seen before. With Web3/Crypto we’ve been able to create networks of people and given opportunities to transcend each other's material circumstances. It’s beautiful- and we have the power to amplify its frequency. Our movement may have been birthed online but it doesn’t have to end here.\\n\\n## The Problem\\n\\nOur planet and humanity are in a state of crisis. Multiple social and ecological actions need to take place to radically transform our communities, equipping them with the tools to lead movements towards regenerative and climate-positive initiatives. The problem is we don’t feel we have the power to save the planet. Many of us have felt chained to the old patterns of pain, suffering, and exploitation that generations before us have experienced. Our hearts and minds need to be healed to even feel hopeful about the future.\\n\\nOur climate anxiety can often be traced back to old businesses that dominated the 20th century: the traditional financial system, oil, coal, and the military. These structures will do everything they can to maintain and uphold their power. The amount of harm done by them is painfully clear. The argument that these entities are too big to fight and we will never be able to dismantle these systems that have oppressed millions is one bred from apathy and division- tools use to trap us in cycles of powerlessness.\\n\\nThat is the source of the problem for many of us- creating the impression that we don’t have the power to change things.\\n\\n## The Solution\\n\\n***Community Care*** is the foundation of trust. We have to share a common care for one another to trust each other and to organize new forms of governance and create alternatives to the dystopian future sold to us. I envision community care as a new paradigm for interacting with those around you. It’s a pivot towards listening. It’s taking the time to help your neighbors. It’s making an effort to support people in the ways they need- not what you think they need. It’s unconditional love. Showing grace and compassion when they express anxiety or fearfulness. Community care is being present with those around you so that you can address and solve the problems in front of us rather than worry about what happened/will happen.\\n\\nI firmly believe we can reverse the ecological damage created by multi-trillion dollar corporations/imperial entities that have benefitted from exploiting nature and communities of color for so many years. **We can no longer wait for them to take action- we just need to organize and do it ourselves.**\\n\\nWeb 3 and cryptocurrency offer an alternative. A future where we own the systems we use. A future where we’re invested in our environments rather than passive consumers of it.\\n\\nBy utilizing blockchain technology we can create new networks of global mutual aid and deploy capital to organize initiatives in our communities that improve the environment/well-being of its constituents. We deserve a society where power is distributed fairly. Where the communities of people who have been locked out of the conversation have access to tools that shape the future. We need to hear the voices of women, blacks, indigenous, and people of color who if given the opportunity and the capital could create tangible solutions to some of our most important problems.\\n\\nWith it, we can create cross-border funds and develop a boundless global network for capital to flow through. Peer-to-peer transactions that contribute to causes that matter. Art projects that general capital and royalties contribute directly to initiatives in perpetuity. We can create new paths for people to access capital to carry out solutions in ways never seen before. Want to rally people around a specific ecological or social problem? Let’s create a DAO for it and pool money together to see it get solved. Now contributors can gain governance tokens and vote on how the money gets used. The possibilities are truly endless.\\n\\n## The Vision: A Regenerative Economy\\n\\nCollectively we have the power to shift our world into a new way of doing things. A space where we repair the damage done with a smile on our face. I see a world where new forms of self-governance create an era of peace- where the work of all the revolutionaries is not gone in vain but used to build a fair and equitable society. Not the fleeting concept of a utopia- but a better world that is tangible and within arms reach. Revolutionary optimism is created by spending time supporting our communities. We have the power to restore faith in humanity- one conversation at a time.\\n\\nThe Idea of a Regenerative economy is one where people are incentivized to do so in a way that not only is environmentally friendly- but actively aids the mission to regenerate our local ecosystems. With the help of Indigenous leadership, we can return our soils to a healthy balance. We can reward people for addressing their community's ecological needs.\\n\\nImagine all the regenerative practices we could fund and be owners of! Community members could be paid to start a garden, a recycling center, an ocean clean-up team, a mushroom growing initiative to clean up heavy metals/oils in contaminated soil, reclaim old mines, replacing public spaces with native species. We could even create public interactive art that supports a variety of social causes.\\n\\n## Final Notes\\n\\n### Before I finish this I want to leave you with 3 ways you can become a part of this movement.\\n\\n* Relax. The world seems like it’s in a perpetual state of doom and catastrophe- but our ability to think clearly will help us fix its problems.\\n* Listen and discuss. Begin having hard conversations with your peers, family, and community about the environment and humanity. How can we heal our relationship with nature and each other when we live in an environment we are not connected to?\\n* Learn. Start small. Learn about the native species of plants in your area. Learn about the people in your community. Learn about the problems in your neighborhood’s ecosystem. From there we have the opportunity to develop.\\n\\nI hope these tips help you set the framework for a shift in yourself and your environment. We can’t fix the world overnight but we can shift ourselves in a position to help build the networks that collectively have the power to repair it.\\n\\n## Who Am I?\\n\\nIf you’ve read this far- thank you for taking the time to read! My name is Toha, I’m a multi-hyphenate driven by a passion for nature, audiovisual art, and tech.\\n\\nThis thought piece is my genesis entry edition on mirror.xyz. My writing is an experimentation and exploration of this tech alongside my journey to regenerating my own life/community. Through my entries, I hope to expand our perceptions of nature, communities, art, and tech. My goal is to build bridges to a world where we all can appreciate the planet, each other, and the things we create. A world where our actions are connected to things that matter- ecological and social justice, health and well-being, natural regenerative practices, and developing technology to give us the power to lead happier ***real*** lives. If you’d like to support me and my studio ***Aeia Labs*** there are 3 tiers for being a collector of this genesis piece.\\n\\n* Legendary, 5/5, 1 ETH\\n* Rare, 50/50, 0.1 ETH\\n* Common, 500/500, 0.01 ETH\\n\\nAll collectors will receive a special NFT airdrop from me that will vary based on tier. Please note I will be doing the airdrop via the Polygon so please have Polygon Mainnet set up in your wallet.\\n\\nHere are previews of them :)\\n\\n### Don’t Forget - 5/5 (MP4)\\n\\n![https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/21670598913955867771109758330325978474554066241673859029258943069074799722501](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JaGQOZ6e6DqCnvc1b7WLm.png?height=1080&width=1080)\\n\\n### Energy is Currency 50/50 (MP4)\\n\\n![https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/21670598913955867771109758330325978474554066241673859029258943070174311350322](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Bp7PSgL8yuNHw1R6wfKRV.png?height=1080&width=1080)\\n\\n### Listen 500/500 (PNG)\\n\\n![https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/21670598913955867771109758330325978474554066241673859029258943071273822978548](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PULIGHKnv1oFINVNo4CDq.png?height=1080&width=1080)\\n\\nAs we grow a community of collectors for these pieces I will be working on a discord server for us to connect further to learn each other’s stories and visions. \\n\\n### Roadmap? Aeia Labs?\\n\\nTruthfully I’m releasing this NFT as an artist to build Aeia Labs. I find it challenging to create linear paths for projects. I’d like to present the idea that Aeia Labs is is a living project that has the power to change and adapt based on the needs of the community. My **immediate priority** is to build community connections around these ideas and build a safe space for us to organize and create art and initiatives based on our goals. The ETH raised will be seed funding for this space- (probably located somewhere in the greater Los Angeles area- but open to other locations based on the location of collectors). As time progresses we could expand and vote on how to specifically deploy capital in ways that regenerate local ecosystems and other shared interests. I’m building this in public so any feedback is appreciated! \\n\\nHappy to share this journey into web3 and regenerating the world! For now, let’s stay connected:\\n\\n[https://tell.ie/Toha/yLitJ1tzlzCs](https://tell.ie/Toha/yLitJ1tzlzCs)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637280337,\"title\":\"Regenerating the Planet and Humanity through the Power of Community and Ownership\"},\"digest\":\"iNVE2qLjyhz0_hMkDi2zOnSbjvpY1sZOKMchqLWbXrk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2fE91Fd3ceA81B04c99060a8b3f53Abf2612e8Bb\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JWfYNYk_SQNHc59tgy1wL5fennqrg-WJWtlmUEwfpM8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"BCe6eR1LvGjA1P7OKucTrhdkYQwhyNK_NWZaOSPTaNI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"5bW1Hy__fno6QZbkEpCtR8rnfG3sGWjKrGp98P-PS-A3uha7x8wL6Fv2tGZY8D8O-9POGIYIEXRT2VVe39ayzQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x7f2c92e6aaa7b6f67734e259694684171b86bf28e1d29b13a6e3f7623915491c31a5b4fc5e7ce8b4315cd3be9a8c7bffd59f2b1bf656a35ba85038352221f21d1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JWfYNYk_SQNHc59tgy1wL5fennqrg-WJWtlmUEwfpM8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"BCe6eR1LvGjA1P7OKucTrhdkYQwhyNK_NWZaOSPTaNI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"0X2ZujycDm52AYEzYD315QBB6dNFKNVfMEoTEGvHqoE\"}"
