"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The Family Plan has been adopted for several years, most of the young generation are only child because their parents follow the government’s policy. Over more than 30years, most family are made up of grandparents, parents and a child. Here comes the problem, the society is facing an aging situation, more and more people are getting old while the young people are less. For a typical family, four grow-ups are at the age of over 40 with a young kid less than 20years old. The aging society is getting more and more obvious, such phenomenon has been catch mass media’s attention. The policy of one child has been doubted, it has been strongly advised that a family is allowed to raise two kids. I totally agree with that, it not only bring happiness to family, but also relieve the pressure of aging problem.\",\"timestamp\":1639035655,\"title\":\"The Aging Phenomenon\"},\"digest\":\"VxUVtnyDPhPogM0joRrT-tzOcO_Fnqe_liumCGcPrDM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xAC5cF9219F34AF1edD537b21d3aeCE520dB63Dad\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GcqqUj_1NtTqePBvEjAOl88XzUPNHGnuSn5cGVMq7wI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"WVhaPBI7JOWZAk4eLMDlz3hj6rm1AF7fJby-2-c57Vg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"pAu1WAtbZu4wHN9SHkCDrMdUYE9nsajJ7ieEndXFt7h09yTiFFankTXJmSCXuDF0qDW6SDMps6IKlEZPBVxtoQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf0d6aef925497a5e6173487141136c3e09c0793e012b78bc28e7b349850c60203055306e256a9f961fee89d763465b9ba7e5d9b4655ed1a6e730f81bcd6011291c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GcqqUj_1NtTqePBvEjAOl88XzUPNHGnuSn5cGVMq7wI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"WVhaPBI7JOWZAk4eLMDlz3hj6rm1AF7fJby-2-c57Vg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"VxUVtnyDPhPogM0joRrT-tzOcO_Fnqe_liumCGcPrDM\"}"
