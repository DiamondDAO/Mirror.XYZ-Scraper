Blockchain is a revolution that we cannot miss. Everything is going to change as you know it; decentralization has come to stay. Those of us in the crypto world not only to make money, but we can predict the rise of DAOs as we can see the possibiliy to improve things\\n\\nCrypto has changed the way we make money and collaborate. NFTs, Web3, Metaverse, and Social tokens grant content creators a range of possibilities that were unimaginable a few years ago. Through DAOs, different communities will have access to a series of tools that empowers them compared to large companies / banks.\\n\\n## THE CREATOR’S ECONOMY\\n\\nGen Z has some common characteristics. They admire youtubers and tiktokers because they make money off their passions, brands give them clothes, and they have an abundance of items. All of that happens online. They have grown up in a world where a young boy from his home can create a multi-million dollar company. Influencers are the new rock stars.\\n\\nAnother common feature is that they share their lives online . They upload their experiences and thoughts to networks and share the content of personalities they like the most. Before twitch and youtube, a cable company decided what we watched. Today that is unthinkable, the users see what they want and it is necessary for the creators to reward a loyal fanbase in some way. Some of these creators have a larger audience than large communication companies.\\n\\nBut there is still a problem for the creators: ownership and partnerships. Since the content creator economy appeared, we have seen several phases.\\n\\nFirst, people used the networks as a voice to unleash their creativity. Over time, people who gathered a large audience began to monetize it through platforms that allowed them to live off their content. We are now at a stage in which the creator himself is the one who creates his business. The creators have found that they can establish direct contact with followers by skipping various intermediaries.\\n\\nThe web3 is going to revolutionize the internet as we know it. In the future you will connect directly with your wallet to the website and that way you can contribute to the creator directly with cryptocurrencies. Defi allows you to create value to tokens through liquidity pools or staking and this is how creators can create their own token, which they can give to the most loyal users. The greater the relationship and the audience, the more value that token will have. So creator / follower will be a kind of partner as they are both interested in growing the business. The tokens would work as a share of a company, except that in this case you are investing in a person. Really revolutionary.\\n\\n## SOCIAL TOKENS\\n\\nHow could they return that power that creators acquire as their numbers grow?\\n\\nThe creators have the possibility of using platforms such as Coinvise, which facilitates the creation of a virtual currency through smart contracts and blockchain. They also give you the option to airdrop or create rewards for users.\\n\\nHow can social tokens interact with the community?\\n\\nThey will be used to access prepaid content. Fans will not only support your project but will buy a part of it. Once the creator or project earns money, as a hodler of the social token you will be incentivized to advertise it. It will be the community itself who will invest in marketing for the project, knowing that they also earn more.\\n\\nAnother benefit is that they will have is for the governance of the project.\\n\\nThe followers will vote for future strategies and the creator, in order to keep the community happy, will decide based on the votes. It will be the creators who decide what% of the profits will be returned to the investors of the social token. Thus also creating a healthy competition in which companies / creators will fight to be the one who most rewards their community.\\n\\nFor many years intermediaries have lived off the art that others created. Debian doing marketing work that creators / artists don’t want to do. A label was the one who decided when to release the songs and a publisher if the book was good to publish. Social tokens change everything because in this case it will be the community together with the creator who decides. Everything much more person to person.\\n\\n## HOW DOES THE DAMAGE FIT IN ALL THIS?\\n\\nPeople are starting to create companies from home with a couple of friends they met on a discord channel. It sounds weird, but some of these companies currently have millions of revenues and they started with an idea and a community of people who supported it and wanted to be part of it.\\n\\nWork flexibility is increasingly valued. Working for a large company is not the goal of the youngest, they want to create their own. The freedom of time and the possibility of working from anywhere on the planet will change the way in which cities and communications between people are designed. In 5–10 years the metaverse will be more visited than the street.\\n\\nThe idea that a group of friends with a common taste and goals can create a joint treasury and through votes established with smart contracts, develop a product that ends up attracting thousands of users is more real than ever.\\n\\nDAOs are a very recent tool, it is still difficult to find clear information and he thinks that creating your own economy must pose a series of complicated problems at the moment.\\n\\nThanks to cryptographic mechanisms, DAOs allow people to collaborate transparently and easily around a joint mission.\\n\\nThe value of the DAO will depend on the benefits they report to the users who join\\n\\nIt is important to give incentives such as tokens to the most active members of the DAO.\\n\\nDAOs also lead to better governance as simple votes can decide the future of the DAO. The token hodlers will be able to launch proposals and it will be the other users who vote.\\n\\n## CONCLUSION\\n\\nThe idea behind a DAO is that a person does not need large companies behind to create a great community, they can find a group of people with whom to build a joint project. The idea of ​​social tokens can be directed to a single creator, or to a DAO in which several people will start creating content for others and in which the goal is for more people to join and collaborate.\\n\\nWe are still in a very early stage, those who enter DAOs at this time that a priori only seem like small communities, will be rewarded as the projects grow. Twitter is abuzz with ideas and people who, while the world in general does not seem to be going through its best moment, still have hope that things can be fairer.\\n\\nI think that 10 years from now the voting processes of any kind will be more transparent thanks to the DAOs. Donations will increase because finally, you will be able to know what to do with the money. Guilds or small groups of people who have a good idea and convince a community can easily raise investments, while the investor will be part of the project and will have the right to vote or receive rewards. Lawyers, teachers, bars and restaurants, there may be DAOs of towns. The corruption is over, the bureaucracy is over. With just a couple of clicks. It is really exciting the possibilities that there will be through this technology and remember, it is still very early.\",\"timestamp\":1640097849,\"title\":\"DAOs will change everything - \"},\"digest\":\"vu3HhwiQZK7bnKPJytym0neBbd54TFo3jupCyffVM5I\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xB4cA913E2b6EfB7cF3798b41cD68C72a5d1caC23\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eg0tjgCjYNUF--OG2AeiNCaKJk4HdUZQHgnPB-MjPcs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"GTUcFJ2EMCASyQQDodcBXcpDAXw9T_nUc9JvrSMFJoM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"nSTTMzAy2LxK_6XZV0NTmrnE2JxJyY9P6XJzftOgEM11Qh80-FFA9LWAknsmNGeAtu7Fe5aidMC3d2EqCwrzkQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa26ee0c7e584f09579d73aab9173412df4f3b8e6b83fc86b593944e90540be481be94177267e5ff12f2dab7389c0865d23768a33189bdc776720ab301893e8411b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eg0tjgCjYNUF--OG2AeiNCaKJk4HdUZQHgnPB-MjPcs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"GTUcFJ2EMCASyQQDodcBXcpDAXw9T_nUc9JvrSMFJoM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"vu3HhwiQZK7bnKPJytym0neBbd54TFo3jupCyffVM5I\"}"
