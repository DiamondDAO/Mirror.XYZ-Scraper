Following our [community raise](https://syndicate.mirror.xyz/_dIadEYTjam8Z8DGq2ezTBsYuf-bfSRoKFhNYZYJFk8), our Series A is the next major step in bringing our revolutionary protocol and platform for investing to people and communities all around the world.**\\n\\nWithin the next decade, investing will be decentralized, democratized, and community-driven. Syndicate is building the infrastructure to enable this at scale—we’re developing decentralized investing and social networking protocols, advanced legal tech solutions, and a next-gen social networking platform that empowers communities to raise, coordinate, and invest capital like never before. This will have a profound impact by expanding what gets funded and built in the world—by whom, for whom, and where. It’ll level the playing field, empower communities of builders, creatives, influencers, and friends to invest in new ideas and world-changing technologies, and introduce radical new models for investing to society that are fundamentally more open, free, and fair.\\n\\nTo realize this important yet complex mission, we’re partnering with values-aligned leaders who represent a diverse array of industries and communities as part of our Series A, including firms like Andreessen Horowitz and its Cultural Leadership Fund, IDEO CoLab Ventures, Variant, Electric Capital, CoinFund, Scalar Capital, Bill Ackman’s Table Management, Weekend Fund, Coinbase Ventures, Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary’s Sound Ventures, Kevin Durant’s Thirty Five Ventures, Aave, Protocol Labs, A Capital, Acrylic, Delphi INFINFT, True Ventures, Makena, Atelier Ventures (creator economy focused venture firm), the Council Fund (all women venture firm), entrepreneurs like Ryan Hoover (Founder of Product Hunt), Alexis Ohanian (Co-Founder of Reddit), Biz Stone (Co-Founder of Twitter), Cordozar Broadus (Snoop Dogg), and investors like Matthew Ball, Packy McCormick, Lenny Rachitsky, Scott Belsky, Alice Lloyd George, and over 100 more people and firms who each bring important capabilities, expertise, and networks to the project.\\n\\nThe funds from the round will be used to accelerate the development of our decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) powered technologies, integration with Web3 projects and fintech startups, and support of communities with the advanced legal and operational tools they need to succeed and grow long term.

If this inspires you, we hope you’ll join us and our growing community of mission-aligned users, partners, and friends to change investing for the better, for everyone.\\n\\n[Follow us on
