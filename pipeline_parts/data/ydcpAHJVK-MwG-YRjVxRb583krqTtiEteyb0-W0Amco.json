"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Shiba Inu has launched a beta version of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to give users more authority to decide on crypto projects and pairs on the ShibaSwap platform, [according to a blog post](https://blog.shibaswap.com/doggy-dao-is-here-woof-3/).\\n\\n* The Dogecoin rival will release Doggy Dao in a “stage-by-stage” metric and phased approach. The first phase called “DAO 1″ will be implemented within the next few days.\\n* The DAO 1 phase will focus on “providing immediate power to the community to decide which crypto projects and pairs on the ShibaSwap WOOF Pools will be, and how the $BONE rewards (Allocation Points) are to be distributed amongst them,” the team said.\\n* The Dao will use $tBONE for voting rights, which is a new staking contract, to lock $BONE for a longer period of time before voting begins.\\n* Once the first phase is complete, using community feedback, Shiba Inu will release a newer version, called “DAO 2,” to allow the community to make generic proposals for consideration or review by a “Multisig-Team, and Breeds,” according to the blog.\\n* Shiba Inu noted that to avoid possible whales controlling the voting process, “the guardians (6/9 wallet)” will have final say on whether a pair should be listed or not, to ensure no one is “truly gaming the system.”\\n* On Dec. 22, Shiba inu’s price spiked after whales added to existing positions, [with one wallet buying nearly $134 million of the token](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/22/shib-spikes-as-whales-add-to-existing-positions/).\",\"timestamp\":1641039641,\"title\":\"Shiba Inu Launches Beta Version of DAO to Give Users More Authority Over Crypto Projects\"},\"digest\":\"yVDzmW3wbpW9T-qsY2D1xLB1sKM8eJgemKE7nkl-kKE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xF02716289b2036d51283B9baEc327355F27381F9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GNibMA0o08-ydVQPpxLsYGAE4Kkwc4qFwaXVgi04em8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_A1Ni64-3uOrvNwqd8reCaZkDmxJ_dd_G-f7tvfjZg4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"zdyIWw4hDwYzhtZ-96XfbpojJWY3Rf6YMDIlNLGyNGWRDNgMvZsIKCV4aGw5PMGA0jIQkHVgqtHdIQSbi11w1w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xff51e626184936d60d298aea17194e58de08a6bf2ba5aed7410d7664e9cf58ec32c5afe1173d9c93020fdefb236d55d6a99c93499cd3b66c2b4211ade183f32b1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GNibMA0o08-ydVQPpxLsYGAE4Kkwc4qFwaXVgi04em8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_A1Ni64-3uOrvNwqd8reCaZkDmxJ_dd_G-f7tvfjZg4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"yVDzmW3wbpW9T-qsY2D1xLB1sKM8eJgemKE7nkl-kKE\"}"
