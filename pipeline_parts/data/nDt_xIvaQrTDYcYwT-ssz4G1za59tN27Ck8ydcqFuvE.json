"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"People often say that my father loves like a mountain, and my father is also like a mountain, a mountain with strange peaks.\\n\\nThe concrete manifestation of his point was when he took the mathematics exam. I missed the full score because of a wrong question, and was punished by the teacher for copying. On the way home, my father asked me what homework I had. I didn't know if it was intentional or unintentional, but I concealed the penalty assignment.\\n\\nDuring the meal, my mother glanced at the phone and asked in amazement: 'Nanny, why are you going to punish you?' In a flash, I immediately felt an eagle-like sharp gaze nailed to my body, making me speak I shivered unconsciously: 'Yes...Yes, I got a wrong question...' My voice gradually lowered, and my father's rage was replaced by my father's anger: 'Didn't you say that there is no other homework?' 'I forgot Now.' I lowered my head and slapped my food indiscriminately, using this delusion to cover up my inner panic. Unexpectedly, my father pulled aside the chair, forcing me to 'clash' with his eyes. I saw him resting his hands on his legs, leaning forward slightly, staring at me with enthusiasm. As if the next second, his anger would engulf me. 'Really forgot?' a dangerous question. 'Really forgot.' 'Pop!' Father couldn't restrain his anger anymore, his eyes widened, and even dyed a faint scarlet red. He pointed at me, trembling and angrily shouted: 'Get me out and stand on the balcony!'\\n\\nI felt aggrieved, but had to obey the order, so I moved to the balcony with my beating face, and immediately burst into tears. Father also came to the balcony. He took out a cigarette, lit it, stared at the noisy night scene, and smoked deeply. The smoke was so smoky that I couldn't see his face clearly, but his frowning brow seemed unusually clear.\\n\\nGradually, I stopped crying, and my father also put down the unknown cigarette in his hand. He leaned over and squatted, touched my hair, and wiped my tears with his large, callous hand. Then he lowered his throat and spoke slowly, 'I'm sorry, Dad just wanted you to understand that you shouldn't lie.' He paused, and then said, 'Remember? Once you also failed the exam and hid the test paper. , I lied to us that it was not posted, and the questions that caused the error have not been corrected, and the test still won’t. Don’t you also regret it? You have a shame to do yourself and stop at the best. Not only need to know, but also to do it... So, don't lie anymore, okay?'\\n\\nI nodded and plunged into my father's arms. I clearly remember that when my father said this, his eyes were full of concern and guilt for me.\\n\\nThe love of the father should be as broad as a mountain, and I say that the love of the father can also be as steep as a dangerous peak. This is also the love of the father.\",\"timestamp\":1639309259,\"title\":\" my father loves like a mountain\"},\"digest\":\"38QptSsJY-0lw8IECrMVe0nscOxbVnC289PiEDo2X2k\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x1d2e03051FD65228862F10f616B52609498D891f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"169t22eYRXaaHsH5lASZGrTqTCtK_2RnIg-qDtIfG8w\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"B3g336XGEDMbaSz9tiqg3uhOIQIHNBIMCDNoXcwniE8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"rS1BGsEg1ZHJbDT7u2lC6_27CV2bSustH3VQgycKam6EBLrMS20rxmcCcXOe2mugLjiM7mvuQlmigJYv-mHa6g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd45a9d91e6cd3fbbfccf3eca3186ddfdd8dd46aa94b573bf8304b23a128e53041b104d2d57c8e79207de72224cf4a192fee5d0b1f815d38062cfdb1a74f38f361c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"169t22eYRXaaHsH5lASZGrTqTCtK_2RnIg-qDtIfG8w\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"B3g336XGEDMbaSz9tiqg3uhOIQIHNBIMCDNoXcwniE8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"38QptSsJY-0lw8IECrMVe0nscOxbVnC289PiEDo2X2k\"}"
