For such goods, users cannot be barred from accessing or using them for failing to pay for them. Also, use by one person neither prevents access of other people nor does it reduce availability to others.[\\\\[1\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)#cite_note-Oakland-1) Therefore, the good can be used simultaneously by more than one person.[\\\\[2\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)#cite_note-2) This is in contrast to a [common good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good_(economics)), such as wild fish stocks in the ocean, which is non-excludable but rivalrous to a certain degree. If too many fish were harvested, the stocks would deplete, limiting the access of fish for others. A public good must be valuable to more than one user, otherwise, the fact that it can be used simultaneously by more than one person would be economically irrelevant.[\\\\[1\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)#cite_note-Oakland-1) Wikipedia is a good example of a public good.\\n\\n  [Capital goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_goods) may be used to produce public goods or services that are \\\"...typically provided on a large scale to many consumers.\\\"[\\\\[3\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)#cite_note-Tatom-3) Unlike other types of [economic goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_goods), public goods are described as “non-rivalrous” or “non-exclusive,” and use by one person neither prevents access of other people nor does it reduce availability to others.[\\\\[1\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)#cite_note-Oakland-1) Similarly, using capital goods to produce public goods may result in the creation of new capital goods. In some cases, public goods or services are considered \\\"...insufficiently profitable to be provided by the private sector.... (and), in the absence of government provision, these goods or services would be produced in relatively small quantities or, perhaps, not at all.\\\"[\\\\[3\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)#cite_note-Tatom-3)\\n\\n  Public goods include [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge),[\\\\[4\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)#cite_note-ReferenceA-4) [official statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_statistics), [national security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security), and [common languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_language).[\\\\[5\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)#cite_note-5) Additionally, [flood control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_control) systems, [lighthouses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse), and [street lighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_lights) are also common social goods. Collective goods that are spread all over the face of the earth may be referred to as [global public goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_public_good).[\\\\[6\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)#cite_note-cowen-6) For instance, knowledge is well shared globally. Information about [men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_health), [women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_health) and [youth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_health) health awareness, [environmental issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_issues), and maintaining [biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity) is common knowledge that every individual in the society can get without necessarily preventing others access. Also, sharing and interpreting [contemporary history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_history) with a cultural lexicon, particularly about protected [cultural heritage sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_heritage) and [monuments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monuments) are other sources of knowledge that the people can freely access.\\n\\n  Public goods problems are often closely related to the [\\\"free-rider\\\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_rider_problem) problem, in which people not paying for the good may continue to access it. Thus, the good may be under-produced, overused or degraded.[\\\\[7\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)#cite_note-7) Public goods may also become subject to restrictions on access and may then be considered to be [club goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_goods); exclusion mechanisms include [toll roads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll_roads), [congestion pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestion_pricing), and [pay television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_television) with an encoded signal that can be decrypted only by paid subscribers.\\n* So what will public good in crypto look like?\\n\\n  ```\\n  What do you think about a coin that is not affected by sharks and only increases in value by the number of users? It will be the nearest destination of public good. :)))\\n  ```\\n\\n  ```\\n  \\r\\n  Currently, clr.fund is the first project to raise capital and develop in this field and is supported by gitcoin 40k GTC with 8 rounds of crowdfunding. Indeed, the potential for growth is tremendous.\\n  ```\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9RN2Z3VB7Hp6cBCOgcwgJ.png?height=170&width=725)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1641434751,\"title\":\"\\nWhat is public good that gitcoin and the big guys talk about so much?
