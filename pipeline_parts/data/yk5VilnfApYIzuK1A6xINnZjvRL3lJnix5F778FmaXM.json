"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Getting out of the world you've always been in and being more exposed to the outside world can help a lot in understanding existing things. From fitness, I learned that the human body is a system as a whole, practicing only one part is like eating only one kind of dish for dinner, although it can satiate the stomach in the short term, but it is not good for the body in the long term. This reinforces a little of my previous perception of learning, I focused on learning in my four years of college, although with what seemed like a reasonable way of self-learning and independent thinking, I thought I had surpassed my peers, however, it was only recently that I really realized that I was too limited to learning itself, I used the skills of learning: practical, diligent, pre-study, review, take notes, do not understand questions, timely feedback, listen carefully in class, find outside of class information to supplement, and take every quiz seriously ...... I felt I was the most serious person in learning, as if I also used this as a reason to deceive myself that I loved learning, and this feeling of excellence was reinforced from people who played games all night: I was smart, and it was right to go on like this. I never thought about it, why should I study? For a better future? I'm sorry I don't have any concept of the future; I don't have any hope for my English major, and I don't have passion when I study, just to study, for a change of elegance, for knowledge. I have not paid attention to my own heart, the so-called \\\"serious\\\", \\\"good learning\\\", may be just to support others crowned by the xx hegemony, xx good serious ... The actual \\\"seriousness\\\" and \\\"good learning\\\" may be the only way to hold up the xx academic bully, xx good seriousness... and so on words - a touch of self-esteem.\\n\\nWhen the \\\"seriousness\\\" they once insisted on is built on top of the vain praise of others, out of the original environment, the corresponding change in life brings its own should bear the price. I found myself no longer so \\\"serious\\\", and even with those I used to despise every day all-night game people, love to sleep, the whole day scribble nothing, life is unusually decadent.\\n\\nI began to realize that life is a whole, and learning is a whole life act. My previous definition of learning was too superficial, thinking that learning well meant getting good grades and embarking on a good career path. After a few months at home, I realized that learning is everywhere, and I don't even need to stick to the word \\\"learning\\\". Life itself is a subtle art, and as the subject of the person slowly to touch it, know it, know how to thank others when they get help, know how to exercise properly to keep healthy ...... this process because of parents, family and friends and other people around the help, so most people do not realize that this is also a learning process, themselves The final performance of learning is to get something, this \\\"get\\\" can not be measured by achievements, can not be determined by the achievement of greatness, no matter The \\\"gain\\\" can't be measured in terms of achievement, and it can't be determined by achievement, no matter what you learn, through what way you learn, just be sure that eventually all the \\\"gain\\\" will be settled in the brain, and they will be integrated and become part of the knowledge base, when dealing with new things to call related content, to establish links, you can be more quickly familiar with it, better master it.\\n\\nSo learning is a whole, and to focus too much on the learning of the moment, which may be CFA, which may be math, which may be social skills...is to trap yourself in a well. Like fitness, to get truly healthy, it requires a balance of all aspects, not necessarily, unnecessarily, nor can it be all-inclusive; learning is a system, mentally, physically, the amount of insightful experience, depth of thought ....... All can be factors that affect the quality of a particular study.\\n\\nSo, embrace a colorful life, go out and see the world, not necessarily to travel, but to break away from the unchanging state of life, out of the circle where they have been, I believe that will bring more enlightenment to my current study.\",\"timestamp\":1634374917,\"title\":\"Learning\"},\"digest\":\"Xj-cVIzFQYbTV2UpOVNF3XmfL2LEHcNXQbHFqLlZRP0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x71213a9C9504E406d3242436A4bf69c6bfE74461\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cDh4EsNRM8B8ZnIKO5zIFo0g-V7mbXpI9coPM1dGvgk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"6ChVoybo9kX-_IxfHk1lLpAdkr0vmiYROKZvAx3cV6E\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Y1jJybQF4Fb89qN9gzEfT3SjMGJiWJm-kVsXUEy44R7f4ZLeCGaC2CqYR5K4GbMiUeL46vd1iUVg-udxY2h68g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf0431e21a9c905919dffdb801b62118a7cfda0d1abd6d0f4938f3864444c8f85323e7037edb5097b2371f1be06794c8f47646d14e5af5ab8314b08671cc9a6a21c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cDh4EsNRM8B8ZnIKO5zIFo0g-V7mbXpI9coPM1dGvgk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"6ChVoybo9kX-_IxfHk1lLpAdkr0vmiYROKZvAx3cV6E\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Xj-cVIzFQYbTV2UpOVNF3XmfL2LEHcNXQbHFqLlZRP0\"}"
