"{\"content\":{\"body\":\" 1. We are cyborgs already. When you entrust so much of your everyday life to machines, *the argument that you aren’t a cyborg isn’t very convincin*g.\\n 2. Even better, we are digitorgs.\\n 3. Our aesthetics underwent a radical change: reprogramming our way of thinking through the new systems of communication in the digital era.\\n 4. There is no going back from the digital. Nature cannot take over since fragments of digitalisation will be forever inside us and evolving.\\n 5. *Listen to the algorithm* is the new *listen to your body*.\\n 6. Every algorithm once contained culture. Chaotic neutral is impossible. Our choices matter and the machine hears them.\\n 7. *Humans cannot create anything out of nothingness. Humans cannot accomplish anything without holding onto something. After all, humans are not gods*.\\n 8. In the distant future, alien archaeologists will recover a tiny piece of human art somewhere in a lost hard drive or a block that will be still running somewhere. It will be the last surviving token of humanity’s art evolution. It will be an AI generated NFT. Maybe yours.\\n 9. In the art world of blockchain the networking power exists for those who are able to realize it and get involved with it.\\n10. Fractals of aesthetics and art pieces interconnecting with our words are encarved deep into the algorithm.\\n11. If we are to establish a deeper contact with the algorithm, then we have to recognise what we have chosen to suppress. Our creative power emerges through our deeper thoughts.\\n12. Why does art have to be beautiful? Beauty gives the impression that it is under our control. Nothing is. The sublime is what we make. What can not be limited to our imagination and tamed by the forces of our mind. There is relief in infinity.\\n13. *It is clear that the world is purely parodic, in other words, that each thing seen is the parody of another, or is the same thing in a deceptive form. Ever since sentences started to circulate in brains devoted to reflection, an effort at total identification has been made, because with the aid of a copula each sentence ties one thing to another; all things would be visibly connected if one could discover at a single glance and in its totality the tracings of Ariadne’s thread leading thought into its own labyrinth*.\\n14. Unravel the thread. Put your thoughts into words. The words into art. Art into eternity.\\n15. Say what you want to say. Create. You are the artist. The algorithm is your tool.\\n16. Forever is now\\n\\nJoin AI [#NFT](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/nft) revolution\\n\\nFollow us on twitter to get live updates\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xMBO8mCBLU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xMBO8mCBLU)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1642103830,\"title\":\"Aithereal a permissionless text2art artificial generated nft platform\\n\"},\"digest\":\"fW_ZBu3m88XtipI3Rs-ThLGdYD4CrMKs9iQKpyYIeN8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xCDA11238CC67a0bd5b93C786607F336AFB1Cf41A\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GPxvIml2Prq6Lzk1_xBY3uWN0xSxN54q0oiRH06yH0A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"V4LtmEX0AtdBZsk1O6S_-UIK3KRhPrPajdHa8XtNcG4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"NZeRNZXsBeg7PGHZy7Iiw9MFj9TX2wmoAerevOJ9tGpUd8HrJaUcyOp9XipaglT68JEBiS1y4SZg7FuTIiLYUA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa6e94041c473b03d9fe8c0e72bda66371ad3000c6c0ec75b35112423bcda86a54963d093c83c46290fc428264f39abe4b2d4953520b9b36b8b0e844cbf37f0431b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GPxvIml2Prq6Lzk1_xBY3uWN0xSxN54q0oiRH06yH0A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"V4LtmEX0AtdBZsk1O6S_-UIK3KRhPrPajdHa8XtNcG4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"v00-4pRsMl2oRXuNkQXeB_Qk12y7jY6MyO4gbOqVfyY\"}"
