"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## 🌱 Good Morning Everyone!\\n\\nIn just the first thirteen days of October, OpenSea has already done $1.4 Billion (USD) in sales, and the world of web3 has had an absolute unit of a year.\\n\\nWith things changing so fast and so much money and hype involved, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and FOMO into bad investments (been there 😞). Even if it seems to be trending on [icy.tools](https://icy.tools), and the Discord servers have over 10k people, projects can still be susceptible to failure.\\n\\nWhy? Success relies on the team and community behind the project. Projects can’t be successful unless the community is strong and contributes to the overall mission. The decentralized world is about value, and true long-term value can only be delivered when people are dedicated and contribute to a cause.\\n\\n## 😵‍💫 AKLSDFJK HOW TF DO I KEEP UP!?!?\\n\\nTheres A LOT going on, and it’s easy to get caught up in the whirlwind of things and get rugged (fake NFT projects where the team makes big promises, but never delivers and just dips with the 💶 ).\\n\\nThe FOMO for trending projects is high, but its important to keep a cool head and not full-send into projects based on OpenSea data or Twitter hype. Whales (NFT collectors with large amounts of capital) are whales for a reason – they can afford to make risky bets and offset their losses with massive gains from just one project. Their investment strategy can be more like a VC firm, but us folks with smaller amounts of capital and much higher risk need to **operate like an angel investor.**\\n\\nUltimately, there’s just a lot going on behind the scenes that we can’t control.\\n\\nProjects can spark gas wars (surge in gas prices from heavy traffic) and seem to hit all the “signs” of a bluechip (an established, stable investment) but can still fail at the end of the day.\\n\\n## 🧐 Why do projects fail?\\n\\nLack of community!\\n\\nNFT projects are not just jpegs - **they provide access to and fractional ownership of a community.** By buying an NFT, you are supporting that community’s initiatives and goals. You could say it’s like investing in an early-stage startup – you are investing in the team, not just the product at the time. Whatever the initial roadmap says is usually changed and **the product becomes built by the community** as folks contribute their ideas and perspectives.\\n\\nIt can feel like you’re missing out when projects are minted in minutes, but **CryptoPunks started in 2017** and their price went up over time as the value of the community increased.\\n\\nThe community’s goals don’t have to be crazy ambitious like building an online world, or gaining access to a media company, but can simply start as a safe space to make friends under a common interest (check out [Web3 Baddies](https://twitter.com/web3baddies)). However, the community should be contributing to their mission, and that takes time to build.\\n\\n## 🤨 Ok sick…so what should I do?\\n\\nBuy into a few projects you TRULY believe in and contribute to their success! In fact, you should believe in them so much that you WANT to contribute.\\n\\nEngage in a community movie night, or help an online fren with their resume! You don’t have to ship to the Github to support the project! Simply chatting with folks, sharing ideas and feedback, and just hanging out presents a world of opportunity and growth! The most impactful thing you can do to a project’s success is contribute.\\n\\n**Point is - invest in the people, personal utility, and contribute to the mission.**\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1448264057786601473?s=20](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1448264057786601473?s=20)\\n\\n## 😤 Alright, So WTF is This Series?\\n\\nI wanted to start writing to help combat some of the commotion and help identify some neat, ambitious projects. **Each week or so I want to write about one innovative project or community** by spending time with the folks building it to understand:\\n\\n* *What kind of project is it?*\\n* *What’s the mission?*\\n* *What are they building?*\\n* *Why does the community support it?*\\n* *What’s happening in the community?*\\n* *How can I get involved?*\\n\\nI hope that by compiling this information, I can help to cut through some of the chaos, and provide a more unbiased point of view.\\n\\nStarting the first one with [manny.game](https://mannys.game/), a browser based 3D NFT game integrating other NFT projects as mini games.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/mannynotfound?lang=en](https://twitter.com/mannynotfound?lang=en)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nThank you so much for reading!
