"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"For many many times, I deeply regreted that I sold my valuable tokens with the worst price. \\n\\nWhy would we buy them if we don’t want to hold them?\\n\\nFear and greed, that’s what it is.\\n\\nAs an individual, it’s hard to hold, but as a group, holding is much easer. Especially when “Never Sell” is the core of our community consensus.\\n\\n our Protocol.\\n\\nThat’s why we build HoldersDao.\\n\\nYou pay ETH to HolderDao’s VAULT, then you get $HOLD as a governance token to participate in community governance, inculding deciding what to buy with our VAULT fund.\\n\\nOur rule here is we only buy TOKENs, but never sell them.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nIf we don’t have this consensus that we only buy and hold, then there will be many challenges when some of the TOKENs we hold are generating 100x or even more profits to the community.\\n\\nIf we don’t sell, how can we cash out the profit for the community?\\n\\nOK, let’s say, in our HoldersDao’s first experiment period, we don’t sell any TOKEN we bought. Only when the inVAULT valuation is higher enough, far more than our $HOLD valuation, that means our inVAULT net value is far more than our $HOLD price, then our community will have the incentive to propose a DISSOLUTION of the DAO, that means start the LIQUIDATION process.\\n\\nDuring the Liquidation process, every $HOLD token holder can claim a relative portion of TOKENs from our VAULT, and that amount of tokens claimed from the VAULT would value more than the value of $HOLD tokens in their wallet.\\n\\nIf an arbitrager noticed this scenario, then they will buy $HOLD tokens and claim for more valuable TOKENs from the VAULT, this will cause $HOLD price goes up, even closer or higher than $HOLD net value.\\n\\nThen, Dissolution and Liquidation no longer be a MUST.\\n\\nThat’s how $HOLD works.\\n\\nTo make this happen, we need more talents, need more contributors, need more patience.\\n\\nAre you going tobe a $HOLDer?\",\"timestamp\":1638259725,\"title\":\"Why HoldersDao\"},\"digest\":\"LEdotBrILCki0ueXq_MzYH31AV-saTbUpWSlFD3v_I8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4729B4A69042c3696FC26F0D0f405451f2D00800\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_g8vcX2Ag_-8P2_UBVrrkgPvwxvRPS52nojX7wHFO68\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"tgGktW-w5IwU0QFB5comE4jBnjWwNkI7JZVWBw5m9TE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"z93TwgDjTxNnfWDi70G32d_L8XzpskpPn3oQdPu5FMhmWNka2CcPTspE-1sCL7M4P9JPDClEBUYUmJBymTuuiw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2bd9fcea8f7d7fdfaa965863d899df29949bb6114ef14e9846e37ae5e2af07403af4215abc77616a64c79b0acda22542de72fc6b64f3fbceb036578464dbf2831c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_g8vcX2Ag_-8P2_UBVrrkgPvwxvRPS52nojX7wHFO68\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"tgGktW-w5IwU0QFB5comE4jBnjWwNkI7JZVWBw5m9TE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"LEdotBrILCki0ueXq_MzYH31AV-saTbUpWSlFD3v_I8\"}"
