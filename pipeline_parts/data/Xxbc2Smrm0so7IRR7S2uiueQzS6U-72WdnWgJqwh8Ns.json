"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Then, finally, the rock began to give slow way. A roar came from the Freshmen and they hurled themselves in a frenzy upon their betters.\\n\\nTo be under the gaze of the juniors and Seniors is to be in sight of all men, and so the Sophomores at this important moment laboured with the desperation of the half- doomed to stem the terrible Freshmen.\\n\\nIn the kind of game, it was the time when bad tempers came strongly to the front, and in many Sophomores' minds a thought arose of the incomparable insolence of the Freshmen. A blow was struck; an infuriated Sophomore had swung an arm high and smote a Freshman.\\n\\nAlthough it had seemed that no greater noise could be made by the given numbers, the din that succeeded this manifestation surpassed everything. The juniors and Seniors immediately set up an angry howl. These veteran classes projected themselves into the middle of the fight, buffeting everybody with small thought as to merit. This method of bringing peace was as militant as a landslide, but they had much trouble before they could separate the central clump of antagonists into its parts. A score of Freshmen had cried out: \\\"It was Coke. Coke punched him. Coke.\\\" A dozen of them were tempestuously endeavouring to register their protest against fisticuffs by means of an introduction of more fisticuffs.\\n\\nThe upper classmen were swift, harsh and hard. \\\"Come, now, Freshies, quit it. Get back, get back, d'y'hear?\\\" With a wrench of muscles they forced themselves in front of Coke, who was being blindly defended by his classmates from intensely earnest  attacks by outraged Freshmen.\\n\\nThese meetings between the lower classes at the door of a recitation room were accounted quite comfortable and idle affairs, and a blow delivered openly and in hatred fractured a sharply defined rule of conduct. The corridor was in a hubbub. Many Seniors and Juniors, bursting from old and iron discipline, wildly clamoured that some Freshman should be given the privilege of a single encounter with Coke. The Freshmen themselves were frantic. They besieged the tight and dauntless circle of men that encompassed Coke. None dared confront the Seniors openly, but by headlong rushes at auspicious moments they tried to come to quarters with the rings of dark-browed Sophomores. It was no longer a festival, a game; it was a riot. Coke, wild-eyed, pallid with fury, a ribbon of blood on his chin, swayed in the middle of the mob of his classmates, comrades who waived the ethics of the blow under the circumstance of being obliged as a corps to stand against the scorn of the whole college, as well as against the tremendous assaults of the Freshmen. Shamed by their own man, but knowing full well the right time and the wrong time for a palaver of regret and disavowal, this battalion struggled in the desperation of despair. Once they were upon the verge of making unholy campaign against the interfering Seniors. This fiery  impertinence was the measure of their state.\\n\\nIt was a critical moment in the play of the college. Four or five defeats from the Sophomores during the fall had taught the Freshmen much. They had learned the comparative measurements, and they knew now that their prowess was ripe to enable them to amply revenge what was, according to their standards, an execrable deed by a man who had not the virtue to play the rough game, but was obliged to resort to uncommon methods. In short, the Freshmen were almost out of control, and the Sophomores debased but defiant, were quite out of control. The Senior and junior classes which, in American colleges dictate in these affrays, found their dignity toppling, and in consequence there was a sudden oncome of the entire force of upper classmen football players naturally in advance. All distinctions were dissolved at once in a general fracas. The stiff and still Gothic windows surveyed a scene of dire carnage.\\n\\nSuddenly a voice rang brazenly through the tumult. It was not loud, but it was different. \\\" Gentlemen! Gentlemen!'\\\" Instantly there was a remarkable number of haltings, abrupt replacements, quick changes. Prof. Wainwright stood at the door of his recitation room, looking into the eyes of each member of the mob of three hundred. \\\"Ssh! \\\" said the mob. \\\" Ssh! Quit! Stop! It's the Embassador! Stop!\\\" He had once  been minister to Austro-Hungary, and forever now to the students of the college his name was Embassador. He stepped into the corridor, and they cleared for him a little respectful zone of floor. He looked about him coldly. \\\" It seems quite a general dishevelment. The Sophomores display an energy in the halls which I do not detect in the class room.\\\" A feeble murmur of appreciation arose from the outskirts of the throng. While he had been speaking several remote groups of battling men had been violently signaled and suppressed by other students. The professor gazed into terraces of faces that were still inflamed. \\\" I needn't say that I am surprised,\\\" he remarked in the accepted rhetoric of his kind. He added musingly: \\\" There seems to be a great deal of torn linen. Who is the young gentleman with blood on his chin?\\\"\\n\\nThe throng moved restlessly. A manful silence, such as might be in the tombs of stern and honourable knights, fell upon the shadowed corridor. The subdued rustling had fainted to nothing. Then out of the crowd Coke, pale and desperate, delivered himself.\\n\\n\\\" Oh, Mr. Coke,\\\" said the professor, \\\"I would be glad if you would tell the gentlemen they may retire to their dormitories.\\\" He waited while the students passed out to the campus.\\n\\nThe professor returned to his room for some books, and then began his own march across the snowy campus. The wind twisted his coat-tails fantastically, and he was obliged to keep one hand firmly on the top of his hat. When he arrived home he met his wife in the hall. \\\" Look here, Mary,\\\" he cried. She followed him into the library. \\\" Look here,\\\" he said. \\\"What is this all about? Marjory tells me she wants to marry Rufus Coleman.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Wainwright was a fat woman who was said to pride herself upon being very wise and if necessary, sly. In addition she laughed continually in an inexplicably personal way, which apparently made everybody who heard her feel offended. Mrs. Wainwright laughed.\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said the professor, bristling, \\\" what do you mean by that ? \\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Harris,\\\" she replied. \\\" Oh, Harris.\\\"\\n\\n[ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/22](ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/22)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638785691,\"title\":\"\\nCharge after charge of Freshmen beat upon the now compact and organised Sophomore\"},\"digest\":\"RqglnGqH5KQ265S6r0QOmB4bUnDrraLyYMXKb7bMK4g\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x81227527cbBb507F7E0b85be26187C02C5D953E3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"5qInmCjKsBKxXiR2Fgfc4KDzIvg5ECLJ9ksRiOER2IA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Pcef05UaUsRKzFaaHuJVhg0QFKqxMl5imTLrLG-50pU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"5ChdxNDn9f6aJHMZJjwh64e7tNDxVVrDYXtqOc5Dmgf4VdzWchbbHnjJPnqxnpZk0JWagepiYJj-DkJ8scrhNw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x623880ee1509980e762d617efd82a57aa6de4e7a47365a925b48d3f0670881c26f39d69ab2e83b34c26116d670a894efa45095ca8f4de3dd7f831615a39069111c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"5qInmCjKsBKxXiR2Fgfc4KDzIvg5ECLJ9ksRiOER2IA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Pcef05UaUsRKzFaaHuJVhg0QFKqxMl5imTLrLG-50pU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"RqglnGqH5KQ265S6r0QOmB4bUnDrraLyYMXKb7bMK4g\"}"
