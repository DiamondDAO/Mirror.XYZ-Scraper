"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"which the most rigid exactness in size as well as form could be given to these hexagonal nuts.  He readily granted his permission.  I constructed a special apparatus, consisting of a hard steel circular cutter to act as a circular file. When brought into operation in the production of these minute six-sided collared nuts, held firm in the spindle of a small dividing plate and attached to the slide-rest, each side was brought in succession under the action of the circular file or cutter with the most exact precision in regard to the division of the six sides.  The result was absolutely perfect as respects the exactness of the six equal sides of the hexagonal nut, as well as their precise position in regard to the collar that was of one solid piece with it.  There was no great amount of ingenuity required in contriving this special tool, or in adapting it to the slide-rest of the lathe, to whose spindle end the file or cutter /\\\\\\\\ was fixed. But the result was so satisfactory, both as regards the accuracy and rapidity of execution in comparison with the usual process of hand filing, that Mr. Maudslay was greatly pleased with the arrangement as well as with my zeal in contriving and executing this clever little tool.  An enlarged edition of this collar-nut cutting machine was soon after introduced into the factory.\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  Arrangement of the machine\\n\\nIt was one of the specialities that I adopted in my own workshop when I commenced business for myself, and it was eagerly adopted by mechanical engineers, whom we abundantly supplied with this special machine. It was an inestimable advantage to me to be so intimately associated with this Great Mechanic.  He was so invariably kind, pleasant, and congenial.  He communicated an infinite number of what he humorously called \\\"Wrinkles\\\" which afterwards proved of great use to me. My working hours usually terminated at six in the evening.  But as many of the departments of the factory were often in full operation during busy times until eight o'clock, I went through them to observe the work while in progress.  On these occasions I often met \\\"the guvnor, as the workmen called Mr. Maudslay.  He was going his round of inspection, and when there was any special work in hand he would call me up to him to and explain point in connection with it that was worthy of particular notice.  I found this valuable privilege most instructive, as I obtained from the cheif mechanic himself a full insight into the methods, means, and processes by which the skilful workman advanced the various classes of work.  I was also permitted to take notes and make rapid sketches of any object that specially interested me. The entire establishment thus became to me a school of practical engineering of the most instructive kind.\\n\\nMr. Maudslay took pleasure in showing me the right system and method of treating all manner of materials employed in mechanical structures. He showed how they might be made to obey your will, by changing them into the desired forms with the least expenditure of time and labour. This in fact is the true philosophy of construction. When clear ideas have been acquired upon the subject, after careful observation and practice, the comparative ease and certainty with which complete mastery over the most obdurate materials is obtained, opens up the most direct road to the attainment of commercial as well as of professional success.\\n\\nTo be permitted to stand by and observe the systematic way in which Mr. Maudslay would first mark or line out his work, and the masterly manner in which he would deal with his materials, and cause them to assume the desired forms, was a treat beyond all expression. Every stroke of the hammer, chisel, or file, told as an effective step towards the intended result.  It was a never-to-be-forgotten practical lesson in workmanship, in the most exalted sense of the term. In conformity with his often repeated maxim, \\\"that there is a right way and a wrong way of doing everything,\\\" he took the shortest and most direct cuts to accomplish his objects.  He illustrated this by telling me, in his own humorous style, \\\" When you want to go from London to Greenwich, don't go round by Inverness.\\\"  Another of his droll sayings was that he \\\"considered no man a thorough mechanic unless he could cut a plank with a gimlet, and bore a hole with a saw!\\\"\\n\\nThe grand result of thoughtful practice is what we call experience: it is the power or faculty of seeing clearly before you begin, what to avoid and what to select--or rather what to do and what not to do. High-class workmanship, or technical knowledge, was in his hands quite a science.  Every piece of work was made subject to the soundest philosophical principles, as applied to the use and treatment of materials.  It was this that gave such a charm of enjoyment to his dealing with tools and materials.  He loved this sort of work for its own sake, far more than for its pecuniary results.  At the same time he was not without regard for the substantial evidence of his supremacy in all that regarded first-class tools, admirable management, and thorough organisation of his factory.\\n\\nThe innate love of truth and accuracy which distinguished Mr. Maudslay, led him to value highly that class of technical dexterity in engineering workmen which enabled them to produce those details of mechanical structures in which perfect flat or true plane surfaces were required.  This was an essential condition for the effective and durable performance of their functions.  Sometimes this was effected by the aid of the turning-lathe and slide-rest.  But in most cases the object was attained by the dexterous use of the file, so that \\\"flat filing\\\" then was, as it still is, one of the highest qualities of the skilled workman.  No one that I ever met with could go beyond Henry Maudslay himself in his dexterous use of the file.  By a few masterly strokes he could produce plane surfaces so true that when their accuracy was tested by a standard plane surface of absolute truth, they were never found defective; neither convex, nor concave, nor \\\"cross-winding,\\\"--that is, twisted.\\n\\nThe importance of having such Standard Planes caused him to have many of them placed on the benches beside his workmen, by means of which they might at once conveniently test their work.  Three of each were made at a time, so that by the mutual rubbing of each on each the projecting surfaces were effaced.  When the surfaces approached very near to the true plane, the still projecting minute points were carefully reduced by hard steel scrapers, until at last the standard plane surface was secured.  When placed over each other they would float upon the thin stratum of air between them until dislodged by time and pressure.  When they adhered closely to each other, they could only be separated by sliding each off each.  This art of producing absolutely plane surfaces is, I believe, a very old mechanical \\\"dodge.\\\" But, as employed by Maudslay's men, it greatly contributed to the improvement of the work turned out.  It was used for the surfaces of slide valves, or wherever absolute true plane surfaces were essential to the attainment of the best results, not only in the machinery turned out, but in educating the taste of his men towards first-class workmanship.\\n\\nMaudslay's love of accuracy also led him to distrust the verdicts given by the employment of the ordinary callipers and compasses in determining the absolute or relative dimensions of the refined mechanism which he delighted to construct with his own hands. So much depended upon the manner in which the ordinary measuring instruments were handled and applied that they sometimes failed to give the required verdict as to accuracy.  In order, therefore, to get rid of all difficulties in this respect, he designed and constructed a very compact and handy instrument which he always had on his bench beside his vice.  He could thus, in a most accurate and rapid manner, obtain the most reliable evidence as to the relative dimensions, in length, width, or diameter, of any work which he had in hand.  In consequence of the absolute truth of the verdicts of the instrument, he considered it as a Court of Final Appeal, and humorously called it \\\"The Lord Chancellor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  Maudslay's \\\"Lord Chancellor\\\"\\n\\nThis trustworthy \\\"Companion of the Bench\\\" consisted of a very substantial and inflexible bed or base of hard brass.  At one end of it was a perfectly hardened steel surface plate, having an absolutely true flat or plane face, against which one end or side of the object to be measured was placed; whilst a similar absolutely true plane surface of hardened steel was advanced by means of a suitable fine thread screw, until the object to be measured was just delicately in contact with it. The object was, as it were, between the jaws of a vice, but without any squeeze--being just free, which could be easily ascertained by feeling.  These two absolutely plane surfaces, between which the object lay, had their distances apart easily read off from the scale engraved on the bed of the instrument, in inches and tenth parts of an inch, while the disk-head or handle of the screw was divided on its edge rim into hundredth or thousandth parts, as these bore an exact metrical relation to the pitch of the screw that moved the parallel steel faces of the measuring vice (as I may term it) nearer or farther apart.\\n\\nNot only absolute measure could be obtained by this means, but also the amount of minute differences could be ascertained with a degree of exactness that went quite beyond all the requirements of engineering mechanism; such, for instance, as the thousandth part of an inch! It might also have been divided so far as a millionth part of an inch, but these infinitesimal fractions have really nothing to do with the effective machinery\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... I may mention another saying of Mr. Maudslay's.  Besides his observation that \\\"in going from London to Greenwich we must not go round by Inverness,\\\" he said, \\\"We must not become too complicated with our machinery.  Remember the get-at-ability of parts.  If we go on as some mechanics are doing, we shall soon be boiling our eggs with a chronometer!\\\"  ...\\\\] that comes forth from our workshops, and merely show the mastery we possess over materials and mechanical forms.  The original of this measuring machine of Maudslay's was exhibited at the Loan Collection at South Kensington in 1878.  It is now treasured up, with other relics of his handiwork, in a cabinet at the Lambeth works.  While writing upon this subject it may be worthy of remark, that the employment of a screw as the means of adjusting the points or reference marks of a measuring instrument, for the ascertainment of minute distances between objects, was first effected by William Gascoigne, about the year 1648. There can be no doubt that he was the inventor of the Micrometer--an instrument that, when applied (as he first did so) to the eye-piece of the Telescope, has been the means of advancing the science of astronomy to its present high position (See Grant's History of Astronomy, p. 453)\\n\\nI had abundant occupation for my leisure time after my regular attendance at the factory was over.  I had not only the opportunity of studying mechanics, but of studying men.  It is a great thing to know the character of those who are over you as well as those who are under you.  It is also well to know the character of those who are associated with you in your daily work.  I became intimate with the foremen and with many of the skilled workmen.  From them I learnt a great deal. Let me first speak of the men of science who occasionally frequented Maudslay's private workshop.  They often came to consult him on subjects with which he was specially acquainted.\\n\\nAmong Mr. Maudslay's most frequent visitors were General Sir Samuel Bentham, Mr. Barton, director of the Royal Mint, Mr. Bryan Donkin, Mr. Faraday, and Mr. Chantrey, the sculptor.  As Mr. Maudslay wished me to be at hand to give him any necessary assistance, I had the opportunity of listening to the conversation between him and these distinguished visitors.  Sir Samuel Bentham called very often. He had been associated with Maudslay during the contrivance and construction of the block machinery.  He was brother of the celebrated Jeremy Bentham, and he applied the same clear common-sense to mechanical subjects which the other had done to legal, social, and political questions.  It was in the highest degree interesting and instructive to hear these two great pioneers in the history and application of mechanics discussing the events connected with the block-making machinery.  In fact, Maudslay's connection with the subject had led to the development of most of our modern engineering tools.  They may since have been somewhat altered in arrangement, but not in principle.  Scarcely a week passed without a visit from the General. He sat in the beautiful workshop, where he always seemed so happy.  It was a great treat to hear him and Maudslay \\\"fight their battles o'er again,\\\" in recounting the difficulties, both official and mechanical, over which they had so gloriously triumphed.\\n\\nAt the time when I listened to their conversation, the great work in hand was the organisation of a systematic series of experiments on the hulls of steamships, with the view of determining the laws of resistance on their being propelled through the sea by a power other than those of winds and sails.  The subject was as complex as it was interesting and important.  But it had to be put to the test of actual experiment.  This was done in the first place by large models of hulls, so as to ascertain at what point the curves of least resistance could be applied.  Their practical correctness was tested by careful experiment in passing them through water at various velocities, to record which conditions special instruments were contrived and executed.  These, as well as the preparation of large models of hulls, embodying the various improved \\\"lines,\\\" occupied a considerable portion of the time that I had the good fortune to spend in Mr. Maudslay's private workshop.\\n\\nMr. Barton of the Royal Mint was quite a \\\"crony\\\" of Maudslay's. He called upon him often with respect to the improvements for stamping the current coin of the realm.  Bryan Donkin was also associated with Maudslay and Barton on the subject of the national standard of the yard measure.  But perhaps Mr. Chantrey was the most attractive visitor at the private workshop.  He had many a long interview with Maudslay with respect to the planning and arranging of a small foundry at his studio, by means of which he might cast his bronze statues under his own superintendence.  Mr. Maudslay entered con amore into the subject, and placed his skill and experience entirely at Chantrey's service. He constructed the requisite furnaces, cranes, and other apparatus, at Chantrey's studio; and it may be enough to state that, when brought into operation, they yielded the most satisfactory results.\\n\\nAmong my most intelligent private friends in London were George Cundell and his two brothers.  They resided near my lodgings, and I often visited them on Saturday evenings.  They were most kind, gentle, and genial.  The eldest brother was in Sir William Forbes's bank. George was agent for Mr. Patrick Maxwell Stuart in connection with his West India estates, and the third brother was his assistant. The elder brother was an admirable performer on the violoncello, and he treated us during these Saturday evenings with noble music from Beethoven and Mozart.  My special friend George was known amongst us as \\\"the worthy master.\\\"  He was thoroughly versed in general science, and was moreover a keen politician.  He had the most happy faculty of treating complex subjects, both in science and politics, in a thoroughly common-sense manner.  His two brothers had a fine feeling for art, and, indeed, possessed no small skill as practical artists. With companions such as these, gifted with a variety of tastes, I spent many of my Saturday evenings most pleasantly and profitably. They were generally concluded with a glass of beer of \\\"the worthy master's\\\" own brewing.\\n\\nWhen the season of the year and the state of the weather were suitable I often joined this happy fraternity in long and delightful Sunday walks to various interesting places round London.  Our walks included Waltham Abbey, Waltham Cross, Eltham Palace, Hampton Court, Epping Forest, and many other interesting places of resort.  When the weather was unfavourable my principal resort was Westminster Abbey, where, besides the beautifully-conducted service and the noble anthems, I could admire the glory of the architecture, and the venerable tombs, under which lay the best and bravest.  I used generally to sit at a point from which I could see the grand tomb of Aylmer de Vallance with its magnificent surroundings of quaint and glorious architecture. It was solemn, and serious also, to think of the many generations who had filled the abbey, and of the numbers of the dead who lay beneath our feet.\\n\\nI was so great an admirer of Norman and Gothic architecture that there was scarcely a specimen of it in London which I did not frequently visit.  One of the most interesting examples I found in the Norman portion of St. Saviours Church, near London Bridge, through some of it has since been destroyed by the so-called \\\"restoration\\\" in 1831. The new work has been executed in the worst taste and feeling. I also greatly admired the Norman chapel of the Tower, and some Norman portions of the Church of St. Bartholomew the Less, near Smithfield.\\n\\nNo style of architecture that I have ever seen has so impressed me with its intrinsic gravity, and I may say solemnity, as that of the Norman. There is a serious earnestness in its grave simplicity that has a peculiar influence upon the mind; and I have little doubt that this was felt, and understood by those true architects who designed and built the noble cathedrals at Durham and elsewhere.  But there, as elsewhere, some of our modern so-called \\\"Architects\\\" have made sad havoc with the earliest and most impressive portions of those grand and truly interesting remains, by their \\\"Restorations\\\", as they term it--but which I call Defamations.\\n\\nCHAPTER 9.  Holiday in the Manufacturing Districts.\\n\\nIn the autumn of 1830 Mr. Maudslay went to Berlin for the purpose of superintending the erection of machinery at the Royal Mint there. He intended to be absent from London for about a month; and he kindly permitted me to take my holiday during that period.\\n\\nI had been greatly interested by the descriptions in the newspapers of the locomotive competition at Rainhill, near Liverpool.  I was, therefore, exceedingly anxious to see Stephenson's \\\"Rocket,\\\" the engine that had won the prize.  Taking with me letters of introduction from Mr. Maudslay to persons of influence at Liverpool, I left London for the north on the afternoon of Saturday the 9th of September 1830. I took my place on the outside of the Liverpool coach, which set out from \\\"The Swan with Two Necks,\\\" in Lad Lane, City, one of the most celebrated coach-offices in those days\\n\\nThe first part of the journey to Liverpool was very dismal. The night was wet.  The rain came pouring down, and no sort of wrappings could keep it out.  The outside passengers became thoroughly soaked.  On we went, however, as fast as four horses could carry us. Next morning we reached Coventry, when the clouds cleared away, and the sun at last burst forth.  I could now enjoy this charming part of old England. Although I had only a hasty glimpse in passing of the quaint streets and ancient buildings of the town I was perfectly delighted with the specimens of ancient domestic architecture which I saw.  At that time Coventry was quite a museum of that interesting class of buildings. The greater part of them have since been swept away in the so-called improvement of modern builders, none of whose works can ever so attract an artistic eye.\\n\\nDuring the rest of the day the journey was delightful.  Though the inside passengers had had the best of it during the night, the outside passengers had the best of it now.  To go scampering across the country on the top of the coach, passing old villages, gentlemen's parks, under old trees, along hedges tinged with autumn tints, up hill and down dale, sometimes getting off the coach to lighten the load, and walking along through the fields by a short cut to meet it farther on; all this was most enjoyable.  It gave me a new interest in the happier aspects of English scenery, and of rural and domestic life in the pretty old-fashioned farm buildings that we passed on our way.  Indeed, there was everything to delight the eye of the lover of the picturesque during the course of that bright autumnal day.\\n\\nThe coach reached Liverpool on Sunday night.  I took up my quarters at a commercial inn in Dale Street, where I found every comfort which I desired at moderate charges.  Next morning, without loss of time, I made my way to the then terminus of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway; and there, for the first time, I saw the famous \\\"Rocket\\\" The interest with which I beheld this distinguished and celebrated engine was much enhanced by seeing it make several short trial trips under the personal management of George Stephenson, who acted as engineman, while his son Robert acted as stoker.  During their trips of four or five miles along the line the \\\"Rocket\\\" attained the speed of thirty miles an hour--a speed then thought almost incredible!  It was to me a most memorable and interesting sight, especially to see the father and son so appropriately engaged in working the engine that was to effect so great a change in the communications of the civilised world.  I spent the entire day in watching the trial trips, in examining the railway works, and such portions of of their details as I could obtain access to.  About mid-day the \\\"Rocket\\\" was at rest for about an hour near where I stood; and I eagerly availed myself of the opportunity of making a careful sketch of the engine, which I still preserve.\\n\\nThe line was opened on the 15th of September, when the famous \\\"Rocket\\\" led the way in conducting the first train of passengers from Liverpool to Manchester.  There were present on that occasion thousands of spectators, many of whom had come from distant parts of the kingdom to witness this greatest of all events in the history of railway locomotion.\\n\\nDuring my stay in Liverpool I visited the vast range of magnificent docks which extend along the north bank of the Mersey, all of which were crowded with noble merchant ships, some taking in cargoes of British manufactures, and others discharging immense stores of cotton, sugar, tobacco, and foreign produce.  The sight was most interesting, and gave me an impressive idea of the mighty functions of a manufacturing nation--energy and intelligence, working through machinery, increasing the value of raw materials and enabling them to be transported for use to all parts of the civilised world.\\n\\nMr. Maudslay having given me a letter of introduction to his old friend William Fawcett, head of the firm of Fawcett, Preston, and Company, engineers, I went over their factory.  They were engaged in producing sugar mills for the West Indies, and also in manufacturing the steam-engines for working them.  The firm had acquired great reputation for their workmanship; and their shops were crowded with excellent specimens of their skill.  Everything was in good order; their assortment of machine tools was admirable.  Mr. Fawcett, who accompanied me, was full in his praises of my master, whom he regarded as the greatest pioneer in the substitution of the unerring accuracy of machine tools for the often untrustworthy results of mere manual labour.\\n\\nI cannot resist referring to the personal appearance and manner of this excellent gentleman, William Fawcett.  His peculiar courteous manner, both in speech and action, reminded me of the \\\"grand old Style\\\" Which I had observed in some of my father's oldest noble employers, and the representations given of them by some of our best actors. There was also a dignified kindliness about his manner that was quite peculiar to himself; and when he conducted me through his busy workshops, the courtly yet kindly manner in which he addressed his various foremen and others, was especially cheering.  When I first presented my letter of introduction from Henry Maudslay, he was sitting at a beautiful inlaid escritoire table with his letters arrayed before him in the most neat and perfect order.  The writing table stood on a small Turkey carpet apart from the clerks' desks in the room, but so near to them that he could readily communicate with them.  His neat old-fashioned style of dress quite harmonised with his advanced age, and the kindly yet dignified grace of his manner left a lasting impression on me as a most interesting specimen of \\\"the fine old English gentleman, quite of the olden time.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1639289292,\"title\":\"\\nTo get rid of the difficulty I suggested to Mr. Maudslay a contrivance of my own by means\"},\"digest\":\"ZFp55C7PThhgc7DvCBrLcC86DnM0UpjXYv9VCbM4D4Y\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6961235d2e95818F7a1E230634bC24de80Bd6f6a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"r0OpLc05F0QgcoEnjQZGcjPPbBEnMDwvFPBI_haQaKk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"LPt1G88EK1MAvPQYAKn-LUmJVNNdj9q3A8Lb540Wvp4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Hv9uuEuN9Kt7lfE6fI3AabPl8dJScayP8D-gBDXiKzQB2sB-_2RAXelny2XhBB-PDxoSqQoZWfACEdl2f6cmkQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xec6a9580f0dd34d70f2cecce687469ceda7bb4cac98c63a5e9975c303f2f1674744cbabcc207fbe4383bd2dc02f4ca7ef47a8e1ce3638f613c3375f0a51db9be1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"r0OpLc05F0QgcoEnjQZGcjPPbBEnMDwvFPBI_haQaKk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"LPt1G88EK1MAvPQYAKn-LUmJVNNdj9q3A8Lb540Wvp4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ZFp55C7PThhgc7DvCBrLcC86DnM0UpjXYv9VCbM4D4Y\"}"
