"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"In 2005, blogger Kyle MacDonald started with a paperclip and traded it for a pen, the first in an incredible series of trades that ended with him trading for a house. Items he traded for along the way include a hand-sculpted doorknob, a snowmobile, a year’s rent in Phoenix, and an afternoon with musician Alice Cooper.\\n\\nIt’s an amazing story and even an archetypal one---an old Buddhist folk tale tells of a man who traded from a single piece of straw until he had a rice field. The Legend of Zelda’s “trade up” quests took inspiration from this classic story, as have others.\\n\\n**With the incredible diversity of NFTs available today a similarly magical tale is possible. So let’s create it.** Come trade with us and let’s tell the story of some amazing NFTs along the way.  \\n\\n![](https://s.mirror.xyz/\\\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fa58d4f4c-47bd-41e8-b48d-c6fce513b9be.jpeg\\\\&w=3840\\\\&q=90)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\\n\\n**Today we are offering up our first trade which is, naturally, a paperclip.** More specifically it’s a “$Paper/$Clip” NFT for a *redeemed* Uniswap position. You can see it [here](https://opensea.io/assets/0xc36442b4a4522e871399cd717abdd847ab11fe88/103126).\\n\\nHere's how to trade with us:\\n\\n1.  Check our twitter [@paperclipDAO](https://twitter.com/paperclipDAO) for the pinned tweet telling you what NFT we're offering for trade.\\n2.  Create an offer on [Sudoswap](https://sudoswap.xyz/) to exchange your NFT for our NFT. Sudoswap will generate a trade link.\\n3.  Tweet your trade link at [@paperclipDAO](https://twitter.com/paperclipDAO), proposing the trade. $CLIP holders will then vote on whether or not to accept your trade.\\n4.  If yes, we swap!\\n\\n**So about those $CLIP tokens...** anyone who successfully trades with us gets $CLIP tokens so they can join the DAO and continue to create the story. The first to trade with us will get the most $CLIP, and as the story becomes richer and the NFTs more innately valuable the amount of $CLIP given will decline (in an interesting way perhaps…)\\n\\nWhere will this journey end? We think it might be cool to rescue an unobtainable NFT, maybe one from another dimension, and make it available to the community. But only time will tell.\\n\\nLet’s start swapping and find out.\\n\\nTo keep up with this adventure, [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/6JbGUMDkMp) and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/paperclipDAO).\\n\",\"timestamp\":1629839204,\"title\":\"For Trade: One $PAPER/$CLIP — Mirror\",\"publication\":\"clip\"},\"digest\":\"mOCENLvP1aYXOBOPiLoLjBlSTvJWBqccfkn4gTPJ8qM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xdD2DB8E99E49a6aAae2BBa9A50c2FDbaadB60FE5\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FWIfH_2BkmWesIzfo1uBKkfvBYH7OFR-eaeA_2mEJ_E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"nzlTXDLrvz5BiyPYf9M4w_RKlThIHVwgM_7FIa9uZ_I\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Ae37KBSJB4_EfOKUwR_9KbaQfeT5irYeb3qaIaAqPMKXv1jbG0-aJnOZLML7MbXwl47dbN8PM1lvrBdfgTeFHA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xcc223499aedb939fc9ab515c4d718f775c6c0c846cfbbf2e664d4c8dd66222d857f0b3766fe372bbdedd99dfd91d20b3fc2bbd24e7432417d0852e12ef6867fe1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on clip.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FWIfH_2BkmWesIzfo1uBKkfvBYH7OFR-eaeA_2mEJ_E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"nzlTXDLrvz5BiyPYf9M4w_RKlThIHVwgM_7FIa9uZ_I\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"mOCENLvP1aYXOBOPiLoLjBlSTvJWBqccfkn4gTPJ8qM\"}"
