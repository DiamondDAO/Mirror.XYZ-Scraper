"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Hello! My name is Troy and I am the co-founder of psettings.\\n\\nWe’re a collective of people who met each other and started working together mainly because of the music industry. We all have different backgrounds personally and professionally.\\n\\nI am from New York, went to school in New Orleans and moved to Los Angeles after I graduated. For the entirety of my career, I’ve worked at Excel Sports Management, Sony Pictures Television, Endeavor, and Scoremore along with a few other internships within the Entertainment industry. While I’ve built a career in talent representation, my drive comes from the excitement that I get working closely with content creators.\\n\\nSome of our other members are from all over including Toronto, Sacramento, and St. Croix. We all have different professional backgrounds across photography, creative direction, accounting, videography, fintech management consulting, social media management, digital marketing, and more. What makes us a collective is that we are all working for each other. We don’t all work across every project that we touch, we don’t hold each other back from taking outside work, we split revenue we generate together evenly, and we emphasize the importance of our relationships above all.\\n\\nWe take our backgrounds and leverage them to find strategic partnerships across a bunch of different verticals. Our main focus is on music, entertainment and culture because we all share a genuine passion for these areas. In talent management we’ve spent time representing artists like Tory Lanez, Mariah the Scientist, Kaash Paige, Melii and more. We recently signed NorthSideBenji and GOVI from Toronto, ON and Hamond from Houston, TX. We also do digital marketing consulting for clients including Dreamville, Illegal Civilization, and artists across a variety of major labels. We’re also beginning to partner with content creators in an effort to help them scale their digital media businesses. Recently, we formed a partnership with @PopBase - a media account focused on covering all things pop-culture.\\n\\nAbout a year ago, I started creating content in an effort to tell our story as we develop our projects.  Future posts will be more in-depth and focused on nailing down details about the work we are doing and the things we are focusing on. Whether you’re simply interested in learning about the worlds we sit in or looking for feedback on something that you might think we can be helpful on, please feel free to reach out. I look forward to continuing to share our journey here with you.\\n\\nEmail: troy@psettings.com\\n\\nYou can check out some of our video content on YouTube as well.
