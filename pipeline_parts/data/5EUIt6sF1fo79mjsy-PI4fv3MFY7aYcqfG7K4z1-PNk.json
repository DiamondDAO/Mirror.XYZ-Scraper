"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"introduce\\nDecentralized finance not only subverts traditional financing methods, but also subverts the entire crypto industry. In DeFi, the market is always open, and no central authority can prevent payments or deny access to financial products. Services that were previously slow and at risk of human error are now automatic and safer because they are handled by code that anyone can check. There is no doubt that decentralized finance will continue to exist, as can be seen from its huge market value of more than $100 billion at the time of writing.\\n\\nHowever, there is one problem and it is obvious: DeFi lacks mass adoption. Newcomers, especially retail users, are afraid to use it because it seems too complicated to understand. There are huge flaws in the information and user onboarding process.\\n\\nGamification is the answer\\nAfter spending countless hours explaining DeFi to our colleagues, friends and family, we decided that we must do something. We hope to create a product that introduces decentralized finance to novices in an interactive, fun and easy-to-learn way. In addition, our goal is to redesign the experience of existing DeFi users to make it more attractive and customer-centric.\\n\\nWait, wait. First of all, what is gamification?\\n\\\"Gamification is about taking things that are not games and applying game mechanics to increase user engagement, happiness, and adoption!\\\". In other words, gamification takes elements from game design and general principles and theories that drive gameplay, and applies them to other environments. This is exactly what DeFi lacks. Gamification helps people easily understand complex products and creates interesting and smooth experiences for them. Our team believes that we will change people's perceptions of decentralized finance.\\n\\nFor our team, this is a great opportunity to build community-driven projects designed to help people learn, make money, and have fun. We are more than happy to receive any kind of feedback, because we want you to be part of the journey, not observing from the passenger seat, but actually standing next to us.\\n\\nStart with Solana\\nDeFi Land is a multi-chain game designed to provide the best user experience and onboarding process. But we must start somewhere. This is why we observe closely to determine which blockchain to start with. We want transaction fees to be low and fast, while maintaining security. DeFi Land chose to build on Solana because it provides everything players need-the fastest transaction processing speed, and the cost is close to zero. In addition, Solana's ecosystem is developing rapidly because it attracts the best talents to build game-changing projects. We firmly believe that to create the smoothest DeFi experience through gamification, fast, cheap, and safe are of the utmost importance.\\n\\nWelcome dear farmers to DeFi Land üöú üë®‚Äçüåæ\\n\\nDeFi Land is a multi-chain agricultural simulation online game that aims to gamify decentralized finance. Our game will have all the functions of the traditional platform, but it will be concentrated in one place.\\n\\nThe amazing thing about our project is that we did not create a closed ecosystem for our games like you have seen in other agreements. We do not want to create a new environment, but to accelerate, gamify and improve the existing environment. DeFi Land will run on the established platform, which means that users will use the well-known AMM/DEX/loan agreement through our game. For example, when players try to farm output in our game, they will actually use different mining pools and betting platforms through our interface.\\n\\nIn DeFi Land, each asset will represent a currency. For example, in our demonstration, SOL is sunflower, USDC-corn, and COPE-pumpkin. These assets will be used to perform the same activities provided by traditional DeFi and various other activities that we will reveal soon.\\n\\nDeFi Land is an ambitious game with many extraordinary features. Our game will be launched in two versions, v1.0 will be launched this summer, and v2.0 is scheduled to be delivered in early 2022. It will be available to Internet and mobile phone users. All game design and mechanics are experimental and will be iterated many times.\\n\\nDeFi Land v1\\nRelaxed sound, intuitive user interface, pleasant environment... Version 1 will have the basic functions of a decentralized financial protocol, including:\\n\\nSwap\\nLiquidity provision\\nStakeout and yield agriculture\\nGovernance\\nCustomizable land\\nEducational land (practical mode)\\nAchievement\\nYou may ask:\\n\\nOkay, all of the above makes sense, but what is practice mode and what is achievement?\\nAll users can use the educational land (practice mode) to try using fake assets and play the guided version of our game. Users will be introduced to each DeFi feature and learn the ELI5 (explained like I was 5 years old) style to understand the basic concepts.\\n\\nIn order to motivate people to play our game, we will set various goals, once achieved, will unlock NFT, $DFL tokens, prizes, etc.\\n\\nDeFi Land v2\\nAs mentioned earlier, our game will have two versions, because v2.0 is scheduled to be released in early 2022. Version 2 will include many amazing and game-changing features that will make our project an all-in-one gamification experience. v2 will have:\\n\\nBorrow\\nindex\\nNFT market\\nInteractive chat\\nPrediction and betting\\nUnions, clans and battles\\nVarious interesting mini games\\nchampionship\\nEthereum, Terra and BSC land\\nWe will gradually release detailed information about each function and how it works.\\n\\nDeFi Land is currently being developed on Solana and will not support DeFi protocols on other blockchains. Since we want the user experience to be fast, cheap and effective, we choose Solana as the first chain we will join players. However, we will add more blockchains in the near future. We are a community-oriented game, and we will regularly vote on features to be added and features to be improved.\\n\\nPracticality of DFL Token and community airdrop\\nDFL token is not just another common governance token provided to users by all protocols. We want to give players the opportunity to participate fully. DFL is the native token in our game, used to manage DeFi Land and reward our players in the game, allowing them to bet, compete, place bets, etc.\\n\\nDeFi Land will enable users to customize their land, buy skins, buy NFTs from the market, give tips to their friends, and various other features coming soon in v2. All these functions will be provided through our tokens. We hope that DFL will become a currency that people love, use and have fun with every day.\\n\\nCommunity airdrops will be provided for testers, early adopters and active group members.\\n\\nTo participate in the airdrop and get more information, please join our Telegram and Discord groups and follow us on Twitter.\\n\\nTeam expertise\\nDeFi Land is built by an experienced team of 5 people who have been researching and exploring the decentralized financial industry.\\n\\nWe have successfully led companies in multiple industries including AR, VR, AI, gaming, financial technology and ERP. Our team has worked with the largest banks and retail companies in many regions.\\n\\nOur expertise in gaming, working directly with customers, and building customer-centric products will ensure the best user experience for our players. All team members have rich experience and computer science background, which gives us a strong advantage in delivering high-quality products quickly.\\n\\nFuture plan\\nWe are actively developing our game because we hope to launch it as soon as possible. DeFi Land v1.0 is expected to be launched this summer, bringing many amazing rewards and gifts to our community. Over time, we will publish articles about our features and delve into a project. DeFi Land will stay and disrupt the decentralized financial industry by making it fun, easy to learn, and gamified.\\n\\nWe will release our detailed roadmap, project documentation, tokenomics and amazing partnerships soon, so please pay close attention to our social media pages.
