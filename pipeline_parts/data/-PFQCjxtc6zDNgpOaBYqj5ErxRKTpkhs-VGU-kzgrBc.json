"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"2921 Spring \\n  \\n Qingming: Clarity and Brilliance, clearness and brightness - a part of the rhythm of life and death. \\n\\nThe Qingming Festival, Tomb Sweeping Day, is observed soon after the beginning of the fifth solar month, in early April. Families clean ancestors' resting places, and set a feast and fortune for them, so that they would prosper in the new world they passed on to.\\n\\nIt was \\\"Spring\\\" based on the old ways - a time of renewal and rebirth.\\n\\nAPRIL 2X21, on approach to Jupiter Space from the Asteroid Belt.\\n\\nJake Jr. and Al walk in with bundles in their hands back into the family ship, The Magpie.\\n\\n\\\"Jakey, just a couple more trips and we'll have everything.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Al, after these last few weeks, it's nice to have just five minutes where everything wasn't...\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There's so much we have to do but each task has its right time.\\\"\\n\\nIt's the time of the Festival. The Spacers left their original homes behind but they still carried it in their hearts. They would remember everything and everyone sacrificed for their longing for more.\\n\\nIt's hard to know where you're headed unless you know where you came from. It's hard to know who you could become, unless you know who you are. This is why we have rituals and remembrances. We need our roots if we are to reach the stars. Today was a day to remember Dad.\\n\\nJacob Chinua Tagore, Sr., last captain of The Tagore flagship, The Magpie, former officer and gentleman soldier, leader of an infamous travelling performing troupe, and accidental adventurer. Father, brother, and friend. One of a kind. One of one.\\n\\n\\\"Let's go Jakey, we have almost everything ready. The rest of the Clan will be here soon.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll get ready to burn some lokens, some Joves, for Dad.\\\"\\n\\nAround Jupiter, the lokens, were Joves. Instead of burning paper joss, they would \\\"burn\\\" these local tokens, for Jacob Sr's Festival. There would be fireworks in space and holofires, and the bundles were a feast of delicacies, many of them Jacob Sr's favorite foods like roast lamb.\\n\\nBefore Al Tagore, formerly ALEP-H, son of Cadmus, and Jacob Chinua Tagore, Jr., moved forward with what was going to happen this year, they had the luxury to look back. There was time. They would remember.\",\"timestamp\":1633906309,\"title\":\"2921: 3.7 The Festival of Remembrance, 2921 Spring\"},\"digest\":\"9J_UIH6Rh4Acte6h_8NDqrFM9qUGzaSOb9kQDIcC2BQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"mu5lTlzN50LGXRf_UCtfOWyIug9A39FLdnfBoCWMS6N9CvrxStH5d125_plNUbvpCvp_l-cq8F0WiIcjTSAn5A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Y_8LH-xAK5_kPTHOWPOkOZO8voQRv41OovjhdmrLGQs\"}"
