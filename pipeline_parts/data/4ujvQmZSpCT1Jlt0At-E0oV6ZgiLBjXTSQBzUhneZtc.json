"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Day 6\\n\\nThe sun was shining and everything looked the most amazing it had ever looked before, i mean how couldnâ€™t it when it was literally created a couple of days ago. straight from the ether, brand new, and blaze.\\n\\nSee how marvelous the trees and animals look, how fresh and clean the air is, and jut how perfect the weather always is. The trees, in a constant state of producing fruits in abundance while the animals enjoy eternal youth and health.\\n\\nThere in front of Adam was the most amazing scenery one could imagine, tiny water falls, a variety of fruit, plants species etc. it was clearly a scene to behold, one destined to never leave your mind once you set your eyes on it.\\n\\nWho before going on to slumber decided to bless Adam and appoint him the care taker of his creation. Everything above and below, inner and outer was given to him to rule over.\\n\\nAfter all he was the exact replica of his creator, a tiny spark of the cosmic fire and flame, that which gave birth to all creation. Channeling a small amount of the creator essence and power through his very soul.\\n\\nAnd a creator deserved his own mini kingdom to rule, and so the earth was to be both his domain and his home. A chair fit for a prince to govern the universe while the king was resting.\\n\\nAnd so Adam took the mantle and begun the work of governing as he was instructed by the lord of hosts. During the absence of the lord his creator, Adam mostly spent his days helping the animals in the garden.\\n\\nNaming them, and discovering new ways of using the abilities given to him when he to help there day to day tasks. tasks which also included the overseeing of the creation of new planets, preparing them so they can be ready to be seeded with life forms suited to the terrain.\\n\\nHowever in his spare time he would receive special teaching from the angels as part of his training, and boy did he learn quick. The secrets of the universe which each angel was assigned was slowly imparted to Adam.\\n\\nHe wa charged with understanding how things work, why they behave the way they do and many more things. For how will he rule what he doesnt know, yet least understand it. hence th angels were tasked to share all there abilities and secrets to Adam.\\n\\nFor each angel can only be allowed to know particular secrets of heaven and was never allowed to share them except with Adam. Some angels taught him the secrets of stones, herbs, of the stars and many more and every thing was perfect.\\n\\nAnd although unknown to Adam not all the angels were happy with the authority which he was granted by the creator and with that they set out to try and trap him, and prove to the creator how unfit his son and chosen champion was.\\n\\n \",\"timestamp\":1635849056,\"title\":\"black Adam in Paradise\"},\"digest\":\"Gg4lAJo-LOk6XRL2uuYrLfW7XUzjhRNg7YWcfL_dGsE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xE3293A736d2BBe183F5C0A90cdb0fe0518f8834E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BMu8_yvrk44paD9RHRISIMFBBvWX4LyFUNr_WYM40pQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QQ-TpdyNnDLLkO91a9tsXrmzfDTx1qkBIQ8X5gq3QkI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"K9A5snHMcNxSkZ9AYFxDBEaFle8h92mFRJj8IilcK9xU0iaEJy5VFupqk2R5WJsxVVetkAie6bp5L5n2mKW4hQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0e60b8e37609dbdf299f1bc1b29c349660138d59e4de362e23e747e4881012e05bf11afba28c49e301f689e425f3bf948fcb99c08ab12d04d9e7c2b1af8801031b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BMu8_yvrk44paD9RHRISIMFBBvWX4LyFUNr_WYM40pQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QQ-TpdyNnDLLkO91a9tsXrmzfDTx1qkBIQ8X5gq3QkI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"MWMVud41F1VtS04snH7eNjx6FyRkpN8gKjuaTS5IZAY\"}"
