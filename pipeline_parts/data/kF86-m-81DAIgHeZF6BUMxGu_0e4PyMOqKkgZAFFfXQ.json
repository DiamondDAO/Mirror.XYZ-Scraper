"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"We can't catch a break. Since the Covid-19 pandemic struck in the spring of 2020, the United States has suffered hundreds of thousands of deaths due to the virus and lost millions of jobs. There was much hope the pandemic would soon be behind us when the vaccines were rolled out this spring, but no such luck. The Delta variant of the virus hit us hard this fall, costing more lives and doing more economic damage, this time by igniting long-dormant inflation.\\n\\nThe consumer price index, which measures prices paid by the typical consumer, is up 6.2% over the past year through October, the highest inflation rate in more than 30 years. Prices are up strongly for everything from gasoline to a pound of ground beef to a used vehicle, which is putting a heavy financial weight on already hard-pressed families struggling with the economic fallout from the pandemic. For a household earning the median income of almost **$70,000** per year, the acceleration in inflation is adding an estimated nearly $200 per month to living costs.\\nBut this uncomfortably high inflation isn't here to stay. It won't be lower a month or even three months from now, as quelling the chaos created by the pandemic will take time. But a year from now, as the pandemic recedes, inflation will be low enough that we won't be talking about it. The hair-on-fire discourse over high inflation is understandable, but it's overdone.\\n\\nConsider that inflation is up in part because businesses that suffered a direct hit from the pandemic, such as clothing stores, hotels, rental car companies and restaurants, are simply restoring prices they slashed earlier in the pandemic to survive. This is a one-time adjustment in their prices. To understand the size of the impact, consider that consumer price inflation over the past two years through October, which abstracts from the wild pandemic-induced swings in prices, is up 3.7% annually. Still high, but much less than 6.2%.\\nThe higher inflation is also the result of businesses only slowly increasing production in response to recovering demand. This isn't unusual coming out of a recession. Businesses are unsure whether the stronger demand has staying power and are cautious about ramping up production. And it takes some doing to get shuttered factories, oil rigs and hotels back up and running. **But if history is a guide, the higher prices will convince consumers to buy less of what costs more and convince businesses to increase production given how much money can be made at these higher prices. Frictions that slow supply catching up with demand ease, and inflation moderates.**\",\"timestamp\":1637316470,\"title\":\"Here's when high inflation will come to an end\"},\"digest\":\"sjW6aNEPRX9x9P7zykGMrwvjbyiQQgSi313yl4idYuk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xc444cB23c821CE3bd77e8e3d0bE23a2A099Fb383\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"w7XH2D4C9UqmB0sgdNGPSM5Ao59g5iMRHuKw9X-Zu9E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"n9ulBXJdsjhGWOCBsc2OeBESCgH2XF1Fj_svxq46eUM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"htodelZXuq7cHYZglwMCI2Xe9whIBGlSKGmHNsxG0Mc0YMgnC3CgC_owHQCEv9rgmkfLQVHE6c_r0lU9EEj_eA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa4544526e1571334880a893704182b6be3f41c46812f69b054cc5f51343990b85fdc39c0cdd524577d34ec4c4cf423bd9fabb325c3772da9e27b5af2d6332e0a1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"w7XH2D4C9UqmB0sgdNGPSM5Ao59g5iMRHuKw9X-Zu9E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"n9ulBXJdsjhGWOCBsc2OeBESCgH2XF1Fj_svxq46eUM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"sjW6aNEPRX9x9P7zykGMrwvjbyiQQgSi313yl4idYuk\"}"
