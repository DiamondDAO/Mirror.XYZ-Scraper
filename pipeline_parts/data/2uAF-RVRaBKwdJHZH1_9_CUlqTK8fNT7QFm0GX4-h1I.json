"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"On July 2 two ships arrived in Buenos Ayres bringing the news that the decree had been put in force in Spain on April 2 with success. As all the crew of both the ships knew what had happened in Spain, concealment of his plan became no longer possible.  Thus, had the Jesuits possessed either the wish or the means to make an armed resistance, they had ample time to stand on their defence.\\n\\nNothing was further from their minds, though they had complete dominion over a territory as large as France, and which contained a population of over one hundred and fifty thousand souls.*1* For arms, they had as chief defence some \\\\`very long English guns, with rests if they wished to use them, which were not very heavy, and had a tolerable range.'*2*  These were the preparations that the Jesuits (who, not in Paraguay alone, but throughout all the American dominions of the Spanish crown, ruled over territories stretching from California to Cape Horn)*3* had made, and they were found alone in the missions of Paraguay, where, by a special permission of the Kings of Spain, arms were allowed for defence against the Portuguese.\\n\\n\\\\-- *1* Funes, `Ensayo de la Historia Civil', etc., vol. iii., cap. viii. *2* `Tambien en algunos pueblos hay unas escopetas inglesas     muy largas con sus horquillas si se quieren usar     de ellas no son muy pesadas y tienen buen alcance'     (Funes, `Ensayo de la Historia Civil del Paraguay', etc.,     vol. iii., cap. viii.). *3* There were in the year 1759 throughout the world 271 Jesuit missions,     1,542 religious houses, 61 cattle farms, 340 residences, 171 seminaries,     1,542 churches, and 22,589 Jesuits, whereof 11,293 were priests.     Of the above houses, missions, and churches, the greater portion     were in America (Ferrer del Rio, `Historia del Reinado de Carlos III.',     Madrid, 1856).\\n\\n```\\nIn the River Plate and Paraguay there were about 400 Jesuits,     of whom 300 were priests.  The other hundred, according to Ibanez     (`Republica Jesuitica'), were `mostly poor devils     who were in want of food, and came into the Order for a meal.'     Ibanez rarely spoke the truth, not even when it would have been     expedient to do so; and certainly amongst these `poor devils'     could not have been included Asperger, the writer on Indian medicines,     and other distinguished men who inhabited the Paraguayan missions     as lay brothers. --\\n```\\n\\nBucareli, who seems to have been a timid but honest and upright man, made his first experiment upon the Jesuits of Buenos Ayres, Cordoba, and Santa Fe.  The colleges in all these places were suppressed on the same night, and without the least resistance from their occupants. He who suppresses a religious Order, takes a town or country, or, in fact, puts into operation any of the forces of the law or military power, always expects, no matter how exalted be his motives at the start, to recoup himself from the treasure of the conquered.  \\\\`Vae victis', together with the vestments of the church, the plainsong, and the saints, came as a pagan heritage to the new faith, and has been held as canon law since Constantine looked at the sky and thought he saw a cross.\\n\\nGreat must have been the disgust of the Governor to find the spoil so paltry, and not to have the satisfaction even of saying that the Jesuits had hidden all their gold, as, his own measures having been taken secretly, they had no knowledge of what was in the wind.  In the college of Cordoba, esteemed to be a mine of wealth, was found only nine thousand dollars,\\\\* which sum Ferando Fabro, the commissioner sent by Bucareli to take over the effects of the Jesuits at Cordoba, duly chronicles in his report.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Dean Funes, \\\\`Ensayo de la Historia Civil', etc.,   vol. iii., book v., cap. ix. --\\n\\nBut if the college of Cordoba*1* proved a miserable prey, there still remained the Jesuit missions on the Uruguay and Parana, with all the riches of their fertile territory, and the enormous wealth which every Spaniard firmly believed the Jesuits had acquired. None of the Jesuits, either in Buenos Ayres, Cordoba, Santa Fe, Corrientes, or Monte Video having made the least resistance, but having opened wide their doors to the soldiers, who in all the towns on the same day at two o'clock in the morning came to signify their expulsion to them, it was only natural to think that the same conduct would be observed in Paraguay.  But Governors and Governments never seem in the least accessible to common-sense.  Almost a year had passed before he plucked up courage for his dangerous task.*2* He set about it with more preparation than either Cortez or Pizarro made for the conquest of Mexico or of Peru.  Having embarked for Spain in the frigate \\\\`La Esmeralda' one hundred and fifty Jesuits from the towns of Cordoba, Buenos Ayres, Monte Video, and Santa Fe, he prepared to march upon the missions, when a suspicion of resistance caused him to take precautions which the result proved quite ridiculous. He sent two hundred of the best of the militia of Asuncion to occupy the fords upon the Tebicuari,*3* and a body of equal strength to occupy the port of San Miguel.  All these measures being taken for his safety, the conqueror embarked upon May 24, taking with him three companies of grenadiers and sixty dragoons.  He disembarked at the town of Salto on the Uruguay, and from thence despatched Captain Don Juan Francisco de la Riva Herrera to occupy the towns upon the Parana.  Don Francisco de Zabala was sent to seize six of the towns upon the Uruguay.  Bucareli himself, with several hundred men, marched upon Yapeyu,*4* the southernmost of all the mission towns. The Jesuits, however, gave no trouble to any of the troops, and even stopped the Governor from gathering any laurels, however withered, with which to crown his arms.\\n\\n\\\\-- *1* The fine library was dispersed, and many priceless MSS. treating of     the discovery and conquest, and of expeditions by the Jesuits     amongst tribes of Indians now extinct, were lost.  Nothing seems     to have been preserved except matter which the dispersers thought     might prove incriminating to the Jesuits.  It is a well-known principle     to judge and condemn a man, and then to search for evidence against him.     The books were kept in a place known as La Granja de Santa Catalina,     and a man of letters, Dr. Don Antonio Aldao, was charged     to catalogue and remit them to the capital.  Dean Funes says     (book v., cap. ix., p. 156) that he complied with his instructions     (`verifico/la felizmente y con arreglo a sus instrucciones'),     but, anyhow, most of the books were lost.  It is a common phrase     amongst doctors, `The operation was entirely successful,     but the patient unfortunately succumbed.'  Amongst the books     was the celebrated `Monita Secreta', used by Ibanez in his charges     (after the expulsion) against the Jesuits. *2* Dean Funes (`Ensayo de la Historia Civil', vol. iii., cap. viii.)     seems to have gauged the feelings of the Governor when he says:     `Temblo de susto Bucareli considerando en riesgo una conquista,     que debia aumentar su gloria y su fortuna.'  `Su fortuna' is delicious,     and shows your true conqueror's melancholy. *3* The Tebicuari forms the northern boundary between     the territory of Misiones and the rest of Paraguay.  It is a large river,     and in my time (1872-1875) was bridgeless, and had to be crossed     in canoes, whilst the horses swam, or were towed behind the canoes     with ropes. *4* Yapeyu was the largest of all the missions.  The name signifies a chisel     in Guarani. --\\n\\nAs he advanced from town to town, the priests, on his arrival at each place, although living in the midst of Indians, some of whom were armed, and many of whom had served the King of Spain in various wars, and all of whom looked on the Jesuits almost as gods, came out and peacefully gave up the keys of all their houses, and submitted quietly to be made prisoners and be carried off in chains from the territories which they and their order had civilized and ruled over almost two hundred years.  Seventy-eight Jesuits and their provincials were sent prisoners to Buenos Ayres, and their places all filled up with other priests taken from different Orders, and none of whom had any experience in mission-work.  As Dean Funes tartly writes, the miracle that Bucareli wished, but scarcely dared to hope for, had taken place.  The Jesuits, in Paraguay, at least, by their conduct in their last public act, most amply vindicated their loyalty to the Spanish crown.  Nothing would have been easier, depleted as the viceroyalty was at the time of troops,\\\\* than to have defied the forces which Bucareli had at his disposal, and to have set up a Jesuit State, which would have taxed the utmost resources of the Spanish crown to overcome. No doubt the very facility with which Bucareli carried out his plans confirmed him in his own mind of their expediency, for men in general are prone to think that right which they accomplish with success. However, be that as it may, he returned in triumph to Buenos Ayres on September 16, having expended in his expedition less than four months. So in a quarter of a year the Jesuits, after more than two hundred years of rule, were all expelled from Paraguay.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Bucareli, in a letter to El Conde de Aranda (Brabo, `Coleccion de Documentos   relativos a/ la Expulsion de los Jesuitas', Madrid, 1872),   says in reference to the perils by which he imagined himself surrounded:   `El misero diminuto estado de la tropa, por el atraso   de sus pagas y la falta que encontre/ de caudales en estas cajas,   era una urgencia que me atormentaba.' --\\n\\nThey made no fight, nor offered any resistance, letting themselves be taken as a butcher takes a sheep, and that surrounded as they were by a population of upwards of one hundred and fifty thousand souls, cut off by countless leagues from the outside world, defended on three sides by virgin forests and by marshes hardly passable to European troops. One word from the Provincial would have set the missions in a blaze. A word would have brought clouds of horsemen -- badly armed, 'tis true, but knowing every foot of marsh and forest, all the deep-beaten tracks which wind in the red earth across the lonely plains, the passes of the rivers, springs, natural fastnesses, and having the varied knowledge of a country which of old made Border horsemen and Northumbrian prickers formidable upon the Scottish marches -- into the field.\\n\\nThe dogged Paraguayan Indians, ancestors of the infantry which, under Lopez,*1* died so bravely under the fire of the Brazilian guns, would, in their red cloaks and scanty linen clothes, have marched from `capilla'*2* and from mission against the enemies of the `father-priests'.  Seventy-eight Jesuits were marched off to Buenos Ayres, and then shipped off to Europe*3* to join their fellows, who had been brought together by the ministers of the most liberal King who ever filled the Spanish throne from every quarter of the world.  Having expelled the Jesuits, Bucareli was bound by the exigencies of his position to calumniate them.  Perhaps, as an official, hidebound in his belief in the inalterable right of Governments to commit injustices, he believed all that he wrote.  For the welfare of humanity, one could hope he knew all that he wrote was false.  What hope is there left for mankind as long as addle-headed, honest men see naught but justice in whatever order they receive?  Better a thousand times a rogue who knows he is a rogue than a good, well-intentioned, blundering man quite unaware he is a fool.\\n\\n\\\\-- *1* This war, undertaken by a fool (Lopez) against enormous odds,     served to show what a people even when in the wrong, and in a bad cause,     can do when it believes itself to be fighting for national liberty.     As a matter of fact, Paraguayan liberty was not threatened     for an instant, and Lopez declared war against both     Brazil and the Argentine Republic out of mere ambition     to be a second Napoleon.  His solitary qualifications for the character     were that, like his prototype, he was fat and loved women.     The war commenced in 1865 and finished in 1870, and left the country     almost a desert.  So lonely was it, that I have often in those days     seen tigers calmly walk across a road in mid-day,     and a shout or a pistol-shot but little quickened their movements. *2* `Capilla' was the name given in Paraguay to some of the smaller villages     which had a chapel, the chapel (`capilla') being more important     than the houses. *3* El V. P. Jose Pignatelli, in his \\\\`La Compan\\\\~ia de Jesus     en su Extincion y Restablecimento', says that the Paraguayan Jesuits     were all sent to Faenza. --\\n\\nBut, still, he had to justify himself either upon his own account or for the benefit of that posterity to conciliate which so many public men have paltered with the truth.  So his first care was to extract a letter from thirty Indians whom he chose to dignify with the title of the mayors of the thirty towns, first having, as he says himself in a letter to the Conde de Aranda, the minister of Charles III., dressed them in the Spanish fashion, and treated them in such a way that they might know how much their lot had been improved.\\\\*  The letter, written originally in Guarani,\\\\*\\\\* bears upon every line of it the dictation of the Governor. After a fine paragraph of salutations, it goes on to give the King many and repeated thanks (`muchas y repetidas gracias') for having sent his Excellency Captain-General Don Francisco Bucareli, `who has fulfilled, for the love of God and for the love of your Majesty, all the just orders which your Majesty laid to his charge, aiding our poverty, and clothing us like gentlemen.'  Most people, even the heathen, like those who help their poverty and clothe them in the garb of gentlemen. It had not occurred to the poor Indians that the fine clothes might turn out liveries.  The mayors all sign their Indian names, which seems to give the lie to the accusation that the Jesuits kept them ignorant.  The letter, dated Buenos Ayres, March 10, 1768, seems to show that the Indians, be they who they might have been, were not free agents at the time they wrote.  The Indians' letter duly despatched, the Governor indited a report, in which he fairly and with circumstance reiterates all the old charges against the Jesuits in Paraguay which the inventive brain of Cardenas had first conceived; but to them he adds several little touches of his own, which show he had some observation and an imaginative mind.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* `Carta del Gobernador de Buenos Ayres (Bucareli) al Comte de Aranda'.   Brabo, `Coleccion de Documentos Relativos a la Expulsion de los Jesuitos',   p. 8, Madrid, 1872:  `Les hice vestir a la Espan~ola   asistiendolos y tratandolos de modo que conozcan la mejora   de su suerte. . . .' ** Brabo, `Coleccion de Documentos', etc., p. 101.  The letter is headed    \\\\`I. H. T., Ore Rey Nitu Don Carlos Tercero'. --\\n\\nAmongst his numerous letters to Aranda and to the King, one dated Buenos Ayres, October 14, 1768,\\\\* contains the fullest account of his proceedings in the missions and of his views (or of what he thought to be his views) about the work in which he was engaged. Time was of small account in 1768 either in Paraguay or in Madrid, so Bucareli relates with some prolixity all that he did, with comments, movements of troops, regrettable occurrences -- as when his soldiers let themselves be surprised and lost their horses -- and now and then scraps of morality and theology, which shows quite plainly that the art of writing maundering despatches is not so new as optimists may have supposed.  Quite in the manner of a modern special correspondent, he sets down all that he suffered from the weather; that it rained incessantly, and, marvellous to tell, that after rain the rivers rose, and gave him difficulty to cross.  The roads were bad, provisions scarce and dear, and now and then wild Indians `massacred' an outpost of his men, whilst his brave fellows, when God willed it, occasionally `chastised' the infidel, and by the grace of Heaven slew no small number of them.  Still, in the monstrous farrago of words, extending to some sixteen pages of close print, he lets us see he was a man of some capacity, but leaves it doubtful whether he really thought he was engaged upon a noble work, or if he wrote ironically, or if his only object was to satisfy his conscience and his King. But making much of little difficulties is but to be expected from a leader of an expedition or from a General in the field.  Without it, how could they justify their existence, or prove to the world at large that they were needed, or but more important than a mere ceremony?\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Brabo, `Coleccion de Documentos', etc., p. 185. ** Ceremonies, no doubt, have their uses in enslaving mankind.  A courtier    once said to a Spanish King, `Your Majesty is but a ceremony yourself.' --\\n\\nWhen the land troubles were got over, and Bucareli, having arrived at Yapeyu, embarked upon the river, the very winds proved contrary, so that it took him many days to arrive at Candelaria, which port he reached upon August 27, 1768.  But before quitting Yapeyu the Governor made a solemn feast, riding himself before his grenadiers, whose caps, he says, caused much amazement, the Indians never having seen such headgear in their lives.  The difficulties of his journey over, the Jesuits dispossessed and sent down-stream to be remitted home, Bucareli in his letter next deals with questions of religion, about which he shows himself as well informed as all the Spanish conquerors seem to have been in the New World.  If for the dogma of the faith he was a bar of iron, for `cold morality', as Scottish preachers of the perfervid type used to refer to it, he was most keen.  The Indians' clothes, especially the graceful `tupoi' worn by the women, shocked him exceedingly. It was impossible to touch upon it without an outrage upon modesty.\\\\* Masculine virtue is a most precarious thing, but little, if at all, more stable than its female counterpart; therefore perhaps the Governor was right not to expose his soldiers to temptation, so he did well, as he informs us, in serving out clothes which obscured their charms, or perhaps hid them quite from view.  `Such tyrannies,'** says the modest Governor, `occasioned many offences against God, and frequent illnesses and epidemics.'  The sentence is a little doubtful in its meaning, for if a scantiness of women's dress occasioned illnesses and epidemics amongst the population of a town, Belgravia and Mayfair should surely be the most unhealthy spots on earth; though even there, I verily believe, no more offences against God occur than amongst the Moors, whose women show only their eyes to the shrinking gaze of easily offended men.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Letter to Aranda:  Brabo, `Coleccion de Documentos', p. 196:   `Y las mujeres en tal extremo, que es impossible demostralo   sin faltar a la modestia.' \\\\*\\\\* \\\\`Semejantes tiranias'. --\\n\\nAs in duty bound, Bucareli kept for the end of his despatch a rehash of all the old charges made against the Jesuits. They kept the Indians in slavery, would never let them learn Spanish, and were themselves inordinately rich.  The first two accusations Father Jose Cardiel, in his \\\\`Declaracion de la Verdad', abundantly disproves.\\\\*  The last the Governor disproves himself; for had he found much treasure he most assuredly would have made haste to send it to the King.  What he did find, a reference later to Brabo's inventories will show, and the same source discloses all the wealth the richest Order in the world, according to their enemies, took with them in their involuntary journey back to Spain. All being finished in the missions and the Jesuits expelled, Bucareli found himself obliged to institute some system for the government of the Indian population, which he had deprived both of its spiritual and of its temporal guides.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* P. 222:  \\\\`Y teniendo presente que por lo que mira a este punto resulta   de los informes que solo hablan estos Indios su idioma natural,   pero que no es prohibicion de los PP. Jesuitos, sino por el amor   que tienen a su nativo lenguage pues en cada uno de los pueblos   han establecido esculas de leer y escriber en lengua espan\\\\~ola,   y que por este motivo se encuentra un numero grande de Indios   muy habiles en escribir (dos de ellos etan copiando hora esto   que yo escribo y de mejor letra que la mia).'  Also pp. 223-225, etc. --\\n\\nThe Jesuits' government having been so bad, according to his own despatch, the Indians having been kept in such a miserable state, their education having been so neglected, and, above all, their women having been dressed in such light attire that Bucareli could not with modesty even describe their dress, it might have seemed but natural that he should have evolved some system of government differing in all respects from that he had destroyed.  So far from that, in his instructions to his interim successor, dated at Candelaria,\\\\* August 23, 1768, he practically followed slavishly all the policy which the Jesuits had pursued.  He ordered Captains Riva Herrera and Bruno de Zavala, to whom the arrangements were committed, to see that the Indians were instructed \\\\`in the true knowledge of our holy faith', a work which the Jesuits, whatever might be their faults, had not neglected to insure. After some platitudes as to the vivifying effects of free and open trade, and an injunction to his captains to take care the Indian girls were decorously and virtuously dressed, he launched into a sermon about honest work, which, as he said, would make the Indians rich, happy, and virtuous, and alone could ever make a kingdom prosper; in fact, he used almost precisely similar language to that to-day used by a European Governor in Africa when about to make a people slaves. On the whole, however, his instructions were wise and liberal, and had they been carried out in the same spirit, and with fidelity, the Indians might have long continued in the same half-Arcadian, half-Christian state in which the Jesuits left them, and to which it seems they could attain, but not go farther without exposure to that vivifying commerce without which nations cannot prosper, but with which the greater portion of their citizens must remain ever slaves.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Brabo, \\\\`Coleccion de Documentos', etc., p. 200. --\\n\\nThe instructions given, he left the missions never to return, leaving behind him the reputation of an honest man, having made, as it would appear, no money during his sojourn in their territories. On October 20, 1768, he wrote from Buenos Ayres to Aranda, telling him that his work was done, and asking him as a particular favour to implore the King to give him some employment `out of America, and particularly not under either the secretaryship or the Council of the Indies.'*1* Thus it appears that either the work in which he had been engaged was uncongenial to him, or he mistrusted the future and the Indians when the Jesuits' sheltering hands had been withdrawn, and thought the King might blame him for what was sure to come. One passage in his letter of instructions shows that the antique, but still current, fashion of going to any length to obtain a country in which are situated even supposititious gold-mines had its influence even with such an honest man as Bucareli was.  He specially enjoins upon the officials left in charge `to find out from what quarter the Indians of those towns extract those pieces of the precious metals which they sometimes bring to their priests.'  So that the fable of the false mines started by Cardenas, although a thousand times disproved, still lingered in the minds of those who could not understand what motive except that of growing rich could cause the Jesuits to bury themselves in the recesses of the Paraguayan woods.  The release from things American and under the jurisdiction of the Council of the Indies did not come to Bucareli for almost two more years, during which time he struggled manfully with the affairs of the Jesuit missions, repelled the Chaco Indians on one side, and on the other implored for troops to defend the island of Chiloe against the heretic English, who at that time appear to have been meditating the advancement of their empire in the extremest south.  One curious letter was reserved for Bucareli to indite before he quitted Buenos Ayres for the last time. On January 15, 1770, he sent a long declaration signed by the celebrated Nicolas Neenguiru and other Indians, giving an account of the part played by him in the abortive resistance which he made against the cession of the seven towns.  This is the last time that Nicolas, the `King' of Paraguay and `Emperor of the Mamelucos', appears in any document as far as I can find.  His name at one time was well known in Paraguay, the River Plate and Spain, and served to father many lies upon; and at the last, the Jesuits gone, he seems to have turned against them, and said all that was required by Bucareli to get up his case. It appears from Bucareli's letter that the family of the Neenguiru had been well known in the missions from the time of Cardenas. In 1770*2* we find him shorn of his kingly and imperial dignities, the mayor of Concepcion in Paraguay, tall, taciturn, with long, lank hair, and much respected by his brother Indians, who held his stirrup for him when he got upon his horse.  To find him in the humour to give tongue about the Jesuits was a trump-card in Bucareli's hand, for if it could be proved that in 1750 they had resisted the forces of the crown of Spain, the public, always anxious to believe a lie, would naturally applaud the action of the King in their expulsion from his territories.  Nicolas, who seems to have been but a poor creature at the best, testified that everything which he had done as General of the Indians was by the order of Fathers Limp and Ennis, and that he was a poor Indian who did but that which he was told. He finished up his testimony with thanks to the good King for having taken him out of the power of the Jesuits, and kept him in his post of mayor at Concepcion.  In fact, all was the same to him as long as he was left with his alcalde's staff.*3*\\n\\n\\\\-- *1* `Y sobre todo, fuera de la America y libre de Secretaria y Consejo     de Indias.'  Brabo, `Coleccion de Documentos', etc.:     Letter of Bucareli to Aranda, p. 231. *2* Brabo, \\\\`Coleccion de Documentos', etc., p. 280. *3* The alcaldes of Indian villages usually have a long cane     with a silver head, like those formerly carried by footmen,     as a badge of their office.  In remote places I have seen them,     with their canes in their hands, a battered tall hat upon their heads,     a linen jacket and trousers, and barefooted, riding on an ox,     and thought that they served to maintain the majesty of the law     quite as well as if they had had stuff gowns, horsehair wigs,     and had been seated on a sack of wool. --\\n\\nUpon August 14, 1778, Bucareli sailed for Spain, leaving Don Juan Jose Vertiz as his successor in the viceroyalty of the provinces of the River Plate. The missions were all placed under the care of friars of the begging Orders, chiefly Franciscans, and the system of the Jesuit government was left unchanged.  In 1771, writing from San Lorenzo (el Escorial) in Spain, Bucareli, who seemed fated never to escape from the affairs of Paraguay, sends a long constitution for the thirty towns which follows all the Jesuits' rules of government to the last tittle of their policy.  Brabo has preserved the document, which runs to forty-seven pages of close print in its entirety. A carefully thought-out and well-conceived digest of a constitution it most certainly is, and yet it follows to the most minute particular the policy the Jesuits laid down.\\n\\nDean Funes\\\\* seemed to see that the flattering of Nicolas Neenguiru and the other Indian chiefs was an entire affair of artifice, and that it was but a mere crowning of the victims who were destined to be sacrificed.  It may be that the constitution made by Bucareli at the Escorial was similarly but a blind to keep the Indians quiet till the Government had time to exploit them at its ease. Still, Bucareli in all his actions seems to have been an honest man; one of those honest, narrow-minded men who have sown more misery in the world than all the rogues and scoundrels since the flood.  Be all that as it may, his constitution in a thousand ways recalled the Jesuits' polity in their days of rule.  In a former chapter\\\\*\\\\* I have pointed out a curious instance in which this constitution traverses entirely statements made by the Jesuits' enemies that their exclusive policy was for their own ends, and not, as they alleged, for the protection of the Indians. But there are other instances quite as remarkable which show that the Jesuits not only had grasped perfectly what the best course of treatment was for their subjects, but that the official mind of Bucareli, trained as he was, so to speak, in the strictest sect of Pharisees, and prejudiced against the Jesuits in every way, yet discerned clearly as an honest man that the plan they had laid down was the most suitable for future rulers to pursue.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Vol. iii., book v., cap. viii., p. 130 (`Ensayo de la Historia Civil   del Paraguay', etc.):  `Los Caciques y corregidores que acompan\\\\~aban   a Bucareli, habian sido alhagados por todos los artificios de sugestion.   Esto a/ la verdad, no era mas que coronar las victimas,   que se destinaban al sacrificio.' \\\\*\\\\* Chapter IX. --\\n\\nAt the time of forming his constitution he had been gone but scarce a year from Buenos Ayres, and yet he writes\\\\* complaining bitterly of what was happening in the missions of Paraguay.  He points out that all his trouble will have been in vain `if the Governor and his lieutenants are not stimulated to address themselves to the service of God and of the King, with that zeal which everyone should impart to his duty.' Then, after a puff preliminary of the beauty of freedom, human and Divine, he sets forth how the Indians are in future to be ruled. First, as in duty bound, he points out that anything savouring of communism is against the laws of Heaven and of man; that the Indians in their semi-communism were really slaves, the industrious working for the idle, and so forth; that their clothes were scanty; that they were not allowed to freely mix with Spaniards, and were kept a race apart.  Then like a prudent statesman having made his apologia `pro existentia sua', and blown off much virtuous steam, he comes to business, and business, as we know, is the great soberer of theorists, no matter on what side they theorize.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Brabo, p. 304. --\\n\\nAfter the article to which I have referred in Chapter IX. comes this most curious paragraph, taken in connection with the inalienable right which, according to himself, the Indians had of free communication with the outer world:*1*  `And because I am informed that many Indians who have been absent in the army of the Portuguese, and have resided for lengthened periods in Rio Pardo, Viamont and other parts, have returned to their towns, you will take care that all these with their families shall be removed to those (towns) either in the interior or distant from those frontiers, as it is not convenient that they should remain on them (the frontiers) or close to them; and thus you will proceed successively with the Indians who return, without leaving one, in order to avoid any chance of communication, which might be most prejudicial.'  Surely a satire on his own abuse of the Jesuits for keeping the Indians mewed up from intercourse with the outside world.  It may be that he had perceived the Indians were not fit to hold their own; indeed, it is certain he had done so, for on p. 326 he writes, `It is not convenient to leave them (the Indians) entire liberty,*2* for it would be in the extreme fatal and prejudicial to their interests, because the astuteness and sagacity of the Spaniards would triumph easily over their rusticity.'  `Sagacity' is an ingenious euphuism, and might well be used with good effect in the like circumstances, when occasion serves, to-day. But as no single article of any document set forth by any Government can be straightforward and single in its purpose, and as all laws are made with an eye upon some party presently in power, after the paragraph just quoted, on the next page occurs the following sentence under the head of `Commerce with the Spaniards is to be free'.*3* \\\\`It is laid down that between the Indians and the Spaniards commerce should be free, in order that mutual dealings should unite them in friendship.'  Therefore to the ordinary mind it is impossible to make out what really was intended, and whether commerce was to be free or not.  Those little differences apart, the constitution ran entirely upon Jesuit lines.  That semi-communism which was so prejudicial during the Jesuits' rule was formally re-organized in chapter iv. of the constitution (p. 343) the instant that their power was placed in other hands.  Even the prohibition to the Spaniards to enter the Jesuit towns, and reside there, was formally kept up in chapter iii., with the sole alteration that for three months of the year they might reside amongst the Indians on certain well-defined conditions most prolixly set forth.  So that it will be seen that, if the Jesuits did ill, as usual, any ill they did was carefully perpetuated by their successors, and, quite as naturally, all that they strove to do in favour of the Indians was most carefully undone.\\n\\n\\\\-- *1* Brabo, `Coleccion de Documentos', p. 320:  `Y porque estoy     informado que muchos Indios de los que se habian ausentado     con las tropas Portuguesas, y que han residido por gran tiempo     en el Rio Pardo, Viamont, y otras partes se han restituido a sus pueblos,     ciudaran . . . de que todos estos con sus families seran traslados     a los mas interiores o distantes de aquellas fronteras     por no ser conveniente se mantengan en ellas o sus inmediaciones,     y asi en lo sucesivo lo ejecutaran . . . con los Indios que se restituyan,     sin dejar alguno, para evitar todo motivo de communicacion     que puede ser muy prejudicial.' *2* `No conviene dejarles una entera libertad, que seria por extremo     fatal y prejudicial a/ sus intereses pues la astucia y sagacidad     de los espan~oles triumfaria facilemente de su rudeza.' *3* Brabo, `Bucareli's Instructions', p. 327:  \\\\`Que el commercio     de los espan\\\\~oles ha de ser libre.' --\\n\\nChapter XI\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIt is the fashion of some to say that history, of whatever nature, can but be written dispassionately at a period sufficiently removed from the events of which it treats to have allowed the heat of passion to evaporate.  This is as false as almost every other dictum which men take on trust, forgetting that to have passed into the proverbial stage a saying must have been foolish at the start, in order that it should have got itself commended by the majority of mankind.\\n\\nThe heat of passion never evaporates in regard to events which at the epoch of their acting caused great controversies. From writings of contemporaries the coolest-headed take a bias, in the same way that men unconsciously pass on the microbes of disease to their best friends.  Only from inventories and rolls of court, State Papers and the like is it possible to get unbiassed matter, and even then figures, those chief deceivers of mankind, can be well cooked for or against, according to the bias of the man who draws them up.  Still, when they are drawn up by enemies, they often quite unwittingly show out the truth.  In a letter dated October 30, 1768, Bucareli sends a list to Aranda of the effects of many of the Jesuits taken from Paraguay and sent by him to Spain.  The list itself speaks volumes in defence of the Jesuits in Paraguay.  Whatever may have been their faults, the Governor himself (or even Charles III.) could not have charged upon the captured priests that they had got together a large stock of property during their mission life.*1*  The first upon the list, P. Pedro Zabaleta, took ten shirts, two pillow-cases, two sheets, three pocket-handkerchiefs, two pairs of shoes, two pairs of socks, and a pound and a half of snuff. The others were in general less well set up with shirts,*2* some few had cloaks, and one (P. Sigismundo Griera) a nightcap; but all of them had their snuff, the only relic of their luxurious mission life. Manuel Vergara, their Provincial, testifies in a paper sent with the list that most of the clothes were taken from the common stock, and all the snuff.  What sort of treatment they endured upon their passage in the two frigates `San Fernando' and `San Nicolas' is quite unknown, but certainly their luggage could not have been in the way; and for their snuff, no doubt they husbanded it with care during the long two months, which in those days was thought a record run.*3* In the missions which they had so long tended with such care, giving their muddle-headed love to the Indians in their Machiavelian way, all was confusion in the space of six short months. Dean Funes and Don Feliz de Azara*4* are the only two contemporary writers who treat of the expulsion of the Jesuits from Paraguay outside the official world.  The Dean, a man of the old school, was kindly and humane, well educated, and, having been brought up in Tucuman amongst an Indian population, looked on the Indians in a kindly way as fellow-creatures, though differing in essential points from races which had been for centuries exposed to civilization and its effects. His description of the Indians has for veracity and observation not often been surpassed.  \\\\`Those natives*5* (he says) are of a pale colour, well made, and well set up.  Their talent and capacity are capable of much advancement.  Though they lack invention in themselves, yet are they excellent in imitation.  Idleness seems natural to them, although it may be more the effect of habit than of temperament; their inclination towards acquiring knowledge is decided, and novelty has its full effect upon their minds.  Ambitious of command, they acquit themselves with honour in the positions to which they may attain. Eloquence is held amongst them in the first place, and avarice in no respect degrades their minds.  An injurious word offends them more than punishments, which they solicit rather than undergo the former outrage. Incontinency in their women they look upon but with indifference, and even husbands are little sensible to acts of infidelity. Conjugal love has but slight influence upon the treatment which they give their wives.  Fathers of families care for their sons but little.  The serenity of mind of all these Indians in the midst of the greatest troubles is without equal in the world; never a sigh with them takes off the bitterness of suffering.'\\n\\n\\\\-- *1* The Paraguayan Jesuits were allowed to take away     all their personal property, and it appears that they did so. *2* Cayetano Ibarguen had only two, P. Lorenzo Balda three, and so on     (Brabo, `Coleccion de Documentos', p. 388). *3* So late as 1818 Rengger, in his `Essai Historique sur la Re/volution     du Paraguay', etc., talks of arriving in Buenos Ayres     `apre\\\\s un court trajet de soixante jours.'  From thence to Corrientes     he took seven weeks, but does not say if the passage was considered     short or long. *4* Funes, `Ensayo Critico de la Historia Civil del Paraguay', etc.;     Don Feliz de Azara, `Descripcion y Historia del Paraguay', etc.;     and also `Memorias sobre el estado rural del Rio de la Plata en 1801'. *5* \\\\`Ensayo de la Historia Civil', vol. i., book ii., p. 341. --\\n\\nNo one who knows the Indians but must confess that Dean Funes had made a study of their character deeper than is his own. Azara, on the other hand, was a man of science; his books upon the birds and quadrupeds of Paraguay still hold the field, and are esteemed for curious and minute observation and accuracy as to scientific facts.  The man himself was an extremely able writer, a captain in the Spanish navy, and well educated. For twenty years he served in Paraguay and in the River Plate, with credit to himself and profit to the country which he served. Educated as he was in the school of the Encyclopaedists, amongst the strictest of the pharisees of Liberalism, to him the very name of Jesuit was anathema.  After the fashion of his kind, he seemed unable to distinguish between the scheming Jesuits at European courts and the simple and hard-working missionaries in Paraguay. All were anathema, and therefore all their system was repugnant to him; and though a kindly man, as is set forth abundantly in all his works, he never paused to think that there could be a difference between his ideal free Liberal citizen, voting and exercising all his right of citizenship in a free commonwealth, after the fashion of a dormouse freely exercising his natural functions in the receiver of an air-pump, and a simple Indian of the Paraguayan woods.\\n\\nFreedom to him, as it has been to many theorists, was an abstract thing, possessing which a man, even though starving, must in its mere possession find true happiness.  He never paused to inquire, as even Bucareli did, if the mission Indians could hold their own under free competition with the `sagacity' of the surrounding Spanish settlers. Therefore he is the authority whom Liberals always quote against the system of the Jesuits.  When he inveighs against their semi-communism, the modern Liberal claps his hands, and sees a kindred Daniel come to judgment, as he would do to-day if in Damaraland the Germans set up a Socialistic settlement amongst the negro tribes, and some Liberal economist denounced it with an oath.  Azara quite forgets that, as Dean Funes says, the `sentiment of property was very weak amongst the Indians,' and that their minds were \\\\`not degraded by the vice of avarice.' Still, Azara was an honest man -- a keen observer and impartial, as far as his upbringing and the tenets he had imbibed in youth permitted him to be.  Upon the question of the Jesuits he was entirely prejudiced, although few have stood up more stoutly to condemn the faulty system which the Spaniards pursued towards the Indians in both Americas.  But on account of his political proclivities Azara is quite silent as to the state into which the missions fell after the Jesuits had been expelled.  No doubt he thought that, once their faulty system was removed, the Indians would soon become what he judged civilized, and hold their own with those around them, though of another race and blood.\\n\\nFunes, upon the contrary, fully exposes all the rapacity and incompetence of the new shepherds left by Bucareli to guard the Jesuits' sheep.\\n\\n`Ignorant* of Guarani, and without patience to acquire it, confusion reigned in the missions as in a tower of Babel,' and he goes on to say `an imperious tone of order was substituted for the paternal manner (of the Jesuits), and as a deaf man who cannot hear has to be taught by blows, that was the teaching they (the Indians) had to bear.'  Shortly, he says, \\\\`a wall of hatred and contempt began to rise between the Indians and their masters; and the priests, who by the virtue of their office ought to have been the ministers of peace, being without influence to command . . . and not entirely irreproachable in their ministry . . . added themselves to the discord and dissension which arose.'\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Funes, \\\\`Ensayo de la Historia Civil', etc., book v., cap. viii., p. 133. --\\n\\nBucareli, as soon as he knew what was going on, advised that all the priests appointed by himself should be replaced by others.  This accordingly was done, but it was even then too late:  the missions went from bad to worse; of the vast quantities of cattle few were left; the priests followed the example of their prototypes Hofni and Phineas, went about armed, took Indian mistresses, and neglected all religious duties, treating the Indians after the fashion of the Spaniards in the settlements. Thus the Arcadian life, which had subsisted more than two hundred years, in the brief space of two short years was lost.\\n\\nThe vast estancias, in which at the expulsion more than a million head of cattle pastured,\\\\* were but bare plains, in which the cattle that were left had all run wild or perished from neglect. Wild beasts roamed round the outskirts of the half-deserted towns. A dense low scrub of yatais and of palmettos invaded all the pasture-lands, and in the erstwhile cultivated fields rank weeds sprang up, and choked the crops which in the Jesuits' times had made the mission territories the most productive of the American possessions of the Spanish crown. The churches were unserved, and in the evening air no more the hymns resounded, nor did the long white-robed processions headed by a cross pass to the fields to peaceful labour, marshalled by their priests.  The fruit-trees round the missions were either all cut down for firewood or had degenerated, and the plantations of the Ilex Paraguayensis,\\\\*\\\\* from which they made their \\\\`yerba', which had been brought from the up-country forests with vast pains, were in decay, and quite uncultivated.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Brabo, `Inventarios', Appendix, p. 669. ** Demersay (`Histoire du Paraguay'), writing in 1847,    says of the mission of La Cruz he saw a few trees still standing    in a miserable state. --\\n\\nThe Indian population had almost disappeared within the space of eight-and-twenty years.\\\\*  The Guaranis collected from the woods with so much effort to the missionary, then guided down the Parana by the most noble and self-sacrificing of their priests, Ruiz Montoya, and after that redeemed with blood from the fierce Mameluco bands, had shrunk away before the baneful breath of unaccustomed contact with the civilizing whites.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Funes, \\\\`Ensayo de la Historia Civil', etc., book vi., cap. viii., p. 395. --\\n\\nThe simple ceremonious, if perhaps futile, mission-life had withered up at the first touch of vivifying competition -- that competition which has made the whole world gray, reducing everything and everyone to the most base and commonest denominator.\\n\\nThe self-created goddess Progress was justified by works, and all the land left barren, waiting the time when factories shall pollute its sky, and render miserable the European emigrants, who, flying from their slavery at home, shall have found it waiting for them in their new paradise beyond the seas.\\n\\nThe world, it would appear, is a vast class-room, and its Creator but a professor of political economy, apparently unable to carry out his theories with effect.  Therefore, to us, the Western Europeans, he has turned for help, and upon us devolved the task of extirpating all those peoples upon whom he tried his 'prentice hand.  On us he laid injunctions to increase at home, and to the happier portions of the world to carry death under the guise of life unsuitable to those into whose lands we spread.\\n\\nLet those made cruel by the want of sympathy with men that the mere poring over books so often superinduces in the mind protest when judging of the Jesuits in Paraguay against the outrage done to their theories by the scheme the Jesuits pursued.\\n\\nIt has been nobly said\\\\* \\\\`that the extinction of the smallest animal is a far greater loss than if the works of all the Greeks had perished.' How much the greater loss that of a type of man such as the Indians, whom the semi-communistic Jesuit government successfully preserved, sheltering them from the death-dealing breath of our cold northern life and its full, fell effects!\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Hudson, \\\\`Naturalist in La Plata'. --\\n\\nThere are those, no doubt, who think that a tree brought from the tropics should be planted out at home, to take its chance of life in the keen winter of the north, in holy competition with the ash and oak; and if it dies, there are still pines enough, with stores of dogwood, thickets of elder, and a wilderness of junipers.  They may be right; but, after all, that which has felt the tropic sun is for the tropics, and to grow under the tantalizing sunshine of the north, which lights but does not warm, it must have glass, and shelter from the cold.\\n\\nBut of aforethought to deliberately transplant our fogs and chilling atmosphere, and so to nip and kill plants which crave only the sun to live, that is a crime against humanity; a crime posterity with execration will one day taunt us with, and hold us up to execration, as we to-day in our hypocrisy piously curse the memories of Pizarro and Cortes.\\n\\nIn the eternal warfare between those who think that progress -- which to them means tramways and electric light -- is preferable to a quiet life of futile happiness of mind there is scant truce, so that my readers have to take their choice whether to side with Funes or Azara in judging of the Jesuits' rule in Paraguay.  There is no middle course between the old and new; no halting-place; no chink in which imagination can drive in its nail to stop the wheels of time; therefore, no doubt, the Jesuit commonwealth was doomed to disappear.  But for myself, I am glad that five-and-twenty years ago I saw the Indians who still lingered about the ruined mission towns, mumbling their maimed rites when the Angelus at eventide awoke the echoes of the encroaching woods, whilst screeching crowds of parrots and macaws hovered around the date-palms which in the plaza reared their slender heads, silent memorials of the departed Jesuits' rule.\\n\\nIndians and Jesuits are gone from Paraguay, the Indians to that Trapalanda which is their appointed place; and for the Jesuits, they are forgotten, except by those who dive into old chronicles, or who write books, proposing something and concluding nothing, or by travellers, who, wandering in the Tarumensian woods, come on a clump of orange-trees run wild amongst the urundeys.\\n\\n```\\n                        FINIS NON CORONAT OPUS\\n```\\n\\nAbout the author:\\n\\nRobert Bontine Cunninghame Graham (1852-1936)\\n\\nBorn in London.
