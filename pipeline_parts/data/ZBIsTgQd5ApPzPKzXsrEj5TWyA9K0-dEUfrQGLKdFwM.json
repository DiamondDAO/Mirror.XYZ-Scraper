"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Today‚Äôs technology discourse is home to a loud demographic who equates decentralization to both blockchain applications and ‚ÄúWeb 3.0‚Äù. But these newly minted advocates don‚Äôt seem fully aware of the failures (and successes) of web decentralization projects that may not have had such buzz about them.\\n\\nHere is a just a brainstorm of some of my favorite projects over the years that made decentralization a critical element of their work.\\n\\n## The original WWW Proposal\\n\\nThe 1989/1990 braindump from Tim Berners Lee that became the basis for the world wide web. ‚ÄúNon-centralisation‚Äù was considered a requirement for its use at CERN.\\n\\n[https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html](https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html)\\n\\n## XMPP and Jabber, early instant messaging trailblazers\\n\\nMy first exposure to the XMPP protocol was through the hacker community‚Äôs insistence of its use. The open standard lent itself to helpful features like off-the-record (OTR) encrypted messaging and federated server deployments unique to the communities who used it.\\n\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP)\\n\\n## Limewire\\n\\nLimewire seems to elicit so many warm memories for people who at some point used the P2P software to listen to their favorite music. \\n\\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/comments/ap708n/limewire/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/comments/ap708n/limewire/)\\n\\n## Resilio Sync\\n\\nA project spun off of BitTorrent‚Äôs P2P protocol, Resilio is like an end-to-end encrypted P2P Dropbox. I love it! I just wish more people used it. üòÇ\\n\\n[https://www.resilio.com/individuals/](https://www.resilio.com/individuals/)\\n\\n## Apple AirDrop\\n\\nWhile by no means free and open source software, I have considerable respect for AirDrop for putting such an easy-to-use P2P file sharing application in the hands of millions of Apple product users.\\n\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirDrop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirDrop)\\n\\n## IPFS\\n\\nOne of the best parts of the recent blockchain obsession is that it had propelled further adoption of IPFS, or ‚ÄúInterplanetary Filesystem‚Äù, as cryptocurrency projects seek to make use of its decentralized storage capabilities to host static assets of their projects. \\n\\n[https://ipfs.io/](https://ipfs.io/)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1641348802,\"title\":\"My favorite decentralized projects, 1989-2015\"},\"digest\":\"Ebywpxk9Jr8naQuHT6PbleDbcOxRR9NWCN_0PpBlSaU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xcc9F38e801FdAd609Ec04D373B887060C939Bf32\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"WUHJj1BzPTlWW-XVYNNf4aBcrm1KmG-aFOYQuz_dPh4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"lqIe4OLJzdtPFt3LTAKtbKKrbx6afa6kUeRfSa-gXYM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"_PLl3dpEzg77i7hixNxZx8vzUCcGK2mGa3NA5Uta6r-OrwBeQQ1Xxfhd0CsXfOPSSBYmh5DW5Kgl54-AYprSzQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x7b864572a4c358d308376e126c1cb9f8639e35d82cc01a1496852b327eadb71122485d0dd8e1ef162b7bda17933475f7bd256bcfb567bb0cb05d0413fc14c6bf1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"WUHJj1BzPTlWW-XVYNNf4aBcrm1KmG-aFOYQuz_dPh4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"lqIe4OLJzdtPFt3LTAKtbKKrbx6afa6kUeRfSa-gXYM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Ebywpxk9Jr8naQuHT6PbleDbcOxRR9NWCN_0PpBlSaU\"}"
