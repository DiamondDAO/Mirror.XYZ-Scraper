"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"This book personally believe that the psychology of marketing interpersonal skills. Not to be missed! The following summary of the essence of the book in private, the rest of the book content is mostly examples or extended discussion of a point, or general knowledge, not included in the book summary:.\\n\\nWeapons of influence everything should be as simple as possible, but not too simple. ---Albert Einstein\\nFinding that \\\"clatter\\\" that we can control and perhaps effectively influence the behavior of others is the starting point for the author of Influence's greatest contribution. As Ma expresses it, when people who don't know him see his face, they jump to the conclusion that this person is a bad person. Because his face is like the so-called \\\"pattern\\\" of \\\"squeaking\\\" described here\\n\\nFirst, in most cases, this mechanical pattern of fixed behavior of the animal has worked well.\\nThe second thing we need to understand is that there are similar pre-recorded tapes in our bodies. Often, these tapes serve us well, but sometimes trigger traits can fool us into misplacing the tape.\\nA famous code of conduct says that when we ask for help, we are more likely to get it if we can give a reason. The word \\\"because\\\" also inspired a subconscious compliance response in Lange's subjects, even though the word \\\"because\\\" was not followed by any reason for their compliance. \\\"Click, wow!\\\" The tape played automatically.\\nIt didn't take long for them to translate this law into \\\"expensive = good\\\". This formula has always worked well in the past because, as a rule, the price of a good increases with its value, and the more expensive it is, the better the quality. So when they wanted to buy good quality turquoise jewelry, but had little knowledge of jewelry, they naturally relied on this formula to determine the value of the jewelry. The secret of their success lies in the fact that they know how to make requests and how to arm themselves with the weapons of influence of one kind or another that exist around them. Sometimes this can be done by simply choosing a word correctly. But that word has to be related to a powerful psychological principle and be able to place an autoplay tape inside us.\\nWhen this method works on unsuspecting tourists (which is often the case), she makes a huge profit. Even if this method doesn't work at first, she can label the items \\\"reduced from $XX to $XX\\\" and still sell them at the original price. When she does this, she is still taking advantage of the \\\"expensive = quality\\\" reaction that customers have to the inflated price (an even more sophisticated performance in China's antique, vintage, and curio markets, a technique that ancient Chinese civilizations have given the name \\\"Brother Pestle \\\".)\\nCharacteristics of the influence process.\\nOne is the almost mechanical process through which the inherent power of these weapons can be aroused.\\nThe second is how those who know how to excite the inherent power of these weapons use them.\\nAnd the third element has to do with the way in which these weapons of influence bestow their power on the user.\\n\\nRemember the following words: contrast, reciprocity, mutual concession, commitment and agreement, social acceptance, preference, authority, and shortage. These are the elements of influence, and they are central to the entire text.\\n\\n1. The Principle of Contrast\\n\\nIt affects our judgment of the difference between two things before and after. Simply put, if two things are very different, we tend to think that the difference between them is greater than it actually is. (First look at the expensive, then look at the cheap; first look at the poor, then look at the good)\\n\\n1. Principle of reciprocity\\n\\nThe principle of reciprocity believes that we should try to repay others for what they have done for us in the same way. If a person gives us a birthday gift, we should remember his birthday and wait until his birthday to buy him a gift. If a couple invites us to a party, we must also remember to invite them to the party we are hosting. So, because of the reciprocity principle, we feel obligated to return favors, gifts, invitations, etc., that we have received at some point in the future. One of the most impressive aspects of the reciprocity principle and the sense of responsibility that goes with it is that they are almost ubiquitous in human civilization.\\nWhat plays an important role in the kind of social progress described by Tiger and Fox is precisely the sense of responsibility to repay others in the future.\\nStart by offering to give something to the other person, a very natural benefit, and you will be rewarded in an unexpected way. How to apply this principle in your life, in your work. How to offer to give someone some benefit, some unexpected benefit to them. Some uninvited benefits. Many of us always ignore the big greeting we get from the flight attendants when we normally fly, but if you give them a special return after what has become a customary greeting, or show a simple thank you for their hard work, then he will definitely give you extra care during the subsequent air travel. Many of my colleagues who travel with me have learned this the hard way. Once we praised the charm of the clerk in front of us at the beginning of check-in, and as a result, she gave my colleague a card for a large family room worth $60. My colleague was very surprised, and after thinking about it, he said that he should travel with me more often in the future. In fact, this is a technique that everyone can apply. Take the initiative to praise each other's obvious merits and excellent performance, and after that, the other party will take the initiative to assist you within his or her ability, which is how reciprocity works in real life. (e.g. free trials in supermarkets)\\nEspecially in ordinary daily life, with a little creative and clever use, you can always get conscious and unconscious care from people around you. Such people must be those who live in the center of happiness.\\nAn important reason for this is the unpleasant character of the sense of indebtedness. Most of us have discovered that the feeling of debt can be extremely unpleasant for us. It weighs so heavily on our minds that we have to get rid of it.\\nEven if people do have some kind of need, they often try to avoid asking for help if they feel they have trouble giving back. This is not at all surprising, quite simply because they would rather suffer a material loss than carry a psychological burden. People sometimes refuse gifts and help from others for fear that they may have other losses later.\\n\\n1. Mutual concessions\\n\\nThe principle of reciprocity says that if a person behaves a certain way toward us, we should reciprocate with similar behavior. Another consequence of this principle is that if others make concessions to us, we are obligated to make concessions as well. We refer to this simple technique as the \\\"deny-concession\\\" strategy. Suppose you want me to say yes to one of your requests, there is a way to help you greatly improve your success rate: you start with a larger request that I will most likely deny, and then, after I have denied it, you make a smaller request that you are really interested in. If you make the second request tactfully, it will make me think that this second request is a concession you are making, and therefore make me feel obligated to make a corresponding concession. I now have the opportunity to agree to your second request.\\nUnder the influence of the \\\"deny-concede\\\" strategy, people not only agree to fulfill their promises, but also voluntarily agree to further requests.\\nOf course, we know that they did not play this role, is the experimental host asked his assistant whatever the experimental subjects do, he has to gradually make concessions. But in the view of these subjects, they are the opponents to make changes, they are the opponents to make concessions.\\n(There is a Chinese proverb: hitting a man without smiling! A thousand wears, a horse's ass does not wear. Because, people are under pressure when they encounter a smiley face, people are smiling, how can they be serious? Even if the seriousness of the treatment, there will be guilt inside later, this is the habit, people's inner inherent consciousness. (I think this also includes the principle of contrast.)\\n\\n1. Commitment and consistency\\n\\nOnce we have made a decision or chosen a position, we face pressure from both personal and external sources to align our words and actions with it. Under this pressure, we will act in a certain way to justify the decision we made before. Social psychologists believe they have found the answer, and it is commitment. If I can get you to make a commitment (that is, to choose a certain position), I have set the stage for your next step of mechanical, unconscious consistency. Once a position has been chosen, it is a natural tendency to stubbornly stick to it. Those who have just made it clear that everything is fine with them (even if this is done simply for social reasons) can make themselves feel very embarrassed if they appear to be stingy next. Give the client something first, get a small commitment, such as agreeing to meet, agreeing to refer other clients, and only then move on to a more lasting relationship. China's interpersonal society requires even more effective and manipulative strategies to achieve the salesperson's objectives.\\nThe first deal is even smaller, because our purpose is not to make money, but to gain the commitment of the other party. Once the commitment is obtained, more business, even bigger business, will naturally come from that commitment. This strategy of starting with a small request in order to get the other person to agree to something bigger and relevant is called \\\"baiting the enemy first\\\".\\nIf a child writes down what he promises to do, he is much more likely to do it than if he does not write it down. This is because written promises are more likely to be consistent.\\n\\nIf a coworker is given public praise for a good behavior, then he is far more likely to do a similar behavior next time than if he is not publicly praised. This is a technique that can be effectively applied to consistency in business organizational behavior.\\n\\nThe fear that something may be lost usually occurs after people recognize such a thing. So, across the board, it is consistency that should match the shortage of pressure and thus behavior.\\nHere, people feel differently about the activity they are participating in or the action they are taking. Once he agrees to a request, his attitude will change and he will become the kind of person he has in mind. He will agree to a stranger's request, he will act on what he believes in, and he will strongly support what is right. I am now no longer willing to sign petitions, even for positions that I support. This is because such a move might not only affect my future behavior, but it would also change my self-image in a way that I might not have wanted. Once a person's self-image has changed, it creates opportunities for those who want to exploit that new image.\\nA truly advanced marketing strategy does not unfold for the immediate, but is a process of layout, through which the layout can target the market environment two months later, thus creating a coherent marketing strategy. Marketing, is to use a variety of psychological principles of inertia to win the unwitting recognition and purchase of consumers, which is the marketing strategy without war.\\n\\nA person's behavior than words can reveal his true thoughts, so people often make judgments about a person by observing his behavior. We use the same basis to judge what kind of person we are, and our behavior tells us everything we need to know about ourselves. That is, behavior is the primary basis on which people use to judge their beliefs, values, and attitudes.\\nPeople value those things that are hard-won more than those things that can be obtained with little effort. As long as people continue to value and believe in what they have worked so hard to obtain, these groups will continue to use these laborious and cumbersome initiation rituals. The loyalty and dedication of those who go through these rituals to become members greatly enhances the group's cohesiveness and viability. (Such as Skull and Bones harsh initiation system, and the famous companies waste time without six rounds of interviews, the purpose is the same)\\n\\nConvincing connoisseurs are extremely fond of promises that bring about a change in our hearts. First, this inner change doesn't happen only in that initial environment, but in many related environments as well. Second, this inner change is lasting. That is, this inner change will \\\"grow its own legs. (Under-pricing, allowing customers to make their own purchase choices from within rather than from external pressure)\\n\\n**Social identity**\\n\\nThis principle states that one of the criteria we use to make judgments about right and wrong is how others think, especially when we are trying to decide what is the right behavior. Obviously, the social identity principle is more effective when the behavior of many other people is taken as a proof. (e.g. following the crowd, following the stars)\\n\\nThat is, to remove the uncertainty from yourself, others may be observing the reactions of others as well. Especially when the situation is ambiguous, this tendency for everyone to want to see what others are doing can lead to an interesting phenomenon called \\\"pluralistic ignorance\\\". (That's why there is this \\\"crowd watching the mob committing violence and no one helping\\\" scenario)\\nWhen there are several people around who might help, each person's sense of responsibility decreases: \\\"Maybe someone else will help, maybe someone else has already done it.\\\" The second reason is even more interesting. It is based on the principle of social identity and is related to the pluralistic ignorance effect. Sometimes it's not easy to judge whether something is urgent or not. This is partly because we like to appear calm and old-fashioned in the face of heavy responsibilities\\nSimilarity: The social identity principle works best when we see others behaving exactly as we ourselves do. Role models must be similar, as is the case with the reasoning that beggars do not envy kings.\\n\\nThe social identity principle is most effective in those who are unfamiliar with or unsure of the situation and must therefore look to the outside world for approval.\\n\\n**Preferences**\\n\\nPeople are always willing to agree to requests from people they know and like, which should be natural and no one should be surprised by it. In the process of selling, effectively imitating the other person's way of speaking, repeating the words used by the other person will be appreciated by the other person, which will make them want to talk with you and thus be beneficial for closing the deal.\\n\\nThe preference principle can also be effective even if the friend is not present. In many cases, it is enough to mention the friend's name\\n\\n**Factors that make people like you**\\n\\n1. attractiveness of appearance \\\"halo benefit\\\".\\n2. similarity (views, personality, background, lifestyle, interests, religious beliefs, political views), and\\n3. praise (he said he liked me), and\\n4. contact and cooperation, familiarity (we like what we are used to, because the familiarity of something makes people subconsciously like it, the fact that they have contact with things will be more favorable to such a fact, for the common goal of cooperation), and\\n5. the principle of association (people associate certain things with what they like, certain things associate. Subjects will be more fond of the people and things they experienced while eating, thus it seems that we always want the sports team associated with us to win the game as a way to prove our superiority. But who do we want to prove this to? To ourselves, of course, but also to prove it to others. According to the principle of association, if we can surround ourselves with success, even if we are only superficially related to it (from the same place of residence, for example), our prestige in the public eye will increase). There is another way to gain the goodwill of others, It's about being familiar with all the prestigious brands and introducing them effectively and subtly to others. Because goodwill can be established through something external and already ingrained in people's minds that has a good feeling. As soon as that association is established, goodwill is also established. (See how important it is to be familiar with the brand element)\\n\\n   **Typical symbols of authority**\\n   1. title. Such as a professor at a certain university, status and height are directly linked.\\n   2. clothing. Clothing that has always been associated with authority status: a well-cut suit. \\\"He wore a stiff white shirt and shiny black leather shoes; the style of the suit was not very fashionable, but classical: 3-inch-wide lapels, no more, no less; even in July, the fabric of the suit was of the heavy kind; the shades were also very dignified: dark blue, gray, black.\\\"\\n   3. external markings. In addition to having the function of a uniform, a suit can also be a more general sign of authority as a decoration. Fine and expensive clothes carry a special air of symbolic power and status, just like jewelry and cars. People who own prestigious cars are more respected.\\n\\n   **Shortage Principle:** The fewer the opportunities, the higher the value. The fear of losing something is a greater motivator than the hope of getting something of equal value.\\n\\n   \\n   People always aspire to the impossible (the mentality of tasting forbidden fruit), and we react to restricted information just as we would elsewhere; we perceive restricted information as more valuable. The scoop is the most compelling information.\\n\\n   \\n   When supply changes from plentiful to short, people have a more positive reaction to the cookie than they would have if supply had been short. We are most likely to see revolution and unrest when economic and social conditions, after a period of development, are followed by a short but sharp setback.\\n   Not only does the fact that something is in short supply make us want it more, but when we have to compete to get it, our desire to get it is even stronger. Take, for example, auction bidding.\\n\\n   \\n   Numbers are scarce, deadlines are met, and opportunities are precious.\",\"timestamp\":1639289636,\"title\":\"Review on the 《Influence》\"},\"digest\":\"1LAXxOUKJoAXR2h_qfsEMI7fuopg-SLN8_jl5TZpSho\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x896002E29FE4CDa28A3ae139b0bf7bAc26B33a8C\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"KTjUoeqP_G02VlJV9UxRzvazcx6ELsOvUpq0xg4sNZE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"PX3rKYMppynyZuYWHMAURp3ZhkerJD3vWuwmu7PnwvA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ZT0PBLtEY0fZjnGcla9Vkoc0v2Gzm3OUu73C9YqVEO4Qgvg67gy3rajBCsbForWLku3ubfL39qPbHEIbYKzWHA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd37f4ba2ec5e6a0e10ebf4965b242c7018b19e5367f780aeb82e12f9e55c3e9e4053930e9ef78729492391dcbc0dc6a6bfc6ecee20bbaf899036dc172691548c1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"KTjUoeqP_G02VlJV9UxRzvazcx6ELsOvUpq0xg4sNZE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"PX3rKYMppynyZuYWHMAURp3ZhkerJD3vWuwmu7PnwvA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"1LAXxOUKJoAXR2h_qfsEMI7fuopg-SLN8_jl5TZpSho\"}"
