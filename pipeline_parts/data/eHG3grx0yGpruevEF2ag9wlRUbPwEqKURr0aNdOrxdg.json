"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"> **In order to move forward we must be creative. More specifically, coming together to create fresh new ideas. It doesn’t matter what field you are in: you will get the best results when people are working together on something they truly believe in.**\\n\\nDuring the start of the pandemic, one of our core founders, Hugh, was invited to live in two different programming communes with other professionals in tech. There, he felt first hand how powerful it could be to temporarily live with extraordinary people on a shared mission. While the two house arrangements had been for developers, he couldn't help but wonder, \\\"Wouldn't it be dope to have this same setup but for artists and musicians?\\\"\\n\\nHence, KTLO was formed between three childhood friends who believed in combining artist-retreat style collaboration with web3 tech.\\n\\nGeorge (a producer,) Brandon (an artist,) and Hugh (an engineer,) came together to create “Keep The Lights On.” Conceptually we are in our early stages, but the foundation we are building is to create a community of people who will work together to create AMAZING things.\\n\\nWith that in mind we present our first event and output: KTLO1. Six artists from around the country were invited to Scottsdale, Arizona to make an EP in five days- all while living in the same house together. Depending on how you look at it, this might seem challenging, but the experience was actually so successful that the most challenging part of the week was narrowing down the music made in those five days to a 7 song product. Over 20 songs were created over all. Seeing the way this group of people from all different walks of life and different genres of music were able to come together to create sonics that meshed so well & made so much sense was nothing short of legendary (& that’s us being objective).\\n\\nThe mission of KTLO is to build a strong community & dynamic environments for creators who are in tune with this spirit of collaboration, while simultaneously eliminating as many digital/physical constraints for artists as possible. As we move into web3, the technology will allow for multiplayer projects, and we (KTLO) want to be the catalyst for facilitating this.\\n\\nWe have decided to present the works made during that formative week in a NFT. With the purchase of the NFT you will receive access to the EP, our first edition KTLO1 hoodie, and a digital look book that visually sums up our process from the initial formation of KTLO to the making of the EP in Arizona. There are also plans for a documentary in the future.\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubsGFC2yZb0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubsGFC2yZb0)\\n\\nIn addition to purchasing the KTLO1 NFT, owners will be airdropped governance tokens after the official launch of our KTLO DAO, dropping in the first half of 2022. This will give you say in the future of our creative and collaborative efforts, and you can tell folks that you were a part of music's web3 future right at the very beginning. We want to host more live/work experiences for artists and to change the way music is made in the modern age. We'd like to invite you to the party first.\\n\\nThis is only the beginning, and with the purchase of this NFT you become a member of the KTLO family forever- wherever this journey takes us.\\n\\nIf you have any question or concerns please reach out to hello@ktlo.in\\n\\n[Click here to listen KTLO1 Extended Play](https://ktlo.in/one) **(NFT purchase required)**\\n\\n[Click here to se KTLO1 Lookbook](https://ktlo.in/one/lookbook) **(NFT purchase required)**\\n\\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=1393](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=1393)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1642297025,\"title\":\"KTLO1\"},\"digest\":\"FSC7nuzMo6Z9xr3gMIZGOqR6rL1_RGf99hgPLAIImYA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x854f5fe9cbED298602c6d98ee9735d7fD9f82Cc6\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fLDK3kXDgAWC7HQbv_i9j0aXzJwM4xnyTbmfqYsPRZ8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dzNWMRKlE9KTw-J7_5n2_awRwt9kh0bL6sM-X0qXd_w\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"zh_1qC3PppDYlOMaEZLI7Qg7qkEbUdvw7Qq8UelxAFnkd-rJxxb7aacmft_fKbec5UeMnqKvK7YYkrGaMVaQHw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x68ce422cd54bef9dec459e2676ea94acf9e6ea64b84bc68481031b5621bcba7a431114924ae4f516e3486296bdc044ae165fa17a71c6f6c38f635c626ff95a851c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fLDK3kXDgAWC7HQbv_i9j0aXzJwM4xnyTbmfqYsPRZ8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dzNWMRKlE9KTw-J7_5n2_awRwt9kh0bL6sM-X0qXd_w\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"PCTWxkJ5goOS0bRVG-UqDTglPxyhBKGDoPKiKCL6JN4\"}"
