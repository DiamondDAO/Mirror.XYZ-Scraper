"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**What is ENS?** \\n\\nThe Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. ENS maps human-readable names like ‘kene.eth’ to machine-readable identifiers. Instead of using your Ethereum wallet address, ENS allows you to send and receive payments via your .eth domain name.  \\n\\n## A step-by-step guide on how to register your ENS domain. \\n\\nBefore being able to register you ENS domain, you need to: \\n\\n1. Pick a domain name that you want to register. Remember, this will be a uniquely identifiable domain that will link back to your ethereum wallet, so choose wisely. \\n2. Pick out the wallet address that you want your domain name to apply to. This address will also serve as the owner of your domain.\\n3. Ensure that you have a Metamask wallet with some ETH inside. You will need this to pay for the ENS domain. \\n\\n## Step 1: Checking if your domain name is available \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VBoXeMbxt7dN8L1-D94qB.JPG?height=470&width=1125)\\n\\n* Open your MetaMask wallet and make sure that it is on the “Ethereum Main Network.”\\n\\n\\n* Once you’ve confirmed that your Metamask wallet is on the mainnet, head over to the official [ENS domain name manager](https://manager.ens.domains/) and search for your proposed domain name.\\n  * Note: If your domain name is not available, this means that it has already been purchased. You can offer funds to the person who bought the domain name that you want.\\n\\n\\n* Click on the domain name that you would like to purchase. Your screen should look like this:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/N6Mg-FKz3cJfM41mNCT-G.PNG?height=427&width=1882)\\n\\n## Step 2: Purchasing your ENS domain\\n\\nIt’s important to note that ENS domain names are not bought, they are rented. At this point in the process, you will need to decide how long you want to rent your ENS domain name for because that will determine how much you pay for it. \\n\\n* Fill in the amount of time you would like to rent your ENS domain for in the “Registration Period” section of the page. \\n* Click “Request to Register.” \\n* Connect your wallet to pay for the purchase and confirm the transaction. After completing this step, your screen should look like this:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BfF9jSLmyTvwbbmRe4DK8.PNG?height=307&width=1591)\\n\\n* Click “Register” to enable the transaction that is required to pay for your rented ENS domain name. \\n  * Note: This transaction will have a gas fee attached to it. You can think of gas fees like shipping costs, they are used to compensate for the computing energy required to process and validate blockchain transactions. \\n\\n## Step 3: Connecting your ENS domain to your wallet address\\n\\n* Click on the “Manage Name” button at the bottom of your screen \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Kj5mNohddJKh05aLYoLv4.JPG?height=208&width=1080)\\n\\n* Click the “Set” button that sits on the same line as the resolver address.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/byKp28X42tgXZldYfPmhQ.JPG?height=288&width=1080)\\n\\n* Click “Use Public Resolver.” This will translate your human readable domain name into machine readable language that the blockchain can understand, this is the process that turns your domain name into an address.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-BYswlK_xrirUEQJzL7MD.JPG?height=146&width=1080)\\n\\n* Click on the “+” button and a drop down selection should appear. Select “address,” then copy and paste the ethereum address you’d like to shorten into your ENS domain name. Click “Save.” \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/K0Ix6IC7khxfskwBKQFkI.jpeg?height=298&width=1571)\\n\\n* If done correctly, you should receive a notification that requires you to set a reverse record. This is used to further confirm the transaction. Your screen should look like this: \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GLMGkhLWibFSSXt5oyEYd.PNG?height=401&width=1520)\\n\\n* Once you are certain that the address you pasted previously is the address you want shortened into the domain name, click the “Save” button. \\n* Once completed, your screen should look like this: \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/w5DiD0NAz0zYPRnV7GweE.PNG?height=118&width=686)\\n\\n**Note: You can transfer your domain to another address, setting up a domain name is not a permanent decision.**\\n\\nCongratulations on registering your ENS domain name! Now you can easily send and receive tokens and other assets like NFT’s with your .eth address. No more copy and pasting alphanumeric wallet addresses! \\n\\nCheck out our Mirror Articles for more helpful guides.\\n\\n[https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/)\\n\\nYou can also follow us on twitter to engage with all things Crypto and Web3.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/rabbithole_gg](https://twitter.com/rabbithole_gg)\\n\\nSee you DAOn the Rabbithole. \\n \",\"timestamp\":1639414749,\"title\":\"How to Register an ENS Domain\"},\"digest\":\"nbLE75AwLcrPudA6kNX9JOaXIMRycXK4_df-ThdPxwE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xcDCF5D22BD56128f9299F28394037752B3BD7650\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"UO2DqI0RvW2W3KKjnCo2AHXSeXnqeaDVdViLgJbc_sE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"hvkKpZ8paTVaKNsepiYtjzIeWjhBxZ2LqIlsgkTlCoQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"DGl84GcXEp0sFZd2sbdLeAmnIG6xiKmnujsSP_MBPbtaEI2Oz-gAQ5Wex703J722xnXj92CBNZB7-dWPS1H5Tg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x36e2e80719b8c036c0d3fcdd1ab018d168d5535b6b9c49c2bd01900248237f65786bf006022edf53a578560bf6c2a2b5c9d48fbee32369fcfcd9a1d2b90581321c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"UO2DqI0RvW2W3KKjnCo2AHXSeXnqeaDVdViLgJbc_sE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"hvkKpZ8paTVaKNsepiYtjzIeWjhBxZ2LqIlsgkTlCoQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"nbLE75AwLcrPudA6kNX9JOaXIMRycXK4_df-ThdPxwE\"}"
