"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## The creator is the platform. Beem offers creators the most advanced video and NFT tools in one place to create new content and experiences, engage and grow their community, monetize their craft, and bring their fans into the Open Metaverse, while maintaining control over their intellectual property.\\n\\n### Beem is a tokenized virtual venue and toolkit for interactive live events, video distribution, community engagement and content monetization.\\n\\n![live events on Beem](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yyYL0QsAjACPwofKUhDZ7.png?height=1687&width=2817)\\n\\nOn Beem, creators can **upload their content**, **distribute it** easily for free or for a fee, and **create interactive live events** in a few clicks with full ticketing management. They can invite guests and fans on stage and interact seamlessly with their communities via live video and chat. Participants can join from any device (desktop browser, iOS and Android apps) and easily cast the show to their TV through Airplay or Chromecast. Creators can also stream their event to other platforms such as YouTube Live, Twitch or Facebook Live to reach the largest audience possible and bring those followers into their own space on Beem **for more interaction and greater monetization**. The content created during these live events is recorded and then available to be replayed. Creators can get paid in cash or in crypto, as we natively accept both forms of payment. Soon, each piece of content, event ticket and content access key created on Beem will be an **[NFT](https://digiday.com/media/wtf-is-an-nft/)** (Non-Fungible Token, a unique digital asset representing a certificate of ownership or access to an assigned item), unlocking real content ownership and direct fandom relationships.\\n\\nWe started working on Beem in early 2018 (stealth name: Unchained, check out our [whitepaper](https://assets.website-files.com/5ffe37090082ae5274693991/6170a559e360594446e4a950_Unchained%20WP%20-%20V%201.2.pdf)) on the principle that **NFTs will power [Web3](https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b)**, the next evolution of the digital economy, thanks to tokenized content ownership, decentralized intellectual property rights management, programmatic royalties and digital collectibles.\\n\\n![let's quickly skip to the ownership economy please](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ooadBOm38DTtH6cDpy5op.png?height=1155&width=2056)\\n\\nWe knew that the video space was the most promising to apply these concepts, and we set our aim at creating a complete **blockchain-based video platform** for creators and their communities. But we soon realized that the Web3 technologies were not mature and scalable enough for mass-market deployment and adoption. We decided to start by building the most challenging part of the platform, a state-of-the-art high-performance, low latency video stack with live content and ticketing management systems. We created it, launched it, and market-proved it.  \\n **Creators and audiences alike loved it!**\\n\\n \\n In the last 12 months, creators have been using [Beem](https://watchbeem.com/) to **host live concerts**, **podcast recordings**, **interactive workshops**, **film premieres** and festivals with **live Q&As**, and **engaging fundraisers**. Beem has provided a unique stage for thousands of public and private events, with tens of thousands of user registrations, and dozens of thousands USD raised for nonprofits and cultural projects. We gained invaluable feedback from both our creators and their communities. We discovered that after experiencing a **unified toolkit** like Beem, creators don’t plan to go back to the messy patchwork of Zoom, YouTube Live, Vimeo, Streamyard, Eventbrite, Mailchimp, Patreon, and the dozen other tools they currently use to grow their business, connect with their communities and distribute and monetize their content. \\n \\n\\n```\\n<div style=\\\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\\\"><iframe src=\\\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/639859358?h=032012caef&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen style=\\\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\\\" title=\\\"Zoom vs. Beem\\\"></iframe></div><script src=\\\"https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js\\\"></script>\\n```\\n\\nEstablished creators and businesses can also choose to use our white-label solution and fully customize their space with their **own URL, identity, branding, content, and events**. They have direct access to their audience with tools to engage and interact with, as well as analytics to know everything about their live events performance, content distribution, and expected income while **maintaining ownership over their content**.\\n\\n## Entering the ownership economy\\n\\n \\n Who actually owns the content on the internet? Where is it stored? How can we verify its IP (Intellectual Property) ownership? Many creators are getting their accounts [deleted without explanation](https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1447629947284099077), or their content gets suddenly demonetized. This means the abrupt end of their revenue stream, of their community, and potentially of the entire personal brand and the business they worked hard to build over years. Protecting and controlling their content storage, their online presence (audience and community) and their IP (assets, brand, identity) have now become paramount to them.\\n\\nWe strongly believe that NFTs will be progressively adopted as the **leading standard** to solve most of the shortfalls of **digital media**, **content ownership**, and **monetization**:\\n\\n* Content distribution from centralized gatekeeping platforms is being replaced by **direct-to-fan distribution** with creators being their own platform, only using tech infrastructures such as Beem as underlying distribution protocols\\n* As automatically-enforced **social contracts**, NFTs and social tokens allow communities to gather around common passions, interests and goals, and profit from it socially and potentially financially, without being tied to a specific platform. The traditional 20th-century marketing approach is replaced by **community building** where fans become genuine stakeholders of a creator’s work by contributing time and money at every step of the creative process. They do so in exchange for a stake, ownership, royalties, revenues, and **social signalling** along with **privileges** inside the community such as exclusive events, premium content **unlocking**, loyalty and **fanship** systems, and participation in the creator’s decisions ([VeeFriends](https://nftevening.com/veefriends-how-gary-vee-made-utility-the-new-thing-with-his-top-nft-collection/) is an example of this) \\n* As digital assets that can be minted (created) by anyone with proven and guaranteed **scarcity** and verifiable source of **provenance**, **ownership** and **historicity**, NFTs allow the market to put a value on a digital item and can command a premium for rarity and scarcity with high demand \\n \\n\\nAt Beem, we are now deploying NFT [smart contracts](https://chain.link/education/smart-contracts) at the core of our system to create a **seamless interface** between the performance and usability of Web2 and the [ownership economy](https://variant.fund/writing/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software) enabled by Web3. We started on the Ethereum blockchain, but we believe in a **multi-chain future** and are already integrating other chains and [Layer 2s](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrency-layer-2-scaling-solutions). By allowing creators to mint NFTs with the metadata stored on decentralized storage like IPFS and Arweave, Beem will offer a streamlined and **transparent IP ownership solution for video creators** who want to securely store and distribute their content. The content (media + metadata) is interoperable and doesn't depend on a centralized infrastructure, so the creator is in full control of it.\\n\\n![high level view of the decentralized infrastructure](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M2VNw3aDodvt6DL8jrZEi.png?height=1022&width=1409)\\n\\nAs for the monetization, Beem already offers multiple solutions to creators (both in crypto and [fiat](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp)): **ticketing**, **pay-per-view**, **tips** and **fundraising**, brands **sponsorships**, and soon **token-gating** (NFTs and social tokens) with fan **subscriptions**, digital **collectibles**, and physical **merch** stores. As we progressively deploy our smart contracts, we will add new ways for creators to automatically **split revenues** and royalties between different participants, enabling the creation of **media Distributed Autonomous Organizations** ([DAOs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyhackl/2021/06/01/what-are-daos-and-why-you-should-pay-attention/)).\\n\\n## The video stack of the Open Metaverse\\n\\n \\n In 2021 NFTs went mainstream as more and more people and [large corporations](https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/spongebob-nft-viacomcbs-recur-1235088069/#!) understand their use and foresee their potential. Indeed, NFTs can carry multiple characteristics and underlying values: **characters** more or less **exclusive** and valued ([Bored Apes](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bored-ape-yacht-club-the-celebrity-nft-of-choice), [Cool Cats](https://www.coolcatsnft.com/), etc.), **virtual real estate** (in [SandBox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/) maybe next to [SnoopDogg’s mansion](https://medium.com/sandbox-game/the-sandbox-partners-with-snoop-dogg-to-bring-legendary-rapper-into-the-metaverse-e064e866ed40) - owned by himself), a piece of **generative art** ([Art Blocks](https://www.artblocks.io/) collections) or a **music album** (from [3LAU](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/3lau-streaming-rights-royalties-nft-crypto-marketplace-1230638/) for example). They become (part of) your **online identity** and signal your passion and emotional attachment while allowing you to access communities with special privileges - your VIP entry to a global club.\\n\\n![do you have your Snoop Dogg private party pass?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YiCMGSDpRUf0iddDHJZ4g.png?height=433&width=691)\\n\\nWhen combined with **enhanced visualization** (virtual worlds, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality), **gamification** (open games, play-to-earn), content & personal **brand creation** (creators economy), and **decentralization** (democratized and permissionless playfield) with **digital asset ownership** it all converges into the so-called **Open Metaverse**, the shared virtual space where digital assets and identities are interconnected and fluid. \\n **Blockchains are the fabric of those universes and NFTs are the building blocks.**\\n\\nAt Beem, we believe that NFTs will be a crucial part of the toolbox of every video creator, curator and influencer as most communities are evolving to much richer experiences happening in live interactive virtual events. Soon on Beem, creators and their communities will be able to create token-gated events and content: only people with a specific token in their wallet will be able to access them, creating a stronger sense of community for all the holders. Anyone will be able to showcase their NFTs on stage, use them as their avatar or 3D model on camera, in the chat and in their profile, maintaining their Metaverse identities inside their virtual communities. Beem’s long-term engagement is to continuously enrich the platform to allow deeper cultural and technical integrations for more pervasive Metaverse experiences. \\n\\n## Take ownership of Beem\\n\\n \\n Beem sits at the intersection of **3 markets in hypergrowth**: the **creators economy** ([$100B+](https://influencermarketinghub.com/creator-earnings-benchmark-report/), +50% YoY), **live virtual events** ([$100B](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/virtual-events-market), expected to grow at a 24% CAGR for the next 6 years), and **NFTs** (probably [>25B$ in 2021](https://www.reuters.com/article/fintech-nft-q3-idCAKBN2GU298), growing x275 YoY). Beem generates revenues through a commission model that is a fair and transparent model for everyone: we charge up to 15% on ticket sales and video revenues, with a reduced commission for collectibles and merch, fundraising, and additional revenue streams. We also charge a monthly fee to creators and businesses who upgrade to a customized white-labeled environment (called BeemPro).\\n\\nOur globally distributed team comes from a partnership between [Grey Juice Lab](https://www.greyjuicelab.com/about), a worldwide market leader in **video distribution** and **content licensing**, and [3SS](https://www.3ss.tv/), the most advanced multi-device carrier-grade video platform provider, led by entrepreneurs with strong experience in consumer-facing video services and crypto products. To experiment with premium content, we reached licensing deals with Major Studios such as **Paramount** for their most iconic titles to be used during fan-produced live interactive experiences.\\n\\nWe are here for the long run, with a 10 year vision: becoming the **leading video content and talent marketplace of Web3**. We envision a suite of decentralized protocols managing how any piece of digital content can be bought, rented, prepaid, crowdfunded, leased, staked, [fractionalized](https://fractional.art/), marketed, distributed and monetized in multiple ways, in a direct interaction between creators, brands, and their fans and communities. To allow creators to coordinate the creation of content, Beem will also make it easy to find talent, contract them, collaborate with them live on video and give them immediate shared ownership over the content and its attached revenue streams through media DAOs. Communities will then get rewarded to participate in the [content curation process](https://hackernoon.com/what-are-token-curated-registries-and-decentralized-lists-d33fa42ba167) as well as the marketing of this content.\\n\\nNow the best part: **we want you to be part of our journey toward becoming the most vibrant Web3 video ecosystem**. Our objective is to raise $10M in the coming year to execute on our bold vision. On top of VCs, it is of paramount importance for us to give you, our early community, the ability to invest and get your fair share of Beem’s success. Likewise, we’ve reserved equity to reward Beem’s most committed creators. **It’s time for creators to become stakeholders in their means of production!** If we are to make Beem a huge success, we want this success to be shared.\\n\\nFor that reason, we’ve launched a [rolling SAFE](https://blog.fairmint.co/a-new-era-of-high-resolution-fundraising-the-rolling-safe-1fb67eee68ab), available today on [invest.watchbeem.com](https://invest.watchbeem.com/). It behaves like a traditional [SAFE](https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/) (Simple Agreement for Future Equity - a model pioneered by Y Combinator), except that it’s continuous, i.e. there are no rounds happening every now and then, reserved for a select few. Indeed, we wanted our rolling SAFE to be as inclusive and fair as possible:\\n\\n* **Inclusive**: our rolling SAFE never closes, it is literally always open for investment. You can invest today, tomorrow, in a few months or next year\\n* **Fair**: the earlier you invest, the more attractive valuation you’ll secure. To reward earlier investors, the valuation of our rolling SAFE increases as we raise more money\\n\\nIf you want to be part of the greatest journey to reinvent video creation, distribution and monetization for Web3, don’t delay: [join us today](https://invest.watchbeem.com/).\\n\\nInvestments can be made through bank transfers, as well as in crypto (BTC, ETH, USDC). All the documents can be accessed and signed online, so in 10 min you can become an investor in Beem. Additionally, you have full visibility in real-time of the value of the company, how much was raised to date, and from how many investors.\\n\\nParticipation in Beem comes with full transparency: we’re building in public, and anyone can take part in our daily discussions, get a first peek at our new features, help us bootstrap the content curation process, or request a free demo by joining us on our Discord 👉  [watchbeem.com/discord](https://watchbeem.com/discord)\\n\\nAlso, **we’re hiring** 👋\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1635447801,\"title\":\"Web3 video ecosystem for the ownership economy ✨\"},\"digest\":\"rbIsxr_OEDyhOMEX8UsDYyL-m_IR6mRM8CgopLTOkpI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x42a63047a1cD8449e3E70aDEB7363C4Ca01DB528\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bqUraqqO4yWk3fVuewDBmAayuMGZeO8nN7CIRbS1EMg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"a-uVvIqFPVzOkFkSb2aEzTYS4-LZONKP60T3qM3GAS8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"dIATTrP4FzEdxlsQFGTFwqIbf7p4unt03O9y5zCBNo92ddFc7Xpi-EzhUakiewz8HPBNjpQefxRRMARqzziDYQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd82554adc890e172427c14b0b68ab64270546cd93fbb38880906e84b7a06ec8d1166d1ed1d0a3d4087e11af36d0ab8e7f9662055b2d65921563973c61ea967221b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bqUraqqO4yWk3fVuewDBmAayuMGZeO8nN7CIRbS1EMg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"a-uVvIqFPVzOkFkSb2aEzTYS4-LZONKP60T3qM3GAS8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rbIsxr_OEDyhOMEX8UsDYyL-m_IR6mRM8CgopLTOkpI\"}"
