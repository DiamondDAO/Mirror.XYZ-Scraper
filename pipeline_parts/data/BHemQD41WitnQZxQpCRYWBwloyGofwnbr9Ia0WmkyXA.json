"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"In fact, as early as 2010, I heard about Bitcoin and installed the Bitcoin client. At that time, I only needed to click on the mining options on the client to mine. The small notes I used were mine for a day. I haven’t dug it, and I don’t know if there is a mining pool. According to the understanding at the time, I thought it could not replace the traditional currency, that is, the legal currency, because the legal currency is controlled by the government, which is the fundamental interest of the government, and the government holds the military power. Bitcoin has no future at all, so it is not taken seriously. Later It was gradually forgotten. \\n\\nIt was in December last year that the price of Bitcoin experienced a hundred-fold surge and was hit by the central bank, and I heard about it again. I have to be interested in such a phenomenon, why is a virtual currency that seems to have no future, so much sought after by so many people? Later, I read the book \\\"Out of Control\\\" written by Kevin Kelly. This distributed cryptocurrency is an inevitable trend of future development. Even if Bitcoin fails, there will inevitably be a new currency with similar properties.   \\n\\nThis is my experience, I am about to hoard a little bit of bitcoin, but the price is a bit high at the moment, but it doesn’t matter, hoarding a few mbtc is also good, it may give me unexpected surprises in the future.\",\"timestamp\":1642617400,\"title\":\"Let's talk about how to know about Bitcoin\\n\"},\"digest\":\"6me_Owr8OAlDMjTXU7KJ-zSHCLzUYefgmRf-r52-OGs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x038F2777Ce0bACfA8620E60455BBEe6cbe112D66\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"CbGG2Wb1LL1KZnDDLxT0LGC2L6bs02pMJ0YRSCKNdkg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"vPz9T1cingggTo-YUZ8USwpv7p3Gpzr1Xf9mLiKhpSU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"b2YbHbunDUI-2mA8TkwAiO9MKBGy1pR1SoJWn1jkFM4HGhMy6aPHL9ZurIlAdiDV9XaYe_Y-411bZSCTJ02HyQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0a22e9b5221f27a4cab0a79a8048f42a0f6e4b4aaea48b7754c611be5a444ea72acc70aa665b177346dbd12f03000ebf6daddd6f3bcdaf8644de234ea28b8bbf1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"CbGG2Wb1LL1KZnDDLxT0LGC2L6bs02pMJ0YRSCKNdkg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"vPz9T1cingggTo-YUZ8USwpv7p3Gpzr1Xf9mLiKhpSU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"6me_Owr8OAlDMjTXU7KJ-zSHCLzUYefgmRf-r52-OGs\"}"
