"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"> **[Skyward Finance](https://skyward.finance/)** is the initial token distribution contract on [Near Protocol](https://near.org/), which mean to enable fair token distribution and price discovery for projects built on Near Protocol.\\n\\nAfter several months since its launch, Skyward has shown its two fantastic features. One is streaming time-based auctions, different from other platforms, the other is long-term shares of the treasury, which keeps the value of Skyward growing.\\n\\n![https://skyward.finance/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/F9hQorI85oTXsbbAI8hg2.png?height=388&width=1600)\\n\\n### Streaming Time-based Auctions\\n\\n#### Global Perspective\\n\\n* N equal auctions =N Blocks = N Secs\\n* Output Token(Token for Sale) = M\\n* Referral Fee: 0\\\\~5% of M\\n* Output Token for Each Block = M (1-Referral Fee)/ N = m\\n* Input Token(Token for Purchase): Real-Time Fluctuate\\n\\n#### Auction Perspective(For nth Auction)\\n\\n* For nth Auction, there are ( N-n+1 ) auctions remaining\\n* Auction Price = Output Token Remaining / Input Token Remaining\\n* Output Token for nth Auction = Output Token Remaining /( N-n+1 ) =M (1-Referral Fee)/ N = m\\n* Input Token for nth Auction = Input Token Remaining /( N-n+1 )\\n\\n![Streaming Auctions](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I4ZknGJgiCZLGHlNtpUs0.png?height=398&width=818)\\n\\n#### Investor Perspective\\n\\nTarget: Allocate budget of Input Token among N auctions, instead of bidding for an auction.\\n\\n***Negative Strategy:*** Deposit all Input Token before the auction start, and get the average price for the whole sale. In recent cases, it’s essential to deposit before the sale, because the sale price is growing since the start.\\n\\n![Negative Strategy On OCT & PARAS Sale](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CY3gkLsxaRGu2YWZD9Yp5.png?height=409&width=731)\\n\\n***Positive Strategy:*** Change position along with the price change, just like buying stock in the secondary market. The difference is that you can buy stock with the amount you want at the current price. But in Skyward, you have to deposit the corresponding amount to all remaining auctions, then withdraw the Input Token left after the auction. Due to transaction fees, it’s impractical to allocate Input Token among N auctions precisely. The rational strategy is allocating Input Token among different time periods to get a lower time-weighted price. That is if you can predict the price trend before further auctions\\n\\nConsidering a simple auction with three price levels: Normal, High, and Low.\\n\\n* Assume the investor has anticipated the future trend in advance, he will allocate all his budget in the low price interval. To do that, it’s necessary to deposit extra proportional token when the auctions hit the low price range.\\n\\n![Positive Strategy with Prediction in Advance](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ddt4dDEjfRTaxrpdkJgaA.png?height=742&width=1428)\\n\\nIn reality, it’s impossible for investors to predict the price trend in advance. Because the streaming time-based auctions itself is a process of price discovery. For a wise investor, the deep and thorough research of the projects before the auctions decides whether to participate. With more Input Token reserved, he could deposit and withdraw to get a lower average price when the price fluctuates.\\n\\n![Positive Strategy with Prediction in Process](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fx2BUZd2S-YjIv_rZUKpc.png?height=577&width=1600)\\n\\nIn summary, the process of investment decision in Skyward’ streaming time-based auction follows:\\n\\n1. Decide whether to investor: deep and thorough research in advance\\n2. Decide the budget: set the amount and reserve extra Input Token to operate.\\n3. Deposit all/majority of the budget before at the very beginning: get the lower price in most cases and reserve future operation in the process(for the positive investor).\\n4. Decide to deposit and withdraw with the precise prediction: operate to get lower average price(for the positive investor).\\n\\n### Fully Decentralization\\n\\n#### For Investors\\n\\n* No KYC\\n* No GEO-Location Limitation\\n* No Capital Requirement. Everyone can participate at any time of the auctions with any amount of Input Token\\n\\n#### For Project Founders\\n\\n* No Restriction. Anyone can create a new listing auction with 10 NEAR. At present, the whitelist provided by Ref Finance distinguishes the good or bad projects. At the same time, Ref Finance provides liquidity.\\n* Flexibility. Projects themselves can choose to raise money by Skyward only without seed round and private sale. Projects can also use Skyward to make custom airdrop.\\n\\n#### Compared to Other Platforms\\n\\n* Better Price Discovery. Price approach to the fair value through time like the stock market.\\n* Prevent front-running bots and gas war. Enough time to deposit before the sale begins.\\n* Prevent Sybil Attack: multi accounts can’s raise the winning rate or get more shares.\\n* Prevent Price manipulation: deposit and withdraw large amount will affect the future auctions for offender itself.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/W1uCkgG7ypBBDH2BVXx3o.png?height=412&width=2036)\\n\\n**Feel free to contact if have any questions.**\\n\\nGmail: [frankyfreeman10@gmail.com](mailto:frankyfreeman10@gmail.com)\\n\\nTwitter: [@Franky_Freeman_](https://twitter.com/Franky_Freeman_)\",\"timestamp\":1638114449,\"title\":\"The Truths of Skyward Part Ⅰ\"},\"digest\":\"urYCW8oVKgs9eCXKZobu3XPEwZ_PYWo7OsnfXiWfM8E\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7beA3b998361D95Ce99C0b4165E8d32Be45e68A7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"WRK3nvg1UvrsgnT79bCtSgKCyzzVupe1sOkZHgICX7k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"WsJKIqBcZbi5DvalNJ8ymRebcse2KI5v_BKMqyUsLh4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"rY9OwQAuG7wczkUM97x0sfeu8KUegSAIgHUTUyWdAvWxj2PRf_dIik-EL8YRDIkfZ0o_1weXYFOko_50aaOk9Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb2bab3b02c24ac375aaa6e032265a0557864b19e0476f3eb671d18e744f981bc2ac0d0700263227a7c8dc6a6a865b7bfb9ab882fd114379f6e3e2738e04740ce1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"WRK3nvg1UvrsgnT79bCtSgKCyzzVupe1sOkZHgICX7k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"WsJKIqBcZbi5DvalNJ8ymRebcse2KI5v_BKMqyUsLh4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"urYCW8oVKgs9eCXKZobu3XPEwZ_PYWo7OsnfXiWfM8E\"}"
