Every user of Web3.0 has the same access rights, participation rights, and benefits. Distributing technical resources, community resources and channel resources can be efficiently and collaboratively aggregated has become the key to the sustainable and orderly development of Web 3.0. In other words, without a collaborative ecological mutual assistance mechanism, Web 3.0 is like water without a source and fire without wood. While de-trusting, Web3.0 has a clearer relationship of rights and responsibilities, which can improve the efficiency of resource utilization. There will be more space for the upgrading of enterprise mutual aid alliances, \\\"user capital\\\" will be more valued, and users and enterprises will be one closer community of interests.\\n\\nMeblox believes that collaborative ecological mutual assistance is the core spiritual core of Web3.0. The decentralization of Web3.0 is more of a means to protect the rights and interests of participants and stimulate the motivation of participants from the level of participants, while collaborative ecological mutual assistance is the purpose of Web3. 0. Because resources can only be allocated accurately and the common interests of participants can be maintained via cooperation and mutual assistance. It is necessary to take into account the three dimensions of technical collaboration, organizational collaboration, and channel collaboration to achieve Web3.0 collaboration and mutual assistance. It is difficult to give full play to the effectiveness of Web3.0 without any dimension.\\n\\n**Technical Collaboration**\\n\\nInteroperability,an essential part of the Web 3.0 development framework, is the ability to view and access information across various blockchain systems. Interoperability is the catalyst for widespread commercial adoption through improved scalability and transaction throughput. In other words, interoperability is critical to the mass adoption of blockchain technology. The current Layer 2.0, cross-chain, side-chain technologies, etc. are all focusing on solving the problem of interoperability; Only by realizing interoperability 3.0 can Web 3.0 aggregate all high-quality enterprises, users, and content, and truly form a rich Web 3.0 ecology. Meblox will be compatible with different sub-ecologies step by step through Meblox Protocol, including Defi2.0, GameFi, NFT, LearnFi, SocialFi, public chain system, MetaFi, operating system, etc., to achieve a unified interface standard for major metaverse spaces to realize the interoperability of different chains and different scene spaces, and provide technical support for the ecological value circulation.\\n\\n**Bounty Tasks**\\n\\n The source code of Web3.0 will be open source in the future. Anyone can initiate technical improvement proposals. The technical tasks can be quantified after voting, and relevant technical professionals can be attracted in the form of bounty tasks to help the ecosystem. This is also an important reason for the prosperity of the Web3.0 industry. A perfect incentive mechanism can quickly accumulate the best technical talents in various industries as long as they can make contributions and obtain corresponding rights and interests. Meblox will improve the construction of the incentive mechanism and build consensus through M-DAO, gather the best relevant talents, and provide solid ecological support for the development of the Meblox system.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IgUfSXshks1Mwo8ieHxFT.jpg?height=640&width=1280)\\n\\n**Code Auditing**\\n\\nThere are professional blockchain, smart contract, DAO, and DeFi code auditing institutions, which act as independent third parties to check the technical bottom layer of the Web3.0 project through white box, black box, simulated concurrency In other ways, the stability of the infrastructure is tested from multiple dimensions such as security, performance, cross-chain capability, and governance efficiency at present. Without a stable and reliable technical bottom layer, everything is impossible. The underlying framework of Meblox, as small as a technical module, must be certified by the most authoritative international auditing agency before it’s being launched, because Meblox will carry the world's largest Web3.0 traffic portal in the future, and it may be grafted to millions of small and medium-sized enterprises. Hezi Ecology can lead the Web 3.0 era only by pursuing the ultimate technology and first-class security performance.\\n\\n**Organizational collaboration**\\n\\nDAO mechanism, a decentralized autonomous organization mechanism, is collectively governed and enjoyed by its members. As the leading DAO system of Web3.0, M-DAO will provide the tools needed to effectively organize people and resources, so that each member user of M-DAO can use these tools to collaborate with each other and capture more resources and opportunities. In essence, M-DAO can be regarded as an open and symbiotic economy while on the basis of consensus, it can match the resources and skills of different members, and at the same time quickly build a collaboration model. Any enterprise or individual can join M-DAO as long as it recognizes M-DAO's concept of \\\"All for one and one for all.\\\", obtain M-DAO organizational support, and achieve more efficient development. M-DAO will become a model of organizational coordination.\\n\\n**Smart contracts**\\n\\nCollaborative cooperation must establish order. In the world of Web 3.0, code is law. For specific Web 3.0 matters, the orderly advancement of the process needs to be guaranteed in the form of smart contracts. The rights and responsibilities of all parties involved, and the tasks of each party are clearly defined. Once any proposal or resolution is voted on by the community, no individual or enterprise may tamper with the contract content, and any participant can view the project progress in real time, which greatly reduces the cost of trust, communication and information deviation under the traditional company system, and improves project organization and management. efficient. In the future, all governance matters of Meblox will be guaranteed in the form of smart contracts to ensure that all members of M-DAO communicate and collaborate in an orderly manner to form a community.\\n\\n**Organizer**\\n\\nOrganizational coordination also requires an organizer, which is different from the traditional corporate leader, who establishes authority by position, and then demonstrates leadership through control, work authorization or performance management. In Web3.0, the organizer is more to lead by example and become a trustworthy person with practical actions and contributions. He is not here to instruct everyone on what to do, but to give everyone confidence and courage. For example, the organizers of M-DAO clearly disseminate the values ​​and common dreams, and help the contributors to locate and clarify their goals, so as to better integrate into the community; the organizers of M-DAO are also the leaders and role models among the contributors to ensure that Other members can be motivated to participate in the collaboration and mutual assistance of the community. As long as they work hard and contribute, each user may become a beneficiary.\\n\\n**Scenario synergy**\\n\\nIn the Web2.0 era, the game ecology can give birth to social tools, and social tools give birth to UGC and payment applications; in the Web3.0 era, there are also phenomenal GameFi users' social needs, SocialFi users' needs for e-commerce, or e-commerce users. payment needs. Therefore, Web3.0 also needs to link different scenarios, establish a multi-scenario collaboration mechanism, capture the needs of Web3.0 users in time, and collaborate to spawn new applications to prosper the ecosystem. Based on the diversity of M-DAO member companies and ecological categories, Meblox will establish a complete collaboration mechanism, allowing M-DAO members to break through the limitations of industries or fields, work together to expand traffic, and achieve a win-win situation for all parties.\\n\\n Industrial chain collaboration: The Web3.0 era will also face industrial chain collaboration issues, such as the virtual land industrial chain formed by developers, designers, builders, decorators, and intermediaries. How to coordinate the upstream and downstream of the industrial chain to establish an industrial chain The linkage and cooperation mechanism directly determines the output efficiency of the industrial chain. In the future, M-DAO member companies can, based on their own positioning in the industry chain, achieve collaborative linkage with the upstream and downstream of the industry chain, increase revenue-generating models, improve production efficiency, and consolidate their position in the industry chain.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/w678w8u8FJ42PS46pQ-5R.jpg?height=640&width=1280)\\n\\n \\n\\nWeb3.0 represents a brand-new organization and coordination framework for human beings. Based on Web3.0, we can better utilize our own advantages, realize resource sharing, build a community of interests, and efficiently maximize corporate or personal value. Meblox will also build a \\\"metaverse space ecosystem\\\" based on the M-DAO organization to serve as a bridge between SMEs and users around the world, and establish an organizational collaboration mechanism to empower members to achieve rapid development in the Web3.0 era!\",\"timestamp\":1641976747,\"title\":\"Meblox: Collaborative Ecological Mutual Assistance Is The Core Spirit of Web3.0\"},\"digest\":\"Pe1-vb2TF5StiBMuQe94LDe-c4PqQ-zZ1hv5vBs1rL4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xf8e750C22918B1A727Cd6A518E4347De10564A2d\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RXqqrsO5ygcRsQkziJE4emzZNuYRcsdkSpF3OgfRFNY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"bWNOVsjBZYfvKRkzuAxPM7HIii8ZZbZkPDDnk3f2yxI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"a8I_R-AR12sTRepEh9rpEwNmtW0yAArshArt6qC3FOuW4wgrWhjcSMUNz7RH4XA8B2gDokOJoP-17Fn_-HHMWg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4204a3c694068e3ff3aedcfcb571cb9e50776d9fdcce943e4beb434b8afb744911f20a44cea33e52b326bbc1241cd1ad28af63f1fa40cce846249012aa67290d1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RXqqrsO5ygcRsQkziJE4emzZNuYRcsdkSpF3OgfRFNY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"bWNOVsjBZYfvKRkzuAxPM7HIii8ZZbZkPDDnk3f2yxI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Pe1-vb2TF5StiBMuQe94LDe-c4PqQ-zZ1hv5vBs1rL4\"}"
