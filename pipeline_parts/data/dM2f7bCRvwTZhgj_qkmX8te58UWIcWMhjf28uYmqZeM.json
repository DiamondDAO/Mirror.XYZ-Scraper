"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Reddit has launched a waitlist for the upcoming site-wide expansion of its Ethereum-based ‘Community Points’ token rewards program, as well as a dedicated website.\\n\\n[The social media platform, which runs on upvotes that earn users' karma scores, first dabbled in crypto token rewards](https://cointelegraph.com/news/is-reddit-devising-a-blockchain-based-tipping-system) in Dec 2019, when it launched Ethereum-based token rewards called “Donuts” in the r/Ethtrader subreddit.\\n\\nIn May 2020, the platform [expanded the reward program](https://cointelegraph.com/news/redditors-are-now-spam-farming-bricks-and-moons) to the r/Cryptocurrency subreddit with “Moons,” and r/FortniteBR with “Bricks” on an Ethereum testnet.\\n\\nNow, the program will be rolled out as an opt-in feature for subreddits across the entire platform. Similar to karma, Redditors will be able to earn Community Points by making contributions to a subreddit, such as creating and uploading valuable content, or volunteering to moderate the community.\\n\\nWhile the points remain in their beta phase, Reddit has “strongly advised to exercise caution.” Selling, exchanging or trading the points are against the site’s rules.\\n\\nReddit stated: “This kind of behavior is very risky while Points are on a testnet — Points can be lost or they may not be migrated over to the main Ethereum network.”\\n\\nThe Community Points program is currently being run on the Rinkeby testnet version of the Ethereum blockchain, with plans to migrate to the Ethereum mainnet using [Eth layer-2 scaling solution Arbitrum](https://cointelegraph.com/news/reddit-deploys-layer-2-solution-aimed-at-scaling-ethereum-based-community-points).\\n\\nDespite Reddit’s warnings, [owners of the trial token rewards have been able to devise a convoluted plan](https://cointelegraph.com/news/global-economy-saved-reddit-s-moon-token-has-a-2-64-septillion-market-cap) to trade the tokens for fiat.\\n\\nOnce the reward system moves to the mainnet, the tokens are likely to be able to be swapped, held or traded on crypto trading platforms like any other ERC-20 token.\\n\\nBoth users and mods are able to sign up for the [waitlist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xSpGcBc0TP3GpfNgo3F0pV86OQYiEwUcsWBu3-RtfiU/viewform) and request the Community Points feature to be added to their subreddit once the beta program goes live.\",\"timestamp\":1639039231,\"title\":\"Reddit launches waitlist for site-wide expansion of ‘Community Points’\"},\"digest\":\"K8AegWHF9KQHLn_2DAMLExeeMP-r7acmIZR52VGQXws\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xB99b08bAb55E09F912D4BF4684144c43436017A1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"D8hdFrEG1eWutNEF3k5vwtJD_cc-BHm62KW6Hngk3SI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0ZObB7eq7KsNlEu5waafBEtbbiZpNeCoQeyct6aZd8U\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"wfo9zj2bdH5XTc4P9qAO-imKC1PrW6InnsAHKS0tW9347pYTfRM1OztCtKIOQ5_KsgulpxmnKqrhqgqzozZAZg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x21ea367c2f97c857cd4219da7ab8679f38b998b3d6a21f90e6ddc56443ce0b1d42d2f50f959fd184c079354b95c4dd48e2d799606061a9020182ab493371e11d1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"D8hdFrEG1eWutNEF3k5vwtJD_cc-BHm62KW6Hngk3SI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0ZObB7eq7KsNlEu5waafBEtbbiZpNeCoQeyct6aZd8U\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"K8AegWHF9KQHLn_2DAMLExeeMP-r7acmIZR52VGQXws\"}"
