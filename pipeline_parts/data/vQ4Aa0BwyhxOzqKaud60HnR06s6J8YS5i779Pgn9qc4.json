"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The *Songcamp Elektra* project is made up of 42 musicians, visual artists, devs and strategists. Together we are building *“Elektra”* — **an interactive choose-your-own-adventure web3 game with music at its core.**\\n\\nTo play the game, you need to secure a *Portal Ticket NFT* in the crowdfund below. \\n\\nThe funds raised through this crowdfund will go entirely towards bringing this project to life. \\n\\n**As this project evolves, the lines between creator and audience will blur.** Game builders will also play the game they are building; and game players will also help build the game they are playing. The $ELEKTRA token will come to establish the contribution graph of this project, and once the camp is finished — the ElektraDAO will be born. \\n\\n[Songcamp Elektra](crowdfund://0xa4496Bd920B200A87A1Fa33c5026b045048cF3A7?version=tiered_1&network=rinkeby&features=overview)\\n\\n### The Portal to Elektra Is Now Open\\n\\nA portal has opened to another world. A world called *Elektra*.\\n\\nTo access the portal, you must secure a *Portal Ticket* NFT. \\n\\nThere are **6 *Portal Ticket* NFTs available.** \\n\\n**Each ticket gives you access to a different Portal Entry Number**, and thus each ticket brings you to a different starting point in the world. This means that those with different *Portal Tickets* will be required to work together to accomplish their collective mission.\\n\\nThere are 3 multi-tier *Portal Ticket* NFTs:\\n\\n1. The Phi Ticket → Edition of 10 at 1 ETH\\n2. The Chi Ticket → Edition of 50 at 0.4 ETH\\n3. The Psi Ticket → Edition of 200 at 0.1 ETH\\n\\n[Songcamp Elektra](crowdfund://0xa4496Bd920B200A87A1Fa33c5026b045048cF3A7?version=tiered_1&network=rinkeby&features=editions)\\n\\nThere are also 3 one-of-one *Portal Ticket* NFTs, awarded to the top 3 backers of the crowdfund:\\n\\n4. The Hieroglyphic Ticket → awarded to the 1st place backer\\n5. The Ultrasonic Ticket → awarded to the 2nd place backer\\n6. The Eternal Ticket → awarded to the 3rd place backer\\n\\nIn securing your *Portal Ticket*, you will also receive $ELEKTRA tokens — the currency native to Elektra. **You will need these tokens to complete your mission.**\\n\\n[Elektra QA](crowdfund://0xa4496Bd920B200A87A1Fa33c5026b045048cF3A7?version=tiered_1&network=rinkeby&features=backers,podium&podium_media=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F1b024368-be13-4117-b9a9-bbe7a2ede9d7.jpeg,https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F61683cd8-f0aa-4f69-b74a-9c67a9393400.jpeg,https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F2d77a4f0-38f3-4eb0-a91f-b01c7c24871f.jpeg)\\n\\n### The Story Of Elektra\\n\\nOnce healthy and thriving, the world of Elektra has since turned desolate and barren.\\n\\nOn Elektra, **music is energy**. Music is the fuel, electricity, and light of the world.\\n\\nCenturies ago, Elektra had a thriving civilization with a deep rooted sense of value towards art. But soon, motives around greed and self-interest took over, and the music that powered this world was lost.\\n\\nYour mission is to travel to Elektra, and help us collectively revive, restore and reignite this once beautiful world back to health.\\n\\n***Will you accept your mission?***\\n\\n**To play the game, you must secure one (1) of the following *Portal Ticket* NFTs.**\\n\\n[Phi Ticket](edition://0x9adDcb5546d5bBFf5C6bCb582279c6aE61CD67C1?editionId=29&version=crowdfund_1)\\n\\n[Psi Ticket](edition://0x9adDcb5546d5bBFf5C6bCb582279c6aE61CD67C1?editionId=28&version=crowdfund_1)\\n\\n[Chi Ticket](edition://0x9adDcb5546d5bBFf5C6bCb582279c6aE61CD67C1?editionId=27&version=crowdfund_1)\\n\\n### What is Songcamp Elektra?\\n\\n**Songcamp Elektra** is the second experiment created by Songcamp — a community of musicians, artists and strategists with a deep interest in learning what happens when **music** and **the new internet** crash into each other.\\n\\n*Songcamp* acts a lot like a **web3 laboratory** — experimenting at the far out edges of how web3 tools and tech can affect positive change in the lives and work of artists.\\n\\nThe *Songcamp Elektra* project is made up of ~42 artists, devs, project ops and strategists working together to bring this world to life. This crowdfund intends to raise the funds that will enable us to do just that. \\n\\n### Crowdfund Details\\n\\nWe will use **90% of the amount raised to put towards the *Elektra* project**. \\n\\nThese funds will go toward the core team of project managers, web developers, artists and strategists working directly on the project. Other costs include transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain, web hosting and file storage. We intend to save a portion of these funds to act as the *seed money* in standing up the *ElektraDAO* once this initial phase of the project is complete (more on that below).\\n\\nThe remaining **10% will go directly to the artists who created the *Portal Ticket* visuals.** \\n\\n****CROWDFUND SPLIT****\\n\\n### Phase 1: Songcamp Elektra + The Elektra NFT Vault\\n\\n*Songcamp Elektra* will run for 4 weeks, until the first week of August. \\n\\nOnce through the portal, you will begin your journey. You will work with other players to move through this foreign land, discover more about the history of *Elektra*, and find your way to victory. \\n\\nIf successful, you will unlock the help you need — the people and items along the way that will help you accomplish your mission. Remember, **it is music that powers the world of *Elektra***. Luckily, you’ll have a lot of talented musicians to help along the way. You too may be summoned to assist in the music creation (should you wish to of course). :)\\n\\nAt times during the camp, 1-of-1 NFTs will be released. A 20% share of the proceeds from collected NFTs will go towards the ElektraDAO, while a select few of the NFTs will be placed in the Elektra Vault.\\n\\n### Phase 2: ElektraDAO and The $ELEKTRA Token\\n\\n> We will build a world, and own that world together. \\n\\nUpon purchasing your *Portal Ticket* NFT, you will also receive a portion of $ELEKTRA tokens based on the amount contributed. You will receive 100 $ELEKTRA for every 0.1 ETH you contribute to the crowdfund. \\n\\nThe project will retain 75% of $ELEKTRA’s supply, and distribute the majority to artists, devs, project ops and strategists working directly on the project. The remaining amount will be used to create bounty rewards for the wider network, as well as vest a portion in the treasury. \\n\\n**As this project evolves, the lines between creator and audience will blur.** Game builders will also play the game they are building; and game players will also help build the game they are playing. \\n\\nBy the end, we will have a community of contributors to the Elektra project that all hold $ELEKTRA tokens based on their contribution levels. At this point, **we will have *exited to community* — and the project will be owned and governed by $ELEKTRA token holders.** \\n\\n### What Happens Then?\\n\\nWell, then it’s up to the network. \\n\\nThe *ElektraDAO* will have created an incredibly strong backbone:\\n\\n1. A core group of musicians, visual artists, devs, project ops, strategists and backers with sharp coordination and collaboration skills — plus an overflowing level of squad energy.\\n2. 1-of-1 NFTs from the Elektra story secured in the DAO’s vault.\\n3. A flow of royalties from the artwork created in-camp.\\n\\nWe then have the exciting opportunity to collectively decide what to do with all this. \\n\\nSome early ideas: make more art together, continue evolving the world and story of *Elektra*, experiment with and carve out new paths to monetization and value realization for the art we’ve created, or our personal favourite…\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/troels_a/status/1413234727822180354\\n\\n**Broadway, here we come!**\\n\\nWe thank you — truly and deeply — for being here. 🌻\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1626038527,\"title\":\"The Songcamp Elektra Crowdfund\",\"publication\":\"songcamp\"},\"digest\":\"UkVCE-k4DVYVXa7NMOezRI_xOa1jU-KsMTnL2Gor2NA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x658D62A7DC4d475a9cc4AF124A60868c594EEEc6\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"urNuLOhEytrENeNOWlVp_6rce-Ti6wD5dQ1hP_u2R7Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"XjOD_BeX5Zthi643Q9zMK3zuijFhBz-pTZXahgIN-Q4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"NERVgjTIZTGS4JcBHB4up243g6PKRv91PCdyi38yS_oZuSQJrFKlNKhan0Y3Ruxt-ucpa_E1QX7GVIGhoOmZYw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc45ef3b1215b6577f4382c53bb7a6dee0e942153cee952399b29069ed901ae4230c0d9ab8ea215bbc0472c283a645d794c351830986639bcc199a075151783a11b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on songcamp.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"urNuLOhEytrENeNOWlVp_6rce-Ti6wD5dQ1hP_u2R7Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"XjOD_BeX5Zthi643Q9zMK3zuijFhBz-pTZXahgIN-Q4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"IMgU6ZRJZ0UUrqzxyL5NI3erUUk4RIYk6fjNO_ikpcE\"}"
