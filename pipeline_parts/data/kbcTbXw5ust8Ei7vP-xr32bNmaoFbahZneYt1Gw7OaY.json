"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"On Nov. 28, a Sina Weibo account posted a photo of a breastfeeding mother in the Beijing subway, claiming that the breastfeeding woman had used the Beijing subway as a \\\"village bus\\\", which sparked a lot of debate among netizens.\\n\\nHowever, the deletion of the blog and the apology could not stop the netizens from discussing women's right to breastfeed in public. The breast is a woman's breast, and it serves the important function of nursing a child, not an organ with sexual connotations as we are taught by the advertisements and images that fill the public eye. If you think so, then I'm sorry, it's you who should change your thinking, not women who are responsible for men's masturbation. Public places are for women, for men, for everyone, and public rules cannot be made to go only according to the needs of heterosexual men. To cover or not to cover, it is an irreproachable personal choice\\n\\nAfter seeing the news, a mother of a seven-month-old breastfeeding baby described her own difficult situation in the current lack of any support, whether facility-based or cultural, for women to breastfeed publicly.\\n\\n\\\"Babies are human, but not rational, so breastfeeding in public is often a choice of last resort for the sake of the baby's rights; women are human, not tools to seduce men, so women showing their breasts in public is not a nuisance, but an autonomous choice, and others may disagree with that choice, but have no right to interfere with the person making it.\\nEven if many public places have mother and baby rooms, mother and baby rooms are not everywhere, with a bawling child walking a long way to find a mother and baby room, please put yourself in their shoes, realistic?\\n\\nWhy not cover up when breastfeeding? This is a question that no one who has ever been a parent can imagine, but sometimes breastfeeding is just impossible to cover up. For example, some babies do not hold their nipples properly and take a long time to train, in which case the mother needs to watch her child at all times. My children had problems with not being able to cover up their breastfeeding for various reasons, and I had to nurse in public once. There is no way around it, it's not a matter of willingness to expose, it's a choice. Personally, I do think it's better to cover up if you can under most conditions, but you can't rule out special circumstances. And, I still think the unwillingness to cover up is also a personal choice.\\\"\\n\\nThe micro-blogger @doctormamaOu Xi, a physician at Guangzhou Women's and Children's Medical Center, mentioned, \\\"What's wrong with the Beijing subway, a female parliamentarian in Argentina is still breastfeeding.\\\"\\n\\nDr. O'Shea said the female legislator named perez, she attended the meeting on July 23 this year, she breastfed her 8-month-old daughter on the spot, which sparked a hot debate\\n\\n![An Argentinian congresswoman, publicly breastfeeding her 8-month-old daughter in parliament.\\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pz9Tjx0yAT4LyKDEFNr7I.png?height=525&width=693)\\n\\nIn fact, similar controversies have occurred in other countries. Earlier in the United States Indiana conner kendall breastfeeding in a restaurant, was a young father in the next seat to take pictures and put on social networks: \\\"I understand that your child is hungry, but I do not know if it is appropriate. Can you at least cover it?\\\" Conner said she had done nothing wrong. Conner then wrote a long response to the dad and the many netizens who questioned and harassed her: \\\"I know you feel uncomfortable seeing my breasts, but you have a choice - don't look. \\\"\\n\\nIn the article, Conner stated that she has the right to breastfeed her child anywhere and in any way she feels appropriate:.\\n\\n\\\"I was considerate of the other people in the store and turned around to lift my shirt to breastfeed my son until he was done. I didn't use a shawl because my son resisted them and would yell and scream under the shawl and wouldn't breastfeed properly. If he yelled and screamed because he was hungry, I would have been considered a bad mother for not feeding my baby. I didn't express my milk into a bottle before going out because, first, my son doesn't like to drink from a bottle, and second, I have the right to feed my child in any way I see fit, anywhere I see fit.\\\"\\n\\nShe concluded, \\\"I strongly suggest that you re-educate yourself with your daughter that breasts are meant to come and nurture babies, that it is this society that labels it as sexual, and that children don't see breasts and realize sex until society teaches them to do so.\\\"\\n\\nTo date, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and other European and American countries, the Philippines, Malaysia and other Asian countries or regions have enacted laws and regulations to support breastfeeding in public.\\n\\nUnited States.\\nCurrently 49 states and DC and the Virgin Islands have laws that provide women with the right to breastfeed their children in any setting, whether public or private, where individuals can legally remain. California has added a specific \\\"nipple exposure or not\\\" provision, 17 states have legislation to promote the right of mothers to breastfeed, and 29 states have laws on misconduct that specifically exempt all breastfeeding.\\n\\nBrazil.\\nOn May 12, 2011, mothers in São Paulo, Brazil, rallied to demand the right to breastfeed in public, and in 2015, São Paulo introduced a bill that would impose fines where breastfeeding is prohibited in public.\\n\\nUK.\\nThe UK's new Equality Act 2010 treats the refusal of women to breastfeed as gender discrimination, and women are legally protected from breastfeeding in public places (including any means of public transport).\\n\\nAnd most of the opinions of the internet users focus on the call for the government and companies to provide more convenience for breastfeeding women and build nursery rooms. Baby-sitting/breastfeeding rooms are needed, but they should not be based on the idea that it is shameful for women to be topless/breastless. Baby-sitting rooms should be an option for women, not the only option. Some feminists emphasize that women have every right to breastfeed in public, and that baby-sitting rooms are wanted, as is the right of women to go topless.\\n\\nIn her article \\\"Women have the right to breastfeed in public - set up nursing rooms or lose that right,\\\" Weibo user @GaoFuQiang pointed out that women bear the burden of human reproduction, and breastfeeding babies is one of the specific acts that no one has the right to accuse women of breastfeeding in public.\\n\\n\\\"Nurturing babies has an indisputable social attribute, and if a woman breastfeeding in public causes embarrassment to others, it is others who should leave that public place, not remove the woman from it.\\n\\nThere are two basic principles that must be emphasized: first, women have the right to breastfeed in places such as breastfeeding rooms, as well as in public places, and it is entirely up to them to decide whether to breastfeed in public or in a breastfeeding room; second, the fundamental purpose of breastfeeding rooms is to resolve the embarrassment of breastfeeding women and to protect the privacy of breastfeeding women, not because women breastfeeding in public would cause other people's discomfort.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1636368599,\"title\":\"Is breastfeeding in public uncivilized?
