"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Hey everyone — new podcast episode is out: <https://share.transistor.fm/s/2e42e9f9>\\n\\nThis is a conversation with [Tracheopteryx](https://twitter.com/tracheopteryx) about the evolution of Yearn, Coordinape, and pseudonymity.\\n\\nTracheopteryx has been a key leader in the Yearn Finance community since its legendary genesis event. In this conversation, we talk about key moments in Yearn's evolution with an eye towards takeaways that might be useful for other projects. We talk about the introduction of the multisig; the mint — a complex governance proposal where the community eventually chose to dilute themselves in order to reward core contributors; and constrained delegation - the governance framework that Trach helped design and which is operating in Yearn today.\\n\\nThe other big area we get into is Coordinape. Coordinape is a protocol for decentralizing compensation. It was designed and incubated inside of Yearn, and is now being built as an independent project.\\n\\nTowards the end of the conversation, Trach tells the story behind his name and shares a perspective on becoming pseudonymous that has stayed with me since.\\n\\nI wholeheartedly recommend this episode. It is packed with ideas, and was a blast to record. I hope you enjoy :)\",\"timestamp\":1636048372,\"title\":\"#6 – Tracheopteryx: Yearn, Coordinape, and pseudonymity\",\"publication\":\"sinahab\"},\"digest\":\"x1qejiPDnh5OTqqqp72b_vkEMysbG9JeToaxf7Ycdj8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x03B79C0C1487a68AeabD9AA4ce779DaD77855F52\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"63lZ4c2qCoUW3JjnZLZznOe2uEENJZuS6kmpd3NBNuk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8CkFfIQ9vcR5859sIhtbYJFGRBJyCNNdduoc3wPLptI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"O47ltvMGzttoM8Ceb--_BpKT-H5EGXe9LMaC2sKdLKMLlZY4jrujxMaCQpIHrR6sZz9MTrMOQNRKChtZwo3dYw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xcf4df39a82b2785971b6a2fec404af8da76df176a3336ecdecf0765da0d5565827baad30c0f12941c1970565fd2c301e33d7e820504a5d898081f32aa840fe411c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on sinahab.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"63lZ4c2qCoUW3JjnZLZznOe2uEENJZuS6kmpd3NBNuk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8CkFfIQ9vcR5859sIhtbYJFGRBJyCNNdduoc3wPLptI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"x1qejiPDnh5OTqqqp72b_vkEMysbG9JeToaxf7Ycdj8\"}"
