"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"昨晚NFT社区很热闹，opensea又被骂了。原因是美国头部网约车企业LYFT的CFO Brian Roberts成为opensea的新CFO。\\n\\n这是好事，但新任首席财务官一上任就宣布了他的新计划。他计划为 opensea 进行首次公开​​募股。他说，“如果一家公司增长速度这么快，不考虑上市是愚蠢的。”\\n\\n目前，没有一家公司在 IPO 后发行过自己的代币；目前，无数人为了拿到opensea的“潜力”空投，在opensea刷上数百个钱包地址的交易，用自己的刷量给opensea带来收益，但很可能一无所获。\\n\\n事实上，很多人预计opensea会选择IPO，而不是发行原生代币。首先，opensea 的总部位于纽约。如果要发行代币，必然会面临很多合规困难；其次，从本质上讲，opensea 只是一个中心化的互联网产品。\\n\\n其实opensea和eBay没什么区别。它只是用数字商品（NFT）代替实物商品。事实上，它们是传统的C2C电子商务平台，通过每笔交易的手续费赚取收入。截至目前，2021年下半年opensea总交易额已达123.47亿美元。Opensea将对每笔交易收取2.5%的手续费，总收入为3.09亿美元。\\n\\n“这个世界已经受苦了很长时间。”\\n\\nThis is a common saying in the community. Although opensea has proud achievements, occupies 97% of the market share in the NFT field, and has 750000 users, it is essentially an Internet product, but opensea does not bring people the proper use experience of Internet products.\\n\\nWith the outbreak of NFT in the second half of this year, the traffic of opensea website surged, but obviously opensea was not ready for it. Almost every time the phenomenal popular NFT was sold or when beanie, Gary Vaynerchuk and other KOLs promoted an NFT series at the same time, the opensea website collapsed due to the surge in the number of visitors.\\n\\nIf such a problem occurred when NFT just broke out, it can also be understood that the team did not expect NFT to break out so quickly, but now half a year has passed since the beginning of the outbreak, and this problem still occurs frequently, which must be attributed to the delay and slack of the opensea team. Opensea even had the problem that all NFTs could not be listed for a period of time, which led to the purchase of NFTs that had been listed one by one. The serious shortage of market supply led to the rapid rise of floor price in a short time. After the problem of unable to list returned to normal, the market supply recovered and the floor price fell rapidly. The problems caused by opensea caused losses to countless buyers.\\n\\nIn addition, while opensea's \\\"competitors\\\" continue to develop, opensea's development seems to have stalled.\\n\\nSuperrare has launched the reward function. Nifty gateway will open the function of using Ethereum wallet to trade NFT in January, which can greatly save gas fees. Rarible has launched the private message function and rarible protocol Dao, which is used to build practical tools in the field of NFT; NFT trader allows people to trade their NFT in the form of barter, and Genie allows people to purchase goods and hang orders in batches.\\n\\nOther trading platforms are developing in full swing, and the frequent introduction of new functions also gives the community the confidence to continue to support, but opensea is standing still in the tide of the times. Indeed, 97% of the market share is enough to bring a sufficient sense of security to opensea, and few platforms have a chance to beat opensea in a short time. However, after Nate Chastain, once the most efficient product manager of opensea, was dismissed due to the \\\"rat warehouse\\\" incident, more and more people's suggestions were ignored. More and more people never received a reply to their feedback questions and requests for help. More and more people were dissatisfied with opensea's decreasing efficiency and the arrogance of the team.\\n\\nWhat people often pursue is to let a Web3 product have the use experience of web2, but at present, it can be said that opensea is clearly a web2 product, but it has the use experience of Web3.\\n\\nOpensea's Web3 ideal\\n\\nThis sense of contradiction is also due to the inaccurate positioning of opensea team. Opensea's \\\"semi decentralization\\\" also makes the whole platform a little \\\"different\\\". On the one hand, it is as open as a decentralized platform, so there is no audit step when users create NFT. On the other hand, it can directly remove or freeze users' NFT in a centralized way.\\n\\nHowever, the opensea team has repeatedly expressed its vision of making opensea into a Web3 application. When talking about the close cooperative relationship between opensea and other companies in the first Mint podcast, the founder of opensea mentioned that \\\"the great difference between Web3 and web2 lies in the cooperative relationship between multiple companies\\\", and the new CFO of opensea is even more frank about building NFT Web3 and the future of the digital economy.\\n\\nToken plays an extremely important role in Web3 applications. Whether it is used for community governance, user attention compensation or skin in the game, token is an indispensable tool, which is why people are looking forward to opensea issuing their own native tokens and think that if opensea issues tokens, it will surely issue air drops to users, Moreover, in view of the volume and income of opensea, if the airdrop is of great value, someone spared no effort to spend human and financial resources to interact with opensea one by one with hundreds of accounts, hoping to make a lot of money when airdrop.\\n\\nAs soon as the news that opensea is planning an IPO came out, the community scolded.\\n\\n一些人因为空投梦想的失败而认为他们可以收集羊毛。没想到，他们为opensea的收入做出了贡献。其他人很生气。\\n\\nopensea的创始人曾在接受采访时提到，opensea之所以成功，是因为它“在正确的时间出现在正确的地方”，并积极倾听用户的建议，了解他们真正想要什么。过去，opensea占据先发优势，积极听取社区的建议。今天，社区和用户一步步做出了巨大的贡献。到时候opensea真的可以让人看到团队在努力向Web3迈进。\\n\\n然而，在体量变得如此庞大之后，opensea变得有些“决绝”了。\\n\\nopensea新任CFO表示，“如果一家公司的增长率如此之快，不考虑上市是愚蠢的。” 然而，诞生于Web3的opensea在成功后选择放弃Web3是不是“聪明”？\\n\\n的确，从opensea的营收开始，IPO确实是一种获取更多营收的方式，它的选择也意味着它放弃了自己的Web3理想。\\n\\n开海的选择遭到了无数人的抨击。Opensea 的收入来自 Web3 居民，但 opensea 选择将这些收益分配给 web2 居民，而不是与自己的用户分享。Opensea 的品牌来自于社区的支持。正是每天数十万Web3用户的频繁使用，让opensea声名鹊起，收入丰厚。Opensea应该给予奖励，但选择IPO意味着这些支持者必须购买opensea的股票才能获得奖励。\\n\\n现在想想除了opensea还有哪个平台可以承担opensea和更多Web3的功能时，很难想出一个答案。许多人甚至无法命名其他平台。opensea的垄断让很多NFT平台没有生存的机会。一些新平台用sushiswap对抗uniswap，希望能从opensea抢食，但最终opensea的市场份额仍然惊人的97%。\\n\\n对于opensea我们无法做出选择，也很难猜测opensea团队的心路历程。也许 opensea 想复制其前身 coinbase 的老路。或许opensea的选择在web2时代很常见，但在Web3时代显然不合理。\\n\\nopensea 的发言人说，“我们准备了上海的材料，让我们安全度过消费者的问题。”该去研究来了，我们在什么地方取暖呢？\",\"timestamp\":1638880995,\"title\":\"Opensea, which plans an IPO, turns wool into revenue\"},\"digest\":\"z7eK8N2nWcp8jZKpuegdMI5Vf-eDqnYPJqktxnm56Xw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6688E117972d5419D9ae810284A0CcA3A77ea60A\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"iQ0SdlialI1gOY9smeBFUnJkFosRW3Ed2oLx-SK7muU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"HKzek9rslLriCAOFA0Op8J2S8qGfyRtpalGkqslyak4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"1F0Zd8eiN5T2pJDp73j3E1I0RuN3rMKErzFufGYsaOH8_mqU0AWtKIs2UWq77KC6typDiQ4LvaESREV9KXZbZA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa71e114ec6f604e13eb71e8311ac22773a08eecc0920ab6f5996c6a0124f2470630e86f6e970fa03b81f75a763e8c26813b19c23a46da6af607166725e67e7661b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"iQ0SdlialI1gOY9smeBFUnJkFosRW3Ed2oLx-SK7muU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"HKzek9rslLriCAOFA0Op8J2S8qGfyRtpalGkqslyak4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"z7eK8N2nWcp8jZKpuegdMI5Vf-eDqnYPJqktxnm56Xw\"}"
