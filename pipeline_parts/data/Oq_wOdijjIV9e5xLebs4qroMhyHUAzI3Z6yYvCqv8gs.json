"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Introduction:** As one of the key technologies leading a new round of information technology revolution, blockchain has gradually entered people's field of vision in recent years. Standard consortium chains, open consortium chains and public chains are booming. More and more companies are considering using blockchain technology to empower their businesses, but they are hesitated because of the heterogeneity of the underlying layers and high costs. So, how should users choose based on business needs? On November 13, 2021, ArchSummit Global Architects Summit (Shenzhen Station) 2021 \\\"Blockchain Technology Landing Exploration\\\" sub-forum invited He Yifan, CEO of Beijing Red Date Technology and Executive Director of BSN Development Alliance. \\\"Differences and Application Scenarios\\\" shared my views on the topic. He believes that in 10 years, many chains will disappear. By then, the blockchain network will be 30% of the public chain, 50% of the open consortium chain, and 20% of the standard consortium chain. In addition, the future open consortium chain will include non-coin public chains. Chained. This article is organized based on this speech.\\n\\nBlockchain: a new way of data transmission  \\n\\nEveryone often asks why China strongly supports blockchain, but has to crack down on virtual currencies so thoroughly.\\n\\nFirst of all, we need to understand that blockchain is a technology, virtual currency is an application, technology has no attributes, and laws and regulations are defining applications. Let me give you an example, just like steelmaking is permitted in China, but it must be illegal to use the refined steel to make a gun. In particular, the currency circle often adds the concept of currency to confuse these three attributes, so it must be distinguished. The state supports blockchain, which is essentially supporting an underlying technology.\\n\\nSo, what kind of technology is blockchain that can get strong support from the country?\\n\\nI think the essence of blockchain technology is a new method of data transmission, or a communication technology at the bottom, which is why the state supports it.\\n\\nThere are generally two ways of human communication, one is called linear transmission, that is, population transmission, which is inefficient and error-prone. The other is broadcast transmission. For example, in a meeting, everyone can exchange information. This is the principle of broadcast communication. Broadcast communication is a form of communication that emerged after humans began to live in groups. Here I emphasize that for the central system, it connects to the 9 external subsystems, which is not a broadcast communication.\\n\\nSpeaking of communications, let’s briefly review the history of communications. In 1875, the telephone was born, but at that time only two people could be connected. If an incident involves 10 people, how do you communicate? If everyone has feedback on this matter, get feedback from others, and then call other people. Then, if each person gives 3 rounds of feedback, it will have to make more than 1,000 calls. There is no way to deal with this matter. of. So, more than 100 years later, technical capabilities improved, and teleconferences appeared. From linear transmission to broadcast transmission, more efficient communication methods are constantly appearing. It can be said that communication technology has been evolving towards the goal of higher efficiency.\\n\\nThe Internet is designed on a point-to-point basis. For example, China Unicom in the 1970s had more than 200 machines. It is impossible for them to pull wires between each other. They must be connected in series. This series of network architecture has led to the fact that if one business penetrates the IT systems of 10 different legal entities, it is still communicating in pairs, that is to say, the central system has to be transmitted to two systems, and the two systems will handle them. After finishing, the efficiency is very low. For example, in the scenario of paying water bills on WeChat, at least 6 to 10 systems must be passed from WeChat to the water company’s billing system. This type of series connection is prone to problems such as incorrect transmission and non-transmission, and if one of them is in the middle If the system goes down, the entire business will be paralyzed.\\n\\nSo what is the core logic of the blockchain? In fact, it turns this kind of serial communication between the two into a broadcast communication. Simply put, it allows the IT system to \\\"meet\\\" and no longer spread the word. This logic is used every day, such as WeChat groups. This broadcast communication is one of the greatest things brought about by blockchain technology.\\n\\nThe consensus emphasized by the blockchain is only based on an application in communication. The reason why it can reach a consensus is because there is a more efficient broadcast transmission technology, not because it is encrypted. Encryption algorithm is a technology that has existed for 50 years. It is not that it can reach a consensus, and it cannot be achieved without an efficient communication method.\\n\\nSince the blockchain is essentially a new transmission method, we firmly believe that a new communication layer will appear on the Internet. The current communication layer is actually HTTP. 60% of the traffic uses the HTTP protocol. When developers write code to retrieve it, it must be for one system. Then there should be a communication protocol similar to HTTP, which can realize a string of codes and multiple The system forms a broadcast communication network. We believe that a new communication layer will appear in the blockchain in the next 10 years. In a broadcast communication network, whether data requires consensus and smart contracts are completely dependent on business needs. Once how many businesses are changed to broadcast communication methods, the efficiency will definitely be very high. If this layer is added, one more industry will emerge. This is a huge opportunity.\\n\\n   BSN Global Public Infrastructure Network  \\n\\nTherefore, starting in September 2018, the BSN project was jointly initiated by the National Information Center, China Mobile, China UnionPay, and Jujube Technology. The Chinese name is Blockchain Service Network (BSN). Its core concept is to gradually build a The next-generation Internet communication layer of the data broadcast transmission protocol, as well as related standard protocols, operating environment, development tools and operating systems. Since its introduction at home and abroad last year, BSN's concept and technical system have been highly recognized in the industry, and it is playing a positive role in promoting this industry.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VCTlnP6pfpF1l0T0Oo2vM.png?height=338&width=600)\\n\\nThe core of the whole architecture of BSN is divided into three layers.\\n\\n**The first is the cloud service layer.** If you want to create a new layer on the Internet, you must first integrate the cloud and simulate a layer on the cloud, that is, in each data center or cloud service, build a virtual data center. Defined as a public city node, it is now called a virtual data center. Then we string all the virtual data centers into a new network, just like the logic of the Internet, string all the machines and data centers, interact with each other, and the data forms the Internet. At present, BSN has achieved fully automated deployment. All aspects of any blockchain application are automatically deployed. This requires opening up all cloud APIs, virtual machines, container orchestration, gateway load balancing, and a series of content. This is very complicated, but BSN is now basically the mainstream cloud has been opened up.\\n\\n**The second layer is the data center.** Strictly speaking, BSN is not a blockchain, and its own technical system does not involve much blockchain content. BSN is actually a cloud management system based on blockchain. The logic is to divide a number of virtual machines in a large cloud or data center, and then build a blockchain operating environment to manage in the operating environment Virtual machine, container, gateway access, CA certificate, and management of all nodes, no matter what kind of chain, the management of its nodes is related to the management system, the purpose is to enable distributed applications such as blockchain to be available on the network Or get a very good management on the virtual data center. Based on the data center of this kind of blockchain, BSN connects everyone to form a new network. In the second layer of the current alliance chain, in addition to the Changan chain, other open source underlying frameworks have been adapted, and the integration of various public chains has also been completed overseas. In other words, BSN has integrated almost all blockchain technologies and has been connected to a network, so in BSN's virtual data center, no matter what kind of technology is required, it can be run in this environment.\\n\\n**The third layer is the portal layer.** BSN itself does not serve end users, but serves a BaaS portal, which means that when you want to build a blockchain BaaS, if you build it from the bottom, you have to build a complete blockchain cloud management environment. And BSN already supports all cloud and blockchain technologies, so we provide a set of APIs for the portal, you just need to build the front-end development and operation of BaaS services, users, fees, etc., and BSN can’t get you Any user data. Therefore, a core promotion of BSN is to build more portals. Now there are more than a dozen portals built in China, and all provinces are under construction. At present, Hong Kong portals are also online. South Korea, Turkey, Uzbekistan are under construction, Australia, the United Kingdom and other aspects. They are also under construction. Building a portal in each country actually serves its developers, and they are not even required to use the BSN bottom layer, because they can not only build portals, but also build data centers. In this case, their portals only need to adjust their own data center resources. , Which formed a format of its own. The development cost they bear is very low, usually 15 person-months. If there is a front-end, user management, and charging system, basically 5 to 10 person-months can build a BaaS system. Through the BSN empowerment platform, all portals have a set of software installed locally, so that 80% of the interactions are local interactions, and various portals can be built, such as alliance chain portals, private portals, and public chain portals. BSN supports standard alliance chains, public chains, open alliance chains, cross-chain services, IDE services for each chain, and public chain services for distributed storage. What needs to be emphasized here is that different countries have different laws on public chains. For example, public chains cannot run on servers in China because there is no real-name system, which violates the Internet's management methods. In addition, there is also a privatized deployment. You can deploy it in any local area network or private cloud, which is equivalent to a private cloud for the dedicated management of the blockchain, because the traditional cloud management system is effective in managing distributed applications. Not good. For example, there are 20 different blockchain applications in the private cloud, which means that 20 sets of CAs are installed. With this management alone, the traditional cloud management system is not enough, and BSN manages all together, saving a lot of worry .\\n\\nBy the way, overseas people often say that if BSN issues coins, everyone will buy it, but we will never do it with BSN. We are a technology company, and the entire BSN project is a low-level technology project and will never touch any applications.\\n\\n   The pattern of future blockchain technology  \\n\\nSo from the perspective of BSN, what are the differences and application scenarios of the current mainstream blockchains?\\n\\nIn terms of technical architecture, due to deployment and scenarios, blockchain is divided into three forms, which are actually a set of technologies. The first is a standard consortium chain, the second is a public chain, and the third is an open consortium chain. .\\n\\nThe standard consortium chain is used to build private chains and consortium chains. It is basically built for a certain business need. Several business parties or one business party use it by themselves, and others cannot enter. At present, the so-called blockchain in China is basically this way of building a private chain. Of course, the private chain has its own business scenarios, just like our current local area network, or like the government's government extranet, it is a local area network for its own use. But this is certainly not a scenario that will be widely used in the future, because each chain is an independent thing. Like the current local area network, its use scenario is definitely relatively narrow.\\n\\nThe public chain is a public chain, and it is owned by everyone. Each has its own node, forming a public chain mechanism. In order to gather everyone together, the public chain has designed a set of economic models, that is, virtual currency, including its reward mechanism, gas value, etc. However, this incentive mechanism and virtual currency have made the public chain unable to be an infrastructure. One of the problems caused by this economic model is that the cost is too high, and the cost is reflected in virtual currency, that is, the income of any business must also be virtual currency. For example, when a bank deploys a set of applications, it pays virtual currency and charges RMB handling fees. It is impossible for this type of application to run because the cost is uncontrollable. The cost of tomorrow may be three times the cost of today. The income is constant, so this is the current limitation of public chain applications. All applications made will revolve around virtual currency. Once it is separated from virtual currency, its economic model cannot be realized at all. So in terms of technical scenarios, the public chain is very, very narrow.\\n\\nThe third type is the open consortium chain. It is actually a public chain logic, but not everyone can join. Gas and virtual currency are to be eliminated in China. Therefore, the open consortium chain is not a public chain, but a public chain. Everyone can use the chain, so you don’t have to deploy your own environment and your own chain. You can deploy your business on a public chain and pay a little cost to get it up and running.\\n\\nThese three forms, one is similar to a local area network, one is similar to a public chain network in a special scenario, and the other is equivalent to a distributed cloud service. You can put your own things on an existing network. Let it run, let it handle the business. Below, we compare these three forms.\\n\\nThe consortium chain is its own, and it can only be joined if it is allowed to join.\\n\\nThe open consortium chain is generally open, but in accordance with China's Internet management rules, it is necessary to register for the real-name system on a certain platform. In addition, under the explanation, the most frequently mentioned BaaS-Backend as a Service generally refers to the standard consortium chain that can build a chain through the BaaS system. Why is BaaS needed? Because you need to generate a certificate, upload a public key, build a chain, and manage all aspects, it is more complicated, so you need a management interface to help you. The open consortium chain, in a strict sense, does not require an interface at all except for registration. After registration, you will get an interface document, hold your own certificate, and basically all operations are through the API. The open consortium chain can also set up a BaaS, but basically check the information, change your own key, etc., there is no business operation, business operations are generally done through API.\\n\\nThere is basically no BaaS in the public chain. No public chain requires an official portal to operate. In fact, it can be connected directly through a certificate, and the certificate does not require authorization. The open consortium chain is a consortium chain in the end, and it must be authorized when the certificate is accessed.\\n\\nThe core difference between the three is the cost, and the public chain is the highest. why? If you think about it, you will know that its so-called reward mechanism must be higher than the cost of cloud resources. Otherwise, who would join a public chain and mine? For the cloud resources consumed by a node of mine, the revenue of the coins you give me must be greater than it, and how many times greater than that, before I am interested in joining. so. In fact, its cloud resource cost is very high, which also means that you have no meaning to deploy traditional applications, unless it is a DeFi, NFT, and virtual currency is tied to it. All transactions are carried out in virtual currency, so I always think The public chain is an environment for speculating coins. As far as traditional applications are concerned, there is no possibility for large-scale popularization. Its economic model has resulted in not many people being able to use it.\\n\\nI personally always think that the open consortium chain will become the mainstream in the future, because you can't let each application party build an environment by itself, and the cost, management, and operation and maintenance costs are very high. BSN believes that the open consortium chain will one day become a currencyless public chain, that is, a public chain without a reward mechanism. Everyone joins in through the use of cloud services, so it will become a distributed cloud service in the future. Because it does not have a reward mechanism, it can have low gross profit. The gas paid by everyone is the income of all our nodes. If the amount of money is small, many people will withdraw, and if the amount of money is large, people will join. In the end, it must be a low gross profit. A set of infrastructure, at least all the banks we communicate with now hope to have such a thing. They pay for cloud services, but they run an infrastructure backed by everyone. There is a market for this. It's just that now everyone is so excited about speculation and no one cares about these things. We have communicated with almost the world's mainstream public chains. Only 1/3 of the people believe that the logic of this matter is valid, and only 10% of the public chains are willing to spend some time with us to study.\\n\\nSo I personally think that in the future, the future blockchain network will actually be formed by an open consortium chain, an open currency-free public chain. Of course, the cross-chain technology between chains is as simple as transferring from one website to another on the Internet now, which forms the future application scenario. The public chain is basically used for currency speculation. Various DeFi and NFTs are actually connected to virtual currencies. It is just a variant. The currency circle like exchanges and so on are all around virtualization. This is not bad. It has its own system. , But the public chain always claims that everything can run on it in the future, this is impossible.\\n\\nThe disadvantage of the open consortium chain is that everyone’s contracts are stacked on top of it, which is the same as the public chain, that is, you can adjust your contract by knowing your contract address. The privacy of public services must be slightly weaker. But its cost is definitely the lowest, and it doesn't need to build the environment, just like using tap water, how much cloud resources are used to pay how much. The private chain is just like the current local area network, you can use it yourself after you set it up. Others may not even find it, and the connection can't get in.\\n\\nWe believe that in 10 years, many chains will disappear. By then, the blockchain network will be 30% of the public chain, 50% of the open consortium chain, and 20% of the standard consortium chain. In addition, the future open consortium chain will include non-currency public chains. Chained.\\n\\nWe are making a very light set of communication protocols similar to HTTP, which is a network where any traditional system can form a broadcast communication with others. Now all public chains have a broadcast communication protocol, such as P2P, but we want to study several mainstream protocols, and then strip out a very light protocol, which can be installed as a plug-in in Tomcat or in a web server. Like HTTP, a string of codes and certificates can be implemented. You can form a communication network with 8 business parties. As for how your data interacts in this communication network, whether to build a consensus or not depends on the needs of your application layer. . So in the end, if there must be such a general communication protocol, it makes the communication between the various chains very easy, instead of being independent as it is now, then each chain is actually going to the application layer. What is my virtual machine? In this way, my consensus is how to deal with specific business, in fact, just like many websites now, each website can handle different business, but its underlying communication protocol is the same. This is an inevitable trend, and I personally think it will be realized in 10 years. This is why I said that many chains will disappear, and we care more about the open consortium chain.\\n\\nBSN Open Consortium Chain and BSN-DDC Network\\n\\nBecause BSN is a large network environment, many open consortium chains are now being built. One of our core principles is to allow well-known foreign public chains to come in as much as possible, because we believe that the technical system needs to be integrated, and we cannot stop contacting the public chain technology just because the virtual currency is blocked. One of our tasks is to bring in the technology of foreign public chains, but the premise is to achieve two points of compliance. The first is that nodes cannot be built randomly, so you will actually become a consortium chain. The second is to destroy the virtual currency and retain the Gas mechanism. You can use the legal currency in Alipay and WeChat to pay for Gas.\\n\\nThe transformation of each public chain's open alliance chain takes about 5 to 6 person-months. Now, including Ethereum, Cosmos, Algorand, etc., they are all coming in. They can at least do enterprise-level application service business in China. In fact, they also want to enter. In the big market of China.\\n\\nThere are currently 6 BSN open alliance chains, and there should be 20-30 by the end of 2022. Our original intention to establish multiple alliance chains is because of the diversity of technology, because each chain is different. Of course, some public chains are the bottom layer of Ethereum. This kind of BSN does not allow them to enter. We don’t want it. It is all based on Ethereum, but it is hoped that different chains can compete with each other, such as in development tools, contracts, virtual machines, and other underlying technologies. We believe that the competitive environment is particularly important. In the process, some will be eliminated, and some technologies with better user experience will be left in the end.\\n\\nThe next content, BSN, is the first time that it has been publicly disclosed. We will launch DDC-Distributed Digital Credentials Technology at the end of January 2022, which is essentially NFT. Just as we recognize that blockchain is a communication technology, we also understand NFT as a database technology. I hope to talk about what NFT is from the perspective of a technical person. In fact, NFT is a distributed, object-based, co-manageable micro-database technology or individual micro-database and data set technology.\\n\\nEveryone thinks NFT is sensitive, but I want to talk about why we think it is very good from a technical point of view. Let me give you an example. For example, in the current vehicle management office, when a car arrives at the vehicle management office, the owner needs to be registered. The car will be transferred in the future, and the new owner will be registered when the vehicle changes. The current situation is that no one can see the data of the DMV, and even if a third party makes adjustments, they need to apply for an interface from the DMV, so we don’t know the specifics of the car. Based on this thinking, 10 years later, can the DMV turn this central back-end system into a semi-open, distributed system, build a chain or build a set on a mainstream open alliance chain? Environment, each car generates 1 NFT, and can set permissions on it? Because the NFT itself is a data set, there can be many items of data, for example, this car has 20 items, then the first 8 items of data defined by the vehicle management office are for their own use, and the key given by the country can be used to operate, and others cannot move. . It gives the other 6 items of data to the car owner, and assigns his private key to these 6 items. The other 8 items are open to third parties such as insurance companies. They can check the public information of all cars in the country at any time, and which car accident Circumstances and insurance information are written in. In this way, the authority management of a car information data set will be diversified. From this, you can think of other fields and how many scenarios are applicable. So NFT technology actually turns a back-end central database into a front-end multi-party collaborative and co-management translucent database. I personally think that the more popular this technology and the deeper the understanding, the country is the favorite. This allows big companies to put data in a semi-public environment and give the country certain authority to supervise. Sometimes more transparent is actually better supervision.\\n\\nNFT is completely database technology, every technical person, imagine how much benefit can be brought by using this kind of database? Be sure not to associate NFT only with artworks or other things. You have to treat NFT as a data set, and it is on an open network. It can add countless layers of permissions and is programmable. It can handle certain businesses under common management. It's a great technology. In my opinion, in addition to communication, the greatest thing about blockchain technology is that there can be a semi-public database technology on the market. This is the reason why we are now launching relevant NFT content. But now the domestic NFT trend has broken the currency circle. Regulators feel that NFT is sensitive, so we changed its name to DDC-Distributed Digital Certificate Technology.\\n\\nThe BSN DDC network selected 10 of our open alliance chains to make the DDC network, and the technical systems between the chains are completely separated. Among them, 5 are public chains and 5 are domestic technologies, including FISCO BCOS of WeBank. Among them, 10 sets of contracts are defined as official DDC contracts, which are deployed by BSN. We guarantee that all generated DDCs are permanent, safe and transparent. On these 10 chains, you can also deploy your own NFT contract or DDC contract. The NFT or DDC generated based on these contracts will be managed by the application party if the BSN is not prepared. To generate a DDC for the preparation of a BSN, the final payment for a Gas is about a few cents. The costs generated on the 10 open consortium chains are not the same. The operator of each chain can define how much gas consumption should be charged. Finally, through competition, the cost will be as low as a few cents. You see, it only costs a few cents to generate a data set, and the cost is really very low.\\n\\nBSN is a project initiated by the National Information Center. After detailed communication with regulatory agencies, we feel that at least a regulatory model must be designed. First of all, the real-name system must be associated with each NFT and DDC, and high-frequency trading is not possible. We will This design is similar to T+3 and T+5 restrictions, and the official DDC will announce the frequency standard at that time. Once the transaction is high-frequency, it will have certain financial attributes, so it can be circulated but not high-frequency trading.\\n\\nThe DDC launch date is scheduled for January 25, 2022, and will be jointly announced by about 15 to 20 technology companies.\\n\\nDDC network nodes can be deployed outside the BSN. For example, local governments use 10 chains to deploy a set of nodes. This is allowed, and even some large manufacturers can deploy them if they wish. There are also several nodes outside the BSN, which will form a permanent network, which also relieves many people's doubts about whether the disappearance of the BSN will affect the DDC in the future. In addition, our official contract may be co-governance, which means that the contract is not managed by the BSN or Jujube Technology. It may be that more than 20 parties have to sign a private key to update the official contract. There will be a governance process next year.\\n\\nFinally, let’s talk about a characteristic of our China. Everyone focuses on redoing applications. Basically, there is nothing too low-level, so I advocate that as a technical person, we must see through the application to see its underlying logic. Just like when we look at blockchain technology, we don’t look at the interpretation of blockchain, but see that it is a set of communication protocols. NFT does not look at artwork or the association with virtual currency, but sees a Where else can database technology be used? These contents are not what business people or product people can see, only technical people can see it. Therefore, as a person with a technical background, there is a huge opportunity now. The next 10 years will be a huge change in database technology and communication technology. I suggest that you look at the bottom layer to study.\\n\\nAbout the Author  \\n\\nMr. He Yifan, currently the founder and CEO of Beijing Red Date Technology Co., Ltd., holds a bachelor's degree in computer science from the State University of New York at Stony Brook and a master's degree in business administration from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Business.
