"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Many individual investors â€” many of them, followers of a popular, juvenile, foul-mouthed Reddit page called [Wall Street Bets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) have gambled their savings for the chance of massively beating the stock market. One reddit user, u/glideoutside gambled **$260,000 into Tesla call options expiring on December 10th.** (Source found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rcuzbs/glideoutside_tsla_129_yolo_420k_155k_retirement/).)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DvXUktGRSF1sQoe2EiqgA.jpg?height=385&width=580)\\n\\nTesla has been a strong performer for the past few months, and has definitely shown strong upward swings in the past month from prices of $800 to $1250 per share. This is a 50%+ move in only one month from October to November. Tesla did well on its previous earnings (10/20) by surpassing earnings expectations by 15%.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lbcrkplXi5ST9U1v9AHOR.PNG?height=812&width=1777)\\n\\nIn contrast to buying shares of Tesla, buying call options means that the user has bet that Tesla prices will massively move and would definitely be higher than a certain out-of-the-money price by a given expiration date. (This is a lot of conditions to check off.) You can learn more about options on [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp).\\n\\nThe benefit is that the potential gains are unlimited; however, the downside is that the entire investment can potentially be lost if the conditions are not met by the expiration date. This Reddit user bought $420,000 Tesla options, betting that Tesla would be higher than: $1150, $1250, $1400, and $1515.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Tesla ended the day on December 10th at $1017, and this Reddit user lost **63%+ of their investment** or $260,000 within **a single day** as Tesla did not break out.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Hj0GRd7qUSUmO8csLtHHj.jpg?height=580&width=580)\\n\\nJust as a reminder, invest with what you can lose. And none of what I provide is financial advice.\\n\\nWhat do you think? Leave a comment with your thoughts.
