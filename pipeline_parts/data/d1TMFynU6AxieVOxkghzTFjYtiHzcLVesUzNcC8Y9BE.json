"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"We also published this article on Medium on Nov 4, 2021.\\n\\n[https://blog.20y.org/the-unit-a-community-managed-crypto-native-unit-of-account-80069bfb08a6](https://blog.20y.org/the-unit-a-community-managed-crypto-native-unit-of-account-80069bfb08a6)\\n\\nAs of today, those in the crypto-verse continue to fight about which currency will dominate the internet. Will it be Bitcoin, will it be Ethereum, will it be some other one? However, as the cryptocurrency space keeps unfolding, it’s clear we are continuing to diversify codebases and people’s risks into many different currencies. For this main reason, we need a **better way to measure value than currencies alone**.\\n\\n**The Unit** solves this problem by creating an index based on a **rules-based community-governed list of cryptocurrencies**. The Unit paper describes a list of requirements to include cryptocurrencies in the index. The list depends on supply, price, and volume.\\n\\nAt **[20y.org](https://20y.org/app/index)**, we display the charts of The Unit both in satoshis (a subunit of Bitcoin) and in finneys (a subunit of Ethereum), as shown below.\\n\\n![1 unit measured in satoshis](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9HSeOXFSG5wYp90ZookBF.png?height=948&width=1400)\\n\\n![1 unit in finneys](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a15SM-EKYyFg4Z41HYMep.png?height=948&width=1400)\\n\\nWe also display the list of cryptocurrencies that make up The Unit and a list of candidate cryptocurrencies. At the moment, the list of currencies in The Unit includes **23 cryptocurrencies**. In our simulations of The Unit’s past, we have a different list of coins that could change daily based on long-running averages of 30, 90, and 270 days of capitalizations and volume. At the moment, we have one currency that could potentially exit The Unit, noted by a red down-arrow, and one coin that could enter The Unit, indicated by a green up-arrow. The requirements are calculated once per day.\\n\\n![Partial list of cryptocurrencies in The Unit](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7YhYGkbOJ3PGSHzONvndY.png?height=948&width=1400)\\n\\nWe see The Unit as an **alternative to the dominance of USD** in defi projects. We think adopting a decentralized unit of account is necessary, and we are thinking of ways to involve the community in our efforts. If you believe what we are doing has merit and want to see it come to fruition, please join our discord (<https://discord.gg/4MjRckMJZN>). Also, if you’re excited and technically savvy, you are welcome to contact us and join our development team. We started a proposal on **Uniswap** to bring attention to our efforts and encourage defi projects to adopt The Unit while slowly drifting away from USD **(**<https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-discussion-the-unit-should-defi-platforms-replace-the-usd-as-a-unit-of-account/14741>).\\n\\nWe also see The Unit as becoming a benchmark for the crypto community. Measuring currencies’ performance in units is a better way to understand the evolution of each currency. Our [website](https://20y.org/app/index) contains the charts for each currency; you can view them by clicking on each specific coin. For example, below, we can see the charts of Solana and Litecoin in units (Ø).\\n\\n![Solana in units](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WhUFefVGtO4bjielU0kXa.png?height=827&width=1400)\\n\\n![Litecoin in units](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_Wt-4BEzguVEEg4LJxxXg.png?height=827&width=1400)\\n\\nTo appreciate the difference between counting in dollars ($) and counting units (Ø), we can compare the previous chart of Litecoin in units to the chart of Litecoin in dollars below. The striking differences are due to The Unit being an accurate measure of value in the crypto space while the dollar is a poor measure of long-term value.\\n\\n![Litecoin in dollars (USD)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4_zqeWKETqABu02mU0C4G.png?height=888&width=1600)\\n\\nThe Ethereum chart also shows a tremendous difference, with The Unit showing the actual value of Ethereum as a store of value in the crypto space.\\n\\n![Ethereum in units](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6fOMoopsNL6U8FQdCY6Vy.png?height=777&width=1400)\\n\\n![Ethereum in dollars](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kOn_17_Ft4dPVKceudGvW.png?height=901&width=1600)\\n\\nWe measured the long-term volatility of both Bitcoin and Ethereum against The Unit versus against USD and found they are radically different. The annual volatility of Bitcoin against The Unit is 0.235, while against USD it is 4.46; in the case of Ethereum, we obtained a similar ratio of 1.38 against The Unit versus 44.68 against USD. Thus, The Unit brings much more stability as a measure of value in the cryptocurrency space, 20 to 30 times more stable than USD.\\n\\nWe are continuing our research and development at 2ØY.
