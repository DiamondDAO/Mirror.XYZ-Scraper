"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Author Background:**\\nMendy Berrebi is the founder of Glass DAO.\\nThis proposal has been authored by myself.\\n\\n## Proposing NFT Collection: ‚ÄúVOC‚Äù\\n\\n### Terms\\n\\n*I am proposing an NFT collection for 15% stake from the DAO‚Äôs treasury to sell on the open market. This includes a 5% lifetime commission to the artist on all sales generated.*\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The Idea (if DAOs are the new LLCs)\\n\\nGlass is a for-profit DAO. We are a group of entrepreneurs and creators.\\n\\nIn the spirit of public companies and their IPOs, Glass will be issuing share certificates to shareholders of the DAO. Since ownership is the silver lining for any NFT use-case, it would make sense to issue different types of shares via an ERC-721 standard. These certificates will be publicly traded on the blockchain and anyone can buy/sell them on the open market.\\n\\nDepending on the level of ‚ÄúSkin in the game‚Äù, this collection will bear various titles and responsibilities for NFT holders (*more below #Membership-Ownership-Tier-System*).\\n\\n> *MVP of Glass DAO certificate coming soon!*\\n\\nWhen entrepreneurs act, they get it done. When poets write, they inspire.What happens when you put them together?üëá\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The Collection\\n\\nI drew inspiration from multiple origins. One in history, another from July 2nd, 2021.\\n\\n1. The first ever share issued in history: **VOC (or the Dutch East India Company)**.\\n2. The CityDAO Citizenship NFT Collection\\n\\n**VOC (or the Dutch East India Company)**\\nAs tribute to the first ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù Contract, Glass DAO will draw inspiration in look and feel of this certificate, detailing specific ownership of the DAO.\\n\\n![VOC share issued 1607/09 ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/km_oWNS1WGQ8IOFXS6zwp.jpeg?height=336&width=500)\\n\\n> ### Our collection name ‚ÄúVOC, or Voice of Community‚Äù.\\n\\n**CityDAO**\\nThe second source of inspiration came from CityDAO‚Äôs first set of NFTs.\\n\\nIt‚Äôs important to understand what they do to appreciate their collection. In short, Wyoming is the only location on earth accepting DAOs as legal entities.\\nAnd so, one day, on a sunny July, Scott Fitsimones tweeted:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/scottfits/status/1410724134468739076?s=20](https://twitter.com/scottfits/status/1410724134468739076?s=20)\\n\\nThis gave birth to a successful decentralized asset ownership community (so far). To date, CityDAO has 40+ acres of land in their treasury and a thriving community with over 10K members in it. CityDAO came up with ‚ÄúCitizenship‚Äù NFTs, as you can see in the tweet below.\\n\\n> ***Citizen NFT holders are citizens of CityDAO, granting community access and governance.***\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/sudoupdates/status/1474898761507741697](https://twitter.com/sudoupdates/status/1474898761507741697)\\n\\nYou can find out more about them [here](https://www.citydao.io/).\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Why this makes sense for Glass DAO\\n\\n* **üë©‚ÄçüöÄ     *Attracting top talent*** - Onboard community members in the crypto space, which can bring great ideas and proposals for the DAO and its mission.\\n* **üí∞     *Increase asset treasury from revenues generated in NFT launch***\\n* **üì£     *Increase brand awareness for Glass*** *-* since our community will launch this project, *if approved*, all of our members who have skills in business development, networking, marketing, social media, etc.. will partake in spreading the word and making this launch as successful and professional as possible.\\n\\n## What I need to fully execute on this proposal\\n\\n* **250,000 $MVG tokens (75% to Glass members / 25% community onboarding)**\\n* **A team of guerrilla marketers**\\n  * Blogging\\n  * Social media posting\\n    * Twitter\\n    * Discord\\n    * Instagram\\n  * Graphic design for visual content\\n    * Blog post headers\\n    * Social media attachments\\n    * Infographics\\n* **A team of guerrilla business developers**\\n  * Leverage social media to spread the word out and be advocate of Glass DAO\\n  * Build incentives to attract community members (25% of $MVG tokens associated to this)\\n  * Present Glass DAO powerpoint to your network (friends, business associates, family) - *presentation to be shared with all of you soon*\\n  * Host community events to engage with community\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Membership / Ownership Tier System\\n\\n**Common Stock NFT**\\n\\n**Tier 1**:     10% of Glass Supply - (10,000/10,000 to mint) \\\\[.25Œû mint\\\\]\\n**Tier 2**:     3% of Glass Supply - (150/150 to mint) \\\\[1Œû mint\\\\]\\n**Tier 3**:     2% of Glass Supply - (5/5 to mint) \\\\[5Œû mint\\\\]\\n**Tier 4**:     1% of Glass Supply - (1/1 to mint) \\\\[50Œû mint\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\*This will be an auction type sale, with a min. price set by us. Market mechanisms, however, can cause bidding wars + gas wars, hence increasing the value of these NFTs (depending on our work and other social factors)\\n\\n***Tier 1 - Common Stock NFT*** \\n -     Access to NFT / Digital Real Estate Investment newsletter \\n -     Land Airdrops\\n\\n***Tier 2 - Preferred Stock NFT \\n *** -    Access to NFT / Digital Real Estate Investment newsletter  \\n -     Land Airdrops  \\n -     Access to Discord Channel  \\n -     Voting Power\\n\\n***Tier 3 - Board of Directors NFT* \\n ** -    Access to NFT / Digital Real Estate Investment newsletter  \\n -     Land Airdrops  \\n -     Access to Discord Channel  \\n -     Voting Power  \\n -     Board of Directors NFT airdrop (exclusive)\\n\\n***Tier 4 - Chief Executive NFT***  \\n -     Access to NFT / Digital Real Estate Investment newsletter  \\n -     Land Airdrops  \\n -     Access to Discord Channel  \\n -     Voting Power  \\n -     Board of Directors NFT airdrop (exclusive to stakeholders)  \\n *-*     *Strategic advisor and Partner (added equity in DAO)*\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nIt would be interested to see how the market would react for a DAO to issue shares via NFTs the same way a company goes public. If something like this does exists in the DAO community, please let me know - I have yet to see it.\\n\\nThis marks the end of my proposal. I am open to suggestions if you have any.\\nSend me a private message on discord to discuss.\",\"timestamp\":1640522547,\"title\":\"[Proposal #1] NFT Collection by Glass DAO\"},\"digest\":\"23bExF40uD3PObR3rSg1UsBWM-J_wLffRVijyIbWlMo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xc7f7fAD0A723f648f052E60B7b8E007dCB85979A\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Uphe4yyU6KoqVcWuRKMiIHnPe3saIjnh1u6szfK9xfU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"bDMnxWb8PPaoV3KJUmRIDQZZiWzX1BU5iMKGK7c1meI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"DbBy-yHKo2rPp8AF8QpeM9CNZvWTeu8B9eGf2T6twd3TqWoIlgcMHwYVQn160I5Td5zi0tKW90dd8d17POft5g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf3536575017b7b405964fe3241c5ddaf3cf4ad41d995f2d017cc73c7136357e649fd9813e3f7f55e4fcfd85d0075e21ea161d7bc29db67124f180693cc606f191c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Uphe4yyU6KoqVcWuRKMiIHnPe3saIjnh1u6szfK9xfU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"bDMnxWb8PPaoV3KJUmRIDQZZiWzX1BU5iMKGK7c1meI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"9IDP5vc95oqm1AazhMESZ6-x8sqUFMlaoKWFsEjzaIg\"}"
