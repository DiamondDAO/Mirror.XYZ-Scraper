In response to a user asking if the ETH purchases meant he’d dumped his AVAX holdings for ETH, he said that he has “never sold AVAX” and simply “bought this ETH from whoever was financially illiterate enough to sell this weekend.”\\n\\nIn early November, Three Arrows Capital was announced as an investor in Blizzard, a fund to promote the development of AVAX. Following Zhu’s initial tweets, AVAX pushed out Dogecoin ([DOGE](https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index)) from its spot as the 10th-largest crypto by market capitalization. Zhu [tweeted](https://twitter.com/zhusu/status/1462334395637919750?s=20) a graph of AVAX’s growth captioned “top 10” in the hours before his U-turn.\\n\\n> Yes I have abandoned Ethereum despite supporting it in the past. \\n  \\n Yes Ethereum has abandoned its users despite supporting them in the past. \\n  \\n The idea of sitting around jerking off watching the burn and concocting purity tests, while zero newcomers can afford the chain, is gross.\\n>\\n> — Zhu Su (@zhusu) [November 21, 2021](https://twitter.com/zhusu/status/1462216210116853762?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\\n\\n***Related: [Three Arrows Capital executives launch NFT fund](https://cointelegraph.com/news/three-arrows-capital-execs-launch-nft-fund)***\\n\\nAt 23:34 UTC on Tuesday, 93,791.894 ETH was [moved](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc26daf42297b7c90b312860232a94fbbff83f03221dfb510fc196f96b33441a4) from the wallet belonging to 3AC to an address that appears to belong to a major trader.
