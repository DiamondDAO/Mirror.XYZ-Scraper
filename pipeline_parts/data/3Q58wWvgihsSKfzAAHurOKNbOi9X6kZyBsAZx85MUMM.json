"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"GM üëã fellow defi degens, apes, crypto-natives, bankless nation or simply people who are building the foundation of the metaverse. We are thrilled to join you in-arms as we build a borderless and premissionless world together.\\n\\n## PWN is for all crypto-natives\\n\\nWe are PWN, and our mission isn‚Äôt anything smaller than to pwn banks and tradfi: we're going to pry open access to financial services for everyone, regardless of their identity, ethnicity or social status.\\n\\nLet‚Äôs face it: if you are a crypto-native, your access to regular financial services is limited. Your net worth is in digital assets, and you work for... uhm what?... a DAO?\\n\\nBut now you want a roof above your head? That's what mortgages are for, right. So you apply for one. Too bad. You're worthless to a bank. You don‚Äôt stand a chance!\\n\\n## Not just OGs!\\n\\nSurprise surprise, not everyone in crypto is a millionaire. Digital assets and cryptocurrencies are becoming a new normal for entire generations. People can earn money, pay for services (groceries or rent) without needing to trust banks to manage their money, and it's catching on.\\n\\nPWN is here for all crypto-natives. We are tired of the gate-keeping that traditional institutions enforce on law abiding citizens, and we're willing to dedicate our lives to push technological boundaries to provide the same opportunities to our kin.\\n\\nIt wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if financial services, like credit loans or mortgages, weren't ultimately a rigged market. Even for a millennial the outlook for ever owning a home are dim. The millennials and gen z's in crypto are stuck waiting for token pumps to get theirs, while holding into a day job to slowly pay off their student loans.\\n\\n## Metaverse is the fresh start\\n\\nAssuming that everybody is a criminal or a terrorist is simply *not* the best place to begin. Luckily Ethereum fixes this!\\n\\nLet‚Äôs put it this way: for democratic systems to be truly based on \\\"vox populi\\\", then the ‚Äòmajority‚Äô of people should be assumed to be well-intended, and less interested breaking the rules that they themselves imposed. The vast majority want to live simple lives, without having to deal with ‚Äòthe game‚Äô, but they will play along. But here in the real world, with a well-intended majority or not, everyone has to comply with surveillance and endless bureaucracy. Otherwise, you are a criminal.\\n\\nThe Metaverse is a chance to start over and test things before production. Metaverse enables us to create social systems which are opt-in, based around communities and where values and culture can evolve with ever-accelerating speed. Metaverse is borderless, built bottom-up by geeks, and it's for everybody.\\n\\n## Our Mirror mission\\n\\nOn Mirror, we‚Äôll be publishing community-focused content and sharing our views on where our community and industry are headed. Look out for regular platform updates, and for the latest PWN features.\\n\\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/33861](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/33861)\\n\\n## It's PWN, not PWN!\\n\\nAs you can see, we are pretty bad at branding, so we don‚Äôt even have a unified view on how to spell ‚ÄúPWN‚Äù. Ultimately, we‚Äôll leave it up to you, the community, and just go with what sticks!\\n\\nGN Metaverse! We‚Äôll be here when you wake up again :)\\n\\nIf you are curious about what we build or you want to get involved: \\n\\nJoin our discord: \\n\\n[https://discord.pwn.finance/](https://discord.pwn.finance/)\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter: \\n\\n[https://twitter.com/PWNFinance](https://twitter.com/PWNFinance)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1635364191,\"title\":\"Hello Metaverse!\",\"publication\":\"pwn\"},\"digest\":\"OykTiudj5VD6YzzO9zVpNsZPX7LoiXYIDTV9l6Hd6wc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6C8de5672469d2E685F643d3201921197A47f639\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hpQaWRNsmCFbNVsEKLR5xTBTe13WB6fxxmLCh4NFfDY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZUAfnbiiqRtozpX3K5tZJcWR_3hpATIB6zYvTTq8Alc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ZPrEBanWCyWF-lZBxzetc-WD8GdwzL5n62D3IYhhsmq8pQi0BNAdqv_LKDzR4eZaihFfFCpbXUMsEXE1XErfaA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe81f436ed68b5471224dd3a2997af3d4be515f865f1ceec62bccb1b4c5717da93d18bc48ebbf732544a8c49ca1c9bddd525daf72165caded639082c18d09f3c71b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hpQaWRNsmCFbNVsEKLR5xTBTe13WB6fxxmLCh4NFfDY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZUAfnbiiqRtozpX3K5tZJcWR_3hpATIB6zYvTTq8Alc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"7peG3_VAqEnN2asEIxnyEcvFObeBBGnr_1fmphTmGWw\"}"
