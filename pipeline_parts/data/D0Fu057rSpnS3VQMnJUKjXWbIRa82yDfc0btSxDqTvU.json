Data or stats are not authoritative and picked from scans of tweets, discord , telegram reddit etc 2021 Q4 and some references are provided. In case of any misses do let me know and I will update. *These notes are more cheat sheet then a wiki*\\n\\n*I use the trading ticker rather then name and for example for Axi Infinity blockchain game $AXS implies the coin or token and AXS implies the foundation/DAO/founders as appropriate*\\n\\n**Status : DRAFT**\\n\\n## Basics\\n\\nCosmos ( ATOM )  is a modular blockchain with an Internet-of-blockchain vision. It assumes a  many independent parallel blockchains  , each powered by POS classical BFT (Byzantine-Fault Tolerant) consensus algorithms like [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/). Developers can easily build custom *application specific blockchain*s, called Zones, through the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/) framework. These Zones connect to Hubs, which are specifically designed to connect zones together.\\n\\nMany other chains like Binance Chain and Terra Luna use Tendermint. ATOM is estimated to provide up to 1,000 tps per Hub/spoke with fast confirmation and estimated 10,000 tps with several zones.\\n\\nThe idea for Cosmos came about in 2014 from Jae Kwon a Computer science graduate from Cornell University. Eventually, a team of Jae Kwon, Zarko Milosevic and Ethan Buchman formed for Tendermint(All in Bits Inc)  a practical BFT toolkit and a contributor to Cosmos SDK supported by  Interchain Foundation (ICF)was formed around the project . The Cosmos main net was officially launched in 2019.\\n\\nCosmos had 40K MAU and 40 active zones\\n\\n### Price Action\\n\\n$ATOM 52 week Low to High return in 2021 was 572% and 6.294 USD ( Jan 1) - 32.431 USD (Dec 31) for 415.27% return in 2021 \\n\\n![snapshot 19 Jan 2022](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gygocmxj5BzZNHFoMFQSy.PNG?height=364&width=857)\\n\\n### Stats and Links\\n\\n \\n\\n* [Website](https://cosmos.network/)   [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cosmos) [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tendermint/) [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork) [Telegram](https://t.me/cosmosproject) [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/CosmosProject) [Github](https://github.com/cosmos) [Explorer](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos)\\n\\n\\n* 300K+ Twitter, 55K+ Reddit, 19K+ Telegram\\n\\n  ## Technical\\n\\n  Cosmos assume a app specific blockchain as Zones and an ability to communicate between zones using the [Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol](https://cosmos.network/ibc) (aka “IBC”) and Hubs as a Hub-Spoke \\n\\n![Hub and Spoke Architecture](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PdJbvbLRLtx6Y4MVBND5F.PNG?height=463&width=565)\\n\\n**Consensus**\\n\\nTendermint uses POS and all validators to communicate with one another to reach consensus ( no random or epoch based subset). Tendermint consensus is practically  limited to around 200 validators / zone before performance starts to degrade.Blocks in Tendermint are finalized as soon as they receive 2/3 + 1 signatures from validators .\\n\\nTendermint uses a 2 phase process with pre commit and pre vote\\n\\n![https://blockgeeks.com/guides/cosmos-blockchain-guide/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gyFCYIdgZ79TmKGGyG72w.png?height=396&width=493)\\n\\nHowever, when a network splits, the protocol chooses not to make further progress until more than 2/3 of the validators come to an agreement again. This choice should ensure that there is always “one source of truth” and that the blockchain always maintains consistency. \\n In Cosmos, stakers (sometimes called delegators) assign their stakes to validators. \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MgSEKlJUK95jZHN-7K0xn.png?height=355&width=720)\\n\\nCosmos Hub is the centerpiece of the ecosystem. Its main task is to account for the total number of tokens in each zone (blockchain) in the ecosystem, so that zones can directly transfer tokens to each other.\\n\\nThe IBC locks a certain number of $ATOM tokens in the first blockchain (zone), then sends confirmation and validation to the second zone, after which the previously locked tokens are released on the second blockchain. This scheme facilitates the release and creation of tokens representing assets on other blockchains.\\n\\n In the IBC architecture, messages to be sent are  physically relayed via “Relayers”. “Relayers” run off-chain and continuously scan thestate of each ledger via a light client connected to each of the 2 chains and can also execute transactions on another ledger when outgoing datagrams have been committed. For correct operation and progress in a connection between two ledgers, IBC requires only that at least one correct and live relayer process exists which can relay between the ledgers. The relay process must have access to accounts on both chains with sufficient balance to pay for transaction fees. Relayers may employ application-level methods to recoup these fees, such by including a small payment to themselves in the packet data.\\n\\nCurrently these zones and IBC relayers do not need to accrue and use $ATOM for fees but *there is a proposal to do so and offload zones from maintaining tokens of other chains for transfers*\\n\\n*286 Mill Tokens in circulation* \\n\\n## App Ecosystem\\n\\n250+ apps on [Cosmos zone](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/apps) .  Gravity is a DEX native to Cosmos and Osomosis is a DEX on its own appchain using IBC to use Cosmos Hub.  \\n\\n[Coin98 Infographic](https://twitter.com/Coin98Analytics/status/1455596402612998145?s=20)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kVOztvAQbU_BqTthYruyK.jpg?height=1406&width=2500)\\n\\n**IBC-Enabled Chains**\\n\\nCosmos Hub, Secret Network, IRISnet, Akash, Crypto.com, Persistence, Regen Network, Sentinel, Osmosis, Starname, SifChain, Terra, Band\\n\\n Akash ($AKT) is an attempt to offer spare compute capacity AWS style in a  decentralized fashion, Kadena ($KDB ) a POW blockchain improving on Bitcoin performance and Terra $LUNA and  BSC (Binance)  $BNB are large Layer 1 Chain  and more See [Cosmos Ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/tokens/) worth around 60 Billion USD in 28 IBC enabled chains and 150 Billion Mcap in 49 apps and services (19 Jan 2022)  \\n Gravity is a  [Ethereum-Cosmos](https://blog.althea.net/gravity-bridge/) bridge.\\n\\nUnlike $DOT  Polkadot or  Ethereum V2 which requires same set of validators Cosmos allows eaxh zone to have its own set giving more sovereignty. Thus app specific zones can tailor security and EVM needs. They can use [Ethermint](https://blog.stakin.com/an-introduction-to-ethermint/) to be compatible with Ethereum\\n\\n \\n\\n### Sentiment\\n\\nInterchain  Foundation  managed to raise around $16 million in a 2017 ICO. Cosmos has not done much marketing incentives and has managed to have many validators like Binance , Coinbase, Kraken, Paradigm, Multichain ventures stake $ATOM . \\n [Cosmostarte](https://medium.com/@Cosmostarterio/cosmostarter-tokenomics-distribution-3433ea8b1cd6)r is a accelerator program to bring projects on baord to Cosmos .[Tendermint Ventures](https://tendermint.com/ventures/) supports the Cosmos Ecosystem through strategic investments in promising projects.The Interchain Foundation provides [grants, service agreements](https://interchain.io/funding/), full-time employment and investments.\\n\\n**Cons**\\n\\n Cosmos Network was one of the earliest protocols to target the interoperability niche but  many , like Polkadot and Avalanche, have gained popularity and name recognition. With many DeFi applications trying to bridge other siloed blockchains, such as Anyswap and Ren, and special bridges like Hop protocol this is a crowded space now.\\n\\n### Readings\\n\\n[Intro to the Cosmos Network | Sunny Aggarwal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hREydu6Llac)\\n\\n<https://crypto-wikipedia.com/what-is-cosmos/>\\n\\n[How to Turn a $17 Million ICO Into $104 Million: The Cosmos Story](https://alephzero.org/blog/what-is-the-fastest-blockchain-and-why-analysis-of-43-blockchains/)\",\"timestamp\":1642697223,\"title\":\"L1 ATOM Cosmos\"},\"digest\":\"bqseqTU5MqaPU3Qho9QVMxS92f-277w6gyD3aUw_rro\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xDc297742D7DDB3714a3482B45272d991f28e7406\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"M47WlqhKjaKGt3CyA7jsEN1gxRXYXD7uYDLM0IF9OlA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3b9yxHNxv-8fRaJ9TgPASm2MNQV4QXOYfEH2nhkdqEk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"DsLd3UBP0eB5QcnbvVCOylPRTJdBFKQuZBaQRqzvDXZOxK_oVE7to0b0dL_g4RwJzMQ7qHAN0pmenwmGZroxSw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe5db9e01678ccd41532871d8247d30f330fe7b3047c9b238795c2dc3de8304277283eb473bf7de664cfb5c4bcdd1f47467c6a994aa38ed47769e3675b7921a8e1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"M47WlqhKjaKGt3CyA7jsEN1gxRXYXD7uYDLM0IF9OlA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3b9yxHNxv-8fRaJ9TgPASm2MNQV4QXOYfEH2nhkdqEk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"bqseqTU5MqaPU3Qho9QVMxS92f-277w6gyD3aUw_rro\"}"
