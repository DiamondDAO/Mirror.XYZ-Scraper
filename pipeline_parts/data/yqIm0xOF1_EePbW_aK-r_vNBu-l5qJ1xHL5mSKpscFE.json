Political Lens:\\n\\nThe sight at the end of this barrel is unpleasant. It's an endless pit of greed, pain, suffering, & surveillance. Leaders across the globe are taking advantage of these circumstances by peddling hope to the gullible while colluding with the powerhouses.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hVuwmPWwluU6K5yxjI1Ib.jpg?height=680&width=680)\\n\\nGood resources to delve deeper.

The Social Lens:\\n\\nHere's the [International Labour Org](https://twitter.com/ilo) 2021 report - an estimated 8.8 percent of total working hours were lost - the equivalent of the hours worked in one year by 255 million full-time workers\\n\\n[https://www.ilo.org/global/research/global-reports/weso/trends2021/WCMS_795453/lang--en/index.htm](https://www.ilo.org/global/research/global-reports/weso/trends2021/WCMS_795453/lang--en/index.htm)\\n\\nAround half of the losses were due to reduced hours of those employed ( shorter to zero working hours,) while the remaining half was due to outright employment losses, which directly translates to a drop in labor income and an increase in poverty.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9cALNc1x2L-fsCgZqYZTu.png?height=287&width=601)\\n\\nWhile certain economies are inching back the hybrid work has had a toll on the employees.
