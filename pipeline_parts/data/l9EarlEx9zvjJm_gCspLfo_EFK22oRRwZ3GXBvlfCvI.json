"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"One virtual world is being reimagined with nonfungible tokens (NFTs) is [Neopets](https://www.neopetsmetacollection.com/), the virtual pet website. The team has announced the launch of their IP on the blockchain to provide new and improved user experiences. For those unfamiliar, Neopets is one of the very first online games to allow users to adopt a pet that they can explore the vast world with. Neopets can be raised, homes could be built, and rare items could be found. \\n\\nOver the last two decades, millions of people have engaged with Neopets characters in their virtual world of Neopia and shared it with their friends on mobile and desktop. Even those who didn't play have supported the community with a collection of their branded items. With recent innovations involving Web 3.0, the team behind the lovable characters wants to open the door to [NFT collectors](https://cointelegraph.com/news/navigating-the-nft-minefield-it-should-be-made-easy-for-first-time-buyers) and the growing cryptocurrency audience, many of whom have played or experienced Neopets in their youth. Launching the brand on Web 3.0 will give such users a chance to experience and join the history of Neopets. While the experiences play off each other, it is important to note that the metaverse will exist independently from the current Neopets website.\\n\\nIn the launch of Neopets Metaverse NFTs, 20,500 algorithmically generated Neopets will be brought to life. Their team shares, \\\"Neopets aims to leapfrog into Web 3.0 with its future development of Neopets Metaverse project on the Solana blockchain.\\\"\\n\\nEach Neopet in the collection is different, being programmatically generated from over seven other traits categories, including character, gender, emotion, skin, background, headgear and bodywear. These pets will be launched on the Neopets Metaverse Collection on Raydium's DropZone. \",\"timestamp\":1634465649,\"title\":\"One platform tries to rejuvenate gamers’ favorite childhood memories using Web 3.0 \"},\"digest\":\"lPRhAUtyBjMwSi1l_AnBMT1F_hsW8Dg5u94wg7AQP4s\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xc304261790CC409BD2e128f2AC77601D492F4e7c\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bk9g_cUM1DTF1I97fKJ1Mo-_pet2QBOjogdE2GI9BeE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xMsG0FKcERadpYGw5I_62tSozNWGkTjdFNJWGBm8GGU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"tQNxUxpcnr_tnHBmQMJaALQBTuBJOqQWDt2UnGrDbCKRlaJdFRj7iz-xJsZnOYBU2KOyR6cI-uxB3m5vKFhZLg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf0beb5d9cde8f8e404033431091f0da05b8b2f77d1e6d6dc5b40eb4dd82da22e73747346818cad42165906e412fe945ff0f9f80679a191e74c42abd2552c0e2f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bk9g_cUM1DTF1I97fKJ1Mo-_pet2QBOjogdE2GI9BeE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xMsG0FKcERadpYGw5I_62tSozNWGkTjdFNJWGBm8GGU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"lPRhAUtyBjMwSi1l_AnBMT1F_hsW8Dg5u94wg7AQP4s\"}"
