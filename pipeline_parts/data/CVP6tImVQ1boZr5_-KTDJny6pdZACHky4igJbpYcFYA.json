"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Our Chief of Marketing and graphic designer vvarren.eth has been working tirelessly to build out our NFT World Map. You may have seen the first draft, which effectively summed up our development aspirations. In comparison, V2 is considerably more exhaustive. The map has been split up into three versions - the full map composite with existing constructions and new proposals, the map of only existing constructions, and the map of only proposals. The DAO [recently voted “YES”](https://snapshot.org/#/muse.eth/proposal/0xc93d9c6a90b7792d6ed74a9f1038fe45c1a1dd6dff676764198c2aacbf563fd7) with a quorum of 47 votes in favor of authorizing its first grant from the treasury, $250 to our in-house team to begin  building the proposals depicted in the map below.\\n\\n![Full composite map](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LvYZ2Zx9wSxAuAmbmukfX.png?height=754&width=817&&size=large)\\n\\nIn addition to the $250 grant from the DAO’s treasury, our plan is to build a few high-profile projects first so they can be auctioned to raise further construction and/or marketing funds.\\n\\n![Current Map as of December 29, 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sNUUbb4HlN0izZX6X2lwe.png?height=754&width=817&&size=large)\\n\\nAs it currently stands, our NFT World has everything in place to begin full development. There are two developing nations, Nordurgar and Freyagard, as well as an ungoverned wilderness area. Freyagard is a democratic nation of peace and wisdom, whereas the monarchy of Nordurgar worships power and innovation. A complex infrastructure system including trains and roads links these two nations, and the network will be expanded to Border City and Beach City. Perhaps the wilderness is where the true fun is being had… rumor has it, stealthy farmers brew the meanest Sawturf Sally in the entire world, a good that is extremely sought after in international markets. You are unable to choose your faction, as the housing unit mint is random; however, if you own multiple MUSEdao member tokens, there is a high chance you will receive housing units in the three nations. Otherwise, you can visit the secondary market to find the perfect house for your needs.\\n\\n![Map of proposals, construction to begin December 31 and conclude January 14.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/odIi9UyHiXRAg-NDdHJYA.png?height=754&width=817&&size=large)\\n\\nNow that the DAO has voted YES to our development proposal, we will set the wheels in motion for this ambitious project. Funds will be transferred to USD today and distributed to our team of builders in segments of $20. Each transaction will be documented and receipts will be posted to this [proposal’s page in the Discord.](https://discord.com/channels/923400872849977384/925212627691503636)\\n\\nThe world will have a total of 1,000 housing units, distributed randomly through a free mint only for MUSEdao members. Common housing units include anything in the wilderness (with the exception of house boats), and apartments in any of the cities. Rare housing units include any houses and cabins. Ultra-rare housing units include treehouses, the lighthouse, and (house)boats. Legendary housing units include underwater lairs and skyscraper penthouses. There will only be one royal housing unit, and that is the castle of Nordurgar, which we are proposing to be sold to finance additional construction. If new housing types are added over time, we will vote to determine their rarity.\\n\\nThe idea is that each housing unit will belong to a block. For example, each apartment building will be its own mini-dao, with apartments having governance over their own building. The penthouse has the exclusive right to make a proposal to rename the building, which would then go up to vote for all residents. There is even potential down the line to build in a treasury funded by 'HOA' or some sort of mechanism. Just to give you a sense of the potentials here.\\n\\nWe’re on a tight schedule, as the goal is to complete the construction of around 900 housing units in just two weeks. Should the project appear to be going over schedule or over budget, updates will be shared with the DAO and a solution will be reached - though we expect $250 and two weeks will get the job done in-house. Stay tuned for updates as we work on this project!\",\"timestamp\":1640791713,\"title\":\"NFT World Map V2\"},\"digest\":\"7kwo9a0h-UrUv_hUaygkGRQ8h8f7toNHWnv2BxLb0mY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x08fA99A691BC8A56328a1CFd95020E4Ad9eeEce3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"y5T2Ft0eTLn7cxc2lpH2fbLP9m6g2sP0zaW8GlPPyAo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"H4Kudyw1fPYJBDhqrFFMZQ_6W95BgzZS8Ih0GbXYXLc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"oV6-sVT4v_xhZUpHu6mLoZWfCYgLTwaWnhZKvfYo8cEfBdszbRwkql0Rq_iRxBLkalLJsbroK_J1LkRMLT3NMg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf251a18f75d866bf437f8e5ac120e0685c92f9707831baf0b0677cfac7ed80507ce8ced590b468edefd4b30eb0ce0641445f4f9a436654189070eb38e3cf938c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"y5T2Ft0eTLn7cxc2lpH2fbLP9m6g2sP0zaW8GlPPyAo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"H4Kudyw1fPYJBDhqrFFMZQ_6W95BgzZS8Ih0GbXYXLc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"XShPVjq2qngqtKTcdXUSCxNYQ3Xala2uMNdSf1NXAsk\"}"
