"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Seeing Like a State\\n\\nThere is a wonderful book that has been appearing often enough in my various discussions that I’ve become compelled to read it. That book is [Seeing Like a State](https://libcom.org/files/Seeing%20Like%20a%20State%20-%20James%20C.%20Scott.pdf), by James C Scott, and it describes how States change the world so that the world becomes “legible” to the State.\\n\\nThe State needs things to be legible in order to administer them. Nomadic people need to be settled, forests need to be tamed, names need to be rendered orderly. It is only thus that the State can then do its thing. Anything outside the bounds is “[beyond the pale](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/beyond_the_pale)”, or unable for the State to administer. It is dangerous territory.\\n\\nSo, for instance, a State needs to be able to clearly “read” who each person is. and so every person has an defined name identity. In the particular context of the Anglo world, a defined surname. This was not always the way, and dissolves centuries of nuanced local names, but was required if a State was to be able to identify its citizens.\\n\\nAnd there are many more examples. Prussian forestry was unable to see natural, wild forest as valuable, and so, to make the forest legible and thus value-able, the forest had to be converted into plantations. Now the forest was able to be understood, the number of trees calculated, the practices to improve productivity optimised and so on. Of course, this collapsed the natural richness and complexity of the ecosystem, and in so doing, destroyed a considerable amount of value, however this value was never “legible”.\\n\\nIt was in the conversion of complex localism to simplified scale that items become “legible”.\\n\\n## How is this relevant to waste?\\n\\nAs I read the book, and also read the commentary on the book, I realise that waste is, in large part, create because it is material that is “illegible” to its generator. Hear me out.\\n\\nIn the context of waste, the management of materials is a function of scale. More particularly, the scale of materials being managed needs to match the scale of resources available to decision makers.\\n\\nThe dumping of 1,000 tonnes of glass as waste, for instance, would be unthinkable for a local community, and yet is commonplace for a Materials Recovery Facility that sorts recycling bins and has to deal with the contaminated “glass fines” that pass through the system. This glass is not legible to the MRF operator because it is low value. Its generation would be impossible for the local community.\\n\\nTaking the notion further, the operation at scale NECESSARILY creates more waste. This is because administration at a large scale can only deal with large things. Large organisations are leveraged, this is the point of a large organisation, and part of what is lost is the efficiency of using materials. For example, entire office fit-outs torn out and discarded because there is no ability to interrogate different ways to recover the materials. Scale makes the cost of paying attention to detail increase, whereas the value of that detail does not change.\\n\\nScale is the enemy of resource efficiency.\\n\\nNow that’s quite a controversial statement given most recyclers would argue that they need scale to make their operations commercially viable. Which is, of course, true, because their threshold for viability has increased.\\n\\nTo make the materials legible to the corporation, the scale needs to be increased, the materials need to be treated as a standardised commodity, and processes must be able to implemented without thought. Materials that are illegible in these ways become waste and are discarded.\\n\\n## The power of community scale\\n\\nTo go to the other end, it is simple and straightforward for a community to recover seeds from old crops, to create stock feed, mulch and compost from residuals and pay attention to soils. These materials are legible at the scale of community, and they are meaningful.\",\"timestamp\":1638879784,\"title\":\"Legibility and waste\"},\"digest\":\"tZIRhcZ0zLl6TxwBQTDHSfC_56sF4d9X1vW-KzuyzkM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x29b2B813dE1eDff985ea63FDd255c995d1171D59\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Ftdacak51FJ3Y3gy-JdAg2p84AWCsmIYwM1ZZy_K4G0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QpGHcXiFp5GTzsPIkg3vAjhAUNBevaEjOE5ollmKtUU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"OU19lBidH3pmrsuPalbYSA-IuVyy9XizjXvgirpqdRtw44lTPQX0EyirPLxn5suwLNbGPPeZiwDA5jLR614mLA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb1253f9bf4e22576e3cfbe81d6b04a8c4091208065aaab2637059c2c3541633153d81148e40c6ac3698651e573bff81e9691cfd8c46b66362d48235b0f46c6cc1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Ftdacak51FJ3Y3gy-JdAg2p84AWCsmIYwM1ZZy_K4G0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QpGHcXiFp5GTzsPIkg3vAjhAUNBevaEjOE5ollmKtUU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"tZIRhcZ0zLl6TxwBQTDHSfC_56sF4d9X1vW-KzuyzkM\"}"
