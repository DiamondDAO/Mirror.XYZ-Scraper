"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The blockchain market needs a new revolution.\\n\\nIn such a new revolution, we need to further straighten out the relationship between blockchain and the Internet, rather than just confuse them: face up to the reality that the Internet era has ended, find a new positioning for the Internet in the blockchain era, so as to better promote the development of blockchain.\\n\\nIn such a new revolution, we need to further enrich the technical connotation and significance of blockchain, not just limit it to Nakamoto's world: innovate the underlying technology of blockchain, improve the business system of blockchain, and straighten out the relationship between blockchain and digital currency to the greatest extent.\\n\\nIn such a new revolution, we need to further expand the application examples and scenarios of blockchain, rather than just regard coin issuance or ICO as its ultimate destination: build a decentralized new world with blockchain, so that each individual can give full play to his own light and heat in this new world, Instead of just playing the role of being harvested as in the Internet age.\\n\\nOn the surface, this is still a continuous evolution and application revolution of blockchain technology. In essence, it is more like a great liberation and innovation of cognition and thought.\\n\\nIf we only focus on blockchain technology and ignore the great emancipation and innovation of blockchain thought and cognition, the so-called blockchain is still just a self Hi Game and can not really connect with people's production and life. This is the fundamental reason why blockchain advocates and digital currency advocates argue endlessly. Blockchain advocates believe that their technology is invincible and disadvantageous; Advocates of digital currency believe that wealth is the standard to measure everything.\\n\\nBehind each other's frivolity, it reveals the embarrassment that blockchain technology has not formed a real business closed loop. To solve this problem, the closed loop of blockchain technology and application cannot be achieved.\\n\\nThe early development model of blockchain led by issuing coins or ICO has been proved to be a mistake. We can clearly recognize this by looking at the response of the competent authorities. At first glance, the blockchain has formed a commercial closed loop. In essence, such a seemingly reasonable commercial closed loop is only caused by the \\\"front\\\" of the mature blockchain or the \\\"back\\\" of the Internet.\\n\\nBoth \\\"pre\\\" and \\\"post\\\" are out of focus on the blockchain. The seemingly wonderful closed-loop is just a trick of self deception. Only the closed-loop constructed in a tightly fitting commercial sense will have incomparable advantages.\\n\\nThis requires us to emancipate and innovate the blockchain in thought and cognition, and start the great development of blockchain from the commercial level to the technical level.\",\"timestamp\":1638976939,\"title\":\"Blockchain needs a revolution\"},\"digest\":\"NYBvuxHFAJi_lTc7zufXWQbM_mAwTLjV2b417ShT6oQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3D9aD102B864a25B50980855C76d6A7E53D82122\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GxzQQ5T9ngDH5I9gK8Bl0jonfHD4hnix7qfEwX25eyE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"e-pKZE4gWb8vbmHpNpCJnHeFZ2BjaixlQtFXoOWMVQo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"5uNP0kEAVCxv88QeAnmWINdSjL5ZN6mPH_hyOnE7ozxKkrmrUjBHTugjomn0t6ft5I-mj1PIVRAN3oESMXxg1w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x450bded6533a4302fedb1af7e32536837068797ec90d9c8cd18f8da6feabe69f621f84dfd5fa8c559c7cc2bae3e52dc6042d502d77265058e50c1fb9d3272f2c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GxzQQ5T9ngDH5I9gK8Bl0jonfHD4hnix7qfEwX25eyE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"e-pKZE4gWb8vbmHpNpCJnHeFZ2BjaixlQtFXoOWMVQo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"NYBvuxHFAJi_lTc7zufXWQbM_mAwTLjV2b417ShT6oQ\"}"
