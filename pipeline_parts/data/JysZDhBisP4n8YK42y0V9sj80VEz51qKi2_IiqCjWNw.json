"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"[@terra_money](https://twitter.com/terra_money) is one of my favorite ecosystems in [#crypto](https://twitter.com/hashtag/crypto?src=hashtag_click) right now. \\n  \\n There's a lot of exciting projects launching in the space and using it for [#DeFi](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeFi?src=hashtag_click) is a great experience. \\n  \\n The entire ecosystem is designed around the [$UST](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24UST&src=cashtag_click) stablecoin. \\n  \\n Here's how it works \\n\\n1/ The Terra founder [@stablekwon](https://twitter.com/stablekwon) has emphasized that Terra's most important product is the stablecoin [$UST](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24UST&src=cashtag_click). \\n  \\n This is the beauty of Terra. It's a whole [#DeFi](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeFi?src=hashtag_click) ecosystem designed around a stablecoin \\n 2/ [$LUNA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LUNA&src=cashtag_click) is the native token of the Terra ecosystem. \\n  \\n LUNA is used to pay for transaction fees, and to help the UST algorithmic stablecoin maintain its $1 peg. \\n  \\n üåñ [$LUNA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LUNA&src=cashtag_click) has amazing tokenomics - keep reading..\\n\\n3/ Some stables like [$USDT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24USDT&src=cashtag_click) and [$USDC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24USDC&src=cashtag_click) are centralized, and are supposedly backed by real dollars in a bank or equivalent assets. üè¶ \\n  \\n [$UST](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24UST&src=cashtag_click) is a decentralized, algorithmic stablecoin that has a $1 pegged value. \\n  \\n Decentralized finance should have a decentralized stablecoin. [#DeFi](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeFi?src=hashtag_click)\\n\\n4/\\n\\n1 UST = $1. There are two mechanisms that help maintain this peg.\\n\\n1. $1 worth of $LUNA can be burned to mint 1 UST at any time (üî• üåî --> üíµ)\\n2. $1 worth of $UST can be burned to mint $1 worth of LUNA at any time (üî• üíµ --> üåî)\\n\\nHope this infographic helps explain!\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DGMOzf17RwxT9WiGo_RmE.png?height=900&width=675)\\n\\n5/ Let's see how this works. Suppose UST deviates from its peg, and is now worth $1.10\\n\\nUsing mechanism #1 above, you could profit from this arbitrage:\\n\\n1. Buy $1 worth of LUNA\\n2. Burn $1 worth of LUNA to mint 1 UST\\n3. Sell 1 UST for $1.10\\n4. Enjoy your instant 10% profit Money bag\\n\\n6/ Now suppose UST deviates from its peg, and is now worth $0.90\\n\\nUsing mechanism #2 above, you could profit from this arbitrage:\\n\\n1. Buy 1 UST for $0.90\\n2. Burn 1 UST - you will receive $1 worth of LUNA\\n3. Sell your LUNA for $1\\n4. Enjoy your instant 10% profit Money bag\\n\\n7/ So, this is how the Terra Luna ecosystem's [$UST](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24UST&src=cashtag_click) stablecoin relies on arbitragers and the [$LUNA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LUNA&src=cashtag_click) token to help maintain its peg. \\n  \\n [@WhiteWhaleTerra](https://twitter.com/WhiteWhaleTerra) is a newly launched protocol that aims to do this for you üêã \\n  \\n (since many don't want to spend time tracking stablecoin prices)\\n\\n8/ Currently, $UST has a market cap of about $8.8B.\\n\\nHere are market caps of other stablecoins (I love making infographics! üòÜ)\\n\\n1. $USDT: $ 77.2B\\n2. $USDC: $ 41.6B\\n3. $BUSD: $14.3B\\n4. $DAI: $ 8.8B\\n5. $MIM: $4.0B\\n\\nThe top 3 are centralized, and have a combined MC of > $133B.\\n\\n[$DAI](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DAI&src=cashtag_click) & [$MIM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MIM&src=cashtag_click) are decentralized stablecoins, but they have other flaws. \\n  \\n Read this amazing thread by [@CryptoHarry_](https://twitter.com/CryptoHarry_)'s to learn more\\n\\n10/ As [$UST](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24UST&src=cashtag_click) is minted, more [$LUNA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LUNA&src=cashtag_click) is burned. üî• \\n  \\n This makes [$LUNA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LUNA&src=cashtag_click)'s tokenomics very attractive for investors if the demand for [$UST](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24UST&src=cashtag_click) keeps growing. \\n  \\n Especially as Terra's [#DeFi](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeFi?src=hashtag_click) ecosystem keeps growing around the UST stablecoin. ü§ë \\n  \\n What happens if / when [$UST](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24UST&src=cashtag_click) catches up to [$USDT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24USDT&src=cashtag_click)?\\n\\n**11/** Here are some great things you can do today to get started in the Terra ecosystem üåñ\\n\\n* Buy synthetic stocks from anywhere in the world, 24/7/365 using @mirror_protocol\\n* Get 20% interest on $UST using @anchor_protocol\\n* Snipe cheap $ETH using @TeamKujira's Orca protocol üê≥\",\"timestamp\":1641197163,\"title\":\"a primer on the Terra ecosystem, how $LUNA and $UST work\"},\"digest\":\"remYg0KyA1ZoT4_jc59Fcn72Boxyrcxn0w4luT4mWXg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xb8a883325e4DA8A222e9e2d06A1762115B6Ba7b3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"XOKW4vMTp2-LiSgMEcBdHiZa6aEXNlQXYotJBC5Cmuk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"t9CmWsfYYQqAJGxDqYbY88CVIO_6lZk18w_wlLh6u60\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"eA1wYALkbZ1b8OB2rGCtuB4xTHLa7qFvu89ZaFfncOI5R7pwLfbQLtrT-6r0B03A5Pl8fz_HX8tI1gi0eQGN4g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x28fcf9fb8c702e9335c089e46bc47a0692ab7cea906d9b7c0003bc14a1f92dc341a8659d9094ace19e900a43b8973b7ed9b5a08c95ccdb9333592f0e8225388a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"XOKW4vMTp2-LiSgMEcBdHiZa6aEXNlQXYotJBC5Cmuk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"t9CmWsfYYQqAJGxDqYbY88CVIO_6lZk18w_wlLh6u60\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"remYg0KyA1ZoT4_jc59Fcn72Boxyrcxn0w4luT4mWXg\"}"
