"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Trading Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin and other digital currencies, more than 90% of domestic traders are withdrawing funds via OTC, and some of them had seen their bank cards frozen.\\n\\nBut recently not only bank cards, but also Alipay and WeChat have appeared to be frozen.\\n\\nEven if you didn't get your card frozen, you always heard others talking about it in the group, and I believe most of you are not surprised by it.\\n\\nBut really turn to their own day, the first time is estimated to be dumbfounded, many times frozen on the habit, there are unique anti-freeze thaw ideas, and in the end even some sour.\\n\\n**01 The earliest frozen cards**\\n\\nBitcoin China is the first domestic trading platform, founded in 2011. But at that time, the domestic bitcoin scale was too small, and had not yet attracted the attention of the black and gray industry, and had not heard of the frozen card situation.\\n\\nEven some of the players at the time were going to Taobao to buy bitcoins, or borrowed a way to mtg.\\n\\nThe earliest impression of China's domestic cryptocurrency circle frozen card should be in 2013, from less than 100 yuan at the beginning of the year to 8,000 yuan at the end of the year, nearly 100 times up to make this small circle boil up.\\n\\nUnder the barbaric growth, various chaos occurred frequently, gbl trading platform ran away, the police froze the funds involved, and some of the bank cards that come and go closely were also affected to varying degrees.\\n\\nAfter the five ministries issued a document on December 5, 2013, 2014 ok, bitcoin China, fire coin and other exchanges to cancel the direct top-up corporate account way, return to the original coin circle state, want to deposit need to top-up to the platform staff account, after being shorting traders intensive reporting these accounts are also gg.\\n\\nThat was the background of an era when the air force would fall as long as it was reported, even if it was a rumor.\\n\\n**02 Top-up codes appear**\\n\\nThe coin circle has been a cat and mouse game since then, until the emergence of the recharge code, which I remember was the first of its kind in the bit era.\\n\\nThe agent paid the deposit and could buy 100 in face value for 99 and then sell 100 to the platform users.\\n\\nThis recharge code sometimes because the market is good, traders in a hurry to enter the field will also have a premium situation, is not feeling a bit like usdt?\\n\\nThe first generation otc over-the-counter traders are the agents of these platforms, large platforms \\\"may\\\" or platform employees acting as agents, like bit times at that time are basically players as agents, can be said to be more hard box.\\n\\nA friend of mine is an agent, so I know a lot of odd users, rich legends, gamblers stories, he was also the first to be frozen card that group of people.\\n\\nTime has changed, and it's certainly not the same back then as it is now. The acceptance of bitcoin in society is also increasing. In the past, basically no one knew about bitcoin, but now at least the economic police basically know about bitcoin, and even speculate on it.\\n\\n**03 Personal Experience**\\n\\nMy first card freeze was when I used Alipay to tie up my card to pay and couldn't pay, logged into online banking and could see the balance but it wasn't available.\\n\\nThe first detour: contacting the bank by phone, the reply was that I had to go to an offline bank branch to inquire, wasting half an hour.\\n\\nThe second detour: go to the offline bank branch query results are: judicial freeze. The teller looked at me strangely, I explained to him: maybe I sold the bitcoin, the person who gave me the money had a problem with the funds, and then explained what is bitcoin, what is digital currency, what is Satoshi Nakamoto and blockchain, from Jim Byington to Hayek.\\n\\nUntil the teller lady advised me to stay away from the pyramid scheme. Sun Yuchen said he couldn't forget the kind of look that Wang Xiaochuan gave him when he interviewed him. I understand Sun Yuchen very well, and at that time in the bank I also had this embarrassing feeling. The difference is that I felt: the teller lady thought bitcoin was a pyramid scheme, and I was the victim.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do when you encounter a freeze is: check the reason for the freeze and which area the freezing party is the police, if you have the contact information just ask, don't talk to the teller more than bb. it's the money party that has the mistake of freezing this thing, you are the victim and don't need to explain to others.\\n\\nCurrently buying and selling bitcoin is not illegal at the legal level, actively contact the police, most developed areas are still easy to thaw, generally less funds involved in the number of people is automatically thawed after 3 days.\\n\\nIf you receive money involved in sensitive issues, the amount of money involved is relatively large, the flow of funds close to the first black money, etc., then it is generally six months, six months after the freeze.\\n\\nSome group of friends were frozen for six months after going to the bank every day to try to withdraw cash, and finally have it back, indicating that it may not be completely automatic renewal of the freeze, may not be the case in some areas.\\n\\nBlack money is commonly telecommunication fraud, theoretically able to close the case will be unfrozen.\\n\\nIf terrorism, drugs, gambling, bribery and other sensitive issues are more difficult, at most now there are more than two years did not unfreeze. Telecom fraudsters will transfer money after cheating, the funds will be from the victim a to b to c to d so, the closer you are to the first hand a the more difficult it is to unfreeze.\\n\\n**Contact the police, the following are common**\\n\\n1, let you pass information similar to handheld and statements, etc., most of a month or so to thaw.\\n\\n2, let you to the off-site with the investigation, remote areas in pursuit of solving the progress of the case, it is possible to shut you down for a period of time.\\n\\n3, take the initiative to find you, this is still good, but generally need to close the case after the thaw.\\n\\n4, let you wait for the case to be solved.\\n\\n5, told you xx days after the automatic thawing.\\n\\nWant to thaw in advance of the general need to repay the funds of the victims of telecommunications, personally do not recommend, after all, the legal level you are not at fault. Here there is also a capital turnover using the situation, but also depends on the actual situation of each person to make a judgment.\\n\\nSpinach sites, external platforms, pornographic sites, telecom fraud, hacking stolen funds, pyramid scheme funds, sensitive funds involving terrorism.\\n\\nLet's put it this way, the black money situation in the coin world is getting more and more intense.\\n\\nYou are charging money to speculate on coins, and they are using you to launder money.\\n\\n**04 Anti-freeze ideas**\\n\\nJust out of the gold generally will not immediately freeze the card, it often takes days and weeks or even months after you find the card frozen, the card involved in the cryptocurrency business dedicated to the card.\\n\\nTherefore, the withdrawal card should not be made into a common life card, salary card, stock card and so on.\\n\\nIn addition: before withdrawing the money from the card involving the coin circle, try to top up 1 yuan to Alipay to see if it is frozen before withdrawing the money.\\n\\nThere are really a lot of unlucky people who transfer money to frozen cards without knowing that the cards have been frozen.\\n\\n**The basic steps to prevent freezing**\\n\\n1, out of the gold withdrawals as soon as possible after the transfer to other bank cards, stock accounts, financial accounts.\\n\\n(Generally transfer to local banks will be safe. For example, Jinzhou Bank, Tieling Bank, which only has local. The police need to go to the local bank to freeze the amount of money you have withdrawn is not as expensive as an airline ticket, so you won't have to run to freeze your money).\\n\\n2, out of the gold withdrawals as far as possible to go to the bank to withdraw cash before transferring to other security cards. If the physical condition allows, you can take after a change of bank deposit, pay attention not to be robbed.\\n\\n3, out of the gold withdrawals finished, go to the bank to withdraw the money after the transfer to the parents wife husband's card.\\n\\n4, choose a platform such as Blue Shield certified merchants. Telecom fraudsters buy usdt at a high price, generally new and have not traded much.\\n\\nHowever, Blue Shield does not prevent blocked cards, because fraudsters prefer Blue Shield, the transaction amount is larger and more convenient, so it can only say that you may be a little farther away from the flow of funds from fraudsters, you receive will not be the first hand second hand black money.\\n\\n5, the ultimate anti-freeze: almost 100% not to be frozen card, compliance with the law is king, do not lose a small amount of gold to prevent encountering black money freezing program\\n\\n1, the usual consumption with credit cards, money to the account also credit card.\\n\\n2, first borrow financial tools such as borrowing to normal cards, and then use the money from the coin ring to pay back the borrowing.\\n\\n3, you can also use Alipay password red envelope, send password red envelope to loved ones account, remember the password design is a little more complicated.\\n\\n4, let the wife / husband apply for Taobao store, you go to shoot goods, you can send empty package express.\\n\\nNote: Compliance with the law is the way to go, do not lose a lot because of the small. By definition, all the ways to make money from blackmail have been written into the criminal law, please do not try.\",\"timestamp\":1640590385,\"title\":\"A complete guide to freeze and unfreeze bank cards \"},\"digest\":\"Oto1Ig22XnZssCvNySlu91cgZwVPHk3N7Evz0IJm2UY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x896002E29FE4CDa28A3ae139b0bf7bAc26B33a8C\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"51k-rBqF1XbquHKijIFxIhBXSJX0OrvZ1e6Rb75v5HE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3CIVp7QdPBVVLXg6DZ42FXFKt5Gw7Semtx4ujcFUR4c\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"d7K0RS5ci96Bvi2THX1jmYJQzC-uhIbznURmpCXv1Rv_H2BPlEcvjc4DdOMciLNzA21jhCQ_M_IA_3mFLJVtjw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe583a292246efdc6b1dca54726769b3c6d532f1e1b1f42d88f2001c0928803d32e2ec2b63732b1d9fd43694c5e76306097937f2869193dae9c884afbb32ef59f1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"51k-rBqF1XbquHKijIFxIhBXSJX0OrvZ1e6Rb75v5HE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3CIVp7QdPBVVLXg6DZ42FXFKt5Gw7Semtx4ujcFUR4c\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Oto1Ig22XnZssCvNySlu91cgZwVPHk3N7Evz0IJm2UY\"}"
