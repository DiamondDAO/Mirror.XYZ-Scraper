"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"Not so deceitful as men,\\\" said Fanny, sharply.\\n\\nBut Zoe clung to her straw. \\\"Might not two things happen together? He is subject to bleeding at the nose. It is strange it should occur twice so, but it is possible\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Zoe,\\\" said Fanny, gravely, \\\"he is not subject to bleeding at the nose.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, *then*--but how can you know that? What right have you to say that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll show you,\\\" said Fanny, and left the room.\\n\\nShe soon came back, holding something behind her back. Even at the last moment she was half unwilling. However, she looked down, and said, in a very peculiar tone, \\\"Here is the handkerchief he put before his face at the opera; there!\\\" and she threw it into Zoe's lap.\\n\\nZoe's nature revolted against evidence so obtained. She did not even take up the handkerchief. \\\"What!\\\" she cried; \\\"you took it out of his pocket?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then you have been in his room and got it.\\\"\\n\\n*\\\"Nothing of the kind!* I sent Rosa.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My maid!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mine, for that job. I gave her half a crown to borrow it for a pattern.\\\"\\n\\nZoe seized the handkerchief and ran her eye over it in a moment. There was no trace of blood on it, and there were his initials, \\\"E. S.,\\\" in the corner. Her woman's eye fastened instantly on these. \\\"Silk?\\\" said she, and held it up to the light. \\\"No. Hair!--golden hair. It is *hers!\\\"* And she flung the handkerchief from her as if it were a viper, and even when on the ground eyed it with dilating orbs and a hostile horror.\\n\\n\\\"La!\\\" said Fanny; \\\"fancy that! You are not blind now. You have seen more than I. I made sure it was yellow silk.\\\"\\n\\nBut this frivolous speech never even entered Zoe's ear. She was too deeply shocked. She went, feebly, and sat down in a chair, and covered her face with her hands.\\n\\nFanny eyed her with pity. \\\"There!\\\" said she, almost crying, \\\"I never tell the truth but I bitterly repent it.\\\"\\n\\nZoe took no notice of this droll apothegm. Her hands began to work. \\\"What shall I do!\\\" she said. \\\"What shall I do!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, don't go on like that, Zoe!\\\" cried Fanny. \\\"After all, it is you he prefers. He ran away from her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, yes. But why?--why? What has he done?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Jilted her. I suppose. Aunt Maitland thinks he is after money; and, you know, you have got money.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have I nothing else?\\\" said the proud beauty, and lifted her bowed head for a moment.\\n\\n\\\"You have everything. But you should look things in the face. Is that singer an unattractive woman?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no. But she is not poor. Her kind of talent is paid enormously.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is true,\\\" said Fanny. \\\"But perhaps she wastes it. She is a gambler, like himself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let him go to her,\\\" said Zoe, wildly; \\\"I will share no man's heart.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He will never go to her, unless--well, unless we tell him that she has broken the bank with his money.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you think so badly of him, tell him, then, and let him go. Oh, I am wretched--I am wretched!\\\" She lifted her hands in despair, and began to cry and sob bitterly.\\n\\nFanny was melted at her distress, and knelt to her, and cried with her.\\n\\nNot being a girl of steady principle, she went round with the wind. \\\"Dear Zoe,\\\" said she, \\\"it is deeper than I thought. La! if you love him, why torment yourself?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said Zoe; \\\"it is deceit and mystery that torment me. Oh, what shall I do! what shall I do!\\\"\\n\\nFanny interpreted this vague exclamation of sorrow as asking advice, and said, \\\"I dare not advise you; I can only tell you what I should do in your place. I should make up my mind at once whether I loved the man, or only liked him. If I only liked him, I would turn him up at once.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Turn him up! What is that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Turn him off, then. If I loved him, I would not let any other woman have the least little bit of a chance to get him. For instance, I would not let him know this old sweetheart of his has won three thousand pounds at least, for I noted her winnings. Diamond cut diamond, my dear. He is concealing from you something or other about him and this Klosking; hide you this one little thing about the Klosking from him, till you get my gentleman safe to England.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And this is love! I call it warfare.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And love is warfare, three times out of four. Anyway, it is for you to decide, Zoe. I do wish you had never seen the man. He is not what he seems. He is a poor adventurer, and a bundle of deceit.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are very hard on him. You don't know all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, nor a quarter; and you know less. There, dear, dry your eyes and fight against it. After all, you know you are mistress of the situation. I'll settle it for you, which way you like.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You will? Oh, Fanny, you are very good!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Say indulgent, please. I'm not good, and never will be, if *I can possibly help.* I despise good people; they are as weak as water. But I do like you, Zoe Vizard, better than any other woman in the world. That is not saying very much; my taste is for men. I think them gods and devils compared with us; and I do admire gods and devils. No matter, dear. Kiss me, and say, 'Fanny, act for me,' and I'll do it.\\\"\\n\\nZoe kissed her, and then, by a truly virginal impulse, hid her burning face in her hands, and said nothing at all.\\n\\nFanny gave her plenty of time, and then said, kindly, \\\"Well, dear?\\\"\\n\\nThen Zoe murmured, scarce audibly, \\\"Act--*as if*--I loved him.\\\"\\n\\nAnd still she kept her face covered with her hands. Fanny was anything but surprised at this conclusion of the struggle. She said, with a certain alacrity, \\\"Very well, I will: so now bathe your eyes and come in to supper.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, no; please go and make an excuse for me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I shall do nothing of the kind. I won't be told by-and-by I have done wrong. I will do your business, but it shall be in your hearing. Then you can interfere, if you choose. Only you had better not put your word in till you see what I am driving at.\\\"\\n\\nWith a little more encouragement, Zoe was prevailed on to sponge her tearful eyes and compose herself, and join Harrington at supper.\\n\\nMiss Maitland soon retired, pleading fatigue and packing; and she had not been gone long, when Fanny gave her friend a glance and began upon Harrington.\\n\\n\\\"You are very fond of Mr. Severne, are you not?\\\" said she.\\n\\n\\\"I am,\\\" said Vizard, stoutly, preparing for battle. \\\"You are not, perhaps.\\\"\\n\\nFanny laughed at this prompt pugnacity. \\\"Oh, yes, I am,\\\" said she; \\\"devoted. But he has a weakness, you must own. He is rather fond of gambling.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is, I am sorry to say. It is his one fault. Most of us have two or three.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't you think it would be a pity if he were to refuse to go with us tomorrow--were to prefer to stay here and gamble?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No fear of that: he has given me his word of honor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Still, I think it would be hardly safe to tempt him. If you go and tell him that friend of his won such a lot of money, he will want to stop; and if he does not stop, he will go away miserable. You know they began betting with his money, though they went on with their own.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, did they? What was his own money?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How much was it, Zoe?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Fifty pounds.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Vizard, \\\"you must admit it is hard he should lose his own money. And yet I own I am most anxious to get him away from this place. Indeed, I have a project; I want him to rusticate a few months at our place, while I set my lawyer to look into his affairs and see if his estate cannot be cleared. I'll be bound the farms are underlet. What does the Admirable Crichton know about such trifles?\\\"\\n\\nFanny looked at Zoe, whose color was rising high at all this. \\\"Well!\\\" said she, \\\"when you gentlemen fall in love *with each other,* you certainly are faithful creatures.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because we can count on fidelity in return,\\\" said Vizard. He thought a little, and said, \\\"Well, as to the other thing--you leave it to me. Let us understand one another. Nothing we saw at the gambling-table is to be mentioned by us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Crichton is to be taken to England for his good.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And I am to be grateful to you for your co-operation in this.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You can, if you like.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you will secure an agreeable companion for the rest of the tour, eh?--my diplomatic cousin and my silent sister.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes; but it is too bad of you to see through a poor girl, and her little game, like that. I own he is a charming companion.\\\"\\n\\nFanny's cunning eyes twinkled, and Zoe blushed crimson to see her noble brother manipulated by this artful minx and then flattered for his perspicacity.\\n\\nFrom that moment a revulsion took place in her mind, and pride fought furiously with love--for a time.\\n\\nThis was soon made apparent to Fanny Dover. When they retired, Zoe looked very gloomy; so Fanny asked, rather sharply, \\\"Well, what is the matter now? Didn't I do it cleverly?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, yes, too cleverly. Oh, Fanny, I begin to revolt against myself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This is nice!\\\" said Fanny. \\\"Go on, dear. It is just what I ought to have expected. You were there. You had only to interfere. You didn't. And now you are discontented.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not with you. Spare me. You are not to blame, and I am very unhappy. I am losing my self-respect. Oh, if this goes on, I shall hate him!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, dear--for five minutes, and then love him double. Come, don't deceive yourself, and don't torment yourself. All your trouble, we shall leave it behind us to-morrow, and every hour will take us further from it.\\\"\\n\\nWith this practical view of matters, she kissed Zoe and hurried to bed.\\n\\nBut Zoe scarcely closed her eyes all night.\\n\\nSeverne did not reach the hotel till past eleven o'clock, and went straight to his own room.\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\nASHMEAD accompanied Mademoiselle Klosking to her apartment. It was lighted, and the cloth laid for supper under the chandelier, a snow-white Hamburg damask. Ashmead took the winnings out of his pocket, and proudly piled the gold and crumpled notes in one prodigious mass upon the linen, that shone like satin, and made the gold look doubly inviting. Then he drew back and gloated on it. The Klosking, too, stood and eyed the pile of wealth with amazement and a certain reverence. \\\"Let me count it,\\\" said Ashmead. He did so, and it came to four thousand nine hundred and eighty-one pounds, English money. \\\"And to think,\\\" said he, \\\"if you had taken my advice you would not have a penny of this!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll take your advice now,\\\" said she. \\\"I will never gamble again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, take my advice, and lock up the swag before a creature sees it. Homburg is full of thieves.\\\"\\n\\nShe complied, and took away the money in a napkin.\\n\\nAshmead called after her to know might he order supper.\\n\\n\\\"If you will be so kind.\\\"\\n\\nAshmead rejoiced at this unguarded permission, and ordered a supper that made Karl stare.\\n\\nThe Klosking returned in about half an hour, clad in a crisp *peignoir.*\",\"timestamp\":1637668893,\"title\":\" Zoe clasped her hands piteously.
