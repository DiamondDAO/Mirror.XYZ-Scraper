"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**1982 - 1998 - 2008 - 2018**\\n\\nThe financial markets were alive after a grinding decade - the 70s\\n\\n**People were looking for love in material places**, feeling it in dayglo, pastel, and monogrammed fashion. **Logos were love-bites for egos**. They charged their way up to a summit of self-actualization -credit!\\n\\nAll that **plastic lust flowed through centralized networks**. \\n\\n**Credit, umbilical cords to banks, tied down addicted millions to debt.**\\n\\nBut **something was coming - a connectivity - a network.**\\n\\nSome saw it and wanted to ride that connectivity to a new reality.\\n\\nDavid Chaum wrote \\\"Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups\\\". The year before, in 1981, he wrote \\\"Untraceable Electronic Mail, Return Addresses, and Digital Pseudonyms\\\". Too early.\\n\\nA scene gathered, the \\\"Cypherpunks\\\", with just a few hundred members. The government, \\\"Ma Bell\\\", and the NSA were the worry. Most people didn't worry about privacy, anonymity, and security - yet. Still early.\\n\\nChaum started DigiCash to create 'eCash' - electronic money, backed by cash, on a network connected to a bank. Sadly, Plastic lust and paypal won. \\\"DigiCash\\\" was small and centralized, the worst of both worlds, and went bankrupt - 'eCash' died.\\n\\nThere was b-Money and bitgold but they could be hacked by cheap bots. There was \\\"e-Gold\\\", backed by gold, it got big but the Feds crushed it in 2008 - the cypherpunks' worst fears confirmed.\\n\\nThe big banks and government had an iron grip on networks and money. They kept everyone hooked on endless plastic lust.\\n\\n**A super shadowy romantic wrote a love letter about private electronic money on a network without banks or the government.**\\n\\n**It was electronic love at first sight.**\\n\\n**2877 Earth, The Necklace, Mars Consulate**\\n\\n\\\"ROOM, when you're done running simulations, model for data that grey market co-ops around Earth don’t have but would want. I am using a sample as leverage in a negotiation. I have no intention of surrendering the data. Connect to local 'oracles' to check against what's not available on Earth's chains.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Understood, Commander.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Remember, keep this room sealed. No one enters, not even the Ambassador herself can enter. I'm going to meet with that visitor waiting, who might be from a shadow co-op. Track the visitor through the consulate's systems.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Understood, Commander.\\\"\\n\\nI didn't tell the secure room's “intelligent entity” that the \\\"data bait\\\" it was making was for a hostage, a member of the consulate's trade delegation. I didn't bother sharing that I was helping a local police inspector arrest grey-marketeers either. There would be time afterwords for apologies to the Ambassador.\\n\\nI went down the elevator to meet with a \\\"representative\\\" from the co-op. Yesterday, she and I were trying to kill each other in a restaurant. I walked to the consulate’s lounge. She was having tea.\\n\\n\\\"This tea is excellent.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes it is.\\\" She had one arm in a sling. She saw I noticed, and she shrugged. \\\"All part of the job, I know it's not personal.”\\n\\n\\\"Where is it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where is she?”\\n\\n\\\"We don't trust each other, we each has what the other wants.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I want to see her, in exchange, I give proof. Then we trade.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have until midnight tomorrow.” She said, and then left.\\n\\nThe Inspector and I had less than a day to get ready.\\n\\n[https://audius.co/ShiivaRaw/plastic-love-feat.-gura-169208](https://audius.co/ShiivaRaw/plastic-love-feat.-gura-169208)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zVWjJk_L4SekzabSwvmF-.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RmE8lTQgB6unKhXKQD0vo.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1635999858,\"title\":\"1999 7.26 Plastic Credit Lust, Electronic Money Love\"},\"digest\":\"Z77BwBsSWYN8SPik2j3WL4qQn2KaCNrdTWGGhB26RZ8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cp69EkVmGPN56udTPoj_01QpW6eGaXZ1zbeS531jad8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zYwhIf2jaKC_Er3nNncHMRuE7eXBXlkdLz-3zM8ikGE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Ws1RB3Me1R6H1sDlvg4SUlI9YX0K0mxThUB3meLZ3qHREpS-BIkqgpiNOJYGPVFvxkWeo9c7NwZPGd9WHtYMbQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe4c1bcaa88b6fe2c67d195f4a76d1a91640647a2c63ec8f8083673f941e8ee412d804077222237104c51130677298bdcb163cbc3b2eb0bb6193f6b825a8e06141c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cp69EkVmGPN56udTPoj_01QpW6eGaXZ1zbeS531jad8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zYwhIf2jaKC_Er3nNncHMRuE7eXBXlkdLz-3zM8ikGE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Z77BwBsSWYN8SPik2j3WL4qQn2KaCNrdTWGGhB26RZ8\"}"
