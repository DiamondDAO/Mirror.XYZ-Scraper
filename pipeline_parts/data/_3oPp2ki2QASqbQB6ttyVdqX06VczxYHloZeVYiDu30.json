"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I’ve wrestled with the idea of jobs for a while. I want to spend energy on the things I’m best at, but some of those things feel undervalued. This piece is an introduction, a question, and a coagulation of big feelings that have sat with me for a loooong time.\\n\\nWatch ‘er:\\n\\n[https://youtu.be/a7MiAVMkDyk](https://youtu.be/a7MiAVMkDyk)\\n\\n### Various NFT’s will be available as an extension of this piece - starting with:\\n\\n[ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/5799](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/5799)\\n\\n### I NEED A JOB is my first NFT.\\n\\nI started creating it in 2015 and finished in 2021.\\n\\nIt’s tried on a lot of different outfits from then to now but I think it’s finally found colors that suit it. I’m happy to feel this idea captured in a tangible way.\\n\\n**Is this one of my jobs?**\\n\\nI have/had many jobs. I think I’ll always have many “jobs” at once according to various interests, abilities, and context.\\n\\nCreating is a job I take very seriously - despite rarely getting paid for it.  However, the process of becoming a paid artist in the music platform/social media era has always felt a bit unnatural to me.\\n\\nI shared some thoughts with my friends/collaborators in the [songcamp](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/) community that I think are relevant here:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ppuNlAxPV5vVclNxWohbg.png?height=1314&width=1354)\\n\\n**To those of you who belong to the communities I frequent, or the web3 creative community as a whole:**\\n\\nI NEED A JOB ties together feelings that have been in me and (I think) a lot of us as we begin to accept a reality where finding work that aligns with our personal strengths/passions may be the most logical, most valuable, and best compensated action one could take. Keep accepting. Keep aligning.\",\"timestamp\":1635396488,\"title\":\"I NEED A JOB (auction)\",\"publication\":\"willjuergens\"},\"digest\":\"u0LTo2CV3w88Dhjck7RqVnWa4_m0wbB-oc8wy0oy4uw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD4786cDa66e176173568Ce26343135543A3F04cB\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"v-_ht87xRmkwiTGZi-M7g5nIfn7vsTU44gto_mCRaWM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mC1fN2A3cytNJzVqEun_1rLhEZL4V_jOO2JvueGx49g\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"2Cz6fXuWIQrRpwL5n8eF4Ec-2F8c6nb8XzoYm56OvLVV4_3AjU00C-Uxp4cF7jizoo7bwXGfwW6tSfBqIEztFA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x6993da8e2f231f82d715858a009680b3b03764fbe68711f7e09b95595be4e5e27cae3201c0e93b3efa20bff9bd9ed6bfce3589d50fd36b425731ed64f0779cd71b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"v-_ht87xRmkwiTGZi-M7g5nIfn7vsTU44gto_mCRaWM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mC1fN2A3cytNJzVqEun_1rLhEZL4V_jOO2JvueGx49g\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Iop1K9RENJB7aBpHh_GecojhTLllnP8sAC2DEv-hrEk\"}"
