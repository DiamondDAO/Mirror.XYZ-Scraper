"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*For context: I originally wrote this in July 2020 on [my website](https://moninger.org/), a few months into COVID.*\\n\\n**Flow:** The state of being fully immersed in your current activity for its own sake, often resulting in deep focus and enjoyment.\\n\\nI thought *[Flow](https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202)* was gospel when I read it for the first time early last year. It brought vocabulary and explanation to something I often felt but didn't have a name for. And there are some really important lessons in it:\\n\\n* Distraction makes it difficult to reach maximum output.\\n* Focus can actually be quite energizing. (Counterintuitive at first)\\n* Happiness is cultivated, rather than something that happens to you.\\n\\nThe book also has a lot to say about viscerally noticing your present experience and witnessing it fully. But I have some second thoughts, although I still really like the book. The subtitle *The Psychology of Optimal Experience* has some interesting unintended consequences if flow is what you try to optimize your life around to no end.\\n\\nI have had the fortune to have been able to focus on myself for the last few months during quarantine. That is a privilege that is not lost on me. I have been, on average, in pretty good spirits and had a good routine going. I feel generally fulfilled, and have had plenty of time for sleep and exercise, among other things.\\n\\nSomething I have been thinking about recently is how quickly time is flying. I never know whether this is a signal of how my life is going because I have found it happens during both good times and bad times.\\n\\nRhythm and routine can be good: wake up → meditate → go on a walk → exercise → work → eat a healthy dinner with family → read a book → go to bed on time.\\n\\nBut rhythm and routine can also be bad: snooze → snooze again → eat food that makes me feel bad → be distracted at work → go to bed late.\\n\\nI think forward to the few more months I'm going to be spending at home and think *that's not so bad* because the previous three went by so quickly. Why is that? I think it's because I have made relatively few memories in the last 3 months. I have been using [1 Second Everyday](https://1se.co/) since mid-March. I try to record the most memorable moment of each day. These days, most of them are Zoom calls——and that's a bummer.\\n\\nFlow is all the rage in startup land for trying to reach peak productivity. I was first introduced to the idea that flow might not be all it is cracked up to be by Courtland Allen on the [Indie Hackers podcast](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast). In one of the episodes (I can't recall which one) he talks about his experience working on his previous startup and how he spent 2 years coding for 16 hours a day. And at the time, it felt productive and rewarding. But he didn't remember anything from that time in his life and made very few memories.\\n\\nThat freaks me out. If that is the difference between me starting a wildly vs. mildly successful business, then so be it. But that may be a false dilemma.\\n\\nFounders who are engineers will often go into a room, build for weeks and months, and when they come out they are shocked that they haven't built something that people want. It is seductive. It is seductive to stick to your strengths and to stick with what easily induces a flow state.\\n\\nI'm going to avoid that.\\n\\n*If you want to get an email when I write something new, [drop your email here](https://gmail.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=9dae67adf8fd64424c43c9405&amp;id=76061e899d).*\",\"timestamp\":1634417855,\"title\":\"Flow is Seductive\"},\"digest\":\"bmnCu4FVfIvaW8oBcUOiYQ-cutXhtb68sAa1iqnz4qQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD8711e8BdeCe3e95baAdbDBf7a21a73ba3471b7f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"9Hk3bsKg50pCnYiYoVmXkElF9IJ10mVDUcRce42BJAE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wWyH0rIcZwGgl_ZG9uuF2uUmC4IyExe3PUOzhW-O5h4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Vk4jjPBKuYGeDrWVemztF3SgnNVDhrT2xjsf3X2KlQ8xfOUkhWpWI-fVtd-7s-hZ0OKDhBCRQX9avTR0t2i_0Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf0761a592c1940e691ac9b160228129f4eccca47ff4b2a2d77b4ff5f492b42c90b575f11768ca94b6916c6a57da88f982e60b8cf65abfad61d59b70008fbdc9201\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"9Hk3bsKg50pCnYiYoVmXkElF9IJ10mVDUcRce42BJAE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wWyH0rIcZwGgl_ZG9uuF2uUmC4IyExe3PUOzhW-O5h4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"pCKmvO-yN-p8sD2xuHGpoHeHnA881cbRuFVrsQ-j464\"}"
