"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*DeFi refers to decentralized finance, which covers the overarching concept of eliminating financial intermediaries and provides value in the provision of more extensive use cases for blockchain technology.*\\n\\nDeFi is the short form of “decentralized finance,” an overarching term for the variety of products and simplified services that disrupt the financial industry by removing all intermediaries. The blockchain inspires the concept to ensure that all transactions are held in a copy of the distributed ledger, guaranteeing that there is no single source in control of the information. \\n\\nPerhaps the key reason for the rapid growth in the [DeFi](https://cointelegraph.com/defi-101/defi-a-comprehensive-guide-to-decentralized-finance) concept is its use for payment transfers to extend to more complex scenarios. Some of the most known use cases include stablecoins, open lending platforms, yield farming, staking and decentralized exchanges. For users, these applications allow for higher interest rates than are offered in traditional banks and fewer barriers requirements for taking out a loan.\\n\\n2\\\\.\\n\\n## How can users get started in the DeFi world?\\n\\n*Accessing decentralized finance products and services starts with a gateway, more commonly known as a DeFi wallet.*\\n\\nTo help users get access to some of these features, DeFi wallets become key. While traditionally, these wallets were complex to use and slow to operate, they are now becoming more streamlined and easier for new users to navigate than ever before. As the core to DeFi, wallets allow users to access new financial products as a cryptocurrency gateway to Web 3.0, thereby providing freedom, transparency and ownership of a user’s assets.\",\"timestamp\":1639039284,\"title\":\"ow to choose a secure DeFi wallet, explained\"},\"digest\":\"HeYCOnOQEOBLlQ9K2ZKqy4riwJ9KemTgyrNXJWbgQHk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xB99b08bAb55E09F912D4BF4684144c43436017A1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"D8hdFrEG1eWutNEF3k5vwtJD_cc-BHm62KW6Hngk3SI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0ZObB7eq7KsNlEu5waafBEtbbiZpNeCoQeyct6aZd8U\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"vg0ub1LwfoWRpVJnBtNwRQlFW8z4d0DUG_xzXkiiMUvLBH2debOGPTASgHASFysflHWDkX66SC439355e8QEuQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x21ea367c2f97c857cd4219da7ab8679f38b998b3d6a21f90e6ddc56443ce0b1d42d2f50f959fd184c079354b95c4dd48e2d799606061a9020182ab493371e11d1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"D8hdFrEG1eWutNEF3k5vwtJD_cc-BHm62KW6Hngk3SI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0ZObB7eq7KsNlEu5waafBEtbbiZpNeCoQeyct6aZd8U\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"HeYCOnOQEOBLlQ9K2ZKqy4riwJ9KemTgyrNXJWbgQHk\"}"
