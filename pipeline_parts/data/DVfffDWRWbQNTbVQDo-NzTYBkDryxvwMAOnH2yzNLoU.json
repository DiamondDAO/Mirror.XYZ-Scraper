"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"首先如果真的不断深耕下去，你一定是能够发现一些机会的。因为专业度和对市场的洞察是需要时间积累的。\\n\\n### 先说说积累的问题\\n\\n积累需要学习能力，这个自然不必多说。对新鲜事物的敏感度，不说洞察，至少你要能够敞开去接受新事物，而不是一来就用陈旧的观点去批判，就像今年是私域的爆发年吧，围绕私域的各个节点的产品和服务层出不穷。毋庸置疑的说，私域一定会是未来企业经营的基础设施。因为现在企业经营的外部大环境已经发生了根本改变，存量时代的必然选择。愿意拥抱变化的人可能会成为踩坑的人，但也同事是首先吃螃蟹的人。但很多老板没有敏锐的捕捉到外部环境的变化，导致他们会认为被私域相关的服务所教育，是一件不太情愿被接受的事情。他不想被割韭菜。事物永远都是有双面性的，固守一定程度上会等于安全，但也同时会导致跟不上。\\n\\n所以在你说在的行业深耕后，你也恰巧是一个愿意接受新玩法，愿意去付出一定成本尝试后，你一定可以积累到丰富的实战经验。同事深耕也会让你成为这个领域的专家，能够更好的去洞察整个行业的现状。\\n\\n### 下面就说说洞察\\n\\n我觉得深耕之后，洞察会或多或少随之而来产生，我们不谈如何培养商业洞察力，就从最基本的商业规则出发，你也可以获得一些洞察。\\n\\n你说在的行业，有哪些产品，是哪些人群需要这些产品。他们有什么痛点？这些产品能解决哪些痛点，还有哪些问题存在没有被解决，或者用户希望获得更好的体验。等等，这些当中我能否找到我自己可以介入，去解决的点。\\n\\n目前整个行业产业链上，大家的玩法是怎么样的，最牛逼的公司他们是怎么玩的。其它大公司是如何玩的。\\n\\n最后回到自身，从你在这个行业的积累来看，你目前拥有的资源禀赋，可以在这个行业当中如何做，是有机会往上冲，抢占更多市场份额，还是可以从细分需求和领域出发单独做产品线。还是干脆就跳出现在的产品和公司框架，跳出来解决整个行业的某些问题。\\n\\n就拿我们公司举例，我们做私域营销的服务公司，在今年年初服务一个财务公司的过程中，在帮助财务公司解决他们如何更好的服务他们的客户的过程中，就发现他们的客户大部分都是物流运输企业，而这些企业在和我们的客户合作过程中，阻力重重，原因就在于，这些企业内部没有财务规范的制度，导致账务混乱，那就必然我们的客户服务他们过程中，就要付出巨大的人力成本。于是客户和我们商讨如何解决，处于对营销数字化的敏感度，我们意识到，对于物流运输企业，他们很大一个问题就是缺乏标准化。如果有标准化的流程和制度，那么也不会存在太多问题，那怎么解决标准化的问题。答案就是数字化，但我们一个私域营销服务公司，也没有太多数字化的经验，只能说在营销数字化上，我们有软件开发的能力。能够开发数字化的工具。但这也不太好弄，毕竟我们对物流运输行业不熟悉。但毕竟我们要帮助客户去解决他们的问题，我们必须要上。\\n\\n于是问题聚焦在物流企业数字化上，我们要找解决方案，最后通过我们多年在营销数字化上的一些认知和敏感度，我们最后选择了使用基于钉钉的低代码服务平台，宜搭去帮助客户定制话搭建他们的业务和财务管理应用。\\n\\n你可能会问，为什么我们能做？1、因为我们服务的财务的客户，我们签的是年度合同，我们已经长期在了解他们的客户，以及其中的问题，慢慢对物流运输已经有了很深的理解，包括他们的业务流程，问题点，都比较清楚。\\n\\n2、其次就是因为低代码平台宜搭，他的构架就已经帮我们解决了大部分，以往软件开发的问题，我们只需要深度理解业务，已经流程，以及物流企业想要解决的问题，他们的诉求。我们就能根据这些，用逻辑和流程，以及简单的拖拉就能够搭建出这套管理系统。前提其实也是在于我们深度的理解了他们的，痛点，业务流程和难点。\\n\\n所以最终物流企业的客户是单独和我们签了，开发的合同去做好了这件事。起初我们是拒绝的。但正因为此，我们发现对于很多中小企业来说，内部管理流程是一个很大的需求和痛点。但是目前市场上已有的成熟产品，比如一些管理软件，或者saas系统，是无法满足他们个性化定制，同时价格要能接受的需求。我们发现了这个市场机会，但目前我们没有选择投入到这块，我们也不太清楚，这些需求有多大，或者能产生多大的收益，目前还是观望。这几天通过朋友的介绍，一家做医药连锁的企业，也找到我们有内部管理应用的需求，我们已经在做。之前我们也不敢想，这件事情竟然也能够让我们赚到钱了。\\n\\n可能这就是自然的在私域营销这个赛道上，我们在不断积累，同事对企业内部管理数字化，也保持了足够的开放，和学习。这也许就是一个好的业务方向。\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nFirst of all, if you really continue to plough deeply, you must be able to find some opportunities. Because professionalism and insight into the market take time to accumulate.\\nLet's talk about accumulation first\\nAccumulation requires learning ability, which is needless to say. Sensitivity to new things, not to mention insight, at least you should be able to open up to accept new things, rather than criticize with old views. For example, this year is the outbreak year of the private domain, and products and services around various nodes of the private domain emerge one after another. There is no doubt that the private domain will be the infrastructure for enterprise operation in the future. Because now the external environment of enterprise operation has fundamentally changed, which is the inevitable choice of the stock era. People who are willing to embrace change may become people who step on the pit, but colleagues are the first to eat crabs. However, many bosses are not keen to capture the changes of the external environment, which leads them to think that being educated by private domain related services is a reluctant thing to be accepted. He doesn't want to be cut. Things always have two sides. Sticking to them to a certain extent will be equal to safety, but it will also lead to failure to keep up.\\nTherefore, after you say that you are deeply engaged in the industry, you also happen to be a person who is willing to accept new playing methods and pay a certain cost. After trying, you can certainly accumulate rich practical experience. Colleagues' deep cultivation will also make you an expert in this field and can better insight into the current situation of the whole industry.\\nLet's talk about insight\\nI think after deep cultivation, insight will come more or less. We don't talk about how to cultivate business insight. You can also get some insight from the most basic business rules.\\nWhat products are there in your industry and who needs these products. What pain points do they have? What pain points can these products solve, what problems have not been solved, or users want a better experience. Wait, can I find the point I can intervene and solve.\\nAt present, how do you play in the whole industry chain, and how do they play in the most powerful companies. How other big companies play.\\nFinally, back to yourself, from your accumulation in this industry, what can you do with your current resource endowment in this industry, whether you have the opportunity to rush up and seize more market share, or whether you can make a separate product line from subdivided demand and fields. Or simply jump out of the current product and company framework to solve some problems of the whole industry.\\nTake our company as an example. In the process of serving a financial company at the beginning of this year, we found that most of their customers are logistics and transportation enterprises, and these enterprises have a lot of resistance in the process of cooperation with our customers. The reason is that, There is no financial standard system within these enterprises, which leads to accounting chaos. It is inevitable that our customers will pay huge human costs in the process of serving them. Therefore, customers discussed with us how to solve the problem. Being sensitive to marketing digitization, we realized that a big problem for logistics and transportation enterprises is the lack of standardization. If there are standardized processes and systems, there will not be too many problems. How to solve the problem of standardization. The answer is digital, but as a private marketing service company, we don't have much digital experience. We can only say that we have the ability of software development in marketing digitization. Able to develop digital tools. But it's not easy to do. After all, we are not familiar with the logistics and transportation industry. But after all, if we want to help customers solve their problems, we must go to the market.\\nTherefore, the problem focuses on the digitization of logistics enterprises. We need to find solutions. Finally, through our years of cognition and sensitivity in marketing digitization, we finally chose to use the nail based low code service platform to help customers customize their business and financial management applications.\\nYou might ask, why can we do it? 1. Because the financial customers we serve, we sign the annual contract. We have been understanding their customers and their problems for a long time, and gradually have a deep understanding of logistics and transportation, including their business processes and problem points.\\n2\\\\. Secondly, because the low code platform is suitable to build, its architecture has helped us solve most of the problems of software development in the past. We only need to deeply understand the business process, the problems that logistics enterprises want to solve and their demands. According to these, we can build this management system with logic, process and simple procrastination. In fact, the premise is that we deeply understand their pain points, business processes and difficulties.\\nTherefore, the customer of the logistics enterprise finally signed a separate contract with us to do a good job. At first we refused. But because of this, we find that for many small and medium-sized enterprises, internal management process is a great demand and pain point. However, the existing mature products in the market, such as some management software or SaaS system, can not meet their needs of personalized customization and acceptable price. We have found this market opportunity, but at present, we have not chosen to invest in it, and we are not quite sure how big these needs are or how much revenue can be generated. At present, we still wait and see. Through the introduction of friends these days, a pharmaceutical chain enterprise has also found that we have the demand for internal management applications. We are already doing it. Before, we didn't dare to think that this thing could make us money.\\nMaybe this is natural. On the track of private marketing, we are constantly accumulating, and our colleagues have maintained enough openness and learning about the digitization of internal management of the enterprise. This may be a good business direction.\",\"timestamp\":1640773938,\"title\":\"如何在自己所处的行业，不断深耕发现可以创业的机会？需要做哪些洞察？\"},\"digest\":\"Ccd3hzX8n155jOC37nq2mmUtOazPWfq3aLAsInlmEEo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x1d00070eEFDe8fB9894903D9852CCad7625796D9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"vQ63rYQeRZz7b-8lxsOZhn5eBi-ineDQh0-A8LIH0GM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1PksfSYZn3kNs6DpkRJH50y82-Ogl1GKyHG9F_oqBzs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"WBW-boRxYRJq4HT21CXXb78kK0SPf5zi5_aViOOhuKvFGCIR-VPJJ8h6n_xsbDUF9XjQRsCAheG4Iwx59MjY4A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x84ed11ac08260c92a9888694d93792ebf6c2603d3b531243ed68b6439926e16f6a08bd2b54886335a940e65a7ee032966cef530a788872997665f10b1480f4881b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"vQ63rYQeRZz7b-8lxsOZhn5eBi-ineDQh0-A8LIH0GM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1PksfSYZn3kNs6DpkRJH50y82-Ogl1GKyHG9F_oqBzs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Ccd3hzX8n155jOC37nq2mmUtOazPWfq3aLAsInlmEEo\"}"
