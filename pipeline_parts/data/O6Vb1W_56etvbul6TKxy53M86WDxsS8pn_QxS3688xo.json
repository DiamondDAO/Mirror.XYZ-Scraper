They decide to take over Earth’s resources and, prior to arrival, send technology that blocks the human race’s capacity for theoretical technological advancement to the next stages (using ‘sophons’).\\n\\n![“Three-body Problem Animation”, Wikipedia, Dnttllthmmnm, 2017 CE \\\\[4\\\\]](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QrkclrJPloFr2q6JHKSQU.gif?height=300&width=300)\\n\\nNearly all of the major plot action in the trilogy is driven by the posited prime directive of species and civilisational survival and how this drive gives rise to a “dark forest” conjecture.\\n\\n#### “The universe is a dark forest. Every civilization is an armed hunter stalking through the trees like a ghost … If he finds other life … there’s only one thing he can do: open fire and eliminate them. In this forest, hell is other people. An eternal threat that any life that exposes its own existence will be swiftly wiped out. This is the picture of cosmic civilization. It’s the explanation for the Fermi Paradox.”\\n\\n(Liu Cixin)[\\\\[5\\\\]](#_ftn5)\\n\\nThere are some obvious fault-lines that could be examined in aspects of the propositions and how they compound, but the basic premises and conjectures on game theory appear plausible, as follows.[\\\\[6\\\\]](#_ftn6)\\n\\n● The universe is a dark forest where many civilisations live unaware of the location of all others.\\n\\n● Each civilisation, with sufficiently advanced technology and capacity for interstellar travel, has experienced exponential technological advancement.\\n\\n● Upon discovering another civilisation, a civilisation must necessarily annihilate the discovered population or risk annihilation.\\n\\n● The ‘game-theoretic’ driving force for annihilation is the ‘chain of suspicion’.\\n\\nThe saddest thing about these game theory conjectures is the contention, with some validity, that under certain conditions even two species that have good intentions towards other species can be driven to the requirement for preemptive extinction strikes against each other due to the risk of total annihilation by an aggressive species.\\n\\nThe preemptive aggression arises due to the chain of suspicion that the other species does not share the same primary values — all arising from the difficulties of trust and trusted communications:\\n\\n● Hostile civilisation will attack another civilisation on discovery before it is itself threatened.\\n\\n● A friendly civilisation will only attack when it is threatened.\\n\\n○ Assume A is friendly:\\n\\n■ A has no way of knowing if B is friendly\\n\\n○ Assume A believes B is friendly and B believes A is friendly:\\n\\n■ how does A know that B believes A is friendly?\\n\\n○ Assume A knows B believes A is friendly:\\n\\n■ how does A know B knows that A knows that B believes A is friendly?\\n\\n○ And so on exhaustingly!\\n\\nIn the absence of trust or a triangulated solution (or cosmic adjudicator), the resolution becomes a Nash equilibrium of ‘kill or be killed’.[\\\\[7\\\\]](#_ftn7) The only alternative is to try to remain hidden and, in the trilogy, that requires technological regression.\\n\\n#### “do you know what the greatest expression of regard for a race or civilization is?” “No, what?” “Annihilation. That’s the highest respect a civilization can receive. They would only feel threatened by a civilization they truly respect.”\\n\\n[\\\\[8\\\\]](#_ftn8)\\n\\nIn the story, in the face of extinction at the hands of the Trisolarans, humans ultimately cause the destruction of the Trisolar system. Humans broadcast the Trilsolar location to the universe at large, leading another race of hostile predator civilisations to receive the information and thereafter destroy one of Trisolar’s three suns.\\n\\nLater, our solar system is destroyed when another hostile civilisation discovers our location having noticed the interactions between Earth and Trisolar. That hostile civilisation takes a more creative technological approach to annihilation, transforming our solar system into a two-dimensional painting — something like the representation in van Gogh’s “The Starry Night”.\\n\\n![Vincent Van Gogh, “The Starry Night”, 1889 CE, Wikipedia.org, public domain.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ESW9gMZd_2hrenu8byIpb.jpeg?height=4054&width=5118&size=medium)\\n\\nThe ‘dark forest’ propositions have much to recommend them as a way of thinking about game theory, communication problems and the ethics and *Realpolitik* of technological competition and asymmetry. The propositions also have the benefit of being grounded in some mathematical foundations and, in respect of the Cold War, some historical perspective. They can give rise to scenarios that can be formulated and scored for optimality (subject always to certain assumptions and conditions that may not always or ever apply in any particular real-world scenario).\\n\\nJohn Nash, the subject of the film *A Beautiful Mind*,[\\\\[9\\\\]](#_ftn9) was a leading academic in the game theory space. Nash’s Equilibrium:\\n\\n#### “is a concept of game theory where the optimal outcome of a game is one where no player has an incentive to deviate from his chosen strategy after considering an opponent’s choice.”\\n\\n[\\\\[10\\\\]](#_ftn10)\\n\\nNash’s Equilibrium gives rise to many interesting and sometimes counterintuitive outcomes. For example, the famous ‘prisoner’s dilemma’ leads to a rationally justifiable worse outcome for both parties when they must choose (absent trust) between working together to achieve their freedom or turning on each other in the hope of being the one to defect so as to achieve a reduced punishment.\\n\\n*Prisoner’s Dilemma*\\n\\nTwo members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge but have enough to convict both on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other (defect) by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The possible outcomes are as follows.\\n\\n● If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves two years in prison.\\n\\n● If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free, and B will serve three years in prison.\\n\\n● If A remains silent but B betrays A, A will serve three years in prison and B will be set free.\\n\\n● If A and B both remain silent, both of them will serve only one year in prison (on the lesser charge).\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*xwTq1raiH4rhi0zcpiyg8w.png)\\n\\nThe ‘prisoner’s dilemma’ leads to the situation that, in the absence of trust, it is always in the best interests of each party to betray/defect (i.e., compete against the other), notwithstanding that if they both cooperated the position for both would be better (Pareto-optimal). The rational self-centred optimal decision of a participant remains the same even when they know what the other participant will do.\\n\\nInterestingly, recently we have seen the rise of a new decentralised reserve currency (Olympus DAO) which has modelled game theoretic incentives to try to encourage participants (Ohmies) to buy and hold under a collaborative approach (3,3 together).[\\\\[12\\\\]](#_ftn12)\\n\\nIn the three-body problem, the application of this type of game theory analysis gives rise to the kill-or-be-killed payoff — this is the Nash Equilibrium for advanced life-forms in conditions of potential technological asymmetry.[\\\\[13\\\\]](#_ftn13)\\n\\nWith a purely agent-centric game theoretic foundation for ethics, it is easy to see how, absent strong self-restraint in accordance with other laws or ethical values, we end up with a world and universe that in many ways resembles a ‘dark forest’. It is an equilibrium where the opportunity for cooperative and collaborative games between intelligent beings is overwhelmed by fear, suspicion and ultimately by survival of the most intellectually and technologically advanced and aggressive beings.\\n\\nBetween humans, the world too often looks like a dark forest. In the modern Western dominant era, it has certainly been a dark forest for very many, including Australian aborigines, American Indians, Jews and people of colour (with murder, cultural destruction, enslavement and other detestable actions having affected tens of millions and still doing so today). The dark forest still exists for many millions of people today that are treated like consumable commodities. This applies in the so-called developed countries too, where people are often conditioned by their own politicians to act against their own best interests.\\n\\n#### “In every cry of every Man, In every Infants cry of fear, In every voice: in every ban, The mind-forg’d manacles I hear”\\n\\n(*William Blake*)\\\\[14\\\\]\\n\\nMany major ‘developed’ countries appear to be reverting to a more amoral political landscape. The economic environment is being structured and protected for the benefit of a vanishingly small number of humans, all under the management of a political class that appears immune to the consequences of its own decisions (with no ‘skin in the game’).[\\\\[15\\\\]](#_ftn15) We are in desperate need of independent audits and commissions to review the structural deficiencies of many ‘two-party’ or ‘first-past-the-post’ political states. They are not fit for purpose.[\\\\[16\\\\]](#_ftn16)\\n\\n#### “All of our coordination games are now competition games. That’s the new equilibrium … these are TOOLS by which smiley-face authoritarian concentrations of wealth and power have perverted all of our human endeavors. We need quantum change — meaning we must have change in the rules of the system, meaning that we must have change in the state of the system — because once you fall into the stable equilibrium of our Black Days, it is impossible for incremental change or adjustment to get you out. Not just difficult. Impossible. That’s what an equilibrium means. We cannot just open a door that has been welded shut. We must blow the door open. We must Burn. It. The. Fuck. Down.”\\n\\n(*Ben Hunt*)\\\\[17\\\\]\\n\\nHowever, it is in respect of our treatment of most other species and life-forms that we have made the Earth a vision of hell in many respects if the life-form has the misfortune of many to be born other than as a human (or perhaps a virus, cat, rat, dog or cockroach).\\n\\nI expect that this behaviour will come back to haunt the human race, much like slavery did and does for reflective, compassionate people. Even more so, if we do not mend our ways and build appropriate ethical frameworks for all life-forms, preferably before we meet (or become) more intelligent and powerful beings.\\n\\n![Image: Pxhere.com, public domain.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vciCHVGSudE7ejw_qfV6Q.jpg?height=1920&width=3072&&&&&size=medium)\\n\\n![(Warren Ellis and Nick Cave)\\\\[18\\\\]](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/En_RH9QhPKk3aAUTWtSFL.png?height=848&width=1600)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n[\\\\[1\\\\]](#_ftnref1) Dante Alighieri, *Inferno*, [Canto I](https://poets.org/poem/inferno-canto-i), 1472 CE.\\n\\n[\\\\[2\\\\]](#_ftnref2) “[Forest picture](https://pxhere.com/en/photo/1180528)”, 2017 CE, pxhere.com,\\\\* \\\\*public domain.\\n\\n[\\\\[3\\\\]](#_ftnref3) Liu Cixin, 2010 CE.\\n\\n[\\\\[4\\\\]](#_ftnref4) “[Three-body Problem Animation](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Three-body_Problem_Animation_with_COM.gif)”, Wikipedia, [Dnttllthmmnm](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Dnttllthmmnm&action=edit&redlink=1), 2017 CE: “the three-body problem is the problem of taking the initial positions and velocities (or [momenta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum)) of three point masses and solving for their subsequent motion according to [Newton’s laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion) and [Newton’s law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation).
