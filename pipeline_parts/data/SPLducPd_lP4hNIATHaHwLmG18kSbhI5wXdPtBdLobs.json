"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**In Mid June of 2021, the President of Tanzania, Mrs. Samia Suluhu Hassan, made a speech that sent ripples of excitement and speculation around the world. In reference to the revolutionary phenomenon of blockchain technologies and cryptocurrency assets, she stated the following:** \\n\\n**“We have witnessed the emergence of a new journey through the internet. - I know that throughout the nation...they have not accepted or started using these routes. However, my call to the Central Bank is that you should start working on that development. - The Central Bank should be ready for the changes and not be caught unprepared.”**\\n\\n**Upon hearing this news, you may be wondering…What is Blockchain? & What are Cryptocurrencies? In short, Blockchain is a form of digital ledger that is completely secure and decentralized. This means that it does not depend on any third party (such as a bank, hospital, or school) to enable record keeping, peer-to-peer transactions, and contractual agreements. As a flexible and fast-growing industry, Blockchain has vast potential to fundamentally change the way people and businesses interact with each other and store information. Many promising open-source projects exist, such as Ethereum, Chainlink, Polkadot, and Cardano, that work transparently with people all over the world to explore and develop useful applications in several industries such as healthcare, education, and finance.** \\n\\n**In the financial sector, the most famous example of a Cryptocurrency that lives on its own Blockchain is Bitcoin, which was recently accepted as legal tender by the Central American Nation of El Salvador. Our northern neighbor of Ethiopia has also partnered with Cardano to enable millions of high school students to own their own secure digital identities on the Blockchain. In a world where so much power is held by large institutions and the most elite members of society, this technology gives common people freedom, security, and far more control over their own lives. In my humble opinion, Mama Suluhu is very wise to advise us all to learn and prepare ourselves for this liberating technological revolution.**\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1635423412,\"title\":\"Blockchains & Cryptocurrencies in Tanzania\"},\"digest\":\"OfL0HopE5soYRSulSJw_av8y8gWEgmLFytTvLdm8c7Q\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8d4Ac6b8cE54d59921A14a624193De4FdED632B1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"O_IVP-uozz_u09bSPRfG5NG6M731ekc3SgFd4kPU1XU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KJSqF3-LFk5MAmmHb108hHZvpNuucAc8V6sRQE7xqQE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"vpYucXQeuGTRClVIX4U30jVYRhMu10WZCVI5Ql1h3fUgrSwLjulKjvibEoiYJN4m8b5OmpF4GxEaX7IKX8SMgw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8abcdaded7f93695d6e8a14ec4ac42a601fb0759d83fddf4bd03f0cf0b676d1c4d428e66fb6b34f8ef522018e4e09c4281efdbc34b2d9f10f8c7ebe886fa75f41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"O_IVP-uozz_u09bSPRfG5NG6M731ekc3SgFd4kPU1XU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KJSqF3-LFk5MAmmHb108hHZvpNuucAc8V6sRQE7xqQE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"OfL0HopE5soYRSulSJw_av8y8gWEgmLFytTvLdm8c7Q\"}"
