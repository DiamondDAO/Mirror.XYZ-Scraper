"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Vere--now we are in the dark.\\\"\\n\\nAnd then he heard the revelation of the child, there under the weary rock, as he had heard the revelation of the mother. How different it was! Yet in it, too, there was the beating of the pulse of life. But there was no regret, no looking back into the past, no sombre exhibition of force seeking--as a thing groping, desperately in a gulf --an object on which to exercise itself. Instead there was aspiration, there was expectation, there was the wonder of bright eyes lifted to the sun. And there was a reverence that for a moment recalled to Artois the reverence of the dead man from whose loins this child had sprung. But Vere's was the reverence of understanding, not of a dim amazement--more beautiful than Maurice's. When he had been with Hermione under the brooding rock Artois had been impregnated with the passionate despair of humanity, and had seen for a moment the world with out-stretched hands, seeking, surely, for the nonexistent, striving to hold fast the mirage. Now he was impregnated with humanity's passionate hope. He saw life light-footed in a sweet chase for things ideal. And all the blackness of the rock and of the silent sea was irradiated with the light that streamed from a growing soul.\\n\\nA voice--an inquiring, searching voice, surely, rose quivering from some distance on the sea, startling Vere and Artois. It was untrained but unshy, and the singer forced it with resolute hardihood that was indifferent to the future. Artois had never heard the Marchesino sing before, but he knew at once that it was he. Some one at the island must surely have told the determined youth that Vere was voyaging, and he was now in quest of her, sending her an amorous summons couched in the dialect of Naples.\\n\\nVere moved impatiently.\\n\\n\\\"Really!\\\" she began.\\n\\nBut she did not continue. The quivering voice began another verse. Artois had said nothing, but, as he sat listening to this fervid protestation, a message illuminated as it were by the vibrato, he began to hate the terrible frankness of the Italian nature which, till now, he had thought he loved. The beauty of reticence appealed to him in a new way. There was savagery in a bellowed passion. The voice was travelling. They heard it moving onward towards Nisida. Artois wondered if Vere knew who was the singer. She did not leave him long in doubt.\\n\\n\\\"Now's our chance, Monsieur Emile!\\\" she said, suddenly, leaning towards him. \\\"Row to the island for your life, or the Marchesino will catch us!\\\"\\n\\nWithout a word he bent to the oars.\\n\\n\\\"How absurd the Marchesino is!\\\"\\n\\nVere spoke aloud, released from fear.\\n\\n\\\"Absurd? He is Neapolitan.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well, then! The Neapolitans are absurd!\\\" said Vere, with decision. \\\"And what a voice! Ruffo doesn't sing like that. That shaking sounds--sounds so artificial.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And yet I dare say he is very much in earnest.\\\"\\n\\nArtois was almost pleading a cause against his will.\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\"\\n\\nThe girl gave almost a little puff that suggested a rather childish indignation.\\n\\n\\\"I like the people best,\\\" she added. \\\"They say what they feel simply, and it means ever so much more. Am I a democrat?\\\"\\n\\nHe could not help laughing.\\n\\n\\\"Chi lo sa? An Anarchist perhaps.\\\"\\n\\nShe laughed too.\\n\\n\\\"Bella tu si--Bella tu si! It's too absurd! One would think--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What, Vere?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Never mind. Don't be inquisitive, Monsieur Emile.\\\"\\n\\nHe rowed on meekly.\\n\\n\\\"There is San Francesco's light,\\\" she said, in a moment. \\\"I wonder if it is late. Have we been away long? I have no idea.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No more have I.\\\"\\n\\nNor had he.\\n\\nWhen they reached land he made the boat fast and turned to walk up to the house with her. He found her standing very still just behind him at the edge of the sea, with a startled look on her face.\\n\\n\\\"What is it, Vere?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\\"Hush!\\\"\\n\\nShe held up her hand and bent her head a little to one side, as one listening intently.\\n\\n\\\"I thought I heard--I did hear--something--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Something?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes--so strange--I can't hear it now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What was it like?\\\"\\n\\nShe looked fixedly at him.\\n\\n\\\"Like some one crying--horribly.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where? Near us?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not far. Listen again.\\\"\\n\\nHe obeyed, holding his breath. But he heard nothing except the very faint lapping of the sea at their feet.\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps I imagined it,\\\" she said at length.\\n\\n\\\"Let us go up to the house,\\\" he said. \\\"Come, Vere.\\\"\\n\\nHe had a sudden wish to take her into the house. But she remained where she was.\\n\\n\\\"Could it have been fancy, Monsieur Emile?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No doubt.\\\"\\n\\nHer eyes were intensely grave, almost frightened.\\n\\n\\\"But--just look, will you? Perhaps there really is somebody.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where? It's so dark.\\\"\\n\\nArtois hesitated; but Vere's face was full of resolution, and he turned reluctantly to obey her. As he did so there came to them both through the dark the sound of a woman crying and sobbing convulsively.\\n\\n\\\"What is it? Oh, who can it be?\\\" Vere cried out.\\n\\nShe went swiftly towards the sound.\\n\\nArtois followed, and found her bending down over the figure of a girl who was crouching against the cliff, and touching her shoulder.\\n\\n\\\"What is it? What is the matter? Tell me.\\\"\\n\\nThe girl looked up, startled, and showed a passionate face that was horribly disfigured. Upon the right cheek, extending from the temple almost to the line of the jaw, a razor had cut a sign, a brutal sign of the cross. As Vere saw it, showing redly through the darkness, she recoiled. The girl read the meaning of her movement, and shrank backward, putting up her hand to cover the wound. But Vere recovered instantly, and bent down once more, intent only on trying to comfort this sorrow, whose violence seemed to open to her a door into a new and frightful world.\\n\\n\\\"Vere!\\\" said Artois. \\\"Vere, you had better--\\\"\\n\\nThe girl turned round to him.\\n\\n\\\"It must be Peppina!\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Yes. But--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Please go up to the house, Monsieur Emile. I will come in a moment.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I can't leave you--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Please go. Just tell Madre I'm soon coming.\\\"\\n\\nThere was something inexorable in her voice. She turned away from him and began to speak softly to Peppina.\\n\\nArtois obeyed and left her.\\n\\nHe knew that just then she would not acknowledge his authority. As he went slowly up the steps he wondered--he feared. Peppina had cried with the fury of despair, and the Neapolitan who is desperate knows no reticence.\\n\\nWas the red sign of passion to be scored already upon Vere's white life? Was she to pass even now, in this night, from her beautiful ignorance to knowledge?\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\nThat night the Marchesino failed in his search for Vere, and he returned to Naples not merely disappointed but incensed. He had learned from a fisherman in the Saint's Pool that she was out upon the sea \\\"with a Signore,\\\" and he had little difficulty in guessing who this Signore was. Of course it was \\\"Caro Emilio,\\\" the patron of Maria Fortunata. He began to consider his friend unfavorably. He remembered how frankly he had always told Emilio of his little escapades, with what enthusiasm, in what copious detail. Always he had trusted Emilio. And now Emilio was trying to play him false--worse, was making apparently a complete success of the attempt. For Emilio and Vere must have heard his beautiful singing, must have guessed from whom that vibrant voice proceeded, must have deliberately concealed themselves from its possessor. Where had they lain in hiding? His shrewd suspicion fell upon the very place. Virgilio's Grotto had surely been their refuge.\\n\\n\\\"Ladro! Vigiliacco!\\\" Words of no uncertain meaning flowed from his overcharged heart. His whole hot nature was aroused. His spirit was up in arms. And now, almost for the first time, he drew a comparison between his age and Emilio's. Emilio was an old man. He realized it. Why had he never realized it before? Was he, full of youth, beauty, chivalrous energy and devotion, to be interfered with, set aside, for a man with gray hairs thick upon his head, for a man who spent half his hours bent over a writing-table? Emilio had never wished him to know the ladies of the island. He knew the reason now, and glowed with a fiery lust of battle. Vere had attracted him from the first. But this opposition drove on attraction into something stronger, more determined. He said to himself that he was madly in love. Never yet had he been worsted in an amour by any man. The blood surged to his head at the mere thought of being conquered in the only battle of life worth fighting--the battle for a woman, and by a man of more than twice his age, a man who ought long ago to have been married and have had children as old as the Signorina Vere.\\n\\nWell, he had been a good friend to Emilio. Now Emilio should see that the good friend could be the good enemy. Late that night, as he sat alone in front of the Caffe Turco smoking innumerable cigarettes, he resolved to show these foreigners the stuff a Neapolitan was made of. They did not know. Poor, ignorant beings from cold England, drowned forever in perpetual yellow fogs, and from France, country of volatility but not of passion, they did not know what the men of the South, of a volcanic soil, were capable of, once they were roused, once their blood spoke and their whole nature responded! It was time they learned. And he would undertake to teach them. As he drove towards dawn up the dusty hill to Capodimonte he was in a fever of excitement.\\n\\nThere was excitement, too, in the house on the island, but it did not centre round the Marchesino.\\n\\nThat night, for the first time in her young life, Vere did not sleep. She heard the fisherman call, but the enchantment of sea doings did not stir her. She was aware for the first time of the teeming horrors of life. There, in the darkness beneath the cliff, Peppina had sobbed out her story, and Vere, while she listened, had stepped from girlhood into womanhood.\\n\\nShe had come into the house quietly, and found Artois waiting for her alone. Hermione had gone to bed, leaving word that she had a headache. And Vere was glad that night not to see her mother. She wished to see no one, and she bade Artois good-bye at once, telling him nothing, and not meeting his eyes when he touched her hand in adieu. And he had asked nothing. Why should he, when he read the truth in the grave, almost stern face of the child?\\n\\nVere knew.\\n\\nThe veils that hung before the happy eyes of childhood had been torn away, and those eyes had looked for the first time into the deeps of an unhappy human heart.\\n\\nAnd he had thought it possible to preserve, perhaps for a long while, Vere's beautiful ignorance untouched. He had thought of the island as a safe retreat in which her delicate, and as yet childish talent, might gradually mature under his influence and the influence of the sea. She had been like some charming and unusual plant of the sea, shot with sea colors, wet with sea winds, fresh with the freshness of the smooth-backed waves. And now in a moment she was dropped into the filthy dust of city horrors. What would be the result upon her and upon her dawning gift?\\n\\nThe double question was in his mind, and quite honestly. For his interest of the literary man in Vere was very vivid. Never yet had he had a pupil or dreamed of having one. There are writers who found a school, whose fame is carried forward like a banner by young and eager hands. Artois had always stood alone, ardently admired, ardently condemned, but not imitated. And he had been proud of his solitude. But--lately--had not underthoughts come into his mind, thoughts of leaving an impress on a vivid young intellect, a soul that was full of life, and the beginnings of energy? Had not he dreamed, however vaguely, of forming, like some sculptor of genius, an exquisite statuette--poetry, in the slim form of a girl-child singing to the world?\\n\\nAnd now Peppina had rushed into Vere's life, with sobs and a tumult of cries to the Madonna and the saints, and, no doubt, with imprecations upon the wickedness of men. And where were the dreams of the sea? And his dreams, where were they?\\n\\nThat night the irony that was in him woke up and smiled bitterly, and he asked himself how he, with his burden of years and of knowledge of life, could have been such a fool as to think it possible to guard any one against the assaults of the facts of life. Hermione, perhaps, had been wiser than he, and yet he could not help feeling something that was almost like anger against her for what he called her quixotism. The woman of passionate impulses--how dangerous she is, even when her impulses are generous, are noble! Action without thought, though the prompting heart behind it be a heart of gold--how fatal may it be!\\n\\nAnd then he remembered a passionate impulse that had driven a happy woman across a sea to Africa, and he was ashamed.\\n\\nYet again the feeling that was almost like hostility returned. He said to himself that Hermione should have learned caution in the passing of so many years, that she ought to have grown older than she had. But there was something unconquerably young, unconquerably na?ve, in her-- something that, it seemed, would never die. Her cleverness went hand in hand with a short-sightedness that was like a rather beautiful, yet sometimes irritating stupidity. And this latter quality might innocently make victims, might even make a victim of her own child.\\n\\nAnd then a strange desire rose up in Artois, a desire to protect Vere against her own mother.\\n\\nBut how could that be done?\\n\\nVere, guarded by the beautiful unconsciousness of youth, was unaware of the subtleties that were brought into activity by her. That the Marchesino was, or thought himself, in love with her she realized. But she could not connect any root-sincerity with his feeling. She was accustomed vaguely to think of all young Southern Italians as perpetually sighing for some one's dark eyes. The air of the South was full of love songs that rose and fell without much more meaning than a twitter of birds, that could not be stilled because it was so natural. And the Marchesino was a young aristocrat who did absolutely nothing of any importance to the world. The Northern blood in Vere demanded other things of a man than imitations of a seal, the clever driving of a four-in-hand, light-footed dancing, and songs to the guitar. In Gaspare she saw more reality than she saw as yet in the Marchesino. The dawning intellect of her began to grasp already the nobility of work. Gaspare had his work to do, and did it with loyal efficiency. Ruffo, too, had his profession of the sea. He drew out of the deep his livelihood. Even with the fever almost upon him he had been out by night in the storm. That which she liked and respected in Gaspare, his perfect and natural acceptance of work as a condition of his life, she liked and respected in Ruffo.\\n\\nOn the morning after the incident with Peppina, Vere came down looking strangely grave and tired. Her mother, too, was rather heavy-eyed, and the breakfast passed almost severely. When it was over Hermione, who still conducted Vere's education, but with a much relaxed vigor in the summer months, suggested that they should read French together.\\n\\n\\\"Let us read one of Monsieur Emile's books, Madre,\\\" said Vere, with an awakening of animation. \\\"You know I have never read one, only two or three baby stories, and articles that don't count.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, but Emile's books are not quite suitable for you yet, Vere.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, Madre?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They are very fine, but they dive deep into life, and life contains many sad and many cruel things.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oughtn't we to prepare ourselves for them, then?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not too soon, I think. I am nearly sure that if you were to read Emile's books just yet you would regret it.\\\"\\n\\nVere said nothing.\\n\\n\\\"Don't you think you can trust me to judge for you in this matter, figlia mia? I--I am almost certain that Emile himself would think as I do.\\\"\\n\\nIt was not without an effort, a strong effort, that Hermione was able to speak the last sentence. Vere came nearer to her mother, and stood before her, as if she were going to say something that was decisive or important. But she hesitated.\\n\\n\\\"What is it, Vere?\\\" Hermione asked, gently.\\n\\n\\\"I might learn from life itself what Monsieur Emile's books might teach me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Some day. And when that time comes neither I nor he would wish to keep them out of your hands.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I see. Well, Madre dear, let us read whatever you like.\\\"\\n\\nVere had been on the verge of telling her mother about the previous night and Peppina. But, somehow, at the last moment she could not.\\n\\nAnd thus, for the moment at least, Artois and she shared another secret of which Hermione was unaware.\\n\\nBut very soon Hermione noticed that Vere was specially kind always to Peppina. They did not meet, perhaps, very often, but when by chance they did Vere spoke to the disfigured girl with a gentleness, almost a tenderness, that were striking.\\n\\n\\\"You like Peppina, Vere?\\\" asked her mother one day.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, because I pity her so much.\\\"\\n\\nThere was a sound that was almost like passion in the girl's voice; and, looking up, Hermione saw that her eyes were full of light, as if the spirit had set two lamps in them.\\n\\n\\\"It is strange,\\\" Vere continued, in a quieter tone; \\\"but sometimes I feel as if on the night of the storm I had had a sort of consciousness of her coming--as if, when I saw the Saint's light shining, and bent down to the water and made the sign of the Cross, I already knew something of Peppina's wound, as if I made the sign to protect our Casa del Mare, to ward off something evil.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That was coming to us with Peppina, do you mean?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know, Madre.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are you thinking of Giulia's foolish words about the evil eye?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. It's all vague, Madre. But Peppina's cross sometimes seems to me to be a sign, a warning come into the house. When I see it it seems to say there is a cross to be borne by some one here, by one of us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How imaginative you are, Vere!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So are you, Madre! But you try to hide it from me.\\\"\\n\\nHermione was startled. She took Vere's hand, and held it for a moment in silence, pressing it with a force that was nervous. And her luminous, expressive eyes, immensely sensitive, beautiful in their sensitiveness, showed that she was moved. At last she said:\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps that is true. Yes, I suppose it is.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why do you try to hide it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I suppose--I think because--because it has brought to me a great deal of pain. And what we hide from others we sometimes seem almost to be destroying by that very act, though of course we are not.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. But I think I should like to encourage my imagination.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you encourage it?\\\" the mother asked, looking at her closely.\\n\\nAgain, as Vere had been on the edge of telling her mother all she knew about Peppina, she was on the edge of telling her about the poems of the sea. And again, moved by some sudden, obstinate reluctance, come she knew not why, she withheld the words that were almost on her lips.\\n\\nAnd each time the mother was aware of something avoided, of an impulse stifled, and therefore of a secret deliberately kept. The first time Hermione had not allowed her knowledge to appear. But on this second occasion for a moment she lost control of herself, and when, after a perceptible pause, Vere said, \\\"I know I love it,\\\" and was silent, she exclaimed:\\n\\n\\\"Keep your secrets, Vere. Every one has a right to their freedom.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, Madre--\\\" Vere began, startled by her mother's abrupt vehemence.\\n\\n\\\"No, Vere, no! My child, my dearest one, never tell me anything but of your own accord, out of your own heart and desire. Such a confidence is beautiful. But anything else--anything else, I could not bear from you.\\\"\\n\\nAnd she got up and left the room, walking with a strange slowness, as if she put upon herself an embargo not to hasten.\\n\\nThe words and--specially that--the way in which they were spoken made Vere suddenly and completely aware of something that perhaps she had already latently known--that the relation between her mother and herself had, of late, not been quite what once it was. At moments she had felt almost shy of her mother, only at moments. Formerly she had always told her mother everything, and had spoken--as her mother had just said--out of her own heart and desire, with eagerness, inevitably. Now--well, now she could not always do that. Was it because she was growing older? Children are immensely frank. She had been a child. But now--she thought of the Marchesino, of Peppina, of her conversation with Monsieur Emile in the Grotto of Virgilio, and realized the blooming of her girlhood, was aware that she was changing. And she felt half frightened, then eager, ardently eager. An impulse filled her, the impulse towards a fulness of life that, till now, she had not known. And for a moment she loved those little, innocent secrets that she kept.\\n\\nBut then she thought again of her mother, the most beloved of all her world. There had been in her mother's voice a sound of tragedy.\\n\\nVere stood for a long while by the window thinking.\\n\\nThe day was very hot. She longed to bathe, to wash away certain perplexities that troubled her in the sea. But Gaspare was not on the island. He had gone she knew not where. She looked at the sea with longing. When would Gaspare be back? Well, at least she could go out in the small boat. Then she would be near to the water. She ran down the steps and embarked. At first she only rowed a little way out into the Saint's Pool, and then leaned back against the white cushions, and looked up at the blue sky, and let her hand trail in the water. But she was restless to-day. The Pool did not suffice her, and she began to paddle out along the coast towards Naples. She passed a ruined, windowless house named by the fisherfolk \\\"The Palace of the Spirits,\\\" and then a tiny hamlet climbing up from a minute harbor to an antique church. Children called to her. A fisherman shouted: \\\"Buon viaggio, Signorina!\\\" She waved her hand to them apathetically and rowed slowly on. Now she had a bourne. A little farther on there was a small inlet of the sea containing two caves, not gloomy and imposing like the Grotto of Virgilio, but cosy, shady, and serene. Into the first of them she ran the boat until its prow touched the sandy bottom. Then she lay down at full length, with her hands behind her head on the cushions, and thought--and thought.\\n\\nFigures passed through her mind, a caravan of figures travelling as all are travelling: her mother, Gaspare, Giulia, with her plump and swarthy face; Monsieur Emile, to whom she had drawn so pleasantly, interestingly near in these last days; the Marchesino (strutting from the hips and making his bold eyes round), Peppina, Ruffo. They went by and returned, gathered about her, separated, melted away as people do in our musings. Her eyes were fixed on the low roof of the cave. The lilt of the water seemed to rock her soul in a cradle. \\\"Madre--Ruffo! Madre--Ruffo!\\\" The words were in her mind like a refrain. And then the oddity, the promiscuity of life struck her. How many differences there were in this small group of people by whom she was surrounded! What\\n\\nwould their fates be, and hers? Would her life be happy? She did not feel afraid. Youth ran in her veins. But--would it be? She saw the red cross on Peppina's cheek. Why was one singled out for misery, another for joy? Which would be her fate? Ruffo seemed to be standing near her. She had seen him several times in these last days, but only at evening, fugitively, when he came in the boat with the fishermen. He was stronger now. He had saluted her eagerly. She had spoken to him from the shore. But he had not landed again on the island. She felt as if she saw his bright and beaming eyes. And Ruffo--would he be happy? She hoped so. She wanted him to be happy. He was such a dear, active boy--such a real boy. What must it be like to have a brother? Gaspare approved of Ruffo now, she thought; and Gaspare did not like everybody, and was fearfully blunt in expressing his opinion. She loved his bluntness. How delightfully his nose twitched when he was pleased! Dear old Gaspare! She could never feel afraid of anything or anybody when he was near. Monsieur Emile--the poems--the Marchesino singing. She closed her eyes to think the better.\\n\\n\\\"Signorina! Signorina!\\\"\\n\\nVere woke and sat up.\\n\\n\\\"Signorina!\\\"\\n\\nGaspare was looking at her from his boat.\\n\\n\\\"Gaspare!\\\"\\n\\nShe began to realize things.\\n\\n\\\"I was--I was thinking.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signorina. I always think like that when I am in bed.\\\"\\n\\nShe laughed. She was wide awake now.\\n\\n\\\"How did you find me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I met one of the fishermen. He had seen you row into the cave.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\"\\n\\nShe looked at him more steadily. His brown face was hot. Perspiration stood on his forehead just under the thick and waving hair.\\n\\n\\\"Where have you been, Gaspare? Not to Naples in all this heat?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have been to Mergellina, Signorina.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mergellina! Did you see Ruffo?\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1637314181,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"I should be a liar if I said I am not pleased.
