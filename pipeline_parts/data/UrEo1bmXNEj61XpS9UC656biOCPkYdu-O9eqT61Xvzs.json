It appears that both utilitarian (balancing) and deontological (good or bad in itself) ethical theories have normally failed to find suitable answers.\\n\\nFor the ethical framework proposed, I have separated the decision-makers under the framework (only sapient beings can be capable of this) from all other affected life-forms. This is practically necessary. The main problem is to then try to ensure we deal with the expected discrimination, prejudice, self-centredness and other subjective issues that arise when sapient beings compete for resources with each other and other life-forms.\\n\\nWe need to deal with our objectification of all other life-forms. Most animals are treated just as objects, to be used as we see fit and with no thought of their needs and desires (including for freedom of action). As we will consider later, this process is cultural (including legal and linguistic), and it allows us to avoid seeing the life-force and the intrinsic value of the life-forms — other than in respect of what they can do for us or what we can do to them.\\n\\nThe poet Rainer Maria Rilke sought to find a way to connect to nature and other life-forms more empathetically. He developed a process of in-seeing which sought to see the thing being viewed from an inside-out perspective.[\\\\[3\\\\]](#_ftn3)\\n\\n![(Rainer Maria Rilke)\\\\[4\\\\]](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\\\*3qJes0Hgy1BWuLnEhNdOHg.png?&&size=medium)\\n\\n![Alan Levine, “Jaguar”, pxhere.com, CC BY 2.0](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*-_CDEc9TEXP-w6miT1PIeA.png)\\n\\nThat said, Ted Hughes’ take on the irrepressibility of the nature of an imprisoned Jaguar is preferred.\\n\\n![(Ted Hughes)\\\\[5\\\\]](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\\\*lsqCUCkQTu1FqdfoQXxRfg.png?&&size=medium)\\n\\nIn respect of the potential for non-human artificial intelligence (AI), it is unlikely we could have it unless we were willing to give computer code the chance to make many major mistakes by way of entropic algorithms and the inclusion of strong negative capability features.\\n\\nIn Keats’ letter (referenced above) he describes a unique soul or identity as being built on various materials:\\n\\n● the intelligence or Mind\\n\\n● the human heart\\n\\n● the World or Elemental space suited for the proper action of Mind and Heart on each other for the purpose of forming the Soul\\n\\nIf we substitute the capacity to feel, love and suffer for the ‘human heart’ we can see that, with sufficient intelligence, love and suffering and the space in which to explore freedom, life-forms can develop souls (become beings capable of seeing beyond the fundamental illusion of complete separateness and absolute form). This is the higher level of sapience that humans should aim for.\\n\\n**“This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole \\\\[of\\\\] nature in its beauty.”**\\n\\n(*Albert Einstein*)[\\\\[6\\\\]](#_ftn6)\\n\\nMany of us will not manage to reach Keats’ high threshold of a ‘soul’ (a unique consciousness), even though we may have the capability. This concept reminds one of the difficulties of a person reaching enlightenment (in accordance with Buddhist doctrine).\\n\\nIt is interesting that the word for one who has passed beyond the illusion of form is ‘enlightened’. Light (energy) is the sacred power in the universe and form is ever impermanent. In Eastern philosophy, the concept of enlightenment means one that has awoken to the true nature of things through wisdom and, in Buddhist philosophy, can break the cycle of birth, death and rebirth (that is, become universal consciousness).\\n\\nFor now, we must leave aside the rarer occurrences of those holy and wise people that have been able to intuit the deeper nature of the universe and life (the emptiness of the apparent form — or Śūnyatā).\\n\\n## 4.4 What ‘Is’ and What ‘Ought’ We To Do About It?\\n\\nEthics is aimed at creating the right conditions for virtuous actions. It is the study of whether any action can have the quality of being better or right within the balance of competing interests of life-forms. The questions of *what we should do* and *what is the right course of conduct* cross all cultural inventions and practices: religious, philosophical, atheistic or scientific.\\n\\nAlmost immediately after understanding the equivalence of energy and matter and the amount of energy locked up in every atom, many of the scientists involved saw the scope for mis-using this extraordinary energy to inflict pain and suffering with atomic weapons. Einstein was an avowed pacifist — like many people that had seen the pointless degradation of our humanity in World War I. However, when he realised the potential for the Nazi powers to unlock the power of the atom, he worked with a friend to warn Roosevelt.\\n\\n**“Szilárd discovered [the nuclear chain reaction](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/the-curious-wavefunction/leo-szilard-a-traffic-light-and-a-slice-of-nuclear-history/) — the process that unleashes the energy locked in atoms to create enormous explosions. And by 1939, he had become convinced that German scientists might be using current scientific developments to develop an atomic weapon. So he approached \\\\[Einstein\\\\] to warn U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Szilárd visited Einstein … When they told him about the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction, Einstein was shocked at the danger posed by [his 1905 special theory of relativity](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/apr/05/einstein-equation-emc2-special-relativity-alok-jha).”[\\\\[7\\\\]](#_ftn7)**\\n\\n![“Nagasakibomb”, Wikipedia, US National Archives and Records Administration, public domain.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\\\*rMt4M2zCGs_kpNsr-wSl7g.jpeg?&&size=medium)\\n\\nEinstein remained troubled by his involvement in the development of the devastating power of the atom bomb and its use in war.[\\\\[8\\\\]](#_ftn8) This concern and doubt is a manifestation of ethical wisdom.\\n\\n**“My God, what have we done?”**\\n\\n(*Robert Lewis*)[\\\\[9\\\\]](#_ftn9)\\n\\nI have always been concerned and surprised by an apparent lack of critical scepticism of the ethics of the Japanese atomic bombings within the general public — though the issue has been more hotly debated in academic circles.[\\\\[10\\\\]](#_ftn10)\\n\\nAs this book makes clear, I have no privileged moral perspective from which I can set myself up as judge and jury on such matters. My point is that no one has such a position.[\\\\[11\\\\]](#_ftn11)\\n\\nIt seems unarguable that the possession of atomic weapons has ushered in a historically long period without full-scale global conflict. It seems less clear that the bombing of Hiroshima[\\\\[12\\\\]](#_ftn12) and Nagasaki were necessary or proportionate to end the war.\\n\\n![what appears to be an old person with walking stick, burned onto stone steps in Hiroshima, Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty Images; taken from Ian Dickinson, “37 Hiroshima Aftermath Photos That Reveal The True Devastation”, Ian Dickinson, All Thats Interesting, 20 March 2018 CE. 'Fair use' assertion.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\\\*CSOHXSCfhn0xTudW2MNjJw.jpeg)\\n\\nGiven the factual and counterfactual difficulties and the scale of intentional civilian suffering,[\\\\[13\\\\]](#_ftn13) we must always add a significant discount to our confidence in the rightness of any such actions.\\n\\nWe must be particularly careful about ethical positions we hold if we benefit emotionally from holding those views (in this case, writing from the perspective of the ‘victorious’ side that committed the horrific acts). By some accounts it seems that by the time of the bombing the Japanese knew they were defeated, and the Russian intervention was more important than the bombs in ending the war. From this perspective, the bombs were more a show of strength aimed at terrifying the Russians.[\\\\[14\\\\]](#_ftn14)\\n\\n**“Some girls could not close their eyes. Some girls — their lips were all melted with their chins so they could not close \\\\[their mouths\\\\].”[\\\\[15\\\\]](#_ftn15)**\\n\\n(*Koko Kondo*)\\n\\nAnother important point arising from these events is that they remind us that, just because we are on the winning side of a war, we must not be uncritical of our leaders and their purported aims and justifications. That would be no better than ‘might is right’. We must also continue to seek evidence that supports or challenges the claim, subsequently made in 1947, by US Secretary of War Henry Stimson[\\\\[16\\\\]](#_ftn16) that the bombs were deployed to help reduce Allied casualties by shortening the expected continuation of the war.\\n\\nEven if that claim were true, it would not be ethically decisive. The potential of a continued war with increased casualties would have to be balanced against the specifically civilian nature of the two bombings — though we must also remember that hundreds of thousands of civilians were targeted and killed in more ‘traditional’ warfare, including firebombings.[\\\\[17\\\\]](#_ftn17)\\n\\n**“There are no words to describe how bright the flash was. The sun doesn’t compare at all.”**\\n\\n(*Major Ferebee*)[\\\\[18\\\\]](#_ftn18)\\n\\nIt is very difficult to look back from the current, much safer, time in the West and Japan (which safer time is in itself a potential consequence of these horrific events) and form conclusive opinions either way — especially given the brutal and total nature of WWII by the time it had entered its final phases. The ethical issues are seriously compounded by the difficulties in ascertaining the real facts and motives pertaining to these highly classified events of some time ago.\\n\\nThese issues should always give us caution when judging events in the past[\\\\[19\\\\]](#_ftn19) — particularly from a position of safety or a moral throne unblemished by the dirty difficulties of making decisions without absolute knowledge of the facts or certainty of the outcome.\\n\\n**“Among the calamities of war may be jointly numbered the diminution of the love of truth, by the falsehoods which interest dictates and credulity encourages.”**\\n\\n(*Samuel Johnson*)[\\\\[20\\\\]](#_ftn20)\\n\\nThe evidence points more to a US administration that had built a terrifying weapon and now wanted to use it — yes, to help end the war (though that had now become a foregone conclusion, with the Russians looking to intervene against Japan), but also, and more importantly, to set the scene for the postwar period, with the US wanting to be the dominant global power. It is with this factual background[\\\\[21\\\\]](#_ftn21) that the events should be judged, whatever the view taken on the ethical rightness or wrongness. We must always continue to re-assess the ethics of any event or action in light of new information about the past.\\n\\n**“When my information changes, I change my mind.”**\\n\\n(*John Maynard Keynes*)[\\\\[22\\\\]](#_ftn22)\\n\\nIn any event, what does seem clear is that this situation cannot be reduced to a simple binary answer of ‘ethical’ or ‘not ethical’ (not unless one assumes an absolutist position), and that knowledge of uncertainty is most valuable when building an ethics of life that aims to be resilient. That said, we can be more confident that overconfidence in the rightness of these actions — or any other actions that were intended to cause great suffering to civilians — should be most troubling (and suspect) to any ethicist.[\\\\[23\\\\]](#_ftn23)\\n\\nSome actions appear indisputably good and courageous: survivors of the attacks (many of whom became orphans) finding it in themselves to forgive the pilots of the bombers; those pilots and crew members trying to come to terms with the suffering caused by the bombs, meeting the victims and not assuming it was definitely justifiable.\\n\\nThese people step outside the simple comforting narratives that many rely upon to look at the deeper truth for the humans involved. They understand, through openness to suffering and compassion, that individual ‘free will’ and personal blame can be meaningless concepts.\\n\\n![‘Buddha Head’, Afghanistan (probably Hadda), 5th–6th century.
