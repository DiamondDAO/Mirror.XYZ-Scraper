"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"We're thrilled to announce Impossible Object's first book, *Conversations on AI*. In the grand tradition of the philosophical dialogue, the book will comprise a set of conversations between six thinkers, and will cover plenty besides Artificial Intelligence. AI will be used as a jumping-off point to discuss xenofeminism, music, terraforming, neorationalism and much more.\\n\\nThe full crowdfund will be launched in the coming days on Mirror, but for now here's the TL;DR on the project.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7ffe6b52-c97a-453c-a44d-7b81592f6d70.jpg?height=2728&width=2728)\\n\\n## Who's taking part?\\n\\nReza Negarestani, Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester and Nick Srnicek.\\n\\nThese authors have previously dealt with AI from various angles: some have written work that treats AI directly (Reza Negarestani's *Intelligence and Spirit* and Nick Srnicek's work on the political economy of AI), some engage with AI as a collaborator (Holly Herndon, Mat Dryhurst and SPAWN), while some have developed the notion of artificiality in itself as a means out of conceptual deadlock (Helen Hester and Benjamin Bratton).\\n\\n## When will these conversations happen?\\n\\nAs soon as the crowdfund is over. Once they have all taken place, they'll be transcribed, edited and published as an eBook on Mirror.\\n\\nThat's when things really start to get interesting. Before the trade paperback is published, Impossible Object will seek responses to the dialogues from the readership. One to three of these will be chosen to be published alongside the main dialogues in the first print edition of the book.\\n\\nPrinting commentaries and objections alongside the main text has a long tradition, stretching back before Descartes' *Meditations*. But with Mirror's help we're giving things a web3 twist.\\n\\n## How can I back the crowdfund?\\n\\nYou will need an Ethereum wallet to participate. If you don’t have one, I recommend Rainbow’s mobile app for those on iOS. Metamask is another good option and is available on iOS, Android, and web.\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1621365831,\"title\":\"Announcing \\\"Conversations on AI\\\"\",\"publication\":\"r\"},\"digest\":\"3V4kjJvl_wIw-GSZyyAWkGMn7u3oNegZ0riiUITkilc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xc46E9a66FDdC8D1a69529d86E668236f02957F1b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2gOreeFuSTzHTbTHh9VLYOVAbQObud6uGR8QKO8hX68\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mIcvZP41c-qLBmjZN1LVVaBuBBW6rZ4AdumfCBqht0c\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"KGQpKMjr3rtlwrVLVti1VyI1PXCgDD6LiwdKixYsbUaID_2Hm_dTVUQeFpkRP-shg1NS1LT7KVphYLubU1W1ag\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa12ba6931bea4c7bc2184de485923a78b6af767e47b5366ba29378cf7e8f474c40cd9c51f95dc6b0f445745db5e88230c78ae1e3421b36703b7d474fbda0c57f1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on r.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2gOreeFuSTzHTbTHh9VLYOVAbQObud6uGR8QKO8hX68\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mIcvZP41c-qLBmjZN1LVVaBuBBW6rZ4AdumfCBqht0c\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"A1pAa6P3Up_IOJJOQTI4ZEi-Mu4Kis_MD6SeUzVG4fY\"}"
