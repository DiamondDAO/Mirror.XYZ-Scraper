"{\"content\":{\"body\":\" \\n 1999  \\n  \\n The world began a shift from Cold War era closed networks. \\n  \\n Attention and capital flooded in to build the Internet, after the emerging and developed markets were rescued. Meanwhile, power shifted to new nodes of the world order. New powers, industries and businesses began their rise. \\n  \\n The Euro, emerges as Europe become connected by currency. \\n  \\n The Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland, former Soviet bloc members, join NATO. Boris Yeltsin, the first president of a post-USSR Russia, resigns. Prime Minister Yeltsin becomes acting president.  \\n  \\n NATO begins aerial bombing in Yugoslavia, the beginning of the end of one of the last communist era closed networks.  \\n  \\n The NATO bombing ends after an agreement for a withdrawal from Kosovo. Slobodan Milosevic and 4 others are indicted for war crimes, a peace treaty is signed. Thousands in Belgrade demand the resignation of the president of Yugoslavia. \\n  \\n The emerging markets resume their growth as new rising powers. \\n  \\n Alibaba is founded the same year new Internet cafe restrictions were imposed.  \\n China's first Shenzhou spacecraft is launched.  \\n The world's latest tallest building, Petronas, opens in Kuala Lumpur.  \\n Infosys is the first indian tech company listed on Nasdaq.  \\n There is a military coup in Pakistan. Cambodia joins ASEAN.  \\n  \\n Networks are dynamic, otherwise they break apart. \\n  \\n New nodes spin up, old ones break down.  \\n New connections light up, old ones fade out. \\n  \\n A changing of the guard, is led by a handover to new networks. \\n\\n \\n **2877 Earth, The Necklace, The Marketplace Square \\n ** \\n I kept my breathing steady and pay attention to everything. \\n  \\n “Commander, I’m here to take possession of an item that belongs to the people I work for. An agreement was made by others, and I am here to take delivery. Once I have it, I will be on my way, and you can enjoy the rest of your time here.” \\n  \\n I nod my head and drink more spring water. I don’t know if they would kept their word, and kept it peaceful. It didn’t matter.  \\n\\n”That’s not going to happen. I answer to people too. And they’re here to tell me to tell your bosses that they can’t do that.”\\n\\n  ”That would be a mistake. I ask you to reconsider. You might be here under diplomatic cover, but we have the advantage.”  \\n\\nI didn’t mention that Andreea’s family was protected by my friends.  \\n  \\n “I have the device. It’s in a safe place. The war is over thanks to the “machines”. I know you’re not alone, and you have orders.”  \\n\\n”The machines ended the war. They changed everything, including business for everyone, our competitors, us. We’re going to change with the times, including new businesses.”  \\n\\n”You don’t have to walk from this table empty-handed. Let’s make a new deal. Your people can still get an edge and stay in business, you don’t need everything on it.”\\n\\n  ”I have to say, you and the lady could have walked from this table, with your lives, including her family back home. It’s a shame.”  \\n\\nThe restaurant began to empty. The staff was missing. They must “own” this place. \\n\\nThe others start to walk towards our table. The negotiation has ended. \\n  \\n I start with the “leader”, she’s dangerous and fast.   \\n \\n\\n[https://audius.co/astro/change-112160](https://audius.co/astro/change-112160)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Rde1tQy6y_c3X8TSBqsq4.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iXUVTS8m6J8wfEUEwUpBY.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1635375485,\"title\":\"1999: 7.19 Changing Nodes, Changing Of The Guard\"},\"digest\":\"w6GKw3K5KI2WmEsrT69EVdnrxVNqV8InhFFVx0Fway8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cp69EkVmGPN56udTPoj_01QpW6eGaXZ1zbeS531jad8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zYwhIf2jaKC_Er3nNncHMRuE7eXBXlkdLz-3zM8ikGE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"0ggdjPa-7dUPg247QJW7NK0I_49H1hTaKbF_qukD_oajvyj_i1u5cqjjC0IEjXlo_Sa8_dd-u6cDi7yZsz-FsA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe4c1bcaa88b6fe2c67d195f4a76d1a91640647a2c63ec8f8083673f941e8ee412d804077222237104c51130677298bdcb163cbc3b2eb0bb6193f6b825a8e06141c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cp69EkVmGPN56udTPoj_01QpW6eGaXZ1zbeS531jad8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zYwhIf2jaKC_Er3nNncHMRuE7eXBXlkdLz-3zM8ikGE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"w6GKw3K5KI2WmEsrT69EVdnrxVNqV8InhFFVx0Fway8\"}"
