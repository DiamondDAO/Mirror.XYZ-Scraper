"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*[Head over to our governance channel on Discord](https://t.co/CAu387Zc6B?amp=1) for access to our memos on upcoming proposals we’re paying attention to, technical how-tos for participating, and any questions you have. We’re here to help.* \\n\\nOne of the biggest challenges for crypto protocols at the moment is garnering enough community engagement around new governance proposals. These proposals are the crucial stepping stones for blockchain projects to grow -- and yet too few individuals are able to participate. \\n\\nTheir lack of participation is primarily due to two factors: \\n\\n1. Too much is happening at once and people don’t know how and where to pay attention \\n2. Voting on a proposal is strangely complex and varies per project. There are a lot of hoops to jump through before you can make your voice heard. \\n\\nWe’ve now put forth two proposals that were hampered by late, or lack of, community participation. \\n\\nBut here’s the thing -- we got REALLY far. On the Sushiswap proposal, 3.3 million votes were in favor vs. 190,000 against. We participated in community calls, posted on Twitter, Sushi’s core team even promoted it all over - but we didn’t make the required quorum of 5 million votes to get the proposal through. \\n\\nTurns out only a few whales knew where to pay attention -- 2.5M of our votes in favor came from one whale. \\n\\nUltimately if we wish to fulfill the promise of enabling everyone to have equal access to influence the space, we need to truly embrace the principles of decentralization and allow a wider and more diverse group of users to participate.\\n\\nWe believe the first step towards that goal is providing greater transparency and education around the what and how of open proposals. \\n\\nOn [our Discord](https://t.co/CAu387Zc6B?amp=1), we created a governance channel where [@avimeyers](https://twitter.com/avimeyers) and [@francisgowen](https://twitter.com/francisgowen) will share our internal memos on the major upcoming proposals that we’re paying attention to, and the details you need to know in order to vote. We want to create a space for anyone to ask questions and for resources to be shared! \\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1636057140,\"title\":\"Our Commitment to Improving Governance Participation for Partner Protocols \"},\"digest\":\"q3_ukXKGmt-AM7er2-6qfDsdlHHsqbNSehbkvoxxw3Y\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xB551E3E62b14674C8dD6b0B173AC23D4e98Cb791\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Ofw7ZongNXhz6sPQBETK4eLZRWWqFVhY4SNq1UtyK_E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3JC-7H6bkUBqJA7u4-NRsw6i_vXDwXrHkX8-KuAW7zk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Kj4KGQRQCirgqrH5q_grvMwss_G7EREjj0-0rOsW-8r4yoQ_CQmsD-R3kX8ocSnhDdi6U6p8iJEisZ-s9nPPvw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb18abc6be133bb2b5f39ef4c80ceab882ef306fccd8af748f0b98dc60be3f6bd07570949057838c5a977842d08d6061a1b4f3cfa8e6cd57d21b1c3d97007b6ad1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Ofw7ZongNXhz6sPQBETK4eLZRWWqFVhY4SNq1UtyK_E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3JC-7H6bkUBqJA7u4-NRsw6i_vXDwXrHkX8-KuAW7zk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"q3_ukXKGmt-AM7er2-6qfDsdlHHsqbNSehbkvoxxw3Y\"}"
