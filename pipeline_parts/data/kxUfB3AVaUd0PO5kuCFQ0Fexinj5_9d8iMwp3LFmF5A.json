"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**[Good Vibe Hunters](https://www.instagram.com/goodvibehunters) is an adventure lifestyle brand with big ambitions to disrupt the Travel, Apparel and Event Management industries by using the power of community and the shared ownership economy.**\\n\\nThe goal here is to create a rapidly growing decentralised organisation of like minded individuals that work towards a global DAO of interlinked real world, and web3 businesses..\\n\\nImagine Co-Owning a chain of profitable Co-Working Resorts/Hostels. Being a part of new apparel or accessory product design/marketing plan and deciding where and when the next meetup or event will be. Everyone involved shares in the expansion ideas, but also share in the economic benefits!\\n\\nThis does sound very ambitious on the surface. But when broken down into bite sized pieces and baby steps coupled with a global network of different people with different talents and resources, the trajectory towards big goals is far easier than a traditional business model.\\n\\nWeb3 has created a thriving community of online avatars who have been busy creating the infrastructure for a new frontier, now it is time to turn this dream into a reality..\\n\\n### Background\\n\\nGood Vibe Hunters was created in 2014 with the idea to have community generated content from followers on instagram wearing our apparel whilst outdoors doing whatever their idea of good vibe hunting might be. It did not take long for hashtag #goodvibehunters to got from 0 to 10,000+ posts. It was very interesting to see how the sky diving community became the leading group of good vibe hunters, followed closely by SUP Yoga.. Neither of which, either of us two Aussie founders had ever done!\\n\\nUnfortunately as we were traveling Europe ourselves, we did not exactly have the stability to be processing clothing orders out of our backpacks! And such, the momentum fizzled out.\\n\\n### The Future is faster than you think..\\n\\n*We are currently in the middle of a multitude of converging technologies as well as macro economic themes that I believe are setting the scene for one of the greatest opportunities in a lifetime. Let me explain..*\\n\\n1. Web3 and DAO’s - We are all still figuring out the possibilities of what this entails. If you have zero understanding, I suggest starting with[ this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=260&v=IooTahsgXTs&feature=emb_logo&ab_channel=Upstream) explainer video. The easiest explanation I have read to explain a DAO is that they are a community of contributors with a shared vision and a secure shared bank account.\\n2. The rise of the gig economy - First Uber, then Freelancer and now Web3. People want to work when they want, ***where they want*** on what they want!\\n3. Covid-19 - The global lockdowns have created opportunities in the most pent up industry: **Travel**.. 2 Years of forced savings have 18-35 year old’s the world over ready to explore!\\n4. Struggling Countries - Some Countries have faired better than others, unfortunately some fan favorites have not done so well. But that could create opportunities to scoop up cheap digital nomad resorts/hostels.\\n\\n### Traditional Organizations VS DAOs\\n\\n![Traditional Organizations VS DAOs](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jhcLptk8YFjDZIe86tYev.png?height=742&width=1327)\\n\\n### Ok, let’s talk details!\\n\\n*GVHDAO is a token to help fund the foundations of a decentralized travel, event and apparel company. All will interlink some way in the future. I will later focus predominantly on travel and real estate, to avoid over complicating the idea.*\\n\\n**Future real world income opportunities include:**\\n\\n* *Purchase and manage a chain of co-working resorts/hostels (Start with one!) token holders share economic benefits.*\\n* Online store with community designed and managed products.\\n* Group Travel Tours, location and activities included voted by $GVHDAO holders.\\n* Community created content with advertising revenue on platforms like YouTube.\\n* Music Festival or special event, voted by token holders.\\n* Many more opportunities as the brand recognition grows.\\n\\n**Web3 income opportunities:**\\n\\n* A “Golden Ticket” NFT sale (Similar to a resort timeshare sale)*For example: 500 Golden tickets, 10 ETH each. Ticket holders receive 30 years limited accommodation and event access. This alone, could fund the first hostel purchase in a location like Indonesia.*\\n* Treasury yield farming (Attractive interest rates earn’t on funds in the treasury by using various DeFi Protocols)\\n* Other lower tier NFT’s\\n* NFT transaction fee income\\n* Metaverse Meetups and events\\n* Online reservation marketplace for buying and selling resort reservations.\\n\\n![DAO operations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VOd5_FPoAMAd68_XJwxCx.png?height=721&width=1215)\\n\\n### DAOs doing things:\\n\\n*“With decentralization, DeFi, DAOs, NFTs, and technologies we haven't even invented yet, Americans are on the verge of unlocking a better, more transparent, and more fair financial system.”* - Mike Novogratz - CEO of Galaxy Investment partners\\n\\nWe are still early in the adoption and implementation of DAO’s, but to get an idea of what the early adopters are building with DAO’s I have curated a small list of easy to understand DAO’s:\\n\\n* [Links DAO](https://linksdao.io/) is creating the modern golf & leisure club. A global community of thousands of enthusiasts has come together to create one of the world's greatest golf clubs - and reimagine the country club.\\n* [Krause House](https://krausehouse.club/) - A DAO with the mission to buy a NBA team.\\n* [$BACON](https://www.baconcoin.com/) - A new way to invest in US home loans\\n* [Lex DAO](https://www.lexdao.coop/) - Legal engineers trying to turn legal services into code\\n* There are hundreds of other Defi, Social and Web3 DAO’s\\n\\nMany of these DAO’s started as just a crazy idea from one person, but the idea quickly spread. The community got involved and investment followed. [Bit DAO](https://www.bitdao.io/) is a Web3 investment DAO that has amassed a $2.5 Billion treasury ready to deploy on the next big idea..\\n\\n### Seed Investment Round (COMING SOON)\\n\\nTo stress test the idea and put the foundational blocks in place, We are raising 20 ETH, with contributions capped at 0.25 ETH. That ensures a reasonable number of people are able to participate. Allocations are made on a first come, first serve basis. If you don’t have an Ethereum wallet, I recommend downloading[ Rainbow’s](https://rainbow.me/) mobile app (iOS only).[ Metamask](https://metamask.io/) is a good alternative.\\n\\nContributors will receive a stake in $GVHDAO, our token.\\n\\n### What do $GVHDAO holders get? (COMING SOON)\\n\\nAs this is the foundation or “seed investment” round, the risks of failed investment are at their highest. As such, a high risk should come with high reward. By backing the crowdfund, supporters receive three primary benefits if the project is a success:\\n\\n1. Profit share on all income generating operations, similar to dividends\\n2. Founders NFT with lifetime benefits. \\\\*Coming Soon\\n3. Voting rights in business decisions\\n\\nAbove all, you will be entering into the process of building this with us.\\n\\n### What happens after I back this crowdfund? (COMING SOON)\\n\\nAll proceeds of this initial crowdfund are for idea validation and to fund the expansion of the community, start building the correct governance and smart contracts. Funds will be held in a treasury to be spent on the most efficient investments to take us to the next step. Once the foundations are in place (Legal structure is correct, Website and marketing material have been designed to portray the vision to the next round of investors and contributors, marketing plan and costing analysis of potential initial project) We would vote on a second round of investment via token sale. Further down the line, the NFT contracts (similar to [Links DAO memberships](https://linksdao.io/)) would be built to help fund the actual products and building construction or renovation. The whole process is open for discussion and debate and the treasury (the shared bank account) is held securely in a multi-signature account for all investors to see on a protocol like [Gnosis-Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/).\\n\\n### Let’s break it down.\\n\\n*Ok, you may still be thinking this is still overwhelming. So let me break it down into the initial problems that come to mind and need solutions..*\\n\\n1. **How do I know if any of this is even possible?**\\n\\n   *We don’t know for sure. But there are projects like [$BACON](https://www.baconcoin.com/) who are already decentralizing home mortgages. Then there is [KrausHouse](https://krausehouse.club/) who are breaking down the questions and concerns in buying a NBA team as a DAO! Fractional ownership is taking over the world and some people think every company in the future will be a DAO, so it is not a question of “if” this is possible, it is more a question of “when” this will be possible. If you still don’t think this is possible, I encourage you to think back to when Uber first hit your town.. And watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISIjlRExdpE) to understand how they did what they did!*\\n2. **Ok, but there are many moving parts in all of this, where do you even start?**\\n\\n   *The main benefit of the fractional ownership economy is that the heavy load is shared by many people. Obviously the regulatory issues are the first thing that pops to mind. I recently discovered [Lex DAO](https://www.lexdao.coop/), a legal engineering guiled (A community full of Web3 curious Lawyers! There are many other similar communities that have all the emerging answers to how a Web3 world actually works.*\\n3. **How do I avoid being scammed or rug pulled?**\\n\\n   *SOLUTION: Total transparency is key. If we can build a solid community of contributors that understand and agree on the long game (building revenue streams and a collection of assets that have utility) coupled with the leading cyber security systems, the organization could grow exponentially. Corruption and greed is the major drag on any growing enterprise. All investment funds stay in the community treasury to be voted on how they are used and who gets compensated what for their product or service.*\\n\\n**Next Steps: (AFTER SEED ROUND)**\\n\\nAs I mentioned earlier, this initial “seed round” is to connect with and find a founding group of likeminded individuals that agree with the vision. Once we have found 10-100 people with the skills required and built a treasury, the next steps would be to:\\n\\n1. Set up and organise the Discord Chat Group\\n2. Improve the DAO Smart Contract and Treasury Management\\n3. Grow the community\\n4. Grow the traditional social media profiles\\n5. Organise 2nd Round of Funding - Proceeds used to hire the missing pieces to the puzzle!\\n6. Design the NFT’s with correct and economic use cases\\n7. Sell NFT’s\\n8. Vote on second funding round\\n9. Vote on first project (Example: Special Event, Purchase a Hostel, Shopify Products ect)\\n\\nRegister your interest and contribute to the conversation by joining the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rxjaFVft)\\n\\n### Further Reading\\n\\nTimeshare was created and marketed toward the middle aged, semi retired couples. As you can see by the screenshot below from the current website on a valuable domain [www.timeshares.com.au](https://www.timeshares.com.au) it seems there has been no improvements since the creation of the internet!\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fd311Vae6fs7LoyXMqiqD.PNG?height=866&width=1575)\\n\\nA quick Google search of “Timeshare” results in images and articles like this, warning of Timeshare scams.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jzE3mI3_ZtCT17jVe2Vkh.png?height=1309&width=700)\\n\\nThe benefit of a DAO run portfolio of properties (not to mention the other businesses that would pop up under the umbrella, like special events and festivals) with NFTs that replace timeshare ownership contracts, would be the liquidity and optionality of the NFT.\\n\\nIf the resort is fully booked out leading up to the date allocated to your week of free accommodation, you may opt to sell the accommodation in the marketplace. Rates would be dynamically adjusted like any other free market. This could even be automated to find the best rate if you know in advance you will not be using the accommodation.\\n\\nAs the NFT was sold as a pre build investment, the value of the NFT should raise in line with the value created in the building and brand recognition. Having the company run as a DAO, there should be enough interest from within the community or outside investors to easily sell the NFT with the click of a button. No lazy salesmen in the middle! The transaction costs involved would be a fraction of traditional property transactions. The minor transaction fees would benefit the DAO holders as those fees go into the treasury, used for maintenance and other value adding decisions.\\n\\nThe NFT release would come *after* the DAO token and community has been built. The NFT’s would have tiers, something like this:\\n\\n1: Founders NFT: Airdropped to the first 100 DAO investors - Benefits include 3 nights accomodation per year for the next 10 years, at every location built. Plus VIP entry into special events and meetups on and offline.\\n\\n2: 100 X Bronze tier NFT - Same as funders\\n\\n3: 100 X Silver tier NFT - 5 Night accomodation, at every location for the next 10 years\\n\\n4: 50 X Gold tier NFTs - 5 Nights accomodation, at every location for the next 20 years.\\n\\nThe people that purchase these NFTs know and understand they are helping fund the initial start up costs and as such, they would be priced accordingly. The value should increase once up and running.\\n\\n### What does it look like?\\n\\nSo as I mentioned before, timeshares are a sometimes sketchy product for Baby Boomers and above. With the momentum of remote work through applications like [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) and a young generation who are eager to explore the world. I believe there is about to be an explosion of co working resorts.\\n\\nBy getting involved, the DAO token holders would be involved in the decision making, like location and design or renovation but then also management decisions like how many beds per room, what the rates will be ect. The DAO holders would naturally become marketers to their individual circle of influence and then eventually share in the economic benefits.\\n\\nAs I mentioned earlier, DAO holders will have other benefits that I haven’t even thought about yet, and if they decide to travel and stay at a location, they will have some sort of discounted membership. The business does still need be profitable in the long run, so proper thought should be put into the initial offer of the tokens as it is difficult to completely pivot after the crowdfunding takes place.\\n\\nThe day to day operations would run as any other business, but the workers would be offered compensation or bonuses via the Token if the Token grows to accommodate enough liquidity at a somewhat stable value.\\n\\nThe value of the token would eventually become quantifiable by calculating the value of the assets, cash flow and community/brand value.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FQ4-mHSW7AB0-BHgZgnmc.jpg?height=550&width=930)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NQEqNa1nPGh_nbvDVV7xl.jpg?height=399&width=720)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ogod0c-HVpyCnyOJ1mapN.jpg?height=450&width=750)\\n\\nIf you made it this far, and want to go further down the rabbit hole of what is possible through the DAO ecosystem, here is a list of interesting and inspiring content:\\n\\n* [Most interesting DAO’s of 2021](https://decrypt.co/88894/11-most-interesting-daos-of-2021)\\n* [Full time DAO’s](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/5vTIKBRzMpVAiNyc7CnABXjh3ToJrjQOnOdkwqvb3l8)\\n* [The DAO Planning Canvis](https://mirror.xyz/abatch.eth/3cL6s_qhmc7Ka5l8vRUaiO76nulfTCMovspE9ngL-P8)\\n* [The State of DAO Tooling](https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/organization-legos-the-state-of-dao-tooling-866b6879e93e)\\n* [Cooper Turley](https://alias.co/coopahtroopa/essays)\\n\\nIf you made it this far, you might as well join in the conversation by joining the GVH DAO [Discord](https://discord.gg/rxjaFVft) Early contributors will share in any success this crazy idea may produce..\\n\\n### \",\"timestamp\":1641699081,\"title\":\"GVH DAO - Idea Validation..\"},\"digest\":\"zmKtmQBLTCp0RDzFqSWi3WJM-OuSkXfnL2F36aQa6n8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD6F067bbAB8D8b15Bd3450606bb0951E5B82Bf6B\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"iZ23FYrQ3lsFzzzqEdpgKK5VeaClp3YMUjBcAQIhOaE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"CheMvo6bOVQ48MHme_HgIUuy5URC0YZV9Clg1PxcudI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Zt2a_jUp5mS6Y3gDsBOohqmJ7p-gKKiSvORJNeyCswlNVdoApo4gupv8boH4GjE2aBgJD7-p8mcrsxQzslDcSg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x37eea53903b0fb97d86770371f00d4bf074064a19231434bae120f3783c568b95544a28d158f1854eb4d4f309a74d1fd8215833b5d5105fc9ce8b5874d75914b1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"iZ23FYrQ3lsFzzzqEdpgKK5VeaClp3YMUjBcAQIhOaE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"CheMvo6bOVQ48MHme_HgIUuy5URC0YZV9Clg1PxcudI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"a-86MKtik_WRizDj2GYpTcrCcdcd4ucx2vyCR5PX1TQ\"}"
