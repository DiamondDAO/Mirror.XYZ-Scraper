"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"April 1945 Germany\\n\\nThe Germans' V1 and V2 rockets rained destruction on England. What other threats were next? The \\\"wonder weapons\\\" the Third Reich had in store might also be the ultimate, the atomic bomb.\\n\\nAn allied secret team, \\\"Mission Alsos\\\", was sent through enemy lines to look for Werner Heisenberg. Heisenberg, a Nobel prize winner, was the head of the Third Reich's nuclear research.\\n\\n\\\"Mission Alsos\\\" was led by the man who oversaw security for the \\\"Manhattan Project\\\", America's atomic bomb effort, Colonel Boris T. Pash. He was determined to capture Heisenberg.\\n\\nIt looked like that the Allies were safe but they couldn't take a risk letting the USSR capture scientists and resources. \\\"Operation Big\\\" was activated to make sure the Allies were safe.\\n\\nThe war was ending but it was still dangerous.\\n\\nIn a cave near the town of Haigerloch, south of Heidelberg, they found a test reactor. Next, the team found another lab and captured 2 dozen scientists. They revealed in interrogation that there were files, hidden in a cesspool - a suitable hiding place for awful secrets. The team then found uranium and 'heavy water' (water from a 'heavy' isotope of hydrogen for atomic research).\\n\\nHeisenberg was on the run. Colonel Pash, risked his team, crossing over a ravine into the Bavarian Alps. He found the scientist hiding in a cabin with his family. The German scientists were exfiltrated to a safe house in England. There, Allied intelligence confirmed that there was no threat when the Germans revealed their shock that an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.\\n\\nThe war was over, the atomic age began.\\n\\n2912 MARS\\n\\n\\\"Director, this is no ordinary debriefing, this was the secrets of my family history. The things I thought I was running from, it turns out I've been running straight towards it. May I ask, \\\"Now what\\\"?\\\"\\n\\nThe classified files which bathed the conference room in unreal reality evaporated. Routine data streams took over the holos. The Director continued drinking coffee and turned off the shutters.\\n\\nJacob C. Tagore, Jr and the Director were bathed in the final blues of sunset, distant lights of transports and far away towers. The Director got up from her chair. Jacob by reflex and upbringing got up to make a respectful goodbye and wish a good evening.\\n\\n\\\"Not yet, Jacob, look. This world is home to a lot of people, like all the other worlds of the System. I swore an oath to protect the interests of this world. It seemed like we were going to be mothballed like DeepShips gathering dust all over the system.\\\"\\n\\nThe Director waved a hand at the table, \\\"Open Final Expee file.\\\"\\n\\nA map of the System blossomed over the table like a flower.\\n\\n\\\"Here are DeepShips we found, registered or classified. This was a network for an interstellar infrastructure, based on Dr. Cadmus' work. Your Uncle AL's father was building for the greatest migration of humanity. Then the Long War changed everything.\\n\\n\\\"These are nodes with command and admin privileges. Your last few missions found some pieces in a puzzle. We are assembling the private command codes and keys for these nodes. You guessed at a boarding and hijacking but didn’t know the “why”.”\\n\\n”Director, you want to use these DeepShip ‘flagships’ somehow to stop the Great Halt?” \\n\\nThe Director smiled and nodded.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T1GMyDJC-NrVpdRo4wl66.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uDpLOPilH0qVxSRZw8HVi.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633897272,\"title\":\"1961: 5.12 The Point of New Return, 2912\"},\"digest\":\"onz9Vq36dFktBV7qfmDEf_2-q0DZDua0OmQH2j0XWSc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"r0vF0RrLguQnxbJGrLlVd3e-QqyqXgdiqd4C71M1BX4S3LAi0Liz58vyzuAATpDZhwWA6M8LUCRDSmMudZSbGw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"onz9Vq36dFktBV7qfmDEf_2-q0DZDua0OmQH2j0XWSc\"}"
