"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Happy 2022 dear climate collectives, DAOs & regens!! 🥳\\n\\n \\n We hope that this year will finally put an end to this pandemic and that it will give us the opportunity to make our communities dream of a better and more sustainable future 🌈🌞\\n\\n![solarpunk artwork by http://jessicaperlstein.com](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HWDpABwPLAc8lwsZIqbVb.jpeg?height=1074&width=2354)\\n\\n﻿﻿2021 has been a crazy year All for Climate 🎉 We are now hosting [140 collectives](https://opencollective.com/allforclimate) that have raised collectively more than €500k last year. We paid back 825 expenses. We are now a community of 3,632 people and organizations that support various collectives for climate justice 💪 \\n  \\n We also [ran a marathon for the climate](https://twitter.com/leen_schelfhout/status/1449780920689516545) 🏃🏻‍♂️🏃‍♀️, [we sent brilliant young activists to the COP26](https://opencollective.com/allforclimate/updates/newsletter-live-from-the-cop26-opencop-funding-opportunity-for-your-collective-join-the-allforclimate-dao). We published the first newsletter at the intersection of climate & crypto: [The Climate Chain](https://climatechain.substack.com). We helped Frederic Laloux & Hélène Gérin [raise $100k for their new documentary series The Week](https://allforclimate.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x9f25a5E6fC859d9b6dD23d17DE83Aaef9dEA8Ddf), a new playbook for massive climate mobilization, and we organized a Twitter Space with Fred to talk about it and about how DAOs could reinvent climate movements.\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kr4hjl2VYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kr4hjl2VYE)\\n\\nIn December, we participated in a [crowdfunding campaign with Gitcoin](https://twitter.com/all4climatedao/status/1470076023630872576) which has brought [more than €630k to many different climate projects](https://twitter.com/all4climatedao/status/1483004995079479298), including a couple already part of the All for Climate community: [Jonathan’s project to plant trees in Uganda](https://gitcoin.co/grants/4014/agroforestry-climate-change-forests-and-ecosystem), [Climate Sessions that produces ecologist art & culture in Barcelona](https://gitcoin.co/grants/4012/climate-sessions), the [transformation of Berlin’s old airport](https://gitcoin.co/grants/4080/transformation-center-in-berlin-for-a-regenerativ), [a solarpunk NFT contest to reimagine the streets of Brussels](https://gitcoin.co/grants/3994/imaginebrussels-solarpunk-nft-contest), and [All for Climate](https://gitcoin.co/grants/4073/all-for-climate) itself.\\n\\n## What’s coming up in 2022?\\n\\nThe main mission of All for Climate is to address common issues shared by different movements for climate justice. It started with many of us experiencing the pain of creating a nonprofit and a bank account to receive donations to reimburse expenses, so we came together and started a common nonprofit that we now all share since 2019 🤗\\n\\nAnother common pain is how do we make our respective collectives financially sustainable. Our current economic system prefers to reward production and consumption, not activism, not community work. As a result, we have to rely on volunteers. It works for a while, but it’s not sustainable.\\n\\nThat’s why, in 2022, we will explore **how we can create a reward system to reward activists and contributors by turning All for Climate into a DAO**, a decentralised autonomous organisation. Fridays for Future, Extinction Rebellion, Transition Network and other movements are actually already decentralized autonomous organisations. The difference here is to also have a shared treasury, a shared budget, that is not only fully transparent but also owned and managed by everyone who contributes to the community. **DAOs are basically commons that reward people for their contributions to the common good**. We believe they are a big part of the “system change, not climate change” that we need.\\n\\nSharing ownership with thousands of people is not easy, but is now possible thanks to what we call web3, a decentralised version of the Internet that makes people contributors and owners of their community. We see this as an opportunity to value and reward all the work that you are already doing within the collectives.\\n\\nYou will be able to earn tokens by attending the general assemblies, uploading / approving expenses, writing updates for your collective, etc. Those tokens represent your ownership of All for Climate and will give you the opportunity to vote to collectively manage the participative budget.\\n\\nThis is work in progress and we invite you to take part in shaping it 🔅\\n\\nFor the first official DAO season of All for Climate (January-June 2022), there is a list of projects you can join, and a process to make a proposal for new projects. Team members will receive rewards in DAI (that can be exchanged to euros) and/or All for Climate tokens.\\n\\nA quick look into the projects that are starting this month and that you can join (commitment for 3 or 6 months):\\n\\n* Communication (internal / external)\\n* Rewards system (tokenize All for Climate)\\n* Education (All for Climate Academy)\\n* Art (Artists for Climate, solarpunk)\\n* Climate Directory: help people find the collectives/communities/projects where they can contribute\\n* Onboarding team: how to join the All for Climate community and start contributing?\\n* Finance team: how do we raise money and help collectives raise money?\\n* Managing the fiscal host (our common shared nonprofit)\\n\\nWant to join one of the teams, claim one of the locomotive or contributors roles, or do you want to start your own project?  \\n 👉 **Apply here:** <https://dao.allforclimate.earth/workgroups#season-1> \\n\\n**Deadline for applying is Tuesday 25/01 - 20:00 CET.**\\n\\nDefinitely join our community call on Monday 24/01 at 19:00 CET if you need more information. (<https://zoom.allforclimate.earth>)\\n\\nWe are looking forward to meeting you in the [https://discord.allforclimate.earth](https://discord.allforclimate.earth/)\\n\\nDon’t hesitate to reach out!! 🤗 \\n  \\n You can also follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/all4climatedao), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/all4climatedao) and [Facebook](https://facebook.com/allforclimate). \\n You can support the All for Climate Community by [donating euros on our open collective](https://opencollective.com/allforclimate/donate) or sending crypto to our DAO (allforclimate.eth) or via [Giveth](https://giveth.io/project/all-for-climate-dao) or [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/grants/4073/all-for-climate).
