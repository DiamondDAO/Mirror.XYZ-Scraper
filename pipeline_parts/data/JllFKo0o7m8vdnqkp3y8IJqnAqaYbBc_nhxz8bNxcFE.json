"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"This post is a broad overview of the recently emerging “Crypto Art” space, including the use of “Non-Fungible Tokens” (NFTs) as a digital art distribution mechanism.\\n\\n### Limited-Edition Tokens\\n\\nSuch *tokens*, as I’ll refer to them, can be understood as unique digital objects that can be collected and transferred from one user to another in a cryptocurrency network. Within the umbrella label of crypto art, they often represent a media file, a piece of software, or some artistic concept. These can be released to collectors in a limited capacity, with a cryptographic signature and provenance that traces directly back to the artist.\\n\\nAll of this is rather analogous to signed inkjet prints produced from digital media. For example, consider an artist selling a limited-edition run of prints which represent some digital artwork they’ve created. The artist chooses an arbitrary edition size (1, 5, 50, etc), promising not to distribute more than that, and signs each print as if to say “this object is special.” If the work is highly regarded, others may seek to purchase and own it, and perhaps the object will eventually find acquisition and stewardship in private and public collections.\\n\\n![Hatched Forms (GIF/PNG media) by artist yazid on Hic Et Nunc (https://hicetnunc.art/yazid)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pYMgWK-izZCZV4z4Tx5QI.png?height=1001&width=4001&size=large)\\n\\nYet; the object that is sought after, and has provenance built around it over many years, is not merely the media or image, but the *signed* artefact distributed by the artist in a limited capacity. For a concrete example, see Ansel Adam’s signed photographic prints, which can sell at auction for hundreds of thousands, while prints without the artist’s signature, *despite them being the same photograph*, are sold at a fraction of this cost. Jack Rusher goes into excellent detail on this in [his own essay](https://jackrusher.com/journal/what-does-it-mean-to-buy-a-gif.html) about crypto art.\\n\\n### Scarcity & Abundance\\n\\nAn interesting property of crypto art, and a common target of derision, is that collectors are acquiring artworks that are abundant on the internet, freely accessible to view and download at full resolution.\\n\\nOne might observe that the economic value of art has historically been tied to the scarcity of access to its media. Whereas crypto art presents an alternative paradigm that separates the signature (artist-signed token) from the artistic media (image, photograph, animation, concept). This allows the former to remain scarce and uniquely transferable, while the latter remains abundant and widely accessible.\\n\\n![signature and artistic media in a limited-edition token](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hCuUvkf66bJSKtX8Xscgs.png?height=1341&width=3249)\\n\\nWhile this is a polarizing paradigm, it is not exactly novel, and similar ideas exist with distributing and acquiring conceptual work, such as Sol LeWitt’s *Wall Drawings*. In these cases, what is “owned” and transferred (as acquired by collectors, museums, institutions) might simply be a signed certificate of authenticity. We could see crypto art through similar vein: the tokens being distributed and traded are not files, but more akin to artist-signed certificates of authenticity, each carrying some conceptual ties to particular media, artwork, or idea.\\n\\n![Sol LeWitt Wall Drawing #793B (1996)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/v4mNGdIAXGuykUXc4B8iT.jpg?height=994&width=2126&size=medium)\\n\\nA common remark is that crypto art is “artificially scarce”—although one could again point to limited-edition signed prints, which have properties of scarcity that are equally as artificial and arbitrary, especially if they are produced by means of an inkjet printer and authenticated with a signature in pencil. Prints can and often are forged and reproduced, sometimes in such a way that the copy becomes indistinguishable from the original (see MSCHF’s recent *[Possibly Real Copy of ‘Fairies’ by Andy Warhol](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/mschf-warhol-drawing-release-2025316)*). In contrast, duplicating a token contract, even if it were done by the artist, would produce an entirely new identifier and “hash” (string of digits and bytes), and with it a clearly distinguishable provenance and history recorded on the blockchain. Of course, this does not mean crypto art is impervious to fakes—there is *much* of it, and careful due diligence is still required. For example, compromised or poorly designed interfaces, look-alike tokens, and convincing impersonations of an artist can all lead to [regretful purchases](https://nypost.com/2021/09/01/fake-banksy-nft-sells-for-340k-then-returned-for-refund/).\\n\\n### Ownership & Property\\n\\nOne common point of confusion lies around copyright and intellectual property ownership. Much like purchasing a signed print, there is no transfer of copyright or license upon purchasing a signed token. Unless otherwise specified, the copyright and license remains property of the artist, or whomever is licensed to distribute this content. Different tokens may carry different licenses; some are effectively in the public domain [as CCO](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), others are free for [non-commercial use](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/), and others [attempt to tie copyright to the token holder](https://www.nftlicense.org/) (a license that remains untested in courts).\\n\\nIt also should go without saying, purchasing a token will not make you the “owner” of any particular *media file* that the token might represent or point to. As noted previously, this media is abundantly accessible on the web, and anybody can “Right Click Save” the file. In fact, most tokens pointing to media files will use a technology called [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), in which *the entire goal* is to have the file saved and distributed across as many computers as possible, to mitigate reliance on a central point of failure.\\n\\n![Bougainvillea, a generative artwork by gpitombo on fxhash (https://fxhash.xyz/gentk/slug/bougainvillea-29)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lJ3QesOYkY8_R4APZDLQm.jpg?height=1000&width=3101&size=large)\\n\\nPerhaps, though, a claim *could* be made around “ownership of the artwork.” This is only true if we first concede that conceptual art *can be owned*, as in the case of LeWitt’s work, and that these tokens can conceptually represent some degree of artistic significance beyond mere file pointers and digital collectibles. This is a contentious issue: many readers, artists, and collectors will balk at the idea that conceptual art can or should be owned. That most popular crypto art markets are saturated with garish apes, bears, penguins, and virtually every other animal—often without any attribution to an actual artist—has not helped this case.\\n\\nAt the very least, what is generally agreed upon is that collectors do own *the token itself*, which some might regard as a unique record in a distributed database, not unlike being the sole owner of a domain name and having the power to transfer and sell that digital property (it should be noted that some NFTs *[are](https://ens.domains/)*[ domain names](https://ens.domains/), for use specifically inside of these blockchain protocols).\\n\\n### A Novel Distribution Mechanism\\n\\nWhat all of this entails is a potential new mechanism for artists to distribute digital art, and for appreciators to acquire and collect it. Notice I am generally pointing to digital media—animations, generative art, photography, illustration, graphic design—these digital tokens are not well suited to the authentication, distribution, and transfer of physical artworks such as an oil painting or a sculpture.\\n\\nIn practice, crypto art mechanisms are radically different than other online distribution platforms, carrying a number of advantages and disadvantages. On [Hic Et Nunc](https://hicetnunc.art/), an ecosystem built atop the energy-efficient [Tezos](https://tezos.com/) blockchain, artists may pay a small fee (such as [0.06 XTZ](https://better-call.dev/mainnet/opg/ooESUkYd28hXKgsHN4YB3u9GuW3UveRpVUpU2AMawLFU7Jj1Sy7/contents) which is about $0.24 USD at the time of writing) to have their work “minted” onto the public ledger at a fixed edition size. The artist will sign the transaction with the private key of their owned crypto wallet, allowing the token to be traced back to them. Then, for each sale, the platform takes a 1% fee for its services.\\n\\nThe artist is also free to set a royalty on the token, typically between 5-25%, which allows them to be paid in perpetuity each time the token trades (and perhaps appreciates) on the platform’s secondary market. In some other marketplaces, royalties can be split across multiple beneficiaries (such as a percentage of royalties directed to a nonprofit or OSS tool).\\n\\nThis is a dramatic departure from the standards and norms that have been set in traditional art and creative markets, where galleries often take a 40-60% cut on each sale, and artists typically don’t receive any royalties at all on the secondary market. This is also far and beyond the fee structures of distribution channels like Bandcamp (14-21% fees), which has led to some artists to experiment with Hic Et Nunc as an [alternative music distribution platform](https://hen.radio/).\\n\\n### Borderless\\n\\nA significant facet of crypto art is that it is effectively *borderless*, with the obvious caveat that individuals participating in cryptocurrency networks are still bound to their country’s laws and regulations (e.g. paying taxes on crypto art income), and some countries have outlawed the use of these networks altogether. Despite this, the distributed and global nature of Hic Et Nunc and similar platforms have allowed crypto art to flourish worldwide, enabling artists and collectors to exchange art and value with a single shared currency, recorded on a single shared ledger that is not upheld by any single jurisdiction. It’s hard to measure, but some [informal polls](https://twitter.com/jagracar/status/1464298900613906436) can provide insight.\\n\\nThis unfortunately does not mean globally equitable: sales volume tends to concentrate toward artists from the west (often white male), perhaps for a range of reasons including access to hardware and education, language and technical barriers, popularity on social media, discrimination. Platforms like [Feral File](https://feralfile.com/exhibitions) take an alternative approach to these completely open markets, assigning a curator for each exhibit and highlighting a diverse range of artists and artworks, rather than amplifying the whims of a potentially biased crowd.\\n\\n![GRAPH — curated by Processing co-founder, Casey Reas (https://feralfile.com/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qgRgiI1-hny6o8aXq6kRg.jpg?height=1542&width=2992&size=medium)\\n\\n### Decentralized & Permissionless\\n\\nIt is worth noting two other unique properties of blockchains on which most crypto art is built: these networks are *decentralized* and *permissionless.* That is to say, no single actor controls the shared ledger, and any user can record transactions so long as they pay a fee. This is a double-edged sword.\\n\\nOn one hand, it can help remove reliance on centralized services and intermediaries (PayPal, Instagram, auction houses), and give users greater ownership over the assets they are distributing and collecting. This proved to be effective when Hic Et Nunc itself was shutdown by the owner/developer in a sort of rage-quit, yet the ecosystem and its assets remained largely unaffected. This was possible because the distributed assets and data was never in the owner’s possession to begin with; instead, the burden of ownership and maintenance lay on community of users (you can read more about this [here](https://mattdesl.substack.com/p/hicetnunc-and-the-merits-of-web3)).\\n\\nBenefits of decentralization can also be seen with various competing marketplaces on the same chain, such as [Objkt.com](https://objkt.com/), [Versum.xyz](https://versum.xyz/), [Fxhash.xyz](https://www.fxhash.xyz/) and others on Tezos, which all operate on the same shared ledger, many of them indexing the same tokens. This allows users to purchase a token on one market, and sell it on another if they so choose, or even trade these tokens peer-to-peer from one user to another without relying on any particular website.\\n\\nHowever, on the other edge of the sword, a system with zero moderation leads to rampant spam, illicit content, “copyminting” (plagiarism), phishing, impersonation, and other problems. Open markets like Hic Et Nunc and OpenSea are often forced to de-index and remove content that goes against their code of conduct. This would be like Google removing your website from its search results—your site is still present and functioning, but not easily discoverable. Moderation and indexing on these platforms is a massive challenge, essentially a game of whack-a-mole, leading many users to favour curated or established collections over open markets.\\n\\n### Not All Chains are Created Equal\\n\\nSo far, I’ve mostly pointed to the Tezos blockchain in this discussion, as it has a booming art community and a range of different marketplaces. This chain is energy-efficient (equivalent to any other typical network activity, like using Twitter or writing a blog post) and transaction fees are extremely low (in fractions of a dollar, sometimes fractions of a cent), making it a good centrepiece for discussions around crypto art’s potential future.\\n\\nI do not feel Tezos is a perfect blockchain, but these two points make it worth considering for crypto art until Ethereum can solve its energy and scalability issues with [Proof of Stake, sharding, and zero-knowledge rollups](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/). Determining which chain is *better* for artists is complex; for example, Ethereum has a range of well-tested algorithmic stablecoins that artists can use to mitigate short-term price volatility, and Ethereum’s markets are more developed than other chains (e.g. allowing for certain functionality that is missing or more challenging to achieve on Tezos).\\n\\nPersonally, I have been using and exploring a number of different blockchains, as they all provide different areas of study and their own pros and cons (e.g. [Mina](https://minaprotocol.com/) is in early development, and its focus on zero knowledge proofs gives it certain interesting properties and use cases).\\n\\n### Other Concerns\\n\\nIt’s also worth highlighting some of the common critiques of these systems, as they are certainly far from perfect, and can present various issues for artists:\\n\\n* **Energy:** Ethereum is currently associated with a high energy usage, steering many artists toward smaller and less-developed networks like Tezos (where energy usage is negligible). This is likely to change in 2022 with Ethereum’s migration to Proof of Stake.\\n* **Fees:** Ethereum fees can be prohibitive, sometimes hundreds of dollars to mint an artwork. This tends to push action onto alt- and side-chains like Tezos and Polygon (where fees are a fraction of a dollar). Scalability will likely improve in future versions of Ethereum, but this will take some years to fully develop and mature.\\n* **Risk:** there is an obvious element of risk, both for the artist and collector. A minted work might not sell, tokens might depreciate in value, and there are security risks associated with private key management and decentralized systems (i.e. if you accidentally share your private key online, you will likely lose all your funds).\\n* **Speculation:** the high value in many of these markets is often driven by speculation, and can sometimes lead to FOMO-buying, botting, insider trading, pump-and-dump schemes, and other problems. Some prominent “influencer” accounts in crypto art space may even be run by the same person, pumping their own bags. Given the sheer scale of these permissionless networks, it can be sometimes hard to separate the grift from the rest.\\n* **Volatility:** tokens may appreciate or depreciate in massive swings on a day-to-day basis; users are regularly encouraged to pull profits, hold stablecoins, and/or avoid holding any significant sums of crypto at all.\\n\\n### Understanding the Tech\\n\\nThe underpinnings of these ideas and technologies is quite dense, and fully grasping these systems can take weeks or months of study. I’ve written a couple of other posts on these subjects, that may help enlighten users about how these distributed networks work:\\n\\n* [Why the distributed ledger?](https://mirror.xyz/mattdesl.eth/2WNUAK_DuQsxj3Ei3CY-IlWyVb8VZzQl0mgvYj3TAjQ)\\n* [ERC-721 and the protocols underlying NFTs](https://mirror.xyz/mattdesl.eth/6C6Ppi1kUr0cfdLKmz6Na53Vh6sjsxYANcIjHpCWV_Q)\\n* [Hic Et Nunc and the Merits of Web3](https://mattdesl.substack.com/p/hicetnunc-and-the-merits-of-web3)\\n\\n### Further Reading\\n\\nFor further reading, I’ve put together a small collection of interesting essays, podcasts, and discussions [here](https://gist.github.com/mattdesl/c8164323fb91fdc92f726944937039b4).\\n\\n**\\\\[ todo - this post is still WIP \\\\]**\",\"timestamp\":1642519984,\"title\":\"on crypto art and NFTs\"},\"digest\":\"eUrK8MrRfKFJYVKTwi5F4mCIBJEBOYkZ1qaAiDNblIs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xcAb81F14A3Fc98034a05bAb30f8D0E53e978c833\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"N-SfSNusDAp9nNz7rl0LxP6_AjuqaFGe0KHJA3A9Qj4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"K2juBH4mpXaUgOFm73DhMoT67mXWT9dsw8FpYMC1LKc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ubfCSdFRF953gTc8Uox3dl7Quj-wDTFcMBfLewZ6Lzp0E79nUM_mnllkATpkuvVL6zM68J8fD3jZyx3k9SRf6w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd5bbde33792488cfb4668dfb57924256cd1c3fd4b46b4e65cdbad5b76bc6ebed7092ed67123b2209a4f4269f6dca26977da37579c1279423fd1ce5dde5c7adf500\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"N-SfSNusDAp9nNz7rl0LxP6_AjuqaFGe0KHJA3A9Qj4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"K2juBH4mpXaUgOFm73DhMoT67mXWT9dsw8FpYMC1LKc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"eUrK8MrRfKFJYVKTwi5F4mCIBJEBOYkZ1qaAiDNblIs\"}"
