"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"As The Voice Season 21 Knockout Rounds commenced Monday, Team Blake hopeful Hailey Green — a shaved-headed, tattooed, 15-year-old badass who’s the only female football player on her high school team; who originally tried out for the show when she was just 13; and who was once compared to a “cheetah” — made an especially ballsy move by covering her own coach’s “God’s Country,” transforming it into a swampy rawker right in front of him.\\n\\n“Hailey is a bold artist, so it doesn't surprise me that she chose this song, because she doesn't hit me as a type of person to really back down from anything,” declared an amazed Blake Shelton. “I've literally lost years off my life trying to get through that vocal, and listening to you sing that — holy crap,” he raved, after Hailey fearlessly roared through the tune while playing fiery electric guitar. She “filled up this room with energy” according to John Legend, giving the track a Jon Bon Jovi/“Blaze of Glory” stadium vibe.\\n\\nBut sadly, Hailey’s glory was short-lived. Unfortunately for her, her Knockouts competitor, Cameroonian chanteuse Libianca, spectacularly performed Billie Eilish's “Everything I Wanted.” And while Libianca, who has both depression and anxiety, struggled and even sobbed during rehearsal, she delivered a confident, jazzy performance that John described as a “master class” once she hit the main stage.\\n\\n“There was no way in hell I was going to let Libianca leave. I feel like she had the tallest mountain to climb, and she was able to get it together. As a coach, there's no way I can't reward that,” Blake explained. Still, Blake confessed that letting Hailey go, especially after she sang his own song, absolutely crushed his soul. “My heart's broken right now,” he lamented.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nTRENDING\\n\\n‘Genius' performance has 'DWTS' fans and judges losing their minds\\nYahoo TV·2 min read\\n\\nDave Chappelle says he's 'more than willing' to meet with transgender employees at Netflix — but there are conditions\\nYahoo Entertainment·3 min read\\n\\nOlivia Jade says she faces constant 'guilt and stress' in the wake of college admissions scandal\\nYahoo Entertainment·3 min read\\n\\nThe It List: Selena Gomez goes blonde in Season 3 of her cooking show, Guillermo del Toro-produced 'Antlers' debuts, animated 'Star Trek' series for kids premieres and the best in pop culture the week of Oct. 25, 2021\\nYahoo Entertainment·13 min read\\n\\nThe Go-Go's' Gina Schock talks photo book, Rock Hall, and open-heart surgery at age 26: 'We took that trip to Palm Springs in case I didn't make it.
