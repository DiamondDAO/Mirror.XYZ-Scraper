"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"10/10 recommend. I loved it so much I bought it after returning it to the library. **Note:** below are my thoughts and reflections -- not a summary of the book.\\n\\n## My takeaways\\n\\nRemoving *some* (really not that much) comfort from our lives can positively impact us for the better. Simple actions like ignoring reward hunger food cravings, turning down the AC a few degrees, or allowing yourself to sit in boredom can improve your mental and physical well-being.\\n\\nIt’s good to be bored, the body uses small stressors to be resilient, craft my own [misogi](https://huckberry.com/journal/posts/michael-easter-misogi), make it novel each time, and push my limits -- but do not die.\\n\\n## Quick review\\n\\nEven though the only personal limit I have pushed is how many pieces of sushi I can eat at dinner, I love reading about how I can push myself to be better.\\n\\nWe live in a world where convenience is often top-of-mind. If you saw my DoorDash history, you would see I often choose convenience. Many of us live in temperature-controlled homes. Food is available at an arm's reach. We have machines specially designed to vibrate away our body fat. Those things aren't inherently bad, nor does Easter suggest we live in an explicitly Stoic fashion. Easter does however provide a bunch of new tools we can use and leverage to add a bit of discomfort and at the same time improve ourselves.\\n\\nTurning the temperature down to the mid-60s in your bedroom can improve metabolic activity and blood sugar levels. You don't necessarily need to go full-on ice-bath mode to reap the benefits of the cold.\\n\\nThis book won't change your life overnight, but that felt like the point. The small changes have asymmetric upside. Go for a walk in nature; turn the temperature down a bit; turn the sound down; consider the transient nature of life and limited time available. Taking a stab at any of these introduces little downside, but all have significant upside.\\n\\nIf you have any interest in mental or physical well-being, pick up this book. If you want to be more conscious about the impacts of our cushy modern life, pick up this book.\\n\\n## Links\\n\\n[https://bookshop.org/books/the-comfort-crisis-embrace-discomfort-to-reclaim-your-wild-happy-healthy-self/9780593138762](https://bookshop.org/books/the-comfort-crisis-embrace-discomfort-to-reclaim-your-wild-happy-healthy-self/9780593138762)\\n\\n[https://eastermichael.com/](https://eastermichael.com/)\\n\\n[https://huckberry.com/journal/posts/michael-easter-misogi](https://huckberry.com/journal/posts/michael-easter-misogi)\\n\\n## How I felt\\n\\nIn a few words: hopeful, open, and however you would describe the desire to go out and do stuff.\\n\\n## My notes/quotes\\n\\n### On the mind\\n\\nScientists at Oregon State University found that daily stressors like lines and waits can improve our resistance to some brain diseases if we simply suffer through them and shrug them off. More of these everyday stressors are actually better for our brain.\\n\\nOur brains essentially have two modes, focused and unfocused. Focused mode is a mind at attention. It’s on when we’re processing outside information, completing a task, checking our cellphone, watching TV, listening to a podcast, having a conversation, or anything else that requires us to attend to the outside world. Unfocused mode occurs when we’re not paying attention. It’s inward mind-wandering, a rest state that restores and rebuilds the resources needed to work better and more efficiently in the focused state. Time in unfocused mode is critical to get shit done, tap into creativity, process complicated information, and more. Think of this focused state like lifting a weight, and the unfocused state like resting. When we kill boredom by burying our minds in a phone, TV, or computer, our brain is putting forth a shocking amount of effort.\\n\\n### On being outside\\n\\nJohn Muir in 1901 put it this way: “Nerve-shaken, over-civilized people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home; that wilderness is a necessity; and that mountain parks and reservations are useful not only as fountains of timber and irrigating rivers, but as fountains of life.”\\n\\n“This three-day effect she studies basically says that a few days in nature change your mind for the better,” I tell him as I rummage my pack for my down jacket. “More time in nature seems to make people calmer. More at peace, more present, more appreciative. Happier. That kind of stuff. And the effect seems to last after you leave.”\\n\\n### On fitness\\n\\nBut the Sports Medicine research team found that altitude training does far more than that. It also leads to changes in mitochondria, which make our muscles more efficient, and improves how we buffer exercise-induced acids, allowing us to go harder longer. The catch is, a person can’t just spend a weekend in the mountains and expect to emerge like a Sherpa. Prolonged, repeated bouts at altitude—mountain misogis, perhaps—lead to the most profound changes.\\n\\nMarcus Elliott told me that a critical benefit of misogi is what he called “creating impressions in your scrapbook.” “If you’re seeing and doing all the same things over and over, your scrapbook looks pretty empty when you take inventory of your life,” he said. “So we need to do more novel things to start creating more impressions in our scrapbooks, so we don’t feel like the years are flying by.\\n\\n### On diet\\n\\nLindeberg’s was a finding that’s been repeated often: People who eat a diet that focuses on whole foods experience less disease. The Tsimane people, a tribe in Bolivia, eat rice, plantains, tubers, and corn; meat and fish that they themselves hunt and pull from streams; fruit; and the occasional wild nuts. They register the healthiest hearts ever recorded, according to a global team of scientists. The chronic-disease-free Hadza, in Tanzania, eat mostly wild tubers, fruits, and meats. These general rules also apply to modern industrial societies that eat fewer higher-density foods.\\n\\nGrehlin, the hunger chemical, also has a habit of spurting out when our stomach is full. Particularly when delicious, calorie-dense foods are around. This is reward hunger without real hunger: a drive to eat when we don’t actually need food. This hunger is why we can have a big dinner, feel full, but then see dessert and suddenly have room for more.\\n\\nLindeberg’s was a finding that’s been repeated often: People who eat a diet that focuses on whole foods experience less disease.

I checked the options on their website and found some designed for winter mountaineering excursions. One pair was rated warm down to -40 degrees Fahrenheit. The price was nearly $400. When I brought this up with my wife, she replied, “Well, how much would you pay to keep your toes?” More than $400. So the boots went into the cart.\",\"timestamp\":1640796655,\"title\":\"Quick Book Review: The Comfort Crisis\"},\"digest\":\"7dLVz1dvEo46kmdLuttKqzSeg1HFqpewQZQ4hNDz0Vw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xFF48d93EE8790B3906C4FECb26A08846Ab0e1109\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"W3jqGVZCPzi3EhicFNc2DFEk3txoG90xwt9x8ie9q1s\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"VvvX7MK1y3gAtDBspu6zUO4BkbV_7y3C0LTiKBfD_xo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"48wXdYw6MrSsl1q0QLj2o9qybMUNuojcbWluRfqdTvZJSoo-fwbsBpYvXZeSb_Rvs3SA_4xtNKKimNYFLuEuBw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1b58620be1a0ba4052f6ebb65725183222278ed165ad8ad3fce24bde3f237cb85e5f0bebea64b500fd09132f1ae4f7835a648103b400961d4f4fbc13ebc94e0a1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"W3jqGVZCPzi3EhicFNc2DFEk3txoG90xwt9x8ie9q1s\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"VvvX7MK1y3gAtDBspu6zUO4BkbV_7y3C0LTiKBfD_xo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"CJ5H69oHuEBqZVwF0So98Og34Y5vZ_2L6VH6nheHhBk\"}"
