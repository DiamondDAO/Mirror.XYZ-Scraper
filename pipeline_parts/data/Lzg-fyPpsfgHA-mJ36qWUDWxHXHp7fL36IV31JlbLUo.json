We work with **independent** bars who nurture their venue’s vibe. **Chains** **are lame.**\\n\\n![Happy participants outside an excellent independent bar in Cologne](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IRxqMZ010wAcKzkYh8hiY.png?height=605&width=908)\\n\\nIt seems there are dozens of perfect venues in your city, but as you look closer, it becomes clear that finding that truly compatible match takes love and patience.\\n\\n### Invite your friends\\n\\nAs part of **[Decentralise Mundo Lingo](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/Bz8plTeNzVaYGOvJ7utPNUn41k6G4HSh3fnhOxzWjb8)** we recommend making this as much a public affair as possible. You can do so by sharing this guide, the venue onboarding form via [mundolingo.org/join](https://mundolingo.org/join) and the City Map (see below) so that members can add their own venues.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZIZDPBnluEw3_BO7r8EBL.png?height=600&width=600)\\n\\n## Strategy\\n\\nEverybody knows that language schools, universities and big train stations are in the centre of the city as they are in every city around the world. However, the aim is open 3, 4 or more weekly events in your city. To open 1 event in the centre of a mega-city is incredibly short-sighted.\\n\\n**Ask yourself**; if you were to open 5 events in your city tomorrow, where would they be?\\n**And then, read this:**\\n\\n**Why the CBD / Centre, will only waste your time**\\n\\n1. High Prices\\n2. Bars are already busy - They don’t need us\\n3. Full of office workers in suits. Suits kill vibe\\n4. Bars with no character\\n5. Only generic penny-pinching airport-style chain bars survive.\\n6. People working/studying in the centre go home at 5pm. After taking an hour to get home and change, they wont come back to the centre.\\n\\n### The Fringe\\n\\nWhere cool bars hang out. These bars are friendly and cultivate their community in order to survive,  just like us! **Independents** are often run by open-minded owners rather than the corporate office policies of **chains**. The fringe has trendy bars, sweet vibes, lower prices, less suits and more authentic smiles.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DRRunSL2TrpnaVqsEAell.png?height=800&width=800)\\n\\n### Your City Map\\n\\nA City Map is provided (please don’t create a new one). Use the City Map to mark businesses (bars, hostels and language schools) and take notes on them. If you can’t find your City Map, ask your Lead.\\n\\n![Bars in Bangkok marked green, yellow and red (Traffic Light System)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4gu4q8WH2hYpPdfNbQ6Gj.png?height=444&width=655)\\n\\n### 100 Venues\\n\\nMark every potential venue you can find in your city. If your city has over 2 million people you should get 100 venues.\\n\\n### Traffic Light System\\n\\nCheck reviews, photos, social media and mark each one down on your City Map as **Red or Yellow** according to its candidacy.\\n\\n```\\nRed \\t –  Fail\\nYellow \\t –  Possible Candidate, will research or visit.\\nGreen\\t –  Criteria confirmed by in-person visit\\n```\\n\\n### Brute Force\\n\\nAdd all the bars you can find as yellow! Next, go through those yellows and check their social media and photos. if you see that they fail, mark them as red.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s-U4oat20vwmM-ZwiOXdu.png?height=428&width=816)\\n\\n### Dig Deep\\n\\nIf all you can find are chains or unsuitable bars, dig deeper. Google independent articles and blogs on bars in your city.\\n\\nThe following search terms are examples to help find spacious bars:\\n\\n`Hidden Gems in [City]`\\n`Hipster hang outs [City]`\\n`Arty bars [City]`\\n`Unique bars [City]`\\n`Bars to dance swing [City]`\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IUq88nereCFpMEyIN5ipD.png?height=493&width=930)\\n\\n## Visiting Time\\n\\nAt this point, your map should have lots of red and yellow markers. Let’s turn those yellows into greens.\\n\\n### You need\\n\\n• Your City Map open on your phone  \\n • ‘Add Venue’ form ready on your phone (4th option on the [join page](https://mundolingo.org/join))  \\n • Grab a friend (or victim) \\n • A notepad or note taking app\\n\\n![You can plan a route on your custom Google Map](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QcmZvMeu76bg4uMUOXHS_.png?height=768&width=1366)\\n\\nHave a drink in each venue preferably on a Monday to Thursday night. Be prepared to spread the search over 2 or even 3 weeks. If you planned a route, follow it with GPS on your smartphone.\\n\\n**Don’t** … tell the venue staff you’re from ML. Just scout the place out and absorb the ambience as an anonymous customer.\\n\\n### How is it? \\n\\nIf first impressions are good, continue to:\\n\\n1. **Buy a drink** – How’s the service?\\n2. **Talk with your friend** – Can you hear each other comfortably?\\n3. **Go to the bathroom** – Are they clean?\\n4. **Look at the food** – does it look nice? Take a photo of the menu!\\n\\n### Winner? \\n\\n1) Fill out the Add Venue form (4th option on the [join page](https://mundolingo.org/join)).  \\n 2) Take a video to share with your Leaders Assembly on Telegram\\n\\n### Loser / Maybe?\\n\\nIf this venue fails, write it down so you can update the details on the map.\\n\\n1. Presentation of Finalists\\n   We need:\\n2. \\n\\nAll venues should have notes:\\n• Links to website / social media.\\n• Link to photos of the target space\\n• If target space is different from public space, clarify this.\\n• For extra easy processing, record a video as you visit the venue\\n• Your personal experience of the venue and its ambience\\n• Capacity, price range, closing time, distinguishing factors.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nxy2wywTkjAIWpF044Kt3.png?height=533&width=697)\\n\\n**Submit |**\\nUse the form “Venue Presentation” to present your finalists. If you don’t have the form, please ask.\\n\\n**Get those Green Lights!**\\nFirst we check you have enough venues. If you don’t, we look for potential venues you may have missed. If we find one, we ask you to keep searching.\\n\\nThen we discuss with you the bars you’ve picked and help you identify anything that may become an issue later. If the bar meets full criteria, we mark it with a tick as seen here.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/q1puHaprJ6lOkKpz5ZM_t.png?height=309&width=401)\\n\\nThose ticks are ‘green lights’. You now have total liberty to enter into negotiations with the venues and even confirm launch dates.
