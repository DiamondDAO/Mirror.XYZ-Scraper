"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Pontellier go and sit with them over at the house till Mr. Robert went away.  Edna returned answer that she had already undressed, that she did not feel quite well, but perhaps she would go over to the house later.  She started to dress again, and got as far advanced as to remove her peignoir.  But changing her mind once more she resumed the peignoir, and went outside and sat down before her door.  She was overheated and irritable, and fanned herself energetically for a while.  Madame Ratignolle came down to discover what was the matter.\\n\\n\\\"All that noise and confusion at the table must have upset me,\\\" replied Edna, \\\"and moreover, I hate shocks and surprises. The idea of Robert starting off in such a ridiculously sudden and dramatic way!  As if it were a matter of life and death! Never saying a word about it all morning when he was with me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" agreed Madame Ratignolle.  \\\"I think it was showing us all--you especially--very little consideration.  It wouldn't have surprised me in any of the others; those Lebruns are all given to heroics.  But I must say I should never have expected such a thing from Robert.  Are you not coming down?  Come on, dear; it doesn't look friendly.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said Edna, a little sullenly.  \\\"I can't go to the trouble of dressing again; I don't feel like it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You needn't dress; you look all right; fasten a belt around your waist.  Just look at me!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" persisted Edna; \\\"but you go on.  Madame Lebrun might be offended if we both stayed away.\\\"\\n\\nMadame Ratignolle kissed Edna good-night, and went away, being in truth rather desirous of joining in the general and animated conversation which was still in progress concerning Mexico and the Mexicans.\\n\\nSomewhat later Robert came up, carrying his hand-bag.\\n\\n\\\"Aren't you feeling well?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, well enough.  Are you going right away?\\\"\\n\\nHe lit a match and looked at his watch.  \\\"In twenty minutes,\\\" he said.  The sudden and brief flare of the match emphasized the darkness for a while.  He sat down upon a stool which the children had left out on the porch.\\n\\n\\\"Get a chair,\\\"  said Edna.\\n\\n\\\"This will do,\\\" he replied.  He put on his soft hat and nervously took it off again, and wiping his face with his handkerchief, complained of the heat.\\n\\n\\\"Take the fan,\\\" said Edna, offering it to him.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no!  Thank you.  It does no good; you have to stop fanning some time, and feel all the more uncomfortable afterward.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's one of the ridiculous things which men always say.  I have never known one to speak otherwise of fanning.  How long will you be gone?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Forever, perhaps.  I don't know.  It depends upon a good many things.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, in case it shouldn't be forever, how long will it be?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This seems to me perfectly preposterous and uncalled for.  I don't like it.  I don't understand your motive for silence and mystery, never saying a word to me about it this morning.\\\" He remained silent, not offering to defend himself.  He only said, after a moment:\\n\\n\\\"Don't part from me in any ill humor.  I never knew you to be out of patience with me before.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't want to part in any ill humor,\\\" she said.  \\\"But can't you understand?  I've grown used to seeing you, to having you with me all the time, and your action seems unfriendly, even unkind. You don't even offer an excuse for it.  Why, I was planning to be together, thinking of how pleasant it would be to see you in the city next winter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So was I,\\\" he blurted.  \\\"Perhaps that's the--\\\" He stood up suddenly and held out his hand.  \\\"Good-by, my dear Mrs. Pontellier; good-by.  You won't--I hope you won't completely forget me.\\\" She clung to his hand, striving to detain him.\\n\\n\\\"Write to me when you get there, won't you, Robert?\\\" she entreated.\\n\\n\\\"I will, thank you.  Good-by.\\\"\\n\\nHow unlike Robert!  The merest acquaintance would have said something more emphatic than \\\"I will, thank you; good-by,\\\" to such a request.\\n\\nHe had evidently already taken leave of the people over at the house, for he descended the steps and went to join Beaudelet, who was out there with an oar across his shoulder waiting for Robert. They walked away in the darkness.  She could only hear Beaudelet's voice; Robert had apparently not even spoken a word of greeting to his companion.\\n\\nEdna bit her handkerchief convulsively, striving to hold back and to hide, even from herself as she would have hidden from another, the emotion which was troubling--tearing--her.  Her eyes were brimming with tears.\\n\\nFor the first time she recognized the symptoms of infatuation which she had felt incipiently as a child, as a girl in her earliest teens, and later as a young woman.  The recognition did not lessen the reality, the poignancy of the revelation by any suggestion or promise of instability.  The past was nothing to her; offered no lesson which she was willing to heed.  The future was a mystery which she never attempted to penetrate.  The present alone was significant; was hers, to torture her as it was doing then with the biting conviction that she had lost that which she had held, that she had been denied that which her impassioned, newly awakened being demanded.\\n\\nXVI\\n\\n\\\"Do you miss your friend greatly?\\\" asked Mademoiselle Reisz one morning as she came creeping up behind Edna, who had just left her cottage on her way to the beach.  She spent much of her time in the water since she had acquired finally the art of swimming.  As their stay at Grand Isle drew near its close, she felt that she could not give too much time to a diversion which afforded her the only real pleasurable moments that she knew.  When Mademoiselle Reisz came and touched her upon the shoulder and spoke to her, the woman seemed to echo the thought which was ever in Edna's mind; or, better, the feeling which constantly possessed her.\\n\\nRobert's going had some way taken the brightness, the color, the meaning out of everything.  The conditions of her life were in no way changed, but her whole existence was dulled, like a faded garment which seems to be no longer worth wearing.  She sought him everywhere--in others whom she induced to talk about him.  She went up in the mornings to Madame Lebrun's room, braving the clatter of the old sewing-machine.  She sat there and chatted at intervals as Robert had done.  She gazed around the room at the pictures and photographs hanging upon the wall, and discovered in some corner an old family album, which she examined with the keenest interest, appealing to Madame Lebrun for enlightenment concerning the many figures and faces which she discovered between its pages.\\n\\nThere was a picture of Madame Lebrun with Robert as a baby, seated in her lap, a round-faced infant with a fist in his mouth. The eyes alone in the baby suggested the man.  And that was he also in kilts, at the age of five, wearing long curls and holding a whip in his hand.  It made Edna laugh, and she laughed, too, at the portrait in his first long trousers; while another interested her, taken when he left for college, looking thin, long-faced, with eyes full of fire, ambition and great intentions.  But there was no recent picture, none which suggested the Robert who had gone away five days ago, leaving a void and wilderness behind him.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Robert stopped having his pictures taken when he had to pay for them himself!  He found wiser use for his money, he says,\\\" explained Madame Lebrun.  She had a letter from him, written before he left New Orleans.  Edna wished to see the letter, and Madame Lebrun told her to look for it either on the table or the dresser, or perhaps it was on the mantelpiece.\\n\\nThe letter was on the bookshelf.  It possessed the greatest interest and attraction for Edna; the envelope, its size and shape, the post-mark, the handwriting.  She examined every detail of the outside before opening it.  There were only a few lines, setting forth that he would leave the city that afternoon, that he had packed his trunk in good shape, that he was well, and sent her his love and begged to be affectionately remembered to all.  There was no special message to Edna except a postscript saying that if Mrs. Pontellier desired to finish the book which he had been reading to her, his mother would find it in his room, among other books there on the table.  Edna experienced a pang of jealousy because he had written to his mother rather than to her.\\n\\nEvery one seemed to take for granted that she missed him. Even her husband, when he came down the Saturday following Robert's departure, expressed regret that he had gone.\\n\\n\\\"How do you get on without him, Edna?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\\"It's very dull without him,\\\" she admitted.  Mr. Pontellier had seen Robert in the city, and Edna asked him a dozen questions or more.  Where had they met?  On Carondelet Street, in the morning. They had gone \\\"in\\\" and had a drink and a cigar together.  What had they talked about?  Chiefly about his prospects in Mexico, which Mr. Pontellier thought were promising.  How did he look?  How did he seem--grave, or gay, or how?  Quite cheerful, and wholly taken up with the idea of his trip, which Mr. Pontellier found altogether natural in a young fellow about to seek fortune and adventure in a strange, queer country.\\n\\nEdna tapped her foot impatiently, and wondered why the children persisted in playing in the sun when they might be under the trees.  She went down and led them out of the sun, scolding the quadroon for not being more attentive.\\n\\nIt did not strike her as in the least grotesque that she should be making of Robert the object of conversation and leading her husband to speak of him.  The sentiment which she entertained for Robert in no way resembled that which she felt for her husband, or had ever felt, or ever expected to feel.  She had all her life long been accustomed to harbor thoughts and emotions which never voiced themselves.  They had never taken the form of struggles. They belonged to her and were her own, and she entertained the conviction that she had a right to them and that they concerned no one but herself.  Edna had once told Madame Ratignolle that she would never sacrifice herself for her children, or for any one. Then had followed a rather heated argument; the two women did not appear to understand each other or to be talking the same language. Edna tried to appease her friend, to explain.\\n\\n\\\"I would give up the unessential; I would give my money, I would give my life for my children; but I wouldn't give myself.  I can't make it more clear; it's only something which I am beginning to comprehend, which is revealing itself to me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know what you would call the essential, or what you mean by the unessential,\\\" said Madame Ratignolle, cheerfully; \\\"but a woman who would give her life for her children could do no more than that--your Bible tells you so.  I'm sure I couldn't do more than that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes you could!\\\" laughed Edna.\\n\\nShe was not surprised at Mademoiselle Reisz's question the morning that lady, following her to the beach, tapped her on the shoulder and asked if she did not greatly miss her young friend.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, good morning, Mademoiselle; is it you?  Why, of course I miss Robert.  Are you going down to bathe?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why should I go down to bathe at the very end of the season when I haven't been in the surf all summer,\\\" replied the woman, disagreeably.\\n\\n\\\"I beg your pardon,\\\" offered Edna, in some embarrassment, for she should have remembered that Mademoiselle Reisz's avoidance of the water had furnished a theme for much pleasantry.  Some among them thought it was on account of her false hair, or the dread of getting the violets wet, while others attributed it to the natural aversion for water sometimes believed to accompany the artistic temperament.  Mademoiselle offered Edna some chocolates in a paper bag, which she took from her pocket, by way of showing that she bore no ill feeling.  She habitually ate chocolates for their sustaining quality; they contained much nutriment in small compass, she said.  They saved her from starvation, as Madame Lebrun's table was utterly impossible; and no one save so impertinent a woman as Madame Lebrun could think of offering such food to people and requiring them to pay for it.\\n\\n\\\"She must feel very lonely without her son,\\\" said Edna, desiring to change the subject.  \\\"Her favorite son, too.  It must have been quite hard to let him go.\\\"\\n\\nMademoiselle laughed maliciously.\\n\\n\\\"Her favorite son!  Oh, dear!  Who could have been imposing such a tale upon you?  Aline Lebrun lives for Victor, and for Victor alone.  She has spoiled him into the worthless creature he is.  She worships him and the ground he walks on.  Robert is very well in a way, to give up all the money he can earn to the family, and keep the barest pittance for himself.  Favorite son, indeed!  I miss the poor fellow myself, my dear.  I liked to see him and to hear him about the place the only Lebrun who is worth a pinch of salt. He comes to see me often in the city.  I like to play to him.  That Victor!  hanging would be too good for him. It's a wonder Robert hasn't beaten him to death long ago.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I thought he had great patience with his brother,\\\" offered Edna, glad to be talking about Robert, no matter what was said.\\n\\n\\\"Oh! he thrashed him well enough a year or two ago,\\\" said Mademoiselle.  \\\"It was about a Spanish girl, whom Victor considered that he had some sort of claim upon.  He met Robert one day talking to the girl, or walking with her, or bathing with her, or carrying her basket--I don't remember what;--and he became so insulting and abusive that Robert gave him a thrashing on the spot that has kept him comparatively in order for a good while.  It's about time he was getting another.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Was her name Mariequita?\\\" asked Edna.\\n\\n\\\"Mariequita--yes, that was it; Mariequita.  I had forgotten. Oh, she's a sly one, and a bad one, that Mariequita!\\\"\\n\\nEdna looked down at Mademoiselle Reisz and wondered how she could have listened to her venom so long.  For some reason she felt depressed, almost unhappy.  She had not intended to go into the water; but she donned her bathing suit, and left Mademoiselle alone, seated under the shade of the children's tent.  The water was growing cooler as the season advanced.  Edna plunged and swam about with an abandon that thrilled and invigorated her.  She remained a long time in the water, half hoping that Mademoiselle Reisz would not wait for her.\\n\\nBut Mademoiselle waited.  She was very amiable during the walk back, and raved much over Edna's appearance in her bathing suit. She talked about music.  She hoped that Edna would go to see her in the city, and wrote her address with the stub of a pencil on a piece of card which she found in her pocket.\\n\\n\\\"When do you leave?\\\" asked Edna.\\n\\n\\\"Next Monday; and you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The following week,\\\" answered Edna, adding, \\\"It has been a pleasant summer, hasn't it, Mademoiselle?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" agreed Mademoiselle Reisz, with a shrug, \\\"rather pleasant, if it hadn't been for the mosquitoes and the Farival twins.\\\"\\n\\nXVII\\n\\nThe Pontelliers possessed a very charming home on Esplanade Street in New Orleans.  It was a large, double cottage, with a broad front veranda, whose round, fluted columns supported the sloping roof.  The house was painted a dazzling white; the outside shutters, or jalousies, were green.  In the yard, which was kept scrupulously neat, were flowers and plants of every description which flourishes in South Louisiana.  Within doors the appointments were perfect after the conventional type.  The softest carpets and rugs covered the floors; rich and tasteful draperies hung at doors and windows.  There were paintings, selected with judgment and discrimination, upon the walls.  The cut glass, the silver, the heavy damask which daily appeared upon the table were the envy of many women whose husbands were less generous than Mr. Pontellier.\\n\\nMr. Pontellier was very fond of walking about his house examining its various appointments and details, to see that nothing was amiss.  He greatly valued his possessions, chiefly because they were his, and derived genuine pleasure from contemplating a painting, a statuette, a rare lace curtain--no matter what--after he had bought it and placed it among his household gods.\\n\\nOn Tuesday afternoons--Tuesday being Mrs. Pontellier's reception day--there was a constant stream of callers--women who came in carriages or in the street cars, or walked when the air was soft and distance permitted.  A light-colored mulatto boy, in dress coat and bearing a diminutive silver tray for the reception of cards, admitted them.  A maid, in white fluted cap, offered the callers liqueur, coffee, or chocolate, as they might desire.  Mrs. Pontellier, attired in a handsome reception gown, remained in the drawing-room the entire afternoon receiving her visitors.  Men sometimes called in the evening with their wives.\\n\\nThis had been the programme which Mrs. Pontellier had religiously followed since her marriage, six years before.  Certain evenings during the week she and her husband attended the opera or sometimes the play.\\n\\nMr. Pontellier left his home in the mornings between nine and ten o'clock, and rarely returned before half-past six or seven in the evening--dinner being served at half-past seven.\\n\\nHe and his wife seated themselves at table one Tuesday evening, a few weeks after their return from Grand Isle.  They were alone together.  The boys were being put to bed; the patter of their bare, escaping feet could be heard occasionally, as well as the pursuing voice of the quadroon, lifted in mild protest and entreaty.  Mrs. Pontellier did not wear her usual Tuesday reception gown; she was in ordinary house dress.  Mr. Pontellier, who was observant about such things, noticed it, as he served the soup and handed it to the boy in waiting.\\n\\n\\\"Tired out, Edna?  Whom did you have?  Many callers?\\\" he asked. He tasted his soup and began to season it with pepper, salt, vinegar, mustard--everything within reach.\\n\\n\\\"There were a good many,\\\" replied Edna, who was eating her soup with evident satisfaction.  \\\"I found their cards when I got home; I was out.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Out!\\\" exclaimed her husband, with something like genuine consternation in his voice as he laid down the vinegar cruet and looked at her through his glasses.  \\\"Why, what could have taken you out on Tuesday?  What did you have to do?\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1639988660,\"title\":\"\\nThe little black girl came in to say that Madame Lebrun would like to have Mrs. \"},\"digest\":\"3a87ivolfM2zFsa1W9D1HQT1xvC0oSze8xpdd4iL62Q\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x025bE40F20d6f0f04d76fE7Ad916e5d61bc4D69f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"YCaPiTLnBWFOaiW-ZsbMfxWXzN9JUi6NriblZBeH-Vc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2vJkFt8vbrmkFe6HpuufPlsPPDnL3Mfz8eyZbzAwljI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"8QOys9Ihb4UBxr_mcdgjPEQ--7XOzjEWTXx5CPcmTGlZ2LZAlsfO7AQXTQbQUuLDH34ktUIA3n7IynVONc1Skw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9eec66eea089c4b6d621a1323c31f40fe3814b8db4e3bee05ba67921a60375c96f4515b19c5e8f4cc2ba9c384a4eaec3ab738a45f25c8f037578a6a8749d31551c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"YCaPiTLnBWFOaiW-ZsbMfxWXzN9JUi6NriblZBeH-Vc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2vJkFt8vbrmkFe6HpuufPlsPPDnL3Mfz8eyZbzAwljI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"3a87ivolfM2zFsa1W9D1HQT1xvC0oSze8xpdd4iL62Q\"}"
