"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The saw cut directly down into the brain, severing the superior longitudinal sinus, besides tearing a branch of the meningeal artery. The wound was filled with sawdust left by the saw while it was tearing through the parts. After ordinary treatment the man recovered.\\n\\nBird reports a compound comminuted fracture of the left temporal region, with loss of bone, together with six drams of brain-substance, which, however, was followed by recovery. Tagert gives an instance of compound depressed fracture of the skull, with loss of brain-substance, in which recovery was effected without operative interference. Ballou, Bartlett, Buckner, Capon, Carmichael, Corban, Maunder and many others, cite instances of cranial fracture and loss of brain-substance, with subsequent recovery. Halsted reports the history of a boy of seventeen, who, while out fowling, had the breech-pin of a shot-gun blown out, the sharp point striking the forehead in the frontal suture, crushing the os frontis, destroying 1 3/4 inches of the longitudinal sinus, and causing severe hemorrhage from both the longitudinal and frontal sinuses. The pin was pulled out by the boy, who washed his own face, and lay down; he soon became semi-comatose, in which condition he remained for some days; but, after operation, he made complete recovery.\\n\\nLoss of Brain-substance from Cerebral Tumor.--Koser is accredited with reporting results of a postmortem held on a young man of twenty who suffered from a cerebral tumor of considerable duration. It was stated that, although there was a cavity in the brain at least five inches in length, the patient, almost up to the time of death, was possessed of the senses of touch, taste, hearing, and smell, showed considerable control over his locomotor muscles, and could talk. In fact, he was practically discommoded in no other way than by loss of vision, caused by pressure on the optic centers. It was also stated that the retention of memory was remarkable, and, up to within two weeks of his death, the patient was able to memorize poems. The amount of involvement discovered postmortem in cases similar to the preceding is astonishing. At a recent pathologic display in London several remarkable specimens were shown.\\n\\nExtensive Fractures of the Skull. Jennings mentions an instance of extensive fracture of the skull, 14 pieces of the cranium being found. The patient lived five weeks and two days after the injury, the immediate cause of death being edema of the lungs. His language was incoherent and full of oaths. Belloste, in his \\\"Hospital Surgeon,\\\" states that he had under has care a most dreadful case of a girl of eleven or twelve years, who received 18 or 19 cutlass wounds of the head, each so violent as to chip out pieces of bone; but, notwithstanding her severe injuries, she made recovery. At the Emergency Hospital in Washington, D.C., there was received a negress with at least six gaping wounds of the head, in some cases denuding the periosteum and cutting the cranium. During a debauch the night before she had been engaged in a quarrel with a negro with whom she lived, and was struck by him several times on the head with an axe. She lay all night unconscious, and was discovered the next morning with her hair and clothes and the floor on which she lay drenched with blood. The ambulance was summoned to take her to the morgue, but on the arrival of the police it was seen that feeble signs of life still existed. On admission to the hospital she was semi-comatose, almost pulseless, cold, and exhibiting all the signs of extreme hemorrhage and shock. Her head was cleaned up, but her condition would not permit of any other treatment than a corrosive-sublimate compress and a bandage of Scultetus. She was taken to the hospital ward, where warmth and stimulants were applied, after which she completely reacted. She progressed so well that it was not deemed advisable to remove the head-bandage until the fourth day, when it was seen that the wounds had almost entirely healed and suppuration was virtually absent. The patient rapidly and completely recovered, and her neighbors, on her return home, could hardly believe that she was the same woman whom, a few days before, they were preparing to take to the morgue.\\n\\nA serious injury, which is not at all infrequent, is that caused by diving into shallow water, or into a bath from which water has been withdrawn. Curran mentions a British officer in India who, being overheated, stopped at a station bath in which the previous night he had had a plunge, and without examining, took a violent \\\"header\\\" into the tank, confidently expecting to strike from eight to ten feet of water. He dashed his head against the concrete bottom 12 feet below (the water two hours previously having been withdrawn) and crushed his brain and skull into an indistinguishable mass.\\n\\nThere are many cases on record in which an injury, particularly a gunshot wound of the skull, though showing no external wound, has caused death by producing a fracture of the internal table of the cranium. Pare gives details of the case of a nobleman whose head was guarded by a helmet and who was struck by a ball, leaving no external sign of injury, but it was subsequently found that there was an internal fracture of the cranium. Tulpius and Scultetus are among the older writers reporting somewhat similar instances, and there are several analogous cases reported as having occurred during the War of the Rebellion. Boling reports a case in which the internal table was splintered to a much greater extent than the external.\\n\\nFracture of the base of the skull is ordinarily spoken of as a fatal injury, reported instances of recovery being extremely rare, but Battle, in a paper on this subject, has collected numerous statistics of nonfatal fracture of the base of the brain, viz.:--\\n\\n```\\n                               Male.

MacCormac reports a case of a boy of nine who was run over by a carriage drawn by a pair of horses. He suffered fracture of the base of the skull, of the bones of the face, and of the left ulna, and although suppuration at the points of fracture ensued, followed by an optic neuritis, an ultimate recovery was effected. Ball, an Irish surgeon, has collected several instances in which the base of the skull has been driven in and the condyle of the jaw impacted in the opening by force transmitted through the lower maxilla.\\n\\nThe tolerance of foreign bodies in the brain is most marvelous. In the ancient chronicles of Koenigsberg there is recorded the history of a man who for fourteen years carried in his head a piece of iron as large as his finger. After its long lodgment, during which the subject was little discommoded, it finally came out by the palatine arch. There is also an old record of a ball lodging near the sella turcica for over a year, the patient dying suddenly of an entirely different accident. Fabricius Hildanus relates the history of an injury, in which, without causing any uncomfortable symptoms, a ball rested between the skull and dura for six months.\\n\\nAmatus Lusitanus speaks of a drunken courtesan who was wounded in a fray with a long, sharp-pointed knife which was driven into the head. No apparent injury resulted, and death from fever took place eight years after the reception of the injury. On opening the head a large piece of knife was found between the skull and dura. It is said that Benedictus mentions a Greek who was wounded, at the siege of Colchis, in the right temple by a dart and taken captive by the Turks; he lived for twenty years in slavery, the wound having completely healed. Obtaining his liberty, he came to Sidon, and five years after, as he was washing his face, he was seized by a violent fit of sneezing, and discharged from one of his nostrils a piece of the dart having an iron point of considerable length.\\n\\nIn about 1884 there died in the Vienna Hospital a bookbinder of forty- five, who had always passed as an intelligent man, but who had at irregular intervals suffered from epileptic convulsions. An iron nail covered with rust was discovered in his brain; from the history of his life and from the appearances of the nail it had evidently been lodged in the cerebrum since childhood.\\n\\nSlee mentions a case in which, after the death of a man from septic peritonitis following a bullet-wound of the intestines, he found postmortem a knife-blade 5/16 inch in width projecting into the brain to the depth of one inch. The blade was ensheathed in a strong fibrous capsule 1/2 inch thick, and the adjacent brain-structure was apparently normal. The blade was black and corroded, and had evidently passed between the sutures during boyhood as there was no depression or displacement of the cranial bones. The weapon had broken off just on a level with the skull, and had remained in situ until the time of death without causing any indicative symptoms. Slee does not state the man's age, but remarks that he was a married man and a father at the time of his death, and had enjoyed the best of health up to the time he was shot in the abdomen. Callaghan, quoted in Erichsen's \\\"Surgery,\\\" remarks that he knew of an officer who lived seven years with a portion of a gun-breech weighing three ounces lodged in his brain.\\n\\nLawson mentions the impaction of a portion of a breech of a gun in the forehead of a man for twelve years, with subsequent removal and recovery. Waldon speaks of a similar case in which a fragment of the breech weighing three ounces penetrated the cranium, and was lodged in the brain for two months previous to the death of the patient.\\n\\nHuppert tells of the lodgment of a slate-pencil three inches long in the brain during lifetime, death ultimately being caused by a slight head-injury. Larry mentions a person who for some time carried a six ounce ball in the brain and ultimately recovered. Peter removed a musket-ball from the frontal sinus after six years' lodgment, with successful issue. Mastin has given an instance in which the blade of a pen-knife remained in the brain six months, recovery following its removal. Camden reports a case in which a ball received in a gunshot wound of the brain remained in situ for thirteen years; Cronyn mentions a similar case in which a bullet rested in the brain for eight years. Doyle successfully removed an ounce Minie ball from the brain after a fifteen years' lodgment.\\n\\nPipe-stems, wires, shot, and other foreign bodies, are from time to time recorded as remaining in the brain for some time. Wharton has compiled elaborate statistics on this subject, commenting on 316 cases in which foreign bodies were lodged in the brain, and furnishing all the necessary information to persons interested in this subject.\\n\\nInjuries of the nose, with marked deformity, are in a measure combated by devices invented for restoring the missing portions of the injured member. Taliacotius, the distinguished Italian surgeon of the sixteenth century, devised an operation which now bears his name, and consists in fashioning a nose from the fleshy tissues of the arm. The arm is approximated to the head and held in this position by an apparatus or system of bandages for about ten days, at which time it is supposed that it can be severed, and further trimming and paring of the nose is then practiced. A column is subsequently made from the upper lip. In the olden days there was a timorous legend representing Taliacotius making noses for his patients from the gluteal regions of other persons, which statement, needless to say, is not founded on fact. Various modifications and improvements on the a Talicotian method have been made; but in recent years the Indian method, introduced by Carpue into England in 1816, is generally preferred. Syme of Edinburgh, Wood, and Ollier have devised methods of restoring the nose, which bear their names.\\n\\nOhmann-Dumesnil reports a case of rhinophyma in a man of seventy-two, an alcoholic, who was originally affected with acne rosacea, on whom he performed a most successful operation for restoration. The accompanying illustration shows the original deformity--a growth weighing two pounds--and also pictures the appearance shortly after the operation. This case is illustrative of the possibilities of plastic surgery in the hands of a skilful and ingenious operator.\\n\\nAbout 1892 Dr. J. P. Parker then of Kansas City, Mo., restored the missing bridge of a patient's nose by laying the sunken part open in two long flaps, denuding the distal extremity of the little finger of the patient's right hand of nail, flesh, tendons, etc., and binding it into the wound of the nose until firm union had taken place. The finger was then amputated at the second joint and the plastic operation completed, with a result pleasing both to patient and operator.\\n\\nThere is a case quoted of a young man who, when first seen by his medical attendant, had all the soft parts of the nose gone, except one-third of the left ala and a thin flap of the septum which was lying on the upper lip. The missing member was ferreted out and cleansed, and after an hour's separation sutured on. The nostrils were daily syringed with a corrosive sublimate solution, and on the tenth day the dressing was removed; the nose was found active and well, with the single exception of a triangular notch on the right side, which was too greatly bruised by the violence of the blow to recover. When we consider the varicosity of this organ we can readily believe the possibility of the foregoing facts, and there is little doubt that more precaution in suturing severed portions of the nose would render the operation of nose making a very rare one.\\n\\nMaxwell mentions a curious case of attempted suicide in which the ball, passing through the palatine process of the superior maxillary bone, crushing the vomer to the extent of its own diameter, fell back through the right nostril into the pharynx, was swallowed, and discharged from the anus.\",\"timestamp\":1639718840,\"title\":\"\\nThere is the record of a curious brain-injury in a man of twenty-two, who was struck on the skull by a circular saw. \"},\"digest\":\"kmUtGyIWPQeLI5DQra5NSMwJz1-aF-2c682IlaAsIu4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xBD49781Dd387395918Bf70f33643d6b0BDC2f41E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"UN2NKZTNnCM8hHKwukDjSpFT1glHz6caB7VTey5bRsQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NWOj8wk6Z2cBpNs9BFbDbU1qJeqfcniUcWe5goyuOr8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"gIhBoju_utAZCdkjoDvxIsStAy5pL94CO9sZS7EWAmk7H9jFE8vMA-qyCIoS_4EI9PzEq-G_oNwsHWdhJGDcFQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x727c95ff05ada08888b8b8ac73738b2b6efde35cd247650c06be0947b0ac79801b21426fc2b084f667b31d79c7a31eac9ba31a6fb1d43dbd1b4fb6099d26486b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"UN2NKZTNnCM8hHKwukDjSpFT1glHz6caB7VTey5bRsQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NWOj8wk6Z2cBpNs9BFbDbU1qJeqfcniUcWe5goyuOr8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"kmUtGyIWPQeLI5DQra5NSMwJz1-aF-2c682IlaAsIu4\"}"
