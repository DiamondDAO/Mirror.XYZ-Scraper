"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"paradise.  For pleasantness the human heart is like those famous royal parks of Nineveh and Babylon that sprang up in after days as if to recover and restore the Garden of Eden that had been lost to those eastern lands.  But even Adam's own paradise was but a poor outside imitation in earth and water, in flowers and fruits, of the far better paradise God had planted within him.  Take another Mystic at this point upon paradise.  'My dear man,' exclaims Jacob Behmen, 'the Garden of Eden is not paradise, neither does Moses say so.  Paradise is the divine joy, and that was in their own hearts so long as they stood in the love of God.  Paradise is the divine and angelical joy, pure love, pure joy, pure gladness, in which there is no fear, no misery, and no death.  Which paradise neither death nor the devil can touch.  And yet it has no stone wall around it; only a great gulf which no man or angel can cross but by that new birth of which Christ spoke to Nicodemus.  Reason asks, Where is paradise to be found?  Is it far off or near?  Is it in this world or is it above the stars?  Where is that desirable native country where there is no death?  Beloved, there is nothing nearer you at this moment than paradise, if you incline that way.  God beckons you back into paradise at this moment, and calls you by name to come.  Come, He says, and be one of My paradise children. In paradise,' the Teutonic Philosopher goes on, 'there is nothing but hearty love, a meek and a gentle love; a most friendly and most courteous discourse:  a gracious, amiable, and blessed society, where the one is always glad to see the other, and to honour the other.  They know of no malice in paradise, no cunning, no subtlety, and no sly deceit.  But the fruits of the Spirit of God are common among them in paradise, and one may make use of all the good things of paradise without causing disfavour, or hatred, or envy, for there is no contrary affection there, but all hearts there are knit together in love.  In paradise they love one another, and rejoice in the beauty, loveliness, and gladness of one another.  No one esteems or accounts himself more excellent than another in paradise; but every one has great joy in another, and rejoices in another's fair beauty, whence their love to one another continually increases, so that they lead one another by the hand, and so friendly kiss one another.'  Thus the blessed Behmen saw paradise and had it in his heart as he sat over his hammer and lapstone in his solitary stall.  For of such as Jacob Behmen and John Bunyan is the kingdom of heaven, and all such saintly souls have paradise restored again and improved upon in their own hearts.\\n\\n1. And for largeness a place so copious as to contain all the world.  Over against the word 'copious' Bunyan hangs for a key, Ecclesiastes third and eleventh; and under it Miss Peacock adds this as a note--'Copious, spacious.  Old French, copieux; Latin, copiosus, plentiful.'  The human heart, as we have already read to- night, is the highest, greatest, strongest, and noblest part of human nature.  And so it is.  Fearfully and wonderfully made as is the whole of human nature, that fear and that wonder surpass themselves in the spaciousness and the copiousness of the human heart.  For what is it that the human heart has not space for, and to spare?  After the whole world is received home into a human heart, there is room, and, indeed, hunger, for another world, and after that for still another.  The sun is--I forget how many times bigger than our whole world, and yet we can open our heart and take down the sun into it, and shut him out again and restore him to his immeasurable distances in the heavens, and all in the twinkling of an eye.  As for instance.  As I wrote these lines I read a report of a lecture by Sir Robert Ball in which that distinguished astronomer discoursed on recent solar discoveries.  A globe of coal, Sir Robert said, as big as our earth, and all set ablaze at the same moment, would not give out so much heat to the worlds around as the sun gives out in a thousandth part of a second. Well, as I read that, and ere ever I was aware what was going on, my heart had opened over my newspaper, and the sun had swept down from the sky, and had rushed into my heart, and before I knew where I was the cry had escaped my lips, 'Great and marvellous are Thy works, Lord God Almighty!  Who shall not fear Thee and glorify thy name?'  And then this reflection as suddenly came to me:  How good it is to be at peace with God, and to be able and willing to say, My Father!  That the whole of the surging and flaming sun was actually down in my straitened and hampered heart at that idle moment over my paper is scientifically demonstrable; for only that which is in the heart of a man can kindle the passions that are in the heart of that man; and nothing is more sure to me than that the great passions of fear and love, wonder and rapture were at that moment at a burning point within me.  There is a passage well on in the Holy War, which for terror and for horror, and at the same time for truth and for power, equals anything either in Dante or in Milton.  Lucifer has stood up at the council board to second the scheme of Beelzebub.  'Yes,' he said, amid the plaudits of his fellow-princes--'Yes, I swear it.  Let us fill Mansoul full with our abundance.  Let us make of this castle, as they vainly call it, a warehouse, as the name is in some of their cities above.  For if we can only get Mansoul to fill herself full with much goods she is henceforth ours.  My peers,' he said, 'you all know His parable of how unblessed riches choke the word; and, again, we know what happens when the hearts of men are overcharged with surfeiting and with drunkenness.  Let us give them all that, then, to their heart's desire.'  This advice of Lucifer, our history tells us, was highly applauded in hell, and ever since it has proved their masterpiece to choke Mansoul with the fulness of this world, and to surfeit the heart with the good things thereof.  But, my brethren, you will outwit hell herself and all her counsellors and all her machinations, if, out of all the riches, pleasures, cares, and possessions, that both heaven and earth and hell can heap into your heart, those riches, pleasures, cares, and possessions but produce corresponding passions and affections towards God and man.  Only let fear, and love, and thankfulness, and helpfulness be kindled and fed to all their fulness in your heart, and all the world and all that it contains will only leave the more room in your boundless heart for God and for your brother.  All that God has made, or could make with all His counsel and all His power laid out, will not fill your boundless and bottomless heart.  He must come down and come into your boundless and bottomless heart Himself.  Himself:  your Father, your Redeemer, and your Sanctifier and Comforter also.  Let the whole universe try to fill your heart, O man of God, and after it all we shall hear you singing in famine and in loneliness the doleful ditty:\\n\\n'O come to my heart, Lord Jesus, There is room in my heart for Thee.\\n\\n1. 'Madame,' said a holy solitary to Madame Guyon in her misery-- 'Madame, you are disappointed and perplexed because you seek without what you have within.  Accustom yourself to seek for God in your own heart and you will always find Him there.'  From that hour that gifted woman was a Mystic.  The secret of the interior life flashed upon her in a moment.  She had been starving in the midst of fulness; God was near and not far off; the kingdom of heaven was within her.  The love of God from that hour took possession of her soul with an inexpressible happiness.  Prayer, which had before been so difficult, was now delightful and indispensable; hours passed away like moments:  she could scarcely cease from praying. Her domestic trials seemed great to her no longer; her inward joy consumed like a fire the reluctance, the murmur, and the sorrow, which all had their birth in herself.  A spirit of comforting peace, a sense of rejoicing possession, pervaded all her days.  God was continually with her, and she seemed continually yielded up to God.  'Madame,' said the solitary, 'you seek without for what you have within.'  Where do you seek for God when you pray, my brethren?  To what place do you direct your eyes?  Is it to the roof of your closet?  Is it to the east end of your consecrated chapel?  Is it to that wooden table in the east end of your chapel? Or, passing out of all houses made with hands and consecrated with holy oil, do you lift up your eyes to the skies where the sun and the moon and the stars dwell alone?  'What a folly!' exclaims Theophilus, in the golden dialogue, 'for no way is the true way to God but by the way of our own heart.  God is nowhere else to be found.  And the heart itself cannot find Him but by its own love of Him, faith in Him, dependence upon Him, resignation to Him, and expectation of all from Him.'  'You have quite carried your point with me,' answered Theogenes after he had heard all that Theophilus had to say.  'The God of meekness, of patience, and of love is henceforth the one God of my heart.  It is now the one bent and desire of my soul to seek for all my salvation in and through the merits and mediation of the meek, humble, patient, resigned, suffering Lamb of God, who alone has power to bring forth the blessed birth of those heavenly virtues in my soul.  What a comfort it is to think that this Lamb of God, Son of the Father, Light of the World; this Glory of heaven and this Joy of angels is as near to us, is as truly in the midst of us, as He is in the midst of heaven.  And that not a thought, look, or desire of our heart that presses toward Him, longing to catch one small spark of His heavenly nature, but is as sure a way of finding Him, as the woman's way was who was healed of her deadly disease by longing to touch but the border of His garment.'\\n\\nTo sum up.  'There is reared up in the midst of Mansoul a most famous and stately palace:  for strength, it may be called a castle; for pleasantness, a paradise; and for largeness, a place so copious as to contain all the world.  This palace the King intends but for Himself alone, and not another with Him, and He commits the keeping of that palace day and night to the men of the town.'\\n\\nCHAPTER VI--MY LORD WILLBEWILL\\n\\n* 'to will is present with me.'--Paul\\n\\nThere is a large and a learned literature on the subject of the will.  There is a philosophical and a theological, and there is a religious and an experimental literature on the will.  Jonathan Edwards's well-known work stands out conspicuously at the head of the philosophical and theological literature on the will, while our own Thomas Boston's Fourfold State is a very able and impressive treatise on the more practical and experimental side of the same subject.  The Westminster Confession of Faith devotes one of its very best chapters to the teaching of the word of God on the will of man, and the Shorter Catechism touches on the same subject in Effectual Calling.  Outstanding philosophical and theological schools have been formed around the will, and both able and learned and earnest men have taken opposite sides on the subject of the will under the party names of Necessitarians and Libertarians. This is not the time, nor am I the man, to discuss such abstruse subjects; but those students who wish to master this great matter of the will, so far as it can be mastered in books, are recommended to begin with Dr. William Cunningham's works, and then to go on from them to a treatise that will reward all their talent and all their enterprise, Jonathan Edwards's perfect masterpiece.\\n\\n1. But, to come to my Lord Willbewill, one of the gentry of the famous town of Mansoul:- well, this Lord Willbewill was as high- born as any man in Mansoul, and was as much a freeholder as any of them were, if not more.  Besides, if I remember my tale aright, he had some privileges peculiar to himself in that famous town.  Now, together with these, he was a man of great strength, resolution, and courage; nor in his occasion could any turn him away.  But whether he was too proud of his high estate, privileges, and strength, or what (but sure it was through pride of something), he scorns now to be a slave in Mansoul, as his own proud word is, so that now, next to Diabolus himself, who but my Lord Willbewill in all that town?  Nor could anything now be done but at his beck and good pleasure throughout that town.  Indeed, it will not out of my thoughts what a desperate fellow this Willbewill was when full power was put into his hand.  All which--how this apostate prince lost power and got it again, and lost it and got it again--the interested and curious reader will find set forth with great fulness and clearness in many powerful pages of the Holy War.\\n\\nJohn Bunyan was as hard put to it to get the right name for this head of the gentry of Mansoul as Paul was to get the right name for sin in the seventh of the Romans.  In that profoundest and intensest of all his profound and intense passages, the apostle has occasion to seek about for some expression, some epithet, some adjective, as we say, to apply to sin so as to help him to bring out to his Roman readers something of the malignity, deadliness, and unspeakable evil of sin as he had sin living and working in himself.  But all the resources of the Greek language, that most resourceful of languages, utterly failed Paul for his pressing purpose.  And thus it is that, as if in scorn of the feebleness and futility of that boasted tongue, he tramples its grammars and its dictionaries under his feet, and makes new and unheard-of words and combinations of words on the spot for himself and for his subject. He heaps up a hyperbole the like of which no orator or rhetorician of Greece or Rome had ever needed or had ever imagined before.  He takes sin, and he makes a name for sin out of itself.  The only way to describe sin, he feels, the only way to characterise sin, the only way to aggravate sin, is just to call it sin; sinful sin; 'sin by the commandment became exceeding sinful.'  And, in like manner, John Bunyan, who has only his own mother tongue to work with, in his straits to get a proper name for this terrible fellow who was next to Diabolus himself, cannot find a proud enough name for him but just by giving him his own name, and then doubling it.  Add will to will, multiply will by will, and multiply it again, and after you have done all you are no nearer to a proper name for that apostate, who, for pride, and insolence, and headstrongness, in one word, for wilfulness, is next to Diabolus himself.  But as Willbewill, if he is to be named and described at all, is best named and described by his own naked name; so Bunyan is always best illustrated out of his own works.  And I turn accordingly to the Heavenly Footman for an excellent illustration of the wilfulness of the will both in a good man and in a bad; as, thus:  'Your self- willed people, nobody knows what to do with them.  We use to say, He will have his own will, do all we can.  If a man be willing, then any argument shall be matter of encouragement; but if unwilling, then any argument shall give discouragement.  The saints of old, they being willing and resolved for heaven, what could stop them?  Could fire and fagot, sword or halter, dungeons, whips, bears, bulls, lions, cruel rackings, stonings, starvings, nakedness?  So willing had they been made in the day of His power. And see, on the other side, the children of the devil, because they are not willing, how many shifts and starting-holes they will have! I have married a wife; I have a farm; I shall offend my landlord; I shall lose my trade; I shall be mocked and scoffed at, and therefore I cannot come.  But, alas! the thing is, they are not willing.  For, were they once soundly willing, these, and a thousand things such as these, would hold them no faster than the cords held Samson when he broke them like flax.  I tell you the will is all.  The Lord give thee a will, then, and courage of heart.'\\n\\n1. Let that, then, suffice for this man's name and nature, and let us look at him now when his name and his nature have both become evil; that is to say, when Willbewill has become Illwill.  You can imagine; no, you cannot imagine unless you already know, how evil, and how set upon evil, Illwill was.  His whole mind, we are told, now stood bending itself to evil.  Nay, so set was he now upon sheer evil that he would act it of his own accord, and without any instigation at all from Diabolus.  And that went on till he was looked on in the city as next in wickedness to very Diabolus himself.  Parable apart, my ill-willed brethren, our ill-will has made us very fiends in human shape.  What a fall, what a fate, what a curse it is to be possessed of a devil of ill-will!  Who can put proper words on it after Paul had to confess himself silent before it?  Who can utter the diabolical nature, the depth and the secrecy, the subtlety and the spirituality, the range and the reach-out of an ill-will?  Our hearts are full of ill-will at those we meet and shake hands with every day.  At men also we have never seen, and who are totally ignorant even of our existence.  Over a thousand miles we dart our viperous hearts at innocent men.  At great statesmen we have ill-will, and at small; at great churchmen and at small; at great authors and at small; at great, and famous, and successful men in all lines of life; for it is enough for ill- will that another man be praised, and well-paid, and prosperous, and then placed in our eye.  No amount of suffering will satiate ill-will; the very grave has no seal against it.  And, now and then, you have it thrust upon you that other men have the same devil in them as deeply and as actively as he is in you.  You will suddenly run across a man on the street.  His face was shining with some praise he had just had spoken to him, or with some recognition he had just received from some great one; or with some good news for himself he had just heard, before he caught sight of you.  But the light suddenly dies on his face, and darkness comes up out of his heart at his sudden glimpse of you.  What is the matter? you ask yourself as he scowls past you.  What have you done so to darken any man's heart to you?  And as you stumble on in the sickening cloud he has left behind him, you suddenly recollect that you were once compelled to vote against that man on a public question:  on some question of home franchise, or foreign war, or church government, or city business; or perchance, a family has left his shop to do business in yours, or his church to worship God in yours, or such like.  It will be a certain relief to you to recollect such things.  But with it all there will be a shame and a humiliation and a deep inward pain that will escape into a cry of prayer for him and for yourself and for all such sinners on the same street.  If you do not find an escape from your sharp resentment in ejaculatory prayer and in a heart-cleansing great good-will, your heart, before you are a hundred steps on, will be as black with ill-will as his is.  But that must not again be. Would you hate or strike back at a blind man who stumbled and fell against you on the street?  Would you retaliate at a maniac who gnashed his teeth and shook his fist at you on his way past you to the madhouse?  Or at a corpse being carried past you that had been too long without burial?  And shall you retaliate on a miserable man driven mad with diabolical passion?  Or at a poor sinner whose heart is as rotten as the grave?  Ill-will is abroad in our learned and religious city at all hours of the day and night.  He glares at us under the sun by day, and under the street lamps at night.  We suddenly feel his baleful eye on us as we thoughtlessly pass under his overlooking windows:  it will be a side street and an unfrequented, where you will not be ashamed and shocked and pained at heart to meet him.  Public men; much purchased and much praised men; rich and prosperous men; men high in talent and in place; and, indeed, all manner of men,--walk abroad in this life softly.  Keep out of sight.  Take the side streets, and return home quickly.  You have no idea what an offence and what a snare you are to men you know, and to men you do not know.  If you are a public man, and if your name is much in men's mouths, then the place you hold, the prices and the praises you get, do not give you one-tenth of the pleasure that they give a thousand other men pain.  Men you never heard of, and who would not know you if they met you, gnaw their hearts at the mere mention of your name.  Desire, then, to be unknown, as A Kempis says.  O teach me to love to be concealed, prays Jeremy Taylor.  Be ambitious to be unknown, Archbishop Leighton also instructs us.  And the great Fenelon took Ama nesciri for his crest and for his motto.  No wonder that an apostle cried out under the agony and the shame of ill-will.  No wonder that to kill it in the hearts of men the Son of God died under it on the cross.  And no wonder that all the gates of hell are wide open, day and night, for there is no day there, to receive home all those who will entertain ill-will in their hearts, and all the gates of heaven shut close to keep all ill-will for ever out.\\n2. But, bad enough as all that is, the half has not been told, and never will be told in this life.  Butler has a passage that has long stumbled me, and it stumbles me the more the longer I live and study him and observe myself.  'Resentment,' he says, in a very deep and a very serious passage--'Resentment being out of the case, there is not, properly speaking, any such thing as direct ill-will in one man towards another.'  Well, great and undisputed as Butler's authority is in all these matters, at the same time he would be the first to admit and to assert that a man's inward experience transcends all outward authority.  Well, I am filled with shame and pain and repentance and remorse to have to say it, but my experience carries me right in the teeth of Butler's doctrine.  I have dutifully tried to look at Butler's inviting and exonerating doctrine in all possible lights, and from all possible points of view, in the anxious wish to prove it true; but I dare not say that I have succeeded.  The truth for thee--my heart would continually call to me--the best truth for thee is in me, and not in any Butler!  And when looking as closely as I can at my own heart in the matter of ill-will, what do I find--and what will you find?  You will find that after subtracting all that can in any proper sense come under the head of real resentment, and in cases where real resentment is out of the question; in cases where you have received no injury, no neglect, no contempt, no anything whatsoever of that kind, you will find that there are men innocent of all that to you, yet men to whom you entertain feelings, animosities, antipathies, that can be called by no other name than that of ill-will.  Look within and see.  Watch within and see.  And I am sure you will come to subscribe with me to the humbling and heart-breaking truth, that, even where there is no resentment, and no other explanation, excuse, or palliation of that kind, yet that festering, secret, malignant ill-will is working in the bottom of your heart.  If you doubt that, if you deny that, if all that kind of self-observation and self-sentencing is new to you, then observe yourself, say, for one week, and report at the end of it whether or no you have had feelings and thoughts and wishes in your secret heart toward men who never in any way hurt you, which can only be truthfully described as pure ill-will; that is to say, you have not felt and thought and wished toward them as you would have them, and all men, feel and think and wish toward you.\\n3. 'To will is present with me, but how to perform I find not,' says the apostle; and again, 'Ye cannot do the things that ye would.'  Or, as Dante has it,\\n\\n'The power which wills Bears not supreme control; laughter and tears Follow so closely on the passion prompts them, They wait not for the motion of the will In natures most sincere.'\\n\\nNow, just here lies a deep distinction that has not been enough taken account of by our popular, or even by our more profound, spiritual writers.  The will is often regenerate and right; the will often bends, as Bunyan has it, to that which is good; but behind the will and beneath the will the heart is still full of passions, affections, inclinations, dispositions that are evil; instinctively, impulsively, involuntarily evil, even 'in natures most sincere.'  And hence arises a conflict, a combat, a death- grip, an agony, a hell on earth, that every regenerate and advancing soul of man is full of His will is right.  If his will is wrong; if he chooses evil; then there is no mystery in the matter so far as he is concerned.  He is a bad man, and he is so intentionally and deliberately and of set purpose; and it is a rule in divine truth that 'wilfulness in sinning is the measure of our sinfulness.'  But his will is right.  To will is present with him. He is every day like Thomas Boston one Sabbath-day:  'Though I cannot be free of sin, God Himself knows that He would be welcome to make havoc of my sins and to make me holy.  I know no lust that I would not be content to part with to-night.  My will, bound hand and foot, I desire to lay at His feet.'  Now, is it not as clear as noonday that in the case of such a man as Boston his mind is one thing and his heart another?  Is it not plain that he has both a good-will and an ill-will within him?  A will that immediately and resolutely chooses for God, and for truth, and for righteousness, and for love; and another law in his members warring against that law of his mind?  'Before conversion,' says Thomas Shepard, 'the main wound of a man is in his will.  And then, after conversion, though his will is changed, yet, ex infirmitate, there are many things that he cannot do, so strong is the remnant of malignity that is still in his heart.  Let him get Christ to help him here.' In all that ye see your calling, my brethren.\\n\\n1. 'Now, if I do that I would not,' adds the apostle, extricating himself and giving himself fair-play and his simple due among all his misery and self-accusation--'Now, if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.'  Or, again, as William Law has it:  'All our natural evil ceases to be our own evil as soon as our will turns away from it.  Our natural evil then changes its nature and loses all its poison and death, and becomes an holy cross on which we die to self and this life and enter the kingdom of heaven.'  My dear brethren, tell me, is your sin your cross?  Is your sinfulness your cross?  Is the evil that is ever present with you your holy cross?  For, every other cross beside sin is a cross of straw, a cross of feathers, a paste-board and a painted cross, and not a real and genuine cross at all.  The wood and the nails and the spear all taken together were not our Lord's real cross.  His real cross was sin; our sin laid on His hands, and on His heart, and on His imagination, and on His conscience, till it was all but His very own sin.  Our sin was so fearfully and wonderfully laid upon Christ that He was as good as a sinner Himself under it.  So much so that all the nails and all the spears, all the thirst and all the darkness that His body and His soul could hold were as nothing beside the sin that was laid upon Him.  And so it is with us; with as many of us as are His true disciples.  Our sin is our cross; not our actual transgressions, any more than His; but our inward sinfulness.  And not the sinfulness of our will; that is no real cross to any man; but the sinfulness of our hearts against our will, and beneath our will, and behind our will.  And this is such a cross that if Christ had something in His cross that we have not, then we have something in ours that He had not.  He made many sad and sore Psalms His own; but even if He had lived on earth to read the seventh of the Romans, He could not have made it His own.  His true people are beyond Him here.  The disciple is above his Master here.  The Master had His own cross, and it was a sufficient cross; but we can challenge Him to come down and look and say if He ever saw a cross like our cross.  He was made a curse.  He was hanged on the tree. He bore our sins in His own body on the tree.  But his people are beyond Him in the real agony and crucifixion of sin.  For He never in Gethsemane or on Calvary either cried as Paul once cried, and as you and I cry every day--To will is present with me!  But the good that I would I do not!  And, oh! the body of this death!\\n2. Now, if any total stranger to all that shall ask me:  What good there is in all that? and, Why I so labour in such a world of unaccustomed and unpleasant things as that?  I have many answers to his censure.  For example, and first, I labour and will continue to labour more and more in this world of things, and less and less in any other world, because here we begin to see things as they are-- the deepest things of God and of man, that is.  Also, because I have the precept, and the example, and the experience of God's greatest and best saints before me here.  Because, also, our full and true salvation begins here, goes on here, and ends here. Because, also, teaching these things and learning these things will infallibly make us the humblest of men, the most contrite, the most self-despising, the most prayerful, and the most patient, meek, and loving of men.  And, students, I labour in this because this is science; because this is the first in order and the most fruitful of all the sciences, if not the noblest and the most glorious of all the sciences.  There is all that good for us in this subject of the will and the heart, and whole worlds of good lie away out beyond this subject that eye hath not seen nor ear heard.\\n\\nCHAPTER VII--SELF-LOVE\\n\\n'This know, that men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, unthankful, without natural affection, truce- breakers, false accusers, traitors, heady, high-minded:  from all such turn away.'--Paul.\\n\\n'Pray, sir, said Academicus, tell me more plainly just what this self of ours actually is.  Self, replied Theophilus, is hell, it is the devil, it is darkness, pain, and disquiet.  It is the one and only enemy of Christ.  It is the great antichrist.  It is the scarlet whore, it is the fiery dragon, it is the old serpent that is mentioned in the Revelation of St John.  You rather terrify me than instruct me by this description, said Academicus.  It is indeed a very frightful matter, returned Theophilus; for it contains everything that man has to dread and to hate, to resist and to avoid.  Yet be assured, my friend, that, careless and merry as this world is, every man that is born into this world has all those enemies to overcome within himself; and every man, till he is in the way of regeneration, is more or less governed by those enemies.  No hell in any remote place, no devil that is separate from you, no darkness or pain that is not within you, no antichrist either at Rome or in England, no furious beast, no fiery dragon, without you or apart from you, can do you any real hurt.  It is your own hell, your own devil, your own beast, your own antichrist, your own dragon that lives in your own heart's blood that alone can hurt you.  Die to this self, to this inward nature, and then all outward enemies are overcome.  Live to this self, and then, when this life is out, all that is within you, and all that is without you, will be nothing else but a mere seeing and feeling this hell, serpent, beast, and fiery dragon.  But, said Theogenes, a third party who stood by, I would, if I could, more perfectly understand the precise nature of self, or what it is that makes it to be so full of evil and misery.  To whom Theophilus turned and replied: Covetousness, envy, pride, and wrath are the four elements of self. And hence it is that the whole life of self can be nothing else but a plague and torment of covetousness, envy, pride, and wrath, all of which is precisely sinful nature, self, or hell.  Whilst man lives, indeed, among the vanities of time, his covetousness, his envy, his pride, and his wrath, may be in a tolerable state, and may help him to a mixture of peace and trouble; they may have their gratifications as well as their torments.  But when death has put an end to the vanity of all earthly cheats, the soul that is not born again of the supernatural Word and Spirit of God must find itself unavoidably devoured by itself, shut up in its own insatiable, unchangeable, self-tormenting covetousness, envy, pride, and wrath.  O Theogenes! that I had power from God to take those dreadful scales off men's eyes that hinder them from seeing and feeling the infinite importance of this most certain truth! God give a blessing, Theophilus, to your good prayer.  And then let me tell you that you have quite satisfied my question about the nature of self.  I shall never forget it, nor can I ever possibly after this have any doubt about the truth of it.'\\n\\n1. 'All my theology,' said an old friend of mine to me not long ago--'all my theology is out of Thomas Goodwin to the Ephesians.' Well, I find Thomas Goodwin saying in that great book that self is the very quintessence of original sin; and, again, he says, study self-love for a thousand years and it is the top and the bottom of original sin; self is the sin that dwelleth in us and that doth most easily beset us.  Now, that is just what Academicus and Theophilus and Theogenes have been saying to us in their own powerful way in their incomparable dialogue.  All sin and all misery; all covetousness, envy, pride, and wrath,--trace it all back to its roots, travel it all up to its source, and, as sure as you do that, self and self-love are that source, that root, and that black bottom.  I do not forget that Butler has said in some stately pages of his that self-love is morally good; that self-love is coincident with the principle of virtue and part of the idea; and that it is a proper motive for man.  But the deep bishop, in saying all that, is away back at the creation-scheme and Eden-state of human nature.  He has not as yet come down to human nature in its present state of overthrow, dismemberment, and self- destruction.  But when he does condescend and comes close to the mind and the heart of man as they now are in all men, even Butler becomes as outspoken, and as eloquent, and as full of passion and pathos as if he were an evangelical Puritan.  Self-love, Butler startles his sober-minded reader as he bursts out--self-love rends and distorts the mind of man!  Now, you are a man.  Well, then, do you feel and confess that rending and distorting to have taken place in you?  Butler is a philosopher, and Goodwin is a preacher, but you are more:  you are a man.  You are the owner of a human heart, and you can say whether or no it is a rent and a distorted heart.  Is your mind warped and wrenched by self-love, and is your heart rent and torn by the same wicked hands?  Do you really feel that it needs nothing more to take you back again to paradise but that your heart be delivered from self-love?  Do you now understand that the foundations of heaven itself must be laid in a heart healed and cleansed and delivered from self-love?  If you do, then your knowledge of your own heart has set you abreast of the greatest of philosophers and theologians and preachers.  Nay, before multitudes of men who are called such.  It is my meditation all the day, you say.  I have more understanding now than all my teachers; for Thy testimonies are my meditation.  I understand more than the ancients; because now I keep Thy precepts.\\n2. 'Self-love has made us all malicious,' says John Calvin.  We are Calvinists, were we to call any man master.  But we are to call no man master, and least of all in the matters of the heart.  Every man must be his own philosopher, his own moralist, and his own theologian in the matters of the heart.  He who has a heart in his bosom and an eye in his head can need no Calvin, no Butler, no Goodwin, and no Law to tell him what goes on in his own heart. And, on the other hand, his own heart will soon tell him whether or no Calvin, and Butler, and Goodwin, and Law know anything about those matters on which some men would set them up as our masters. Well, come away all of you who own a human heart.  Come and say whether or no your heart, and the self-love of which it is full, have made you a malicious man.  I do not ask if you are always and to everybody full of maliciousness.  No; I know quite well that you are sometimes as sweet as honey and as soft as butter.  For, has not even Theophilus said that whilst a man still lives among the vanities of time, his covetousness, his envy, his pride, and his wrath may be in a tolerable state, and may help him to a mixture of peace and trouble; these vices may have their gratifications as well as their torments.  No; I do not trifle with you and with this serious matter so as to ask if you are full of malice at all times and to all men.  No.  For, let a man be fortunate enough to be on your side; let him pass over to your party; let him become profitable to you; let him be clever enough and mean enough to praise and to flatter you up to the top of your appetite for praise and flattery, and, no doubt, you will love that man.  Or, if that is not exactly love, at least it is no longer hate.  But let that man unfortunately be led to leave your party; let him cease being profitable to you; let him weary of flattering you with his praise; let him forget you, neglect you, despise you, and go against you, and then look at your own heart.  Do you care now to know what malice is?  Well, that is malice that distorts and rends your heart as often as you meet that man on the street or even pass by his door.  That is malice that dances in your eyes when you see his name in print.  That is malice with which you always break out when his name is mentioned in conversation.  That is malice that heats your heart when you suddenly recollect him in the multitude of your thoughts within you.  And you are in good company all the time. 'We, ourselves,' says Paul to Titus, 'we also at one time lived in malice and in envy.  We were hateful and we hated one another.' 'Hateful,' Goodwin goes on in his great book, 'every man is to another man more or less; he is hated of another and he hateth another more or less; and if his nature were let out to the full, there is that in him, \\\"every man is against every man,\\\" as is said of Ishmael.  Homo homini lupus,' adds our brave preacher.  And Abbe Grou speaks out with the same challenge from the opposite church pole, and says:  'Yes; self-love makes us touchy, ready to take offence, ill-tempered, suspicious, severe, exacting, easily offended; it keeps alive in our hearts a certain malignity, a secret joy at the mortifications which befall our neighbour; it nourishes our readiness to criticise, our dislike at certain persons, our ill-feeling, our bitterness, and a thousand other things prejudicial to charity.'\\n3. 'Myself is my own worst enemy,' says Abbe Grou.  That is to say, we may have enemies who hate us more than we hate ourselves, and enemies who would hurt us, if they could, as much as we hurt ourselves; but the Abbe's point is that they cannot.  And he is right.  No man has ever hurt me as I have hurt myself.  There are men who hate me so much that they would poison my life of all its peace and happiness if they could.  But they cannot.  They cannot; but let them not be cast down on that account, for there is one who can do, and who will do as long as he lives, what they cannot do. A man's foes, to be called foes, are in his own house:  they are in his own heart.  Let our enemies attend to their own peace and happiness, and our self-love will do all, and more than all, that they would fain do.  At the most, they and their ill-will can only give occasion to our self-love; but it is our self-love that seizes upon the occasion, and through it rends and distorts our own hearts.  And were our hearts only pure of self-love, were our hearts only clothed with meekness and humility, we could laugh at all the ill-will of our enemies as leviathan laughs at the shaking of a spear.  'Know thou,' says A Kempis to his son, 'that the love of thyself doth do thee more hurt than anything in the whole world.'  Yes; but we shall never know that by merely reading The Imitation.  We must read ourselves.  We must study, as we study nothing else, our own rent and distorted hearts.  Our own hearts must be our daily discovery.  We must watch the wounds our hearts take every day; and we must give all our powers of mind to tracing all our wounds back to their true causes.  We must say:  'that sore blow came on my mind and on my heart from such and such a quarter, from such and such a hand, from such and such a weapon; but this pain, this rankling, poisoned, and ever-festering wound, this sleepless, gnawing, cancerous sore, comes from the covetousness, the pride, the envy, and the wrath of my own heart.'  When we begin to say that, we shall then begin to understand and to love Thomas; we shall sit daily at his feet and shall be numbered among his sons.\\n4. And this suffering at our own hands goes on till at last the tables are completely turned against self-love, and till what was once to us the dearest thing in the whole world becomes, as Pascal says, the most hateful.  We begin life by hating the men, and the things, who hurt us.  We hate the men who oppose us and hinder us; the men who speak, and write, and act, and go in any way against us.  We bitterly hate all who humble us, despise us, trample upon us, and in any way ill-use us.  But afterwards, when we have become men, men in experience of this life, and, especially, of ourselves in this life; after we gain some real insight and attain to some real skill in the life of the heart, we come round to forgive those we once hated.  We have come now to see why they did it.  We see now exactly how much they hurt us after all, and how little.  And, especially, we have come to see,--what at one time we could not have believed,--that all our hurt, to be called hurt, has come to us from ourselves.  And thus that great revolution of mind and that great revulsion of feeling and of passion has taken place, after which we are left with no one henceforth to hate, to be called hating, but ourselves.  We may still continue to avoid our enemies, and we may do that too long and too much; we may continue to fear them and be on the watch against them far too much; but to deliberately hate them is henceforth impossible.  All our hatred,-- all our deliberate, steady, rooted, active hatred,--is now at ourselves; at ourselves, that is, so far and so long as we remain under the malignant and hateful dominion of self-love.  When Butler gets our self-love restored to reasonableness, and made coincident with virtue and part of the idea; when our self-love becomes uniformly coincident with the principle of obedience to God's commands, then we shall love ourselves as our neighbour, and our neighbour as ourselves, and both in God.  But, till then, there is nothing and no one on earth or in hell so hateful to us as ourselves and our own hateful hearts.  And if in that we are treading the winepress alone as far as our fellow-men are concerned, all the more we have Him with us in all our agony who wept over the heart of man because He knew what was in it, and what must always come out of it.  Evil thoughts, He said, and fornications, and murders, and thefts, and covetousness, and wickedness, and deceit, and an evil eye, and pride, and folly, and what not.  And Paul has the mind of Christ with him in the text.  I do not need to repeat again the hateful words.  Now, what do you say? was Pascal beyond the truth, was he deeper than the truth or more deadly than the truth when he said with a stab that self is hateful?  I think not.\\n5. 'Oh that I were free, then, of myself,' wrote Samuel Rutherford from Aberdeen in 1637 to John Ferguson of Ochiltree.  'What need we all have to be ransomed and redeemed from that master-tyrant, that cruel and lawless lord, ourself!  Even when I am most out of myself, and am best serving Christ, I have a squint eye on myself.' And to the Laird of Cally in the same year and from the same place: 'Myself is the master idol we all bow down to.  Every man blameth the devil for his sins, but the house devil of every man that eateth with him and lieth in his bosom is himself.  Oh blessed are they who can deny themselves!'  And to the Irish ministers the year after:  'Except men martyr and slay the body of sin in sanctified self-denial, they shall never be Christ's.  Oh, if I could but be master of myself, my own mind, my own will, my own credit, my own love, how blessed were I!  But alas!  I shall die only minting and aiming at being a Christian.'\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII--OLD MR. PREJUDICE, THE KEEPER OF EAR-GATE, WITH HIS SIXTY DEAF MEN UNDER HIM\\n\\n'Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel?'--Naaman.\\n\\n'Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?'--Nathanael.\\n\\n' . . observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.'--Paul.\\n\\nOld Mr. Prejudice was well known in the wars of Mansoul as an angry, unhappy, and ill-conditioned old churl.  Old Mr. Prejudice was placed by Diabolus, his master, as keeper of the ward at the post of Ear-gate, and for that fatal service he had sixty completely deaf men put under him as his company.  Men eminently advantageous for that fatal service.  Eminently advantageous,-- inasmuch as it mattered not one atom to them what was spoken in their ear either by God or by man.\\n\\n1. Now, to begin with, this churlish old man had already earned for himself a very evil name.  For what name could well be more full of evil memories and of evil omens than just this name of Prejudice?  Just consider what prejudice is.  Prejudice, when we stop over it and take it to pieces and look well at it,--prejudice is so bad and so abominable that you would not believe it could be so bad till you had looked at it and at how it acts in your own case.  For prejudice gives judgment on your case and gives orders for your execution before your defence has been heard, before your witnesses have been called, before your summons has been served, ay, and even before your indictment has been drawn out.  What a scandal and what an uproar a malfeasance of justice like that would cause if it were to take place in any of our courts of law!  Only, the thing is impossible; you cannot even imagine it.  We shall have Magna Charta up before us in the course of these lectures.  Well, ever since Magna Charta was extorted from King John, such a scandal as I have supposed has been impossible either in England or in Scotland.  And that such cases should still be possible in Russia and in Turkey places those two old despotisms outside the pale of the civilised world.  And yet, loudly as we all denounce the Czar and the Sultan, eloquently as we boast over Magna Charta, Habeas Corpus, and what not, every day you and I are doing what would cost an English king his crown, and an English judge his head.  We all do it every day, and it never enters one mind out of a hundred that we are trampling down truth, and righteousness, and fairplay, and brotherly love.  We do not know what a diabolical wickedness we are perpetrating every day.  The best men among us are guilty of that iniquity every day, and they never confess it to themselves; no one ever accuses them of it; and they go down to death and judgment unsuspicious of the discovery that they will soon make there.  You would not steal a stick or a straw that belonged to me; but you steal from me every day what all your gold and mine can never redeem; you murder me every day in my best and my noblest life. You me, and I you.\\n2. Old Mr. Prejudice.  Now, there is a golden passage in Jonathan Edwards's Diary that all old men should lay well to heart and conscience.  'I observe,' Edwards enters, 'that old men seldom have any advantage of new discoveries, because these discoveries are beside a way of thinking they have been long used to.  Resolved, therefore, that, if ever I live to years, I will be impartial to hear the reasons of all pretended discoveries, and receive them, if rational, how long soever I have been used to another way of thinking.  I am too dogmatical; I have too much of egotism; my disposition is always to be telling of my dislike and my scorn.' What a fine, fresh, fruitful, progressive, and peaceful world we should soon have if all our old and all our fast-ageing men would enter that extract into their diary!  How the young would then love and honour and lean upon the old; and how all the fathers would always abide young and full of youthful life like their children! Then the righteous should flourish like the palm-tree; he should grow like a cedar in Lebanon.  They that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God.  They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing. What a free scope would then be given to all God's unfolding providences, and what a warm welcome to all His advancing truths! What sore and spreading wounds would then be salved, what health and what vigour would fill all the body political, as well as all the body mystical!  May the Lord turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest the earth be smitten with a curse!\\n3. Mr. Prejudice was an old man; and this also has been handed down about him, that he was almost always angry.  And if you keep your eyes open you will soon see how true to the life that feature of old Mr. Prejudice still is.  In every conversation, discussion, debate, correspondence, the angry man is invariably the prejudiced man; and, according to the age and the depth, the rootedness and the intensity of his prejudices, so is the ferocity and the savagery of his anger.  He has already settled this case that you are irritating and wronging him so much by your still insisting on bringing up.  It is a reproach to his understanding for you to think that there is anything to be said in that matter that he has not long ago heard said and fully answered.  Has he not denounced that bad man and that bad cause for years?  You insult me, sir, by again opening up that matter in my presence.  He will have none of you or of your arguments either.  You are as bad yourself as that bad man is whose advocate you are.  We all know men whose hearts are full of coals of juniper, burning coals of hate and rage, just by reason of their ferocious prejudices.  Hate is too feeble a word for their gnashing rage against this man and that cause, this movement and that institution.  There is an absolutely murderous light in their eye as they work themselves up against the men and the things they hate.  Charity rejoices not in iniquity; but you will see otherwise Christian and charitable men so jockeyed by the devil that they actually rejoice in iniquity and do not know what they are doing, or who it is that is egging them on to do it.  You will see otherwise and at other times good men so full of the rage and madness of prejudice and partiality that they will storm at every report of goodness and truth and prosperity in the man, or in the cause, or in the church, or in the party, they are so demented against.  Jockey is not the word.  There is the last triumph of pure devilry in the way that the prince of the devils turns old Prejudice's very best things--his love of his fathers, his love of the past, his love of order, his love of loyalty, his love of the old paths, and his very truest and best religion itself--into so much fat fuel for the fires of hate and rage that are consuming his proud heart to red-hot ashes.  If the light that is in us be darkness, how great is that darkness; and if the life that is in us be death, how deadly is that death!\\n4. Old, angry, and ill-conditioned.  Ill-conditioned is an old- fashioned word almost gone out of date.  But, all the same, it is a very expressive, and to us to-night a quite indispensable word.  An ill-conditioned man is a man of an in-bred, cherished, and confirmed ill-nature.  His heart, which was a sufficiently bad heart to begin with, is now so exercised in evil and so accustomed to evil, that,--how can he be born again when he is so old and so ill-natured?  All the qualities, all the passions, all the emotions of his heart are out of joint; their bent is bad; they run out naturally to mischief.  Now, what could possibly be more ill- conditioned than to judge and sentence, denounce and execute a man before you have heard his case?  What could be more ill-conditioned than positively to be afraid lest you should be led to forgive, and redress, and love, and act with another man?  To be determined not to hear one word that you can help in his defence, in his favour, and in his praise?  Could a human heart be in a worse state on this side hell itself than that?  Nay, that is hell itself in your evil heart already.  Let prejudice and partiality have their full scope among the wicked passions of your ill-conditioned heart, and lo! the kingdom of darkness is already within you.  Not, lo, here! or, lo, there! but within you.  Look to yourselves, says John to us all, full as we all are of our own ill-conditions.  Look to yourselves.  But we have no eyes left with which to see ourselves; we look so much at the faults and the blames of our neighbour. 'Publius goes to church sometimes, and reads the Scriptures; but he knows not what he reads or prays, his head is so full of politics. He is so angry at kings and ministers of state that he has no time nor disposition to call himself to account.  He has the history of all parliaments, elections, prosecutions, and impeachments by heart, and he dies with little or no religion, through a constant fear of Popery.'  Poor, old, ill-conditioned Publius!\\n5. And, then, his sixty deaf men under old, angry, ill-conditioned Prejudice.  We read of engines of sixty-horse power.  And here is a man with the power of resisting and shutting out the truth equal to that of sixty men like himself.  We all know such men; we would as soon think of speaking to those iron pillars about a change of mind as we would to them.  If you preach to their prejudices and their prepossessions and their partialities, they are all ears to hear you, and all tongues to trumpet your praise.  But do not expect them to sit still with ordinary decency under what they are so prejudiced against; do not expect them to read a book or buy a passing paper on the other side.  Sixty deaf men hold their ears; sixty ill-conditioned men hold their hearts.  Habit with them is all the test of truth; it must be right, they've done it from their youth.  And thus they go on to the end of their term of life, full of their own fixed ideas, with their eyes full of beams and jaundices and darkness and death.  Some people think that we take up too much of our time with newspapers in our day, and that, if things go on as they are going, we shall soon have neither time nor taste for anything else but half a dozen papers a day.  But all that depends on the conditions with which we read.  If we would read as Jonathan Edwards read the weekly news-letters of his day; if we read all our papers to see if the kingdom of God was coming in reply to our prayer; if we read, observing all things, like Timothy, without prejudice or partiality, then I know no better reading for an ill-conditioned heart begun to look to itself than just a good, out-and-out party newspaper.  And if it is a church paper all the better for your purpose.  If you read with your fingers in your ears; if you read with a beam in your eye, you had better confine yourself in your reading; if you feel that your prejudices are inflamed and your partiality is intensified, then take care what paper you take in.  But if you read all you read for the love of the truth, for justice, for fair-play, and for brotherly love, and all that in yourself; if you read all the time with your eyes on your own ill-conditioned heart, then, as James says, count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations.  Take up your political and ecclesiastical paper every morning, saying to yourself, Go to, O my heart, and get thy daily lesson.  Go to, and enter thy cleansing and refining furnace.  Go to, and come well out of thy daily temptation.--A nobler school you will not find anywhere for a prejudiced, partial, angry, and ill-conditioned heart than just the party journals of the day.  For the abating of prejudice; for seeing the odiousness of partiality, and for putting on every day a fair, open, catholic, Christian mind, commend me to the public life and the public journals of our living day.  And it is not that this man may be up and that man down; this cause victorious and that cause defeated; this truth vindicated and that untruth defeated, that public life rolls on and that its revolutions are reported to us.  Our own minds and our own hearts are the final cause, the ultimate drift, and the far-off end and aim of it all.  We are not made for party and for the partialities and prosperities of party; party and all its passions and all its successes and all its defeats are made, and are permitted to be made for us; for our opportunity of purging ourselves free of all our ill-conditions, of all our prejudices, of all our partialities, and of all the sin and misery that come to us of all these things.\",\"timestamp\":1641297855,\"title\":\"And then for pleasantness the human heart is a perfect paradise\"},\"digest\":\"KtAK8HKrWaJVzhRMcovCgCBbwIkqYmbFeJxDGmajrwc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9dA14EBFe3CfE059a88A873b83F5D7f596175316\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"25ZMKCV0GixqwiUuK3KY9D7jE1lLZq1aRncNqAIRqPk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DEEmNVxS8WMDjtdOcuAyRs6hsc6cNQ8y6mtq1ByI4ss\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"PNpV5mCzCMM3HRgYEvfzZPutaVVSPK02KHt4vroYOS-LzUxLuXwE2v82lfOzDrx_io5OB3SUPhvRvVQqoxElRA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9a482074ae313f658f39f09f8b439252183d07fd9b265724093bffd963eb9d62769aba615ac0fac9eafb24b748488e9c69e8c1c85ea8ad9d5a9f27e5abd485b61b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"25ZMKCV0GixqwiUuK3KY9D7jE1lLZq1aRncNqAIRqPk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DEEmNVxS8WMDjtdOcuAyRs6hsc6cNQ8y6mtq1ByI4ss\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"KtAK8HKrWaJVzhRMcovCgCBbwIkqYmbFeJxDGmajrwc\"}"
