"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### So you want to be an Investment Banker eh?\\n\\nWell guess what, the acceptance rate of top investment banks is [less than 5%](https://www.efinancialcareers.co.uk/news/2019/09/how-to-get-a-job-at-goldman-sachs). Even if you go to an ivy league, landing jobs at these firms is not easy. Before we dig deeper, I want to emphasize that investment banking is [NOT for everyone](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/27/business/dealbook/banker-burnout.html) and if you’re only interested in it for the prestige / money, I don’t recommend pursuing the path.\\n\\nContrary to popular belief, investment baking analyst positions are MAINLY taken by [summer interns](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/careers/jobs/investment-banking-internship-programs/). Junior summer internships are by far the most important in the field as they often translate to Full-Time offers if you perform well. Some years, investment banks won’t even take Full-Time candidates because they fill all of their seats with their summer intern class. Let’s dive into the general timeline of the process.\\n\\n### Timeline\\n\\n* **Fall of sophomore year:** [Diversity programs](https://www.efinancialcareers.co.uk/news/2012/10/ten-programmes-that-help-minority-students-into-investment-banking-and-how-to-access-them) at most large banks open up\\n  * This is the the time to really start studying preparing for behavioral and technical questions regarding the industry\\n  * These programs are great pipelines into interviews and potential offers\\n* **Spring of sophomore year:** General applications open up for [independent advisory firms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_advisory_firm) (AKA Elite Boutique firms)\\n  * These firms tend to be very technical in their interview process and are generally take more ivy league / top school applicants\\n  * Most applications open in Feb - April and interviews could start within a few weeks after\\n* **Summer between sophomore and junior year:** [Bulge Bracket banks](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/careers/companies/bulge-bracket-investment-banks-list/) open general applications\\n  * Known to be geared a bit more towards a candidates’ “fit”, but will still test technicals\\n  * Some BBs are known to recruit earlier in the summer (at or before July 1st, which is the date many of the firms open applications) while others won’t kick off the process until late August or even early September\\n\\n![Source: Columbia Career Center](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2gmtFAixjDbhWyjJbB_bk.png?height=600&width=900)\\n\\n### What does the interview process look like?\\n\\n### How do I prepare for the technical interviews?\\n\\n**GUIDES** are your best friend. Many people worry that interviewers could ask anything under the sun and they have no idea how to prepare. In reality, most investment banking interviews tend to focus on a few key topics and learning them is easier than you might think.\\n\\nThere are tons of great guides, but I’ve noticed many people get confused with all the information and spend weeks just trying to figure out where to start. Below are guides that I’ve personally learned from as well as ones that have helped dozens of students land internships at top banks.\\n\\n**M&I 400 AKA “The 400 Question Guide”**\\n\\n[https://middsic.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/6/8/106836377/technicals.pdf](https://middsic.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/6/8/106836377/technicals.pdf)\\n\\nThis is by far THE BEST guide out there and if all you did was study this and understand the underlying concepts, you’d be able to ace 95% of investment banking interviews. Make sure to mock interview as much as you can with this guide. This could be as easy as spending 10 minutes a day having someone ask you 10 random questions from a section.\\n\\n*Pro Tip: Most people find this guide intimidating because it’s so long, which is fair, it definitely is long. My personal recommendation is start with the technical sections and focus on the “basic” questions only. Spend a week going through each section (I personally just wrote the questions down by hand and copied the answers at first. This might sound dumb, but this was really helpful for me because it forced me to think about the question as I wrote it down and the answer to it).*\\n\\nWestern Investment Club Guide:\\n\\n[https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5cf45640c775120001d4c3cc/t/5e0168693c0d24577665c71a/1577150573184/2019-2020+WIC+Finance+Recruiting+Guide.pdf](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5cf45640c775120001d4c3cc/t/5e0168693c0d24577665c71a/1577150573184/2019-2020+WIC+Finance+Recruiting+Guide.pdf)\\n\\nMichigan Investment Banking Guide:\\n\\n[https://www.bankingatmichigan.org/s/BAM_MASTERDECK_31.pdf](https://www.bankingatmichigan.org/s/BAM_MASTERDECK_31.pdf)\\n\\n### Extra Resources\\n\\n* [Adventis](https://bootcamps.adventiscg.com/summer-internships/internships?fbclid=IwAR3JJ8Lb7bdpydpnAcAsse8xcsrcIyIXtW9la6Su0hsex_gVUdLojC8MYJw): Excellent tool for keeping track of recruiting timelines\\n* [IB Vine](https://ibvine.io/): Great for studying (digital flash cards)\\n* [Wall Street Oasis](https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/forum/investment-banking): Forum to discuss investment banking recruiting and to hear from seasoned veterans in the industry.
