"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"[Tech:NYC](https://www.technyc.org/) is the industry association for NYC’s tech sector. I am the Chair of the organization. I am excited about Tech:NYC’s work to bring the ongoing NYC Mayoral race to the tech sector.\\n\\nOn Thursday, April 8th (tomorrow) at 4pmET, Tech:NYC will host a webinar with the top mayoral candidates that is open to all NYC tech employees. The candidates participating are Eric Adams, Shaun Donovan, Kathryn Garcia, Ray McGuire, Scott Stringer, Maya Wiley, and Andrew Yang. The forum will be moderated by Josh Barro. The [NYC Mayoral Forum](https://technyc-org.zoom.us/webinar/register/6316177224414/WN_MsebLPxKSy2RqNT5ONkDPA) is hosted by Tech:NYC and Warby Parker and is co-hosted by AT\\\\&T, Bowery Farming, Etsy, Harry’s, Via, WeWork, Zola, and more.\\n\\nTech:NYC did a [poll](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/568af8d2d82d5e25a610856b/t/6048ec1e08a8d946cca43b49/1615391774450/Change+Research+Poll+of+New+Yorkers+Who+Work+in+Tech+Executive+Summary.pdf) of NYC tech employees earlier this year and it showed that the New Yorkers who work in tech largely care about the things that all New Yorkers care about. People are attracted to NYC because of its diversity, cultural institutions, subway, etc. – the things that make NYC NYC. And they care about their neighborhoods, schools, parks, quality of life, etc.\\n\\nThe poll also showed that lots of people in tech care about the mayoral race – 87% said they plan to vote in the primary.\\n\\nSo the [NYC Mayoral Forum](https://technyc-org.zoom.us/webinar/register/6316177224414/WN_MsebLPxKSy2RqNT5ONkDPA) is a great way for tech employees to get engaged in a race that really matters to the future of our city as we look to recover from COVID.
