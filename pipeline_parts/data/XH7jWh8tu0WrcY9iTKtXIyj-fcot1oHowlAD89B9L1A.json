"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"HIPPIAS:  I will; ask shortly anything which you like.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Do you say that the false, like the sick, have no power to do things, or that they have the power to do things?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  I should say that they have power to do many things, and in particular to deceive mankind.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Then, according to you, they are both powerful and wily, are they not?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Yes.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And are they wily, and do they deceive by reason of their simplicity and folly, or by reason of their cunning and a certain sort of prudence?\\n\\nHIPPIAS: By reason of their cunning and prudence, most certainly.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Then they are prudent, I suppose?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  So they are--very.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And if they are prudent, do they know or do they not know what they do?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Of course, they know very well; and that is why they do mischief to others.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And having this knowledge, are they ignorant, or are they wise?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Wise, certainly; at least, in so far as they can deceive.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Stop, and let us recall to mind what you are saying; are you not saying that the false are powerful and prudent and knowing and wise in those things about which they are false?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  To be sure.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And the true differ from the false--the true and the false are the very opposite of each other?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  That is my view.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Then, according to your view, it would seem that the false are to be ranked in the class of the powerful and wise?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Assuredly.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And when you say that the false are powerful and wise in so far as they are false, do you mean that they have or have not the power of uttering their falsehoods if they like?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  I mean to say that they have the power.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  In a word, then, the false are they who are wise and have the power to speak falsely?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Yes.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Then a man who has not the power of speaking falsely and is ignorant cannot be false?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  You are right.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And every man has power who does that which he wishes at the time when he wishes.  I am not speaking of any special case in which he is prevented by disease or something of that sort, but I am speaking generally, as I might say of you, that you are able to write my name when you like.  Would you not call a man able who could do that?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Yes.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And tell me, Hippias, are you not a skilful calculator and arithmetician?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Yes, Socrates, assuredly I am.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And if some one were to ask you what is the sum of 3 multiplied by 700, you would tell him the true answer in a moment, if you pleased?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  certainly I should.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Is not that because you are the wisest and ablest of men in these matters?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Yes.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And being as you are the wisest and ablest of men in these matters of calculation, are you not also the best?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  To be sure, Socrates, I am the best.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And therefore you would be the most able to tell the truth about these matters, would you not?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Yes, I should.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And could you speak falsehoods about them equally well?  I must beg, Hippias, that you will answer me with the same frankness and magnanimity which has hitherto characterized you.  If a person were to ask you what is the sum of 3 multiplied by 700, would not you be the best and most consistent teller of a falsehood, having always the power of speaking falsely as you have of speaking truly, about these same matters, if you wanted to tell a falsehood, and not to answer truly?  Would the ignorant man be better able to tell a falsehood in matters of calculation than you would be, if you chose?  Might he not sometimes stumble upon the truth, when he wanted to tell a lie, because he did not know, whereas you who are the wise man, if you wanted to tell a lie would always and consistently lie?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Yes, there you are quite right.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Does the false man tell lies about other things, but not about number, or when he is making a calculation?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  To be sure; he would tell as many lies about number as about other things.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Then may we further assume, Hippias, that there are men who are false about calculation and number?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Yes.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Who can they be?  For you have already admitted that he who is false must have the ability to be false:  you said, as you will remember, that he who is unable to be false will not be false?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Yes, I remember; it was so said.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And were you not yourself just now shown to be best able to speak falsely about calculation?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Yes; that was another thing which was said.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And are you not likewise said to speak truly about calculation?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Certainly.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Then the same person is able to speak both falsely and truly about calculation?  And that person is he who is good at calculation--the arithmetician?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Yes.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Who, then, Hippias, is discovered to be false at calculation?  Is he not the good man?  For the good man is the able man, and he is the true man.\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  That is evident.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Do you not see, then, that the same man is false and also true about the same matters?  And the true man is not a whit better than the false; for indeed he is the same with him and not the very opposite, as you were just now imagining.\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Not in that instance, clearly.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Shall we examine other instances?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Certainly, if you are disposed.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Are you not also skilled in geometry?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  I am.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Well, and does not the same hold in that science also?  Is not the same person best able to speak falsely or to speak truly about diagrams; and he is--the geometrician?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Yes.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  He and no one else is good at it?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Yes, he and no one else.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Then the good and wise geometer has this double power in the highest degree; and if there be a man who is false about diagrams the good man will be he, for he is able to be false; whereas the bad is unable, and for this reason is not false, as has been admitted.\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  True.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Once more--let us examine a third case; that of the astronomer, in whose art, again, you, Hippias, profess to be a still greater proficient than in the preceding--do you not?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Yes, I am.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And does not the same hold of astronomy?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  True, Socrates.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And in astronomy, too, if any man be able to speak falsely he will be the good astronomer, but he who is not able will not speak falsely, for he has no knowledge.\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Clearly not.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Then in astronomy also, the same man will be true and false?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  It would seem so.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And now, Hippias, consider the question at large about all the sciences, and see whether the same principle does not always hold.  I know that in most arts you are the wisest of men, as I have heard you boasting in the agora at the tables of the money-changers, when you were setting forth the great and enviable stores of your wisdom; and you said that upon one occasion, when you went to the Olympic games, all that you had on your person was made by yourself.  You began with your ring, which was of your own workmanship, and you said that you could engrave rings; and you had another seal which was also of your own workmanship, and a strigil and an oil flask, which you had made yourself; you said also that you had made the shoes which you had on your feet, and the cloak and the short tunic; but what appeared to us all most extraordinary and a proof of singular art, was the girdle of your tunic, which, you said, was as fine as the most costly Persian fabric, and of your own weaving; moreover, you told us that you had brought with you poems, epic, tragic, and dithyrambic, as well as prose writings of the most various kinds; and you said that your skill was also pre-eminent in the arts which I was just now mentioning, and in the true principles of rhythm and harmony and of orthography; and if I remember rightly, there were a great many other accomplishments in which you excelled.  I have forgotten to mention your art of memory, which you regard as your special glory, and I dare say that I have forgotten many other things; but, as I was saying, only look to your own arts--and there are plenty of them--and to those of others; and tell me, having regard to the admissions which you and I have made, whether you discover any department of art or any description of wisdom or cunning, whichever name you use, in which the true and false are different and not the same:  tell me, if you can, of any.  But you cannot.\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Not without consideration, Socrates.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Nor will consideration help you, Hippias, as I believe; but then if I am right, remember what the consequence will be.\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  I do not know what you mean, Socrates.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  I suppose that you are not using your art of memory, doubtless because you think that such an accomplishment is not needed on the present occasion.  I will therefore remind you of what you were saying:  were you not saying that Achilles was a true man, and Odysseus false and wily?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  I was.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And now do you perceive that the same person has turned out to be false as well as true?  If Odysseus is false he is also true, and if Achilles is true he is also false, and so the two men are not opposed to one another, but they are alike.\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  O Socrates, you are always weaving the meshes of an argument, selecting the most difficult point, and fastening upon details instead of grappling with the matter in hand as a whole.  Come now, and I will demonstrate to you, if you will allow me, by many satisfactory proofs, that Homer has made Achilles a better man than Odysseus, and a truthful man too; and that he has made the other crafty, and a teller of many untruths, and inferior to Achilles.  And then, if you please, you shall make a speech on the other side, in order to prove that Odysseus is the better man; and this may be compared to mine, and then the company will know which of us is the better speaker.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  O Hippias, I do not doubt that you are wiser than I am.  But I have a way, when anybody else says anything, of giving close attention to him, especially if the speaker appears to me to be a wise man.  Having a desire to understand, I question him, and I examine and analyse and put together what he says, in order that I may understand; but if the speaker appears to me to be a poor hand, I do not interrogate him, or trouble myself about him, and you may know by this who they are whom I deem to be wise men, for you will see that when I am talking with a wise man, I am very attentive to what he says; and I ask questions of him, in order that I may learn, and be improved by him.  And I could not help remarking while you were speaking, that when you recited the verses in which Achilles, as you argued, attacks Odysseus as a deceiver, that you must be strangely mistaken, because Odysseus, the man of wiles, is never found to tell a lie; but Achilles is found to be wily on your own showing.  At any rate he speaks falsely; for first he utters these words, which you just now repeated,--\\n\\n'He is hateful to me even as the gates of death who thinks one thing and says another:'--\\n\\nAnd then he says, a little while afterwards, he will not be persuaded by Odysseus and Agamemnon, neither will he remain at Troy; but, says he,--\\n\\n'To-morrow, when I have offered sacrifices to Zeus and all the Gods, having loaded my ships well, I will drag them down into the deep; and then you shall see, if you have a mind, and if such things are a care to you, early in the morning my ships sailing over the fishy Hellespont, and my men eagerly plying the oar; and, if the illustrious shaker of the earth gives me a good voyage, on the third day I shall reach the fertile Phthia.'\\n\\nAnd before that, when he was reviling Agamemnon, he said,--\",\"timestamp\":1635906481,\"title\":\"Well, then, as there is no possibility of asking Homer what he meant in these verses of his, let us leave him; but as you show a willingness to take up his cause,\"},\"digest\":\"idbC5JL-IgNXV0gVFUYdPlrMkJyHiwh-BnyRZ8pYVKQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xfbd725612A5299FAE5cea4725fAb05072Fc51050\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uJroakbswQU_zmjqoddF0mhFgrqqkChx10yH-QnOJoI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ynmxEgy7cyM8h9xDxRP44RWWBefb7a3VARKngOp2fbY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"6SvyuPKxWSLZmn7B6sKQGWe_Olzq6Rr9_YPNn_L6fpWtM6fV-7tpVNG9pQk13BCxHCcbqnkOeklZCTyIGClgHQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xbcc712e370f6a53491e87a9ce8fe00ae5631189de55eb0f4b3d7a06e64d5e56647edaeff8226ab56563e8d4996c179255cb1902749caa253037fdd8745c4f1651c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uJroakbswQU_zmjqoddF0mhFgrqqkChx10yH-QnOJoI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ynmxEgy7cyM8h9xDxRP44RWWBefb7a3VARKngOp2fbY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"idbC5JL-IgNXV0gVFUYdPlrMkJyHiwh-BnyRZ8pYVKQ\"}"
