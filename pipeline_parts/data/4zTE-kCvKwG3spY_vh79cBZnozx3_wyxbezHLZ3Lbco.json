"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The Vega Restricted Mainnet is now well and truly live, complete with staking from the community, governance proposals and a successful checkpoint reset. We‚Äôve seen this fast track development, moving fast and breaking things.\\n\\n## Mainnet\\n\\nThe validators began a Vega chain with a bridge to the Ethereum Mainnet. We couldn‚Äôt believe our eyes. Some of us couldn‚Äôt speak for a while, others started staring at the ceiling and thanking the sweet lord. After stable operation for a week, Mainnet was announced to the community and the staking floodgates opened. \\n\\n![The speechless moment](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sD8FbdZO_mKyOcL2PyJri.png?height=464&width=2770)\\n\\n## Staking - THANK YOU ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®\\n\\nWe‚Äôre overwhelmed by the support, thank you to everyone who has staked with us. Close to half the network has been staked - around $350 million of security for the network. Check out stats on one of Nodes Guru‚Äôs signature explorer dashboards, now for Vega:\\n\\n[https://nodes.guru/vega/vegaworld](https://nodes.guru/vega/vegaworld)\\n\\nIf you‚Äôd like to stake, you‚Äôll need to set up a Vega wallet on your local machine, and connect it to the staking website at \\n\\n[https://token.vega.xyz/](https://token.vega.xyz/)\\n\\n[https://token.vega.xyz/staking](https://token.vega.xyz/staking)\\n\\n[https://token.vega.xyz/staking](https://token.vega.xyz/staking)\\n\\nWe‚Äôve made some video walkthroughs. One [for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcEK1bJOUg0), and one for [terminal masters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r7JNIegyV8) (below).\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r7JNIegyV8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r7JNIegyV8)\\n\\n## Governance\\n\\nVega‚Äôs first [governance proposal](https://community.vega.xyz/t/proposal-set-reward-staking-delegation-payoutdelay-to-0s-from-current-72h-rerun/3860)  was passed by the community. At first it failed to achieve quorum (the minimum participation threshold) of 25% of the network. The proposal was proposed a second time, reached quorum, and passed. In our experience at Nala, 25% is quite a high participation rate for governance in DeFi, but it seems as a community we can currently hit it, so LFG.\\n\\n[https://community.vega.xyz/t/proposal-set-reward-staking-delegation-payoutdelay-to-0s-from-current-72h-rerun/3860](https://community.vega.xyz/t/proposal-set-reward-staking-delegation-payoutdelay-to-0s-from-current-72h-rerun/3860)\\n\\nThe proposal was to change the network parameter `reward.staking.delegation.payoutDelay` to `0s` (zero seconds), down from `72hr`. This reduction was intended to avoid any potential errors with overlapping staking reward payouts and **checkpoint resets.** So there is basically no risk that the validators do a reset during a payoutDelay period and users lose their staking rewards.\\n\\nNala supported the proposal, as did the rest of the community, unanimously. However, we recommend that this parameter is reviewed when trading is enabled on mainnet. A small payout delay may stall a hostile agent from withdrawing any rewards they shouldn‚Äôt have access to. Primarily this is when the system is more complex, and there is more at stake, it is inherently higher risk.\\n\\n## Checkpoint Reset\\n\\nThe validator set completed a checkpoint restore of the Vega blockchain at 1400, UTC+0 on the 13th of December. An issue was identified during this reset regarding the microservice used to sync with the Ethereum blockchain. When the chain starts up, we need to make sure enough validators are successfully running these services before we submit the checkpoint restore transaction.\\n\\nAll of these activities are testing and helping fortify the network before trading is enabled. Looking forward to more software releases from Vega.\",\"timestamp\":1639505847,\"title\":\"ü™ê Nala Validator Update: Vega 1.0\"},\"digest\":\"_OEwVV8cOroNW89djT8LveATnyGRgA2mQ98g0JzZEI0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd05883061A06048fB150904A93bbDf25FEBEeb55\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4YpVlDkgL7mNKWAh2Vm-3HKUBM1SBTdRdNDvKJld8io\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"LTamVOiHnhEt8O8wuZOf-b7xkTS6wFrMk_73CzX8W_4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"REtbPJ_0MVsAxIUrid4suTvcOqZ5E5jlqIDvUxN1v5-gtiexFwdD0NhIuFOUGFRuPghHuUHSYuSvkf-GBYxJig\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8b44405dcd97caf79c562ab48ebee1579781bf26b08a079c22c4f22bf6276fd260c6d2f019aa1370add6c72b84a6ec4cc0b27fe38a71d53158cdbef979d9ae6800\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4YpVlDkgL7mNKWAh2Vm-3HKUBM1SBTdRdNDvKJld8io\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"LTamVOiHnhEt8O8wuZOf-b7xkTS6wFrMk_73CzX8W_4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"_OEwVV8cOroNW89djT8LveATnyGRgA2mQ98g0JzZEI0\"}"
