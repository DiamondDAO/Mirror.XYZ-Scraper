"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"To me, decentralization represents a tectonic socioeconomic shift for the modern world. For centuries, the world has relied on centralized governments, financial institutions and other centralized organizations to imbue us with a false sense of security and safety.\\n\\nHowever, it’s becoming abundantly clear that those same organizations and authorities that we have granted these such powers to are often not acting in the best interest of their constituents and are merely looking after their individual selves. Moreover, the costs that we pay for this false sense of security are inefficient and harmful to the societies that these organizations serve.\\n\\nFrom a sociopolitical perspective, decentralization helps distribute and democratize power and empowers the active participants of any given society (or organization), rather than those who are more privileged.\\n\\nFrom an economic point of view, decentralization helps remove the costs, inefficiencies and risks associated with needing to trust intermediaries and centralized parties.\\n\\nSimply put, it just makes everything better — not necessarily easier, but better.\\n\\n \\n\\n**2 — What is the biggest obstacle facing Ethereum today, and what is its biggest opportunity?**\\n\\nCoined by [Vitalik Buterin](https://cointelegraph.com/top-people-in-crypto-and-blockchain-2021/vitalik-buterin), the “blockchain trilemma” refers to the challenges and trade-offs that exist between the three main facets of a blockchain — decentralization, security and scalability. He notes that developers have to choose between trade-offs among the three facets.\\n\\nWhile Ethereum is one of the most decentralized and secure blockchains that exist today, it is also one of the least scalable ones. The move to a more scalable, faster, cheaper [Ethereum 2.0](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/ethereum-upgrades-a-beginners-guide-to-eth-2-0) has been, and will continue to be, one of the most complex and challenging developments of the Ethereum development community. \",\"timestamp\":1639039285,\"title\":\"What does decentralization mean to you, and why is it important?\"},\"digest\":\"Wwg0YYLymN-KJN1oM6Pesqx_ALO3xvZ-YESxmgOF_Ek\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xcE351CE7d3e918323CB7C7023Bd59898005CE6e8\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"i-poKA2pv14ubZVc-8Qvb_rqej9IUq_TQDwT_GKwxTs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"fqF6fvruUXlMmYEf_NsBPWvVW5Q5sJkfmnFTJKqmaFo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"vpIydRh8W3xhPToQBbdt1BCtzEKa0zrLhdQCLfVIH4VuBHrZzmV0kIafHuMwohb4EQwPndBphga7V-sos7L86A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf1550e13e30f207ecd1524ec988358f831169d10a88f23a8b93aecb1f0f2df581b1370b1bbbd759c309490567dc3749815702eebe39b41cbf4197565b04cd6f91c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"i-poKA2pv14ubZVc-8Qvb_rqej9IUq_TQDwT_GKwxTs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"fqF6fvruUXlMmYEf_NsBPWvVW5Q5sJkfmnFTJKqmaFo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Wwg0YYLymN-KJN1oM6Pesqx_ALO3xvZ-YESxmgOF_Ek\"}"
