"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Gas fees, Rollups, Incentives, How to Move Funds to Arbitrum**\\n\\n## Main problem\\n\\nGas fees have been a challenge for all the projects on the Ethereum ecosystem for a long time, since 2020, volatility and fees have been known as being a big issue. Since then, many people have been trying to come up with solutions, some involve sidechains, others, L2 solutions. Either way, it’s a delicate subject, since we have to choose on each sides of the blockchain trilemma we want to be. Dev Protocol was born and grew in this environment, and now, to solve the gas fees problems we have deployed Dev Protocol on Arbitrum.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TavuU7sw_8A4-xigGKZkX.png?height=900&width=1600)\\n\\nArbitrum will allow Dev Protocol to be used as it was intended, the low gas fees - up to 100x cheaper than mainnet! - and instant transactions will improve the usage of the dApp and make Dev Protocol a much more attractive solution for many creators. We hope that this new environment will spark the growth of our ecosystem, which ultimately will impact all of the Decentralized Creator Economy, spilling over benefits for everyone involved with it.\\n\\n## What is Arbitrum\\n\\nI don’t want this to be a boring presentation of the details of Arbitrum, so I’ll just take some parts of their documentation and paste them here just to give you an idea. If you’re still curious, please check the video at the end of this section and read their [docs](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/developer_quickstart).\\n\\nSo, to understand Arbitrum, their own documentation suggests you to understand what is a rollup first, so, let’s begin:\\n\\n### Rollups\\n\\n\\\\`Rollups are a general approach to scaling open contracts, that is, contracts that everyone can see and interact with. In a rollup, transactions are written on Ethereum (as calldata), but the actual computation and storage of the contract are done off-chain. Somebody (a validator) posts on-chain an assertion (also known as a Rollup block) about what the contract will do — a list of actions taken by the contract, such as payments made, and a cryptographic hash of its state after the contract has executed the calls that have already been posted on-chain. We can think of the assertion as “rolling up” all of the calls and their results into a single on-chain transaction.\\\\`\\n\\n### Arbitrum rollups\\n\\n\\\\`In short, Arbitrum enables you to interact with and deploy smart contracts at a fraction of the cost of using Ethereum natively, and using all the same tooling you use to interact with Ethereum today without compromising on security or decentralization. No custom tooling is required to use the chain, but anyone can elect to validate the chain.\\\\`\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgCgauWVTs0&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgCgauWVTs0&feature=youtu.be)\\n\\n## Incentives\\n\\nSince we want to offer the best experience for users and allow Creators to extract the maximum value from their own Creations, monetizing their projects (or even themselves) through our Ecosystem, we want to incentivize the move of Staking to Arbitrum.\\n\\nTo do this, Yield on Layer 2 starts at a significantly higher level, this means that active users and creators that are the first movers will receive a significant bonus compared to L1 stakers/creators. Check the image below to see, the APY is very significant at the moment.\\n\\n![https://stakes.social/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tyg4i1mr2gvZv6CCgApHT.png?height=1124&width=1999)\\n\\nTo avoid a sharp increase in APY on mainnet, which defeats the purpose of an incentive to move staking between Networks, like we want to, we will actively use our funds to maintain the APY at the same level as before the deployment, especially if it has a sharp increase . All the rewards received by the team funds will be burned.\\n\\nThis way we want to keep most of the Dev Protocol Ecosystem working in a cheaper and faster environment, remove concentration of Staking in a few projects, and redistribute funds for more Creators.\\n\\nCreators won’t have their pools available on Arbitrum straight away, so active Ethereum mainnet Creators should launch another pool to receive funding on this other Network. Since incentives are in place, Creators should take advantage of being first movers!

Simply go to the [Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/), connect via MetaMask, and bridge some ETH.\\n\\nIn order to send DEV to Layer 2, we will use the [DEV Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.devprotocol.xyz/wrap). Start by connecting your wallet. Keep in mind, you will need DEV in your wallet in order to wrap and bridge it to Arbitrum.\\n\\nYou’ll need to wrap your DEV to make an Arbitrum-compliant WDEV. You can do that in the “Wrap” tab.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vqUp-Y2XMXzfcJgnza7dn.png?height=904&width=944)\\n\\nOnce the transaction completes, you will see your WDEV balance reflected in the top right of the app. Now that we have some WDEV, we can use the L2 Bridge tab to send the funds to Arbitrum.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vpJtAAzoMpTL147lo_rHW.png?height=952&width=1504)\\n\\n**Bridging funds to Arbitrum usually takes about 10 minutes for the funds to appear on Layer 2.**\\n\\nIn order for the funds to show up in MetaMask, make sure you import the token 0x91F5dC90979b058eBA3be6B7B7e523df7e84e137, which is DEV on Arbitrum Mainnet.\\n\\nKeep in mind, withdrawing \\\\*any funds\\\\* from Arbitrum can take up to 10 days to complete.\\n\\nRemember, you also have to send Ethereum to Arbitrum to cover for gas fees, to that, follow these steps:\\n\\nTo transfer ETH from Ethereum mainnet (Layer 1) to Arbitrum (Layer 2) :\\n\\n* 1. Go to the [Arbitrum bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/), click on ‘I agree’, then connect your wallet.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0PgtdVnoMZKiT8AmzmBOQ.png?height=931&width=1915)\\n\\n* 1. After connecting, a window showing your current balance on L1 should show up. Check your ETH balance and set the amount you want to transfer to L2.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8lX20yM-CRLTpltJWn58u.png?height=936&width=1890)\\n\\n* 1. Click deposit and confirm, all of your funds will be moved to the Arbitrum one chain, change the network on top of your wallet to Arbitrum one and proceed to stake on stakes.social\\n\\n  If you don’t feel comfortable enough after reading this, check out this YouTube video explaining how to do it step by step:\\n\\n  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxAC5Kg8B4U>\\n\\n  ## Arbitrum Pool and Partners\\n\\n  To attract investors, Patrons and Creators that already have funds on Arbitrum One, we have created a liquidity pool on Uniswap V3, you can find Dev Protocol through our token contract 0x91F5dC90979b058eBA3be6B7B7e523df7e84e137 .\\n\\n  \\\\*\\\\*\\n  \\\\*\\\\*This liquidity pool will be used to create our first trading pair on Arbitrum, and it’ll also be a bridge that will enable a soft transition into our **new partnership** that will provide **active management of a Uniswap V3 pool**, this will allow the Dev Protocol team to concentrate the focus and allocate more time on innovation and integrations. Details on this will come out in the next few weeks, **keep an eye on it!**\",\"timestamp\":1636023804,\"title\":\"How to move funds to Arbitrum and how it changes a lot of things\"},\"digest\":\"ckEla47R07WeKv3e_963a0Cgq2m_fV7epfGRjdlVJb0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd0569003436AeD6a15D8234003Fd333d80411Ea2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kKEW3Hx3Cqwh0Ay-al5V5bgMZTzr8cYVAyAvfQwKww0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"804W5i8ujPLROk5g6hpspimDO4D9ZDnOstZWe0ng9rc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"iwQhqDPG7325SFwIQYVUWXP__cceXt14xBFFPAoXnZjia08nFZueX_QmH0wPIbuN9vl5falgSjD3nxXl4ViQ3Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xef914184ddb8d6ba9aeefcd969fb7e5f02cc4114c3f991b1d7939ea31c0aba5615ccdab7b62b7df636b9f4865aec941bd38c5d154cd9465b1c0344db6e2d15d41b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kKEW3Hx3Cqwh0Ay-al5V5bgMZTzr8cYVAyAvfQwKww0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"804W5i8ujPLROk5g6hpspimDO4D9ZDnOstZWe0ng9rc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"m3L0bs9H8TqJ8akkqgljuskmxsdLxDOU0MkvLhqPg58\"}"
