We love that our events are a place for true **love**. If that‚Äôs a crime, **then we‚Äôre guilty**!\\n\\n### ü¶É Vulture Actually\\n\\nSometimes people go to Mundo Lingo and just so happen to talk to every good-looking potential bed-mate they can find. We‚Äôre not here to judge, but there are places (and apps) for that, and Mundo Lingo is not one of them. For the purpose of this exercise, we refer to this person as ‚Äú**The Vulture**‚Äù\\n\\n### Use the power of Mundo Lingo\\n\\nMundo Lingo‚Äôs power is that anyone can approach anyone. As easy as a vulture can approach a target without resistance, we can also approach this vulture and target without resistance, so let‚Äôs do that.\\n\\nIf you see a suspected vulture at work, discuss with your team and send a **Vulture Hunter** over to join the conversation. Nothing else, just join in and chat pleasantly. If the vulture moves on to another target then send another **Vulture Hunter**, and another and another until the vulture becomes exhausted, and probably leaves ü•≥.\\n\\n### Everyone wants to be liked.\\n\\nSocial pressure can be incredibly persuasive. If a vulture feels that the entire Ambassador team is watching, and then an Ambassador is approaching, another is walking past watching and so on, it becomes embarrassing for the vulture.\\n\\n### Avoid Authority, do involve Security if needed.\\n\\nYou, your team member or even the Manager may be tempted to have strong words with the vulture. It‚Äôs recommended to avoid this as it could aggravate the situation, try to dissuade your team from doing this. If the vulture acts so inappropriately that stronger action is needed then escalate to the venues‚Äô security team.\\n\\n## Now what?\\n\\nNext up, how to be a perfect [Cupid](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/sKQAXOKMUR7ruynT8iHu8IuCxI9kruvjl0cWp75AROI)\\n\\n### Go Back\\n\\nüëà [Ambassador‚Äôs Guild](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/1dLDLYhEaAbuzsJXAXt4JE62ZNLwCJnFLWRXbRjBqUY)\",\"timestamp\":1639557249,\"title\":\"A Vulture Hunters Guide\"},\"digest\":\"vivkKTlWU7BmbbbbaFzG-E4IYC9vn8EXmlgHuv5Ck0A\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"34suyCfnLUoFM02SOhmJJJ9iXgiiL5kC6iPH6Fv3LXk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"jtVAiplEVAd0RPMj7L2P0umm9wTPdvk-kh1vAJTvwJc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"h0UEbgt-q22-538LbVCKGf5A3b3sQeYQ8oYSIwMuZAB4qm1c-CWND302Z64gXzdk75CnnFJVU0vc9ytb9ooK-A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x57d0f7cbea22222afabed23e09ac819f759269ea4cca2a83cdd992ddf3ffe88d22a7afd325b70c3c1ae7dee6f5fc8e22188ba69c589cf1f0528e258261121ae51b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"34suyCfnLUoFM02SOhmJJJ9iXgiiL5kC6iPH6Fv3LXk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"jtVAiplEVAd0RPMj7L2P0umm9wTPdvk-kh1vAJTvwJc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"kQBwhQlTdsO8KCXfgG3OJn_ej4pmC5ZUCfOlrKvzIsM\"}"
