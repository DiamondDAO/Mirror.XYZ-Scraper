"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Four months ago, our team [launched Mirror Crowdfunding](https://dev.mirror.xyz/llJ_AboiDJwB_ZAFz-CXU7fL2p8v5Wz6MjfluLafewQ)*.* We have had a number of successful campaigns - attracting a median participation of 52 backers per project, and raising a total of over 118 ETH ($300,000 at time of writing) for books, essays, software, newsletters, and public goods.\\n\\n## How should we measure success?\\nWe should be critical in how we measure success. Some crypto projects focus on simple metrics such as the amount of ETH held in their contracts, or the trading volume. Often, these measures depend on a small number of contributors who hold a large amount of ETH, and thereby obfuscate (intentionally or not) the reality of thin adoption. \\n\\nThe total amount raised via Mirror's crowdfunding feature is a small part of the story. For these few months, we artificially limited the contribution amounts per backer, as well as the total funding amount per campaign. We did this to learn in a very controlled way about the possible mechanisms, intentions, and aspirations our community has for this new tool. In fact, almost every crowdfund has worked slightly differently, as we've tweaked the underlying logic to learn more.\\n\\nUntil we make this feature fully accessible, the most useful metrics to judge our success may be indirect, and stem from questions such as:\\n\\n1. How many unique backers, on average, does each each project attract?\\n2. How quickly are these backers able to fully fulfill the campaign's goal?\\n3. How diverse are the projects being funded?\\n4. What is the longevity of a project that is funded on Mirror, vs other funding platforms?\\n5. How does crowdfunding contribute to the general enthusiasm around Mirror - e.g. to the popularity of the [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race)?\\n\\nMany of these questions can be answered by reviewing public blockchain data. Here, I will reveal some general insights into the crowdfunding campaigns so far, and speculate on the reasons why people contribute to them, and where I see this phenomenon going in the future.\\n\\n# **What is a Mirror Crowdfund?**\\n\\nA crowdfund on Mirror is a simple way for someone to describe an idea, and receive support in the form of Ethereum token contributions (ETH) to work on it.\\n\\nWhen a backer contributes to the crowdfund, they also receive ERC20 tokens (these tokens are unique to the project being funded), in proportion to the magnitude of their contribution. \\n\\nThis token allocation creates an on-chain association between the backers and the project - uniting them an on-chain collective, bound by the crowdfund contract (and empowered by its embedded and embeddable functionality). Backers are able to \\\"burn\\\" their tokens at any time, in exchange for any underlying ETH in the contract.\\n\\n## How does a Mirror Crowdfund Differ from a \\\"Web2\\\" Crowdfund?\\n\\nMirror's crowdfunding tool is built on Ethereum, which makes it different from web2 problems (such as Kickstarter) across multiple paradigms. For example: \\n\\n1. **Lower friction:** Users don't need to create an account on Mirror (or even enter a credit card) to back a crowdfund. Backers use their own Ethereum account that controls their funds, and they contribute from that account. As long as someone is already an Ethereum user, this lowers the friction of contributing to a crowdfund substantially.\\n2. **Global:** Anyone from around the world can participate in the crowdfund within a minute of its launch.\\n3. **Equity, community, voice:** Users become associated through the crowdfund through the ERC20 token they receive in response to their contribution. Once the ERC20 token has been minted, they can use it like any other standard Ethereum token; they can transfer it to other accounts, trade it on Uniswap, use it for on-chain governance, etc.\\n4. **Transparent:** All contributions are publicly auditable on the blockchain. Crowdfund details are displayed in Mirror's embeddable \\\"economic blocks\\\" that live-update with each contribution, displaying the backer's Twitter profile and the amount they contributed. This creates a lasting record of the community that formed around the crowdfund.\\n5. **Integrative and Permissionless:** The crowdfund contract itself can be connected bidirectionally with other protocols on Ethereum, such as an NFT contract (by setting the NFT contract's funding recipient to be the crowdfund), or a [Split](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw). The crowdfund contract can thereby grow connections with other economic tools found on Ethereum - becoming the heart of a sophisticated system of capital flow.\\n\\n# Crowdfund Results\\n\\nThe total amount raised is over 118 ETH. The USD value fluctuates with the price of Ethereum, but at the time of writing this amounts to over $309,000.\\n\\nAll campaigns so far have been artificially capped, so that we can maximize learning with limited risk. In includes total contribution amounts, as well as for individual contributions.\\n\\nThe majority of funds have been raised for writers; for essays, books, and newsletters. The bias towards writing is probably because Mirror has brand awareness with crypto-adjacent publishers (our homepage and Twitter account market the application as a publishing platform). Writers have raised over 80 ETH ($215,000) on Mirror so far for these writing-related projects.\\n\\nSoftware projects have also drawn a considerable amount; 32 ETH has been raised. We've also had one non-digital public goods funding campaign so far, for a non-profit related to outdoor conservation.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/92e78f28-6c2a-4e43-9313-5a92569e2b4a.jpeg?height=946&width=1682)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/53904fb5-cf76-4099-83ef-5d4d33165839.jpeg?height=1148&width=1860)\\n\\nMany of these campaigns were fulfilled in minutes or hours of their launch. For example, if we look at the public logs for the PartyDAO crowdfund, we see that it raised $90,000 (value at the time) within hours:\\n\\n![About 4 hours from contract creation to the ultimate transfer of the 25 ETH. I'm aware that some of that time was spent finding a suitable wallet in which to store the funds!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11d80bcd-34e7-4cf8-8f4b-f1c0b2660a82.jpeg?height=400&width=1968)\\n\\n$ESSAY is another clear example, where the logs indicate that funding was opened and closed with an hour:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2dd1490a-6186-4e50-a02b-5fc5d13d50d0.jpeg?height=106&width=1674)\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b73fc04d-5e6b-4c50-91fd-38495df6ad93.jpeg?height=108&width=1108)\\n\\n## Future Measurements\\n\\nIt will be critical for us to track the longevity of these projects, and to understand barriers to these communities succeeding once the project has been funded. The success of the community to fulfill its goal is, after all, the purpose of the crowdfund. I haven't included this in the current report, since we're still so early in this process.\\n\\n\\n# **Why do people contribute?**\\n\\n### Generalized and Productive Exchange\\n\\nThere are two models I've used for thinking about why people contribute. They relate to *Generalized* and *Productive* exchange, and are models that I find useful to reflect on with many of the mechanisms being built on Ethereum.\\n\\n![From Generalized Generosity: How the Norm of Generalized Reciprocity Bridges Collective Forms of Social Exchange](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e57a7431-418a-4e7d-8a51-83a2eb5ae5cf.jpeg?height=906&width=1374)\\n\\nAs we can see in the above diagrams ([Whitham, 2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00031224211007450)), *Generalized Exchange* is when people back campaigns because they are aware that they are part of a community that has trust and reciprocity norms. I think this explains why many people buy NFTs and participate in grants; they know that they're part of an exchange network that will end up moving funds around, and it'll come back to them (including token airdrops). There are many conversations on Twitter that give evidence for this.\\n\\n*Productive Exchange* happens when a contributor wants to become part of a community that is actually interdependent. The research linked above shows that this has powerful implications for trust and community building.\\n\\nI view [PartyDAO](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) as evidence for the productive exchange explanation. It turned out that many of the contributors themselves were artists, programmers, and writers, and contributed to the campaign *in order* to become formally associated with the project and with others who were involved (such as [John Palmer](https://j.mirror.xyz/), [Anish Agnihotri](http://anish.mirror.xyz/), [Denis](https://d.mirror.xyz/), [Jesse Walden](http://variant.mirror.xyz/), and [Li Jin](https://li.mirror.xyz/)) Once PartyDAO was fully funded, someone created a Discord chat for the group. Everybody introduced themselves, and started finding ways to contribute more to the project. In this sense, the crowdfund became the center of productive exchange.\\n\\n### **Patronage+**\\n\\nJesse Walden has [given a name](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo) to this new kind of interdependent funding model:\\n\\n> With regard to supporting creators, I've called this “[Patronage+](https://twitter.com/jessewldn/status/1355165547441303554)” where the “plus” is the possibility of earning value alongside the creators you support.\\n\\nEven though it's not explicitly promised, a norm of interdependence is beginning to form among crowdfunds.\\n\\n### Formal Mechanisms for Reciprocity\\nThe crowdfunding contract includes a mechanism where members can \\\"burn\\\" their crowdfund tokens by sending them back to the contract. In doing so, they receive an amount of ETH *back* equal to the percentage of the totally supply they burned, multiplied by the amount of ETH in the contract. Therefore, if the amount of ETH in the contract has increased more than the initial crowdfunding goal, members can burn their tokens to receive more ETH than contributed in the first place.\\n\\n# Future Directions\\n\\nEach time we have deployed a crowdfund, we have experimented with a new model. We're currently experimenting with combining ERC20 token reciprocation with NFT token minting as well (contributors will receive ERC20s as well as NFTs).\\n\\nWe're also thinking of doing more to serve the communities that form out of crowdfunding campaigns - to help them better coordinate and organize their resources.\\n\\n# Conclusions\\n\\nWe're seeing many unprecedented phenomena in Ethereum, enabled by embedded communities that can socially control capital and digital goods with minimal friction. \\n\\nSpecifically, this enables a unique combination of *generalized exchange* (grants, airdrops, crowdfunding) with *productive exchange* (e.g. interdependent, community-governed software projects like PartyDAO that has formal reciprocity mechanisms). There is [research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00031224211007450) to suggest that this will impact trust and community-building.\\n\\nWe're learning something new each time we deploy a new Crowdfund, and the models are improving. It's an exciting journey, and the road ahead might involve funding amazing new types of goods and products, and creating digital communities that fit a new paradigm.\",\"timestamp\":1623466680,\"title\":\"Measuring the Success of Mirror Crowdfunding\",\"publication\":\"g\"},\"digest\":\"2kCcm2uNYEcEWYMKZaOG_NI4Ws8blRiX1zNqIcVHqW8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xCC65fA278B917042822538c44ba10AD646824026\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rk_-LQyNRlnlCabqW0oRben-cH9HlKfkjHW6digSJgw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_yW3BGwG19qL821-DapfOXutKaJdseMXJ_fAafyomKI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"gP1h08IrYdIaCSWtNg6nbMU1H7BcIXxQWju5p7lJEfnXOaHWtnCs9LD5bei4SAWdEU40iORxKQhlxOFx9ELMVQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x36bc73139d52e71508ab0bfa9744d806e31e4b1c4587610d8b8a2f291f4440a53c7a325241ad157a44a53bec62242971d56331caf1b47b6f6f05ac1c76caaeed1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on dev.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rk_-LQyNRlnlCabqW0oRben-cH9HlKfkjHW6digSJgw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_yW3BGwG19qL821-DapfOXutKaJdseMXJ_fAafyomKI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"GBj7emzIN5NBNFPLV6FGfN1c7GjSaZ_wEkjm5KQy2UE\"}"
