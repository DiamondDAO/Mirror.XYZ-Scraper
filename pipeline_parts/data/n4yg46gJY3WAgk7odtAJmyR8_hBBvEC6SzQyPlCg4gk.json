Schinner\\n\\nand his wife had their own apartment at the chateau, where, by the\\n\\ncount's express orders, they were treated with all the consideration\\n\\ndue to himself. Grindot, who stayed at the steward's house, showed\\n\\nsuch respect for the great artist that neither the steward nor his\\n\\nwife had attempted to put themselves on familiar terms with him.\\n\\nMoreover, the noblest and richest people in the surrounding country\\n\\nhad vied with each other in paying attention to Schinner and his wife.\\n\\nSo, very well pleased to have, as it were, a little revenge of her\\n\\nown, Madame Moreau was determined to cry up the artist she was now\\n\\nexpecting, and to present him to her social circle as equal in talent\\n\\nto the great Schinner.\\n\\nThough for two days past Moreau's pretty wife had arrayed herself\\n\\ncoquettishly, the prettiest of her toilets had been reserved for this\\n\\nvery Saturday, when, as she felt no doubt, the artist would arrive for\\n\\ndinner. A pink gown in very narrow stripes, a pink belt with a richly\\n\\nchased gold buckle, a velvet ribbon and cross at her throat, and\\n\\nvelvet bracelets on her bare arms (Madame de Serizy had handsome arms\\n\\nand showed them much), together with bronze kid shoes and thread\\n\\nstockings, gave Madame Moreau all the appearance of an elegant\\n\\nParisian. She wore, also, a superb bonnet of Leghorn straw, trimmed\\n\\nwith a bunch of moss roses from Nattier's, beneath the spreading sides\\n\\nof which rippled the curls of her beautiful blond hair.\\n\\nAfter ordering a very choice dinner and reviewing the condition of her\\n\\nrooms, she walked about the grounds, so as to be seen standing near a\\n\\nflower-bed in the court-yard of the chateau, like the mistress of the\\n\\nhouse, on the arrival of the coach from Paris. She held above her head\\n\\na charming rose-colored parasol lined with white silk and fringed.\\n\\nSeeing that Pierrotin merely left Mistigris's queer packages with the\\n\\nconcierge, having, apparently, brought no passengers, Estelle retired\\n\\ndisappointed and regretting the trouble of making her useless toilet.\\n\\nLike many persons who are dressed in their best, she felt incapable of\\n\\nany other occupation than that of sitting idly in her salon awaiting\\n\\nthe coach from Beaumont, which usually passed about an hour after that\\n\\nof Pierrotin, though it did not leave Paris till mid-day. She was,\\n\\ntherefore, in her own apartment when the two artists walked up to the\\n\\nchateau, and were sent by Moreau himself to their rooms where they\\n\\nmade their regulation toilet for dinner. The pair had asked questions\\n\\nof their guide, the gardener, who told them so much of Moreau's beauty\\n\\nthat they felt the necessity of \\\"rigging themselves up\\\" (studio\\n\\nslang). They, therefore, put on their most superlative suits and then\\n\\nwalked over to the steward's lodge, piloted by Jacques Moreau, the\\n\\neldest son, a hardy youth, dressed like an English boy in a handsome\\n\\njacket with a turned-over collar, who was spending his vacation like a\\n\\nfish in water on the estate where his father and mother reigned as\\n\\naristocrats.\\n\\n\\\"Mamma,\\\" he said, \\\"here are the two artists sent down by Monsieur\\n\\nSchinner.\\\"\\n\\nMadame Moreau, agreeably surprised, rose, told her son to place\\n\\nchairs, and began to display her graces.\\n\\n\\\"Mamma, the Husson boy is with papa,\\\" added the lad; \\\"shall I fetch\\n\\nhim?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You need not hurry; go and play with him,\\\" said his mother.\\n\\nThe remark \\\"you need not hurry\\\" proved to the two artists the\\n\\nunimportance of their late travelling companion in the eyes of their\\n\\nhostess; but it also showed, what they did not know, the feeling of a\\n\\nstep-mother against a step-son. Madame Moreau, after seventeen years\\n\\nof married life, could not be ignorant of the steward's attachment to\\n\\nMadame Clapart and the little Husson, and she hated both mother and\\n\\nchild so vehemently that it is not surprising that Moreau had never\\n\\nbefore risked bringing Oscar to Presles.\\n\\n\\\"We are requested, my husband and myself,\\\" she said to the two\\n\\nartists, \\\"to do you the honors of the chateau. We both love art, and,\\n\\nabove all, artists,\\\" she added in a mincing tone; \\\"and I beg you to\\n\\nmake yourselves at home here.
