"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"the god of the fields. On a certain occasion Pan had the temerity to compare his music with that of Apollo, and to challenge the god of the lyre to a trial of skill.  The challenge was accepted, and Tmolus, the mountain-god, was chosen umpire.  Tmolus took his seat and cleared away the trees from his ears to listen.  At a given signal Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, Midas, who happened to be present.  Then Tmolus turned his head toward the sun-god, and all his trees turned with him.  Apollo rose, his brow wreathed with Parnassian laurel, while his robe of Tyrian purple swept the ground.  In his left hand he held the lyre, and with his right hand struck the strings.  Ravished with the harmony, Tmolus at once awarded the victory to the god of the lyre, and all but Midas acquiesced in the judgment.  He dissented, and questioned the justice of the award.  Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer to wear the human form, but caused them to increase in length, grow hairy, within and without, and to become movable, on their roots; in short, to be on the perfect pattern of those of an ass.\\n\\nMortified enough was King Midas at this mishap; but he consoled himself with the thought that it was possible to hide his misfortune, which he attempted to do by means of an ample turban or headdress.  But his hairdresser of course knew the secret.  He was charged not to mention it, and threatened with dire punishment if he presumed to disobey.  But he found it too much for his discretion to keep such a secret; so he went out into the meadow, dug a hole in the ground, and stooping down, whispered the story, and covered it up. Before long a thick bed of reeds sprang up in the meadow, and as soon as it had gained its growth, began whispering the story, and has continued to do so, from that day to this, with every breeze which passes over the place.\\n\\nThe story of King Midas has been told by others with some variations.  Dryden, in the Wife of Bath's Tale, makes Midas' queen the betrayer of the secret.\\n\\n\\\"This Midas knew, and durst communicate To none but to his wife his ears of state.\\\"\\n\\nMidas was king of Phrygia.  He was the son of Gordius, a poor countryman, who was taken by the people and made king, in obedience to the command of the oracle, which had said that their future king should come in a wagon.  While the people were deliberating, Gordius with his wife and son came driving his wagon into the public square.\\n\\nGordius, being made king, dedicated his wagon to the deity of the oracle, and tied it up in its place with a fast knot.  This was the celebrated GORDIAN KNOT, of which, in after times it was said, that whoever should untie it should become lord of all Asia.  Many tried to untie it, but none succeeded, till Alexander the Great, in his career of conquest, came to Phrygia.  He tried his skill with as ill success as the others, till growing impatient he drew his sword and cut the knot.  When he afterwards succeeded in subjecting all Asia to his sway, people began to think that he had complied with the terms of the oracle according to its true meaning.\\n\\nBAUCIS AND PHILEMON\\n\\nOn a certain hill in Phrygia stand a linden tree and an oak, enclosed by a low wall.  Not far from the spot is a marsh, formerly good habitable land, but now indented with pools, the resort of fen-birds and cormorants.  Once on a time, Jupiter, in human shape, visited this country, and with him his son Mercury (he of the caduceus), without his wings.  They presented themselves at many a door as weary travellers, seeking rest and shelter, but found all closed, for it was late, and the inhospitable inhabitants would not rouse themselves to open for their reception.  At last a humble mansion received them, a small thatched cottage, where Baucis, a pious old dame, and her husband Philemon, united when young, had grown old together.  Not ashamed of their poverty, they made it endurable by moderate desires and kind dispositions.  One need not look there for master or for servant; they two were the whole household, master and servant alike.  When the two heavenly guests crossed the humble threshold, and bowed their heads to pass under the low door, the old man placed a seat, on which Baucis, bustling and attentive, spread a cloth, and begged them to sit down.  Then she raked out the coals from the ashes, kindled up a fire, and fed it with leaves and dry bark, and with her scanty breath blew it into a flame.  She brought out of a corner split sticks and dry branches, broke them up, and placed them under the small kettle. Her husband collected some pot-herbs in the garden, and she shred them from the stalks, and prepared them for the pot He reached down with a forked stick a flitch of bacon hanging in the chimney, cut a small piece, and put it in the pot to boil with the herbs, setting away the rest for another time.  A beechen bowl was filled with warm water that their guests might wash. While all was doing they beguiled the time with conversation.\\n\\nOn the bench designed for the guests was laid a cushion stuffed with sea-weed; and a cloth, only produced on great occasions, but old and coarse enough, was spread over that.  The old woman, with her apron on, with trembling hand set the table.  One leg was shorter than the rest, but a shell put under restored the level. When fixed, she rubbed the table down with some sweet-smelling herbs.  Upon it she set some olives, Minerva's-fruit, some cornel-berries preserved in vinegar, and added radishes and cheese, with eggs lightly cooked in the ashes.  All were served in earthen dishes, and an earthenware pitcher, with wooden cups, stood beside them.  When all was ready, the stew, smoking hot, was set on the table.  Some wine, not of the oldest, was added; and for dessert, apples and wild honey; and over and above all, friendly faces, and simple but hearty welcome.\\n\\nNow while the repast proceeded, the old folks were astonished to see that the wine, as fast as it was poured out, renewed itself in the pitcher, of its own accord.  Struck with terror, Baucis and Philemon recognized their heavenly guests, fell on their knees, and with clasped hands implored forgiveness for their poor entertainment.  There was an old goose, which they kept as the guardian of their humble cottage; and they bethought them to make this a sacrifice in honor of their guests.  But the goose, too nimble for the old folks, eluded their pursuit with the aid of feet and wings, and at last took shelter between the gods themselves.  They forbade it to be slain; and spoke in these words: \\\"We are gods.  This inhospitable village shall pay the penalty of its impiety; you alone shall go free from the chastisement.  Quit your house, and come with us to the top of yonder hill.\\\"  They hastened to obey, and staff in hand, labored up the steep ascent. They had come within an arrow's flight of the top, when turning their eyes below, they beheld all the country sunk in a lake, only their own house left standing. While they gazed with wonder at the sight, and lamented the fate of their neighbors, that old house of theirs was changed into a TEMPLE.  Columns took the place of the corner-posts, the thatch grew yellow and appeared a gilded roof, the floors became marble, the doors were enriched with carving and ornaments of gold.  Then spoke Jupiter in benignant accents: \\\"Excellent old man, and woman worthy of such a husband, speak, tell us your wishes; what favor have you to ask of us?\\\"  Philemon took counsel with Baucis a few moments; then declared to the gods their united wish.  \\\"We ask to be priests and guardians of this your temple; and since here we have passed our lives in love and concord, we wish that one and the same hour may take us both from life, that I may not live to see her grave, nor be laid in my own by her.\\\"  Their prayer was granted.  They were the keepers of the temple as long as they lived.  When grown very old, as they stood one day before the steps of the sacred edifice, and were telling the story of the place, Baucis saw Philemon begin to put forth leaves, and old Philemon saw Baucis changing in like manner.  And now a leafy crown had grown over their heads, while exchanging parting words, as long as they could speak.  \\\"Farewell, dear spouse,\\\" they said, together, and at the same moment the bark closed over their mouths.  The Tyanean shepherd long showed the two trees, standing side by side, made out of the two good old people.\\n\\nThe story of Baucis and Philemon has been imitated by Swift, in a burlesque style, the actors in the change being two wandering saints and the house being changed into a church, of which Philemon is made the parson The following may serve as a specimen:--\\n\\n\\\"They scarce had spoke when, fair and soft, The roof began to mount aloft; Aloft rose every beam and rafter; The heavy wall climbed slowly after. The chimney widened and grew higher, Became a steeple with a spire. The kettle to the top was hoist, And there stood fastened to a joist, But with the upside down, to show Its inclination for below; In vain, for a superior force, Applied at bottom, stops its course; Doomed ever in suspense to dwell, 'Tis now no kettle, but a bell. A wooden jack, which had almost Lost by disuse the art to roast, A sudden alteration feels, Increased by new intestine wheels; And, what exalts the wonder more, The number made the motion slower; The flier, though 't had leaden feet, Turned round so quick you scarce could see 't: But slackened by some secret power, Now hardly moves an inch an hour. The jack and chimney, near allied, Had never left each other's side. The chimney to a steeple grown, The jack would not be left alone; But up against the steeple reared, Became a clock, and still adhered; And still its love to household cares By a shrill voice at noon declares. Warning the cook-maid not to burn That roast meat which it cannot turn. The groaning chair began to crawl, Like a huge snail, along the wall; There stuck aloft in public view, And, with small change, a pulpit grew. A bedstead of the antique mode, Compact of timber many a load, Such as our ancestors did use, Was metamorphosed into pews, Which still their ancient nature keep By lodging folks disposed to sleep.\\\"\\n\\nPROSERPINE\\n\\nUnder the island of Aetna lies Typhoeus the Titan, in punishment for his share in the rebellion of the giants against Jupiter. Two mountains press down   the one his right and the other his left hand   while Aetna lies over his head.  As Typhoeus moves, the earth shakes; as he breathes, smoke and ashes come up from Aetna.  Pluto is terrified at the rocking of the earth, and fears that his kingdom will be laid open to the light of day.  He mounts his chariot with the four black horses and comes up to earth and looks around.  While he is thus engaged, Venus, sitting on Mount Eryx playing with her boy Cupid, sees him and says: \\\"My son, take your darts with which you conquer all, even Jove himself, and send one into the breast of yonder dark monarch, who rules the realm of Tartarus.  Why should he alone escape?  Seize the opportunity to extend your empire and mine.  Do you not see that even in heaven some despise our power?  Minerva the wise, and Diana the huntress, defy us; and there is that daughter of Ceres, who threatens to follow their example.  Now do you, if you have any regard for your own interest or mine, join these two in one.\\\"  The boy unbound his quiver, and selected his sharpest and truest arrow; then, straining the bow against his knee, he attached the string, and, having made ready, shot the arrow with its barbed point right into the heart of Pluto.\\n\\nIn the vale of Enna there is a lake embowered in woods, which screen it from the fervid rays of the sun, while the moist ground is covered with flowers, and spring reigns perpetual.  Here Proserpine was playing with her companions, gathering lilies and violets, and filling her basket and her apron with them, when Pluto saw her from his chariot, loved her, and carried her off. She screamed for help to her mother and her companions; and when in her fright she dropped the corners of her apron and let the flowers fall, childlike, she felt the loss of them as an addition to her grief.  The ravisher urged on his steeds, calling them each by name, and throwing loose over their heads and necks his iron-colored reins.  When he reached the River Cyane, and it opposed his passage, he struck the river bank with his trident, and the earth opened and gave him a passage to Tartarus.\\n\\nCeres sought her daughter all the world over.  Bright-haired Aurora, when she came forth in the morning, and Hesperus, when he led out the stars in the evening, found her still busy in the search.  But it was all unavailing.  At length, weary and sad, she sat down upon a stone and continued sitting nine days and nights, in the open air, under the sunlight and moonlight and falling showers.  It was where now stands the city of Eleusis, then the home of an old man named Celeus.  He was out in the field, gathering acorns and blackberries, and sticks for his fire.  His little girl was driving home their two goats, and as she passed the goddess, who appeared in the guise of an old woman, she said to her, \\\"Mother,\\\" and the name was sweet to the ears of Ceres, \\\"why do you sit here alone upon the rocks?\\\"  The old man also stopped, though his load was heavy, and begged her to come into his cottage, such as it was.  She declined, and he urged her.  \\\"Go in peace,\\\" she replied, \\\"and be happy in your daughter; I have lost mine.\\\"  As she spoke, tears   or something like tears, for the gods never weep   fell down her cheeks upon her bosom.  The compassionate old man and his child wept with her.  Then said he, \\\"Come with us, and despise not our humble roof; so may your daughter be restored to you in safety.\\\"  \\\"Lead on,\\\" said she, \\\"I cannot resist that appeal!\\\"  So she rose from the stone and went with them.  As they walked he told her that his only son, a little boy, lay very sick, feverish and sleepless.  She stooped and gathered some poppies.  As they entered the cottage they found all in great distress, for the boy seemed past hope of recovery.  Metanira, his mother, received her kindly, and the goddess stooped and kissed the lips of the sick child.  Instantly the paleness left his face, and healthy vigor returned to his body.  The whole family were delighted   that is, the father, mother, and little girl, for they were all; they had no servants. They spread the table, and put upon it curds and cream, apples, and honey in the comb.  While they ate, Ceres mingled poppy juice in the milk of the boy.  When night came and all was still, she arose, and taking the sleeping boy, moulded his limbs with her hands, and uttered over him three times a solemn charm, then went and laid him in the ashes.  His mother, who had been watching what her guest was doing, sprang forward with a cry and snatched the child from the fire.  Then Ceres assumed her own form, and a divine splendor shone all around. While they were overcome with astonishment, she said, \\\"Mother, you have been cruel in your fondness to your son.  I would have made him immortal, but you have frustrated my attempt. Nevertheless, he shall be great and useful.  He shall teach men the use of the plough, and the rewards which labor can win from the cultivated soil.\\\"  So saying, she wrapped a cloud about her, and mounting her chariot rode away.\\n\\nCeres continued her search for her daughter, passing from land to land, and across seas and rivers, till at length she returned to Sicily, whence she at first set out, and stood by the banks of the River Cyane, where Pluto made himself a passage with his prize to his own dominions.\\n\\nThe river-nymph would have told the goddess all she had witnessed, but dared not, for fear of Pluto; so she only ventured to take up the girdle which Proserpine had dropped in her flight, and waft it to the feet of the mother.  Ceres, seeing this, was no longer in doubt of her loss, but she did not yet know the cause, and laid the blame on the innocent land.  \\\"Ungrateful soil,\\\" said she, \\\"which I have endowed with fertility and clothed with herbage and nourishing grain, No more shall you enjoy my favors\\\" Then the cattle died, the plough broke in the furrow, the seed failed to come up; there was too much sun, there was too much rain; the birds stole the seeds,   thistles and brambles were the only growth.  Seeing this, the fountain Arethusa interceded for the land.  \\\"Goddess,\\\" said she, \\\"blame not the land; it opened unwillingly to yield a passage to your daughter. I can tell you of her fate, for I have seen her.  This is not my native country; I came hither from Elis.  I was a woodland nymph, and delighted in the chase.  They praised my beauty, but I cared nothing for it, and rather boasted of my hunting exploits.  One day I was returning from the wood, heated with exercise, when I came to a stream silently flowing, so clear that you might count the pebbles on the bottom.  The willows shaded it, and the grassy bank sloped down to the water's edge.  I approached, I touched the water with my foot.  I stepped in knee-deep, and not content with that, I laid my garments on the willows and went in.  While I sported in the water, I heard an indistinct murmur coming up as out of the depths of the stream; and made haste to escape to the nearest bank.  The voice said, 'Why do you fly, Arethusa?  I am Alpheus, the god of this stream.'  I ran, he pursued; he was not more swift than I, but he was stronger, and gained upon me, as my strength failed.  At last, exhausted, I cried for help to Diana. 'Help me, goddess!  Help your votary!'  The goddess heard, and wrapped me suddenly in a thick cloud.  The river-god looked now this way and now that, and twice came close to me, but could not find me.  'Arethusa!  Arethusa!' he cried.  Oh, how I trembled, like a lamb that hears the wolf growling outside the fold.  A cold sweat came over me, my hair flowed down in streams; where my foot stood there was a pool.  In short, in less time than it takes to tell it I became a fountain.  But in this form Alpheus knew me, and attempted to mingle his stream with mine.  Diana cleft the ground, and I, endeavoring to escape him, plunged into the cavern, and through the bowels of the earth came out here in Sicily.  While I passed through the lower parts of the earth, I saw your Proserpine.  She was sad, but no longer showing alarm in her countenance.  Her look was such as became a queen,   the queen of Erebus; the powerful bride of the monarch of the realms of the dead.\\\"\\n\\nWhen Ceres heard this, she stood for a while like one stupefied; then turned her chariot towards heaven, and hastened to present herself before the throne of Jove.  She told the story of her bereavement, and implored Jupiter to interfere to procure the restitution of her daughter.  Jupiter consented on one condition, namely, that Proserpine should not during her stay in the lower world have taken any food; otherwise, the Fates forbade her release.  Accordingly, Mercury was sent, accompanied by Spring, to demand Proserpine of Pluto.  The wily monarch consented; but alas! the maiden had taken a pomegranate which Pluto offered her, and had sucked the sweet pulp from a few of the seeds.  This was enough to prevent her complete release; but a compromise was made, by which she was to pass half the time with her mother, and the rest with her husband Pluto.\\n\\nCeres allowed herself to be pacified with this arrangement, and restored the earth to her favor.  Now she remembered Celeus and his family, and her promise to his infant son Triptolemus.  When the boy grew up, she taught him the use of the plough, and how to sow the seed.  She took him in her chariot, drawn by winged dragons, through all the countries of the earth, imparting to mankind valuable grains, and the knowledge of agriculture.  After his return, Triptolemus build a magnificent temple to Ceres in Eleusis, and established the worship of the goddess, under the name of the Eleusinian mysteries, which, in the splendor and solemnity of their observance, surpassed all other religious celebrations among the Greeks.\\n\\nThere can be little doubt but that this story of Ceres and Proserpine is an allegory.  Proserpine signifies the seed-corn, which, when cast into the ground, lies there concealed,   that is, she is carried off by the god of the underworld; it reappears,   that is, Proserpine is restored to her mother. Spring leads her back to the light of day.\\n\\nMilton alludes to the story of Proserpine in Paradise lost, Book IV.:\\n\\n\\\"Not that fair field Of Enna where Proserpine gathering flowers, Herself a fairer flower, by gloomy Dis (a name for Pluto) Was gathered, which cost Ceres all that pain To seek her through the world, . . . . might with this Paradise Of Eden strive.\\\"\\n\\nHood, in his Ode to Melancholy, uses the same allusion very beautifully:\\n\\n\\\"Forgive, if somewhile I forget, In woe to come the present bliss; As frightened Proserpine let fall Her flowers at the sight of Dis.\\\"\\n\\nThe River Alpheus does in fact disappear under ground, in part of its course, finding its way through subterranean channels, till it again appears on the surface.  It was said that the Sicilian fountain Arethusa was the same stream, which, after passing under the sea, came up again in Sicily.  Hence the story ran that a cup thrown into the Alpheus appeared again in Arethusa.  It is this fable of the underground course of Alpheus that Coleridge alludes to in his poem of Kubla Khan:\\n\\n\\\"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure-dome decree, Where Alph, the sacred river, ran Through caverns measureless to man, Down to a sunless sea.\\\"\\n\\nIn one of Moore's juvenile poems he alludes to the same story, and to the practice of throwing garlands, or other light objects on the stream to be carried downward by it, and afterwards thrown out when the river comes again to light.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, my beloved, how divinely sweet Is the pure joy when kindred spirits meet! Like him the river-god, whose waters flow, With love their only light, through caves below, Wafting in triumph all the flowery braids And festal rings, with which Olympic maids Have decked his current, as an offering meet To lay at Arethusa's shining feet. Think, when he meets at last his fountain bride, What perfect love must thrill the blended tide! Each lost in each, till mingling into one, Their lot the same for shadow or for sun, A type of true love, to the deep they run.\\\"\\n\\nThe following extract from Moore's Rhymes on the Road gives an account of a celebrated picture by Albano at Milan, called a Dance of Loves:\\n\\n\\\"'Tis for the theft of Enna's flower from earth These urchins celebrate their dance of mirth, Round the green tree, like fays upon a heath, Those that are nearest linked in order bright, Cheek after cheek, like rosebuds in a wreath; And those more distant showing from beneath The others' wings their little eyes of light. While see! Among the clouds, their eldest brother, But just flown up, tells with a smile of bliss, This prank of Pluto to his charmed mother, Who turns to greet the tidings with a kiss.\\\"\\n\\nGLAUCUS AND SCYLLA\\n\\nGlaucus was a fisherman.  One day he had drawn his nets to land, and had taken a great many fishes of various kinds.  So he emptied his net, and proceeded to sort the fishes on the grass. The place where he stood was a beautiful island in the river, a solitary spot, uninhabited, and not used for pasturage of cattle, nor ever visited by any but himself.  On a sudden, the fishes, which had been laid on the grass, began to revive and move their fins as if they were in the water; and while he looked on astonished, they one and all moved off to the water, plunged in and swam away.  He did not know what to make of this, whether some god had done it, or some secret power in the herbage.  \\\"What herb has such a power?\\\" he exclaimed; and gathering some, he tasted it.  Scarce had the juices of the plant reached his palate when he found himself agitated with a longing desire for the water.  He could no longer restrain himself, but bidding farewell to earth, he plunged into the stream.  The gods of the water received him graciously, and admitted him to the honor of their society.  They obtained the consent of Oceanus and Tethys, the sovereigns of the sea, that all that was mortal in him should be washed away.  A hundred rivers poured their waters over him . Then he lost all sense of his former nature and all consciousness.  When he recovered, he found himself changed in form and mind.  His hair was sea-green, and trailed behind him on the water; his shoulders grew broad, and what had been thighs and legs assumed the form of a fish's tail.  The sea-gods complimented him on the change of his appearance, and he himself was pleased with his looks.\\n\\nOne day Glaucus saw the beautiful maiden Scylla, the favorite of the water-nymphs, rambling on the shore, and when she had found a sheltered nook, laving her limbs in the clear water.  He fell in love with her, and showing himself on the surface, spoke to her, saying such things as he thought most likely to win her to stay; for she turned to run immediately on sight of him and ran till she had gained a cliff overlooking the sea.  Here she stopped and turned round to see whether it was a god or a sea-animal, and observed with wonder his shape and color.  Glaucus, partly emerging from the water, and supporting himself against a rock, said, \\\"Maiden, I am no monster, nor a sea-animal, but a god; and neither Proteus nor Triton ranks higher than I.  Once I was a mortal, and followed the sea for a living; but now I belong wholly to it.\\\"  Then he told the story of his metamorphosis and how he had been promoted to his present dignity, and added, \\\"But what avails all this if it fails to move your heart?\\\"  He was going on in this strain, but Scylla turned and hastened away.\\n\\nGlaucus was in despair, but it occurred to him to consult the enchantress, Circe.  Accordingly he repaired to her island,   the same where afterwards Ulysses landed, as we shall see in another story.  After mutual salutations, he said, \\\"Goddess, I entreat your pity; you alone can relieve the pain I suffer.  The power of herbs I know as well as any one, for it is to them I owe my change of form I love Scylla.  I am ashamed to tell you how I have sued and promised to her, and how scornfully she has treated me.  I beseech you to use your incantations, or potent herbs, if they are more prevailing, not to cure me of my love,   for that I do not wish,   but to make her share it and yield me a like return.\\\"  To which Circe replied, for she was not insensible to the attractions of the sea-green deity, \\\"You had better pursue a willing object; you are worthy to be sought, instead of having to seek in vain.  Be not diffident, know your own worth.  I protest to you that even I, goddess though I be, and learned in the virtues of plants and spells, should not know how to refuse you If she scorns you, scorn her; meet one who is ready to meet you half way, and thus make a due return to both at once.\\\"  To these words Glaucus replied, \\\"Sooner shall trees grow at the bottom of the ocean, and seaweed on the top of the mountains, than I will cease to love Scylla, and her alone.\\\"\\n\\nThe goddess was indignant, but she could not punish him, neither did she wish to do so, for she liked him too well; so she turned all her wrath against her rival, poor Scylla.  She took plants of poisonous powers and mixed them together, with incantations and charms.  Then she passed through the crowd of gambolling beasts, the victims of her art, and proceeded to the coast of Sicily, where Scylla lived.  There was a little bay on the shore to which Scylla used to resort, in the heat of the day, to breathe the air of the sea, and to bathe in its waters.  Here the goddess poured her poisonous mixture, and muttered over it incantations of mighty power.  Scylla came as usual and plunged into the water up to her waist.  What was her horror to perceive a brood of serpents and barking monsters surrounding her!  At first she could not imagine they were a part of herself, and tried to run from them, and to drive them away; but as she ran she carried them with her, and when she tried to touch her limbs, she found her hands touch only the yawning jaws of monsters.  Scylla remained rooted to the spot.  Her temper grew as ugly as her form, and she took pleasure in devouring hapless mariners who came within her grasp.  Thus she destroyed six of the companions of Ulysses, and tried to wreck the ships of Aeneas, till at last she was turned into a rock, and as such still continues to be a terror to mariners.\\n\\nThe following is Glaucus's account of his feelings after his \\\"sea-change:\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I plunged for life or death.  To interknit One's senses with so dense a breathing stuff Might seem a work of pain; so not enough Can I admire how crystal-smooth it felt, And buoyant round my limbs.  At first I dwelt Whole days and days in sheer astonishment; Forgetful utterly of self-9ntent, Moving but with the mighty ebb and flow. Then like a new-fledged bird that first doth show His spreaded feathers to the morrow chill, I tried in fear the pinions of my well. \\\"Twas freedom!  And at once I visited The ceaseless wonders of this ocean-bed.\\\" Keats.\\n\\nChapter V Pygmalion.   Dryope.   Venus and Adonis.   Apollo and Hyacinthus.   Ceyx and Halcyone.\\n\\nPygmalion saw so much to blame in women that he came at last to abhor the sex, and resolved to live unmarried.  He was a sculptor, and had made with wonderful skill a statue of ivory, so beautiful that no living woman could be compared to it in beauty. It was indeed the perfect semblance of a maiden that seemed to be alive, and only prevented from moving by modesty.  His art was so perfect that it concealed itself, and its product looked like the workmanship of nature.  Pygmalion admired his own work, and at last fell in love with the counterfeit creation.  Oftentimes he laid his hand upon it, as if to assure himself whether it were living or not, and could not even then believe that it was only ivory.  He caressed it, and gave it presents such as young girls love,   bright shells and polished stones, little birds and flowers of various hues, beads and amber.  He put raiment on its limbs, and jewels on its fingers, and a necklace about its neck. To the ears he hung earrings and strings of pearls upon the breast.  Her dress became her, and she looked not less charming than when unattired.  He laid her on a couch spread with cloths of Tyrian dye, and called her his wife, and put her head upon a pillow of the softest feathers, as if she could enjoy their softness.\\n\\nThe festival of Venus was at hand,   a festival celebrated with great pomp at Cyprus.  Victims were offered, the altars smoked, and the odor of incense filled the air.  When Pygmalion had performed his part in the solemnities, he stood before the altar and timidly said, \\\"Ye gods, who can do all things, give me, I pray you, for my wife\\\"   he dared not say \\\"my ivory virgin,\\\" but said instead   \\\"one like my ivory virgin.\\\"  Venus, who was present at the festival, heard him and knew the thought he would have uttered; and, as an omen of her favor, caused the flame on the altar to shoot up thrice in a fiery point into the air.  When he returned home, he went to see his statue, and, leaning over the couch, gave a kiss to the mouth.  It seemed to be warm.  He pressed its lips again, he laid his hand upon the limbs; the ivory felt soft to his touch, and yielded to his fingers like the wax of Hymettus.  While he stands astonished and glad, though doubting, and fears he may be mistaken, again and again with a lover's ardor he touches the object of his hopes.  It was indeed alive!  The veins when pressed yielded to the finger and then resumed their roundness.  Then at last the votary of Venus found words to thank the goddess, and pressed his lips upon lips as real as his own.  The virgin felt the kisses and blushed, and, opening her timid eyes to the light, fixed them at the same moment on her lover.  Venus blessed the nuptials she had formed, and from this union Paphos was born, from whom the city, sacred to Venus, received its name.\\n\\nSchiller, in his poem, the Ideals, applies this tale of Pygmalion to the love of nature in a youthful heart.  In Schiller's version, as in William Morris's, the statue is of marble.\\n\\n\\\"As once with prayers in passion flowing, Pygmalion embraced the stone, Till from the frozen marble glowing, The light of feeling o'er him shone, So did I clasp with young devotion Bright Nature to a poet's heart; Till breath and warmth and vital motion Seemed through the statue form to dart.\\n\\n\\\"And then in all my ardor sharing, The silent form expression found; Returned my kiss of youthful daring, And understood my heart's quick sound. Then lived for me the bright creation. The silver rill with song was rife; The trees, the roses shared sensation, An echo of my boundless life.\\\" Rev. A. G.
