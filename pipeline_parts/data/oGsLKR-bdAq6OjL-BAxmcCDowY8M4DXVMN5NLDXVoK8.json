"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Despite eGirl’s unusual structure for a VC firm—its partners don’t take any money from outside investors, preferring to spend the money they previously made trading shitcoins—it has made some impression in the crypto VC world, having invested up to $10 million, according to CL (the cat, lol), in a range of serious projects, including DeFi protocol [Alchemix](https://decrypt.co/84858/is-defi-2-0-a-thing-yet) and NFT project [Unisocks](https://decrypt.co/58082/people-are-selling-digital-socks-for-92000-on-ethereums-uniswap). Just this month, eGirl [participated](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/11/11/2332775/0/en/Saddle-Raises-7-5-Million-in-Funding-Round-From-Polychain-and-Electric-Capital-to-Expand-Automated-Market-Maker-Capabilities.html) in a $7.5 million round led by the colossal Polychain Capital. \\n\\nMost of eGirl’s investments are still in their early stages, so it's too early to talk of any legendary exits. But people are taking eGirl Capital seriously. \\n\\nAs they well should! \\n\\nIt began as a literal joke, in 2019, when CL photoshopped a real life press release announcing a funding round to include an obviously fictional firm, “eGirl Capital,” alongside the actual investors listed. (An “eGirl” is an exaggerated persona adopted by a woman online, often for the purpose of titillating a fanbase of pathetic “simps.”) Within months, as a continuation of the joke, a group of friendly Crypto Twitter traders decided to form an eGirl Capital group chat. Quickly, the chat grew to include various veteran traders who had interacted on Twitter, including Mewny, whose online avatar resembles the Pokémon Ditto, transformed into a sofa; Hedgedhog, who roleplays as Sonic the Hedgehog; and DegenSpartan, a Hentai fanatic. The chat proved so successful—or fun, or whatever—that Eva Beylin, an influential figure in Ethereum and one of eGirl Capital’s three “doxxed” members, went on to incorporate  eGirl as a real company, eGirl Capital, LLC, in her name, “somewhere in the Caribbean.” \",\"timestamp\":1638701972,\"title\":\"Most of eGirl’s investments\"},\"digest\":\"UtpweWo_d6rlcelIDMsWJ9YXyZ_OhsZnKPyvi5Ps_DQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xE683FB3Ea5023628218b717156AF2c573fDc24df\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"e1XyJBg8bgfTxsio-Whk093jAXyhHgi580k8IlNp9TQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AMV67sw-vCR90-p3a1mntSvoeZeafd87LAFHLD1P2jo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"tyN-Lm07tC3JxMYrD2XpXF-tZ4n4GhEvH2fBoonghimtHEF1zvsrtcB1lb9In5SbxLC2iC7v-4-JACWQK12xJg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2829a5c3e3a88b622bcd0ef7bc0f67e12d7c54867794048ba8b84905236b7aa75aeeec8be24b1fcae3853e28c277c601fd2e29cfb1ced148156123173ccaf95c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"e1XyJBg8bgfTxsio-Whk093jAXyhHgi580k8IlNp9TQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AMV67sw-vCR90-p3a1mntSvoeZeafd87LAFHLD1P2jo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"UtpweWo_d6rlcelIDMsWJ9YXyZ_OhsZnKPyvi5Ps_DQ\"}"
