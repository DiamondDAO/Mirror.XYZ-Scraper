"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"On December 25, 2021, Theopendao announced an airdrop of SOS tokens for Opensea users in the amount of 100 trillion. 50% of these tokens were airdropped to users who had previously traded on Opensea, and these users were given a corresponding amount of SOS tokens based on the weight generated by their trading volume and turnover on Opensea.\\n\\nTheopendao's action seems to be another meme token hype using Opensea's traffic. However, after 24 hours of experience, I have a deeper perspective on the matter.\\n\\n![theopendao](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4xrjvFSJH-YIVKKZ_70X4.png?height=876&width=1714)\\n\\n### The current state of most projects\\n\\n1,VCs and institutions are prioritized to enter the market, and users can only choose to take over.\\n\\n2,Most projects earn money from users (such as fees, etc.), and then distribute the money to VCs or project parties.\\n\\n3,A project or system, they can be divided into VC + project side (team) + users. The most important component and source of income is the user.\\n\\n4,The users support the project or system, but the users are exploited all the time, and the money is made by the VC and the project.\\n\\n### So users started a revolution\\n\\nThe fact that opensea wanted to do an IPO without airdropping to users was a trigger. The users supported theopensea and its revenue stream, which was distributed to theopensea's VCs and project owners, while the users got nothing, which made theopensea's users angry.\\n\\ntheopendao designed a weight of transaction volume and transaction amount to airdrop to opensea's users, and it took only 24 hours to get a positive response from users all over the network.\\n\\nSome users proposed in theopendao's discord to conduct an open recruitment for the whole world and build a team to replicate an opensensea, that is, an opensensea belonging to the users.\\n\\nThis undoubtedly poses a threat to the survival of the opensensea, because the users have set up a DAO organization that is ready to recreate an opensensea that can serve itself, and the profits of this opensensea are shared with the users.\\n\\n### If the revolution spreads on the blockchain\\n\\nImagine what other projects are now doing the same thing as opensea, making profits from users and then sharing them with VCs and project owners.\\n\\nMetamask (transaction fees are distributed between VCs and projects)\\n\\nMatcha? (no fees yet, but there is VC investment and no token offering)\\n\\nUniswap (although there is a token issue, but the transaction user does not get any payment)\\n\\nOr do all projects with VC investment face being revolutionized?\\n\\n### Whether the revolution will happen off-chain\\n\\nWe also discussed whether such a revolution will happen off-chain. For example, if Nesher's Tea, which went public some time ago, should they give users airdrops and every user who has bought milk tea from their store should receive an airdrop of their tokens? Because users are their source of profit, shouldn't they repay them with real action?\\n\\n### The above text is not tokens I agree with these views, just personal speculation.\",\"timestamp\":1640424838,\"title\":\"How SOS is leading the revolution\"},\"digest\":\"zonOIPn1ai2h0lLxQonMCQxiRO-jHwCNjsPifV7MyTk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6d4e4b349E381CAB8f4f81c4Bc9B509Fe63C5EF9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"KTHaieQhI8xZUR-rkca3UkJLQpmy6RaVij4CJY4xtxk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QA8XY-1edOs5NRctZQZX1P-KYeTsT7_YcWi5WnRA_Ug\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"y6koFNUcBQKO-F-ceyni_YC9N3TN226Q2uVvpeLXYhofGhbt8cPTmUyZIaxHsGIbKGPBee-FLzpU4DVYCPF-IA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc7679332ca3feb083c4849fdac977df7b4b0a61a88615e82705ba7d7a4c17f9c556622618d0d4934c710ab8840474e2377f90322efbdb89e94efacc27a3141791c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"KTHaieQhI8xZUR-rkca3UkJLQpmy6RaVij4CJY4xtxk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QA8XY-1edOs5NRctZQZX1P-KYeTsT7_YcWi5WnRA_Ug\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rom95rNZgBF_UZDRdTeZ9CjQ_jx2_hAkiwd0bI1O7PY\"}"
