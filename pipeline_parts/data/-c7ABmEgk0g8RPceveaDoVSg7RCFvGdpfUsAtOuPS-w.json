"{\"content\":{\"body\":\", while rapidly making\\nhis cocktail disappear, \\\"the Callisto's cost with its outfit will\\nbe very great, especially if you use glucinum, which, though the\\nideal metal for the purpose, comes pretty high?  I suggest that\\nyou apply to Congress for an appropriation.  This experiment\\ncomes under the 'Promotion of Science Act,' and any bill for it\\nwould certainly pass.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, indeed,\\\" replied Ayrault; \\\"the Callisto trip will be a\\nprivilege and glory I would not miss, and building her will be a\\npart of it.  I shall put in everything conducive to success, but\\nwill come to the Government only for advice.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will send a letter to all our ambassadors and consuls,\\\" said\\nStillman, \\\"to telegraph the department anything they may know or\\nlearn that will be of use in adjusting the batteries, controlling\\nthe machine, or anything else, and will turn over to you in a\\nsuccinct form all information that may be relevant, for without\\nsuch sorting you would be overwhelmed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And I,\\\" said Deepwaters, \\\"will order the commanders of our\\nvessels to give you a farewell salute at starting, and to pick\\nyou up in case you fail.  When you have demonstrated the\\nsuitability of apergy,\\\" he continued, \\\"and the habitability of\\nJupiter and Saturn--,which, with their five and eight moons,\\nrespectively, and rings thrown in, must both be vastly superior\\nto our little second-rate globe--we will see what can be done\\ntowards changing our orbit, and if we cannot swing a little\\nnearer to our new world or worlds.  Then we'll lower, or rather\\nraise, the boats in the shape of numerous Callistos, and have a\\nlanding-party ready at each opposition, while a man or two can be\\nplaced in charge of each projectile to bring it back in ballast.\\nThus we may soon have regular interplanetary lines.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As every place seems to have been settled from some other,\\\" said\\nCortlandt, \\\"I do not see why, with increased scientific\\nfacilities, history should not repeat itself, and this be the\\npoint from which to colonize the solar system; for, for the\\npresent at least, it would seem that we could not get beyond\\nthat.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As it will be quite an undertaking to change the orbit, said\\nDeepwaters, \\\"we shall have time meanwhile to absorb or run out\\nall inferior races, so that we shall not make the mistake of\\nextending the Tower of Babel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is putting on his war-paint,\\\" said Stillman, \\\"and will soon\\nwant a planet to himself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I see no necessity for even changing the orbit,\\\" said\\nBearwarden, \\\"except for the benefit of those that remain.  If\\nthis attempt succeeds, it can doubtless be repeated.  An increase\\nin eccentricity would merely shorten the journey, if aphelion\\nalways coincided with opposition, which it would not.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let us know how you are getting on,\\\" said Deepwaters to Ayrault,\\n\\\"and be sure you have the Callisto properly christened.  Step\\nlively there, landlubbers!\\\" he called to Stillman; \\\"I have an\\nappointment at Washington at one, and it is now twenty minutes\\npast twelve.  We can lunch on the way.\\\"\\n\\nAyrault immediately advertised for bids for the construction of a\\nglucinum cylinder twenty-five feet in diameter, fifteen feet high\\nat the sides, with a domed roof, bringing up the total height to\\ntwenty-one feet, and with a small gutter about it to catch the\\nrain on Jupiter or any other planet they might visit.  The sides,\\nroof, and floor were to consist of two sheets, each one third of\\nan inch thick and six inches apart, the space between to be\\nfilled with mineral wool, as a protection against the intense\\ncold of space.  There were also to be several keels and supports\\nunderneath, on which the car should rest.  Large, toughened\\nplate-glass windows were to be let into the roof and sides, and\\nsmaller ones in the floor, all to be furnished with thick shades\\nand curtains.  Ayrault also decided to have it divided into two\\nstories, with ceilings six and a half to seven and a half feet\\nhigh, respectively, with a sort of crow's nest or observatory at\\nthe top; the floors to be lattice- work, like those in the\\nengine-room of a steamer, so that when the carpets were rolled up\\nthey should not greatly obstruct the view.  The wide, flat base\\nand the low centre of gravity would, he saw, be of use in\\nwithstanding the high winds that he knew often prevailed on\\nJupiter.\\n\\nAs soon as possible he awarded the contract, and then entering\\nhis smart electric trap, steered for Vassar University along what\\nwas the old post-road--though its builders would not have\\nrecognized it with its asphalt surface, straightened curves, and\\neasy grades--to ask his idol to christen the Callisto when it\\nshould be finished.\\n\\nStarting from the upper end of Central Park, he stopped to buy\\nher a bunch of violets, and then ran to Poughkeepsie in two\\nhours.\\n\\nSylvia Preston was a lovely girl, with blue eyes, brown hair, and\\nperfect figure, clear white skin, and just twenty.  She was\\ndelighted to see him, and said she would love to christen the\\nCallisto or do anything else that he wished.  \\\"But I am so sorry\\nyou are going away,\\\" she went on.  \\\"I hate to lose you for so\\nlong, and we shall not even be able to write.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why couldn't we be married now,\\\" he asked, \\\"and go to Jupiter\\nfor our honeymoon?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm afraid, dear,\\\" she answered, \\\"you would be sorry a few years\\nhence if I didn't take my degree; and, besides, as you have asked\\nthose other men, there wouldn't be room for me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We could have made other arrangements,\\\" he replied, \\\"had I been\\nable to persuade you to go.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Won't you dine with us at Delmonico's this evening, and go to\\nthe play?\\\" she asked.  \\\"Papa has taken a box.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course I will,\\\" he said, brightening up.  \\\"What are you going\\nto wear?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I suppose something light and cool, for it's so hot,\\\" she\\nanswered.\\n\\n\\\"I'll go now, so as to be ready,\\\" he said, getting up and going\\ntowards the door to which Sylvia followed him.\\n\\nA man in livery stood at the step of the phaeton.  Ayrault got in\\nand turned on the current, and his man climbed up behind.\\n\\nOn turning into the main road Ayrault was about to increase his\\nspeed, when Sylvia, who had taken a short cut appeared at the\\nwayside carrying her hat in one hand and her gloves in the other.\\n\\n\\\"I couldn't let you go all by yourself,\\\" she said.  \\\"The fact is,\\nI wanted to be with you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are the sweetest thing that ever lived, and I'll love you\\nall my days,\\\" he said, getting down and helping Sylvia to the\\nseat beside him.  \\\"What a nuisance this fellow behind is!\\\" he\\ncontinued--referring to the groom-- \\\"for, though he is a Russian,\\nand speaks but little English, it is unpleasant to feel he is\\nthere.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You'll have to write your sweet nothings, instead of saying\\nthem,\\\" Sylvia replied.\\n\\n\\\"For you to leave around for other girls to see,\\\" answered\\nAyrault with a smile.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know what your other girls do,\\\" she returned, \\\"but with\\nme you are safe.\\\"\\n\\nAyrault fairly made his phaeton spin, going up the grades like a\\nshot and down like a bird.  On reaching New York, he left Sylvia\\nat her house, then ran his machine to a florist's, where he\\nordered some lilies and roses, and then steered his way to his\\nclub, where he dressed for dinner.  Shortly before the time he\\nrepaired to Delmonico's--which name had become historical, though\\nthe founders themselves were long dead--and sat guard at a table\\ntill Sylvia, wearing his flowers and looking more beautiful than\\nany of them, arrived with her mother and father, and Bearwarden,\\nwhom they knew very well.\\n\\n\\\"How are the exams getting on, Miss Preston?\\\" Bearwarden asked.\\n\\n\\\"Pretty well,\\\" she replied, with a smile.  \\\"We had English\\nliterature yesterday, and natural history the day before.  Next\\nweek we have chemistry and philosophy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What are you taking in natural history?\\\" asked Bearwarden, with\\ninterest.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, principally physical geography, geology, and meteorology,\\\"\\nshe replied.  \\\"I think them entrancing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It must be a consolation,\\\" said Ayrault, \\\"when your best hat is\\nspoiled by rain, to know the reason why.  Your average,\\\" he\\ncontinued, addressing Sylvia, \\\"was ninety in the semi-annuals,\\nand I haven't a doubt that the finals will maintain your record\\nfor the year.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't be too sure,\\\" she replied.  \\\"I have been loafing awfully,\\nand had to engage a 'grind' as a coach.\\\"\\n\\nAfter dinner they went to the play, where they saw a presentation\\nof Society at the Close of the Twentieth Century, which Sylvia\\nand Ayrault enjoyed immensely.\\n\\nA few days after the Delmonico dinner, while Bearwarden,\\nCortlandt, and Ayrault sat together discussing their plans, the\\nservant announced Ayrault's family physician, Dr. Tubercle\\nGerminy, who had been requested to call.\\n\\n\\\"Delighted to see you, doctor,\\\" said Ayrault, shaking hands.\\n\\\"You know Col. Bearwarden, our President, and Dr. Cortlandt--an\\nLL. D., however, and not a medico.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have had the pleasure,\\\" replied Dr. Germiny, shaking hands\\nwith both.\\n\\n\\\"As you may be aware, doctor,\\\" said Ayrault, when they were\\nseated, \\\"we are about to take a short trip to Jupiter, and, if\\ntime allows, to Saturn.  We have come to you, as one familiar\\nwith every known germ, for a few precautionary suggestions and\\nadvice concerning our medicine-chest.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Indeed!\\\" replied Dr. Germiny, \\\"a thorough knowledge of\\nbacteriology is the groundwork of therapeutics.  It is\\npractically admitted that every ailment, with the exception of\\nmechanical injuries, is the direct result of a specific germ; and\\neven in accidents and simple fractures, no matter what may be the\\nnature of the bruise, a micro-organism soon announces its\\npresence, so that if not the parent, it is the inseparable\\ncompanion, in fact the shadow, of disease.  Now, though not the\\nfirst cause in this instance, it has been indubitably proved,\\nthat much of the effect, the fever and pain, are produced and\\ncontinued by the active, omnipresent, sleepless sperm.  Either\\nkill the micrococcus or heal the wound, and you are free from\\nboth.  It being, therefore, granted that the ills of life are in\\nthe air, we have but to find the peculiar nature of the case in\\nhand, its habits, tastes, and constitution, in order to destroy\\nit.  Impoverish the soil on which it thrives, before its arrival,\\nif you can foresee the nature of the inoculation to which you\\nwill be exposed, by a dilute solution of itself, and supply it\\nonly with what it particularly dislikes.  For an already\\nestablished tubercle requiring rapid action of the blood, such as\\nmay well exist among the birds and vertebrates of Jupiter and\\nSaturn, I suggest a hypodermic rattlesnake injection, while\\nhydrocyanic acid and tarantula saliva may also come in well.  The\\ncombinations that so long destroyed us have already become our\\npanacea.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I see you have these poisons at your fingers' ends,\\\" said\\nAyrault, \\\"and we shall feel the utmost confidence in the remedies\\nand directions you prescribe.\\\"\\n\\nThey found that, in addition to their medicine-chest, they would\\nhave to make room for the following articles, and also many more:\\nsix shot-guns (three double-barrel 12-bores, three magazine\\n10-bores,) three rifles, three revolvers; a large supply of\\nammunition (explosive and solid balls), hunting-knives,\\nfishing-tackle, compass, sextant, geometrical instruments, canned\\nfood for forty days, appliance for renewing air, clothing, rubber\\nboots, apergetic apparatus, protection-wires, aneroid barometer,\\nand kodaks.\\n\\n```\\n                      CHAPTER VIII.\\n\\n                        GOOD-BYE.\\n```\\n\\nAt last the preparations were completed, and it was arranged that\\nthe Callisto should begin its journey at eleven o'clock A. M.,\\nDecember 21st--the northern hemisphere's shortest day.\\n\\nThough six months' operations could hardly be expected to have\\nproduced much change in the inclination of the earth's axis, the\\nautumn held on wonderfully, and December was pronounced very\\nmild.  Fully a million people were in and about Van Cortlandt\\nPark hours before the time announced for the start, and those\\nnear looked inquiringly at the trim little air-ship, that, having\\ndone well on the trial trip, rested on her longitudinal and\\ntransverse keels, with a battery of chemicals alongside, to make\\nsure of a full power supply.\\n\\nThe President and his Cabinet--including, of course, the shining\\nlights of the State and Navy Departments--came from Washington.\\nThese, together with Mr. and Mrs. Preston, and a number of people\\nwith passes, occupied seats arranged at the sides of the\\nplatform; while sightseers and scientists assembled from every\\npart of the world.\\n\\n\\\"There's a ship for you!\\\" said Secretary Stillman to the\\nSecretary of the Navy.  \\\"She'll not have to be dry-docked for\\nbarnacles, neither will the least breeze make the passengers\\nsick.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's all you landlubbers think of,\\\" replied Deepwaters.  \\\"I\\nremember one of the kings over in Europe said to me, as he\\nintroduced me to the queen:  'Your Secretary of State is a great\\nman, but why does he always part his hair in the middle?'\\n\\n\\\"'So that it shall not turn his head,' I replied.\\n\\n\\\"'But with so gallant and handsome an officer as you to lean\\nupon,' he answered, 'I should think he could look down on all the\\nworld.'  Whereupon I asked him what he'd take to drink.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your apology is accepted,\\\" replied Secretary Stillman.\\n\\nCortlandt also came from Washington, where, as chief of the\\nGovernment's Expert Examiners Board, he had temporary quarters.\\nBearwarden sailed over the spectators' heads in one of the\\nTerrestrial Axis Straightening Company's flying machines, while\\nAyrault, to avoid the crowd, had come to the Callisto early, and\\nwas showing the interior arrangements to Sylvia, who had\\naccompanied him.  She was somewhat piqued because at the last\\nmoment he had not absolutely insisted on carrying her off, or\\noffered, if necessary, to displace his presidential and\\nDoctor-of-Laws friends in order to make room.\\n\\n\\\"You will have an ideal trip,\\\" she said, looking over some\\nastronomical star-charts and photographic maps of Jupiter and\\nSaturn that lay on the table, with a pair of compasses, \\\"and I\\nhope you won't lose your way.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I shall need no compass to find my way back,\\\" replied Ayrault,\\n\\\"if I ever succeed in leaving this planet; neither will\\nstar-charts be necessary, for you will be a magnet stronger than\\nany compass, and, compared with my star, all others are dim.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You should write a book,\\\" said Sylvia, \\\"and put some of those\\nthings in it.\\\"  She was wearing a bunch of forget-me-nots and\\nviolets that she had cut from a small flower-garden of potted\\nplants Ayrault had sent her, which she had placed in her father's\\nconservatory.\\n\\nAt this moment the small chime clock set in the Callisto's\\nwood-work rang out quarter to eleven.  As the sounds died away,\\nSylvia became very pale, and began to regret in her womanly way\\nthat she had allowed her hero to attempt this experiment.\\n\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" she said, clinging to his arm, \\\"it was very wrong of me to\\nlet you begin this.  I was so dazzled by the splendour of your\\nscheme when I heard it, and so anxious that you should have the\\nglory of being the first to surpass Columbus, that I did not\\nrealize the full meaning.  I thought, also, you seemed rather\\nready to leave me,\\\" she added gently, \\\"and so said little; you do\\nnot know how it almost breaks my heart now that I am about to\\nlose you.  It was quixotic to let you undertake this journey.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"An undertaker would have given me his kind offices for one even\\nlonger, had I remained here,\\\" replied Ayrault.  \\\"I cannot live in\\nthis humdrum world without you.  The most sustained excitement\\ncannot even palliate what seems to me like unrequited love.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"O Dick!\\\" she exclaimed, giving him a reproachful glance, \\\"you\\nmustn't say that.  You know you have often told me my reason for\\nstaying and taking my degree was good.  My lot will be very much\\nharder than yours, for you will forget me in the excitement of\\ndiscovery and adventure; but I--what can I do in the midst of all\\nthe old associations?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Never mind, sweetheart,\\\" he said, kissing her hand, \\\"I have\\nseemed on the verge of despair all the time.\\\"\\n\\nSeeing that their separation must shortly begin, Ayrault tried to\\nassume a cheerful look; but as Sylvia turned her eyes away they\\nwere suspiciously moist.\\n\\nJust one minute before the starting-time Ayrault took Sylvia back\\nto her mother, and, after pressing her hand and having one last\\nlong look into her--or, as he considered them, HIS--deep-sea\\neyes, he returned to the Callisto, and was standing at the foot\\nof the telescopic aluminum ladder when his friends arrived.  As\\nall baggage and impedimenta bad been sent aboard and properly\\nstowed the day before, the travellers had not to do but climb to\\nand enter by the second-story window.  It distressed Bearwarden\\nthat the north pole's exact declination on the 21st day of\\nDecember, when the axis was most inclined, could not be figured\\nout by the hour at which they were to start, so as to show what\\nchange, if any, had already been brought about, but the\\nastronomers were working industriously, and promised that, if it\\nwere finished by midnight, they would telegraph the result into\\nspace by flash-light code.\\n\\nRaising his hat to his fiancee and his prospective\\nparents-in-law, Ayrault followed them up.  To draw in and fold\\nthe ladder was but the work of a moment.  As the clocks in the\\nneighbouring steeples began to strike eleven, Ayrault touched the\\nswitch that would correspond to the throttle of an engine, and\\nthe motors began to work at rapidly increasing speed.  Slowly the\\nCallisto left her resting-place as a Galatea might her pedestal,\\nonly, instead of coming down, she rose still higher.\\n\\nA large American flag hanging from the window, which, as they\\nstarted, fluttered as in a southern zephyr, soon began to flap as\\nin a stiff breeze as the car's speed increased.  With a final\\nwave, at which a battery of twenty-one field-pieces made the air\\nring with a salute, and the multitude raised a mighty cheer, they\\ndrew it in and closed the window, sealing it hermetically in\\norder to keep in the air that, had an opening remained, would\\nsoon have become rarefied.\\n\\nSylvia had waved her handkerchief with the utmost enthusiasm, in\\nspite of the sadness at her heart.  But she now had other use for\\nit in trying to hide her tears.  The Callisto was still going\\nstraight up, with a speed already as great as a cannon ball's,\\nand was almost out of sight.  The multitude then began to\\ndisperse, and Sylvia returned to her home.\\n\\nLet us now follow the Callisto.  The earth and Jupiter not being\\nexactly in opposition, as they would be if the sun, the earth,\\nand Jupiter were in line, with the earth between the two, but\\nrather as shown in the diagram, the Callisto's journey was\\nconsiderably more than 380,000,000 miles, the mean opposition\\ndistance.  As they wished to start by daylight--i. e., from the\\nside of the earth turned towards the sun--they could not steer\\nimmediately for Jupiter, but were obliged to go a few hundred\\nmiles in the direction of the sun, then change their course to\\nsomething like a tangent to the earth, and get their final right\\ndirection in swinging near the moon, since they must be\\ncomparatively near some material object to bring apergy into\\nplay.\\n\\nThe maximum power being turned on, the projectile shot from the\\nearth with tremendous and rapidly increasing speed, by the\\nshortest course--i. e., a straight line--so that for the present\\nit was not necessary to steer.  Until beyond the limits of the\\natmosphere they kept the greatest apergetic repulsion focused on\\nthe upper part of their cylinder, so that its point went first,\\nand they encountered least possible  resistance.  Looking through\\nthe floor windows, therefore, the travellers had a most superb\\nview.  The air being clear, the eastern border of North America\\nand the Atlantic were outlined as on a map, the blue of the ocean\\nand brownish colour of the land, with white snow- patches on the\\nelevations, being very marked.  The Hudson and the Sound appeared\\nas clearly  defined blue ribbons, and between and around the two\\nthey could see New York.  They also saw the ocean dotted for\\nmiles with points in which they recognized the marine spiders and\\ncruisers of the North Atlantic squadron, and the ships on the\\nhome station, which they knew were watching them through their\\nglasses.\\n\\n\\\"I see,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"that Deepwaters has been as good as his\\nword, and has his ships on the watch to rescue us in case we\\nfail.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" replied Bearwarden, \\\"he is the right sort.  When he gave\\nthat promise I knew his men would be there.\\\"\\n\\nThey soon perceived that they had reached the void of space, for,\\nthough the sun blazed with a splendour they had never before\\nseen, the firmament was intensely black, and the stars shone as\\nat midnight.  Here they began to change their course to a curve\\nbeginning with a spiral, by charging the Callisto apergetically,\\nand directing the current towards the moon, to act as an aid to\\nthe lunar attraction, while still allowing the earth to repel,\\nand their motion gradually became the resultant of the two\\nforces, the change from a straight line being so gradual,\\nhowever, that for some minutes they scarcely perceived it.  The\\ncoronal streamers about the sun, such as are visible on earth\\nduring a total eclipse, shone with a halo against the\\nultra-Cimmerian background, bursting forth to a height of twenty\\nor thirty thousand miles above the surface in vast cyclonic\\nstorms, producing so rapid a motion that a column of incandescent\\ngas may move ten thousand miles in less than ten minutes.\\nWhether these great streaks were in part electrical phenomena\\nsimilar to the aurora borealis, or entirely of intensely heated\\nmaterial thrown up by explosions within the sun's mass, they\\ncould not tell even from their point of vantage.\\n\\n\\\"I believe,\\\" said Cortlandt, pointing to the streamers, \\\"that\\nthey are masses of gas thrown beyond the sun's atmosphere, which\\nexpand enormously when the pressure to which they are subjected\\nin the sun is removed--for only in space freed from resistance\\ncould they move at such velocities, and that their brilliancy is\\nincreased by great electrical disturbance.  If they were entirely\\nthe play of electrical forces, their change of place would be\\npractically instantaneous, which, however rapid their movement,\\nis not the case.\\\"\\n\\n```\\n                        BOOK II.\\n\\n\\n                       CHAPTER I.\\n\\n                 THE LAST OF THE EARTH.\\n```\\n\\nFinding that they were rapidly swinging towards their proper\\ncourse, and that the earth in its journey about the sun would\\nmove out of their way, they divided their power between repelling\\nthe body they had left and increasing the attraction of the moon,\\nand then set about getting their house in order.\\n\\nBearwarden, having the largest appetite, was elected cook, the\\nothers sagely divining that labour so largely for himself would\\nbe no trial.  Their small but business- like-looking electric\\nrange was therefore soon in full blast, with Bearwarden in\\ncommand.  It had enough current to provide heat for cooking for\\nfour hundred hours, which was an ample margin, and it had this\\nadvantage, that, no matter how much it was used, it could not\\nexhaust the air as any other form of heat would.\\n\\nThere were also a number of sixteen-candle-power incandescent\\nlamps, so that when passing through the shadow of a planet, or at\\nnight after their arrival on Jupiter, their car would be brightly\\nilluminated.  They had also a good search-light for examining the\\ndark side of a satellite, or exploring the spaces in Saturn's\\nrings.  Having lunched sumptuously on canned chicken  soup, beef\\na la jardiniere, and pheasant that had been sent them by some of\\ntheir admirers that morning, they put the bones and the glass can\\nthat had contained the soup into the double-doored partition or\\nvestibule, placing a large sheet of cardboard to act as a wad\\nbetween the scraps and the outside door.  By pressing a button\\nthey unfastened the outside door, and the articles to be disposed\\nof were shot off by the expansion of the air between the\\ncardboard disk and the inside door; after which the outside door\\nwas drawn back to its place by a current sent through a magnet,\\nbut little power being required to reclose it with no resisting\\natmospheric pressure.  As the electricity ran along a wire\\npassing through a hermetically sealed opening in the floor, there\\nwas no way by which more air than that in the vestibule could\\nescape; and as the somewhat flat space between the doors\\ncontained less than one cubic foot, the air- pressure inside the\\nCallisto could not be materially lessened by a few openings.\\n\\n\\\"By filling the vestibule as full as possible,\\\" said Bearwarden,\\n\\\"and so displacing most of its air, we shall be able to open the\\noutside door oftener without danger of rarefaction.\\\"\\n\\nThe things they had discharged flew off with considerable speed\\nand were soon out of sight; but it was not necessary for them to\\nmove fast, provided they moved at all, for, the resistance being\\nnil, they would be sure to go beyond the range of vision,\\nprovided enough time was allowed, even if the Callisto's speed\\nwas not being increased by apergy, in which case articles outside\\nand not affected would be quickly left behind.\\n\\nThe earth, which at first had filled nearly half their sky, was\\nrapidly growing smaller.  Being almost between themselves and the\\nsun, it looked like a crescent moon; and when it was only about\\ntwenty times the size of the moon they calculated they must have\\ncome nearly two hundred thousand miles.  The moon was now on what\\na sailor would call the starboard bow--i. e., to the right and\\nahead.  Being a little more than three quarters full, and only\\nabout fifty thousand miles off, it presented a splendid sight,\\nbrilliant as polished silver, and about twenty-five times as\\nlarge as they had ever before seen it with the unaided eye.\\n\\nIt was just ten hours since they had started, and at that moment\\n9 A. M. in New York; but, though it was night there, the Callisto\\nwas bathed in a flood of sunlight such as never shines on earth.\\nThe only night they would have was on the side of the Callisto\\nturned away from the sun, unless they passed through some shadow,\\nwhich they intended to avoid on account of the danger of\\ncolliding with a meteor in the dark.  The moon and the Callisto\\nwere moving on converging lines, the curve on which they had\\nentered having swung them to the side nearest the earth; but they\\nsaw that their own tremendous and increasing speed would carry\\nthem in front of the moon in its nearly circular orbit.  Wishing\\nto change the direction of their flight by the moon's attraction,\\nthey shut off the power driving them from the earth, whereupon\\nthe Callisto turned its heavy base towards the moon.  They were\\nalready moving at such speed that their momentum alone would\\ncarry them hundreds of thousands of miles into space, and were\\nthen almost abreast of the earth's satellite, which was but a few\\nthousand miles away.  The spectacle was magnificent.  As they\\nlooked at it through their field glasses or with the unaided eye,\\nthe great cracks and craters showed with the utmost clearness,\\nsweeping past them almost as the landscape flies past a railway\\ntrain.  There was something awe-inspiring in the vast antiquity\\nof that furrowed lunar surface, by far the oldest thing that\\nmortal eye can see, since, while observing the ceaseless\\npolitical or geological changes on earth, the face of this dead\\nsatellite, on account of the absence of air and water and\\nconsequent erosion, has remained unchanged for bygone ages, as it\\ndoubtless will for many more.\\n\\nThey closely watched the Callisto's course.  At first it did not\\nseem to deflect from a straight line, and they stood ready to\\nturn on the apergetic force again, when the car very slowly began\\nto show the effect of the moon's near pull; but not till they had\\nso far passed it that the dark side was towards them were they\\nheading straight for Jupiter.  Then they again turned on full\\npower and got a send-off shove on the moon and earth combined,\\nwhich increased their speed so rapidly that they felt they could\\nsoon shut off the current altogether and save their supply.\\n\\n\\\"We must be ready to watch the signals from the arctic circle,\\\"\\nsaid Bearwarden.  \\\"At midnight, if the calculations are finished,\\nthe result will be flashed by the searchlight.\\\"  It was then ten\\nminutes to twelve, and the earth was already over four hundred\\nthousand miles away.  Focusing their glasses upon the region near\\nthe north pole, which, being turned from the sun, was towards\\nthem and in darkness, they waited.\\n\\n\\\"In this blaze of sunlight,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"I am afraid we can\\nsee nothing.\\\"\\n\\nFortunately, at this moment the Callisto entered the moon's\\ntapering shadow.\\n\\n\\\"This,\\\" said Ayrault, \\\"is good luck.  We could of course have\\ngone into the shadow; but to change our course would have delayed\\nus, and we might have lost part of the chance of increasing our\\nspeed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There will be no danger from, meteors or sub-satellites here,\\\"\\nsaid Bearwarden, \\\"for anything revolving about the moon at this\\ndistance would be caught by the earth.\\\"\\n\\nThe sun had apparently set behind the moon, and they were\\neclipsed.  The stars shone with the utmost splendour against the\\ndead-black sky, and the earth appeared as a large crescent, still\\nconsiderably larger than the satellite to which they were\\naccustomed.  Exactly at midnight a faint phosphorescent light,\\nlike that of a glow-worm, appeared in the region of Greenland on\\nthe planet they had left.  It gradually increased its strength\\ntill it shone like a long white beam projected from a lighthouse,\\nand in this they beheld the work of the greatest search-light\\never made by man, receiving for a few moments all the electricity\\ngenerated by the available dynamos at Niagara and the Bay of\\nFundy, the steam engines, and other sources of power in the\\nnorthern hemisphere.  The beam lasted with growing intensity for\\none minute; it then spelled out with clean-cut intervals,\\naccording to the Cable Code:  \\\"23@ no' 6\\\".  The southern\\nhemisphere pumps are now raising and storing water at full blast.\\nWe have already begun to lower the Arctic Ocean.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Victory!\\\" shouted Bearwarden, in an ecstasy of delight.  \\\"Nearly\\nhalf a degree in six months, with but one pole working.  If we\\ncan add at this rate each time to the speed of straightening\\nalready acquired, we can reverse our engines in five years, and\\nin five more the earth will be at rest and right.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Look!\\\" said Ayrault, \\\"they are sending something else.\\\"  The\\nflashes came in rapid succession, reaching far into space.  With\\ntheir glasses fixed upon them, they made out these sentences:\\n\\\"Our telescopes, in whatever part of the earth was turned towards\\nyou, have followed you since you started, and did not lose sight\\nof you till you entered the moon's shadow.  On your present\\ncourse you will be in darkness till 12.16, when we shall see you\\nagain.\\\"\\n\\nOn receiving this last earthly message, the travellers sprang to\\ntheir searchlight, and, using its full power, telegraphed back\\nthe following:  \\\"Many thanks to you for good news about earth,\\nand to Secretary Deepwaters for lending us the navy.  Result of\\nwork most glorious.  Remember us to everybody.  Shadow's edge\\napproaching.\\\"\\n\\nThis was read by the men in the great observatories, who\\nevidently telephoned to the arctic Signal Light immediately, for\\nit flashed back:  \\\"Got your message perfectly.  Wish you greatest\\nluck.  The T. A. S. Co. has decked the Callisto's pedestal with\\nflowers, and has ordered a tablet set up on the site to\\ncommemorate your celestial journey.\\\"\\n\\nAt that moment the shadow swept by, and they were in the full\\nblaze of cloudless day.  The change was so great that for a\\nmoment they were obliged to close their eyes.  The polished sides\\nof the Callisto shone so brightly that they knew they were easily\\nseen.  The power temporarily diverted in sending them the message\\nthen returned to the work of draining the Arctic Ocean, which, as\\nthe north pole was now returning to the sun, was the thing to do,\\nand the travellers resumed their study of the heavenly bodies.\\n\\n```\\n                       CHAPTER II.\\n\\n                     SPACE AND MARS.\\n```\\n\\nNever before had the travellers observed the stars and planets\\nunder such favourable conditions.  No air or clouds intervened,\\nand as the Callisto did not revolve on its axis there was no\\nnecessity for changing the direction of the glasses.  After an\\nhour of this interesting work, however, as it was already late at\\nthe longitude they had left on earth, and as they knew they had\\nmany days in space before them, they prepared to go to bed.  When\\nready, they had only to pull down the shades; for, as apergy was\\nnot applied to them, but only to the Callisto, they still looked\\nupon the floor as down, and closed the heavy curtains to have\\nnight or darkness.  They found that the side of the Callisto\\nturned constantly towards the sun was becoming very warm, the\\ndouble-toughened glass windows making it like a greenhouse; but\\nthey consoled themselves with the thought that the sun's power on\\nthem was hourly becoming less, and they felt sure the double\\nwalls and thick upholstery would protect them almost anywhere\\nwithin the solar system from the intense cold of space.\\n\\n\\\"We could easily have arranged,\\\" said Ayrault, for night and day\\non alternate sides of the Callisto by having strips of metal\\narranged spirally on the outside as on the end of an arrow.\\nThese would have started us turning as slowly as we like, since\\nwe passed through the atmosphere at a comparatively low rate of\\nspeed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am afraid,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"the motion, however slow, would\\nhave made us dizzy.  It would be confusing to see the heavens\\nturning about us, and it would interfere with using the glasses.\\\"\\n\\nThe base and one side of the Callisto had constant sunshine,\\nwhile the other side and the dome were in the blackest night.\\nThis dome, on account of its shape, sky windows, and the\\ncompleteness with which it could be isolated, was an ideal\\nobservatory, and there was seldom a time during their waking\\nhours for the rest of the journey when it was not occupied by\\none, two, or all the observers.\\n\\n\\\"There is something marvellous,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"about the\\ncondition of space.  Its absolute cold is appalling, apparently\\nbecause there is nothing to absorb heat; yet we find the base of\\nthis material projectile uncomfortably warm, though, should we\\nexpose a thermometer in the shade in front, we know it would show\\na temperature of three hundred to four hundred degrees below\\nzero--were the instrument capable of recording it.\\\"\\n\\nArtificial darkness having been obtained, the travellers were\\nsoon asleep, Bearwarden's dreams being regaled with thoughts of\\nhis company's triumph; Ayrault's, naturally, with visions of\\nSylvia; while Cortlandt frequently started up, thinking he had\\nalready made some great astronomical discovery.\\n\\nAbout 9 A. M., according to seventy-fifth meridian time, the\\nexplorers awoke feeling greatly refreshed.  The tank in which the\\nliquefied oxygen was kept automatically gave off its gas so\\nevenly that the air remained normal, while the lime contained in\\ncups absorbed the carbon dioxide as fast as they exhaled it.\\nThey had darkened those windows through which the sun was\\nactually pouring, for, on account of the emptiness of the\\nsurrounding ether and consequent absence of diffusion of light,\\nnothing but the inky blackness of space and the bright stars\\nlooked in at the rest.  On raising the shades they got an idea of\\ntheir speed.  A small crescent, smaller than the familiar moon,\\naccompanied by one still tinier, was all that could be seen of\\nthe earth and its satellite.\\n\\n\\\"We must,\\\" said Bearwarden, \\\"be moving at the rate of nearly a\\nmillion miles an hour, from the way we have travelled.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We must be doing fully a million,\\\" replied Cortlandt, \\\"for by\\nthis time we are pretty well in motion, having got a tremendous\\nstart when so near the moon, with it and the earth in line.\\\"\\n\\nBy steering straight for Jupiter, instead of for the place it\\nwould occupy ten days later, they knew they would swing past, for\\nthe giant planet, being in rapid motion, would advance; but they\\ndid not object to this, since it would give them a chance to\\nexamine their new world in case they wished to do so before\\nalighting; while, if they preferred to land at once, they could\\neasily change their course by means of the moons, the fourth,\\nfrom which their car was named, being the one that they knew\\nwould be of most use.  Their tremendous speed showed them they\\nshould have time for exploration on their arrival, and that they\\nwould reach their destination sooner than they had expected.  The\\napergetic force being applied, as we have seen, only to the\\nCallisto, just as power in starting is exerted on a carriage or\\nrailway car and only through it to the passengers, Ayrault and\\nhis companions had no unusual sensation except loss of weight,\\nfor, when they were so far from the earth, its attraction was\\nvery slight, and no other planet was near enough to take its\\nplace.  After breakfast, wishing to reach the dome, and realizing\\nthat it would be unnecessary to climb, each in turn gave a slight\\nspring and was obliged to put up his hands to avoid striking the\\nroof.  In the cool quiet of the dark dome it was difficult to\\nbelieve that only twenty feet away the sun was shining with such\\nintensity upon the metal base as to make it too hot on the inside\\nto touch without gloves.\\n\\nThe first thing that attracted their attention was the size and\\nbrilliance of Mars.  Although this red planet was over forty\\nmillion miles from the earth when they started, they calculated\\nthat it was less than thirty million miles from them now, or five\\nmillions nearer than it had ever been to them before.  This\\nreduction in distance, and the clearness of the void through\\nwhich they saw it, made it a splendid sight, its disk showing\\nclearly.  From hour to hour its size and brightness increased,\\ntill towards evening it looked like a small, full moon, the sun\\nshining squarely upon it.  They calculated that on the course\\nthey were moving they should pass about nine hundred thousand\\nmiles to the right or behind it, since it was moving towards\\ntheir left.  They were interested to see what effect the mass of\\nMars would have on the Callisto, and saw here a chance of still\\nfurther increasing their speed.  Notwithstanding its tremendous\\nrate, they expected to see the Callisto swerve from its straight\\nline and move towards Mars, whose orbital speed of nine hundred\\nmiles a minute they thought would take it out of the Callisto's\\nway, so that no actual collision would occur even if their\\nair-ship were left to her own devices.\\n\\nTowards evening they noticed through their glasses that several\\napparently island peaks in the southern hemisphere, which was\\nturned towards them, became white, from which they concluded that\\na snow-storm was in progress.  The south polar region was also\\nmarkedly glaciated, though the icecap was not as extensive as\\neither of those at the poles of the earth.\\n\\n\\\"As the Martian winters must be fully as severe as ours,\\\" said\\nCortlandt, \\\"on account of their length, the planet's distance\\nfrom the sun, and the twenty-seven and a half degrees inclination\\nof its axis, we can account for the smallness of its ice-caps\\nonly by the fact that its oceans cover but one fourth of its\\nsurface instead of three quarters, as on the earth, and there is\\nconsequently a smaller evaporation and rain and snow-fall.\\\"\\n\\nThey were too much interested to think of sleeping that night,\\nand so, after dining comfortably returned to their observatory.\\nWhen within four million miles of Mars the Callisto began to\\nswerve perceptibly, its curve, as when near the moon beginning\\nwith a spiral.  They swung on unconcernedly, however, knowing\\nthey could check their approach at any time.  Soon Mars appeared\\nto have a diameter ten times as great as that of the moon, and\\npromised shortly to occupy almost one side of their sky.\\n\\n\\\"We must be on the lookout for the satellites,\\\" said Cortlandt;\\n\\\"a collision with either would be worse than a wreck on a desert\\nisland.\\\"\\n\\nThey therefore turned their glasses in the direction of the\\nsatellites.\\n\\n\\\"Until Prof. Hall, at Washington, discovered the two satellites\\nin 1877,\\\" he continued, \\\"Mars was supposed to be without moons.\\nThe outer one, Deimos, is but six miles in diameter, and revolves\\nabout its primary in thirty hours and eighteen minutes, at a\\ndistance of fourteen thousand six hundred miles.  As it takes but\\nlittle longer to complete a revolution than Mars does to rotate\\non its axis, it remains in the Martial sky one hundred and\\nthirty-two hours between rising and setting, passing through all\\nthe phases from new moon to full and back again four times; that\\nis, it swings four times around Mars before going below the\\nhorizon.  It is one of the smallest bodies discovered with a\\ntelescope.  The inner one, Phobos, is considerably larger, having\\na diameter of about twenty miles.  It is but twenty-seven hundred\\nmiles from Mars's surface, and completes its revolution in seven\\nhours and thirty-eight minutes, which is shorter than any other\\nknown period, Jupiter's nearest moon being the next, with eleven\\nhours and fifty- nine minutes.  It thus revolves in less than a\\nthird of the time Mars takes to rotate, and must consequently\\nrise in the west and set in the east, as it is continually\\nrunning ahead of the surface of the planet, though the sun and\\nall the other stars rise and set on Mars in the same way as on\\nthe earth.\\\"\\n\\nWhen about fifteen thousand miles from Mars, they sighted Deimos\\ndirectly ahead, and saw that they should pass on its left--i. e.,\\nbehind--for it was moving across them.  The sun poured directly\\nupon it, making it appear full and showing all its features.\\nThere were small unevennesses on the surface, apparently seventy\\nor a hundred feet high, which were the nearest approach to\\nmountains, and they ran in ridges or chains.  There were also\\nunmistakable signs of volcanic action, the craters being large\\ncompared with the size of the planet, but shallow.  They saw no\\nsigns of water, and the blackness of the shadows convinced them\\nthere was no air.  They secured two instantaneous photographs of\\nthe little satellite as the Callisto swept by, and resumed their\\ninspection of Mars.  They noticed red and brownish patches on the\\npeaks that had that morning turned white, from which they\\nconcluded that the show had begun to melt under the warm spring\\nsun.  This strengthened the belief they had already formed, that\\non account of its twenty-seven and a half degrees inclination the\\nchanges in temperature on Mars must be great and sudden.  So\\ninterested were they with this, that they did not at first see a\\nlarge and bright body moving rapidly on a course that converged\\nwith theirs.\\n\\n\\\"We must be ready to repel boarders,\\\" said Bearwarden, observing\\nit for the first time and fixing his glass upon it.  \\\"That must\\nbe Phobos.\\\"\\n\\nNot ten miles off they beheld Mars's inner moon, and though their\\nown speed caused them to overtake and rush by it like a\\nwhirlwind, the satellite's rapid motion in its orbit, in a course\\ntemporarily almost parallel with theirs, served to give them a\\nchance the better to examine it.  Here the mountain ranges were\\nconsiderably more conspicuous than on Deimos, and there were\\nboulders and loose stones upon their slopes, which looked as if\\nthere might at some time have been frost and water on its\\nsurface; but it was all dry now, neither was there any air.  The\\nevidences of volcanic action were also plainly visible, while a\\nnoticeable flattening at the poles showed that the little body\\nhad once rotated rapidly on its axis, though whether it did so\\nstill they had not time to ascertain.  When abreast of it they\\nwere less than two miles distant, and they secured several\\ninstantaneous impressions, which they put aside to develop later.\\nAs the radius of Phobos's circle was far shorter than that of the\\nparabolic curve they were making, it began to draw away, and was\\nrapidly left behind.  Applying the full apergetic force to Mars\\nand the larger moon, they shot away like an arrow, having had\\ntheir speed increased by the planet's attraction while\\napproaching it, and subsequently by repulsion.\\n\\n\\\"Either of those,\\\" said Bearwarden, looking back at the little\\nsatellites, \\\"would be a nice yacht for a man to explore space on.\\nHe would also, of course, need a sun to warm him, if he wished to\\ngo beyond this system, but that would not have to be a large\\naffair--in fact, it might be smaller than the planet, and could\\nrevolve about it like a moon.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Though a sun of that size,\\\" replied Cortlandt, \\\"might retain its\\nheat for the time you wished to use it, the planet part would be\\nnothing like as comfortable as what we have here, for it would be\\nvery difficult to get enough air-pressure to breathe on so small\\na body, since, with its slight gravitation-pull, to secure\\nfifteen pounds to the square inch, or anything like it, the\\natmosphere would have to extend thousands of miles into space, so\\nthat on a cloudy day you would be in darkness.  It would be\\nbetter, therefore, to have such a sun as you describe and\\naccompany it in a yacht or private car like this, well stocked\\nwith oxygen and provisions.  When passing through meteoric swarms\\nor masses of solid matter, collision with which is the most\\nserious risk we run, the car could follow behind its sun instead\\nof revolving around it, and be kept from falling into it by\\npartially reversing the attraction.  As the gravitation of so\\nsmall a sun would be slight, counteracting it for even a\\nconsiderable time would take but little from the batteries.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1636791524,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"Do you know,\\\" said Deepwaters to Ayrault, \"},\"digest\":\"R-ZdWZQ84BQA8d-nQ1IevLAvnyt1n6IGKjEOpmr1NhA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3017c2993dc4534D7e4297d49c9264B1d4c07bFC\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Q6oBCNg2FU72L7twe-kFbZZz59pza_xRdEWA7cJGCHw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"RA06yoeOBe-_A399RessbuY_yjiZJN6GIs7al4MUxUs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"4PldmpQRzuQWhpmU0faYa-ZFsoLrw5nUiB0JovzKjrjVIKXrc75YXUNi3G0vtvvh3sE_FH8vkFrf7rcXjCqM4w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd3a5b217f1d1b06169046dd8f19dd271ac216dc51b7fb88706eb3e1dc91bb33764bb5d6ff4f6c5a7a04cb6c372cac6f16bdabc5ed75cd6f459c6a905cbed0e891b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Q6oBCNg2FU72L7twe-kFbZZz59pza_xRdEWA7cJGCHw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"RA06yoeOBe-_A399RessbuY_yjiZJN6GIs7al4MUxUs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"R-ZdWZQ84BQA8d-nQ1IevLAvnyt1n6IGKjEOpmr1NhA\"}"
