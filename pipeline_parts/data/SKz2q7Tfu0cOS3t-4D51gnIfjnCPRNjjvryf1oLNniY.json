Dropping the collection in Miami is particularly significant, as in 1951, Josephine Baker’s refusal to perform for a segregated crowd at the Copa City Club in Miami Beach led to integration sweeping across the US.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/FranceinMiami/status/1465397201115439105?s=20](https://twitter.com/FranceinMiami/status/1465397201115439105?s=20)\\n\\nFor the first time ever, Addonis is auctioning off one of his physical paintings as an NFT, with the owner of the *[From Paris With Love - Original Painting NFT](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/77254096202997200010110922229169619184566858577709409230454497415126751117313)* able to claim the physical painting in December 2022, after its been shown for public appreciation in the French Consulate for one year from its unveiling.\\n\\n[https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/artist-addonis-parker-is-seen-during-the-unveiling-of-from-news-photo/1356181733](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/artist-addonis-parker-is-seen-during-the-unveiling-of-from-news-photo/1356181733)\\n\\n20 editions of Addonis’ animated rendition of the artwork, [The Stars are Out](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/77254096202997200010110922229169619184566858577709409230454497416226262745098) & [Mourning in Paris](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/77254096202997200010110922229169619184566858577709409230454497417325774372874) will also come with a limited series of 20 signed physical prints of the painting, providing buyers with both a valuable physical and digital collectible honoring the legendary Josephine Baker.\\n\\nThis NFT collection connects the important moments in Ms. Baker’s life: the Pantheon in Paris, French Consulate of Miami, the African Heritage Cultural Arts Center, and the world via web 3.0 and NFTs.
