"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Although the United States extols the virtues of its model of democracy, the numerous limitations and drawbacks of this system have been laid bare, and it is far from an ideal example of modern democracy, a report said on Thursday.\\n\\nThe report, issued by the China Society for Human Rights Studies, said that the US system, which is centered on elections, can hardly sustain democratic politics in a complete sense. Therefore, US democracy should not and cannot be the sole and ultimate system of modern democracy.\\n\\nThe report looks at the political background and historical limitations of US-style democracy. It showed that the US has long deprived people of color of the right to participate in the political process, and has systemically expelled, excluded and assimilated Native Americans over a long period of time, and long restricted women's right to suffrage on an equal footing.\\n\\nIt also pointed out the real drawbacks of US-style democracy, including political polarization, double standards and its money-dominated nature.\\n\\nIt said that the US flaunts values such as human rights, freedom and democracy, and creates an image of itself as a defender of democratic values, but if the interests of the US are threatened, it will adopt anti-democratic measures without hesitation.\\n\\nThe double standards of US-style democracy are clearly manifested in its treatment of street protests and the freedom of the press, said the report.\\n\\nFor instance, while the US connives with and exploits opposition forces in other countries to launch campaigns of street protests that can sometimes turn violent, it has forcibly suppressed protests by its citizens at every turn, including the Black Lives Matter movement.\\n\\nThe report pointed out that US-style democracy is gradually losing its persuasiveness and appeal, as more countries and people become aware that such a system \\\"does not represent the direction of the development of democracy\\\".\\n\\n\\\"People of all countries should and can independently pursue democratic development with their own traits and contribute their wisdom and power to the diversity of political achievements,\\\" the report said.\",\"timestamp\":1640386762,\"title\":\"Limitations, drawbacks of US-style democracy exposed\"},\"digest\":\"Vz2msQwOXAXknXmRDzW5aNfNFtCsrD_DMwQARiQeMkU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xb11C5bb99e2a0B948346BC8249A09A348ab03171\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2slszTlKI6J9UsslD9xfHNm_f_yrvMuEwnNdorRyVKk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"-2cgyZ6y7BzfChYSOP16SBIPqaF1etvqtqR-wYzFzKs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"oCl3Sro9h5LCGufy12ANf1LCrX5YYGBMc_ZgXfbWxAN1jsDQrGc_jA6_6GMr6BHG1wIEPG5X2rYyhBZ61-mg-A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x137f307167d0a1569dcb2c1136ad0980c075566df5b64c63bb554ba26f36968661a9d49b1b997b74f188dcff9b7e422eefb550344bffe5a2433017b0b6e313231b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2slszTlKI6J9UsslD9xfHNm_f_yrvMuEwnNdorRyVKk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"-2cgyZ6y7BzfChYSOP16SBIPqaF1etvqtqR-wYzFzKs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Vz2msQwOXAXknXmRDzW5aNfNFtCsrD_DMwQARiQeMkU\"}"
