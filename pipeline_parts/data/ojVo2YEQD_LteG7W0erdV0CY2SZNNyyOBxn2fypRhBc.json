It’s time to expand, they cried. IT’S TIME” — Founding Scrolls of Squiggledom*\\n\\n**A CALL FOR GROWING THE TREASURY** \\n *From the Acquisitions Committee \\n Department of The Squiggle Treasury \\n #1 — Squiggle Square \\n Squiggledom, The Internet*\\n\\n## What a year so far!\\n\\nIn only a few months, SquiggleDAO has experienced some tremendous growth:\\n\\n* 629 SQUIG token holders\\n* 578 DAO members\\n* 232 Squiggles (worth \\\\~400 ETH)\\n* 3 DAO proposals passed, with many more coming\\n\\nSo what’s next?\\n\\n## The DAO Beyond Squiggles\\n\\nSquiggleDAO was launched in early 2021 as a decentralized community built by and for generative art enthusiasts. Since its launch, SquiggleDAO has become the place to talk about Chromie Squiggles, the brilliant initial Art Blocks offering.\\n\\nBut the vision of SquiggleDAO exceeds just the eponymous Squiggle…\\n\\nThe SquiggleDAO community has approved a new Contribution Round — Round 3. Rounds 1 and 2 were focused on building the foundational Chromie Squiggle vault (what can we say, we love them!). But it’s time!\\n\\n> Round 3 is being launched to expand the artworks and artists in the SquiggleDAO vault\\n\\nThanks to the Acquisition Committee ([one of several DAO committees you can join if you want to contribute](https://app.gitbook.com/@squiggledao/s/squiggledao-community-guide/)), 13 generative art projects were considered as being eligible for donation to the DAO treasury. Through a series of discussions and voting mechanisms, the following three were chosen:\\n\\n* Algobots\\n* Ringers\\n* Framergence\\n\\n[Read more about this process here](http://ff/)\\n\\n## How can I participate in this Contribution Round?\\n\\nThere are two phases to this contribution round. The first is for DAO members and the second is open to the public. *For the entire round there is a maximum of 100,000 SQUIG. If that amount is hit the entire contribution round will close.*\\n\\n> For DAO members:\\n>\\n> **Eligibility:** You must be a member of the Discord (with a purple name) **Contribution Window:** Thurs July 8th @ 17:00 PST —Sat July 10th @ 17:00 PST\\\\*\\\\*Contribution Limit: \\\\*\\\\*1 NFT maximum\\n>\\n> For the Public:\\n>\\n> **Eligibility:** Anyone**Contribution Window:** Sat July 10th @ 17:00 PST — Mon July 12th @ 17:00 PST\\\\*\\\\*Contribution Limit: \\\\*\\\\*1 NFT maximum\\n\\n*To contribute, send your NFT to the DAO Treasury:*\\n\\nSquiggledao.eth ([0x56fcb471A9DdE74045830439AD6612C9aad53C19](https://opensea.io/accounts/0x56fcb471a9dde74045830439ad6612c9aad53c19))\\n\\nAny valid submissions will receive the following SQUIG once the contribution round is over.
