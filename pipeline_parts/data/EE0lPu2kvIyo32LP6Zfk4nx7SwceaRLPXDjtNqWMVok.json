"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) has bought more than half a billion dollars worth of Ether ([ETH](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price)) in the time since CEO Zhu Su publicly slammed the cryptocurrency on Twitter. Do the purchases mean he’s changed his mind, or was he just taking advantage of a market crash to buy the dip?\\n\\nIn an anti-ETH tirade between Nov. 20 and Nov. 22, Zhu [tweeted](https://twitter.com/zhusu/status/1462216210116853762?s=20) about why he had “abandoned Ethereum despite supporting it in the past.” The thread came in response to a tweet from Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, who’d called out people who have “sold out in pursuit of profit maximization.” During the tweet storm, Zhu claimed that Ethereum culture “suffers massively from the Founders’ Dilemma” and that “everyone is already far too rich to remember what they originally set out to do.”\\n\\nHowever, after attracting wide attention, he made a [U-turn](https://cointelegraph.com/news/three-arrows-capital-ceo-backtracks-on-ethereum-abandonment-comments), saying he wanted to “soften” his original stance and that “I love Ethereum and what it stands for.”\\n\\nIn the 17 days or so since the threads, approximately 156,400 ETH or $676.37 million has been transferred to a [wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4862733b5fddfd35f35ea8ccf08f5045e57388b3) that blockchain analytics firm Nansen has associated with 3AC.\\n\\nAlmost all the funds entering the wallet during this period were transferred from Binance, FTX exchange or Coinbase.\",\"timestamp\":1639038496,\"title\":\"Three Arrows buys 156K ETH in the weeks after CEO ‘abandoned ETH’\"},\"digest\":\"TxEL6gMP-0AG1pyky5h-KcUCPUk4p48CLPgAVsLqjXE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7f3826FcFF1C011509864Aa713a3FE77745E538e\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8mOkHmsLIQeEQEewXYKqJVgnvu3UYjyKOWAr0ZyxONc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0_4zSEib6TuPScivJxwCXwyEZc4uBzEn2RW5W2TtSB0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"OY2RkqKzlU8DnlrU7FUJtVqVvcTc8PZNNdWhhQbSMW6eQ-0B9m_jPWfpWivGZ7OwbmJiW_TwEoWFQlsFhhogYw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe8a24ce7be5c6e97fac8f5938fd2f7e6efe20d1e0e024db79fa5a27c6d49dfb7732e593f3e1217bcef490c21f601dde69f41ec4566a504f72df15c60a0f5525e1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8mOkHmsLIQeEQEewXYKqJVgnvu3UYjyKOWAr0ZyxONc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0_4zSEib6TuPScivJxwCXwyEZc4uBzEn2RW5W2TtSB0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"TxEL6gMP-0AG1pyky5h-KcUCPUk4p48CLPgAVsLqjXE\"}"
