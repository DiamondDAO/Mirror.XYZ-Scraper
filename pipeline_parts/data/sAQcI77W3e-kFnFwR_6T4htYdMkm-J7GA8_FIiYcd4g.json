"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Oscar pretended not to hear, the monster! Perhaps Madame Clapart was\\n\\nlacking in tact under the circumstances; but all absorbing sentiments\\n\\nhave so much egotism!\\n\\n\\\"Georges, do you like children when travelling?\\\" asked one young man\\n\\nof the other.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, my good Amaury, if they are weaned, and are named Oscar, and\\n\\nhave chocolate.\\\"\\n\\nThese speeches were uttered in half-tones to allow Oscar to hear them\\n\\nor not hear them as he chose; his countenance was to be the weather-\\n\\ngauge by which the other young traveller could judge how much fun he\\n\\nmight be able to get out of the lad during the journey. Oscar chose\\n\\nnot to hear. He looked to see if his mother, who weighed upon him like\\n\\na nightmare, was still there, for he felt that she loved him too well\\n\\nto leave him so quickly. Not only did he involuntarily compare the\\n\\ndress of his travelling companion with his own, but he felt that his\\n\\nmother's toilet counted for much in the smiles of the two young men.\\n\\n\\\"If they would only take themselves off!\\\" he said to himself.\\n\\nInstead of that, Amaury remarked to Georges, giving a tap with his\\n\\ncane to the heavy wheel of the coucou:\\n\\n\\\"And so, my friend, you are really going to trust your future to this\\n\\nfragile bark?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I must,\\\" replied Georges, in a tone of fatalism.\\n\\nOscar gave a sigh as he remarked the jaunty manner in which his\\n\\ncompanion's hat was stuck on one ear for the purpose of showing a\\n\\nmagnificent head of blond hair beautifully brushed and curled; while\\n\\nhe, by order of his step-father, had his black hair cut like a\\n\\nclothes-brush across the forehead, and clipped, like a soldier's,\\n\\nclose to the head. The face of the vain lad was round and chubby and\\n\\nbright with the hues of health, while that of his fellow-traveller was\\n\\nlong, and delicate, and pale. The forehead of the latter was broad,\\n\\nand his chest filled out a waistcoat of cashmere pattern. As Oscar\\n\\nadmired the tight-fitting iron-gray trousers and the overcoat with its\\n\\nfrogs and olives clasping the waist, it seemed to him that this\\n\\nromantic-looking stranger, gifted with such advantages, insulted him\\n\\nby his superiority, just as an ugly woman feels injured by the mere\\n\\nsight of a pretty one. The click of the stranger's boot-heels offended\\n\\nhis taste and echoed in his heart. He felt as hampered by his own\\n\\nclothes (made no doubt at home out of those of his step-father) as\\n\\nthat envied young man seemed at ease in his.\\n\\n\\\"That fellow must have heaps of francs in his trousers pocket,\\\"\\n\\nthought Oscar.\\n\\nThe young man turned round. What were Oscar's feelings on beholding a\\n\\ngold chain round his neck, at the end of which no doubt was a gold\\n\\nwatch! From that moment the young man assumed, in Oscar's eyes, the\\n\\nproportions of a personage.\\n\\nLiving in the rue de la Cerisaie since 1815, taken to and from school\\n\\nby his step-father, Oscar had no other points of comparison since his\\n\\nadolescence than the poverty-stricken household of his mother. Brought\\n\\nup strictly, by Moreau's advice, he seldom went to the theatre, and\\n\\nthen to nothing better than the Ambigu-Comique, where his eyes could\\n\\nsee little elegance, if indeed the eyes of a child riveted on a\\n\\nmelodrama were likely to examine the audience. His step-father still\\n\\nwore, after the fashion of the Empire, his watch in the fob of his\\n\\ntrousers, from which there depended over his abdomen a heavy gold\\n\\nchain, ending in a bunch of heterogeneous ornaments, seals, and a\\n\\nwatch-key with a round top and flat sides, on which was a landscape in\\n\\nmosaic. Oscar, who considered that old-fashioned finery as the \\\"ne\\n\\nplus ultra\\\" of adornment, was bewildered by the present revelation of\\n\\nsuperior and negligent elegance. The young man exhibited, offensively,\\n\\na pair of spotless gloves, and seemed to wish to dazzle Oscar by\\n\\ntwirling with much grace a gold-headed switch cane.\\n\\nOscar had reached that last quarter of adolescence when little things\\n\\ncause immense joys and immense miseries,--a period when youth prefers\\n\\nmisfortune to a ridiculous suit of clothes, and caring nothing for the\\n\\nreal interests of life, torments itself about frivolities, about\\n\\nneckcloths, and the passionate desire to appear a man. Then the young\\n\\nfellow swells himself out; his swagger is all the more portentous\\n\\nbecause it is exercised on nothings. Yet if he envies a fool who is\\n\\nelegantly dressed, he is also capable of enthusiasm over talent, and\\n\\nof genuine admiration for genius. Such defects as these, when they\\n\\nhave no root in the heart, prove only the exuberance of sap,--the\\n\\nrichness of the youthful imagination. That a lad of nineteen, an only\\n\\nchild, kept severely at home by poverty, adored by a mother who put\\n\\nupon herself all privations for his sake, should be moved to envy by a\\n\\nyoung man of twenty-two in a frogged surtout-coat silk-lined, a waist-\\n\\ncoat of fancy cashmere, and a cravat slipped through a ring of the\\n\\nworse taste, is nothing more than a peccadillo committed in all ranks\\n\\nof social life by inferiors who envy those that seem beyond them. Men\\n\\nof genius themselves succumb to this primitive passion. Did not\\n\\nRousseau admire Ventura and Bacle?\\n\\nBut Oscar passed from peccadillo to evil feelings. He felt humiliated;\\n\\nhe was angry with the youth he envied, and there rose in his heart a\\n\\nsecret desire to show openly that he himself was as good as the object\\n\\nof his envy.\\n\\nThe two young fellows continued to walk up and own from the gate to\\n\\nthe stables, and from the stables to the gate. Each time they turned\\n\\nthey looked at Oscar curled up in his corner of the coucou. Oscar,\\n\\npersuaded that their jokes and laughter concerned himself, affected\\n\\nthe utmost indifference. He began to hum the chorus of a song lately\\n\\nbrought into vogue by the liberals, which ended with the words, \\\"'Tis\\n\\nVoltaire's fault, 'tis Rousseau's fault.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tiens! perhaps he is one of the chorus at the Opera,\\\" said Amaury.\\n\\nThis exasperated Oscar, who bounded up, pulled out the wooden \\\"back,\\\"\\n\\nand called to Pierrotin:--\\n\\n\\\"When do we start?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Presently,\\\" said that functionary, who was standing, whip in hand,\\n\\nand gazing toward the rue d'Enghien.\\n\\nAt this moment the scene was enlivened by the arrival of a young man\\n\\naccompanied by a true \\\"gamin,\\\" who was followed by a porter dragging a\\n\\nhand-cart. The young man came up to Pierrotin and spoke to him\\n\\nconfidentially, on which the latter nodded his head, and called to his\\n\\nown porter. The man ran out and helped to unload the little hand-cart,\\n\\nwhich contained, besides two trunks, buckets, brushes, boxes of\\n\\nsingular shape, and an infinity of packages and utensils which the\\n\\nyoungest of the new-comers, who had climbed into the imperial, stowed\\n\\naway with such celerity that Oscar, who happened to be smiling at his\\n\\nmother, now standing on the other side of the street, saw none of the\\n\\nparaphernalia which might have revealed to him the profession of his\\n\\nnew travelling companion.\\n\\nThe gamin, who must have been sixteen years of age, wore a gray blouse\\n\\nbuckled round his waist by a polished leather belt. His cap, jauntily\\n\\nperched on the side of his head, seemed the sign of a merry nature,\\n\\nand so did the picturesque disorder of the curly brown hair which fell\\n\\nupon his shoulders. A black-silk cravat drew a line round his very\\n\\nwhite neck, and added to the vivacity of his bright gray eyes. The\\n\\nanimation of his brown and rosy face, the moulding of his rather large\\n\\nlips, the ears detached from his head, his slightly turned-up nose,--\\n\\nin fact, all the details of his face proclaimed the lively spirit of a\\n\\nFigaro, and the careless gayety of youth, while the vivacity of his\\n\\ngesture and his mocking eye revealed an intellect already developed by\\n\\nthe practice of a profession adopted very early in life. As he had\\n\\nalready some claims to personal value, this child, made man by Art or\\n\\nby vocation, seemed indifferent to the question of costume; for he\\n\\nlooked at his boots, which had not been polished, with a quizzical\\n\\nair, and searched for the spots on his brown Holland trousers less to\\n\\nremove them than to see their effect.\",\"timestamp\":1637315876,\"title\":\"\\n\\n\\\"How shall I ever get rid of mamma?\\\" thought Oscar.\\n\"},\"digest\":\"k4uYEJrKxq-XOHw9-QT3joiOEyPfJnSVV67Lf9VJzzw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x025bE40F20d6f0f04d76fE7Ad916e5d61bc4D69f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"51MhD-htQ_UBd3BmRNfb53yNl47O53C7D0PIuZ9MjNw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"l8jb5E7Ak5BYGMTWjtkePw3FB-htS8qVayme5pDxb4E\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"WNI7vhOHzZ6uv2tULGco-CrktN0ObUHPxmP6n7Uy8_60xfNsJwlxr2TO7WQebW1AubRQqyHNoYqnD0eKnfXnBA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa369379160417cc70562d1f1376809b534162370a2a789459c68e9299ffbb9cf0a34ac3a029f8b7fda7897f7823318eb2e57f043734fa1b8c14506ed82c732151c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"51MhD-htQ_UBd3BmRNfb53yNl47O53C7D0PIuZ9MjNw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"l8jb5E7Ak5BYGMTWjtkePw3FB-htS8qVayme5pDxb4E\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"k4uYEJrKxq-XOHw9-QT3joiOEyPfJnSVV67Lf9VJzzw\"}"
