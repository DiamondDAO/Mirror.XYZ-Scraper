The expert in, and first scientist of, suffering was Gautama Buddha.[\\\\[5\\\\]](#_ftn5)\\n\\nBuddha’s teachings were an evolution of previous Hindu philosophy in respect of suffering, providing an example of great freedom of action from existing teachings of already deep wisdom.\\n\\nMore than any other practical philosophy, Buddhism focuses on the fact of suffering, the causes of suffering and the means to realise the cessation of suffering. Suffering is so fundamental to the philosophy that it is within Buddha’s first sermon of the [Four Noble Truths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths).\\n\\n**“Now this, monks, is the noble truth of stress: Birth is stressful, aging is stressful, death is stressful; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair are stressful; association with the unbeloved is stressful, separation from the loved is stressful, not getting what is wanted is stressful. In short, the five clinging-aggregates are stressful.**\\n\\n**And this, monks, is the noble truth of the origination of stress: the craving that makes for further becoming — accompanied by passion and delight, relishing now here and now there — i.e., craving for sensual pleasure, craving for becoming, craving for non-becoming.**\\n\\n**And this, monks, is the noble truth of the cessation of stress: the remainderless fading and cessation, renunciation, relinquishment, release, and letting go of that very craving.”**[\\\\[7\\\\]](#_ftn7)\\n\\nThe unrelenting ‘desire’ of Buddha to help each person face the ‘truth’ of the human condition, as a being conscious of the impermanence of being, and thereby reduce the suffering that accompanies living, is what makes his insights and teaching so extraordinarily powerful even today. There is no need for belief in a deity, or any slavish adherence to any rules or practice, if it does not accord with the principles of wisdom and compassion.\\n\\nBuddha is said to have reached a state of ‘enlightenment’ following a brutal self-imposed course of suffering in which he tested the nature of reality as a human life-form. The story passed down (in oral culture, originally) is that he was a young prince who was shielded from the reality of ageing, poverty, illness and death (impermanence) within his palace. One day, he saw what reality was like for everyone else. He actively sought out the meaning of life, the reasons for impermanence and the suffering that arises from it.\\n\\nEventually, after seeking the answers from various holy and wise teachers, Buddha took himself, accompanied by some fellow scientists of suffering, to the forest. His enlightenment came about after some considerable time spent enduring and exploring physical pain to the point of near death; his realisation arose when he stopped trying so hard to find the ‘truth’ whilst he sat and meditated under the famous Bodhi tree.[\\\\[8\\\\]](#_ftn8) This experience and his subsequent enlightenment gave rise to his teaching of the avoidance of extremes (the middle way of moderation between self-mortification and sensual indulgence).\\n\\n**“I recall once, when my father the Sakyan was working, and I was sitting in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree, then — quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities — I entered and remained in the first jhana: rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation. Could that be the path to Awakening?’”**\\n\\n[\\\\[9\\\\]](#_ftn9)\\n\\nThe Bodhi tree at the [Mahabodhi Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabodhi_Temple) (Sri Maha Bodhi) was a place of worship or honour of the Buddha’s teachings apparently even in his lifetime. King Ashoka[\\\\[10\\\\]](#_ftn10) is also alleged to have paid homage there. Every time the tree dies or is destroyed, a new tree is planted in its place.\\n\\nThis book has a number of central images which arose and became strengthened naturally, without conscious thought, during the writing process (or whilst life has been using my fingers and mind to write on behalf of it). Waves are central to the meaning and description of energy; trees are central to the meaning of life for human life-forms.\\n\\nWhat could be more apt for enlightenment than to return to our earlier evolutionary home in the trees? Perhaps even then, at the dawn of *Homo sapiens* and before, with our ancestral relatives, some beings looked around at teeming life and also upwards, above the canopy — to the silvery stars — with a sense of wonder, full of longing for the shining universe and a feeling of belonging on Earth.\\n\\n**“And I, infinitesimal being, drunk with the great starry void, likeness, image of mystery, felt myself a pure part of the abyss, I wheeled with the stars, my heart broke loose on the wind.”**\\n\\n(*Pablo Neruda*)[\\\\[11\\\\]](#_ftn11)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nTrees speak of quietude and rootedness, but also a sort of silent understanding and connection to the Earth and all life. They are a form that lives a long, meditative[\\\\[12\\\\]](#_ftn12) life without the burden of a noisy mind and often overwhelming passions.\\n\\nThis book cannot do justice to the story of Buddha and his teachings and those of his followers. I hope the reader will go on to learn why any discourse on suffering should always start with the wisdom that is immanent in the world, as illuminated by the compassion and wisdom of Buddha.\\n\\n**“\\\\[She lost\\\\] her only child \\\\[and\\\\] became desperate … Her sorrow was so great that many thought she had lost her mind … The Buddha told her that he could bring the child back to life if she could find white mustard seeds from a family where no one had died. She desperately went from house to house … Finally the realization struck her … no house \\\\[is\\\\] free from mortality”**\\n\\n[\\\\[13\\\\]](#_ftn13)\\n\\n![pxhere.com, public domain](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\\\*Y1aRXja8AjhcCMA2MKuLHA.jpeg?&&&&size=medium)\\n\\nBuddha teaches us that much of our suffering may be an additional burden we impose on ourselves by our difficulty in embracing the nature of life and death and the impermanence of all matter, clinging on to that which must inevitably pass. Only energy can be near eternal. Life is a kind of energy that might be near eternal too, but that is because life itself is not alive — though it moves through life-forms that pass it forward like a wave.\\n\\n**“We are created for precisely this sort of suffering. In the end, it is all we are, these limpid tide pools of self-consciousness between crashing waves of pain.”**\\n\\n(*Dan Simmons*)[\\\\[14\\\\]](#_ftn14)\\n\\nLife-forms are like the molecules of **H2O** that push against each other to propagate the energy of the wave. We must die in doing so. There is no tragedy in that simple fact. The tragedy is in not knowing it and not seeing its meaning for each other and all life-forms. The true tragedy is to have the capacity to understand life, and the meaning of life for all life-forms, and to not then be led inexorably to compassion for all life-forms. It is not that we kill and eat animals or rely on them for sustenance;[\\\\[15\\\\]](#_ftn15) it is that we inflict uncounted and unnecessary suffering on them in the process.\\n\\nIt is not that species become extinct — all species will become extinct eventually. It is that we hasten extinction for so many species and life-forms before we even know of them or understand them, before we have grasped the way of the world and our place in it. When so much suffering could be avoided, with just a little pause and meditation on this journey of life through all life-forms.\\n\\nWe are not wiser than the animals we kill and the species we are driving to extinction. We are like rampaging bulls, goaded into action by forces we do not understand,[\\\\[16\\\\]](#_ftn16) trampling through fields full of priceless treasures.\\n\\nWe are able to deviate from this thoughtless, violent mediocrity. We must, if we are to survive through evolution.\\n\\n![Vincent van Gogh, “Spectators in the Arena at Arles”, 1888 CE, public domain](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ofQ5Cyzd2jVejuAv6LioH.png?height=1569&width=2000)\\n\\n![(Miroslav Holub)\\\\[17\\\\]](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OOcipi_swT_PyVVJqsWeV.png?height=764&width=1590&&&&&size=medium)\\n\\nLife is, of course, full of other tragedies — which arise from the relentless impact of cause and effect, unconscious impulses and hidden information. Fate seems to go out of her way to entangle us in her complex web.\\n\\nWilliam Shakespeare was the sovereign at spinning tales about the tragic consequences when individuals become trapped, by the wider forces at work in the world and the inner angels and demons that drive our actions. Nevermore so than in his wonderful creation of the prince of Denmark, *Hamlet*.\\n\\nMany of Shakespeare’s plays deal with the strongest passions that motivate human action.\\n\\nIndeed, there are few circumstances in life where Shakespeare does not have something profound to say to us — and with finer language than we could ever conjure ourselves.\\n\\nWithout wishing to limit the astonishing range of his plays, they could be categorised by how they deal with our key human passions (and more than just one in the same play): anger and bitterness,[\\\\[18\\\\]](#_ftn18)ambition,[\\\\[19\\\\]](#_ftn19) envy,[\\\\[20\\\\]](#_ftn20) freedom and confinement,[\\\\[21\\\\]](#_ftn21) hatred,[\\\\[22\\\\]](#_ftn22) desire,[\\\\[23\\\\]](#_ftn23) love[\\\\[24\\\\]](#_ftn24) and madness.[\\\\[25\\\\]](#_ftn25)\\n\\n![William Blake, “Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing”, c. 1786 CE, Wikipedia, public domain](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*fXUP3IgRXNZStQZSiei8yA.png)\\n\\nShakespearean drama links suffering — that was thought to be caused by both chance and the caprice of the gods in ancient times, in Greece and elsewhere, — to the more modern psychological understanding of the ‘psyche’[\\\\[26\\\\]](#_ftn26) or inner soul.\\n\\nShakespeare explores how we are involved in creating or perpetuating the conditions for our own suffering.
