"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*Further information: [History of Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Wikipedia)*\\n\\nThe [English edition of Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Wikipedia) has grown to 6,401,360 articles, equivalent to [around 3,000 print volumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Size_in_volumes) of the *[Encyclopædia Britannica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica)*. Including all language editions, Wikipedia has 57,572,157 articles, equivalent to [around 21,600 print volumes](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_as_books).[\\\\[1\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About#cite_note-Wikimedia_Stats-1)\\n\\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia) was founded as an offshoot of [Nupedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nupedia), a now-abandoned project to produce a free encyclopedia, begun by the online media company [Bomis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomis). Nupedia had an elaborate system of [peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review) and required highly qualified contributors, but articles' writing was slow. During 2000, [Jimmy Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales) (founder of Nupedia and co-founder of Bomis), and [Larry Sanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Sanger), whom Wales had employed to work on the encyclopedia project, discussed ways of supplementing Nupedia with a more open, complementary project. Multiple sources suggested that a [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) might allow public members to contribute material, and Nupedia's first wiki went online on January 10, 2001.\\n\\nThere was considerable resistance on the part of Nupedia's editors and reviewers to the idea of associating Nupedia with a website in the Wiki format, so Sanger gave the new project the name \\\"Wikipedia\\\" and it was launched on its own domain, wikipedia.com, on January 15 (now called [\\\"Wikipedia Day\\\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Day) by some users). The [bandwidth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)) and [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)) (in San Diego) were donated by Wales. Other current and past Bomis employees who have worked on the project include [Tim Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Shell), one of the cofounders of Bomis and its current CEO, and programmer Jason Richey.\\n\\nIn May 2001, a large number of non-English Wikipedias were launched—in [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language), [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language), [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language), [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto), [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language), [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language), [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language), [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language), [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language), [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language), [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language), [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language), and [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_language). These were soon joined by [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language) and [Hungarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language). In September,[\\\\[2\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About#cite_note-2) [Polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_language) was added, and further commitment to the multilingual provision of Wikipedia was made. At the end of the year, [Afrikaans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans), [Norwegian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language), and [Serbo-Croatian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbo-Croatian_language) versions were announced.\\n\\nThe domain was eventually changed to the present wikipedia.org when the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikimedia_Foundation) was launched, in 2003, as its new parent organization with the \\\".org\\\" [top-level domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain) denoting its not-for-profit nature. Today, there are Wikipedias in more than 300 languages.\",\"timestamp\":1635436151,\"title\":\"History\"},\"digest\":\"LUnDpZhkMUKxMr06BJF53jXrtnF18pXxOWePMQtuzzU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xF75B25663c9Df75D0c3718242A9f4FB42e130C7e\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2evYLkFKZAcNiOMoMXOPjpg9brj_FNZF9kIP_7oL8Fw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"tjyQagic6QRlo3sidTWMFJLHjc8VeHBxvVoL0XiAStc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"57mZKJxzpE3YutkSV2LEt4_ne1FKcrc3xeX4aCvUQx_svhejtxSuayu1Rgcf1ZP5_qSlkfW07u7l7Xix_6yqpA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x936a75917969ef76ba9e273d58a72168c97f95a7024eac469e339dbd5aee4ead6b3d44d9c881f5e84a2db478b9577fb90b6e4ef52eb911c93f59bb7ac0eb9af41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2evYLkFKZAcNiOMoMXOPjpg9brj_FNZF9kIP_7oL8Fw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"tjyQagic6QRlo3sidTWMFJLHjc8VeHBxvVoL0XiAStc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"LUnDpZhkMUKxMr06BJF53jXrtnF18pXxOWePMQtuzzU\"}"
