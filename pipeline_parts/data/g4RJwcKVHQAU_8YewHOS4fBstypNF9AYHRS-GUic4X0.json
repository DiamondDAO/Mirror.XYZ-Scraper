"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Clyde defender Conrad Balatoni has warned players of the dangers they face investing in cryptocurrency.\\n\\nScottish football has seen a rise in clubs becoming involved with crypto and NFTs. Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that can be used to buy goods and services, but uses an online ledger with strong cryptography to obtain transactions.\\n\\nMuch of the interest in these unregulated currencies is to trade for profit, with interested parties at times driving prices upwards.\\n\\nA non-fungible token (NFT) meanwhile is a unique digital asset that represents ownership of a real-world item like art. NFTs use the same technology that powers some cryptocurrencies, but isn't a currency.\\n\\nRangers are sponsored by a cryptocurrency brand called Bitci and both the Ibrox club and Hibs have sponsorship deals with Sportemon Go, which brands itself as a world leader in NFT augmented reality sports trading.\\n\\nAyr United are also sponsored by Bitcoin SV.\\n\\nBalatoni works as a financial adviser for players and those involved in sport, and some have made enquiries over crypto and NFT investments.\\n\\nThe 30-year-old say while he'll never tell someone not to invest, it's not something he'll be doing.\\n\\nSpeaking on the fourth episode of the ***Lanarkshire Live Sport Podcast - which is released this Thursday at 9am - ***Balatoni said: \\\"I don't advise it. It's unregulated. I hold a very small amount but I won't fully get into it.\\n\\n\\\"If you want to have a dabble, be my guest. But I'm letting you know that it is very volatile. If you are comfortable losing what you put in, that's fine.\\n\\n\\\"You can get good returns on crypto but you might lose out on it. You don't know what cryptocurrency lurks as a scam or what is actually legitimate.\\n\\n\\\"I tell my clients not to go all in. There are better ways to make your money work for you. There's better ways to be safer with regulation. But people have the fear of missing out.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1638367663,\"title\":\"Rangers and Ayr cryptocurrency warning with Clyde star and financial adviser not advocating dip into 'volatile' market\"},\"digest\":\"rL8HXtrDqK8Ol9yKuZfnUNyFpS8me3g_suVw1JN2IXo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x65a5aBB63bb431a9B8377487d0A8cd2a797856f0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"h1NxghbffDjz-hVvjN1awMheoJzitsqN1zWH9oFGZ9E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2YOsQ4KRH9r4-fWhZBHyak-BYJo3w-VdJnlzLt86M7g\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"0nMEHlU0OxI7D5pXlN70NKK1AAxFWLMgIIvgdIbl9S0qwwKYD9FcU4C5OrrOWhdAuadexfALFPKUmHDZynlWUQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x3e353613a3ef6ad6cb1040af1fe713f6c91a1d980d0d09f4585e3e4bc46d6c6035ffee5e70bf04c9f4eecb03dc2156f4b97e4907d2e7586e18c559930f64218a1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"h1NxghbffDjz-hVvjN1awMheoJzitsqN1zWH9oFGZ9E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2YOsQ4KRH9r4-fWhZBHyak-BYJo3w-VdJnlzLt86M7g\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rL8HXtrDqK8Ol9yKuZfnUNyFpS8me3g_suVw1JN2IXo\"}"
