"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1993\\n\\nA network is as valuable as its users, a road as valuable as its travellers.\\n\\nRome built roads but its fate was decided travellers building, fighting, and trading for wealth and words.\\n\\nIn the East, a fearsome hub-and-spoke collapsed into a dozen, the first splinters of an empire, a dozen nations at first. In the West, a million machine network was born.\\n\\nMore \\\"Bicycles of the Mind\\\" were leaving walled gardens. Outfitted with new gear, browsers, they were ready for the open road.\\n\\nThe gear included \\\"WorldWideWeb\\\", Erwise, and ViolaWWW.\\n\\nTim Berners-Lee built a 'browser' on Christmas Day 1990, and released it in August 1991, “WorldWideWeb”. It was renamed later.\\n\\n“Erwise” had the first graphical interface, made in Helsinki by graduate students but they lacked funds. With little documentation in English, it faded.\\n\\nViolaWWW was a sibling of the \\\"World Wide Web\\\", from Switzerland's CERN. Its father was a Berkeley grad fascinated by Apple's HyperCard. Despite its design, it couldn't be used on all.\\n\\nThen came Mosaic, funded by a new law in December 1991. In 18 months, a team in Illinois designed something that would be adapted for all kinds of \\\"bicycles\\\" for even novices for a fee.\\n\\nThen the prize changed hands again. Its creators went on to build Navigator. The walled gardens were emptying, and everyone was in a wild network.\\n\\nThe network kept growing more valuable.\\n\\n2877 Earth, The Necklace\\n\\nI'm riding a shuttle with a Detective Inspector back to my Consulate. A few weeks ago, I was back home, bailed out by friends out of a holding cell for 'drunk and disorderly'. Back home is far away - Mars.I'm barely in Earthspace for a few days, and only diplomatic immunity saves me. I remind myself it's worth it this time.\\n\\nI think back to my last moments back home, and on the transport:An honor guard to the gate. We owe our lives to each other. I thought about resigning but an old friend snapped me back.\\n\\n“You’re ready for boarding, Commander. The staff knows what to serve you. Water. That’s right. H20 for the duration. Sir.”\\n\\nThe Sergeant-Major smiled as he saluted, as did the rest. The last of a proud unit who gave their all for their world. Family.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you 'Sarge, I'm sure someone on the transport will take pity.\\\"\\n\\nEveryone laughed. Nobody wanted to say good-bye. It was time.\\n\\nThe Sergeant-Major about-faced and led the group away, and they sang. I dropped my bag in my quarters, and noticed a package. A case of spirits. I put it away. I would open it when I was back.\\n\\nI made my way to one of the transport's lounges. I was alone for a few minutes, with my water, and then someone walked over.\\n\\n\\\"Is this seat taken?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, please have a seat. What will you have?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I’ll have another of what you’re drinking.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Another water please. I'm Jacob.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Andreea.\\\"\\n\\nWater and polite conversation. What could possibly happen?\\n\\n[https://audius.co/trapnation/kanye-west-jail-bkaye-remix](https://audius.co/trapnation/kanye-west-jail-bkaye-remix)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LNb_yDER5Bv_WOMmnuzSX.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KS-ClumV-Pl67h7grgXQb.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1634184216,\"title\":\"1999: 7.3 Let A Million Nodes Bloom, 2877\"},\"digest\":\"C7Bc4fCjwJSl8Q_t-jsNEnzXp1Sa2PRLX1DO14SjKfQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"pYfp9jaqqEFh6czfiGHHY2RfWE6rUV1lGJVbJRm_RXixM5SWCITQvS97Ht8Xw6HEO8qYH-N_nlxCCPgOhHcPKA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"qcJbSoegTKSIkoOZXtyphiNCZ_Q3ornUUpB0PPWsAKY\"}"
