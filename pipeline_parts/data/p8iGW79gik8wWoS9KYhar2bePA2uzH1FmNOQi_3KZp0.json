"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Most people land into product management jobs from some other function. It could be Engineering, Design, Marketing, Consulting or what have you. While folks coming into the “World of Product” from different backgrounds is a net-positive trend at large and in fact some of the best product managers that I know, did actually start out in other functions/roles before transitioning into product management. \\n\\nNow, why is that really the case ? is a topic that justifies deeper exploration in its own right, I believe at a high level it is a function of \\\"Genius of the AND\\\", where these folks embrace the goodness from both the functions across a number of dimensions at the same time - example folks from Design background might be naturally inclined to think about Usability AND Desirability, whereas someone from Business background might be equally comfortable thinking about Viability and Desirability, so on and so forth.\\n\\nNonetheless, landing into the world of products from other functions is not without its share of trade-offs and can leave one exposed to blindspots. One, not only needs to be aware of these blind spots but should also deliberately work towards covering these over time. Now, I agree that in the fullness of time all great PMs realize these gaps are and they tend to fix these, what if there was a way to accelerate this learning curve. \\n\\nWell, that is what I intend to do with this post, help you overcome some of the common blindspots experienced by people as they transition from other functions into the product management function. Without further ado, let’s dive in.\\n\\n**Single Sensing Mechanism To Multiple Sensing Mechanisms**\\n\\nWe as humans are not very good at evaluating risk, although we sub-consciously avert it at times. As professionals, we learn to apply risk in a relatively narrow context. For instance, if someone is a designer they would be excellent at evaluating risks associated with the user experience (UX) of the product, such as; would the users be able to figure out how to use it? In the same vein, if someone is an Engineer they would be great at evaluating risks pertaining to the technical feasibility of the product, effectively answering; Can something even be built or not, is it even possible yet? and same goes for other functions as well such as Finance, Business, Legal or what have you.\\n\\nThis is great, although this same strength can become a weakness when one transition into a product management role, as in the world of product, these risks are not just needed to be evaluated in isolation, but also in combination and then looked at from the lens of prioritization and trade-offs. How does one mitigates these risks in combination and in the correct order can be non-trivial and something that a lot of product folks tend to struggle with.\\n\\nBring along your superpower to masterfully evaluate single-threaded risks, but make sure it does not become a hammer with which you try to nail every problem. Be sure to evaluate multi-threaded risks across all dimensions of the product.\\n\\n**Analysis and Synthesis**\\n\\nZoom In, Drill Down, Dive In. all functions have an equivalent of this expression, effectively meaning to break things down into small pieces and more formally known as analysis. Inevitably all professionals irrespective of the functional specialization get well trained on doing analysis of one form or the other.\\n\\n* If you are in Marketing, Market Size Analysis\\n* If you are in Engineering, Code Analysis\\n* In Design, UX Analysis or Usability Analysis\\n\\nThe analysis is also valuable in the world of product, although something that is unique to the product function is **Synthesis**\\n\\ni.e thinking about the big picture, breaking it down into small pieces, and then building those small pieces first and after building the small pieces,  combining them again to get to the big picture. \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nThese are the two common blindspots experienced by people as they transition from other functions into the product management function. What others do you think should be included here in your opinion?\",\"timestamp\":1633489714,\"title\":\"Common challenges transitioning into product management\"},\"digest\":\"QOhVC0xke2WQIaBClu--MrSYpcUFYiDhqr4dsBaIyOE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xbd11fb423e2517A35A0C3a796E25DA44B9F03b25\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xaQnobe9kj9Hpr-_o70bsJNv1xqYanIyrqIC-RxFC-Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2hzQyGG9NsMBGVf7Gon8BpcF6SKDugJwgQoOhiWB45I\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Bdgqy_rYyIKN6ff7gUPv5UOpgfYBTVtk0TIcJmSpTlVmTNlMM2MqNIr08f_caqq_6v_VRPUpkrYHMsFcGYHGPw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5e2f662b935e9f69a4fa0952bf458ba7b42db1379ae32c9c0a56158c783aedae052c67656a04ebd9212701b27102bdb790083b181e80587d865b4cab96c03daf1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xaQnobe9kj9Hpr-_o70bsJNv1xqYanIyrqIC-RxFC-Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2hzQyGG9NsMBGVf7Gon8BpcF6SKDugJwgQoOhiWB45I\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"QOhVC0xke2WQIaBClu--MrSYpcUFYiDhqr4dsBaIyOE\"}"
