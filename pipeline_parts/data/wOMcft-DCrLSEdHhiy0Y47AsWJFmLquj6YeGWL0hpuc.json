They are crypto-native objects, very similar to ETH and others, freely transmittable between wallets and interchangeable for other coins. Every kitty is unique with each element being codified to generate a unique combination of eyes, colour, tail etc.\\n\\nKids used to collect stickers and now grown-ups collect these ‘cards’ where every single one is unique, their ownership can be viewed on-chain, making them a perfect collectible to boast about. Once they got traction, the amount of trading activity in them was so large that it clogged the network, substantially slowing down all other transactions. Ultimately, with the excitement reaching its peak, one of them was sold for $170k.\\n\\n$170k for a digital image of a cat? If that’s not an indicator of a market bubble then it’s hard to imagine what it might be (it was). With the speculative mania fading away kitties slowed down, prices normalised and for most people it remained a memory of the good old bubble days.\\n\\nAs it turns out, however, this was yet another fundamental innovation in the crypto land, which opened doors to new realities.\\n\\n#### ***Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs)***\\n\\nThat’s the official name of a crypto ‘standard’ (think of it as a file type - pdf, jpeg etc). The ‘normal’ coins follow a certain standard which defines their properties, one of them being a free ability to swap one into another. The NFT standard allows for more creativity where unique content can be created right on the blockchain and can function as part the wider ecosystem with all the benefits of composability. In short, it allows to create digital art, collectibles and many other types of objects which were unthinkable before this.\\n\\n*Digital Art?* Sure:\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d7a7bdb-ac84-48db-bcb6-06755937bf8b\\\\_2274x1076.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d7a7bdb-ac84-48db-bcb6-06755937bf8b\\\\_2274x1076.png)\\n\\nThe logic of this is intuitive yet questionable. If physical art is understandable and has both investment and aesthetic value, this is little bit more confusing. Aesthetics - sure, but why can’t you just screenshot the same image? That’s the question that’s most often asked about these objects. Turns out, when a limited number of digital assets is created and you can prove you are rightful owner of the *original*, people attach value to it. Drawing parallels to the physical world, we might enjoy a Water Lilly Pond poster in our apartments but the original is far more desirable.\\n\\nNow let’s go one step deeper. For those of us engaged in social media, what’s the representation of our identity there?\\n\\n*Avatars - *how much would you be willing to pay for your profile picture to be a) unique; b) designed by a famous artist; c) you would have proof of ownership that it’s only yours; d) it easily sellable online at any time? Turns out, people would pay quite a bit.\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e3d6663-0016-4c2d-85ae-aec70c1a1fb4\\\\_2084x770.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e3d6663-0016-4c2d-85ae-aec70c1a1fb4\\\\_2084x770.png)\\n\\nThese are CryptoPunks -a collection of 10,000 unique characters on the Ethereum network.

Wouldn’t it be a great way for artists and content creators to monetise their brands and content?\\n\\nWhats’s the other content that can be owned, rented and sold?
