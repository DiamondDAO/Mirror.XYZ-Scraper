"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The world of Defi (or Decentralized Finance) has been largely the movement of importing traditional finance onto the blockchain, be it Defi1.0 or Defi2.0.\\n\\nHowever, while most of the methods of traditional finance has somehow found their way onto the blockchain, the greatest money-making secrets of the traditional hedge fund world has yet to do so. I am referring to the ability to make 20-30% per annum with just arbitrage using financial engineering. With the crypto world expecting a bear market and the Defi arsenal maturing, I think the time is almost ripe. With the inefficiencies of the crypto world and the deviations from tradfi, returns in excess of 40-50% on stablecoins alone is easily achievable (and already achieved). Note here that I am referring to arbitrage based on stablecoins pegged to the USD, not the wild hyper-inflationary coins based on Olympus DAO forks.\\n\\nBesides the well-known inefficiencies of the crypto markets, what fascinated me most about the crypto markets is that the protocols are paying me to use them! That would be a heresy in the world of tradfi - imagine the tradfi brokers paying me a commission for the privilege of having me use their service. And yet, that is exactly what happens when the protocols start giving me rewards.\\n\\nNow I am already making 30-40% doing stablecoin arbitrage alone, thanks to crypto market inefficiencies and financial engineering. When I extend the financial engineering principles to the rewards part of the equation as well, the annual returns can easily go up to 40-50%. Of course, some hard work is due - first in find the arbitrage opportunities then in structuring the trades. But all that is possible by combining tradfi principles with Defi tools.\",\"timestamp\":1640274707,\"title\":\"Bringing Hedge Fund Methods into Defi - Achieving 50% APY on stablecoin arbitrage\"},\"digest\":\"Zu0GIgOXGceYpZH-yhu09Yg3KZoNJOc8pkma3-ZXMao\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2B5822577ef7A021b35fE98b43CA241147cB9DdF\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"A0PomVHjWihNP86QyKZ76hWaTaY_YwlQ5f5jZ0p_Y54\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"sPCiSR1FRYzttsHAsM4HOZU4nMWSeK1XDf0fbhm3jUs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"kLEgcG_EM6OCpXeG5zIz-vsqXK9cobWb9-raN_QPnb80396cGym9DgD7q-5p3pIK_jHbON13HyB_IR3wsbswPQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x852019f0e856ffda58521878edaef9bba6a2dd01f7c68c16fa3d5728e7c1968634e62139659150220513d731cc2a83307b329a02e5a7859ef46446bee06680ca1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"A0PomVHjWihNP86QyKZ76hWaTaY_YwlQ5f5jZ0p_Y54\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"sPCiSR1FRYzttsHAsM4HOZU4nMWSeK1XDf0fbhm3jUs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Zu0GIgOXGceYpZH-yhu09Yg3KZoNJOc8pkma3-ZXMao\"}"
