The abuse of the\\nword Taste, v.13.  That the first Principle and foundation, in this as in\\neverything else, is Good Sense, v.40.   The chief Proof of it is to follow\\nNature even in works of mere Luxury and Elegance.  Instanced in\\nArchitecture and Gardening, where all must be adapted to the Genius and Use\\nof the Place, and the Beauties not forced into it, but resulting from it,\\nv.50.  How men are disappointed in their most expensive undertakings, for\\nwant of this true Foundation, without which nothing can please long, if at\\nall:  and the best Examples and Rules will but be perverted into something\\nburdensome or ridiculous, v.65, etc., to 92.  A description of the false\\nTaste of Magnificence; the first grand Error of which is to imagine that\\nGreatness consists in the size and dimension, instead of the Proportion and\\nHarmony of the whole, v.97, and the second, either in joining together\\nParts incoherent, or too minutely resembling, or in the Repetition of the\\nsame too frequently, v.105, etc.  A word or two of false Taste in Books, in\\nMusic, in Painting, even in Preaching and Prayer, and lastly in\\nEntertainments, v.133, etc.  Yet Providence is justified in giving Wealth\\nto be squandered in this manner, since it is dispersed to the poor and\\nlaborious part of mankind, v.169 (recurring to what is laid down in the\\nfirst book, Ep. ii., and in the Epistle preceding this, v.159, etc.).  What\\nare the proper objects of Magnificence, and a proper field for the Expense\\nof Great Men, v.177, etc., and finally, the Great and Public Works which\\nbecome a Prince, v.191 to the end.\\n\\n'Tis strange, the miser should his cares employ\\nTo gain those riches he can ne'er enjoy:\\nIs it less strange, the prodigal should waste\\nHis wealth, to purchase what he ne'er can taste?\\nNot for himself he sees, or hears, or eats;\\nArtists must choose his pictures, music, meats:\\nHe buys for Topham, drawings and designs,\\nFor Pembroke, statues, dirty gods, and coins;\\nRare monkish manuscripts for Hearne alone,\\nAnd books for Mead, and butterflies for Sloane.\\nThink we all these are for himself? no more\\nThan his fine wife, alas! or finer w\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*e.\\nFor what has Virro painted, built, and planted?\\nOnly to show, how many tastes he wanted.\\nWhat brought Sir Visto's ill-got wealth to waste?\\nSome demon whispered, \\\"Visto! have a taste.\\\"\\nHeaven visits with a taste the wealthy fool,\\nAnd needs no rod but Ripley with a rule.\\nSee! sportive Fate, to punish awkward pride,\\nBids Bubo build, and sends him such a guide.\\nA standing sermon, at each year's expense,\\nThat never coxcomb reached magnificence!\\nYou show us, Rome was glorious, not profuse,\\nAnd pompous buildings once were things of use.\\nYet shall, my lord, your just, your noble rules\\nFill half the land with imitating fools;\\nWho random drawings from your sheets shall take,\\nAnd of one beauty many blunders make;\\nLoad some vain church with old theatric state,\\nTurn arcs of triumph to a garden-gate;\\nReverse your ornaments, and hang them all\\nOn some patched dog-hole eked with ends of wall;\\nThen clap four slices of pilaster on 't,\\nThat, laced with bits of rustic, makes a front\\nShall call the winds through long arcades to roar,\\nProud to catch cold at a Venetian door;\\nConscious they act a true Palladian part,\\nAnd, if they starve, they starve by rules of art.\\nOft have you hinted to your brother peer\\nA certain truth, which many buy too dear:\\nSomething there is more needful than expense,\\nAnd something previous even to taste--'tis sense.\\nGood sense, which only is the gift of Heaven,\\nAnd though no science, fairly worth the seven:\\nA light, which in yourself you must perceive:\\nJones and Le Notre have it not to give.\\nTo build, to plant, whatever you intend,\\nTo rear the column, or the arch to bend,\\nTo swell the terrace, or to sink the grot;\\nIn all, let Nature never be forgot.\\nBut treat the goddess like a modest fair,\\nNor over-dress, nor leave her wholly bare;\\nLet not each beauty everywhere be spied,\\nWhere half the skill is decently to hide.\\nHe gains all points, who pleasingly confounds,\\nSurprises, varies, and conceals the bounds.\\nConsult the genius of the place in all;\\nThat tells the waters or to rise or fall,\\nOr helps the ambitious hill the heavens to scale,\\nOr scoops in circling theatres the vale;\\nCalls in the country, catches opening glades,\\nJoins willing woods, and varies shades from shades;\\nNow breaks, or now directs, the intending lines;\\nPaints as you plant, and, as you work, designs.\\nStill follow sense, of every art the soul,\\nParts answering parts shall slide into a whole,\\nSpontaneous beauties all around advance,\\nStart even from difficulty, strike from chance;\\nNature shall join you; Time shall make it grow\\nA work to wonder at--perhaps a Stowe.\\nWithout it, proud Versailles, thy glory falls;\\nAnd Nero's terraces desert their walls:\\nThe vast parterres a thousand hands shall make;\\nLo!

ARBUTHNOT.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nTO THE FIRST PUBLICATION OF THIS EPISTLE.\\n\\nThis Paper is a sort of bill of complaint, begun many years since, and\\ndrawn up by snatches, as the several occasions offered.  I had no thoughts\\nof publishing it, till it pleased some persons of rank and fortune (the\\nauthors of \\\"Verses to the Imitator of Horace,\\\" and of an \\\"Epistle to a\\nDoctor of Divinity from a Nobleman at Hampton Court\\\") to attack, in a very\\nextraordinary manner, not only my writings (of which, being public, the\\npublic is judge), but my person, morals, and family, whereof, to those who\\nknow me not, a truer information may be requisite.  Being divided between\\nthe necessity to say something of myself, and my own laziness to undertake\\nso awkward a task, I thought it the shortest way to put the last hand to\\nthis Epistle.  If it have anything pleasing, it will be that by which I am\\nmost desirous to please, the truth and the sentiment; and if anything\\noffensive, it will be only to those I am least sorry to offend, the vicious\\nor the ungenerous.\\n\\nMany will know their own pictures in it, there being not a circumstance but\\nwhat is true; but I have, for the most part, spared their names, and they\\nmay escape being laughed at if they please.\\n\\nI would have some of them know, it was owing to the request of the learned\\nand candid friend to whom it is inscribed, that I make not as free use of\\ntheirs as they have done of mine.  However, I shall have this advantage and\\nhonour on my side, that whereas, by their proceeding, any abuse may be\\ndirected at any man, no injury can possibly be done by mine, since a\\nnameless character can never be found out but by its truth and likeness.--\\nP.\\n\\nEPISTLE TO DR. ARBUTHNOT,\\n\\nBEING THE\\n\\nPROLOGUE TO THE SATIRES.\\n\\nP.  Shut, shut the door, good John! fatigued, I said,\\nTie up the knocker, say I'm sick, I'm dead.\\nThe dog-star rages! nay 'tis past a doubt,\\nAll Bedlam, or Parnassus, is let out:\\nFire in each eye, and papers in each hand,\\nThey rave, recite, and madden round the land.\\nWhat walls can guard me, or what shades can hide?\\nThey pierce my thickets, through my grot they glide;\\nBy land, by water, they renew the charge;\\nThey stop the chariot, and they board the barge.\\nNo place is sacred, not the Church is free;\\nEven Sunday shines no Sabbath Day to me;\\nThen from the Mint walks forth the man of rhyme,\\nHappy to catch me just at dinner-time.\\nIs there a parson, much bemused in beer,\\nA maudlin poetess, a rhyming peer,\\nA clerk, foredoomed his father's soul to cross,\\nWho pens a stanza when he should engross?\\nIs there, who, locked from ink and paper, scrawls\\nWith desperate charcoal round his darkened walls?\\nAll fly to Twitenham, and in humble strain\\nApply to me, to keep them mad or vain.\\nArthur, whose giddy son neglects the laws,\\nImputes to me and my damned works the cause:\\nPoor Cornus sees his frantic wife elope,\\nAnd curses wit, and poetry, and Pope.\\nFriend to my life! (which did not you prolong,\\nThe world had wanted many an idle song)\\nWhat drop or nostrum can this plague remove?\\nOr which must end me, a fool's wrath or love?\\nA dire dilemma! either way I'm sped,\\nIf foes, they write, if friends, they read me dead.\\nSeized and tied down to judge, how wretched I!\\nWho can't be silent, and who will not lie.\\nTo laugh, were want of goodness and of grace,\\nAnd to be grave, exceeds all power of face.\\nI sit with sad civility, I read\\nWith honest anguish, and an aching head;\\nAnd drop at last, but in unwilling ears,\\nThis saving counsel, \\\"Keep your piece nine years.\\\"\\n\\\"Nine years!\\\" cries he, who high in Drury Lane,\\nLulled by soft zephyrs through the broken pane,\\nRhymes ere he wakes, and prints before term ends,\\nObliged by hunger, and request of friends:\\n\\\"The piece, you think, is incorrect? why, take it,\\nI'm all submission, what you'd have it, make it.\\\"\\nThree things another's modest wishes bound,\\nMy friendship, and a prologue, and ten pound.\\nPitholeon sends to me:  \\\"You know his Grace,\\nI want a patron; ask him for a place.\\\"\\n'Pitholeon libelled me'--\\\"but here's a letter\\nInforms you, sir, 'twas when he knew no better.\\nDare you refuse him?  Curll invites to dine,\\nHe'll write a journal, or he'll turn divine.\\\"\\nBless me! a packet.--\\\"'Tis a stranger sues,\\nA virgin tragedy, an orphan muse.\\\"\\nIf I dislike it, \\\"Furies, death and rage!\\\"\\nIf I approve, \\\"Commend it to the stage.\\\"\\nThere (thank my stars) my whole commission ends,\\nThe players and I are, luckily, no friends,\\nFired that the house reject him, \\\"\\\\`Sdeath I'll print it,\\nAnd shame the fools--Your interest, sir, with Lintot!\\\"\\n'Lintot, dull rogue! will think your price too much:'\\n\\\"Not, sir, if you revise it, and retouch.\\\"\\nAll my demurs but double his attacks;\\nAt last he whispers, \\\"Do; and we go snacks.\\\"\\nGlad of a quarrel, straight I clap the door,\\nSir, let me see your works and you no more.\\n'Tis sung, when Midas' ears began to spring\\n(Midas, a sacred person and a king),\\nHis very minister who spied them first\\n(Some say his queen) was forced to speak, or burst.\\nAnd is not mine, my friend, a sorer case,\\nWhen every coxcomb perks them in my face?\\nA.  Good friend, forbear! you deal in dangerous things.\\nI'd never name queens, ministers, or kings;\\nKeep close to ears, and those let asses prick;\\n'Tis nothing--  P.  Nothing? if they bite and kick?\\nOut with it, Dunciad! let the secret pass,\\nThat secret to each fool, that he's an ass:\\nThe truth once told (and wherefore should we lie?)\\nThe Queen of Midas slept, and so may I.\\nYou think this cruel? take it for a rule,\\nNo creature smarts so little as a fool.\\nLet peals of laughter, Codrus! round thee break,\\nThou unconcerned canst hear the mighty crack:\\nPit, box, and gallery in convulsions hurled,\\nThou stand'st unshook amidst a bursting world.\\nWho shames a scribbler? break one cobweb through,\\nHe spins the slight, self-pleasing thread anew:\\nDestroy his fib or sophistry, in vain,\\nThe creature's at his dirty work again,\\nThroned in the centre of his thin designs,\\nProud of a vast extent of flimsy lines!\\nWhom have I hurt? has poet yet, or peer,\\nLost the arched eyebrow, or Parnassian sneer?\\nAnd has not Colley still his lord, and w\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*e?\\nHis butchers Henley, his free-masons Moore?\\nDoes not one table Bavius still admit?\\nStill to one bishop Philips seem a wit?\\nStill Sappho--  A.  Hold! for God's sake--you'll offend,\\nNo names!--be calm!--learn prudence of a friend!\\nI too could write, and I am twice as tall;\\nBut foes like these--  P.  One flatterer's worse than all.\\nOf all mad creatures, if the learned are right,\\nIt is the slaver kills, and not the bite.\\nA fool quite angry is quite innocent:\\nAlas! 'tis ten times worse when they repent.\\nOne dedicates in high heroic prose,\\nAnd ridicules beyond a hundred foes:\\nOne from all Grubstreet will my fame defend,\\nAnd more abusive, calls himself my friend.\\nThis prints my letters, that expects a bribe,\\nAnd others roar aloud, \\\"Subscribe, subscribe.\\\"\\nThere are, who to my person pay their court:\\nI cough like Horace, and, though lean, am short,\\nAmmon's great son one shoulder had too high,\\nSuch Ovid's nose, and \\\"Sir! you have an eye\\\"--\\nGo on, obliging creatures, make me see\\nAll that disgraced my betters, met in me.\\nSay for my comfort, languishing in bed,\\n\\\"Just so immortal Maro held his head:\\\"\\nAnd when I die, be sure you let me know\\nGreat Homer died three thousand years ago.\\nWhy did I write? what sin to me unknown\\nDipped me in ink, my parents', or my own?\\nAs yet a child, nor yet a fool to fame,\\nI lisped in numbers, for the numbers came.\\nI left no calling for this idle trade,\\nNo duty broke, no father disobeyed.\\nThe Muse but served to ease some friend, not wife,\\nTo help me through this long disease, my life,\\nTo second, Arbuthnot! thy art and care,\\nAnd teach the being you preserved, to bear.\\nBut why then publish? Granville the polite,\\nAnd knowing Walsh, would tell me I could write;\\nWell-natured Garth, inflamed with early praise;\\nAnd Congreve loved, and Swift endured my lays;\\nThe courtly Talbot, Somers, Sheffield, read;\\nEven mitred Rochester would nod the head,\\nAnd St. John's self (great Dryden's friends before)\\nWith open arms received one poet more.\\nHappy my studies, when by these approved!\\nHappier their author, when by these beloved!\\nFrom these the world will judge of men and books,\\nNot from the Burnets, Oldmixons, and Cookes.\\nSoft were my numbers; who could take offence,\\nWhile pure description held the place of sense?\\nLike gentle Fanny's was my flowery theme,\\nA painted mistress, or a purling stream.\\nYet then did Gildon draw his venal quill;--\\nI wished the man a dinner, and sat still.\\nYet then did Dennis rave in furious fret;\\nI never answered--I was not in debt.\\nIf want provoked, or madness made them print,\\nI waged no war with Bedlam or the Mint.\\nDid some more sober critic come abroad;\\nIf wrong, I smiled; if right, I kissed the rod.\\nPains, reading, study, are their just pretence,\\nAnd all they want is spirit, taste, and sense.\\nCommas and points they set exactly right,\\nAnd 'twere a sin to rob them of their mite.\\nYet ne'er one sprig of laurel graced these ribalds,\\nFrom slashing Bentley down to p---g Tibalds:\\nEach wight, who reads not, and but scans and spells,\\nEach word-catcher, that lives on syllables,\\nEven such small critics some regard may claim,\\nPreserved in Milton's or in Shakespeare's name.\\nPretty! in amber to observe the forms\\nOf hairs, or straws, or dirt, or grubs, or worms!\\nThe things, we know, are neither rich nor rare,\\nBut wonder how the devil they got there.\\nWere others angry:  I excused them too;\\nWell might they rage, I gave them but their due.\\nA man's true merit 'tis not hard to find;\\nBut each man's secret standard in his mind,\\nThat casting-weight pride adds to emptiness,\\nThis, who can gratify? for who can guess?\\nThe bard whom pilfered pastorals renown,\\nWho turns a Persian tale for half a crown,\\nJust writes to make his barrenness appear,\\nAnd strains, from hard-bound brains, eight lines a year;\\nHe, who still wanting, though he lives on theft,\\nSteals much, spends little, yet has nothing left:\\nAnd he, who now to sense, now nonsense leaning,\\nMeans not, but blunders round about a meaning:\\nAnd he, whose fustian's so sublimely bad,\\nIt is not poetry, but prose run mad:\\nAll these, my modest satire bade translate,\\nAnd owned that nine such poets made a Tate.\\nHow did they fume, and stamp, and roar, and chafe\\nAnd swear not Addison himself was safe.\\nPeace to all such! but were there one whose fires\\nTrue genius kindles, and fair fame inspires;\\nBlessed with each talent and each art to please,\\nAnd born to write, converse, and live with ease:\\nShould such a man, too fond to rule alone,\\nBear, like the Turk, no brother near the throne.\\nView him with scornful, yet with jealous eyes,\\nAnd hate for arts that caused himself to rise;\\nDamn with faint praise, assent with civil leer,\\nAnd without sneering, teach the rest to sneer;\",\"timestamp\":1639291023,\"title\":\"And Worldly crying coals from street to street,\\nWhom with a wig so wild, and mien so mazed,\"},\"digest\":\"fQHORyAF9uAv8JQ3asbVHm2GQAXu02Q7iHDjW1LOsVg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6b55Ba15E3e103d91f6dec37dd48B84ddF5B245C\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kP8Z2g9kQRdk_c_Yw-6Cx5-x8bTB1W9WVYYT9Mgl228\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ve6ZMSfUjBK5elgdxkwnDGcp-wPoLgye6K0MkdQ0PBI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"gHeQgcbdBG_Cm2U-UyuXBz5NIsB_GBzB4fBsXnRoo2za0Z75rVbFk-3UTYoIDQaqrZdOQ-WaNAhtkCpyDXTGhQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x90b92ebd917ee40bbd1406dbfc44f2a2b0ebbe3fb22032a440af79e3063a89d63ab6ebc908ade936e25f166ab5493d6832b0a6bba34cda84a78310088de408bb1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kP8Z2g9kQRdk_c_Yw-6Cx5-x8bTB1W9WVYYT9Mgl228\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ve6ZMSfUjBK5elgdxkwnDGcp-wPoLgye6K0MkdQ0PBI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"fQHORyAF9uAv8JQ3asbVHm2GQAXu02Q7iHDjW1LOsVg\"}"
