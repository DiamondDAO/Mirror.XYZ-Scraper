"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"it enables us, among other things, to merge our identity into theirs often so completely that their sorrows and their delights become our own. So poor Amrah, aloof and hiding her face, knew the transformation the lepers were undergoing without a word spoken to her--knew it, and shared all their feeling to the full. Her countenance, her words, her whole manner, betrayed her condition; and with swift presentiment he connected it with the women he had just passed: he felt her presence there at that time was in some way associated with them, and turned hastily as they arose to their feet. His heart stood still, he became rooted in his tracks--dumb past outcry--awe-struck.\\n\\nThe woman he had seen before the Nazarene was standing with her hands clasped and eyes streaming, looking towards heaven. The mere transformation would have been a sufficient surprise; but it was the least of the causes of his emotion. Could he be mistaken? Never was there in life a stranger so like his mother; and like her as she was the day the Roman snatched her from him. There was but one difference to mar the identity--the hair of this person was a little streaked with gray; yet that was not impossible of reconcilement, since the intelligence which had directed the miracle might have taken into consideration the natural effects of the passage of years. And who was it by her side, if not Tirzah?--fair, beautiful, perfect, more mature, but in all other respects exactly the same in appearance as when she looked with him over the parapet the morning of the accident to Gratus. He had given them over as dead, and time had accustomed him to the bereavement; he had not ceased mourning for them, yet, as something distinguishable, they had simply dropped out of his plans and dreams. Scarcely believing his senses, he laid his hand upon the servant's head, and asked, tremulously,\\n\\n\\\"Amrah, Amrah--my mother! Tirzah! tell me if I see aright.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Speak to them, O master, speak to them!\\\" she said.\\n\\nHe waited no longer, but ran, with outstretched arms, crying, \\\"Mother! mother! Tirzah! Here I am!\\\"\\n\\nThey heard his call, and with a cry as loving started to meet him. Suddenly the mother stopped, drew back, and uttered the old alarm,\\n\\n\\\"Stay, Judah, my son; come not nearer. Unclean, unclean!\\\"\\n\\nThe utterance was not from habit, grown since the dread disease struck her, as much as fear; and the fear was but another form of the ever-thoughtful maternal love. Though they were healed in person, the taint of the scourge might be in their garments ready for communication. He had no such thought. They were before him; he had called them, they had answered. Who or what should keep them from him now? Next moment the three, so long separated, were mingling their tears in each other's arms.\\n\\nThe first ecstasy over, the mother said, \\\"In this happiness, O my children, let us not be ungrateful. Let us begin life anew by acknowledgment of him to whom we are all so indebted.\\\"\\n\\nThey fell upon their knees, Amrah with the rest; and the prayer of the elder outspoken was as a psalm.\\n\\nTirzah repeated it word for word; so did Ben-Hur, but not with the same clear mind and questionless faith; for when they were risen, he asked,\\n\\n\\\"In Nazareth, where the man was born, mother, they call him the son of a carpenter. What is he?\\\"\\n\\nHer eyes rested upon him with all their old tenderness, and she answered as she had answered the Nazarene himself--\\n\\n\\\"He is the Messiah.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And whence has he his power?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We may know by the use he makes of it. Can you tell me any ill he has done?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"By that sign then I answer, He has his power from God.\\\"\\n\\nIt is not an easy thing to shake off in a moment the expectations nurtured through years until they have become essentially a part of us; and though Ben-Hur asked himself what the vanities of the world were to such a one, his ambition was obdurate and would not down. He persisted as men do yet every day in measuring the Christ by himself. How much better if we measured ourselves by the Christ!\\n\\nNaturally, the mother was the first to think of the cares of life.\\n\\n\\\"What shall we do now, my son? Where shall we go?\\\"\\n\\nThen Ben-Hur, recalled to duty, observed how completely every trace of the scourge had disappeared from his restored people; that each had back her perfection of person; that, as with Naaman when he came up out of the water, their flesh had come again like unto the flesh of a little child; and he took off his cloak, and threw it over Tirzah.\\n\\n\\\"Take it,\\\" he said, smiling; \\\"the eye of the stranger would have shunned you before, now it shall not offend you.\\\"\\n\\nThe act exposed a sword belted to his side.\\n\\n\\\"Is it a time of war?\\\" asked the mother, anxiously.\\n\\n\\\"No.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, then, are you armed?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It may be necessary to defend the Nazarene.\\\"\\n\\nThus Ben-Hur evaded the whole truth.\\n\\n\\\"Has he enemies? Who are they?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Alas, mother, they are not all Romans!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is he not of Israel, and a man of peace?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There was never one more so; but in the opinion of the rabbis and teachers he is guilty of a great crime.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What crime?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In his eyes the uncircumcised Gentile is as worthy favor as a Jew of the strictest habit. He preaches a new dispensation.\\\"\\n\\nThe mother was silent, and they moved to the shade of the tree by the rock. Calming his impatience to have them home again and hear their story, he showed them the necessity of obedience to the law governing in cases like theirs, and in conclusion called the Arab, bidding him take the horses to the gate by Bethesda and await him there; whereupon they set out by the way of the Mount of Offence. The return was very different from the coming; they walked rapidly and with ease, and in good time reached a tomb newly made near that of Absalom, overlooking the depths of Cedron. Finding it unoccupied, the women took possession, while he went on hastily to make the preparations required for their new condition.\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nBen-Hur pitched two tents out on the Upper Cedron east a short space of the Tombs of the Kings, and furnished them with every comfort at his command; and thither, without loss of time, he conducted his mother and sister, to remain until the examining priest could certify their perfect cleansing.\\n\\nIn course of the duty, the young man had subjected himself to such serious defilement as to debar him from participation in the ceremonies of the great feast, then near at hand. He could not enter the least sacred of the courts of the Temple. Of necessity, not less than choice, therefore, he stayed at the tents with his beloved people. There was a great deal to hear from them, and a great deal to tell them of himself.\\n\\nStories such as theirs--sad experiences extending through a lapse of years, sufferings of body, acuter sufferings of mind--are usually long in the telling, the incidents seldom following each other in threaded connection. He listened to the narrative and all they told him, with outward patience masking inward feeling. In fact, his hatred of Rome and Romans reached a higher mark than ever; his desire for vengeance became a thirst which attempts at reflection only intensified. In the almost savage bitterness of his humor many mad impulses took hold of him. The opportunities of the highways presented themselves with singular force of temptation; he thought seriously of insurrection in Galilee; even the sea, ordinarily a retrospective horror to him, stretched itself map-like before his fancy, laced and interlaced with lines of passage crowded with imperial plunder and imperial travellers; but the better judgment matured in calmer hours was happily too firmly fixed to be supplanted by present passion however strong. Each mental venture in reach of new expedients brought him back to the old conclusion--that there could be no sound success except in a war involving all Israel in solid union; and all musing upon the subject, all inquiry, all hope, ended where they began--in the Nazarene and his purposes.\\n\\nAt odd moments the excited schemer found a pleasure in fashioning a speech for that person:\\n\\n\\\"Hear, O Israel! I am he, the promised of God, born King of the Jews--come to you with the dominion spoken of by the prophets. Rise now, and lay hold on the world!\\\"\\n\\nWould the Nazarene but speak these few words, what a tumult would follow! How many mouths performing the office of trumpets would take them up and blow them abroad for the massing of armies!\\n\\nWould he speak them?\\n\\nAnd eager to begin the work, and answering in the worldly way, Ben-Hur lost sight of the double nature of the man, and of the other possibility, that the divine in him might transcend the human. In the miracle of which Tirzah and his mother were the witnesses even more nearly than himself, he saw and set apart and dwelt upon a power ample enough to raise and support a Jewish crown over the wrecks of the Italian, and more than ample to remodel society, and convert mankind into one purified happy family; and when that work was done, could any one say the peace which might then be ordered without hindrance was not a mission worthy a son of God? Could any one then deny the Redeemership of the Christ? And discarding all consideration of political consequences, what unspeakable personal glory there would then be to him as a man? It was not in the nature of any mere mortal to refuse such a career.\\n\\nMeantime down the Cedron, and in towards Bezetha, especially on the roadsides quite up to the Damascus Gate, the country filled rapidly with all kinds of temporary shelters for pilgrims to the Passover. Ben-Hur visited the strangers, and talked with them; and returning to his tents, he was each time more and more astonished at the vastness of their numbers. And when he further discovered that every part of the world was represented among them--cities upon both shores of the Mediterranean far off as the Pillars of the West, river-towns in distant India, provinces in northernmost Europe; and that, though they frequently saluted him with tongues unacquainted with a syllable of the old Hebrew of the fathers, these representatives had all the same object--celebration of the notable feast--an idea tinged mistily with superstitious fancy forced itself upon him. Might he not after all have misunderstood the Nazarene? Might not that person by patient waiting be covering silent preparation, and proving his fitness for the glorious task before him? How much better this time for the movement than that other when, by Gennesaret, the Galileans would have forced assumption of the crown? Then the support would have been limited to a few thousands; now his proclamation would be responded to by millions--who could say how many? Pursuing this theory to its conclusions, Ben-Hur moved amidst brilliant promises, and glowed with the thought that the melancholy man, under gentle seeming and wondrous self-denial, was in fact carrying in disguise the subtlety of a politician and the genius of a soldier.\\n\\nSeveral times also, in the meanwhile, low-set, brawny men, bareheaded and black-bearded, came and asked for Ben-Hur at the tent; his interviews with them were always apart; and to his mother's question who they were he answered,\\n\\n\\\"Some good friends of mine from Galilee.\\\"\\n\\nThrough them he kept informed of the movements of the Nazarene, and of the schemes of the Nazarene's enemies, Rabbinical and Roman. That the good man's life was in danger, he knew; but that there were any bold enough to attempt to take it at that time, he could not believe. It seemed too securely intrenched in a great fame and an assured popularity. The very vastness of the attendance in and about the city brought with it a seeming guaranty of safety. And yet, to say truth, Ben-Hur's confidence rested most certainly upon the miraculous power of the Christ. Pondering the subject in the purely human view, that the master of such authority over life and death, used so frequently for the good of others, would not exert it in care of himself was simply as much past belief as it was past understanding.\\n\\nNor should it be forgotten that all these were incidents of occurrence between the twenty-first day of March--counting by the modern calendar--and the twenty-fifth. The evening of the latter day Ben-Hur yielded to his impatience, and rode to the city, leaving behind him a promise to return in the night.\\n\\nThe horse was fresh, and choosing his own gait, sped swiftly. The eyes of the clambering vines winked at the rider from the garden fences on the way; there was nothing else to see him, nor child nor woman nor man. Through the rocky float in the hollows of the road the agate hoofs drummed, ringing like cups of steel; but without notice from any stranger. In the houses passed there were no tenants; the fires by the tent-doors were out; the road was deserted; for this was the first Passover eve, and the hour \\\"between the evenings\\\" when the visiting millions crowded the city, and the slaughter of lambs in offering reeked the fore-courts of the Temple, and the priests in ordered lines caught the flowing blood and carried it swiftly to the dripping altars--when all was haste and hurry, racing with the stars fast coming with the signal after which the roasting and the eating and the singing might go on, but not the preparation more.\\n\\nThrough the great northern gate the rider rode, and lo! Jerusalem before the fall, in ripeness of glory, illuminated for the Lord.\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nBen-Hur alighted at the gate of the khan from which the three Wise Men more than thirty years before departed, going down to Bethlehem. There, in keeping of his Arab followers, he left the horse, and shortly after was at the wicket of his father's house, and in a yet briefer space in the great chamber. He called for Malluch first; that worthy being out, he sent a salutation to his friends the merchant and the Egyptian. They were being carried abroad to see the celebration. The latter, he was informed, was very feeble, and in a state of deep dejection.\\n\\nYoung people of that time who were supposed hardly to know their own hearts indulged the habit of politic indirection quite as much as young people in the same condition indulge it in this time; so when Ben-Hur inquired for the good Balthasar, and with grave courtesy desired to know if he would be pleased to see him, he really addressed the daughter a notice of his arrival. While the servant was answering for the elder, the curtain of the doorway was drawn aside, and the younger Egyptian came in, and walked--or floated, upborne in a white cloud of the gauzy raiment she so loved and lived in--to the centre of the chamber, where the light cast by lamps from the seven-armed brazen stick planted upon the floor was the strongest. With her there was no fear of light.\\n\\nThe servant left the two alone.\\n\\nIn the excitement occasioned by the events of the few days past Ben-Hur had scarcely given a thought to the fair Egyptian. If she came to his mind at all, it was merely as a briefest pleasure, a suggestion of a delight which could wait for him, and was waiting.\\n\\nBut now the influence of the woman revived with all its force the instant Ben-Hur beheld her. He advanced to her eagerly, but stopped and gazed. Such a change he had never seen!\\n\\nTheretofore she had been a lover studious to win him--in manner all warmth, each glance an admission, each action an avowal. She had showered him with incense of flattery. While he was present, she had impressed him with her admiration; going away, he carried the impression with him to remain a delicious expectancy hastening his return. It was for him the painted eyelids drooped lowest over the lustrous almond eyes; for him the love-stories caught from the professionals abounding in the streets of Alexandria were repeated with emphasis and lavishment of poetry; for him endless exclamations of sympathy, and smiles, and little privileges with hand and hair and cheek and lips, and songs of the Nile, and displays of jewelry, and subtleties of lace in veils and scarfs, and other subtleties not less exquisite in flosses of Indian silk. The idea, old as the oldest of peoples, that beauty is the reward of the hero had never such realism as she contrived for his pleasure; insomuch that he could not doubt he was her hero; she avouched it in a thousand artful ways as natural with her as her beauty--winsome ways reserved, it would seem, by the passionate genius of old Egypt for its daughters.\\n\\nSuch the Egyptian had been to Ben-Hur from the night of the boat-ride on the lake in the Orchard of Palms. But now!\\n\\nElsewhere in this volume the reader may have observed a term of somewhat indefinite meaning used reverently in a sacred connection; we repeat it now with a general application. There are few persons who have not a double nature, the real and the acquired; the latter a kind of addendum resulting from education, which in time often perfects it into a part of the being as unquestionable as the first. Leaving the thought to the thoughtful, we proceed to say that now the real nature of the Egyptian made itself manifest.\\n\\nIt was not possible for her to have received a stranger with repulsion more incisive; yet she was apparently as passionless as a statue, only the small head was a little tilted, the nostrils a little drawn, and the sensuous lower lip pushed the upper the least bit out of its natural curvature.\\n\\nShe was the first to speak.\\n\\n\\\"Your coming is timely, O son of Hur,\\\" she said, in a voice sharply distinct. \\\"I wish to thank you for hospitality; after to-morrow I may not have the opportunity to do so.\\\"\\n\\nBen-Hur bowed slightly without taking his eyes from her.\\n\\n\\\"I have heard of a custom which the dice-players observe with good result among themselves,\\\" she continued. \\\"When the game is over, they refer to their tablets and cast up their accounts; then they libate the gods and put a crown upon the happy winner. We have had a game--it has lasted through many days and nights. Why, now that it is at an end, shall not we see to which the chaplet belongs?\\\"\\n\\nYet very watchful, Ben-Hur answered, lightly, \\\"A man may not balk a woman bent on having her way.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tell me,\\\" she continued, inclining her head, and permitting the sneer to become positive--\\\"tell me, O prince of Jerusalem, where is he, that son of the carpenter of Nazareth, and son not less of God, from whom so lately such mighty things were expected?\\\"\\n\\nHe waved his hand impatiently, and replied, \\\"I am not his keeper.\\\"\\n\\nThe beautiful head sank forward yet lower.\\n\\n\\\"Has he broken Rome to pieces?\\\"\\n\\nAgain, but with anger, Ben-Hur raised his hand in deprecation.\\n\\n\\\"Where has he seated his capital?\\\" she proceeded. \\\"Cannot I go see his throne and its lions of bronze? And his palace--he raised the dead; and to such a one, what is it to raise a golden house? He has but to stamp his foot and say the word, and the house is, pillared like Karnak, and wanting nothing.\\\"\\n\\nThere was by this time slight ground left to believe her playing; the questions were offensive, and her manner pointed with unfriendliness; seeing which, he on his side became more wary, and said, with good humor, \\\"O Egypt, let us wait another day, even another week, for him, the lions, and the palace.\\\"\\n\\nShe went on without noticing the suggestion.\\n\\n\\\"And how is it I see you in that garb? Such is not the habit of governors in India or vice-kings elsewhere. I saw the satrap of Teheran once, and he wore a turban of silk and a cloak of cloth of gold, and the hilt and scabbard of his sword made me dizzy with their splendor of precious stones. I thought Osiris had lent him a glory from the sun. I fear you have not entered upon your kingdom--the kingdom I was to share with you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The daughter of my wise guest is kinder than she imagines herself; she is teaching me that Isis may kiss a heart without making it better.\\\"\\n\\nBen-Hur spoke with cold courtesy, and Iras, after playing with the pendent solitaire of her necklace of coins, rejoined, \\\"For a Jew, the son of Hur is clever. I saw your dreaming Caesar make his entry into Jerusalem. You told us he would that day proclaim himself King of the Jews from the steps of the Temple. I beheld the procession descend the mountain bringing him. I heard their singing. They were beautiful with palms in motion. I looked everywhere among them for a figure with a promise of royalty--a horseman in purple, a chariot with a driver in shining brass, a stately warrior behind an orbed shield, rivalling his spear in stature. I looked for his guard. It would have been pleasant to have seen a prince of Jerusalem and a cohort of the legions of Galilee.\\\"\\n\\nShe flung her listener a glance of provoking disdain, then laughed heartily, as if the ludicrousness of the picture in her mind were too strong for contempt.\\n\\n\\\"Instead of a Sesostris returning in triumph or a Caesar helmed and sworded--ha, ha, ha!--I saw a man with a woman's face and hair, riding an ass's colt, and in tears. The King! the Son of God! the Redeemer of the world! Ha, ha, ha!\\\"\\n\\nIn spite of himself, Ben-Hur winced.\\n\\n\\\"I did not quit my place, O prince of Jerusalem,\\\" she said, before he could recover. \\\"I did not laugh. I said to myself, 'Wait. In the Temple he will glorify himself as becomes a hero about to take possession of the world.' I saw him enter the Gate of Shushan and the Court of the Women. I saw him stop and stand before the Gate Beautiful. There were people with me on the porch and in the courts, and on the cloisters and on the steps of the three sides of the Temple there were other people--I will say a million of people, all waiting breathlessly to hear his proclamation. The pillars were not more still than we. Ha, ha, ha! I fancied I heard the axles of the mighty Roman machine begin to crack. Ha, ha, ha! O prince, by the soul of Solomon, your King of the World drew his gown about him and walked away, and out by the farthest gate, nor opened his mouth to say a word; and--the Roman machine is running yet!\\\"\\n\\nIn simple homage to a hope that instant lost--a hope which, as it began to fall and while it was falling, he unconsciously followed with a parting look down to its disappearance--Ben-Hur lowered his eyes.\\n\\nAt no previous time, whether when Balthasar was plying him with arguments, or when miracles were being done before his face, had the disputed nature of the Nazarene been so plainly set before him. The best way, after all, to reach an understanding of the divine is by study of the human. In the things superior to men we may always look to find God. So with the picture given by the Egyptian of the scene when the Nazarene turned from the Gate Beautiful; its central theme was an act utterly beyond performance by a man under control of merely human inspirations. A parable to a parable-loving people, it taught what the Christ had so often asserted--that his mission was not political. There was not much more time for thought of all this than that allowed for a common respiration; yet the idea took fast hold of Ben-Hur, and in the same instant he followed his hope of vengeance out of sight, and the man with the woman's face and hair, and in tears, came near to him--near enough to leave something of his spirit behind.\\n\\n\\\"Daughter of Balthasar,\\\" he said, with dignity, \\\"if this be the game of which you spoke to me, take the chaplet--I accord it yours. Only let us make an end of words. That you have a purpose I am sure. To it, I pray, and I will answer you; then let us go our several ways, and forget we ever met. Say on; I will listen, but not to more of that which you have given me.\\\"\\n\\nShe regarded him intently a moment, as if determining what to do--possibly she might have been measuring his will--then she said, coldly, \\\"You have my leave--go.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Peace to you,\\\" he responded, and walked away.\\n\\nAs he was about passing out of the door, she called to him.\\n\\n\\\"A word.\\\"\\n\\nHe stopped where he was, and looked back.\\n\\n\\\"Consider all I know about you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"O most fair Egyptian,\\\" he said, returning, \\\"what all do you know about me?\\\"\\n\\nShe looked at him absently.\\n\\n\\\"You are more of a Roman, son of Hur, then any of your Hebrew brethren.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Am I so unlike my countrymen?\\\" he asked, indifferently.\\n\\n\\\"The demi-gods are all Roman now,\\\" she rejoined.\\n\\n\\\"And therefore you will tell me what more you know about me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The likeness is not lost upon me. It might induce me to save you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Save me!\\\"\\n\\nThe pink-stained fingers toyed daintily with the lustrous pendant at the throat, and her voice was exceeding low and soft; only a tapping on the floor with her silken sandal admonished him to have a care.\\n\\n\\\"There was a Jew, an escaped galley-slave, who killed a man in the Palace of Idernee,\\\" she began, slowly.\\n\\nBen-Hur was startled.\\n\\n\\\"The same Jew slew a Roman soldier before the Market-place here in Jerusalem; the same Jew has three trained legions from Galilee to seize the Roman governor to-night; the same Jew has alliances perfected for war upon Rome, and Ilderim the Sheik is one of his partners.\\\"\\n\\nDrawing nearer him, she almost whispered,\\n\\n\\\"You have lived in Rome. Suppose these things repeated in ears we know of. Ah! you change color.\\\"\\n\\nHe drew back from her with somewhat of the look which may be imagined upon the face of a man who, thinking to play with a kitten, has run upon a tiger; and she proceeded:\\n\\n\\\"You are acquainted in the antechamber, and know the Lord Sejanus. Suppose it were told him with the proofs in hand--or without the proofs--that the same Jew is the richest man in the East--nay, in all the empire. The fishes of the Tiber would have fattening other than that they dig out of its ooze, would they not? And while they were feeding--ha! son of Hur!--what splendor there would be on exhibition in the Circus! Amusing the Roman people is a fine art; getting the money to keep them amused is another art even finer; and was there ever an artist the equal of the Lord Sejanus?\\\"\\n\\nBen-Hur was not too much stirred by the evident baseness of the woman for recollection. Not unfrequently when all the other faculties are numb and failing memory does its offices with the greatest fidelity. The scene at the spring on the way to the Jordan reproduced itself; and he remembered thinking then that Esther had betrayed him, and thinking so now, he said calmly as he could,\\n\\n\\\"To give you pleasure, daughter of Egypt, I acknowledge your cunning, and that I am at your mercy. It may also please you to hear me acknowledge I have no hope of your favor. I could kill you, but you are a woman. The Desert is open to receive me; and though Rome is a good hunter of men, there she would follow long and far before she caught me, for in its heart there are wildernesses of spears as well as wildernesses of sand, and it is not unlovely to the unconquered Parthian. In the toils as I am--dupe that I have been--yet there is one thing my due: who told you all you know about me? In flight or captivity, dying even, there will be consolation in leaving the traitor the curse of a man who has lived knowing nothing but wretchedness. Who told you all you know about me?\\\"\\n\\nIt might have been a touch of art, or might have been sincere--that as it may--the expression of the Egyptian's face became sympathetic.\\n\\n\\\"There are in my country, O son of Hur,\\\" she said, presently, \\\"workmen who make pictures by gathering vari-colored shells here and there on the sea-shore after storms, and cutting them up, and patching the pieces as inlaying on marble slabs. Can you not see the hint there is in the practice to such as go searching for secrets? Enough that from this person I gathered a handful of little circumstances, and from that other yet another handful, and that afterwhile I put them together, and was happy as a woman can be who has at disposal the fortune and life of a man whom\\\"--she stopped, and beat the floor with her foot, and looked away as if to hide a sudden emotion from him; with an air of even painful resolution she presently finished the sentence--\\\"whom she is at loss what to do with.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, it is not enough,\\\" Ben-Hur said, unmoved by the play--\\\"it is not enough. To-morrow you will determine what to do with me. I may die.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"True,\\\" she rejoined quickly and with emphasis, \\\"I had something from Sheik Ilderim as he lay with my father in a grove out in the Desert. The night was still, very still, and the walls of the tent, sooth to say, were poor ward against ears outside listening to--birds and beetles flying through the air.\\\"\\n\\nShe smiled at the conceit, but proceeded:\\n\\n\\\"Some other things--bits of shell for the picture--I had from--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Whom?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The son of Hur himself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Was there no other who contributed?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, not one.\\\"\\n\\nHur drew a breath of relief, and said, lightly, \\\"Thanks. It were not well to keep the Lord Sejanus waiting for you. The Desert is not so sensitive. Again, O Egypt, peace!\\\"\\n\\nTo this time he had been standing uncovered; now he took the handkerchief from his arm where it had been hanging, and adjusting it upon his head, turned to depart. But she arrested him; in her eagerness, she even reached a hand to him.\\n\\n\\\"Stay,\\\" she said.\\n\\nHe looked back at her, but without taking the hand, though it was very noticeable for its sparkling of jewels; and he knew by her manner that the reserved point of the scene which was so surprising to him was now to come.\\n\\n\\\"Stay, and do not distrust me, O son of Hur, if I declare I know why the noble Arrius took you for his heir. And, by Isis! by all the gods of Egypt! I swear I tremble to think of you, so brave and generous, under the hand of the remorseless minister. You have left a portion of your youth in the atria of the great capital; consider, as I do, what the Desert will be to you in contrast of life. Oh, I give you pity--pity! And if you but do what I say, I will save you. That, also, I swear, by our holy Isis!\\\"\\n\\nWords of entreaty and prayer these, poured forth volubly and with earnestness and the mighty sanction of beauty.\\n\\n\\\"Almost--almost I believe you,\\\" Ben-Hur said, yet hesitatingly, and in a voice low and indistinct; for a doubt remained with him grumbling against the yielding tendency of the man--a good sturdy doubt, such a one as has saved many a life and fortune.\\n\\n\\\"The perfect life for a woman is to live in love; the greatest happiness for a man is the conquest of himself; and that, O prince, is what I have to ask of you.\\\"\\n\\nShe spoke rapidly, and with animation; indeed, she had never appeared to him so fascinating.\\n\\n\\\"You had once a friend,\\\" she continued. \\\"It was in your boyhood. There was a quarrel, and you and he became enemies. He did you wrong. After many years you met him again in the Circus at Antioch.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Messala!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Messala. You are his creditor. Forgive the past; admit him to friendship again; restore the fortune he lost in the great wager; rescue him. The six talents are as nothing to you; not so much as a bud lost upon a tree already in full leaf; but to him-- Ah, he must go about with a broken body; wherever you meet him he must look up to you from the ground. O Ben-Hur, noble prince! to a Roman descended as he is beggary is the other most odious name for death. Save him from beggary!\\\"\\n\\nIf the rapidity with which she spoke was a cunning invention to keep him from thinking, either she never knew or else had forgotten that there are convictions which derive nothing from thought, but drop into place without leave or notice. It seemed to him, when at last she paused to have his answer, that he could see Messala himself peering at him over her shoulder; and in its expression the countenance of the Roman was not that of a mendicant or a friend; the sneer was as patrician as ever, and the fine edge of the hauteur as flawless and irritating.\\n\\n\\\"The appeal has been decided then, and for once a Messala takes nothing. I must go and write it in my book of great occurrences--a judgment by a Roman against a Roman! But did he--did Messala send you to me with this request, O Egypt?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He has a noble nature, and judged you by it.\\\"\\n\\nBen-Hur took the hand upon arm.\\n\\n\\\"As you know him in such friendly way, fair Egyptian, tell me, would he do for me, there being a reversal of the conditions, that he asks of me? Answer, by Isis! Answer, for the truth's sake!\\\"\\n\\nThere was insistence in the touch of his hand, and in his look also.\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\" she began, \\\"he is--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A Roman, you were about to say; meaning that I, a Jew, must not determine dues from me to him by any measure of dues from him to me; being a Jew, I must forgive him my winnings because he is a Roman. If you have more to tell me, daughter of Balthasar, speak quickly, quickly; for by the Lord God of Israel, when this heat of blood, hotter waxing, attains its highest, I may not be able longer to see that you are a woman, and beautiful! I may see but the spy of a master the more hateful because the master is a Roman. Say on, and quickly.\\\"\\n\\nShe threw his hand off and stepped back into the full light, with all the evil of her nature collected in her eyes and voice.\\n\\n\\\"Thou drinker of lees, feeder upon husks! To think I could love thee, having seen Messala! Such as thou were born to serve him. He would have been satisfied with release of the six talents; but I say to the six thou shalt add twenty--twenty, dost thou hear? The kissings of my little finger which thou hast taken from him, though with my consent, shall be paid for; and that I have followed thee with affection of sympathy, and endured thee so long, enter into the account not less because I was serving him. The merchant here is thy keeper of moneys. If by to-morrow at noon he has not thy order acted upon in favor of my Messala for six-and-twenty talents--mark the sum!--thou shalt settle with the Lord Sejanus. Be wise and--farewell.\\\"\\n\\nAs she was going to the door, he put himself in her way.\\n\\n\\\"The old Egypt lives in you,\\\" he said. \\\"Whether you see Messala to-morrow or the next day, here or in Rome, give him this message. Tell him I have back the money, even the six talents, he robbed me of by robbing my father's estate; tell him I survived the galleys to which he had me sent, and in my strength rejoice in his beggary and dishonor; tell him I think the affliction of body which he has from my hand is the curse of our Lord God of Israel upon him more fit than death for his crimes against the helpless; tell him my mother and sister whom he had sent to a cell in Antonia that they might die of leprosy, are alive and well, thanks to the power of the Nazarene whom you so despise; tell him that, to fill my measure of happiness, they are restored to me, and that I will go hence to their love, and find in it more than compensation for the impure passions which you leave me to take to him; tell him--this for your comfort, O cunning incarnate, as much as his--tell him that when the Lord Sejanus comes to despoil me he will find nothing; for the inheritance I had from the duumvir, including the villa by Misenum, has been sold, and the money from the sale is out of reach, afloat in the marts of the world as bills of exchange; and that this house and the goods and merchandise and the ships and caravans with which Simonides plies his commerce with such princely profits are covered by imperial safeguards--a wise head having found the price of the favor, and the Lord Sejanus preferring a reasonable gain in the way of gift to much gain fished from pools of blood and wrong; tell him if all this were not so, if the money and property were all mine, yet should he not have the least part of it, for when he finds our Jewish bills, and forces them to give up their values, there is yet another resort left me--a deed of gift to Caesar--so much, O Egypt, I found out in the atria of the great capital; tell him that along with my defiance I do not send him a curse in words, but, as a better expression of my undying hate, I send him one who will prove to him the sum of all curses; and when he looks at you repeating this my message, daughter of Balthasar, his Roman shrewdness will tell him all I mean. Go now--and I will go.\\\"\\n\\nHe conducted her to the door, and, with ceremonious politeness, held back the curtain while she passed out.\\n\\n\\\"Peace to you,\\\" he said, as she disappeared.\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nWhen Ben-Hur left the guest-chamber, there was not nearly so much life in his action as when he entered it; his steps were slower, and he went along with his head quite upon his breast. Having made discovery that a man with a broken back may yet have a sound brain, he was reflecting upon the discovery.\\n\\nForasmuch as it is easy after a calamity has befallen to look back and see the proofs of its coming strewn along the way, the thought that he had not even suspected the Egyptian as in Messala's interest, but had gone blindly on through whole years putting himself and his friends more and more at her mercy, was a sore wound to the young man's vanity. \\\"I remember,\\\" he said to himself, \\\"she had no word of indignation for the perfidious Roman at the Fountain of Castalia! I remember she extolled him at the boat-ride on the lake in the Orchard of Palms! And, ah!\\\"--he stopped, and beat his left hand violently with his right--\\\"ah! that mystery about the appointment she made with me at the Palace of Idernee is no mystery now!\\\"\\n\\nThe wound, it should be observed, was to his vanity; and fortunately it is not often that people die of such hurts, or even continue a long time sick. In Ben-Hur's case, moreover, there was a compensation; for presently he exclaimed aloud, \\\"Praised be the Lord God that the woman took not a more lasting hold on me! I see I did not love her.\\\"\\n\\nThen, as if he had already parted with not a little of the weight on his mind, he stepped forward more lightly; and, coming to the place on the terrace where one stairway led down to the court-yard below, and another ascended to the roof, he took the latter and began to climb. As he made the last step in the flight he stopped again.\\n\\n\\\"Can Balthasar have been her partner in the long mask she has been playing? No, no. Hypocrisy seldom goes with wrinkled age like that. Balthasar is a good man.\\\"\\n\\nWith this decided opinion he stepped upon the roof. There was a full moon overhead, yet the vault of the sky at the moment was lurid with light cast up from the fires burning in the streets and open places of the city, and the chanting and chorusing of the old psalmody of Israel filled it with plaintive harmonies to which he could not but listen. The countless voices bearing the burden seemed to say, \\\"Thus, O son of Judah, we prove our worshipfulness of the Lord God, and our loyalty to the land he gave us. Let a Gideon appear, or a David, or a Maccabaeus, and we are ready.\\\"\\n\\nThat seemed an introduction; for next he saw the man of Nazareth.\\n\\nIn certain moods the mind is disposed to mock itself with inapposite fancies.\\n\\nThe tearful woman-like face of the Christ stayed with him while he crossed the roof to the parapet above the street on the north side of the house, and there was in it no sign of war; but rather as the heavens of calm evenings look peace upon everything, so it looked, provoking the old question, What manner of man is he?\\n\\nBen-Hur permitted himself one glance over the parapet, then turned and walked mechanically towards the summer-house.\\n\\n\\\"Let them do their worst,\\\" he said, as he went slowly on. \\\"I will not forgive the Roman. I will not divide my fortune with him, nor will I fly from this city of my fathers. I will call on Galilee first, and here make the fight. By brave deeds I will bring the tribes to our side. He who raised up Moses will find us a leader, if I fail. If not the Nazarene, then some other of the many ready to die for freedom.\\\"\\n\\nThe interior of the summer-house, when Ben-Hur, slow sauntering, came to it, was murkily lighted. The faintest of shadows lay along the floor from the pillars on the north and west sides. Looking in, he saw the arm-chair usually occupied by Simonides drawn to a spot from which a view of the city over towards the Market-place could be best had.\\n\\n\\\"The good man is returned. I will speak with him, unless he be asleep.\\\"\\n\\nHe walked in, and with a quiet step approached the chair. Peering over the high back, he beheld Esther nestled in the seat asleep--a small figure snugged away under her father's lap-robe. The hair dishevelled fell over her face. Her breathing was low and irregular. Once it was broken by a long sigh, ending in a sob. Something--it might have been the sigh or the loneliness in which he found her--imparted to him the idea that the sleep was a rest from sorrow rather than fatigue. Nature kindly sends such relief to children, and he was used to thinking Esther scarcely more than a child. He put his arms upon the back of the chair, and thought.\\n\\n\\\"I will not wake her. I have nothing to tell her--nothing unless--unless it be my love. . . . She is a daughter of Judah, and beautiful, and so unlike the Egyptian; for there it is all vanity, here all truth; there ambition, here duty; there selfishness, here self-sacrifice. . . . Nay, the question is not do I love her, but does she love me? She was my friend from the beginning. The night on the terrace at Antioch, how child-like she begged me not to make Rome my enemy, and had me tell her of the villa by Misenum, and of the life there! That she should not see I saw her cunning drift I kissed her. Can she have forgotten the kiss! I have not. I love her. . . . They do not know in the city that I have back my people. I shrank from telling it to the Egyptian; but this little one will rejoice with me over their restoration, and welcome them with love and sweet services of hand and heart. She will be to my mother another daughter; in Tirzah she will find her other self. I would wake her and tell her these things, but--out on the sorceress of Egypt! Of that folly I could not command myself to speak. I will go away, and wait another and a better time. I will wait. Fair Esther, dutiful child, daughter of Judah!\\\"\\n\\nHe retired silently as he came.\",\"timestamp\":1640148286,\"title\":\"The knowledge we gain from much sympathy with others passing through trials is but vaguely understood; strangely enough, \"},\"digest\":\"m0aIS9iVE44MgGFygx1px4D0he6CzxzGi7H-izoP3dE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4FEa0511D28B2e43455B26d9Bb2E5c7B7044985a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uqPNuwGgJrcBxc739XbEc7eIoEGCad2gqHfjJXd3vwo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"x0WTb794fZ_Jj77IFO49NDt-baH-7l-MwZx-skhheMs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"jLCPrEXZO3wktOFIaUufXyzQemWzdbsq1hEaAeEC-6vRHMCWgHa2iAv9xSK9_fzxZioCPBRmlFWT1r4QClZbzw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5a8303d3113156bcc6d704caeeb1d81c97076dd5139fece40f472cf95abc5d4603e901add12b4957913f1b3e095de71094cc80b1962d00c9b1bfc9401061ba8e1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uqPNuwGgJrcBxc739XbEc7eIoEGCad2gqHfjJXd3vwo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"x0WTb794fZ_Jj77IFO49NDt-baH-7l-MwZx-skhheMs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"m0aIS9iVE44MgGFygx1px4D0he6CzxzGi7H-izoP3dE\"}"
