The core team and community collectively rallied to adapt to the sudden scaling and I’d like to thank all of you for your contributions and above all, patience. 🙏\\n\\nCityDAO is one of the most ambitious projects in crypto and there will undoubtedly be numerous ups and downs as we pioneer into completely uncharted territory.

Today, I'm researching crypto and what a physical city would have to do to ensure the success of a large-scale, fully-functional system. It's very interesting and obviously our economic future\\n\\nto be very honest, this is the best design research on future cities in crypto world, people talks a lot but not many people can design, people can create render but not all of them have systematic thinking and theory behind their design. This is really what we need in this community: high quality design research, really appreciate it\\n\\nlove the solarpunk future\\n\\nsince 2017, I've led strategy at Gnosis, building decentralized infrastructure for web3. i contribute to Other Internet research group and sit on the Board of Regen Foundation\\n\\ni have a strong revit and VDC/BIM background, and i know some other citizens have other modeling or construction backgrounds, if theres any way i can may be able to help out please dont hesitate to reach out\\n\\nI'll head to Prague for the Christmas market soon to visit some frens.\\n\\nI'm from Europe, have 10+ years of product design experience.

So my thought was maybe a simple provision that calls \\\"a balance sheet showing in reasonable detail the financial condition of this DAO, a profit and loss statement showing the results of the operations of this DAO during the previous month and the previous year, and any other financial statements such a lists of contracts entered into, staff hired, initiative payments executed, bounties collected, etc. This provision should be callable and subject to inspection by any citizen. Gifts received by the DAO have to be reported as part of the financial statements.'\\n\\nI have decided to be part of CityDAO because I believe it will be part of human history, the starting point of the future of global governance.\\n\\nUSA Hedge Fund CFO/COO 28 years, finance and sports, would love to help on the investing side of the CityDao and help with real estate and governance, Fun Fact on me is that I am a 50 something but far from a boomer, at least i think so?\\n\\nAreas of interest: Gardening, Neuralink, Singularity, video games, space travel, cuisine (of course (à pied))\\n\\nHello Im Zach, some fun facts about me are that I speak Russian and Arabic.
