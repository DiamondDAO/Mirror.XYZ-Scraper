"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Gary Nuttall, an emerging technology consultant with Distyltics, and a recent finalist in the prestigious U.K. CryptoAM Education Awards, is in demand to [explain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/garynuttall/) all things crypto. When I spoke with him, he had just hopped off a webinar with bankers. He wears a shirt (to impress the bankers) and a hoodie (to prove his tech credentials), but finds himself answering the same questions again and again.\\n\\n“The Silk Road and money laundering in crypto is still a top question,” he says, as he visibly sighs. “And I point out to them that the most money laundering is executed in the U.S. dollar. We have a way to go.”\\n\\nNuttall begins by addressing layer-one blockchains and the energy charges.\\n\\n> *“Talking about layer-one blockchains being energy expensive to mint NFTs misses the point entirely. For example, on the Bitcoin blockchain, a block is produced every ten minutes, while on Ethereum it’s more like every 15 seconds – these blocks are going to be produced regardless of whether or not there are NFTs onboard.”*\\n\\nNuttall compares it to a plane going from London to New York. “The plane is going anyway, where or not every seat is filled.”\",\"timestamp\":1639037591,\"title\":\"Gary Nuttall, an emerging technology consultant with Distyltics\"},\"digest\":\"Omh_C3aldrGGwfQnqB-0VY5MYhrPQd5L5x2f5HDz4Pg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3134f8de67402D62E9CEA1753CC90Fb93efB39a2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-0bfyaMUbVUz-_cmArnMKIucDgrEp7CiCWi_sYiYq6A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"yWMs7FafLU5nt7-DXs_fB9mLtoIT_SWagpffIxfBa6o\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"CpWGPt4sK5IU4kC3y4rAVU5IvDpnZutOz_4E_2XnENO7kKxrfZ8dVucFH6QJf3Q6vtP_iA_k0EqdKm8evKM3UA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd8779b20338fc6ca36210c020b0581030fb7ac0011102afda9075d0ab7bea4bf30bb484791ec5e26ef9880eced3f89f9f1694d473a822a80a75f005a8ff08bc81b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-0bfyaMUbVUz-_cmArnMKIucDgrEp7CiCWi_sYiYq6A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"yWMs7FafLU5nt7-DXs_fB9mLtoIT_SWagpffIxfBa6o\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Omh_C3aldrGGwfQnqB-0VY5MYhrPQd5L5x2f5HDz4Pg\"}"
