One owns a deliberate takeaway that resembles slow motion on video, while the other has a prolonged pause at the top of the backswing that has become a popular meme on social media.\\n\\nIt can sometimes feel like an eternity for them to unleash a shot but when they eventually pull the trigger, South Korea's Im Sung-jae and Hideki Matsuyama of Japan produce an impressive mix of power and precision as they pursue golfing greatness on the PGA Tour.\\n\\nMatsuyama, 29, and Im, 23, are Asia's leading duo, with their unique styles helping them to world rankings of 12th and 23rd respectively. They are also proud to be the only golfers from East Asia to have qualified for the FedExCup Playoffs finale, the Tour Championship, over the past three seasons.\\n\\nOver the past month, Im and Matsuyama produced stylish victories to remind the golf world of their immense talent.\\n\\nIm, nicknamed \\\"Ironman\\\", shot a final-round 62 to claim a second PGA Tour victory at the Shriners Children's Open in Vegas. Matsuyama prevailed at the Zozo Championship on home soil after closing with a 65 for his seventh career title. It was the icing on the cake after his historic Masters victory in April.\\n\\nThere seems little doubt the dynamic duo will accumulate many more PGA Tour wins in years to come and surpass KJ Choi's eight-title haul-the highest by an Asian to date. Now the question is who will become the first Asian to claim the Tour's ultimate prize, the FedExCup, and also ascend to No 1 in the world rankings?\\n\\nTrevor Immelman, the International Team captain for the 2022 Presidents Cup, possesses extensive insight on both players. The South African has enjoyed a front-row seat watching Im blossom into a world-class golfer through his role as assistant Presidents Cup captain at Royal Melbourne in 2019 and as a Golf Channel pundit.\\n\\nImmelman, the 2008 Masters champion, also witnessed first-hand as Matsuyama triumphed at Augusta National to become the first Asian to slip on the famous Green Jacket.\\n\\nWhen Im was marching to a four-shot victory in Vegas, Immelman marveled during the broadcast that the rising Korean star, who first picked up a golf club aged 4, possesses all the necessary tools to become the best player in the world.\\n\\n\\\"He absolutely has everything that it takes. This guy has all the goods to be the best in the world,\\\"Immelman enthused. \\\"One of the best drivers on tour, he's got plenty of distance, irons are laser-like and his short game is solid. This guy has got an incredible future ahead and I can't wait to see how it unfolds.\\\"\\n\\nOver the past year, Im has continued to solidify the foundation to his game, including hiring a fitness coach and settling into a new home in Atlanta, Georgia, with his parents after living out of a suitcase during his first few years in the United States. He also recently linked up with veteran caddie Billy Spencer.\\n\\nIm is keeping his feet firmly on the ground despite Immelman's glowing praise.\\n\\n\\\"It's a very overwhelming comment and I'm very thankful. I feel like I still have a long way to go to be the top player in the world, but I have a goal in mind and I always try to continue to get better every day, so one day hopefully I can become that great player,\\\" said Im, whose highest ranking is 16th.\\n\\n**Matsuyama rose to a career-high No 2 in 2017 before enduring a winless streak that ended with his magical Masters win.**\\n\\nHe contended once more at the WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational in August before delivering a famous home victory at the Zozo Championship, becoming the first Japanese to win the nation's lone PGA Tour event.\\n\\nIn his pre-tournament interview, he told media through a translator that his game was well off the mark.\\n\\n\\\"Ball striking, putting, chipping, all of these have not reached the level I want. If my game scored 10 out of 10 at the Masters, now I would say it scores less than one,\\\" Matsuyama said. \\\"I will be struggling this week but I am here in Japan, so I am motivated to be in contention.\\\"\\n\\nHe proceeded to conjure rounds of 64, 68, 68 and 65 for a five-shot triumph. When asked to reevaluate his form after his win, Matsuyama replied: \\\"I would rate my performance as two or three. From the results perspective, it went to about eight, but I think it was due to all the energy that I was getting from the fans.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Everyone else's idea of consistency is different to the consistency that I'm pursuing,\\\" he added.\\n\\n**Complacency, it seems, will not be a problem for Matsuyama and Im in their quests for greatness.**\\n\\n*The writer is a senior director of marketing and communications for the Asia-Pacific division of the PGA Tour and is based in Malaysia.*\",\"timestamp\":1636625483,\"title\":\"Asia's inimitable aces in race to scale summit\"},\"digest\":\"N6TXz-1eGzPYnTnmy4deyD214s9D8fBkkAxmNVM1EqU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x668B7b4b7475b4DF47725984b8641bb1e36c3F40\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PAyE04I27u8Erc0l9Lu9ni2SkmzdDUJHlTcuOPTJYAI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Xivfry_bbnHVrfVF50JfL6dZQ-47xgMU5yi5BmVaIno\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"XycjaP4_Md1BlypkpZymRXQI4o6LxHHMaKd1dAAYNKQ3--lcnlpQafL0xuXZNxG8SQEpn52cX1tEBxiRyFrlew\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa6b47a7ee45544e4c9eae548b850334c8fc031c8d947c2238fd2e8c6abb92131229f7dee2f20b15dc61a309df66c7e67d961e1e52c9cb2ccd57fa5e42a5b84d71c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PAyE04I27u8Erc0l9Lu9ni2SkmzdDUJHlTcuOPTJYAI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Xivfry_bbnHVrfVF50JfL6dZQ-47xgMU5yi5BmVaIno\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"N6TXz-1eGzPYnTnmy4deyD214s9D8fBkkAxmNVM1EqU\"}"
