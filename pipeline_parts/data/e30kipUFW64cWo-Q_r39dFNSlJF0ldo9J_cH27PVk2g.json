"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Normalize, limit and redistribute.\\n\\nTowards we are heading, I think the standardization of the world becomes an inescapable thing. This means that, mainly, to make the management of resources as balanced as possible, we will have to normalize, limit and redistribute, for example, clothing, consumer products, food, housing and cars, among others. Indeed, all consumer goods that have to do with people’s daily lives! This could be confused a bit with Socialism and that in part it is. But it does not have to do, necessarily, with a philosophy or with a basic political idea or as with a political dogma.\\n\\nRather, it is related to the idea of ​​starting to consider that there are industries in which an excess supply and many options are not as relevant (or less necessary) and that, indeed, the current regulation of the industry will have to be revisited. Fashion and the food industry — by the way, 30% of agricultural land is used to grow food that will never be consumed and 21% of fresh water is discarded for its production, according to the FAO.\\n\\nAll of the above leads me to think that a roadmap is necessary to establish, define and specify the world production of what is strictly necessary for a good life. And that, in the virtual world, everything else happens.\\n\\n## We are replicas, of ourselves, at different levels of abstraction.\\n\\nIn the virtual world (Metaverse), that is, from our Avatar, we can satisfy our needs and consumer freedoms.\\n\\nHowever, in the physical world, and in light of everything we have been experiencing and everything that is happening in the world, mainly global warming, the pandemic and a number of other issues, I think standardization becomes totally necessary.\\n\\nCurrently, “natural” monopolies are already being generated such as Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, among others. These companies will be, in my opinion, those responsible for providing us with technology, consumer goods and social interactions, to inhabit this new standard physical world and populate the diverse virtual dimension.\\n\\n## Integrate and incorporate the virtual dimension.\\n\\nStarting today — figuratively — we must begin to integrate and incorporate the virtual world as one more dimension of our experience as human beings.\\n\\nThe grace of the sixties — in my opinion — is that it became evident, for some, that to evolve it was necessary to integrate the spiritual. A lot of teachings were unveiled that allowed us to create an ecosystem, to unleash the current rebellion of the virtual.\\n\\nAs a phenomenon, I feel like it’s the sixties of virtuality.\\n\\nToday, the revolution manifests and coordinates in “virtual” way!; a moment in humanity where we awaken to a new dimension, and therefore, to a new species of human being.\",\"timestamp\":1635892414,\"title\":\"The standardization of the future\"},\"digest\":\"AGNmS5Hb11uLjP9g6PDeg8kXWbBwX3Es6Ot9RhhXLgg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x44dDAa90Ba33409b07D4D94e80343B3861Ef9FfC\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rh58KWkS18fwbaRoj2TVmHd6J_iWB66MAeaHvvedRQ8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"A2EjVCocZlsaBdZiYmradTuYtdOmzaGp0cSRKTgFOWE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"F0nAmeAwlYD8R3o7DogaIoNk4Q8bGxUpx_HlcxPm3vsSk8i6DH2YCrksqTLDo64mC01aDpZM1mZPKVrifUc8Rw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xfec0ee9dd2259625e16d184dbc2026c72ef05f849349fea22c8cb708f3830d2a778a147cb805991c54f21ad703694dc3534ab4c222d042115e8fc174841a84f51b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rh58KWkS18fwbaRoj2TVmHd6J_iWB66MAeaHvvedRQ8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"A2EjVCocZlsaBdZiYmradTuYtdOmzaGp0cSRKTgFOWE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wp-GMuc2Sl0scdPKUldP83bL2v26p0IBMsuzupzRk7M\"}"
