"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"When I was a kid, about primary-school-age, my father asked me to writer for the newspaper, he thought it would prove that I had the potential to be a writer.\\n\\nBut don’t think that’s a request, neither a birthday-cake-wish, nor something like that, that’s just an insignificant bell ringed a ding ding once in a while, and then, faded quickly away. No one’s gonna take it serious.\\n\\nMy father had never forced me doing anything in my life, he’s just that kind of person who keeps everything easygoing, and would not blame me for not having done something yet he asked me before.\\n\\nMaybe there lives a so-called traditional-paper-media-writer son deep in his mind, or not, I don’t know, in the mean while, he also knows that I have no favors on these paper media, so he had only mentioned it three or four times afterwards, and then he stopped asking.\\n\\nEvery generation is in a different era, he didn’t ask for me further. He is such an old-fashioned guy, and he knows it, he had a era of his own, and I have mine, he also knows it.\\n\\nThis is how the relationship between me and my father, as you can see, it’s not serious, it’s easygoing.\\n\\nSo, when I look back on my life, at this checkpoint, that they call it dozen(s), means you have reached your age of 12 or 24 or multiple of 12, I suddenly realize that I don’t have any articles printed on any newspapers, or magazines, or books, or mooks, or whatever medium forms you can name print words on the paper.\\n\\nYou may ask, does any of these “failures“ can make me a little regret or lose? The answer is ABSOLUTELY NO! I don’t regret for nothing printing on those papers, not at all. These will fade, in the long run. So I don’t believe in these papers shit, because in the long run we’re all gonna die, so do they, no one can escape it, at least I may live longer.\\n\\n![but some will live](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gP8F3COgZORgeV0jACHzm.jpg?height=567&width=474)\\n\\nI didn’t write anything for them, on the other hand, they didn’t benefit me neither. I don’t wanna start a fight on them, no one does, and have a look, look at how they died, without any declaration of war. They died like stranded fishes on the beach, even no one was ever trying to hunt them. I didn’t seek to win or gain anything, but one day, when I woke up, and I found that they’re gonna never wake up again.\\n\\nThat’s the fate of paper media, right? And I am glad I didn’t choose them.\\n\\nAnd who’s the next? Banks? Fiats? All of them.\\n\\nR.I.P. and take that!
