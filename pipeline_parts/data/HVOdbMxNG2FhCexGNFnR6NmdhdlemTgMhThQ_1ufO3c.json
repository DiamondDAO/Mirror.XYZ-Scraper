By buying back tokens in the open market, you have already spent the Dai or Ξ or other tokens earned from your project, and should not be part of fully distributed supply computation. \\n\\nWhether or not you should buy and burn is a question about flexibility. If you burn, those tokens are lost forever, which diminishes your flexibility to reissue them if and when the time comes for it.\\n\\nIf \\n\\n## TLDR\\n\\n![Exam cheatsheet](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/K1e_2wQcYx4li1pKXuuZE.png?height=1080&width=1920&size=large)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639476729,\"title\":\"A new new mental model for Defi Treasuries\"},\"digest\":\"CrI8RFC1txGgOjm-JBoB_oWC2fKhZ_WTprHZ_zyyx50\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x17307bE3589a680452543DDe06d42A07EE3FA080\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jIjKGalfc-FSi2PfHOqaMXt97G2H2CIehBgj2nQ9icM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"aExLcWsmur6zWZXDa_tn1fcXDzOWnlMPg4zJReAOP_c\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"HfxCq_uL8nYU2GNzR6WJtqS5CnwzvhdrMjWzk0BO-hRYSSxFPquwHEIPB5edZGH08amiQSn7m4DWy4rWDpPmGA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe8f53fadbb611ed983aec76f106b82dafbd2d012af5f4640f4939b905f05cb4b464569e143b88bb444cfca534cce78997e5494de87d3976af6bac7516de4572401\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jIjKGalfc-FSi2PfHOqaMXt97G2H2CIehBgj2nQ9icM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"aExLcWsmur6zWZXDa_tn1fcXDzOWnlMPg4zJReAOP_c\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ydgD5dT5Pu-lpVzbpu0CCg5rF-jUpdkLttShd4ORyJA\"}"
