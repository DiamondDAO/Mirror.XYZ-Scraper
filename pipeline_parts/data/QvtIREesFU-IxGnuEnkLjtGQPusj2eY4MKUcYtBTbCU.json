They have a team of stylists and assistants to do that for them. Of course, that law of nature doesn’t simply stop at the boundaries of the metaverse.\\n\\nSo, naturally, celebs need personal NFT shoppers.\\n\\nEnter: MoonPay.\\n\\nMoonPay is mostly known as a payment infrastructure company, a connector between the fiat world and the crypto world.\\n\\nFrom acting as an onramp for the average crypto investor, it wasn’t too far a leap for MoonPay to adopt a similar service for celebrities.\\n\\nRemember when Jimmy Fallon changed his Twitter profile picture to a BAYC?\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/jimmyfallon/status/1459164143626424321](https://twitter.com/jimmyfallon/status/1459164143626424321)\\n\\nIf you had pictured Fallon at home grumbling over gas fees and scrambling to find his seed phrase, you’ll be quite disappointed. Fallon bought the Ape through MoonPay’s ‘concierge service’ — meaning MoonPay brokers deals for blue-chip NFTs on behalf of the rich and famous, then initiates a transfer into the buyer’s wallet.\\n\\nIn this case, MoonPay [bought](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc25b524618ac595953be96f88ac286eb790258aba6f7a328484a8348a0b44fd7) Bored Ape #599 for 46.6 ETH ($224,191.20) at 12:28 AM on November 8. Then nine minutes later, the Ape was [transferred](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x25d594eab6dd5ea7c2189d2cf30b702f64ff3c75590d7c41638c9d9a55cf0f76) into an ‘anonymous’ [wallet](https://opensea.io/0x0394451c1238cec1e825229e692aa9e428c107d8) that is almost definitely Fallon’s.\\n\\nThough this all seems quite secretive, Fallon actually name-checked MoonPay during his interview with Beeple.\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/embed/AXC-_kWqZXo?start=83&end=113](https://www.youtube.com/embed/AXC-_kWqZXo?start=83&end=113)\\n\\nHere’s a screengrab of their landing page, which advertises to “high net worth individuals.”\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q1--XYVLJd0EhRgv-3Y_g.png?height=828&width=1572)\\n\\nNow that MoonPay’s services have come to light, every transaction coming from their wallet causes a stir.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/HolocronApe/status/1481049602367315968?s=20](https://twitter.com/HolocronApe/status/1481049602367315968?s=20)\\n\\nMoonPay hasn’t been limited to BAYC either. On January 6, 2022, they dropped 900 ETH ($3M) on CryptoPunk #2681. The sale was the 12th largest for any CryptoPunk in history, according to [DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/ethereum/collectibles/cryptopunks).\\n\\nThe Punk has yet to be transferred and remains in MoonPay’s OpenSea wallet, where it sits as the most expensive NFT.\\n\\nCurrently, MoonPay is holding two CryptoPunks, nine Bored Apes, 13 World of Women, as well as a few other items which add up to an estimated value of over $7M according to [Zapper](https://zapper.fi/account/0xd75233704795206de38cc58b77a1f660b5c60896/nft).\\n\\nAlso worth noticing is the $1M+ ETH MoonPay is currently holding in their wallet, which could mean they are gearing up for another major purchase.\",\"timestamp\":1642130056,\"title\":\"Taking Celebrities Shopping for NFTs\"},\"digest\":\"dG8td08BFacY-eVFoHNFKuFuNcvPgzIBb6UeHAkkcfI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3405991376854250Dd39Ca5A1D8644d97A0f6839\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"5KbuDaLX4cjBDwr644wckOVy-tc8iagDWq0EBx1HaPc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qXhtSufHskyv3cTlgEu48cHMp_w8ETeroa3ddga11u8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Hbp2WQDbeseCVRyX4j0s-K9IOIkvF2xOM5aSijGooOeAyP3uxR-XBYoxG-noH2o9i3lTYs5Y670tCWjF3CWeWA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1948aa82c06c6dab0ac222a07d66731dd7f8d5ec90fef13311b39d160747b8342fca4fb193649561ab7a85e331b6ec4f7e3b143a08182aef9edfb498786507211b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"5KbuDaLX4cjBDwr644wckOVy-tc8iagDWq0EBx1HaPc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qXhtSufHskyv3cTlgEu48cHMp_w8ETeroa3ddga11u8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"l7FkK1y19YGONyHAb3N4jO4DVaPbzPPnXGMFmvWbo7w\"}"
