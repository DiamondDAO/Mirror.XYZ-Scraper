Where ever you go, one of the first ways of identification is your attire. No matter whats your fashion style, it will always leave a mark behind right next to your personality. Even if someone doesn’t personally speak to you, your outfit along with you attitude is how they recognize and assume. \\n\\nIf a woman walked in the room with all back leather from head to toe, shades, and tall boots, usually the first assumption is “she’s a boss & does’t play.” If a man walked in the room with a suit, briefcase, and shinny shoes, you would assume he’s about his business right?\\n\\nSee, **IRL**, the first judgment made is by the way we look and how we carry ourself. Unfortunately what most **miss** is that the clothes we wear also **hold energy** that represents **how we feel** in them. The i**ntensions** set behind the clothes we wear are just as **important** as how **fashionable** they are. The only thing about this is that sometimes the garments we buy we really don’t know where they came from especially if they were manufactured and not hand-crafted or from an indie designer. \\n\\nManufacturing can be from **ethical** companies with good intensions or outsourced companies treating their employees **unfair** which lead to your **garments** holding **unwanted negativity**.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7n5KugiXOQGy4EF2KOf_S.jpg?height=566&width=850)\\n\\nFrom day one **Keeping Distance** stressed the importance of **cleansed**, **high vibrational garments** from the fabrics to the trims and would always use **natural methods** such as full moon sessions, present healing properties, and using our 3 core vibrational fundaments (Colors, Frequencies, & Sacred Geometry) in order to create our garments. This is why our Chakra Pants went viral. \\n\\nWe see **decentralization** in web3 as a bunch of **vibrations connecting** together in order to make smart contracts and DAOs of such. With coding being a form of vibrations, when bridging **fashion** and **alignment** in Keeping Distance Realm, we aim to continue the fleet and show you how these vibrations show out through our fashion garment NFTs and **wear to earn** will be more effective with the intentions set behind it. \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-OYiP7zd0Wk-KVnHFQQum.jpg?height=480&width=1062)\\n\\nAlignment also comes with **protection**. Tribes & cultures of all sorts have traditional dressing that represent a certain **status**. When they wear them they are **recognized** and **respected**. When you think about it, if you see any old footage of tribes, cultures, or even the military they usually have garments that have intentions and weapons of protection. \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gnCp1wCfvWm2YujlzIP3w.jpg?height=565&width=852)\\n\\nKeeping Distance Realm is going back to the **source** and starting at the **roots** to **broaden the horizon** of **alignment in fashion**. Our protection will be come in forms of crystals, stones, rocks, and chemical elements. Our fashion garments will represent a vortex experience of how we see ourselves in the metaverse and in the metaverse you choose your identity. \\n\\nJust remember, Alignment is the most expensive luxury.\\n\\n**CONNECT WITH KEEPING DISTANCE:**\\n\\n* [Distant Sanctuary Discord](https://discord.gg/zfnMVgJWtK)\\n* [Digitalax Marketplace & Profile](https://designers.digitalax.xyz/designers/Keeping%20Distance/)\\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/keepdistweb3)\\n* [Instagram](https://instagram.com/keepingdistanceweb3)\\n* [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/keepingdistance)\\n* [Youtube](https://youtube.com/channel/UCumHjK6CdXGBeqo-D8MSMdw)\\n* [Tiktok](https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdYgBRRF/)\",\"timestamp\":1638823682,\"title\":\"Bridging Fashion & Alignment\"},\"digest\":\"ciHhGZTCI0YZ-oazHoqhz0PxV37MnITBjbh7ZpUQF-Q\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x95635742BFB51Af8E7858989AF5072d7c1333713\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xne_QLRNLMBytXIcMFBJDoChcQxLBw2DXu_fGBdHibY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ucVkkAebb5VerfU4reTUQ3iZS2nooTD0lLsM1tUqE_Q\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"b-aqWblbImejEs2QNJxFbdv4O90l0S_Wtg6oa9SJi9LkcEEmH8An6dJ0nkzhBLec3ng1J-pab-rPBFBYfRznWA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0db2727202d2e1c5f882fb6356c2669d84bb0c78196524b87426a1fc55be96436ec62775de1411d9836fa3f13da8b7667f96f2ada7fc9de914a033180a0ef19a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xne_QLRNLMBytXIcMFBJDoChcQxLBw2DXu_fGBdHibY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ucVkkAebb5VerfU4reTUQ3iZS2nooTD0lLsM1tUqE_Q\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ciHhGZTCI0YZ-oazHoqhz0PxV37MnITBjbh7ZpUQF-Q\"}"
