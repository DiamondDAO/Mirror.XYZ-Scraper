At the end of the day, the $EGG share is distributed in proportion to the team.\\nThere's really a lot of grinding and constant upgrading of the product. As well as upgrading the gameplay and upgrading the token economy model.\\nTo illustrate, the first eagles and chicks you see look like this.\\nDesign team upgrades (before upgrades).\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5FN8yxftEUk9gk6THkxLg.png?height=800&width=800)\\n\\n\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KPwwavfQqRQQMOAghZlTH.png?height=1600&width=1600)\\n\\nIn terms of outward design, this piece is not particularly bad, but if you put out all the 10k pieces, you'll find that repetition and scarcity will be hard to come by.\\nSo you now see our eagles and chicks upgraded from the newly revamped version of.\\nDesign team upgrades (after the upgrade).\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BRy8NCkqFbXOl_U25qCk8.png?height=840&width=1729)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J4ryv4T4uN6L48PpJ3rI5.png?height=854&width=1750)\\n\\n\\nWebsite upgrade.\\nIf you had seen our previous website many people would have thought, how come this project is so low, but now you go and look at our newly revamped website, you will at least think that this is an okay project . <https://eaglegame.club/index>\\nUpgrades to the contract.\\nBefore the eagle game is very simple nft mining, but now the mining in the middle of a lot of NFT layout and confrontation, let this game become very different, can be said that the real game innovation, contract innovation.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J0OyxcdR8D8a0ogegZTeY.png?height=1664&width=4728)\\n\\n\\nUpgrading of mentality.\\nAny project needs constant polishing and perfection, we really have to dare to accept our own imperfection because there is really no perfect thing or perfect project in this world.\\nAt present, the DAO of a blockchain project is only limited to holding coins to vote on major decisions of the project. But the project teams are still really centralized and employed.\\nI hope that we at Eaglegame Dao don't need any hired staff, because only the real power of the community is really the strongest power.\\nThe early days of DAO are really hard, it takes a long time to get a consensus and to find a group of like-minded people who are also very reliable. You also need a group of people who can really get on the ground and move the project forward.\\n2021 may be over, but 2022 is just beginning, and so is Eaglegame Dao.\\nThank you to all the family members who have contributed to Eaglegame Dao.\\n\\n1.
