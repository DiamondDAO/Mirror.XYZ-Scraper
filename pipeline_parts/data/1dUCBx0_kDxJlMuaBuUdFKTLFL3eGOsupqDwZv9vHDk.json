"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"# I am new to web3 technology. \\n\\nI bought my first NFT in summer 2021, which is also when I purchased my first crypto. I had no idea what all of it meant, and I still don’t. What I am certain of, however, is that all of this is going to be a big part of what we experience in the world over the next couple of decades.\\n\\nI learned programming in experimental “gifted kid” courses in middle and high school. I was involved in BBSes in the 90s, and experienced all the earliest movement of the Internet. I was on Geocities, Livejournal, Typepad, Blogger and have self-hosted using a variety of CMS. Especially where technology intersects with knowledge work & communications, I am always down to try something new. So, here we are.\\n\\n# One of my goals with this sharing space is to “pull it all together” with regards to my many unique interests, pursuits & responsibilities. \\n\\nFor some aspects of my life, I already have outlets. For instance, in writing about East Asian herbalism, I could choose to write on my practitioner-oriented website [Deepest Health](https://deepesthealth.com) or my clinic website [Watershed Wellness](https://watershedwellnessastoria.com). For more socio-political and web3 (especially NFT) related sharing, I primarily use my [personal Twitter account.](https://twitter.com/ericbgrey/) I also have several more private writing spaces where I can reflect on minor interests & more sensitive matters.\\n\\nI don’t intend to stop using those tools for expression immediately. But, I’m finding more and more that I’d prefer to avoid the instability and lack of control inherent in commercial social networks and writing platforms. Something based on decentralized web3 technology may help solve some of those problems. \\n\\n# There’s something more subtle, and personal, here too. \\n\\nI have frequently suffered from too much fragmentation in many areas of my life. I can overcomplicate things, sometimes on purpose sometimes absent-mindedly, and often keep my different interests and “worlds” very siloed from one another. In some cases, that’s done for a good reason. But, in many cases it is a reflex born from the circumstances of my life up until now.\\n\\n# Blogging on the blockchain isn’t going to liberate me from long standing psycho-emotional patterns. \\n\\nBut, I will be attempting to use it as a way to pull all the strands towards one another. Not only might it contribute to a sense of overall integration in my life, but it will allow me to more easily see the powerful interconnections that likely exist between seemingly disparate concepts, areas & situations.\\n\\nWe shall see.\",\"timestamp\":1637264304,\"title\":\"Blogging on the blockchain\"},\"digest\":\"99lDe11rY8BN7ckuw6T4RhIUvy7QyD04Dva9EcN-mtk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4D41E3565e5772dDBfE07FbEc98013A688920806\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"z48TvbSP40cbRpVu5O7Kt9eN43ZMkSfyJORTP0Jtq9A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"jHHxBEPpPU3ZfPbnSX25ToG75ny940NcBpSXwnA3C6g\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"HvrLguQlq_nsO47XqEvBQLcW4mtY_2mP8No5f42Lb8n6mATtpMIBIt7xX8JJXPApXS62BW04BFy72n2fDgQILw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc55bd5a7b7f58be0350b2d9916e17513911c2f9c3c89a92e2c940e4e164a20c805ca45b37d5e3a6720843bb4dd45c769001443bfbd880e1e65215d572b5c7b251b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"z48TvbSP40cbRpVu5O7Kt9eN43ZMkSfyJORTP0Jtq9A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"jHHxBEPpPU3ZfPbnSX25ToG75ny940NcBpSXwnA3C6g\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"99lDe11rY8BN7ckuw6T4RhIUvy7QyD04Dva9EcN-mtk\"}"
