"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I tried to write “I’m sad” to bitcloud. But whenever I tried to verify my identity, they didn’t allow me to choose my country.  My country doesn't show on even the list.  So I found the mirror. I want to see my reflection.\\n\\nMy perfect 8-month-old relationship was ended. Because of ourselves life motto reasons. But, in the sad end, there are no logical reasons. I am very very sad. I tried to escape these thoughts. I played to the moon game for 68 minutes. Not enough. (the game also has a romantic-dramatic story, which got me emotional) Before that, I made some sketchy shits in the blender and spark ar. I’m planning to join the spark ar contest with a perfect idea. Let’s wait for the results…\\n\\nSoo,\\n\\nAs I mentioned before,  I am very sad. I loved him with my whole heart. I never want to break up like this. Or even I never imagine like that. It is just like, we are still loving each other. So why are we breaking up right now?!! The reason is, of course for the future. Both of us think about ourselves. Future happiness. The thought of “I have a miserable marriage life” terrifies us. So we have to get an action asap.\\n\\nAll my family members are saying “Idk why, but deep in my heart I never wanted that guy.” Whenever I heard this, I feel so bad. Man, I was thinking to marry this guy like a week ago?! Whatever. I love this man and for any reason, if he comes back to me I guess I always open my arms for him. At least for now.\\n\\nI loved you mes2, to the moon and back.\\n\\nI never wrote it down anywhere public. I thought “too early for that” or “when we engaged, I’m gonna write like this (smthn funny)” but it seems like that day never comes in.\\n\\nI believe better days are coming for us. But I wish, we meet them together, my hands are in your hand.. That would be cool.\\n\\nSayonara mes2. It was fun to hang up with you even for a time.\",\"timestamp\":1639169921,\"title\":\"Fresh Start\"},\"digest\":\"T_17_4fhwkNRfbx2x4UoFG1yJXJb0Roy0mMrn5tcXuY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x10527505e8f27d9BdbBec1f72774880E98CeA800\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"UeI_83oQ-bwwqMNT63vEGPhRcdRL0fBz52E_eGpr0Po\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ld6aI4VEgAr5q1JT6hEVlHZUZBvTJNhTR7quAz0nFhw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"v4bGVgr1lSTUHRPa_5NDojXivNLBnG4mMCSyyGgR18GKY_QziViBbWD1k3dLbKVnGYTYeh3dpMrz3sA9DJTWyg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x671c6272b070ce97650822085a88737b9d0a898dced802a56519040a3ad01e1e18d37b3879c37c46fdf9356a243a20c8c02cce0228282f417a5d2e1d07d50fea1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"UeI_83oQ-bwwqMNT63vEGPhRcdRL0fBz52E_eGpr0Po\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ld6aI4VEgAr5q1JT6hEVlHZUZBvTJNhTR7quAz0nFhw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"T_17_4fhwkNRfbx2x4UoFG1yJXJb0Roy0mMrn5tcXuY\"}"
