"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I have been thinking a lot about web3 and consuming tons of content (articles, podcasts) over the past 6 months and I feel like I haven’t even scratched the surface. NFT’s and their potential have especially been very fascinating to me and I have bought a few to understand how the process works. Most NFT projects will have a fixed supply and each NFT in the project has properties randomly assigned to it that differentiates it from others in the same project. For example, one of the projects I invested in on Opensea had properties like background color, eyes, head etc. The %’s represent how many of the 10,000 NFTs have this trait (only 2% of 10,000 NFT’s in this project have a vape in their mouth). Some of these properties are common and some are extremely rare. The rare traits make these NFT's more valuable than their counterparts in the same projects.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SfWzs3yT9NDKuqZ4yIpt6.png?height=256&width=508)\\n\\nThen I started to think how, we as humans, also have properties associated with us. Some of these are very common **(100% of us are humans)**. But there are also tons of rare properties that we have or have the ability to learn and add to our belt. What if we focused on strengthening the properties that are unique and rare and have the highest probability of generating valuable returns for ourselves over a long enough time horizon. I bet some of these valuable properties could just be simple things like: ***not giving up, being persistent, working smarter, minimizing distractions during creative work hours etc***. And by focusing on things that others are not willing to do, you can naturally make yourself ***more rare = more valuable*** in the long run.\\n\\nThe best part is that these unique and rare properties don't need to be the same across all industries. Of course, there will be overlap for some properties such as working hard, being persistent etc, but each vertical will bring along its own set of unique properties that will be more valuable in that niche than anywhere else.\\n\\n[Balaji](https://twitter.com/balajis?s=20) shared his opinion of how the value of traditional education will keep decreasing because people will be evaluated based off the projects they have worked on and the tasks they have completed. And this data will sit on the blockchain for anyone to evaluate when they are hiring. If very few people have done the same task or have expertise in a particular skill, the more they can charge for it.\\n\\nWhat are some rare properties and skills that you can start working on today that will produce outsized returns over the long run? The future of web3 is bright and we are only getting started.\\n\\nWAGMI!!\",\"timestamp\":1634418615,\"title\":\"What is your rarity score? \"},\"digest\":\"dzfd2KesxmiN2PVC8jo5b7uYCULCM_eKCEc4QRsUHFk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xbacDA1e925bCaa679539A5D650111e4a50a651D4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZmeSqAOpuAFSBEUeXtwwaKEnDPrsI6SnKqiMWMXX1wc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"hxDrF39nKMoXda53Q_ccX40We_5hmLvjZQZNKvv8x8c\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"MLGtN6ZWWxK9lxE-Tzr2mJKCDMTW6DTMbh5bNF_gMwWnEB4cC9KjscduIC4p86_hebx-rzdPBm9tb4XQyUNTTw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x27d18a4295c539bf5c51aaaa2720163d72945fc38452a7ac562e17067d074abc688ccbda0f538523013e0af7516629cd58fda66585b0e3e28b85fc675efbf33f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZmeSqAOpuAFSBEUeXtwwaKEnDPrsI6SnKqiMWMXX1wc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"hxDrF39nKMoXda53Q_ccX40We_5hmLvjZQZNKvv8x8c\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"yvc7s7osfpWhBvq4R5t8FTz1LQdhKbb3RN69fF2xUgg\"}"
