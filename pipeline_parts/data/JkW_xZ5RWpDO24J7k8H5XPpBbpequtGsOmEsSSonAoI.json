"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I’m going to build on this topic soon\\n\\nDisclaimer! If you do not know anything about how Decentralised Exchanges (DEX) or liquidity providing work, I suggest you read an article or watch a video about that first, then come back to this article \\n\\n#### Impermanent loss (IL) has always been the no.1 concern on every investors’ mind before providing LP.\\n\\n  \\n This results in inaction, and procrastination. That in itself is a permanent loss of additional yield not accrued from protocol and trading fees when providing liquidity \\n\\nOne of the best ways to overcome impermanent loss is to look beyond it. \\n\\nAlthough liquidity providers can experience impermanent loss, the yield on their tokens must also be taken into account. If your yield generates higher returns than the amount you lose from impermanent loss then you can receive more profit than simply holding the tokens. By receiving yield on your tokens in a liquidity pool, you are also turning them into a productive asset.\\n\\nWhy HODL Ethereum(ETH) when you can stake and yield an additional 32% APY from it. Sounds crazy? Alpha at the end \\n\\n#### A Paradigm shift from an Order-book model (CLOB) to Automated Market Maker (AMM) model\\n\\nTo study and tackle the topic of impermanent loss, we have to first study why it even exists in the first place. Unlike an order book that specifies prices at which buyers and sellers wish to trade, an AMM exchange aggregates liquidity for both sides of a trading pair into a pool. Instead of trading between buyers and sellers, users trade against a pool of tokens — a liquidity pool\\n\\nThe primary advantage of AMM is that there will always be liquidity for otherwise illiquid markets, and AMMs enables traders to always get a price quote on their asset, regardless of the number of active orders submitted to the exchange. However, it brought a set of new problems, such as high slippage and risks for liquidity providers. \",\"timestamp\":1634150995,\"title\":\"Liquidity Buy-out VS Renting liquidity\"},\"digest\":\"rjd_djvQOV_eOit1QEk53w1Q3IGSFyTIZtONVOM8-xE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xbf0C6494ED2cc483cfc86255F45F9A947B5e5621\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rOg_ZLMrv-8ugd9xdUsB4KrWuBGayiaLMLip0yuHvXg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"iu0HvQHd0sEKEvVPudY_3SyGgzqo_aYydRvbGnONieg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"TMN1MWj4MJU0XQ7QtPt9NiiCe_4rSJaJZwpE3p1e9jqmqgThdZdZcdbT_mo03EqzA0TX9uEB1DmyEZ_F2yqsSw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x95e3a2fefaba53a206afd33a8057b9b2bc1b0063d2bcd566ef5cab9c54e3a67b100d7ab68455495258f50c9bd5dae94d1718688fc53230bd36659fa7843d135f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rOg_ZLMrv-8ugd9xdUsB4KrWuBGayiaLMLip0yuHvXg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"iu0HvQHd0sEKEvVPudY_3SyGgzqo_aYydRvbGnONieg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"WF2o0qg4qTD_IQ3TOev2XxjDFW_fs3wqoqX8sI9FKZo\"}"
