This was in response to a wider call put out by the city to further support innovative fashion projects. It‚Äôs an amazing achievement, excellent news for Mutani and the future of metaverse fashion as a whole!\\n\\n[https://m.gva.be/cnt/dmf20211027_96953742](https://m.gva.be/cnt/dmf20211027_96953742)\\n\\n### FUTR E\\\\*SHCK Launches.\\n\\n[KALAU](https://designers.digitalax.xyz/designers/KALAU/) also released some BIG news with the FUTR E\\\\*SHCK collaborative creation coming out of Alterrage.

That means everything from smartphones to end-of-life refrigerators. Basically, anything that runs on electricity that you‚Äôve decided to get rid of. Globally, we only recycle 10% of our e-waste, a number that‚Äôs as shocking as it is depressing. As for the 90% we don‚Äôt recycle, it ends up getting landfilled, incinerated, or illegally traded.\\n\\nInspired to bring attention to this cause, Alterrage partnered with three motion graphic artists, NGHTWLK (Matthew Davies), YELLOSESAME (Jeffrey Huang), and MSISTEMA (Marc Ferrer) to build a world filled with larger than life, electronic-inspired scenes and fashion; paired with an informative call to action.\\n\\n[https://vimeo.com/640916978](https://vimeo.com/640916978)\\n\\n### GDN ‚úàÔ∏è NFT NYC.\\n\\nSome of the GDN members met IRL at NFT NYC‚Äî forget men in black, these ladies will define the new style without the need for memory wiping devices ‚Äîwith [Di.Universe](https://designers.digitalax.xyz/designers/Di.universe), [Karina from Infinito](https://designers.digitalax.xyz/designers/Infinito/), and [Catherinetheworst](https://designers.digitalax.xyz/designers/Catherinetheworst/).\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Rc04g_l-WBkrBushrJLtg.png?height=4032&width=3024)\\n\\n### Artem Leaves Nothing On the Table.\\n\\n[Artem](https://designers.digitalax.xyz/designers/Artem%20Krivosheya/) showed us how web3 fashion is really done‚Äî get red pilled & go all in or nothing.
