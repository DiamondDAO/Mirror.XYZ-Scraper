"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Welcome to Unit Zero — an anonymous collective of veterans in the crypto arena, providing free and open source research on topics ranging from investment trends, technical architecture, tokenomics, market insights, and general opinions.\\n\\nThis shop was borne from a need. We come from backgrounds in finance and tech, but became deeply engaged with the burgeoning crypto economy beginning in 2017. After leaving our TradFi posts, we took the jump to work in the space full time and have thrived in the chaos that is crypto. Some of us are builders, investors, researchers... but all of us are degenerates. We share a passion for crypto, Web3, and the fascinating world of financial innovation that crypto has enabled. We’ve become experts on these topics.\\n\\nFriends, family, and acquaintances are regularly asking us for insights and investment advice, which we generally try to steer away from considering we are not registered investment advisors (RIAs). We needed a forum upon which we could provide our unfiltered thoughts to point people toward in lieu of spending our time educating individuals one-on-one.\\n\\nEnter Unit Zero, our unfiltered canvas for expressing opinions and insights onto the topics we are covering regularly. Our hope is to become a hub for newer entrants to get up to speed with all that is occurring in this space, as well as provide the industry with access to high quality research on the deeply technical nature of blockchains and the complex mechanics behind decentralized finance. Unit Zero research covers all things DeFi, NFT marketplace dynamics, blockchain gaming ecosystems and economies, plus various other exciting trends in the space.\\n\\nIn essence, we feel that our opinions are valued highly enough for us to put our thoughts into a more structured forum. We don’t pretend to know everything about the future, as most things in crypto are still driven in a highly speculative manner. But we are actively participating in every corner of the ecosystem daily, and as a result, many look to us for opinions. Being an outlet for new players is very important to us; proper education is table stakes for mainstream adoption of blockchain-denominated systems.\\n\\nPlease enjoy and feel free to provide feedback. If you’d like to contribute, reach out to Katsuragi or Ayanami on twitter.\",\"timestamp\":1642705968,\"title\":\"Genesis\"},\"digest\":\"FHlYfnnzGjUgqTWI1IUfCvZZpQ22NWMs9pcGkFhKIzg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xB2D592c8E7542f9507c2c3A0224Eb67cD2B0ee19\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4gnE_9ntFI0ZJIfWXedX8sd81ViEcP4e_-pqwYdDk8A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"GSA5aR9WbRxJ5gxBww-vbqh1WUrPoZSXYGALlsXw6xs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"J384HFw0BVsIZtX6L_wpUKjDP1akWkX-3Li2P82o4tu-F-C_HrIHpCPYNQglEd_gCUeL_E_lng96BUSyzl2zQA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf435ae4d80dccc1e6e9a3ca97f8e94bd1225078a551a5ee20deec4307e61f2fd1b9ae9ab79cf74cbcb58607962607591bf9aadabebac5de9843e12365388558b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4gnE_9ntFI0ZJIfWXedX8sd81ViEcP4e_-pqwYdDk8A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"GSA5aR9WbRxJ5gxBww-vbqh1WUrPoZSXYGALlsXw6xs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"zonEiIL3M1l1e-MLmQNP6lcuF6gv9XL8OvhQQk6nm1I\"}"
