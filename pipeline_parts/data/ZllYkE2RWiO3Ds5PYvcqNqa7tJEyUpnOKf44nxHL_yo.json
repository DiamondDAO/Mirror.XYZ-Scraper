"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"To see it we must trace the a-coo-o, coo-o, coo-oo, coo-o to its source in the thick foliage in some tree in an out-of-the-way corner of the farm, or to an evergreen near the edge of the woods. The slow, plaintive notes, more like a dirge than a love-song, penetrate to a surprising distance. They may not always be the same lovers we hear from April to the end of summer, but surely the sound seems to indicate that they are. The dove is a shy bird, attached to its gentle and refined mate with a devotion that has passed into a proverb, but caring little or nothing for the society of other feathered friends, and very little for its own kind, unless after the nesting season has passed. In this respect it differs widely from its cousins, the wild pigeons, flocks of which, numbering many millions, are recorded by Wilson and other early writers before the days when netting these birds became so fatally profitable.\\n\\nWhat the dove finds to adore so ardently in the \\\"shiftless housewife,\\\" as Mrs. Wright calls his lady-love, must pass the comprehension of the phoebe, that constructs such an exquisite home, or of a bustling, energetic Jenny wren, that \\\"looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness.\\\" She is a flabby, spineless bundle of flesh and pretty feathers, gentle and refined in manners, but slack and incompetent in all she does. Her nest consists of few loose sticks. without rim or lining; and when her two babies emerge from the white eggs, that somehow do not fall through or roll out of the rickety lattice, their tender little naked bodies must suffer from many bruises. We are almost inclined to blame the inconsiderate mother for allowing her offspring to enter the world unclothed -- obviously not her fault, though she is capable of just such negligence. Fortunate are the baby doves when their lazy mother scatters her makeshift nest on top of one that a robin has deserted, as she frequently does. It is almost excusable to take her young birds and rear them in captivity, where they invariably thrive, mate, and live happily, unless death comes to one, when the other often refuses food and grieves its life away.\\n\\nIn the wild state, when the nesting season approaches, both birds make curious acrobatic flights above the tree-tops; then, after a short sail in midair, they return to their perch. This appears to be their only giddiness and frivolity, unless a dust-bath in the country road might be considered a dissipation.\\n\\nIn the autumn a few pairs of doves show slight gregarious tendencies, feeding amiably together in the grain fields and retiring to the same roost at sundown.\\n\\nBLUE-GRAY GNATCATCHER (Polioptila coerulea) Gnatcatcher family\\n\\nCalled also: SYLVAN FLYCATCHER\\n\\nLength -- 4.5 inches. About two inches smaller than the English   sparrow. Male -- Grayish blue above, dull grayish white below. Grayish   tips on wings. Tail with white outer quills changing gradually   through black and white to all black on centre quills. Narrow   black band over the forehead and eyes. Resembles in manner and   form a miniature catbird. Female -- More grayish and less blue, and without the black on   head. Range -- United States to Canadian border on the north, the   Rockies on the west, and the Atlantic States, from Maine to   Florida most common in the Middle States. A rare bird north of   New Jersey. Winters in Mexico and beyond. Migrations -- May. September. Summer resident.\\n\\nIn thick woodlands, where a stream that lazily creeps through the mossy, oozy ground attracts myriads of insects to its humid neighborhood, this tiny hunter loves to hide in the denser foliage of the upper branches. He has the habit of nervously flitting about from twig to twig of his relatives, the kinglets, but unhappily he lacks their social, friendly instincts, and therefore is rarely seen. Formerly classed among the warblers, then among the flycatchers, while still as much a lover of flies, gnats, and mosquitoes as ever, his vocal powers have now won for him recognition among the singing birds. Some one has likened his voice to the squeak of a mouse, and Nuttall says it is \\\"scarcely louder,\\\" which is all too true, for at a little distance it is quite inaudible. But in addition to the mouse-like call-note, the tiny bird has a rather feeble but exquisitely finished song, so faint it seems almost as it the bird were singing in its sleep.\\n\\nIf by accident you enter the neighborhood of its nest, you soon find out that this timid, soft-voiced little creature can be roused to rashness and make its presence disagreeable to ears and eyes alike as it angrily darts about your unoffending head, pecking at your face and uttering its shrill squeak close to your very ear-drums. All this excitement is in defence of a dainty, lichen-covered nest, whose presence you may not have even suspected before, and of four or five bluish-white, speckled eggs well beyond reach in the tree-tops.\\n\\nDuring the migrations the bird seems not unwilling to show its delicate, trim little body, that has often been likened to a diminutive mocking-bird's, very near the homes of men. Its graceful postures, its song and constant motion, are sure to attract attention. In Central Park, New York City, the bird is not unknown.\\n\\nBROWN, OLIVE OR GRAYISH BROWN, AND BROWN AND GRAY SPARROWY BIRDS\\n\\nHouse Wren                    Yellow-billed Cuckoo Carolina Wren                 Bank Swallow and Winter Wren                   Rough-winged Swallow Long-billed Marsh Wren        Cedar Bird Short-billed Marsh Wren       Brown Creeper Brown Thrasher                Pine Siskin Wilson's Thrush or Veery      Smith's Painted Longspur  Wood Thrush                   Lapland Longspur Hermit Thrush                 Chipping Sparrow Alice's Thrush                English Sparrow Olive-backed Thrush           Field Sparrow Louisiana Water Thrush        Fox Sparrow Northern Water Thrush         Grasshopper Sparrow Flicker                       Savannah Sparrow Meadowlark and Western        Seaside Sparrow   Meadowlark                  Sharp-tailed Sparrow Horned Lark and Prairie       Song Sparrow   Horned Lark                 Swamp Song Sparrow Pipit or Titlark              Tree Sparrow Whippoorwill                  Vesper Sparrow Nighthawk                     White-crowned Sparrow Black-billed Cuckoo           White-throated Sparrow\\n\\nSee also winter plumage of the Bobolink, Goldfinch, and Myrtle Warbler.

Actually about one-fourth smaller than   the English sparrow; apparently only half as large because of   its erect tail. Male and Female -- Upper parts cinnamon-brown. Deepest shade on   head and neck; lightest above tail, which is more rufous. Back   has obscure, dusky bars; wings and tail are finely barred.   Underneath whitish, with grayish-brown wash and faint bands   Most prominent on sides. Range -- North America, from Manitoba to the Gulf. Most common in   the United States, from the Mississippi eastward. Winters south   of the Carolinas. Migrations -- April October. Common summer resident.\\n\\nEarly some morning in April there will go off under your window that most delightful of all alarm-clocks -- the tiny, friendly house wren, just returned from a long visit south. Like some little mountain spring that, having been imprisoned by winter ice, now bubbles up in the spring sunshine, and goes rippling along over the pebbles, tumbling over itself in merry cascades, so this little wren's song bubbles, ripples, cascades in a miniature torrent of ecstasy.\\n\\nYear after year these birds return to the same nesting places: a box set up against the house, a crevice in the barn, a niche under the eaves; but once home, always home to them. The nest is kept scrupulously clean; the house-cleaning, like the house-building and renovating, being accompanied by the cheeriest of songs, that makes the bird fairly tremble by its intensity. But however angelic the voice of the house wren, its temper can put to flight even the English sparrow. Need description go further.\\n\\nSix to eight minutely speckled, flesh-colored eggs suffice to keep the nervous, irritable parents in a state bordering on frenzy whenever another bird comes near their habitation. With tail erect and head alert, the father mounts on guard, singing a perfect ecstasy of love to his silent little mate, that sits upon the nest if no danger threatens; but both rush with passionate malice upon the first intruder, for it must be admitted that Jenny wren is a sad shrew.\\n\\nWhile the little family is being reared, or, indeed, at any time, no one is wise enough to estimate the millions of tiny insects from the garden that find their way into the tireless bills of these wrens.\\n\\nIt is often said that the house wren remains at the north all the year, which, though not a fact, is easily accounted for by the coming of the winter wrens just as the others migrate in the autumn, and by their return to Canada when Jenny wren makes up her feather-bed under the eaves in the spring.\\n\\nCAROLINA WREN (Thryothorus ludovicianus) Wren family\\n\\nCalled also: MOCKING WREN\\n\\nLength -- 6 inches. Just a trifle smaller than the English   sparrow Male and Female -- Chestnut-brown above. A whitish streak,   beginning at base of bill, passes through the eye to the nape   of the neck. Throat whitish. Under parts light buff-brown Wings   and tail finely barred with dark. Range -- United States, from Gulf to northern Illinois and   Southern New England. Migrations -- A common resident except at northern boundary of   range, where it is a summer visitor.\\n\\nThis largest of the wrens appears to be the embodiment of the entire family characteristics: it is exceedingly active, nervous, and easily excited, quick-tempered, full of curiosity, peeping into every hole and corner it passes, short of flight as it is of wing, inseparable from its mate till parted by death, and a gushing lyrical songster that only death itself can silence. It also has the wren-like preference for a nest that is roofed over, but not too near the homes of men.\\n\\nUndergrowths near water, brush heaps, rocky bits of woodland, are favorite resorts. The Carolina wren decidedly objects to being stared at, and likes to dart out of sight in the midst of the underbrush in a twinkling while the opera-glasses are being focussed.  To let off some of his superfluous vivacity, Nature has provided him with two safety-valves: one is his voice, another is his tail. With the latter he gesticulates in a manner so expressive that it seems to be a certain index to what is passing in his busy little brain -- drooping it, after the habit of the catbird, when he becomes limp with the emotion of his love-song, or holding it erect as, alert and inquisitive, he peers at the impudent intruder in the thicket below his perch.\\n\\nBut it is his joyous, melodious, bubbling song that is his chief fascination. He has so great a variety of strains that many people have thought that he learned them from other birds, and so have called him what many ornithologists declare that he is not --  a mocking wren. And he is one of the few birds that sing at night -- not in his sleep or only by moonlight, but even in the total darkness, just before dawn, he gives us the same wide-awake song that entrances us by day.\\n\\nWINTER WREN (Troglodytes biemalis) Wren family\\n\\nLength -- 4 to 4.5 inches. About one-third smaller than the   English sparrow. Apparently only half the size. Male and Female -- Cinnamon-brown above, with numerous short,   dusky bars. Head and neck without markings. Underneath rusty,   dimly and finely barred with dark brown. Tail short. Range -- United States, east and west, and from North Carolina to   the Fur Countries Migrations -- October, April. Summer resident. Commonly a winter   resident in the South and Middle States only.\\n\\nIt all too rarely happens that we see this tiny mouse-like wren in summer, unless we come upon him suddenly and overtake him unawares as he creeps shyly over the mossy logs or runs literally \\\"like a flash\\\" under the fern and through the tangled underbrush of the deep, cool woods. His presence there is far more likely to be detected by the ear than the eye.\\n\\nThroughout the nesting season music fairly pours from his tiny throat; it bubbles up like champagne; it gushes forth in a lyrical torrent and overflows into every nook of the forest, that seems entirely pervaded by his song. While music is everywhere, it apparently comes from no particular point, and, search as you may, the tiny singer still eludes, exasperates, and yet entrances.\\n\\nIf by accident you discover him balancing on a swaying twig, never far from the ground, with his comical little tail erect, or more likely pointing towards his head, what a pert, saucy minstrel he is! You are lost in amazement that so much music could come from a throat so tiny.\\n\\nComparatively few of his admirers, however, hear the exquisite notes of this little brown wood-sprite, for after the nesting season is over he finds little to call them forth during the bleak, snowy winter months, when in the Middle and Southern States he may properly be called a neighbor. Sharp hunger, rather than natural boldness, drives him near the homes of men, where he appears just as the house wren departs for the South. With a forced confidence in man that is almost pathetic in a bird that loves the forest as he does, he picks up whatever lies about the house or barn in the shape of food-crumbs from the kitchen door, a morsel from the dog's plate, a little seed in the barn-yard, happily rewarded if he can find a spider lurking in some sheltered place to give a flavor to the unrelished grain. Now he becomes almost tame, but we feel it is only because he must be.\\n\\nThe spot that decided preference leads him to, either winter or summer, is beside a bubbling spring. In the moss that grows near it the nest is placed in early summer, nearly always roofed over and entered from the side, in true wren-fashion; and as the young fledglings emerge from the creamy-white eggs, almost the first lesson they receive from their devoted little parents is in the fine art of bathing. Even in winter weather, when the wren has to stand on a rim of ice, he will duck and splash his diminutive body. It is recorded of a certain little individual that he was wont to dive through the icy water on a December day. Evidently the wrens, as a family, are not far removed in the evolutionary scale from true water-birds.\\n\\nLONG-BILLED MARSH WREN (Cistothorus palustris) Wren family\\n\\n\\\\[Called also: MARSH WREN, AOU 1998\\\\]\\n\\nLength -- 4.5 to 5.2 inches. Actually a little smaller than the   English sparrow. Apparently half the size. Male and Female -- Brown above, with white line over the eye, and   the back irregularly and faintly streaked with white. Wings and   tail barred with darker cinnamon-brown. Underneath white. Sides   dusky. Tail long and often carried erect. Bill extra long and   slender. Range -- United States and southern British America. Migrations -- May. September. Summer resident.\\n\\nSometimes when you are gathering cat-tails in the river marshes an alert, nervous little brown bird rises startled from the rushes and tries to elude you as with short, jerky flight it goes deeper and deeper into the marsh, where even the rubber boot may not follow. It closely resembles two other birds found in such a place, the swamp sparrow and the short-billed marsh wren; but you may know by its long, slender bill that it is not the latter, and by the absence of a bright bay crown that it is not the shyest of the sparrows.\\n\\nThese marsh wrens appear to be especially partial to running water; their homes are not very far from brooks and rivers, preferably those that are affected in their rise and flow by the tides. They build in colonies, and might be called inveterate singers, for no single bird is often permitted to finish his bubbling song without half the colony joining in a chorus.\\n\\nStill another characteristic of this particularly interesting bird is its unique architectural effects produced with coarse grasses woven into globular form and suspended in the reeds. Sometimes adapting its nest to the building material at hand, it weaves it of grasses and twigs, and suspends it from the limb of a bush or tree overhanging the water, where it swings like an oriole's. The entrance to the nest is invariably on the side.\\n\\nMore devoted homebodies than these little wrens are not among the feathered tribe. Once let the hand of man desecrate their nest, even before the tiny speckled eggs are deposited in it, and off go the birds to a more inaccessible place, where they can enjoy their home unmolested. Thus three or four nests may be made in a summer.\\n\\nSHORT-BILLED MARSH WREN (Cistothorus stellaris) Wren family\\n\\n\\\\[Called also: SEDGE WREN, AOU 1998\\\\]\\n\\nLength -- 4 to 5 inches. Actually about one-third smaller than   the English sparrow, but apparently only half its size. Male and Female -- Brown above, faintly streaked with white,   black, and buff. Wings and tail barred with same. Underneath   white, with buff and rusty tinges on throat and breast. Short   bill. Range -- North America, from Manitoba southward in winter to Gulf   of Mexico. Most common in north temperate latitudes. Migrations -- Early May. Late September.\\n\\nWhere red-winged blackbirds like to congregate in oozy pastures or near boggy woods, the little short-billed wren may more often be heard than seen, for he is more shy, if possible, than his long-billed cousin, and will dive down into the sedges at your approach, very much as a duck disappears under water. But if you see him at all, it is usually while swaying to and fro as he clings to some tall stalk of grass, keeping his balance by the nervous, jerky tail motions characteristic of all the wrens, and singing with all his might. Oftentimes his tail reaches backward almost to his head in a most exaggerated wren-fashion.\\n\\nSamuels explains the peculiar habit both the long-billed and the short-billed marsh wrens have of building several nests in one season, by the theory that they are made to protect the sitting female, for it is noticed that the male bird always lures a visitor to an empty nest, and if this does not satisfy his curiosity, to another one, to prove conclusively that he has no family in prospect.\\n\\nWild rice is an ideal nesting place for a colony of these little marsh wrens. The home is made of sedge grasses, softly lined with the softer meadow grass or plant-down, and placed in a tussock of tall grass, or even upon the ground. The entrance is on the side. But while fond of moist places, both for a home and feeding ground, it will be noticed that these wrens have no special fondness for running water, so dear to their long-billed relatives. Another distinction is that the eggs of this species, instead of being so densely speckled as to look brown, are pure white.\\n\\nBROWN THRASHER (Harporhynchus rufus) Thrasher and Mocking-bird   family\\n\\nCalled also: BROWN THRUSH; GROUND THRUSH; RED THRUSH; BROWN   MOCKING-BIRD; FRENCH MOCKING-BIRD; MAVIS\\n\\nLength -- 11 to 11.5 inches. Fully an inch longer than the robin. Male -- Rusty red-brown or rufous above; darkest on wings, which   have two short whitish bands. Underneath white, heavily   streaked (except on throat) with dark-brown, arrow-shaped   spots. Tail very long. Yellow eyes. Bill long and curved at   tip. Female -- Paler than male. Range -- United States to Rockies. Nests from Gulf States to   Manitoba and Montreal. Winters south of Virginia. Migrations -- Late April. October. Common summer resident\\n\\n```\\n \\\"There's a merry brown thrush sitting up in a tree;       He is singing to me! He is singing to me!       And what does he say, little girl, little boy?       'Oh, the world's running over with joy!'\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThe hackneyed poem beginning with this stanza that delighted our nursery days, has left in our minds a fairly correct impression of the bird. He still proves to be one of the perennially joyous singers, like a true cousin of the wrens, and when we study him afield, he appears to give his whole attention to his song with a self-consciousness that is rather amusing than the reverse. \\\"What musician wouldn't be conscious of his own powers,\\\" he seems to challenge us, \\\"if he possessed such a gift?\\\" Seated on a conspicuous perch, as if inviting attention to his performance, with uplifted head and drooping tail he repeats the one exultant, dashing air to which his repertoire is limited, without waiting for an encore. Much practice has given the notes a brilliancy of execution to be compared only with the mockingbird's; but in spite of the name \\\"ferruginous mocking-bird\\\" that Audubon gave him, he does not seem to have the faculty of imitating other birds' songs. Thoreau says the Massachusetts farmers, when planting their seed, always think they hear the thrasher say, \\\"Drop it, drop it -- cover it up, cover it up -- pull it up, pull it up, pull it up.\\\"\\n\\nOne of the shatterings of childish impressions that age too often brings is when we learn by the books that our \\\"merry brown thrush\\\" is no thrush at all, but a thrasher -- first cousin to the wrens, in spite of his speckled breast, large size, and certain thrush-like instincts, such as never singing near the nest and shunning mankind in the nesting season, to mention only two. Certainly his bold, swinging flight and habit of hopping and running over the ground would seem to indicate that he is not very far removed from the true thrushes. But he has one undeniable wren-like trait, that of twitching, wagging, and thrashing his long tail about to help express his emotions. It swings like a pendulum as he rests on a branch, and thrashes about in a most ludicrous way as he is feeding on the ground upon the worms, insects, and fruit that constitute his diet.\\n\\nBefore the fatal multiplication of cats, and in unfrequented, sandy locations still, the thrasher builds her nest upon the ground, thus earning the name \\\"ground thrush\\\" that is often given her; but with dearly paid-for wisdom she now most frequently selecting a low shrub or tree to cradle the two broods that all too early in the summer effectually silence the father's delightful song.\\n\\nWILSON'S THRUSH (Turdus fuscescens) Thrush family\\n\\nCalled also: VEERY {AOU 1998\\\\]; TAWNY THRUSH\\n\\nLength -- 7 to 7.5 inches. About one-fourth smaller than the   robin. Male and Female -- Uniform olive-brown, with a tawny cast above.   Centre of the throat white, with cream-buff on sides of throat   and upper part of breast, which is lightly spotted with   wedge-shaped, brown points. Underneath white, or with a faint   grayish tinge. Range -- United States, westward to plains. Migrations -- May. October. Summer resident.\\n\\nTo many of us the veery, as they call the Wilson's thrush in New England, is merely a voice, a sylvan mystery, reflecting the sweetness and wildness of the forest, a vocal \\\"will-o'-the-wisp\\\" that, after enticing us deeper and deeper into the woods, where we sink into the spongy moss of its damp retreats and become entangled in the wild grape-vines twined about the saplings and underbrush, still sings to us from unapproachable tangles. Plainly, if we want to see the bird, we must let it seek us out on the fallen log where we have sunk exhausted in the chase.\\n\\nPresently a brown bird scuds through the fern. It is a thrush, you guess in a minute, from its slender, graceful body. At first you notice no speckles on its breast, but as it comes nearer, obscure arrow-heads are visible -- not heavy, heart-shaped spots such as plentifully speckle the larger wood thrush or the smaller hermit. It is the smallest of the three commoner thrushes, and it lacks the ring about the eye that both the others have. Shy and elusive, it slips away again in a most unfriendly fashion, and is lost in the wet tangle before you have become acquainted. You determine, however, before you leave the log, to cultivate the acquaintance of this bird the next spring, when, before it mates and retreats to the forest, it comes boldly into the gardens and scratches about in the dry leaves on the ground for the lurking insects beneath. Miss Florence Merriam tells of having drawn a number of veeries about her by imitating their call-note, which is a whistled wheew, whoit, very easy to counterfeit when once heard. \\\"Taweel-ah, taweel-ah, twil-ah, twil-ah!\\\" Professor Ridgeway interprets their song, that descends in a succession of trills without break or pause; but no words can possibly convey an idea of the quality of the music. The veery, that never claims an audience, sings at night also, and its weird, sweet strains floating through the woods at dusk, thrill one like the mysterious voice of a disembodied spirit.\\n\\nWhittier mentions the veery in \\\"The Playmate\\\":\\n\\n```\\n \\\"And here in spring the veeries sing       The song of long ago.\\\"\\n```\\n\\nWOOD THRUSH (Turdus mustelinus) Thrush family\\n\\nCalled also: SONG THRUSH; WOOD ROBIN; BELLBIRD\\n\\nLength -- 8 to 8.3 inches. About two inches shorter than the   robin. Male and Female -- Brown above, reddish on head and shoulders,    shading into olive-brown on tail. Throat, breast, and   underneath white, plain in the middle, but heavily marked on   sides and breast with heart-shaped spots of very dark brown.   Whitish eye-ring. Migrations -- Late April or early May. October. Summer resident.\\n\\nWhen Nuttall wrote of \\\"this solitary and retiring songster,\\\" before the country was as thickly settled as it is to-day, it possibly had not developed the confidence in men that now distinguishes the wood thrush from its shy congeners that are distinctly wood birds, which it can no longer strictly be said to be. In city parks and country places, where plenty of trees shade the village streets and lawns, it comes near you, half hopping, half running, with dignified unconsciousness and even familiarity, all the more delightful in a bird whose family instincts should take it into secluded woodlands with their shady dells. Perhaps, in its heart of hearts, it still prefers such retreats. Many conservative wood thrushes keep to their wild haunts, and it must be owned not a few liberals, that discard family traditions at other times, seek the forest at nesting time. But social as the wood thrush is and abundant, too, it is also eminently high-bred; and when contrasted with its tawny cousin, the veery, that skulks away to hide in the nearest bushes as you approach, or with the hermit thrush, that pours out its heavenly song in the solitude of the forest, how gracious and full of gentle confidence it seems! Every gesture is graceful and elegant; even a wriggling beetle is eaten as daintily as caviare at the king's table. It is only when its confidence in you is abused, and you pass too near the nest, that might easily be mistaken for a robin's, just above your head in a sapling, that the wood thrush so far forgets itself as to become excited. Pit, pit, pit, sharply reiterated, is called out at you with a strident quality in the tone that is painful evidence of the fearful anxiety your presence gives this gentle bird.\\n\\nToo many guardians of nests, whether out of excessive happiness or excessive stupidity, have a dangerous habit of singing very near them. Not so the wood thrush. \\\"Come to me,\\\" as the opening notes of its flute-like song have been freely translated, invites the intruder far away from where the blue eggs lie  cradled in ambush.  is as good a rendering into syllables of the luscious song as could very well be made. Pure, liquid, rich, and luscious, it rings out from the trees on the summer air and penetrates our home like \\\"Uoli-a-e-o-li-noli-nol-aeolee-lee! strait of music from a stringed quartette.\\n\\nHERMIT THRUSH (Turdus aonalaschkae pallasii) Thrush family\\n\\nCalled also: SWAMP ANGEL; LITTLE THRUSH\\n\\nLength  -- 7.25 to 7.5 inches. About one-fourth smaller than the   robin. Male and Female -- Upper parts olive-brown, reddening near the   tail, which is pale rufous, quite distinct from the color of   the back. Throat, sides of neck, and breast pale buff. Feathers   of throat and neck finished with dark arrow-points at tip;   feathers of the breast have larger rounded spots. Sides   brownish gray. Underneath white. A yellow ring around the eye.   Smallest of the thrushes. Range -- Eastern parts of North America. Most common in the   United States to the plains. Winters from southern Illinois and   New Jersey to Gulf. Migrations -- April. November. Summer resident.\\n\\nThe first thrush to come and the last to go, nevertheless the hermit is little seen throughout its long visit north. It may loiter awhile in the shrubby roadsides, in the garden or the parks in the spring before it begins the serious business of life in a nest of moss, coarse grass, and pine-needles placed on the ground in the depths of the forest, but by the middle of May its presence in the neighborhood of our homes becomes only a memory. Although one never hears it at its best during the migrations, how one loves to recall the serene, ethereal evening hymn! \\\"The finest sound in Nature,\\\" John Burroughs calls it. \\\"It is not a proud, gorgeous strain like the tanager's or the grosbeak's,\\\" he says; \\\"it suggests no passion or emotion -- nothing personal, but seems to be the voice of that calm, sweet solemnity one attains to in his best moments. It realizes a peace and a deep, solemn joy that only the finest souls may know.\\\"\\n\\nBeyond the question of even the hypercritical, the hermit thrush has a more exquisitely beautiful voice than any other American bird, and only the nightingale's of Europe can be compared with it. It is the one theme that exhausts all the ornithologists' musical adjectives in a vain attempt to convey in words any idea of it to one who has never heard it, for the quality of the song is as elusive as the bird itself. But why should the poets be so silent? Why has it not called forth such verse as the English poets have lavished upon the nightingale? Undoubtedly because it lifts up its heavenly voice in the solitude of the forest. whereas the nightingales, singing in loud choruses in the moonlight under the poet's very window, cannot but impress his waking thoughts and even his dreams with their melody.\\n\\nSince the severe storm and cold in the Gulf States a few winters ago, where vast numbers of hermit thrushes died from cold and starvation, this bird has been very rare in haunts where it used to be abundant. The other thrushes escaped because they spend the winter farther south.\\n\\nALICE'S THRUSH (Turdus alicia) Thrush family\\n\\nCalled also: GRAY-CHEEKED THRUSH; \\\\[now separated into two   species: the more mid-western GRAY-CHEEKED THRUSH and the New   England and Adirondack BICKNELL'S THRUSH, AOU 1998\\\\]\\n\\nLength -- 7.5 to 8 inches. About the size of the bluebird. Male and Female --  Upper parts uniform olive-brown. Eye-ring   whitish. Cheeks gray; sides dull grayish white. Sides of the   throat and breast pale cream-buff, speckled with arrow-shaped   points on throat and with half-round dark-brown marks below. Range -- North America, from Labrador and Alaska to Central   America. Migrations -- Late April or May. October. Chiefly seen in   migrations, except at northern parts of its range.\\n\\nOne looks for a prettier bird than this least attractive of all the thrushes in one that bears such a suggestive name. Like the olive-backed thrush, from which it is almost impossible to tell it when both are alive and hopping about the shrubbery, its plumage above is a dull olive-brown that is more protective than pleasing.\\n\\nJust as Wilson hopelessly confused the olive-backed thrush with the hermit, so has Alice's thrush been confounded by later writers with the olive-backed, from which it differs chiefly in being a trifle larger, in having gray cheeks instead of buff, and in possessing a few faint streaks on the throat. Where it goes to make a home for its greenish-blue speckled eggs in some low bush at the northern end of its range, it bursts into song, but except in the nesting grounds its voice is never heard. Mr. Bradford Torrey, who heard it singing in the White Mountains, describes the song as like the thrush's in quality, but differently accented: \\\"Wee-o-wee-o-tit-ti-wee-o!\\\"\\n\\nIn New England and New York this thrush is most often seen during its autumn migrations. As it starts up and perches upon a low branch before you, it appears to have longer legs and a broader, squarer tail than its congeners.\\n\\nOLIVE-BACKED THRUSH (Turdus ustulatus swainsonii) Thrush family\\n\\nCalled also: SWAINSON'S THRUSH \\\\[AOU 1998\\\\]\\n\\nLength -- 7 to 7.50 inches. About one-fourth smaller than the   robin. Male and Female -- Upper parts olive-brown. Whole throat and   breast yellow-buff, shading to ashy on sides and to white   underneath. Buff ring around eye. Dark streaks on sides of   throat (none on centre), and larger, more spot-like marks on   breast. Range -- North America to Rockies; a few stragglers on Pacific   slope. Northward to arctic countries. Migrations -- April. October. Summer resident in Canada. Chiefly   a migrant in United States.\\n\\nMr. Parkhurst tells of finding this \\\"the commonest bird in the Park (Central Park, New York), not even excepting the robin,\\\" during the last week of May on a certain year; but usually, it must be owned, we have to be on the lookout to find it, or it will pass unnoticed in the great companies of more conspicuous birds travelling at the same time. White-throated sparrows often keep it company on the long journeys northward, and they may frequently be seen together, hopping sociably about the garden, the thrush calling out a rather harsh note -- puk! puk! --  quite different from the liquid, mellow calls of the other thrushes, to resent either the sparrows' bad manners or the inquisitiveness of a human disturber of its peace. But this gregarious habit and neighborly visit end even before acquaintance fairly begins, and the thrushes are off for their nesting grounds in the pine woods of New England or Labrador if they are travelling up the east coast, or to Alaska, British Columbia, or Manitoba if west of the Mississippi. There they stay all summer, often travelling southward with the sparrows in the autumn, as in the spring.\\n\\nWhy they should prefer coniferous trees, unless to utilize the needles for a nest, is not understood. Low trees and bushes are favorite building sites with them as with others of the family, though these thrushes disdain a mud lining to their nests. Those who have heard the olive-backed thrush singing an even-song to its brooding mate compare it with the veery's, but it has a break in it and is less simple and pleasing than the latter's.\\n\\nLOUISIANA WATER THRUSH (Seiurus motacilla) Wood Warbler family\\n\\nLength -- 6 to 6.28 inches. Just a trifle smaller than the   English sparrow. Male and Female -- Grayish olive-brown upper parts, with   conspicuous white line over the eye and reaching almost to the   nape. Underneath white, tinged with pale buff. Throat and line   through the middle, plain. Other parts streaked with very dark   brown, rather faintly on the breast, giving them the speckled   breast of the thrushes. Heavy, dark bill. Range -- United States, westward to the plains; northward to   southern New England. Winters in the tropics. Migrations -- Late April. October. Summer resident.\\n\\nThis bird, that so delighted Audubon with its high-trilled song as he tramped with indefatigable zeal through the hammocks of the Gulf States, seems to be almost the counterpart of the Northern water thrush, just as the loggerhead is the Southern counterpart of the Northern shrike. Very many Eastern birds have their duplicates in Western species, as we all know, and it is most interesting to trace the slight external variations that different climates and diet have produced on the same bird, and thus differentiated the species. In winter the Northern water thrush visits the cradle of its kind, the swamps of Louisiana and Florida, and, no doubt, by daily contact with its congeners there, keeps close to their cherished traditions, from which it never deviates farther than Nature compels, though it penetrate to the arctic regions during its summer journeys.\\n\\nWith a more southerly range, the Louisiana water thrush does not venture beyond the White Mountains and to the shores of the Great Lakes in summer, but even at the North the same woods often contain both birds, and there is opportunity to note just how much they differ. The Southern bird is slightly the larger, possibly an inch; it is more gray, and it lacks a few of the streaks, notably on the throat, that plentifully speckle its Northern counterpart; but the habits of both of these birds appear to be identical. Only for a few days in the spring or autumn migrations do they pass near enough to our homes for us to study them, and then we must ever be on the alert to steal a glance at them through the opera-glasses, for birds more shy than they do not visit the garden shrubbery at any season. Only let them suspect they are being stared at, and they are under cover in a twinkling.\\n\\nWhere mountain streams dash through tracts of mossy, spongy ground that is carpeted with fern and moss, and overgrown with impenetrable thickets of underbrush and tangles of creepers -- such a place is the favorite resort of both the water thrushes. With a rubber boot missing, clothes torn, and temper by no means unruffled, you finally stand over the Louisiana thrush's nest in the roots of an upturned tree immediately over the water, or else in a mossy root-belaced bank above a purling stream. A liquid-trilled warble, wild and sweet, breaks the stillness, and, like Audubon, you feel amply rewarded for your pains though you may not be prepared to agree with him in thinking the song the equal of the European nightingale's.\\n\\nNORTHERN WATER THRUSH (Seiurus noveboracensis) Wood Warbler family\\n\\nCalled also: NEW YORK WATER THRUSH; AQUATIC WOOD WAGTAIL; AQUATIC   THRUSH\",\"timestamp\":1641275070,\"title\":\"\\nThe beautiful, soft-colored plumage of this incessant and rather melancholy love-maker is not on public exhibition\"},\"digest\":\"D0O-nuVSJqbFeUNq1RJXm0mfi0kWiOZQQS30P8AAijY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x1928Fa8c1480697A043aA639A3c2C52BE5B7890a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Xgq6-gx9NIcox83QYfiqU4Xi3dIkkQ7FGBBUrAvgKGE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xshVCfMXT13Zr2pwXrrQ8no3iM8MA9Cx7Q0wOF4oiH4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"tKZT0wjgtoZYGDX94aoaVY5sdZXir-5nALD6oLB6G6Ri-POc5NdLXumYxueSj7EkQVNV7B2D_or6tbzmSkAnXw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc2915f508c470a2722a4ce73fed65c9347ae24c5a106468b1af15839395171e91d9ca4c2d65449597024ea314327baa430722944031d3ce541f337f3160405471c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Xgq6-gx9NIcox83QYfiqU4Xi3dIkkQ7FGBBUrAvgKGE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xshVCfMXT13Zr2pwXrrQ8no3iM8MA9Cx7Q0wOF4oiH4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"D0O-nuVSJqbFeUNq1RJXm0mfi0kWiOZQQS30P8AAijY\"}"
