"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Financial services is an industry, and the infrastructure supporting it is owned by the company. It itself is a vertical product and service. Financial services regulation is a gatekeeper that can prevent anyone from providing these products and services.\\n\\nBlockchain makes it horizontal because core financial functions such as settlement, exchange, and credit are now integrated into the Internet.\\n\\nOne of the best examples of the impact of horizontal financial services is that Axie Infinity players are able to borrow/loan their Axies in exchange for revenue, without the need to cooperate with lending platforms, and financial services can be embedded in the game experience without permission.\\n\\nAnother cool effect is that it provides economic creation tools for online communities of any size.\\n\\nThe Internet is an incredible horizontal force. It is global, permissionless and has nothing to do with the industry.\\n\\nThe meta universe is also horizontal-a virtual Internet space that transcends national boundaries.\\n\\nWhen you put financial services and Metaverse together, you will have a sandbox for an economy that adopts all the characteristics of the Internet-global, open and 24/7.\\n\\nThe horizontal line can be an incredible balancing force in the world. They eliminate many geographical advantages/disadvantages. Being born in a first world country has very obvious advantages-education, access to professional opportunities and financial services. As the blockchain and Metaverse mature, some of them may tend to balance over time.\\n\\nMy hunch is that people living in countries with fewer economic opportunities will migrate first. They have more gains, and many people are willing to move physically for better opportunities.\\n\\nIn Metaverse, there is no friction. You don't need a ticket or visa, only an internet connection. The large-scale migration of people from first world countries like the United States to these new economies will be slower because there is not so much motivation.\",\"timestamp\":1634574743,\"title\":\"The vertical and horizontal of the meta-universe\"},\"digest\":\"vu_eaiM4FRizQt9lbbErWqK6izW24flKRiByZBtKFWc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x13bf5E5dA04a39F01f4cb8835e37dc76d3E8666b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"E0bTqn5k2Z54YZbdr7SsbH-97F0fsZwFG-z3SBCQn0A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"yf3tWQT-5uHnF07exVjakxtXLpW7Qrv1ZiPJfVw9dic\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"xlNjGZGga58kOkx4uOytywQ7NvurlkaymHpJO_m6i4-PWFt_kaAua7AmxjatCE98E8M3VgmsHRXBxtPTnyacSA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xcf50e58af770a05904ef43fad5b01580bea544722d4a6bd914e3445d85ca450c725b4be066736b693cd3db50b312dfc6a5c74f17d8f951fe163c6de3834ecfb81c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"E0bTqn5k2Z54YZbdr7SsbH-97F0fsZwFG-z3SBCQn0A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"yf3tWQT-5uHnF07exVjakxtXLpW7Qrv1ZiPJfVw9dic\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"vu_eaiM4FRizQt9lbbErWqK6izW24flKRiByZBtKFWc\"}"
