One of the main drivers behind the surge of this metric is blockchain-based games.*\\n\\n*Propelled by the P2E narrative, the number of unique active wallets connected to blockchain games reached 754,000 in Q3. This amount represents 49% of the whole industry’s usage.”*\\n\\nThe blockchain-based game Axie Infinity is a big reason why interest in P2E games has skyrocketed, according to DappRadar.\\n\\n*“The case can be made for Axie Infinity as the true catalyzer of the play-to-earn revolution. Since moving to the Ronin sidechain, the game has reached impressive levels. During Q3, Axie became the most traded collection ever, surpassing blue-chip NFT collections like CryptoPunks and NBA Top Shot.*\\n\\n*At the time of writing, Axie has generated over $2.5 billion in trading volume. In Q3 alone, Axie Infinity amassed $2.08 billion in trading volume or 83% of the game’s historical trading value.”*\\n\\nSource: [DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/blog/bga-blockchain-game-report-q3-2021)\\n\\nAxie Infinity’s governance token, AXS, is trading at $134.70 at time of writing and is up nearly 105% in the past 30 days, according to [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/axie-infinity). \\n\\n*Don't Miss a Beat –[Subscribe](https://dailyhodl.com/join-the-daily-hodl-email-list/)to get crypto email alerts delivered directly to your inbox* \\n  \\n *Follow us on[Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheDailyHodl),[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/thedailyhodl/)and[Telegram](https://t.me/thedailyhodl)* \\n  \\n *Surf[The Daily Hodl Mix](https://dailyhodl.com/daily-hodl-mix)*\",\"timestamp\":1635337664,\"title\":\"Nearly Half of Active Crypto Wallets Connected to Blockchain-Based Games As Axie Infinity Records Impressive Q3: Report\"},\"digest\":\"vzo5pUTDGiIaFV35kxnvbgqeTftUQN2UXza_4PN3H44\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8B618F70Ab9b48034d51dD2B87eFEf243B118980\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"vCxW8sx_9oWheExrgvZjvCw50CxiZTFnO8zBjEti09A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"HTz0yu-zjWzhDSVPOejbECYicGCv9h-V8YVmQCGGLIg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"DSFcjfhcWD1_UOgoABCnE3Xo-y3DznEZlyG6DiYhCtVd06LuIo1ht_07943EG2J9Xh5jfT52vDvknULOfF9iag\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa5b27aa47e129d38a176c4e9829da067d98fc82c2b6692b65f5c7f293792481d5180205c92460d9939febedab9b5eb25ba094d3a8d45d119caecdd64b3118d5c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"vCxW8sx_9oWheExrgvZjvCw50CxiZTFnO8zBjEti09A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"HTz0yu-zjWzhDSVPOejbECYicGCv9h-V8YVmQCGGLIg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"vzo5pUTDGiIaFV35kxnvbgqeTftUQN2UXza_4PN3H44\"}"
