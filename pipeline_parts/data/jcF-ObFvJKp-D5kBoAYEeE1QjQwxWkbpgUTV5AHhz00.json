"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"almost lapped her feet with their spent foam.  Whirling round and round, laughing like a child, she reached the little headland that ran out to the east of the cove; then she stopped suddenly, blushing crimson; she was not alone; there had been a witness to her dance and laughter.\\n\\nThe girl of the golden hair and sea-blue eyes was sitting on a boulder of the headland, half-hidden by a jutting rock.  She was looking straight at Anne with a strange expression--part wonder, part sympathy, part--could it be?--envy.  She was bare-headed, and her splendid hair, more than ever like Browning's \\\"gorgeous snake,\\\" was bound about her head with a crimson ribbon.  She wore a dress of some dark material, very plainly made; but swathed about her waist, outlining its fine curves, was a vivid girdle of red silk.  Her hands, clasped over her knee, were brown and somewhat work- hardened; but the skin of her throat and cheeks was as white as cream.  A flying gleam of sunset broke through a low-lying western cloud and fell across her hair.  For a moment she seemed the spirit of the sea personified--all its mystery, all its passion, all its elusive charm.\\n\\n\\\"You--you must think me crazy,\\\" stammered Anne, trying to recover her self-possession.  To be seen by this stately girl in such an abandon of childishness--she, Mrs. Dr. Blythe, with all the dignity of the matron to keep up--it was too bad!\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said the girl, \\\"I don't.\\\"\\n\\nShe said nothing more; her voice was expressionless; her manner slightly repellent; but there was something in her eyes--eager yet shy, defiant yet pleading--which turned Anne from her purpose of walking away.  Instead, she sat down on the boulder beside the girl.\\n\\n\\\"Let's introduce ourselves,\\\" she said, with the smile that had never yet failed to win confidence and friendliness.  \\\"I am Mrs. Blythe--and I live in that little white house up the harbor shore.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I know,\\\" said the girl.  \\\"I am Leslie Moore--Mrs. Dick Moore,\\\" she added stiffly.\\n\\nAnne was silent for a moment from sheer amazement.  It had not occurred to her that this girl was married--there seemed nothing of the wife about her.  And that she should be the neighbor whom Anne had pictured as a commonplace Four Winds housewife!  Anne could not quickly adjust her mental focus to this astonishing change.\\n\\n\\\"Then--then you live in that gray house up the brook,\\\" she stammered.\\n\\n\\\"Yes.  I should have gone over to call on you long ago,\\\" said the other.  She did not offer any explanation or excuse for not having gone.\\n\\n\\\"I wish you WOULD come,\\\" said Anne, recovering herself somewhat.  \\\"We're such near neighbors we ought to be friends.  That is the sole fault of Four Winds--there aren't quite enough neighbors.  Otherwise it is perfection.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You like it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"LIKE it!  I love it.  It is the most beautiful place I ever saw.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've never seen many places,\\\" said Leslie Moore, slowly, \\\"but I've always thought it was very lovely here.  I--I love it, too.\\\"\\n\\nShe spoke, as she looked, shyly, yet eagerly.  Anne had an odd impression that this strange girl--the word \\\"girl\\\" would persist-- could say a good deal if she chose.\\n\\n\\\"I often come to the shore,\\\" she added.\\n\\n\\\"So do I,\\\" said Anne.  \\\"It's a wonder we haven't met here before.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Probably you come earlier in the evening than I do.  It is generally late--almost dark--when I come.  And I love to come just after a storm--like this.  I don't like the sea so well when it's calm and quiet.  I like the struggle--and the crash--and the noise.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I love it in all its moods,\\\" declared Anne.  \\\"The sea at Four Winds is to me what Lover's Lane was at home.  Tonight it seemed so free--so untamed--something broke loose in me, too, out of sympathy.  That was why I danced along the shore in that wild way.  I didn't suppose anybody was looking, of course.  If Miss Cornelia Bryant had seen me she would have forboded a gloomy prospect for poor young Dr. Blythe.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You know Miss Cornelia?\\\" said Leslie, laughing.  She had an exquisite laugh; it bubbled up suddenly and unexpectedly with something of the delicious quality of a baby's.  Anne laughed, too.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes.  She has been down to my house of dreams several times.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your house of dreams?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, that's a dear, foolish little name Gilbert and I have for our home.  We just call it that between ourselves.  It slipped out before I thought.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So Miss Russell's little white house is YOUR house of dreams,\\\" said Leslie wonderingly.  \\\"*I* had a house of dreams once--but it was a palace,\\\" she added, with a laugh, the sweetness of which was marred by a little note of derision.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I once dreamed of a palace, too,\\\" said Anne.  \\\"I suppose all girls do.  And then we settle down contentedly in eight-room houses that seem to fulfill all the desires of our hearts--because our prince is there.  YOU should have had your palace really, though--you are so beautiful.  You MUST let me say it--it has to be said--I'm nearly bursting with admiration.  You are the loveliest thing I ever saw, Mrs. Moore.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If we are to be friends you must call me Leslie,\\\" said the other with an odd passion.\\n\\n\\\"Of course I will.  And MY friends call me Anne.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I suppose I am beautiful,\\\" Leslie went on, looking stormily out to sea.  \\\"I hate my beauty.  I wish I had always been as brown and plain as the brownest and plainest girl at the fishing village over there.  Well, what do you think of Miss Cornelia?\\\"\\n\\nThe abrupt change of subject shut the door on any further confidences.\\n\\n\\\"Miss Cornelia is a darling, isn't she?\\\" said Anne.  \\\"Gilbert and I were invited to her house to a state tea last week.  You've heard of groaning tables.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I seem to recall seeing the expression in the newspaper reports of weddings,\\\" said Leslie, smiling.\\n\\n\\\"Well, Miss Cornelia's groaned--at least, it creaked--positively.  You couldn't have believed she would have cooked so much for two ordinary people.  She had every kind of pie you could name, I think--except lemon pie.  She said she had taken the prize for lemon pies at the Charlottetown Exhibition ten years ago and had never made any since for fear of losing her reputation for them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Were you able to eat enough pie to please her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"*I* wasn't.  Gilbert won her heart by eating--I won't tell you how much.  She said she never knew a man who didn't like pie better than his Bible.  Do you know, I love Miss Cornelia.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So do I,\\\" said Leslie.  \\\"She is the best friend I have in the world.\\\"\\n\\nAnne wondered secretly why, if this were so, Miss Cornelia had never mentioned Mrs. Dick Moore to her.  Miss Cornelia had certainly talked freely about every other individual in or near Four Winds.\\n\\n\\\"Isn't that beautiful?\\\" said Leslie, after a brief silence, pointing to the exquisite effect of a shaft of light falling through a cleft in the rock behind them, across a dark green pool at its base.  \\\"If I had come here--and seen nothing but just that--I would go home satisfied.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The effects of light and shadow all along these shores are wonderful,\\\" agreed Anne.  \\\"My little sewing room looks out on the harbor, and I sit at its window and feast my eyes.  The colors and shadows are never the same two minutes together.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you are never lonely?\\\" asked Leslie abruptly.  \\\"Never-- when you are alone?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.  I don't think I've ever been really lonely in my life,\\\" answered Anne.  \\\"Even when I'm alone I have real good company-- dreams and imaginations and pretendings.  I LIKE to be alone now and then, just to think over things and TASTE them.  But I love friendship-- and nice, jolly little times with people.  Oh, WON'T you come to see me--often?  Please do.  I believe,\\\" Anne added, laughing, \\\"that you'd like me if you knew me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I wonder if YOU would like ME,\\\" said Leslie seriously.  She was not fishing for a compliment.  She looked out across the waves that were beginning to be garlanded with blossoms of moonlit foam, and her eyes filled with shadows.\\n\\n\\\"I'm sure I would,\\\" said Anne.  \\\"And please don't think I'm utterly irresponsible because you saw me dancing on the shore at sunset.  No doubt I shall be dignified after a time.  You see, I haven't been married very long.  I feel like a girl, and sometimes like a child, yet.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have been married twelve years,\\\" said Leslie.\\n\\nHere was another unbelievable thing.\\n\\n\\\"Why, you can't be as old as I am!\\\" exclaimed Anne.  \\\"You must have been a child when you were married.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I was sixteen,\\\" said Leslie, rising, and picking up the cap and jacket lying beside her.  \\\"I am twenty-eight now.  Well, I must go back.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So must I.  Gilbert will probably be home.  But I'm so glad we both came to the shore tonight and met each other.\\\"\\n\\nLeslie said nothing, and Anne was a little chilled.  She had offered friendship frankly but it had not been accepted very graciously, if it had not been absolutely repelled.  In silence they climbed the cliffs and walked across a pasture-field of which the feathery, bleached, wild grasses were like a carpet of creamy velvet in the moonlight.  When they reached the shore lane Leslie turned.\\n\\n\\\"I go this way, Mrs. Blythe.  You will come over and see me some time, won't you?\\\"\\n\\nAnne felt as if the invitation had been thrown at her.  She got the impression that Leslie Moore gave it reluctantly.\\n\\n\\\"I will come if you really want me to,\\\" she said a little coldly.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I do--I do,\\\" exclaimed Leslie, with an eagerness which seemed to burst forth and beat down some restraint that had been imposed on it.\\n\\n\\\"Then I'll come.  Good-night--Leslie.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good-night, Mrs. Blythe.\\\"\\n\\nAnne walked home in a brown study and poured out her tale to Gilbert.\\n\\n\\\"So Mrs. Dick Moore isn't one of the race that knows Joseph?\\\" said Gilbert teasingly.\\n\\n\\\"No--o--o, not exactly.  And yet--I think she WAS one of them once, but has gone or got into exile,\\\" said Anne musingly.  \\\"She is certainly very different from the other women about here.  You can't talk about eggs and butter to HER.  To think I've been imagining her a second Mrs. Rachel Lynde!  Have you ever seen Dick Moore, Gilbert?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.  I've seen several men working about the fields of the farm, but I don't know which was Moore.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She never mentioned him.  I KNOW she isn't happy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"From what you tell me I suppose she was married before she was old enough to know her own mind or heart, and found out too late that she had made a mistake.  It's a common tragedy enough, Anne.\\n\\nA fine woman would have made the best of it.  Mrs. Moore has evidently let it make her bitter and resentful.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't let us judge her till we know,\\\" pleaded Anne.  \\\"I don't believe her case is so ordinary.  You will understand her fascination when you meet her, Gilbert.  It is a thing quite apart from her beauty.  I feel that she possesses a rich nature, into which a friend might enter as into a kingdom; but for some reason she bars every one out and shuts all her possibilities up in herself, so that they cannot develop and blossom.  There, I've been struggling to define her to myself ever since I left her, and that is the nearest I can get to it.  I'm going to ask Miss Cornelia about her.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER 11\\n\\nTHE STORY OF LESLIE MOORE\\n\\n\\\"Yes, the eighth baby arrived a fortnight ago,\\\" said Miss Cornelia, from a rocker before the fire of the little house one chilly October afternoon.  \\\"It's a girl.  Fred was ranting mad--said he wanted a boy--when the truth is he didn't want it at all.  If it had been a boy he'd have ranted because it wasn't a girl.  They had four girls and three boys before, so I can't see that it made much difference what this one was, but of course he'd have to be cantankerous, just like a man.  The baby is real pretty, dressed up in its nice little clothes.  It has black eyes and the dearest, tiny hands.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I must go and see it.  I just love babies,\\\" said Anne, smiling to herself over a thought too dear and sacred to be put into words.\\n\\n\\\"I don't say but what they're nice,\\\" admitted Miss Cornelia.  \\\"But some folks seem to have more than they really need, believe ME.  My poor cousin Flora up at the Glen had eleven, and such a slave as she is!  Her husband suicided three years ago.  Just like a man!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What made him do that?\\\" asked Anne, rather shocked.\\n\\n\\\"Couldn't get his way over something, so he jumped into the well .  A good riddance!  He was a born tyrant.  But of course it spoiled the well.  Flora could never abide the thought of using it again, poor thing!  So she had another dug and a frightful expense it was, and the water as hard as nails.  If he HAD to drown himself there was plenty of water in the harbor, wasn't there?  I've no patience with a man like that.  We've only had two suicides in Four Winds in my recollection.  The other was Frank West--Leslie Moore's father.  By the way, has Leslie ever been over to call on you yet?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, but I met her on the shore a few nights ago and we scraped an acquaintance,\\\" said Anne, pricking up her ears.\\n\\nMiss Cornelia nodded.\\n\\n\\\"I'm glad, dearie.  I was hoping you'd foregather with her.  What do you think of her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I thought her very beautiful.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, of course.  There was never anybody about Four Winds could touch her for looks.  Did you ever see her hair?  It reaches to her feet when she lets it down.  But I meant how did you like her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think I could like her very much if she'd let me,\\\" said Anne slowly.\\n\\n\\\"But she wouldn't let you--she pushed you off and kept you at arm's length.  Poor Leslie!  You wouldn't be much surprised if you knew what her life has been.  It's been a tragedy--a tragedy!\\\" repeated Miss Cornelia emphatically.\\n\\n\\\"I wish you would tell me all about her--that is, if you can do so without betraying any confidence.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lord, dearie, everybody in Four Winds knows poor Leslie's story.  It's no secret--the OUTSIDE, that is.  Nobody knows the INSIDE but Leslie herself, and she doesn't take folks into her confidence.  I'm about the best friend she has on earth, I reckon, and she's never uttered a word of complaint to me.  Have you ever seen Dick Moore?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I may as well begin at the beginning and tell you everything straight through, so you'll understand it.  As I said, Leslie's father was Frank West.  He was clever and shiftless--just like a man.  Oh, he had heaps of brains--and much good they did him!  He started to go to college, and he went for two years, and then his health broke down.  The Wests were all inclined to be consumptive.  So Frank came home and started farming.  He married Rose Elliott from over harbor.  Rose was reckoned the beauty of Four Winds--Leslie takes her looks from her mother, but she has ten times the spirit and go that Rose had, and a far better figure.  Now you know, Anne, I always take the ground that us women ought to stand by each other.  We've got enough to endure at the hands of the men, the Lord knows, so I hold we hadn't ought to clapper-claw one another, and it isn't often you'll find me running down another woman.  But I never had much use for Rose Elliott.  She was spoiled to begin with, believe ME, and she was nothing but a lazy, selfish, whining creature.  Frank was no hand to work, so they were poor as Job's turkey.  Poor!  They lived on potatoes and point, believe ME.  They had two children--Leslie and Kenneth.  Leslie had her mother's looks and her father's brains, and something she didn't get from either of them.  She took after her Grandmother West--a splendid old lady.  She was the brightest, friendliest, merriest thing when she was a child, Anne.  Everybody liked her.  She was her father's favorite and she was awful fond of him.  They were \\\\`chums,' as she used to say.  She couldn't see any of his faults--and he WAS a taking sort of man in some ways.\\n\\n\\\"Well, when Leslie was twelve years old, the first dreadful thing happened.  She worshipped little Kenneth--he was four years younger than her, and he WAS a dear little chap.  And he was killed one day--fell off a big load of hay just as it was going into the barn, and the wheel went right over his little body and crushed the life out of it.  And mind you, Anne, Leslie saw it.  She was looking down from the loft.  She gave one screech--the hired man said he never heard such a sound in all his life--he said it would ring in his ears till Gabriel's trump drove it out.  But she never screeched or cried again about it.  She jumped from the loft onto the load and from the load to the floor, and caught up the little bleeding, warm, dead body, Anne--they had to tear it from her before she would let it go.  They sent for me--I can't talk of it.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Cornelia wiped the tears from her kindly brown eyes and sewed in bitter silence for a few minutes.\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" she resumed, \\\"it was all over--they buried little Kenneth in that graveyard over the harbor, and after a while Leslie went back to her school and her studies.  She never mentioned Kenneth's name--I've never heard it cross her lips from that day to this.  I reckon that old hurt still aches and burns at times; but she was only a child and time is real kind to children, Anne, dearie.  After a while she began to laugh again--she had the prettiest laugh.  You don't often hear it now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I heard it once the other night,\\\" said Anne.  \\\"It IS a beautiful laugh.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Frank West began to go down after Kenneth's death.  He wasn't strong and it was a shock to him, because he was real fond of the child, though, as I've said, Leslie was his favorite.  He got mopy and melancholy, and couldn't or wouldn't work.  And one day, when Leslie was fourteen years of age, he hanged himself--and in the parlor, too, mind you, Anne, right in the middle of the parlor from the lamp hook in the ceiling.  Wasn't that like a man?  It was the anniversary of his wedding day, too.  Nice, tasty time to pick for it, wasn't it?  And, of course, that poor Leslie had to be the one to find him.  She went into the parlor that morning, singing, with some fresh flowers for the vases, and there she saw her father hanging from the ceiling, his face as black as a coal.  It was something awful, believe ME!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, how horrible!\\\" said Anne, shuddering.  \\\"The poor, poor child!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Leslie didn't cry at her father's funeral any more then she had cried at Kenneth's.  Rose whooped and howled for two, however, and Leslie had all she could do trying to calm and comfort her mother.  I was disgusted with Rose and so was everyone else, but Leslie never got out of patience.  She loved her mother.  Leslie is clannish--her own could never do wrong in her eyes.  Well, they buried Frank West beside Kenneth, and Rose put up a great big monument to him.  It was bigger than his character, believe ME!  Anyhow, it was bigger than Rose could afford, for the farm was mortgaged for more than its value.  But not long after Leslie's old grandmother West died and she left Leslie a little money--enough to give her a year at Queen's Academy.  Leslie had made up her mind to pass for a teacher if she could, and then earn enough to put herself through Redmond College.  That had been her father's pet scheme--he wanted her to have what he had lost.  Leslie was full of ambition and her head was chock full of brains.  She went to Queen's, and she took two years' work in one year and got her First; and when she came home she got the Glen school.  She was so happy and hopeful and full of life and eagerness.  When I think of what she was then and what she is now, I say--drat the men!\\\"\\n\\nMiss Cornelia snipped her thread off as viciously as if, Nero-like, she was severing the neck of mankind by the stroke.\\n\\n\\\"Dick Moore came into her life that summer.  His father, Abner Moore, kept store at the Glen, but Dick had a sea-going streak in him from his mother; he used to sail in summer and clerk in his father's store in winter.  He was a big, handsome fellow, with a little ugly soul.  He was always wanting something till he got it, and then he stopped wanting it--just like a man.  Oh, he didn't growl at the weather when it was fine, and he was mostly real pleasant and agreeable when everything went right.  But he drank a good deal, and there were some nasty stories told of him and a girl down at the fishing village.  He wasn't fit for Leslie to wipe her feet on, that's the long and short of it.  And he was a Methodist!  But he was clean mad about her--because of her good looks in the first place, and because she wouldn't have anything to say to him in the second.  He vowed he'd have her--and he got her!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How did he bring it about?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, it was an iniquitous thing!  I'll never forgive Rose West.  You see, dearie, Abner Moore held the mortgage on the West farm, and the interest was overdue some years, and Dick just went and told Mrs. West that if Leslie wouldn't marry him he'd get his father to foreclose the mortgage.  Rose carried on terrible--fainted and wept, and pleaded with Leslie not to let her be turned out of her home.  She said it would break her heart to leave the home she'd come to as a bride.  I wouldn't have blamed her for feeling dreadful bad over it--but you wouldn't have thought she'd be so selfish as to sacrifice her own flesh and blood because of it, would you?  Well, she was.\\n\\nAnd Leslie gave in--she loved her mother so much she would have done anything to save her pain.  She married Dick Moore.  None of us knew why at the time.  It wasn't till long afterward that I found out how her mother had worried her into it.  I was sure there was something wrong, though, because I knew how she had snubbed him time and again, and it wasn't like Leslie to turn face--about like that.  Besides, I knew that Dick Moore wasn't the kind of man Leslie could ever fancy, in spite of his good looks and dashing ways.  Of course, there was no wedding, but Rose asked me to go and see them married.  I went, but I was sorry I did.  I'd seen Leslie's face at her brother's funeral and at her father's funeral--and now it seemed to me I was seeing it at her own funeral.  But Rose was smiling as a basket of chips, believe ME!\\n\\n\\\"Leslie and Dick settled down on the West place--Rose couldn't bear to part with her dear daughter!--and lived there for the winter.  In the spring Rose took pneumonia and died--a year too late!  Leslie was heart-broken enough over it.  Isn't it terrible the way some unworthy folks are loved, while others that deserve it far more, you'd think, never get much affection?  As for Dick, he'd had enough of quiet married life--just like a man.  He was for up and off.  He went over to Nova Scotia to visit his relations--his father had come from Nova Scotia--and he wrote back to Leslie that his cousin, George Moore, was going on a voyage to Havana and he was going too.  The name of the vessel was the Four Sisters and they were to be gone about nine weeks.\\n\\n\\\"It must have been a relief to Leslie.  But she never said anything.  From the day of her marriage she was just what she is now--cold and proud, and keeping everyone but me at a distance.  I won't BE kept at a distance, believe ME!  I've just stuck to Leslie as close as I knew how in spite of everything.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She told me you were the best friend she had,\\\" said Anne.\\n\\n\\\"Did she?\\\" exclaimed Miss Cornelia delightedly.  \\\"Well, I'm real thankful to hear it.  Sometimes I've wondered if she really did want me around at all--she never let me think so.  You must have thawed her out more than you think, or she wouldn't have said that much itself to you.  Oh, that poor, heart-broken girl!  I never see Dick Moore but I want to run a knife clean through him.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Cornelia wiped her eyes again and having relieved her feelings by her blood-thirsty wish, took up her tale.\\n\\n\\\"Well, Leslie was left over there alone.  Dick had put in the crop before he went, and old Abner looked after it.  The summer went by and the Four Sisters didn't come back.  The Nova Scotia Moores investigated, and found she had got to Havana and discharged her cargo and took on another and left for home; and that was all they ever found out about her.  By degrees people began to talk of Dick Moore as one that was dead.  Almost everyone believed that he was, though no one felt certain, for men have turned up here at the harbor after they'd been gone for years.  Leslie never thought he was dead--and she was right.  A thousand pities too!  The next summer Captain Jim was in Havana--that was before he gave up the sea, of course.  He thought he'd poke round a bit--Captain Jim was always meddlesome, just like a man--and he went to inquiring round among the sailors' boarding houses and places like that, to see if he could find out anything about the crew of the Four Sisters.  He'd better have let sleeping dogs lie, in my opinion!  Well, he went to one out-of-the-way place, and there he found a man he knew at first sight it was Dick Moore, though he had a big beard.  Captain Jim got it shaved off and then there was no doubt--Dick Moore it was--his body at least.  His mind wasn't there--as for his soul, in my opinion he never had one!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What had happened to him?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nobody knows the rights of it.  All the folks who kept the boarding house could tell was that about a year before they had found him lying on their doorstep one morning in an awful condition--his head battered to a jelly almost.  They supposed he'd got hurt in some drunken row, and likely that's the truth of it.  They took him in, never thinking he could live.  But he did--and he was just like a child when he got well.  He hadn't memory or intellect or reason.  They tried to find out who he was but they never could.  He couldn't even tell them his name--he could only say a few simple words.  He had a letter on him beginning `Dear Dick' and signed `Leslie,' but there was no address on it and the envelope was gone.  They let him stay on--he learned to do a few odd jobs about the place--and there Captain Jim found him.  He brought him home-- I've always said it was a bad day's work, though I s'pose there was nothing else he could do.  He thought maybe when Dick got home and saw his old surroundings and familiar faces his memory would wake up.  But it hadn't any effect.  There he's been at the house up the brook ever since.  He's just like a child, no more nor less.  Takes fractious spells occasionally, but mostly he's just vacant and good humored and harmless.  He's apt to run away if he isn't watched.  That's the burden Leslie has had to carry for eleven years--and all alone.  Old Abner Moore died soon after Dick was brought home and it was found he was almost bankrupt.  When things were settled up there was nothing for Leslie and Dick but the old West farm.  Leslie rented it to John Ward, and the rent is all she has to live on.  Sometimes in summer she takes a boarder to help out.  But most visitors prefer the other side of the harbor where the hotels and summer cottages are.  Leslie's house is too far from the bathing shore.  She's taken care of Dick and she's never been away from him for eleven years--she's tied to that imbecile for life.  And after all the dreams and hopes she once had!  You can imagine what it has been like for her, Anne, dearie--with her beauty and spirit and pride and cleverness.  It's just been a living death.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Poor, poor girl!\\\" said Anne again.  Her own happiness seemed to reproach her.  What right had she to be so happy when another human soul must be so miserable?\\n\\n\\\"Will you tell me just what Leslie said and how she acted the night you met her on the shore?\\\" asked Miss Cornelia.\\n\\nShe listened intently and nodded her satisfaction.\\n\\n\\\"YOU thought she was stiff and cold, Anne, dearie, but I can tell you she thawed out wonderful for her.  She must have taken to you real strong.  I'm so glad.  You may be able to help her a good deal.  I was thankful when I heard that a young couple was coming to this house, for I hoped it would mean some friends for Leslie; especially if you belonged to the race that knows Joseph.  You WILL be her friend, won't you, Anne, dearie?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Indeed I will, if she'll let me,\\\" said Anne, with all her own sweet, impulsive earnestness.\\n\\n\\\"No, you must be her friend, whether she'll let you or not,\\\" said Miss Cornelia resolutely.  \\\"Don't you mind if she's stiff by times-- don't notice it.  Remember what her life has been--and is--and must always be, I suppose, for creatures like Dick Moore live forever, I understand.  You should see how fat he's got since he came home.  He used to be lean enough.  Just MAKE her be friends--you can do it--you're one of those who have the knack.  Only you mustn't be sensitive.  And don't mind if she doesn't seem to want you to go over there much.  She knows that some women don't like to be where Dick is--they complain he gives them the creeps.  Just get her to come over here as often as she can.  She can't get away so very much--she can't leave Dick long, for the Lord knows what he'd do--burn the house down most likely.  At nights, after he's in bed and asleep, is about the only time she's free.  He always goes to bed early and sleeps like the dead till next morning.  That is how you came to meet her at the shore likely.  She wanders there considerable.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will do everything I can for her,\\\" said Anne.  Her interest in Leslie Moore, which had been vivid ever since she had seen her driving her geese down the hill, was intensified a thousand fold by Miss Cornelia's narration.  The girl's beauty and sorrow and loneliness drew her with an irresistible fascination.  She had never known anyone like her; her friends had hitherto been wholesome, normal, merry girls like herself, with only the average trials of human care and bereavement to shadow their girlish dreams.  Leslie Moore stood apart, a tragic, appealing figure of thwarted womanhood.  Anne resolved that she would win entrance into the kingdom of that lonely soul and find there the comradeship it could so richly give, were it not for the cruel fetters that held it in a prison not of its own making.\\n\\n\\\"And mind you this, Anne, dearie,\\\" said Miss Cornelia, who had not yet wholly relieved her mind, \\\"You mustn't think Leslie is an infidel because she hardly ever goes to church--or even that she's a Methodist.  She can't take Dick to church, of course--not that he ever troubled church much in his best days.  But you just remember that she's a real strong Presbyterian at heart, Anne, dearie.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER 12\\n\\nLESLIE COMES OVER\\n\\nLeslie came over to the house of dreams one frosty October night, when moonlit mists were hanging over the harbor and curling like silver ribbons along the seaward glens.  She looked as if she repented coming when Gilbert answered her knock; but Anne flew past him, pounced on her, and drew her in.\\n\\n\\\"I'm so glad you picked tonight for a call,\\\" she said gaily.  \\\"I made up a lot of extra good fudge this afternoon and we want someone to help us eat it--before the fire--while we tell stories.  Perhaps Captain Jim will drop in, too.  This is his night.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.  Captain Jim is over home,\\\" said Leslie.  \\\"He--he made me come here,\\\" she added, half defiantly.\\n\\n\\\"I'll say a thank-you to him for that when I see him,\\\" said Anne, pulling easy chairs before the fire.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I don't mean that I didn't want to come,\\\" protested Leslie, flushing a little.  \\\"I--I've been thinking of coming--but it isn't always easy for me to get away.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1639709776,\"title\":\"\\nShe caught up her skirt and pirouetted along the hard strip of sand just out of reach of the waves\"},\"digest\":\"7fWTokR62CxLxs89QR5klwOOXQCo9PvKjLP7LLvxt6E\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa216D8906Acd104a8EC6a31f93e945DFe15768c1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"OVl7dAgAUHD1vWC8X8d_CjW96L6DAS4oxUDyn_xOUbM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"T9wD5z4P426vzVxyERlG924kogyWWCHf4lrQSczrXNs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"wjpz3L3-1pFli2MlgmLXh7N0U0_T47lmYBq4Ru1n8ZfsYIxpS3oRyuo7ZcwG8d3Xy8tKynvMJYGRjRNNR7lP2A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe5f33542d53bcfd3961d05b874a0634d28f0962e7eba574e26d5a470815f490d4b45959185c378986ca54408bd89b8fcf4faed62f1154bc7ff7bc52ce59482111b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"OVl7dAgAUHD1vWC8X8d_CjW96L6DAS4oxUDyn_xOUbM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"T9wD5z4P426vzVxyERlG924kogyWWCHf4lrQSczrXNs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"7fWTokR62CxLxs89QR5klwOOXQCo9PvKjLP7LLvxt6E\"}"
