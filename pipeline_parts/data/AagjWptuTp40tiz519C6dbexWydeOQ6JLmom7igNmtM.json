"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Our first NFT mint will occur on December 9th, 2021 at 5 pm pst / 8 pm est.**\\n\\n## How the Mint Works\\n\\n[Forester ](https://www.decentbeta.xyz/profile)is auctioning off 20% of the royalty rights to their song *Spark* in the form of NFTs. By minting a [Spark NFT](https://www.decentbeta.xyz/releases/spark), you are directly supporting Forester by providing them with funds to record and market their upcoming projects. Simultaneously, you are securing a stake in their future financial success.\\n\\nEach NFT costs .05 ETH (\\\\~$215) to mint and entitles the owner to 1% of subsequent streaming royalty collection on Forester’s song *Spark* for the next 5 years. The royalties will accrue in the time-locked vault for the next 5 years, as the NFTs increase in value and have the opportunity to trade hands. At the end of the vault period, the NFT addresses will receive their share of the royalty revenues in the vault.\\n\\nAs Forester collects royalties from *Spark*, you do too! The mint price of our NFTs is strategically informed by artists' historical streaming data. As a result, there is potential for significant financial upside. Get out there and support Decent artists by marketing on their behalf to boost your returns!\\n\\nAs we onboard more artists you as a fan will have the opportunity to grow your collection of royalty-backed NFTs, effectively starting your own record label and helping your favorite artists grow. Who knows, you might just own a piece of their next hit!\\n\\n## Price Tracking & Transparency\\n\\nWe analyzed current and projected streaming data from Forester to inform the mint price. Our models indicate 0.05 ETH represents an attractive cost basis for investment. For this release, we are helping the artist set the base price of the NFTs, but in the future, price discovery will be the sole responsibility of the artist and their fans.\\n\\n**Disclaimer, this is not financial advice.** That said, Forester is emerging as a heavy hitter on the scene. They are slated to release their second album on Sony’s Palm Tree Records in the coming months, as well as perform at Ultra Music Festival in Miami in March. Forester has an exciting growth profile and are looking for fans and members of their community to help them keep moving forward.\\n\\nTo help inform price discovery for secondary trades of Forester’s NFTs and future mints, we will be releasing a dashboard for the holders and secondary buyers to see the value of the accrued royalties in real time.\\n\\n## How to Get Access\\n\\nThe link to our Beta platform, as well as the password to access will be released to our Discord at 5pm PST today. At 5 pm PST tomorrow the minting page will go live. The first 19 people to mint an NFT will be holders of the Forester Spark Genesis NFT Collection.\\n\\nAccess to our Beta platform and first release is being given to members of the Discord because one of the core tenets of Decent is that the supporting fans will be active participants in the artist's journey. We want to optimize for sustained growth and active engagement, not just an initial cash grab and passive holding.\\n\\nWe are password protecting our initial drops for the benefit of Decent artists: our community members will receive access, and we trust them to be effective stewards of our artists’ brands.\\n\\n## Perks of the Spark Community\\n\\nOn top of the royalty revenues, holders will have access to a private community with Forester, as well as each other. Each NFT minter will receive a Forester hoodie. Future airdrops will reward first movers, as well.\\n\\nEarly movers, bidders, Discord community members, etc. will also be invited to participate in town halls, ideation, and development sessions around our product as we continue to build and shape the best platform for artists and fans alike.\\n\\nThe future of artist funding and support starts tomorrow! Together, we will put artists and fans on the same team.\",\"timestamp\":1638997875,\"title\":\"Spark Release: Decent Genesis Mint\"},\"digest\":\"IhnKq3nPCI8eVKVdlXQcFactNXd9n0WS_SZovcuCJec\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x673Fc290d919684A1B1E46AA69152f7b56FBADD8\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"p7bE_u8rNRw7qLWU3jRCZoYE_v1zdvOCBY9DjJ-OQAA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8hDKT4u9T6YOEO7baK7zy6nKcUSfC5NKoH9B-GjHni0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"_jv992l8wn-caQGnshcFHwUtLgf9vv6fWk4LCiA6UqIEPqhGzh-KsMHrb8Jrodlncs-OfzzlLoxgJofQMjKWcw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x7e2ae70e81e76f66c794346b404f7399bdd2ff85f316f104ffe028b5ae7fa801702c1b0017463cb24d500ed0293bc453586080690399a57146930109a90319761b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"p7bE_u8rNRw7qLWU3jRCZoYE_v1zdvOCBY9DjJ-OQAA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8hDKT4u9T6YOEO7baK7zy6nKcUSfC5NKoH9B-GjHni0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"dyb2GIpTolQiJxT8i5ZkY4b5AuFBZgJux7S0HCdBal8\"}"
