AWS offers servers, storage, networking, remote computing, email, mobile development and security for websites.\\n\\ndYdX [issued](https://twitter.com/dydxprotocol/status/1468408322315464706) an update via Twitter on Wednesday, acknowledging that its reliance on a centralized web service like AWS is problematic. It pledged to improve the true decentralization of its operations but did not state how.\\n\\n> “Unfortunately, there are still some parts of the exchange that rely on centralized services (AWS in this case). We are deeply committed to fully decentralizing and this remains one of our top priorities as we continue to iterate on the protocol.”\\n\\nCentralized exchanges (CEX) Binance.US and Coinbase also [saw](https://twitter.com/BinanceUS/status/1468302153823490048) service [outages](https://twitter.com/CoinbaseSupport/status/1331679494378164224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1331679494378164224%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F49639%2Fcoinbase-suffers-issues-due-to-aws-outage) due to the AWS issue.\\n\\ndYdX is the eleventh biggest DeFi app on the Ethereum network, [according](https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/ethereum/category/defi) to Dappradar. It does about $1.5 billion in daily trading volume. [As a decentralized exchange (DEX)](https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-exchange-aggregator-trading-volumes-surge-to-new-highs), it doesn't have a [know-your-customer (KYC) protocol](https://cointelegraph.com/news/cz-reveals-how-many-users-left-binance-after-mandatory-kyc) and settles all transactions via smart contracts.\\n\\nUpdates on the dYdX status portal showed that while trying to remedy the problem, the team was unable to access key elements of its back end due to the outage. The status from 9:20 pm UTC read:\\n\\n> “We are looking into whether we can just have all of those orders cancel, however the AWS outage is preventing us from currently being sure if that's possible.”\\n\\n***Related: [DeFi TVL hits new highs while Metaverse tokens show signs of exhaustion](https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-tvl-hits-new-highs-while-metaverse-tokens-show-signs-of-exhaustion)***\\n\\nDYDX token is down about 10% over the past 24 hours, trading at $8.63, [according](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dydx) to Coingecko.\",\"timestamp\":1639482548,\"title\":\"AWS outage hits dYdX, raising concerns over its decentralization\"},\"digest\":\"0P-YXSneKks_kS1-PjeQrrUa8G-cQs-ATxwd1gwyItg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xf38235F3aDc36bFA2F3C9C639067026e68c8F7f7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ke7GkK_mbXvXj_xAD3rd3jct8eFQBxwXek_JZMREl54\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"7sQe_No968M76v1nNItKY4fLfSgieby0a1zb30VYQPc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"NlP6e4_wihjH-wn8odZqIWMvhIVOjYjKAg0sRJbg7QynlhO3G96pvDSDyWLbDb4Bw29BSMf0O2N_g35OaVqlkw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xfd6ae65b43e89aac3bfbdb42cb1d71fc9c20ffa6812fbf2f9e9ef19c61e31a9d08e2e66fb12cb9237926f446a2f5e95c1ad4b402560aa6487d44b0c4d30dacb91b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ke7GkK_mbXvXj_xAD3rd3jct8eFQBxwXek_JZMREl54\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"7sQe_No968M76v1nNItKY4fLfSgieby0a1zb30VYQPc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"0P-YXSneKks_kS1-PjeQrrUa8G-cQs-ATxwd1gwyItg\"}"
