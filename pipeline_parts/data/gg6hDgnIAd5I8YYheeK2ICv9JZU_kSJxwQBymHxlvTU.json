It also brought treasures. Even if some were small, they were invaluable to this adventurous soul.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WKpPsWMivUZPww1pHxN8F.jpg?height=853&width=1706)\\n\\nÂ It was one day, though, while exploring through the space, there was one planet Triathon with the least habitable surface of its crusted earth and sand, the sun beating down on the planet's surface, raising its exterior temperature to uncomfortable heights. The traveler landed on this newly discovered planet as though a new adventure had begun. A distant laconic voice guided the traveler, like a siren's song in the sailor's ears.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vg8N4ieVe-jiSRmpnV4fF.jpg?height=3124&width=7334)\\n\\nSuddenly, as the planet's three moons rose above the horizon, the traveler started looking for shelter in a not-so-distant cave. The light and reflection against the cave walls grew stronger with every step closer. Strong enough to the point where it could blind any onlooker. The traveler raised his hands to his face, attempting to block out the light as he treaded carefully along the cavern. It was strange, though. The light seemed to be growing weaker now with every step forward.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tUglS69l9e0sJV-qAGpwC.jpg?height=2800&width=7000)\\n\\nHe questioned whether he had gone too far, considering that wasn't the truth he trudged on, the light now bearable against the visor of his suit. As soon as he lowered his hands, he saw, what lay before him, a box, a strange artifact box with glowing, bright teal markings of unknown origin.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VMUFvh-slsJUR_C2FZg0j.png?height=1281&width=1317)\\n\\nTravelers foggy visor could only show much of precious loots and NFTs lying in the box, and his journey had just started to bear fruit. The box had called upon other travelers upon the universe. Pioneers who ventured into the unknown had won the unimaginable and inestimable riches of the **Triathon Mystery Box**. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \",\"timestamp\":1641464566,\"title\":\"Travelers Journal: Mysterious Object Detected in Triathon\"},\"digest\":\"ZrJt6ECep7vt9WhyKTcQMSoo_JS6-kpM5cHeFbdxpIc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x269dE22D6D42e7b2f54A49C68AE04f20253dD1e3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NMWLmPtLu1cEqv-kRN2xlEOV6hCtxisKvi0V0NH-kpw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2KFIhDFUZ2LuwPssmvig5RkVyPJlQU-XSKAzNjBefFM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"thnuvQ81wP9hfPo6wgkzNfLQroqhQxX7y_-8J9UxfhM-RWWn0jorHpn7GRMvghwEpXqIf4KMfw-kl51BjY8hAg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5923acd7d53ade436c4cbd52f711e541662ea45c1f04b8981b0523bfd3d58f176f9bd4ab6736baf8c4be2b818f0e88d8df137dda3f8cea7dd95026a576ea85451c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NMWLmPtLu1cEqv-kRN2xlEOV6hCtxisKvi0V0NH-kpw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2KFIhDFUZ2LuwPssmvig5RkVyPJlQU-XSKAzNjBefFM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"8KEOnYcIe2jXdM8uZMPa8csw8ZInEumzcvZAhOIXPkg\"}"
