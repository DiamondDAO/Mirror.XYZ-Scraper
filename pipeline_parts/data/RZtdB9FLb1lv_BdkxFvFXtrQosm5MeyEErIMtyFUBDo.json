And recent trends have further enforced that NFTs are a mainstay. So what comes next? Curators. Collectors. Community. Meet SZNS: an NFT platform to bring all these actors together.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*I remember reaching out to [John](https://twitter.com/jl2fa) after hearing him present SZNS. What struck me about John was his desire to make NFTs accessible to *everyone*. \\\\*\\\\*So for example, someone who appreciate art and is a great curator can use SZNS to tokenize a collection of NFTs.\\n\\nThe SZNS platform makes it easy and accessible for collectors to consume, collect, trade, and participate in owning an album of NFTs that are created by curators. So rather than purchasing individual NFTs or investing in a single (even fractionalized) NFT, collectors can now gain exposure to a specific creator or curator’s collection. Now, where this gets even more interesting is when these albums can function as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).\\n\\n## **SZNS differentiates itself from other fractionalization tools out there by allowing fractional owners to engage in governance to collectively *use* the fractionalized NFT.**\\n\\nAs NFTs unlock increasing utility over time as a whole, SZNS hopes to enable meaningful shared ownership of high-value NFTs.\\n\\nFor example, the **DivineDAO** – which is a large new collective focused on world-building around Divine Loot NFTs (which are arguably one of the rarest parts) – is launching their DAO on SZNS. This lets the DivineDAO team focus on building their community and their product, instead of worrying about the technical implementation of their stack. \\n\\n[https://twitter.com/jl2fa/status/1448739084499816448?s=20](https://twitter.com/jl2fa/status/1448739084499816448?s=20)\\n\\n[John ](https://twitter.com/jl2fa)and team are building the infrastructure to support NFTs and make it accessible for all participants in the ecosystem. We at Pear VC, along with Dragonfly, Framework, DeFi Alliance, LongHash and Cypher, are proud to back the SZNS team as they execute on their grand vision.\\n\\nYou can follow the SZNS team’s journey here on Twitter, Discord and on their website: [https://szns.io](https://szns.io/).\\n\\n## **It’s NFT x DAO SZN.**\\n\\n*If you are building pick-and-shovel to support NFTs or NFT infrastructure, we would love to hear from you. You know how to find me.*\",\"timestamp\":1634323901,\"title\":\"SZNS x Pear\"},\"digest\":\"jMwsnirFBWs_s-Mvt-iOxaU0oyq8FLr0lTM3EN0trSQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x45aF1D1D2857e3c2e6A4769A33B9792aeAFa87b5\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"pzb878ea9kP6eQ0EByJrYYNgrd2qpp8Px65wjapzXdE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eXBX8u75lgDGyQgDLJl7LKv_Eic_hginfnaeefbmmMc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"kWXoAJ2HM7ooS_JB_cj_3goX9YM6EVEZiBc4QrHqgSWFSOUhyYx9hEcxLMMUzluHb9HnV7AEuPB2llduIKlmcg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x419197a26c251b6e08dbafb2560aa55a377f193c1f8f7517ea5864379c1ba00c44961efc4242fab4b58444fc3757afd52109e659224082e28ff1f1dffa2a6a551b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"pzb878ea9kP6eQ0EByJrYYNgrd2qpp8Px65wjapzXdE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eXBX8u75lgDGyQgDLJl7LKv_Eic_hginfnaeefbmmMc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"LH88LHulISsv086oG9aTPfPKT85lf70uJYAefXu-uMk\"}"
