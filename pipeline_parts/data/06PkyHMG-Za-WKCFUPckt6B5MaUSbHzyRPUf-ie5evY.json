"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"There are many advantages for a student to have a part-time job. For instance, it helps him to realize that no success comes from nothing. It enables him to be independent and builds up his self-confidence. Therefore, part-time jobs can get the students out of the ivory tower and give them the opportunity to know more of himself and of his personal value in society. \\n \\n\\nAs everything has two sides, the disadvantages can’t be ignored. First, part-time jobs shorten students’ study time. Second, some even become so preoccupied with making money that they can’t focus their attention on studying. In the end, the students may fall behind or fail in their studies.\\n\\nPersonally, I believe students can choose to take up a job according to their own situation. The most important thing is for him to keep a good balance, put his study on top of the list and assign an adequate amount of time to it.   \",\"timestamp\":1641008491,\"title\":\"Students’ Part-time Jobs\"},\"digest\":\"FuqIZcEBIH8NN7-4gVc4_Bd9WQ4cQ5x7VApUNf3ncCc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x833A72065EFb5043D80E711E9745872aec92Edc3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nIVRlFStmOm6nq1Zw17Hm9oBKixbftJvacKaeUn9QO0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"oP3zeG6hsOaysOYNKfYoiyd-j8pRQnW9krwuLrz326g\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"3CiKp0SD0h6aTGqyaaV6HFP1SkZvp93nDxDP2vVK_OIvC7sQE8YS6QLFkpDuKAhrw3yKzDvb16gsMjx0_Uvryg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd0141e4ce326865c178b6c19537d539cd9550e0a5015fc8ad963bbae5db929f11bebe5d96ab0095f5d0846e05846ea960200a88a34a8a6eaae6eb3ebdfc4efae1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nIVRlFStmOm6nq1Zw17Hm9oBKixbftJvacKaeUn9QO0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"oP3zeG6hsOaysOYNKfYoiyd-j8pRQnW9krwuLrz326g\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"FuqIZcEBIH8NN7-4gVc4_Bd9WQ4cQ5x7VApUNf3ncCc\"}"
