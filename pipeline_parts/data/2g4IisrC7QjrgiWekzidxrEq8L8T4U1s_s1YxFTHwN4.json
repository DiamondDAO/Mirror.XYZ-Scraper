Freedom from constraints that limit our ability to think big. Freedom through economic security to pursue the life we want for ourselves.\\n\\nWhen we look at the world around us, we see many complex systems, economic, social, and political, that all, intentionally or not, hinder our ability to be free.\\n\\nThose are the ones we wish to change with the products we launch and the organization we build.\\n\\n# How\\n\\nHousing is such a fundamental building block upon which we build the rest of our lives. Yet the systems around housing are some of the most antiquated and maladapted to the new modern life enabled by the internet.\\n\\nMost of us are likely stuck in 12-month leases. With vacations that we take, we often end up paying double rent. Nomadic life can be filled with financially exhaustive short-term rentals. Spending more time than a short-term rental is impossible to do without subletting our apartment and finding storage for our personal belongings.\\n\\nOur housing traps us in a false duality of living vs. working with the inability to deeply marry the two.\\n\\nOur first product is going to be taking the most lightweight unit of housing, the lease, and bringing that into the web3 digital world to adapt it to the lifestyle that we all want to live. We’re going to decompose the lease for you such that you have total freedom in how you want it to be used.\\n\\n# What\\n\\nWe are onboarding users into our lease tokenization beta program. As a part of this program, you will be able to upload your lease details and receive an NFT for each month remaining in your lease.\\n\\nSuch NFTs have a variety of use cases:\\n\\n* Swap NFTs to do an apartment trade.\\n* Immediately list certain months up for sale.\\n* See how much people are willing to bid on your apartment for that month.\\n* Allow third parties to compose your NFTs into longer stays they can offer to others.\\n\\nThis is just the initial exploration of this design space. We imagine that as these NFTs become able to interact with other NFTs, DeFi, and other Web3 initiatives, the things we can do with them will be limitless.\\n\\nAdditionally, as a part of our beta launch, we will be giving 1.5% of our token supply to those listing their units and completing stays.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pR4eiEFIEIhD6u9nYwzAl.png?height=454&width=1274)\\n\\nWe will be continuing this program for the first 1000 months onboarded on our platform and for the first 100 cumulative stays on our platform. We will strive to make sure all the leases onboarded onto our platform are real and may ask for further proof if we have any evidence for foul play.\\n\\nStaying true to Web3 principles, we want to make sure our early users hold ownership in the value that they help create on our platform. Our early users are incredibly valuable in helping us bootstrap and improve our platforms and we want that to be clear in the tokens we distribute back to them.\\n\\nTo sign up for our beta, please fill out the Typeform [here](https://tbaly87lzfi.typeform.com/to/hGrXZRwD) and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/je5JBcTpQd)! Learn more on our [website](https://holon.casa/).\\n\\n# Future\\n\\nThis beta program is the first step in our mission to digitize all property. As a follow-up to this beta, we will soon be releasing a full-stack marketplace that helps renters mint their lease NFTs and travelers find destinations.\\n\\nWe are working with a bottoms-up strategy by first providing utility to renters, and slowly working our way up to the homeowner by bringing the value of Web3 through unique tooling for them.\\n\\nWith the digitizing of property, not only do we expect to make it more flexible, and thus adaptable to our modern lifestyle, but also much more accessible. Housing is so fundamental to our quality of life, and yet it is becoming increasingly less affordable.\\n\\nHousing is operating on 70-year-old infrastructure that significantly limits the number of new economic innovations that can be built, and as a result, suffers from stagnation. By digitizing property, we upgrade the underlying infrastructure and create the opportunity for us to redefine home ownership at an incredibly fundamental level.\\n\\nTokenized leases are the first step, but the future is making housing a human right! \\n  \\n \",\"timestamp\":1637774012,\"title\":\"Introducing: Lease Tokenization\"},\"digest\":\"DGfoqGbRv-bBRHarisnrmNCamfUs_parz1aPfhPadic\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xF1e10f4360A521E77EFdEbE35C279Fe170AAfa61\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZGktCXl3SnK7cyzO843XTmtecNu9UoFTfi7MmMItBdQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"R4eaNH0bQyNu3Jqx3hQeEe13cK6A8hjfvV2MyoBd75s\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"t1m1aDt27J9lXQdwhHpgwtycSfMZe_fZV31CpXscaNPFUnYFXEOvbgGWeD13LMJ77pUsv_IHOoqAlvLOWKedAw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x613d60c54488da9b5cee0b35f6cfb6fb624ddb12dfac06cf72dccc6f268e646d757463c9f97b79e347a99c1e16329df6f4c1bbec554c90c925dff3824ba404d51b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZGktCXl3SnK7cyzO843XTmtecNu9UoFTfi7MmMItBdQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"R4eaNH0bQyNu3Jqx3hQeEe13cK6A8hjfvV2MyoBd75s\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"DGfoqGbRv-bBRHarisnrmNCamfUs_parz1aPfhPadic\"}"
