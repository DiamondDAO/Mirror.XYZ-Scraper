"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"While Ethereum developers are fixing bugs, the prize for the first running PoS consensus may well be grabbed by their competitors.\\n\\nThere are several large projects inching closer to the finish line — [EOS](https://cointelegraph.com/eos-price-index), Harmony (ONE), Zilliqa (ZIL), Tezos ([XTZ](https://cointelegraph.com/xtz-price-index)), Cosmos ([ATOM](https://cointelegraph.com/cosmos-price-index)), Algorand (ALGO) and Qtum (QTUM) — all with viable and operational products either working on pure PoS or delegated PoS.\\n\\n***Related: [All in on PoS Blockchains: An Overview of Crypto-Staking Networks](https://cointelegraph.com/news/all-in-on-pos-blockchains-an-overview-of-crypto-staking-networks)***\\n\\nThe successfully operating networks launched by these projects demonstrate their ability to achieve in one year what takes years for Ethereum. For example, Silicon Valley’s Harmony has recently launched its staking, becoming the first sharded PoS blockchain that managed to implement two technologies simultaneously. Notably, these technologies are yet to be implemented on the main network by the Ethereum developers.\\n\\nOn May 19, the Harmony team [reported that it had upgraded its mainnet](https://cointelegraph.com/news/harmony-blockchain-mainnet-now-supports-staking-along-with-sharding), which is currently supporting hundreds of nodes in multiple shards. The developers claim that they managed to outstrip Ethereum not only in terms of sharding and staking but also by way of network performance, reaching a transaction processing fee of $0.000001 on the mainnet and 118,000 transactions per second in testnet. \\n\\nHowever, with new solutions rapidly emerging in the blockchain market, Ethereum still remains the pioneer and the main contributor to the development of sharding and staking technologies. Given the hundreds of thousands of transactions made on the network every day, the postponement of an upgrade as significant as Ethereum 2.0 — aimed at making blockchain use smooth and secure — may merely be the lesser evil.\",\"timestamp\":1639035479,\"title\":\"Competitors winning the race\"},\"digest\":\"vaq3u68zl1YLh6-r5Qne0KgCeuAP5GeiN8r4N7GcfcQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9E1eD0a565710397B9d0Fb0716dCBe1eC41fdbD8\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"asy-zcQvgN0cJLMxowtbM4LMgZXODdDCEkaL1RjpDOU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mdLxHFn7OH7SBvCz14LlvPuk-muQb8S5LSrou0ogAx0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"GB9gfFexVIB-KL7VzjJNWkC2RJSV1w5-0I08E6j5YuGD4rqHOmpbrIuHdICgH72klEeMR4B7BqHezrnETgsAwQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd42bfa31586071b855020eee8b2b467cbdb1c1f0f118b44ac3935178c9531cc6635d20aed89ab8714a5d9c916f0dfccb3a134661a72182d5527a7d5ce10978ca1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"asy-zcQvgN0cJLMxowtbM4LMgZXODdDCEkaL1RjpDOU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mdLxHFn7OH7SBvCz14LlvPuk-muQb8S5LSrou0ogAx0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"vaq3u68zl1YLh6-r5Qne0KgCeuAP5GeiN8r4N7GcfcQ\"}"
