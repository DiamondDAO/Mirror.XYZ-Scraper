"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"ABG is postponing its planned initial public offering thanks to a couple of new deep-pocketed partners.\\n\\nThe New York-based brand marketer said CVC Capital and HPS Investment Partners, along with its current stable of shareholders, have signed definitive agreements to purchase significant equity stakes in the company in a transaction that values it at $12.6 billion in enterprise value.\\n\\nBlackRock, which has been ABG’s largest shareholder since 2019, will retain its majority position. Simon Property Group, General Atlantic, Leonard Green & Partners, GIC Private Ltd., Brookfield Property Partners, Lion Capital, Jasper Ridge Partners and Shaquille O’Neal will continue to hold significant equity positions in the company.\\n\\nAs a result, “we’ll be pushing the IPO to sometime in 2023 or 2024,” said Jamie Salter, founder and chief executive officer. ”This is a significant investment that has turned over our shareholder base — 50 percent is new money and 50 percent is old money that rolled over.”\\n\\nHe said he remains the largest individual shareholder in the company, but the private equity firms have bigger stakes. All told, ABG’s management team retains around a 20 percent interest.\\n\\n”The investors are taking money off the table,” he said, “which is normal for a private equity firm. They can either do it this way or through an IPO.”\\n\\nAccording to Salter, even though the IPO is being delayed, the company’s goals have not changed. “We pursued an IPO so that we could bring value to ABG and its shareholders. We are achieving exactly that with the onboarding of new equity partners.”\",\"timestamp\":1637570929,\"title\":\"ABG Sells Equity Stake, Delays IPO\"},\"digest\":\"CSJA9o7OGZAFFQVcsQkmnh_JIzPK-UYJN2sh1wzjGAo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xE2994b2aD035CB61e20d0B8a19db836D360752ae\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"X2X4AuELNo9bE6PUn1s890XqgHoJno9putIVtC9C4QU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"PV_J4VA-HlbP1vvjQZVnYARFEM3PVjB0m2ptze22n3U\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"5sG0k1nZjJTeuGE7nOvPUHpaEMQoJsvRvXSX0tMOZ1NtKqIbz4F6Qz7QOOmeJKjTkXV14Z-LFPbC9Tdom2N67Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5f609a6e17d2eca62813ef0cfac492eb4ea163c50f412e79c3469947f3dd24794a93118fd2afba8b71089bc98098bff5f315575773d4580d6913c663e43553441b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"X2X4AuELNo9bE6PUn1s890XqgHoJno9putIVtC9C4QU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"PV_J4VA-HlbP1vvjQZVnYARFEM3PVjB0m2ptze22n3U\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"CSJA9o7OGZAFFQVcsQkmnh_JIzPK-UYJN2sh1wzjGAo\"}"
