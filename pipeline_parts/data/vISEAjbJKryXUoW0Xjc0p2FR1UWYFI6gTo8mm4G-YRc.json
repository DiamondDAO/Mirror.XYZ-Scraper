"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"As more people around the United States test positive for COVID-19, leaders of healthcare organizations and hospitals are permitting workers to stay on the job even with a **positive** test.\\n\\nAround the country, nurses and other healthcare workers are still coming to work if they have the virus.\\n\\nIn the U.S., about 700,000 people each day are testing positive for the virus. This is partly due to the spread of the Omicron **variant** of COVID-19.\\n\\nThere is a daily average of about 110,000 Americans in the hospital with COVID-19. One year ago, when infections were at their highest, there were 124,000 people per day in the hospital because of the virus.\\n\\nThe rise in cases comes at the same time many hospital workers are home because they are sick or tested positive.\\n\\nIn December, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said healthcare workers who have no **symptoms** after seven days can return to work. They must also have a negative test. However, the time can be reduced if hospitals need more workers.\\n\\nIn Phoenix, Arizona, a large company that runs hospitals said workers could ask to come back to work if they feel well.\\n\\nThe company said: \\\"We are doing everything we can to **ensure** our employees can safely return to work.\\\"\\n\\nIn California, hospital staff members can come to work if they do not have symptoms. The state's public health department said workers who test positive can be permitted to work with patients who also test positive. The workers must wear face coverings that offer extra protection.\\n\\nJan Emerson-Shea is a spokeswoman for the California Hospital Association. She said hospitals may or may not put the new rules in place. She added that they are likely to have more patients than they can care for in coming days.\\n\\nA nurses group in California recently said it did not think the state's idea was a good one. It would lead to more people getting sick, the group said.\\n\\nIn Miami, Florida, workers who test positive at Jackson Memorial Hospital are staying away for five days. The chief medical officer is Dr. Hany Atallah. He said \\\"we still have to be very careful to prevent spread in the hospital.\\\"\\n\\nLast week, France said healthcare workers could continue working with mild symptoms.\\n\\nI'm Dan Friedell.\\n\\n*Dan Friedell adapted this story for Learning English based on a report by the Associated Press.*\\n\\n*Are people with positive virus tests permitted to come to work where you live?
