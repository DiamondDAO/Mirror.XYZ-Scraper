"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The Web3 vacuum seems to be increasing in force with each passing week. The most transformative innovations, conversations and humans are being sucked into the vortex with little likelihood of return.\\n\\nIt’s a wonderful thing to witness, a wonderful time to be alive.\\n\\nThe more talented, creative, inspiring humans we can bring into this new paradigm of work, the better.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, everyone’s talking about onboarding.\\n\\n![twitter.com/chaserchapman](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vDsYn0MaScyahIWkstUHv.png?height=860&width=1470)\\n\\n![twitter.com/cdixon](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Y6PreiUnxzVDpDURSXfzH.png?height=652&width=1476)\\n\\n![twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fD4ojWgjEdbxp0sYvdXRo.png?height=792&width=1480)\\n\\nI’m [Beeradley](https://twitter.com/bradwmorris), I spend most of my time working with the wonderful folks over at[ Index Coop](https://www.indexcoop.com/). We’re especially interested in learning *how to build better onboarding experiences for new joiners - aspiring core contributors.*\\n\\nInspired by a few key events..\\n\\n* The [GitCoin](https://gitcoin.co/mission) and [Bankless](https://banklesshq.com/) in their [DAO Frontier Report](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-ultimate-dao-report)\\n* [Forefront’s](https://forefront.market/) progressive culture guild and onboarding approach\\n* Conversations between [Chase Chapman](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman), [Li Jin](https://twitter.com/ljin18), [Jes Sloss](https://twitter.com/thattallguy), [Alex Zhang](https://twitter.com/alexxzzhang), [Rafa](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder) and [Cooper Turley](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa)\\n\\n..myself and [Mitz](https://twitter.com/0xMitzy) embarked on a mission to connect the borderless DAO onboarding tribe.\\n\\nTurns out a vast range of incredibly talented humans and teams, from every corner of the DAOverse are on a very similar mission.\\n\\nWhile each DAO has its own unique vision, products, people and pockets of culture, we’re all here to make the Web3 transition as efficient and frictionless as possible.\\n\\nNot an easy task.\\n\\nWe’re quickly learning that joining a DAO is almost nothing like finding or commencing a traditional job. Because of this, effective Web3 onboarding system and infrastructure design requires a vastly different mental model.\\n\\nFriends, we should be tackling this challenge together.\\n\\n![This ones for you Jim: twitter.com/0xJim](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-dSNC3fddXjJSJa2-OzH2.jpg?height=608&width=1184)\\n\\n### We’d like to introduce you to the DAOlliance\\n\\nThe DAOlliance is a collaboration container for those who’ve undertaken the goliath task of onboarding the next wave of workers into Web3. A space to collectively define the common challenges and pool resources to help each other build the best possible Web3 onramps, together.\\n\\nOver the coming weeks and months, we’re going to open source our findings as we workshop a number of common onboarding challenges, and collaborate to design and implement solutions to address these challenges.\\n\\nHere’s a preview of some of the initial workshops:\\n\\n* *What are the key challenges when onboarding new joiners into Web3/DAO’s?*\\n* *How do we measure onboarding success/effectiveness?*\\n* *Which tools do we use to enhance the onboarding experience?*\\n* *How do we reduce time and friction between initial joining & meaningful contribution?*\\n* *How do we teach the soft skills required for effective DAO communication and collaboration?*\\n\\nWe’re also looking to kickstart a collaborative, hands-on ***How to DAO*** style onboarding program before the end of the year. We want to equip new joiners with *[wayfinding](https://creators.mirror.xyz/ggSQQlTSGqJ2_U7HVNjm4f3s98on5EfUyR9rW_z3fw0)* skills, empowering them to be their best selves, find the tribes that they vibe with, and build their journeys in this Web3 ecosystem.\\n\\nThis is a positive sum game. Strong alliances between DAO's will be exponentially beneficial for everyone involved.\\n\\nThe findings from our workshops will be posted on Mirror. We hope they’ll act as a blueprint for any other DAO(s) or Web3 projects looking to build more efficient onboarding experiences.\\n\\nMassive gratitude to [Mitz](https://twitter.com/0xMitzy), [QZ](https://twitter.com/f_shbiscuit), [Louisa](https://twitter.com/louisaraj88) and ET, who are helping co-create this DAOlliance content.
