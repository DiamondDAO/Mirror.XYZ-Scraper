"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"running in from the darkness. Vere was laughing, and looked more joyous than before.\\n\\n\\\"Such a storm, Madre! The sea is a mass of foam. It's glorious! Hark at the fishermen!\\\"\\n\\nFrom the blackness below rose hoarse shouts and prolonged calls--some near, some far. Faintly with them mingled the quavering and throaty voice of the blind man, now raised in \\\"Santa Lucia.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What are we going to do, Monsieur Emile?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We must get home at once before it gets worse,\\\" said Hermione. \\\"Marchese, I am so sorry, but I am afraid we must ask for the launch.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, madame, it is only a squall. By midnight it will be all over. I promise you. I am a Neapolitan.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, but you promised that there would be no storm at all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sa-a-nta-a Lu-u-ci-i-a! Santa Lu-cia!\\\"\\n\\nThe blind man sounded like one in agony. The thunder crashed again just above him, as if it desired to beat down his sickly voice.\\n\\nArtois felt a sharp stab of neuralgia over his eyes.\\n\\nBehind, in the restaurant, the waiters were running over the pavement to shut the great windows. The rush of the rain made a noise like quantities of silk rustling.\\n\\nThe Marchesino laughed, quite unabashed. His cheeks were slightly flushed and his eyes shone.\\n\\n\\\"Could I tell the truth, Signora? You might have refused to come. But now I speak the solemn truth. By midnight--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm afraid we really can't stay so late as that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But there is a piano. I will play valses. I will sing.\\\" He looked ardently at Vere, who was eagerly watching the sea from the window.\\n\\n\\\"And we will dance, the Signorina and I.\\\"\\n\\nArtois made a brusque movement towards the terrace, muttering something about the launch. A glare of lightning lit up the shore immediately below the terrace, showing him the launch buffeted by the waves that were now breaking over the sandy beach. There came a summoning call from the sailors.\\n\\n\\\"If you do stay,\\\" Artois said to the Marchesino, turning back to them, \\\"you must send the launch round to Mergellina. I don't believe it can stop here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, but there are rocks, Caro Emilio. It is protected!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not enough.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Signora,\\\" said Gaspare, \\\"we had better go. It will only get worse. The sea is not too bad yet.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come along!\\\" Hermione cried, with decision. \\\"Come, Vere! I'm very sorry, Marchese, but we must really get back at once. Good-night, Emile! Gaspare give me your arm.\\\"\\n\\nAnd she set off at once, clinging to Gaspare, who held an open umbrella over her.\\n\\n\\\"Good-night, Vere!\\\" said Artois.\\n\\nThe girl was looking at him with surprised eyes.\\n\\n\\\"You are going--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I shall take the tram.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh--of course. That is your quickest way.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Signorina--the umbrella!\\\"\\n\\nThe Marchesino was offering his arm to conduct Vere to the launch. He cast a challenging look of triumph at Artois.\\n\\n\\\"I would come in the launch,\\\" Artois said hastily. \\\"But-- Good-night!\\\"\\n\\nHe turned away.\\n\\n\\\"A rivederci, Emilio!\\\" called the Marchesino.\\n\\n\\\"--derci!\\\"\\n\\nThe last syllables only came back to them through the wind and the rain.\\n\\n\\\"Take my arm, Signorina.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Grazie, it is all right like this.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ma--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am quite covered, really, thank you.\\\"\\n\\nShe hurried on, smiling, but not taking his arm. She knew how to be obstinate.\\n\\n\\\"Ma Signorina--mais Mademoiselle--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Gaspare! Is Madre all safe in the launch?\\\"\\n\\nVere glided from under the Marchesino's umbrella and sought the shade of Gaspare's. Behind, the Marchesino was murmuring to himself Neapolitan street expressions.\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signorina.\\\"\\n\\nGaspare's face had suddenly lighted up. His Padroncina's little hand was holding tightly to his strong arm.\\n\\n\\\"Take care, Signorina. That is water!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I was nearly in. I thought--\\\"\\n\\nHe almost lifted her into the launch, which was rising and falling on the waves.\\n\\n\\\"Madre! What a night!\\\"\\n\\nVere sank down on the narrow seat of the little cabin. The Marchesino jumped aboard. The machine in the stern throbbed. They rushed forward into the blackness of the impenetrable night, the white of the leaping foam, the hissing of the rain, the roaring of the wind. In a blurred and hasty vision the lights of Frisio's ran before them, fell back into the storm like things defeated. Hermione fancied she discerned for a second the blind man's scarlet face and open mouth, the Padrone at a window waving a frantic adieu, having only just become aware of their departure. But if it were so they were gone before she knew-- gone into mystery, with Emile and the world.\\n\\nThe Marchesino inserted himself reproachfully into the cabin. He had turned up the collar of his \\\"smoking,\\\" and drawn the silk lapels forward over his soft shirt-front. His white gloves were saturated. He came to sit down by Vere.\\n\\n\\\"Madame!\\\" he said reproachfully, \\\"we should have waited. The sea is too rough. Really, it is dangerous. And the Signorina and I--we could have danced together.\\\"\\n\\nHermione could not help laughing, though she did not feel gay.\\n\\n\\\"I should not have danced,\\\" said Vere. \\\"I could not. I should have had to watch the storm.\\\"\\n\\nShe was peering out of the cabin window at the wild foam that leaped up round the little craft and disappeared in the darkness. There was no sensation of fear in her heart, only a passion of interest and an odd feeling of triumph.\\n\\nTo dance with the Marchesino at the Scoglio di Frisio would have been banal in comparison with this glorious progress through the night in the teeth of opposing elements. She envied Gaspare, who was outside with the sailors, and whose form she could dimly see, a blur against the blackness. She longed to take off her smart little hat and her French frock, and be outside too, in the wind and the rain.\\n\\n\\\"It is ridiculous to be dressed like this!\\\" she said, quickly, taking off the glove she had put on her left hand. \\\"You poor Marchese!\\\"\\n\\nShe looked at his damp \\\"smoking,\\\" his soaking gloves and deplorable expression, and could not repress a little rush of laughter.\\n\\n\\\"Do forgive me! Madre, I know I'm behaving shamefully, but we are all so hopelessly inappropriate. Your diamond broach, Madre! And your hat is all on one side. Gaspare must have knocked it with the umbrella. I am sure we all look like hens in a shower!\\\"\\n\\nShe leaned back against the swaying side of the cabin and laughed till the tears were in her eyes. The sudden coming of the storm had increased the excitement that had been already within her, created by the incidents of the day.\\n\\n\\\"Vere!\\\" said her mother, but smiling through the protest.\\n\\nThe Marchesino showed his big white teeth. Everything that Vere did seemed to develop his admiration for her. He was delighted with this mood, and forgot his disappointment. But there was a glint of wonder in his eyes, and now he said:\\n\\n\\\"But the Signorina is not afraid! She does not cry out! She does not call upon the Madonna and the Saints! My mother, my sisters, if they were here--\\\"\\n\\nThe prow of the launch struck a wave which burst over the bows, scattering spray to the roof of the cabin.\\n\\n\\\"But I like it, I love it!\\\" said Vere. \\\"Don't you?--don't you, Madre?\\\"\\n\\nBefore Hermione could reply the Marchesino exclaimed:\\n\\n\\\"Signorina, in the breast of an angel you have the heart of a lion! The sea will never harm you. How could it? It will treat you as it treats the Saint of your pool, San Francesco. You know what the sailors and the fishermen say? In the wildest storms, when the sea crashes upon the rocks, never, never does it touch San Francesco. Never does it put out the lamp that burns at San Francesco's feet.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I have heard them say that,\\\" Vere said.\\n\\nSuddenly her face had become serious. The romance in the belief of the seamen had got hold of her, had touched her. The compliment to herself she ignored. Indeed, she had already forgotten it.\\n\\n\\\"Only the other night--\\\" she began.\\n\\nBut she stopped suddenly.\\n\\n\\\"You know,\\\" she said, changing to something else, \\\"that when the fishermen pass under San Francesco's pedestal they bend down, and lift a little water from the sea, and sprinkle it into the boat, and make the sign of the cross. They call it 'acqua benedetta.' I love to see them do that.\\\"\\n\\nAnother big wave struck the launch and made it shiver. The Marchesino crossed himself, but quite mechanically. He was intent on Vere.\\n\\n\\\"I wonder,\\\" the girl said, \\\"whether to-night San Francesco will not be beaten by the waves, whether his light will be burning when we reach the island.\\\"\\n\\nShe paused, then she added, in a lower voice:\\n\\n\\\"I do hope it will--don't you, Madre?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Vere,\\\" said her mother.\\n\\nSomething in her mother's voice made the girl look up at her swiftly, then put a hand into hers, a hand that was all sympathy. She felt that just then her mother's imagination was almost, or quite, one with hers. The lights of Naples were gone, swallowed by the blackness of the storm. And the tiny light at the feet of the Saint, of San Francesco, who protected the men of the sea, and the boys--Ruffo, too! --would it greet them, star of the sea to their pool, star of the sea to their island, their Casa del Mare, when they had battled through the storm to San Francesco's feet?\\n\\n\\\"I do hope it will.\\\"\\n\\nWhy did Hermione's heart echo Vere's words with such a strenuous and sudden passion, such a deep desire? She scarcely knew then. But she knew that she wanted a light to be shining for her when she neared home--longed for it, needed it specially that night. If San Francesco's lamp were burning quietly amid the fury of the sea in such a blackness as this about them--well, it would seem like an omen. She would take it as an omen of happiness.\\n\\nAnd if it were not burning?\\n\\nShe, too, longed to be outside with Gaspare and the sailors, staring into the darkness with eyes keen as those of a seaman, looking for the light. Since Vere's last words and her reply they had sat in silence. Even the Marchesino's vivacity was suddenly abated, either by the increasing violence of the storm or by the change in Vere. It would have been difficult to say by which. The lightning flashed. The thunder at moments seemed to split the sky asunder as a charge of gunpowder splits asunder a rock. The head wind rushed by, yet had never passed them, but was forever coming furiously to meet them. On the roof of the little cabin the rain made a noise that was no longer like the rustle of silk, but was like the crackle of musketry.\\n\\nThere was something oppressive, something even almost terrible, in being closely confined, shut in by low roof and narrow walls from such sweeping turbulence, such a clamor of wind and water and the sky.\\n\\nHermione looked at her diamond brooch, then at her cloak.\\n\\nSlowly she lifted her hand and began to button it.\\n\\nVere moved and began to button up hers. Hermione glanced at her, and saw a watchful, shining, half-humorous, half-passionate look in her eyes that could not be mistaken.\\n\\nShe dropped her hands.\\n\\n\\\"No, Vere!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Madre! Yes, yes, yes!\\\"\\n\\nThe Marchesino stared.\\n\\n\\\"No, I did not--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You did! You did, Madre! It's no use! I understood directly.\\\"\\n\\nShe began quickly to take off her hat.\\n\\n\\\"Marchese, we are going out.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Vere, this is absurd.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We are going outside, Marchese. Madre wants air.\\\"\\n\\nThe Marchesino, accustomed only to the habits and customs of Neapolitan women, looked frankly as if he thought Hermione mad.\\n\\n\\\"Poor Madre must have a breath of air.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will open the window, Signora!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And the rain all over her, and the thunder close above her, and the sea in her face, the sea--the sea!\\\"\\n\\nShe clapped her hands.\\n\\n\\\"Gaspare! Gaspare!\\\"\\n\\nShe put her face to the glass. Gaspare, who was standing up in the stern, with his hands holding fast to the rail that edged the cabin roof, bent down till his brown face was on a level with hers, and his big eyes were staring inquiringly into her eyes.\\n\\n\\\"We are coming out.\\\"\\n\\nOn the other side of the glass Gaspare made violently negative gestures. One word only came to those inside the cabin through the uproar of the elements.\\n\\n\\\"Impossible!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Signorina,\\\" said the Marchesino, \\\"you cannot mean it. But you will be washed off. And the water--you will be drowned. It cannot be.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marchese, look at Madre! If she stays inside another minute she will be ill. She is stifling! Quickly! Quickly!\\\"\\n\\nThe Marchesino, whose sense of humor was not of a kind to comprehend this freak of Vere's, was for once really taken aback. There were two sliding doors to the cabin, one opening into the bows of the launch, the other into the stern. He got up, looking very grave and rather confused, and opened the former. The wind rushed in, carrying with it spray from the sea. At the same moment there was a loud tapping on the glass behind them. Vere looked round. Gaspare was crouching down with his face against the pane. She put her ear to the glass by his mouth.\\n\\n\\\"Signorina, you must not go into the bows,\\\" he called. \\\"If you will come out, come here, and I will take care of you.\\\"\\n\\nHe knew Vere's love of the sea and understood her desire.\\n\\n\\\"Go, Vere,\\\" said Hermione.\\n\\nThe Marchesino shut the door and stood by it, bending and looking doubtful.\\n\\n\\\"I will stay here with the Marchese. I am really too old to face such a tempest, and the Marchese has no coat. He simply can't go.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, Signora, it does not matter! I am ready.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Impossible. Your clothes would be ruined. Go along, Vere! Turn up your collar.\\\"\\n\\nShe spoke almost as if to a boy, and like a gay boy Vere obeyed her and slipped out to Gaspare.\\n\\n\\\"You really won't come, Madre?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. But--tell me if you see the light.\\\"\\n\\nThe girl nodded, and the door moved into its place, shutting out the wind.\\n\\nThen the Marchesino sat down and looked at his damp patent-leather boots.\\n\\nHe really could not comprehend these English ladies. That Vere was greatly attracted by him he thoroughly believed. How could it be otherwise? Her liveliness he considered direct encouragement. And then she had gone out to the terrace after dinner, leaving her mother. That was to make him follow her, of course. She wanted to be alone with him. In a Neapolitan girl such conduct would have been a declaration. A Neapolitan mother would not have allowed them to sit together on the terrace without a chaperon. But the English mother had deliberately remained within and had kept Caro Emilio with her. What could such conduct mean, if not that the Signorina was in love with him, the Marchesino, and that the Signorina's mamma was perfectly willing for him to make love to her child?\\n\\nAnd yet--and yet?\",\"timestamp\":1637313858,\"title\":\"\\nAs she called the lightning flashed again, and showed her Vere and the Marchesino\"},\"digest\":\"e8uSqFMCdCj_DDdS7BoAR5ZWQqBEvIBMmhEXi_zuJ-s\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x51D393CD2fE363A89232ff9D8Ac75A13bD6a52e7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HjjVVWasAiIYE0ppspHbw5M7tnZtnoOXC0M-dKDYBrk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AOa6qgDTF-SZ_rXVxj_uyEyy_0-uB8Av5tp-mjUir_A\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"omG1E0CrtJ4PpIUMWQFfe91Zo3HzAb2rKuu3cIcAHHlYpj8XZMEXjT-yrmaRv35Mw_KWtgZedFFArJi0L6CwCw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc46417028264474f5d39ad62819a1419714bfcb12305bc0f8cd43e56fc0354a5401c330cecd784b6abca0a0b30fa3050ffc02134cfafc75489448ac939576b551c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HjjVVWasAiIYE0ppspHbw5M7tnZtnoOXC0M-dKDYBrk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AOa6qgDTF-SZ_rXVxj_uyEyy_0-uB8Av5tp-mjUir_A\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"e8uSqFMCdCj_DDdS7BoAR5ZWQqBEvIBMmhEXi_zuJ-s\"}"
