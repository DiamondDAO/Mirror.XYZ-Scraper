"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Harissa is probably my all-time favorite hot sauce, and one I'm sure you've seen me use in a bunch of recipes here. A small spoonful of this makes virtually any savory dish better.\\n\\n[ \\n ](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/foodwisheswithchefjohn/)Directions\\n\\nInstructions Checklist\\n\\n* Step 1\\n\\n  Preheat oven's broiler and set the oven rack at about 6 inches from the heat source. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place red bell peppers with cut sides down onto the prepared baking sheet. Cook under the preheated broiler until the skin of the peppers has blackened and blistered, 5 to 8 minutes. Place the blackened peppers into a bowl and tightly seal with plastic wrap. Allow the peppers to steam as they cool, about 20 minutes. Remove and discard skins.\\n* Step 2\\n\\n  Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add Fresno and habanero chiles and cook uncovered over medium heat until vegetables start to soften, about 3 minutes; drain and set aside to cool. Remove seeds and membranes from chiles (wear gloves); set aside.\\n* Step 3\\n\\n  Shake coriander and caraway seeds in a skillet over medium heat until you start to smell the spice, about 2 minutes. Use a mortar and pestle to crush toasted seeds; add cumin, mint, and salt, and crush until finely ground. Transfer spices to a blender and add roasted bell peppers, chiles, garlic, lemon juice, and vegetable oil; puree until smooth. Drizzle in extra-virgin olive oil at the end, blending for only a few seconds.\",\"timestamp\":1640341792,\"title\":\"Chef John's Harissa Sauce\"},\"digest\":\"fdwFhAQgQKE0ukXliPdOJ7CAYj5VCbdbw_-e547fMuQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x1432AF875523ACe06b522FA65264792642C0C683\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"lYDkc1EjujNQzxWwNzoL0SC-ufdYPOaflio7nDsXwaY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"iBe92bqU9Xxuu6YgQzqpPOL0suXjl4QR11B9jPOY2Ms\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"qG9J_Ti88uNkOwDI5ph7qu_4oKC6UmB_OmCz98GGoDjo7RReu8qhiSNpor1t7psBrZ0HwF2DhlIRcomGYKJNTg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x505abc266e21fbccf40a8c3f46ab452b1902bf97f9e4407bda4f2f9fed45d6d068b5c3b397ae1b019a0c7eb69bb5c6c9e89f1921858b8aeb24e80fcf5ce8397a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"lYDkc1EjujNQzxWwNzoL0SC-ufdYPOaflio7nDsXwaY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"iBe92bqU9Xxuu6YgQzqpPOL0suXjl4QR11B9jPOY2Ms\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"fdwFhAQgQKE0ukXliPdOJ7CAYj5VCbdbw_-e547fMuQ\"}"
