This was also the very first song I wrote after a 10-day cross-country solo drive from Montreal, Canada to Los Angeles, California.\\n\\n[auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3166](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3166)\\n\\n## Track No. 4 ‚Äî Red Balloons\\n\\n*Red Balloons* is written by Hayley Gene Penner, Jason Yik Nam Wu + myself, and produced by Rabitt.\\n\\nThis is the first song I've ever released with a co-written top-line. I've always found it difficult to write lyrics and melody with others, but Hayley is a great friend and we truly found a shared energy on this one. And Rabitt always brings the goods.\\n\\n[auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3167](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3167)\\n\\n## Track No. 5 ‚Äî Crazy\\n\\n*Crazy* is written by Danny Majic + myself, and produced by Danny Majic.\\n\\nWe wrote this song together at a songwriting camp in Nashville, Tennessee.

Attached to said studio was the very house we were both living in at the time. This was the last song we wrote together, before I left for Montreal when the pandemic began. A version of the song was first released on streaming platforms in May 2020, on a charity album raising money for MusiCares' Covid Relief Fund.\\n\\n[auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3169](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3169)\\n\\nAs you can see in the auctions above above, **5% of funds received are going towards my private community *Homemade Universe*‚Äôs shared treasury**.

We started writing this song on my birthday. It was the first time Matt and I had ever worked together.\\n\\nThe song is nearly finished, but has an empty second verse that needs a feature. Hence, the ***Flavors Feature Contest***. Anyone who collects an NFT or purchases an album bundle copy receives one (1) entry into the contest.\\n\\nAfter your purchase and/or collection, you‚Äôll receive a private download of the album. Included will be an mp3 of Flavors with an open second verse. You can use that file to start writing your verse. You will also gain access to the Homemade Universe discord server, where you will be able to submit your version of Flavors. Submissions will close on June 20 2021.\\n\\nA winner will then be chosen to be the official feature of Flavors. The final version of the song with your verse on it will then be released as a 1/1 Catalog NFT and, eventually, on the Textures OF A Long Forgotten Assumption album release on streaming platforms.\\n\\n**The winner will also receive this 1/1 collectible NFT of Flavors, as well as 10% of the master‚Äôs future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties etc).**\\n\\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:1012987:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\\n\\n### **Track no. 8 ‚Äî *Paint*** + the *Silent Auction*\\n\\n[ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/1012935](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/1012935)\\n\\nThe song *Paint* is still in a very early demo stage. In fact, I don‚Äôt yet have a chorus for it. I wrote the beginnings of this song with Danny Majic, and have always loved the first verse and pre-chorus. But there is still a ways to go on this song, and I am looking for 1 partner to join along for the ride.\\n\\nThis partner will be the ***creative director*** for the song *Paint* ‚Äî and this role can look many different ways. Perhaps you‚Äôre a musician and can help with the songwriting or production of the song, perhaps you‚Äôre visual artists and can help on the visual side. Perhaps you don‚Äôt consider yourself an artist whatsoever, but can help on the outreach and marketing side. Perhaps you just want to get a closer look into the makings of a song, and just want to take pictures of the process on your disposable camera. Whatever it may be! This creative director position is yours to fill however you choose, should you win it of course.\\n\\nNow, how do you win it?\\n\\nThe *Paint* collectible is a 1/1 NFT on Rarible, and is up for **Silent Auction**.\\n\\nYes, that‚Äôs correct. Silent Auction.\\n\\nTo win this auction, you must email me your bid.\\n\\nThat‚Äôs correct. Email me your bid at paintauctionbid@gmail.com.\\n\\nYour bid can be in ETH, it can be in USD, it can be in CAD, or DOGE or WRITE or any other currency on the planet. It can also be a non-currency bid! It can be a barter of some kind ‚Äî maybe a good or maybe a service. Anything! Get creative!\\n\\nThis is for the role of creative director on the song. So show me your creativity. And show me how much you want it. :)\\n\\nOnce the first bid is in, a 24-hour countdown will commence. I will announce updates on the Silent Auction in real-time on [twitter](https://twitter.com/matthewchaim).\\n\\n**The winner will be the official creative director for *Paint*, win this 1/1 collectible NFT, and receive 10% of the master‚Äôs future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties etc).**\\n\\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:1012935:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\\n\\n### **Track no. 9 ‚Äî *Untitled*** + the *Untitled Creative Director DAO*\\n\\n[ethereum://0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430/572927](ethereum://0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430/572927)\\n\\nGrab your **[entry NFT into the](https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details) *[Untitled Creative Director DAO](https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details)* [here](https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details)**.\\n\\n1 creative director is great. But what about 100?\\n\\nYes, that‚Äôs correct. 100 creative directors.\\n\\nThat is what I am in search of for this last song on the album, which does not yet even have a name. As you can see, we have our work cut out for ourselves.\\n\\nIn fact, I‚Äôm not even sure which demo on mine should be the 9th and final song on the project. There are a few options that I really love, but I need your help to decide on which one to pursue. That is where we will start our collective decision making. Here‚Äôs how it works:\\n\\nThe Untitled collectible is a **100 edition** NFT on [Rarible](https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details), with each edition priced at **0.03 ETH**. I ask that you purchase a maximum of **1 edition per wallet**.\\n\\nThe Untitled collectible NFT will act as the access token into a gated set of channels on the Homemade Universe discord, where this community of 100 people will convene and begin the creative direction of the song.\\n\\n**Each edition represents 1 vote in the *Untitled Creative Director DAO* that will be formed to govern the completion of this final song of the album, as well as 0.1% of the master‚Äôs future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties, etc). This means that 100 people will together own 10% of the song‚Äôs final master.**\\n\\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:572927:0x5090c4fead5be112b643bc75d61bf42339675448?tab=details\\n\\n# THE COPIES\\n\\nThe final form this album is being released today is with **1000 album bundle copies**, [available for purchase on my online shop here](https://ko-fi.com/s/794a026bac).\\n\\nThis bundle comes with:\\n\\n1. the first 7 tracks off the album, including *Flavors* with the empty second verse\\n2. 8 pieces of album artwork\\n3. one (1) invitation to *Homemade Universe*\\n4. one (1) entry into the *Flavors Feature Contest* (more info in the Collectibles section above\\n\\nAfter your purchase, you will receive an access card into the Homemade Universe discord ‚Äî which will give you access to the private set of channels available to members.\\n\\nThe album bundle will be available for up to two weeks or up to 1000 copies, whichever comes first.\\n\\n**You can [purchase an album bundle copy here](https://ko-fi.com/s/794a026bac).**\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f29b829a-3e2e-4aba-aee9-2ab41f399355.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\\n\\n# A Final Thought\\n\\nIn building this release out, I realized I missed one more word in my cute little alliteration.\\n\\nThe full phrase should go ‚Üí Canon, Collectibles, Copies, and *Community*.\\n\\nThis project in some ways only *begins* today, in that it is the first page in our story of exploring collective creation together. For the final 3 songs, we will begin a new journey of seeing what it is like for a community to create together in 3 very different ways ‚Äî one as a contest, one as a 1-to-1 relationship, and 1 as a DAO making decisions together. It is also the beginning of exploring the possibilities around sharing in the equity of our co-creations in this way.\\n\\nThe other thing you may notice in the splits delineated in the *Canon* NFTs above, is my private community Homemade Universe is receiving 5% of all auction revenues. Those funds will go into a shared treasury controlled by the community, which we will use for future co-creative projects together.\\n\\nI‚Äôm incredibly excited to go on this new journey with you. And learn what it means to bring together like-minded individuals around my art, and create real value together.\\n\\nThis is just the beginning.\\n\\nThanks for being here. üåª\",\"timestamp\":1630021489,\"title\":\"Textures Of A Long Forgotten Assumption\",\"publication\":\"chaim\"},\"digest\":\"jU2975hZhcH2_ih25kzIwj9rj5OmD54HAo0TA5c3HpU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5090c4Fead5Be112b643BC75d61bF42339675448\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"w8_GWqtgHjoYdmCRiFx19yLCfb0ztZ10t3A620GTxlY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"v1rbnr7XJh1ar5IUvbgtZHxgYAO9bL1Hq9hQq1ydT2A\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"nUQpvNXUSvOObRJT_V9uWDkJDfwx2xsESluvpLCttszq5YMAj93WHHZjFwgMNRiOl2W4IrGThz627MPdHc_BAA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xde81babbe065f2a8f6022630a3fc33b904824cf1f6d32a72e134992d3764a7b10bf75f4aabae7c6d5a1d947c651b55bfeea1378ec953357da9fa764b3a6024f81c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on chaim.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"w8_GWqtgHjoYdmCRiFx19yLCfb0ztZ10t3A620GTxlY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"v1rbnr7XJh1ar5IUvbgtZHxgYAO9bL1Hq9hQq1ydT2A\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"9EAsxtkQD6hIQJLDID5w8Jn6o_m9Bw4XnDdTwOVHttA\"}"
