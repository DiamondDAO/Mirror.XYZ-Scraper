"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"And great offence, to kill Any of these our guiltless men   For they have done no ill;\\n\\n\\\"Let thou and I the battle try,   And set our men aside.\\\" \\\"Accurst be he,\\\" Earl Piercy said,   \\\"By whom it is denied.\\\"\\n\\nThen stepped a gallant squire forth,--   Witherington was his name,-- Who said, \\\"I would not have it told   To Henry our king, for shame,\\n\\n\\\"That e'er my captain fought on foot,   And I stand looking on: You be two Earls,\\\" quoth Witherington,   \\\"And I a Squire alone.\\n\\n\\\"I'll do the best that do I may,   While I have power to stand! While I have power to wield my sword,   I'll fight with heart and hand!\\\"\\n\\nOur English archers bent their bows--   Their hearts were good and true,-- At the first flight of arrows sent,   Full fourscore Scots they slew.\\n\\nTo drive the deer with hound and horn,   Douglas bade on the bent; Two captains moved with mickle might,   Their spears to shivers went.\\n\\nThey closed full fast on every side,   No slackness there was found, But many a gallant gentleman   Lay gasping on the ground.\\n\\nO Christ! it was great grief to see   How each man chose his spear, And how the blood out of their breasts   Did gush like water clear!\\n\\nAt last these two stout Earls did meet   Like captains of great might; Like lions wood they laid on load,   They made a cruel fight.\\n\\nThey fought, until they both did sweat,   With swords of tempered steel, Till blood adown their cheeks like rain   They trickling down did feel.\\n\\n\\\"O yield thee, Piercy!\\\" Douglas said,   \\\"And in faith I will thee bring Where thou shalt high advanc-ed be   By James our Scottish king;\\n\\n\\\"Thy ransom I will freely give,   And this report of thee, Thou art the most courageous knight   That ever I did see.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, Douglas!\\\" quoth Earl Piercy then,   \\\"Thy proffer I do scorn; I will not yield to any Scot   That ever yet was born!\\\"\\n\\nWith that there came an arrow keen   Out of an English bow, Which struck Earl Douglas to the heart   A deep and deadly blow;\\n\\nWho never said more words than these,   \\\"Fight on; my merry men all! For why? my life is at an end,   Lord Piercy sees my fall.\\\"\\n\\nThen leaving life, Earl Piercy took   The dead man by the hand; Who said, \\\"Earl Douglas! for thy life   Would I had lost my land!\\n\\n\\\"O Christ! my very heart doth bleed   For sorrow for thy sake! For sure, a more redoubted knight   Mischance could never take!\\\"\\n\\nA knight amongst the Scots there was,   Which saw Earl Douglas die, Who straight in heart did vow revenge   Upon the Lord Pierc-y;\\n\\nSir Hugh Montgomery he was called,   Who, with a spear full bright, Well mounted on a gallant steed,   Ran fiercely through the fight,\\n\\nAnd past the English archers all   Without all dread or fear, And through Earl Piercy's body then   He thrust his hateful spear.\\n\\nWith such a vehement force and might   His body he did gore, The staff ran through the other side   A large cloth yard and more.\\n\\nSo thus did both those nobles die,   Whose courage none could stain. An English archer then perceived   The noble Earl was slain;\\n\\nHe had a good bow in his hand   Made of a trusty tree; An arrow of a cloth yard long   To the hard head hal-ed he,\\n\\nAgainst Sir Hugh Montgomery   His shaft full right he set; The grey goose-wing that was thereon,   In his heart's blood was wet.\\n\\nThis fight from break of day did last   Till setting of the sun; For when they rung the evening bell,   The battle scarce was done.\\n\\nWith stout Earl Piercy there was slain   Sir John of Egerton, Sir Robert Harcliffe and Sir William,   Sir James that bold bar-on;\\n\\nAnd with Sir George and Sir James,   Both knights of good account, Good Sir Ralph Raby there was slain,   Whose prowess did surmount.\\n\\nFor Witherington needs must I wail   As one in doleful dumps, For when his legs were smitten off,   He fought upon his stumps.\\n\\nAnd with Earl Douglas there was slain   Sir Hugh Montgomery, And Sir Charles Morrel that from the field   One foot would never fly;\\n\\nSir Roger Hever of Harcliffe too,--   His sister's son was he,-- Sir David Lambwell, well esteemed,   But saved he could not be;\\n\\nAnd the Lord Maxwell in like case   With Douglas he did die; Of twenty hundred Scottish spears,   Scarce fifty-five did fly.\\n\\nOf fifteen hundred Englishmen   Went home but fifty-three; The rest in Chevy Chase were slain,   Under the greenwood tree.\\n\\nNext day did many widows come   Their husbands to bewail; They washed their wounds in brinish tears,   But all would not prevail.\\n\\nTheir bodies, bathed in purple blood,   They bore with them away; They kissed them dead a thousand times   Ere they were clad in clay.\\n\\nThis news was brought to Edinburgh,   Where Scotland's king did reign, That brave Earl Douglas suddenly   Was with an arrow slain.\\n\\n\\\"O heavy news!\\\" King James did say,   \\\"Scotland may witness be I have not any captain more   Of such account as he!\\\"\\n\\nLike tidings to King Henry came   Within as short a space, That Piercy of Northumberland   Was slain in Chevy Chase.\\n\\n\\\"Now God be with him!\\\" said our king,   \\\"Sith 'twill no better be, I trust I have within my realm   Five hundred as good as he!\\n\\n\\\"Yet shall not Scots nor Scotland say   But I will vengeance take, And be reveng-ed on them all   For brave Earl Piercy's sake.\\\"\\n\\nThis vow the king did well perform   After on Humble Down; In one day fifty knights were slain,   With lords of great renown,\\n\\nAnd of the rest of small account,   Did many hundreds die: Thus ended the hunting in Chevy Chase   Made by the Earl Piercy.\\n\\nGod save our king, and bless this land   With plenty, joy, and peace, And grant henceforth that foul debate   Twixt noble men may cease!\\n\\nTHE NUT-BROWN MAID\\n\\nBe it right or wrong, these men among   On women do complain; Affirming this, how that it is   A labour spent in vain To love them wele; for never a dele   They love a man again: For let a man do what he can,   Their favour to attain, Yet, if a new to them pursue,   Their first true lover than Laboureth for naught; and from her thought   He is a banished man.\\n\\nI say not nay, but that all day   It is both writ and said That woman's faith is, as who saith,   All utterly decayed; But nevertheless, right good witn-ess   In this case might be laid. That they love true, and contin-ue,   Record the Nut-brown Maid: Which from her love, when her to prove   He came to make his moan, Would not depart; for in her heart   She loved but him alone.\\n\\nThen between us let us discuss   What was all the manere Between them two:  we will also   Tell all the pain in fere That she was in.  Now I begin,   So that ye me answere: Wher-efore, ye, that present be   I pray you give an ear. I am the knight.  I come by night,   As secret as I can; Saying, \\\"Alas! thus standeth the case,   I am a banished man.\\\"\\n\\nAnd I your will for to fulfil   In this will not refuse; Trusting to shew, in word-es few,   That men have an ill use (To their own shame) women to blame,   And causeless them accuse: Therefore to you I answer now,   All women to excuse,-- \\\"Mine own heart dear, with you what cheer?   I pray you, tell anone: For, in my mind, of all mankind   I love but you alone.\\\"\\n\\n```\\n HE. \\\"It standeth so:  a deed is do   Whereof much harm shall grow; My destiny is for to die   A shameful death, I trow; Or else to flee.  The one must be.   None other way I know, But to withdraw as an out-law,   And take me to my bow. Wherefore, adieu, my own heart true!   None other rede I can: For I must to the green wood go,   Alone, a banished man.\\\"\\n\\n SHE. \\\"O Lord, what is this world-es bliss,   That changeth as the moon! My summer's day in lusty May   Is darked before the noon. I hear you say, farewell:  Nay, nay!   We de-part not so soon. Why say ye so? whither will ye go?   Alas! what have ye done? All my welf-are to sorrow and care   Should change, if ye were gone: For, in my mind, of all mankind   I love but you alone.\\\"\\n\\n HE. \\\"I can believe, it shall you grieve,   And somewhat you distrain; But, afterward, your pain-es hard   Within a day or twain Shall soon aslake; and ye shall take   Com-fort to you again. Why should ye nought? for, to make thought,   Your labour were in vain. And thus I do; and pray you, lo,   As heartily as I can: For I must to the green wood go,   Alone, a banished man.\\\"\\n\\n SHE. \\\"Now, sith that ye have shewed to me   The secret of your mind, I shall be plain to you again,   Like as ye shall me find. Sith it is so, that ye will go,   I will not leave behind. Shall never be said, the Nut-brown Maid   Was to her love unkind: Make you read-y, for so am I,   Although it were anone: For, in my mind, of all mankind   I love but you alone.\\\"\\n\\n HE. \\\"Yet I you re-de, take good heed   When men will think and say: Of young, of old, it shall be told,   That ye be gone away Your wanton will for to fulfil,   In green wood you to play; And that ye might from your delight   No longer make delay. Rather than ye should thus for me   Be called an ill wom-an, Yet would I to the green wood go,   Alone, a banished man.\\\"\\n\\n SHE. \\\"Though it be sung of old and young,   That I should be to blame, Theirs be the charge that speak so large   In hurting of my name: For I will prove, that faithful love   It is devoid of shame In your distress and heaviness   To part with you the same: And sure all tho that do not so,   True lovers are they none: For, in my mind, of all mankind   I love but you alone.\\\"\\n\\n HE. \\\"I counsel you, Remember how   It is no maiden's law Nothing to doubt, but to run out   To wood with an out-law; For ye must there in your hand bear   A bow to bear and draw; And, as a thief, thus must ye live,   Ever in dread and awe; By which to you great harm might grow:   Yet had I liever than That I had to the green wood go   Alone, a banished man.\\\"\\n\\n SHE. \\\"I think not nay, but as ye say,   It is no maiden's lore; But love may make me for your sake,   As ye have said before, To come on foot, to hunt and shoot   To get us meat and store; For so that I your company   May have, I ask no more; From which to part, it maketh mine heart   As cold as any stone: For, in my mind, of all mankind   I love but you alone.\\\"\\n\\n HE. \\\"For an out-law, this is the law,   That men him take and bind; Without pit-ie, hang-ed to be,   And waver with the wind. If I had nede (as God forbede!)   What rescues could ye find? Forsooth, I trow, you and your bow   Should draw for fear behind. And no mervayle:  for little avail   Were in your counsel than: Wherefore I to the wood will go,   Alone, a banished man.\\\"\\n\\n SHE \\\"Full well know ye, that women be   Full feeble for to fight; No womanhede it is indeed   To be bold as a knight; Yet, in such fear if that ye were   Among enemies day and night, I would withstand, with bow in hand,   To grieve them as I might, And you to save; as women have   From death many a one: For, in my mind, of all mankind   I love but you alone.\\\"\\n\\n HE. \\\"Yet take good hede; for ever I drede   That ye could not sustain The thorny ways, the deep vall-eys,   The snow, the frost, the rain, The cold, the heat:  for dry or wet,   We must lodge on the plain; And, us above, none other roof   But a brake bush or twain: Which soon should grieve you, I believe:   And ye would gladly than That I had to the green wood go,   Alone, a banished man.\\\"\\n\\n SHE. \\\"Sith I have here been partynere   With you of joy and bliss, I must al-so part of your woe   Endure, as reason is: Yet am I sure of one pleas-ure;   And, shortly, it is this: That, where ye be, me seemeth, perde,   I could not fare amiss. Without more speech, I you beseech   That we were soon agone: For, in my mind, of all mankind   I love but you alone.\\\"\\n\\n HE. \\\"If ye go thyder, ye must consider,   When ye have lust to dine, There shall no meat be for to gete,   Nor drink, beer, ale, ne wine. Ne sheet-es clean, to lie between,   Ymade of thread and twine; None other house, but leaves and boughs,   To cover your head and mine; Lo mine heart sweet, this ill di-ete   Should make you pale and wan: Wherefore I to the wood will go,   Alone, a banished man.\\\"\\n\\n SHE. \\\"Among the wild deer, such an archere,   As men say that ye be, Ne may not fail of good vitayle,   Where is so great plent-y: And water clear of the rivere   Shall be full sweet to me; With which in hele I shall right wele   Endure, as ye shall see; And, ere we go, a bed or two   I can provide anone; For, in my mind, of all mankind   I love but you alone.\\\"\\n\\n HE. \\\"Lo yet, before, ye must do more,   If ye will go with me: As cut your hair up by your ear,   Your kirtle by the knee, With bow in hand, for to withstand   Your enemies, if need be: And this same night, before daylight,   To woodward will I flee. An ye will all this fulfil,   Do it shortly as ye can: Else will I to the green wood go,   Alone, a banished man.\\\"\\n\\n SHE. \\\"I shall as now do more for you   Than 'longeth to womanhede; To short my hair, a bow to bear,   To shoot in time of need. O my sweet mother! before all other   For you have I most drede! But now, adieu! I must ensue,   Where fortune doth me lead. All this make ye.  Now let us flee;   The day comes fast upon: For, in my mind, of all mankind   I love but you alone.\\\"\\n\\n HE. \\\"Nay, nay, not so; ye shall not go,   And I shall tell you why,-- Your appetite is to be light   Of love, I well espy: For, right as ye have said to me,   In like wise hardily Ye would answere whosoever it were,   In way of company, It is said of old, Soon hot, soon cold;   And so is a wom-an: Wherefore I to the wood will go,   Alone, a banished man.\\\"\\n\\n SHE. \\\"If ye take heed, it is no need   Such words to say by me; For oft ye prayed, and long assayed,   Or I you loved, pard-e; And though that I of ancestry   A baron's daughter be, Yet have you proved how I you loved.   A squire of low degree; And ever shall, whatso befall;   To die therefore anone; For, in my mind, of all mankind   I love but you alone.\\\"\\n\\n HE. \\\"A baron's child to be beguiled!   It were a curs-ed dede; To be fel-aw with an out-law   Almighty God forbede! Yet better were, the poor squyere   Alone to forest yede, Than ye shall say another day,   That by my wicked dede Ye were betrayed:  Wherefore, good maid,   The best rede that I can, Is, that I to the green wood go,   Alone, a banished man.\\\"\\n\\n SHE. \\\"Whatsoever befall, I never shall   Of this thing you upbraid: But if ye go, and leave me so,   Then have ye me betrayed. Remember you wele, how that ye dele,   For if ye, as ye said, Be so unkind to leave behind   Your love, the Nut-brown Maid, Trust me tru-ly, that I shall die   Soon after ye be gone: For, in my mind, of all mankind   I love but you alone.\\\"\\n\\n HE. \\\"If that ye went, ye should repent;   For in the forest now I have purveyed me of a maid,   Whom I love more than you; Another fairer than ever ye were,   I dare it well avow; And of you both, each should be wroth   With other, as I trow: It were mine ease to live in peace;   So will I, if I can: Wherefore I to the wood will go,   Alone, a banished man.\\\"\\n\\n SHE. \\\"Though in the wood I understood   Ye had a paramour, All this may nought remove my thought,   But that I will be your: And she shall find me soft and kind,   And courteis every hour; Glad to fulfil all that she will   Command me, to my power: For had ye, lo! an hundred mo,   Yet would I be that one: For, in my mind, of all mankind   I love but you alone.\\\"\\n\\n HE. \\\"Mine own dear love, I see the proof   That ye be kind and true; Of maid, and wife, in all my life,   The best that ever I knew. Be merry and glad; be no more sad;   The case is chang-ed new; For it were ruth that for your truth   You should have cause to rue. Be not dismayed, whatsoever I said   To you, when I began: I will not to the green wood go;   I am no banished man.\\\"\\n\\n SHE. \\\"These tidings be more glad to me,   Than to be made a queen, If I were sure they should endure:   But it is often seen, When men will break promise they speak   The wordis on the spleen. Ye shape some wile me to beguile,   And steal from me, I ween: Then were the case worse than it was   And I more wo-begone: For, in my mind, of all mankind   I love but you alone.\\\"\\n\\n HE. \\\"Ye shall not nede further to drede:   I will not dispar-age You (God defend!), sith you descend   Of so great a lin-age. Now understand:  to Westmoreland,   Which is my heritage, I will you bring; and with a ring   By way of marri-age I will you take, and lady make,   As shortly as I can: Thus have ye won an earl-es son   And not a banished man.\\\"\\n```\\n\\nHere may ye see, that women be   In love, meek, kind, and stable; Let never man reprove them than,   Or call them vari-able; But, rather, pray God that we may   To them be comfort-able, Which sometime proveth such as he loveth,   If they be charit-able. For sith men would that women should   Be meek to them each one; Much more ought they to God obey,   And serve but Him alone.\\n\\nADAM BELL, CLYM OF THE CLOUGH, AND WILLIAM OF CLOUDESLIE.\",\"timestamp\":1636103369,\"title\":\"\\\"But trust me, Piercy, pity it were\"},\"digest\":\"WqlvhskkHRw_Y7bHFUENsOC_0lT5asp7gnKUPdMAEsU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xdAD957361768B35f30365E92A8C13e24b91Df004\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fTycx3kuHKO4CGNnx7eSeOFG8QzydANMqvQHUIA49k4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"d3efpp0IuO5yo6Fd9fOR1GSZJLlPT-zROikbuieXZr4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"DN01eRksCy-zkqJsunXXDUrs-kXSqJwQ2WlSHygHW20zjNr4JSJnCitLgpG6ADFquMPRFNXNNYkJhjG6sdGfhg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x404eed3388c0fa71a54f946a5c7e90fa005055791b07dc13b9d357191acdc167145513d3edd1fb51dfd7fe7e7911256ba5d1d13a39eff3aafa1822d4ec0590181c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fTycx3kuHKO4CGNnx7eSeOFG8QzydANMqvQHUIA49k4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"d3efpp0IuO5yo6Fd9fOR1GSZJLlPT-zROikbuieXZr4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"WqlvhskkHRw_Y7bHFUENsOC_0lT5asp7gnKUPdMAEsU\"}"
