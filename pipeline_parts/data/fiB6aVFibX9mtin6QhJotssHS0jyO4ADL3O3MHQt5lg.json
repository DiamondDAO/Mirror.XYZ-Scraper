"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*The SafePal wallet is designed to address simplicity with a consolidated dashboard and cross-chain swapping features to support users with staking, amongst other earning opportunities.*\\n\\n[SafePal](https://safepal.io/) is providing users with a solution that operates as a completely non-custodial decentralized crypto asset management platform. The solution comprises a software and hardware wallet for users both simply and conveniently, targeting users who are still reluctant to participate in DeFi.\\n\\nThe SafePal wallet is designed with a simplified dashboard that guides users to a series of DeFi pools without having to navigate through an overwhelming amount of DApps, prior to staking. Alongside staking are the platformâ€™s features for auto-compounding in SafePal Earn, which will give users an additional opportunity to save money and earn passive income on all their cryptocurrency assets.\\n\\nWith the SafePal wallet, users will no longer use centralized exchange solutions or go through the standard centralized account registration process. Instead, users can take advantage of the SafePal cross-chain Swap feature to ensure necessary assets can be easily swapped for staking. Furthermore, an LP maker is natively built on the SafePal wallet and will create the necessary tokens for staking pools.\\n\\nCurrently, the team has noted several achievements over the past year, including the launch of a token on Binance Launchpad and the solution reaching the position as the number one tokenized hardware wallet, with over 2 million monthly active users.\\n\\nLearn more about [Safepal](https://safepal.io/)\\n\\nDisclaimer.
