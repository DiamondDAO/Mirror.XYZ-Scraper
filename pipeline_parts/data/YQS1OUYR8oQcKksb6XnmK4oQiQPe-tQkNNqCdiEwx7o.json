"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1910, New York\\n\\nBessie Faith Medlar made the first solo flight by a woman pilot in America. She built her plane with lighter materials, including bamboo. Where the Wright Brothers used canvas, she used silk. Instead of iron wire, she used piano wire. She went on to build more aircraft.\\n\\n1916, New York City\\n\\nRuth Bancroft Law broke a speed record after flying from Chicago to NYC. When WW I broke out, she wrote \\\"Let Women Fly!\\\" for women's right to serve as pilots. In 1922, her husband made a false announcement about her \\\"retirement\\\" from flying. A 1932 breakdown was attributed to not flying.\\n\\n\\\"The surest way to make me do a thing is to tell me I can't do it.\\\" - Ruth B.

She was worth billions but she was a kid again about to meet a personal hero. An older woman walked in with the ease of royalty on holiday. Elena used all her training to remain calm.\\n\\n\\\"Hello, Lenamay, it's a pleasure. I'm a fan of your \\\"expees\\\", like the one where you experience slingshotting through the System. I've done it for real, and you got it like the real thing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thank you! Please call me Elena. I'm honored you experienced some of my \\\"expees\\\". Doctor Birmingham, it's an honor to meet you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Call me June please. I'm also surprised, that you're interested in what I do. And why we couldn't stream each other, why it had to talk live. I'm curious.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"June, When I was younger, back home, I was sick, and had a lot of time. First to play what is now work. I also learned about how it was before the \\\"Vote\\\" changed things.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, the \\\"Grand Vote\\\" and \\\"Grand Halt\\\". In many ways I became a dinosaur, extinct. No more dreams about the stars, well at least for now, but maybe forever.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What if I told you, I want to learn from you to do what you did, to be like you June. I want to build and fly ships to the stars. And fly far away from people who say we can’t?”\",\"timestamp\":1633969577,\"title\":\"2921: 3.14 The Surest Way To Do A Thing, 2916\"},\"digest\":\"5JF6tpyotSvtSmxRoMwYgAhkiW7LVb4LBYIhZTwzGlU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"yNHF5c889HCUo2hQ9Bx7kPGAuCiHjOIBtYmou8EHmE97AczrWPYl1cSxw3h89he6uyZVEtzZ_W-bd25eJ1J-EA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"L-x6GLr8dMAbJb4EVsSsyZNmTMyT5oxmI9ctwWbkHjk\"}"
