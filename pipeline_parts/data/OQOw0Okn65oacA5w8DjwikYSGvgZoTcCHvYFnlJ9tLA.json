"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"A domain \\\"paradigm.eth\\\" based on the Ethereum Domain Name Service (ENS) was acquired for a record-breaking 420 Ethereum. Although the price broke the record in history, it seems that it was not acquired by the well-known venture capital Paradigm, but more It's like a spoof.\\n\\n**ENS highest price record**\\nThe full name of ENS is Ethereum Name Service, which is a decentralized domain name service built on Ethereum. Provides a secure and decentralized way to resolve simple and human-interpretable domain names into address resources on and off the chain.\\n\\nCompared with the more general DNS (domain name system), although both provide similar functions, ENS can act as an Ethereum address, and its decentralized nature greatly increases the censorship resistance.\\n\\n10/9 A mysterious wallet bought the domain \\\"paradigm.eth\\\" for 420 ether. At first, people from all walks of life thought it was a domain bought by the famous venture capital Paradigm, but Brantly Millegan, ENS operations director, pointed out that this was not the case.\\n\\n**Is it spoofed or about to take off?**\\nAccording to the screenshot of Brantly Millegan, the information of the Ethereum domain name is set as a series of unrelated links:\\n\\nMailbox: [careers@mcdonalds.com](mailto:careers@mcdonalds.com)\\nWebsite: Forbes article \\\"Meeting the 29-year-old richest person in the world: How SBF created record-breaking wealth in crypto frenzy\\\"\\nAvatar: SushiSwap LOGO\\nDescription: Skate on the Paradigm and shift it when I feel like\\nTwitter: a16z\\ngithub: Yearn founder Andre Cronje\\n\\nBrantly Millegan pointed out that the address holding \\\"paradigm.eth\\\" seems to have also sent a transaction to an address owned by Paradigm co-founder Fred Ehrsam, with the same message: \\\"Skate on the Paradigm and shift it when I feel like.\\\"\\n\\nCompared with the NFT boom this year, ENS has always been concerned by only a few encrypted communities, and most of the communities believe that ENS is one of the underestimated NFT projects, and believe that this event may drive the ENS boom.\\n\\nHowever, Brantly Millegan believes that this may just be a fake transaction performed by the same person between different wallets. \\n  \\n  \\n --- \\n  \\n Hello!
