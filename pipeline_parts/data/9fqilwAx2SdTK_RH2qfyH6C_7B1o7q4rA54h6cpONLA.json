"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"We have seen a drastic change in sociology, economics, and philosophical understanding of fundamental questions due to the astonishing industrialization drive and advancement in Sciences. Humanity’s dogmatic sphere has shaped itself largely from egalitarian tribal society to internationalism to globalization. This trend doesn’t stop there. Now we are heading towards the digitalization of humanity. We will touch the new heights of advancement in physical dimensions but via the digital realm where there are no limits to your imagination, dreams, and creativity.\\n\\nPeople are connected largely through the internet which shapes the bit and bytes of our life. Social technologies have largely expanded the communication horizon to the next level of global reach. Since the integration of such technologies into almost all spheres of life i.e., business, trade, politics, etc., it has already become a new virtual platform in two-dimensional reality. But that will now transform into a real-time simulating three-dimensional virtual reality, without any borders, limits to your imagination, dreams, creativity, and innovation. It will be the next evolution of humanity through digitalization. Machines will become part of us giving birth to a hybrid world.\\n\\n**Fourth industrial revolution** — the complete digitalization of the social, political, and economical spheres of life, is twitching the very fabric of society. It is already transforming the social connectedness among people globally. Industrial revolution 4.0 will completely transform economics, businesses, communities, and politics in a whole new way. It will let you socialize, learn, collaborate and play in ways that go beyond what we can imagine all in virtual reality.\\n\\n![https://about.facebook.com/meta](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5WWFXOonxr6oqwkJVE02i.jpg?height=746&width=1399)\\n\\nFormerly, **Facebook** now **“Metaverse”** recently took the first step accelerating it in making this a new reality. **CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced** the new brand name of his vast conglomerate and called it **[“Meta” ](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/)**summing all its existing products under one new brand name nothing fancier about it till now. But his plans about the future of the internet and social connection are potentially impressive. Not just it, the company has already an initial blend of a number of products i.e., **[Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/)**, to give you a sneak peek into this upcoming new digital normal.\\n\\n**Microsoft** another MNC has its plans even before the **Meta** came into life. Now officially entering into a race to build Metaverse “A new virtual reality”. Microsoft is bringing its new Meta product called “MESH” into its meeting app Microsoft Teams in the first half of 2022. It’s the company’s part of an effort to utilize Mixed Reality and Hololens technology to work with meetings and video calls where anyone can participate having their own animated avatars.\\n\\n![Teams will include virtual meeting spaces in 2022.

Microsoft is also bridging the language gap by integrating translation and transcription support. It will also bring its other major product i.e., Office integration into this **Metaverse** reality.\\n\\nCompanies will be competing in this race of digitalization giving rise to new spheres of opportunities as well as miseries. A tussle of actual competition will rise after the Chinese plan of developing its version of Metaverse. It will be like a new battlefield for MNCs, to win the race of domination in a world where there are no such rules, regulations, regional and international geographical tensions, and social melodrama like in the physical world. It will be lucrative for the consumers as well to get a break from the mind-boggling physical world to the virtual world without any limits.\\n\\nNot only this, a new creative economy inside the virtual world will further immerse us into this new reality. VR-commerce has no doubt potential to even dominate in the physical world. Continuous digitalization of our financial markets, the demand for more seamless and paperless banking, and free trade within the reach of a finger are all which will turn this financial reality into a Virtual reality world. The creative economy inside this sphere has no boundaries, anyone having enough skill set can become a new trillionaire inside the Metaverse.\\n\\nThe upcoming trend of Metaverse and new immersive virtual spaces will also boost inequalities, economical discrimination, social status quo, relationship traumas, and a new set of psychological problems. **That’s the topic for next time to explore in detail in order to build a healthy and safe world for everyone.**\\n\\n \\n Help us build a new digital circular economy for everyone especially in healthcare where anyone around the globe would be able to get universal access to their healthcare needs irrespective of any discriminatory factors.\",\"timestamp\":1636627218,\"title\":\"Race to digitalization opening the new frontier to Humanity\"},\"digest\":\"FilCbIWPC0iAx4R915SLDWlPtndf2zZPsFfg8UMz8tc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xCa5Cae078A9E74646dCFC6d7B281416c8e27053b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7JP8EvWiTDMuey8F7kZxTr3MePD3vs2WqRdE3LVqRXA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Pe3Il0AskU6Exw70HfDEKKHZjf3SXZpICiR2gdI1MFI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"BSNLUpiQE25lLOca8E9q-2hCvLy5SxnqqlabjS6TwNPGjqrMLJMfIxVBFviiEz_JMGRGzWIZNU0i8Mig86Oi5w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x71b412facea6b3efbbb983bcd3a0b734a2ef62291251cded9c7adf2f1e27e3f77fcb8430ac6c3c30f630bc9c5c61c23c909b88b67c21271a0f0fe7b2fb4545a81b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7JP8EvWiTDMuey8F7kZxTr3MePD3vs2WqRdE3LVqRXA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Pe3Il0AskU6Exw70HfDEKKHZjf3SXZpICiR2gdI1MFI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"FilCbIWPC0iAx4R915SLDWlPtndf2zZPsFfg8UMz8tc\"}"
