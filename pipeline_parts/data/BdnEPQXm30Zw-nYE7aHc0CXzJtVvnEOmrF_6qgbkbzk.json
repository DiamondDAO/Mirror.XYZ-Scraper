"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"She said to\\nme, \\\"Stay out,\\\" but Billy she took in with her. I watched them through the glass\\ndoor, and saw her go to a counter and sit down. Billy stood behind her till she\\nsaid, \\\"Lie down.\\\" Then he curled himself at her feet.\\n\\nHe lay quietly, even when she left him and went to another counter. But he eyed\\nher very anxiously till she came back and said, \\\"Up,\\\" to him. Then he sprang up\\nand followed her out to the street.\\n\\nShe stood in the shop door, and looked lovingly down on us as we fawned on her.\\n\\\"Good dogs,\\\" she said, softly; \\\"you shall have a present.\\\" We went behind her\\nagain, and she took us to a shop where we both lay beside the counter. When we\\nheard her ask the clerk for solid rubber balls, we could scarcely keep still. We\\nboth knew what \\\"ball\\\" meant.\\n\\nTaking the parcel in her hand, she came out into the street. She did not do any\\nmore shopping, but turned her face toward the sea. She was going to give us a\\nnice walk along the beach, although it was a dark, disagreeable, cloudy day when\\nmost young ladies would have stayed in the house. The Morris children never\\nminded the weather. Even in the pouring rain, the boys would put on rubber boots\\nand coats and go out to play. Miss Laura walked along, the high wind blowing her\\ncloak and dress about, and when we got past the houses, she had a little run\\nwith us.\\n\\nWe jumped, and frisked, and barked, till we were tired; and then we walked\\nquietly along.\\n\\nA little distance ahead of us were some boys throwing sticks in the water for\\ntwo Newfoundland dogs. Suddenly a quarrel sprang up between the dogs. They were\\nboth powerful creatures, and fairly matched as regarded size. It was terrible to\\nhear their fierce growling, and to see the way in which they tore at each\\nother's throats. I looked at Miss Laura. If she had said a word, I would have\\nrun in and helped the dog that was getting the worst of it. But she told me to\\nkeep back, and ran on herself.\\n\\nThe boys were throwing water on the dogs and pulling their tails, and hurling\\nstones at them, but they could not separate them. Their heads seemed locked\\ntogether, and they went back and forth over the stones, the boys crowding around\\nthem, shouting, and beating, and kicking at them.\\n\\n\\\"Stand back, boys,\\\" said Miss Laura, \\\"I'll stop them.\\\" She pulled a little\\nparcel from her purse, bent over the dogs, scattered a powder on their noses,\\nand the next instant the dogs were yards apart, nearly sneezing their heads off.\\n\\n\\\"I say, Missis, what did you do? What's that stuff? Whew, it's pepper!\\\" the boys\\nexclaimed.\\n\\nMiss Laura sat down on a flat rock, and looked at them with a very pale face.\\n\\\"Oh, boys,\\\" she said, \\\"why did you make those dogs fight? It is so cruel. They\\nwere playing happily till you set them on each other. Just see how they have\\ntorn their handsome coats, and how the blood is dripping from them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"'Taint my fault,\\\" said one of the lads, sullenly. \\\"Jim Jones there said his dog\\ncould lick my dog, and I said he couldn't and he couldn't, nuther.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, he could,\\\" cried the other boy, \\\"and if you say he couldn't, I'll smash\\nyour head.\\\"\\n\\nThe two boys began sidling up to each other with clenched fists, and a third\\nboy, who had a mischievous face, seized the paper that had had the pepper in it,\\nand running up to them shook it in their faces.\\n\\nThere was enough left to put all thoughts of fighting out of their heads. They\\nbegan to cough, and choke, and splutter, and finally found themselves beside the\\ndogs, where the four of them had a lively time.\\n\\nThe other boys yelled with delight, and pointed their fingers at them. \\\"A\\nsneezing concert. Thank you, gentlemen. Angcore, angcore!\\\"\\n\\nMiss Laura laughed too, she could not help it, and even Billy and I curled up\\nour lips. After a while they sobered down, and then finding that the boys hadn't\\na handkerchief between them, Miss Laura took her own soft one, and dipping it in\\na spring of fresh water near by, wiped the red eyes of the sneezers.\\n\\nTheir ill humor had gone, and when she turned to leave them, and said,\\ncoaxingly, \\\"You won't make those dogs fight any more, will you?\\\" they said, \\\"No,\\nsirree, Bob.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Laura went slowly home, and ever afterward when she met any of those boys,\\nthey called her \\\"Miss Pepper.\\\"\\n\\nWhen we got home we found Willie curled up by the window in the hall, reading a\\nbook. He was too fond of reading, and his mother often told him to put away his\\nbook and run about with the other boys. This afternoon Miss Laura laid her hand\\non his shoulder and said, \\\"I was going to give the dogs a little game of ball,\\nbut I'm rather tired.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Gammon and spinach,\\\" he replied, shaking off her hand, \\\"you're always tired.\\\"\\n\\nShe sat down in a hall chair and looked at him. Then she began to tell him about\\nthe dog fight. He was much interested, and the book slipped to the floor. When\\nshe finished he said, \\\"You're a daisy every day. Go now and rest yourself.\\\" Then\\nsnatching the balls from her, he called us and ran down to the basement. But he\\nwas not quick enough though to escape her arm. She caught him to her and kissed\\nhim repeatedly. He was the baby and pet of the family, and he loved her dearly,\\nthough he spoke impatiently to her oftener than either of the other boys.\\n\\nWe had a grand game with Willie. Miss Laura had trained us to do all kinds of\\nthings with balls  jumping for them, playing hide-and-seek, and catching them.\\n\\nBilly could do more things than I could. One thing he did which I thought was\\nvery clever. He played ball by himself. He was so crazy about ball play that he\\ncould never get enough of it. Miss Laura played all she could with him, but she\\nhad to help her mother with the sewing and the housework, and do lessons with\\nher father, for she was only seventeen years old, and had not left off studying.\\nSo Billy would take his ball and go off by himself. Sometimes he rolled it over\\nthe floor, and sometimes he threw it in the air and pushed it through the\\nstaircase railings to the hall below. He always listened till he heard it drop,\\nthen he ran down and brought it back and pushed it through again. He did this\\ntill he was tired, and then he brought the ball and laid it at Miss Laura's\\nfeet.\\n\\nWe both had been taught a number of tricks. We could sneeze and cough, and be\\ndead dogs, and say our prayers, and stand on our heads, and mount a ladder and\\nsay the alphabet, this was the hardest of all, and it took Miss Laura a long\\ntime to teach us. We never began till a book was laid before us. Then we stared\\nat it, and Miss Laura said, \\\"Begin, Joe and Billy say A.\\\"\\n\\nFor A, we gave a little squeal. B was louder C was louder still. We barked for\\nsome letters, and growled for others. We always turned a summersault for S. When\\nwe got to Z, we gave the book a push and had a frolic around the room.\\n\\nWhen any one came in, and Miss Laura had us show off any of our tricks, the\\nremark always was, \\\"What clever dogs. They are not like other dogs.\\\"\\n\\nThat was a mistake. Billy and I were not any brighter than many a miserable cur\\nthat skulked about the streets of Fairport. It was kindness and patience that\\ndid it all. When I was with Jenkins he thought I was a very stupid dog. He would\\nhave laughed at the idea of any one teaching me anything. But I was only sullen\\nand obstinate, because I was kicked about so much. If he had been kind to me, I\\nwould have done anything for him.\\n\\nI loved to wait on Miss Laura and Mrs. Morris and they taught both Billy and me\\nto make ourselves useful about the house. Mrs. Morris didn't like going up and\\ndown the three long staircases, and sometimes we just raced up and down, waiting\\non her.\\n\\nHow often I have heard her go into the hall and say, \\\"Please send me down a\\nclean duster, Laura. Joe, you get it.\\\" I would run gayly up the steps, and then\\nwould come Billy's turn. \\\"Billy, I have forgotten my keys. Go get them.\\\"\\n\\nAfter a time we began to know the names of different articles, and where they\\nwere kept, and could get them ourselves. On sweeping days we worked very hard,\\nand enjoyed the fun. If Mrs. Morris was too far away to call to Mary for what\\nshe wanted, she wrote the name on a piece of paper, and told us to take it to\\nher.\\n\\nBilly always took the letters from the postman, and carried the morning paper up\\nto Mr. Morris's study, and I always put away the clean clothes. After they were\\nmended, Mrs. Morris folded each article and gave it to me, mentioning the name\\nof the owner, so that I could lay it on his bed, There was no need for her to\\ntell me the names. I knew by the smell. All human beings have a strong smell to\\na dog, even though they mayn't notice it themselves. Mrs. Morris never knew how\\nshe bothered me by giving away Miss Laura's clothes to poor people. Once, I\\nfollowed her track all through the town, and at last found it was only a pair of\\nher boots on a ragged child in the gutter.\\n\\nI must say a word about Billy's tail before I close this chapter. It is the\\ncustom to cut the ends of fox terrier's tails, but leave their ears untouched.\\nBilly came to Miss Laura so young that his tail had not been cut off, and she\\nwould not have it done.\\n\\nOne day Mr. Robinson came in to see him and he said, \\\"You have made a fine-\\nlooking dog of him, but his appearance is ruined by the length of his tail.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Robinson,\\\" said Mrs. Morris, patting little Billy, who lay on her lap,\\n\\\"don't you think that this little dog has a beautifully proportioned body?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I do,\\\" said the gentleman. \\\"His points are all correct, save that one.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But,\\\" she said, \\\"if our Creator made that beautiful little body, don't you\\nthink he is wise enough to know what length of tail would be in proportion to\\nit?\\\"\\n\\nMr. Robinson would not answer her. He only laughed and said that he thought she\\nand Miss Laura were both \\\"cranks.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER XI  GOLDFISH AND CANARIES\\n\\nTHE Morris boys were all different. Jack was bright and clever, Ned was a wag,\\nWillie was a book-worm, and Carl was a born trader.\\n\\nHe was always exchanging toys and books with his schoolmates, and they never got\\nthe better of him in a bargain. He said that when he grew up he was going to be\\na merchant, and he had already begun to carry on a trade in canaries and\\ngoldfish. He was very fond of what he called \\\"his yellow pets,\\\" yet he never\\nkept a pair of birds or a goldfish, if he had a good offer for them.\\n\\nHe slept alone in a large, sunny room at the top of the house. By his own\\nrequest, it was barely furnished, and there he raised his canaries and kept his\\ngoldfish.\\n\\nHe was not fond of having visitors coming to his room, because, he said, they\\nfrightened the canaries. After Mrs. Morris made his bed in the morning, the door\\nwas closed, and no one was supposed to go in till he came from school. Once\\nBilly and I followed him upstairs without his knowing it, but as soon as he saw\\nus he sent us down in a great hurry.\\n\\nOne day Bella walked into his room to inspect the canaries. She was quite a\\nspoiled bird by this time, and I heard Carl telling the family afterward that it\\nwas as good as a play to see Miss Bella strutting in with her breast stuck out,\\nand her little, conceited air, and hear her say, shrilly, \\\"Good morning, birds,\\ngood morning! How do you do, Carl? Glad to see you, boy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I'm not glad to see you,\\\" he said decidedly, \\\"and don't you ever come up\\nhere again. You'd frighten my canaries to death.\\\" And he sent her flying\\ndownstairs.\\n\\nHow cross she was! She came shrieking to Miss Laura. \\\"Bella loves birds. Bella\\nwouldn't hurt birds. Carl's a bad boy.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Laura petted and soothed her, telling her to go find Davy, and he would\\nplay with her. Bella and the rat were great friends. It was very funny to see\\nthem going about the house together. From the very first she had liked him, and\\ncoaxed him into her cage, where he soon became quite at home, so much so that he\\nalways slept there. About nine o'clock every evening, if he was not with her,\\nshe went all over the house, crying, \\\"Davy! Davy! time to go to bed. Come sleep\\nin Bella's cage.\\\"\\n\\nHe was very fond of the nice sweet cakes she got to eat, but she never could get\\nhim to eat coffee grounds  food she liked best.\\n\\nMiss Laura spoke to Carl about Bella, and told him he had hurt her feelings, so\\nhe petted her a little to make up for it. Then his mother told him that she\\nthought he was making a mistake in keeping his canaries so much to themselves.\\nThey had become so timid, that when she went into the room they were uneasy till\\nshe left it. She told him that petted birds or animals are sociable and like\\ncompany, unless they are kept by themselves, when they become shy. She advised\\nhim to let the other boys go into the room, and occasionally to bring some of\\nhis pretty singers downstairs, where all the family could enjoy seeing and\\nhearing them, and where they would get used to other people besides himself.\\n\\nCarl looked thoughtful, and his mother went on to say that there was no one in\\nthe house, not even the cat, that would harm his birds.\\n\\n\\\"You might even charge admission for a day or two,\\\" said Jack, gravely, \\\"and\\nintroduce us to them, and make a little money.\\\"\\n\\nCarl was rather annoyed at this, but his mother calmed him by showing him a\\nletter she had just gotten from one of her brothers, asking her to let one of\\nher boys spend his Christmas holidays in the country with him.\\n\\n\\\"I want you to go, Carl,\\\" she said.\\n\\nHe was very much pleased, but looked sober when he thought of his pets. \\\"Laura\\nand I will take care of them,\\\" said his mother, \\\"and start the new management of\\nthem.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well,\\\" said Carl, \\\"I will go then; I've no young ones now, so you will not\\nfind them much trouble.\\\"\\n\\nI thought it was a great deal of trouble to take care of them. The first morning\\nafter Carl left, Billy, and Bella, and Davy, and I followed Miss Laura upstairs.\\nShe made us sit in a row by the door, lest we should startle the canaries. She\\nhad a great many things to do. First, the canaries had their baths. They had to\\nget them at the same time every morning. Miss Laura filled the little white\\ndishes with water and put them in the cages, and then came and sat on a stool by\\nthe door. Bella, and Billy, and Davy climbed into her lap, and I stood close by\\nher. It was so funny to watch those canaries. They put their heads on one side\\nand looked first at their little baths and then at us. They knew we were\\nstrangers. Finally, as we were all very quiet, they got into the water; and what\\na good time they had, fluttering their wings and splashing, and cleaning\\nthemselves so nicely.\\n\\nThen they got up on their perches and sat in the sun, shaking themselves and\\npicking at their feathers.\\n\\nMiss Laura cleaned each cage, and gave each bird some mixed rape and canary\\nseed. I heard Carl tell her before he left not to give them much hemp seed, for\\nthat was too fattening. He was very careful about their food. During the summer\\nI had often seen him taking up nice green things to them: celery, chickweed,\\ntender cabbage, peaches, apples, pears, bananas; and now at Christmas time, he\\nhad green stuff growing in pots on the window ledge.\\n\\nBesides that he gave them crumbs of coarse bread, crackers, lumps of sugar,\\ncuttle-fish to peck at, and a number of other things. Miss Laura did everything\\njust as he told her; but I think she talked to the birds more than he did. She\\nwas very particular about their drinking water, and washed out the little glass\\ncups that held it most carefully.\\n\\nAfter the canaries were clean and comfortable, Miss Laura set their cages in the\\nsun, and turned to the goldfish. They were in large glass globes on the window-\\nseat. She took a long-handled tin cup, and dipped out the fish from one into a\\nbasin of water. Then she washed the globe thoroughly and put the fish back, and\\nscattered wafers of fish food on the top. The fish came up and snapped at it,\\nand acted as if they were glad to get it. She did each globe and then her work\\nwas over for one morning.\\n\\nShe went away for a while, but every few hours through the day she ran up to\\nCarl's room to see how the fish and canaries were getting on. If the room was\\ntoo chilly she turned on more heat; but she did not keep it too warm, for that\\nwould make the birds tender.\\n\\nAfter a time the canaries got to know her, and hopped gayly around their cages,\\nand chirped and sang whenever they saw her coming. Then she began to take some\\nof them downstairs, and to let them out of their cages for an hour or two every\\nday. They were very happy little creatures, and chased each other about the\\nroom, and flew on Miss Laura's head, and pecked saucily at her face as she sat\\nsewing and watching them. They were not at all afraid of me nor of Billy, and it\\nwas quite a sight to see them hopping up to Bella. She looked so large beside\\nthem.\\n\\nOne little bird became ill while Carl was away, and Miss Laura had to give it a\\ngreat deal of attention. She gave it plenty of hemp seed to make it fat, and\\nvery often the yolk of a hard boiled egg, and kept a nail in its drinking water,\\nand gave it a few drops of alcohol in its bath every morning to keep it from\\ntaking cold. The moment the bird finished taking its bath, Miss Laura took the\\ndish from the cage, for the alcohol made the water poisonous. Then vermin came\\non it; and she had to write to Carl to ask him what do. He told her to hang a\\nmuslin bag full of sulphur over the swing, so that the bird would dust it down\\non her feathers. That cured the little thing, and when Carl came home, he found\\nit quite well again. One day, just after he got back, Mrs. Montague drove up to\\nthe house with canary cage carefully done up in a shawl. She said that a bad-\\ntempered housemaid, in cleaning the cage that morning, had gotten angry with the\\nbird and struck it, breaking its leg. She was very much annoyed with the girl\\nfor her cruelty, and had dismissed her, and now she wanted Carl to take her bird\\nand nurse it, as she knew nothing. about canaries.\\n\\nCarl had just come in from school. He threw down his books, took the shawl from\\nthe cage and looked in. The poor little canary was sitting In a corner. Its eyes\\nwere half shut, one leg hung loose, and it was making faint chirps of distress.\\n\\nCarl was very much interested in it. He got Mrs. Montague to help him, and\\ntogether they split matches, tore up strips of muslin, and bandaged the broken\\nleg. He put the little bird back in the cage, and it seemed more comfortable. \\\"I\\nthink he will do now,\\\" he said to Mrs. Montague, \\\"but hadn't you better leave\\nhim with me for a few days?\\\"\\n\\nShe gladly agreed to this and went away, after telling him that the bird's name\\nwas Dick.\\n\\nThe next morning at the breakfast table, I heard Carl telling his mother that as\\nsoon as he woke up he sprang out of bed and went to see how his canary was.\\nDuring the night, poor, foolish Dick had picked off the splints from his leg,\\nand now it was as bad as ever. \\\"I shall have to perform a surgical operation.\\\"\\nhe said.\\n\\nI did not know what he meant, so I watched him when, after breakfast, he brought\\nthe bird down to his mother's room. She held it while he took a pair of sharp\\nscissors, and cut its leg right off a little way above the broken place. Then he\\nput some vaseline on the tiny stump, bound it up, and left Dick in his mother's\\ncare. All the morning, as she sat sewing, she watched him to see that he did not\\npick the bandage away.\\n\\nWhen Carl came home, Dick was so much better that he had managed to fly up on\\nhis perch, and was eating seeds quite gayly. \\\"Poor Dick!\\\" said Carl, \\\"A leg and\\na stump!\\\" Dick imitated him in a few little chirps, \\\"A leg and a stump!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, he is saying it too,\\\" exclaimed Carl, and burst out laughing.\\n\\nDick seemed cheerful enough, but it was very pitiful to see him dragging his\\npoor little stump around the cage, and resting it against the perch to keep him\\nfrom falling. When Mrs. Montague came the next day, she could not bear to look\\nat him. \\\"Oh, dear!\\\" she exclaimed, \\\"I cannot take that disfigured bird home.\\\"\\n\\nI could not help thinking how different she was from Miss Laura, who loved any\\ncreature all the more for having some blemish about it.\\n\\n\\\"What shall I do?\\\" said Mrs. Montague. \\\"I miss my little bird so much. I shall\\nhave to get a new one. Carl, will you sell me one?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will give you one, Mrs. Montague,\\\" said the boy, eagerly. \\\"I would like to do\\nso.\\\" Mrs. Morris looked pleased to hear Carl say this. She used to fear\\nsometimes, that in his love for making money, he would become selfish.\\n\\nMrs. Montague was very kind to the Morris family, and Carl seemed quite pleased\\nto do her a favor. He took her up to his room, and let her choose the bird she\\nliked best. She took a handsome, yellow one, called Barry. He was a good singer,\\nand a great favorite of Carl's. The boy put him in the cage, wrapped it up well,\\nfor it was a cold, snowy day, and carried it out to Mrs. Montague's sleigh.\\n\\nShe gave him a pleasant smile, and drove away, and Carl ran up the steps into\\nthe house. \\\"It's all right, mother,\\\" he said, giving Mrs. Morris a hearty,\\nboyish kiss, as she stood waiting for him. \\\"I don't mind letting her have it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you expected to sell that one, didn't you?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\\"Mrs. Smith said maybe she'd take it when she came home from Boston, but I dare\\nsay she'd change her mind and get one there.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How much were you going to ask for him?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I wouldn't sell Barry for less than ten dollars, or rather, I wouldn't\\nhave sold him,\\\" and he ran out to the stable.\\n\\nMrs. Morris sat on the hall chair, patting me as I rubbed against her, in rather\\nan absent minded way. Then she got up and went into her husband's study, and\\ntold him what Carl had done.\\n\\nMr. Morris seemed very pleased to hear about it, but when his wife asked him to\\ndo something to make up the loss to the boy, he said: \\\"I had rather not do that.\\nTo encourage a child to do a kind action, and then to reward him for it, is not\\nalways a sound principle to go upon.\\\"\\n\\nBut Carl did not go without his reward. That evening, Mrs. Montague's coachman\\nbrought a note to the house addressed to Mr. Carl Morris. He read it aloud to\\nthe family.\\n\\nMY DEAR CARL: I am charmed with my little bird, and he has whispered to me one\\nof the secrets of your room. You want fifteen dollars very much to buy something\\nfor it. I am sure you won't be offended with an old friend for supplying you the\\nmeans to get this something.\\n\\nADA MONTAGUE.\\n\\n\\\"Just the thing for my stationary tank for the goldfish,\\\" exclaimed Carl. \\\"I've\\nwanted it for a long time; it isn't good to keep them in globes, but how in the\\nworld did she find out? I've never told any one.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Morris smiled, and said; \\\"Barry must have told her;\\\" as she took the money\\nfrom Carl to put away for him.\\n\\nMrs. Montague got to be very fond of her new pet. She took care of him herself,\\nand I have heard her tell Mrs. Morris most wonderful stories about him stories\\nso wonderful that I should say they were not true if I did not how intelligent\\ndumb creatures get to be under kind treatment.\\n\\nShe only kept him in his cage at night, and when she began looking for him at\\nbedtime to put him there, he always hid himself. She would search a short time,\\nand then sit down, and he always came out of his hiding-place, chirping in a\\nsaucy way to make her look at him.\\n\\nShe said that he seemed to take delight in teasing her. Once when he was in the\\ndrawing-room with her, she was called away to speak to some one at the\\ntelephone. When she came back, she found that one of the servants had come into\\nthe room and left the door open leading to a veranda. The trees outside were\\nfull of yellow birds, and she was in despair, thinking that Barry had flown out\\nwith them. She looked out, but could not see him. Then, lest he had not left the\\nroom, she got a chair and carried it about, standing on it to examine the walls,\\nand see if Barry was hidden among the pictures and bric-a-brac. But no Barry was\\nthere. She at last sank down, exhausted, on a sofa. She heard a wicked, little\\npeep, and looking up, saw Barry sitting on one of the rounds of the chair that\\nshe had been carrying about to look for him. He had been there all the time. She\\nwas so glad to see him, that she never thought of scolding him.\\n\\nHe was never allowed to fly about the dining room during meals, and the table\\nmaid drove him out before she set the table. It always annoyed him, and he\\nperched on the staircase, watching the door through the railings. If it was left\\nopen for an instant, he flew in. One evening, before tea, he did this. There was\\na chocolate cake on the sideboard, and he liked the look of it so much that he\\nbegan to peck at it. Mrs. Montague happened to come in, and drove him back to\\nthe hall.\\n\\nWhile she was having tea that evening, with her husband and little boy, Barry\\nflew into the room again. Mrs. Montague told Charlie to send him out, but her\\nhusband said, \\\"Wait, he is looking for something.\\\"\\n\\nHe was on the sideboard, peering into every dish, and trying to look under the\\ncovers. \\\"He is after the chocolate cake,\\\" exclaimed Mrs. Montague. \\\"Here,\\nCharlie; put this on the staircase for him.\\\"\\n\\nShe cut off a little scrap, and when Charlie took it to the hall, Barry flew\\nafter him, and ate it up.\\n\\nAs for poor, little, lame Dick, Carl never sold him, and he became a family pet.\\nHis cage hung in the parlor, and from morning till night his cheerful voice was\\nheard, chirping and singing as if he had not a trouble in the world. They took\\ngreat care of him. He was never allowed to be too hot or too cold. Everybody\\ngave him a cheerful word in passing his cage, and if his singing was too loud,\\nthey gave him a little mirror to look at himself in. He loved this mirror, and\\noften stood before it for an hour at a time.\\n\\nCHAPTER XII MALTA THE CAT\\n\\nTHE first time I had a good look at the Morris cat, I thought she was the\\nqueerest-looking animal I had ever seen. She was dark gray just the color of a\\nmouse. Her eyes were a yellowish green, and for the first few days I was at the\\nMorrises' they looked very unkindly at me. Then she got over her dislike and we\\nbecame very good friends. She was a beautiful cat, and so gentle and\\naffectionate that the whole family loved her.\\n\\nShe was three years old, and she had come to Fairport in a vessel with some\\nsailors, who had gotten her in a far-away place. Her name was Malta, and she was\\ncalled a maltese cat.\\n\\nI have seen a great many cats, but I never saw one as kind as Malta. Once she\\nhad some little kittens and they all died. It almost broke her heart. She cried\\nand cried about the house till it made one feel sad to hear her. Then she ran\\naway to the woods. She came back with a little squirrel in her mouth, and\\nputting it in her basket, she nursed it like a mother, till it grew old enough\\nto run away from her.\\n\\nShe was a very knowing cat, and always came when she was called. Miss Laura used\\nto wear a little silver whistle that she blew when she wanted any of her pets.\\nIt was a shrill whistle, and we could hear it a long way from home. I have seen\\nher standing at the back door whistling for Malta. and the pretty creature's\\nhead would appear somewhere always high up, for she was a great climber, and she\\nwould come running along the top of the fence, saying, \\\"Meow, meow,\\\" in a funny,\\nshort way.\\n\\nMiss Laura would pet her, or give her something to eat, or walk around the\\ngarden carrying her on her shoulder. Malta was a most affectionate cat, and if\\nMiss Laura would not let her lick her face, she licked her hair with her little,\\nrough tongue. Often Malta lay by the fire, licking my coat or little Billy's, to\\nshow her affection for us.\\n\\nMary, the cook, was very fond of cats, and used to keep Malta in the kitchen as\\nmuch as she could, but nothing would make her stay down there if there was any\\nmusic going on upstairs. The Morris pets were all fond of music. As soon as Miss\\nLaura sat down to the piano to sing or play, we came from all parts of the\\nhouse. Malta cried to get upstairs, Davy scampered through the hall, and Bella\\nhurried after him. If I was outdoors I ran in the house; and Jim got on a box\\nand looked through the window.\\n\\nDavy's place was on Miss Laura's shoulder, his pink nose run in the curls at the\\nback of her neck. I sat under the piano beside Malta and Bella, and we never\\nstirred till the music was over; then we went quietly away.\\n\\nMalta was a beautiful cat there was no doubt about it. While I was with Jenkins\\nI thought cats were vermin, like rats, and I chased them every chance I got.\\nMrs. Jenkins had a cat, a gaunt, long-legged, yellow creature, that ran whenever\\nwe looked at it.\\n\\nMalta had been so kindly treated that she never ran from any one, except from\\nstrange dogs. She knew they would be likely to hurt her. If they came upon her\\nsuddenly, she faced them, and she was a pretty good fighter when she was put to\\nit. I once saw her having a brush with a big mastiff that lived a few blocks\\nfrom us, and giving him good fright; which just served him right.\\n\\nI was shut up in the parlor. Some one had closed the door, and I could not get\\nout. I was watching Malta from the window, as she daintily picked her way across\\nthe muddy street. She was such a soft, pretty, amiable-looking cat. She didn't\\nlook that way, though, when the mastiff rushed out of the alleyway at her.\\n\\nShe sprang back and glared at him like a little, fierce tiger. Her tail was\\nenormous. Her eyes were like balls of fire, and she was spitting and snarling,\\nas if to say, \\\"If you touch me, I'll tear you to pieces!\\\"\\n\\nThe dog, big as he was, did not dare attack her. He walked around and around,\\nlike a great clumsy elephant, and she turned her small body as he turned his,\\nand kept up a dreadful hissing and spitting. Suddenly I saw a Spitz dog hurrying\\ndown the street. He was going to help the mastiff, and Malta would be badly\\nhurt. I had barked and no one had come to let me out, so I sprang through the\\nwindow.\\n\\nJust then there was a change. Malta had seen the second dog, and she knew she\\nmust get rid of the mastiff. With an agile bound she sprang on his back, dug her\\nsharp claws in, till he put his tail between his legs and ran up the street,\\nhowling with palm She rode a little way, then sprang off, and ran up the lane to\\nthe stable.\\n\\nI was very angry and wanted to fight something so I pitched into the Spitz dog.\\nHe was a snarly, cross-grained creature, no friend to Jim and me, and he would\\nhave been only too glad of a chance to help kill Malta.\\n\\nI gave him one of the worst beatings he ever had. I don't suppose it was quite\\nright for me to do it, for Miss Laura says dogs should never fight; but he had\\nworried Malta before, and he had no business to do it. She belonged to our\\nfamily. Jim and I never worried his cat. I had been longing to give him a\\nshaking for some time, and now I felt for his throat through his thick hair and\\ndragged him all around the street. Then I let him go, and he was a civil dog\\never afterward\\n\\nMalta was very grateful, and licked a little place where the Spitz bit me. I did\\nnot get scolded for the broken window. Mary had seen from the kitchen window,\\nand told Mrs. Morris that I had gone to help Malta.\\n\\nMalta was a very wise cat. She knew quite well that she must not harm the parrot\\nnor the canaries, and she never tried to catch them, even though she was left\\nalone in the room with them.\\n\\nI have seen her lying in the sun, blinking sleepily, and listening with great\\npleasure to Dick's singing. Miss Laura even taught her not to hunt the birds\\noutside.\\n\\nFor a long time she had tried to get it into Malta's head that it was cruel to\\ncatch the little sparrows that came about the door, and just after I came, she\\nsucceeded in doing so.\\n\\nMalta was so fond of Miss Laura, that whenever she caught a bird, she came and\\nlaid it at her feet. Miss Laura always picked up the little, dead creature,\\npitied it and stroked it, and scolded Malta till she crept into a corner. Then\\nMiss Laura put the bird on a limb of a tree, and Malta watched her attentively\\nfrom her corner.\\n\\nOne day Miss Laura stood at the window, looking out into the garden. Malta was\\nlying on the platform, staring at the sparrows that were picking up crumbs from\\nthe ground. She trembled, and half rose every few minutes, as if to go after\\nthem. Then she lay down again. She was trying very hard not to creep on them.\\nPresently a neighbor's cat came stealing along the fence, keeping one eye on\\nMalta and the other on the sparrows. Malta was so angry! She sprang up and\\nchased her away, and then came back to the platform, where she lay down again\\nand waited for the sparrows to come back. For a long time she stayed there, and\\nnever once tried to catch them.\\n\\nMiss Laura was so pleased. She went to the door, and said, softly, \\\"Come here,\\nMalta.\\\"\\n\\nThe cat put up her tail, and, meowing gently, came into the house. Miss Laura\\ntook her up in her arms, and going down to the kitchen, asked Mary to give her a\\nsaucer of her very sweetest milk for the best cat in the United States of\\nAmerica.\\n\\nMalta got great praise for this, and I never knew of her catching a bird\\nafterward. She was well fed in the house, and had no need to hurt such harmless\\ncreatures.\\n\\nShe was very fond of her home, and never went far away, as Jim and I did. Once,\\nwhen Willie was going to spend a few weeks with a little friend who lived fifty\\nmiles from Fairport, he took it into his head that Malta should go with him. His\\nmother told him that cats did not like to go away from home; but he said he\\nwould be good to her, and begged so hard to take her, that at last his mother\\nconsented.\\n\\nHe had been a few days in this place, when he wrote home to say that Malta had\\nrun away. She had seemed very unhappy, and though he had kept her with him all\\nthe time, she had acted as if she wanted to get away.\",\"timestamp\":1640140463,\"title\":\"\\nSoon we came to a shop, and Miss Laura went in to buy some ribbons. \"},\"digest\":\"P8Vvwd5qU20zXkmDXXqOx0b4fGpuc0JippoH5nxSx-g\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6e5524266431C8A2Cd3e28b5B838834791C3533a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0bGXHd-NijXed1oF4XnJZQFNYf_uHHiu36OzQDodmmg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"9k4ub3_PTbrNGLlX5wpWrxU5ZnsCEjHBPUFIMoe2Mfs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"d8_L4ZqiaWdxYZE5Mp2SSU2hiWtzmZIBjfR5ezjlWdD8zuDUZw26ZLpKuu92jXdF-hMX6CzHO8Xpn1RB94kdTg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9998f11585458894679315dbfe2a9b3c016d4c89f5309abc24c8b8eb68e411df36e88ae649864a8210b0ef889e80316a91c4c3e35b913767b51714221aa84adf1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0bGXHd-NijXed1oF4XnJZQFNYf_uHHiu36OzQDodmmg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"9k4ub3_PTbrNGLlX5wpWrxU5ZnsCEjHBPUFIMoe2Mfs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"P8Vvwd5qU20zXkmDXXqOx0b4fGpuc0JippoH5nxSx-g\"}"
