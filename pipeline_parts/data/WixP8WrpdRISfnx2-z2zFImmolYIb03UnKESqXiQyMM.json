"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"2921 The Belt \\n  \\n Odysseus, King of Ithaca, condemned by oath to a long war on the windy plains of Troy, went to a trusted friend to watch over his son, Telemachus. Mentor was made of many people, including Athena in disguise, Goddess of Science, Strategy and the Sword. Mentor was the ultimate protector and surrogate father for the boy.\\n\\nAlmost 20 years ago, January 2X01, Outer Jupiter space proper:\\n\\n\\\"We don't have a lot of time left little brother.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We have to hurry, there's just enough time Jacob.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Okay then. Take little Jakey. Suit up Al.\\\"\\n\\nAl cradled Jacob Tagore, Sr. head, in his lap and held his hand. Jacob's legs were broken but that wasn't the problem. There wasn't enough time to treat the internal injuries. Al didn't even have the right nanos or stims. No time. But there was enough time to do one thing.\\n\\n\\\"Al. You have to mind the store now without me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm going. Back when Dr. Cadmus left me with you. Jacob, thank...\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Shut up bro. Get your nephew and go.\\\"\\n\\nDr. Cadmus had left the closest thing he had to a son with a group of adventurers, the Tagores. They became Al's family. Al was special but they didn't ask questions. Alep-H became Al Tagore.\\n\\nAl didn't stop to ask permission. He put his hands on Jacob Sr.'s head and pressed lightly. After some weak resistance, Jacob Sr.'s eyes glazed over.\\n\\nAl held Jacob's head a moment longer and then gently rested him on the floor. The ship was shaking, the air tasted burnt and foul. Al suited up. Jake Jr. was crying. Al scooped him up in his arms.\\n\\n\\\"Okay Jakey, I got you. I got you.\\\"\\n\\nThe Present, March 2X21, Asteroid Ring - Starward edge:\\n\\nThe tumbling deepship was stabilizing. A giant asteroid hollowed out into a deepship, finally stopped tumbling like crazy. Systems online slow but the worst was over. Jacob Chinua Tagore, Jr.'s vitals were off the charts as he freefell inside a ship the size of a large city. Al went out with a drone.\\n\\n\\\"Al, where are the hell are you?!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Relax nephew, I got you.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1633969065,\"title\":\"2921: 3.3 Mentor's Mission, 2901 and 2921 Spring\"},\"digest\":\"T-p9dL0PQ5N10CTZSOQMuqtlmJGFyGrbQQlPzGzF8QI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"bo2hfuteedpaTTcAG78F8v1LZIkcby8zhMR3gy_jtyn-TG3RBM6V7hC8TTilrWViYXQoA2-rsU-dk-0RD7VUGg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"UwX3EOCTDluVUgS7REyIqvtAD9ZJrIsPiNfhzJIbIOA\"}"
