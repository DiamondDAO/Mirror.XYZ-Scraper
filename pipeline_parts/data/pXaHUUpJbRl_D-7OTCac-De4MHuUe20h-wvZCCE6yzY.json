He has other priorities.\\n\\n\\\"My dream is to win another Champions League,\\\" he said at his unveiling in August, with the last of his four European Cups coming in 2015.\\n\\nThen there is the really big one: the World Cup in Qatar will be underway this time next year and Messi will be 35 by then.\\n\\nThat will surely be his last chance to win the greatest trophy of all, and you imagine he would swap his seven Ballons d'Or to get his hands on it.\\n\\n**Lewan's consolation**\\n\\nDespite Messi's Copa America success and impressive scoring stats, there was a feeling that this year might produce a different winner.\\n\\nPoland striker Lewandowski would have been a certainty to win in 2020, when he scored 45 goals in 37 games for Bayern, only for the awards to be canceled.\\n\\nHe ended last season with a remarkable 41 Bundesliga goals but had to settle for second place in the voting for the Ballon d'Or, which is organized by France Football magazine and voted for by a panel of journalists from around the world.\\n\\nLewandowski instead was given a consolation prize for the year's best goal scorer and received glowing praise from Messi.\\n\\n\\\"I wanted to say to Robert that it was an honor to go up against him. He deserved to win it last year,\\\" Messi said.\\n\\nMidfielder Jorginho, who won the Champions League with Chelsea and Euro 2020 with Italy, came third, followed by Real Madrid's Karim Benzema and another Chelsea player, N'Golo Kante.\\n\\nFive-time winner Cristiano Ronaldo came sixth. He was absent from the ceremony.\\n\\nBetween them, Messi and Ronaldo have won 12 of the last 13 editions of the Ballon d'Or with the exception coming in 2018 when Luka Modric claimed the prize.\\n\\n**Putellas reigns**\\n\\nThis is just the third year that a women's Ballon d'Or has been awarded, with Putellas following in the footsteps of Norway's Ada Hegerberg, winner in 2018, and the United States' 2019 World Cup superstar Megan Rapinoe.\\n\\nSpain international Putellas, 27, captained Barcelona to victory in this year's Champions League, scoring a penalty in the final as her side hammered Chelsea 4-0.\\n\\nShe also won a Spanish league and cup double with Barca, the club she joined as a teenager in 2012 and which is fast becoming the dominant force in the women's game.\\n\\nHer Barcelona and Spain teammate Jennifer Hermoso was second, with Sam Kerr of Chelsea and Australia coming third.\",\"timestamp\":1638367713,\"title\":\"Messi's enduring brilliance edges the chasing pack\"},\"digest\":\"QNoQ8BlCVKptVVG_QeRoGNJwdJDUWpb_BZa0oZwEYkk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xadd86165A3caA9B1FbC066E3E0a1bA0a591F4058\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ApWMog4w35pke5d96UpYbwcAr3UXJ9afdZLpFyDugeY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"fPtABOuzX7gbrmHztNXME-5-zO2JmvqxEswBTxMFp7M\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"8cMaIMqa8p4YSPsrbUCaeTAc_0GlLlCNmZnMhlsLpyDOGrDvyZonGOZmqAOFMeD4WfEFwOaypPTA4VJyzIz1Jg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8544c625231244ec9b1f23cd57a2ad1a7dd3146d2fbaa6b97d5bc732d01dfc186330fbe3037852f0e873ac1bc0755e30c8fd1d9e797314da248a43ada60938791b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ApWMog4w35pke5d96UpYbwcAr3UXJ9afdZLpFyDugeY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"fPtABOuzX7gbrmHztNXME-5-zO2JmvqxEswBTxMFp7M\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"QNoQ8BlCVKptVVG_QeRoGNJwdJDUWpb_BZa0oZwEYkk\"}"
