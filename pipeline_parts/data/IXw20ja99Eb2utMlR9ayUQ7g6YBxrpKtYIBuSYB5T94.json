"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Don't judge others or yourself.\\\" - Wu Jing\\n\\nOf all the ancient civilizations that have exerted an important influence in world history, only the Chinese civilization has a long and unbroken history. Because of this, Chinese culture not only survived tenaciously, but also evolved and developed in the long history, becoming a constantly developing cultural form. The evolution and development of Chinese traditional thought, which is at the core of culture, has always been fascinating.\\n\\nWhether it is the pre-Qin dynasty, or the two And Han Classics and Wei and Jin Metaphysics, all kinds of cultural changes are always amazing and thinking. In general, traditional Chinese thoughts have always reflected the independent thinking of the ancients on nature, society and life. For example, human nature and the way of heaven, Yin and Yang and the five elements, knowledge and action, etc. Up to now, some sayings handed down from our ancestors can still reflect the connotation of Traditional Chinese thought.\\n\\nSo, what is the meaning of the saying, \\\"Three things under the bed make a home run dry\\\"? What does 3 things refer to?\\n\\nIn geomantic metaphysics, sundries affect people's air transport is relatively large. Keeping clutter under the bed can have a significant impact not only on the individual, but on the family as a whole. After all, in the family, the bed is the place where people rest, no matter to the individual, or to the family, is a very important position.\\n\\nOnce the bed is placed under the words of sundries, it is likely to hinder the family's air transport, so that the whole family is in a state of bad luck. Over time, the whole family will naturally decline and the population will naturally fail to thrive.\\n\\nOf course, although this view is more metaphysical, but from the point of view of science, also have certain truth actually. For example, clutter under your bed can be a breeding ground for bacteria over time, especially if it's wet inside the room on a rainy day. As a result, people who are resting in bed can easily breathe in the bacteria, which can cause respiratory problems and so on.\\n\\nAccordingly, when receiving a few articles below the bed, must notice wholesome cleanness, lest appear this kind of circumstance. Especially in the case of the elderly and children in the home, more attention should be paid to this aspect of the problem. Otherwise, it is easy to cause irreparable consequences.\\n\\nBelow the bed besides cannot place sundry besides, the article that the 2nd cannot place is medicaments. In feng shui metaphysics, medicine is often associated with disease. If the medication is kept under the bed, it can have a great impact on the health of the individual.\\n\\nMany people may feel particularly comfortable sleeping on the bed. Over time, it will form a kind of dependence, and everything will be conveniently placed under the bed, even medicine. But obviously, doesn't keeping drugs under the bed mean sleeping on the \\\"disease\\\"? Such a situation, from the psychological point of view is difficult to accept.\\n\\nOn top of that, as mentioned earlier, if the bed is wet, medications can become moldy over time. In this way, the drug is likely to become ineffective and become a \\\"deadly poison\\\". Once taken, it can have serious consequences.\\n\\nEspecially if you have young children in the house, they like to crawl around, and if they scrape the medicine out from under the bed and eat it in their mouth, the consequences may be unacceptable. Therefore, if there are medications in the house, it is best to put them in the appropriate place, not under the bed.\\n\\nSo, where does it fit? If it is for children, it is usually placed in the northeast corner of the room because of its mild nature. Of course, the best place to place a little higher, out of the reach of children.\\n\\nIf it's for adults, keep it in a desk drawer or cabinet. Usually, it doesn't affect the family.\\n\\nIn addition to the above items can not be put under the bed, there is one thing must not be put under the bed, that is iron. For the ancients, in the geomantic metaphysics, iron is evil, if it is placed under the bed, then it is bound to be a lot of evil spirits, so that the rest of the bed is very unfriendly.\\n\\nFor example, cleavers, scissors and other sharp iron implements were all ominous objects to ancient people. If placed under the bed, it will bring disaster to the whole family and eventually lead to the destruction of the family. Therefore, if you want people to thrive, there must be no iron under the bed.\\n\\nIn fact, from a scientific point of view, there is some truth to this. Because the human body itself is a magnetic field, and the earth is a big magnetic field. When you sleep at night, it's best to sleep north or south because it's aligned with the earth's magnetic field.\\n\\nIf iron is placed under the bed, the magnetic field of the iron will affect or destroy the magnetic field of the human body. In this way, over time the body will naturally appear all kinds of problems. In the end, there is a good chance of a family defeat.\\n\\nThis shows, the iron in the home had better be able to collect rise to put outside the room, at least cannot be put under the bed, otherwise affect the area magnetic field of family not only, still can affect the magnetic field of individual body. Therefore, from this point of view, it is not unreasonable for the ancients to say that iron is evil.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, in family geomantic medium, the position of the bed is very important. Accordingly, a few articles cannot be placed below the bed. Because of this, our ancestors left the saying, \\\"If there are three things under the bed, the family will be ruined.\\\" Obviously, this is the ancients to nature and human nature of a cognitive result.\\n\\nWhen it comes to geomantic metaphysics, what most people think of is probably feudal superstition. Think that all kinds of views are feudal old ideas, many people in geomantic layout basically do not pay attention to. You don't really care where you can't put things in your bedroom, how you put your bed, etc.\\n\\nIn fact, this is a normal social development to the present. After all, for most people today, hard work trumps everything else. For example, if you want to make a fortune, feng shui is not reliable, or you have to rely on your own efforts. With such an idea in mind, it is natural not to care about feng shui layouts.\",\"timestamp\":1638763345,\"title\":\"What is the meaning of the saying, \\\"There are three things under the bed, and the family is ruined.\\\" What are three of them\"},\"digest\":\"C0YxQpAMpkTOTPNR1qQoh04C0p3CM1jrIxJhhEStm2Q\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x29510517F49fe5d6b5C9EA410217186641E98A18\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RVQ8a9qPgJ3NvSUXYNIT_h6tEfJ6I9vVYYng0lKxwRc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"PeFx0lCQ5f7xxhduzwTiq6RXdafK17v2VDMtX9jX_Ps\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"CwtOa_hh62EBkuPIJl5dyE-zZACKp_RlAkBxAP8Cnims-VGb_guCcMyAPZIuTKGpSzSyA7QciG1o7eTGnfxBeg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x055bda71e173aec1d85783046b42f3b562183c545e8f005b74c5811e66db585202f7a8f73855d0d8e07d902f6835caa714e2d9b6b4e512e422ba04705c21b5ad1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RVQ8a9qPgJ3NvSUXYNIT_h6tEfJ6I9vVYYng0lKxwRc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"PeFx0lCQ5f7xxhduzwTiq6RXdafK17v2VDMtX9jX_Ps\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"C0YxQpAMpkTOTPNR1qQoh04C0p3CM1jrIxJhhEStm2Q\"}"
