"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"there was so much of it that the hum of voices sounded like a wind blowing through a forest.\\n\\nCoke spun suddenly and said something to Nora Black. Nora laughed rather loudly, and then the two turned squarely and the Wainwright party contemplated  what were surely at that time the two most insolent  backs in the world.\\n\\nThe professor looked as if he might be going to have a fit. Mrs. Wainwright lifted her eyes toward heaven, and flinging out her trembling hands, cried: \\\" Oh, what an outrage. What an outrage! That minx-\\\" The concensus of opinion in the first carriage  was perfectly expressed by Peter Tounley, who with a deep drawn breath, said : \\\" Well, I'm damned! \\\" Marjory had moaned and lowered her head as from a sense of complete personal shame. Coleman lit his cigar and mounted his horse. \\\" Well, I suppose there is nothing for it but to be off, professor? \\\" His tone was full of regret, with sort of poetic regret. For a moment the professor looked at him blankly, and then gradually recovered part of his usual manner. \\\" Yes,\\\" he said sadly, \\\" there is nothing for it but to go on.\\\" At a word from the dragoman, the two impatient drivers spoke gutturally to their horses and the car- riages whirled out of Arta. Coleman, his dragoman and the groom trotted in the dust from the wheels of the Wainwright carriage. The correspondent always found his reflective faculties improved by the constant pounding of a horse on the trot, and he was not sorry to have now a period for reflection, as well as this  artificial stimulant. As he viewed the game he had in his hand about all the cards that were valuable. In fact, he considered that the only ace against him was Mrs. Wainwright. He had always regarded her as a stupid person, concealing herself behind a mass of trivialities which were all conventional, but he thought now that the more stupid she was and the more conventional in her triviality the more she approached to being the very ace of trumps itself. She was just the sort of a card that would come upon the table mid the neat play of experts and by some inexplicable arrangement of circumstance, lose a whole game for the wrong man. After Mrs. Wainwright he worried over the students.  He believed them to be reasonable enough; in fact, he honoured them distinctly in regard to their powers of reason, but he knew that people generally hated a row. It, put them off their balance, made them sweat over a lot of pros and cons, and prevented them from thinking for a time at least only of themselves.  Then they came to resent the principals in a row. Of course the principal, who was thought to be in the wrong, was the most rescnted, but Coleman be- lieved that, after all, people always came to resent the other principal, or at least be impatient and suspicious  of him. If he was a correct person, why was he in a row at all? The principal who had been in the right often brought this impatience and suspicion upon himself, no doubt, by never letting the matter end, continuing to yawp about his virtuous suffering, and not allowing people to return to the steady  contemplation of their own affairs. As a precautionary measure he decided to say nothing at all about the late trouble, unless some one addressed him upon it. Even then he would be serenely laconic. He felt that he must be popular with the seven students. In the first place, it was nice that in the presence of Marjory they should like him, and in the second place he feared to displease them as a body because he believed that he had some dignity. Hoodlums are seldom dangerous to other hoodlums, but if they catch  pomposity alone in the field, pomposity is their prey. They tear him to mere bloody ribbons, amid heartless shrieks. When Coleman put himself on the same basis with the students, he could cope with them easily, but he did not want the wild pack after him when Marjory could see the chase. And so be rea- soned that his best attitude was to be one of rather taciturn serenity.\\n\\nOn the hard military road the hoofs of the horses made such clatter that it was practically impossible to hold talk between the carriages and the horsemen without all parties bellowing. The professor, how- ever, strove to overcome the difficulties. He was  apparently undergoing a great amiability toward  Coleman. Frequently he turned with a bright face, and pointing to some object in the landscape, obviously tried to convey something entertaining to Coleman's mind. Coleman could see his lips mouth the words. He always nodded cheerily in answer and yelled.\\n\\nThe road ultimately became that straight lance-handle  which Coleman-it seemed as if many years had passed-had traversed with his dragoman and the funny little carriers. He was fixing in his mind a possible story to the Wainwrights about the snake and his first dead Turk. But suddenly the carriages left this road and began a circuit of the Gulf of Arta, winding about an endless series of promontories. The journey developed into an excess of dust whirling from a road, which half circled the waist of cape after cape. All dramatics were lost in the rumble of wheels and in the click of hoofs. They passed a little soldier leading a prisoner by a string. They passed more frightened peasants, who seemed resolved to flee down into the very boots of Greece. And people looked at them with scowls, envying them their speed. At the little town from which Coleman embarked at one stage of the upward journey, they found crowds in the streets. There was no longer any laughter, any confidence, any vim. All the spirit of the visible Greek nation seemed to have been knocked out of it in two blows. But still they talked and never ceased talking. Coleman noticed that the most curious changes had come upon them since his journey to the frontier. They no longer approved of foreigners. They seemed to blame the travellers for something which had  transpired in the past few days. It was not that they really blamed the travellers for the nation's calamity: It was simply that their minds were half stunned by the news of defeats, and, not thinking for a moment to blame themselves, or even not thinking to attribute the defeats to mere numbers and skill, they were  savagely eager to fasten it upon something near enough at hand for the operation of vengeance.\\n\\nColeman perceived that the dragoman, all his former plumage gone, was whining and snivelling as he argued to a dark-browed crowd that was running beside the cavalcade. The groom, who always had been a  miraculously laconic man, was suddenly launched forth  garrulously. The, drivers, from their high seats, palavered like mad men, driving with oat hand and gesturing with the other, explaining evidently their own great innocence.\\n\\nColeman saw that there was trouble, but he only sat more stiffly in his saddle. The eternal gabble moved him to despise the situation. At any rate, the travellers would soon be out of this town and on to a more sensible region.\\n\\nHowever he saw the driver of the first carriage sud- denly pull up boforg a little blackened coffee shop and inn. The dragman spurred forward and began wild expostulation. The second carriage pulled close behind  the other. The crowd, murmuring like a Roman mob in  Nero's time, closed around them.\\n\\n.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI.\\n\\nCOLEMAN pushed his horse coolly through to the dragoman;s side. \\\" What is it ? \\\" he demanded. The dragoman was broken-voiced. \\\" These peoples, they say you are Germans, all Germans, and they are angry,\\\" he wailed. \\\" I can do nossing-nossing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Well, tell these men to drive on,\\\" said Coleman, \\\"tell them theymust drive on.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" They will not drive on,\\\" wailed the dragoman, still more loudly. \\\" I can do nossing. They say here is place for feed the horse. It is the custom and they will note drive on.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Make them drive on.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" They will note,\\\" shrieked the agonised servitor. Coleman looked from the men waving their arms and chattering on the box-seats to the men of the crowd who also waved their arms and chattered. In this throng far to the rear of the fighting armies there did not seem to be a single man who was not  ablebodied, who had not been free to enlist as a soldier. They were of that scurvy behind-the-rear-guard which every nation has in degree proportionate to its worth. The manhood of Greece had gone to the frontier, leaving at home this rabble of talkers, most of whom were armed with rifles for mere pretention. Coleman loathed them to the end of his soul. He thought them a lot of infants who would like to prove their courage upon eleven innocent travellers, all but  unarmed, and in this fact he was quick to see a great danger to the Wainwright party. One could deal with soldiers; soldiers would have been ashamed to bait helpless people ; but this rabble-\\n\\nThe fighting blood of the correspondent began to boil, and he really longed for the privilege to run amuck through the multitude. But a look at the Wainwrights kept him in his senses. The professor had turned pale as a dead man. He sat very stiff and still while his wife clung to him, hysterically beseeching  him to do something, do something, although what he was to do she could not have even imagined.\\n\\nColeman took the dilemma by its beard. He  dismounted from his horse into the depths of the crowd and addressed the Wainwrights. \\\" I suppose we had better go into this place and have some coffee while the men feed their horses. There is no use in trying to make them go on.\\\" His manner was fairly casual, but they looked at him in glazed horror. \\\" It is the only thing to do. This crowd is not nearly so bad as they think they are. But we've got to look as if we felt confident.\\\" He himself had no confidence with this angry buzz in his ears, but be felt certain that the only correct move was to get everybody as quickly as possible within the shelter of the inn. It might not be much of a shelter for them, but it was better than the carriages in the street.\\n\\nThe professor and Mrs. Wainwright seemed to be considering their carriage as a castle, and they looked as if their terror had made them physically incapable of leaving it. Coleman stood waiting. Behind him the clapper-tongued crowd was moving ominously. Marjory arose and stepped calmly down to him. He thrilled to the end of every nerve. It was as if she had said: \\\" I don't think there is great danger, but if there is great danger, why \\\\* \\\\* here I am \\\\* ready \\\\* with you.\\\" It conceded everything, admitted everything. It was a surrender without a blush, and it was only possible in the shadow of the crisis when they did not know what the next moments might contain for them. As he took her hand and she stepped past him he whispered swiftly and fiercely in her ear, \\\" I love you.\\\" She did not look up, but he felt that in this quick incident they had claimed each other, accepted each other with a far deeper meaning and understanding than could be possible in a mere drawing-room. She laid her hand on his arm, and with the strength of four men he twisted his horse into the making of furious prancing side-steps toward the door of the inn, clanking side- steps which mowed a wide lane through the crowd for Marjory, his Marjory. He was as haughty as a new German lieutenant, and although he held the fuming horse with only his left hand, he seemed perfectly capable of hurling the animal over a house without calling into service the arm which was devoted to Marjory.\\n\\nIt was not an exhibition of coolness such as wins applause on the stage when the hero placidly lights a cigarette before the mob which is clamouring for his death. It was, on the contrary, an exhibition of downright classic disdain, a disdain which with the highest arrogance declared itself in every glance of his eye into the faces about him. \\\" Very good \\\\* \\\\* attack me if you like \\\\* \\\\* there is nothing to prevent it \\\\* \\\\* you mongrels.\\\" Every step of his progress was made a renewed insult to them. The very air was charged with what this lone man was thinking of this threatening crowd.\\n\\nHis audacity was invincible. They actually made way for it as quickly as children would flee from a ghost. The horse, dancing; with ringing steps, with his glistening neck arched toward the iron hand at his bit, this powerful, quivering animal was a regular  engine of destruction, and they gave room until Coleman halted him -at an exclamation from Marjory.\\n\\n\\\" My mother and father.\\\" But they were coming close behind and Coleman resumed this contemptuous journey to the door of the inn. The groom, with his new-born tongue, was clattering there to the populace. Coleman gave him the horse and passed after the Wainwrights into the public room of the inn. He was smiling. What simpletons!\\n\\nA new actor suddenly appeared in the person of the keeper of the inn. He too had a rifle and a prodigious belt of cartridges, but it was plain at once that he had elected to be a friend of the worried travellers. A large part of the crowd were thinking it necessary to enter the inn and pow-wow more. But the innkeeper stayed at the door with the dragoman, and together they vociferously held back the tide. The spirit of the mob had subsided to a more reasonable feeling. They no longer wished to tear the strangers limb from limb on the suspicion that they were Germans. They now were frantic to talk as if some inexorable law had kept them silent for ten years and this was the very moment of their release. Whereas, their simul- taneous and interpolating orations had throughout made noise much like a coal-breaker. Coleman led the Wainwrights to a table in a far part of the room. They took chairs as if he had com- manded them. \\\" What an outrage,\\\" he said jubilantly. \\\" The apes.\\\" He was keeping more than half an eye upon the door, because he knew that the quick coming  of the students was important.\",\"timestamp\":1638928817,\"title\":\"\\nThe advice which came from the carriage was all in one direction\"},\"digest\":\"_5O29V834Wy72QLCB4yU4hX6IS6XvBn6Dmh93ifUNBA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x601114c3e2cfa182D83a451a3c41d4e615b07E56\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fa0HdaXzWPUhGscAiBq6ycK0XBHo6UprhL9qSA726XI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"slfNZBgJCpG_IwCM5XCdK8KBYYifrM1B8UTBJUz9LHU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"rW5jj1wXd8QWECEx1AC59SDq2jYv7eBOlGcu5GVOJqE8A4HNp5RgyJ8qS777KZS7GGAHRAGR4YfMLyLbmNAC6w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4296ef85e9c646f336da0c8e81552c27184c3a2773f84fdde6c329ce54c498cc504b858719d03132b047039ef425a2b83b3db4720b364ce0665b565a87742cc11b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fa0HdaXzWPUhGscAiBq6ycK0XBHo6UprhL9qSA726XI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"slfNZBgJCpG_IwCM5XCdK8KBYYifrM1B8UTBJUz9LHU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"_5O29V834Wy72QLCB4yU4hX6IS6XvBn6Dmh93ifUNBA\"}"
