"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"PirateDAO is a novel DAO with two primary mandates:\\n\\n1. Think, design, develop and deploy NFT-related dApps, across chains, with a focus on products sitting at the intersection of the NFTs and DeFi ecosystems\\n2. Build PirateDAO itself into a long-lasting decentralized organization that can guarantees funding its own operations, through smart treasury management (such as re-investing revenues from previously shipped products)\\n\\nPirateDAO wants to be different from many DAOs that have come before it. To date, DAOs have mostly been synonymous with a treasury of funds + group signal-voting on where to send those funds; with very little input from communities on the kind products that are to be built, or on the development direction for existing ones. PirateDAO aims to achieve something more fun and valuable: **a fully decentralized organization that  ships new products**.\\n\\nToday, following up right away on our own motto, we are releasing Programmable Loot on Polygon (more on this below), along with our completely fair-launched initial offering for **JollyRoger** (üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è), PirateDAO governance and only token; with a soft-capped, **ultra-scarce supply of 818 units made available for minting by partecipating in our first product**.\\n\\nProgrammable Loot (or pLOOT) is a big upgrade over the concept of scarce, general-purpose, on-chain loot metadata originally introduced by [dom](https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1431316631934967815) in multiple variants, that inspired many of us in the Ethereum community and naturally spurred derivatives and tooling to augment the project. \\n\\nIn pLOOT there are Loot Containers and Loot Items, the latter is what can be valuable (e.g. based on their rarity, or usefulness in a particular application or game) but can only be obtained by minting the former; in other words, you will need to generate and claim (mint) Loot Containers (there are 8 classes of them, with different properties), in order to mint Loot Items.\\n\\n**Minting containers is a two-step process:** \\n\\n* First, you request a ContainerGenesis event, in exchange for that container class mint floor price; besides reserving the container for yourself, this will initiate a Chainlink VRF request that will eventually seed (usually within a few blocks) and permanently associate your container with a truly random genesis seed\\n* Second, and only after the Chainlink VRF oracle will have fulfilled the randomness, the container is ready to be claimed and any Loot Items inside it unveiled (and also minted in the process); initially these will be owned by the LootContainer contract itself\",\"timestamp\":1635330548,\"title\":\"PirateDAO: Initial NFTs Offering and Programmable Loot\"},\"digest\":\"JSp9-yk8M70Opi_YEF7U_NBDh3iqwb4Pl2-9QFv3VKw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x08F55ce05312d79B7525AB70BfF689ee48b2b53C\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"e5I7GZ-HYAk5jd5VdUsy6T_ydl6VKTAKsLzuuHA58Wo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"WE2gwmJRF5EJt5EIjJsiLyNgUbUfHLLrBgv-qHlZd2o\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"E8DnQ01GbMHBsTPuyBhT6XEe40UZiUgVef9huunMiSGtF9xYB1SoKTL4SlnxJL7z-vuI1QHHMKARDgt5j8duqA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x49885ba2e5842c236aa1430bca1c5c21bf989eef462f1d43976211dbd870412c18c30521cc77091e3c7f2ad48b4abaea0efa1d5b1ad9e4f13ae19bedfef9ecf81c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"e5I7GZ-HYAk5jd5VdUsy6T_ydl6VKTAKsLzuuHA58Wo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"WE2gwmJRF5EJt5EIjJsiLyNgUbUfHLLrBgv-qHlZd2o\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"P65d889f1Y5JYrybe0VU8Dq0Gb2cpN09MuqCzvViLBs\"}"
