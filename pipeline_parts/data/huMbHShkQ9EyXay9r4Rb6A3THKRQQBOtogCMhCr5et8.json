The market churns  on how it wants The random walk is impossible to predict. It’s nice to know our friends and loved ones are there with us when we need them in our darker periods of down. These past 6 weeks or so have been a test of strong wills. HODL in there just a bit longer, Christmas is right around the corner! St. Nickolas-Gann will come knocking, showering us with the gifts we have been waiting for all 2022. Watch it though, he’s a drinker though. Expect him to be a bit unpredictable and moody. Set your limits to make sure you catch him if he stumbles and falls. You know how it goes…\\n\\nBitcoin BTC, ETH Ether and coins like DOGE have been trying hard to keep it together. There have been good weeks and bad. In the times when we feel all hope is lost, it’s when we most need our friends to remind us just how far we’ve come. To get better, everyone must be honest and open about their weaknesses, and see the world and ourselves for what we are. Let’s see what we have here…\\n\\n![Annual Returns ROI are bullish](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lLPglvgcylZa2zYB5IRWw.png?height=1171&width=3354)\\n\\nMomentarily, the market right now is showing weakness. A lot of fear here and worries there, within reason. We sit under the long-term bull market support bands, and have even crossed through the ‘warning’ zones, usually indicating bearish times ahead until we can recross back into the green. \\n\\nNote those low volumes! This down turn has been sharp, but have you been accumulating like the rest of the fearless smart money’ests out there? \\n\\n![BTC continues to trade under Bull Market Support Bands](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/N-2xlXh4WBEb6f3a1LE9s.png?height=1225&width=3354)\\n\\nStochastic RSI shows neutral to ‘oversold’, unfortunately, like with the markey bands above, we can see we’re having trouble crossing back over the FIB golden pockets back up around 52k. So, clearly, we have a ways to go before we’re through the dump.\\n\\n![SRST is neutral, but BTC trades bearishly under the FIB Golden pocket](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Caw53yC47NbL_dKpXd50x.png?height=1225&width=3354)\\n\\nOn the otherhand Puell multiple is low, which means miners are HODL’ing at current levels.\\n\\n![BTC Puell multiple is bullishly low](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J0LEyA6njmC8kWQUjioVp.png?height=1225&width=3354)\\n\\nAnd to part, I’ll leave you with a Christmas gift. Happy holidays! 2022 is gonna be an incredible ride!\\n\\n![St. Gannicolas is coming to town!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mBk7EinJHwW2Q8GdAo4yh.png?height=912&width=3354)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1640090486,\"title\":\"Gann is loading up for a huge 2022 (BTC ETH DOGE)\"},\"digest\":\"UD_uNWQTuCQ6gux1FMr8XboL40J2HxtW5YGGvey5tc8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x48e1A84CBcAB14ADe9086A4e0812D82f56d3d3C1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"9exACbeZlXGn4csaNG5n5ClTJdgh3XQf0gFdQ0vABO4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"VQn4nyb7aj8ZUrophaQ5KdLGIs5FzrOnpD2Y4bkEAHs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"53Kmb4M6ZO6As4Y89TSdJfDAvzznlCVKLXEP35Je9yRtxOkWdc5wyn1qFBpzCfoM1YHUHWTvURIbt9XyVR7o8A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5195b1ed30e288c2445702312091afde70a3ad2cc54aaa9ab73f3086892df13b4286108371541e0ce42cd8311114e7c4994941dd824929b524bb0c780e0e39b71c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"9exACbeZlXGn4csaNG5n5ClTJdgh3XQf0gFdQ0vABO4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"VQn4nyb7aj8ZUrophaQ5KdLGIs5FzrOnpD2Y4bkEAHs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"UD_uNWQTuCQ6gux1FMr8XboL40J2HxtW5YGGvey5tc8\"}"
