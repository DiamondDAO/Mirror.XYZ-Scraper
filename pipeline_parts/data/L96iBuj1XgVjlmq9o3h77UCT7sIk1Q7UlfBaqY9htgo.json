"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"> Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be attained.\\n>\\n> \\\\~Marie Curie\\n\\n## Where We’ve Been\\n\\n⏰     There’s been a lot that has happened in the last few years, it’s almost unexplainable when we get into the details. I’ll try my best to explain it to the best of my abilities, but there will be parts I don’t talk about for the sake of privacy. I’m putting it all in the past now and beginning to focus on the things that matter to me most. I’m going to mark the early summer of 2020 to be the launching point as to when I started my crypto journey.\\n\\n🏥     It started with me being in the hospital due to an episode I was having because of my mental health issues. During this hospital visit, I was combative with the hospital staff and would refuse to follow their instructions. I wasn’t physically harming anyone, but I wasn’t complying with their rules which made them quite upset. Around this time, I was digesting huge amounts of data from the Internet and came across an ad for this crypto trading group. I then knew that I had to take the plunge and go all-in on crypto. It was going to take some time to invest though because I didn’t exactly have access to my electronic devices to trade with except for my phone.\\n\\n🤑     After being transferred to a semi-legitimate mental hospital and eventually being released, I started learning as much as I could to begin investing in cryptocurrencies. I joined one paid group. I joined another paid group. I looked for more groups that could slingshot my knowledge to the same level as people that have been in the game for much longer than myself. Eventually, I carved out my niche and found good sources of information. I joined a small, yet thriving crypto community in my hometown. I also began a business during the peak of the pandemic to teach, guide, and mentor clients that had zero experience with crypto. I follow some of the most involved people in the crypto space so that I’m always in the know.\\n\\n🗣     You’ve got to find where you’re wanted most and where you can generate the most value from using your time. Learn from more experienced crypto users by joining Discord servers and following up on crypto Twitter. At some point, I finally figured out how I could contribute to the community as a newbie developer.\\n\\n💔     I also have been trying to cope with of the loss of a relationship. I wasn’t capable of providing the kind of love she needed through all the lies and deceit I put her through. So yeah, we divorced and now I’m learning how to love myself so that the next relationship that I’m in will hopefully be stable.\\n\\nThis is where the journey begins, but first, what’s the current status?\\n\\n## Where We’re At\\n\\n📆     It’s currently 7:13 PM on December 6th, 2021 in my hometown of Naples, Florida. The weather is getting chilly and is starting to require some warmer layers. I feel as if I’m in an optimal location for my current goals and things are beginning to align. I’m excited for the festive atmosphere to envelop the city I live in. It’s great because, even though it doesn’t snow or the leaves don’t change their color, everyone starts decorating with Christmas lights!\\n\\n👨🏼‍🎓     I’m in school for Software Engineering and the Fall 2021 semester is just about to be over. Schoolwork has been getting quite difficult as I’m getting into the more serious classes. My motivation to continue with school is draining, especially as the opportunities in crypto are almost limitless. Should I struggle for the next few years in college or should I just start building/programming? I know how to program, I just don’t have extensive experience compared to devs in the crypto space. Does that even matter though? I understand the code and could replicate it given the task, so should I forego attending a traditional college? This is going to take some cognitive processing to figure out what to do.\\n\\n👨🏽‍💻     My journey with crypto has been pretty rewarding so far. I’ve assembled and run my own Ethereum 2.0 validator node and am seeing a good return on the investment. I also run two Bitcoin nodes to facilitate transactions on the Lightning ⚡️ Network.\\n\\n🏃🏼‍♂️     Healthwise, I’m weighing in at 186.6 pounds and have been tracking my progress with InsideTracker and an app called Humanity. I’m starting to see at 30 years old that my body isn’t as robust as it used to be back in my early 20s. I need to see myself working out because, when I don’t, my energy levels take a beating.\\n\\n❤️     Romantically, you could say I’m a “treasure” to find… that’s my way of saying I’m so single, it’s a joke. I am looking, but I’m not rushing it. Think of my approach as the old parable of the turtle vs. the hare: I may be slow, but I’m persistent and determined to win. There have been some pursuits within the last year, but I’m just not finding a connection with anyone that I’m head over heels for. Some would say that I’m asking for a lot when it comes to who I’m searching for, but I have the thought of The One and I’m not going to give that up. Obviously, I’m not saying that I expect a woman to match the exact criteria, but setting standards is important in my opinion.\\n\\n## Where We’re Going\\n\\n🚀     There’s always a lot of activity in crypto. I plan to keep my ear close to the ground so that I can pounce on opportunities when they present themselves. Learning how to develop smart contracts, dApps, and other Web3 infrastructure will be one of the next milestones to complete. I’ve read the code and know what it means, I just need to take action! But as the title states, “give it a minute… you’ll get there,” which is some advice I’m trying to give to myself (is it working?). The potential that we have to develop these innovative protocols will ensure that we are creating generational wealth for our lineage. That’s really the whole goal behind everything: to be financially independent along with all my family and close friends. Becoming financially independent means improved health, new doors of opportunity being opened, and fulfillment in one’s life.\\n\\n🧠     Following the S.M.A.R.T. goal plan format, I want to accomplish:\\n\\n* Complete (3) three full developer courses of blockchain development with Udemy, Moralis Academy, or BlockGeeks by February 2022.\\n* Join/Invest (in) (2) two DAOs that enable special features by February 2022.\\n* Have a fully functioning Bitcoin Node by the end of January 2022.\\n* Create the Family DAO for my family to make joint purchases, vote on activities and proposals, etc. by June of 2022.\\n\\n💼    These goals should be attainable by the deadline I’ve created. Let’s get to work on changing Web3! I need to remember that crypto is a marathon, not a sprint.\",\"timestamp\":1638955766,\"title\":\"1. Give It a Minute...
