"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I was walking around the aisles of Aldi supermarket over Christmas when back home in Ipswich. Dad asked me to pick up some logs for the fire (very stereotypical for Christmas, but useful nonetheless) so we went in to check out what all the fuss was about and why everyone in Ipswich seems to be waxing lyrical about Aldi and Lidl.\\n\\nI’ve always been aware of Aldi’s general strategy: fewer SKUs, private label brands, operational simplicity, lower everyday prices. But I was shocked to see just how shamelessly the brands rip off the major CPG brands across everything from name, colour pallettes, packaging shape, the lot. There is absolutely no doubt: the intent here is a ‘wink and nudge’ to the consumer to say: “This is the same thing as that other thing you know, but cheaper”\\n\\nHere are some examples:\\n\\n![A couple of example rip-offs of better-known equivalents](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7b5kCyczQEHFnsw7BCH4-.png?height=325&width=544)\\n\\nIt was an odd feeling of conflict between my fundamentally capitalist view of the world - that competition is a good thing, raising standards and lowering prices for the benefit of the consumer - and a more brand-led view of the world that respects craft, authenticity, heritage and innovation.\\n\\nYes, I know the consolidation of the CPG space means that a handful of corporate monoliths (amongst them Nestlé, P&G, Coca Cola, Unilever, Kraft-Heinz and Reckitt Benckiser) own 70%+ of the brands on supermarket shelves, but does that make their brands any more ‘deserving’ of being ripped off? These brands have been built across tens - if not hundreds - of years, and no doubt hundreds of millions of dollars not to mention countless hours of human toil in product development, crafting and communicating brand positioning, developing and launching marketing campaigns, and so on.\\n\\nCompetition is fundamentally a good thing because it drives innovation and it keeps prices in check. Aldi’s approach does the latter, to an extent, but contributes absolutely nothing to the former. It free-rides off the innovation of others in the most shameless way and arguably undermines the entire point of undertaking to innovate for the benefit of the consumer. Why bother investing in NPD if you know it will be instantly competed away by knock-offs?\\n\\nYes, the consumer “wins” in the short-term because they can buy Birra Mopelli at [£2.58/litre](https://groceries.aldi.co.uk/en-GB/p-birra-mapelli-premium-lager-500ml/4088600283043) instead of Birra Moretti at [£2.88/litre](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/all-beer/birra-moretti-lager-660ml), but in the long-run I’m not sure the payoff is there at the aggregate level for society if we are OK with such ruthless debasement of brand value.\\n\\nThis is obviously the core of Aldi’s strategy, and crying foul is not going to stop them (nor, does it seem, will [lawsuits from M&S](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/food-drink/ms-take-aldi-court-over-25718356) and others who are getting fed up with the strategy). Indeed, the German discounters have [continued to gain share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/280208/grocery-market-share-in-the-united-kingdom-uk/) vs. UK grocery market incumbents (albeit with a [hiccup during the pandemic](https://www.cityam.com/e-commerce-grocery-sales-plateau-boosts-aldis-market-share-to-peak-levels/#:\\\\~:text=As%20a%20result%2C%20Aldi's%20market,increase%20to%206.1%20per%20cent.) due to poor eCommerce capabilities) and that doesn’t look like it will be slowing down any time soon.\\n\\nSo instead, it raises the question for brands: how to retain that ‘edge’ and to avoid - or at least mitigate - being ripped off?\\n\\n### Identifying people, not products\\n\\nFor most of consumer ‘history’, brands have identified products. Directly marking an item with a noticeable brand as an indicator of provenance has been a practice for thousands of years, from the minting of coinage with the requisite markings of a given monarch or emperor through to branding the hide of an animal to identify the farmer to whom it belongs.\\n\\nWhen mass production of consumer products started to become commonplace in the early to mid twentieth century, the practice translated easily to the packaging of goods produced at scale. A Heinz brand stamp on the outside of a tin gave a guarantee of what was inside the tin; that the product originated in Heinz’s factories and would be of the expected level of quality as a result. CPG branding helped consumers sort through a growing diaspora of options, using brands as heuristics to shortcut decision-making and ensure quality of the products they bought.\\n\\nA conception of ‘brand’ that focuses on identifying a product continues to serve the same purpose today. Instant recognition of a given shape, font, colour, etc. can help give consumers those precious mental shortcuts as the proliferation of ‘decisions’ we have to make grows at an exponential rate.\\n\\nBut if that’s the only thing your brand is about, you open yourself up to the Aldi Attack: shameless mimicry of your brand. Put another way, taking a product-driven branding approach risks stripping the ‘brand’ down to just the ‘brand*ing*’ i.e. the typeface, the logo, the colour of the label, the shape of the packaging, etc. And that’s a slippery slope, made worse by the fact that co-manufacturing and outsourced production is so prevalent, particularly in CPG. Often the ‘original’ products and the rip-offs come from the same manufacturer, or even the same production line.\\n\\nA much stronger approach is to flip the emphasis and make the brand not only about helping to identify the *product*, but more importantly to help identify the *consumer*. That requires a much deeper assessment of what your brand stands for and how, by buying and using it, the consumer can adopt the brand’s characteristics as their own.\\n\\nThis role of brands as an ‘extension of self’ was explored extensively by Russell Belk in the 1980s (and happened to form the basis of my dissertation) and is still as relevant today as ever it was. It’s the age-old playbook in the luxury category, for example, where high margins are reinvested into brand-building advertising to create a representation of a lifestyle or attitude or set of beliefs, rather than simply to communicate the manufacturer or function of a product.\\n\\nThat doesn’t mean this strategy only works for high-ticket luxury brands. It has been interesting over the past couple of years to watch the beauty industry, for example, evolve from a focus on a superficial, exclusive, materialistic set of attributes peddling an unrealistic conception of beauty the masses to a more wholehearted embrace of environmental conscientiousness, body positivity and diversity of what ‘beauty’ is and means. The same applies in fashion with brands like Patagonia masterfully building a positioning focused around responsible consumption, long-lasting quality and ‘doing the right thing’. Or Tony’s Chocolonely disrupting the chocolate category with a positioning focused on ethical labour and sourcing.\\n\\nThese brands are not overnight successes. Building an authentic brand takes time and money, often with no direct return-on-investment metrics to validate the strategy. Instead, it has to be driven by clear vision, relentless consistency and thoughtful execution. But telling the story of a brand and imbuing it with meaning that consumers can adopt into their own self-perceptions builds a deeper moat around a brand and makes it harder to transplant brand value into a cheap knock-off.\",\"timestamp\":1641060608,\"title\":\"Rip-offs\"},\"digest\":\"RUS8uTxEtHfU-gNcOoOS1e17ngFbLO0P3E427FBbxK4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x26Eb500bc73744B06b2731F1a3038a77Ba4d7a2E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"k0gqvPuRv82pjBCxGQ_YVFuNaiipD-yiz1M8wCO6wBw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Wa7V2pByMfNtNQPERMcxuto_e9elKJFOyKQUihKAGho\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"pVdSMQne6guVVDmD7dDp7rUbarwJhrWQGwZhNVHr9uVrMikddezsghE0q3TAevzCXKbtUnON2DFzXqWtIj4Jpw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x87cc2b5e91ce2cc3427d22aaed205753f5dbd9821922b5bc40403ebd02d082b47323712acfea626c2b1d88961c43dc97a81de47aa736c911629e0ba8492319fd1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"k0gqvPuRv82pjBCxGQ_YVFuNaiipD-yiz1M8wCO6wBw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Wa7V2pByMfNtNQPERMcxuto_e9elKJFOyKQUihKAGho\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"K6rSc-Myh-qYZ9xfpUok_AIIv4BD3CTGCJ8PdWwIH7Q\"}"
