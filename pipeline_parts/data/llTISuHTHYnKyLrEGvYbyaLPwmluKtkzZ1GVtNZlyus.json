"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Blockchain represents a change in the operation mode of the global economy. Enterprises can make full use of time tested advanced solutions to prepare for this major change.\\n\\nBlockchain was once regarded as an emerging cutting-edge technology. For enterprises who want to keep up with the pace of future information and value transfer, blockchain has become an increasingly important infrastructure. As a shared digital transaction ledger, the blockchain is copied and distributed in the computer system network. Such books are verified by many participants around the world and based on advanced cryptography. It is almost impossible to cheat or be cracked. Blockchain network can be used for smart contract execution, value transfer, order tracking, payment settlement, account verification, etc.\\n\\nIn order to facilitate transactions, a set of rules called \\\"smart contracts\\\" are stored on the blockchain and automatically executed when specific conditions are met. For example, in inter enterprise business payment, when certain conditions of the transaction are reached, the smart contract can be automatically executed.\\n\\nAlthough it is generally believed that blockchain technology is still in its early stage and just budding, in fact, it has entered the early stage of large-scale adoption, especially in the financial industry. Recalling the large-scale digital transformation promoted by the Internet, in the financial industry and other fields, many forward-looking enterprises are already taking important steps to prepare for the blockchain.\\n\\nNowadays, there are many kinds of software that can hold digital assets and interact with multiple blockchains and smart contracts. It is easier for enterprises to embrace this new world than ever before. Enterprises that have not yet developed blockchain integration strategies face the risk of backwardness. Consumer demand for various new areas of the blockchain continues to grow, including decentralized Finance (DFI), non homogeneous token (NFT), and emerging smart contract applications in insurance technology, environmental sustainability, real estate and other fields. A recent survey by Gartner (an authoritative it research and consulting firm) shows that about 11% of enterprises have adopted blockchain technology in their operations, while 75% of enterprises are actively studying how to apply blockchain technology.\",\"timestamp\":1637230660,\"title\":\"Block technology and enterprise\"},\"digest\":\"0u0po3Ug_U09G96FjNU49aRN_bPchtturi5MiE_M7PI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x44c6BA7D066F26FaD5e887814476020b1A065602\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"u8D0QNmYf3vijh8pApC5npz8GqkDiPlhM6_39vI8zMQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"-L7ZG8M1zJzjIFE267yivVpRsCL2rfCJTqrNGTu3ZXg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"XacszjAKeHX94JDDvCBli1vGFdyqwkvCOBVc03Miq339JFtU54qCjAVMDx7AV2b_qw08bsvInm_1Esd-lB_fnQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x37babfc72db63ab15115804e64ead2074d76a99a9ca9dcaf1b6a2641956ac4cb4d3ae2eb89b9e3295ca675d40cf8def8945f3bc301e0496cd57d9b078134840f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"u8D0QNmYf3vijh8pApC5npz8GqkDiPlhM6_39vI8zMQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"-L7ZG8M1zJzjIFE267yivVpRsCL2rfCJTqrNGTu3ZXg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"0u0po3Ug_U09G96FjNU49aRN_bPchtturi5MiE_M7PI\"}"
