According to the legend, he collapsed and died of exhaustion after making the announcement.\\n\\nSince the revival of the **Olympic Games and the Marathon race** in the first modern Olympics in Athens in 1896, thousands of runners have run the authentic course. A new record of 60,000 participants from 105 countries and regions was set in 2019.\\n\\nLast year the event was canceled due to the pandemic. Athletes and amateur runners are eager for a comeback.\\n\\n\\\"It cost us a lot because we love to run this race. I would like to believe that we will never have such misfortunes, difficulties again,\\\" Konstantinos Gkelaouzos, a Greek long-distance runner who had won the Athens marathon, said at the press conference.\\n\\n**\\\"We have finally overcome the problem of COVID-19 and we will all be together at the starting point to celebrate. I wish good luck to all participants,\\\"** Greek long-distance runner Gloria Priviletzio added.\\n\\nAll runners crossing the finish line inside the Panathenaic stadium will receive a collective medal designed this year by prominent Greek sculptor Costas Varotsos.\\n\\nIt is the second in a series of special medals, which will be awaiting runners every year until 2026 for the 130th anniversary of the first Marathon race of modern times.\\n\\nThis year's medal will show \\\"The Runner\\\", an emblematic sculpture created by Varotsos three decades ago which has been placed near the Panathenaic stadium.\\n\\n\\\"The **struggle** to get from one point to another through obstacles is a daily affair that we all struggle with. The medal I made is based on that (thought),\\\" Varotsos explained on *Wednesday after the presentation of the medal.*\",\"timestamp\":1636625014,\"title\":\"Athens Marathon to return this weekend after pandemic break\"},\"digest\":\"i8f9cJoaDlUWeWwd_7LD1XJCBg1ZAZG9x2Ke3lEyhx4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xeDc2E547BD85699818e0560504F5961C707f65Bc\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"76UAHp-4_HUEdz7xfn27ioai4shX8OjChwM8K9czVlo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Uv2fKEmXNRgDsQDGeLw1iK0MtIyUavbc1LbyrUCiGRY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"W4i2RiRlC5BrQZN8Uxoztc81s50g-VzgKR6SetL4kWJxErGsN686BRmISuzqr0XZCLRtlVnH989j177nXDLObg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf6085a6189c34bc90e3f5bd98c76115a2eab94d2c45bc60e567a262f48dc154c296b7e0b80123acf7e4ba4d1e7beab510221755a80785877141ba25708a0c3a11b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"76UAHp-4_HUEdz7xfn27ioai4shX8OjChwM8K9czVlo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Uv2fKEmXNRgDsQDGeLw1iK0MtIyUavbc1LbyrUCiGRY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"i8f9cJoaDlUWeWwd_7LD1XJCBg1ZAZG9x2Ke3lEyhx4\"}"
