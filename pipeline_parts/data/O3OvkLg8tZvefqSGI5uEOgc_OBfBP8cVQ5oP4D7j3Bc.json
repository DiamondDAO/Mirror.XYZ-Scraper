to clearly see the constructs and paradigms that shape the world within and around you. and to choose what it all means. what to make of it. what to make *with* it?\\n\\nthis is where our journey begins. you are being invited, as a sentient being of planet Earth, to enter this visual portal, into a life of your conscious creation. to delve into your creative potentials, as a co-creator of our shared matrix. the creator of your personal reality. the energetic projector of the beliefs, constructs, and choices that continue to perpetuate the paradigms of this earthly realm. take that first step into the *unknown* future. the one that exists just beyond our habits. our subconscious beliefs. the comfort of our familiar discomfort. to ask yourself, if you could create any world, what would you create? what’s stopping you?\\n\\n### MATRIX, THE GENESIS: THE STORY\\n\\n![an early rendition of \\\"matrix,\\\" March 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mDz4UwXQooU8N8s1dPswh.jpeg?height=680&width=681)\\n\\n“matrix” was created by my partner, Jaime Estalella, and i, as a visual landscape in which our debut single -- “matrix” -- could exist, as an immersive experience. a window into the inner world from which the song was born.\\n\\nwe had all just experienced a year of global quarantines. the “new normal” looming over our heads like an ominous cloud. disillusion. fear. frustration. people wanted things to back to *the way they were*… before. the glorified state of numb distraction that we comfortably swam in, before being forced to sit with ourselves and really look at where the choices we’d made had brought us. for me, quarantine came as a welcome solace, from the bustle and distraction of existing in a physical body, in our man-made constructs of space-time. from being perceived. a moment of true retreat. i spent the year quietly questioning everything about my reality. my Self. my life. tiptoeing through the dark shadowy pits, meeting them with blinding light. ego death. *spiritual awakening.* tea and cake with my demons. seeing them for the lost and wounded children they were. meeting them with love and compassion. welcoming them into my home. turning them from foe to friends. companions in my journey forward. superpowers. and from there. beginning to create the life, and see the Self, i always wanted but never knew i could have.\\n\\nthe song “matrix” was born as a reflection of lessons learned through this quest. the realization that i had been haphazardly wishing my life away. wanting change, but never being the change agent. not realizing that the hero i was so patiently awaiting to swoop in and save me, was ME all along. i made myself a victim to my own life. had created my dungeon, shackled myself to the wall, and swallowed the key. all i had to do was sort through my shit. and free myself.\\n\\nthe visual piece “matrix”, the genesis NFT, was a creative experiment in and visual representation of the idea that we are the creators of our reality(ies). a reality created, by us, exactly as we wanted. free from the boundaries of physical matter and linear time. to me, web3 tools and technology are beautiful reflections of this truth. a testament to our role as the creators of our world, realities, and experiences.\\n\\nthe reality we wanted to in this piece create was one of quiet contemplation. solace in the peaceful dark. shadowy introspection. the electric buzz of energy \\\\~ moving, pulsing, generating. alive with possibility. still with anticipation. peaceful in the perfection of the present. this is a moment of pre-creation, where all potentials lay at your fingertips, and all one has to do is decide. the figure in the piece sits in the waters of their subconscious. washing away all that does not serve the reality they are preparing to create. the limiting beliefs. the *shoulds* and external expectations. soaking up all that will empower them along their way. the TV, a portal into a life of conscious creation. candles, to help you stay aligned. the illumination of your intention and purpose in moments of darkness, doubt, and uncertainty. plants, a reminder of the fertile soil that is your mind, your conscious awareness, your being. for the fruitful birthing of all that you desire. the remote control, the tool that is your attention. where are you pointing your awareness? what are you feeding, choosing? your mind makes it real.\\n\\nfor me, this piece is a reminder of the path i’ve chosen. a container in which i can retreat, regroup, and remember what i have set out to do. who i have come here to be. an affirmation of all the potentials i have yet to call in. all the choices i have yet to make and the places those choices will take me.\\n\\nXO\\n\\nLOVE\",\"timestamp\":1639685350,\"title\":\"matrix, the genesis\"},\"digest\":\"TuvMePLBDcxx1pT72Ng53ZKBmnnuXUfS_ylP3qNOTgQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x384A0c62aF2c59F7Ca6E554c11071Cc02afb1d7f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NYIC1VZEk0T8K-In-h3egWn5UktbWnrz3WxruW5sXdU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"hdEUnNFlwr8ZKuQieV90ciw-86tq74hTCko8E_aZJ4Q\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"zIkv1wEBYTA4Z4QgtO0bktN0dQ_dpOO73fA0d280HJXqBkson6745mVIxZaUYXKPVzGwPJ9cZDBggxSsq374OA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf9b4c9bf4cb786f0ddc60e6f5af41489c6b7eda04446e89782dd9f44c5b6cf9d18680df66fc92334c5dd50ee20b76c97aa8cc933b186489c489a6b736449462d1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NYIC1VZEk0T8K-In-h3egWn5UktbWnrz3WxruW5sXdU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"hdEUnNFlwr8ZKuQieV90ciw-86tq74hTCko8E_aZJ4Q\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"QAsflbtrhgGncOaVsrpeGmZi2QG7YDNRjlHi75sBvew\"}"
