"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"To begin with, Avalaunch is a launchpad built on Avalanche chain. Projects that are also built on Avalanche can launch their token on Avalaunch.\\n\\nSo far it seems like an ordinary launchpad. But what makes Avalaunch different from other launchpads and why did I call it “fair”?\\n\\nFirst of all, unlike popular launchpads, Avalaunch does not have a tier system. You can basically participate with any amount of money. There is no minimum and no maximum. Participants must stake XAVA, Avalaunch’s native token, in order to get allocation on presales. XAVA is available on many DEXes and CEXes like Pangolin and Gateio. Participants must have at least 1 AVAX in their wallet while registration as they have to deposit 1 AVAX to register for presales. These so called registration fees are refundable and participants can redeem 1 AVAX while purchasing their allocation.\\n\\nHow are the allocations calculated?\\n\\nAllocations are calculated after the registration period and determined based on how much you staked XAVA.\\n\\nBasically, the more you stake, the higher is your allocation.\\n\\nBut there are some points to take into consideration.\\n\\nThe allocation a user gets does not only depend on the amount of staked XAVA but also on specific conditions which may differ considering each presale. These factors are for example total amount of tokens available for distribution, its monetary value and number of registered users.\\n\\nTo get to the “fair” feature of Avalaunch, small investors are relatively prioritized on Avalaunch. But how? Even though the higher a participant stakes, the higher is his/her allocation, Avalaunch team successfully developed a “Whale protection”. This system is managed through this way: The more you stake, the more the granted allocation per staked XAVA decreases. So basically, if you assume that there is a graph representing allocation you get on y-axis and staked XAVA on x-axis, the slope of the function which the graph belongs to decreases strictly and considering the lim x→ infinity, there is a global maximum allocation determined for all users of the platform.\\n\\nThere is an image below which illustrates the “Whale Protection” mentioned above.\\n\\n![Source: https://t.me/avalaunch_app](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MhsE9NhdJCq4VPMCF4Mdo.jpeg?height=890&width=1047)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1641149192,\"title\":\"Avalaunch ( A Fair Launchpad)\"},\"digest\":\"ERCpDkOJSSZyEEKNnVCYcGG7DwKLMGG1Vv3EJPS6mIU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x67678B4fbA121aB6c00daa15772002AcDe1bfba0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fPJM3Y5FWhJ87BGzziKptxNtIZ8S-tkE3IHP0k3RMZ0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"vf2zCy4wiLJDwAN-jPsMaPAkIl6VG6IC08Kth0zz4Po\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"bYB4co92ddx8CajrO-TA647sT7wTjrEe59tNHcQAgBX2ywZiAxPXIN7kVjrTNIgiqONrebbd9YASx1zpVk0nGg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf3a7fc6e619dc06d7edef15b524ceb7f0d0460d136c4a16247e60a04a11f975d746e7d485d3b8d7a18a05001c580fac41157a9ff234d2636b744208e25cd50c91c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fPJM3Y5FWhJ87BGzziKptxNtIZ8S-tkE3IHP0k3RMZ0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"vf2zCy4wiLJDwAN-jPsMaPAkIl6VG6IC08Kth0zz4Po\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"zd-OqTmQQD-vIPxUhKR0ZHje-r9W_4EyepJG-hhguFM\"}"
