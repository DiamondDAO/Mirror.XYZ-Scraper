Forget Axie, forget that Ronin shit, none of it is comparable *(I haven’t even played those games but I can assure you they’re dogshit / not fun to play + have dogshit tokenomics).*\\n\\n> *DefiKingdoms is in* ***its*** ***own realm***…*see what I did there? With the “realm” word? No?

The game looks nice, it’s fun to collect heroes and do quests, you make money whilst playing *(a good amount I might add),* all your heroes + items are NFT’s *(meaning you can sell them to others / trade them on the DEX),* you’ll be able to fight other crypto nerds and enemies in the future, and the devs are fucking ***BAYZED.***\\n\\nYou wanna go play Axie instead? Fine, go farm your dogshit $SLP token that has been dying since inception. You wanna go play that Ronin game? Fine…*(I honestly don’t know what the fuck that game is and I think me not knowing about it says something).* All I know is that I’m gonna keep doing my quests and upgrading my heroes so I can destroy ***[@satsdart](https://twitter.com/satsdart)*** *(I didn’t forget about the ❄️🐕 incident……that wretched….terrible incident…)* and ***[@ansem](https://twitter.com/blknoiz06)*** once PVP releases.
