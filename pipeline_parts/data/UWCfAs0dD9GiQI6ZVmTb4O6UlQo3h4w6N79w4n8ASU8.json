"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## What is Trader Joe?\\n\\n[Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/#/home) is an AMM style decentralized exchange on Avalanche. Trader Joe combines DEX services with DeFi lending to offer leveraged trading. Trader Joe’s products are community driven which allows them to allocate fees collected from liquidation and trades back to the users via the JOE/xJOE staking mechanism. JOE is a governance token that also rewards its holders with a share of exchange revenues.\\n\\n## What is Avalanche?\\n\\n[Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/) is a [layer one](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain) blockchain created to host all kind of distributed applications. As another blockchain with similar utility to Ethereum, Avalanche has made small changes to how the blockchain works to optimize for speed and scalability. Avalanche aims to not only be a short term compliment to Ethereum but possibly even a substitute. Avalanche has a unique architecture. It consists of three unique chains: X-Chain, C-Chain and P-Chain. With each chain having its own purpose. Something interesting about Avalanche is that each chain uses a different consensus mechanism.\\n\\n## What is an AMM/CFMM?\\n\\nConstant Function Market Makers (CFMMs) are a classification of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) which have been applied to crypto DeFi markets. CFMMs were pioneered by several projects in the crypto community to create decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for digital asset trading and based on a mathematical function establishing a pre-defined set of prices based on the assets held in a liquidity pool. Whereas a centralized limit order book-based exchanges (OBs/CLOBs), traders trade against a specific counter-party.\\n\\n## Why Deposit Liquidity in Trader Joe?\\n\\nSome investors/traders may want to Provide Liquidity (LP) in an AMM style DEX for various reasons. One popular reason is the ability to earn rewards in the native governance token of the platform. This reward structure can be used to offset a concept known as [impermanent loss (IL)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/impermanent-loss) which is when someone’s assets in a pool lose relative value when the price of one asset changes dramatically against the other asset. The concept of earning tokens for staking LP tokens is referred to as [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-yield-farming) and can be done under the “Farm” tab on [Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/#/farm).\\n\\n## A step-by-step guide on how to lend assets on Trader Joe:\\n\\n* Visit [https://traderjoexyz.com](https://traderjoexyz.com/) and connect your wallet.\\n\\n![Trader Joe Connect Wallet Pop Up](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FefB_GbeDHGtEh7AgCYgGX.png&w=3840&q=90)\\n\\n* If your wallet is not on the Avalanche Network, a window will prompt you to switch to the network.
