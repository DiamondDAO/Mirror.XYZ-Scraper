"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Is it a nightmare or a blessing? I’ll never know\\n\\nAh crap, the alarm had to go off, didn’t it?\\nIt had to. Right when I was in the middle of that beautiful dream.\\nI was chilling at a Bed and Breakfast in Bali, but no.\\nI’m back to living the same day for the 100th time.\\n\\nI’m struggling to open even one-fourth of an eye.\\nBut you bet I’ve scrolled through 20 Instagram reels.\\nI check my work mail, my Gmail, social media, and blog.\\nAnd I haven’t even brushed my teeth yet.\\n\\nI’m not a morning person.\\nThe most you’ll get out of me before noon is a confused stare.\\nI figure I can shower later (a whole day later) and switch on my laptop.\\nI gulp down my breakfast and sit at meetings.\\n\\nAh. Meetings.\\nDo these people not realize that most of this meeting is a God-awful waste?\\nBut hey, we’re all on Instagram or Whatsapp through these super-productive meetings anyway.\\nDamn those reels.\\n\\nIrritation. Annoyance. The mind-numbing torture of monotony.\\nBeing stuck in a soul-sucking job can do things to your mind and body.\\nThings that doctors warn of will bring you serious health issues at a young age.\\nBut it’s only for a few more days, I tell myself.\\n\\nOnly a few more days of mindlessly scrolling on my phone.\\nWorking double shifts for the pay of one.\\nGrowing a side hustle until it utterly drains me.\\nBeing too tired to write. And too unfulfilled to sleep.\\n\\nStaying up till 3 A.M, not just because of my smartphone.\\nBut because my brain is cooking up all sorts of ideas.\\nI can’t shut it down because I’m too invested in what it has to say.\\nToo invested in the dreams that keep me wide awake.\\n\\nI look up in despair, cursing the loop of this one wretched day.\\nAnd catch my racing thoughts gently.\\nI’ll let those thoughts finish.\\nI’ll give them a big stage and acknowledge them duly. But there’s more.\\n\\nI won’t forget about the times I lived another kind of day.\\nThe kind of day where my loved ones were in the hospital, very sick.\\nThe kind of day where I watched them in agony or suffered through something myself.\\nThe kind of day when I wished for a normal routine back, to sweep away the pain.\\n\\nThere have been times when I took normalcy for granted.\\nAnd then I craved it.\\nI craved it badly to ease whatever misery I felt and saw before me.\\nBut now that there’s “too much normal”, I’m bored?\\n\\nMy epiphany of gratitude can’t magically make everything fine.\\nThings are still pretty shit.\\nBut I can tolerate being stuck here, kind of healthy, and kind of happy.\\nI’m kind of happy that my family and I are safe.\\n\\nI’m kind of happy to be just “okay” for now, because it’s a big deal.\\nI’ll be really happy when I start actually living my life and making it everything I desire.\\nBut for now, this day is fine.\\nFor now, I’ll live the same day for the 101st time.\",\"timestamp\":1637581355,\"title\":\"I’m Living the Same Day for the 100th Time\"},\"digest\":\"xhI_Z2CA_FNE0040LU3GpURmpFLq99zUefCMSIgM5zo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5f51534abFfc3b8e3eab7C27E2522483626DC9d7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"aqUXci-pooPKYO5-Cm0ih9f31pYAUnBfna-c0W9Ih6Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"nF9TbWS7qAJfZ9mILzzKxfIS30vNGT8dVnWGq2rPTMM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"NPjNmctEchwskaMQ9A0NWg53D1pH4acol9QHfVMYUhc0cr59bVKzVlsleNXpeQ0jlWkQWMXkU9xzVyn7ubbt-w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc6521e91c45b0bc996c507fff6823e51bca269341fb113817dcdb4472c304e9b2c8fa032715e8d0dbc236e75433a2faa3942a03489f9d6938ce31c6cb9bba17c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"aqUXci-pooPKYO5-Cm0ih9f31pYAUnBfna-c0W9Ih6Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"nF9TbWS7qAJfZ9mILzzKxfIS30vNGT8dVnWGq2rPTMM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"buJJvyY9JhbWv69AxpWKiFpoWBlMV2BYDwoTnBANCBo\"}"
