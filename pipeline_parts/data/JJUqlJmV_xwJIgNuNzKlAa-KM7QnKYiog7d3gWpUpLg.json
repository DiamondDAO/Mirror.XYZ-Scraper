"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"As a product that aims to help everyone in NFTs and not just the elite, we thought it would be helpful to provide simple and actionable advice to buy your first piece, using our tool to make your money go furthest.\\n\\nWe want everyone to profit from using [NFT Ninja](https://www.nftninja.app) regardless of their knowledge or capital levels so we’re assuming little knowledge or acumen in this article.\\n\\nThere are tonnes of ways to actually buy an NFT with competing exchanges, wallets, and marketplaces, but for the sake of simplicity, we’ve detailed one possible route, which is one that has low fees and a good user experience.\\n\\n## What You Need\\n\\n* $1,000+\\n* Will to learn\\n\\nYes - really. You don’t need to be a techie or art collector to get involved.\\n\\nFor an “Amazonified” world, the infrastructure around NFTs is quite convoluted so you’ll need to jump through a few hoops to secure your prize. In the near future, this will be much easier but you can see it as a plus, in that if you’re willing to do a tiny bit of work then you’re earlier than people who aren’t.\\n\\n## Links\\n\\nIt’d be worth bookmarking the below because you’ll need them throughout the process.\\n\\n* [Crypto.com](https://www.crypto.com)\\n* [Metamask.io](https://metamask.io/)\\n* [OpenSea](https://www.opensea.io)\\n\\n## Step 1 – Buy Ethereum\\n\\nFirst off you need to purchase cryptocurrency using your fiat currency (USD, GBP etc). The coin with the most liquidity in NFTs is Ethereum, with lower levels of activity existing in other ecosystems as well, but for starters let’s just use ETH.\\n\\nHead to [Crypto.com](https://www.crypto.com) or download the [app](https://crypto.com/app), go through the necessary steps to be registered and verified, and buy ETH. It’s actually recommended to do as much on mobile as possible as mobile is inherently more secure than desktop.\\n\\nThe minimum viable amount you’ll need is around $1k, or 0.25 ETH at the time of writing. This is to cover the purchase of the NFT as well as the transaction costs (aka “gas fees”).\\n\\n## Step 2 – Setup MetaMask\\n\\nMetaMask is a browser extension wallet that allows you to easily access and interact with decentralized applications (aka dApps).\\n\\nFind out more at [metamask.io](https://www.metamask.io) or click on the below link to go straight to downloading the extension:\\n\\n[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en)\\n\\nWhen you're done adding it to your browser, it’s time to start setting up your wallet.\\n\\nWe’re assuming you’re new to all this, so you want to create a new wallet. The next steps are incredibly important in terms of securing your funds as there’s no one who can help if you mess it up.\\n\\nHave a listen to this podcast episode to understand the need to go OTT when it comes to security in crypto:\\n\\n[https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Wb0NT2kEXGaGxFqc4vSTD?si=2d4acc9b5c5c4ca7](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Wb0NT2kEXGaGxFqc4vSTD?si=2d4acc9b5c5c4ca7)\\n\\nTLDL; you will never be able to recover your funds if you lose your password and seed phrase.\\n\\n### Securing Your Wallet: Password\\n\\nUnlike most application logins, you won’t be able to simply email yourself a forgotten password link. It is of the utmost importance that you first create a secure, unique password for your MetaMask wallet. Please make sure to store this password securely, offline in a secure location like a safe.\\n\\n### Securing Your Wallet: Seed Phrase\\n\\nThe secret recovery phrase, also referred to as the seed recovery phrase, is one of the most unique parts of interacting with cryptocurrencies and blockchains. Your secret recovery phrase is a string of typically 12 words that pertains to a specific private key and can be used to generate public keys or addresses.\\n\\nSimply put, your secret recovery phrase is the foundation of your wallet and wallet contents. If you happen to forget your password, the first line of defence, your recovery seed phrase will allow you to restore access to your wallet and all that is inside.\\n\\nThis also means that if the device you’re utilizing is damaged or lost, with your secret recovery phrase you can restore your wallet and contents on a different device. Therefore, anyone who has access to your secret recovery phrase could simply restore your wallet on their own device and take the contents for themselves.\\n\\nMuch like you wouldn’t share passwords, ***DO NOT*** share your recovery seed phrase with anyone. It’s good practice to store it offline in multiple, separate, secure locations.\\n\\nAfter securely recording and storing away your recovery seed phrase, your wallet is ready to receive your ETH from Crypto.com!\\n\\n## Step 3 – Transfer ETH to MetaMask\\n\\nSo you’ve got a MetaMask wallet, but nothing inside. Maybe you bought some Ether on Coinbase during the 2017 bull market. Maybe you have a generous friend who wants to send you some to get started.\\n\\nEither way, you’ll need to know how to access your Ethereum address to be able to receive funds.\\n\\nWhen opening your newly acquired MetaMask wallet, you can find your Ethereum address (a long string of letters and numbers, starting with 0x) at the top.\\n\\n**IMAGE**\\n\\nBecause of the length of addresses, it’s often most easy to identify an address by a few characters from the beginning and end of an address. To unveil the entire address though, you can simply hover over the characters, and click to copy the address to your clipboard.\\n\\nThe full result is your Ethereum address. You’ll need this address if you wish to be able to receive ETH or other ERC-20 tokens from an exchange such as Coinbase.\\n\\n## How do I send ETH?\\n\\nAfter you’ve got your wallet secured and have received some ETH, it’s time to learn how to send it.\\n\\nWith ETH in your wallet, you can select “send” from the opening screen on MetaMask.\\n\\nThat will prompt you to establish a recipient address. Simply put, where would you like to send ETH?\\n\\n**IMAGE**\\n\\nHere, we’ve decided to send some funds back to the Lucky Trader wallet.\\n\\nIf this is the first time you’re sending to an address, but you expect to use it in the future, you can add the recipient to your address book! This can help avoid silly copy and paste mistakes in the future.\\n\\nAfter you’ve selected your recipient, it’s time to decide how much you want to send.\\n\\n**IMAGE**\\n\\nOnce you’ve decided how much to send, click “next.”\\n\\n**IMAGE**\\n\\nIn this example, we’ve selected .01 ETH, but you’ll notice that the total transaction is a bit more than .01 ETH. This is because a transaction requires a “gas” fee to be pushed to and confirmed on the blockchain. The amount of gas you submit in a transaction can be edited (see steps below), but in this instance, we’re comfortable with the estimated fee and the probability of confirmation in less than 30 seconds.\\n\\n*Note: The initial fee estimation given by MetaMask is based on the current network activity and base fees on the Ethereum blockchain. MetaMask fees are no higher than other wallets as they use a compilation of multiple gas estimators to determine the appropriate fee at the time of transaction.*\\n\\n**IMAGE**\\n\\nOnce the confirmation is confirmed, you're all done!\\n\\nCongrats, you’ve sent ETH!\\n\\nYou can repeat this exact process for sending any other ERC-20 tokens that may reside in your Ethereum wallet.\\n\\n## Step 4 – Purchase NFT\\n\\nYou have two options here:\\n\\n* Minting an NFT\\n* Buying on the secondary market\\n\\n### Minting\\n\\nAssuming you believe in a new project, and you think the price of an NFT will only go up, then you will maximize profits by being early and “minting” an NFT. This means you’re in the first batch of people who can get their hands on an NFT.\\n\\nUsually, you will randomly generate an NFT with certain traits and attributes that are rare or common, or more likely somewhere in between.\\n\\nYou can then hold this or sell it on OpenSea.\\n\\n### Secondary\\n\\nOpenSea is by and large the home of the secondary NFT market.\\n\\nPeople sell their minted NFTs or ones they’ve bought on OpenSea, generally for a profit although with all markets people sell for a loss if they think the price is only going down.\\n\\n## How to Set Up and Navigate Your Account\\n\\nAccounts on OpenSea, like nearly all of Web 3.0, are directly tied to your Ethereum address.\\n\\nTherefore, to set up an account on OpenSea, you’ll need to have an Ethereum address and wallet with compatibility with Web 3.0 and decentralized applications. The most popular wallet option is MetaMask, but with OpenSea, you can connect with a handful of other wallet options.\\n\\nIf you already have a wallet, you can head to [OpenSea.io](https://opensea.io/) and connect to the site using the wallet icon in the top right corner of the page.\\n\\n**IMAGE**\\n\\nAfter choosing the appropriate wallet provider and following the connection steps, you’re now “signed in” to OpenSea.\\n\\nFrom this step, you’ll now be able to view and edit your profile.\\n\\nBy hovering over, or clicking on the circle next to the wallet icon in the screenshot above, you’ll be sent to your profile page.\\n\\n### How To Edit Your Profile\\n\\nYour OpenSea profile page will eventually be the home of all the NFTs you acquire. As you curate your collection, other OpenSea users will be able to navigate to this page, peruse your collection, buy NFTs you have listed for sale or make offers on the NFTs that aren’t.\\n\\nIf you wish to personalize your profile page, hover over the profile circle in the top right corner and select “my account settings.”\\n\\nIn the general account settings section, you’ll have the opportunity to name your profile for easier navigation, add your email for notifications, as well as attach a website or a social media profile to your account.\\n\\n**IMAGE**\\n\\nWhile a profile name is not required, with one attached, you’ll be able to quickly find your account or any other using the search bar at the top of the page.\\n\\n### How to Manage Your Notifications\\n\\nInside your profile settings, you can manage your notification settings as well. Assuming you’ve attached an email address to the account, OpenSea will allow you to create alerts for whenever you’ve sold an item, bought an item, or received an offer.\\n\\nIn this section, merely check the boxes that you wish to create a notification for and ensure you’ve verified your email address previously, to receive them.\\n\\nIt is important to note, you may receive a large amount of notifications regarding offers on your NFTs. At the bottom of the notification settings page, you have the opportunity to create a minimum offer threshold before an alert is generated and sent to you. Therefore, if you only care to receive notifications about offers of 1 ETH or more, setting this threshold to “1” will ensure you don’t receive any unwanted notifications.\\n\\n## How to Find the Perfect NFT on OpenSea\\n\\nNow that you have your OpenSea profile established, it’s time to find an NFT that you want to buy.\\n\\nSearching for an NFT on OpenSea is simple - use the search bar at the top of the page to navigate to a collection or specific NFT you have in mind.\\n\\nFor example, if you wanted to look through the Lazy Lions NFTs, you can type, “Lazy Lions,” and a collection matching that description will automatically populate.\\n\\n**IMAGE**\\n\\n***Security Tip: Nefarious actors will place look-alike collections on OpenSea that are not the real, verified collections. Ensure you’re selecting the right collection, and use the verified badge (blue checkmark) as a guide!***\\n\\nUpon loading, the Lazy Lions collection will be pre-sorted from the lowest price to highest price among the collection. But, if you can’t find anything that suits your eye, you can use the filter panel on the left to sort and find exactly the right attributes that suit you.\\n\\n**IMAGE**\\n\\nSelecting a particular attribute will automatically filter the collection, leaving you with only the Lions with the respective attribute you’ve chosen. Add on as many filters as necessary to find the option most suitable for you.\\n\\n### How to Buy an NFT on OpenSea\\n\\nWhen you have found the perfect NFT, it’s time to buy it!\\n\\nFrom the collection page, you can double-click an individual asset to be directed to the respective asset page.\\n\\nOn this page, you can view the entire activity history of this asset as well as the price history, any pending offers, and more.\\n\\nTo buy it, click “buy now\\\" next to the asset image.\\n\\n**IMAGE**\\n\\nAfter doing so, your connected wallet will populate and allow you to confirm your wish to buy the NFT.\\n\\nHere, you’ll also be able to edit gas settings if the purchase is time-sensitive.\\n\\nOnce the transaction has confirmed on the blockchain, the NFT is yours!\",\"timestamp\":1635779770,\"title\":\"Getting Started in NFTs\"},\"digest\":\"IOu6JtgFg9gQteHNPOP-40YM6GoCDQXShvMXGnpoL5Y\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xAc0a76Be83fE580d61F176753fE1ddc727FAd04f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"5Vzq2Evf5Yoj8it39GZC6LHUvMFX_25OrCNF3oTkaq0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"7nQKK9b82CBKpGb5rCCV0TrjyeVKtNrJlj5wXng195Y\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"IiWHX-Keb3-DWYdlJiz7Gw8NzKCPWb8jPpyM_Uc79RxMMOiITNtqjmgfZRycvayP-mpNn5FJvzmT-nm5poQJUA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4c460ac540b38ee92c378e42a814dc1630f319ed0f75ea283829d2ed9c7ea24f4d4639808477b1a693376caee28367502ba4502530ad75b5997794bdca23b5461b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"5Vzq2Evf5Yoj8it39GZC6LHUvMFX_25OrCNF3oTkaq0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"7nQKK9b82CBKpGb5rCCV0TrjyeVKtNrJlj5wXng195Y\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"e0rpypNxJXBRBTwgy6DcWYYlXCtC1uGJ-esczuWrtuA\"}"
