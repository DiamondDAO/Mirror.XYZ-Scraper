"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"To understand Web3, let's take a look at the features of Web1 and Web2.\\n\\nWeb1: Just read\\nThe Internet has been around since the 1980s.\\nContent creators have a place on the Internet, but most of the people who used it in the 1990s were consumers of static web pages and produced little content.\\nPerhaps as a result of the shift from print to the Internet, professional writers, journalists and reporters dominate content creation.\\nThere are very few content models, and people are coming to the Internet to consume or just to read.\\n\\nCompared to print, we see less (though still dominant) censorship of content during this period.\\nAs a result, people are questioning the credibility of the rapidly growing information database.\\nWeb1 has loose social networks, and a handful of \\\"Internet companies\\\" control the content on the Internet.\\nWeb1-style sites still exist today, but not typically.\\nCraigslist is an example you might be familiar with.\\n\\nWeb2: read-write\\nNext up was Web2 or the web as we know it today.\\nIt took over Web1 in the early 2000s.\\n\\nCreated by Tim O'Reilly, Web2 was driven by server upgrades, developer skills, and faster Internet speeds -- the leading way for interactive Web applications.\\nSome attribute its beginnings to the dotcom boom.\\n\\nWhile there are many companies that dominate Web2, there are also some giants that we are all familiar with.\\nIn essence, Web2 provides space for everyone to be both a content creator and a consumer - although not everyone actually makes money from what they create.\\nUsers make media on social networks, such as Facebook, and they are then able to sell their personal data to generate substantial revenues.\\nThis is perfectly permissible because centralized companies own user data and all user-generated content.\\nCensorship is somewhat removed in Web2, but it is largely platform dependent.\\nAlthough users are both suppliers and consumers on the network, they devolve power, subject to where they create and consume.\\n\\nPlatforms are isolated in Web2, and users need to create an identity between each platform in order to interact, because platforms don't \\\"talk\\\" to each other.\\nIn addition, capital accumulation is at the top.\\nPrivacy is also a huge issue, although agents have a responsibility to protect our privacy.\\n\\nWeb3: Read-write-own\\nOwnership is one of the biggest features of Web3 -- participants have full ownership of their content, data, and assets.\\n\\nLaunched in 2009, the Bitcoin network offers the spirit of the Web3 pioneers.\\nIt is important to note that the Internet is not yet what we think of as Web3, but the products and services being built are considered \\\"Web3\\\".\\nIt just means that, to varying degrees, they adhere to the principles of openness, decentralization, resistance to censorship, immutability, no trust and no permission.\\n\\nWe are slowly seeing Web2 platforms think about what it means to start building products and services that fit Web3, such as Twitter's Bluesky project, which aims to develop decentralized standards for social media.\\nAs with the shift from Web1 to Web2, the shift from Web2 to Web3 is mainly due to infrastructure advances, but there will also be a shift in the mindset of builders and developers as governance becomes more user-centric.\\nWith the man-in-the-middle removed and the data on an immutable infrastructure, the data cannot be controlled, so there is no censorship and the risk of data loss is lower.\\n\\nInteroperability is a major theme for blockchain as it will apply to Web3-based platforms.\\nAlmost like the description of the meta-universe, different platforms can be pieced together to form a fluid space where one's identity can remain unchanged, i.e. there is no need to create an account across different platforms.\\n\\nMany claim that joining Web3 is as simple as setting up your encrypted wallet, or MetaMask.\\nThere is a wallet that connects to a decentralized application for interaction and transactions.\\n\\nExamples of Web3 tools may help shape thinking.\\nThis is an excellent mapping of the Web3 protocol and its Web2 equivalent:\\n\\nMedium, for example, is a centralised tool for authors to publish and earn some income, but have no say in its governance.\\nMirrors, by contrast, allow writers to take full ownership of their work, have a say in its governance (being treated as co-owners), and make money directly from their audience.\\nThat's what we'll continue to focus on as we all move to Web3.\\nLike Web1, Web2 will always exist in some parts of the Internet, but will not dominate the space where we spend most of our future online.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ejt6NsEaCbyYBqnhZoaOL.jpg?height=471&width=942)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1634041134,\"title\":\"By comparing Web1 and Web2, we can see the Internet cultural revolution brought by Web3\"},\"digest\":\"djsqXDAEskn_0WBCENrd4RTywMcnrt_OQpU42pc-qS4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4d740E9c7DA2341bf6E6B7f58228f65599c87016\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"T0gasPpgPOqjL7vDaEKz6xAbZw7ybP75xqcsk-J02Qc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"plv9ECCj53QI0jr5CzIba6Z6Oa0gz1q8Fnu1k_OytU0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"VsJolZ0BpDKQCBcrLIGTl5nuEpUm_H-AIjd6gzJPONCrP51argTaId-oslogy0QVmHXc-0wG_X5YTM5MXIjk4g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5799513e079f1a495e3b8dcefb61c73a329734566f7f635c5065ec85d11309371d2be01161e892a679102ace47af4643145594d8d96b6967470b094d125d64d21b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"T0gasPpgPOqjL7vDaEKz6xAbZw7ybP75xqcsk-J02Qc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"plv9ECCj53QI0jr5CzIba6Z6Oa0gz1q8Fnu1k_OytU0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"djsqXDAEskn_0WBCENrd4RTywMcnrt_OQpU42pc-qS4\"}"
