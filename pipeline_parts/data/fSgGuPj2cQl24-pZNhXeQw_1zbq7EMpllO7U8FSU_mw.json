"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"One was\\ntied to my collar and the other Miss Laura put in her purse. Then I was put in a\\nbaggage car and chained in a corner. I heard Mr. Morris say that as we were only\\ngoing a short distance, it was not worth while to get an express ticket for me.\\n\\nThere was a dreadful noise and bustle at the station. Whistles were blowing and\\npeople were rushing up and down the platform. Some men were tumbling baggage so\\nfast into the car where I was, that I was afraid some of it would fall on me.\\n\\nFor a few minutes Miss Laura stood by the door and looked in, but soon the men\\nhad piled up so many boxes and trunks that she could not see me. Then she went\\naway. Mr. Morris asked one of the men to see that I did not get hurt, and I\\nheard some money rattle. Then he went away too.\\n\\nIt was the beginning of June and the weather had suddenly become very hot. We\\nhad a long, cold spring, and not being used to the heat, it seemed very hard to\\nbear.\\n\\nBefore the train started, the doors of the baggage car were closed, and it\\nbecame quite dark inside. The darkness, and the heat, and the close smell, and\\nthe noise, as we went rushing along, made me feel sick and frightened.\\n\\nI did not dare to lie down, but sat up trembling and wishing that we might soon\\ncome to Riverdale Station. But we did not get there for some time, and I was to\\nhave a great fright.\\n\\nI was thinking of all the stories that I knew of animals traveling. In February,\\nthe Drurys' Newfoundland watch-dog, Pluto, had arrived from New York, and he\\ntold Jim and me that he had a miserable journey.\\n\\nA gentleman friend of Mr. Drury's had brought him from New York. He saw him\\nchained up in his car, and he went into his Pullman, first tipping the baggage-\\nmaster handsomely to look after him. Pluto said that the baggage-master had a\\nvery red nose, and he was always getting drinks for himself when they stopped at\\na station, but he never once gave him a drink or anything to eat, from the time\\nthey left New York till they got to Fairport. When the train stopped there, and\\nPluto's chain was unfastened, he sprang out on the platform and nearly knocked\\nMr. Drury down. He saw some snow that had sifted through the station roof and he\\nwas so thirsty that he began to lick it up. When the snow was all gone, he\\njumped up and licked the frost on the windows.\\n\\nMr. Drury's friend was so angry. He found the baggage-master, and said to him:\\n\\\"What did you mean, by coming into my car every few hours, to tell me that the\\ndog was fed, and watered, and comfortable? I shall report you.\\\"\\n\\nHe went into the office at the station, and complained of the man, and was told\\nthat he was a drinking man, and was going to be dismissed.\\n\\nI was not afraid of suffering like Pluto, because it was only going to take us a\\nfew hours to get to Riverdale. I found that we always went slowly before we came\\nin to a station, and one time when we began to slacken speed I thought that\\nsurely we must be at our journey's end. However, it was not Riverdale. The car\\ngave a kind of jump, then there was a crashing sound ahead, and we stopped.\\n\\nI heard men shouting and running up and down, and I wondered what had happened.\\nIt was all dark and still in the car, and nobody came in, but the noise kept up\\noutside, and I knew something had gone wrong with the train. Perhaps Miss Laura\\nhad got hurt. Something must have happened to her or she would come to me.\\n\\nI barked and pulled at my chain till my neck was sore, but for a long, long time\\nI was there alone. The men running about outside must have heard me. If ever I\\nhear a man in trouble and crying for help I go to him and see what he wants.\\n\\nAfter such a long time that it seemed to me it must be the middle of the night,\\nthe door at the end of the car opened, and a man looked in \\\"This is all through\\nbaggage for New York, miss,\\\" I heard him say; \\\"they wouldn't put your dog in\\nhere.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, they did I am sure this is the car,\\\" I heard in the voice I knew so well,\\n\\\"and won't you get him out, please? He must be terribly frightened.\\\"\\n\\nThe man stooped down and unfastened my chain, grumbling to himself because I had\\nnot been put in another car. \\\"\\\"Some folks tumble a dog round as if he was a\\nchunk of coal,\\\" he said, patting me kindly.\\n\\nI was nearly wild with delight to get with Miss Laura again, but I had barked so\\nmuch, and pressed my neck so hard with my collar that my voice was all gone. I\\nfawned on her, and wagged myself about, and opened and shut my mouth, but no\\nsound came out of it.\\n\\nIt made Miss Laura nervous. She tried to laugh and cry at the same time, and\\nthen bit her lip hard, and said: \\\"Oh, Joe, don't.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He's lost his bark, hasn't he?\\\" said the man, looking at me curiously.\\n\\n\\\"It is a wicked thing to confine an animal in a dark and closed car,\\\" said Miss\\nLaura, trying to see her way down the steps through her tears.\\n\\nThe man put out his hand and helped her. \\\"He's not suffered much, miss,\\\" he\\nsaid; \\\"don't you distress yourself. Now if you'd been a brakeman on a Chicago\\ntrain, as I was a few years ago, and seen the animals run in for the stock\\nyards, you might talk about cruelty. Cars that ought to hold a certain number of\\npigs, or sheep, or cattle, jammed full with twice as many, and half of 'em\\nthrown out choked and smothered to death. I've seen a man running up and down,\\nraging and swearing because the railway people hadn't let him get in to tend to\\nhis pigs on the road.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Laura turned and looked at the man with a very white face. \\\"Is it like that\\nnow?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\\"No, no,\\\" he said, hastily. \\\"It's better now. They've got new regulations about\\ntaking care of the stock; but mind you, miss, the cruelty to animals isn't all\\ndone on the railways. There's a great lot of dumb creatures suffering all round\\neverywhere, and if they could speak 'twould be a hard showing for some other\\npeople besides the railway men.\\\"\\n\\nHe lifted his cap and hurried down the platform, and Miss Laura, her face very\\nmuch troubled, picked her way among the bits of coal and wood scattered about\\nthe platform, and went into the waiting room of the little station.\\n\\nShe took me up to the filter and let some water run in her hand, and gave it to\\nme to lap. Then she sat down and I leaned my head against her knees, and she\\nstroked my throat gently.\\n\\nThere were some people sitting about the room, and, from their talk, I found out\\nwhat had taken place. There had been a freight train on a side track at this\\nstation, waiting for us to get by. The switchman had carelessly left the switch\\nopen after this train went by, and when we came along afterward, our train,\\ninstead of running in by the platform, went crashing into the freight train. If\\nwe had been going fast, great damage might have been done. As it was, our engine\\nwas smashed so badly that it could not take us on; the passengers were\\nfrightened; and we were having a tedious time waiting for another engine to come\\nand take us to Riverdale.\\n\\nAfter the accident, the trainmen were so busy that Miss Laura could get no one\\nto release me.\\n\\nWhile I sat by her, I noticed an old gentleman staring at us. He was such a\\nqueer-looking old gentleman. He looked like a poodle. He had bright brown eyes,\\nand a pointed face, and a shock of white hair that he shook every few minutes.\\nHe sat with his hands clasped on the top of his cane, and he scarcely took his\\neyes from Miss Laura's face. Suddenly he jumped up and came and sat down beside\\nher.\\n\\n\\\"An ugly dog, that,\\\" he said, pointing to me.\\n\\nMost young ladies would have resented this, but Miss Laura only looked amused.\\n\\\"He seems beautiful to me,\\\" she said, gently.\\n\\n\\\"H'm, because he's your dog,\\\" said the old man, darting a sharp look at me.\\n\\\"What's the matter with him?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This is his first journey by rail, and he's a little frightened.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No wonder. The Lord only knows the suffering of animals in transportation,\\\"\\nsaid the old gentleman. \\\"My dear young lady, if you could see what I have seen,\\nyou'd never eat another bit of meat all the days of your life.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Laura wrinkled her forehead. \\\"I know I have heard,\\\" she faltered. \\\"It must\\nbe terrible.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Terrible it's awful,\\\" said the gentleman. \\\"Think of the cattle on the western\\nplains. Choked with thirst in summer, and starved and frozen in winter. Dehorned\\nand goaded on to trains and steamers. Tossed about and wounded and suffering on\\nvoyages. Many of them dying and being thrown into the sea. Others landed sick\\nand frightened. Some of them slaughtered on docks and wharves to keep them from\\ndropping dead in their tracks. What kind of food does their flesh make? It's\\nrank poison. Three of my family have died of cancer. I am a vegetarian.\\\"\\n\\nThe strange old gentleman darted from his seat, and began to pace up and down\\nthe room. I was very glad he had gone, for Miss Laura hated to hear of cruelty\\nof any kind, and her tears were dropping thick and fast on my brown coat.\\n\\nThe gentleman had spoken very loudly, and every one in the room had listened to\\nwhat he said. Among them, was a very young man, with a cold, handsome face. He\\nlooked as if he was annoyed that the older man should have made Miss Laura cry.\\n\\n\\\"Don't you think, sir,\\\" he said, as the old gentleman passed near him in walking\\nup and down the floor, \\\"that there is a great deal of mock sentiment about this\\nbusiness of taking care of the dumb creation? They were made for us. They've got\\nto suffer and be killed to supply our wants. The cattle and sheep, and other\\nanimals would over-run the earth, if we didn't kill them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Granted,\\\" said the old man, stopping right in front of him. \\\"Granted, young\\nman, if you take out that word suffer. The Lord made the sheep, and the cattle,\\nand the pigs. They are his creatures just as much as we are. We can kill them,\\nbut we've no right to make them suffer.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But we can't help it, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, we can, my young man. It's a possible thing to raise healthy stock, treat\\nit kindly, kill it mercifully, eat it decently. When men do that I, for one,\\nwill cease to be a vegetarian. You're only a boy. You haven't traveled as I\\nhave. I've been from one end of this country to the other. Up north, down south,\\nand out west, I've seen sights that made me shudder, and I tell you the Lord\\nwill punish this great American nation if it doesn't change its treatment of the\\ndumb animals committed to its care.\\\"\\n\\nThe young man looked thoughtful, and did not reply. A very sweet-faced old lady\\nsitting near him answered the old gentleman. I don't think I have ever seen such\\na fine-looking old lady as she was. Her hair was snowy white, and her face was\\ndeeply wrinkled, yet she was tall and stately, and her expression was as\\npleasing as my dear Miss Laura's.\\n\\n\\\"I do not think we are a wicked nation,\\\" she said, softly. \\\"We are a younger\\nnation than many of the nations of the earth, and I think that many of our sins\\narise from ignorance and thoughtlessness.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, madame, yes, madame,\\\" said the fiery old gentleman, staring hard at her.\\n\\\"I agree with you there.\\\"\\n\\nShe smiled very pleasantly at him and went on. \\\"I, too, have been a traveler,\\nand I have talked to a great many wise and good people on the subject of the\\ncruel treatment of animals, and I find that many of them have never thought\\nabout it. They, themselves, never knowingly ill-treat a dumb creature, and when\\nthey are told stories of inhuman conduct, they say in surprise, 'Why, these\\nthings surely can't exist!' You see they have never been brought in contact with\\nthem. As soon as they learn about them, they begin to agitate and say, 'We must\\nhave this thing stopped. Where is the remedy?'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And what is it, what is it, madame, in your opinion?\\\" said the old gentleman,\\npawing the floor with impatience.\\n\\n\\\"Just the remedy that I would propose for the great evil of intemperance,\\\" said\\nthe old lady, smiling at him. \\\"Legislation and education. Legislation for the\\nold and hardened, and education for the young and tender. I would tell the\\nschoolboys and schoolgirls that alcohol will destroy the framework of their\\nbeautiful bodies, and that cruelty to any of God's living creatures will blight\\nand destroy their innocent young souls.\\\"\\n\\nThe young man spoke again. \\\"Don't you think,\\\" he said, \\\"that you temperance and\\nhumane people lay too much stress upon the education of our youth in all lofty\\nand noble sentiments? The human heart will always be wicked. Your Bible tells\\nyou that, doesn't it? You can't educate all the badness out of children.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We don't expect to do that,\\\" said the old lady, turning her pleasant face\\ntoward him; \\\"but even if the human heart is desperately wicked, shouldn't that\\nmake us much more eager to try to educate, to ennoble, and restrain? However, as\\nfar as my experience goes, and I have lived in this wicked world for seventy-\\nfive years, I find that the human heart, though wicked and cruel, as you say,\\nhas yet some soft and tender spots, and the impressions made upon it in youth\\nare never, never effaced. Do you not remember better than anything else,\\nstanding at your mother's knee the pressure of her hand, her kiss on your\\nforehead?\\\"\\n\\nBy this time our engine had arrived. A whistle was blowing, and nearly every one\\nwas rushing from the room, the impatient old gentleman among the first. Miss\\nLaura was hurriedly trying to do up her shawl strap, and I was standing by,\\nwishing that I could help her. The old lady and the young man were the only\\nother people in the room, and we could not help hearing what they said.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I do,\\\" he said in a thick voice, and his face got very red. \\\"She is dead\\nnow I have no mother.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Poor boy!\\\" and the old lady laid her hand on his shoulder. They were standing\\nup, and she was taller than he was. \\\"May God bless you. I know you have a kind\\nheart. I have four stalwart boys, and you remind me of the youngest. If you are\\never in Washington come to see me.\\\" She gave him some name, and he lifted his\\nhat and looked as if he was astonished to find out who she was. Then he, too,\\nwent away, and she turned to Miss Laura. \\\"Shall I help you, my dear?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you please,\\\" said my young mistress. \\\"I can't fasten this strap.\\\"\\n\\nIn a few seconds the bundle was done up, and we were joyfully hastening to the\\ntrain. It was only a few miles to Riverdale, so the conductor let me stay in the\\ncar with Miss Laura. She spread her coat out on the seat in front of her, and I\\nsat on it and looked out of the car window as we sped along through a lovely\\ncountry, all green and fresh in the June sunlight. How light and pleasant this\\ncar was so different from the baggage car. What frightens an animal most of all\\nthings, is not to see where it is going, not to know what is going to happen to\\nit. I think that they are very like human beings in this respect.\\n\\nThe lady had taken a seat beside Miss Laura, and as we went along, she too\\nlooked out of the window and said in a low voice:\\n\\n\\\"What is so rare as a day in June,\\n\\nThen, if ever, come perfect days.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is very true,\\\" said Miss Laura; \\\"how sad that the autumn must come, and\\nthe cold winter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, my dear, not sad. It is but a preparation for another summer.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I suppose it is,\\\" said Miss Laura. Then she continued a little shyly, as\\nher companion leaned over to stroke my cropped ears, \\\"You seem very fond of\\nanimals.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am, my dear. I have four horses, two cows, a tame squirrel, three dogs, and a\\ncat.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You should be a happy woman,\\\" said Miss Laura, with a smile.\\n\\n\\\"I think I am. I must not forget my horned toad, Diego, that I got in\\nCalifornia. I keep him in the green-house, and he is very happy catching flies\\nand holding his horny head to be scratched whenever any one comes near.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't see how any one can be unkind to animals,\\\" said Miss Laura,\\nthoughtfully.\\n\\n\\\"Nor I, my dear child. It has always caused me intense pain to witness the\\ntorture of dumb animals. Nearly seventy years ago, when I was a little girl\\nwalking the streets of Boston, I would tremble and grow faint at the cruelty of\\ndrivers to over-loaded horses. I was timid and did not dare speak to them. Very\\noften, I ran home and flung myself in my mother's arms with a burst of tears,\\nand asked her if nothing could be done to help the poor animals. With mistaken,\\nmotherly kindness, she tried to put the subject out of my thoughts. I was\\ncarefully guarded from seeing or hearing of any instances of cruelty. But the\\nanimals went on suffering just the same, and when I became a woman, I saw my\\ncowardice. I agitated the matter among my friends, and told them that our whole\\ndumb creation was groaning together in pain, and would continue to groan, unless\\nmerciful human beings were willing to help them. I was able to assist in the\\nformation of several societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals, and\\nthey have done good service. Good service not only to the horses and cows, but\\nto the nobler animal, man. I believe that in saying to a cruel man, 'You shall\\nnot overwork, torture, mutilate, nor kill your animal, or neglect to provide it\\nwith proper food and shelter,' we are making him a little nearer the kingdom of\\nheaven than he was before. For 'Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also\\nreap.' If\\n\\nhe sows seeds of unkindness and cruelty to man and beast, no one knows what the\\nblackness of the harvest will be. His poor horse, quivering under a blow, is not\\nthe worst sufferer. Oh, if people would only understand that their unkind deeds\\nwill recoil upon their own heads with tenfold force but, my dear child, I am\\nfancying that I am addressing a drawing-room meeting and here we are at your\\nstation. Good-bye; keep your happy face and gentle ways. I hope that we may meet\\nagain some day.\\\" She pressed Miss Laura's hand, gave me a farewell pat, and the\\nnext minute we were outside on the platform, and she was smiling through the\\nwindow at us.\\n\\nCHAPTER XV OUR JOURNEY TO RIVERDALE\\n\\nEVERY other summer, the Morris children were sent to some place in the country,\\nso that they could have a change of air, and see what country life was like. As\\nthere were so many of them they usually went different ways.\\n\\nThe summer after I came to them, Jack and Carl went to an uncle in Vermont, Miss\\nLaura went to another in New Hampshire, and Ned and Willie went to visit a\\nmaiden aunt who lived in the White Mountains.\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Morris stayed at home. Fairport was a lovely place in summer, and\\nmany people came there to visit.\\n\\nThe children took some of their pets with them, and the others they left at home\\nfor their mother to take care of. She never allowed them to take a pet animal\\nanywhere, unless she knew it would be perfectly welcome. \\\"Don't let your pets be\\na worry to other people,\\\" she often said to them, \\\"or they will dislike them and\\nyou too.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Laura went away earlier than the others, for she had run down through the\\nspring, and was pale and thin. One day, early in June, we set out. I say \\\"we,\\\"\\nfor after my adventure with Jenkins, Miss Laura said that I should never be\\nparted from her. If any one invited her to come and see them and didn't want me,\\nshe would stay at home.\\n\\nThe whole family went to the station to see us off. They put a chain on my\\ncollar and took me to the baggage office and got two tickets for me. One was\\ntied to my collar and the other Miss Laura put in her purse. Then I was put in a\\nbaggage car and chained in a corner. I heard Mr. Morris say that as we were only\\ngoing a short distance, it was not worth while to get an express ticket for me.\\n\\nThere was a dreadful noise and bustle at the station. Whistles were blowing and\\npeople were rushing up and down the platform.

We can kill them,\\nbut we've no right to make them suffer.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But we can't help it, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, we can, my young man. It's a possible thing to raise healthy stock, treat\\nit kindly, kill it mercifully, eat it decently. When men do that I, for one,\\nwill cease to be a vegetarian. You're only a boy. You haven't traveled as I\\nhave. I've been from one end of this country to the other. Up north, down south,\\nand out west, I've seen sights that made me shudder, and I tell you the Lord\\nwill punish this great American nation if it doesn't change its treatment of the\\ndumb animals committed to its care.\\\"\\n\\nThe young man looked thoughtful, and did not reply. A very sweet-faced old lady\\nsitting near him answered the old gentleman. I don't think I have ever seen such\\na fine-looking old lady as she was. Her hair was snowy white, and her face was\\ndeeply wrinkled, yet she was tall and stately, and her expression was as\\npleasing as my dear Miss Laura's.\\n\\n\\\"I do not think we are a wicked nation,\\\" she said, softly. \\\"We are a younger\\nnation than many of the nations of the earth, and I think that many of our sins\\narise from ignorance and thoughtlessness.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, madame, yes, madame,\\\" said the fiery old gentleman, staring hard at her.\\n\\\"I agree with you there.\\\"\\n\\nShe smiled very pleasantly at him and went on. \\\"I, too, have been a traveler,\\nand I have talked to a great many wise and good people on the subject of the\\ncruel treatment of animals, and I find that many of them have never thought\\nabout it. They, themselves, never knowingly ill-treat a dumb creature, and when\\nthey are told stories of inhuman conduct, they say in surprise, 'Why, these\\nthings surely can't exist!' You see they have never been brought in contact with\\nthem. As soon as they learn about them, they begin to agitate and say, 'We must\\nhave this thing stopped. Where is the remedy?'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And what is it, what is it, madame, in your opinion?\\\" said the old gentleman,\\npawing the floor with impatience.\\n\\n\\\"Just the remedy that I would propose for the great evil of intemperance,\\\" said\\nthe old lady, smiling at him. \\\"Legislation and education. Legislation for the\\nold and hardened, and education for the young and tender. I would tell the\\nschoolboys and schoolgirls that alcohol will destroy the framework of their\\nbeautiful bodies, and that cruelty to any of God's living creatures will blight\\nand destroy their innocent young souls.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1640140557,\"title\":\"\\nThe whole family went to the station to see us off.
