"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Solana's blockchain performance was reportedly hit by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack over the past 24 hours, however the network appears to have remained online throughout.\\n\\nA DDoS attack generally refers to a large number of coordinated devices, or a botnet overwhelming a network with fake traffic to take it offline.\\n\\nThis wouldn't be the first time Solana has [suffered this issue](https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-and-arbitrum-knocked-offline-while-ethereum-evades-attack), with Cointelegraph reporting in September that the network [suffered a 17-hour-outage](https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-attributes-major-outage-to-denial-of-service-attack-targeting-dex-offering) due to mass botting activity for an initial DEX offering (IDO) on Solana-based [DEX platform Raydium](https://cointelegraph.com/news/strong-fundamentals-lure-traders-back-to-audius-raydium-and-helium).\\n\\nThe latest DDoS attack was highlighted by Solana-based NFT platform Blockasset on Dec. 9 around 3 pm UTC, after it noted that:\\n\\n> “We are aware tokens are taking a long time to distribute. The Solana chain is being overloaded with DDoS attacks which have clogged the network causing delays.”\\n\\nSolana-focused infrastructure firm GenesysGo also reported on the matter, stating that the validator network was experiencing issues with processing transaction requests, but called for calm as it attributed the problem to “growing pains.”\\n\\n> The [#Solana](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Solana?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) validator network is experiencing issues this morning. TPS issues as the network works to process txn requests. \\n Remember, this is blockchain If your txn ID went through then it’s not lost, just pending. Growing pains is all!
