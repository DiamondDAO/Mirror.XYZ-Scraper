"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"What seems “fair” to you? 10%? 5%? 300% .01%?\\n\\nIt’s all about context obviously. Car loans. Mortgages. Savings accounts.  Loans between friends.\\n\\nSo lets make it really simple. How much do you deserve for existing? If your dollars are your “value”- what interest rate seems fair?\\n\\nIt’s not easy to save up. In fact- I’d say it goes against a lot of our natural impulses and daily influences. Content creators, adverts, commercials, influencers, celebrities, friends, special interest groups, and even our beloved politicians try to get us to spend our money with someone or on something else.\\n\\nAnything besides our savings accounts!\\n\\nAnd even if you do have the conviction to save up- you’d be LUCKY to get 2% or even 1% in some cases.\\n\\nI’m not asking for much. In fact- I don’t own any stocks or meme coins in search of the ever elusive “MOON”. But a nice guaranteed 4-5% for my hard-earned savings seems pretty reasonable. Let’s outpace; or AT LEAST keep up with inflation!\\n\\nNow let’s take it a step further.\\n\\nWHY does my humble pile of money deserve an interest rate at all?\\n\\nI earned some money. Good for me. Keep working and grow it by stacking more. Or go spend it and enjoy life. That’s it. Move on.\\n\\nNo! My pile of money serves a purpose.\\n\\nLet’s imagine my pile of money is represented by computer chips instead of dollar bills. And every computer chip I have can hook up to a network of other chips. The more chips- the bigger (and better) the network becomes. Your chips are always distinguishable as being your own and you can remove them from the network whenever you want.\\n\\nThis means that my extra “money” can do something when I’m not using it. Like confirm transactions or make calculations. I just have to pool it together and hook it up to the network. A network which I’m happy to contribute to because it allows for others to transact and earn just as I am able to.\\n\\nThis ability to provide value by pooling resources together is what allows some blockchains to offer you a \\\"fair” (by my standards) return on your savings.\\n\\nYou deserve that. Whether you’ve got $1 or $1,000,000. Everyone deserves that.\",\"timestamp\":1641438011,\"title\":\"Fucking interest rates.\"},\"digest\":\"1U6MCsJYlP_i1v0VQeFlUrd2sKj6Uqs8B2RSBp7N4jQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x35FdAF27dD0416fdfAE00D12f769d0EED66aA1F8\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fSyywgNzdaUIbJ_u0iwpc1zldS7biZUvW3wmH3dCpao\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"124a5sZI4SFQ-1wzc3EnhiFjlzblEjej2lTSp_ZjGiA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"23aQoRyDK72PnnvvPdNET_VFMxCV2UnClXQ8ltNQLE-ok4SDFlUyjERdmz7pPDT_AkahtqshdXpDXNjgzYoFfg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xeaec479abde8f31a96a76db1543e5fba5cd3a628f26b09e5f729a5716e49abfb5b1baa20bb3c6a97e60cc8ffbe69c365ddfc6b0a69b1f267916365274084bef91c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fSyywgNzdaUIbJ_u0iwpc1zldS7biZUvW3wmH3dCpao\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"124a5sZI4SFQ-1wzc3EnhiFjlzblEjej2lTSp_ZjGiA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"LCUjCRaWp_0Qr1eT-TMte6TAdC2lzqu8xZWgkNCRB9g\"}"
