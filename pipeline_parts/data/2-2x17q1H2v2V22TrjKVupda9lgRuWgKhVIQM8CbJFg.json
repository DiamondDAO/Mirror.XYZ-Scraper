The growth rate of actual use of foreign investment in high-tech industries hit 23.7 percent.\\n\\nThe videoconference between Chinese President Xi Jinping and United States President Joe Biden has showed the direction of Sino-US relations and set a baseline tone for their communications in the economics and trade sector, Shu added.\\n\\nEconomics and trade teams from the two nations will implement the consensus, and the ministry will update the public with any new information.\\n\\nZhou Mi, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, said China and the US have huge cooperation potential in economics and trade, as reflected by the fast growth of their bilateral trade despite impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nThe additional tariffs adopted by the two countries amid the trade dispute have imposed disruptions on market and economic activity, and the two nations should strengthen dialogue to ease uncertainties for investors, especially those related to inflation and supply chain stress, Zhou said.\\n\\nThe fast rise of FDI into China not only showed foreign investors' confidence in China, but also helped safeguard the interests of foreign investors and global supply chains, he added.\\n\\nSwire Coca-Cola, the fifth largest bottling partner of Coca-Cola by global volume, recently announced the launch of an expansion and reconstruction project for its Zhengzhou factory in Henan province, with a total investment of no less than 900 million yuan.\\n\\nSwire Coca-Cola values China's vibrant and fast-growing market.
