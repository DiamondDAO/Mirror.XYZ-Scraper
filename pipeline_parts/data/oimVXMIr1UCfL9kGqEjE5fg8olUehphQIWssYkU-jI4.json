"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## 1/ Allocate membership tokens based on Log(production)\\n\\nTokens = shares = votes. Most coops have a 1 member = 1 vote model. \\n\\nInstead, grant a utility token based on a Log(production) formula, e.g., a farm that produces 1000 units gets 3 tokens and a farm that produces 10 units gets 1 token. A utility token is required to sell coffee through the cooperative, participate in governance, and receive other benefits. \\n\\nThe goal is to give a bit more power to bigger farms, but not too much.\\n\\n## 2/ Mint \\\"lots\\\" as NFTs\\n\\nA \\\"lot\\\" is coffee industry-speak for an atomic unit of coffee production. \\n\\nEach lot has non-fungible properties including: varietal(s), date(s), processing, cup score, provenance, etc. You see some of these properties printed on the bag at specialty coffee shops and all of them in the fine print of actual green coffee contracts. \\n\\nWhen a lot is bagged and tagged, it could be minted as an NFT that reflects the physical lot. And the NFT is \\\"burned\\\" when it's sold to a roaster. (Hopefully the roaster IRL doesn't go too far past second crack!) \\n\\n## 3/ Give producers a cut of all downstream sales\\n\\nThe traditional coffee trade has a \\\"buy low, sell high\\\" mentality. This creates lots of haggling and mistrust over price.\\n\\nIf each lot were an NFT, the cooperative could earn 100% of the first sale and a 10% royalty on each subsequent sale. \\n\\nThis would better align incentives throughout the chain and create less pressure for the cooperative to have a high floor price (asking price) during the harvest. \\n\\n## 4/ Adopt DAO governance and treasury best practices\\n\\nCorruption and cronyism are major issues for coops.\\n\\nOn-chain voting and multi-sig wallets could improve transparency. So too would predetermined protocols and treasury allocations for services like milling and management compensation.\\n\\nReputation metrics, such as participation in meetings and cup quality, could help qualify members for governance roles. \\n\\n## 5/ Use smart contracts for hedging and logistics\\n\\nFutures and options strategies to hedge price and currency risk could be executed algorithmically, like the major trading houses already do.\\n\\nA fair amount of logistics work (insurance, vessel booking, document forwarding, etc) could too.\\n\\nThe infrastructure may not all be there today, but it should be soon as none of these requirements are unique to coffee. \\n\\n## 6/ Reward members\\n\\n✅ Cashless payments + royalties \\n\\n✅ USDC staking + lending \\n\\n✅ Payments for ecosystem services / verified carbon offsets \\n\\n✅ Tips from end consumers \\n\\n✅ Results-based financing of impact outcomes.\\n\\n.. and much more!\",\"timestamp\":1637680781,\"title\":\"Blueprint for a Web3 Coffee Cooperative\"},\"digest\":\"ii1Hahogg0cUjdBhuFUTskru2Hs6HEozUS4ZesC3ou4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5a5D9aB7b1bD978F80909503EBb828879daCa9C3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"B0riQ0zqeSQiGpY5oDTmBmvrnJqfj4Y4SAITBCnEhcg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DKQ2xNJQGITQD8AVVlzPPDMX3pfQDQdLd9edzyUKlIo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"rljknVa289aPGLmsWiCAxzatF5gUJKEiW2Rlkf9LiNKZTo26N_XSLBwKeSSe7wVousr3m00KqiG2GtxtZeEeRg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x3b08eeb76589a4153c5013321b0ce19de6bf584cbafc2ba8cf06d99b9f90ae877446c5575b4d897de73a69de7299a2e1f1b26caae9d4476e94787dd46c6d943a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"B0riQ0zqeSQiGpY5oDTmBmvrnJqfj4Y4SAITBCnEhcg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DKQ2xNJQGITQD8AVVlzPPDMX3pfQDQdLd9edzyUKlIo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ii1Hahogg0cUjdBhuFUTskru2Hs6HEozUS4ZesC3ou4\"}"
