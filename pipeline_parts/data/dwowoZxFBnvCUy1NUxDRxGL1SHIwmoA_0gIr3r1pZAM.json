"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"by a short canal.  The town of Sotulje lies at its entrance, charmingly situated in a narrow valley at the foot of a rather steep hill.  This lake at first resembles a broad river, but widens at every step, and soon shews itself in its whole expanse.  The passage of the Malarsee takes four hours, and is one of the most charming excursions that can be made.  It is said to contain about a thousand islets of various sizes; and it may be imagined how varied in form and feature the scenery must be, and, like the fiord of the Baltic, what a constant succession of new scenes it must present.\\n\\nThe shores also are very beautiful:  in some spots hills descend sharply to the water's edge, the steep rocks forming dangerous points; on others dark, sombre pine-forests grow; and again there are gay valleys and meadows, with villages or single cottages.  Many travellers assert that this lake is, after all, very monotonous; but I cannot agree with their opinion.  I found it so attractive, that I could repeat the journey many times without wearying of this lovely sameness.  It certainly has not the majestic backgrounds of the Swiss lakes; but this profusion of small islands is a pleasing peculiarity which can be found on no other lake.\\n\\nOn the summit of a steep precipice of the shore the hat of the unfortunate Eric is hoisted, fastened to a long pole.  History tells that this king fled from the enemy in a battle; that one of his soldiers pursued him, and reproached him for his cowardice, whereupon Eric, filled with shame and despair, gave spurs to his horse and leaped into the fearful abyss.  At his fall his hat was blown from his head, and was left on this spot.\\n\\nNot far from this point the suburbs of Stockholm make their appearance, being spread round one of the broad arms of the lake. With increasing curiosity we gazed towards the town as we gradually approached it.  Many of the pretty villas, which are situated in the valleys or on the sides of the hills as forerunners of the town, come into view, and the suburbs rise amphi-theatrically on the steep shores.  The town itself closes the prospect by occupying the whole upper shore of the lake, and is flanked by the suburbs at either side.  The Ritterholm church, with its cast-iron perforated towers, and the truly grand royal palace, which is built entirely in the Italian style, can be seen and admired from this distance.\\n\\nWe had scarcely cast anchor in the port of Stockholm, when a number of Herculean women came and offered us their services as porters. They were Delekarliers, {52} who frequently come to Stockholm to earn a livelihood as porters, water-carriers, boatwomen, &c.  They easily find employment, because they possess two excellent qualities:  they are said to be exceedingly honest and hard-working, and, at the same time, have the strength and perseverance of men.\\n\\nTheir dress consists of black petticoats, which come half way over the calf of the leg, red bodices, white chemises with long sleeves, short narrow aprons of two colours, red stockings, and shoes with wooden soles an inch thick.  They twist a handkerchief round their head, or put on a little close black cap, which fits close on the back part of the head.\\n\\nIn Stockholm there are entire houses, as well as single rooms, which, as in a hotel, are let by the day.  They are much cheaper than hotels, and are therefore more in demand.  I at once hired one of these rooms, which was very clean and bright, and for which, with breakfast, I only paid one riksdaler, which is about one shilling.\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\nAs my journey was ostensibly only to Iceland, and as I only paid a flying visit to this portion of Scandinavia, my readers will pardon me if I treat it briefly.  This portion of Europe has been so frequently and so excellently described by other travellers, that my observations would be of little importance.\\n\\nI remained in Stockholm six days, and made as good use of my time as I could.  The town is situated on the shores of the Baltic Sea and the Malar lake.  These two waters are connected by a short canal, on whose shores the most delightful houses are erected.\\n\\nMy first visit was to the beautiful church of Ritterholm, which is used more for a cemetery and an armory than for a place of worship. The vaults serve as burial-places for the kings, and their monuments are erected in the side-chapels.  On each side of the nave of the church are placed effigies of armed knights on horseback, whose armour belonged to the former kings of Sweden.  The walls and angles of the church are profusely decorated with flags and standards, said to number five thousand.  In addition to this, the keys of conquered towns and fortresses hang along the side-walls, and drums are piled upon the floor; trophies taken from different nations with which Sweden has been at war.\\n\\nBesides these curiosities, several coats of armour and garments of Swedish regents are displayed behind glass-cases in the side- chapels.  Among them, the dress which Charles XII. wore on the day of his death, and his hat perforated by a ball, interested me most. His riding-boots stand on the ground beside it.  The modern dress and hat, embroidered with gold and ornamented with feathers, of the last king, the founder of the new dynasty, is not less interesting, partly perhaps from the great contrast.\\n\\nThe church of St. Nicholas stands on the same side of the canal, and is one of the finest Protestant churches I had seen; it is very evident that it was built in Catholic times, and that its former decorations have been allowed to remain.  It contains several large and small oil-paintings, some ancient and some modern monuments, and a profusion of gilding.  The organ is fine and large; flanking the entrance of the church are beautiful reliefs, hewn in stone; and above it, carved in wood, a statue of the archangel Michael, larger than life, sitting on horseback on a bridge, in the act of killing the dragon.\\n\\nNear the church is situated the royal palace, which needs a more fluent pen than mine to describe it.  It would fill a volume were I to enumerate and describe the treasures, curiosities, and beauties of its construction, or its interior arrangement; I can only say that I never saw any thing to equal it, except the royal palace of Naples.  Such an edifice is the more surprising in the north, and in a country which has never been overstocked with wealth.\\n\\nThe church of Shifferholm is remarkable only for its position and its temple-like form; it stands on the ledge of a rock facing the, royal palace, on the opposite shore of the same indentation of the Baltic.  A long bridge of boats leads from the one to the other.\\n\\nThe church of St. Catharine is large and beautiful.  In an outer angle of the church is shewn the stone on which one of the brothers Sturre was beheaded. {53}\\n\\nOn the Ritterplatz stands the Ritterhouse, a very fine palace; also the old royal palace, and several other royal and private mansions; but they are not nearly so numerous nor so fine as in Copenhagen, and the streets and squares also cannot be compared with those of the capital of Denmark.\\n\\nThe finest prospect is from a hill in one of the suburbs called the Great Mosbecken; it affords a magnificent view of the sea and the lake, of the town and its suburbs, as far as the points of the mountains, and of the lovely country-houses which border the shores of lake and sea.  The town and its environs are so interspersed with islets and rocks, that these seem to be part of the town; and this gives Stockholm such a curious appearance, that I can compare it to no other city I have seen.  Wooded hills and naked rocks prolong the view, and their ridges extend into the far distance; while level fields and lawns take up but a very small proportion of the magnificent scenery.\\n\\nOn descending from this hill the traveller should not fail to go to Sodermalm, and to inspect the immense iron-stores, where iron is heaped up in countless bars.  The corn-market of Stockholm is insignificant.  The principal buildings besides those already enumerated are, the bank, the mint, the guard-house, the palace of the crown-prince, the theatre, &c.  The latter is interesting, partly because Gustavus III. was shot in it.  He fell on the stage, while a grand masquerade was taking place, for which the theatre had been changed into a ball-room.  The king was shot by a mask, and died in a few hours.\\n\\nThere is not a representation in the theatre every night; and on the one evening of performance during my visit a festival was to be celebrated in the hall of antiquities.  The esteemed artist Vogelberg, a native of Sweden, had beautifully sculptured the three heathen gods, Thor, Balder, and Odin, in colossal size, and brought them over from Rome.  The statues had only been lately placed, and a large company had been invited to meet in the illuminated saloon, and do honour to the artist.  Solemn hymns were to be sung at the uncovering of the statues, beside other festivities.  I was fortunate enough to receive an invitation to this festival, which was to commence a little past seven.  Before that I went to the theatre, which, I was told, would open at half-past six.  I intended to remain there half an hour, and then drive to the palace, where my friends would meet me to accompany me to the festival.  I went to the theatre at six, and anxiously waited half an hour for the commencement of the overture; it was after half-past six, and no signs of the commencement.  I looked again at the bill, and saw, to my annoyance, that the opera did not begin till seven.  But as I would not leave until I had seen the stage, I spent the time in looking at the theatre itself.  It is tolerably large, and has five tiers of boxes, but is neither tastefully nor richly decorated.  I was most surprised at the exorbitant price and the variety of seats. I counted twenty-six different kinds; it seems that every row has a different price, else I don't understand how they could make such a variety.\\n\\nAt last the overture began; I listened to it, saw the curtain rise, looked at the fatal spot, and left after the first air.  The door- keeper followed me, took my arm, and wished to give me a return- ticket; and when I told him that I did not require one, as I did not intend to return, he said that it had only just commenced, and that I ought to stop, and not have spent all the money for nothing.  I was unfortunately too little acquainted with the Swedish language to explain the reason of my departure, so I could give him no answer, but went away.  I, however, heard him say to some one, \\\"I never met with such a woman before; she sat an hour looking at the curtain, and goes away as soon as it rises.\\\"  I looked round and saw how he shook his head thoughtfully, and pointed with his forefinger to his forehead.  I could not refrain from smiling, and enjoyed the scene as much as I should have done the second act of Mozart's Don Giovanni.\\n\\nI called for my friends at the royal palace, and spent the evening very agreeably in the brilliantly-illuminated galleries of antiquities and of pictures.  I had the pleasure also of being introduced to Herr Vogelberg.  His modest, unpretending manners must inspire every one with respect, even if one does not know what distinguished talent he possesses.\\n\\nThe royal park is one of the finest sights in the neighbourhood of Stockholm, and is one of the best of its kind.  It is a fine large natural park, with an infinity of groves, meadows, hills, and rocks; here and there lies a country-house with its fragrant flower-garden, or tasteful coffee and refreshment houses, which on fine Sundays are filled with visitors from the town.  Good roads are made through the park, and commodious paths lead to the finest points of view over sea and land.\\n\\nThe bust of the popular poet Bellmann stands on an open sunny spot, and an annual festival is given here in his honour.\\n\\nDeeper in the park lies the so-called Rosenthal (Rose valley), a real Eden.  The late king was so partial to this spot, that he spent many hours in the little royal country-house here, which is built on a retired spot in the midst of groves and flower-beds.  In front of the palace stands a splendid vase made of a single piece of porphyry.  I was told that it was the largest in Europe, but I consider the one in the Museum of Naples much larger.\\n\\nI spent the last hours of my visit to Stockholm in this spot, with the amiable family of Herr Boje from Finnland, whose acquaintance I had made on the journey from Gottenburg to Stockholm.  I shall therefore never forget this beautiful park and the agreeable associations connected with it.\\n\\nI made a very agreeable excursion also to the royal palace of Haga, to the large cemetery, and to the military school Karlberg.\\n\\nThe royal castle of Haga is surrounded by a magnificent park, which owes little to art; it contains some of the finest trees, with here and there a hill, and is crossed by majestic alleys and well-kept roads for driving and walking.  The palace itself is so small, that I could not but admire the moderation of the royal family; but I was informed that this is the smallest of their summer palaces.\\n\\nNearly opposite to this park is the great cemetery; but as it has only existed for about seventeen years, the trees in it are yet rather young.  This would be of little consequence in other countries, but in Sweden the cemeteries serve as promenades, and are crossed by alleys, ornamented with groves, and provided with seats for the accommodation of visitors.  This cemetery is surrounded by a dark pine-forest, and really seems quite shut off from the outer world.  It is the only burial-place out of the town; the others all lie between the churches and the neighbouring houses, whose fronts often form the immediate boundary.  Burials take place there constantly, so that the inhabitants are quite familiar with the aspect of death.\\n\\nFrom the great cemetery a road leads to the neighbouring Karlberg, which is the academy for military and naval cadets.  The extensive buildings attached to this seminary are built on the slope of a mountain, which is washed on one side by the waters of the lake, and surrounded on the other by the beautiful park-plantations.\\n\\nBefore leaving Stockholm I had the honour of being introduced to her majesty the Queen of Sweden.  She had heard of my travels, and took a particular interest in my account of Palestine.  In consequence of this favour, I received the special permission to inspect the whole interior of the palace.  Although it was inhabited, I was conducted, not only through the state-rooms, but through all the private rooms of the court.  It would be impossible to describe the splendour which reigns here, the treasures of art, the magnificent appointments, and the evident taste every where displayed.  I was delighted with all the treasures and splendour, but still more with the warm interest with which her majesty conversed with me about Palestine.  This interview will ever dwell on my memory as the bright salient point of my northern expedition.\\n\\nEXCURSION TO THE OLD ROYAL CASTLE OF GRIPTHOLM ON THE MALARSEE\\n\\nEvery Sunday morning, at eight o'clock, a little steamer leaves Stockholm for this castle; the distance is about forty-five miles, and is passed in four hours; four hours more are allowed for the stay, and in the evening the steamer returns to Stockholm.  This excursion is very interesting, although we pass the greater part of the time on that portion of the lake which we had seen on our arrival, but for the last few miles the ship turned into a pretty bay, at whose apex the castle is situated.  It is distinguished for its size, its architecture, and its colossal turrets.  It is unfortunately, however, painted with the favourite brick-red colour of the Swedes.\\n\\nTwo immense cannons, which the Swedes once gained in battle from the Russians, stand in the courtyard.  The apartments in the castle, which are kept in good condition, display neither splendour nor profusion of appointments, indeed almost the contrary.  The pretty theatre is, however, an exception:  for its walls are inlaid from top to bottom with mirrors, its pillars are gilt, and the royal box tapestried with rich red velvet.  There has been no performance here since the death of Gustavus III.\\n\\nThe immensely massive walls are a remarkable feature of this palace, and must measure about three yards in thickness in the lower stories.\\n\\nThe upper apartments are all large and high, and afford a splendid view of the lake from their windows.  But it is impossible to enjoy these beautiful scenes when one thinks of the sad events which have taken place here.\\n\\nTwo kings, John III. and Eric XIV., the latter with four of his ministers, who were subsequently beheaded, were imprisoned here for many years.  The captivity of John III. would not have been so bad, if captivity were not bad enough in itself.  He was confined in a large splendid saloon, but which he was not permitted to quit, and which he would therefore probably have gladly exchanged for the poorest hut and liberty.  His wife inhabited two smaller apartments adjoining; she was not treated as a prisoner, and could leave the castle at will.  His son Sigismund was born here in the year 1566, and the room and bed in which he was born are still shewn as curiosities.\\n\\nEric's fate was much more unfortunate, for he was kept in narrow and dark confinement.  A small rudely-furnished apartment, with narrow, iron-barred windows, in one of the little turrets was his prison. The entrance was closed by a solid oaken door, in which a small opening had been made, through which his food was given him.  For greater security this oaken door was covered by an iron one.  Round the outside of the apartment a narrow gallery had been made, on which the guards were posted, and could at all times see their prisoner through the barred windows.  The spot is still shewn at one of the windows where the king sat for hours looking into the distance, his head leaning on his hand.  What must have been his feelings as he gazed on the bright sky, the verdant turf, and the smiling lake!  How many sighs must have been echoed from these walls, how many sleepless nights must he have passed during those two long years in anxious expectation of the future!\\n\\nThe guide who took us round the castle maintained that the floor was more worn on this spot than any where else, and that the window-sash had been hollowed by the elbow of the miserable king; but I could not perceive any difference.  Eric was kept imprisoned here for two years, and was then taken to another prison.\\n\\nThere is a large picture-gallery in this castle; but it contains principally portraits of kings, not only of Sweden, but of other countries, from the Middle Ages down to the present time; also portraits of ministers, generals, painters, poets, and learned men; of celebrated Swedish females, who have sacrificed themselves for their country, and of the most celebrated female beauties.  The name and date of birth of each person are affixed to his or her portrait, so that each visitor may find his favourite without guide or catalogue.  In many of them the colouring and drawing are wretched enough, but we will hope that the resemblance is all the more striking.\\n\\nOn our return several gentlemen were kind enough to direct my attention to the most interesting points of the lake.  Among these I must mention Kakeholm, its broadest point; the island of Esmoi, on which a Swedish female gained a battle; Norsberg, also celebrated for a battle which took place there; and Sturrehof, the property of a great Swedish family.  Near Bjarkesoe a simple cross is erected, ostensibly on the spot where Christianity was first introduced. Indeed the Malarsee has so many historical associations, in addition to the attractions of its scenery, that it is one of the most interesting seas not only of Sweden but of Europe.\\n\\nJOURNEY FROM STOCKHOLM TO UPSALA AND TO THE IRON-MINES OF DANEMORA\\n\\nSeptember 12th.\",\"timestamp\":1637496402,\"title\":\"\\nWe left the sea, and entered another lake, the Malarsee, celebrated for its numerous islands\"},\"digest\":\"Omp8SUGq1MJTOLqnOCE7GGEjqLfL3SuLnJiErNy24So\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x19BebfD5a2946bC50A2CeA661e77fFC2F12C9549\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1g4TOA4b1Vhe6svchpKh-tlYFyQxdvhUwFhlB5KMfEU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"fvAO850IOnn4KwHSQ2glJNep5b3I119FuEyyrZcdoBs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"EKBm4fUHRZHhHS9c_QxnyrMXfBOe5jlw-m-vOZpS2BxbzSPgniA4w96AbWN8ITLxZ2agRF4xfJ3eUqOWp5PKzw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa0268bd271d3fa473e648fc038725bc886ab80ae62f659ca9e6ffb50bbf22020204a2a16975a42063ff088a935de51f97ee7586fa22858b36af94baa45a99b721b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1g4TOA4b1Vhe6svchpKh-tlYFyQxdvhUwFhlB5KMfEU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"fvAO850IOnn4KwHSQ2glJNep5b3I119FuEyyrZcdoBs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Omp8SUGq1MJTOLqnOCE7GGEjqLfL3SuLnJiErNy24So\"}"
