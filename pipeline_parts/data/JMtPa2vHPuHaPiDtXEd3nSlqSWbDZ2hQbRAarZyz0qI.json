The two companies will jointly explore the application of privacy computing technology in DeFi, and work together to build a PlatON-based DeFi ecosystem.\\n\\nWith years of experience in the field of privacy computing and blockchain data security, PlatON has achieved fruitful research and development results and has been at the forefront of the industry. To enable multi-source heterogeneous data to flow and connect securely under scalable privacy protection, PlatON has created a new generation of high-performance public chain to support all types of distributed applications and distributed AI with a computing system assembled by verifiable computing, secure multi-party computing, zero-knowledge proof, homomorphic encryption, secret sharing and other cryptographic algorithms.\\n\\nWePiggy focuses on building an open source, non-custodial crypto asset lending market protocol that helps users realize asset appreciation and maximize utilization across many blockchain networks. On the premise of giving priority to funding security, WePiggy actively creates a more diverse lending market, optimizes the execution efficiency of smart contracts, and expands more dimensions of the business logic. Under the WePiggy multi-chain deployment plan, WePiggy is covering Ethereum, OKExChain, Binance Smart Chain, Huobi Eco Chain, and innovative public and Layer-2 networks represented by PlatON.\\n\\nWePiggy will work in depth with PlatON to combine WePiggy’s brand strengths and expertise in DeFi applications with PlatON’s leading privacy computing technology for the creation of differentiated lending protocols. Besides, the WePiggy development team will provide intellectual support for PlatON’s DeFi application incubation and public chain infrastructure layout, cultivating the soil for PlatON’s DeFi privacy ecosystem to thrive.\\n\\nA sufficiently decentralized network of validators has always been the cornerstone of the survival of any public chain. The WePiggy development team has operated large server clusters and has three years of experience in public chain validator construction and optimization. After the launch of PlatON’s MainNetwork, WePiggy, as a synthesis of DeFi applications, communities, and developers, will put its business features in to play and actively participate in the construction of PlatON’s validator network, contributing to the decentralization of the PlatON network and the spread of PlatON’s new technical features.\\n\\nIn the near future, the two companies will also explore how to implement privacy Token casting, destruction, and the ability to interact with standard Token (non-privacy Token) in the DeFi lending protocol through the privacy Token contract standard, and use cryptography to implement new user identity algorithms to help users better protect their private data and information.\\n\\nCommenting on the partnership, James Qu, PlatON’s Chief Technology Officer, said, “PlatON has been committed to building a global distributed privacy AI network to provide infrastructure to support future large-scale data asset exchanges. This partnership with WePiggy will continue to deepen collaboration at the brand market, ecosystem development, and the underlying levels of technology, and will work together to empower DeFi application with security defense capabilities. We will jointly build a security ecosystem for PlatON technologies while fully expanding and laying out the DeFi application blueprint. ”\\n\\n## **About PlatON**\\n\\nPlatON is a Singapore-based public blockchain network, which strives to lead in privacy-preserving computation and become the next-generation infrastructure for the distributed economy. It is dedicated to developing a secure, scalable, and high-performance computing network with first-class privacy preservation features, built on its advanced computation architecture and cryptography algorithms, including verifiable computation (VC), secure multi-party computation (MPC), zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), and homomorphic encryption. PlatON aims to become the open-source public infrastructure for AI and distributed applications for developers, data providers and institutions and individuals with privacy-sensitive computing demands around the world.\\n\\nWebsite: <https://www.platon.network/en>\\n\\nTwitter: <https://twitter.com/PlatON_Network>\\n\\nTelegram: <https://t.me/PlatONNetwork>\\n\\nMedium: <https://medium.com/@platon-network>\\n\\n## **About WePiggy**\\n\\nWePiggy is an open-source, non-custodial, crypto-asset lending market protocol.
