I wanted to do, bumble my way through, and keep bumbling - until that moment when the body understands, the body feels, the body knows.  \\n\\nBut I hesitate to use that phrase (“the body”) without qualification. These wondrous moments of struggle and breakthrough to learning are not of a (brute) physical nature. \\n\\nBy using that phrase, I guess I am trying to indicate that we are dealing with the mystery of the human will. \\n\\nIt knows in a way that the intellect doesn’t. \\n\\nLearning a new sport is maybe the analogous experience most can recall and relate to.\\n\\nWhen I first re-taught myself how to swim, I pored over books and magazines with Olympians on the cover. I memorized the nuanced descriptions of the mechanics of each stroke. Every move I made in the swimming pool was halting, hesitant, suffused with conscious thought. \\n\\nThink, think, think.\\n\\nThen finally came **the** moment. The moment when thought stops… \\n\\nAnd I just move. I just do. And in that moving, and doing, I suddenly understand more than anything the books and articles and experts could have written. \\n\\nBack to Forefront, and the one thing I wanted.\\n\\nI wanted to discover my own answer to the question, “Why is it that, everywhere I turn in my corner of the Twitter-verse, I see - \\n\\nDAO\\n\\nDAO\\n\\nDAO?”\\n\\nI knew I had to jump in. I had to just **do**, to get to that moment when thought stops. \\n\\nI could never have imagined then, three months ago, that I would be where I am today. \\n\\n[https://youtu.be/TWkpcxHW76E](https://youtu.be/TWkpcxHW76E)\\n\\nSigning off, with gratitude to the Forefront fam and especially, Carlos, Jihad, Chase and CPTNSkeletor. \",\"timestamp\":1633064581,\"title\":\"Genesis\",\"publication\":\"tao-of-dao\"},\"digest\":\"wJFMtwkxJKzJI4_hvpkBncBsVjadqqeCfnXId4HLaVI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xF737EBd5f22E661136737bb92218B398Fb0Ab584\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eG1ncxLbP3Y3-HnZLVFakeQikGvHerdPrtFGksNHE0o\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"GVywSyNC6ZGm3ypuiZjEsn4dBWVyNxBotd2rmRdcEQI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"HXnE1fGAgBQWJ2zcEbX6xYNdC-iWbhrfC3cnbPa5lzS22Twm6B1uirX0Q-PR5Pv22R6jLtqYqzStOx_ZDfTF5g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd1e24e5f78d0e539d328742bf5353482bea8ef084d0ed1c261d1809bc5110c2d4df793f2801759d97fb7bc8711457afd6d98bcb99840f1334479286444212d171c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on tao-of-dao.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eG1ncxLbP3Y3-HnZLVFakeQikGvHerdPrtFGksNHE0o\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"GVywSyNC6ZGm3ypuiZjEsn4dBWVyNxBotd2rmRdcEQI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wJFMtwkxJKzJI4_hvpkBncBsVjadqqeCfnXId4HLaVI\"}"
