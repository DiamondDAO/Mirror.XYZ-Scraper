"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"Body of Bacchus!\\\" exclaimed the steward (using one of those old Pagan ejaculations which survive in Italy even to the present day), \\\"there stands the prettiest girl I have seen yet. If she would only be shepherdess number thirty, I should go home to supper with my mind at ease. I'll ask her, at any rate. Nothing can be lost by asking, and everything may be gained. Stop, my dear,\\\" he continued, seeing the girl turn to go into the house as he approached her. \\\"Don't be afraid of me. I am steward to the Marquis Melani, and well known in Pisa as an eminently respectable man. I have something to say to you which may be greatly for your benefit. Don't look surprised; I am coming to the point at once. Do you want to earn a little money? honestly, of course. You don't look as if you were very rich, child.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am very poor, and very much in want of some honest work to do,\\\" answered the girl, sadly.\\n\\n\\\"Then we shall suit each other to a nicety; for I have work of the pleasantest kind to give you, and plenty of money to pay for it. But before we say anything more about that, suppose you tell me first something about yourself--who you are, and so forth. You know who I am already.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am only a poor work-girl, and my name is Nanina. I have nothing more, sir, to say about myself than that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you belong to Pisa?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, sir--at least, I did. But I have been away for some time. I was a year at Florence, employed in needlework.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All by yourself?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, sir, with my little sister. I was waiting for her when you came up.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have you never done anything else but needlework? never been out at service?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, sir. For the last eight months I have had a situation to wait on a lady at Florence, and my sister (who is turned eleven, sir, and can make herself very useful) was allowed to help in the nursery.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How came you to leave this situation?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The lady and her family were going to Rome, sir. They would have taken me with them, but they could not take my sister. We are alone in the world, and we never have been parted from each other, and never shall be--so I was obliged to leave the situation.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And here you are, back at Pisa--with nothing to do, I suppose?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nothing yet, sir. We only came back yesterday.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Only yesterday! You are a lucky girl, let me tell you, to have met with me. I suppose you have somebody in the town who can speak to your character?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The landlady of this house can, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And who is she, pray?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marta Angrisani, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What! the well-known sick-nurse? You could not possibly have a better recommendation, child. I remember her being employed at the Melani Palace at the time of the marquis's last attack of gout; but I never knew that she kept a lodging-house.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She and her daughter, sir, have owned this house longer than I can recollect. My sister and I have lived in it since I was quite a little child, and I had hoped we might be able to live here again. But the top room we used to have is taken, and the room to let lower down is far more, I am afraid, than we can afford.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How much is it?\\\"\\n\\nNanina mentioned the weekly rent of the room in fear and trembling. The steward burst out laughing.\\n\\n\\\"Suppose I offered you money enough to be able to take that room for a whole year at once?\\\" he said.\\n\\nNanina looked at him in speechless amazement.  \\\"Suppose I offered you that?\\\" continued the steward. \\\"And suppose I only ask you in return to put on a fine dress and serve refreshments in a beautiful room to the company at the Marquis Melani's grand ball? What should you say to that?\\\"\\n\\nNanina said nothing. She drew back a step or two, and looked more bewildered than before.\\n\\n\\\"You must have heard of the ball,\\\" said the steward, pompously; \\\"the poorest people in Pisa have heard of it. It is the talk of the whole city.\\\"\\n\\nStill Nanina made no answer. To have replied truthfully, she must have confessed that \\\"the talk of the whole city\\\" had now no interest for her. The last news from Pisa that had appealed to her sympathies was the news of the Countess D'Ascoli's death, and of Fabio's departure to travel in foreign countries. Since then she had heard nothing more of him. She was as ignorant of his return to his native city as of all the reports connected with the marquis's ball. Something in her own heart--some feeling which she had neither the desire nor the capacity to analyze--had brought her back to Pisa and to the old home which now connected itself with her tenderest recollections. Believing that Fabio was still absent, she felt that no ill motive could now be attributed to her return; and she had not been able to resist the temptation of revisiting the scene that had been associated with the first great happiness as well as with the first great sorrow of her life. Among all the poor people of Pisa, she was perhaps the very last whose curiosity could be awakened, or whose attention could be attracted by the rumor of gayeties at the Melani Palace.\\n\\nBut she could not confess all this; she could only listen with great humility and no small surprise, while the steward, in compassion for her ignorance, and with the hope of tempting her into accepting his offered engagement, described the arrangements of the approaching festival, and dwelt fondly on the magnificence of the Arcadian bowers, and the beauty of the shepherdesses' tunics. As soon as he had done, Nanina ventured on the confession that she should feel rather nervous in a grand dress that did not belong to her, and that she doubted very much her own capability of waiting properly on the great people at the ball. The steward, however, would hear of no objections, and called peremptorily for Marta Angrisani to make the necessary statement as to Nanina's character. While this formality was being complied with to the steward's perfect satisfaction, La Biondella came in, unaccompanied on this occasion by the usual companion of all her walks, the learned poodle Scarammuccia.\\n\\n\\\"This is Nanina's sister,\\\" said the good-natured sick-nurse, taking the first opportunity of introducing La Biondella to the great marquis's great man. \\\"A very good, industrious little girl; and very clever at plaiting dinner-mats, in case his excellency should ever want any. What have you done with the dog, my dear?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I couldn't get him past the pork butcher's, three streets off,\\\" replied La Biondella. \\\"He would sit down and look at the sausages. I am more than half afraid he means to steal some of them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A very pretty child,\\\" said the steward, patting La Biondella on the cheek. \\\"We ought to have her at the hall. If his excellency should want a Cupid, or a youthful nymph, or anything small and light in that way, I shall come back and let you know. In the meantime, Nanina, consider yourself Shepherdess Number Thirty, and come to the housekeeper's room at the palace to try on your dress to-morrow. Nonsense! don't talk to me about being afraid and awkward. All you're wanted to do is to look pretty; and your glass must have told you you could do that long ago. Remember the rent of the room, my dear, and don't stand in your light and your sister's. Does the little girl like sweetmeats? Of course she does! Well, I promise you a whole box of sugar-plums to take home for her, if you will come and wait at the ball.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, go to the ball, Nanina; go to the ball!\\\" cried La Biondella, clapping her hands.\\n\\n\\\"Of course she will go to the ball,\\\" said the nurse. \\\"She would be mad to throw away such an excellent chance.\\\"\\n\\nNanina looked perplexed. She hesitated a little, then drew Marta Angrisani away into a corner, and whispered this question to her:\\n\\n\\\"Do you think there will be any priests at the palace where the marquis lives?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Heavens, child, what a thing to ask!\\\" returned the nurse. \\\"Priests at a masked ball! You might as well expect to find Turks performing high mass in the cathedral. But supposing you did meet with priests at the palace, what then?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nothing,\\\" said Nanina, constrainedly. She turned pale, and walked away as she spoke. Her great dread, in returning to Pisa, was the dread of meeting with Father Rocco again. She had never forgotten her first discovery at Florence of his distrust of her. The bare thought of seeing him any more, after her faith in him had been shaken forever, made her feel faint and sick at heart.\\n\\n\\\"To-morrow, in the housekeeper's room,\\\" said the steward, putting on his hat, \\\"you will find your new dress all ready for you.\\\"\\n\\nNanina courtesied, and ventured on no more objections. The prospect of securing a home for a whole year to come among people whom she knew, reconciled her--influenced as she was also by Marta Angrisani's advice, and by her sister's anxiety for the promised present--to brave the trial of appearing at the ball.\\n\\n\\\"What a comfort to have it all settled at last,\\\" said the steward, as soon as he was out again in the street. \\\"We shall see what the marquis says now. If he doesn't apologize for calling me a scoundrel the moment he sets eyes on Number Thirty, he is the most ungrateful nobleman that ever existed.\\\"\\n\\nArriving in front of the palace, the steward found workmen engaged in planning the external decorations and illuminations for the night of the ball. A little crowd had already assembled to see the ladders raised and the scaffoldings put up. He observed among them, standing near the outskirts of the throng, a lady who attracted his attention (he was an ardent admirer of the fair sex) by the beauty and symmetry of her figure. While he lingered for a moment to look at her, a shaggy poodle-dog (licking his chops, as if he had just had something to eat) trotted by, stopped suddenly close to the lady, sniffed suspiciously for an instant, and then began to growl at her without the slightest apparent provocation. The steward advancing politely with his stick to drive the dog away, saw the lady start, and heard her exclaim to herself amazedly:\\n\\n\\\"You here, you beast! Can Nanina have come back to Pisa?\\\"\\n\\nThis last exclamation gave the steward, as a gallant man, an excuse for speaking to the elegant stranger.\\n\\n\\\"Excuse me, madam,\\\" he said, \\\"but I heard you mention the name of Nanina. May I ask whether you mean a pretty little work-girl who lives near the Campo Santo?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The same,\\\" said the lady, looking very much surprised and interested immediately.\\n\\n\\\"It may be a gratification to you, madam, to know that she has just returned to Pisa,\\\" continued the steward, politely; \\\"and, moreover, that she is in a fair way to rise in the world. I have just engaged her to wait at the marquis's grand ball, and I need hardly say, under those circumstances, that if she plays her cards properly her fortune is made.\\\"\\n\\nThe lady bowed, looked at her informant very intently and thoughtfully for a moment, then suddenly walked away without uttering a word.\\n\\n\\\"A curious woman,\\\" thought the steward, entering the palace. \\\"I must ask Number Thirty about her to-morrow.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\nTHE death of Maddalena d'Ascoli produced a complete change in the lives of her father and her uncle. After the first shock of the bereavement was over, Luca Lomi declared that it would be impossible for him to work in his studio again--for some time to come at least--after the death of the beloved daughter, with whom every corner of it was now so sadly and closely associated. He accordingly accepted an engagement to assist in restoring several newly discovered works of ancient sculpture at Naples, and set forth for that  city, leaving the care of his work-rooms at Pisa entirely to his  brother.\\n\\nOn the master-sculptor's departure, Father Rocco caused the statues and busts to be carefully enveloped in linen cloths, locked the studio doors, and, to the astonishment of all who knew of his former industry and dexterity as a sculptor, never approached the place again. His clerical duties he performed with the same assiduity as ever; but he went out less than had been his custom hitherto to the houses of his friends. His most regular visits were to the Ascoli Palace, to inquire at the porter's lodge after the health of Maddalena's child, who was always reported to be thriving admirably under the care of the best nurses that could be found in Pisa. As for any communications with his polite little friend from Florence, they had ceased months ago. The information--speedily conveyed to him--that Nanina was in the service of one of the most respectable ladies in the city seemed to relieve any anxieties which he might otherwise have felt on her account. He made no attempt to justify himself to her; and only required that his over-courteous little visitor of former days should let him know whenever the girl might happen to leave her new situation.\\n\\nThe admirers of Father Rocco, seeing the alteration in his life, and the increased quietness of his manner, said that, as he was growing older, he was getting more and more above the things of this world. His enemies (for even Father Rocco had them) did not scruple to assert that the change in him was decidedly for the worse, and that he belonged to the order of men who are most to be distrusted when they become most subdued. The priest himself paid no attention either to his eulogists or his depreciators. Nothing disturbed the regularity and discipline of his daily habits; and vigilant Scandal, though she sought often to surprise him, sought always in vain.\\n\\nSuch was Father Rocco's life from the period of his niece's death to Fabio's return to Pisa.\\n\\nAs a matter of course, the priest was one of the first to call at the palace and welcome the young nobleman back. What passed between them at this interview never was precisely known; but it was surmised readily enough that some misunderstanding had taken place, for Father Rocco did not repeat his visit. He made no complaints of Fabio, but simply stated that he had said something, intended for the young man's good, which had not been received in a right spirit; and that he thought it desirable to avoid the painful chance of any further collision by not presenting himself at the palace again for some little time. People were rather amazed at this. They would have been still more surprised if the subject of the masked ball had not just then occupied all their attention, and prevented their noticing it, by another strange event in connection with the priest. Father Rocco, some weeks after the cessation of his intercourse with Fabio, returned one morning to his old way of life as a sculptor, and opened the long-closed doors of his brother's studio.\\n\\nLuca Lomi's former workmen, discovering this, applied to him immediately for employment; but were informed that their services would not be needed. Visitors called at the studio, but were always sent away again by the disappointing announcement that there was nothing new to show them. So the days passed on until Nanina left her situation and returned to Pisa. This circumstance was duly reported to Father Rocco by his correspondent at Florence; but, whether he was too much occupied among the statues, or whether it was one result of his cautious resolution never to expose himself unnecessarily to so much as the breath of detraction, he made no attempt to see Nanina, or even to justify himself toward her by writing her a letter. All his mornings continued to be spent alone in the studio, and all his afternoons to be occupied by his clerical duties, until the day before the masked ball at the Melani Palace.\\n\\nEarly on that day he covered over the statues, and locked the doors of the work-rooms once more; then returned to his own lodgings, and did not go out again. One or two of his friends who wanted to see him were informed that he was not well enough to be able to receive them. If they had penetrated into his little study, and had seen him, they would have been easily satisfied that this was no mere excuse. They would have noticed that his face was startlingly pale, and that the ordinary composure of his manner was singularly disturbed.\\n\\nToward evening this restlessness increased, and his old housekeeper, on pressing him to take some nourishment, was astonished to hear him answer her sharply and irritably, for the first time since she had been in his service. A little later her surprise was increased by his sending her with a note to the Ascoli Palace, and by the quick return of an answer, brought ceremoniously by one of Fabio's servants. \\\"It is long since he has had any communication with that quarter. Are they going to be friends again?\\\" thought the housekeeper as she took the answer upstairs to her master.\\n\\n\\\"I feel better to-night,\\\" he said as he read it; \\\"well enough indeed to venture out. If any one inquires for me, tell them that I am gone to the Ascoli Palace.\\\" Saying this, he walked to the door; then returned, and trying the lock of his cabinet, satisfied himself that it was properly secured; then went out.\\n\\nHe found Fabio in one of the large drawing-rooms of the palace, walking irritably backward and forward, with several little notes crumpled together in his hands, and a plain black domino dress for the masquerade of the ensuing night spread out on one of the tables.\\n\\n\\\"I was just going to write to you,\\\" said the young man, abruptly, \\\"when I received your letter. You offer me a renewal of our friendship, and I accept the offer. I have no doubt those references of yours, when we last met, to the subject of second marriages were well meant, but they irritated me; and, speaking under that irritation, I said words that I had better not have spoken. If I pained you, I am sorry for it. Wait! pardon me for one moment. I have not quite done yet. It seems that you are by no means the only person in Pisa to whom the question of my possibly marrying again appears to have presented itself. Ever since it was known that I intended to renew my intercourse with society at the ball to-morrow night, I have been persecuted by anonymous letters--infamous letters, written from some motive which it is impossible for me to understand. I want your advice on the best means of discovering the writers; and I have also a very important question to ask you. But read one of the letters first yourself; any one will do as a sample of the rest.\\\"\\n\\nFixing his eyes searchingly on the priest, he handed him one of the notes. Still a little paler than usual, Father Rocco sat down by the nearest lamp, and shading his eyes, read these lines:\\n\\n\\\"COUNT FABIO---It is the common talk of Pisa that you are likely, as a young man left with a motherless child, to marry again. Your having accepted an invitation to the Melani Palace gives a color of truth to this report. Widowers who are true to the departed do not go among all the handsomest single women in a city at a masked ball. Reconsider your determination, and remain at home. I know you, and I knew your wife, and I say to you solemnly, avoid temptation, for you must never marry again. Neglect my advice and you will repent it to the end of your life. I have reasons for what I say--serious, fatal reasons, which I cannot divulge. If you would let your wife lie easy in her grave, if you would avoid a terrible warning, go not to the masked ball!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I ask you, and I ask any man, if that is not infamous?\\\" exclaimed Fabio, passionately, as the priest handed him back the letter. \\\"An attempt to work on my fears through the memory of my poor dead wife! An insolent assumption that I want to marry again, when I myself have not even so much as thought of the subject at all! What is the secret object of this letter, and of the rest here that resemble it? Whose interest is it to keep me away from the ball? What is the meaning of such a phrase as, 'If you would let your wife lie easy in her grave'? H ave you no advice to give me--no plan to propose for discovering the vile hand that traced these lines? Speak to me! Why, in Heaven's name, don't you speak?\\\"\\n\\nThe priest leaned his head on his hand, and, turning his face from the light as if it dazzled his eyes, replied in his lowest and quietest tones:\\n\\n\\\"I cannot speak till I have had time to think. The mystery of that letter is not to be solved in a moment. There are things in it that are enough to perplex and amaze any man!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What things?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is impossible for me to go into details--at least at the present moment.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You speak with a strange air of secrecy. Have you nothing definite to say--no advice to give me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should advise you not to go to the ball.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You would! Why?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If I gave you my reasons, I am afraid I should only be irritating you to no purpose.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Father Rocco, neither your words nor your manner satisfy me. You speak in riddles; and you sit there in the dark with your face hidden from me--\\\"\\n\\nThe priest instantly started up and turned his face to the light.\\n\\n\\\"I recommend you to control your temper, and to treat me with common courtesy,\\\" he said, in his quietest, firmest tones, looking at Fabio steadily while he spoke.\\n\\n\\\"We will not prolong this interview,\\\" said the young man, calming himself by an evident effort. \\\"I have one question to ask you, and then no more to say.\\\"\\n\\nThe priest bowed his head, in token that he was ready to listen. He still stood up, calm, pale, and firm, in the full light of the lamp.\\n\\n\\\"It is just possible,\\\" continued Fabio, \\\"that these letters may refer to some incautious words which my late wife might have spoken. I ask you as her spiritual director, and as a near relation who enjoyed her confidence, if you ever heard her express a wish, in the event of my surviving her, that I should abstain from marrying again?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did she never express such a wish to you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Never. But why do you evade my question by asking me another?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is impossible for me to reply to your question.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For what reason?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because it is impossible for me to give answers which must refer, whether they are affirmative or negative, to what I have heard in confession.\\\"\\n\\n[ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/54](ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/54)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639207559,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"I am very poor, and very much in want of some honest work to do,\\\" answered the girl, sadly.\"},\"digest\":\"zpmiU5khRPF8LoneFpOdNxgxt_HebLeIPms0fvUzut4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x78E122EE80026e3069E79387D188d772001055Aa\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Qd-tW4GZ2NebbkCDPTzfFVhoAU1yixv5J5C5Ofu065g\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"HOdH3Pmvf6xr3OSIl64A24DnlUExRlR3Pp6Sz2nEF8c\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"iako0zM-iflwYz3f_ix-ApyhfKukhmvqA8b8hPqmL2sGuQajuI-3tgZZhgafro6YYwGOVT-nOsb4FFFsGtXvDQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd3ddc50368a644b2ba06923c453d4c875ffd681e8c2dbd5c3ef9bc56aae0c51f128d5b75a9cc94cfe0cd080c42e095c79b9c7ed326976432a749b3d88297e9a21c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Qd-tW4GZ2NebbkCDPTzfFVhoAU1yixv5J5C5Ofu065g\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"HOdH3Pmvf6xr3OSIl64A24DnlUExRlR3Pp6Sz2nEF8c\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"zpmiU5khRPF8LoneFpOdNxgxt_HebLeIPms0fvUzut4\"}"
