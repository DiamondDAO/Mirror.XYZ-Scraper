"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"# NFT, a socialization property\\n\\nEver since the birth of Bitcoin, the variety of different types of applications in blockchain has clear the vision of development in web3 thanks to all original users and participants. They have been putting their efforts into discovering the potential forms of the new internet system.\\n\\nThe nature of the internet is the connection. Hence, the fundamental logic behind its evolution is the progression of connection. Early blockchain applications, including Defi, actually shared very few active players. NFT has brought the public attention to blockchain and the actual reason is **its element of connection**. It is noticeable that NFT is a type of property that shares significant social and collection elements, which the value is visible only by the transaction between people.\\n\\n# What caused the “weak ties” between on-chain information\\n\\nThe current ecology of the Blockchain internet is still ill-informed. Its elements of connecting are still at a relatively weak stage which does not fit the nature of decentralization of blockchain. The reason behind this can be complicated.\\n\\n* One of the typical reasons is due to **the quickness of refreshment** of blockchain pieces of information, such as how one hot spot has been replaced by another without being noticed in the first place. Too many sources of informations are also causing users to follow multiple media, such as websites, Twitter, telegram, discord while even following various channels within those platforms.\\n* Another reason is that **experienced players tend not to voluntarily share information**, therefore the information is not circulating ideally and would cause slow responding.\\n\\nThus, we would hope to have a product that could **polymerize information**, allowing users to self-follow experienced players and their connections so that they can follow those information streams. The product shall also allow users to share their moments without visiting multiple platforms, or have the one-click function for visiting all channels, simply by following the wallet address to access all trends of one web3 participant.\\n\\n# As filter and bridge of information\\n\\nWeb3 network is the connection of service, contents, relationships, and values. Application platforms will provide service and creators can produce content. Platform and creators together will produce massive contents which are beyond human’s limited focus. Therefore, relationship networks are how users to filter information, meanwhile, it is also the propagation. Minimum frictions between value networks and other forms of networks are the most distinguishing feature of web 3, which gains the most attention among web 3 participants.\\n\\nWe built our product system based on such theory of web 3 due to our desire to consummate the connection between the network of service, contents, relationships, and values to accelerate the information streams in Web 3.\\n\\n# Loop: your web3 data stream\\n\\nLoop is a content aggregator for **tracking the latest events in the open web**, including NFTs, Mirrors articles, or POAP badges.\\n\\nIt allows users to **personalize their activity feed** and filter out spam via community discovery. Like Twitter, Loop can automatically integrate on-chain and off-chain dynamics of multiple wallets into a real-time information stream and present it in user personal spaces. With LOOP, users can follow other people’s wallet addresses, in which case, they can track their friends, KOLs, whales, and watch their on-chain and off-chain dynamics, and even the NFT transactions of CryptoPunks holders; at the same time, users can also view many high-quality articles on Mirror.\\n\\n# NFT, media for information-based socialization\\n\\nLoop is a big attempt on the NFT social network of information streams. As a user, you can put your friends, KOLs, or articles on Mirror as nodes of your relationship networks to access NFT content that is possibly beneficial for you.\\n\\nYou can also put your followed NFT collections into **Dataverse — — a personal space that allows you to host your NFT collection**. You can perform more content management operations in your space. We will integrate a variety of gadgets to facilitate exploration and social interaction in it as well. You can also collect NFTs from other platforms because we have provided our SDK to those platforms, therefore your collections can still appear in Dataverse space.\\n\\n# Dataverse: Your Private Data Space\\n\\nDataverse is developed by Ownership Labs, which is the user-centered private space for sorting and displaying your interests in one place. Users can download the chrome extension and save NFTs from several NFT websites with one click, including Opensea, Rarible, Superare, Foundation, Zora, Async Art, Nifty Gateway, and more.\\n\\n**DID: Decentralized ID**\\n\\nAll data are bonded with your DID, same as your Loop account, which binds with your wallet. Therefore you can follow other users by wallet address or DID, or share your DID to show off your NFT collections and attract followers.\\n\\nDataverse is also your DIGITAL mind. Easily track NFTs in your private space for better decision-makings. Unleash your creativity and connect with like-minded people.\\n\\n**Loop** is still at the developing and testing stage, while Dataverse is updating its UI. You can already use our newest version of extension and it is highly welcome to follow our social accounts to track our progress.\\n\\nAlso welcome to follow or join our **NFT treasure hunter event**, which is co-hosted by us and Galaxy. We have the faith that our product can do great deal to the development and popularisation of web 3.\\n\\n# Join Ownership Labs Community\\n\\n[Website](https://dataverse.art/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OwnershipLabs) | [Telegram](https://t.me/OwnershipLabs) | [Discord](http://discord.gg/s3K5ds8FY2) | [GitHub](https://github.com/ownership-labs) | [Ownershiplabs](https://ownershiplabs.com/) | [Medium](https://medium.com/@OwnershipLabs)\",\"timestamp\":1639143111,\"title\":\"Dataverse with Loop: Expand your field of vision on Web 3\"},\"digest\":\"f1xdj-rsuv0-UjOIiG0WtxEmP0-T87uegVhocqE_ce4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"56iAqu8jdfFOw9_BTstYzD3Q47SOm1dE7EAu3abv2vQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dbUlNSJFZYsxachkZAmgf_s2RvuUQdzXuljhpc49M90\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"p0wAPlrC-atGfV4UmVIhKV-qjvyb-jxxxov5E87iKX_9e2ES62n4XKXqVJtrboXtnL43fJMS_Le8c1zsIy_Esw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1b380bf25b9e56d338e808058b8b30a259b3a81d0089f928e918922ea625d7231d9fbaaf675e2a18c5695b9fcc53b1662b11e010ab9a568236731e7fa94802621c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"56iAqu8jdfFOw9_BTstYzD3Q47SOm1dE7EAu3abv2vQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dbUlNSJFZYsxachkZAmgf_s2RvuUQdzXuljhpc49M90\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"f1xdj-rsuv0-UjOIiG0WtxEmP0-T87uegVhocqE_ce4\"}"
