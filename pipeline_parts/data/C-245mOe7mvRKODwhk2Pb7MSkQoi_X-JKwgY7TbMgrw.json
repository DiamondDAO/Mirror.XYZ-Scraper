"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The crypto market once again ushered in a wave of slump.\\n\\nIn the midday of December 4, market data showed that the price of Bitcoin fell below US$42,000 for a short period of time, with a 24-hour drop of more than 20%, reaching a minimum of US$41967. Ethereum fell below US$3,500, a 24-hour drop of more than 21%. In the past 1 hour, the contract market has liquidated a total of US$1.13 billion on the entire network and a 24-hour liquidation of US$2.23 billion.\\n\\nAfter entering December, the cryptocurrency market continued to fall.\\n\\nOn December 1, the highest price of Bitcoin hit $59,000, which is close to a high of $60,000. But since then, the waterfall quotation has been opened.\\n\\nOn December 3, Bitcoin fell by more than 12% during the day, with a drop of more than $5,000, reaching a minimum of $51,600, and it began to drop to the $50,000 mark.\\n\\nOn December 4, Bitcoin did not stop its downward trend. After falling below the $50,000 mark in one fell swoop, it was inserted shortly to near $42,000. The intraday drop exceeded $10,000, the lowest price since September 30.\\n\\nPrior to this, the price of Bitcoin hit a record high in November, breaking through to US$69,000, and the overall market value of cryptocurrencies climbed to around US$3 trillion. However, after failing to break through the $70,000 mark, Bitcoin's price trend was obviously weak.\\n\\nEthereum, the world's second largest cryptocurrency, fell closely with Bitcoin. The current offer has fallen by nearly 20% from the historical high of $4,898, but the magnitude of the shock is smaller than that of Bitcoin.\\n\\nRegarding this decline, the recent trend of the cryptocurrency market is in line with global stock markets.\\n\\nOn the morning of December 4, European and American stock markets closed down across the board.

At the same time, international gold prices rose by about 1%.\\n\\nIt is worth noting that recently, Huobi, the cryptocurrency trading platform that previously announced the withdrawal of mainland China, began to issue an internal letter to remind mainland Chinese users to clear their account assets, and it is clear that the deposit function of mainland Chinese users will be closed on December 14. On December 15th, the currency transaction function of mainland Chinese users will be banned, and on December 31st, OTC transactions will be removed.\\n\\n## \",\"timestamp\":1638763444,\"title\":\"Bitcoin price plunged, plummeting nearly $10,000 in one hour\"},\"digest\":\"4_3DLf5DwMve46kE-2cqVq1_ukr5FaGftjf9ZcPwiLM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x1344318caCD28d2AfD3F94c6CC8A1EEA456da962\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"T_rxxaC9neOed_QUm5cAbTlujlVHJJHFMz29uR-K66k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"OBW5iIDoZLEFVGbRXMNIIHok_Nhgt0HdRt_I-XZKx5U\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"dofnFhSSOEE_mjKF99TlMLWSkOpMFRppB6fOtPsGJkBflxbAjFo5jp_Axbn-h4FxkT8oJVmtzbh1YtuCLZr83g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x05e2057a4b37129cfb243fb7c3c61c04a5f16636242b18b8aa9cc8299205107217d729fbedac52ba4e1334e621e91cad6d2a7e4c89de64acea3fdcfd04855bd31b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"T_rxxaC9neOed_QUm5cAbTlujlVHJJHFMz29uR-K66k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"OBW5iIDoZLEFVGbRXMNIIHok_Nhgt0HdRt_I-XZKx5U\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"4_3DLf5DwMve46kE-2cqVq1_ukr5FaGftjf9ZcPwiLM\"}"
