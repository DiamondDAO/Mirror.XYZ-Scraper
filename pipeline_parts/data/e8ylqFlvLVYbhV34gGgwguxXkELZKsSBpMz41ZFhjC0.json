"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The young Don Juan might give princely banquets, the palace might echo with clamorous mirth, horses pawed the ground in the courtyards, pages quarreled and flung dice upon the stairs, but Bartolommeo ate his seven ounces of bread daily and drank water. A fowl was occasionally dressed for him, simply that the black poodle, his faithful companion, might have the bones. Bartolommeo never complained of the noise. If the huntsmen's horns and baying dogs disturbed his sleep during his illness, he only said, \\\"Ah! Don Juan has come back again.\\\" Never on earth has there been a father so little exacting and so indulgent; and, in consequence, young Belvidero, accustomed to treat his father unceremoniously, had all the faults of a spoiled child. He treated old Bartolommeo as a wilful courtesan treats an elderly adorer; buying indemnity for insolence with a smile, selling good-humor, submitting to be loved.\\n\\nDon Juan, beholding scene after scene of his younger years, saw that it would be a difficult task to find his father's indulgence at fault. Some new-born remorse stirred the depths of his heart; he felt almost ready to forgive this father now about to die for having lived so long. He had an accession of filial piety, like a thief's return in thought to honesty at the prospect of a million adroitly stolen.\\n\\nBefore long Don Juan had crossed the lofty, chilly suite of rooms in which his father lived; the penetrating influences of the damp close air, the mustiness diffused by old tapestries and presses thickly covered with dust had passed into him, and now he stood in the old man's antiquated room, in the repulsive presence of the deathbed, beside a dying fire. A flickering lamp on a Gothic table sent broad uncertain shafts of light, fainter or brighter, across the bed, so that the dying man's face seemed to wear a different look at every moment. The bitter wind whistled through the crannies of the ill-fitting casements; there was a smothered sound of snow lashing the windows. The harsh contrast of these sights and sounds with the scenes which Don Juan had just quitted was so sudden that he could not help shuddering. He turned cold as he came towards the bed; the lamp flared in a sudden vehement gust of wind and lighted up his father's face; the features were wasted and distorted; the skin that cleaved to their bony outlines had taken wan livid hues, all the more ghastly by force of contrast with the white pillows on which he lay. The muscles about the toothless mouth had contracted with pain and drawn apart the lips; the moans that issued between them with appalling energy found an accompaniment in the howling of the storm without.\\n\\nIn spite of every sign of coming dissolution, the most striking thing about the dying face was its incredible power. It was no ordinary spirit that wrestled there with Death. The eyes glared with strange fixity of gaze from the cavernous sockets hollowed by disease. It seemed as if Bartolommeo sought to kill some enemy sitting at the foot of his bed by the intent gaze of dying eyes. That steady remorseless look was the more appalling because the head that lay upon the pillow was passive and motionless as a skull upon a doctor's table. The outlines of the body, revealed by the coverlet, were no less rigid and stiff; he lay there as one dead, save for those eyes. There was something automatic about the moaning sounds that came from the mouth. Don Juan felt something like shame that he must be brought thus to his father's bedside, wearing a courtesan's bouquet, redolent of the fragrance of the banqueting-chamber and the fumes of wine.\\n\\n\\\"You were enjoying yourself!\\\" the old man cried as he saw his son.\\n\\nEven as he spoke the pure high notes of a woman's voice, sustained by the sound of the viol on which she accompanied her song, rose above the rattle of the storm against the casements, and floated up to the chamber of death. Don Juan stopped his ears against the barbarous answer to his father's speech.\\n\\n\\\"I bear you no grudge, my child,\\\" Bartolommeo went on.\\n\\nThe words were full of kindness, but they hurt Don Juan; he could not pardon this heart-searching goodness on his father's part.\\n\\n\\\"What a remorseful memory for me!\\\" he cried, hypocritically.\\n\\n\\\"Poor Juanino,\\\" the dying man went on, in a smothered voice, \\\"I have always been so kind to you, that you could not surely desire my death?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, if it were only possible to keep you here by giving up a part of my own life!\\\" cried Don Juan.\\n\\n(\\\"We can always SAY this sort of thing,\\\" the spendthrift thought; \\\"it is as if I laid the whole world at my mistress' feet.\\\")\\n\\nThe thought had scarcely crossed his mind when the old poodle barked. Don Juan shivered; the response was so intelligent that he fancied the dog must have understood him.\\n\\n\\\"I was sure that I could count upon you, my son!\\\" cried the dying man. \\\"I shall live. So be it; you shall be satisfied. I shall live, but without depriving you of a single day of your life.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is raving,\\\" thought Don Juan. Aloud he added, \\\"Yes, dearest father, yes; you shall live, of course, as long as I live, for your image will be for ever in my heart.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is not that kind of life that I mean,\\\" said the old noble, summoning all his strength to sit up in bed; for a thrill of doubt ran through him, one of those suspicions that come into being under a dying man's pillow. \\\"Listen, my son,\\\" he went on, in a voice grown weak with that last effort, \\\"I have no more wish to give up life than you to give up wine and mistresses, horses and hounds, and hawks and gold----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can well believe it,\\\" thought the son; and he knelt down by the bed and kissed Bartolommeo's cold hands. \\\"But, father, my dear father,\\\" he added aloud, \\\"we must submit to the will of God.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am God!\\\" muttered the dying man.\\n\\n\\\"Do not blaspheme!\\\" cried the other, as he saw the menacing expression on his father's face. \\\"Beware what you say; you have received extreme unction, and I should be inconsolable if you were to die before my eyes in mortal sin.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Will you listen to me?\\\" cried Bartolommeo, and his mouth twitched.\\n\\nDon Juan held his peace; an ugly silence prevailed. Yet above the muffled sound of the beating of the snow against the windows rose the sounds of the beautiful voice and the viol in unison, far off and faint as the dawn. The dying man smiled.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you,\\\" he said, \\\"for bringing those singing voices and the music, a banquet, young and lovely women with fair faces and dark tresses, all the pleasure of life! Bid them wait for me; for I am about to begin life anew.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1636531912,\"title\":\"The young Don Juan might give princely banquets\"},\"digest\":\"CliMJFHpuIMsJbdVLBxTbB_YdlfXS0qSRCa4rsz8WJQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x50DFA4f326C8D0666AE39431f220915FC37dECA8\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"egbkGVb1_2tUNZs2aPUrFOMJb-pEoETFXOdmrbS8mAY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ti2cU75nie_1DHaDfozVmIf7RXLSRd5IiwXZ8F-HG1E\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"GjM06Hhazy7KbvlXUjwkQddnZhMeT07ccddto1YKg_KDJo7GelYAEeFesgS8f7hDxAyM9y_DJ19hND8DfIEP9w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa9491d876d56618b3c46cbacd6c4d438e6c2a4aa4ea1f75e631623aa12faffb5116107e86030fe95a028ed9f8c9813d79ece563539e3f09b46ee1e95715ba3ba1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"egbkGVb1_2tUNZs2aPUrFOMJb-pEoETFXOdmrbS8mAY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ti2cU75nie_1DHaDfozVmIf7RXLSRd5IiwXZ8F-HG1E\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"CliMJFHpuIMsJbdVLBxTbB_YdlfXS0qSRCa4rsz8WJQ\"}"
