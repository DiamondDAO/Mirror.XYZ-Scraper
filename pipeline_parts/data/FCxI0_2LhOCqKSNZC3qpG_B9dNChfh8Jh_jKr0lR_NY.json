I’m incredibly excited to announce the launch of Binopoly after countless hours committed to this project in making it a reality. However, this would’ve been impossible if not for the insurmountable effort of the other three co-founders of this project and the project development team in pushing this idea forward at all costs.\\n\\n**Conceptualization of Binopoly:**\\n\\nDuring 2020, Decentralized Finance has exploded in popularity and pushed the crypto industry into a booming bullish trend, and I had dived headfirst into the many yield farming projects running at the time. Having gained abundant experience and seeing the vast varieties of project ideas in the industry, I developed a deep conviction that blockchain technology had immense potential to be fused with the real world, as for a project and technology to be widely recognized and accepted, it must be practical in creating actual real-life value.\\n\\nThen a sudden epiphany struck me: what if I combined DeFi to a game that presented practical value and could be integrated into the real world? Wouldn’t it be a brilliant new addition to the gaming as well as crypto industry? To actualize this idea, I had to find a game compatible with theories of DeFi and could utilize the myriad of tools and freedom cryptocurrency provided.\\n\\nThe game which I had in mind, a game that is so popular, widely known, and influential in enlightening people to the world of economics, was Monopoly. Using the basic concept of Monopoly and fusing it with Defi would allow people uninformed of Defi or crypto to learn about blockchain and its industries through a familiar game many would’ve played. After sharing this idea to the other co-founders, we all agreed that this would be an idea worth trying.\\n\\nHowever, we soon found our way blocked by the fact that current blockchain technology and regulations on Defi cannot accommodate complete amalgamation of blockchain and real-life, physical industries. The integration of blockchain into the real world was perhaps, simply too ahead of our time. Yet we persisted, believing in this was the right direction to create a truly meaningful change for the industry; so, we had to renavigate. Our persistence was also quickly validated as leading Defi giants Aave, Comp, Uni begun offering products for institutional investors as the crypto industry evolved rapidly.\\n\\n**The Creation Process:**\\n\\nAfter multiple meetings and discussions with the team and seasoned industry professions Invested in further developing this game idea, we decided to forgo this concept of ‘complete amalgamation’. Rather, we started dedicating purely to the combination of the models of Defi and Monopoly, to developing what we call a \\\\[play-to-earn\\\\] model today. This was more achievable as the rise of NFT technologies allowed for more opportunities to integrate new elements to the game model.\\n\\nGaming is already a colossal matured giga-industry, yet blockchain games are still in the infancy stage since the early Cryptokitties compared to AAA titles currently out there today. With the innumerable number of potential consumers effectively means limitless growth potential if a ground-breaking blockchain game could break all stereotypes that blockchain projects are purely financial products and outside of public reach, drawing these players into a new world. A blockchain game such as this will also be extremely effective in circumventing the volatile bullish or bearish trends of the industry, as well as continually grow and improve as long as its model is beloved by consumers.\\n\\nSince the pandemic in early 2020, various nations had imposed expansionary policies which boosted the crypto market massively, forming the bullish trend today. As though it was the natural next step, the concept of ‘metaverse’ had also slowly crept into the blockchain world and gained traction near the end of 2020, although just like DeFi in 2018, metaverse had existed long before, but was uncovered by COVID-19, the same as DeFi and stocks had.\\n\\nDuring this time, the metaverse concept was ignited and acknowledged by the broader public following changes to our way of life from technological progression. However, I was not as well-informed about metaverse as I was with Defi. However, after continual study on the concepts of the metaverse, I realized that Binopoly’s gameplay mode and concepts was much the same.\\n\\nAs the metaverse gains increasing attention and heat, projects such as Axie entered a booming growth phase after April 2021. Whether it’s the number of daily players online or the insane number of daily trades, Axie had pushed the \\\\[play-to-earn\\\\] concept into public attention and gained a massive following outside the crypto community. Everything that occurred had only made my team and I gain deeper understanding into the metaverse and GameFi, leading to the finalization of the economic model of Binopoly after 1 year of development in which the model was changed and built upon repeatedly for 6 times.\\n\\n**Moving Forward:**\\n\\nAs for the gameplay of Binopoly, the game combines traits of traditional games such as Sims and Monopoly so players may find it easier to begin engaging with the game, whilst also closely interweaved with Defi; allowing Defi’s financial power to be expressed in Binopoly’s world perfectly, for the benefit of the players. Our development team has, and will continue to, work tirelessly to actualize our vision for Binopoly: Make money from playing; make money while creating, to integrate Binopoly with reality and utilize blockchain technology so all players and real-world creators may benefit together. Another key point to address is that we had always envisioned ourselves as ‘founders’ rather than ‘owners’ of Binopoly, thus our team will hold the same ideologies which blockchain was built upon– to create and to share. We have conviction at that some point in the future, Binopoly will be handed over to the community completely, to the countless brilliant minds with equally brilliant ideas. Only when control and ownership belong to everybody can Binopoly reach its true potential as a game dedicated for the enrichment of all its players, and I have unwavering proof the day in the very near future.\",\"timestamp\":1640313413,\"title\":\"Birth of Binopoly - Binopoly - Medium\"},\"digest\":\"9p9n-N1pKv9sWtHhAfbUUYjuxE_lLJE1xZVzQYhZYfs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x840203c66185C5395b70f426a64a9bFA40A5f494\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"D9tXOgShOTTEv9lgUS6rLG1uTD1BlwpkORf3HvyJV14\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JRcU1JvymdzPoPCSvE1m-MX4RkapOvHL_DqAsjdESaI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"vIY5qdEi5Gk1t81iKqjYcZPzsN8Dy4Lo08EEM5QjoPcRXRhRHMR_7Gd1XKoqVZmJfZuQaZNrUyomTCP0j_l9eg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x830118e8ff559370beac893674a8bd9c8a4af53b1ca20d596aae36650762109b541c62703b1e7a6a8fcb745bb0127355d6eb35edb8c792d75bebc4cdd19aa8711b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"D9tXOgShOTTEv9lgUS6rLG1uTD1BlwpkORf3HvyJV14\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JRcU1JvymdzPoPCSvE1m-MX4RkapOvHL_DqAsjdESaI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"9p9n-N1pKv9sWtHhAfbUUYjuxE_lLJE1xZVzQYhZYfs\"}"
