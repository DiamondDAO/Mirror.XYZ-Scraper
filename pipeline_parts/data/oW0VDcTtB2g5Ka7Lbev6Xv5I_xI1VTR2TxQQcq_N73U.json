"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### This post will go over the audio & visual story that I want to create  called ‘Asteria’, referenced in my last blog post. In this world, there are two factions called the GAIA  Faction and the HELIOS  Faction. \\n\\n## FACTIONS \\n\\nThe HELIOS Faction is the higher society that I am born into. This faction controls the world below, where everything operates in a *perfect* systematic way. The faction is built off of status and ideas, ruled by a perceived heavenly empire founded on the incarcerated minds of the lower faction GAIA.\\n\\n![Photo from Black Panther](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xPKAslO5z31ZphSUBJHCw.jpeg?height=1266&width=2400)\\n\\nIn GAIA, gender & race attributes more value to one individual over another, as does money and fiscal things. Here, individuals follow traditional standards of living. They believe in Monetary value and the harder you work the more value you have. They think more brute than smart, and judge off of physical features, rather than intellectual or mindful attributes. \\n\\nGAIA is heavily influenced by religion as well and always give the first fruits to the gods above in the HELIOS faction. However, in HELIOS spirituality is the basis on their ways - as opposed to fixed religion. \\n\\n![Photo taken from Altered Carbon](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HfKnR0uTALS3MVpK5Va8C.jpeg?height=627&width=1200)\\n\\nBoth factions in *Asteria* are technologically advanced and live harmoniously according to their ways of life. That is, until something sparks and interruption between the two opposing world. \\n\\n## INSPIRATIONS \\n\\nInspired by Studio Ghibli anime, made by ‘Castle in The Sky’, my team & I decided to combine elements of the natural world with a cyberpunk aesthetic for the *Asteria* world. The visuals are also inspired from the sets of *Wakanda* and *Foundation*. Having also watched *Altered Carbon* and becoming a really big fan of cyber punk cities, we decided to create the world of *Asteria* based on these different cities. \\n\\n![Photo from Studio Ghibli 'Castle in the Sky'](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xM8dnUtd_xZvCq6U3ar0L.jpeg?height=778&width=1400)\\n\\n## PURPOSE\\n\\nThe intention behind this post is to give an inside look into my future projects, visually setting the tone for what my fans can expect from me next. I think it will be very interesting to create undeniable music, while also using it as a score for the story that I want to tell. I love doing things that haven’t been done before, as you can tell with the unconventional funding round that I’m doing on [mirror.xyz](http://mirror.xyz/). Hope this builds interest for participating in my upcoming NFT drop on November  29th and also give context to the NFTs that will be up for grabs very soon.  \\n\\n![Photo Taken From Studio Ghibli 'Castle in The Sky'](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q6m7YriRQyzxFXmvtPwrj.png?height=1038&width=1920)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637646667,\"title\":\"What is Asteria\"},\"digest\":\"MUTPsWoB1sJZ7qlg5Yt9S9pq_gl5VkTnVpPScgHw_q0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x219796e59444B42C72eFFc91904a9CE2C20eEc2a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"n8ydvJqz5LMIFCT3UYrsznoTsPaL4m47Q64zuHBTets\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TmIzpTuMPX8xxvDmnow8kCPYdu6c9ouqrHtBo-oq8mA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"XsS-6pQX0UaDJbcaNLNRdspimdtyh9VUdoSgWG7Ly8MXYFRaZsNqcBiPyZ75kLOHcFyK-5Zjn-Pb_F9QA0FYMw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x551079fa8f135230719ececa0fc56bb07dc496c1283f11bc21bd4df3e62dec8050849179b20803e09d73a1898a8efc085f2b715c2f2d1b7d5e4df73d95287cd81c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"n8ydvJqz5LMIFCT3UYrsznoTsPaL4m47Q64zuHBTets\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TmIzpTuMPX8xxvDmnow8kCPYdu6c9ouqrHtBo-oq8mA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"MUTPsWoB1sJZ7qlg5Yt9S9pq_gl5VkTnVpPScgHw_q0\"}"
