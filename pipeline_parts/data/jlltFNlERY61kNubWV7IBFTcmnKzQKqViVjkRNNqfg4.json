"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The US has plans for its first infrastructure projects in January as part of a Group of Seven (G7) initiative touted to counter the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), media reported Monday, in a feeble attempt to seek validation for Washington's existence post-COVID-19. \\n  \\n The US-led G7 initiative known as the Build Back Better World (B3W), essentially a political stunt to challenge the eight-year-old BRI framework and a sly trick played by the Biden administration to build momentum for the passage of the US domestic infrastructure spending package, is financially not feasible, experts said.  \\n  \\n They cast doubts over the viability of the colossal spending required to materialize the ulterior motives-powered B3W initiative, particularly when compared with the open and inclusive BRI. \\n  \\n The US eyes investments in five to 10 large infrastructure projects worldwide in January, Reuters reported on Monday, citing an anonymous senior US official.   \\n  \\n At least 10 promising projects in Senegal and Ghana were identified during a tour last week by a US delegation led by Daleep Singh, Biden's deputy national security adviser, according to the report. \\n  \\n During a similar tour in early October, a US delegation visited Ecuador, Panama and Colombia, the official said, disclosing that another Asia tour is slated before the end of the year. \\n  \\n The infrastructure projects suggested by the US delegation actually have almost nothing to do with real \\\"infrastructure,\\\" a Senegal government source told the Global Times via email on Tuesday. \\n  \\n It remains unknown what amount will be needed for the initial projects under the B3W initiative.  \\n  \\n Launched in June as a broader G7 program, the B3W initiative aims to narrow the $40-plus trillion worth of infrastructure needed in the developing world by 2035.\",\"timestamp\":1636556567,\"title\":\"US’ B3W infrastructure projects financially unfeasible, bound to fail: experts\"},\"digest\":\"5xed4hLTmDbJvZfecBObfPkojpvbsHQQT-4VoJ84vAU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xCa109da58F42703Ba78CcD0781846463Dc5785E7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LYs5BnoddXjlrpeY05MZaE1ZFmRo8Do_DTC76RPNP5w\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"VF8hR5ye_WAAtDjcdjsf7mVg6NS9LUM9c_gckNAONH4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"BaSBg_4qxypq9SIYYtzKwyqtXmU2tUiwOV-J-Imnq-dfxkoYoDqZ9FNC8qLpQhBtMB9TyryxJIO7ZfFe0ajlbA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5b42919b74a4186c8da155d4683c9efacf3e0fe0965ae74a5814e1836b870d115e823abb92d98de7068b6660973168d5d75c2ea329e09553297fdbaf6c9853851b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LYs5BnoddXjlrpeY05MZaE1ZFmRo8Do_DTC76RPNP5w\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"VF8hR5ye_WAAtDjcdjsf7mVg6NS9LUM9c_gckNAONH4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"5xed4hLTmDbJvZfecBObfPkojpvbsHQQT-4VoJ84vAU\"}"
