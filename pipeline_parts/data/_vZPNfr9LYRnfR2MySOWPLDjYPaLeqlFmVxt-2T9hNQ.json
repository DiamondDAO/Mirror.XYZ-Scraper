"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"said Colonel Zane. \\\"I am certain of that. Nevertheless that does not detract from the courage of his deed. He had no time to pick out the best place to jump. He simply took his one chance, and came out all right. That leap will live in the minds of men as long as yonder bluff stands a monument to McColloch's ride for life.\\\"\\n\\nAlfred had listened with intense interest to the Colonel's recital. When it ended, although his pulses quickened and his soul expanded with awe and reverence for the hero of that ride, he sat silent. Alfred honored courage in a man more than any other quality. He marvelled at the simplicity of these bordermen who, he thought, took the most wonderful adventures and daring escapes as a matter of course, a compulsory part of their daily lives. He had already, in one day, had more excitement than had ever befallen him, an. was beginning to believe his thirst for a free life of stirring action would be quenched long before he had learned to become useful in his new sphere. During the remaining half hour of his call on his lately acquired friends, he took little part in the conversation, but sat quietly watching the changeful expressions on Betty's face, and listening to Colonel Zane's jokes. When he rose to go he bade his host good-night, and expressed a wish that Isaac, who had fallen asleep, might have a speedy recovery. He turned toward the door to find that Betty had intercepted him.\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Clarke,\\\" she said, extending a little hand that trembled slightly. \\\"I wish to say--that--I want to say that my feelings have changed. I am sorry for what I said over at Lydia's. I spoke hastily and rudely. You have saved my brother's life. I will be forever grateful to you. It is useless to try to thank you. I--I hope we may be friends.\\\"\\n\\nAlfred found it desperately hard to resist that low voice, and those dark eyes which were raised shyly, yet bravely, to his. But he had been deeply hurt. He pretended not to see the friendly hand held out to him, and his voice was cold when he answered her.\\n\\n\\\"I am glad to have been of some service,\\\" he said, \\\"but I think you overrate my action. Your brother would not have drowned, I am sure. You owe me nothing. Good-night.\\\"\\n\\nBetty stood still one moment staring at the door through which he had gone before she realized that her overtures of friendship had been politely, but coldly, ignored. She had actually been snubbed. The impossible had happened to Elizabeth Zane. Her first sensation after she recovered from her momentary bewilderment was one of amusement, and she laughed in a constrained manner; but, presently, two bright red spots appeared in her cheeks, and she looked quickly around to see if any of the others had noticed the incident. None of them had been paying any attention to her and she breathed a sigh of relief. It was bad enough to be snubbed without having others see it. That would have been too humiliating. Her eyes flashed fire as she remembered the disdain in Clarke's face, and that she had not been clever enough to see it in time.\\n\\n\\\"Tige, come here!\\\" called Colonel Zane. \\\"What ails the dog?\\\"\\n\\nThe dog had jumped to his feet and ran to the door, where he sniffed at the crack over the threshold. His aspect was fierce and threatening. He uttered low growls and then two short barks. Those in the room heard a soft moccasined footfall outside. The next instant the door opened wide and a tall figure stood disclosed.\\n\\n\\\"Wetzel!\\\" exclaimed Colonel Zane. A hush fell on the little company after that exclamation, and all eyes were fastened on the new comer.\\n\\nWell did the stranger merit close attention. He stalked into the room, leaned his long rifle against the mantelpiece and spread out his hands to the fire. He was clad from head to foot in fringed and beaded buckskin, which showed evidence of a long and arduous tramp. It was torn and wet and covered with mud. He was a magnificently made man, six feet in height, and stood straight as an arrow. His wide shoulders, and his muscular, though not heavy, limbs denoted wonderful strength and activity. His long hair, black as a raven's wing, hung far down his shoulders. Presently he turned and the light shone on a remarkable face. So calm and cold and stern it was that it seemed chiselled out of marble. The most striking features were its unusual pallor, and the eyes, which were coal black, and piercing as the dagger's point.\\n\\n\\\"If you have any bad news out with it,\\\" cried Colonel Zane, impatiently.\\n\\n\\\"No need fer alarm,\\\" said Wetzel. He smiled slightly as he saw Betty's apprehensive face. \\\"Don't look scared, Betty. The redskins are miles away and goin' fer the Kanawha settlement.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\nAny weeks of quiet followed the events of the last chapter. The settlers planted their corn, harvested their wheat and labored in the fields during the whole of one spring and summer without hearing the dreaded war cry of the Indians. Colonel Zane, who had been a disbursing officer in the army of Lord Dunmore, where he had attained the rank of Colonel, visited Fort Pitt during the summer in the hope of increasing the number of soldiers in his garrison. His efforts proved fruitless. He returned to Fort Henry by way of the river with several pioneers, who with their families were bound for Fort Henry. One of these pioneers was a minister who worked in the fields every week day and on Sundays preached the Gospel to those who gathered in the meeting house.\\n\\nAlfred Clarke had taken up his permanent abode at the fort, where he had been installed as one of the regular garrison. His duties, as well as those of the nine other members of the garrison, were light. For two hours out of the twenty-four he was on guard. Thus he had ample time to acquaint himself with the settlers and their families.\\n\\nAlfred and Isaac had now become firm friends. They spent many hours fishing in the river, and roaming the woods in the vicinity, as Colonel Zane would not allow Isaac to stray far from the fort. Alfred became a regular visitor at Colonel Zane's house. He saw Betty every day, but as yet, nothing had mended the breach between them. They were civil to each other when chance threw them together, but Betty usually left the room on some pretext soon after he entered. Alfred regretted his hasty exhibition of resentment and would have been glad to establish friendly relations with her. But she would not give him an opportunity. She avoided him on all possible occasions. Though Alfred was fast succumbing to the charm of Betty's beautiful face, though his desire to be near her had grown well nigh resistless, his pride had not yet broken down. Many of the summer evenings found him on the Colonel's doorstep, smoking a pipe, or playing with the children. He was that rare and best company--a good listener. Although he laughed at Colonel Zane's stories, and never tired of hearing of Isaac's experiences among the Indians, it is probable he would not have partaken of the Colonel's hospitality nearly so often had it not been that he usually saw Betty, and if he got only a glimpse of her he went away satisfied. On Sundays he attended the services at the little church and listened to Betty's sweet voice as she led the singing.\\n\\nThere were a number of girls at the fort near Betty's age. With all of these Alfred was popular. He appeared so entirely different from the usual young man on the frontier that he was more than welcome everywhere. Girls in the backwoods are much the same as girls in thickly populated and civilized districts. They liked his manly ways; his frank and pleasant manners; and when to these virtues he added a certain deferential regard, a courtliness to which they were unaccustomed, they were all the better pleased. He paid the young women little attentions, such as calling on them, taking them to parties and out driving, but there was not one of them who could think that she, in particular, interested him.\\n\\nThe girls noticed, however, that he never approached Betty after service, or on any occasion, and while it caused some wonder and gossip among them, for Betty enjoyed the distinction of being the belle of the border, they were secretly pleased. Little hints and knowing smiles, with which girls are so skillful, made known to Betty all of this, and, although she was apparently indifferent, it hurt her sensitive feelings. It had the effect of making her believe she hated the cause of it more than ever.\\n\\nWhat would have happened had things gone on in this way, I am not prepared to say; probably had not a meddling Fate decided to take a hand in the game, Betty would have continued to think she hated Alfred, and I would never have had occasion to write his story; but Fate did interfere, and, one day in the early fall, brought about an incident which changed the whole world for the two young people.\\n\\nIt was the afternoon of an Indian summer day--in that most beautiful time of all the year--and Betty, accompanied by her dog, had wandered up the hillside into the woods. From the hilltop the broad river could be seen winding away n the distance, and a soft, bluish, smoky haze hung over the water. The forest seemed to be on fire. The yellow leaves of the poplars, the brown of the white and black oaks, the red and purple of the maples, and the green of the pines and hemlocks flamed in a glorious blaze of color. A stillness, which was only broken now and then by the twittering of birds uttering the plaintive notes peculiar to them in the autumn as they band together before their pilgrimage to the far south, pervaded the forest.\\n\\nBetty loved the woods, and she knew all the trees. She could tell their names by the bark or the shape of the leaves. The giant black oak, with its smooth shiny bark and sturdy limbs, the chestnut with its rugged, seamed sides and bristling burrs, the hickory with its lofty height and curled shelling bark, were all well known and well loved by Betty. Many times had she wondered at the trembling, quivering leaves of the aspen, and the foliage of the silver-leaf as it glinted in the sun. To-day, especially, as she walked through the woods, did their beauty appeal to her. In the little sunny patches of clearing which were scattered here and there in the grove, great clusters of goldenrod grew profusely. The golden heads swayed gracefully on the long stems Betty gathered a few sprigs and added to them a bunch of warmly tinted maple leaves.\\n\\nThe chestnuts burrs were opening. As Betty mounted a little rocky eminence and reached out for a limb of a chestnut tree, she lost her footing and fell. Her right foot had twisted under her as she went down, and when a sharp pain shot through it she was unable to repress a cry. She got up, tenderly placed the foot on the ground and tried her weight on it, which caused acute pain. She unlaced and removed her moccasin to find that her ankle had commenced to swell. Assured that she had sprained it, and aware of the serious consequences of an injury of that nature, she felt greatly distressed. Another effort to place her foot on the ground and bear her weight on it caused such severe pain that she was compelled to give up the attempt. Sinking down by the trunk of the tree and leaning her head against it she tried to think of a way out of her difficulty.\\n\\nThe fort, which she could plainly see, seemed a long distance off, although it was only a little way down the grassy slope. She looked and looked, but not a person was to be seen. She called to Tige. She remembered that he had been chasing a squirrel a short while ago, but now there was no sign of him. He did not come at her call. How annoying! If Tige were only there she could have sent him for help. She shouted several times, but the distance was too great for her voice to carry to the fort. The mocking echo of her call came back from the bluff that rose to her left. Betty now began to be alarmed in earnest, and the tears started to roll down her cheeks. The throbbing pain in her ankle, the dread of having to remain out in that lonesome forest after dark, and the fear that she might not be found for hours, caused Betty's usually brave spirit to falter; she was weeping unreservedly.\\n\\nIn reality she had been there only a few minutes--although they seemed hours to her--when she heard the light tread of moccasined feet on the moss behind her. Starting up with a cry of joy she turned and looked up into the astonished face of Alfred Clarke.\\n\\nReturning from a hunt back in the woods he had walked up to her before being aware of her presence. In a single glance he saw the wildflowers scattered beside her, the little moccasin turned inside out, the woebegone, tearstained face, and he knew Betty had come to grief.\\n\\nConfused and vexed, Betty sank back at the foot of the tree. It is probable she would have encountered Girty or a member of his band of redmen, rather than have this young man find her in this predicament. It provoked her to think that of all the people at the fort it should be the only one she could not welcome who should find her in such a sad plight.\\n\\n\\\"Why, Miss Zane!\\\" he exclaimed, after a moment of hesitation. \\\"What in the world has happened? Have you been hurt? May I help you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is nothing,\\\" said Betty, bravely, as she gathered up her flowers and the moccasin and rose slowly to her feet. \\\"Thank you, but you need not wait.\\\"\\n\\nThe cold words nettled Alfred and he was in the act of turning away from her when he caught, for the fleetest part of a second, the full gaze of her eyes. He stopped short. A closer scrutiny of her face convinced him that she was suffering and endeavoring with all her strength to conceal it.\\n\\n\\\"But I will wait. I think you have hurt yourself. Lean upon my arm,\\\" he said, quietly.\\n\\n\\\"Please let me help you,\\\" he continued, going nearer to her.\\n\\nBut Betty refused his assistance. She would not even allow him to take the goldenrod from her arms. After a few hesitating steps she paused and lifted her foot from the ground.\\n\\n\\\"Here, you must not try to walk a step farther,\\\" he said, resolutely, noting how white she had suddenly become. \\\"You have sprained your ankle and are needlessly torturing yourself. Please let me carry you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no, no, no!\\\" cried Betty, in evident distress. \\\"I will manage. It is not so--very--far.\\\"\\n\\nShe resumed the slow and painful walking, but she had taken only a few steps when she stopped again and this time a low moan issued from her lips. She swayed slightly backward and if Alfred had not dropped his rifle and caught her she would have fallen.\\n\\n\\\"Will you--please--for some one?\\\" she whispered faintly, at the same time pushing him away.\\n\\n\\\"How absurd!\\\" burst out Alfred, indignantly. \\\"Am I then, so distasteful to you that you would rather wait here and suffer a half hour longer while I go for assistance? It is only common courtesy on my part. I do not want to carry you. I think you would be quite heavy.\\\"\\n\\nHe said this in a hard, bitter tone, deeply hurt that she would not accept even a little kindness from him. He looked away from her and waited. Presently a soft, half-smothered sob came from Betty and it expressed such utter wretchedness that his heart melted. After all she was only a child. He turned to see the tears running down her cheeks, and with a suppressed imprecation upon the wilfulness of young women in general, and this one in particular, he stepped forward and before she could offer any resistance, he had taken her up in his arms, goldenrod and all, and had started off at a rapid walk toward the fort.\\n\\nBetty cried out in angry surprise, struggled violently for a moment, and then, as suddenly, lay quietly in his arms. His anger changed to self-reproach as he realized what a light burden she made. He looked down at the dark head lying on his shoulder. Her face was hidden by the dusky rippling hair, which tumbled over his breast, brushed against his cheek, and blew across his lips. The touch of those fragrant tresses was a soft caress. Almost unconsciously he pressed her closer to his heart. And as a sweet mad longing grew upon him he was blind to all save that he held her in his arms, that uncertainty was gone forever, and that he loved her. With these thoughts running riot in his brain he carried her down the hill to Colonel Zane's house.\\n\\nThe negro, Sam, who came out of the kitchen, dropped the bucket he had in his hand and ran into the house when he saw them. When Alfred reached the gate Colonel Zane and Isaac were hurrying out to meet him.\\n\\n\\\"For Heaven's sake! What has happened? Is she badly hurt? I have always looked for this,\\\" said the Colonel, excitedly.\\n\\n\\\"You need not look so alarmed,\\\" answered Alfred. \\\"She has only sprained her ankle, and trying to walk afterward hurt her so badly that she became faint and I had to carry her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dear me, is that all?\\\" said Mrs. Zane, who had also come out. \\\"We were terribly frightened. Sam came running into the house with some kind of a wild story. Said he knew you would be the death of Betty.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How ridiculous! Colonel Zane, that servant of yours never fails to say something against me,\\\" said Alfred, as he carried Betty into the house.\\n\\n\\\"He doesn't like you. But you need not mind Sam. He is getting old and we humor him, perhaps too much. We are certainly indebted to you,\\\" returned the Colonel.\\n\\nBetty was laid on the couch and consigned to the skillful hands of Mrs. Zane, who pronounced the injury a bad sprain\\n\\n\\\"Well, Betty, this will keep you quiet for a few days,\\\" said she, with a touch of humor, as she gently felt the swollen ankle.\\n\\n\\\"Alfred, you have been our good angel so often that I don't see how we shall ever reward you,\\\" said Isaac to Alfred.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, that time will come. Don't worry about that,\\\" said Alfred, jestingly, and then, turning to the others he continued, earnestly. \\\"I will apologize for the manner in which I disregarded Miss Zane's wish not to help her. I am sure I could do no less. I believe my rudeness has spared her considerable suffering.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What did he mean, Betts?\\\" asked Isaac, going back to his sister after he had closed the door. \\\"Didn't you want him to help you?\\\"\\n\\nBetty did not answer. She sat on the couch while Mrs. Zane held the little bare foot and slowly poured the hot water over the swollen and discolored ankle. Betty's lips were pale. She winced every time Mrs. Zane touched her foot, but as yet she had not uttered even a sigh.\\n\\n\\\"Betty, does it hurt much?\\\" asked Isaac.\\n\\n\\\"Hurt? Do you think I am made of wood? Of course it hurts,\\\" retorted Betty. \\\"That water is so hot. Bessie, will not cold water do as well?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am sorry. I won't tease any more,\\\" said Isaac, taking his sister's hand. \\\"I'll tell you what, Betty, we owe Alfred Clarke a great deal, you and I. I am going to tell you something so you will know how much more you owe him. Do you remember last month when that red heifer of yours got away. Well, Clarke chased her away and finally caught her in the woods. He asked me to say I had caught her. Somehow or other he seems to be afraid of you. I wish you and he would be good friends. He is a mighty fine fellow.\\\"\\n\\nIn spite of the pain Betty was suffering a bright blush suffused her face at the words of her brother, who, blind as brothers are in regard to their own sisters, went on praising his friend.\\n\\nBetty was confined to the house a week or more and during this enforced idleness she had ample time for reflection and opportunity to inquire into the perplexed state of her mind.\\n\\nThe small room, which Betty called her own, faced the river and fort. Most of the day she lay by the window trying to read her favorite books, but often she gazed out on the quiet scene, the rolling river, the everchanging trees and the pastures in which the red and white cows grazed peacefully; or she would watch with idle, dreamy eyes the flight of the crows over the hills, and the graceful motion of the hawk as he sailed around and around in the azure sky, looking like a white sail far out on a summer sea.\\n\\nBut Betty's mind was at variance with this peaceful scene. The consciousness of a change, which she could not readily define, in her feelings toward Alfred Clarke, vexed and irritated her. Why did she think of him so often? True, he had saved her brother's life. Still she was compelled to admit to herself that this was not the reason. Try as she would, she could not banish the thought of him. Over and over again, a thousand times, came the recollection of that moment when he had taken her up in his arms as though she were a child. Some vague feeling stirred in her heart as she remembered the strong yet gentle clasp of his arms.\\n\\nSeveral times from her window she had seen him coming across the square between the fort and her brother's house, and womanlike, unseen herself, she had watched him. How erect was his carriage. How pleasant his deep voice sounded as she heard him talking to her brother. Day by day, as her ankle grew stronger and she knew she could not remain much longer in her room, she dreaded more and more the thought of meeting him. She could not understand herself; she had strange dreams; she cried seemingly without the slightest cause and she was restless and unhappy. Finally she grew angry and scolded herself. She said she was silly and sentimental. This had the effect of making her bolder, but it did not quiet her unrest. Betty did not know that the little blind God, who steals unawares on his victim, had marked her for his own, and that all this sweet perplexity was the unconscious awakening of the heart.\\n\\nOne afternoon, near the end of Betty's siege indoors, two of her friends, Lydia Boggs and Alice Reynolds, called to see her.\\n\\nAlice had bright blue eyes, and her nut brown hair hung in rebellious curls around her demure and pretty face. An adorable dimple lay hidden in her rosy cheek and flashed into light with her smiles.\\n\\n\\\"Betty, you are a lazy thing!\\\" exclaimed Lydia. \\\"Lying here all day long doing nothing but gaze out of the window.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Girls, I am glad you came over,\\\" said Betty. \\\"I am blue. Perhaps you will cheer me up.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Betty needs some one of the sterner sex to cheer her,\\\" said Alice, mischievously, her eyes twinkling. \\\"Don't you think so, Lydia?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course,\\\" answered Lydia. \\\"When I get blue--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Please spare me,\\\" interrupted Betty, holding up her hands in protest. \\\"I have not a single doubt that your masculine remedies are sufficient for all your ills. Girls who have lost their interest in the old pleasures, who spend their spare time in making linen and quilts, and who have sunk their very personalities in a great big tyrant of a man, are not liable to get blue. They are afraid he may see a tear or a frown. But thank goodness, I have not yet reached that stage.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Betty Zane! Just you wait! Wait!\\\" exclaimed Lydia, shaking her finger at Betty. \\\"Your turn is coming. When it does do not expect any mercy from us, for you shalt never get it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Unfortunately, you and Alice have monopolized the attentions of the only two eligible young men at the fort,\\\" said Betty, with a laugh.\\n\\n\\\"Nonsense there plenty of young men all eager for our favor, you little coquette,\\\" answered Lydia. \\\"Harry Martin, Will Metzer, Captain Swearengen, of Short Creek, and others too numerous to count. Look at Lew Wetzel and Billy Bennet.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lew cares for nothing except hunting Indians and Billy's only a boy,\\\" said Betty.\\n\\n\\\"Well, have it your own way,\\\" said Lydia. \\\"Only this, I know Billy adores you, for he told me so, and a better lad never lived.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lyde, you forget to include one other among those prostrate before Betty's charms,\\\" said Alice.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes, you mean Mr. Clarke. To be sure, I had forgotten him,\\\" answered Lydia. \\\"How odd that he should be the one to find you the day you hurt your foot. Was it an accident?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course. I slipped off the bank,\\\" said Betty.\\n\\n\\\"No, no. I don't mean that. Was his finding you an accident?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you imagine I waylaid Mr. Clarke, and then sprained my ankle on purpose?\\\" said Betty, who began to look dangerous.\\n\\n\\\"Certainly not that; only it seems so odd that he should be the one to rescue all the damsels in distress. Day before yesterday he stopped a runaway horse, and saved Nell Metzer who was in the wagon, a severe shaking up, if not something more serious. She is desperately in love with him. She told me Mr. Clarke--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I really do not care to hear about it,\\\" interrupted Betty.\\n\\n\\\"But, Betty, tell us. Wasn't it dreadful, his carrying you?\\\" asked Alice, with a sly glance at Betty. \\\"You know you are so--so prudish, one may say. Did he take you in his arms? It must have been very embarrassing for you, considering your dislike of Mr. Clarke, and he so much in love with--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You hateful girls,\\\" cried Betty, throwing a pillow at Alice, who just managed to dodge it. \\\"I wish you would go home.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Never mind, Betty. We will not tease anymore,\\\" said Lydia, putting her arm around Betty. \\\"Come, Alice, we will tell Betty you have named the day for your wedding. See! She is all eyes now.\\\"\\n\\n```\\n       * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\\n```\\n\\nThe young people of the frontier settlements were usually married before they were twenty. This was owing to the fact hat there was little distinction of rank and family pride. The object of the pioneers in moving West was, of course, to better their condition; but, the realization of their dependence on one another, the common cause of their labors, and the terrible dangers to which they were continually exposed, brought them together as one large family.\\n\\nTherefore, early love affairs were encouraged--not frowned upon as they are to-day--and they usually resulted in early marriages.\\n\\nHowever, do not let it be imagined that the path of the youthful swain was strewn with flowers. Courting or \\\"sparking\\\" his sweetheart had a painful as well as a joyous side. Many and varied were the tricks played on the fortunate lover by the gallants who had vied with him for the favor of the maid. Brave, indeed, he who won her. If he marched up to her home in the early evening he was made the object of innumerable jests, even the young lady's family indulging in and enjoying the banter. Later, when he come out of the door, it was more than likely that, if it were winter, he would be met by a volley of water soaked snowballs, or big buckets of icewater, or a mountain of snow shoved off the roof by some trickster, who had waited patiently for such an opportunity. On summer nights his horse would be stolen, led far into the woods and tied, or the wheels of his wagon would be taken off and hidden, leaving him to walk home. Usually the successful lover, and especially if he lived at a distance, would make his way only once a week and then late at night to the home of his betrothed. Silently, like a thief in the dark, he would crawl through the grass and shrubs until beneath her window. At a low signal, prearranged between them, she would slip to the door and let him in without disturbing the parents. Fearing to make a light, and perhaps welcoming that excuse to enjoy the darkness beloved by sweethearts, they would sit quietly, whispering low, until the brightening in the east betokened the break of day, and then he was off, happy and lighthearted, to his labors.\\n\\nA wedding was looked forward to with much pleasure by old and young. Practically, it meant the only gathering of the settlers which was not accompanied by the work of reaping the harvest, building a cabin, planning an expedition to relieve some distant settlement, or a defense for themselves. For all, it meant a rollicking good time; to the old people a feast, and the looking on at the merriment of their children--to the young folk, a pleasing break in the monotony of their busy lives, a day given up to fun and gossip, a day of romance, a wedding, and best of all, a dance. Therefore Alice Reynold's wedding proved a great event to the inhabitants of Fort Henry.\\n\\nThe day dawned bright and clear. The sun, rising like a ball of red gold, cast its yellow beams over the bare, brown hills, shining on the cabin roofs white with frost, and making the delicate weblike coat of ice on the river sparkle as if it had been sprinkled with powdered diamonds. William Martin, the groom, and his attendants, met at an appointed time to celebrate an old time-honored custom which always took place before the party started for the house of the bride. This performance was called \\\"the race for the bottle.\\\"\\n\\nA number of young men, selected by the groom, were asked to take part in this race, which was to be run over as rough and dangerous a track as could be found. The worse the road, the more ditches, bogs, trees, stumps, brush, in fact, the more obstacles of every kind, the better, as all these afforded opportunity for daring and expert horsemanship. The English fox race, now famous on three continents, while it involves risk and is sometimes dangerous, cannot, in the sense of hazard to life and limb, be compared to this race for the bottle.\\n\\nOn this day the run was not less exciting than usual. The horses were placed as nearly abreast as possible and the starter gave an Indian yell. Then followed the cracking of whips, the furious pounding of heavy hoofs, the commands of the contestants, and the yells of the onlookers. Away they went at a mad pace down the road. The course extended a mile straight away down the creek bottom. The first hundred yards the horses were bunched. At the ditch beyond the creek bridge a beautiful, clean limbed animal darted from among the furiously galloping horses and sailed over the deep furrow like a bird. All recognized the rider as Alfred Clarke on his black thoroughbred. Close behind was George Martin mounted on a large roan of powerful frame and long stride. Through the willows they dashed, over logs and brush heaps, up the little ridges of rising ground, and down the shallow gullies, unheeding the stinging branches and the splashing water. Half the distance covered and Alfred turned, to find the roan close behind. On a level road he would have laughed at the attempt of that horse to keep up with his racer, but he was beginning to fear that the strong limbed stallion deserved his reputation. Directly before them rose a pile of logs and matted brush, placed there by the daredevil settlers who had mapped out the route. It was too high for any horse to be put at. With pale cheek and clinched teeth Alfred touched the spurs to Roger and then threw himself forward. The gallant beast responded nobly. Up, up, up he rose, clearing all but the topmost branches. Alfred turned again and saw the giant roan make the leap without touching a twig. The next instant Roger went splash into a swamp. He sank to his knees in the soft black soil. He could move but one foot at a time, and Alfred saw at a glance he had won the race. The great weight of the roan handicapped him here. When Alfred reached the other side of the bog, where the bottle was swinging from a branch of a tree, his rival's horse was floundering hopelessly in the middle of the treacherous mire. The remaining three horsemen, who had come up by this time, seeing that it would be useless to attempt further efforts, had drawn up on the bank. With friendly shouts to Clarke, they acknowledged themselves beaten. There were no judges required for this race, because the man who reached the bottle first won it.\\n\\nThe five men returned to the starting point, where the victor was greeted by loud whoops. The groom got the first drink from the bottle, then came the attendants, and others in order, after which the bottle was put away to be kept as a memento of the occasion.\\n\\nThe party now repaired to the village and marched to the home of the bride. The hour for the observance of the marriage rites was just before the midday meal. When the groom reached the bride's home he found her in readiness. Sweet and pretty Alice looked in her gray linsey gown, perfectly plain and simple though it was, without an ornament or a ribbon. Proud indeed looked her lover as he took her hand and led her up to the waiting minister. When the whisperings had ceased the minister asked who gave this woman to be married. Alice's father answered.\\n\\n\\\"Will you take this woman to be your wedded wife, to love, cherish and protect her all the days of her life?\\\" asked the minister.\\n\\n\\\"I will,\\\" answered a deep bass voice.\\n\\n\\\"Will you take this man to be your wedded husband, to love, honor and obey him all the days of your life?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will,\\\" said Alice, in a low tone.\\n\\n\\\"I pronounce you man and wife. Those whom God has joined together let no man put asunder.\\\"\\n\\nThere was a brief prayer and the ceremony ended. Then followed the congratulations of relatives and friends. The felicitations were apt to be trying to the nerves of even the best tempered groom. The hand shakes, the heavy slaps on the back, and the pommeling he received at the hands of his intimate friends were as nothing compared to the anguish of mind he endured while they were kissing his wife. The young bucks would not have considered it a real wedding had they been prevented from kissing the bride, and for that matter, every girl within reach. So fast as the burly young settlers could push themselves through the densely packed rooms they kissed the bride, and then the first girl they came to.\\n\\nBetty and Lydia had been Alice's maids of honor. This being Betty's first experience at a frontier wedding, it developed that she was much in need of Lydia's advice, which she had previously disdained. She had rested secure in her dignity. Poor Betty! The first man to kiss Alice was George Martin, a big, strong fellow, who gathered his brother's bride into his arms and gave her a bearish hug and a resounding kiss. Releasing her he turned toward Lydia and Betty. Lydia eluded him, but one of his great hands clasped around Betty's wrist. She tried to look haughty, but with everyone laughing, and the young man's face expressive of honest fun and happiness she found it impossible. She stood still and only turned her face a little to one side while George kissed her. The young men now made a rush for her. With blushing cheeks Betty, unable to stand her ground any longer, ran to her brother, the Colonel. He pushed her away with a laugh. She turned to Major McColloch, who held out his arms to her. With an exclamation she wrenched herself free from a young man, who had caught her hand, and flew to the Major. But alas for Betty! The Major was not proof against the temptation and he kissed her himself.\\n\\n\\\"Traitor!\\\" cried Betty, breaking away from him.\\n\\nPoor Betty was in despair. She had just made up her mind to submit when she caught sight of Wetzel's familiar figure. She ran to him and the hunter put one of his long arms around her.\\n\\n\\\"I reckon I kin take care of you, Betty,\\\" he said, a smile playing over his usually stern face. \\\"See here, you young bucks. Betty don't want to be kissed, and if you keep on pesterin' her I'll have to scalp a few of you.\\\"\\n\\nThe merriment grew as the day progressed. During the wedding feast great hilarity prevailed. It culminated in the dance which followed the dinner. The long room of the block-house had been decorated with evergreens, autumn leaves and goldenrod, which were scattered profusely about, hiding the blackened walls and bare rafters. Numerous blazing pine knots, fastened on sticks which were stuck into the walls, lighted up a scene, which for color and animation could not have been surpassed.\\n\\nColonel Zane's old slave, Sam, who furnished the music, sat on a raised platform at the upper end of the hall, and the way he sawed away on his fiddle, accompanying the movements of his arm with a swaying of his body and a stamping of his heavy foot, showed he had a hearty appreciation of his own value.\\n\\nProminent among the men and women standing and sitting near the platform could be distinguished the tall forms of Jonathan Zane, Major McColloch and Wetzel, all, as usual, dressed in their hunting costumes and carrying long rifles. The other men had made more or less effort to improve their appearance. Bright homespun shirts and scarfs had replaced the everyday buckskin garments. Major McColloch was talking to Colonel Zane. The genial faces of both reflected the pleasure they felt in the enjoyment of the younger people. Jonathan Zane stood near the door. Moody and silent he watched the dance. Wetzel leaned against the wall. The black barrel of his rifle lay in the hollow of his arm. The hunter was gravely contemplating the members of the bridal party who were dancing in front of him. When the dance ended Lydia and Betty stopped before Wetzel and Betty said: \\\"Lew, aren't you going to ask us to dance?\\\"\\n\\nThe hunter looked down into the happy, gleaming faces, and smiling in his half sad way, answered: \\\"Every man to his gifts.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you can dance. I want you to put aside your gun long enough to dance with me. If I waited for you to ask me, I fear I should have to wait a long time. Come, Lew, here I am asking you, and I know the other men are dying to dance with me,\\\" said Betty, coaxingly, in a roguish voice.\\n\\nWetzel never refused a request of Betty's, and so, laying aside his weapons, he danced with her, to the wonder and admiration of all. Colonel Zane clapped his hands, and everyone stared in amazement at the unprecedented sight Wetzel danced not ungracefully. He was wonderfully light on his feet. His striking figure, the long black hair, and the fancifully embroidered costume he wore contrasted strangely with Betty's slender, graceful form and pretty gray dress.\\n\\n\\\"Well, well, Lewis, I would not have believed anything but the evidence of my own eyes,\\\" said Colonel Zane, with a laugh, as Betty and Wetzel approached him.\\n\\n\\\"If all the men could dance as well as Lew, the girls would be thankful, I can assure you,\\\" said Betty.\\n\\n\\\"Betty, I declare you grow prettier every day,\\\" said old John Bennet, who was standing with the Colonel and the Major. \\\"If I were only a young man once more I should try my chances with you, and I wouldn't give up very easily.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do not know, Uncle John, but I am inclined to think that if you were a young man and should come a-wooing you would not get a rebuff from me,\\\" answered Betty, smiling on the old man, of whom she was very fond.\\n\\n\\\"Miss Zane, will you dance with me?\\\"\\n\\nThe voice sounded close by Betty's side. She recognized it, and an unaccountable sensation of shyness suddenly came over her. She had firmly made up her mind, should Mr. Clarke ask her to dance, that she would tell him she was tired, or engaged for that number--anything so that she could avoid dancing with him. But, now that the moment had come she either forgot her resolution or lacked the courage to keep it, for as the music commenced, she turned and without saying a word or looking at him, she placed her hand on his arm. He whirled her away. She gave a start of surprise and delight at the familiar step and then gave herself up to the charm of the dance. Supported by his strong arm she floated around the room in a sort of dream. Dancing as they did was new to the young people at the Fort--it was a style then in vogue in the east--and everyone looked on with great interest and curiosity. But all too soon the dance ended and before Betty had recovered her composure she found that her partner had led her to a secluded seat in the lower end of the hall. The bench was partly obscured from the dancers by masses of autumn leaves. \\\"That was a very pleasant dance,\\\" said Alfred. \\\"Miss Boggs told me you danced the round dance.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I was much surprised and pleased,\\\" said Betty, who had indeed enjoyed it.\\n\\n\\\"It has been a delightful day,\\\" went on Alfred, seeing that Betty was still confused. \\\"I almost killed myself in that race for the bottle this morning. I never saw such logs and brush heaps and ditches in my life. I am sure that if the fever of recklessness which seemed in the air had not suddenly seized me I would never have put my horse at such leaps.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I heard my brother say your horse was one of the best he had ever seen, and that you rode superbly,\\\" murmured Betty.\\n\\n\\\"Well, to be honest, I would not care to take that ride again. It certainly was not fair to the horse.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How do you like the fort by this time?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Miss Zane, I am learning to love this free, wild life. I really think I was made for the frontier. The odd customs and manners which seemed strange at first have become very acceptable to me now. I find everyone so honest and simple and brave. Here one must work to live, which is right. Do you know, I never worked in my life until I came to Fort Henry. My life was all uselessness, idleness.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can hardly believe that,\\\" answered Betty. \\\"You have learned to dance and ride and--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What?\\\" asked Alfred, as Betty hesitated.\\n\\n\\\"Never mind.\\\" It was an accomplishment with which the girls credited you,\\\" said Betty, with a little laugh.\\n\\n\\\"I suppose I did not deserve it. I heard I had a singular aptitude for discovering young ladies in distress.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have you become well acquainted with the boys?\\\" asked Betty, hastening to change the subject.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes, particularly with your Indianized brother, Isaac. He is the finest fellow, as well as the most interesting, I ever knew. I like Colonel Zane immensely too. The dark, quiet fellow, Jack, or John, they call him, is not like your other brothers. The hunter, Wetzel, inspires me with awe. Everyone has been most kind to me and I have almost forgotten that I was a wanderer.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am glad to hear that,\\\" said Betty.\\n\\n\\\"Miss Zane,\\\" continued Alfred, \\\"doubtless you have heard that I came West because I was compelled to leave my home. Please do not believe everything you hear of me. Some day I may tell you my story if you care to hear it. Suffice it to say now that I left my home of my own free will and I could go back to-morrow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I did not mean to imply--\\\" began Betty, coloring.\\n\\n\\\"Of course not. But tell me about yourself. Is it not rather dull and lonesome here for you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It was last winter. But I have been contented and happy this summer. Of course, it is not Philadelphia life, and I miss the excitement and gayety of my uncle's house. I knew my place was with my brothers. My aunt pleaded with me to live with her and not go to the wilderness. I had everything I wanted there--luxury, society, parties, balls, dances, friends--all that the heart of a girl could desire, but I preferred to come to this little frontier settlement. Strange choice for a girl, was it not?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Unusual, yes,\\\" answered Alfred, gravely. \\\"And I cannot but wonder what motives actuated our coming to Fort Henry. I came to seek my fortune. You came to bring sunshine into the home of your brother, and left your fortune behind you. Well, your motive has the element of nobility. Mine has nothing but that of recklessness. I would like to read the future.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do not think it is right to have such a wish. With the veil rolled away could you work as hard, accomplish as much? I do not want to know the future. Perhaps some of it will be unhappy. I have made my choice and will cheerfully abide by it. I rather envy your being a man. You have the world to conquer. A woman--what can she do? She can knead the dough, ply the distaff, and sit by the lattice and watch and wait.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let us postpone such melancholy thoughts until some future day. I have not as yet said anything that I intended I wish to tell you how sorry I am that I acted in such a rude way the night your brother came home. I do not know what made me do so, but I know I have regretted it ever since. Will you forgive me and may we not be friends?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I--I do not know,\\\" said Betty, surprised and vaguely troubled by the earnest light in his eyes.\\n\\n\\\"But why? Surely you will make some little allowance for a naturally quick temper, and you know you did not--that you were--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I remember I was hasty and unkind. But I made amends, or at least, I tried to do so.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Try to overlook my stupidity. I will not give up until you forgive me. Consider how much you can avoid by being generous.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well, then, I will forgive you,\\\" said Betty, who had arrived at the conclusion that this young man was one of determination.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you. I promise you shall never regret it. And the sprained ankle? It must be well, as I noticed you danced beautifully.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am compelled to believe what the girls say--that you are inclined to the language of compliment. My ankle is nearly well, thank you. It hurts a little now and then.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Speaking of your accident reminds me of the day it happened,\\\" said Alfred, watching her closely. He desired to tease her a little, but he was not sure of his ground. \\\"I had been all day in the woods with nothing but my thoughts--mostly unhappy ones--for company. When I met you I pretended to be surprised. As a matter of fact I was not, for I had followed your dog. He took a liking to me and I was extremely pleased, I assure you. Well, I saw your face a moment before you knew I was as near you. When you heard my footsteps you turned with a relieved and joyous cry. When you saw whom it was your glad expression changed, and if I had been a hostile Wyandot you could not have looked more unfriendly. Such a woeful, tear-stained face I never saw.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Clarke, please do not speak any more of that,\\\" said Betty with dignity. \\\"I desire that you forget it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will forget all except that it was I who had the happiness of finding you and of helping you. I cannot forget that. I am sure we should never have been friends but for that accident.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is Isaac. He is looking for me,\\\" answered Betty, rising.\\n\\n\\\"Wait a moment longer--please. He will find you,\\\" said Alfred, detaining her. \\\"Since you have been so kind I have grown bolder. May I come over to see you to-morrow?\\\"\\n\\nHe looked straight down into the dark eyes which wavered and fell before he had completed his question.\\n\\n\\\"There is Isaac. He cannot see me here. I must go.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But not before telling me. What is the good of your forgiving me if I may not see you. Please say yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You may come,\\\" answered Betty, half amused and half provoked at his persistence. \\\"I should think you would know that such permission invariably goes with a young woman's forgiveness.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hello, here you are. What a time I have had in finding you,\\\" said Isaac, coming up with flushed face and eyes bright with excitement. \\\"Alfred, what do you mean by hiding the belle of the dance away like this? I want to dance with you, Betts. I am having a fine time. I have not danced anything but Indian dances for ages. Sorry to take her away, Alfred. I can see she doesn't want to go. Ha! Ha!\\\" and with a mischievous look at both of them he led Betty away.\\n\\nAlfred kept his seat awhile lost in thought. Suddenly he remembered that it would look strange if he did not make himself agreeable, so he got up and found a partner. He danced with Alice, Lydia, and the other young ladies. After an hour he slipped away to his room. He wished to be alone. He wanted to think; to decide whether it would be best for him to stay at the fort, or ride away in the darkness and never return. With the friendly touch of Betty's hand the madness with which he had been battling for weeks rushed over him stronger than ever. The thrill of that soft little palm remained with him, and he pressed the hand it had touched to his lips.\\n\\nFor a long hour he sat by his window. He could dimly see the broad winding river, with its curtain of pale gray mist, and beyond, the dark outline of the forest. A cool breeze from the water fanned his heated brow, and the quiet and solitude soothed him.\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\n\\\"Good morning, Harry. Where are you going so early?\\\" called Betty from the doorway.\\n\\nA lad was passing down the path in front of Colonel Zane's house as Betty hailed him. He carried a rifle almost as long as himself.\\n\\n\\\"Mornin', Betty. I am goin' 'cross the crick fer that turkey I hear gobblin',\\\" he answered, stopping at the gate and smiling brightly at Betty.\\n\\n\\\"Hello, Harry Bennet. Going after that turkey? I have heard him several mornings and he must be a big, healthy gobbler,\\\" said Colonel Zane, stepping to the door. \\\"You are going to have company. Here comes Wetzel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good morning, Lew. Are you too off on a turkey hunt?\\\" said Betty.\\n\\n\\\"Listen,\\\" said the hunter, as he stopped and leaned against the gate. They listened. All was quiet save for the tinkle of a cow-bell in the pasture adjoining the Colonel's barn. Presently the silence was broken by a long, shrill, peculiar cry.\\n\\n\\\"Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug-chug.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, it's a turkey, all right, and I'll bet a big gobbler,\\\" remarked Colonel Zane, as the cry ceased.\\n\\n\\\"Has Jonathan heard it?\\\" asked Wetzel.\\n\\n\\\"Not that I know of. Why do you ask?\\\" said the Colonel, in a low tone. \\\"Look here, Lew, is that not a genuine call?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Goodbye, Harry, be sure and bring me a turkey,\\\" called Betty, as she disappeared.\\n\\n\\\"I calkilate it's a real turkey,\\\" answered the hunter, and motioning the lad to stay behind, he shouldered his rifle and passed swiftly down the path.\\n\\nOf all the Wetzel family--a family noted from one end of the frontier to the other--Lewis was as the most famous.\\n\\nThe early history of West Virginia and Ohio is replete with the daring deeds of this wilderness roamer, this lone hunter and insatiable Nemesis, justly called the greatest Indian slayer known to men.\\n\\nWhen Lewis was about twenty years old, and his brothers John and Martin little older, they left their Virginia home for a protracted hunt. On their return they found the smoking ruins of the home, the mangled remains of father and mother, the naked and violated bodies of their sisters, and the scalped and bleeding corpse of a baby brother.\\n\\nLewis Wetzel swore sleepless and eternal vengeance on the whole Indian race. Terribly did he carry out that resolution. From that time forward he lived most of the time in the woods, and an Indian who crossed his trail was a doomed man. The various Indian tribes gave him different names. The Shawnees called him \\\"Long Knife;\\\" the Hurons, \\\"Destroyer;\\\" the Delawares, \\\"Death Wind,\\\" and any one of these names would chill the heart of the stoutest warrior.\\n\\nTo most of the famed pioneer hunters of the border, Indian fighting was only a side issue--generally a necessary one--but with Wetzel it was the business of his life. He lived solely to kill Indians. He plunged recklessly into the strife, and was never content unless roaming the wilderness solitudes, trailing the savages to their very homes and ambushing the village bridlepath like a panther waiting for his prey. Often in the gray of the morning the Indians, sleeping around their camp fire, were awakened by a horrible, screeching yell. They started up in terror only to fall victims to the tomahawk of their merciless foe, or to hear a rifle shot and get a glimpse of a form with flying black hair disappearing with wonderful quickness in the forest. Wetzel always left death behind him, and he was gone before his demoniac yell ceased to echo throughout the woods. Although often pursued, he invariably eluded the Indians, for he was the fleetest runner on the border.\\n\\nFor many years he was considered the right hand of the defense of the fort. The Indians held him in superstitious dread, and the fact that he was known to be in the settlement had averted more than one attack by the Indians.\\n\\nMany regarded Wetzel as a savage, a man who was mad for the blood of the red men, and without one redeeming quality. But this was an unjust opinion. When that restless fever for revenge left him--it was not always with him--he was quiet and peaceable. To those few who knew him well he was even amiable. But Wetzel, although known to everyone, cared for few. He spent little time in the settlements and rarely spoke except when addressed.\\n\\nNature had singularly fitted him for his pre-eminent position among scouts and hunters. He was tall and broad across the shoulders; his strength, agility and endurance were marvelous; he had an eagle eye, the sagacity of the bloodhound, and that intuitive knowledge which plays such an important part in a hunter's life. He knew not fear. He was daring where daring was the wiser part. Crafty, tireless and implacable, Wetzel was incomparable in his vocation.\\n\\nHis long raven-black hair, of which he was vain, when combed out reached to within a foot of the ground. He had a rare scalp, one for which the Indians would have bartered anything.\\n\\nA favorite Indian decoy, and the most fatal one, was the imitation of the call of the wild turkey. It had often happened that men from the settlements who had gone out for a turkey which had been gobbling, had not returned.\\n\\nFor several mornings Wetzel had heard a turkey call, and becoming suspicious of it, had determined to satisfy himself. On the east side of the creek hill there was a cavern some fifty or sixty yards above the water. The entrance to this cavern was concealed by vines and foliage. Wetzel knew of it, and, crossing the stream some distance above, he made a wide circuit and came up back of the cave. Here he concealed himself in a clump of bushes and waited. He had not been there long when directly below him sounded the cry, \\\"Chug-a-lug, Chug-a-lug, Chug-a-lug.\\\" At the same time the polished head and brawny shoulders of an Indian warrior rose out of the cavern. Peering cautiously around, the savage again gave the peculiar cry, and then sank back out of sight. Wetzel screened himself safely in his position and watched the savage repeat the action at least ten times before he made up his mind that the Indian was alone in the cave. When he had satisfied himself of this he took a quick aim at the twisted tuft of hair and fired. Without waiting to see the result of his shot--so well did he trust his unerring aim--he climbed down the steep bank and brushing aside the vines entered the cave. A stalwart Indian lay in the entrance with his face pressed down on the vines. He still clutched in his sinewy fingers the buckhorn mouthpiece with which he had made the calls that had resulted in his death.\",\"timestamp\":1640148397,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"Had the Major not jumped into the clump of pine trees which grow thickly some thirty feet below the summit he would not now be alive,\\\" \"},\"digest\":\"ivBt0n9cKCYP4OVoejKxjG-48-aBDaB-LRTBCBN5N7s\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x19BebfD5a2946bC50A2CeA661e77fFC2F12C9549\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"47vtZsI9-61PKMmrfVCJzPPaAqp87gcXQco_qeyiCYM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ay_jnrzoI1keuwQSAjbF4l4TrS4y8p8Imtv9x_tv9M4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"vhe4SLNSPPloCkgjOfykMHXtYcweKOTWkch7vzUJo9w9JPXYUfBC4A3fhGG4MCcruikaO1gBnqZkk7iGHHe9XA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xbec49d625889cd170a814722be8976da05bbdac613638619956b22ec5e27c23521e472fc02dc30f381cc46244703a42a13dcd42c96ccc48d8ed449004bf2761c1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"47vtZsI9-61PKMmrfVCJzPPaAqp87gcXQco_qeyiCYM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ay_jnrzoI1keuwQSAjbF4l4TrS4y8p8Imtv9x_tv9M4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ivBt0n9cKCYP4OVoejKxjG-48-aBDaB-LRTBCBN5N7s\"}"
