"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**1) Market capitalism is not a religion** \\n\\nMarket capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster. You’d have to be a fool to worship it. For our ruling class, more investment banking is always the answer. They teach us it’s more virtuous to devote your life to some soulless corporation than it is to raise your own kids.\\n\\nWe do not exist to serve markets. Just the opposite. Any economic system that weakens and destroys families is not worth having.\\n\\n**2) Staggering gap in increase in hourly compensation and the rise of credit cards**\\n\\nFrom 1948 to 1973, American hourly compensation grew 91 percent. \\n\\nFrom 1973 to 2013, American hourly compensation grew just 9.2 percent. \\n\\nWorkers didn’t suddenly become less productive in the 1970s. Just the opposite. People have produced more value than ever over the last half century. They’ve just gotten paid as if they haven’t. \\n\\nThe top earners saw their hourly wage climb 27 percent between 1979 and 2016.11 But for the middle class it grew just 3 percent over those same years. \\n\\nHistorians frequently point to the decline in unions and rise of globalization as catalysts for this stagnation. But why did those forces become so powerful? What was pushing them? It was their belief in financial maximization. The goal wasn’t to build a better future, raise the standard of living, or serve the needs of the public. It was to financially maximize right now. Our new hidden default. Just as families were struggling with newly stagnant wages in the 1970s, a miraculous new savior appeared. It was called the credit card.\\n\\n**3) Apple’s Fascinating History (The movie missed it!)**\\n\\nMazzucato demonstrates that the technology behind every part of the iPhone—from the touch screen to 3G wireless to GPS to the internet itself—was directly funded by the US government. Apple brilliantly commercialized the technology, but the work behind the iPhone was created by academic researchers funded by federal investments. \\n\\nThe work goes back decades. After the Second World War, the United States began investing heavily in research in science, technology, medicine, and other fields through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. This agency is in charge of identifying and funding technologies that could provide military and domestic benefits Apple, the same company that parks money offshore to avoid billions in taxes, took start-up money from the US government? \\n\\n*That* wasn’t in the movie.\\n\\nYancey concludes, financial maximization isn’t a plan. It’s a trap.\\n\\n**4) Bento box decision making**\\n\\nBentoism (an acronym for BEyond Near Term Orientation) is a wider lens for what's valuable and in our self-interest. This includes what I as an individual want and need right now (Now Me). But it also makes space for the considerations of our future selves (Future Me), the people we rely on and who rely on us (Now Us), and the next generation (Future Us).
