"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Below is an unedited story generated by AI (GPT) on the meaning of life and use of a crowbar.\\n\\nThis was generated using the following first paragraph prompt..\\n\\n```\\nCame into the office today, to clean my desk in preparation for socially distant working. In the process, I've found and thrown away a) a packet of sugar, b) two sachets of handwarming gel, and c) a crowbar.\\n```\\n\\n```\\nI'm not sure what's worse; that I didn't think about it before or that I did now.\\n\\n\\\"So you know how to use a crowbar?\\n\\n> You take CROWBAR.\\nYou grab the crowbar with both hands and swing it at your desk. The crowbar hits the floor with a clatter, but luckily doesn't break.\\n\\n> You walk EAST.\\nA poster on the wall informs you that there's a \\\"staff meeting\\\" at 11am. If you're going to find out what's going on, that's where you need to be.\\n\\n> You use CROWBAR on EDITOR.\\nYou return to the main office with the crowbar. The editor is staring at it.\\n\\n\\\"Uh... It's a crowbar,\\\" you say awkwardly.\\n\\n\\\"You put in so much effort, didn't you?\\\" the editor frowns.\\n\\n\\\"It seemed... necessary.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Necessary,\\\" the editor sighs. \\\"Give it to me.\\\"\\n\\nYour eyebrows rise in surprise.\\n\\n\\\"Are you... sure?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course,\\\" the editor says. \\\"It's a crowbar. It's meant to be used. It's not doing anyone any good just lying around. Now hand it over.\\\"\\n\\nYou hand the crowbar to the editor.\\n\\n\\\"I don't understand,\\\" you say.\\n\\n\\\"Use your brain,\\\" the editor says. \\\"You wanted a story. Well, you've got one.\\\"\\n\\nYou stare at the editor in confusion.\\n\\n\\\"What are you talking about?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The crowbar, dummy! What else?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't understand. What's the story? There's nothing to the crowbar.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course there is.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, there isn't,\\\" you say. \\\"It's just a... just a simple metal bar that helps with opening things.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Exactly,\\\" the editor smiles. \\\"It's a metaphor. For all of us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I... I give up.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All of us in this office are different people. We have different thoughts, different feelings, different desires... but we're all part of the same machine. We do the same tasks every day.\\\"\\n\\nYour eyes narrow.\\n\\n\\\"What's your point? I don't see how this is a story.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's a metaphor. The bar is you. You're a simple person. You have no depth, no complexity. You're just... a bar. You're just meant to be used.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think you've lost it,\\\" you say. \\\"I'm not a bar, I'm a person.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Fine,\\\" the editor says. \\\"You're a person. The point is, you're no more special than any of us. We're all cogs in a machine. You, me, everyone. We all have our uses, but we're not important in and of ourselves.\\\"\\n\\nYou stare at the editor, aghast.\\n\\n\\\"If that's how you feel, then I pity you,\\\" you say. \\\"You can't just... reduce people to objects. We're all individuals.\\\"\\n\\nThe editor stares at you in confusion.\\n\\n\\\"What do you mean? I'm not reducing people to objects if I say they're all the same. That's literally what an object is. It's an individual piece of a greater whole. A screw has no meaning on its own, but it's important because it helps build a desk. A person is the same. I'm not saying people don't have dreams, hopes, loved ones... of course they do. But we're all just cogs in a greater machine. If one cog stops working, then the whole thing grinds to a halt. So you see? You're a cog. Me? I'm another type of cog. It's a shame you can't see the bigger picture. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to remove you from the machinery.\\\"\\n\\nThe editor steps forward, offering you the crowbar.\\n\\n\\\"Here,\\\" he says. \\\"Break my skull. I don't mind. It's what I'm here for.\\\"\\n\\nYou stare at him in confusion.\\n\\n\\\"I... What?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Break my skull,\\\" the editor repeats. \\\"If you're a cog, then it's your duty to destroy another cog. It's what you're here for.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's ridiculous. Cogs don't kill each other. They just... slide past each other.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No! Sometimes, cogs get stuck. When that happens, you need to unstick them. Sometimes, you need to break them. Break me. I don't mind. I've lived a good life, and I've had a great career. Now, smash my skull open. That's what I'm here for. That's what I'm for.\\\"\\n\\nYou stare at him, completely aghast.\\n\\n\\\"I... You... What? No! I'm not doing that! That's... Why would you want me to do that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because it'll give meaning to your life,\\\" the editor says. \\\"If you kill me, it'll mean you've reached the top. You'll be the best there is. That's all any of us ever want, deep down. To be the best. To be the best mouser, the best hunter, the best writer... This is your chance. Break my skull. Prove you're the best there is. Prove you deserve your freedom.\\\"\\n\\nYou stare at him, unsure how to respond. Finally, you speak.\\n\\n\\\"I'm... I don't want to kill you,\\\" you say.\\n\\n\\\"Are you sure? Think it over. Seriously. Because if you don't kill me, I'm going to have to kill you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why?\\\" you ask.\\n\\n\\\"Because you've proven yourself to be unreliable. If you won't kill me, I know you won't continue writing for the company. And if you won't do that, you're a threat to the company. So, I have to kill you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So...\\\" you say, swallowing. \\\"If I kill you, you'll let me go?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. You'll be free. The bird will be free. All will be free. So, will you do it? Kill me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I... Yes. I will,\\\" you say.\\n\\nThe editor smiles.\\n\\n\\\"Good. Then kill me. Do it now. Do it here. I'd rather not make a mess in the office. I still have so much work to do, you see. But you've got plenty of time to clean up, don't you? You're the boss now.\\\"\\n\\nYou raise the crowbar, staring at the old man. He stares back, smiling.\\n\\n\\\"Just remember,\\\" he says. \\\"I did this for you.\\\"\\n\\nAnd, with that, you bring the crowbar down against his head, and feel it crack under your strength. The old man's face collapses, and he slumps forward.\\n\\nHis body rapidly begins turning to stone. First, his face goes, then his hands, his feet, his arms, his legs. His entire body is transformed into a gray statue, and then that too crumbles to dust. You're left in a room with a pile of dust in the middle of it, and all that remains of the old man who changed your life.\\nYou set down the crowbar, and walk towards the door. You open it, revealing the long, empty hallway. You could try to make your escape. You could head to the exit and leave this place forever. Nobody would try to stop you.\\n\\nBut there's more dust left. There's more ink and more paper. \\nMore stories to be told, more pictures to be painted, more sounds to be heard. This place didn't save you. It didn't change you. But it gave you something to do. It taught you that life is worth living, and that play is just as important as anything else.\\n\\nThere's more dust left. More...\\n\\nTHE END\\n```\",\"timestamp\":1633532336,\"title\":\"An AI writes about cogs in the machine of life\"},\"digest\":\"3sXlHt1T3jhp2ObS4t_ll3aklHCNpIeXFLFRcvyZuwA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4b3F8321C62982f2dfDB51AAC001e7E74c14A865\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Ou6qqEHDI6ipOc3KUcuQnJJp-MoWuh3JMkznqtlneMs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"x0TGxkaI-4xfAkiXUGwounA7btb_h1SLA0DBumu886k\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"dzhy-spytnf9_2tlFAq1fUwXjf2VJMEVBRo54y36mXQIRPGd6zgns_XNxhTeLLkXVb2ffMlKcTtYzNeviVkhMw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa2437ca44186f98f7f1b79901fa9aeb574c8eacc0e5dbfb2e71891482458bcf35c1ce3b1956e0ce795d7cbeff80cf38f888ee3202e231cdef2fbefa12e8de7051c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Ou6qqEHDI6ipOc3KUcuQnJJp-MoWuh3JMkznqtlneMs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"x0TGxkaI-4xfAkiXUGwounA7btb_h1SLA0DBumu886k\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"x86LIxc5CynOyrSZCQw3l18wKUt24NKkzbHbdsjKf14\"}"
