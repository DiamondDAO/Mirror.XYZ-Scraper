"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"A **blockchain** is a method to maintain a register of transactions among nodes (computers) without a central entity entrusted to update and keep the register secure. Instead, the responsibility of checking the validity of each transaction is shared amongst all the nodes in the network. The code is in charge of validating transactions (known as “making commitments), not the people running the code, making a well designed blockchain a truly autonomous system. \\n\\nImagine a table of a database, in which data about each transaction is collected from the nodes involved in the transaction and verified by all other nodes in the network, thus making it impossible for a single node to act in a malicious way without the behavior being noticed by other nodes. After a certain number of transactions have been written in a table, the table is considered full and a cryptographic mechanism (called hash function) is used to “seal” the contents of the table. This \\\"table\\\" is called **a block**. The “seal” is called **a consensus mechanism**.\\n\\nAfter each block is “sealed”, a new block is started with the exact same rules and this goes on, virtually forever. This is called a **blockchain**.\\n\\n**Smart contracts** (pieces of code) are digital contracts stored on a blockchain that are automatically executed when predetermined terms and conditions are met. Smart contracts ensure that the code correctly validates transactions and that people can’t interfere with the blockchain.\\n\\nIf a malicious network participant adds a block that the code cannot validate, that block is eliminated from the chain. If a malicious network participant stats a new chain with altered blocks, the new chain will never surpass the original chain in length, thus the original chain will always be recognized as the correct one.\\n\\nBlockchains are important for the future of Internet services because they distribute trust amongst participants in a network rather than having a third party or central point that needs to validate transactions on the network. \\n\\nUse cases for blockchains:\\n\\n* Decentralized finance (DeFi, essentially transacting crypto currencies);\\n* Healthcare (securely transfer sensitive medical information);\\n* Internet of Things (collecting and distributing real-time information to blockchain-connected machines);\\n* Identity management (using distributed ledger technology);\\n* etc.\\n\\n**Recommended reading/viewing to further understand the idea of a blockchain:**\\n\\n[https://a16z.com/2020/01/27/computers-that-make-commitments/](https://a16z.com/2020/01/27/computers-that-make-commitments/)\\n\\n[https://hackernoon.com/wtf-is-the-blockchain-1da89ba19348](https://hackernoon.com/wtf-is-the-blockchain-1da89ba19348)\\n\\n[https://preethikasireddy.medium.com/eli5-what-do-we-mean-by-blockchains-are-trustless-aa420635d5f6](https://preethikasireddy.medium.com/eli5-what-do-we-mean-by-blockchains-are-trustless-aa420635d5f6)\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0JdeRzVndI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0JdeRzVndI)\\n\\nThis article is part of the Web3 as a skill initiative.
