"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Great transition teams can average nearly a goal per match from these possessions. In fact, this season's [Bayern Munich](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=132) team is currently averaging 1.1. Julian Nagelsmann's squad has scored 18 goals from such possessions in 2021-22 and allowed just four: they might be the best and most persistent transition team since Nagelsmann's [RB Leipzig](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=11420) scored 33 such goals in league play in 2019-20 and allowed just eight. They are dominant in all phases of the game, but prolific transitions have helped them stake a nine-point Bundesliga lead at the midway point of the season.\\n\\nData from these transition possessions ends up being one part quality, one part philosophy. As you might expect, rich and athletic teams like Bayern and PSG (before 2020-21, anyway) have generally been the best at combining transition scoring opportunities while limiting opponents' chances. But for everyone else, it's a tactical card to play.\\n\\nTake, for instance, [Mainz](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=2950) and Wolves.\\n\\nMainz have generated 24 points in 17 matches (1.41 per match), good for ninth place in the Bundesliga and four points from the top four. Their matches are chaotic and exciting, featuring 1.35 combined goals per match from transition possessions -- 0.71 for Mainz, 0.65 for opponents.\\n\\nWolves, meanwhile, have pulled 25 points from 18 matches (1.39 per match). They're eighth in the Premier League, three points from the top five. They have been the anti-Mainz: They've yet to score a transition goal this season, and they've allowed only one. These clubs have produced nearly identical results with approaches that couldn't be more different.\\n\\nManchester City, led by the likes of Kevin de Bruyne, are among the best at quick transition play, which is key to their dominance.Â Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Offside via Getty Images\\n\\nAnother example: [Napoli](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=114) and [Atalanta](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=105).\\n\\nNapoli has 39 points in Serie A play, Atalanta 38. Napoli's possession rate is 58%, highest in the league, while Atalanta's is 56%, fourth-highest. But Napoli matches have featured just five combined transition goals this season (three for, two against), while Atalanta matches have featured 25 (16 for, nine against). Statistics from these transition moments belie your manager's philosophy more than possession rate or perhaps anything else in the analytics arsenal.\",\"timestamp\":1640307126,\"title\":\"Great transition teams\"},\"digest\":\"a47urmjIdh5y2a5TLCnUoNSh6wuI4MiIZ837OJQnlv8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x05E6F6037c439515Ef8411bA07eeF761C7904fA8\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4HVf9KgSYMuZZAI9biLLTh2p2g21nznyPw5yfNpGYDg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3u3Ey8lwWWF26Jc8HyNjSZ4YDB51KqwjJGxHLsN2VYY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"7TgpiZCf7Nz1Nz4bBIO4JKkQpsEYgL7i0tYWwRyzTqudYLuHeGZaJ1xyz4yMaxd14187x9NsruoJ-umaTjglXg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x7f3e8837b39675f98685b276e721d6c2e64fb9fdf8244d2ef9381e688e512dc5475f766dcc5fad08fd50396cda0a09ab008021c3f0034a23d6006f337b3abf711c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4HVf9KgSYMuZZAI9biLLTh2p2g21nznyPw5yfNpGYDg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3u3Ey8lwWWF26Jc8HyNjSZ4YDB51KqwjJGxHLsN2VYY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"a47urmjIdh5y2a5TLCnUoNSh6wuI4MiIZ837OJQnlv8\"}"
