Users can deposit their yield bearing tokens (such as stETH) which Tempus splits into tokenized principal and yield tokens. Those primitives can then be traded against each other through the custom Balancer v2 AMM. Tempus will offer capital-efficient fixed rate yields and high variable yields on various assets. For example, Tempus will be the first team to release fixed-rate ETH 2.0 staking through Lido. Tempus will also integrate Compound, Aave and Yearn.\\n\\n[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6gauHECShr) | [Github](https://github.com/tempus-finance) | [Medium](https://medium.com/@tempusfinance) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tempusfinance) | [Website](https://tempus.finance/)\\n\",\"timestamp\":1635972061,\"title\":\"Introducing the Tempus Sers Ambassador Program - tempus - Medium\"},\"digest\":\"UUc4bcbHA8Oz8AA38y_j2HDPgt9H72KuEsRdcipSqSI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xE6045502603ab01690A5e41F94aC64Ab704E8F9f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"sgp80f_wVw2ExEV0KUurmCHC7QKx0pYFOivyYiR-crQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"g3JDecu2Np5eu0Tvc1FAVN4DWJVnCwV_YOQtNvibwvU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"_x4jLsJQTe3-5Ms_40Qhgy2ICp2xdpf16nSypS47IZ1hT3P27vZp3h4HYNS8NGAhtuSNvaKOMNxJd_6Tm4P8Wg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd5c6ce420883bdda072375c0c4711d49bf87bec592116a16b9b4d4f18c512c682106abeecfb380c15fe29fcc52615044ba08cd25ddd2e7905665e74044a7a2651b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"sgp80f_wVw2ExEV0KUurmCHC7QKx0pYFOivyYiR-crQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"g3JDecu2Np5eu0Tvc1FAVN4DWJVnCwV_YOQtNvibwvU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"UUc4bcbHA8Oz8AA38y_j2HDPgt9H72KuEsRdcipSqSI\"}"
