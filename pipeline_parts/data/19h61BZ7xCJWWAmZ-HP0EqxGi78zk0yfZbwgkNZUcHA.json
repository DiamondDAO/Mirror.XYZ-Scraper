"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### 12th Oct 2021\\n\\nToday we received news that toadz are involved somehow and maybe responsible for beating up Wagmi-san, this all happened during my standard sleep period so I’m catching up with it all. I’m reposting these here as a way to preserve them for posterity.\\n\\nBelow is the work of @diamondhandz707 based on the collective musings and ramblings of the #grailed channel in the 10ktf discord, if this is new to you go to 10ktf.com and follow the link to the discord.\\n\\n![toadz in wagmi's shop](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tmeS-6EegNRj0FIOUUTz0.jpg?height=1152&width=2048)\\n\\nHere is the recap we have worked out in the ✨︱grailed︱検証済み channel from today’s 10/11 posts. If your holding 10ktf and haven't verified yet, please do that and join us in the chat. This is derived from our community chat in ✨︱grailed︱検証済み and has not been confirmed by 10ktf at this time. To join the grailed chat, if your holding 10ktf (bag or shoes), please go to verify and join us over there for more in depth conversations and theory work. I went through the daily chat and summarized the following information. Feel free to add or suggest edits. Thanks Frens!\\n\\nWagmi had a new visitor at the shop today - The TOADZ are here. Hide your stuff! (delist all 10ktf items & update metadata on OpenSea). BOSS_TOADZ has got to go. He is not a fren! Who is the BOSS_TOADZ? <https://opensea.io/BOSS_TOADZ> - The toad is a loan shark. I’ve heard he may be the sharkiest of loan sharks even… Don’t know there are any new collections about sharks but could be worth looking into?   BOSS_TOADZ is coming looking for your stuff. Delist it and update your metadata on all your bags, shoes & materials!\\n\\nRoadmap Incoming! No dates set. But we have seen many good things. Please see update from 10/10 by searching “10/10” using the discord search tool and read up on what we have to currently there but seeing shop sweeper talk about a Roadmap is exciting!\\n\\nWe are in a game. We are headed to level 2 of 6 levels. We know Beeple, Figge and Wenew are connected to 10KTF. We also know Beeple and Figge run a digital marketing & services agency called Wenew. Wenew, LV, Beeple and Figge are working together on LOUIS THE GAME (an app you can play right now. This tells us infrastructure is built).\\n\\nSomething we can work on I think - We have verified this and yet we don’t have many people here. This is a project unlike any else where we will see weekly value if we continue to do the work. The community is the most important part of this game we are in but we expect this to extend to meta verse, and eventual physicals (real nice LV bags. Nike shoes, cool arts and possible Wenew moments or exclusive access to some of the world renowned music artists they work with and possibly much more). Point here: If you want to get your friends in on some verified Beeple Figge Wenew floor level entry (you think it’s ever coming back down this low? I sure as fuck do not.) then you should tell them now. Don’t go crazy but lets try to get the word out organically where we can. Only do what feels right to you but we hold valuable information at this point. Understand that please.\\n\\nSake is ordered for the Dance Party on Thursday!!! Tune in if/when you can and be prepared to Shake Ya Ass… Watch Ya Self! lol\\n\\nThursday is also the 1 year anniversary of Beeple discovering NFT’s. We have heard speculation that he is releasing something with pax through ash. Keep an eye out for stuff frens. I think it will be a crazy day Thursday.\\n\\nBeeple posted 2 days ago and said “We’ve got a big project in the works that will be unveiled in the next few weeks…” We are a few weeks out from completing these levels I think. Not a coincidence he said \\\"we\\\" got a big project... Let’s keep working y’all!\\n\\nRadio was fire all day today. Really amazing mixes lately. I recommend everyone tune in when they can. Shoutout to the DJ's mixing it up over there, thanks frens!\\n\\nDid I say we speculate a snapshot incoming really soon as well? The rocketship is taking off! Diamond fucking hands for fucks sake… LFG frens!\",\"timestamp\":1634042827,\"title\":\"10ktf daily recap #2\"},\"digest\":\"TfgBzl7YJZSba7LNgYdgbM4qPp-706b_5U42_Rl3Qs0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x02ea16F0963FaAA66D9097AA066f69d5Cf07C521\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"X1-IrPdZgUMUgmXfluvd7R28YXRQYZT0LbQBYt-Lzlc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kL2to0V78pwWgbRGmRmt9VzwiffVJShKsBLS6G7UCyc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"cYh_il1HMEovcmRLHMjlYmd5BlyeigJljBW1k2hOuuP6AAZ2bkSVPtdhtEcQKEfzpKUFtJQjrpPIILPRfnBAuw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x859a3b41f561379fd888236b643df91602c63b21e0294f84dafa73b9680d945b0d44d5f090c7540bbf98802520c87c56dfefe7015a88340896f744383f5c7be41b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"X1-IrPdZgUMUgmXfluvd7R28YXRQYZT0LbQBYt-Lzlc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kL2to0V78pwWgbRGmRmt9VzwiffVJShKsBLS6G7UCyc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"QDCOT1HOzEcMUjzJYvQtOwdSWxemlO4FOqSmtuYUfmM\"}"
