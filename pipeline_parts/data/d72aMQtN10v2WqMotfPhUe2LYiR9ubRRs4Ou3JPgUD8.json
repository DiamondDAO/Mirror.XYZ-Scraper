"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Social networks are the place we share everything from baby photos to political opinions.  These network are our de-facto public squares and the culture they enable and incentivize has real-world implications that touch all of our lives.\\n\\n> “Ask yourself, what are we doing here as a species, for the most part, we're creating and consuming culture. The near term goal should be pretty obvious, we have to build a culture that is conducive to sanity.\\n>\\n> We need a culture that is at minimum compatible with our long term survival. And we have serious problems to solve.  Infrastructure, pandemic preparedness, climate change, cybersecurity, education, wealth inequality, our relationship with China.\\n>\\n> Wouldn't it be amazing to just get busy and sort this stuff out without all the animosity and conspiracy thinking and dogmatism and perverse incentives and everything else that makes sane policies and compromises impossible?”\\n>\\n> \\\\- [Sam Harris](https://www.samharris.org/) (Neuroscientist, Philosopher, Best Selling Author)\\n\\nThis quote resonates because most of us want to live in a culture that is conducive to sanity and compatible with our long term survival and most of us think everything else he says is pretty accurate too.  Good ideas, like this new way to think about culture, can change the world if given to the right minds and placed in the right network.\\n\\nAt Chaos we’re going to try to build that network.  Chaos is “an anonymous brainstorming network” (but that’s a mouthful so if you’ve got a better idea [Tweet at us](https://twitter.com/trychaos_ai).)\\n\\nThere are 2 important social mechanics that separate Chaos from social networks:\\n\\n1 - Every post is anonymous.  This means you can’t shoot the messenger, which is great for both the messenger and the message.  On Chaos you can’t destroy an idea by destroying the creator.  \\n\\n2 - There are no followers.  Your distribution and influence are driven by your positive contributions to the community.  Act in bad faith and no one will see what you have to say.  Contribute constructively and you can become an influential thought leader regardless of your current social network celebrity.\\n\\nOur mission is to unlock the power of collective intelligence.
