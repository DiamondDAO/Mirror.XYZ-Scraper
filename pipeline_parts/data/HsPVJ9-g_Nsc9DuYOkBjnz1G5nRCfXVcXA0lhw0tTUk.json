"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Mosh DAO\\n\\nThis project is a fork of [nouns.wtf](https://nouns.wtf/), but aims to position itself as a cross-chain NFT experiment that spans 3 EVM networks.\\n\\n## Mosh DAO's Mission\\n\\nWe believe in a multi chain future, where different chains co-exist to one another. We aim to be a first of its kind, cross-chain NFT project. Mosh aims to become a cross-chain symbol, bridging chains on different networks.\\n\\n## Story\\n\\nWe like the nouns, when we first saw it this summer - it was such an innovative project. However, the price of the Nouns are too high and rather exclusive for ordinary folks like us. Also, due to its nature, it is practically impossible for ordinary folks like us to participate in the governance… We thought we could do better!\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nMoshDAO will generate 1 NFT(=\\\"Mosh\\\") per day, on 3 EVM compatible networks, starting with Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Polygon.\\n\\n### A. Daily auctions -  Each day on all networks\\n\\nThis will be auctioned on the official [app.mosh.lol](https://app.mosh.lol/) website.  \\n All proceeds go to the Mosh DAO treasury.  \\n (Details to be announced soon…)\\n\\n### B. $MOSH Token Launch on Juicebox\\n\\nMoshDAO's governance token, $MOSH Token will be launched on [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money). $MOSH will be used to provide liquidity to the Mosh DAO, but also used as an overall to the Mosh ecosystem. (Proposal, Voting, Community-only meetups, etc.)\\n\\n### C. Mosh DAO governance\\n\\nDetails to be announced soon…\\n\\n## **Main points**\\n\\n* The mosh artwork is not public domain, but spin-offs will be encouraged on the Mosh Governance DAO.\\n* 1 mosh trustlessly auctioned every 24 hours forever, spanning 3 different networks.\\n* 100% of mosh auction proceeds are trustlessly sent to Mosh DAO treasury.\\n* Mosh treasury will be controlled by governance in the Mosh DAO.\\n* Founder of MoshDAO,  \\\"Moshers\\\" receives rewards in the form of Mosh NFT. (10% of supply for the first 5 years)\\n\\n## **Daily Mosh Auctions**\\n\\nWe will generate one mosh, every day, forever on a multi-chain. All proceeds will directly go to the Mosh DAO Treasury. Every 10th Mosh will go directly to the \\\"Moshers\\\" founder's wallet. (for the first 5 years)\\n\\n## **Mosh DAO**\\n\\nMosh DAO will be governed on [gov.mosh.lol](https://gov.mosh.lol), through [snapshot.org](http://snapshot.org) protocol.\\n(To be announced soon as well…)\\n\\n## **Mosh Traits**\\n\\nYou can randomly see the generated mosh images on [art.mosh.lol](https://art.mosh.lol).\\n\\n## Mosh Links\\n\\n* [Art](https://art.mosh.lol/)\\n* [Documentation](https://moshdao.notion.site/FAQ-ddf44e6e65a3408cb97cf95a709742ff)\\n* [FAQ](https://moshdao.notion.site/FAQ-ddf44e6e65a3408cb97cf95a709742ff)\\n\\n## \\\"Moshers\\\" Rewards\\n\\n\\\"Moshers\\\" are the 3 founders that founded MoshDAO.
