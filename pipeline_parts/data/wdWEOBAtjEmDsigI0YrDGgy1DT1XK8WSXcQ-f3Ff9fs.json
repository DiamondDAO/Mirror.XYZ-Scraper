"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Abstract: Apprecio.finance (AF)\\n\\nAF is a decentralized inflation dashboard powered by IPFS, Filecoin, and Chainlink. Its main objective is to resist censorship and provide an alternative to centralized measures such as those that come from Central Banks and national statistical agencies. AF implements decentralization at three different times in its design. (1) Price data is obtained from more than six different sources (in the Mexican case), independent of the government, which prevents the failure or manipulation of any source from significantly affecting the inflation calculation. (2) Data is automatically stored off-chain using the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), for data to be distributed across multiple off-chain nodes, and Filecoin, for data permanence and availability at any time. (3) Aggregate prices and inflation rate are stored on the chain, Ethereum Mainnet, using Chainlink. The last two steps would also allow the data to be cryptographically signed twice. The inflation rate is updated daily on apprecio.finance and any user can request the inflation rate on-chain using Chainlink.\\n\\n## Introduction: Whoever Causes the Problem Cannot Be Trusted to Measure it\\n\\nThe inspiration for AF came from the August 5, 2021, [1729 Newsletter](https://1729.com/inflation), famously sponsored by Bajali Srinivasan (@[balajis](https://twitter.com/balajis)):\\n\\n> “Inflation is a [monetary phenomenon](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781119205814.app2), a function of money printing. But it is also in part a social phenomenon, a function of mass psychology. If enough of the right people believe that inflation is going to happen, it will. As such, when inflation is happening, there is often a push to *censor* discussion of inflation itself, under the grounds that discussing the problem actually causes it in the first place. That is exactly what happened in [Argentina](https://qz.com/84838/argentines-are-now-allowed-to-know-the-real-rate-of-inflation-thanks-to-their-courts/) and [Venezuela](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2015/04/04/maduros-muzzle) over the last decade \\\\[…\\\\] And that is why the world needs a global, decentralized, censorship-resistant inflation dashboard.\\n>\\n> Why do we need an inflation dashboard? Because trillions of dollars have been [printed](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-the-feds-balance-sheet-is-expected-to-top-9-trillion-after-it-starts-reducing-its-monthly-asset-purchases-11626135642) over the last year – and it's not just dollars. Many countries besides the US have been printing fiat like mad to fund the response to COVID. Figures that shocked and stunned ten years ago ([$787B](https://www.politico.com/story/2009/02/senate-passes-787-billion-stimulus-bill-018837) for the bailout!) no longer warrant a headline today, though they may well result in headlines tomorrow.\\n>\\n> If inflation is a government-caused problem, we can't necessarily rely on government statistics like the [CPI](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/) to diagnose it or remediate it. Indeed, in places with high inflation, censorship and denial is the rule rather than the exception.”\\n\\nAs of November 2021, AF is implemented only for Mexico, which faces its biggest inflationary crisis in 20 years at an annual inflation rate of almost 7% per year ([Forbes, November 2021](https://www.forbes.com.mx/economia-inflacion-de-mexico-en-noviembre-podria-rebasar-el-7-muy-grave-banxico/)). However, plans exist to extend the data sources to the United States and Brazil in the following months.\\n\\n![Source: Made using INEGI data.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cyF6TxnlWakydgOMqpsAy.png?height=575&width=796)\\n\\n## AF Design\\n\\nTo achieve the greatest possible resistance to censorship, AF implements decentralization at three different times in its design.\\n\\n1. Price data is obtained from more than six different sources (in the Mexican case), independent of the government, which prevents the failure or manipulation of any source from significantly affecting the inflation calculation.\\n2. Data is automatically stored off-chain using the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), for data to be distributed across multiple off-chain nodes, and Filecoin, for data permanence and availability at any time.\\n3. Aggregate prices and inflation rate are stored on the chain, Ethereum Mainnet, using Chainlink. The last two steps would also allow the data to be cryptographically signed twice.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EMk40cDbf2tzipavrSDgN.png?height=3295&width=1428)\\n\\n### Data Recollection\\n\\nThis step is crucial in maintaining decentralization. If the manipulation of the data source by a third party is able to significantly alter the measurement of AF’s inflation rate then the goal of censorship resistance would be compromised.\\n\\nThus for the Mexican case, our first measure, data is obtained from two different kinds of sources.\\n\\n1.  Small vendors (*tienditas*). Trough the Apprecio app.\\n2. Medium and big vendors. Trough web scrapping.\\n\\n### Data Recollection: Small vendors (tienditas)\\n\\nAF is unique in that it leverages a privilege but required data source such as that coming from small vendors.\\n\\nIn Latin America, these sellers are recurrent. About [700k ](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/mundo-empresa/2021/11/18/hablemos-del-valor-de-las-tienditas-en-mexico-y-que-podemos-hacer-por-ellas/)*[tienditas ](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/mundo-empresa/2021/11/18/hablemos-del-valor-de-las-tienditas-en-mexico-y-que-podemos-hacer-por-ellas/)*exist in Mexico and generate 1% of the GDP. Not taking into account this data source would greatly bias the inflation estimation. However, obtaining data from these sources is a grassroots activity. No database exists that tracks prices in these relevant units.\\n\\nWe leverage the Mexican fintech [Apprecio](https://apprecio.mx) work with more than 8k *tienditas* from all the Mexican Republic. Among other financial and strategic services, Apprecio helps small vendors calculate ideal prices for their products. For this, they require the units to upload the prices at which they offer their products. This data is later used by AF to calculate inflation.\\n\\n![Apprecio.mx homepage](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uOeqO6vxKHhDs_fHvFMlc.png?height=803&width=1666)\\n\\nThis source is decentralized. Data is, by November 2021, coming from at least 1,000 different units and the number is growing. Failure in one unit to report precise data would not affect the overall median price of the good and thus any calculation done with the prices.\\n\\n### Data Recollection: Medium to Big Vendors \\n\\nPrices from [Walmart](https://www.walmart.com.mx/), [La Comer](https://www.lacomer.com.mx/lacomer/) and [Soriana](https://www.soriana.com/supermercado.html) are includede to further decentralize the data sources. AF scrappes their online stores websites. At least two additional sources are planned to be included: [Costco](https://www.costco.com.mx/) and [Sam’s Club](https://www.sams.com.mx/).\\n\\nThese sources provide the security of the constant presence of at least a price for any period. The main challenge comes from updating and mainting proper scrappers that can repeteadly beat these sources webpages. The [1729 Newsletter](https://1729.com/inflation) mentions several issues of depending on scrappers for obtaining price data, among them: dealing with automated countermeasures, maintaining the web crawler, and parsing hard-to-determine units. AF faced this issues yet was \\n\\nAs proposed by the same 1729 post, a next step would be an strategic alliance with Oxxo in order to access their huge price dataset. Oxxo has a [50% share](https://www.google.com/search?q=oxxo+el+mayor+tienda+de+conveniencia&newwindow=1&sxsrf=AOaemvIL0wTIbFwj880wKA7-UtK0Px5CRA:1637890727141&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjjyOK38rT0AhVjk2oFHQzNAqcQ_AUoA3oECAMQBQ&biw=1490&bih=762&dpr=1.25) of the convenience store market and 14 million Mexicans buy something from it each day (for more information, review the ‘[FEMSA: The Most Interesting Company in Mexico](https://www.notboring.co/p/femsa)’ post by Packy McCormick). This would entail the challenge providing incentives to one of the biggest corporations in Latin America.\\n\\n![Extract from the ''‘FEMSA: The Most Interesting Company in Mexico\\\" post by Packy McCormick.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YstKDXcDctthJTPlS8LD-.png?height=623&width=709)\\n\\n### Decentralized storage off-chain\\n\\nFor AF to be a successful tool to openly measure inflation, it requires to be available for audit (1) at any time and (2) as cheaply as possible.\\n\\nStorage has at least three requirements for AF:\\n\\n1. Raw price data should be auditable. Currently the storage of raw data is done off-chain due to gas prices. A next step would be for AF to move to an Ethereum L2 and be able to store raw data on-chain. This could also be done with a service as Immutable.\\n2. Data should be stored decentrally. A central server means consolidation of control on the data. Even off-chain, due to point 1, this should be achieved.\\n\\nAF achieves both requirements by storing the raw price data off-chain using [IFPS](https://ipfs.io/). The entire price dataset is partitioned into smaller chunks, cryptographically hashed, and given a **unique fingerprint** called a [content identifier](https://proto.school/anatomy-of-a-cid) (CID). The dataset would be stored in at least one node, local server anywhere in the world. Using the CID, other nodes can ask for the data and themselve would cached the data locally. This would increase the decentralization of the dataset off-chain.\\n\\nThe data should always be online and available for direct request. “While IPFS guarantees that any content on the network is discoverable, it doesn't guarantee that any content is persistently available. This is where [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) comes in \\\\[…\\\\] a decentralized storage network in which storage providers rent their storage space to clients.” ([IPFS documentation](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/persistence/#pinning-services)). AF uses Filecoin so that price data is always available while maintaining its decentralization. The dataset would be pinned in at least one node.\\n\\nThe [Web3.Storage](https://web3.storage/) solution allows AF to automatically (1) store the dataset in IPFS and backed it with Filecoin; and (2) replicate price data across a network of storage providers and verify its integrity.\\n\\nThis solution allows for the data to be persistent, available, and decentralized even off-chain. The next layer of decentralization will come from making data available on-chain.\\n\\n### On-chain Storage and Availability\\n\\nRaw off-chain data from available sources is aggregated to obtain the median value of the prices, leading to a single price per item to be taken into account in the inflation calculation. AF calculates inflation, off-chain, using the [CalculateInflation.py](http://CalculateInflation.py) function in AF’s GitHub repository. The calculation is done off-chain to save gas. However, the next step is to allow any user to request a chain calculation.\\n\\nAF uses [Chainlink](https://chain.link/) to bring off-chain data to the Ethereum Mainnet, adding an additional layer of decentralization. Chainlink is a decentralized Oracle network that cryptographically signs and delivers data on-chain. Currently, any user can request (1) the current inflation rate; and (2) the aggregate prices of each of the items in the inflation calculation.\\n\\n## Inflation Calculation\\n\\n## The Future of AF\\n\\nThree main points appear on the AF roadmap:\\n\\n1. **Coverage extended to new countries.** The next would be the United States and Brazil. Requests from other economies are appreciated.\\n2. **Possible migration to full chain storage.** With the development of new Ethereum L2 rollups like Starknet and services like Immutable X, it's cheaper than ever to chain data. This would allow users to request and integrate AF data into their smart contracts inexpensively.\\n3. **Adding new data sources.** The more good quality data sources AF uses, the more decentralized and secure the inflation rate will be. In Mexico, AF is already implementing data from small vendors (*tienditas*) and retailers.\",\"timestamp\":1637891318,\"title\":\"Apprecio.Finance - Decentralized On-Chain Inflation Dashboard (v1)\"},\"digest\":\"5blmImxTZGEcPV_4CwmyKOr7MkXVtWyWZgQm2HM1mJ4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xC606d7ea8fE2c134CC35874Bf05EEB76f6371F44\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Q-xx-StMMZOKJPBqJ1F7NISKpeAvov0klxsb1CqR7So\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JdyVX__aiOYj5zEYItX8hPEXlWIIIOn1gxLt0nUw9-M\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"wN-8LTBNXAdpCGw9zoc7dzJtrFZCfIU1ynBLhWwKsob0zXLTr-ymJwVR_gXTensg2dSIz53ZT-xz0nHaGwJcww\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd54dc228145f076c0b1546a8acc65f0b00533bbe1d4685a0255c4840c0fc9c2834a0686567909f7a99b5cc275fe36961ef2d7f3437632fc6b89dc8ff9c188a321b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Q-xx-StMMZOKJPBqJ1F7NISKpeAvov0klxsb1CqR7So\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JdyVX__aiOYj5zEYItX8hPEXlWIIIOn1gxLt0nUw9-M\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"GeYEoRFxF-HSaZr78pjeAx-3yTvcpAH7yd64bgL7ajI\"}"
