"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"During the last couple of months, I have done a lot of different researches for my life project I am getting more and more passionate about. As most of you might know I am getting overtime into the different DeFi assets and have done quite some money with it. But - whatâ€™s even more important and interesting are the different usabilities the projects in Web3 have.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GwfSk4sTnKr8aSxmbtmUy.gif?height=216&width=500)\\n\\nLately, I am configuring for myself the different methods needed to properly and sustainably investigate different NFT, Coin projects. This is what [Centanos.com](https://centanos.com) will as well solve. We will work on a tool to get access to data that you can use to create your own charts to analyze such projects from the Web3 space.\\n\\nThe [Centanos.com](https://centanos.com) team will build therefore the hub of how the future of banking will work by numbers. We will provide millions of data sets to get you access to all data. You do not need to be a developer to understand how banking works, you just need to read numbers we gathered together for you. We are super happy to launch this very very soonish!\\n\\n[Powers of Ten](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/916189489217564722/919964951374889000/giphy_4.mp4?height=216&width=500&autoplay=true&loop=true&muted=true)\\n\\n## What is my conclusion?\\n\\nFor me personally, it is crystal clear. We need more people around the world to analyze the world of tomorrow or have it a bit easier to read through these ideas. Kids need to understand the future of future banking, lending, or the possibilities different projects can have for a better future.\\n\\nI was always addicted to data, when I come to school everyone was fascinated by why and how I could calculate that good in my head. To be honest, I had done this so often before - I loved calculating in my head and explaining systems by numbers (as they do not lie) instead of with words. That is why I believe so much in Centanos, one of its kind and it will 100% form the future on how you all will understand and explain the DeFi, NFT, and Coin world in the future.\\n\\nJoin our [waitlist](https://centanos.com) here and our [Discord](https://discord.gg/AvbN3JqRxC).\\n\\n[Centanos](https://www.centanos.com/)\",\"timestamp\":1639496836,\"title\":\"The future of DeFi Data...\"},\"digest\":\"3Os-cVG9TYDigEanfnZ_fPC38IEGp2nw1_Y4bzH8Tj0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x728DC4d981b6EFF36C71bFE8ca678cE442f3e2a3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"T6ZdtHf5bnbYqLYav76YqJxIC4xzAQJbyDsPHHgHDUA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"OT2SJ4ezmMBwunfT6i1qGVW79mnzqh5HdZ2TRQY5ErU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Ub9E57mfon29EhQDbe-an5NR20snmkszMCMetIfZyAnkCGRsVLs1Le_LOx5kfQDZwJ9p__BQHfc0Ki9zAWsu0w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5387b6751c860062ff8c88d4ea3bab50e60d99f5cb7bbc735475a9550984087439b6af18a02452d9d75a456e4383edf3090e816295e72a82c714c6bda57548bd1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"T6ZdtHf5bnbYqLYav76YqJxIC4xzAQJbyDsPHHgHDUA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"OT2SJ4ezmMBwunfT6i1qGVW79mnzqh5HdZ2TRQY5ErU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Yf-wO7sThjUNoo3R0_JyPkpf6F0SihPxN1CJeArxKXQ\"}"
