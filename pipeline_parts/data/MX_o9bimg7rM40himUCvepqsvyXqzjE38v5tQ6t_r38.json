He started making music as a solo act in 2018 with his first single ‚ÄúLove Like This‚Äù. Aged 20, he is currently in his final year of studies at the University of Essex, in Colchester, England. Currently, he's working on his ‚ÄúBad Mood‚Äù trilogy. He wishes to release the sequel to the first ‚ÄúBad Mood‚Äù in the first quarter of 2021. He also wishes to release the final EP in the final quarter of the same year. During his hiatus, Na-Ku took up producing and now hopes to be heavily involved in the production of his music. He hopes to be recognised as one of the best currently making music.\\n\\n**How would you best describe your creative process?**\\n\\nMy process goes either one of two ways, either I make myself record, like doin any other task, or it‚Äôs spontaneous. The spontaneity is divided into two as well, it‚Äôs either a build up of spontaneous energy or a (huge) burst of energy. If I‚Äôm recording, cuz I don‚Äôt normally time myself I‚Äôd say it takes a night, usually. If I‚Äôm writing, it could take at least a night or at most a couple weeks dependin on how I‚Äôm feelin. I write before I record if my intention isn‚Äôt to record a demo.\\n\\n### Most frequently received (advice related) question?\\n\\nFunny enough, no one asks me for advice bout anything. I don‚Äôt know if I should be insulted, thinkin bout it now, but, yeah, no one asks me shit.\\n\\n### Top 3 tools/resources you use to create\\n\\nApple Music, Soundcloud, and my whole set up. Out of my set up tho, my booth. Apple Music cuz I like listenin to my fav songs/verses/hooks to really get into writing/recording. Soundcloud for the ones that aren‚Äôt on streaming platforms. My booth cuz I be makin music in my room (I stay in a student accom) so I need my vocals to be as crisp as possible.\\n\\n### Thoughts on¬†self education/learning?\\n\\nAt this point isn‚Äôt this normal? Speakin personally, most of the things that I have knowledge on, I learnt on my own. Regardless of if it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm interested in or not. Even with higher education, which I hate, more time I be teachin myself. It‚Äôs great tho, learning skills, then workin on and ultimately perfecting them to the best of your ability.\\\\*\\\\*¬†\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n### Source(s) of inspiration?\\n\\nBro, me being the way I am, almost anything I like inspires me. Music, anime, movies, musicians, passionate people. Anything I fuck with inspires me, shit like anime theme songs. It might sound silly but it‚Äôs true, and it‚Äôs great.\\n\\n### Most creative time of the¬†day for¬†you?\\n\\nNight time, jus cuz that‚Äôs when I be getting work done cuz usually I be puttin shit off till late.\\n\\n### Who is one person you'd really love to work with but you haven't ?\\n\\nSanti/Cruel Santino, I know his government too but if I say it I‚Äôd be overdoin it. It‚Äôs A LOT of people I wanna work with, man, but he‚Äôs number one.\\n\\n### What are your thoughts on empathy?\\n\\nAt first I thought this was a weird question but I realised a lot of people don‚Äôt know how empathy works. I don‚Äôt know if people think this is a skill everyone should have but I don‚Äôt think so. For a lot of people don‚Äôt have/live the same or similar experiences, how can you then understand what you‚Äôve never experienced?\\n\\n### What do you believe is the best pathway to financial stability as a creative?\\n\\nI personally believe it‚Äôs having a great team, when you have that, you and your pockets are only goin up and stayin there.\\n\\n### How did the lockdown affect your creativity? and if there were any setbacks how did you overcome it?\\n\\nDuring lockdown, I was away from my place so I couldn‚Äôt record anything, that was a real pain. Still wantin to make music I bought FL studio and started learning music production. I‚Äôm still learning the ropes, can‚Äôt lie, but I‚Äôve made a couple of things that I can‚Äôt wait to put out. I‚Äôm grateful for the time that lockdown provided me with, ain‚Äôt nothin really like bettering yourself and your craft.\\n\\n### Any¬†plans for the future? (What should we expect for 2021)\\n\\nWorkin on ending my trilogy. I‚Äôve planned a lot of other releases too, hopefully everything falls into place.\\n\\nYou can follow Na-Ku on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/badmoodtears/) and¬†[Twitter](http://twitter.com/BadMoodTears).
