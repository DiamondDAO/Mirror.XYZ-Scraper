"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The first thing to note is that Liquity is different from many other borrowing and over-collateralized stablecoin protocols:\\n\\n● 1. Its core token LQTY has no governance function\\n\\n● 2. After the user mortgages ETH and lends LUSD, there is no interest\\n\\nTherefore, the only use of LQTY is to capture the casting fee and redemption fee of the agreement.\\n\\nAgain, minting refers to the process by which users mortgage ETH to obtain LUSD; redemption means that any user can use LUSD to exchange ETH from the user with the lowest mortgage rate at any time at the price of 1USD. The costs incurred in these two processes are casting fees and redemption fees, and these two costs are dynamic.\\n\\nSpecifically, the casting fee and redemption fee will be adjusted according to the time period and redemption amount of each redemption. Simply put, when the system is not redeemed, the casting fee and redemption fee will be reduced (the minimum is 0.5 %), if the redemption amount increases, the fee will increase accordingly. Because redemption is essentially a user arbitrage behavior, that is to say, only when LUSD is less than 1 USD, there will be redemption demand in the market for arbitrage, which is very rare in normal times.\\n\\nThis means that when Liquity's system runs smoothly, users have less minting behavior, and LUSD is not launched, and there is no arbitrage space, the income of LQTY holders will be relatively small.\\n\\nTherefore, LQTY benefits from the liquidity expansion caused by the transition of the market cycle. When the system remains stable, it can capture very little system revenue.\\n\\nRegulatory risk\\n\\nThe degree of human intervention in the Liquity protocol is very small, and its parameters are either fixed or controlled by algorithms. This also means that even if it is completely out of human control, it can maintain a relatively good self-operation without requiring a lot of governance work to advance (except for the expansion of token usage scenarios and other business and market work). From this perspective, the agreement is more resistant to censorship and less likely to receive administrative intervention.\",\"timestamp\":1634580086,\"title\":\"Liquity's token value capture\"},\"digest\":\"pfwY3tP9VUBhZeo-fuUJqSMzwxZysWXPe2CE7QZpjgY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4aE66AA2598A131cDE3Fbc815443b9A829e46c22\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zydXKiY7WQ5VIXxPAgFlj8RQd2vrcqI0_TjERAHlSdE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zwRdlePwK95aKFonUAdkCZA6jDf5mk3Po82xrDH8RfQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"SQxnZy3ygYylc9tc1Yysuy93bn5KNPwm3VSrr8omQdPNYkU7mIP4v0BQyokP0eDmTbnDHuSvfcpjChxk-M6Zkg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xeb204a70a71c093bdd6f4d31cb957ee3ea2f8e7b939fc435e3a3d2d65a7e0043146ee4cd257958d454de054cc6430333166db923409fa25d82de0e8d190984371c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zydXKiY7WQ5VIXxPAgFlj8RQd2vrcqI0_TjERAHlSdE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zwRdlePwK95aKFonUAdkCZA6jDf5mk3Po82xrDH8RfQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"pfwY3tP9VUBhZeo-fuUJqSMzwxZysWXPe2CE7QZpjgY\"}"
