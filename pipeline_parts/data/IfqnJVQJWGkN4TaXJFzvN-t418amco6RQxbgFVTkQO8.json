"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"at the rock on which Edinburgh Castle stands, Their observations sank indelibly into my memory, and gave me the key to the origin of this grand class of terrestrial phenomena.  When standing at the \\\"Giant's Ribs,\\\" on the south side of Arthur's Seat, I felt as if one of the grandest pages of the earth's history lay open before me. The evidences of similar volcanic action abound in many other places near Edinburgh; and they may be traced right across Scotland from the Bass Rock to Fingal's Cave, the Giant's Causeway in Antrim, and Slievh League on the south-west coast of Donegal in Ireland.\\n\\nVolcanic action, in some inconceivably remote period of the earth's crust history, has been the Plough, and after denudation by water, has been the Harrow, by which the originally deep-seated mineral treasures of the globe have been brought within the reach of man's industrial efforts.  It has thus yielded him inexhaustible mineral harvests, and helped him to some of the most important material elements in his progress towards civilisation.  It is from this consideration that, while enjoying the results of these grand fundamental actions of the Creator's mighty agencies in their picturesque aspect, the knowledge of their useful results to man adds vastly to the grandeur of the contemplation of their aspect and nature. This great subject caused me, even at this early period of my life, to behold with special interest the first peep at the structure of the moon's surface, as revealed to me by an excellent Ramsden \\\"spy-glass,\\\" which my father possessed, and thus planted the seed of that earnest desire to scrutinise more minutely the moon's wonderful surface, which in after years I pursued by means of the powerful reflecting telescopes constructed by myself.\\n\\nTo turn to another subject.  In 1822 the loyalty of Scotland was greatly excited when George the Fourth paid his well-known visit to Edinburgh.  It was then the second greatest city in the kingdom, and had not been visited by royalty for about 170 years.  The civic authorities, and the inhabitants generally, exerted themselves to the utmost to give the king a cordial welcome, in spite of a certain feeling of dissatisfaction as to his personal character.  The recent trial and death of Queen Caroline had not been forgotten, yet all such recollections were suppressed in the earnest desire to show every respect to the royal visitor.  Edinburgh was crowded with people from all parts of the country; heather was arrayed on every bonnet and hat; and the reception was on the whole magnificent.  Perhaps the most impressive spectacle was the orderliness of the multitude, all arrayed in their Sunday clothes.  The streets, windows; and house-tops were crowded; and the Calton Hill, Salisbury Crags, and even Arthur's Seat it self, were covered with people.  On the night before the arrival a gigantic bonfire on Arthur's Seat lit up with a tremendous blaze the whole city, as well as the surrounding country.  It formed a magnificent and picturesque sight, illuminating the adjacent mountains as well as the prominent features of the city.  It made one imagine that the grand old volcanic mountain had once more, after a rest of some hundreds of thousands of years, burst out again in its former vehemence of eruptive activity.\\n\\nThere were, of course, many very distinguished men who took part in the pageant of the king's entry into Edinburgh, but none of them had their presence more cordially acknowledged than Sir Walter Scott, who never felt more proud of \\\"his own romantic town\\\" than he did upon this occasion.  It is unnecessary to mention the many interesting features of the royal reception.  The king's visit lasted for seven or eight days, and everything passed off loyally, orderly, happily, and successfully.\\n\\nShortly after this time there was a great deal of distress among the labouring classes.  All the manufacturing towns were short of employment, and the weavers and factory workers were thrown upon the public.  Many of the workmen thought that politics were the causes of their suffering.  Radical clubs were formed, and the Glasgow weavers began to drill at nights in the hopes of setting things to rights by means of physical force.  A large number of the starving weavers came to Edinburgh.  A committee was formed, and contributions were collected, for the purpose of giving them temporary employment. They were set to work to make roads and walks round the Calton Hill and Crags.  The fine walk immediately under the precipitous crags, which opens out such perfect panoramic views of Edinburgh, was made by these poor fellows.  It was hard work for their delicate hands and fingers, which before had been accustomed only to deal with threads and soft fabrics.  They were very badly suited for handling the mattock, shovel, and hand-barrow.  The result of their labours, however, proved of great advantage to Edinburgh in opening up the beauties of its scenery. The road round the crags is still called \\\"The Radical Road.\\\"\\n\\nLet me here mention one of the most memorable incidents of the year 1824.  I refer to the destructive fire which took place in the old town of Edinburgh.  It broke out in an apartment situated in one of the highest piles of houses in the High Street.  In spite of every effort of the firemen the entire pile was gutted and destroyed.  The fire was thought to be effectually arrested; but towards the afternoon of the next day smoke was observed issuing from the upper part of the steeple of the Tron Church.  The  steeple was built of timber, covered with lead.  There is never smoke but there is fire; and at last the flames burst forth.  The height of the spire was so lofty that all attempts to extinguish the fire were hopeless.  The lead was soon melted, and rushed in streams into the street below.  At length the whole steeple fell down with a frightful crash.\\n\\nI happened to see the first outbreak of this extraordinary fire, and I watched its progress to its close.  Burning embers were carried by the wind and communicated the fire to neighbouring houses.  The last outburst took place one night about ten.  All the fire-engines of Edinburgh and the neighbourhood were collected round the buildings, and played water upon the flames, but without effect.  Whole ranges of lofty old houses were roaring with fire.  In the course of two or three hours, several acres, covered by the loftiest and most densely crowded houses in the High Street, were in a blaze.  Some of them were of thirteen stories.  Floor after floor came crashing down, throwing out a blaze of embers.  The walls of each house acted as an enormous chimney --the windows acting as draught-holes.  The walls, under the intense heat, were fluxed and melted into a sort of glass.  The only method of stopping the progress of the fire was to pull down the neighbouring houses, so as to isolate the remaining parts of the High Street.\\n\\nAs the parapet of the grand old tower of the High Church, St. Giles, was near the site of the fire,--so near as to enable one to look down into it,--my father obtained permission to ascend, and I with him. When we emerged from the long dark spiral stairs on to the platform on the top of the tower, we found a select party of the most distinguished inhabitants looking down into the vast area of fire; and prominent among them was Sir Walter Scott.  At last, after three days of tremendous efforts, the fire was subdued; but not till after a terrible destruction of property.  The great height of the ruined remains of the piles of houses rendered it impossible to have them removed by the ordinary means.  After several fruitless attempts with chains and ropes, worked by capstans, to pull them down, gunpowder was at last resorted to.  Mines were dug under each vast pile; one or two barrels of gunpowder were placed into them and fired; and then the before solid masses came tumbling down amidst clouds of dust.  The management of this hazardous but eventually safe process was conducted by Captain Basil Ball.  He ordered a crew of sailors to be brought up from the man-of-war guardship in the Firth of Forth; and by their united efforts the destruction of the ruined walls was at last successfully accomplished.\\n\\nIn the autumn of 1823, when I was fifteen years old, I had a most delightful journey with my father.  It was the first occasion on which I had been a considerable distance from home.  And yet the journey was only to Stirling.  My father had received a commission to paint a view of the castle as seen from the ruins of Cambuskenneth Abbey, situated a few miles from the town.  We started from Newhaven by a small steamboat, passing, on our way up the Firth, Queensferry, Culross, and Alloa. We then entered the windings of the river, from which I saw the Ochils, a noble range of bright green mountains.  The passage of the steamer through the turns and windings of the Forth was most interesting.\\n\\nWe arrived at Stirling, and at once proceeded to Cambuskenneth Abbey, where there was a noble old Gothic tower.  This formed the foreground of my father's careful sketch, with Stirling Castle in the background, and Ben Lomond with many other of the Highland mountains in the distance.  As my father wished to make a model of the Gothic tower, he desired me to draw it carefully, and to take the dimensions of all the chief parts as well as to make detailed sketches of its minor architectural features.  It was a delightful autumn afternoon, and, before the day had closed, our work at the abbey was done.  We returned to Stirling and took a walk round the castle to see the effect of the sun setting behind the Highland mountains.\\n\\nNext morning we visited the castle.  I was much interested with the interior, especially with a beautifully decorated Gothic oratory or private chapel, used by the Scottish kings when they resided at Stirling.  The oratory had been converted with great taste into an ante-drawingroom of the governor's house.  The exquisite decorations of this chapel\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... This exquisite specimen of a carved oak Gothic apartment had a terrible incident in Scottish history connected with it.  It was in this place that The Douglas intruded his presence on James the Third.  He urged his demands in a violent and threatening manner, and afterwards laid hands upon the king.  The latter, in defending himself with his dagger, wounded the Douglas mortally; and to get rid of the body the king cast it out of the window of the chapel, where it fell down the precipitous rock underneath.  The chapel has since been destroyed by fire.  ...\\\\] were the first specimens of Gothic carving in oak that I had ever seen, and they seemed to put our modern carvings to shame.  The Great Hall, where the Scottish Parliament used to meet, was also very interesting as connected with the ancient history of the country.\\n\\nFrom Stirling we walked to Alloa, passing the picturesque cascades rushing down the cleft's of the Ochils.  We put up for the night at Clackmannan, a very decayed and melancholy-looking village, though it possessed a fine specimen of the Scottish castellated tower.  It is said that Robert Bruce slept here before the Battle of Bannockburn. But the most interesting thing that I saw during the journey was the Devon Ironworks.  I had read and heard about the processes carried on there in smelting iron ore and running it into pig-iron.  The origin of the familiar trade term \\\"pig-iron\\\" is derived from the result of the arrangement most suitable for distributing the molten iron as it rushes forth from the opening made at the bottom part of the blast-furnace; when, after its reduction from the ore, it collects in a fluid mass of several tons weight.  Previous to \\\"tapping\\\" the furnace a great central channel is made in the sand-covered floor of the forge; this central channel is then subdivided into many lateral branches or canals, into which the molten iron flows, and eventually hardens.\\n\\nThe great steam-engine that worked the blast furnace was the largest I had ever seen.  A singular expedient was employed at these works, of using a vast vault hewn in the solid rock of the hillside for the purpose of storing up the blast produced by the engines, and so equalising the pressure; thus turning a mountain side into a reservoir for the use of a blast-furnace.  This seemed to me a daring and wonderful engineering feat.\\n\\nWe waited at the works until the usual time had arrived for letting out the molten iron which had been accumulating at the lower part of the blast-furnace.  It was a fine sight to see the stream of white-hot iron flowing like water into the large gutter immediately before the opening.  From this the molten iron flowed on until it filled the moulds of sand which branched off from the central gutter.  The iron left in the centre, when cooled and broken up, was called sow metal, while that in the branches was called pig iron; the terms being derived from the appearance of a sow engaged in its maternal duties. The pig-iron is thus cast in handy-sized pieces for the purpose of being transported to other iron foundries; while the clumsy sow metal is broken up and passes through another process of melting, or is reserved for foundry uses at the works where it is produced. After inspecting with great pleasure the machinery connected with the foundry, we took our leave and returned to Edinburgh by steamer from Alloa.\\n\\nShortly after, I had the good fortune to make the acquaintance of Robert Bald, the well-known mining engineer.  He was one of the most kind-hearted men I have ever known.  He was always ready to communicate his knowledge to young and old.  His sound judgment and long practical experience in regard to coal-mining and the various machinery connected with it, rendered him a man of great importance in the northern counties, where his advice was eagerly sought for. Besides his special knowledge, he had a large acquaintance with literature and science. He was bright, lively, and energetic.  He was a living record of good stories, and in every circle in which he moved he was the focus of cheerfulness.  In fact, there was no greater social favourite in Edinburgh than Robert Bald.\\n\\nBald was very fond of young people, and he became much attached to me. He used to come to my father's house, and often came in to see what I was about in the work-room.  He was rejoiced to see the earnest and industrious manner in which I was employed, in preparing myself for my proposed business as an engineer.  He looked over my tools, mostly of my own making, and gave me every encouragement.  When he had any visitors he usually brought them and introduced them to me.  In this way I had the happiness to make the acquaintance of Robert Napier, Nelson, and Cook, of Glasgow; and in after life I continued to enjoy their friendship.  It would be difficult for me to detail the acts of true disinterested kindness which I continued to receive from this admirable man.\\n\\nOn several occasions he wished me to accompany him on his business journeys, in order that I might see some works that would supply me with valuable information.  He had designed a powerful pumping engine to drain more effectually a large colliery district situated near Bannockburn--close to the site of the great battle in the time of Robert the Bruce.  He invited me to join him.  It was with the greatest pleasure that I accepted his invitation; for there would be not only the pleasure of seeing a noble piece of steam machinery brought into action for the first time, but also the enjoyment of visiting the celebrated Carron Ironworks.\\n\\nThe Carron Ironworks are classic ground to engineers.  They are associated with the memory of Roebuck, Watt, and Miller of Dalswinton. For there Roebuck and Watt began the first working steam-engine; Miller applied the steam-engine to the purposes of navigation, and invented the Carronade gun.  The works existed at an early period in the history of British iron manufacture.  Much of the machinery continued to be of wood.  Although effective in a general way it was monstrously cumbrous. It gave the idea of vast power and capability of resistance, while it was far from being so in reality. It was, however, truly imposing and impressive in its effect upon strangers.  When seen partially lit up by the glowing masses of white-hot iron, with only the rays of bright sunshine gleaming through a few holes in the roof, and the dark, black, smoky vaults in which the cumbrous machinery was heard rumbling away in the distance--while the moving parts were dimly seen through the murky atmosphere, mixed with the sounds of escaping steam and rushes of water; with the half-naked men darting about with masses of red-hot iron and ladles full of molten cast-iron--it made a powerful impression upon the mind.\\n\\nI was afterwards greatly interested by a collection of old armour, dug up from the field of the Battle of Bannockburn close at hand. They were arranged on the walls of the house of the manager of the Carron Ironworks.  There were swords, daggers, lances, battle-axes, shields, and coats of chain-armour.  Some of the latter were whole, others in fragmentary portions.  I was particularly interested with the admirable workmanship of the coats of mail.  The iron links extended from the covering of the head to the end of the arms, and from the shoulders down to the hips, in one linked iron fabric.  The beauty and exactness with which this chain-armour had been forged and built up were truly wonderful.  There must have been \\\"giants in those days.\\\"  This grand style of armour was in use from the time of the Conquest, and was most effective in the way of protection, as it was fitted by its flexibility to give full play to the energetic action of the wearer.  It was infinitely superior to the senseless plate-armour that was used, at a subsequent period, to encase soldiers like lobsters.  The chain-armour I saw at Carron left a deep impression on my mind.  I never see a bit of it, or of its representation in the figures on our grand tombs of the thirteenth century, but I think of my first sight of it at Carron and of the tremendous conflict at Bannockburn.\\n\\nRemembering, also, the impressive sight of the picturesque fire-lit halls, and the terrible-looking, cumbrous machinery which I first beheld on a grand scale at Carron, I have often regretted that some of our artists do not follow up the example set them by that admirable painter, Wright of Derby, and treat us to the pictures of some of our great ironworks.  They not only abound with the elements of the picturesque in its highest sense, but also set forth the glory of the useful arts in such a way as would worthily call forth the highest power of our artists.\\n\\nTo return to my life at Edinburgh.  I was now seventeen years old. I had acquired a considerable amount of practical knowledge as to the use and handling of mechanical tools, and I desired to turn it to some account.  I was able to construct working models of steam-engines and other apparatus required for the illustration of mechanical subjects. I began with making a small working steam engine for the purpose of grinding the oil-colours used by my father in his artistic work. The result was quite satisfactory.  Many persons came to see my active little steam-engine at work, and they were so pleased with it that I received several orders for small workshop engines, and also for some models of steam-engines to illustrate the subjects taught at Mechanics' Institutions.\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  Sectional model of condensing steam-engine.  By James Nasmyth\\n\\nI contrived a sectional model of a complete condensing steam-engine of the beam and parallel motion construction.  The model, as seen from one side, exhibited every external detail in full and due action when the flywheel was moved round by hand; while, on the other or sectional side, every detail of the interior was seen, with the steam-valves and air-pump, as well as the motion of the piston in the cylinder, with the construction of the piston and the stuffing box, together with the slide-valve and steam passages, all in due position and relative movement.\\n\\nThe first of these sectional models of the steam-engine was made for the Edinburgh School of Arts, where its uses in instructing mechanics and others in the application of steam were highly appreciated. The second was made for Professor Leslie, of the Edinburgh University, for use in his lectures on Natural Philosophy.  The professor had, at his own private cost, provided a complete and excellent set of apparatus, which, for excellent workmanship and admirable utility, had never, I believe, been provided for the service of any university. He was so pleased with my addition to his class-room apparatus, that, besides expressing his great thanks for my services, he most handsomely presented me with a free ticket to his Natural Philosophy class as a regular student, so long as it suited me to make use of his instruction. But far beyond this, as a reward for my earnest endeavours to satisfy this truly great philosopher, was the kindly manner in which he on all occasions communicated to me conversationally his original and masterly views on the great fundamental principles of Natural Philosophy-- especially as regarded the principles of Dynamics and the Philosophy of Mechanics. The clear views which he communicated in his conversation, as well as in his admirable lectures, vividly illustrated by the experiments which he had originated, proved of great advantage to me; and I had every reason to consider his friendship and his teaching as amongst the most important elements in my future success as a practical engineer.\\n\\nHaving referred to the Edinburgh School of Arts, I feel it necessary to say something about the origin of that excellent institution. A committee of the most distinguished citizens of Edinburgh was formed for the purpose of instituting a college in which working men and mechanics might possess the advantages of instruction in the principles on which their various occupations were conducted.  Among the committee were Leonard Horner, Francis Jeffrey, Henry Cockburn, John Murray of Henderland, Alexander Bryson, James Mline, John Miller, the Lord Provost, and various members of the Council.  Their efforts succeeded, and the institution was founded.  The classes were opened in 1821, in which year I became a student.\\n\\nIn order to supply the students, who were chiefly young men of the working class, with sound instruction in the various branches of science, the lectures were delivered and the classes were superintended by men of established ability in their several departments. This course was regularly pursued from its fundamental and elementary principles to the highest point of scientific instruction. The consecutive lectures and examinations extended, as in the University, from October to May in each year's session.  It was, in fact, our first technical college.  In these later days when so many of our so-called Mechanics' Institutes are merely cheap reading-clubs for the middle classes, and the lectures are delivered for the most part merely for a pleasant evening' s amusement, it seems to me that we have greatly departed from the original design with which Mechanics' Institutions were founded.\\n\\nAs the Edinburgh School of Arts was intended for the benefit of mechanics, the lectures and classes were held in the evening after the day's work was over.  The lectures on chemistry were given by Dr. Fyfe --an excellent man.  His clearness of style, his successful experiments, and the careful and graphic method by which he carried his students from the first fundamental principles to the highest points of chemical science, attracted a crowded and attentive audience.  Not less interesting were the lectures on Mechanical Philosophy, which in my time were delivered by Dr. Lees and Mr.Buchanan.  The class of Geometry and Mathematics was equally well conducted, though the attendance was not so great.\\n\\nThe building which the directors had secured for the lecture-hall and class-rooms of the institution was situated at the lower end of Niddry Street, nearly under the great arch of the South Bridge.  It had been built about a hundred years before, and was formerly used by an association of amateur musicians, who gave periodical concerts of vocal and instrumental music.  The orchestra was now converted into a noble lecture table, with accommodation for any amount of apparatus that might be required for the purposes of illustration.  The seats were arranged in the body of the hall in concentric segments, with the lecture table as their centre.  In an alcove fight opposite the lecturer might often be seen the directors of the institution-- Jeffrey, Horner, Murray, and others--who took every opportunity of dignifying by their presence this noble gathering of earnest and intelligent working men.\\n\\nA library of scientific books was soon added to the institution, by purchases or by gifts.  Such was the eagerness to have a chance of getting the book you wanted that I remember standing on many occasions for some time amidst a number of applicants awaiting the opening of the door on an evening library night.  It was as crowded as if I had been standing at the gallery door of the theatre on a night when some distinguished star from London was about to make his appearance. There was the same eagerness to get a good place in the lecture-room, as near to the lecture table as possible, especially on the chemistry nights.\\n\\nI continued my regular attendance at this admirable institution from 1821 to 1826.  I am glad to find that it still continues in active operation.  In November 1880 the number of students attending the Edinburgh School of Arts amounted to two thousand five hundred!  I have been led to this prolix account of the beginning of the institution by the feeling that I owe a deep debt of gratitude to it, and because of the instructive and intellectually enjoyable evenings which I spent there, in fitting myself for entering upon the practical work of my life.\\n\\nThe successful establishment of the Edinburgh School of Arts had a considerable effect throughout the country.  Similar institutions were established, lectures were delivered, and the necessary illustrations were acquired--above all, the working models of the steam-engine. There was quite a run upon me for supplying them.  My third working model was made to the order of Robert Bald, for the purpose of being presented to the Alloa Mechanics' Institute; the fourth was manufactured for Mr. G. Buchanan, who lectured on mechanical subjects throughout the country; and the fifth was supplied to a Mr. Offley, an English gentleman who took a fancy for the model when he came to purchase some of my father's works.\\n\\nThe price I charged for my models was #10; and with the pecuniary results I made over one-third to my father, as a sort of help to remunerate him for my \\\"keep,\\\" and with the rest I purchased tickets of admission to certain classes in the University.  I attended the Chemistry course under Dr. Hope; the Geometry and Mathematical course under Professor Wallace; and the Natural Philosophy course under my valued friend and patron Professor Leslie.  What with my attendance upon the classes, and my workshop and drawing occupations, my time did not hang at all heavy on my hands.\",\"timestamp\":1639288675,\"title\":\"\\nI had often the privilege of standing by and hearing the philosophic Leslie, Brewster, and Hall, \"},\"digest\":\"_tW0DpY7SCO-JN1LQOepgiwzAMQAjH0MhTioVc9P4Ww\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x667E6054E728f4dC76df3f0F3c9c6bf23c751e8a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RBAvhhVteWjtlh_DeHY1st9dEW73VrUARSqQvFvRZAw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"nUTpM5wdzQYeCJIM1k8L6VfJ5q0FXyHHmXPkumYteBI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"N97O2heDP_wUcXICiM4HkVkwn_MkzDIqKXL7QQ3XBiWXwLZdCbUf2PVF5izF8wt4bA8bYdFo0Th9oa6IeJH_sg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xee639ee169bb017135bced43f62c772735fbc8582cd1496631a0061bf99d614a029f7c229113b1e05f264c81e0c27bf74a528d9e930897259129ac137930d0541c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RBAvhhVteWjtlh_DeHY1st9dEW73VrUARSqQvFvRZAw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"nUTpM5wdzQYeCJIM1k8L6VfJ5q0FXyHHmXPkumYteBI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"_tW0DpY7SCO-JN1LQOepgiwzAMQAjH0MhTioVc9P4Ww\"}"
