"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"He had thought much about the journey before he made it. No doubt the door had been slammed in his face in London. He felt quite conscious of that, and conscious also that a man should not renew his attempt to enter a door when it has been once slammed in his face. But he understood the circumstances nearly as they had happened -- except that he was not aware how far the door had been slammed by Lady Tringle without any concurrence on the part of Sir Thomas. But the door had, at any rate, not been slammed by Lucy. The only person he had really wished to see within that house had been Lucy Dormer; and he had hitherto no reason for supposing that she would be unwilling to receive him. Her face had been sweet and gracious when she saw him in the Park. Was he to deny himself all hope of any future intercourse with her because Lady Tringle had chosen to despise him? He must make some attempt. It was more than probable, no doubt, that this attempt would be futile. The servant at Glenbogie would probably be as well instructed as the servant in Queen's Gate. But still a man has to go on and do something, if he means to do anything. There could be no good in sitting up at Drumcaller, at one side of the lake, and thinking of Lucy Dormer far away, at the other side. He had not at all made up his mind that he would ask Lucy to be his wife. His professional income was still poor, and she, as he was aware, had nothing. But he felt it to be incumbent upon him to get nearer to her if it were possible, and to say something to her if the privilege of speech should be accorded to him.\\n\\nHe walked down to Callerfoot, refusing the loan of the Colonel's pony carriage, and thence had himself carried across the lake in a hired boat to a place called Sandy's Quay. That, he was assured, was the spot on the other side from whence the nearest road would be found to Glenbogie. But nobody on the Callerfoot side could tell him what would be the distance. At Sandy's Quay he was assured that it was twelve miles to Glenbogie House; but he soon found that the man who told him had a pony for hire. \\\"Ye'll nae get there under twalve mile -- or maybe saxteen, if ye attampt to walk up the glin.\\\" So said the owner of the pony. But milder information came to him speedily. A little boy would show him the way up the glen for sixpence, and engage to bring him to the house in an hour and a half. So he started with the little boy, and after a hot scramble for about two hours he found himself within the demesne. Poking their way up through thick bushes from a ravine, they showed their two heads -- first the boy and then the sculptor -- close by the side of the private road -- just as Sir Thomas was passing, mounted on his cob. \\\"It's his ain sell,\\\" said the boy, dropping his head again amongst the bushes.\\n\\nHamel, when he had made good his footing, had first to turn round so that the lad might not lose his wages. A dirty little hand came up for the sixpence, but the head never appeared again. It was well known in the neighbourhood -- especially at Sandy's Quay, where boats were used to land -- that Sir Thomas was not partial to visitors who made their way into Glenbogie by any but the authorised road. While Hamel was paying his debt, he stood still on his steed waiting to see who might be the trespasser. \\\"That's not a high road,\\\" said Sir Thomas, as the young man approached him. As the last quarter of an hour from the bottom of the ravine had been occupied in very stiff climbing among the rocks the information conveyed appeared to Hamel to have been almost unnecessary. \\\"Your way up to the house, if you are going there, would have been through the lodge down there.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps you are Sir Thomas Tringle,\\\" said Hamel.\\n\\n\\\"That is my name.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then I have to ask your pardon for my mode of ingress. I am going up to the house; but having crossed the lake from Callerfoot I did not know my way on this side, and so I have clambered up the ravine.\\\" Sir Thomas bowed, and then waited for further tidings. \\\"I believe Miss Dormer is at the house?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My niece is there.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My name is Hamel -- Isadore Hamel. I am a sculptor, and used to be acquainted with her father. I have had great kindness from the whole family, and so I was going to call upon her. If you do not object, I will go on to the house.\\\"\\n\\nSir Thomas sat upon his horse speechless for a minute. He had to consider whether he did not object or not. He was well aware that his wife objected -- aware also that he had declined to coincide with his wife's objection when it had been pressed upon him. Why should not his niece have the advantage of a lover, if a proper sort of a lover came in her way? As to the father's morals or the son's birth, those matters to Sir Thomas were nothing. The young man, he was told, was good at making busts. Would anyone buy the busts when they were made? That was the question. His wife would certainly be prejudiced -- would think it necessary to reject for Lucy any suitor she would reject for her own girls. And then, as Sir Thomas felt, she had not shown great judgment in selecting suitors for her own girls. \\\"Oh, Mr Hamel, are you?\\\" he said at last.\\n\\n\\\"Isadore Hamel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You called at Queen's Gate once, not long ago?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I did,\\\" said Hamel; \\\"but saw no one.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, you didn't; I heard that. Well, you can go on to the house if you like, but you had better ask for Lady Tringle. After coming over from Callerfoot you'll want some lunch. Stop a moment. I don't mind if I ride back with you.\\\" And so the two started towards the house, and Hamel listened whilst Sir Thomas expatiated on the beauties of Glenbogie.\\n\\nThey had passed through one gate and were approaching another, when, away among the trees, there was a young lady seen walking alone. \\\"There is Miss Dormer,\\\" said Hamel; \\\"I suppose I may join her?\\\" Sir Thomas could not quite make up his mind whether the meeting was to be allowed or not, but he could not bring himself at the spur of the moment to refuse his sanction. So Hamel made his way across to Lucy, while Sir Thomas rode on alone to the house.\\n\\nLucy had seen her uncle on the cob, and, being accustomed to see him on the cob, knew of course who he was. She had also seen another man with him, but not in the least expecting that Hamel was in those parts, had never dreamt that he was her uncle's companion. It was not till Hamel was near to her that she understood that the man was coming to join herself; and then, when she did recognise the man, she was lost in amazement. \\\"You hardly expected to see me here?\\\" said he.\\n\\n\\\"Indeed; no.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nor did I expect that I should find you in this way.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My uncle knows it is you?\\\" asked Lucy.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes. I met him as I came up from the ravine, and he has asked me to go on to the house to lunch.\\\" Then there was silence for a few moments as they walked on together. \\\"I hope you do not think that I am persecuting you in making my way over here.\\\" \\\"Oh, no; not persecuting!\\\" Lucy when she heard the sound of what she herself had said, was angry with herself, feeling that she had almost declared him guilty of some wrong in having come thither. \\\"Of course I am glad to see you\\\", she added, \\\"for papa's sake, but I'm afraid -- \\\"\\n\\n\\\"Afraid of what, Miss Dormer?\\\"\\n\\nShe looked him full in the face as she answered him, collecting her courage to make the declaration which seemed to be necessary. \\\"My Aunt Emmeline does not want you to come.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why should she not want me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That I cannot tell. Perhaps if I did know I should not tell. But it is so. You called at Queen's Gate, and I know that you were not admitted, though I was at home. Of course, Aunt Emmeline has a right to choose who shall come. It is not as though I had a house of my own.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But Sir Thomas asked me in.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then you had better go in. After what Aunt Emmeline said, I do not think that you ought to remain with me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your uncle knows I am with you,\\\" said Hamel. Then they walked on towards the house together in silence for a while. \\\"Do you mean to say\\\", he continued, \\\"that because your aunt objects you are never to see me again?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hope I shall see you again. You were papa's friend, and I should be so very sorry not to see you again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I suppose\\\", he said, slowly, \\\"I can never be more than your papa's friend.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are mine also.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I would be more than that.\\\" Then he paused as if waiting for a reply, but she of course had none to make. \\\"I would be so much more than that, Lucy.\\\" Still she had no answer to give him. But there comes a time when no answer is as excellent eloquence as any words that can be spoken. Hamel, who had probably not thought much of this, was nevertheless at once informed by his instincts that it was so. \\\"Oh, Lucy,\\\" he said, \\\"if you can love me say so.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mr Hamel,\\\" she whispered.\\n\\n\\\"Lucy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mr Hamel, I told you about Aunt Emmeline. She will not allow it. I ought not to have let you speak to me like this, while I am staying here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But your uncle knows I am with you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My aunt does not know. We must go to the house. She expressly desired that I would not speak to you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you will obey her -- always?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No; not always. I did not say that I should obey her always. Some day, perhaps, I shall do as I think fit myself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And then you will speak to me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then I will speak to you,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"And love me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And love you,\\\" she answered, again looking him full in the face. \\\"But now pray, pray let us go on.\\\" For he had stopped her awhile amidst the trees, and had put out his hand as though to take hers, and had opened his arms as though he would embrace her. But she passed on quickly, and hardly answered his further questions till they found themselves together in the hall of the house. Then they met Lady Tringle, who was just passing into the room where the lunch was laid, and following her were Augusta, Gertrude, and the Honourable Septimus Traffick. For, though Frank Houston had found himself compelled to go at the day named, the Honourable Septimus had contrived to squeeze out another week. Augusta was indeed still not without hope that the paternal hospitality of Glenbogie might be prolonged till dear Merle Park should once again open her portals. Sir Thomas had already passed into the dining-room, having in a gruff voice informed his wife that he had invited Mr Hamel to come in to lunch. \\\"Mr Hamel!\\\" she had exclaimed. \\\"Yes, Mr Hamel. I could not see the man starving when he had come all this way. I don't know anything against him.\\\" Then he had turned away, and had gone into the dining-room, and was now standing with his back to the empty fireplace, determined to take Mr Hamel's part if any want of courtesy were shown to him.\\n\\nIt certainly was hard upon Lady Tringle. She frowned and was going to walk on without any acknowledgment, when Lucy timidly went through a form of introduction. \\\"Aunt Emmeline, this is Mr Hamel. Uncle Tom met him somewhere in the grounds and has asked him to come to luncheon.\\\" Then Lady Tringle curtseyed and made a bow. The curtsey and the bow together were sufficient to have crushed the heart of any young man who had not been comforted and exalted by such words as Isadore had heard from Lucy's lips not five minutes since. \\\"And love you,\\\" she had said. After that Lady Tringle might curtsey and bow as she would, and he could still live uncrushed. After the curtsey and the bow Lady Tringle passed on. Lucy fell into the rank behind Gertrude; and then Hamel afterwards took his place behind the Honourable Septimus. \\\"If you will sit there, Mr Hamel,\\\" said Lady Tringle, pointing to a chair, across the table, obliquely, at the greatest possible distance from that occupied by Lucy. There he was stationed between Mr Traffick and Sir Thomas. But now, in his present frame of mind, his position at the table made very little difference to him.\\n\\nThe lunch was eaten in grim silence. Sir Thomas was not a man profuse with conversation at his meals, and at this moment was ill-inclined for any words except what he might use in scolding his wife for being uncivil to his guest. Lady Tringle sat with her head erect, hardly opening her mouth sufficiently to allow the food to enter it. It was her purpose to show her displeasure at Mr Hamel, and she showed it. Augusta took her mother's part, thoroughly despising the two Dormer girls and any lover that they might have. Poor Gertrude had on that morning been violently persecuted by a lecture as to Frank Houston's impecuniosity. Lucy of course would not speak. The Honourable Septimus was anxious chiefly about his lunch -- somewhat anxious also to offend neither the master nor the mistress of Merle Park. Hamel made one or two little efforts to extract answers from Sir Thomas, but soon found that Sir Thomas would prefer to be left in silence. What did it signify to him? He had done all that he wanted, and much more than he had expected.\\n\\nThe rising and getting away from luncheon is always a difficulty -- so great a difficulty when there are guests that lunch should never be much a company festival. There is no provision for leaving the table as there is at dinner. But on this occasion Lady Tringle extemporised provision the first moment in which they had all ceased to eat. \\\"Mr Hamel,\\\" she said very loudly, \\\"would you like some cheese?\\\" Mr Hamel, with a little start, declared that he wanted no cheese. \\\"Then, my dears, I think we will go into my room. Lucy, will you come with me?\\\" Upon this the four ladies all went out in procession, but her ladyship was careful that Lucy should go first so that there might be no possibility of escape. Augusta and Gertrude followed her. The minds of all the four were somewhat perturbed; but among the four Lucy's heart was by far the lightest.\\n\\n\\\"Are you staying over with Stubbs at that cottage?\\\" asked the Honourable Septimus. \\\"A very queer fellow is Stubbs.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A very good fellow,\\\" said Hamel.\\n\\n\\\"I dare say. He hasn't got any shooting?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think not.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not a head. Glentower wouldn't let an acre of shooting over there for any money.\\\" This was the Earl of Glentower, to whom belonged an enormous tract of country on the other side of the lake. \\\"What on earth does he do with himself stuck up on the top of those rocks?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He does shoot sometimes, I believe, when Lord Glentower is there.\\\" \\\"That's a poor kind of fun, waiting to be asked for a day,\\\" said the Honourable Septimus, who rarely waited for anything till he was asked. \\\"Does he get any fishing?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He catches a few trout sometimes in the tarns above. But I fancy that Stubbs isn't much devoted to shooting and fishing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then what the d --  does he do with himself in such a country as this?\\\" Hamel shrugged his shoulders, not caring to say that what with walking, what with reading and writing, his friend could be as happy as the day was long in such a place as Drumcaller. \\\"Is he a Liberal?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A what?\\\" asked Hamel. \\\"Oh, a Liberal? Upon my word I don't know what he is. He is chiefly given to poetry, tobacco, and military matters.\\\" Then the Honourable Septimus turned up his nose in disgust, and ceased his cross-examination as to the character and pursuits of Colonel Jonathan Stubbs.\\n\\n\\\"Sir Thomas, I am very much obliged to you for your kindness,\\\" said Hamel, getting up suddenly. \\\"As it is a long way over to Drumcaller I think I will make a start. I know my way down the Glen and should be sure to miss it by any other route. Perhaps you'll let me go back as I came.\\\" Sir Thomas offered him the loan of a horse, but this was refused, and Hamel started on his return journey across the lake.\\n\\nWhen he had gone a few steps from the portal he turned to look at the house which contained one whom he now regarded as belonging exclusively to himself,; perhaps he thought that he might catch some final view of Lucy; or, not quite thinking it, fancied that some such chance might at least be possible; but he saw nothing but the uninteresting facade of the grand mansion. Lucy was employed quite otherwise. She was listening to a lecture in which her aunt was describing to her how very badly Mr Hamel had behaved in obtruding himself on the shades of Glenbogie. The lecture was somewhat long, as Aunt Emmeline found it necessary to repeat all the arguments which she had before used as to the miscreant's birth, as to his want of adequate means, and as to the general iniquities of the miscreant's father. All this she repeated more than once with an energy that was quite unusual to her. The flood of her eloquence was so great that Lucy found no moment for an interposing word till all these evils had been denunciated twice and thrice. But then she spoke. \\\"Aunt Emmeline,\\\" she said, \\\"I am engaged to Mr Hamel now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He has asked me to be his wife and I have promised.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And that after all that I had said to you!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Aunt Emmeline, I told you that I should not drop him. I did not bid him come here. Uncle Tom brought him. When I saw him I would have avoided him if I could. I told him he ought not to be here because you did not wish it; and then he answered that my uncle knew that he was with me. Of course when he told me that he -- loved me, I could not make him any other answer.\\\" Then Aunt Emmeline expressed the magnitude of her indignation simply by silence, and Lucy was left to think of her lover in solitude.\\n\\n\\\"And how have you fared on your day's journey?\\\" said the Colonel, when Hamel found him still seated on the platform with a book in his hand.\\n\\n\\\"Much better than I thought. Sir Thomas gave me luncheon.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And the young lady?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The young lady was gracious also; but I am afraid that I cannot carry my praises of the family at Glenbogie any further. The three Tringle ladies looked at me as I was sitting at table as though I certainly had no business in their august society.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER 20 STUBBS UPON MATRIMONY\\n\\nBefore that evening was over -- or in the course of the night, it might be better said, as the two men sat up late with their pipes -- Hamel told his friend the Colonel exactly what had taken place that morning over at Glenbogie. \\\"You went for the purpose, of course?\\\" asked the Colonel.\\n\\n\\\"For an off chance.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know that well enough. I never heard of a man's walking twelve miles to call upon a young lady merely because he knew her father; and when there was to be a second call within a few weeks, the first having not been taken in very good part by the young lady's friends, my inquiring mind told me that there was something more than old family friendship.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your inquiring mind saw into the truth.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And now looks forward to further events. Can she bake and can she brew?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do not doubt that she could if she tried.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And can she wash a shirt for a man? Don't suppose, my dear fellow, that I intend to say that your wife will have to wash yours. Washing a shirt, as read in the poem from which I am quoting, is presumed to be simply emblematic of household duties in general.\\\" \\\"I take all you say in good part -- as coming from a friend.\\\" \\\"I regard matrimony\\\", said the Colonel, \\\"as being altogether the happiest state of life for a man -- unless to be engaged to some lovely creature, in whom one can have perfect confidence, may be a thought happier. One can enjoy all the ecstatic mental reflection, all the delights of conceit which come from being loved, that feeling of superiority to all the world around which illumines the bosom of the favoured lover, without having to put one's hand into one's pocket, or having one's pipe put out either morally or physically. The next to this is matrimony itself, which is the only remedy for that consciousness of disreputable debauchery, a savour of which always clings, more or less strongly, to unmarried men in our rank of life. The chimes must be heard at midnight, let a young man be ever so well given to the proprieties, and he must have just a touch of the swingebuckler about him, or he will seem to himself to be deficient in virility. There is no getting out of it until a man marry. But then -- \\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well; then?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you know the man whose long-preserved hat is always brushed carefully, whose coat is the pattern of neatness, but still a little threadbare when you look at it -- in the colour of whose cheek there is still some touch of juvenility, but whose step is ever heavy and whose brow is always sad? The seriousness of life has pressed the smiles out of him. He has learned hardly to want anything for himself but outward decency and the common necessaries of life. Such little personal indulgences as are common to you and to me are as strange to him as ortolans or diamonds.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do not think I do know him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do -- well. I have seen him in the regiment, I have met him on the steps of a public office, I have watched him as he entered his parsonage house. You shall find him coming out of a lawyer's office, where he has sat for the last nine hours, having supported nature with two penny biscuits. He has always those few thin hairs over his forehead, he has always that well-brushed hat, he has always that load of care on his brow. He is generally thinking whether he shall endeavour to extend his credit with the butcher, or resolve that the supply of meat may be again curtailed without injury to the health of his five daughters.\\\" \\\"That is an ugly picture.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But is it true?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In some cases, of course, it is.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And yet not ugly all round,\\\" said the meditative Colonel, who had just replenished his pipe. \\\"There are, on the other side, the five daughters, and the partner of this load of cares. He knows it is well to have the five daughters, rather than to live with plenty of beef and mutton -- even with the ortolans if you will -- and with no one to care whether his body may be racked in this world or his spirit in the next. I do not say whether the balance of good or evil be on one side or the other; but when a man is going to do a thing he should know what it is he is going to do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The reading of all this,\\\" said Hamel, \\\"is, that if I succeed in marrying Miss Dormer I must have thin locks, and a bad hat, and a butcher's bill.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Other men do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Some, instead, have balances at their bankers, and die worth thirty, forty, or fifty thousand pounds, to the great consolation of the five daughters.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Or a hundred thousand pounds! There is, of course, no end to the amount of thousands which a successful professional man may accumulate. You may be the man; but the question is, whether you should not have reasonable ground to suppose yourself the man, before you encumber yourself with the five daughters.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It seems to me,\\\" said Hamel, \\\"that the need of such assurance is cowardly.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is just the question which I am always debating with myself. I also want to rid myself of that swingebuckler flavour. I feel that for me, like Adam, it is not good that I should be alone. I would fain ask the first girl, that I could love well enough to wish to make myself one with her, to be my wife, regardless of hats, butchers, and daughters. It is a plucky and a fine thing for a man to feel that he can make his back broad enough for all burdens. But yet what is the good of thinking that you can carry a sack of wheat when you are sure that you have not, in truth, strength to raise it from the ground?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Strength will come,\\\" said Hamel.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, and the bad hat. And, worse than the bad hat, the soiled gown; and perhaps with the soiled gown the altered heart -- and perhaps with the altered heart an absence of all that tenderness which it is a woman's special right to expect from a man.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should have thought you would have been the last to be so self-diffident.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To be so thoughtful, you mean,\\\" said the Colonel. \\\"I am unattached now, and having had no special duty for the last three months I have given myself over to thinking in a nasty morbid manner. It comes, I daresay, partly from tobacco. But there is comfort in this -- that no such reflections falling out of one man's mouth ever had the slightest effect in influencing another man's conduct.\\\"\\n\\nHamel had told his friend with great triumph of his engagement with Lucy Dormer, but the friend did not return the confidence by informing the sculptor that during the whole of this conversation, and for many days previous to it, his mind had been concerned with the image of Lucy's sister. He was aware that Ayala had been, as it were, turned out from her rich uncle's house, and given over to the comparative poverty of Kingsbury Crescent. He himself, at the present moment, was possessed of what might be considered a comfortable income for a bachelor. He had been accustomed to live almost more than comfortably; but, having so lived, was aware of himself that he had not adapted himself for straitened circumstances. In spite of that advice of his as to the brewing, baking, and washing capabilities of a female candidate for marriage, he knew himself well enough to be aware that a wife red with a face from a kitchen fire would be distasteful to him. He had often told himself that to look for a woman with money would be still more distasteful. Therefore he had thought that for the present, at least, it would be well for him to remain as he was. But now he had come across Ayala, and though in the pursuance of his philosophy he had assured himself that Ayala should be nothing to him, still he found himself so often reverting to this resolution that Ayala, instead of being nothing, was very much indeed to him.\\n\\nThree days after this Hamel was preparing himself for his departure immediately after breakfast. \\\"What a beast you are to go\\\", said the Colonel, \\\"when there can be no possible reason for your going.\\\" \\\"The five daughters and the bad hat make it necessary that a fellow should do a little work sometimes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why can't you make your images down here?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"With you for a model, and mud out of the Caller for clay.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I shouldn't have the slightest objection. In your art you cannot perpetuate the atrocity of my colour, as the fellow did who painted my portrait last winter. If you will go, go, and make busts at unheard-of prices, so that the five daughters may live for ever on the fat of the land. Can I do any good for you by going over to Glenbogie?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you could snub that Mr Traffick, who is of all men the most atrocious.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The power doesn't exist,\\\" said the Colonel, \\\"which could snub the Honourable Septimus. That man is possessed of a strength which I thoroughly envy -- which is perhaps more enviable than any other gift the gods can give. Words cannot penetrate that skin of his. Satire flows off him like water from a duck. Ridicule does not touch him. The fellest abuse does not succeed in inflicting the slightest wound. He has learnt the great secret that a man cannot be cut who will not be cut. As it is worth no man's while to protract an enmity with such a one as he, he suffers from no prolonged enmities. He walks unassailable by any darts, and is, I should say, the happiest man in London.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then I fear you can do nothing for me at Glenbogie. To mollify Aunt Emmeline would, I fear, be beyond your power. Sir Thomas, as far as I can see, does not require much mollifying.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sir Thomas might give the young woman a thousand or two.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is not the way in which I desire to keep a good hat on my head,\\\" said Hamel, as he seated himself in the little carriage which was to take him down to Callerfoot.\\n\\nThe Colonel remained at Drumcaller till the end of September, when his presence was required at Aldershot, during which time he shot a good deal, in obedience to the good-natured behests of Lord Glentower, and in spite of the up-turned nose of Mr Traffick. He read much, and smoked much, so that as to the passing of his time there was not need to pity him, and he consumed a portion of his spare hours in a correspondence with his aunt, the Marchesa, and with his cousin Nina. One of his letters from each shall be given, and also one of the letters written to each in reply. Nina to her cousin the Colonel\\n\\nMY DEAR JONATHAN,\\n\\nLady Albury says that you ought to be here, and so you ought. It is ever so nice. There is a Mr Ponsonby here, and he and I can beat any other couple at lawn tennis. There is an awning over the ground which is such a lounge. Playing lawn tennis with a parasol as those Melcombe girls did is stupid. They were here, but have gone. One I am quite sure was over head and ears in love with Mr Ponsonby. These sort of things are always all on one side, you know. He isn't very much of a man, but he does play lawn tennis divinely. Take it altogether, I don't think there is anything out to beat lawn tennis. I don't know about hunting -- and I don't suppose I ever shall.\\n\\nWe tried to have Ayala here, but I fear it will not come off. Lady Albury was good-natured, but at last she did not quite like writing to Mrs Dosett. So mamma wrote but the lady's answer was very stiff. She thought it better for Ayala to remain among her own friends. Poor Ayala! It is clear that a knight will be wanted to go in armour, and get her out of prison. I will leave it to you to say who must be the knight.\\n\\nI hope you will come for a day or two before you go to Aldershot. We stay till the 1st of October. You will be a beast if you don't. Lady Albury says she never means to ask you again. \\\"Oh, Stubbs!\\\" said Sir Harry; \\\"Stubbs is one of those fellows who never come if they're asked.\\\" Of course we all sat upon him. Then he declared that you were the dearest friend he had in the world, but that he never dared to dream that you would ever come to Stalham again. Perhaps if we can hit it off at last with Ayala, then you would come. Mamma means to try again.\\n\\nYour affectionate cousin,\\n\\nNINA\\n\\nThe Marchesa Baldoni to her nephew, Colonel Stubbs\\n\\nMY DEAR JONATHAN,\\n\\nI did my best for my protegee, but I am afraid it will not succeed. Her aunt Mrs Dosett seems to think that, as Ayala is fated to live with her, Ayala had better take her fate as she finds it. The meaning of that is, that if a girl is doomed to have a dull life she had better not begin it with a little pleasure. There is a good deal to be said for the argument, but if I were the girl I should like to begin with the pleasure and take my chance for the reaction. I should perhaps be vain enough to think that during the preliminary course I might solve all the difficulty by my beaux yeux. I saw Mrs Dosett once, and now I have had a letter from her. Upon the whole, I am inclined to pity poor Ayala. We are very happy here. The Marchese has gone to Como to look after some property he has there. Do not be ill-natured enough to say that the two things go together -- but in truth he is never comfortable out of Italy. He had a slice of red meat put before him the other day, and that decided him to start at once. On the first of October we go back to London, and shall remain till the end of November. They have asked Nina to come again in November in order that she may see a hunt. I know that means that she will try to jump over something, and have her leg broken. You must be here and not allow it. If she does come here I shall perhaps go down to Brighton for a fortnight.\\n\\nYes -- I do think Ayala Dormer is a very pretty girl, and I do think, also, that she is clever. I quite agree that she is ladylike. But I do not therefore think that she is just such a girl as such a man as Colonel Jonathan Stubbs ought to marry. She is one of those human beings who seem to have been removed out of this world and brought up in another. Though she knows ever so much that nobody else knows, she is ignorant of ever so much that everybody ought to know. Wandering through a grove, or seated by a brook, or shivering with you on the top of a mountain, she would be charming. I doubt whether she would be equally good at the top of your table, or looking after your children, or keeping the week's accounts. She would tease you with poetry, and not even pretend to be instructed when you told her how an army ought to be moved. I say nothing as to the fact that she hasn't got a penny, though you are just in that position which makes it necessary for a man to get some money with his wife. I therefore am altogether indisposed to any matrimonial outlook in that direction.\\n\\nYour affectionate aunt,\\n\\nBEATRICE BALDONI\\n\\nColonel Stubbs to his cousin Nina\\n\\nDEAR NINA,\\n\\nLady Albury is wrong; I ought not to be at Stalham. What should I do at Stalham at this time of year, who never shoot partridges, and what would be the use of attempting lawn tennis when I know I should be cut out by Mr Ponsonby? If that day in November is to come off then I'll come and coach you across the country. You tell Sir Harry that I say so, and that I will bring three horses for one week. I think it very hard about poor Ayala Dormer, but what can any knight do in such a case? When a young lady is handed over to the custody of an uncle or an aunt, she becomes that uncle's and aunt's individual property. Mrs Dosett may be the most noxious dragon that ever was created for the mortification and general misery of an imprisoned damsel, but still she is omnipotent. The only knight who can be of any service is one who will go with a ring in his hand, and absolutely carry the prisoner away by force of the marriage service. Your unfortunate cousin is so exclusively devoted to the duty of fighting his country's battles that he has not even time to think of a step so momentous as that.\\n\\nPoor Ayala! Do not be stupid enough to accuse me of pitying her because I cannot be the knight to release her; but I cannot but think how happy she would be at Stalham, struggling to beat you, and Mr Ponsonby at lawn tennis, and then risking a cropper when the happy days of November should come round.\\n\\nYour loving cousin,\\n\\nJ. S.\\n\\nColonel Stubbs to the Marchesa Baldoni\\n\\nMY DEAR AUNT,\\n\\nYour letter is worthy of the Queen of Sheba, if, as was no doubt the case, she corresponded with King Solomon. As for Ayala's fate, if it be her fate to live with Mrs Dosett, she can only submit to it. You cannot carry her over to Italy, nor would the Marchese allow her to divide his Italian good things with Nina. Poor little bird! She had her chance of living amidst diamonds and bank-notes, with the Tringle millionaires, but threw it away after some fashion that I do not understand. No doubt she was a fool, but I cannot but like her the better for it. I hardly think that a fortnight at Stalham, with all Sir Harry's luxuries around her, would do her much service.\\n\\nAs for myself and the top of my table, and the future companion who is to be doomed to listen to my military lucubrations, I am altogether inclined to agree with you, seeing that you write in a pure spirit of worldly good sense. No doubt the Queen of Sheba gave advice of the same sort to King Solomon. I never knew a woman to speak confidentially of matrimony otherwise than as a matter of pounds, shillings, and pence. In counsels so given, no word of love has ever been known to creep in. Why should it, seeing that love cannot put a leg of mutton into the pot? Don't imagine that I say this in a spirit either of censure or satire. Your ideas are my own, and should I ever marry I shall do so in strict accordance with your tenets, thinking altogether of the weekly accounts, and determined to eschew any sitting by the sides of brooks.\\n\\nI have told Nina about my plans. I will be at Stalham in November to see that she does not break her neck.\\n\\nYours always,\\n\\nJ. S.\\n\\nCHAPTER 21 AYALAXR'S INDIGNATION\\n\\nPerhaps Mrs Dosett had some just cause for refusing her sanction for the proposed visit to Albury. If Fate did require that Ayala should live permanently in Kingsbury Crescent, the gaiety of a very gay house, and the wealth of a very wealthy house, would hardly be good preparation for such a life. Up to the time of her going to the Marchesa in Brook Street, Ayala had certainly done her best to suit herself to her aunt's manners -- though she had done it with pain and suffering. She had hemmed the towels and mended the sheets and had made the rounds to the shops. She had endeavoured to attend to the pounds of meat and to sympathise with her aunt in the interest taken in the relics of the joints as they escaped from the hungry treatment of the two maidens in the kitchen. Ayala had been clever enough to understand that her aunt had been wounded by Lucy's indifference, not so much because she had desired to avail herself of Lucy's labours as from a feeling that that indifference had seemed to declare that her own pursuits were mean and vulgar. Understanding this she had struggled to make those pursuits her own -- and had in part succeeded. Her aunt could talk to her about the butter and the washing, matters as to which her lips had been closed in any conversation with Lucy. That Ayala was struggling Mrs Dosett had been aware -- but she had thought that such struggles were good and had not been hopeless. Then came the visit to Brook Street, and Ayala returned quite an altered young woman. It seemed as though she neither could nor would struggle any longer. \\\"I hate mutton bones,\\\" she said to her aunt one morning soon after her return.\\n\\n\\\"No doubt we would all like meat joints the best,\\\" said her aunt, frowning.\\n\\n\\\"I hate joints too.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have, I dare say, been cockered up at the Marchesa's with made dishes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hate dishes,\\\" said Ayala, petulantly.\\n\\n\\\"You don't hate eating?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I do. It is ignoble. Nature should have managed it differently. We ought to have sucked it in from the atmosphere through our fingers and hairs, as the trees do by their leaves. There should have been no butchers, and no grease, and no nasty smells from the kitchen -- and no gin.\\\"\\n\\nThis was worse than all -- this allusion to the mild but unfashionable stimulant to which Mr Dosett had been reduced by his good nature. \\\"You are flying in the face of the Creator, Miss,\\\" said Aunt Margaret, in her most angry voice -- \\\"in the face of the Creator who made everything, and ordained what His creatures should eat and drink by His infinite wisdom.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nevertheless,\\\" said Ayala, \\\"I think we might have done without boiled mutton.\\\" Then she turned to some articles of domestic needlework which were in her lap so as to show that in spite of the wickedness of her opinions she did not mean to be idle. But Mrs Dosett, in her wrath, snatched the work from her niece's hands and carried it out of the room, thus declaring that not even a pillowcase in her house should owe a stitch to the hands of a girl so ungrateful and so blasphemous.\\n\\nThe wrath wore off soon. Ayala, though not contrite was meek, and walked home with her aunt on the following morning, patiently carrying a pound of butter, six eggs, and a small lump of bacon in a basket. After that the pillowcase was recommitted to her. But there still was left evidence enough that the girl's mind had been upset by the luxuries of Brook Street -- evidence to which Aunt Margaret paid very much attention, insisting upon it in her colloquies with her husband. \\\"I think that a little amusement is good for young people,\\\" said Uncle Reginald, weakly. \\\"And for old people too. No doubt about it, if they can get it so as not to do them any harm at the same time. Nothing can be good for a young woman which unfits her for that state of life to which it has pleased God to call her. Ayala has to live with us. No doubt there was a struggle when she first came from your sister, Lady Tringle, but she made it gallantly, and I gave her great credit. She was just falling into a quiet mode of life when there came this invitation from the Marchesa Baldoni. Now she has come back quite an altered person, and the struggle has to be made all over again.\\\" Uncle Reginald again expressed his opinion that young people ought to have a little amusement, but he was not strong enough to insist very much upon his theory. It certainly, however, was true that Ayala, though she still struggled, had been very much disturbed by the visit.\\n\\nThen came the invitation to Stalham. There was a very pretty note from Lady Albury to Ayala herself, saying how much pleasure she would have in seeing Miss Dormer at her house, where Ayala's old friends the Marchesa and Nina were then staying. This was accompanied by a long letter from Nina herself, in which all the charms of Stalham, including Mr Ponsonby and lawn tennis, were set forth at full length. Ayala had already heard much about Stalham and the Alburys from her friend Nina, who had hinted in a whisper that such an invitation as this might perhaps be forthcoming. She was ready enough for the visit, having looked through her wardrobe, and resolved that things which had been good enough for Brook Street would still be good enough for Stalham. But the same post had brought a letter for Mrs Dosett, and Ayala could see, that, as the letter was read, a frown came upon her aunt's brow, and that the look on her aunt's face was decidedly averse to Stalham. This took place soon after breakfast, when Uncle Reginald had just started for his office, and neither of them for a while said a word to the other of the letter that had been received. It was not till after lunch that Ayala spoke. \\\"Aunt,\\\" she said, \\\"you have had a letter from Lady Albury?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Mrs Dosett, grimly, \\\"I have had a letter from Lady Albury.\\\"\\n\\nThen there was another silence, till Ayala, whose mind was full of promised delights, could not refrain herself longer. \\\"Aunt Margaret,\\\" she said, \\\"I hope you mean to let me go.\\\" For a minute or two there was no reply, and Ayala again pressed her question. \\\"Lady Albury wants me to go to Stalham.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She has written to me to say that she would receive you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And I may go?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am strongly of opinion that you had better not,\\\" said Mrs Dosett, confirming her decree by a nod which might have suited Jupiter.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Aunt Margaret, why not?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think it would be most prudent to decline.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But why -- why -- why, Aunt Margaret?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There must be expense.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have money enough for the journey left of my own from what Uncle Tom gave me,\\\" said Ayala, pleading her cause with all her eloquence.\\n\\n\\\"It is not only the money. There are other reasons -- very strong reasons.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What reasons, Aunt Margaret?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My dear, it is your lot to have to live with us, and not with such people as the Marchesa Baldoni and Lady Albury.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am sure I do not complain.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you would complain after having for a time been used to the luxuries of Albury Park. I do not say that as finding fault, Ayala. It is human nature that it should be so.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I won't complain. Have I ever complained?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, my dear. You told me the other day that you did not like bones of mutton, and you were disgusted because things were greasy. I do not say this by way of scolding you, Ayala, but only that you may understand what must be the effect of your going from such a house as this to such a house as Stalham, and then returning back from Stalham to such a house as this. You had better be contented with your position.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am contented with my position,\\\" sobbed Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"And allow me to write to Lady Albury refusing the invitation.\\\" But Ayala could not be brought to look at the matter with her aunt's eyes. When her aunt pressed her for an answer which should convey her consent she would give none, and at last left the room bitterly sobbing. Turning the matter over in her own bosom upstairs she determined to be mutinous. No doubt she owed a certain amount of obedience to her aunt; but had she not been obedient, had she not worked hard and lugged about that basket of provisions, and endeavoured to take an interest in all her aunt's concerns? Was she so absolutely the property of her aunt that she was bound to do everything her aunt desired to the utter annihilation of all her hopes, to the extermination of her promised joys? She felt that she had succeeded in Brook Street. She had met no Angel of Light, but she was associated with people whom she had liked, and had been talked to by those to whom it had been a pleasure to listen. That colonel with the quaint name and the ugly face was still present to her memory as he had leaned over her shoulder at the theatre, making her now laugh by his drollery, and now filling her mind with interest by his description of the scenes which she was seeing. She was sure that all this, or something of the same nature, would be renewed for her delight at Stalham. And was she to be robbed of this -- the only pleasure which seemed to regain to her in this world -- merely because her aunt chose to entertain severe notions as to duty and pleasure? Other girls went out when they were asked. At Rome, when that question of the dance at the Marchesa's had been discussed, she had had her own way in opposition to her Aunt Emmeline and her cousin Augusta. No doubt she had, in consequence partly of her conduct on that occasion, been turned out of her Uncle Tom's house; but of that she did not think at the present moment. She would be mutinous, and would appeal to her Uncle Reginald for assistance.\\n\\nBut the letter which contained the real invitation had been addressed to her aunt, and her aunt could in truth answer it as she pleased. The answer might at this moment be in the act of being written, and should it be averse Ayala knew very well that she could not go in opposition to it. And yet her aunt came to her in the afternoon consulting her again, quite unconquered as to her own opinion, but still evidently unwilling to write the fatal letter without Ayala's permission. Then Ayala assured herself that she had rights of her own, which her aunt did not care to contravene. \\\"I think I ought to be allowed to go,\\\" she said, when her aunt came to her during the afternoon.\\n\\n\\\"When I think it will be bad for you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It won't be bad. They are very good people. I think that I ought to be allowed to go.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have you no reliance on those who are your natural guardians?\\\" \\\"Uncle Reginald is my natural guardian,\\\" said Ayala, through her tears.\\n\\n\\\"Very well! If you refuse to be guided by me as though I were not your aunt, and as you will pay no attention to what I tell you is proper for you and best, the question must be left till your uncle comes home. I cannot but be very much hurt that you should think so little of me. I have always endeavoured to do the best I could for you, just as though I were your mother.\\\" \\\"I think that I ought to be allowed to go,\\\" repeated Ayala.\\n\\nAs the first consequence of this, the replies to all the three letters were delayed for the next day's post. Ayala had considered much with what pretty words she might best answer Lady Albury's kind note, and she had settled upon a form of words which she had felt to be very pretty. Unless her uncle would support her, that would be of no avail, and another form must be chosen. To Nina she would tell the whole truth, either how full of joy she was -- or else how cruelly used and how thoroughly broken-hearted. But she could not think that her uncle would be unkind to her. Her uncle had been uniformly gentle. Her uncle, when he should know how much her heart was set upon it, would surely let her go.\\n\\nThe poor girl, when she tacitly agreed that her uncle should be the arbiter in the matter, thus pledging herself to abide by her uncle's decision, let it be what it might, did not think what great advantage her aunt would have over her in that discussion which would be held upstairs while the master of the house was washing his hands before dinner. Nor did she know of how much stronger will was her Aunt Margaret than her Uncle Reginald. While he was washing his hands and putting on his slippers, the matter was settled in a manner quite destructive of poor Ayala's hopes. \\\"I won't have it,\\\" said Mrs Dosett, in reply to the old argument that young people ought to have some amusement. \\\"If I am to be responsible for the girl I must be allowed my own way with her. It is trouble enough, and very little thanks I get for it. Of course she hates me. Nevertheless, I can endeavour to do my duty, and I will. It is not thanks, nor love, nor even gratitude, that I look for. I am bound to do the best I can by her because she is your niece, and because she has no other real friends. I knew what would come of it when she went to that house in Brook Street. I was soft then and gave way. The girl has moped about like a miserable creature ever since. If I am not to have my own way now I will have done with her altogether.\\\" Having heard this very powerful speech, Uncle Reginald was obliged to give way, and it was settled that after dinner he should convey to Ayala the decision to which they had come.\\n\\nAyala, as she sat at the dinner-table, was all expectation, but she asked no question. She asked no question after dinner, while her uncle slowly, solemnly, and sadly sipped his one beaker of cold gin and water. He sipped it very slowly, no doubt because he was anxious to postpone the evil moment in which he must communicate her fate to his niece. But at last the melancholy glass was drained, and then, according to the custom of the family, Mrs Dosett led the way up into the drawing-room, followed by Ayala and her husband. He, when he was on the stairs, and when the eyes of his wife were not upon him, tremulously put out his hand and laid it on Ayala's shoulder, as though to embrace her. The poor girl knew well that mark of affection. There would have been no need for such embracing had the offered joys of Stalham been in store for her. The tears were already in her eyes when she seated herself in the drawing-room, as far removed as possible from the armchair which was occupied by her aunt.\\n\\nThen her uncle pronounced his judgment in a vacillating voice -- with a vacillation which was ineffectual of any good to Ayala. \\\"Ayala,\\\" he said, \\\"your aunt and I have been talking over this invitation to Stalham, and we are of opinion, my dear, that you had better not accept it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why not, Uncle Reginald?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There would be expense.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can pay for my own ticket.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There would be many expenses, which I need not explain to you more fully. The truth is, my dear, that poor people cannot afford to live with rich people, and had better not attempt it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't want to live with them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Visiting them is living with them for a time. I am sorry, Ayala, that we are not able to put you in a position in which you might enjoy more of the pleasures incidental to your age; but you must take the things as they are. Looking at the matter all round, I am sure that your aunt is right in advising that you should stay at home.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It isn't advice at all,\\\" said Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"Ayala!\\\" exclaimed her aunt, in a tone of indignation.\\n\\n\\\"It isn't advice,\\\" repeated Ayala. \\\"Of course, if you won't let me go, I can't.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are a very wicked girl,\\\" said Mrs Dosett, \\\"to speak to your uncle like that, after all that he has done for you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not wicked,\\\" said the uncle.\\n\\n\\\"I say, wicked. But it doesn't matter. I shall at once write to Lady Albury, as you desire, and of course there will be no further question as to her going.\\\" Soon after that Mrs Dosett sat down to her desk, and wrote that letter to which the Marchesa had alluded in hers to her nephew. No doubt it was stern and hard, and of a nature to make such a woman as the Marchesa feel that Mrs Dosett would not be a pleasant companion for a girl like Ayala. But it was written with a full conviction that duty required it; and the words, though hard and stiff, had been chosen with the purpose of showing that the doing of this disagreeable duty had been felt to be imperative.\\n\\nWhen the matter had been thus decided, Ayala soon retreated to her own room. Her very soul was burning with indignation at the tyranny to which she thought herself subjected. The use of that weak word, advice, had angered her more than anything. It had not been advice. It had not been given as advice. A command had been laid upon her, a most cruel and unjust command, which she was forced to obey, because she lacked the power of escaping from her condition of slavery. Advice, indeed! Advice is a thing with which the advised one may or may not comply, as that advised one may choose. A slave must obey an order! Her own papa and her own mamma had always advised her, and the advice had always been followed, even when read only in the glance of an eye, in a smile, or a nod. Then she had known what it was to be advised. Now she was ordered -- as slaves are ordered; and there was no escape from her slavery!\\n\\nShe, too, must write her letter, but there was no need now of that pretty studied phrase, in which she had hoped to thank Lady Albury fitly for her great kindness. She found, after a vain attempt or two, that it was hopeless to endeavour to write to Lady Albury. The words would not come to her pen. But she did write to Nina:\\n\\nDEAR, DEAREST NINA,\\n\\nThey won't let me go! Oh, my darling, I am so miserable! Why should they not let me go, when people are so kind, so very kind, as Lady Albury and your dear mamma? I feel as though I should like to run from the house, and never come back, even though I had to die in the streets. I was so happy when I got your letter and Lady Albury's, and now I am so wretched! I cannot write to Lady Albury. You must just tell her, with many thanks from me, that they will not let me go!\\n\\nYour unhappy but affectionate friend,\\n\\nAYALA\\n\\nCHAPTER 22 AYALA'S GRATITUDE\\n\\nThere was much pity felt for Ayala among the folk at Stalham. The sympathies of them all should have been with Mrs Dosett. They ought to have felt that the poor aunt was simply performing an unpleasant duty, and that the girl was impracticable if not disobedient. But Ayala was known to be very pretty, and Mrs Dosett was supposed to be plain. Ayala was interesting, while Mrs Dosett, from the nature of her circumstances, was most uninteresting. It was agreed on all sides, at Stalham, that so pretty a bird as Ayala should not be imprisoned for ever in so ugly a cage. Such a bird ought, at least, to be allowed its chance of captivating some fitting mate by its song and its plumage. That was Lady Albury's argument -- a woman very good-natured, a little given to matchmaking, a great friend to pretty girls -- and whose eldest son was as yet only nine, so that there could be no danger to herself or her own flock. There was much ridicule thrown on Mrs Dosett at Stalham, and many pretty things said of the bird who was so unworthily imprisoned in Kingsbury Crescent. At last there was something like a conspiracy, the purport of which was to get the bird out of its cage in November.\\n\\nIn this conspiracy it can hardly be said that the Marchesa took an active part. Much as she liked Ayala, she was less prone than Lady Albury to think that the girl was ill-used. She was more keenly alive than her cousin -- or rather her cousin's wife -- to the hard necessities of the world. Ayala must be said to have made her own bed. At any rate there was the bed and she must lie on it. It was not the Dosetts' fault that they were poor. According to their means they were doing the best they could for their niece, and were entitled to praise rather than abuse. And then the Marchesa was afraid for her nephew. Colonel Stubbs, in his letter to her, had declared that he quite agreed with her views as to matrimony; but she was quite alive to her nephew's sarcasm. Her nephew, though he might in truth agree with her, nevertheless was sarcastic. Though he was sarcastic, still he might be made to accede to her views, because he did, in truth, agree with her. She was eminently an intelligent woman, seeing far into character, and she knew pretty well the real condition of her nephew's mind, and could foresee his conduct. He would marry before long, and might not improbably marry a girl with some money if one could be made to come in his way, who would at the same time suit his somewhat fastidious taste. But Ayala suited his taste, Ayala who had not a shilling, and the Marchesa thought it only too likely that if Ayala were released from her cage, and brought to Albury, Ayala might become Mrs Jonathan Stubbs. That Ayala should refuse to become Mrs Jonathan Stubbs did not present itself as a possibility to the Marchesa.\\n\\nSo the matters were when the Marchesa and Nina returned from Stalham to London, a promise having been given that Nina should go back to Stalham in November, and be allowed to see the glories of a hunt. She was not to ride to hounds. That was a matter of course, but she was to be permitted to see what a pack of hounds was like, and of what like were the men in their scarlet coats, and how the huntsman's horn would sound when it should be heard among the woods and fields. It was already decided that the Colonel should be there to meet her, and the conspiracy was formed with the object of getting Ayala out of her cage at the same time. Stalham was a handsome country seat, in the county of Rufford, and Sir Harry Albury had lately taken upon himself the duties of Master of the Rufford and Ufford United Pack. Colonel Stubbs was to be there with his horses in November, but had, in the meantime, been seen by Lady Albury, and had been instigated to do something for the release of Ayala. But what could he do? It was at first suggested that he should call at Kingsbury Crescent, and endeavour to mollify the stony heart of Aunt Dosett. But, as he had said himself, he would be the worst person in the world to perform such an embassy. \\\"I am not an Adonis, I know,\\\" he said, \\\"nor do I look like a Lothario, but still I am in some sort a young man, and therefore certain to be regarded as pernicious, as dangerous and damnable, by such a dragon of virtue as Aunt Dosett. I don't see how I could expect to have a chance.\\\" This interview took place in London during the latter end of October, and it was at last decided that the mission should be made by Lady Albury herself, and made, not to Mrs Dosett, at Kingsbury Crescent, but to Mr Dosett at his office in Somerset House. \\\"I don't think I could stand Mrs D.,\\\" said Lady Albury.\\n\\nLady Albury was a handsome, fashionable woman, rather tall, always excellently dressed, and possessed of a personal assurance which nothing could daunt. She had the reputation of an affectionate wife and a good mother, but was nevertheless declared by some of her friends to be \\\"a little fast\\\". She certainly was fond of comedy -- those who did not like her were apt to say that her comedy was only fun -- and was much disposed to have her own way when she could get it. She was now bent upon liberating Ayala from her cage, and for this purpose had herself driven into the huge court belonging to Somerset House.\",\"timestamp\":1639990917,\"title\":\"\\nOn the following morning, the morning of Monday, 2nd September, Isadore Hamel started on his journey. \"},\"digest\":\"O06kuSzRSVe0BooLVOZ36a48ZhfdqqUNvKqT5fwn-9s\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6e15513EBD81b8159946378511dF1E78276e74F2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PCVV8XY9cUKbyfW2qCOzx3erw5hWnl-057zNMQn0NxY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"m7ue15iKLkWX1ag--nkWe6OQUdXMhIySOoGexLRd2X4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"CH_M4Q79f47eI60bEHfW34Apniv7TNeKEG-siVbUYSPxSTIdzxiqGIjuF0JaCicImGm8_Mo6Jba7ghKsH8rzLA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xadb32d4131c80798b3f228d982c000d96453a2d347bf06745cefc46907cf8dcb660509f10f613b4e073b0abeb1c84a70b4c4223290b680e0812f3633e71666811b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PCVV8XY9cUKbyfW2qCOzx3erw5hWnl-057zNMQn0NxY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"m7ue15iKLkWX1ag--nkWe6OQUdXMhIySOoGexLRd2X4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"O06kuSzRSVe0BooLVOZ36a48ZhfdqqUNvKqT5fwn-9s\"}"
