"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The success which attended the publication in this Series of Illustrated Works of A Woman's Journey round the World, has induced the publication of the present volume on a country so little known as Iceland, and about which so little recent information exists.\\n\\nThe translation has been carefully made, expressly for this Series, from the original work published at Vienna; and the Editor has added a great many notes, wherever they seemed necessary to elucidate the text.\\n\\nIn addition to the matter which appeared in the original work, the present volume contains a translation of a valuable Essay on Icelandic poetry, by M. Bergmann; a translation of an Icelandic poem, the 'Voluspa;' a brief sketch of Icelandic History; and a translation of Schiller's ballad, 'The Diver,' which is prominently alluded to by Madame Pfeiffer in her description of the Geysers. {1}\\n\\nThe Illustrations have been printed in tints, so as to make the work uniform with the Journey round the World.\\n\\nLondon, August 1, 1852.\\n\\nAUTHOR'S PREFACE\\n\\n\\\"Another journey--a journey, moreover, in regions which every one would rather avoid than seek.  This woman only undertakes these journeys to attract attention.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The first journey, for a woman ALONE, was certainly rather a bold proceeding.  Yet in that instance she might still have been excused. Religious motives may perhaps have actuated her; and when this is the case, people often go through incredible things.  At present, however, we can see no just reason which could excuse an undertaking of this description.\\\"\\n\\nThus, and perhaps more harshly still, will the majority judge me. And yet they will do me a grievous wrong.  I am surely simple and harmless enough, and should have fancied any thing in the world rather than that it would ever be my fate to draw upon myself in any degree the notice of the public.  I will merely indicate, as briefly as may be, my character and circumstances, and then I have no doubt my conduct will lose its appearance of eccentricity, and seem perfectly natural.\\n\\nWhen I was but a little child, I had already a strong desire to see the world.  Whenever I met a travelling-carriage, I would stop involuntarily, and gaze after it until it had disappeared; I used even to envy the postilion, for I thought he also must have accomplished the whole long journey.\\n\\nAs I grew to the age of from ten to twelve years, nothing gave me so much pleasure as the perusal of voyages and travels.  I ceased, indeed, to envy the postilions, but envied the more every navigator and naturalist.\\n\\nFrequently my eyes would fill with tears when, having ascended a mountain, I saw others towering before me, and could not gain the summit.\\n\\nI made several journeys with my parents, and, after my marriage, with my husband; and only settled down when it became necessary that my two boys should visit particular schools.  My husband's affairs demanded his entire attention, partly in Lemberg, partly in Vienna. He therefore confided the education and culture of the two boys entirely to my care; for he knew my firmness and perseverance in all I undertook, and doubted not that I would be both father and mother to his children.\\n\\nWhen my sons' education had been completed, and I was living in peaceful retirement, the dreams and aspirations of my youth gradually awoke once more.  I thought of strange manners and customs, of distant regions, where a new sky would be above me, and new ground beneath my feet.  I pictured to myself the supreme happiness of treading the land once hallowed by the presence of our Saviour, and at length made up my mind to travel thither.\\n\\nAs dangers and difficulties rose before my mind, I endeavoured to wean myself from the idea I had formed--but in vain.  For privation I cared but little; my health was good and my frame hardy:  I did not fear death.  And moreover, as I was born in the last century, I could travel ALONE.  Thus every objection was overcome; every thing had been duly weighed and considered.  I commenced my journey to Palestine with a feeling of perfect rapture; and behold, I returned in safety.  I now feel persuaded that I am neither tempting Providence, nor justly incurring the imputation of wishing to be talked about, in following the bent of my inclinations, and looking still further about me in the world I chose Iceland for my destination, because I hoped there to find Nature in a garb such as she wears nowhere else.  I feel so completely happy, so brought into communion with my Maker, when I contemplate sublime natural phenomena, that in my eyes no degree of toil or difficulty is too great a price at which to purchase such perfect enjoyment.\\n\\nAnd should death overtake me sooner or later during my wanderings, I shall await his approach in all resignation, and be deeply grateful to the Almighty for the hours of holy beauty in which I have lived and gazed upon His wonders.\\n\\nAnd now, dear reader, I would beg thee not to be angry with me for speaking so much of myself; it is only because this love of travelling does not, according to established notions, seem proper for one of my sex, that I have allowed my feelings to speak in my defence.\\n\\nJudge me, therefore, not too harshly; but rather grant me the enjoyment of a pleasure which hurts no one, while it makes me happy.\\n\\nTHE AUTHOR.\\n\\nVISIT TO ICELAND\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nIn the year 1845 I undertook another journey; {2} a journey, moreover, to the far North.  Iceland was one of those regions towards which, from the earliest period of my consciousness, I had felt myself impelled.  In this country, stamped as it is by Nature with features so peculiar, as probably to have no counterpart on the face of the globe, I hoped to see things which should fill me with new and inexpressible astonishment.  How deeply grateful do I feel to Thee, O Thou that hast vouchsafed to me to behold the fulfilment of these my cherished dreams!\\n\\nThe parting from all my dear ones had this time far less bitterness; I had found by experience, that a woman of an energetic mind can find her way through the world as well as a man, and that good people are to be met with every where.  To this was added the reflection, that the hardships of my present voyage would be of short duration, and that five or six months might see me restored to my family.\\n\\nI left Vienna at five o'clock on the morning of the tenth of April. As the Danube had lately caused some devastations, on which occasion the railroad had not entirely escaped, we rode for the first four miles, as far as Florisdorf, in an omnibus--not the most agreeable mode of travelling.  Our omnibuses are so small and narrow, that one would suppose they were built for the exclusive accommodation of consumptive subjects, and not for healthy, and in some cases portly individuals, whose bulk is further increased by a goodly assemblage of cloaks, furs, and overcoats.\\n\\nAt the barriers a new difficulty arose.  We delivered up our pass- warrants (passirscheine) in turn, with the exception of one young man, who was quite astounded at the demand.  He had provided nothing but his passport and testimonials, being totally unaware that a pass-warrant is more indispensable than all the rest.  In vain did he hasten into the bureau to expostulate with the officials,--we were forced to continue our journey without him.\\n\\nWe were informed that he was a student, who, at the conclusion of term, was about to make holiday for a few weeks at his parents' house near Prague.  Alas, poor youth! he had studied so much, and yet knew so little.  He had not even an idea of the overwhelming importance of the document in question.  For this trifling omission he forfeited the fare to Prague, which had been paid in advance.\\n\\nBut to proceed with my journey.\\n\\nAt Florisdorf a joyful surprise awaited me.  I met my brother and my son, who had, it appears, preceded me.  We entered the train to proceed in company to Stockerau, a place between twelve and thirteen miles off; but were obliged to alight halfway, and walk a short distance.  The Embankment had given way.  Luckily the weather was favourable, inasmuch as we had only a violent storm of wind.  Had it rained, we should have been wetted to the skin, besides being compelled to wade ankle-deep in mud.  We were next obliged to remain in the open air, awaiting the arrival of the train from Stockerau, which unloaded its freight, and received us in exchange.\\n\\nAt Stockerau I once more took leave of my companions, and was soon securely packed in the post-carriage for transmission.\\n\\nIn travelling this short distance, I had thus entered four carriages; a thing sufficiently disagreeable to an unencumbered person, but infinitely more so to one who has luggage to watch over. The only advantage I could discover in all this was, that we had saved half an hour in coming these seventeen miles.  For this, instead of 9 fl. 26 kr. from Vienna to Prague, we paid 10 fl. 10 kr. from Stockerau to Prague, without reckoning expense of omnibus and railway.  It was certainly a dearly-bought half-hour. {3}\\n\\nThe little town of Znaim, with its neighbouring convent, is situated on a large plain, extending from Vienna to Budwitz, seventeen miles beyond Znaim; the monotony of the view is only broken here and there by low hills.\\n\\nNear Schelletau the scenery begins to improve.  On the left the view is bounded by a range of high hills, with a ruined castle, suggestive of tragical tales of centuries gone by.  Fir and pine forests skirt the road, and lie scattered in picturesque groups over hill and dale.\\n\\nApril 11th.\\n\\nYesterday the weather had already begun to be ungracious to us.  At Znaim we found the valleys still partly covered with snow, and the fog was at times so thick, that we could not see a hundred paces in advance; but to-day it was incomparably worse.  The mist resolved itself into a mild rain, which, however, lost so much of its mildness as we passed from station to station, that every thing around us was soon under water.  But not only did we ride through water, we were obliged to sit in it also.  The roof of our carriage threatened to become a perfect sieve, and the rain poured steadily in.  Had there been room for such a proceeding, we should all have unfurled our umbrellas.\\n\\nOn occasions like these, I always silently admire the patience of my worthy countrymen, who take every thing so good-humouredly.  Were I a man, I should pursue a different plan, and should certainly not fail to complain of such carelessness.  But as a woman, I must hold my peace; people would only rail at my sex, and call it ill- humoured.  Besides, I thanked my guardian-angel for these discomforts, looking upon them as a preparation for what was to befall me in the far North.\\n\\nPassing several small towns and villages, we at length entered the Bohemian territory, close behind Iglau.  The first town which we saw was Czaslau, with its large open square, and a few neat houses; the latter provided with so-called arbours (or verandahs), which enable one to pass round the square dry-footed, even in the most rainy weather.\\n\\nJourneying onwards, we noticed the fine cathedral and town of Kuttenberg, once famous for its gold and silver mines. {4}  Next comes the great tobacco-manufactory of Sedlitz, near which we first see the Elbe, but only for a short time, as it soon takes another direction.  Passing the small town of Collin, we are whirled close by the battle-field where, in the year 1757, the great King Frederick paid his score to the Austrians.  An obelisk, erected a few years since to the memory of General Daun, occupies a small eminence on the right.  On the left is the plain of Klephorcz, where the Austrian army was drawn up. {5}\\n\\nAt eleven o'clock on the same night we reached\\n\\nPRAGUE.\\n\\nAs it was my intention to pursue my journey after two days, my first walk on the following morning was to the police-office, to procure a passport and the all-important pass-warrant; my next to the custom- house, to take possession of a small chest, which I had delivered up five days before my departure, and which, as the expeditor affirmed, I should find ready for me on my arrival at Prague. {6}  Ah, Mr. Expeditor! my chest was not there.  After Saturday comes Sunday; but on Sunday the custom-house is closed.  So here was a day lost, a day in which I might have gone to Dresden, and even visited the opera.\\n\\nOn Monday morning I once more hastened to the office in anxious expectation; the box was not yet there.  An array of loaded wagons had, however, arrived, and in one of these it might be.  Ah, how I longed to see my darling little box, in order that I might--NOT press it to my heart, but unpack it in presence of the excise officer!\\n\\nI took merely a cursory glance at Prague, as I had thoroughly examined every thing there some years before.  The beautiful \\\"Graben\\\" and Horse-market once more excited my admiration.  It was with a peculiar feeling that I trod the old bridge, from which St. John of Nepomuk was cast into the Moldau for refusing to publish the confession of King Wenceslaus' consort. {7}  On the opposite bank I mounted the Hradschin, and paid a visit to the cathedral, in which a large sarcophagus, surrounded and borne by angels, and surmounted by a canopy of crimson damask, is dedicated to the memory of the saint. The monument is of silver, and the worth of the metal alone is estimated at 80,000 florins.  The church itself is not spacious, but is built in the noble Gothic style; the lesser altars, however, with their innumerable gilded wooden figures, look by contrast extremely puny.  In the chapel are many sarcophagi, on which repose bishops and knights hewn in stone, but so much damaged, that many are without hands and feet, while some lack heads.  To the right, at the entrance of the church, is the celebrated chapel of St. Wenceslaus, with its walls ornamented with frescoes, of which the colours and designs are now almost obliterated.  It is further enriched with costly stones.\\n\\nNot far from the cathedral is situated the palace of Count Czernin, a building particularly favoured with windows, of which it has one for every day in the year.  I was there in an ordinary year, and saw 365; how they manage in leap-year I do not know.  The view from the belvedere of this palace well repays the observer.  It takes in the old and new town, the noble river with its two bridges (the ancient venerable-looking stone structure, and the graceful suspension- bridge, six hundred paces long), and the hills round about, clothed with gardens, among which appear neat country-houses.\\n\\nThe streets of the \\\"Kleinseite\\\" are not particularly attractive, being mostly tortuous, steep, and narrow.  They contain, however, several remarkable palaces, among which that of Wallenstein Duke of Friedland stands pre-eminent. {8}\\n\\nAfter visiting St. Nicholas' Church, remarkable for the height of its spire and its beautifully arched cupola, I betook myself to Wimmer's gardens, and thence to the \\\"Bastei,\\\" a place of public resort with the citizens of Prague.\\n\\nI could now observe the devastation caused by the rising of the water shortly before my arrival.  The Moldau had overstepped its banks in so turbulent a manner, as to carry along with it several small houses, and even a little village not far from Prague, besides damaging all the dwellings upon its banks.  The water had indeed already fallen, but the walls of the houses were soaked through and through; the doors had been carried away, and from the broken windows no faces looked out upon the passers-by.  The water had risen two feet more than in 1784, in which year the Moldau had also attained an unusual height.\\n\\nFrom the same tower of observation, I looked down upon the great open space bought a few years ago, and intended to be occupied by the termini of the Vienna and Dresden railroads.  Although several houses were only just being pulled down, and the foundations of but few buildings were laid, I was assured that within six months every thing would be completed.\\n\\nI have still to mention a circumstance which struck me during my morning peregrinations, namely, the curious method in which milk, vegetables, and other provisions are here brought to town.  I could have fancied myself transported to Lapland or Greenland, on meeting every where carts to which two, three, or four dogs were harnessed. One pair of dogs will drag three hundredweight on level ground; but when they encounter a hill, the driver must lend a helping hand. These dogs are, besides, careful guardians; and I would not advise any one to approach a car of this kind, as it stands before the inn- door, while the proprietor is quenching his thirst within, on the money he has just earned.\\n\\nAt five o'clock on the morning of the 15th of April I left Prague, and rode for fourteen miles in the mail-carriage, as far as Obristwy on the Elbe, at which place I embarked for Dresden, on board the steamer Bohemia, of fifty-horse power, a miserable old craft, apparently a stranger to beauty and comfort from her youth up.  The price charged for this short passage of eight or nine hours is enormously dear.  The travellers will, however, soon have their revenge on the extortionate proprietors; a railroad is constructing, by means of which this distance will be traversed in a much shorter time, and at a great saving of expense.\\n\\nBut at any rate the journey by water is the more agreeable; the way lies through very picturesque scenery, and at length through \\\"Saxon Switzerland\\\" itself.  The commencement of the journey is, however, far from pleasing.  On the right are naked hills, and on the left large plains, over which, last spring, the swollen stream rolled, partly covering the trees and the roofs of the cottages.  Here I could for the first time see the whole extent of the calamity.  Many houses had been completely torn down, and the crops, and even the loose alluvial earth swept away; as we glided by each dreary scene of devastation, another yet more dismal would appear in its place.\\n\\nThis continued till we reached Melnick, where the trees become higher, and groups of houses peer forth from among the innumerable vineyards.  Opposite this little town the Moldau falls into the Elbe.  On the left, in the far distance, the traveller can descry St. George's Mount, from which, as the story goes, Czech took possession of all Bohemia.\\n\\nBelow the little town of Raudnitz the hills gave place to mountains, and as many enthusiasts can only find those regions romantic where the mountains are crowned with half-ruined castles and strongholds, good old Time has taken care to plant there two fine ruins, Hafenberg and Skalt, for the delectation of such sentimental observers.\\n\\nNear Leitmeritz, a small town with a handsome castle, and a church and convent, the Eger flows into the Elbe, and a high-arched wooden bridge connects the two banks.  Here our poor sailors had difficult work to lower the mast and the funnel.\\n\\nThe rather pretty village of Gross-Czernoseck is remarkable for its gigantic cellars, hewn out of the rock.  A post-carriage could easily turn round in one of these.  The vats are of course proportioned to the cellars, particularly the barrels called the \\\"twelve apostles,\\\" each of which holds between three and four thousand gallons.  It would be no more than fair to stop here awhile, to give every hero of the bottle an opportunity to enjoy a sight of these palace-cellars, and to offer a libation to the twelve apostles; but the steamer passed on, and we were obliged to make the most of the descriptions furnished by those who were more at home in these parts, and had no doubt frequently emerged in an inspired state from the depths of the cellars in question.\\n\\nThe view now becomes more and more charming:  the mountains appear to draw closer together, and shut in the bed of the stream; romantic groups of rocks, with summits crowned by rains yet more romantic, tower between.  The ancient but well-preserved castle of Schreckenstein, built on a rock rising boldly out of the Elbe, is particularly striking; the approaches to it are by serpentine walks hewn out of the rock.\\n\\nNear the small town of Aussig we find the most considerable coal- mines in Bohemia.  In their neighbourhood is situated the little mountain estate Paschkal, which produces a kind of wine said to resemble champagne.\\n\\nThe mountains now become higher and higher, but above them all towers the gigantic Jungfernsprung (Maiden's Leap).  The beauty of this region is only surpassed by the situation of the town and castle of Tetschen.  The castle stands on a rock, between twenty and thirty feet high, which seems to rise out of the Elbe; it is surrounded by hot-houses and charming gardens, shelving downwards as far as the town, which lies in a blooming valley, near a little harbour.  The valley itself, encompassed by a chain of lofty mountains, seems quite shut out from the rest of the world.\\n\\nThe left bank of the river is here so crowded with masses and walls of rock, that there is only room at intervals for an isolated farm or hut.  Suddenly the tops of masts appear between the high rocks, a phenomenon which is soon explained; a large gap in one of the rocky walls forms a beautiful basin.\\n\\nAnd now we come to Schandau, a place consisting only of a few houses; it is a frontier town of the Saxon dominions.  Custom-house officers, a race of beings ever associated with frontier towns, here boarded our vessel, and rummaged every thing.  My daguerreotype apparatus, which I had locked up in a small box, was looked upon with an eye of suspicion; but upon my assertion that it was exclusively intended for my own use, I and my apparatus were graciously dismissed.\\n\\nIn our onward journey we frequently observed rocks of peculiar shapes, which have appropriate names, such as the \\\"Zirkelstein,\\\" \\\"Lilienstein,\\\" &c.  The Konigstein is a collection of jagged masses of rock, on which is built the fortress of the same name, used at present as a prison for great criminals.  At the foot of the rocks lies the little town of Konigstein.  Not far off, on the right bank, a huge rock, resting on others, bears a striking resemblance to a human head.  The more distant groups of rocks are called those of \\\"Rathen,\\\" but are considered as belonging to Saxon Switzerland.  The \\\"Basteien\\\" (Bastions) of this Switzerland, close by which we now pass, are most wonderful superpositions of lofty and fantastically shaped rocks.  Unfortunately, the steamer whirled us so rapidly on our way, that whilst we contemplated one bank, the beauteous scenes on the opposite side had already glided from our view.  In much too short a time we had passed the town of Pirna, situate at the commencement of this range of mountains.  The very ancient gate of this town towers far above all the other buildings.\\n\\nLastly we see the great castle Sonnenstein, built on a rock, and now used as an asylum for lunatics.\\n\\nAll the beautiful and picturesque portion of our passage is now past, and the royal villa of Pillnitz, with its many Chinese gables, looks insignificant enough, after the grand scenes of nature.  A chain of hills, covered with the country-houses of citizens, adjoins it; and on the right extends a large plain, at the far end of which we can dimly descry the Saxon metropolis.  But what is that in the distance?  We have hardly time to arrange our luggage, when the anchor is let go near the fine old Dresden Bridge.\\n\\nThis bridge had not escaped unscathed by the furious river.  One of the centre arches had given way, and the cross and watchbox which surmounted it were precipitated into the flood.  At first, carriages still passed over the bridge; it was not until some time afterwards that the full extent of the damage was ascertained, and the passage of carriages over the bridge discontinued for many months.\\n\\nAs I had seen the town of Dresden several years before, and the only building new to me was the splendid theatre, I took advantage of the few evening hours of my stay to visit this structure.\\n\\nStanding in the midst of the beautiful Cathedral-square, its noble rotunda-like form at once rivets the attention.  The inner theatre is surrounded by a superb broad and lofty corridor, with fine bow- windows and straight broad staircases, leading in different directions towards the galleries.  The interior of the theatre is not so spacious as, judging from the exterior, one would imagine it to be, but the architecture and decorations are truly gorgeous and striking.  The boxes are all open, being separated from each other merely by a low partition; the walls and chairs are covered with heavy silken draperies, and the seats of the third and fourth galleries with a mixture of silk and cotton.  One single circumstance was disagreeable to me in an acoustic point of view--I could hear the slightest whisper of the prompter as distinctly as though some one had been behind me reading the play.  The curtain had scarcely fallen before the whole house was empty, and yet there was no crowding to get out.  This first drew my attention to the numerous and excellently contrived doors.\\n\\nApril 16th.\\n\\nThe Dresden omnibuses may be cited as models of comfort; one is certain of plenty of room, and there is no occasion to dread either the corpulent persons or the furs and cloaks of fellow-passengers. A bell-pull is fixed in the interior of the carriage, so that each individual can give the coachman a signal when he or she wishes to alight.  These omnibuses call at the principal inns, and wait for a moment; but the traveller who is not ready in advance is left behind.\\n\\nAt half-past five in the morning it called at our hotel.  I was ready and waiting, and drove off comfortably to the railway.  The distance from Dresden to Leipzig is reckoned at fifty-six miles, and the journey occupied three hours.\\n\\nThe first fourteen miles are very agreeable; gardens, fields, and meadows, pine-forests in the plain and on the hills, and between these, villages, farms, country-houses, and solitary chapels, combine to form a very pretty landscape.  But the scene soon changes, and the town of Meissen (famous for its porcelain manufactory), on the right hand, seems to shut out from our view all that is picturesque and beautiful.\\n\\nFrom here to Leipzig we travel through a wearisome monotonous plain, enlivened at long intervals by villages and scattered farms.  There is nothing to see but a great tunnel, and the river Pleisse--the latter, or rather the Elster, is rendered famous by the death of Prince Poniatowski. {9}\\n\\nThe town of Leipzig, celebrated far and wide for its fairs, and more for its immense publishing trade, presents an appearance of noise and bustle proportionate to its commercial importance.  I found streets, squares, and inns alike crowded. {10}\\n\\nPerhaps there does not exist a town with its houses, and consequently its streets, so disfigured with announcements, in all sizes and shapes, covering its walls, and sometimes projecting several feet, as Leipzig.\\n\\nAmong the public buildings, those which pleased me most were the Augusteum and the Burgerschule.  The Bucherhalle (book-hall) I should suppose indebted for its celebrity rather to its literary contents than to its architectural beauty or its exterior.  The hall itself is indeed large, and occupies the whole length of the building, while the lower story consists of several rooms.  The hall, the chambers, and the exterior are all plain, and without particular decoration.  The Tuchhalle (cloth-hall) is simply a large house, with spacious chambers, containing supplies of cloth.  The Theatre stands on a very large square, and does not present a very splendid appearance, whether viewed from within or from without. The plan of having stalls in front of the boxes in the second and third galleries was a novelty to me.  The orchestra I could only hear, but could not discover its whereabouts; most probably it was posted behind the scenes.  On inquiry, I was told that this was only done on extraordinary occasions, when the seats in the orchestra were converted into stalls, as was the case on the night of my visit.  The play given was \\\"the original Tartuffe,\\\" a popular piece by Gutzkow.  It was capitally performed.\\n\\nIn the Leipzig theatre I had a second opportunity of observing, that as regards the love of eating our good Saxons are not a whit behind the much-censured Viennese.  In the Dresden theatre I had admired a couple of ladies who sat next me.  They came provided with a neat bag, containing a very sufficient supply of confectionery, to which they perseveringly applied themselves between the acts.  But at Leipzig I found a delicate-looking mother and her son, a lad of fifteen or sixteen years, regaling themselves with more solid provisions--white bread and small sausages.  I could not believe my eyes, and had made up my mind that the sausages were artificially formed out of some kind of confectionery--but alas! my nose came forward but too soon, as a potent witness, to corroborate what I was so unwilling to believe!\\n\\nNeither did these two episodes take place in the loftiest regions of Thalia's temple, but in the stalls of the second tier.\\n\\nBeautiful alleys are planted round Leipzig.  I took a walk into the Rosenthal (Valley of Roses), which also consists of splendid avenues and lawns.  A pretty coffee-house, with a very handsome alcove, built in a semicircular form, invites the weary traveller to rest and refreshment, while a band of agreeable music diffuses mirth and good humour around.\\n\\nThe rest of the scenery around Leipzig presents the appearance of a vast and monotonous plain.\\n\\nApril 17th.\\n\\nI had intended to continue my journey to Hamburgh via Berlin, but the weather was so cold and stormy, and the rain poured down so heavily, that I preferred the shorter way, and proceeded by rail to Magdeburg.  Flying through the dismal plain past Halle, Kothen, and other towns, of which I could only discern groups of houses, we hurriedly recognised the Saale and the Elbe; and towards 10 o'clock in the morning arrived at Magdeburg, having travelled seventy miles in three hours and a quarter.\\n\\nAs the steamer for Hamburgh was not to start until 3 o'clock, I had ample time to look at the town.\\n\\nMagdeburg is a mixed pattern of houses of ancient, mediaeval, and modern dates.  Particularly remarkable in this respect is the principal street, the \\\"Broadway,\\\" which runs through the whole of the town.  Here we can see houses dating their origin from the most ancient times; houses that have stood proof against sieges and sackings; houses of all colours and forms; some sporting peaked gables, on which stone figures may still be seen; others covered from roof to basement with arabesques; and in one instance I could even detect the remains of frescoes.  In the very midst of these relics of antiquity would appear a house built in the newest style. I do not remember ever having seen a street which produced so remarkable an impression on me.  The finest building is unquestionably the venerable cathedral.  In Italy I had already seen numbers of the most beautiful churches; yet I remained standing in mute admiration before this masterpiece of Gothic architecture.\\n\\nThe monument with the twelve Apostles in this church is a worthy memorial of the celebrated sculptor Vischer.  In order to view it, it is necessary to obtain the special permission of the commandant.\\n\\nThe cathedral square is large, symmetrical, and decorated with two alleys of trees; it is also used as a drilling-ground for the soldiers' minor manoeuvres.  I was particularly struck with the number of military men to be seen here.  Go where I would, I was sure to meet soldiers and officers, frequently in large companies; in time of war it could scarcely have been worse.  This was an unmistakeable token that I was on Prussian territory.\\n\\nThe open canals, which come from all the houses, and meander through the streets, are a great disfigurement to the town.\\n\\nHalf-past three o'clock came only too quickly, and I betook myself on board the steamer Magdeburg, of sixty-horse power, to proceed to Hamburgh.  Of the passage itself I can say nothing, except that a journey on a river through execrable scenery is one of the most miserable things that can well be imagined.  When, in addition to this, the weather is bad, the ship dirty, and one is obliged to pass a night on board, the discomfort is increased.  It was my lot to endure all this:  the weather was bad, the ship was dirty, the distance more than 100 miles, so that we had the pleasant prospect of a delightful night on board the ship.  There were, moreover, so many passengers, that we were forced to sit crowded together; so there we sat with exemplary patience, stared at each other, and sighed bitterly.  Order was entirely out of the question; no one had time to think of such a thing.  Smoking and card-playing were perseveringly carried on all day and all night; it can easily be imagined that things did not go so quietly as at an English whist- party.  The incessant rain rendered it impossible to leave the cabin even for a short time.  The only consolation I had was, that I made the acquaintance of the amiable composer Lorzing, a circumstance which delighted me the more, as I had always been an admirer of his beautiful original music.\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nMorning dawned at length, and in a short time afterwards we reached the great commercial city, which, half destroyed by the dreadful conflagration of 1842, had risen grander and more majestic from its ashes. {11}  I took up my quarters with a cousin, who is married to the Wurtemburg consul, the merchant Schmidt, in whose house I spent a most agreeable and happy week.
