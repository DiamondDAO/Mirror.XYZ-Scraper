"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Why Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (“DAOs”) are becoming popular and significant\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*mmHif7NJMNeagKMEkH-RuQ.png)\\n\\nDecentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a member-owned communities without any centralized leadership. It is an open source ***blockchain protocol*** governed by a ***set of rules*** that are created by its elected members. The protocol can ***automatically execute*** some specific actions without the need from any supervision. Furthermore, all the rules and subsequent actions executed are recorded on secured blockchain ledgers with ***immutable timestamp***. They cannot be tempered with by the participants. Once operational, an algorithmic consensus mechanism that validates all the decisions will be taking place 24x7.\\n\\nSuch a progressive idea was first proposed by Christoph Jentzsch in 2016 and the first DAO — which was simply known as DAO — was born. The inspiration is to create an organization for a group of participants that share a ***common goal***, and governed by code that is ***decentralized***, *open* as well as ***transparent***.\\n\\nDAOs are an effective and safe way to work with like-minded people around the globe. Decisions are governed by proposals and voting, in order to ascertain that everyone in the organization has a voice. It is no surprise DAOs are perceived as the most direct and honest form of democracy within the modern-world organizations.\\n\\nThe backbone of a DAO is its smart contract. The contract defines the rules of the organization. Once the contract goes live on Ethereum, it is temper-proof; no one can alter the rules except by a vote. If anyone attempts to execute something that’s not covered by the rules and logic embedded in the code, the mission will certainly fail.\\n\\nThe following table summarizes the key differences between a DAO and a traditional organization.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1368/1\\\\*5DaXFkZoGeWV0G05umXAAw.png)\\n\\nThere’re two types of DAOs, determined by their membership design:\\n\\n1\\\\. Token-based membership\\n\\n* This type of DAO” is typically fully permissionless. Most of these governance tokens can be traded permissionless-ly on decentralized exchanges. Others must be earned through providing liquidity or some other ‘proof-of-work’. Either way, simply holding the token grants access to voting.\\n* The most well-known example is MakerDAO and its token MKR (market cap : US$2bn) is widely available for trading on decentralized exchanges. Any prospective member may purchase them and gain voting power on the Maker protocol.\\n\\n2\\\\. Share-based membership\\n\\n* This type of DAO is less permissionless. Prospective members would need to submit a proposal to join the DAO, offering tribute of some value in the form of tokens or work. Once accepted, members will obtain shares, which represent direct voting power and ownership of the DAO. Members can exit at any time. This setup is typically for more closer-knit, human-centric organizations such as charities and investment clubs. A well-known example is MolochDAO.\\n\\nIn summary, there are three key benefits of DAOs:\\n\\n1. ***Transparency***. Users of DAOs can readily can readily see any transactions that take place on the blockchain, which provide users with high level of confidence;\\n2. ***Efficiency***. DAO organizations are more efficient, as all the actions are executed; automatically by the smart contracts based on predefined codes. This set up significantly reduce the costs as well as security concerns if the actions were to rely on the third party;\\n3. ***Autonomous structure***. DAOs offer opportunities for any users to submit proposals (regardless of their stakes) for voting, which provides DAOs an opportunity to continue to improve over time.\\n\\nHowever, DAOs still face a few major drawbacks, namely:\\n\\n1. ***Vulnerability by hackers***. For DAOs with design loopholes, they can be exploited by hackers. This point was exemplified by the massive hack of DAO in 2016k resulting in US$50mn loss;\\n2. ***Unclear legal status***. There is a lack of governmental precedence on DAO in any part of the world;\\n3. ***Not completely impartial***. In voting for proposals, users with largest stake will have larger say. If the user base is skewed with a few large users, it will destroy the autonomous spirit of a DAO.\\n\\nIt is imperative to recognize that DAO do not eliminate the need for human input. It’s simply more transparent and corruption-resistant; and is a decentralized way to ensure the integrity of the system.\\n\\n## **Blockchain Governance**\\n\\nConceptually, governance is the process whereby the members of an organization establish a set of underlying rules to execute the decisions made — either an executive order or a collective resolution. In the context of blockchain, governance is the process designed by founding members and for all the stakeholders to exercise their bargaining power over the network protocol.\\n\\nHere, the list of stakeholders involved include token holders, miners, network validators, core application developers as well as the founding team members. Presumably, each of these stakeholder groups have certain amount of stake-holding in the protocol, yet they could have diametric motivations behind them, when it comes to making proposals and voting for the network (e.g. shorter-term gains by token-holders vs. longer-term gain by application developers). Like many other off-chain organizations, the challenge here is to design and build a fault-tolerant system that can balance the interests of each of the stakeholder groups delicately.\\n\\nDAOs solve the issues of transparency, immutability, decentralization and ease of executions. However, it does not fully address the issue of fairness and equality — the very core value of blockchain development. For instance: if the founding teams were awarded a large amount of tokens at the very stage, they inevitably will have asymmetrical voting power, if the voting decision is entirely based on the amount of stakes. We go back to the thorny issue: the rich are in control and have power.\\n\\nFurther, the focus has been the execution of the governance, rather than the design of the governance structure itself. As discussed earlier, all the rules on blockchains are executed automatically by smart contracts, which are pre-designed codes (written in Solidity) on or prior to the network is established. From this perspective, the doctrine of blockchain governance is about the way decision are made, rather than the decision themselves — i.e. ***who chooses and how choices are made, rather than what is chosen*** **\\\\[1,2\\\\]**.\\n\\nAnother salient aspect for blockchain governance is that: we cannot retrofit the system once the protocol is up and running. In other words, there is no logical way to “make a decision” to “upgrade” the governance mechanism itself, should a logical fallacy be discovered after the protocol goes live. Thus, the design needs to be thoroughly thought-out and bullet-proof right from the get-go.\\n\\nGovernance disputes related to blockchain protocols are not uncommon and the blockchain community have raised different views on how blockchains should be governed. No “perfect” solution has been devised yet, nevertheless.\\n\\n## **Snapshot**\\n\\nAn important — and common — element in Blockchain governance is voting. Typically, voting with cryptocurrency would incur gas fees in order to process the movement of currency from one wallet to another. Further, cryptocurrency projects would need to create the infrastructure themselves to conduct the polling — or falling back to traditional methods that aren’t decentralized. These centralized methods can be time-consuming and subject to manipulation by parties whose interests may not necessarily align with the projects’.\\n\\nSnapshot is an off-chain, gasless, multi-governance community polling dashboard. It was founded by someone with a Pseudonymous handle “Fabien”, when he was working for automated market maker (AMM) Balancer. On the Snapshot platform, a variety of projects have created their relevant proposals for stakeholders to vote — by connecting wallet and using cryptocurrency.\\n\\nWhat Snapshot aims to achieve is: permits projects to seek out their most committed members who hold their chosen cryptocurrency and ask them to make decisions by voting. By using a decentralized storage network called IPFS (*InterPlanetary File System*) to create and store the votes, Snapshot uses a blockchain to register how people reacted to a poll without incurring the usual gas fees.\\n\\nSnapshot does not actually use any ‘on-chain’ verification and voting takes place by not sending the transactions to a blockchain. As a result, votes are essentially fee-less. Meanwhile, for the poll creator, those votes are still made available so the key stakeholders can keep track of the progress as the event unfold.\\n\\nThe drawback — though — is that the voting mechanism on Snapshot is not entirely on-chain and therefore more vulnerable to ill-intentioned manipulations.\\n\\n## **Last Few Words**\\n\\nBlockchain technology is in its infancy stage and more innovations will come in due course. In a recent interview with *Unfinished Love*, Gavin Wood — cofounder of Ethereum — said blockchain governance needs to go beyond the chain-level micro-decisions. We need to start configuring a set of governance mechanisms that could help make decisions on some macro topics: such as on how the blockchain should evolve its technology over the long-haul; and how it should, or whether it should, fix certain bugs.” etc.\\n\\nAfter all, smart contracts are programmed by smart developers.\\n\\n*\\\\[1\\\\] Hsieh, Vergne, Wang, “The internal and external governance of blockchain-based organizations: Evidence from cryptocurrencies,” in Bitcoin and Beyond: Blockchain and Global Governance, vol.48–68, M.
