The Solana token's gains came primarily as a part of a recovery move that started Nov. 28, wherein it rebounded over 20% upon testing a dependable multi-month ascending trendline as support (near $190), as shown in the chart below.\\n\\n![SOL/USDT daily price chart featuring Ascending Trendline support.

As a result, the $260-price level appears like the last line of defense between SOL and a new record high.\\n\\n\\\"SOL, although, looks like exhaustion, still $300-something is possible (this season),\\\" [noted](https://twitter.com/fomocapdao) @fomocapdao, an independent market analyst, adding:\\n\\n> \\\"It depends on the whole \\\\[ecosystem though\\\\], meaning TVL, NFTs, Tabasco, announcements of announcements.\\\"\\n\\n## \\\"Continued appetite\\\" for Solana\\n\\nGrayscale's decision to add Solana into its service portfolio promised to make SOL visible across more high-net-worth and institutional investors. \\n\\nThat is primarily because of Solana's incredible growth as a blockchain project in 2021.
