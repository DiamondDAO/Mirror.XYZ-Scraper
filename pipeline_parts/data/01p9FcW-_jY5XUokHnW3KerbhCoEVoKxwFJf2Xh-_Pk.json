"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Today is the last day of the weekend, and also the last day of October. We have witnessed a lot of historic scenes in this October. Tomorrow, the beginning of November, it will be the the start of the explosive growth of BTC and ETH based on the data.\\nDue to the shortage of fund inflow, there are frequent volatilities in the market. And we can find that BTC and ETH have accumulated enough energy, especially ETH. Though we don’t know what is going to happen about ETH, we can see the large amounts of withdrawal from exchanges. Anyway, it’s really looking forward to.\\n\\n\\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\\n\\n\\nThe trends of BTC and ETH on the weekend was the same as I estimated yesterday — fluctuating down. Due to the shortage of funds, ALT started to feed back BTC and ETH last night.\\n\\n![USDT total transfer volume in the last week](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/H2a9FXhD4ZVNWX9JRahbX.png?height=1013&width=1800)\\n\\n![USDT total transfer volume to exchanges in the last week](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4vLggTNBO9zmdEvOK12Tx.png?height=1013&width=1800)\\n\\n![USDC total transfer volume in the last week](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jf7fsDTDa1FoR1KvUP-xd.png?height=1013&width=1800)\\n\\n![USDC total transfer volume to exchanges in the last week](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PQjVOQyCFIhjKuSlhZEov.png?height=1013&width=1800)\\n\\nFrom the graphs above, we can see there is a large amount of USDC transfer on yesterday, and at present we don’t know where it comes from and what is going to be used for. In addition, we can clearly see that the volatility in the middle is much stronger than that on both sides, which we have always said.\\n\\n![BTC total transfer volume in the last week](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/telVr9T3IFLDbtE3nswyd.png?height=1013&width=1800)\\n\\n![ETH total transfer volume in the last week](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1R_thOLvovSELfshjOCtk.png?height=1013&width=1800)\\n\\n![BTC net transfer volume from/to exchanges in the last week](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4X3PT-5ihiUm8qDP1yu6r.png?height=1013&width=1800)\\n\\n![ETH net transfer volume from/to exchanges in the last week](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BO98GEvzsxN9DL2tvxHl0.png?height=1013&width=1800)\\n\\nFrom the graphs above, we notice that there is barely no volatility of both BTC and ETH transfers on weekends. But compared with BTC, ETH have some amounts of transfer from exchanges, which had happened on BTC in September. Then we welcomed the approval of BTC ETF in October.\\n\\n![BTC futures open interest perpetual in the last week](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Kvz1VlmHyKqxG86eec2Hu.png?height=1013&width=1800)\\n\\n![BTC futures volume perpetual in the last week](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/opo9NwXlG_aui6yKMvv9B.png?height=1013&width=1800)\\n\\n![ETH futures open interest perpetual in the last week](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wvCjAhSMPc04LQbY4koXg.png?height=1013&width=1800)\\n\\n![ETH futures volume perpetual in the last week](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lrGRx7sagf70mSikkvrCo.png?height=1013&width=1800)\\n\\nThe number of BTC futures open interest perpetual almost halved during the weekdays, and the futures volume on weekends is also very low. While ETH futures trend is more consistent with its price rising. A large number of open interest perpetual may signal a huge volatility in price. But the futures volume is quite similar to that of BTC.\\n\\n![BTC balance on exchanges in the last week](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sSmtEprnPtGDb8La6HmPS.png?height=1013&width=1800)\\n\\n![ETH balance on exchanges in the last week](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RH_V7U65geHAkAWRDoK1d.png?height=1013&width=1800)\\n\\nBTC balance on exchanges has no obvious changes compared with that of yesterday, which is within our prediction, because of limited funds inflow. While ETH balance on exchanges reduces a little with retail funds, getting closer to the lowest level in the last 3 years. ETH will move to a more decentralized and prosperous development.\\n\\n![BTC total supply held by long-term holders in the last week](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3EtSFe6feCJzSnhK1ng4o.png?height=1013&width=1800)\\n\\n![BTC total supply held by long-term holders in the last week](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wqxoPiAjhWxZgzpCyP7tU.png?height=1013&width=1800)\\n\\nWe have said several days ago that 63k is the starting point of reducing holdings for the long-term holders. Long-term holders would barely like to reduce holdings when the price is lower than 63k, which means the number of BTC in circulation may reduce. Let’s wait and see what will happen on BTC and ETH in November.\",\"timestamp\":1635658445,\"title\":\"ETH Futures Open Interest Perpetual Remains High; BTC Trading Volume Decreases Sharply - 31.Oct 2021\"},\"digest\":\"_YgVxnidr4M6WPY2pT-M3qN5DTE4E9pnrzNCPlF2qns\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xdDa424d9bB3140bE68b0AAadCaf7CADf7c36A046\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NFCZe-r54btwI2U4Uvj67yS4T1kL4yJtOafKKgW3Itc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"lMwb4FQxsy5QjlLIRAJ8Tgm0hsdTON4oiXymAA9Wwis\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"PlPKNhYoCanNlodMG4n6s_-nhdBNfJf4BrzQ4G-1Dp11mPEyTblxANi6y-4LrF-q26IsX1JS3hvVj66a5Jqy9Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x935782fe1dd9d239528fa13794d837af5a5887b337464ee67ce0fd7c26f05a6061c44837e0d8561db6647d5e164c92945a039e6b70d91b2a18ec2f2abc6260f61b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NFCZe-r54btwI2U4Uvj67yS4T1kL4yJtOafKKgW3Itc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"lMwb4FQxsy5QjlLIRAJ8Tgm0hsdTON4oiXymAA9Wwis\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"_YgVxnidr4M6WPY2pT-M3qN5DTE4E9pnrzNCPlF2qns\"}"
