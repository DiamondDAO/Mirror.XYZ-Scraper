"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1.  is there a way that non-profits can learn about popular things on the internet that might be related to them, and take that immediate attention to raise $$ for their causes? thinking about this in the context of this NYTimes article the whole internet is reading - there are no shortage of hot takes about it, but if you choose to read it, take a quick scroll through the comments section, some of which resonated: <https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/05/magazine/dorland-v-larson.html>.\\n\\n    As a palate cleanser after reading it, put together this page which links directly to donate to the national kidney foundation. there are +/- 500,000 subscribers here, so if we each give a little it should have quite an impact: <https://team.kidney.org/campaign/Positive-Outcome-from-NYTimes-Article>.

[Holee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kurstin).\\n\\n    “Kurstin co-wrote and produced three songs on Adele's 2015 album, 25, including its first single, \\\"Hello\\\". In an interview with Rolling Stone, Adele said: \\\"This song was a massive breakthrough for me with my writing because it'd been pretty slow up to this point, and I felt after I worked with Greg \\\\[Kurstin] on this, it all poured right out of me.\\\" Kurstin also played bass, guitar, drums, piano and keyboards on \\\"Hello\\\", which reached number one in 28 countries.”\\n\\n    Here he is “playing around” on a Moog: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_hmDtSVL7Y>\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633565370,\"title\":\"links + kidney donations\"},\"digest\":\"Eo4F0-BnTsETVMyXPq3UdETwte7FYExhXICBWh1wgIs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x87E386cEdb82CF8F080b3505ADaE1eF699e65057\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ExhLEetYB62ONMhhGsLDMOkVgieibIEQ1zzMO0fIGP4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"i1C56p50NVLlfSHayWOYk3l3HApWXQUOdftAYuPgEZE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"6vZSavnFJp4_OIq2aYZyibrutzrhGvKsj9j2Qp9ZFrmj0Hk93vTgAjgA4GBjKYDQATdvvTpTHVpGRG_sMR-qHA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x26aeec6d2ea406e2652d3d2d441ce25dd0ac27358128359190aefe52ad7428cf62fc7ab05017a59832484f7604d0bd8f12993174b42fd6f1e1be707aebc9c27b1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ExhLEetYB62ONMhhGsLDMOkVgieibIEQ1zzMO0fIGP4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"i1C56p50NVLlfSHayWOYk3l3HApWXQUOdftAYuPgEZE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Eo4F0-BnTsETVMyXPq3UdETwte7FYExhXICBWh1wgIs\"}"
