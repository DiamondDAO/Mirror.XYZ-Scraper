"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"üö¢  **Ship30for30** (3/30)\\n\\ntldr: I‚Äôm exploring web3 business models by creating one for golf.xyz, a decentralized application that allows golfers to track their handicap.\\n\\nI recently enrolled in a program called Ship30for30. The goal is to ship 30 essays in 30 days. These are short, \\\\~250 words, and designed to help you think concisely and get into a habit of publishing daily. The program recommends that you use a tool called Typeshare. Typeshare is a simple to use, social blogging tool. It‚Äôs nice. But today I wanted to post a picture, and it wouldn‚Äôt let me do that. So here I am. Every once in a while, I‚Äôll compile [my shorter thoughts](https://typeshare.co/g/jeremyolken) into a longer form piece here.\\n\\n## Background\\n\\nOriginally, I wanted to explore technology, culture, and the implications of web3. It hit me that it might be easier to do so through the lens of a specific business. I thought for a minute and realized that there aren‚Äôt many mature web3 native consumer businesses. So, instead of analyzing one, let‚Äôs build one over the course of 30 days.\\n\\nNot all centralized services will be replaced by decentralized ones, but there are certain characteristics that make some of them prime for disruption. Tracking your golf handicap certainly fits the mold and we‚Äôll dive deeper into why in a further piece.\\n\\nWith that said, we‚Äôre going to create golf.xyz, a dApp and DAO tool that allows golfers to track their handicaps. Maybe we‚Äôll even bring it to life.\\n\\n## The Inspiration\\n\\nThe idea was inspired by Chris Dixon‚Äôs, [Come for the tool, stay for the network](https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network). In it, he lays out a strategy for bootstrapping a network by ‚Äúattracting users with a single-player tool and then, over time, get them to participate in a network‚Äù. The tool provides initial utility, gathering a critical mass of users, and the network helps to shape the product and create long-term value.\\n\\n## Where we‚Äôre going\\n\\nOver the next 27 days, I‚Äôm going to build out the business model and dev plans for golf.xyz. In the process, we‚Äôre going to explore all aspects of the web3 and golf ecosystems. Based on the functionality of our application, here‚Äôs a rough outline.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/samDEPz413VSxvkGq2NLw.jpg?height=540&width=960)\\n\\nWithin each of those sections, I‚Äôll give a brief overview and discuss what the implications are on golf.xyz. Most of these will happen in shorter form on my Typeshare blog. Once I feel there‚Äôs enough to fill in a comprehensive piece of the puzzle, I‚Äôll come back here.\\n\\nIn 27 days, I‚Äôll have a fully baked plan and might even launch a crowdfund to get this thing off the ground. I‚Äôll dive into why you would want to be a part of that crowdfund when we talk about NFTs.\\n\\n## Speaking of NFTs\\n\\nIf you‚Äôre a golfer, you know how important having a handicap is. It allows you to play in sanctioned tournaments, establishes your strokes gained in league play, and serves as a way to identify yourself among other players.\\n\\nWith golf.xyz, you will be able to display your handicap in the comfort of your wallet. And that‚Äôs just the start. Holding the Handicap NFT acts as your entrance into the world of golf in web3. This isn‚Äôt so crazy when you realize that your current handicap, held by local golf clubs, allows you to play in leagues and tournaments.\\n\\nAnd that‚Äôs just the surface-level implications. There‚Äôs so much to explore and I‚Äôm excited to dive in. See you all in a few days.\",\"timestamp\":1634003826,\"title\":\"Exploring Web3 Business Models by Creating One\"},\"digest\":\"5x9GAfa8bzPebRk1oyqsGpF7bUDxw1Qo3SmGseB4ZYQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9256812d06f6F1D0ACC6A676131965Aad11f8727\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"YfzgUfOUMbMClxxMins6g01Of5iOECi-f1OMSb-h3FA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mb8s-grUxP9ojA-mX1kzLu4YKA6P0B24EbRcTpqndow\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"OTSppwrvHgKgiHGp9utmht4cK_WK8B0AALkx05LzthLRHeG_sdcqcAZj_41HAQenVRfsp6bvwPA_659lbePT-g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1d3d58b84450746c7003af3bb8eede2e82291577c113689c74c848e68853420522b632f5a09ccb575c4c5854030b9210530847ecb4629fde75520bc371ccc4071b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"YfzgUfOUMbMClxxMins6g01Of5iOECi-f1OMSb-h3FA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mb8s-grUxP9ojA-mX1kzLu4YKA6P0B24EbRcTpqndow\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"spAN9FgIGSaNYrZKG5FCJ0TspcgxaTvkWrid6-BIn6Q\"}"
