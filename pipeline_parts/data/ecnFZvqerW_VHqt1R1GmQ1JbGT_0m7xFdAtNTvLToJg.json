Twitter has been operating at <http://www.twitter.com> since July 2006. As a social network, users can send \\\"tweets\\\" - a short tweet of no more than 280 characters (previously 140 characters) - to \\\"followers\\\" (i.e., users who sign up to receive tweets) via email and text. Twitter users can follow other individuals, businesses, media, government or nonprofit entities through the website or mobile app.\\n\\nOn July 14 and 15, 2020, hackers attacked Twitter. the timing of this hack resulted in a loss of nearly $120,000 to users. However, the hackers who caused this security incident used only the \\\"dumbest scams.\\\" The security incident was divided into three phases: the first phase involved entering the Twitter network through a social engineering attack; the second phase involved taking over accounts with desirable usernames and selling access to those accounts; and the third phase involved taking over dozens of high-profile Twitter accounts and trying to trick people into sending bitcoins to the hackers.\\n\\nTo many, the root cause of the incident was the \\\"centralization\\\" of the web2 network. Twitter was responsible for maintaining an internal account management tool to manage issues related to Twitter user accounts. Twitter issued usernames and passwords to authorized employees to access the internal account management tool.\\n\\n![BBC News](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XgZKCs7xLyY6txo5rtWZQ.png?height=848&width=886)\\n\\nWith the explosion of the meta-space concept, Web 3.0 has officially entered the realm of the average user. Although there are many different views on Web 3.0 in the industry, these are not the issues we want to discuss here. Compared with web 2.0, web 3.0 has the following characteristics :\\n\\n* unified authentication system\\n* data authorization and licensing\\n* privacy protection and anti-censorship\\n* decentralized operation\\n\\nFor the current problems of the Internet, such as the need to register accounts repeatedly, service providers abuse user privacy data, network companies use user data for profit, network services can not continue, etc., the above four tags can be used individually or in combination as a solution to Web 3.0 .\\n\\nAfter all this nonsense, let's get back to the main topic of today's discussion : [Orbis](https://orbis.club).\\n\\nOrbis can be called the decentralized Twitter of the Web 3.0 era. it has all the characteristics of Web 3.0 : It uses cramic's did authentication, requires wallet authorization to log in, is anonymous, and operates completely decentralized .\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0cT9vx-N80UftRtVa3zaG.png?height=224&width=653)\\n\\nThe first time you log in and click connect, it will connect your wallet and read your DID information. If you don't have a DID, a new one will be generated for you . If you don't know what a DID is, you can refer to the introduction about [Ceramic](https://mirror.xyz/effectchen.eth/y0BnRaJzMVGVeQzFPINFOhp34eF8gc-uEC069OdYx1I) :\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BXAo1vY5Vwk1ZyhbILnR2.png?height=400&width=1467)\\n\\nOrbis operates highly similar to Twitter, post tweets, RT, etc., and even has a Group feature.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2lapu5GhhjJc_AG95c0nZ.png?height=466&width=959)\\n\\nAs a product of web 3.0, it is certainly not just a copy so simple, it also has its own characteristics:\\n\\n**As a blockchain product, you can see the NFTs you hold and select one as a PFP (currently only NFTs from the main network are supported).**\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_qQN5v6yO354f-Gta_SkB.png?height=489&width=651)\\n\\n**You can edit your posts on Orbis (Twitter is not willing to add this feature).**\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SQVaOOCC7BAeTcPrQQ_QA.png?height=489&width=718)\\n\\n**All interactions can be seen on the ceramic network .**\\n\\nOrbis is currently in development beta and has already attracted many kol and certified celebrities/agencies to participate. More new features will be coming gradually, so join in the fun.\",\"timestamp\":1640590809,\"title\":\"Blockchain technology is being integrated into the real world -Orbis  (Tools section)\"},\"digest\":\"oQSYtnPXwuOV3ErTA8RoapYOT5yTKw4i3NQkPzXmIos\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd1a5b91957530E1B3e9cfac1543467C60c352F69\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"UE1cQQISd9JQpdGZNGv13eY60WOGPa2K1Hi5mta09dk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"tnYxis2sfMpJboobhF2gnS2KE4J-VRPn9CzYJ8TWdnM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"-cZl-AS5wl1xhvncFi7ETBneYmrNgGtRaOSc4e72kH8ewaJpF9EtPmZPrzdtBpy8WZIXl2l0-9-SdILmndniXA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x66de2d32ed9ef125e4f1a185a28f9ab9a6497674db2c7f0db7648a53487c32c6465b8b94310d222dc4a41bb670125130de75c88194ece2f5a4880fc6bc6e1fcb1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"UE1cQQISd9JQpdGZNGv13eY60WOGPa2K1Hi5mta09dk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"tnYxis2sfMpJboobhF2gnS2KE4J-VRPn9CzYJ8TWdnM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"3GIZiJK5E-zVVSvuQ8ENNQNmUFEaN2BOoQDCZaRlEps\"}"
