Solana’s first of eight innovations pillars\\n\\n# Briefing\\n\\nSOLANA ecosystem has taken the blockchain world by storm, bringing some amazing innovations which empower SOLANA to achieve performance and security like never before.\\n\\nSOLANA also solves the blockchain trilemma: Decentralisation, Scalability, and Security.\\n\\nSolana’s innovative approach is organised into eight pillars, which we’re going to learn as described in the following articles.\\n\\n1. Proof of history\\n2. Tower BFT\\n3. Turbine\\n4. Gulf Stream\\n5. Sea Level\\n6. Pipelining\\n7. Cloudbreak\\n8. Archivers\\n\\nNow let’s watch a different episode. Let’s jump right into the SOLANA’s eight innovations.\\n\\n# First Innovation: PROOF OF HISTORY\\n\\nWe already learned about two Consensus Methods used in blockchains nowadays, right? In SOLANA’s blockchain, we use Proof of Stake as this method offers a more democratic and fairer way for the validators as compared to Proof of Work.\\n\\nUnfortunately, both methods share a common bottleneck. Time synchronisation among validators when reaching consensus.\\n\\nSolana fixes this using a pre-consensus approach, called Proof of History.\\n\\nLet’s visit Springfield and learn about it.\\n\\nImagine that Marge needs to take Bart to a medical appointment. Before going to a specific medical facility, Marge needs to use a universal take-a-number system common to all medical facilities, to prove she scheduled her appointment at a specific point in time.\\n\\nAs Marge now has a ticket with her number, she called a call center and was told to drive to the medical facility “A”. She then drives for ten minutes until she gets there.\\n\\nWhen she arrives, she notices two more people in the waiting room already.\\n\\nDespite those two people having arrived earlier, the receptionist calls Marge asking for her proof of appointment (with the time it was issued).\\n\\nOnce Marge presents it, the receptionist allows Bart and Marge to enter the clinic immediately.\\n\\nThis system allows all the patients to be ordered by their timestamp despite the time of arriving at a medical facility, at different times. It also allows them to be redirected to the next medical facility based on the knowledge of which patients’ tickets are treated by each facility avoiding unnecessary waiting time.\\n\\nThat’s Proof of History in SOLANA’s blockchain. It’s a way to avoid unnecessary waiting time for external actors’ confirmation to achieve consensus as there’s a decentralized clock guaranteeing ordering of events.\\n\\nProof of history represents the attachment of a unique cryptographic timestamp into the transaction, generated by a VDF (verifiable delay function), meaning that each transaction itself carries a time record registering that this transaction happened in a specific point in time, thus easily verifiable and able to be ordered.\\n\\nWhen this transaction goes to a validator, the validator doesn’t need to communicate with any external sources to know when the transaction happened, he just needs to look at the timestamp and order the transactions, exactly as the receptionist ordered the patients in Springfield. Each validator has its own internal “clock”, thus avoiding dependency on external confirmations.\\n\\nAnother huge advantage of SOLANA Proof of Stake is based on the deterministic approach on leader election. All validators know beforehand who’s the next leader validator.\\n\\n**SUMMARY**: This high-level analogy explains one of the main innovation on Solana’s blockchain.\\n\\n# About the Author\\n\\nHey, my name is Jonathan Ferreira, and I’m a software developer in constant evolution, seeking knowledge acquiring and sharing.
