"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### TLDR: the minting process is not random. I suspect the team might have used this information their advantage to snatch rare NFTs (door with white background).\\n\\n### \\n\\n**What is the issue here ?**\\n\\nThe door is not being generated randomly. The team, as well as anyone who dig into the code, could predict with 100% accuracy in advance which door is rare (white door) and which door is common(black door).\\n\\nSince the team is well-aware of the issue, they have the ability to snatch most of the white doors.\\n\\n**Could you tell me what is the next white door to be minted?**\\n\\nYes. The next one #7332, the next next one to be minted is #7456 etc.\\n\\n**Can you be more specific on how this is achieved?**\\n\\nLet’s take a look at the project’s smart contract: <https://etherscan.io/address/0xf4794aEB9D243c024cf59B85b30ed94F5014168a#code>\\n\\nIf we look at this line under StringifyDoor.sol file, we can see that we input the token id to a random function to decide whether a white door shall be minted.\\n\\n```\\n    /* White background color */\\n    if ((random(string(abi.encodePacked(toString(tokenId)))) % 100) < 1) {\\n        tokenType = 1;\\n        background = 'white';\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nBut when we take a look at the “random” function, we can see there is no randomness in this “random” function at all.\\n\\n```\\nfunction random(string memory input) internal pure returns (uint) {\\nreturn uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(input)));\\n```\\n\\nTherefore whether the door has white background is completely determined by the tokenID. We could calculate in advance which token ids will produce a white door.\\n\\n**How can the team exploit this?**\\n\\nSince the token ids are assigned in order, the team could basically monitor the transaction and wait until someone mints door 7330, and then mint the next two doors to guarantee minting a white door.\\n\\n**What should I do?**\\n\\n* Stop minting doors since the floor is low ( current token index it at 7243 the next \\\\~80 mints is not going to produce any white doors.\\n* Request for a response from the team. I highly suspect whether they would apologize.\\n\\n**Have you communicated with the team?**\\n\\nYes, I tried contacting the team about the issue and hope they would do something reasonable. They brushed it off as ”this is intended” and argue that this is how blockchain work.\\n\\nThen after some explanation  I ask whether they would stop minting and be transparent to the door holders about the issue,  “Man we already discussed this issues inside a long time ago, just don’t mint a do a better collection. Thank you and good luck.”\\n\\n**Why did you choose to expose this?**\\n\\nFor justice, and for the team’s poor attitude. It is obvious that the team is aware of the bug and they refuse to do anything or at least be transparent about it. They wouldn’t even stop the minting.\\n\\nThe reason I initially suspect there is something wrong with the code and the team is taking advantage of the bug is that the seem to be holding handful of white doors(they had held white door raffles) but I wasn’t sure at the time.\\n\\n**Did you profit from the vulnerability?**\\n\\nNo! If I plan to then I would not publicize this.\\n\\nI reach out team immediately once I discover the bug. As a early door holder, I hope they could apologize to the holders and fix the issue in the future project for long term success.  (Also to be honest I was initially also hoping to get a tiny amount of bounty for discovering the issue and proposing a solution. )\",\"timestamp\":1638045754,\"title\":\"Stringify(Door) NFT project scam alert , why should you all stop minting \\n\"},\"digest\":\"zzQfFCfuzs_FeMs23TECwYmlmOsy0n83C7aaL0uUOqU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0BAd01F047A912a6a64d616C736BbB789295DD6e\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"B4lqebWCJLVz1nonQtyfVnZjaAxfnphuRVb-xhdnLNk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ndl0oECDVEUSYJmqQLyDQQwyte6rHDHEaAMsr0F8A0o\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"pbiiGDgK4i9KgpMfdqoWarQLfYRzlWOlmzaAk3Lk0il69nfFeioPMoq8CX9BZqsHjtuJo4tNVqUYDI5_kNRiSA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xff64c597fb47db8d4b954418cdd744a65153e4084bc1dd7de0efe13b0050d6b8469ccda467fcc087002bbee14401d7cec4bf92d6a7f3d1b80b8b4366f434d6401c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"B4lqebWCJLVz1nonQtyfVnZjaAxfnphuRVb-xhdnLNk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ndl0oECDVEUSYJmqQLyDQQwyte6rHDHEaAMsr0F8A0o\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"zzQfFCfuzs_FeMs23TECwYmlmOsy0n83C7aaL0uUOqU\"}"
