"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"***“An investment in knowledge pays the best interest” - Benjamin Franklin***\\n\\nThe following is an article based on Stan Druckenmiller’s presentation which you can find [here](https://vimeo.com/548917378). \\n\\nStan is a legend among investors, having been in the industry for over 45 years, and running Duquesne Capital for 29 years, closing the fund with 12billion dollars. \\n\\nI have learned an enormous amount from Stan’s presentation, and I have done my best to summarise the most important parts for you. \\n\\n**The Unprecedented Decline**\\n\\nIt should not come as a surprise to any of you, that the last 18months have been completely unprecedented. There is no prior recession or economic event that comes close to what we saw last year. The US saw 5x the decline of the average recession - in only 25% of the time. The decline in economic activity was both violent and abrupt, which called for an equivalently aggressive monetary and fiscal policy response from the Fed.\\n\\nThey didn't hold back.\\n\\nIn just 3 months, the Government deficit increased more than the last 5 recessions combined. Think the GFC, the dot-com bubble, the '90s recession, and the two recessions prior. Add them all up and they still do not equal what was done in just ***3 months.*** In fact, the Fed's incredible response to the economic shutdown meant that they did more QE in 6 weeks, than was done in the ***entire*** period from '09 - '18 following the GFC.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/X3_77ixVHLe8smshvbK6O.png?height=406&width=736)\\n\\nNow due to the unprecedented nature of the pandemic and the effect on economies around the world, the response actually makes a lot of sense. However, what is surprising is that the Fed is doubling down on these policies, even after what seemed like a sharp and strong recovery.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/px9bEx5d9vC6wq5xYlBJK.png?height=431&width=699)\\n\\nThe unemployment rate has recovered 70% from the initial hit in only 6months. It has typically taken 25months for this to happen. So the question is; why is the Fed still continuing to purchase 120billion dollars in securities per month, after such an incredible recovery in the workforce?\\n\\nDruckenmiller points out that it is \\\"unnecessary and frankly reckless, that 575bil. of the 850bil in direct transfer of 2.5T of expected QE, has come *after* retail sales were above pre-Covid trends and after vaccine confirmation\\\"\\n\\nThe question is, why continue with such a heavy-handed response when unemployment has recovered so dramatically, and retail sales are 15% above trend?\\n\\nThis is of course making asset managers and investors very well off. The incredible amount of stimulus bolsters asset prices in virtually every sector and makes people like Druckenmiller a lot of money. His criticism carries a lot of weight, as those who will get hurt by inflation will not be the investors, but those without any assets.\\n\\n> \\\"put simply - the fastest and strongest recovery from any post-war recession, is being met with the feds easiest response on record - by a mile.\\\"\\n\\n# **Financial Stability**\\n\\nThe worst economic periods in the last century, have followed the bursting of asset bubbles. Think of the '30s after the '29 bubble, or the GFC after the housing bubble burst.\\n\\nWith a meme-coin (the doge) worth 60b and NFT's selling for millions of dollars, is there any doubt that we are in a bubble? Not to mention stock market to GDP is sitting well above any level we've seen in the last century.\\n\\nThen there is the concern of the potential loss of reserve currency status.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/otCICQ0CG9BLMKqfgl06D.png?height=380&width=676)\\n\\nUS treasuries have typically been the go-to assets for global portfolio managers for the better part of 20 years. They've been sought as a safe haven in so-called - 'risk off' periods. Look at the above diagram, after the GFC in '09.\\n\\nThe steep sell-off in 2020 should come as a surprise then. Foreigners have sold 1T worth of bonds following the initial stimulus of the CARES Act. Portfolio managers have been looking at Chinese assets, as they have done no QE, and had very little drop in their GDP.\\n\\nChina currently represents 20% of world GDP, but only 1.6% of global portfolios. The US represents 25% of world GDP, but 28% of portfolios.\\n\\n> For the first time in my career, I think that we will lose this reserve currency status and all the benefits that come with it - in the next 15 years. I've never said this before, I've never even thought it before, at present there is no alternative because of the lack of trust in the communist dictatorship in China, and the mess that Europe currently is. I don't know who going to replace us, but if I have to guess is the biggest threat is going to be a crypto-derived ledger system, invented by a group from an army of engineers leaving university.\\n\\nFollowing all this reasoning, Druckenmiller is short the dollar and long all sorts of commodities - copper, grain, oil. He says, \\\"If it moves, we're long it\\\".\\n\\n# **Investing Advice**\\n\\nNever ever think in the present - try to envisage what the world will look like 12-18 months ahead.\\n\\nWhat creates price movement? Change. Big change. With all the disruption happening in the world economy, if you look at the macro picture, this presents the most fruitful set of opportunities I've ever seen, in terms of the magnitude of change.\\n\\n# **Bitcoin**\\n\\nI think it will be a ledger system that requires a cryptocurrency to execute it, as the lion's share of great engineers from universities are moving into cryptocurrency. Millennials and more importantly, tech billionaires prefer Bitcoin to gold. BTC has been around 13-14 years now, it's a brand, and it's not going away. I wouldn't doubt that Bitcoin continues to move higher.\\n\\n# **On Inequality**\\n\\n\\\"I don't think there has been any greater engine of inequality than the federal reserve bank, of the last 11 years... I've just had the best year I've had in 15 years last year - everyone wealthy I know is making a fortune. And why are we making it - because this guy is printing money like there's no tomorrow. For the life of me, I can't figure out why the left is so excited about money printing.\\n\\nThe people that benefit from money printing are the rich people who know how to navigate that.\\n\\nThis thing, looking out 12-18 months, is going to take one of two paths. As you can tell by my portfolio I'm betting on inflation. When you grow the money supply by 25% for a year. It's just historically correct, and we have a whole generation who haven't seen it for 10-12 years - so they can't even deal with the concept. Chairman Powell, says we're not going to have inflation because it hasn't been persistent and it hasn't been around. But what the hell, we didn't have inflation between 55-70 for 15 years! If you went by that we couldn't have had inflation but then we had the 70s and guns and butter - and what I just showed you is about 5x guns and butter!\\n\\nI think the odds-on bet is we are going to have inflation - and inflation will hurt poor people much more than rich people.\\\"\\n\\nDruckenmiller makes solid arguments for his case that we will see inflation. Historically it fits, we're seeing enormous increases in asset prices that signal a bubble, and the money supply has been increased dramatically. It's a wonder why Chairman Powell is continuing with such an irresponsible response until you remember where most of the money is going - into assets. Inequality is increasing dramatically as those with assets get richer, and the poor get screwed by inflation.\\n\\nOf course, only time will tell. However, you can be sure that we will look back on this time as completely unprecedented in both the economic shock and the accompanying response.\\n\\n> I hope its not ever repeated. I don't know how it's going to end, but it's going to end badly. I just don't know when.\",\"timestamp\":1634092460,\"title\":\"Legendary Investor Stan Druckenmiller - Inflation & The Fed\"},\"digest\":\"wxu_k27h7qqmOjdd_AopNLjrb9ho0goq-VRIl3Y01A8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3c6f739fC6153446eC6Ca71bc483cAF1F59dC70a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ppZWQaystC4rsUYWy-UnlbXHOmGLNBy45D57qAfZ1cM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"nIe3x9OOYHHtlXCNVBs1rQQsK69to_wFCGGU0Jo8-wI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"4_9h9Yc5imQGTePaGKbegjMBRKPHaYnLYf7l7uiyT_m5QXBP1KwS73loNLsJ8C6eEZW_UX1jziWRJ4t2z3Qvtg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xcd19f917fe912d1d3b93fa82c04e78e93d8d5353d727cbde44b0b215a98532a146e7937d70775e948b5ce8b84420c08c82c310bac949d9466b7f88694250c2911c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ppZWQaystC4rsUYWy-UnlbXHOmGLNBy45D57qAfZ1cM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"nIe3x9OOYHHtlXCNVBs1rQQsK69to_wFCGGU0Jo8-wI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wxu_k27h7qqmOjdd_AopNLjrb9ho0goq-VRIl3Y01A8\"}"
