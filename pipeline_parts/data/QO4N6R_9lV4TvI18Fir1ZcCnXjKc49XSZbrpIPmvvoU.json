And my point is that when you gain control over how your potential customers experience your own product, that is thanks to a proper [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/) [strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/business-strategy/).\\n\\nAs a quick example, imagine that you have a store that runs entirely on top of Amazon. Or perhaps you have a media company that runs all through YouTube. While you enjoy incredibly large platforms that can bring your message and product out there, you don’t control them.\\n\\nThus, you have amplification but little control over your [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/). Indeed, if for some reason Amazon brings down your store your [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/) is gone. If YouTube kills your channel, your [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/) is gone.\\n\\nConversely, imagine you have built e-commerce by using a [platform ](https://fourweekmba.com/platform-business-models/)like WordPress, Shopify, BigCommerce, or whatever, you still rely on external channels to amplify your products. And even if amplification might be more limited, if you lose a traffic channel to your store, the store itself will still be accessible.\\n\\nSo, based on this consideration, let’s break down [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/) into three general categories:\\n\\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/VgCGA4ye4nmJpPQhcMYrrqsxQw4xgJb7w7MV021etoDF1skM_BPRHomtpmBcmol0cTzi9-9jkQ2XmQoag7BiG_1Xw_qPQkHTWfHydN9eeV0uFCon-r-53xlRBprg7HG6QumLp9Zl)\\n\\nBy Gennaro Cuofano – FourWeekMBA\\n\\n* **Owned**: You have higher control and less amplification (imagine the case you just built your brand new website, but you have zero traffic).\\n* **Hybrid**: You balance control and amplification (imagine the scenario of e-commerce built on Amazon but as an addition to an e-commerce website. Thus, you use Amazon only as an additional channel to amplify your products, but you still have your main e-commerce as a separate domain).\\n* \\\\*\\\\*Third-party/non-owned: \\\\*\\\\*Here you optimize for reach but you have zero control. In short, you have to adapt to the way the hosting [platform ](https://fourweekmba.com/platform-business-models/)markets itself if you want to sell your own product. Imagine the case where you only have e-commerce on top of Amazon, where the [platform ](https://fourweekmba.com/platform-business-models/)optimizes for variety and convenience. This means that Amazon will be incentivized to show as many similar products as yours, thus enabling easy price comparison and less and less differentiation. In this case, you need to play by the house’s rules (getting as many reviews as you can, bring the price down, sell as many products as possible) and you will make substantial money if you will be able to play by these rules.\\n\\nIn short, in owned [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/), it’s harder to build It in the short-term (you need to invest substantially before it pays off). But once in place gives you more control over the way potential customers perceive your product, thus differentiating and charging at a premium.\\n\\nAs it’s an expensive [strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/business-strategy/), that is why many [growth](https://fourweekmba.com/growth-hacking/) strategies start by using other people’s platforms. Think of how in the early years Google surfed AOL, PayPal surfed eBay, Airbnb surfed Craigslist and more current examples of how a company like Thras.io is surfing Amazon.\\n\\nBack to the remote control now.\\n\\n## **How did Netflix end up on your remote control?**\\n\\nDrawing from what we said so far, a solid [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/) [strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/business-strategy/) is a sweet spot between product and [marketing](https://fourweekmba.com/marketing-strategy/) and it bridges them up. You gain more control over your messaging, you make your product more visible, and you add a feature to your service.\\n\\nBut how did Netflix perhaps manage to be on your remote control? This integration started in 2011, when Netflix announced its one-click feature to be added to various remote controls’ brands.\\n\\nAs the press release of the time[ announced](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/streaming-from-netflix-will-soon-be-even-more-convenient-with-netflix-one-click-remotes-introduced-by-major-consumer-electronics-makers-112860669.html):\\n\\n*“For members who want even more convenience when instantly watching TV shows and movies streaming from Netflix, the answer is about to be right in their hands,” said Netflix Chief Product Officer Neil Hunt.  “No more turning on the TV, going to a home screen and searching for the Netflix icon.  With the Netflix one-click remote, it’s simply a matter of pushing the Netflix button to instantly watch any of the vast selection of TV shows and movies available to stream from Netflix.”*\\n\\nThis [strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/business-strategy/) well paid off over the years, and as Netflix further highlighted at the time:\\n\\n*The Netflix one-click remote is the latest in a series of rapid technological advancements by Netflix to enable Netflix members to instantly watch TV shows and movies streamed by Netflix over the Internet.  Today there are more than 250 Netflix ready devices on the market.*\\n\\nIt’s hard to know the specifics of the deals between Netflix and these device makers. We can assume that wasn’t cheap at all. However, again being on a remote control meant not only to brand to millions of people but also to make Netflix easily accessible to them.\\n\\nAs per[ some accounts](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/4/24/21232655/netflix-button-tv-remotes-advertisement-marketing-streaming), these deals might have cost Netflix as much as $1 per button for each customer.\\n\\nWe can also go as far as understanding how much Netflix spent at the time, in 2011 when it started to build up this [strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/business-strategy/).\\n\\nApparently, by 2011 financial statements, as Netflix rumped up its [marketing](https://fourweekmba.com/marketing-strategy/) expenses It also did the same for the remote control partnerships where the company recorded a  “$17.4 million in domestic spending related to \\\\[Netflix\\\\] consumer electronics partners, as \\\\[Netflix\\\\] continued to expand the number of devices on which subscribers can view Netflix content.”\\n\\nTherefore, in 2011 alone Netflix spent over $17 million to set up this [strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/business-strategy/). And it worked so well that pretty much anyone in the space followed suit.\\n\\nBack to the [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/) [strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/business-strategy/). What did we learn here?\\n\\n## **Distribution as the bridge between product and [marketing](https://fourweekmba.com/marketing-strategy/)**\\n\\nWhile in the short term it’s fine to leverage sales as a way to kick off [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/). Over time, especially for [platform ](https://fourweekmba.com/platform-business-models/)business models, you want to really think through these strategies that pay off big time by bridging product and [marketing](https://fourweekmba.com/marketing-strategy/). So let’s keep in mind the [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/) between just sales and really generating [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/). The first will get your next client through the door. The latter will lead to building the channel that brings you potentially many other clients to the door.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*But how does [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/) work across various business models? \\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nThe interesting thing about business development is that while each industry has its own logic, the ways you can grow your business through it do not change as much. And the type of [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/) you will pick for your business will also depend on the type of [business model ](https://fourweekmba.com/what-is-a-business-model/)you’re operating in.\\n\\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uFFqF50ijwPDgHp-BOyAmQG7s3qVqRu8dG7X1Zh7h4P-FCTxIMmgBgb42Y1GrP2zidkacBgoXTGBwzy5CfXaC5v-rpSthIed9gT_zD0d0vvZ8A1TL-XD3JpeMWc8QC4G8HNMvZuu)\\n\\nBy Gennaro Cuofano – FourWeekMBA\\n\\nIf you’re running a linear business, where, for instance, most of its aspects are tied to a simple physical product then funnel [marketing](https://fourweekmba.com/marketing-strategy/) might work for you. When you start building a digital business, where the customer-facing part of it is digital, then flywheel [marketing](https://fourweekmba.com/marketing-strategy/) works for you.\\n\\nBelow the main difference:\\n\\n![sales-funnel](https://i0.wp.com/fourweekmba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sales-funnel.png?resize=1024%2C772&ssl=1)\\n\\nThe sales funnel is a model used in [marketing](https://fourweekmba.com/marketing-strategy/) to represent an ideal, potential journey that potential customers go through before becoming actual customers. As a representation, it is also often an approximation, that helps [marketing](https://fourweekmba.com/marketing-strategy/) and sales teams structure their processes at scale, thus building repeatable sales and [marketing](https://fourweekmba.com/marketing-strategy/) tactics to convert customers.\\n\\nWhen you are building a [platform ](https://fourweekmba.com/platform-business-models/)business model, then you need to think in terms of the ecosystem. So, how do you kick off the [network effects](https://fourweekmba.com/network-effects/) to make this ecosystem grow? This is the question that you need to keep asking. And the result of it is what we can call a “business platform” or a place that combines hardware and software, to enable an ecosystem made of various key players (physical builders/manufacturers, digital builders/developers, channel partners/distributors, enterprise customers/enablers, and consumers).\\n\\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/UMjL1txwgSNX1ze4wa13_M6FkxBSVmgeUiJVi8qSgmsypKSaX8tG5TwNE2RV6kb4C4IhrlQ_d7ehgccVwFtTn20_a_G761mk5kUngcBY8FOuiM01UUvulhNI6zi22KJ3n4uLD9oj)\\n\\nThat’s all about [distribution](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/)!\\n\\n**Read Next: [Netflix Business Model](https://fourweekmba.com/how-does-netflix-make-money/), [Distribution Channels](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/), [Marketing vs. Sales](https://fourweekmba.com/marketing-vs-sales/), [Business Development](https://fourweekmba.com/business-development/),**\\n\\n**Main Free Guides:**\\n\\n* [Business Models](https://fourweekmba.com/what-is-a-business-model/)\\n* [Business Strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/business-strategy/)\\n* [Business Development](https://fourweekmba.com/business-development/)\\n* [Digital Business Models](https://fourweekmba.com/digital-business-models/)\\n* [Distribution Channels](https://fourweekmba.com/distribution-channels/)\\n* [Marketing Strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/marketing-strategy/)\\n* [Platform Business Models](https://fourweekmba.com/freemium-business-model/)\\n* [Revenue Models](https://fourweekmba.com/revenue-models/)\\n* [Tech Business Models](https://fourweekmba.com/tech-business-model/)\\n* [Blockchain Business Models Framework](https://fourweekmba.com/vbde-framework/)\",\"timestamp\":1633533175,\"title\":\"What's Distribution? - FourWeekMBA\"},\"digest\":\"lQTMv0RmBG84pSMcUbKwT4Ojd6ca20hnKHWCAbz7jwE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x358AdC5f4939f6d851F4427C09d823c7dfd86322\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"CzFkahrGv6iNs_8vdmfCdum5Ar2u9l9SN1iYHA81u0Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"RoSwDr1SyqxZkqMQSw6BQWCaNYqLeLeYzFacp-5hRQk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"nc9AlAwBvkrXTYFv_9kegrO06rxCZ8E5Rv-KIsuXakxOh3FzWZ_8e3xNsBi3CRIQTwNzEp2V_hHK-vFTTk_Jcg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe2ef859c4169db7c0cba26da4a5719a97cb8b73b7afde19c32487b45bc96199579546b82707394c8dbf9dbfc6a18c17e43ea77665fc5a32c93a66189dd329d361b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"CzFkahrGv6iNs_8vdmfCdum5Ar2u9l9SN1iYHA81u0Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"RoSwDr1SyqxZkqMQSw6BQWCaNYqLeLeYzFacp-5hRQk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"lQTMv0RmBG84pSMcUbKwT4Ojd6ca20hnKHWCAbz7jwE\"}"
