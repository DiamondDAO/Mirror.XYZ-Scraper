"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"#### a few interesting conversations…\\n\\nI’d like to take the time in the following notes to outline a few interesting conversations I’ve seen play out over the past few weeks between some of the… lets call them “*key players in the space.”* I want to focus my notes around their differing ideologies concerning “web3” and the importance of - or perhaps more aptly put - the existence of actual decentralization within the space; and present it in the context of how at Peatix we can approach these concepts in our own way. \\n\\n#### Jack / a16z\\n\\nNow with all internet beefs, rumor begets rumor begets rumor begets rumor and so on… so let me preface the following by saying that I do not **totally** remember (nor have) all the facts about how this back and forth was sparked, but the gist of it (**which is the important part**) was that…\\n\\nJack Dorsey announced that he would be stepping down as Twitter’s CEO (on November 29th, 2021) to focus more as CEO of Square and to integrate Square’s platform more with blockchain and enable more crypto payment options. Square has recently changed its name to “Block” - planting its flag on the proverbial crypto hill similarly to how Facebook had recently done with its name change to “Meta”, claiming the Metaverse as its own. \\n\\n[https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-changes-name-to-block](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-changes-name-to-block)\\n\\nI do not believe it was any secret that in the years prior and very recently before his departure, Jack had been very supportive of Bitcoin. So to most, it seemed a very natural transition for him to depart Twitter to focus on crypto - and in step, the \\\"web3 community” became very excited about having the support of Jack now fully onboard. \\n\\nWith the backstory now in place, let’s take a look at how the following narrative unfolded… \\n\\nJack, to much of the displeasure of the “web3 community”, started to really separate himself from the web3 space and to align much more with Bitcoin (and only Bitcoin) through some of his recent tweets. \\n\\n* Apologies to those of you reading who are thinking, “what is the difference - isn’t this all crypto and isn’t that all the same?”… \\n* You’re right, and it’s a great question, but we should point out there are actually many differences between the different blockchains, like the one that supports Bitcoin and the one that supports Ethereum. \\n* (There are many many different blockchains that sometimes get gelled together and are referred singularly as the phrase “blockchain” - but they are all different!)\\n* So for now, let’s think of blockchains that were designed to be used to develop applications (like Ethereum’s) as those supporting “web3”. And it is very common to associate the “web3 community” and Ethereum hand in hand. \\n* Bitcoin’s blockchain differs though; when it was initiated 13 years ago, it had something akin to an immaculate conception and adoption - as true to its design, it became a (pretty/very) decentralized entity and supported a real currency alternative -  Bitcoin. \\n\\nThere are some in the crypto space who believe only (in absolutes) that Bitcoin, due to its more decentralized nature and organic conception and adoption, is the only blockchain that should be supported and that it will eventually outlast all of the others. These people are referred (lovingly) as *Bitcoin Maximalist*s. \\n\\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-maximalism.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-maximalism.asp)\\n\\nNow before we veer off topic completely and start going down a rabbit hole of intense crypto ideology, lets pause and try to surface the key point the Bitcoin Maximalists (that Jack was expressing) value; which is that they can claim that the Bitcoin blockchain, and NOT any of of the web3 blockchains is actually **decentralized**. \\n\\nJack goes on to explicitly express that unlike the Bitcoin Blockchain, many of the web3 blockchains, applications and services are (while they are seemingly set up to be “decentralized”) actually being run by Silicon Valley VCs - specifically Andreesen Horowitz (a16z). \\n\\nFor the past few years and in the past year specifically, VC investment into the crypto space has massively accelerated… \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/88GAwILTRxTnszIj10E53.png?height=784&width=1258)\\n\\nWhile this seemingly is a positive overall for the potential success of crypto related projects, it does draw at a very existential dilemma for the web3 space… These questions can not be avoided \\n\\n* are these blockchains actually decentralized? \\n* if these project’s are being presented as solutions only due to their decentralized nature - are they legitimately solving any problems that legacy web2 platforms can’t address? \\n* is the altruistic moment of the “web3 movement”, and the positive social externalities it could bring, being wasted by the VC consolidation of “web3 influence”…?\\n* even if the information is decentralized on a blockchain, if it is being presented by a centrally architected front end application is it providing any new solution? \\n* does any of this even matter ha? \\n\\nThe reason why many like Jack have these concerns, is that unlike a typical venture backed company, many of the web3 companies / foundations that are building blockchains are set up as “decentralized entities” that require governance token to make decisions. On the basic level, these structures would prohibit any one entity from gaining a large influence in guiding the direction of the infrastructure of the project (like Bitcoin did). However, what we’ve observed VCs to do is actually buy up massive shares of these governance tokens which would allow them to co-opt the actual architecture of the blockchains that web3 is trying to be “decentrally” built upon. ***Concisely put, even if the infrastructure of web3 is designed with decentralization in mind, if one entity has a controlling interests in all of the decentralized points that make up the ecosystem - you’ve really just created a new way to centralize a singular sphere of influence and agenda.*** \\n\\nThe case and point being the actions of a16z, which if you’ve used any of the “popular” web3 services you’ve been using a company that they’ve backed. \\n\\n[https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473139010197508098?s=20](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473139010197508098?s=20)\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473380683896737813?s=20](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473380683896737813?s=20)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1642153239,\"title\":\"dealing in absolutes...
