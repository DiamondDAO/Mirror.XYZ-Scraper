"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\n　　Please forgive me because I’m not talking about the popular song here. I really love that song, though! What I want to bring to you people here is something I’d like to discuss with.\\n　　Love is indeed a big concept. Thus it makes some people confused or feel blur. As I have mentioned before in this forum, I don’t even differ “love” from “like” sometimes. Can you?\\n　　I know nobody who doesn’t want his life filled with love. One is/has been/will be receiving love from his parents, relatives, friends, colleagues, lovers and whatsoever living creatures, including animals. Fully enjoying love from around me is what I always long for. How happy and joyful I would be if I could have love everywhere in this planet!\\n　　Love conquers everything in human’s world. The more civilized and developed a country is, the more love you will see in there. I saw many charity organizations in Singapore and Canada, and I believe there must be many in other developed countries. There is, however, so few in China. Even though there are some similar organizations in China, I’m afraid they are not doing their jobs.\\n\\nThe most popular case we can see in China is Leukemia. I have all along been donating money to those patients, since I was a student. I just feel that’s the only way I can use to help them.\\n　　The other case is raised by baggers, who are wandering in the streets all the time. They are everywhere in the cities. They are annoying sometimes, because they would even pull your pants to hold you back if you refuse to give them cashes. I pay more respect to those who would rather go collecting rubbishes at nights than being criminals to steal or rob, or commit whatever bad things against the local citizens. Once a 80 over years old woman was seen lying on the side of a road. I saw her too, for several times. She seldom bagged for money, she wanted foods and clothes more than cashes. Each time I passed by, I would give her 10 Yuan, not for pitying her, but do what I could to be of help. She died one year later. I was sad when I heard the news because I couldn’t imagine what kind of children she had would abandon their parents! She must be very sad and desperate when she left her home; she must be tough and strong to survive in such a big cold city alone for years; she must be thinking about something before her death; she must be…\\n　　If there is another life for this wretched poor woman after her death, I hope she would have a much better life by then. May her soul rest in peace.\",\"timestamp\":1639398086,\"title\":\"Love, love, love\"},\"digest\":\"tdQce5mjKoF8GPUoLH_OMaqPX4vqzuepAmkV-GRZCtE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xc7c8Fa917D383cBc649ea2C6397A5ad9456F60C9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rFdtqJfghk_St2S9HeJpDTJ54qlmbhFmZAZD9v-wWCg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4mNWbcQHUgks9_PNTPjADAzeXXFf2UkLISmPCelyt8E\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"UKI4CYCYAND3GYjKHHeDi59_y27R6tMiCqrbg9zhldm3llu3qBliMORateemnWJtf90_YV9Vdao0IjcACmMDZQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x263eaba9efc27e0ecc495b40ac309819bd00c6b58daace1c412de513f861d58d3b32873f7ebfca7527a0bfad5367e0de68136265be433b8cd6e9b71a61e7ba181c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rFdtqJfghk_St2S9HeJpDTJ54qlmbhFmZAZD9v-wWCg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4mNWbcQHUgks9_PNTPjADAzeXXFf2UkLISmPCelyt8E\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"tdQce5mjKoF8GPUoLH_OMaqPX4vqzuepAmkV-GRZCtE\"}"
