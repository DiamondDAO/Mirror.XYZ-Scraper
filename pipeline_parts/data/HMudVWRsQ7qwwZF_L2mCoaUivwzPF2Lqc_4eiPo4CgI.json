We believe that they are not willing to see such a big change in the political structure of the region.Fourthly, the sanjiang and Tiannan counties could be ordered to mobilize military forces to cooperate with the central government in putting pressure on the Majikhans.Fifth, order all customs to immediately stop exporting to the Majikhans such military strategic materials as grain, medicine, cloth, weapons and armor.In addition, your Majesty may send a special envoy to the Khanate of Maki to negotiate with Bishili and Lei Kyotian.\\\"He Zhiqiu at one go, his response plan to come clean.\\n\\nHe Zhiqiu this plan immediately won the unanimous support of almost all present ministers, Situ Mingyue also satisfied nodded, \\\"very good, He Aiqing, your plan is very realistic, I agreed, everything is handled according to your opinion, the departments immediately arranged deployment, not by mistake.In addition, I will appoint Inoraka (Vice Foreign Minister of the Empire) as our special envoy to visit Makhikhan at once.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough scattered toward the meeting, but he Zhiqiu did not put down the heart of stone, Lei Jue day is not mediocre, before action must also consider all aspects, since dare to implement, that he must also want to deal with the possible consequences, only go step by step.\",\"timestamp\":1635744964,\"title\":\"SiTuMingYue\"},\"digest\":\"0KDtSad1eGJ__zRvQ1C9VUMaMagRusyio2avENYAiZ4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9FB1c8b6196E5dEAC9ABb2A59CccB4e3D08DE271\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"QYORTvIL2aRwatWDT5e_m6NEc0a_f-ICAAwIWq0EchY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"V6jyJxcJsS9g4euvNRP1Owvo-hUESRg8RI2GNnHD4x4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"s_WxsMLSQg5cuJhTZkFswcC4zHmMLLlxiWIYKaBIRSI8ET8E4nBoUsASbBRL2JfJMtbuORHrMeMEfLuu-VwcuA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc1408b3d99aa6189cd13d507ca892fb6b62c0a76e9590ea04973b374310b57125ff6b76e6c89c76ba5db85a598120697512b8efd5a28fba63d2bc9ddbb533dd01c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"QYORTvIL2aRwatWDT5e_m6NEc0a_f-ICAAwIWq0EchY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"V6jyJxcJsS9g4euvNRP1Owvo-hUESRg8RI2GNnHD4x4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"0KDtSad1eGJ__zRvQ1C9VUMaMagRusyio2avENYAiZ4\"}"
