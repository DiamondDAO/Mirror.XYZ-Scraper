"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"How am I going to change it?\\\" said the other, glowering at Coleman. \\\" That's the way it ought to be. How am I going to change it? That's the way it ought to be.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" No, it isn't at all,\\\" said Coleman. \\\"You've got a spar sticking out of the main body of the drawing in a way that will spoil the look of the whole page.\\\"\\n\\nThe artist was a man of remarkable popular reputation and he was very stubborn and conceited of it, constantly making himself unbearable with covert, threats that if he was not delicately placated at all points, he would freight his genius over to the office of the great opposition journal.\\n\\n\\\" That's the way it ought to be,\\\" he repeated, in a tone at once sullen and superior. \\\"The spar is all right. I can't rig spars on ships just to suit you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" And I can't give up the whole paper to your accursed spars, either,\\\" said Coleman, with animation. \\\" Don't you see you use about a third of a page with this spar sticking off into space? Now, you were always so clever, Jimmie, in adapting yourself to the page. Can't you shorten it, or cut it off, or something? Or, break it-that's the thing. Make it a broken spar dangling down. See? \\\"\\n\\n\\\" Yes, I s'pose I could do that,\\\" said the artist, mollified by a thought of the ease with which he could make the change, and mollified, too, by the brazen tribute to a part of his cleverness.\\n\\n\\\" Well, do it, then,\\\" said the Sunday editor, turning abruptly away. The artist, with head high, walked majestically back to the other room. Whereat the curly-headed one immediately resumed the rain of paper balls upon him. The office boy came timidly to Coleman and suggested the presence of the people in the outer office. \\\" Let them wait until I read my mail,\\\" said Coleman. He shuffled the pack of letters indifferently through his hands. Suddenly he came upon a little grey envelope. He opened it at once and scanned its contents with the speed of his craft. Afterward he laid it down before him on the desk and surveyed it with a cool and musing smile. \\\"So?\\\" he remarked. \\\" That's the case, is it?\\\"\\n\\nHe presently swung around in his chair, and for a time held the entire attention of the men at the various desks. He outlined to them again their various parts in the composition of the next great Sunday edition. In a few brisk sentences he set a complex machine in proper motion. His men no longer thrilled with  admiration at the precision with which he grasped each obligation of the campaign toward a successful edition. They had grown to accept it as they accepted his hat or his London clothes. At this time his face was lit with something of the self-contained enthusiasm of a general. Immediately afterward he arose and reached for his coat and hat.\\n\\nThe office boy, coming circuitously forward, presented him with some cards and also with a scrap of paper upon which was scrawled a long and semicoherent word. \\\" What are these ? \\\" grumbled Coleman.\\n\\n\\\"They are waiting outside,\\\" answered the boy, with trepidation. It was part of the law that the lion of the ante-room should cringe like a cold monkey, more or less, as soon as he was out of his private jungle. \\\"Oh, Tallerman,\\\" cried the Sunday editor, \\\"here's this Arctic man come to arrange about his illustration. I wish you'd go and talk it over with him.\\\" By chance he picked up the scrap of paper with its cryptic word. \\\" Oh,\\\" he said, scowling at the office boy. \\\"Pity you can't remember that fellow. If you can't remember faces any better than that you should be a detective. Get out now and tell him to go to the devil.\\\" The wilted slave turned at once, but Coleman hailed him. \\\" Hold on. Come to think of it, I will see this idiot. Send him in,\\\" he commanded, grimly.\\n\\nColeman lapsed into a dream over the sheet of grey note paper. Presently, a middle-aged man, a palpable German, came hesitatingly into the room and bunted among the desks as unmanageably as a tempest-tossed scow. Finally he was impatiently towed in the right direction. He came and stood at Coleman's elbow and waited nervously for the engrossed man to raise his eyes. It was plain that this interview meant important things to him. Somehow on his commonplace countenance was to be found the expression of a dreamer, a fashioner of great and absurd projects, a fine, tender fool. He cast hopeful and reverent glances at the man who was deeply contemplative of the grey note. He evidently believed himself on the threshold of a triumph of some kind, and he awaited his fruition with a joy that was only made sharper by the usual human suspicion of coming events.\\n\\nColeman glanced up at last and saw his visitor.\\n\\n\\\" Oh, it's you, is it ? \\\" he remarked icily, bending upon the German the stare of a tyrant. \\\"So you've come again, have you? \\\" He wheeled in his chair until he could fully display a  contemptuous, merciless smile. \\\"Now, Mr. What's-your-name, you've called here to see me about twenty times already and at last I am going to say something definite about your invention.\\\" His listener's face, which had worn for a moment a look of fright and bewilderment, gladdened swiftly to a gratitude that seemed the edge of an outburst of tears. \\\" Yes,\\\" continued Coleman, \\\" I am going to say something definite. I am going to say that it is the most imbecile bit of nonsense that has come within the range of my large newspaper experience. It is simply the aberration of a rather remarkable lunatic. It is no good;  it is not worth the price of a cheese sandwich. I understand that its one feat has been to break your leg; if it ever goes off again, persuade it to break your neck. And now I want you to take this nursery rhyme of yours and get out. And don't ever come here again. Do You understand ? You understand, do you ?\\\" He arose and bowed in courteous dismissal.\\n\\nThe German was regarding him  with the surprise and horror of a youth shot mortally. He could not find his tongue for a moment. Ultimately he gasped : \\\"But, Mister Editor \\\"--Coleman interrupted him tigerishly. \\\" You heard what I said? Get out.\\\" The man bowed his head and went slowly toward the door.\\n\\n[ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/123](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/123)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638785913,\"title\":\"It's going to take up half a page.
