"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"DAO - Decentralized Autonomous Organization \\n\\nI have been reading articles and blog posts on DAO for the couple of past months and I would like to define DAO as the digital renaissance that would empower authorities of the citizens, nations or ordinary people. I believe DAO is revolutionary in that, even though there is still language barrier, this could build a new concept of the world we would be living in the future. Instead of the limited countries inside the 6 continents, unlimited number of DAOs would be leading the next generation.  \\n\\nIt is a governed by the people who has the governance token inside the community. The governance token unlike the current voting system has no age, nationality limit. Instead you need money to gain the tokens. But there are other routes to gain the tokens, you can earn other coins through P2E games to swap the coins that could be staked and exchanged to the tokens that you need. \\n\\nFor the past decades, I have felt that the democracy system is falling apart. For instance, in Korea, president election will be taking place in April. Currently there are top 2 candidates who are competing against each other. Both of the candidates have several convicts of being guilty. However, they are not being charged with because of the lack of evidence or the fear of being retaliated if one of the candidate to become the next president. They are not applicable to be the candidates. Besides these candidates, there are a lot of congressmen who are not eligible.  \\n Not only the qualification standard of the candidates, but also the election promises are hard to read or understand. When it comes to web3.0 projects, especially games there is the white paper which provides the rule, goals, road map of the project. There are lot of people and even I am not fully aware of these candidates’ slogans or commitments. It’s kind of a popularity vote or a competition of who does better marketing campaigns. \\n\\nI strongly believe that through DAO we could solve this problem. I am rather on par with the weak anarchist. It’s the people, we who are living in this country and just like DAO, we should have the right to suggest certain agenda to put on vote and pass that vote. Of course, when DAO is worked as a governance system in the country, everyone should start with equal amount of tokens. As we live our life, the tokens would be staked according to the guidelines made in the DAO. For instance, every year 5 tokens are staked, but if you have committed a crime then your tokens are taken away and your convictions are listed in the blockchain system. Annually or every quarter people could suggest new agendas and they are put to a vote in that DAO system. \\n\\nThis is a very simply simulated idea that I had thought of. I think DAO is the replacement of democracy. Just like the Renaissance period in the 14th century, I strongly believe we are at the forefront of the Second Renaissance period. \",\"timestamp\":1641459606,\"title\":\"about DAO\"},\"digest\":\"GfDfA0aqV9yNIo3Zg_b687_hw0yAamrI1rVlLln7xnc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xec2Fe3c4Bc6628D91366f9F72b5BCEABcf8b1B90\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MfSLFKJrNpAD520_GKvbdyOgZ3mAIBmy0Xalw_1lyG8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8OudxxBvf6521eUeJhyGqI9toJbloMyOfRWaGtrVf5s\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"-FGn_SNwKd4xqSRITfD9Iem7yC0_fGqVQT9NFGWl5a_-w5s60hZcZr7LWPiTTSkeQbhOcfnNlR6Uc8Ig4jcRog\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x591431b444b4909b83692796b949e90097d8ced7f72854c498050c02e49045da0f5132a63f62b51881e90500ee60019fa95dc244756c1b3021fcce06ab970de91c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MfSLFKJrNpAD520_GKvbdyOgZ3mAIBmy0Xalw_1lyG8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8OudxxBvf6521eUeJhyGqI9toJbloMyOfRWaGtrVf5s\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"GfDfA0aqV9yNIo3Zg_b687_hw0yAamrI1rVlLln7xnc\"}"
