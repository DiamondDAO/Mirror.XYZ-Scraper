"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"I will keep this,\\\" said she; and as soon as she had covered the\\n\\nbody again with the earth and leaves, she took the head and a little\\n\\nsprig of jasmine that bloomed in the wood, near the spot where he\\n\\nwas buried, and carried them home with her. As soon as she was in\\n\\nher room, she took the largest flower-pot she could find, and in\\n\\nthis she placed the head of the dead man, covered it up with earth,\\n\\nand planted the twig of jasmine in it.\\n\\n```\\n\\\"Farewell, farewell,\\\" whispered the little elf. He could not any\\n```\\n\\nlonger endure to witness all this agony of grief, he therefore flew\\n\\naway to his own rose in the garden. But the rose was faded; only a few\\n\\ndry leaves still clung to the green hedge behind it.\\n\\n```\\n\\\"Alas! how soon all that is good and beautiful passes away,\\\"\\n```\\n\\nsighed the elf.\\n\\n```\\nAfter a while he found another rose, which became his home, for\\n```\\n\\namong its delicate fragrant leaves he could dwell in safety. Every\\n\\nmorning he flew to the window of the poor girl, and always found her\\n\\nweeping by the flower pot. The bitter tears fell upon the jasmine\\n\\ntwig, and each day, as she became paler and paler, the sprig\\n\\nappeared to grow greener and fresher. One shoot after another sprouted\\n\\nforth, and little white buds blossomed, which the poor girl fondly\\n\\nkissed. But her wicked brother scolded her, and asked her if she was\\n\\ngoing mad. He could not imagine why she was weeping over that\\n\\nflower-pot, and it annoyed him. He did not know whose closed eyes were\\n\\nthere, nor what red lips were fading beneath the earth. And one day\\n\\nshe sat and leaned her head against the flower-pot, and the little elf\\n\\nof the rose found her asleep. Then he seated himself by her ear,\\n\\ntalked to her of that evening in the arbor, of the sweet perfume of\\n\\nthe rose, and the loves of the elves. Sweetly she dreamed, and while\\n\\nshe dreamt, her life passed away calmly and gently, and her spirit was\\n\\nwith him whom she loved, in heaven. And the jasmine opened its large\\n\\nwhite bells, and spread forth its sweet fragrance; it had no other way\\n\\nof showing its grief for the dead. But the wicked brother considered\\n\\nthe beautiful blooming plant as his own property, left to him by his\\n\\nsister, and he placed it in his sleeping room, close by his bed, for\\n\\nit was very lovely in appearance, and the fragrance sweet and\\n\\ndelightful. The little elf of the rose followed it, and flew from\\n\\nflower to flower, telling each little spirit that dwelt in them the\\n\\nstory of the murdered young man, whose head now formed part of the\\n\\nearth beneath them, and of the wicked brother and the poor sister. \\\"We\\n\\nknow it,\\\" said each little spirit in the flowers, \\\"we know it, for\\n\\nhave we not sprung from the eyes and lips of the murdered one. We know\\n\\nit, we know it,\\\" and the flowers nodded with their heads in a peculiar\\n\\nmanner. The elf of the rose could not understand how they could rest\\n\\nso quietly in the matter, so he flew to the bees, who were gathering\\n\\nhoney, and told them of the wicked brother. And the bees told it to\\n\\ntheir queen, who commanded that the next morning they should go and\\n\\nkill the murderer. But during the night, the first after the\\n\\nsister's death, while the brother was sleeping in his bed, close to\\n\\nwhere he had placed the fragrant jasmine, every flower cup opened, and\\n\\ninvisibly the little spirits stole out, armed with poisonous spears.\\n\\nThey placed themselves by the ear of the sleeper, told him dreadful\\n\\ndreams and then flew across his lips, and pricked his tongue with\\n\\ntheir poisoned spears. \\\"Now have we revenged the dead,\\\" said they, and\\n\\nflew back into the white bells of the jasmine flowers. When the\\n\\nmorning came, and as soon as the window was opened, the rose elf, with\\n\\nthe queen bee, and the whole swarm of bees, rushed in to kill him. But\\n\\nhe was already dead. People were standing round the bed, and saying\\n\\nthat the scent of the jasmine had killed him. Then the elf of the rose\\n\\nunderstood the revenge of the flowers, and explained it to the queen\\n\\nbee, and she, with the whole swarm, buzzed about the flower-pot. The\\n\\nbees could not be driven away. Then a man took it up to remove it, and\\n\\none of the bees stung him in the hand, so that he let the flower-pot\\n\\nfall, and it was broken to pieces. Then every one saw the whitened\\n\\nskull, and they knew the dead man in the bed was a murderer. And the\\n\\nqueen bee hummed in the air, and sang of the revenge of the flowers,\\n\\nand of the elf of the rose and said that behind the smallest leaf\\n\\ndwells One, who can discover evil deeds, and punish them also.\",\"timestamp\":1636531433,\"title\":\"I will keep this,\\\" said she; and as soon as she had covered the\\nbody again with the earth and leaves\"},\"digest\":\"hB9UF9fyUplrFgJTjXm_n5ESjv_H2INuLVWq1ahu6xE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8918151a07B96D518Ab70C61e4091FfA62e25A17\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tGXb0_gY0JSZktdQSvSXTNC67TyW8O-2ngQKjv-6Qak\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wEqfIoFrn-f-Y_64FC3M1RZzCdocCF2jVCEwFVWy0tY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"9sCOgGhG4SBT3c2mC1A6EyXokrAApTxFKDOkcPot4yHLZFTHp4i3nPOKs3-8CD_MT8gBU0D3qQVfldWRZB7tLg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1d0070b3d71460522c9fef6c88b79f7074cfae0e0c715cda41e6999a0d02a29b705fd62c19372523f43bbe911bd30f899c0a56dfaaf5bbac2c28b1ba4e1878171c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tGXb0_gY0JSZktdQSvSXTNC67TyW8O-2ngQKjv-6Qak\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wEqfIoFrn-f-Y_64FC3M1RZzCdocCF2jVCEwFVWy0tY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"hB9UF9fyUplrFgJTjXm_n5ESjv_H2INuLVWq1ahu6xE\"}"
