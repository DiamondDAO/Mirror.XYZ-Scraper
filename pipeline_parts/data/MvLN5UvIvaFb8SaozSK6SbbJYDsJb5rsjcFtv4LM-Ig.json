"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"It’s going down. \\n\\nOn Monday May 3 2021, the first three songs ever created at Songcamp will be released to the public. \\n\\nTwo weeks ago, a group of 9 talented strangers came together and created 3 absolutely insane, fantastic, weird, eclectic, beautiful songs. At the same time, a group of visual artists and project operatives formed to support the visual art and rollout plan of said music. \\n\\n**This coming Monday, all of that collectively created art is coming your way.**\\n\\nHere’s the plan...\\n\\n## 3 Songs. 3 NFTs. Monday.\\n\\nFirst, all 3 bands will mint their freshly-created songs as 1/1 NFTs on [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/). \\n\\nThe 3 NFTs will go on auction here via Mirror’s Reserve Auction. The auctions will open on Monday May 3rd at 5pm ET.\\n\\nThe winning bids from these three auctions will be split amongst the musicians, visual artists, project operatives, and Songcamp’s treasury. We are using Mirror’s Splits tool in order to instantaneously and trustlessly split all auction proceeds to their rightful recipient. *To see this breakdown in action, scroll down to the Split blocks below.* \\n\\nBecause Mirror, Catalog, and the Zora protocol take zero transaction fees, **100% of the funds from these three NFT auctions flow directly to those involved in the project**. \\n\\nThat is not a point to be taken lightly. Artists have often been stripped of their right to directly realize the value of their work. Here, we are dipping our toes into the paradigm-shifting waters of what Zora calls an Internet Renaissance. \\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/matthewchaim/status/1388112619484155910?s=20\\n\\n## The Songs \\n\\n**“Static Twist” by Lunar Veil**\\n*The Lunar Veil is Thys, Hvdson and Samsonite*\\n\\nA nocturnal dissociative narrative, twisting through sharp corners, from low fidelity analog machines to maximalistic digitalistic bordering the hystericalistic, via a strictly mature age appropriate noise fetish, carrying the naive hope to bring it all home in one piece.\\n\\n**“Hold On Hope” by Driftwood TX**\\n*Driftwood TX is Gavin Slate, Kevin Paris and Rowan Spencer* \\n\\nDriftwood: shaped by rough waters, wind, light and shadow. Driftwood TX: a place where lakes can sing at night and the sound reverberates in caves and off walls of stone. Three itinerant strangers meet there to capture these songs at that moment when the fire burns at its lowest but the first sign of sunrise shows.\\n\\n**“Antid0t3” by Rainbow Punch**\\n*Rainbow Punch is MAiWORLD, Snacks.xyz and Matthew Chaim*\\n\\nSmashing sounds together in a multi-coloured kaleidoscope of subconscious dreams, sure to kick your socks off and send you sprinting up the honey-covered hills of the cartoon world that we're pulling you into.\\n\\n## The Splits\\n\\nThe following are the split blocks that will be plugged into the 3 NFT auctions opening on Monday May 3 2021. Each one is broken down amongst the contributors to each specific song + the project as a whole. \\n\\nOur musicians are denoted above in the “Songs” section. The visual team consists of Peace Node and Gian Ferrer. The project operatives are Quiet Theory and Mark Redito. And lastly the Songcamp treasury. \\n\\n[\\\"Static Twist\\\" by The Lunar Veil](split://0xD5a7f09d6DeAadB11Bb23d4d59622CC74736a476?network=mainnet)\\n\\n[\\\"Hold On Hope\\\" by Driftwood TX](split://0x142Ca9EDac4726B4BB6c5Bb0451eFC1D88F32bb4?network=mainnet)\\n\\n[\\\"Antid0t3\\\" by Rainbow Punch](split://0x5183Ee697C9BA7f70D6913C5fE4c26C9544b9840?network=mainnet)\\n\\n## A few notes:\\n\\n### 1) NFT Auction Flow + The Creator Fee Routing \\n\\nThe creator fee — which will be setup on Catalog’s front-end at the time of minting and thus baked into the zNFT — is set at 25% for each of these songs. The creator fee will also be shared by all contributors in the same relative proportions as above. \\n\\nCurrently, the Zora protocol does not support the separation of a Creator Fee from the Creator’s wallet. This means that the creator fee will go directly to the wallet that minted the NFT. Because of this, our plan is as follows: once the auction closes and the creator fee flows into the band’s wallet, that wallet will manually send the creator fee to its respective Split block address. This way, all 100% of the auction proceeds will end up in that song’s Split. Entire flow illustrated below: \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/34f3762b-69b9-4ffd-b811-00b07556d18f.jpg?height=459&width=800)\\n\\n### 2) Is Songcamp an open protocol?\\n\\nWe spoke at length about what Songcamp’s role is, and what cut if anything the treasury should receive. We played with the idea of Songcamp being this “lower layer” that spins up collectives, and the participants within each collective receiving all proceeds resulting from the creations. \\n\\nIn that way we start to see two distinct layers here: \\n\\n1) the Songcamp base “protocol” layer, and; \\n2) this first sprint within Songcamp \\n\\nRight now, in that this is the first project, those two layers feel pretty flush. And to keep things simple, we concluded on a share of 10% of each auction to go towards the Songcamp treasury and its future projects. \\n\\nThat said, we are excited to continue this conversation. We ask for your thoughts, participation and feedback as we navigate through this experiment.\\n\\nCome get involved, would ya?
