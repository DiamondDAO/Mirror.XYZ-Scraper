"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Cointelegraph: How are you making the donations secure to reach their intended charitable organizations?**\\n\\n**Alex Wilson:** We were intentional in the way we set this up so that all the donations from a donor always go directly to a charity’s wallet. Now, we aren’t a pastor or anything like that, so it’s always going directly to the charity’s wallet. And on the back end, they have institutional accounts with Gemini. That way, they don’t have to worry about, you know, managing their private keys and things like that. They use a custody solution of Gemini through us.\\n\\n**CT: Was there a major theme this year regarding donations?**\\n\\n**AW:** I mean, it’s normalized to be a little bit of everything in terms of the theme. We see all sorts of different types of charities, also different sizes. We work with a lot of local charities, but also national, international brands. So, a little bit of everything really. I wouldn’t say there’s one group or one type of nonprofit that’s getting more donations than others. But I would say some of the larger charities tend to do pretty well, like some of the name brands that you might recognize, like Save the Children or American Cancer Society — you know, names like that. They tend to do a really good job fundraising. Or groups like St. Jude. They’re good at fundraising donations in general, so they tend to be better at fundraising crypto as well.\",\"timestamp\":1639036479,\"title\":\"What is the volume of donations you saw this year, and how does it compare with previous years?\"},\"digest\":\"ETOjCcq33urqWm3v6SIXDe0E6Xvsvl6NDo8V8hZdfhs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xAb18d8A9809642a9AdB4DB4E9ac0081a4ff92A14\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-xIEIDLUTMJ19HTPC_b0IqbF3CXQOFbVSnJbQpn0vtk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"K5pgRneQ4thFtQnuSzAvFuqkf51szkEM8ozQPBryF-k\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"zD_IOUTMzzAbw4fS4lRPXGhB_lRceAnehGL6aAdUq1iKc23jrCDKganHXRakxjHgqEqR6uiHJcNghDUoeU6QpA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x6de522188119d58c00f21a1e95ed4811c36bbcb112383430948fa1076770f4a25afcf041fe9de967bfd02e97cdeebe78e768aec771fada25690bf3c07ff384031b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-xIEIDLUTMJ19HTPC_b0IqbF3CXQOFbVSnJbQpn0vtk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"K5pgRneQ4thFtQnuSzAvFuqkf51szkEM8ozQPBryF-k\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ETOjCcq33urqWm3v6SIXDe0E6Xvsvl6NDo8V8hZdfhs\"}"
