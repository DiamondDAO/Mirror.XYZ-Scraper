"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"How I loathed that load of obligation at first!  I don't deserve the happiness that has come to me.\\\"\\n\\nGilbert laughed and clasped tighter the girlish hand that wore his ring.  Anne's engagement ring was a circlet of pearls.  She had refused to wear a diamond.\\n\\n\\\"I've never really liked diamonds since I found out they weren't the lovely purple I had dreamed.  They will always suggest my old disappointment .\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But pearls are for tears, the old legend says,\\\" Gilbert had objected.\\n\\n\\\"I'm not afraid of that.  And tears can be happy as well as sad.  My very happiest moments have been when I had tears in my eyes-- when Marilla told me I might stay at Green Gables--when Matthew gave me the first pretty dress I ever had--when I heard that you were going to recover from the fever.  So give me pearls for our troth ring, Gilbert, and I'll willingly accept the sorrow of life with its joy.\\\"\\n\\nBut tonight our lovers thought only of joy and never of sorrow.  For the morrow was their wedding day, and their house of dreams awaited them on the misty, purple shore of Four Winds Harbor.\\n\\nCHAPTER 4\\n\\nTHE FIRST BRIDE OF GREEN GABLES\\n\\nAnne wakened on the morning of her wedding day to find the sunshine winking in at the window of the little porch gable and a September breeze frolicking with her curtains.\\n\\n\\\"I'm so glad the sun will shine on me,\\\" she thought happily.\\n\\nShe recalled the first morning she had wakened in that little porch room, when the sunshine had crept in on her through the blossom- drift of the old Snow Queen.  That had not been a happy wakening, for it brought with it the bitter disappointment of the preceding night. But since then the little room had been endeared and consecrated by years of happy childhood dreams and maiden visions.  To it she had come back joyfully after all her absences; at its window she had knelt through that night of bitter agony when she believed Gilbert dying, and by it she had sat in speechless happiness the night of her betrothal.  Many vigils of joy and some of sorrow had been kept there; and today she must leave it forever.  Henceforth it would be hers no more; fifteen-year-old Dora was to inherit it when she had gone.  Nor did Anne wish it otherwise; the little room was sacred to youth and girlhood--to the past that was to close today before the chapter of wifehood opened.\\n\\nGreen Gables was a busy and joyous house that forenoon.  Diana arrived early, with little Fred and Small Anne Cordelia, to lend a hand.  Davy and Dora, the Green Gables twins, whisked the babies off to the garden.\\n\\n\\\"Don't let Small Anne Cordelia spoil her clothes,\\\" warned Diana anxiously.\\n\\n\\\"You needn't be afraid to trust her with Dora,\\\" said Marilla.  \\\"That child is more sensible and careful than most of the mothers I've known.  She's really a wonder in some ways.  Not much like that other harum-scarum I brought up.\\\"\\n\\nMarilla smiled across her chicken salad at Anne.  It might even be suspected that she liked the harum-scarum best after all.\\n\\n\\\"Those twins are real nice children,\\\" said Mrs. Rachel, when she was sure they were out of earshot.  \\\"Dora is so womanly and helpful, and Davy is developing into a very smart boy.  He isn't the holy terror for mischief he used to be.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I never was so distracted in my life as I was the first six months he was here,\\\" acknowledged Marilla.  \\\"After that I suppose I got used to him.  He's taken a great notion to farming lately, and wants me to let him try running the farm next year.  I may, for Mr. Barry doesn't think he'll want to rent it much longer, and some new arrangement will have to be made.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, you certainly have a lovely day for your wedding, Anne,\\\" said Diana, as she slipped a voluminous apron over her silken array.  \\\"You couldn't have had a finer one if you'd ordered it from Eaton's.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Indeed, there's too much money going out of this Island to that same Eaton's,\\\" said Mrs. Lynde indignantly.  She had strong views on the subject of octopus-like department stores, and never lost an opportunity of airing them.  \\\"And as for those catalogues of theirs, they're the Avonlea girls' Bible now, that's what.  They pore over them on Sundays instead of studying the Holy Scriptures.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, they're splendid to amuse children with,\\\" said Diana.  \\\"Fred and Small Anne look at the pictures by the hour.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"*I* amused ten children without the aid of Eaton's catalogue,\\\" said Mrs. Rachel severely.\\n\\n\\\"Come, you two, don't quarrel over Eaton's catalogue,\\\" said Anne gaily.  \\\"This is my day of days, you know.  I'm so happy I want every one else to be happy, too.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm sure I hope your happiness will last, child,\\\" sighed Mrs. Rachel.  She did hope it truly, and believed it, but she was afraid it was in the nature of a challenge to Providence to flaunt your happiness too openly.  Anne, for her own good, must be toned down a trifle.\\n\\nBut it was a happy and beautiful bride who came down the old, homespun-carpeted stairs that September noon--the first bride of Green Gables, slender and shining-eyed, in the mist of her maiden veil, with her arms full of roses.  Gilbert, waiting for her in the hall below, looked up at her with adoring eyes.  She was his at last, this evasive, long-sought Anne, won after years of patient waiting.  It was to him she was coming in the sweet surrender of the bride.  Was he worthy of her?  Could he make her as happy as he hoped?  If he failed her--if he could not measure up to her standard of manhood--then, as she held out her hand, their eyes met and all doubt was swept away in a glad certainty.  They belonged to each other; and, no matter what life might hold for them, it could never alter that.  Their happiness was in each other's keeping and both were unafraid.\\n\\nThey were married in the sunshine of the old orchard, circled by the loving and kindly faces of long-familiar friends.  Mr. Allan married them, and the Reverend Jo made what Mrs. Rachel Lynde afterwards pronounced to be the \\\"most beautiful wedding prayer\\\" she had ever heard.  Birds do not often sing in September, but one sang sweetly from some hidden bough while Gilbert and Anne repeated their deathless vows.  Anne heard it and thrilled to it; Gilbert heard it, and wondered only that all the birds in the world had not burst into jubilant song; Paul heard it and later wrote a lyric about it which was one of the most admired in his first volume of verse; Charlotta the Fourth heard it and was blissfully sure it meant good luck for her adored Miss Shirley.  The bird sang until the ceremony was ended and then it wound up with one mad little, glad little trill.  Never had the old gray-green house among its enfolding orchards known a blither, merrier afternoon.  All the old jests and quips that must have done duty at weddings since Eden were served up, and seemed as new and brilliant and mirth-provoking as if they had never been uttered before.  Laughter and joy had their way; and when Anne and Gilbert left to catch the Carmody train, with Paul as driver, the twins were ready with rice and old shoes, in the throwing of which Charlotta the Fourth and Mr. Harrison bore a valiant part.  Marilla stood at the gate and watched the carriage out of sight down the long lane with its banks of goldenrod.  Anne turned at its end to wave her last good-bye.  She was gone--Green Gables was her home no more; Marilla's face looked very gray and old as she turned to the house which Anne had filled for fourteen years, and even in her absence, with light and life.\\n\\nBut Diana and her small fry, the Echo Lodge people and the Allans, had stayed to help the two old ladies over the loneliness of the first evening; and they contrived to have a quietly pleasant little supper time, sitting long around the table and chatting over all the details of the day.  While they were sitting there Anne and Gilbert were alighting from the train at Glen St. Mary.\\n\\nCHAPTER 5\\n\\nTHE HOME COMING\\n\\nDr. David Blythe had sent his horse and buggy to meet them, and the urchin who had brought it slipped away with a sympathetic grin, leaving them to the delight of driving alone to their new home through the radiant evening.\\n\\nAnne never forgot the loveliness of the view that broke upon them when they had driven over the hill behind the village.  Her new home could not yet be seen; but before her lay Four Winds Harbor like a great, shining mirror of rose and silver.  Far down, she saw its entrance between the bar of sand dunes on one side and a steep, high, grim, red sandstone cliff on the other.  Beyond the bar the sea, calm and austere, dreamed in the afterlight.  The little fishing village, nestled in the cove where the sand-dunes met the harbor shore, looked like a great opal in the haze.  The sky over them was like a jewelled cup from which the dusk was pouring; the air was crisp with the compelling tang of the sea, and the whole landscape was infused with the subtleties of a sea evening.  A few dim sails drifted along the darkening, fir-clad harbor shores.  A bell was ringing from the tower of a little white church on the far side; mellowly and dreamily sweet, the chime floated across the water blent with the moan of the sea.  The great revolving light on the cliff at the channel flashed warm and golden against the clear northern sky, a trembling, quivering star of good hope.  Far out along the horizon was the crinkled gray ribbon of a passing steamer's smoke.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, beautiful, beautiful,\\\" murmured Anne.  \\\"I shall love Four Winds, Gilbert.  Where is our house?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We can't see it yet--the belt of birch running up from that little cove hides it.  It's about two miles from Glen St. Mary, and there's another mile between it and the light-house.  We won't have many neighbors, Anne.  There's only one house near us and I don't know who lives in it.  Shall you be lonely when I'm away?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not with that light and that loveliness for company.  Who lives in that house, Gilbert?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know.  It doesn't look--exactly--as if the occupants would be kindred spirits, Anne, does it?\\\"\\n\\nThe house was a large, substantial affair, painted such a vivid green that the landscape seemed quite faded by contrast.  There was an orchard behind it, and a nicely kept lawn before it, but, somehow, there was a certain bareness about it.  Perhaps its neatness was responsible for this; the whole establishment, house, barns, orchard, garden, lawn and lane, was so starkly neat.\\n\\n\\\"It doesn't seem probable that anyone with that taste in paint could be VERY kindred,\\\" acknowledged Anne, \\\"unless it were an accident--like our blue hall.  I feel certain there are no children there, at least.  It's even neater than the old Copp place on the Tory road, and I never expected to see anything neater than that.\\\"\\n\\nThey had not met anybody on the moist, red road that wound along the harbor shore.  But just before they came to the belt of birch which hid their home, Anne saw a girl who was driving a flock of snow- white geese along the crest of a velvety green hill on the right.  Great, scattered firs grew along it.  Between their trunks one saw glimpses of yellow harvest fields, gleams of golden sand-hills, and bits of blue sea.  The girl was tall and wore a dress of pale blue print.  She walked with a certain springiness of step and erectness of bearing.  She and her geese came out of the gate at the foot of the hill as Anne and Gilbert passed.  She stood with her hand on the fastening of the gate, and looked steadily at them, with an expression that hardly attained to interest, but did not descend to curiosity.  It seemed to Anne, for a fleeting moment, that there was even a veiled hint of hostility in it.  But it was the girl's beauty which made Anne give a little gasp--a beauty so marked that it must have attracted attention anywhere.  She was hatless, but heavy braids of burnished hair, the hue of ripe wheat, were twisted about her head like a coronet; her eyes were blue and star-like; her figure, in its plain print gown, was magnificent; and her lips were as crimson as the bunch of blood-red poppies she wore at her belt.\\n\\n\\\"Gilbert, who is the girl we have just passed?\\\" asked Anne, in a low voice.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't notice any girl,\\\" said Gilbert, who had eyes only for his bride.\\n\\n\\\"She was standing by that gate--no, don't look back.  She is still watching us.  I never saw such a beautiful face.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't remember seeing any very handsome girls while I was here.  There are some pretty girls up at the Glen, but I hardly think they could be called beautiful.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This girl is.  You can't have seen her, or you would remember her.  Nobody could forget her.  I never saw such a face except in pictures.  And her hair!  It made me think of Browning's `cord of gold' and `gorgeous snake'!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Probably she's some visitor in Four Winds--likely some one from that big summer hotel over the harbor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She wore a white apron and she was driving geese.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She might do that for amusement.  Look, Anne--there's our house.\\\"\\n\\nAnne looked and forgot for a time the girl with the splendid, resentful eyes.  The first glimpse of her new home was a delight to eye and spirit--it looked so like a big, creamy seashell stranded on the harbor shore.  The rows of tall Lombardy poplars down its lane stood out in stately, purple silhouette against the sky.  Behind it, sheltering its garden from the too keen breath of sea winds, was a cloudy fir wood, in which the winds might make all kinds of weird and haunting music.  Like all woods, it seemed to be holding and enfolding secrets in its recesses,--secrets whose charm is only to be won by entering in and patiently seeking.  Outwardly, dark green arms keep them inviolate from curious or indifferent eyes.\\n\\nThe night winds were beginning their wild dances beyond the bar and the fishing hamlet across the harbor was gemmed with lights as Anne and Gilbert drove up the poplar lane.  The door of the little house opened, and a warm glow of firelight flickered out into the dusk.  Gilbert lifted Anne from the buggy and led her into the garden, through the little gate between the ruddy-tipped firs, up the trim, red path to the sandstone step.\\n\\n\\\"Welcome home,\\\" he whispered, and hand in hand they stepped over the threshold of their house of dreams.\\n\\nCHAPTER 6\\n\\nCAPTAIN JIM\\n\\n\\\"Old Doctor Dave\\\" and \\\"Mrs. Doctor Dave\\\" had come down to the little house to greet the bride and groom.  Doctor Dave was a big, jolly, white-whiskered old fellow, and Mrs. Doctor was a trim rosy-cheeked, silver-haired little lady who took Anne at once to her heart, literally and figuratively.\\n\\n\\\"I'm so glad to see you, dear.  You must be real tired.  We've got a bite of supper ready, and Captain Jim brought up some trout for you.  Captain Jim--where are you?  Oh, he's slipped out to see to the horse, I suppose.  Come upstairs and take your things off.\\\"\\n\\nAnne looked about her with bright, appreciative eyes as she followed Mrs. Doctor Dave upstairs.  She liked the appearance of her new home very much.  It seemed to have the atmosphere of Green Gables and the flavor of her old traditions.\\n\\n\\\"I think I would have found Miss Elizabeth Russell a \\\\`kindred spirit,'\\\" she murmured when she was alone in her room.  There were two windows in it; the dormer one looked out on the lower harbor and the sand-bar and the Four Winds light.\\n\\n```\\n\\\"A magic casement opening on the foam     Of perilous seas in fairy lands forlorn,\\\"\\n```\\n\\nquoted Anne softly.  The gable window gave a view of a little harvest-hued valley through which a brook ran.  Half a mile up the brook was the only house in sight--an old, rambling, gray one surrounded by huge willows through which its windows peered, like shy, seeking eyes, into the dusk.  Anne wondered who lived there; they would be her nearest neighbors and she hoped they would be nice.  She suddenly found herself thinking of the beautiful girl with the white geese.\\n\\n\\\"Gilbert thought she didn't belong here,\\\" mused Anne, \\\"but I feel sure she does.  There was something about her that made her part of the sea and the sky and the harbor.  Four Winds is in her blood.\\\"\\n\\nWhen Anne went downstairs Gilbert was standing before the fireplace talking to a stranger.  Both turned as Anne entered.\\n\\n\\\"Anne, this is Captain Boyd.  Captain Boyd, my wife.\\\"\\n\\nIt was the first time Gilbert had said \\\"my wife\\\" to anybody but Anne, and he narrowly escaped bursting with the pride of it.  The old captain held out a sinewy hand to Anne; they smiled at each other and were friends from that moment.  Kindred spirit flashed recognition to kindred spirit.\\n\\n\\\"I'm right down pleased to meet you, Mistress Blythe; and I hope you'll be as happy as the first bride was who came here.  I can't wish you no better than THAT.  But your husband doesn't introduce me jest exactly right.  \\\\`Captain Jim' is my week-a-day name and you might as well begin as you're sartain to end up--calling me that.  You sartainly are a nice little bride, Mistress Blythe.  Looking at you sorter makes me feel that I've jest been married myself.\\\"\\n\\nAmid the laughter that followed Mrs. Doctor Dave urged Captain Jim to stay and have supper with them.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you kindly.  'Twill be a real treat, Mistress Doctor.  I mostly has to eat my meals alone, with the reflection of my ugly old phiz in a looking-glass opposite for company.  'Tisn't often I have a chance to sit down with two such sweet, purty ladies.\\\"\\n\\nCaptain Jim's compliments may look very bald on paper, but he paid them with such a gracious, gentle deference of tone and look that the woman upon whom they were bestowed felt that she was being offered a queen's tribute in a kingly fashion.\\n\\nCaptain Jim was a high-souled, simple-minded old man, with eternal youth in his eyes and heart.  He had a tall, rather ungainly figure, somewhat stooped, yet suggestive of great strength and endurance; a clean-shaven face deeply lined and bronzed; a thick mane of iron-gray hair falling quite to his shoulders, and a pair of remarkably blue, deep-set eyes, which sometimes twinkled and sometimes dreamed, and sometimes looked out seaward with a wistful quest in them, as of one seeking something precious and lost.  Anne was to learn one day what it was for which Captain Jim looked.\\n\\nIt could not be denied that Captain Jim was a homely man.  His spare jaws, rugged mouth, and square brow were not fashioned on the lines of beauty; and he had passed through many hardships and sorrows which had marked his body as well as his soul; but though at first sight Anne thought him plain she never thought anything more about it--the spirit shining through that rugged tenement beautified it so wholly.\\n\\nThey gathered gaily around the supper table.  The hearth fire banished the chill of the September evening, but the window of the dining room was open and sea breezes entered at their own sweet will.  The view was magnificent, taking in the harbor and the sweep of low, purple hills beyond.  The table was heaped with Mrs. Doctor's delicacies but the piece de resistance was undoubtedly the big platter of sea trout.\\n\\n\\\"Thought they'd be sorter tasty after travelling,\\\" said Captain Jim.  \\\"They're fresh as trout can be, Mistress Blythe.  Two hours ago they were swimming in the Glen Pond.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who is attending to the light tonight, Captain Jim?\\\" asked Doctor Dave.\\n\\n\\\"Nephew Alec.  He understands it as well as I do.  Well, now, I'm real glad you asked me to stay to supper.  I'm proper hungry--didn't have much of a dinner today.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I believe you half starve yourself most of the time down at that light,\\\" said Mrs. Doctor Dave severely.  \\\"You won't take the trouble to get up a decent meal.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I do, Mistress Doctor, I do,\\\" protested Captain Jim.  \\\"Why, I live like a king gen'rally.  Last night I was up to the Glen and took home two pounds of steak.  I meant to have a spanking good dinner today.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And what happened to the steak?\\\" asked Mrs. Doctor Dave.  \\\"Did you lose it on the way home?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.\\\"  Captain Jim looked sheepish.  \\\"Just at bedtime a poor, ornery sort of dog came along and asked for a night's lodging.  Guess he belonged to some of the fishermen 'long shore.  I couldn't turn the poor cur out--he had a sore foot.  So I shut him in the porch, with an old bag to lie on, and went to bed.  But somehow I couldn't sleep.  Come to think it over, I sorter remembered that the dog looked hungry.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you got up and gave him that steak--ALL that steak,\\\" said Mrs. Doctor Dave, with a kind of triumphant reproof.\\n\\n\\\"Well, there wasn't anything else TO give him,\\\" said Captain Jim deprecatingly.  \\\"Nothing a dog'd care for, that is.  I reckon he WAS hungry, for he made about two bites of it.  I had a fine sleep the rest of the night but my dinner had to be sorter scanty--potatoes and point, as you might say.  The dog, he lit out for home this morning.  I reckon HE weren't a vegetarian.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The idea of starving yourself for a worthless dog!\\\" sniffed Mrs. Doctor.\\n\\n\\\"You don't know but he may be worth a lot to somebody,\\\" protested Captain Jim.  \\\"He didn't LOOK of much account, but you can't go by looks in jedging a dog.  Like meself, he might be a real beauty inside.  The First Mate didn't approve of him, I'll allow.  His language was right down forcible. But the First Mate is prejudiced.  No use in taking a cat's opinion of a dog. 'Tennyrate, I lost my dinner, so this nice spread in this dee-lightful company is real pleasant. It' s a great thing to have good neighbors.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who lives in the house among the willows up the brook?\\\" asked Anne.\\n\\n\\\"Mrs. Dick Moore,\\\" said Captain Jim--\\\"and her husband,\\\" he added, as if by way of an afterthought.\\n\\nAnne smiled, and deduced a mental picture of Mrs. Dick Moore from Captain Jim's way of putting it; evidently a second Mrs. Rachel Lynde.\\n\\n\\\"You haven't many neighbors, Mistress Blythe,\\\" Captain Jim went on.  \\\"This side of the harbor is mighty thinly settled.  Most of the land belongs to Mr. Howard up yander past the Glen, and he rents it out for pasture. The other side of the harbor, now, is thick with folks--'specially MacAllisters.  There's a whole colony of MacAllisters you can't throw a stone but you hit one.  I was talking to old Leon Blacquiere the other day.  He's been working on the harbor all summer.  `Dey're nearly all MacAllisters over thar,' he told me.  `Dare's Neil MacAllister and Sandy MacAllister and William MacAllister and Alec MacAllister and Angus MacAllister--and I believe dare's de Devil MacAllister.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There are nearly as many Elliotts and Crawfords,\\\" said Doctor Dave, after the laughter had subsided.  \\\"You know, Gilbert, we folk on this side of Four Winds have an old saying--\\\\`From the conceit of the Elliotts, the pride of the MacAllisters, and the vainglory of the Crawfords, good Lord deliver us.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There's a plenty of fine people among them, though,\\\" said Captain Jim.  \\\"I sailed with William Crawford for many a year, and for courage and endurance and truth that man hadn't an equal.  They've got brains over on that side of Four Winds.  Mebbe that's why this side is sorter inclined to pick on 'em.  Strange, ain't it, how folks seem to resent anyone being born a mite cleverer than they be.\\\"\\n\\nDoctor Dave, who had a forty years' feud with the over-harbor people, laughed and subsided.\\n\\n\\\"Who lives in that brilliant emerald house about half a mile up the road?\\\" asked Gilbert.\\n\\nCaptain Jim smiled delightedly.\\n\\n\\\"Miss Cornelia Bryant.  She'll likely be over to see you soon, seeing you're Presbyterians.  If you were Methodists she wouldn't come at all.  Cornelia has a holy horror of Methodists.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She's quite a character,\\\" chuckled Doctor Dave.  \\\"A most inveterate man-hater!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sour grapes?\\\" queried Gilbert, laughing.\\n\\n\\\"No, 'tisn't sour grapes,\\\" answered Captain Jim seriously.  \\\"Cornelia could have had her pick when she was young.  Even yet she's only to say the word to see the old widowers jump.  She jest seems to have been born with a sort of chronic spite agin men and Methodists.  She's got the bitterest tongue and the kindest heart in Four Winds.  Wherever there's any trouble, that woman is there, doing everything to help in the tenderest way.  She never says a harsh word about another woman, and if she likes to card us poor scalawags of men down I reckon our tough old hides can stand it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She always speaks well of you, Captain Jim,\\\" said Mrs. Doctor.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I'm afraid so.  I don't half like it.  It makes me feel as if there must be something sorter unnateral about me.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER 7\\n\\nTHE SCHOOLMASTER'S BRIDE\\n\\n\\\"Who was the first bride who came to this house, Captain Jim?\\\" Anne asked, as they sat around the fireplace after supper.\\n\\n\\\"Was she a part of the story I've heard was connected with this house?\\\" asked Gilbert.  \\\"Somebody told me you could tell it, Captain Jim.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, yes, I know it.  I reckon I'm the only person living in Four Winds now that can remember the schoolmaster's bride as she was when she come to the Island.  She's been dead this thirty year, but she was one of them women you never forget.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tell us the story,\\\" pleaded Anne.  \\\"I want to find out all about the women who have lived in this house before me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, there's jest been three--Elizabeth Russell, and Mrs. Ned Russell, and the schoolmaster's bride.  Elizabeth Russell was a nice, clever little critter, and Mrs. Ned was a nice woman, too.  But they weren't ever like the schoolmaster's bride.\\n\\n\\\"The schoolmaster's name was John Selwyn.  He came out from the Old Country to teach school at the Glen when I was a boy of sixteen.  He wasn't much like the usual run of derelicts who used to come out to P.E.I. to teach school in them days.  Most of them were clever, drunken critters who taught the children the three R's when they were sober, and lambasted them when they wasn't.  But John Selwyn was a fine, handsome young fellow.  He boarded at my father's, and he and me were cronies, though he was ten years older'n me.  We read and walked and talked a heap together.  He knew about all the poetry that was ever written, I reckon, and he used to quote it to me along shore in the evenings.  Dad thought it an awful waste of time, but he sorter endured it, hoping it'd put me off the notion of going to sea.  Well, nothing could do THAT--mother come of a race of sea-going folk and it was born in me.  But I loved to hear John read and recite.  It's almost sixty years ago, but I could repeat yards of poetry I learned from him.  Nearly sixty years!\\\"\\n\\nCaptain Jim was silent for a space, gazing into the glowing fire in a quest of the bygones.  Then, with a sigh, he resumed his story.\\n\\n\\\"I remember one spring evening I met him on the sand-hills.  He looked sorter uplifted--jest like you did, Dr. Blythe, when you brought Mistress Blythe in tonight.  I thought of him the minute I seen you.  And he told me that he had a sweetheart back home and that she was coming out to him.  I wasn't more'n half pleased, ornery young lump of selfishness that I was; I thought he wouldn't be as much my friend after she came.  But I'd enough decency not to let him see it.  He told me all about her.  Her name was Persis Leigh, and she would have come out with him if it hadn't been for her old uncle.  He was sick, and he'd looked after her when her parents died and she wouldn't leave him.  And now he was dead and she was coming out to marry John Selwyn.  'Twasn't no easy journey for a woman in them days.  There weren't no steamers, you must ricollect.\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`When do you expect her?' says I.\\n\\n\\\"`She sails on the Royal William, the 20th of June,' says he, `and so she should be here by mid-July.  I must set Carpenter Johnson to building me a home for her.  Her letter come today.  I know before I opened it that it had good news for me.  I saw her a few nights ago.'\\n\\n\\\"I didn't understand him, and then he explained--though I didn't understand THAT much better.  He said he had a gift--or a curse.  Them was his words, Mistress Blythe--a gift or a curse.  He didn't know which it was.  He said a great-great-grandmother of his had had it, and they burned her for a witch on account of it.  He said queer spells--trances, I think was the name he give 'em--come over him now and again.
