"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"and ignorant of her kith and kin, she never saw one without an almost childish curiosity.  He was very big, and very dapper; his eyes gave her a funny feeling of having no particular clothes.\\n\\n\\\"They're off!\\\" she heard him say.\\n\\nThey came, stepping from the chancel.  Holly looked first in young Mont's face.  His lips and ears were twitching, his eyes, shifting from his feet to the hand within his arm, stared suddenly before them as if to face a firing party.  He gave Holly the feeling that he was spiritually intoxicated.  But Fleur!  Ah!  That was different.  The girl was perfectly composed, prettier than ever, in her white robes and veil over her banged dark chestnut hair; her eyelids hovered demure over her dark hazel eyes.  Outwardly, she seemed all there. But inwardly, where was she?  As those two passed, Fleur raised her eyelids--the restless glint of those clear whites remained on Holly's vision as might the flutter of caged bird's wings.\\n\\nIn Green Street Winifred stood to receive, just a little less composed than usual.  Soames' request for the use of her house had come on her at a deeply psychological moment.  Under the influence of a remark of Prosper Profond, she had begun to exchange her Empire for Expressionistic furniture.  There were the most amusing arrangements, with violet, green, and orange blobs and scriggles, to be had at Mealard's.  Another month and the change would have been complete. Just now, the very \\\"intriguing\\\" recruits she had enlisted, did not march too well with the old guard.  It was as if her regiment were half in khaki, half in scarlet and bearskins.  But her strong and comfortable character made the best of it in a drawing-room which typified, perhaps, more perfectly than she imagined, the semi- bolshevized imperialism of her country.  After all, this was a day of merger, and you couldn't have too much of it!  Her eyes travelled indulgently among her guests.  Soames had gripped the back of a buhl chair; young Mont was behind that \\\"awfully amusing\\\" screen, which no one as yet had been able to explain to her.  The ninth baronet had shied violently at a round scarlet table, inlaid under glass with blue Australian butteries' wings, and was clinging to her Louis- Quinze cabinet; Francie Forsyte had seized the new mantel-board, finely carved with little purple grotesques on an ebony ground; George, over by the old spinet, was holding a little sky-blue book as if about to enter bets; Prosper Profond was twiddling the knob of the open door, black with peacock-blue panels; and Annette's hands, close by, were grasping her own waist; two Muskhams clung to the balcony among the plants, as if feeling ill; Lady Mont, thin and brave- looking, had taken up her long-handled glasses and was gazing at the central light shade, of ivory and orange dashed with deep magenta, as if the heavens had opened.  Everybody, in fact, seemed holding on to something.  Only Fleur, still in her bridal dress, was detached from all support, flinging her words and glances to left and right.\\n\\nThe room was full of the bubble and the squeak of conversation. Nobody could hear anything that anybody said; which seemed of little consequence, since no one waited for anything so slow as an answer. Modern conversation seemed to Winifred so different from the days of her prime, when a drawl was all the vogue.  Still it was \\\"amusing,\\\" which, of course, was all that mattered.  Even the Forsytes were talking with extreme rapidity--Fleur and Christopher, and Imogen, and young Nicholas's youngest, Patrick.  Soames, of course, was silent; but George, by the spinet, kept up a running commentary, and Francie, by her mantel-shelf.  Winifred drew nearer to the ninth baronet.  He seemed to promise a certain repose; his nose was fine and drooped a little, his grey moustaches too; and she said, drawling through her smile:\\n\\n\\\"It's rather nice, isn't it?\\\"\\n\\nHis reply shot out of his smile like a snipped bread pellet\\n\\n\\\"D'you remember, in Frazer, the tribe that buries the bride up to the waist?\\\"\\n\\nHe spoke as fast as anybody!  He had dark lively little eyes, too, all crinkled round like a Catholic priest's.  Winifred felt suddenly he might say things she would regret.\\n\\n\\\"They're always so amusing--weddings,\\\" she murmured, and moved on to Soames.  He was curiously still, and Winifred saw at once what was dictating his immobility.  To his right was George Forsyte, to his left Annette and Prosper Profond.  He could not move without either seeing those two together, or the reflection of them in George Forsyte's japing eyes.  He was quite right not to be taking notice.\\n\\n\\\"They say Timothy's sinking;\\\" he said glumly.\\n\\n\\\"Where will you put him, Soames?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Highgate.\\\"  He counted on his fingers.  \\\"It'll make twelve of them there, including wives.  How do you think Fleur looks?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Remarkably well.\\\"\\n\\nSoames nodded.  He had never seen her look prettier, yet he could not rid himself of the impression that this business was unnatural-- remembering still that crushed figure burrowing into the corner of the sofa.  From that night to this day he had received from her no confidences.  He knew from his chauffeur that she had made one more attempt on Robin Hill and drawn blank--an empty house, no one at home.  He knew that she had received a letter, but not what was in it, except that it had made her hide herself and cry.  He had remarked that she looked at him sometimes when she thought he wasn't noticing, as if she were wondering still what he had done--forsooth-- to make those people hate him so.  Well, there it was!  Annette had come back, and things had worn on through the summer--very miserable, till suddenly Fleur had said she was going to marry young Mont.  She had shown him a little more affection when she told him that.  And he had yielded--what was the good of opposing it?  God knew that he had never wished to thwart her in anything!  And the young man seemed quite delirious about her.  No doubt she was in a reckless mood, and she was young, absurdly young.  But if he opposed her, he didn't know what she would do; for all he could tell she might want to take up a profession, become a doctor or solicitor, some nonsense.  She had no aptitude for painting, writing, music, in his view the legitimate occupations of unmarried women, if they must do something in these days.  On the whole, she was safer married, for he could see too well how feverish and restless she was at home.  Annette, too, had been in favour of it--Annette, from behind the veil of his refusal to know what she was about, if she was about anything.  Annette had said: \\\"Let her marry this young man. He is a nice boy--not so highty- flighty as he seems.\\\"  Where she got her expressions, he didn't know- -but her opinion soothed his doubts.  His wife, whatever her conduct, had clear eyes and an almost depressing amount of common sense.  He had settled fifty thousand on Fleur, taking care that there was no cross settlement in case it didn't turn out well.  Could it turn out well?  She had not got over that other boy--he knew.  They were to go to Spain for the honeymoon.  He would be even lonelier when she was gone.  But later, perhaps, she would forget, and turn to him again! Winifred's voice broke on his reverie.\\n\\n\\\"Why!  Of all wonders-June!\\\"\\n\\nThere, in a djibbah--what things she wore!--with her hair straying from under a fillet, Soames saw his cousin, and Fleur going forward to greet her.  The two passed from their view out on to the stairway.\\n\\n\\\"Really,\\\" said Winifred, \\\"she does the most impossible things!  Fancy her coming!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What made you ask her?\\\" muttered Soames.\\n\\n\\\"Because I thought she wouldn't accept, of course.\\\"\\n\\nWinifred had forgotten that behind conduct lies the main trend of character; or, in other words, omitted to remember that Fleur was now a \\\"lame duck.\\\"\\n\\nOn receiving her invitation, June had first thought, 'I wouldn't go near them for the world!' and then, one morning, had awakened from a dream of Fleur waving to her from a boat with a wild unhappy gesture. And she had changed her mind.\\n\\nWhen Fleur came forward and said to her, \\\"Do come up while I'm changing my dress,\\\" she had followed up the stairs.  The girl led the way into Imogen's old bedroom, set ready for her toilet.\\n\\nJune sat down on the bed, thin and upright, like a little spirit in the sear and yellow.  Fleur locked the door.\\n\\nThe girl stood before her divested of her wedding dress.  What a pretty thing she was\\n\\n\\\"I suppose you think me a fool,\\\" she said, with quivering lips, \\\"when it was to have been Jon.  But what does it matter?  Michael wants me, and I don't care.  It'll get me away from home.\\\"  Diving her hand into the frills on her breast, she brought out a letter.  \\\"Jon wrote me this.\\\"\\n\\nJune read:  \\\"Lake Okanagen, British Columbia.  I'm not coming back to England.  Bless you always.  Jon.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She's made safe, you see,\\\" said Fleur.\\n\\nJune handed back the letter.\\n\\n\\\"That's not fair to Irene,\\\" she said, \\\"she always told Jon he could do as he wished.\\\"\\n\\nFleur smiled bitterly.  \\\"Tell me, didn't she spoil your life too?\\\" June looked up.  \\\"Nobody can spoil a life, my dear.  That's nonsense. Things happen, but we bob up.\\\"\\n\\nWith a sort of terror she saw the girl sink on her knees and bury her face in the djibbah.  A strangled sob mounted to June's ears.\\n\\n\\\"It's all right--all right,\\\" she murmured, \\\"Don't!  There, there!\\\"\\n\\nBut the point of the girl's chin was pressed ever closer into her thigh, and the sound was dreadful of her sobbing.\\n\\nWell, well!  It had to come.  She would feel better afterward!  June stroked the short hair of that shapely head; and all the scattered mother-sense in her focussed itself and passed through the tips of her fingers into the girl's brain.\\n\\n\\\"Don't sit down under it, my dear,\\\" she said at last.  \\\"We can't control life, but we can fight it.  Make the best of things.  I've had to.  I held on, like you; and I cried, as you're crying now.  And look at me!\\\"\\n\\nFleur raised her head; a sob merged suddenly into a little choked laugh.  In truth it was a thin and rather wild and wasted spirit she was looking at, but it had brave eyes.\\n\\n\\\"All right!\\\" she said.  \\\"I'm sorry.  I shall forget him, I suppose, if I fly fast and far enough.\\\"\\n\\nAnd, scrambling to her feet, she went over to the wash-stand.\\n\\nJune watched her removing with cold water the traces of emotion. Save for a little becoming pinkness there was nothing left when she stood before the mirror.  June got off the bed and took a pin-cushion in her hand.  To put two pins into the wrong places was all the vent she found for sympathy.\\n\\n\\\"Give me a kiss,\\\" she said when Fleur was ready, and dug her chin into the girl's warm cheek.\\n\\n\\\"I want a whiff,\\\" said Fleur; \\\"don't wait.\\\"\\n\\nJune left her, sitting on the bed with a cigarette between her lips and her eyes half closed, and went down-stairs.  In the doorway of the drawing-room stood Soames as if unquiet at his daughter's tardiness.  June tossed her head and passed down on to the half- landing.  Her cousin Francie was standing there.\\n\\n\\\"Look!\\\" said June, pointing with her chin at Soames.  \\\"That man's fatal!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How do you mean,\\\" said Francie, \\\"fatal?\\\"\\n\\nJune did not answer her.  \\\"I shan't wait to see them off,\\\" she said. \\\"Good-bye!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good-bye!\\\" said Francie, and her eyes, of a Celtic grey, goggled. That old feud!  Really, it was quite romantic!\\n\\nSoames, moving to the well of the staircase, saw June go, and drew a breath of satisfaction.  Why didn't Fleur come?  They would miss their train.  That train would bear her away from him, yet he could not help fidgeting at the thought that they would lose it.  And then she did come, running down in her tan-coloured frock and black velvet cap, and passed him into the drawing-room.  He saw her kiss her mother, her aunt, Val's wife, Imogen, and then come forth, quick and pretty as ever.  How would she treat him at this last moment of her girlhood?  He couldn't hope for much!\\n\\nHer lips pressed the middle of his cheek.\\n\\n\\\"Daddy!\\\" she said, and was past and gone!  Daddy!  She hadn't called him that for years.  He drew a long breath and followed slowly down. There was all the folly with that confetti stuff and the rest of it to go through with yet.  But he would like just to catch her smile, if she leaned out, though they would hit her in the eye with the shoe, if they didn't take care.  Young Mont's voice said fervently in his ear:\\n\\n\\\"Good-bye, sir; and thank you!  I'm so fearfully bucked.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good-bye,\\\" he said; \\\"don't miss your train.\\\"\\n\\nHe stood on the bottom step but three, whence he could see above the heads--the silly hats and heads.  They were in the car now; and there was that stuff, showering, and there went the shoe.  A flood of something welled up in Soames, and--he didn't know--he couldn't see!\\n\\nXI\\n\\nTHE LAST OF THE OLD FORSYTES\\n\\nWhen they came to prepare that terrific symbol Timothy Forsyte--the one pure individualist left, the only man who hadn't heard of the Great War--they found him wonderful--not even death had undermined his soundness.\\n\\nTo Smither and Cook that preparation came like final evidence of what they had never believed possible--the end of the old Forsyte family on earth.  Poor Mr. Timothy must now take a harp and sing in the company of Miss Forsyte, Mrs. Julia, Miss Hester; with Mr. Jolyon, Mr. Swithin, Mr. James, Mr. Roger, and Mr. Nicholas of the party. Whether Mrs. Hayman would be there was more doubtful, seeing that she had been cremated.  Secretly Cook thought that Mr. Timothy would be upset--he had always been so set against barrel organs.  How many times had she not said: \\\"Drat the thing!  There it is again! Smither, you'd better run up and see what you can do.\\\"  And in her heart she would so have enjoyed the tunes, if she hadn't known that Mr. Timothy would ring the bell in a minute and say: \\\"Here, take him a halfpenny and tell him to move on.\\\"  Often they had been obliged to add threepence of their own before the man would go--Timothy had ever underrated the value of emotion.  Luckily he had taken the organs for blue-bottles in his last years, which had been a comfort, and they had been able to enjoy the tunes.  But a harp!  Cook wondered.  It was a change!  And Mr. Timothy had never liked change.  But she did not speak of this to Smither, who did so take a line of her own in regard to heaven that it quite put one about sometimes.\\n\\nShe cried while Timothy was being prepared, and they all had sherry afterward out of the yearly Christmas bottle, which would not be needed now.  Ah! dear!  She had been there five-and-forty years and Smither three-and-forty!  And now they would be going to a tiny house in Tooting, to live on their savings and what Miss Hester had so kindly left them--for to take fresh service after the glorious past-- No!  But they would like just to see Mr. Soames again, and Mrs. Dartie, and Miss Francie, and Miss Euphemia.  And even if they had to take their own cab, they felt they must go to the funeral.  For six years Mr. Timothy had been their baby, getting younger and younger every day, till at last he had been too young to live.\\n\\nThey spent the regulation hours of waiting in polishing and dusting, in catching the one mouse left, and asphyxiating the last beetle so as to leave it nice, discussing with each other what they would buy at the sale.  Miss Ann's workbox; Miss Juley's (that is Mrs. Julia's) seaweed album; the fire-screen Miss Hester had crewelled; and Mr. Timothy's hair--little golden curls, glued into a black frame.  Oh! they must have those--only the price of things had gone up so!\\n\\nIt fell to Soames to issue invitations for the funeral.  He had them drawn up by Gradman in his office--only blood relations, and no flowers.  Six carriages were ordered.  The Will would be read afterward at the house.\\n\\nHe arrived at eleven o'clock to see that all was ready.  At a quarter past old Gradman came in black gloves and crape on his hat.  He and Soames stood in the drawing-room waiting.  At half-past eleven the carriages drew up in a long row.  But no one else appeared.  Gradman said:\\n\\n\\\"It surprises me, Mr. Soames.  I posted them myself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know,\\\" said Soames; \\\"he'd lost touch with the family.\\\" Soames had often noticed in old days how much more neighbourly his family were to the dead than to the living.  But, now, the way they had flocked to Fleur's wedding and abstained from Timothy's funeral, seemed to show some vital change.  There might, of course, be another reason; for Soames felt that if he had not known the contents of Timothy's Will, he might have stayed away himself through delicacy. Timothy had left a lot of money, with nobody in particular to leave it to.  They mightn't like to seem to expect something.\\n\\nAt twelve o'clock the procession left the door; Timothy alone in the first carriage under glass.  Then Soames alone; then Gradman alone; then Cook and Smither together.  They started at a walk, but were soon trotting under a bright sky.  At the entrance to Highgate Cemetery they were delayed by service in the Chapel.  Soames would have liked to stay outside in the sunshine.  He didn't believe a word of it; on the other hand, it was a form of insurance which could not safely be neglected, in case there might be something in it after all.\\n\\nThey walked up two and two--he and Gradman, Cook and Smither--to the family vault.  It was not very distinguished for the funeral of the last old Forsyte.\\n\\nHe took Gradman into his carriage on the way back to the Bayswater Road with a certain glow in his heart.  He had a surprise in pickle for the old chap who had served the Forsytes four-and-fifty years-a treat that was entirely his doing.  How well he remembered saying to Timothy the day--after Aunt Hester's funeral: \\\"Well; Uncle Timothy, there's Gradman.  He's taken a lot of trouble for the family.  What do you say to leaving him five thousand?\\\" and his surprise, seeing the diflicuIty there had been in getting Timothy to leave anything, when Timothy had nodded.  And now the old chap would be as pleased as Punch, for Mrs. Gradman, he knew, had a weak heart, and their son had lost a leg in the War.  It was extraordinarily gratifying to Soames to have left him five thousand pounds of Timothy's money.  They sat down together in the little drawing-room, whose walls--like a vision of heaven--were sky-blue and gold with every picture-frame unnaturally bright, and every speck of dust removed from every piece of furniture, to read that little masterpiece--the Will of Timothy. With his back to the light in Aunt Hester's chair, Soames faced Gradman with his face to the light, on Aunt Ann's sofa; and, crossing his legs, began:\\n\\n\\\"This is the last Will and Testament of me Timothy Forsyte of The Bower Bayswater Road, London I appoint my nephew Soames Forsyte of The Shelter Mapleduram and Thomas Gradman of 159 Folly Road Highgate (hereinafter called my Trustees) to be the trustees and executors of this my Will To the said Soames Forsyte I leave the sum of one thousand pounds free of legacy duty and to the said Thomas Gradman I leave the sum of five thousand pounds free of legacy duty.\\\"\\n\\nSoames paused.  Old Gradman was leaning forward, convulsively gripping a stout black knee with each of his thick hands; his mouth had fallen open so that the gold fillings of three teeth gleamed; his eyes were blinking, two tears rolled slowly out of them.  Soames read hastily on.\\n\\n\\\"All the rest of my property of whatsoever description I bequeath to my Trustees upon Trust to convert and hold the same upon the following trusts namely To pay thereout all my debts funeral expenses and outgoings of any kind in connection with my Will and to hold the residue thereof in trust for that male lineal descendant of my father Jolyon Forsyte by his marriage with Ann Pierce who after the decease of all lineal descendants whether male or female of my said father by his said marriage in being at the time of my death shall last attain the age of twenty-one years absolutely it being my desire that my property shall be nursed to the extreme limit permitted by the laws of England for the benefit of such male lineal descendant as aforesaid.\\\"\\n\\nSoames read the investment and attestation clauses, and, ceasing, looked at Gradman.  The old fellow was wiping his brow with a large handkerchief, whose brilliant colour supplied a sudden festive tinge to the proceedings.\\n\\n\\\"My word, Mr. Soames!\\\" he said, and it was clear that the lawyer in him had utterly wiped out the man: \\\"My word!  Why, there are two babies now, and some quite young children--if one of them lives to be eighty--it's not a great age--and add twenty-one--that's a hundred years; and Mr. Timothy worth a hundred and fifty thousand pound net if he's worth a penny.  Compound interest at five per cent. doubles you in fourteen years.  In fourteen years three hundred thousand-six hundred thousand in twenty-eight--twelve hundred thousand in forty- two--twenty-four hundred thousand in fifty-six--four million eight hundred thousand in seventy--nine million six hundred thousand in eighty-four--Why, in a hundred years it'll be twenty million!  And we shan't live to use it!  It is a Will!\\\"\\n\\nSoames said dryly: \\\"Anything may happen.  The State might take the lot; they're capable of anything in these days.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And carry five,\\\" said Gradman to himself.  \\\"I forgot--Mr. Timothy's in Consols; we shan't get more than two per cent. with this income tax.  To be on the safe side, say eight millions.  Still, that's a pretty penny.\\\"\\n\\nSoames rose and handed him the Will.  \\\"You're going into the City. Take care of that, and do what's necessary.  Advertise; but there are no debts.  When's the sale?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tuesday week,\\\" said Gradman.  \\\"Life or lives in bein' and twenty-one years afterward--it's a long way off.  But I'm glad he's left it in the family....\\\"\\n\\nThe sale--not at Jobson's, in view of the Victorian nature of the effects--was far more freely attended than the funeral, though not by Cook and Smither, for Soames had taken it on himself to give them their heart's desires.  Winifred was present, Euphemia, and Francie, and Eustace had come in his car.  The miniatures, Barbizons, and J. R. drawings had been bought in by Soames; and relics of no marketable value were set aside in an off-room for members of the family who cared to have mementoes.  These were the only restrictions upon bidding characterised by an almost tragic languor.  Not one piece of furniture, no picture or porcelain figure appealed to modern taste. The humming birds had fallen like autumn leaves when taken from where they had not hummed for sixty years.  It was painful to Soames to see the chairs his aunts had sat on, the little grand piano they had practically never played, the books whose outsides they had gazed at, the china they had dusted, the curtains they had drawn, the hearth- rug which had warmed their feet; above all, the beds they had lain and died in--sold to little dealers, and the housewives of Fulham. And yet--what could one do?  Buy them and stick them in a lumber- room?  No; they had to go the way of all flesh and furniture, and be worn out.  But when they put up Aunt Ann's sofa and were going to knock it down for thirty shillings, he cried out, suddenly: \\\"Five pounds!\\\"  The sensation was considerable, and the sofa his.\\n\\nWhen that little sale was over in the fusty saleroom, and those Victorian ashes scattered, he went out into the misty October sunshine feeling as if cosiness had died out of the world, and the board \\\"To Let\\\" was up, indeed.  Revolutions on the horizon; Fleur in Spain; no comfort in Annette; no Timothy's on the Bayswater Road.  In the irritable desolation of his soul he went into the Goupenor Gallery.  That chap Jolyon's watercoIours were on view there.  He went in to look down his nose at them--it might give him some faint satisfaction.  The news had trickled through from June to Val's wife, from her to Val, from Val to his mother, from her to Soames, that the house--the fatal house at Robin Hill--was for sale, and Irene going to join her boy out in British Columbia, or some such place.  For one wild moment the thought had come to Soames: 'Why shouldn't I buy it back?  I meant it for my!'  No sooner come than gone.  Too lugubrious a triumph; with too many humiliating memories for himself and Fleur. She would never live there after what had happened.  No, the place must go its way to some peer or profiteer.  It had been a bone of contention from the first, the shell of the feud; and with the woman gone, it was an empty shell.  \\\"For Sale or To Let.\\\"  With his mind's eye he could see that board raised high above the ivied wall which he had built.\\n\\nHe passed through the first of the two rooms in the Gallery.  There was certainly a body of work!  And now that the fellow was dead it did not seem so trivial.  The drawings were pleasing enough, with quite a sense of atmosphere, and something individual in the brush work.  'His father and my father; he and I; his child and mine!' thought Soames.  So it had gone on!  And all about that woman! Softened by the events of the past week, affected by the melancholy beauty of the autumn day, Soames came nearer than he had ever been to realisation of that truth--passing the understanding of a Forsyte pure--that the body of Beauty has a spiritual essence, uncapturable save by a devotion which thinks not of self.  After all, he was near that truth in his devotion to his daughter; perhaps that made him understand a little how he had missed the prize.  And there, among the drawings of his kinsman, who had attained to that which he had found beyond his reach, he thought of him and her with a tolerance which surprised him.  But he did not buy a drawing.\\n\\nJust as he passed the seat of custom on his return to the outer air he met with a contingency which had not been entirely absent from his mind when he went into the Gallery--Irene, herself, coming in.  So she had not gone yet, and was still paying farewell visits to that fellow's remains!  He subdued the little involuntary leap of his subconsciousness, the mechanical reaction of his senses to the charm of this once-owned woman, and passed her with averted eyes.  But when he had gone by he could not for the life of him help looking back. This, then, was finality--the heat and stress of his life, the madness and the longing thereof, the only defeat he had known, would be over when she faded from his view this time; even such memories had their own queer aching value.\\n\\nShe, too, was looking back.  Suddenly she lifted her gloved hand, her lips smiled faintly, her dark eyes seemed to speak.  It was the turn of Soames to make no answer to that smile and that little farewell wave; he went out into the fashionable street quivering from head to foot.  He knew what she had meant to say: \\\"Now that I am going for ever out of the reach of you and yours--forgive me; I wish you well.\\\" That was the meaning; last sign of that terrible reality--passing morality, duty, common sense--her aversion from him who had owned her body, but had never touched her spirit or her heart.  It hurt; yes-- more than if she had kept her mask unmoved, her hand unlifted.\\n\\nThree days later, in that fast-yellowing October, Soames took a taxi- cab to Highgate Cemetery and mounted through its white forest to the Forsyte vault.  Close to the cedar, above catacombs and columbaria, tall, ugly, and individual, it looked like an apex of the competitive system.  He could remember a discussion wherein Swithin had advocated the addition to its face of the pheasant proper.  The proposal had been rejected in favour of a wreath in stone, above the stark words: \\\"The family vault of Jolyon Forsyte: 1850.\\\"  It was in good order. All trace of the recent interment had been removed, and its sober grey gloomed reposefully in the sunshine.  The whole family lay there now, except old Jolyon's wife, who had gone back under a contract to her own family vault in Suffolk; old Jolyon himself lying at Robin Hill; and Susan Hayman, cremated so that none knew where she might be.  Soames gazed at it with satisfaction--massive, needing little attention; and this was important, for he was well aware that no one would attend to it when he himself was gone, and he would have to be looking out for lodgings soon.  He might have twenty years before him, but one never knew.  Twenty years without an aunt or uncle, with a wife of whom one had better not know anything, with a daughter gone from home.  His mood inclined to melancholy and retrospection.\\n\\nThis cemetery was full, they said--of people with extraordinary names, buried in extraordinary taste.  Still, they had a fine view up here, right over London.  Annette had once given him a story to read by that Frenchman, Maupassant, most lugubrious concern, where all the skeletons emerged from their graves one night, and all the pious inscriptions on the stones were altered to descriptions of their sins.  Not a true story at all.  He didn't know about the French, but there was not much real harm in English people except their teeth and their taste, which was certainly deplorable.  \\\"The family vault of Jolyon Forsyte: 1850.\\\"  A lot of people had been buried here since then--a lot of English life crumbled to mould and dust!  The boom of an airplane passing under the gold-tinted clouds caused him to lift his eyes.  The deuce of a lot of expansion had gone on.  But it all came back to a cemetery--to a name and a date on a tomb.  And he thought with a curious pride that he and his family had done little or nothing to help this feverish expansion.  Good solid middlemen, they had gone to work with dignity to manage and possess.  \\\"Superior Dosset,\\\" indeed, had built in a dreadful, and Jolyon painted in a doubtful, period, but so far as he remembered not another of them all had soiled his hands by creating anything--unless you counted Val Dartie and his horse-breeding.  Collectors, solicitors, barristers, merchants, publishers, accountants, directors, land agents, even soldiers--there they had been!  The country had expanded, as it were, in spite of them.  They had checked, controlled, defended, and taken advantage of the process and when you considered how \\\"Superior Dosset\\\" had begun life with next to nothing, and his lineal descendants already owned what old Gradman estimated at between a million and a million and a half, it was not so bad!  And yet he sometimes felt as if the family bolt was shot, their possessive instinct dying out.  They seemed unable to make money--this fourth generation; they were going into art, literature, farming, or the army; or just living on what was left them--they had no push and no tenacity.  They would die out if they didn't take care.\\n\\nSoames turned from the vault and faced toward the breeze.  The air up here would be delicious if only he could rid his nerves of the feeling that mortality was in it.  He gazed restlessly at the crosses and the urns, the angels, the \\\"immortelles,\\\" the flowers, gaudy or withering; and suddenly he noticed a spot which seemed so different from anything else up there that he was obliged to walk the few necessary yards and look at it.  A sober corner, with a massive queer-shaped cross of grey rough-hewn granite, guarded by four dark yew-trees.  The spot was free from the pressure of the other graves, having a little box-hedged garden on the far side, and in front a goldening birch-tree.  This oasis in the desert of conventional graves appealed to the aesthetic sense of Soames, and he sat down there in the sunshine.  Through those trembling gold birch leaves he gazed out at London, and yielded to the waves of memory.  He thought of Irene in Montpellier Square, when her hair was rusty-golden and her white shoulders his--Irene, the prize of his love-passion, resistant to his ownership.  He saw Bosinney's body lying in that white mortuary, and Irene sitting on the sofa looking at space with the eyes of a dying bird.  Again he thought of her by the little green Niobe in the Bois de Boulogne, once more rejecting him.  His fancy took him on beside his drifting river on the November day when Fleur was to be born, took him to the dead leaves floating on the green-tinged water and the snake-headed weed for ever swaying and nosing, sinuous, blind, tethered.  And on again to the window opened to the cold starry night above Hyde Park, with his father lying dead. His fancy darted to that picture of \\\"the future town,\\\" to that boy's and Fleur's first meeting; to the bluish trail of Prosper Profond's cigar, and Fleur in the window pointing down to where the fellow prowled.  To the sight of Irene and that dead fellow sitting side by side in the stand at Lord's.  To her and that boy at Robin Hill.  To the sofa, where Fleur lay crushed up in the corner; to her lips pressed into his cheek, and her farewell \\\"Daddy.\\\"  And suddenly he saw again Irene's grey-gloved hand waving its last gesture of release.\\n\\nHe sat there a long time dreaming his career, faithful to the scut of his possessive instinct, warming himself even with its failures.\\n\\n\\\"To Let\\\"--the Forsyte age and way of life, when a man owned his soul, his investments, and his woman, without check or question.  And now the State had, or would have, his investments, his woman had herself, and God knew who had his soul.  \\\"To Let\\\"--that sane and simple creed!\\n\\nThe waters of change were foaming in, carrying the promise of new forms only when their destructive flood should have passed its full. He sat there, subconscious of them, but with his thoughts resolutely set on the past--as a man might ride into a wild night with his face to the tail of his galloping horse.  Athwart the Victorian dykes the waters were rolling on property, manners, and morals, on melody and the old forms of art--waters bringing to his mouth a salt taste as of blood, lapping to the foot of this Highgate Hill where Victorianism lay buried.  And sitting there, high up on its most individual spot, Soames--like a figure of Investment--refused their restless sounds. Instinctively he would not fight them--there was in him too much primeval wisdom, of Man the possessive animal.  They would quiet down when they had fulfilled their tidal fever of dispossessing and destroying; when the creations and the properties of others were sufficiently broken and defected--they would lapse and ebb, and fresh forms would rise based on an instinct older than the fever of change- -the instinct of Home.\\n\\n\\\"Je m'en fiche,\\\" said Prosper Profond.  Soames did not say \\\"Je m'en fiche\\\"--it was French, and the fellow was a thorn in his side--but deep down he knew that change was only the interval of death between two forms of life, destruction necessary to make room for fresher property.  What though the board was up, and cosiness to let?--some one would come along and take it again some day.\\n\\nAnd only one thing really troubled him, sitting there--the melancholy craving in his heart--because the sun was like enchantment on his face and on the clouds and on the golden birch leaves, and the wind's rustle was so gentle, and the yewtree green so dark, and the sickle of a moon pale in the sky.\\n\\nHe might wish and wish and never get it--the beauty and the loving in the world!\",\"timestamp\":1639990558,\"title\":\"Holly demurely scrutinized one of whom she had often heard.
