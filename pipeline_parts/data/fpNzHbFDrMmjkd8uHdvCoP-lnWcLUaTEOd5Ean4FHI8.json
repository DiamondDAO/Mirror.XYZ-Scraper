"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"After our return to Uliassutai we heard that disquieting news had been received by the Mongol Sait from Muren Kure.  The letter stated that Red Troops were pressing Colonel Kazagrandi very hard in the region of Lake Kosogol.  The Sait feared the advance of the Red troops southward to Uliassutai.  Both the American firms liquidated their affairs and all our friends were prepared for a quick exit, though they hesitated at the thought of leaving the town, as they were afraid of meeting the detachment of Chahars sent from the east.  We decided to await the arrival of this detachment, as their coming could change the whole course of events.  In a few days they came, two hundred warlike Chahar brigands under the command of a former Chinese hunghutze.  He was a tall, skinny man with hands that reached almost to his knees, a face blackened by wind and sun and mutilated with two long scars down over his forehead and cheek, the making of one of which had also closed one of his hawklike eyes, topped off with a shaggy coonskin cap--such was the commander of the detachment of Chahars.  A personage very dark and stern, with whom a night meeting on a lonely street could not be considered a pleasure by any bent of the imagination.\\n\\nThe detachment made camp within the destroyed fortress, near to the single Chinese building that had not been razed and which was now serving as headquarters for the Chinese Commissioner.  On the very day of their arrival the Chahars pillaged a Chinese dugun or trading house not half a mile from the fortress and also offended the wife of the Chinese Commissioner by calling her a \\\"traitor.\\\" The Chahars, like the Mongols, were quite right in their stand, because the Chinese Commissioner Wang Tsao-tsun had on his arrival in Uliassutai followed the Chinese custom of demanding a Mongolian wife.  The servile new Sait had given orders that a beautiful and suitable Mongolian girl be found for him.  One was so run down and placed in his yamen, together with her big wrestling Mongol brother who was to be a guard for the Commissioner but who developed into the nurse for the little white Pekingese pug which the official presented to his new wife.\\n\\nBurglaries, squabbles and drunken orgies of the Chahars followed, so that Wang Tsoa-tsun exerted all his efforts to hurry the detachment westward to Kobdo and farther into Urianhai.\\n\\nOne cold morning the inhabitants of Uliassutai rose to witness a very stern picture.  Along the main street of the town the detachment was passing.  They were riding on small, shaggy ponies, three abreast; were dressed in warm blue coats with sheepskin overcoats outside and crowned with the regulation coonskin caps; armed from head to foot.  They rode with wild shouts and cheers, very greedily eyeing the Chinese shops and the houses of the Russian colonists.  At their head rode the one-eyed hunghutze chief with three horsemen behind him in white overcoats, who carried waving banners and blew what may have been meant for music through great conch shells.  One of the Chahars could not resist and so jumped out of his saddle and made for a Chinese shop along the street.  Immediately the anxious cries of the Chinese merchants came from the shop.  The hunghutze swung round, noticed the horse at the door of the shop and realized what was happening. Immediately he reined his horse and made for the spot.  With his raucous voice he called the Chahar out.  As he came, he struck him full in the face with his whip and with all his strength.  Blood flowed from the slashed cheek.  But the Chahar was in the saddle in a second without a murmur and galloped to his place in the file. During this exit of the Chahars all the people were hidden in their houses, anxiously peeping through cracks and corners of the windows.  But the Chahars passed peacefully out and only when they met a caravan carrying Chinese wine about six miles from town did their native tendency display itself again in pillaging and emptying several containers.  Somewhere in the vicinity of Hargana they were ambushed by Tushegoun Lama and so treated that never again will the plains of Chahar welcome the return of these warrior sons who were sent out to conquer the Soyot descendants of the ancient Tuba.\\n\\nThe day the column left Uliassutai a heavy snow fell, so that the road became impassable.  The horses first were up to their knees, tired out and stopped.  Some Mongol horsemen reached Uliassutai the following day after great hardship and exertion, having made only twenty-five miles in forty-eight hours.  Caravans were compelled to stop along the routes.  The Mongols would not consent even to attempt journeys with oxen and yaks which made but ten or twelve miles a day.  Only camels could be used but there were too few and their drivers did not feel that they could make the first railway station of Kuku-Hoto, which was about fourteen hundred miles away. We were forced again to wait: for which?  Death or salvation?  Only our own energy and force could save us.  Consequently my friend and I started out, supplied with a tent, stove and food, for a new reconnaissance along the shore of Lake Kosogol, whence the Mongol Sait expected the new invasion of Red troops.\\n\\nCHAPTER XX\\n\\nTHE DEMON OF JAGISSTAI\\n\\nOur small group consisting of four mounted and one pack camel moved northward along the valley of the River Boyagol in the direction of the Tarbagatai Mountains.  The road was rocky and covered deep with snow.  Our camels walked very carefully, sniffing out the way as our guide shouted the \\\"Ok! Ok!\\\" of the camel drivers to urge them on.  We left behind us the fortress and Chinese dugun, swung round the shoulder of a ridge and, after fording several times an open stream, began the ascent of the mountain.  The scramble was hard and dangerous.  Our camels picked their way most cautiously, moving their ears constantly, as is their habit in such stress.  The trail zigzagged into mountain ravines, passed over the tops of ridges, slipped back down again into shallower valleys but ever made higher and higher altitudes.  At one place under the grey clouds that tipped the ridges we saw away up on the wide expanse of snow some black spots.\\n\\n\\\"Those are the obo, the sacred signs and altars for the bad demons watching this pass,\\\" explained the guide.  \\\"This pass is called Jagisstai.  Many very old tales about it have been kept alive, ancient as these mountains themselves.\\\"\\n\\nWe encouraged him to tell us some of them.\\n\\nThe Mongol, rocking on his camel and looking carefully all around him, began his tale.\\n\\n\\\"It was long ago, very long ago. . . .  The grandson of the great Jenghiz Khan sat on the throne of China and ruled all Asia.  The Chinese killed their Khan and wanted to exterminate all his family but a holy old Lama slipped the wife and little son out of the palace and carried them off on swift camels beyond the Great Wall, where they sank into our native plains.  The Chinese made a long search for the trails of our refugees and at last found where they had gone.  They despatched a strong detachment on fleet horses to capture them.  Sometimes the Chinese nearly came up with the fleeing heir of our Khan but the Lama called down from Heaven a deep snow, through which the camels could pass while the horses were inextricably held.  This Lama was from a distant monastery. We shall pass this hospice of Jahantsi Kure.  In order to reach it one must cross over the Jagisstai.  And it was just here the old Lama suddenly became ill, rocked in his saddle and fell dead.  Ta Sin Lo, the widow of the Great Khan, burst into tears; but, seeing the Chinese riders galloping there below across the valley, pressed on toward the pass.  The camels were tired, stopping every moment, nor did the woman know how to stimulate and drive them on.  The Chinese riders came nearer and nearer.  Already she heard their shouts of joy, as they felt within their grasp the prize of the mandarins for the murder of the heir of the Great Khan.  The heads of the mother and the son would be brought to Peking and exposed on the Ch'ien Men for the mockery and insults of the people.  The frightened mother lifted her little son toward heaven and exclaimed:\\n\\n\\\"'Earth and Gods of Mongolia, behold the offspring of the man who has glorified the name of the Mongols from one end of the world to the other!  Allow not this very flesh of Jenghiz Khan to perish!'\\n\\n\\\"At this moment she noticed a white mouse sitting on a rock nearby. It jumped to her knees and said:\\n\\n\\\"'I am sent to help you.  Go on calmly and do not fear.  The pursuers of you and your son, to whom is destined a life of glory, have come to the last bourne of their lives.'\\n\\n\\\"Ta Sin Lo did not see how one small mouse could hold in check three hundred men.  The mouse jumped back to the ground and again spoke:\\n\\n\\\"'I am the demon of Tarbagatai, Jagasstai.  I am mighty and beloved of the Gods but, because you doubted the powers of the miracle- speaking mouse, from this day the Jagasstai will be dangerous for the good and bad alike.'\\n\\n\\\"The Khan's widow and son were saved but Jagasstai has ever remained merciless.  During the journey over this pass one must always be on one's guard.  The demon of the mountain is ever ready to lead the traveler to destruction.\\\"\\n\\nAll the tops of the ridges of the Tarbagatai are thickly dotted with the obo of rocks and branches.  In one place there was even erected a tower of stones as an altar to propitiate the Gods for the doubts of Ta Sin Lo.  Evidently the demon expected us.  When we began our ascent of the main ridge, he blew into our faces with a sharp, cold wind, whistled and roared and afterwards began casting over us whole blocks of snow torn off the drifts above.  We could not distinguish anything around us, scarcely seeing the camel immediately in front.  Suddenly I felt a shock and looked about me. Nothing unusual was visible.  I was seated comfortably between two leather saddle bags filled with meat and bread but . . . I could not see the head of my camel.  He had disappeared.  It seemed that he had slipped and fallen to the bottom of a shallow ravine, while the bags which were slung across his back without straps had caught on a rock and stopped with myself there in the snow.  This time the demon of Jagasstai only played a joke but one that did not satisfy him.  He began to show more and more anger.  With furious gusts of wind he almost dragged us and our bags from the camels and nearly knocked over our humped steeds, blinded us with frozen snow and prevented us from breathing.  Through long hours we dragged slowly on in the deep snow, often falling over the edge of the rocks.  At last we entered a small valley where the wind whistled and roared with a thousand voices.  It had grown dark.  The Mongol wandered around searching for the trail and finally came back to us, flourishing his arms and saying:\\n\\n\\\"We have lost the road.  We must spend the night here.  It is very bad because we shall have no wood for our stove and the cold will grow worse.\\n\\nWith great difficulties and with frozen hands we managed to set up our tent in the wind, placing in it the now useless stove.  We covered the tent with snow, dug deep, long ditches in the drifts and forced our camels to lie down in them by shouting the \\\"Dzuk! Dzuk!\\\" command to kneel.  Then we brought our packs into the tent.\\n\\nMy companion rebelled against the thought of spending a cold night with a stove hard by.\\n\\n\\\"I am going out to look for firewood,\\\" said he very decisively; and at that took up the ax and started.  He returned after an hour with a big section of a telegraph pole.\\n\\n\\\"You, Jenghiz Khans,\\\" said he, rubbing his frozen hands, \\\"take your axes and go up there to the left on the mountain and you will find the telegraph poles that have been cut down.  I made acquaintance with the old Jagasstai and he showed me the poles.\\\"\\n\\nJust a little way from us the line of the Russian telegraphs passed, that which had connected Irkutsk with Uliassutai before the days of the Bolsheviki and which the Chinese had commanded the Mongols to cut down and take the wire.  These poles are now the salvation of travelers crossing the pass.  Thus we spent the night in a warm tent, supped well from hot meat soup with vermicelli, all in the very center of the dominion of the angered Jagasstai.  Early the next morning we found the road not more than two or three hundred paces from our tent and continued our hard trip over the ridge of Tarbagatai.  At the head of the Adair River valley we noticed a flock of the Mongolian crows with carmine beaks circling among the rocks.  We approached the place and discovered the recently fallen bodies of a horse and rider.  What had happened to them was difficult to guess.  They lay close together; the bridle was wound around the right wrist of the man; no trace of knife or bullet was found.  It was impossible to make out the features of the man.  His overcoat was Mongolian but his trousers and under jacket were not of the Mongolian pattern.  We asked ourselves what had happened to him.\\n\\nOur Mongol bowed his head in anxiety and said in hushed but assured tones:  \\\"It is the vengeance of Jagasstai.  The rider did not make sacrifice at the southern obo and the demon has strangled him and his horse.\\\"\\n\\nAt last Tarbagatai was behind us.  Before us lay the valley of the Adair.  It was a narrow zigzagging plain following along the river bed between close mountain ranges and covered with a rich grass. It was cut into two parts by the road along which the prostrate telegraph poles now lay, as the stumps of varying heights and long stretches of wire completed the debris.  This destruction of the telegraph line between Irkutsk and Uliassutai was necessary and incident to the aggressive Chinese policy in Mongolia.\\n\\nSoon we began to meet large herds of sheep, which were digging through the snow to the dry but very nutritious grass.  In some places yaks and oxen were seen on the high slopes of the mountains. Only once, however, did we see a shepherd, for all of them, spying us first, had made off to the mountains or hidden in the ravines. We did not even discover any yurtas along the way.  The Mongols had also concealed all their movable homes in the folds of the mountains out of sight and away from the reach of the strong winds. Nomads are very skilful in choosing the places for their winter dwellings.  I had often in winter visited the Mongolian yurtas set in such sheltered places that, as I came off the windy plains, I felt as though I were in a conservatory.  Once we came up to a big herd of sheep.  But as we approached most of the herd gradually withdrew, leaving one part that remained unmoved as the other worked off across the plains.  From this section soon about thirty of forty head emerged and went scrambling and leaping right up the mountain side.  I took up my glasses and began to observe them. The part of the herd that remained behind were common sheep; the large section that had drawn off over the plain were Mongolian antelopes (gazella gutturosa); while the few that had taken to the mountain were the big horned sheep (ovis argali).  All this company had been grazing together with the domestic sheep on the plains of the Adair, which attracted them with its good grass and clear water.  In many places the river was not frozen and in some places I saw great clouds of steam over the surface of the open water.  In the meantime some of the antelopes and the mountain sheep began looking at us.\\n\\n\\\"Now they will soon begin to cross our trail,\\\" laughed the Mongol; \\\"very funny beasts.  Sometimes the antelopes course for miles in their endeavor to outrun and cross in front of our horses and then, when they have done so, go loping quietly off.\\\"\\n\\nI had already seen this strategy of the antelopes and I decided to make use of it for the purpose of the hunt.  We organized our chase in the following manner.  We let one Mongol with the pack camel proceed as we had been traveling and the other three of us spread out like a fan headed toward the herd on the right of our true course.  The herd stopped and looked about puzzled, for their etiquette required that they should cross the path of all four of these riders at once.  Confusion began.  They counted about three thousand heads.  All this army began to run from one side to another but without forming any distinct groups.  Whole squadrons of them ran before us and then, noticing another rider, came coursing back and made anew the same manoeuvre.  One group of about fifty head rushed in two rows toward my point.  When they were about a hundred and fifty paces away I shouted and fired.  They stopped at once and began to whirl round in one spot, running into one another and even jumping over one another.  Their panic cost them dear, for I had time to shoot four times to bring down two beautiful heads.  My friend was even more fortunate than I, for he shot only once into the herd as it rushed past him in parallel lines and dropped two with the same bullet.\\n\\nMeanwhile the argali had gone farther up the mountainside and taken stand there in a row like so many soldiers, turning to gaze at us. Even at this distance I could clearly distinguish their muscular bodies with their majestic heads and stalwart horns.  Picking up our prey, we overtook the Mongol who had gone on ahead and continued our way.  In many places we came across the carcasses of sheep with necks torn and the flesh of the sides eaten off.\\n\\n\\\"It is the work of wolves,\\\" said the Mongol.  \\\"They are always hereabout in large numbers.\\\"\\n\\nWe came across several more herds of antelope, which ran along quietly enough until they had made a comfortable distance ahead of us and then with tremendous leaps and bounds crossed our bows like the proverbial chicken on the road.  Then, after a couple of hundred paces at this speed, they stopped and began to graze quite calmly.  Once I turned my camel back and the whole herd immediately took up the challenge again, coursed along parallel with me until they had made sufficient distance for their ideas of safety and then once more rushed across the road ahead of me as though it were paved with red hot stones, only to assume their previous calmness and graze back on the same side of the trail from which our column had first started them.  On another occasion I did this three times with a particular herd and laughed long and heartily at their stupid customs.\\n\\nWe passed a very unpleasant night in this valley.  We stopped on the shore of the frozen stream in a spot where we found shelter from the wind under the lee of a high shore.  In our stove we did have a fire and in our kettle boiling water.  Also our tent was warm and cozy.  We were quietly resting with pleasant thoughts of supper to soothe us, when suddenly a howling and laughter as though from some inferno burst upon us from just outside the tent, while from the other side of the valley came the long and doleful howls in answer.\\n\\n\\\"Wolves,\\\" calmly explained the Mongol, who took my revolver and went out of the tent.  He did not return for some time but at last we heard a shot and shortly after he entered.\\n\\n\\\"I scared them a little,\\\" said he.  \\\"They had congregated on the shore of the Adair around the body of a camel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And they have not touched our camels?\\\" we asked.\\n\\n\\\"We shall make a bonfire behind our tent; then they will not bother us.\\\"\\n\\nAfter our supper we turned in but I lay awake for a long time listening to the crackle of the wood in the fire, the deep sighing breaths of the camels and the distant howling of the packs of wolves; but finally, even with all these noises, fell asleep.  How long I had been asleep I did not know when suddenly I was awakened by a strong blow in the side.  I was lying at the very edge of the tent and someone from outside had, without the least ceremony, pushed strongly against me.  I thought it was one of the camels chewing the felt of the tent.  I took my Mauser and struck the wall.  A sharp scream was followed by the sound of quick running over the pebbles.  In the morning we discovered the tracks of wolves approaching our tent from the side opposite to the fire and followed them to where they had begun to dig under the tent wall; but evidently one of the would-be robbers was forced to retreat with a bruise on his head from the handle of the Mauser.\\n\\nWolves and eagles are the servants of Jagasstai, the Mongol very seriously instructed us.  However, this does not prevent the Mongols from hunting them.  Once in the camp of Prince Baysei I witnessed such a hunt.  The Mongol horsemen on the best of his steeds overtook the wolves on the open plain and killed them with heavy bamboo sticks or tashur.  A Russian veterinary surgeon taught the Mongols to poison wolves with strychnine but the Mongols soon abandoned this method because of its danger to the dogs, the faithful friends and allies of the nomad.  They do not, however, touch the eagles and hawks but even feed them.  When the Mongols are slaughtering animals they often cast bits of meat up into the air for the hawks and eagles to catch in flight, just as we throw a bit of meat to a dog.  Eagles and hawks fight and drive away the magpies and crows, which are very dangerous for cattle and horses, because they scratch and peck at the smallest wound or abrasion on the backs of the animals until they make them into uncurable areas which they continue to harass.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI\\n\\nTHE NEST OF DEATH\\n\\nOur camels were trudging to a slow but steady measure on toward the north.  We were making twenty-five to thirty miles a day as we approached a small monastery that lay to the left of our route.  It was in the form of a square of large buildings surrounded by a high fence of thick poles.  Each side had an opening in the middle leading to the four entrances of the temple in the center of the square.  The temple was built with the red lacquered columns and the Chinese style roofs and dominated the surrounding low dwellings of the Lamas.  On the opposite side of the road lay what appeared to be a Chinese fortress but which was in reality a trading compound or dugun, which the Chinese always build in the form of a fortress with double walls a few feet apart, within which they place their houses and shops and usually have twenty or thirty traders fully armed for any emergency.  In case of need these duguns can be used as blockhouses and are capable of withstanding long sieges.  Between the dugun and the monastery and nearer to the road I made out the camp of some nomads.  Their horses and cattle were nowhere to be seen.  Evidently the Mongols had stopped here for some time and had left their cattle in the mountains.  Over several yurtas waved multi-colored triangular flags, a sign of the presence of disease.  Near some yurtas high poles were stuck into the ground with Mongol caps at their tops, which indicated that the host of the yurta had died.  The packs of dogs wandering over the plain showed that the dead bodies lay somewhere near, either in the ravines or along the banks of the river.\\n\\nAs we approached the camp, we heard from a distance the frantic beating of drums, the mournful sounds of the flute and shrill, mad shouting.  Our Mongol went forward to investigate for us and reported that several Mongolian families had come here to the monastery to seek aid from the Hutuktu Jahansti who was famed for his miracles of healing.  The people were stricken with leprosy and black smallpox and had come from long distances only to find that the Hutuktu was not at the monastery but had gone to the Living Buddha in Urga.  Consequently they had been forced to invite the witch doctors.  The people were dying one after another.  Just the day before they had cast on the plain the twenty-seventh man.\\n\\nMeanwhile, as we talked, the witch doctor came out of one of the yurtas.  He was an old man with a cataract on one eye and with a face deeply scarred by smallpox.  He was dressed in tatters with various colored bits of cloth hanging down from his waist.  He carried a drum and a flute.  We could see froth on his blue lips and madness in his eyes.  Suddenly he began to whirl round and dance with a thousand prancings of his long legs and writhings of his arms and shoulders, still beating the drum and playing the flute or crying and raging at intervals, ever accelerating his movements until at last with pallid face and bloodshot eyes he fell on the snow, where he continued to writhe and give out his incoherent cries.  In this manner the doctor treated his patients, frightening with his madness the bad devils that carry disease. Another witch doctor gave his patients dirty, muddy water, which I learned was the water from the bath of the very person of the Living Buddha who had washed in it his \\\"divine\\\" body born from the sacred flower of the lotus.\\n\\n\\\"Om! Om!\\\" both witches continuously screamed.\\n\\nWhile the doctors fought with the devils, the ill people were left to themselves.  They lay in high fever under the heaps of sheepskins and overcoats, were delirious, raved and threw themselves about.  By the braziers squatted adults and children who were still well, indifferently chatting, drinking tea and smoking. In all the yurtas I saw the diseased and the dead and such misery and physical horrors as cannot be described.\\n\\nAnd I thought:  \\\"Oh, Great Jenghiz Khan!  Why did you with your keen understanding of the whole situation of Asia and Europe, you who devoted all your life to the glory of the name of the Mongols, why did you not give to your own people, who preserve their old morality, honesty and peaceful customs, the enlightenment that would have saved them from such death?  Your bones in the mausoleum at Karakorum being destroyed by the centuries that pass over them must cry out against the rapid disappearance of your formerly great people, who were feared by half the civilized world!\\\"\\n\\nSuch thoughts filled my brain when I saw this camp of the dead tomorrow and when I heard the groans, shoutings and raving of dying men, women and children.  Somewhere in the distance the dogs were howling mournfully, and monotonously the drum of the tired witch rolled.\\n\\n\\\"Forward!\\\"  I could not witness longer this dark horror, which I had no means or force to eradicate.  We quickly passed on from the ominous place.  Nor could we shake the thought that some horrible invisible spirit was following us from this scene of terror.  \\\"The devils of disease?\\\"  \\\"The pictures of horror and misery?\\\"  \\\"The souls of men who have been sacrificed on the altar of darkness of Mongolia?\\\"  An inexplicable fear penetrated into our consciousness from whose grasp we could not release ourselves.  Only when we had turned from the road, passed over a timbered ridge into a bowl in the mountains from which we could see neither Jahantsi Kure, the dugun nor the squirming grave of dying Mongols could we breathe freely again.\\n\\nPresently we discovered a large lake.  It was Tisingol.  Near the shore stood a large Russian house, the telegraph station between Kosogol and Uliassutai.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII\\n\\nAMONG THE MURDERERS\\n\\nAs we approached the telegraph station, we were met by a blonde young man who was in charge of the office, Kanine by name.  With some little confusion he offered us a place in his house for the night.  When we entered the room, a tall, lanky man rose from the table and indecisively walked toward us, looking very attentively at us the while.\\n\\n\\\"Guests . . .\\\" explained Kanine.  \\\"They are going to Khathyl. Private persons, strangers, foreigners . . .\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A-h,\\\" drawled the stranger in a quiet, comprehending tone.\\n\\nWhile we were untying our girdles and with difficulty getting out of our great Mongolian coats, the tall man was animatedly whispering something to our host.  As we approached the table to sit down and rest, I overheard him say:  \\\"We are forced to postpone it,\\\" and saw Kanine simply nod in answer.\\n\\nSeveral other people were seated at the table, among them the assistant of Kanine, a tall blonde man with a white face, who talked like a Gatling gun about everything imaginable.  He was half crazy and his semi-madness expressed itself when any loud talking, shouting or sudden sharp report led him to repeat the words of the one to whom he was talking at the time or to relate in a mechanical, hurried manner stories of what was happening around him just at this particular juncture.  The wife of Kanine, a pale, young, exhausted-looking woman with frightened eyes and a face distorted by fear, was also there and near her a young girl of fifteen with cropped hair and dressed like a man, as well as the two small sons of Kanine.  We made acquaintance with all of them. The tall stranger called himself Gorokoff, a Russian colonist from Samgaltai, and presented the short-haired girl as his sister. Kanine's wife looked at us with plainly discernible fear and said nothing, evidently displeased over our being there.  However, we had no choice and consequently began drinking tea and eating our bread and cold meat.\\n\\nKanine told us that ever since the telegraph line had been destroyed all his family and relatives had felt very keenly the poverty and hardship that naturally followed.  The Bolsheviki did not send him any salary from Irkutsk, so that he was compelled to shift for himself as best he could.  They cut and cured hay for sale to the Russian colonists, handled private messages and merchandise from Khathyl to Uliassutai and Samgaltai, bought and sold cattle, hunted and in this manner managed to exist.  Gorokoff announced that his commercial affairs compelled him to go to Khathyl and that he and his sister would be glad to join our caravan.  He had a most unprepossessing, angry-looking face with colorless eyes that always avoided those of the person with whom he was speaking.  During the conversation we asked Kanine if there were Russian colonists near by, to which he answered with knitted brow and a look of disgust on his face:\\n\\n\\\"There is one rich old man, Bobroff, who lives a verst away from our station; but I would not advise you to visit him.  He is a miserly, inhospitable old fellow who does not like guests.\\\"\\n\\nDuring these words of her husband Madame Kanine dropped her eyes and contracted her shoulders in something resembling a shudder. Gorokoff and his sister smoked along indifferently.  I very clearly remarked all this as well as the hostile tone of Kanine, the confusion of his wife and the artificial indifference of Gorokoff; and I determined to see the old colonist given such a bad name by Kanine.  In Uliassutai I knew two Bobroffs.  I said to Kanine that I had been asked to hand a letter personally to Bobroff and, after finishing my tea, put on my overcoat and went out.\\n\\nThe house of Bobroff stood in a deep sink in the mountains, surrounded by a high fence over which the low roofs of the houses could be seen.  A light shone through the window.  I knocked at the gate.  A furious barking of dogs answered me and through the cracks of the fence I made out four huge black Mongol dogs, showing their teeth and growling as they rushed toward the gate.  Inside the court someone opened the door and called out:  \\\"Who is there?\\\"\\n\\nI answered that I was traveling through from Uliassutai.  The dogs were first caught and chained and I was then admitted by a man who looked me over very carefully and inquiringly from head to foot.  A revolver handle stuck out of his pocket.  Satisfied with his observations and learning that I knew his relatives, he warmly welcomed me to the house and presented me to his wife, a dignified old woman, and to his beautiful little adopted daughter, a girl of five years.  She had been found on the plain beside the dead body of her mother exhausted in her attempt to escape from the Bolsheviki in Siberia.\\n\\nBobroff told me that the Russian detachment of Kazagrandi had succeeded in driving the Red troops away from the Kosogol and that we could consequently continue our trip to Khathyl without danger.\\n\\n\\\"Why did you not stop with me instead of with those brigands?\\\" asked the old fellow.\\n\\nI began to question him and received some very important news.  It seemed that Kanine was a Bolshevik, the agent of the Irkutsk Soviet, and stationed here for purposes of observation.  However, now he was rendered harmless, because the road between him and Irkutsk was interrupted.  Still from Biisk in the Altai country had just come a very important commissar.\\n\\n\\\"Gorokoff?\\\" I asked.\\n\\n\\\"That's what he calls himself,\\\" replied the old fellow; \\\"but I am also from Biisk and I know everyone there.  His real name is Pouzikoff and the short-haired girl with him is his mistress.  He is the commissar of the 'Cheka' and she is the agent of this establishment.  Last August the two of them shot with their revolvers seventy bound officers from Kolchak's army.  Villainous, cowardly murderers!  Now they have come here for a reconnaissance. They wanted to stay in my house but I knew them too well and refused them place.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you do not fear him?\\\" I asked, remembering the different words and glances of these people as they sat at the table in the station.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" answered the old man.  \\\"I know how to defend myself and my family and I have a protector too--my son, such a shot, a rider and a fighter as does not exist in all Mongolia.  I am very sorry that you will not make the acquaintance of my boy.  He has gone off to the herds and will return only tomorrow evening.\\\"\\n\\nWe took most cordial leave of each other and I promised to stop with him on my return.\\n\\n\\\"Well, what yarns did Bobroff tell you about us?\\\" was the question with which Kanine and Gorokoff met me when I came back to the station.\\n\\n\\\"Nothing about you,\\\" I answered, \\\"because he did not even want to speak with me when he found out that I was staying in your house. What is the trouble between you?\\\" I asked of them, expressing complete astonishment on my face.\\n\\n\\\"It is an old score,\\\" growled Gorokoff.\\n\\n\\\"A malicious old churl,\\\" Kanine added in agreement, the while the frightened, suffering-laden eyes of his wife again gave expression to terrifying horror, as if she momentarily expected a deadly blow. Gorokoff began to pack his luggage in preparation for the journey with us the following morning.  We prepared our simple beds in an adjoining room and went to sleep.  I whispered to my friend to keep his revolver handy for anything that might happen but he only smiled as he dragged his revolver and his ax from his coat to place them under his pillow.\\n\\n\\\"This people at the outset seemed to me very suspicious,\\\" he whispered.  \\\"They are cooking up something crooked.  Tomorrow I shall ride behind this Gorokoff and shall prepare for him a very faithful one of my bullets, a little dum-dum.\\\"\\n\\nThe Mongols spent the night under their tent in the open court beside their camels, because they wanted to be near to feed them. About seven o'clock we started.  My friend took up his post as rear guard to our caravan, keeping all the time behind Gorokoff, who with his sister, both armed from tip to toe, rode splendid mounts.\\n\\n\\\"How have you kept your horses in such fine condition coming all the way from Samgaltai?\\\" I inquired as I looked over their fine beasts.\\n\\nWhen he answered that these belonged to his host, I realized that Kanine was not so poor as he made out; for any rich Mongol would have given him in exchange for one of these lovely animals enough sheep to have kept his household in mutton for a whole year.\\n\\nSoon we came to a large swamp surrounded by dense brush, where I was much astonished by seeing literally hundreds of white kuropatka or partridges.  Out of the water rose a flock of duck with a mad rush as we hove in sight.  Winter, cold driving wind, snow and wild ducks!  The Mongol explained it to me thus:\\n\\n\\\"This swamp always remains warm and never freezes.  The wild ducks live here the year round and the kuropatka too, finding fresh food in the soft warm earth.\\\"\\n\\nAs I was speaking with the Mongol I noticed over the swamp a tongue of reddish-yellow flame.  It flashed and disappeared at once but later, on the farther edge, two further tongues ran upward.  I realized that here was the real will-o'-the-wisp surrounded by so many thousands of legends and explained so simply by chemistry as merely a flash of methane or swamp gas generated by the putrefying of vegetable matter in the warm damp earth.\\n\\n\\\"Here dwell the demons of Adair, who are in perpetual war with those of Muren,\\\" explained the Mongol.\\n\\n\\\"Indeed,\\\" I thought, \\\"if in prosaic Europe in our days the inhabitants of our villages believe these flames to be some wild sorcery, then surely in the land of mystery they must be at least the evidences of war between the demons of two neighboring rivers!\\\"\\n\\nAfter passing this swamp we made out far ahead of us a large monastery.  Though this was some half mile off the road, the Gorokoffs said they would ride over to it to make some purchases in the Chinese shops there.  They quickly rode away, promising to overtake us shortly, but we did not see them again for a while. They slipped away without leaving any trail but we met them later in very unexpected circumstances of fatal portent for them.  On our part we were highly satisfied that we were rid of them so soon and, after they were gone, I imparted to my friend the information gleaned from Bobroff the evening before.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\n\\nON A VOLCANO\\n\\nThe following evening we arrived at Khathyl, a small Russian settlement of ten scattered houses in the valley of the Egingol or Yaga, which here takes its waters from the Kosogol half a mile above the village.  The Kosogol is a huge Alpine lake, deep and cold, eighty-five miles in length and from ten to thirty in width. On the western shore live the Darkhat Soyots, who call it Hubsugul, the Mongols, Kosogol.  Both the Soyots and Mongols consider this a terrible and sacred lake.  It is very easy to understand this prejudice because the lake lies in a region of present volcanic activity, where in the summer on perfectly calm sunny days it sometimes lashes itself into great waves that are dangerous not only to the native fishing boats but also to the large Russian passenger steamers that ply on the lake.  In winter also it sometimes entirely breaks up its covering of ice and gives off great clouds of steam.  Evidently the bottom of the lake is sporadically pierced by discharging hot springs or, perhaps, by streams of lava.  Evidence of some great underground convulsion like this is afforded by the mass of killed fish which at times dams the outlet river in its shallow places.  The lake is exceedingly rich in fish, chiefly varieties of trout and salmon, and is famous for its wonderful \\\"white fish,\\\" which was previously sent all over Siberia and even down into Manchuria so far as Moukden.  It is fat and remarkably tender and produces fine caviar. Another variety in the lake is the white khayrus or trout, which in the migration season, contrary to the customs of most fish, goes down stream into the Yaga, where it sometimes fills the river from bank to bank with swarms of backs breaking the surface of the water.  However, this fish is not caught, because it is infested with worms and is unfit for food.  Even cats and dogs will not touch it.  This is a very interesting phemonenon and was being investigated and studied by Professor Dorogostaisky of the University at Irkutsk when the coming of the Bolsheviki interrupted his work.\",\"timestamp\":1640140167,\"title\":\"\\nAfter our return to Uliassutai we heard that disquieting news had been received by the Mongol Sait from Muren Kure.\"},\"digest\":\"Ddm68EYybcelgGrDFZmAKqGr7rW47lsyFTR3KVTbRJk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x98485E752AD42d721892AE055281b72F1cA81833\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HbOhOYwvzS7cJet6qDKSMAbOLx80V4BRJmydNtkLtJQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3kvz1edmp9cPDwKBOw2cp3mTaiEEAqEGr0EOhDnT7aY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"M2zJxWsPBtR7pdVD4uXza_mBkPBK_3fE3ZSMJDwdsmcUj_ykVWqHhnlcQ7UeeEo6HTKUZP3GLesFFHBN6RM9zQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4b5009f30cf6ff743cce0f588c0ef1842e59542f72df694488cf4bf9facabab376d345f8db9b7cc4cc93e0e15cc82dbe4073df61042d71e9af51ac8c914687211b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HbOhOYwvzS7cJet6qDKSMAbOLx80V4BRJmydNtkLtJQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3kvz1edmp9cPDwKBOw2cp3mTaiEEAqEGr0EOhDnT7aY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Ddm68EYybcelgGrDFZmAKqGr7rW47lsyFTR3KVTbRJk\"}"
