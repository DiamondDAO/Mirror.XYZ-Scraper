"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"weapons with razor-edges, capable of decapitating a man at a stroke.  Towels, sheets, shirts, and slippers, along with toothbrushes, wisp-brooms, soap, the missing billiard ball, and all the lost and forgotten trifles of many months, came to light.  But most astonishing was the quantity of ammunition-cartridges for Lee-Metfords, for Winchesters and Marlins, for revolvers from thirty-two calibre to forty-five, shot- gun cartridges, Joan's two boxes of thirty-eight, cartridges of prodigious bore for the ancient Sniders of Malaita, flasks of black powder, sticks of dynamite, yards of fuse, and boxes of detonators. But the great find was in the house occupied by Gogoomy and five Port Adams recruits.  The fact that the boxes yielded nothing excited Sheldon's suspicions, and he gave orders to dig up the earthen floor.  Wrapped in matting, well oiled, free from rust, and brand new, two Winchesters were first unearthed.  Sheldon did not recognize them.  They had not come from Berande; neither had the forty flasks of black powder found under the corner-post of the house; and while he could not be sure, he could remember no loss of eight boxes of detonators.  A big Colt's revolver he recognized as Hughie Drummond's; while Joan identified a thirty-two Ivor and Johnson as a loss reported by Matapuu the first week he landed at Berande.  The absence of any cartridges made Sheldon persist in the digging up of the floor, and a fifty-pound flour tin was his reward.  With glowering eyes Gogoomy looked on while Sheldon took from the tin a hundred rounds each for the two Winchesters and fully as many rounds more of nondescript cartridges of all sorts and makes and calibres.\\n\\nThe contraband and stolen property was piled in assorted heaps on the back veranda of the bungalow.  A few paces from the bottom of the steps were grouped the forty-odd culprits, with behind them, in solid array, the several hundred blacks of the plantation.  At the head of the steps Joan and Sheldon were seated, while on the steps stood the gang-bosses.  One by one the culprits were called up and examined.  Nothing definite could be extracted from them.  They lied transparently, but persistently, and when caught in one lie explained it away with half a dozen others.  One boy complacently announced that he had found eleven sticks of dynamite on the beach. Matapuu's revolver, found in the box of one Kapu, was explained away by that boy as having been given to him by Lervumie. Lervumie, called forth to testify, said he had got it from Noni; Noni had got it from Sulefatoi; Sulefatoi from Choka; Choka from Ngava; and Ngava completed the circle by stating that it had been given to him by Kapu.  Kapu, thus doubly damned, calmly gave full details of how it had been given to him by Lervumie; and Lervumie, with equal wealth of detail, told how he had received it from Noni; and from Noni to Sulefatoi it went on around the circle again.\\n\\nDivers articles were traced indubitably to the house-boys, each of whom steadfastly proclaimed his own innocence and cast doubts on his fellows.  The boy with the billiard ball said that he had never seen it in his life before, and hazarded the suggestion that it had got into his box through some mysterious and occultly evil agency. So far as he was concerned it might have dropped down from heaven for all he knew how it got there.  To the cooks and boats'-crews of every vessel that had dropped anchor off Berande in the past several years were ascribed the arrival of scores of the stolen articles and of the major portion of the ammunition.  There was no tracing the truth in any of it, though it was without doubt that the unidentified weapons and unfamiliar cartridges had come ashore off visiting craft.\\n\\n\\\"Look at it,\\\" Sheldon said to Joan.  \\\"We've been sleeping over a volcano.  They ought to be whipped--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No whip me,\\\" Gogoomy cried out from below.  \\\"Father belong me big fella chief.  Me whip, too much trouble along you, close up, my word.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What name you fella Gogoomy!\\\" Sheldon shouted.  \\\"I knock seven bells out of you.  Here, you Kwaque, put 'm irons along that fella Gogoomy.\\\"\\n\\nKwaque, a strapping gang-boss, plucked Gogoomy from out of his following, and, helped by the other gang-bosses; twisted his arms behind him and snapped on the heavy handcuffs.\\n\\n\\\"Me finish along you, close up, you die altogether,\\\" Gogoomy, with wrath-distorted face, threatened the boss-boy.\\n\\n\\\"Please, no whipping,\\\" Joan said in a low voice.  \\\"If whipping IS necessary, send them to Tulagi and let the Government do it.  Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.\\\"\\n\\nSheldon nodded and stood up, facing the blacks.\\n\\n\\\"Manonmie!\\\" he called.\\n\\nManonmie stood forth and waited.\\n\\n\\\"You fella boy bad fella too much,\\\" Sheldon charged.  \\\"You steal 'm plenty.  You steal 'm one fella towel, one fella cane-knife, two- ten fella cartridge.  My word, plenty bad fella steal 'm you.  Me cross along you too much.  S'pose you like 'm, me take 'm one fella pound along you in big book.  S'pose you no like 'm me take 'm one fella pound, then me send you fella along Tulagi catch 'm one strong fella government whipping.  Plenty New Georgia boys, plenty Ysabel boys stop along jail along Tulagi.  Them fella no like Malaita boys little bit.  My word, they give 'm you strong fella whipping.  What you say?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You take 'm one fella pound along me,\\\" was the answer.\\n\\nAnd Manonmie, patently relieved, stepped back, while Sheldon entered the fine in the plantation labour journal.\\n\\nBoy after boy, he called the offenders out and gave them their choice; and, boy by boy, each one elected to pay the fine imposed. Some fines were as low as several shillings; while in the more serious cases, such as thefts of guns and ammunition, the fines were correspondingly heavy.\\n\\nGogoomy and his five tribesmen were fined three pounds each, and at Gogoomy's guttural command they refused to pay.\\n\\n\\\"S'pose you go along Tulagi,\\\" Sheldon warned him, \\\"you catch 'm strong fella whipping and you stop along jail three fella year. Mr. Burnett, he look 'm along Winchester, look 'm along cartridge, look 'm along revolver, look 'm along black powder, look 'm along dynamite--my word, he cross too much, he give you three fella year along jail.  S'pose you no like 'm pay three fella pound you stop along jail.  Savvee?\\\"\\n\\nGogoomy wavered.\\n\\n\\\"It's true--that's what Burnett would give them,\\\" Sheldon said in an aside to Joan.\\n\\n\\\"You take 'm three fella pound along me,\\\" Gogoomy muttered, at the same time scowling his hatred at Sheldon, and transferring half the scowl to Joan and Kwaque.  \\\"Me finish along you, you catch 'm big fella trouble, my word.  Father belong me big fella chief along Port Adams.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That will do,\\\" Sheldon warned him.  \\\"You shut mouth belong you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Me no fright,\\\" the son of a chief retorted, by his insolence increasing his stature in the eyes of his fellows.\\n\\n\\\"Lock him up for to-night,\\\" Sheldon said to Kwaque.  \\\"Sun he come up put 'm that fella and five fella belong him along grass-cutting. Savvee?\\\"\\n\\nKwaque grinned.\\n\\n\\\"Me savvee,\\\" he said.  \\\"Cut 'm grass, ngari-ngari {4} stop 'm along grass.  My word!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There will be trouble with Gogoomy yet,\\\" Sheldon said to Joan, as the boss-boys marshalled their gangs and led them away to their work.  \\\"Keep an eye on him.  Be careful when you are riding alone on the plantation.  The loss of those Winchesters and all that ammunition has hit him harder than your cuffing did.  He is dead- ripe for mischief.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII--GOGOOMY FINISHES ALONG KWAQUE ALTOGETHER\\n\\n\\\"I wonder what has become of Tudor.  It's two months since he disappeared into the bush, and not a word of him after he left Binu.\\\"\\n\\nJoan Lackland was sitting astride her horse by the bank of the Balesuna where the sweet corn had been planted, and Sheldon, who had come across from the house on foot, was leaning against her horse's shoulder.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, it is along time for no news to have trickled down,\\\" he answered, watching her keenly from under his hat-brim and wondering as to the measure of her anxiety for the adventurous gold-hunter; \\\"but Tudor will come out all right.  He did a thing at the start that I wouldn't have given him or any other man credit for-- persuaded Binu Charley to go along with him.  I'll wager no other Binu nigger has ever gone so far into the bush unless to be kai- kai'd.  As for Tudor--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Look!  look!\\\" Joan cried in a low voice, pointing across the narrow stream to a slack eddy where a huge crocodile drifted like a log awash.  \\\"My!  I wish I had my rifle.\\\"\\n\\nThe crocodile, leaving scarcely a ripple behind, sank down and disappeared.\\n\\n\\\"A Binu man was in early this morning--for medicine,\\\" Sheldon remarked.  \\\"It may have been that very brute that was responsible. A dozen of the Binu women were out, and the foremost one stepped right on a big crocodile.  It was by the edge of the water, and he tumbled her over and got her by the leg.  All the other women got hold of her and pulled.  And in the tug of war she lost her leg, below the knee, he said.  I gave him a stock of antiseptics. She'll pull through, I fancy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ugh--the filthy beasts,\\\" Joan gulped shudderingly.  \\\"I hate them! I hate them!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And yet you go diving among sharks,\\\" Sheldon chided.\",\"timestamp\":1639040687,\"title\":\"A wealth of loot was recovered.
