"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"With the development of the society, more and more people enroll in the postgraduate examination for getting a higher diploma. Most companies are inclined to hire the people with high diploma.\\n\\nHowever, is it really true that high diploma equals to high ability or profound knowledge? Some people do not agree on this kind of idea. They claim that ability or knowledge means more than diploma. Take Bill Gates, the head of the Microsoft, for example, he does not have a MBA degree which is believed to play a vital role in the success in commercial life.  \\n \\n\\nIn my opinion, diploma is not equal to knowledge. A diploma is a piece of paper which establishes your education degree. But your ability and the real knowledge come from your hard work and endowment. If you got a diploma by dishonest behavior, no matter how high a diploma it is, it is just a piece of paper, and you are as blank as that paper.\",\"timestamp\":1641039941,\"title\":\"Knowledge and Diploma\"},\"digest\":\"-V9fvpxl7drjLH-PzN1PtwRsj1FfsZWOHTBiFbONYXg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x91021a3C9B1534Af9Dae312B5258Be6335dF1EFD\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"F-0Ac7c3Hwk9pfpr01pEp3mJ9Id9RD5jxWTE39yU0jQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zAWTUyS3kdcrDChOPvSnYMrYf31d7JdPG8T_-oCvOzg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"EoBFRk3GBZIexsM45QawpkTyev5_P4lyy9rMbCWpveU_niH6QQBP9IsrwZ-9v5eHj-2kmGs-ZviSroFUA8yosA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xafee3302eda917464cd3965334dbf50d9b1759b8e72f3a40cce74034583622a645acde1297efefa6fdc2d4ad6e9fd3e6c76f75b3710805f48a0c68fab482179c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"F-0Ac7c3Hwk9pfpr01pEp3mJ9Id9RD5jxWTE39yU0jQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zAWTUyS3kdcrDChOPvSnYMrYf31d7JdPG8T_-oCvOzg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"-V9fvpxl7drjLH-PzN1PtwRsj1FfsZWOHTBiFbONYXg\"}"
