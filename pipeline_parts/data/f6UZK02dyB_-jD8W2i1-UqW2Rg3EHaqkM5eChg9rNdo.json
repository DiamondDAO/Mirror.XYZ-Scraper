"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"CityDAO is an experiment in decentralized ownership of real world assets. We came together from a [tweet](https://twitter.com/scottfits/status/1410724134468739076), and today we closed on a 40 acre parcel of land in Wyoming. The inspiration for the project was the [Wyoming DAO law](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/crypto-daos-and-the-wyoming-frontier-9251606/), which created a pathway for DAOs to own assets. \\n\\nWe came together in a Discord [community](https://discord.com/invite/2pzV6wnWZx) and used Mirror to [offer Citizenship NFTs](https://city.mirror.xyz/TRMrm5r5CYtYwaG3G4jG125pBv6dyuiTZ2FkBqskTBo) that gave holders the ability to vote on what land to acquire and how to use it.\\n\\nWe incorporated a Wyoming DAO LLC, for which the Articles of Incorporation became the inspiration for our Citizenship NFTs, pictured below. \\n\\n![Our Citizen NFTs that showcase the articles of incorporation overlaid on the state of Wyoming  ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6nRHu4A9YV2I7GHMbO-Hc.png?height=3910&width=10316)\\n\\nFinally, we bought our first piece of land, 40 acres near Cody, Wyoming (a few miles from where Kanye West owned a ranch). The terrain is rocky and not especially fertile, but this parcel is 45 minutes from an airport and has a well for water on site.\\n\\n![Planting the CityDAO flag](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0Rjw4igUr8K2zU9Llct3F.png?height=1916&width=1442)\\n\\n## The path forward\\n\\nThis is just the beginning. The CityDAO community is still deciding how to use this land, and what property to acquire next. See what we are up to on our official [website](https://www.citydao.io/) and join our Discord.\\n\\nRecently, Vitalik joined our Discord and [wrote about CityDAO](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/10/31/cities.html), exploring the benefits of using mechanism design and blockchains to improve systems like land use, zoning, governance, and resource rights.\\n\\n### Pictures from the land\\n\\nI visited Wyoming to explore the parcel before we purchased it. The land has a rugged, natural beauty.\\n\\n![Looking out over our parcel](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/awUSQrtoEa9bzSK0MnHuf.png?height=1788&width=1476)\\n\\n![Using Google Earth to outline our parcel in red.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iubOKRxrIl-etiPj3OerB.png?height=886&width=1322)\\n\\n![A well is available at the property](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9WRkcrFSLhKs4f5nzH19w.png?height=1424&width=1450)\\n\\n## Get involved\\n\\nCityDAO is exploring all the different ways DAOs can own assets in a decentralized way. The path ahead is uncharted - we are a group of explorers seeing how we can combine web3 with real assets to democratize and decentralize access to land and real estate. Perhaps we can share our tools with other DAOs, or just continue to acquire assets together. \\n\\n\\\\- the citizens of [citydao](https://citydao.io)\",\"timestamp\":1636218603,\"title\":\"How CityDAO Acquired the First DAO-Owned Land\",\"publication\":\"city\"},\"digest\":\"1brVmH5HPJ5gLtIEfzIiJj6od81eUCdkJYm7m10V1Aw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x33eD481F752f05A292346C71E16aFbB0fE548656\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LaEoGPIgiLffQjOT_O4EKtL9EIQoxJHPfk97p6kQ_DU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Pre3iYGntTsmqW4N6ymwD4qMPPShwIjyn4UoO6ZXDe8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"FVwFFeknq86ByO56smT4rG0Sva_577eOtPsdxZVKWJdNjHLsxu21pYw9dNVC0cPkU-F1RsjdXethDIGNQDdn6w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x252b9679b22b7a48d298e920dd1e418c1cce2fe319faef272ef07187c8bf061d460afd5e8248f8eca502896a2c6f975cf81cc3fdb6db1d9a63d2f0d7a8ab19e81b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LaEoGPIgiLffQjOT_O4EKtL9EIQoxJHPfk97p6kQ_DU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Pre3iYGntTsmqW4N6ymwD4qMPPShwIjyn4UoO6ZXDe8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"1brVmH5HPJ5gLtIEfzIiJj6od81eUCdkJYm7m10V1Aw\"}"
