"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"I wonder what's coming?\\\" said Winifred in a voice dreamy from pigeon-pie.  \\\"I'm not at all sure we shan't go back to crinolines and pegtops.  Look at that dress!\\\"\\n\\nSoames shook his head.\\n\\n\\\"There's money, but no faith in things.  We don't lay by for the future.  These youngsters--it's all a short life and a merry one with them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There's a hat!\\\" said Winifred.  \\\"I don't know--when you come to think of the people killed and all that in the War, it's rather wonderful, I think.  There's no other country--Prosper says the rest are all bankrupt, except America; and of course her men always took their style in dress from us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is that chap,\\\" said Soames, \\\"really going to the South Seas?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh! one never knows where Prosper's going!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He's a sign of the times,\\\" muttered Soames, \\\"if you like.\\\"\\n\\nWinifred's hand gripped his arm.\\n\\n\\\"Don't turn your head,\\\" she said in a low voice, \\\"but look to your right in the front row of the Stand.\\\"\\n\\nSoames looked as best he could under that limitation.  A man in a grey top hat, grey-bearded, with thin brown, folded cheeks, and a certain elegance of posture, sat there with a woman in a lawn- coloured frock, whose dark eyes were fixed on himself.  Soames looked quickly at his feet.  How funnily feet moved, one after the other like that!  Winifred's voice said in his ear:\\n\\n\\\"Jolyon looks very ill; but he always had style.  She doesn't change- -except her hair.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why did you tell Fleur about that business?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I didn't; she picked it up.  I always knew she would.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, it's a mess.  She's set her heart upon their boy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The little wretch,\\\" murmured Winifred.  \\\"She tried to take me in about that.  What shall you do, Soames?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Be guided by events.\\\"\\n\\nThey moved on, silent, in the almost solid crowd.\\n\\n\\\"Really,\\\" said Winifred suddenly; \\\"it almost seems like Fate.  Only that's so old-fashioned.  Look! there are George and Eustace!\\\"\\n\\nGeorge Forsyte's lofty bulk had halted before them.\\n\\n\\\"Hallo, Soames!\\\" he said.  \\\"Just met Profond and your wife.  You'll catch 'em if you put on pace.  Did you ever go to see old Timothy?\\\"\\n\\nSoames nodded, and the streams forced them apart.\\n\\n\\\"I always liked old George,\\\" said Winifred.  \\\"He's so droll.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I never did,\\\" said Soames.  \\\"Where's your seat?  I shall go to mine. Fleur may be back there.\\\"\\n\\nHaving seen Winifred to her seat, he regained his own, conscious of small, white, distant figures running, the click of the bat, the cheers and counter-cheers.  No Fleur, and no Annette!  You could expect nothing of women nowadays!  They had the vote.  They were \\\"emancipated,\\\" and much good it was doing them!  So Winifred would go back, would she, and put up with Dartie all over again?  To have the past once more--to be sitting here as he had sat in '83 and '84, before he was certain that his marriage with Irene had gone all wrong, before her antagonism had become so glaring that with the best will in the world he could not overlook it.  The sight of her with that fellow had brought all memory back.  Even now he could not understand why she had been so impracticable.  She could love other men; she had it in her!  To himself, the one person she ought to have loved, she had chosen to refuse her heart.  It seemed to him, fantastically, as he looked back, that all this modern relaxation of marriage--though its forms and laws were the same as when he married her--that all this modern looseness had come out of her revolt; it seemed to him, fantastically, that she had started it, till all decent ownership of anything had gone, or was on the point of going. All came from her!  And now--a pretty state of things!  Homes!  How could you have them without mutual ownership?  Not that he had ever had a real home!  But had that been his fault?  He had done his best. And his rewards were--those two sitting in that Stand, and this affair of Fleur's!\\n\\nAnd overcome by loneliness he thought: 'Shan't wait any longer!  They must find their own way back to the hotel--if they mean to come!' Hailing a cab outside the ground, he said:\\n\\n\\\"Drive me to the Bayswater Road.\\\"  His old aunts had never failed him.  To them he had meant an ever-welcome visitor.  Though they were gone, there, still, was Timothy!\\n\\nSmither was standing in the open doorway.\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Soames!  I was just taking the air.  Cook will be so pleased.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How is Mr. Timothy?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not himself at all these last few days, sir; he's been talking a great deal.  Only this morning he was saying: 'My brother James, he's getting old.'  His mind wanders, Mr. Soames, and then he will talk of them.  He troubles about their investments.  The other day he said: 'There's my brother Jolyon won't look at Consols'--he seemed quite down about it.  Come in, Mr. Soames, come in!  It's such a pleasant change!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Soames, \\\"just for a few minutes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" murmured Smither in the hall, where the air had the singular freshness of the outside day, \\\"we haven't been very satisfied with him, not all this week.  He's always been one to leave a titbit to the end; but ever since Monday he's been eating it first.  If you notice a dog, Mr. Soames, at its dinner, it eats the meat first. We've always thought it such a good sign of Mr. Timothy at his age to leave it to the last, but now he seems to have lost all his self- control; and, of course, it makes him leave the rest.  The doctor doesn't make anything of it, but\\\"--Smither shook her head--\\\"he seems to think he's got to eat it first, in case he shouldn't get to it. That and his talking makes us anxious.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Has he said anything important?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I shouldn't like to say that, Mr. Soames; but he's turned against his Will.  He gets quite pettish--and after having had it out every morning for years, it does seem funny.  He said the other day: 'They want my money.'  It gave me such a turn, because, as I said to him, nobody wants his money, I'm sure.  And it does seem a pity he should be thinking about money at his time of life.  I took my courage in my 'ands.  'You know, Mr. Timothy,' I said, 'my dear mistress'--that's Miss Forsyte, Mr. Soames, Miss Ann that trained me--'she never thought about money,' I said, 'it was all character with her.'  He looked at me, I can't tell you how funny, and he said quite dry: 'Nobody wants my character.'  Think of his saying a thing like that! But sometimes he'll say something as sharp and sensible as anything.\\\"\\n\\nSoames, who had been staring at an old print by the hat-rack, thinking, 'That's got value!'  murmured: \\\"I'll go up and see him, Smither.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Cook's with him,\\\" answered Smither above her corsets; \\\"she will be pleased to see you.\\\"\\n\\nHe mounted slowly, with the thought: 'Shan't care to live to be that age.'\\n\\nOn the second floor, he paused, and tapped.  The door was opened, and he saw the round homely face of a woman about sixty.\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Soames!\\\" she said: \\\"Why!  Mr. Soames!\\\"\\n\\nSoames nodded.  \\\"All right, Cook!\\\" and entered.\\n\\nTimothy was propped up in bed, with his hands joined before his chest, and his eyes fixed on the ceiling, where a fly was standing upside down.  Soames stood at the foot of the bed, facing him.\\n\\n\\\"Uncle Timothy,\\\" he said, raising his voice.  \\\"Uncle Timothy!\\\"\\n\\nTimothy's eyes left the fly, and levelled themselves on his visitor. Soames could see his pale tongue passing over his darkish lips.\\n\\n\\\"Uncle Timothy,\\\" he said again, \\\"is there anything I can do for you? Is there anything you'd like to say?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ha!\\\" said Timothy.\\n\\n\\\"I've come to look you up and see that everything's all right.\\\"\\n\\nTimothy nodded.  He seemed trying to get used to the apparition before him.\\n\\n\\\"Have you got everything you want?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said Timothy.\\n\\n\\\"Can I get you anything?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said Timothy.\\n\\n\\\"I'm Soames, you know; your nephew, Soames Forsyte.  Your brother James' son.\\\"\\n\\nTimothy nodded.\\n\\n\\\"I shall be delighted to do anything I can for you.\\\"\\n\\nTimothy beckoned.  Soames went close to him:\\n\\n\\\"You--\\\" said Timothy in a voice which seemed to have outlived tone, \\\"you tell them all from me--you tell them all--\\\" and his finger tapped on Soames' arm, \\\"to hold on--hold on--Consols are goin' up,\\\" and he nodded thrice.\\n\\n\\\"All right!\\\" said Soames; \\\"I will.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Timothy, and, fixing his eyes again on the ceiling, he added: \\\"That fly!\\\"\\n\\nStrangely moved, Soames looked at the Cook's pleasant fattish face, all little puckers from staring at fires.\\n\\n\\\"That'll do him a world of good, sir,\\\" she said.\\n\\nA mutter came from Timothy, but he was clearly speaking to himself, and Soames went out with the cook.\\n\\n\\\"I wish I could make you a pink cream, Mr. Soames, like in old days; you did so relish them.  Good-bye, sir; it has been a pleasure.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Take care of him, Cook, he is old.\\\"\\n\\nAnd, shaking her crumpled hand, he went down-stairs.  Smither was still taking the air in the doorway.\\n\\n\\\"What do you think of him, Mr. Soames?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"H'm!\\\" Soames murmured: \\\"He's lost touch.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Smither, \\\"I was afraid you'd think that coming fresh out of the world to see him like.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Smither,\\\" said Soames, \\\"we're all indebted to you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no, Mr. Soames, don't say that!  It's a pleasure--he's such a wonderful man.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, good-bye!\\\" said Soames, and got into his taxi.\\n\\n'Going up!' he thought; 'going up!'\\n\\nReaching the hotel at Knightsbridge he went to their sitting-room, and rang for tea.  Neither of them were in.  And again that sense of loneliness came over him.  These hotels.  What monstrous great places they were now!  He could remember when there was nothing bigger than Long's or Brown's, Morley's or the Tavistock, and the heads that were shaken over the Langham and the Grand.  Hotels and Clubs--Clubs and Hotels; no end to them now!  And Soames, who had just been watching at Lord's a miracle of tradition and continuity, fell into reverie over the changes in that London where he had been born five-and-sixty years before.  Whether Consols were going up or not, London had become a terrific property.  No such property in the world, unless it were New York!  There was a lot of hysteria in the papers nowadays; but any one who, like himself, could remember London sixty years ago, and see it now, realised the fecundity and elasticity of wealth. They had only to keep their heads, and go at it steadily.  Why! he remembered cobblestones, and stinking straw on the floor of your cab. And old Timothy--what could be not have told them, if he had kept his memory!  Things were unsettled, people in a funk or in a hurry, but here were London and the Thames, and out there the British Empire, and the ends of the earth.  \\\"Consols are goin' up!\\\"  He should n't be a bit surprised.  It was the breed that counted.  And all that was bull-dogged in Soames stared for a moment out of his grey eyes, till diverted by the print of a Victorian picture on the walls.  The hotel had bought three dozen of that little lot!  The old hunting or \\\"Rake's Progress\\\" prints in the old inns were worth looking at--but this sentimental stuff--well, Victorianism had gone!  \\\"Tell them to hold on!\\\" old Timothy had said.  But to what were they to hold on in this modern welter of the \\\"democratic principle\\\"?  Why, even privacy was threatened!  And at the thought that privacy might perish, Soames pushed back his teacup and went to the window.  Fancy owning no more of Nature than the crowd out there owned of the flowers and trees and waters of Hyde Park!  No, no! Private possession underlay everything worth having.  The world had slipped its sanity a bit, as dogs now and again at full moon slipped theirs and went off for a night's rabbiting; but the world, like the dog, knew where its bread was buttered and its bed warm, and would come back sure enough to the only home worth having--to private ownership.  The world was in its second childhood for the moment, like old Timothy--eating its titbit first!\\n\\nHe heard a sound behind him, and saw that his wife and daughter had come in.\\n\\n\\\"So you're back!\\\" he said.\\n\\nFleur did not answer; she stood for a moment looking at him and her mother, then passed into her bedroom.  Annette poured herself out a cup of tea.\\n\\n\\\"I am going to Paris, to my mother, Soames.\\\"  \\\"Oh! To your mother?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For how long?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do not know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And when are you going?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"On Monday.\\\"\\n\\nWas she really going to her mother?  Odd, how indifferent he felt! Odd, how clearly she had perceived the indifference he would feel so long as there was no scandal.  And suddenly between her and himself he saw distinctly the face he had seen that afternoon--Irene's.\\n\\n\\\"Will you want money?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thank you; I have enough.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well.  Let us know when you are coming back.\\\"\\n\\nAnnette put down the cake she was fingering, and, looking up through darkened lashes, said:\\n\\n\\\"Shall I give Maman any message?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My regards.\\\"\\n\\nAnnette stretched herself, her hands on her waist, and said in French:\\n\\n\\\"What luck that you have never loved me, Soames!\\\"  Then rising, she too left the room.  Soames was glad she had spoken it in French--it seemed to require no dealing with.  Again that other face--pale, dark-eyed, beautiful still!  And there stirred far down within him the ghost of warmth, as from sparks lingering beneath a mound of flaky ash.  And Fleur infatuated with her boy!  Queer chance!  Yet, was there such a thing as chance?  A man went down a street, a brick fell on his head.  Ah! that was chance, no doubt.  But this! \\\"Inherited,\\\" his girl had said.  She--she was \\\"holding on\\\"!\\n\\nPART III\\n\\nI\\n\\nOLD JOLYON WALKS\\n\\nTwofold impulse had made Jolyon say to his wife at breakfast \\\"Let's go up to Lord's!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Wanted\\\"--something to abate the anxiety in which those two had lived during the sixty hours since Jon had brought Fleur down.  \\\"Wanted\\\"-- too, that which might assuage the pangs of memory in one who knew he might lose them any day!\\n\\nFifty-eight years ago Jolyon had become an Eton boy, for old Jolyon's whim had been that he should be canonised at the greatest possible expense.  Year after year he had gone to Lord's from Stanhope Gate with a father whose youth in the eighteen-twenties had been passed without polish in the game of cricket.  Old Jolyon would speak quite openly of swipes, full tosses, half and three-quarter balls; and young Jolyon with the guileless snobbery of youth had trembled lest his sire should be overheard.  Only in this supreme matter of cricket he had been nervous, for his father--in Crimean whiskers then--had ever impressed him as the beau ideal.  Though never canonised himself, Old Jolyon's natural fastidiousness and balance had saved him from the errors of the vulgar.  How delicious, after howling in a top hat and a sweltering heat, to go home with his father in a hansom cab, bathe, dress, and forth to the \\\"Disunion\\\" Club, to dine off white bait, cutlets, and a tart, and go--two \\\"swells,\\\" old and young, in lavender kid gloves--to the opera or play.  And on Sunday, when the match was over, and his top hat duly broken, down with his father in a special hansom to the \\\"Crown and Sceptre,\\\" and the terrace above the river--the golden sixties when the world was simple, dandies glamorous, Democracy not born, and the books of Whyte Melville coming thick and fast.\\n\\nA generation later, with his own boy, Jolly, Harrow-buttonholed with corn-flowers--by old Jolyon's whim his grandson had been canonised at a trifle less expense--again Jolyon had experienced the heat and counter-passions of the day, and come back to the cool and the strawberry beds of Robin Hill, and billiards after dinner, his boy making the most heart-breaking flukes and trying to seem languid and grown-up.  Those two days each year he and his son had been alone together in the world, one on each side--and Democracy just born!\\n\\nAnd so, he had unearthed a grey top hat, borrowed a tiny bit of light-blue ribbon from Irene, and gingerly, keeping cool, by car and train and taxi, had reached Lord's Ground.  There, beside her in a lawn-coloured frock with narrow black edges, he had watched the game, and felt the old thrill stir within him.\\n\\nWhen Soames passed, the day was spoiled.  Irene's face was distorted by compression of the lips.  No good to go on sitting here with Soames or perhaps his daughter recurring in front of them, like decimals.  And he said:\\n\\n\\\"Well, dear, if you've had enough--let's go!\\\"\\n\\nThat evening Jolyon felt exhausted.  Not wanting her to see him thus, he waited till she had begun to play, and stole off to the little study.  He opened the long window for air, and the door, that he might still hear her music drifting in; and, settled in his father's old armchair, closed his eyes, with his head against the worn brown leather.  Like that passage of the Cesar Franck Sonata--so had been his life with her, a divine third movement.  And now this business of Jon's--this bad business!  Drifted to the edge of consciousness, he hardly knew if it were in sleep that he smelled the scent of a cigar, and seemed to see his father in the blackness before his closed eyes. That shape formed, went, and formed again; as if in the very chair where he himself was sitting, he saw his father, black-coated, with. knees crossed, glasses balanced between thumb and finger; saw the big white moustaches, and the deep eyes looking up below a dome of forehead and seeming to search his own, seeming to speak.  \\\"Are you facing it, Jo?  It's for you to decide.  She's only a woman!\\\"  Ah! how well he knew his father in that phrase; how all the Victorian Age came up with it!  And his answer \\\"No, I've funked it--funked hurting her and Jon and myself.  I've got a heart; I've funked it.\\\"  But the old eyes, so much older, so much younger than his own, kept at it; \\\"It's your wife, your son; your past.  Tackle it, my boy!\\\"  Was it a message from walking spirit; or but the instinct of his sire living on within him?  And again came that scent of cigar smoke-from the old saturated leather.  Well! he would tackle it, write to Jon, and put the whole thing down in black and white!  And suddenly he breathed with difficulty, with a sense of suffocation, as if his heart were swollen.  He got up and went out into the air.  The stars were very bright.  He passed along the terrace round the corner of the house, till, through the window of the music-room, he could see Irene at the piano, with lamp-light falling on her powdery hair; withdrawn into herself she seemed, her dark eyes staring straight before her, her hands idle.  Jolyon saw her raise those hands and clasp them over her breast.  'It's Jon, with her,' he thought; 'all Jon! I'm dying out of her--it's natural!'\\n\\nAnd, careful not to be seen, he stole back.\\n\\nNext day, after a bad night, he sat down to his task.  He wrote with difficulty and many erasures.\\n\\n\\\"MY DEAREST BOY,\\n\\n\\\"You are old enough to understand how very difficult it is for elders to give themselves away to their young.  Especially when--like your mother and myself, though I shall never think of her as anything but young--their hearts are altogether set on him to whom they must confess.  I cannot say we are conscious of having sinned exactly-- people in real life very seldom are, I believe--but most persons would say we had, and at all events our conduct, righteous or not, has found us out.  The truth is, my dear, we both have pasts, which it is now my task to make known to you, because they so grievously and deeply affect your future.  Many, very many years ago, as far back indeed as 1883, when she was only twenty, your mother had the great and lasting misfortune to make an unhappy marriage--no, not with me, Jon.  Without money of her own, and with only a stepmother-- closely related to Jezebel--she was very unhappy in her home life. It was Fleur's father that she married, my cousin Soames Forsyte.  He had pursued her very tenaciously and to do him justice was deeply in love with her.  Within a week she knew the fearful mistake she had made.  It was not his fault; it was her error of judgment--her misfortune.\\\"\\n\\nSo far Jolyon had kept some semblance of irony, but now his subject carried him away.\\n\\n\\\"Jon, I want to explain to you if I can--and it's very hard--how it is that an unhappy marriage such as this can so easily come about. You will of course say: 'If she didn't really love him how could she ever have married him?'  You would be right if it were not for one or two rather terrible considerations.  From this initial mistake of hers all the subsequent trouble, sorrow, and tragedy have come, and so I must make it clear to you if I can.  You see, Jon, in those days and even to this day--indeed, I don't see, for all the talk of enlightenment, how it can well be otherwise--most girls are married ignorant of the sexual side of life.  Even if they know what it means they have not experienced it.  That's the crux.  It is this actual lack of experience, whatever verbal knowledge they have, which makes all the difference and all the trouble.  In a vast number of marriages-and your mother's was one--girls are not and cannot be certain whether they love the man they marry or not; they do not know until after that act of union which makes the reality of marriage. Now, in many, perhaps in most doubtful cases, this act cements and strengthens the attachment, but in other cases, and your mother's was one, it is a revelation of mistake, a destruction of such attraction as there was.  There is nothing more tragic in a woman's life than such a revelation, growing daily, nightly clearer. Coarse-grained and unthinking people are apt to laugh at such a mistake, and say, 'What a fuss about nothing!'  Narrow and self- righteous people, only capable of judging the lives of others by their own, are apt to condemn those who make this tragic error, to condemn them for life to the dungeons they have made for themselves. You know the expression: 'She has made her bed, she must lie on it!' It is a hard-mouthed saying, quite unworthy of a gentleman or lady in the best sense of those words; and I can use no stronger condemnation.  I have not been what is called a moral man, but I wish to use no words to you, my dear, which will make you think lightly of ties or contracts into which you enter.  Heaven forbid!  But with the experience of a life behind me I do say that those who condemn the victims of these tragic mistakes, condemn them and hold out no hands to help them, are inhuman, or rather they would be if they had the understanding to know what they are doing.  But they haven't!  Let them go!  They are as much anathema to me as I, no doubt, am to them. I have had to say all this, because I am going to put you into a position to judge your mother, and you are very young, without experience of what life is.  To go on with the story.  After three years of effort to subdue her shrinking--I was going to say her loathing and it's not too strong a word, for shrinking soon becomes loathing under such circumstances--three years of what to a sensitive, beauty-loving nature like your mother's, Jon, was torment, she met a young man who fell in love with her.  He was the architect of this very house that we live in now, he was building it for her and Fleur's father to live in, a new prison to hold her, in place of the one she inhabited with him in London.  Perhaps that fact played some part in what came of it.  But in any case she, too, fell in love with him.  I know it's not necessary to explain to you that one does not precisely choose with whom one will fall in love.  It comes. Very well!  It came.  I can imagine--though she never said much to me about it--the struggle that then took place in her, because, Jon, she was brought up strictly and was not light in her ideas--not at all. However, this was an overwhelming feeling, and it came to pass that they loved in deed as well as in thought.  Then came a fearful tragedy.  I must tell you of it because if I don't you will never understand the real situation that you have now to face.  The man whom she had married--Soames Forsyte, the father of Fleur one night, at the height of her passion for this young man, forcibly reasserted his rights over her.  The next day she met her lover and told him of it.  Whether he committed suicide or whether he was accidentally run over in his distraction, we never knew; but so it was.  Think of your mother as she was that evening when she heard of his death.  I happened to see her.  Your grandfather sent me to help her if I could.  I only just saw her, before the door was shut against me by her husband.  But I have never forgotten her face, I can see it now. I was not in love with her then, not for twelve years after, but I have never for gotten.  My dear boy--it is not easy to write like this.  But you see, I must.  Your mother is wrapped up in you, utterly, devotedly.  I don't wish to write harshly of Soames Forsyte. I don't think harshly of him.  I have long been sorry for him; perhaps I was sorry even then.  As the world judges she was in error, he within his rights.  He loved her--in his way.  She was his property.  That is the view he holds of life--of human feelings and hearts--property.  It's not his fault--so was he born.  To me it is a view that has always been abhorrent--so was I born!  Knowing you as I do, I feel it cannot be otherwise than abhorrent to you.  Let me go on with the story.  Your mother fled from his house that night; for twelve years she lived quietly alone without companionship of any sort, until in 1899 her husband--you see, he was still her husband, for he did not attempt to divorce her, and she of course had no right to divorce him--became conscious, it seems, of the want of children, and commenced a long attempt to induce her to go back to him and give him a child.  I was her trustee then, under your Grandfather's Will, and I watched this going on.  While watching, I became attached to her, devotedly attached.  His pressure increased, till one day she came to me here and practically put herself under my protection.  Her husband, who was kept informed of all her movements, attempted to force us apart by bringing a divorce suit, or possibly he really meant it, I don't know; but anyway our names were publicly joined. That decided us, and we became united in fact.  She was divorced, married me, and you were born.  We have lived in perfect happiness, at least I have, and I believe your mother also.  Soames, soon after the divorce, married Fleur's mother, and she was born.  That is the story, Jon.  I have told it you, because by the affection which we see you have formed for this man's daughter you are blindly moving toward what must utterly destroy your mother's happiness, if not your own.  I don't wish to speak of myself, because at my age there's no use supposing I shall cumber the ground much longer, besides, what I should suffer would be mainly on her account, and on yours.  But what I want you to realise is that feelings of horror and aversion such as those can never be buried or forgotten. They are alive in her to-day. Only yesterday at Lord's we happened to see Soames Forsyte.  Her face, if you had seen it, would have convinced you.  The idea that you should marry his daughter is a nightmare to her, Jon.  I have nothing to say against Fleur save that she is his daughter.  But your children, if you married her, would be the grandchildren of Soames, as much as of your mother, of a man who once owned your mother as a man might own a slave.  Think what that would mean.  By such a marriage you enter the camp which held your mother prisoner and wherein she ate her heart out.  You are just on the threshold of life, you have only known this girl two months, and however deeply you think you love her, I appeal to you to break it off at once. Don't give your mother this rankling pain and humiliation during the rest of her life.  Young though she will always seem to me, she is fifty-seven.  Except for us two she has no one in the world.  She will soon have only you.  Pluck up your spirit, Jon, and break away. Don't put this cloud and barrier between you.  Don't break her heart! Bless you, my dear boy, and again forgive me for all the pain this letter must bring you--we tried to spare it you, but Spain--it seems- --was no good.\\n\\n\\\"Ever your devoted father\\n\\n\\\"JOLYON FORSYTE.\\\"\\n\\nHaving finished his confession, Jolyon sat with a thin cheek on his hand, re-reading.  There were things in it which hurt him so much, when he thought of Jon reading them, that he nearly tore the letter up.  To speak of such things at all to a boy--his own boy--to speak of them in relation to his own wife and the boy's own mother, seemed dreadful to the reticence of his Forsyte soul.  And yet without speaking of them how make Jon understand the reality, the deep cleavage, the ineffaceable scar?  Without them, how justify this stiffing of the boy's love?  He might just as well not write at all!\\n\\nHe folded the confession, and put it in his pocket.  It was--thank Heaven!--Saturday; he had till Sunday evening to think it over; for even if posted now it could not reach Jon till Monday.  He felt a curious relief at this delay, and at the fact that, whether sent or not, it was written.\\n\\nIn the rose garden, which had taken the place of the old fernery, he could see Irene snipping and pruning, with a little basket on her arm.  She was never idle, it seemed to him, and he envied her now that he himself was idle nearly all his time.  He went down to her. She held up a stained glove and smiled.  A piece of lace tied under her chin concealed her hair, and her oval face with its still dark brows looked very young.\\n\\n\\\"The green-fly are awful this year, and yet it's cold.  You look tired, Jolyon.\\\"\\n\\nJolyon took the confession from his pocket.  \\\"I've been writing this. I think you ought to see it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To Jon?\\\"  Her whole face had changed, in that instant, becoming almost haggard.\\n\\n\\\"Yes; the murder's out.\\\"\\n\\nHe gave it to her, and walked away among the roses.  Presently, seeing that she had finished reading and was standing quite still with the sheets of the letter against her skirt, he came back to her.\\n\\n\\\"Well?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's wonderfully put.  I don't see how it could be put better. Thank you, dear.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is there anything you would like left out?\\\"\\n\\nShe shook her head.\\n\\n\\\"No; he must know all, if he's to understand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's what I thought, but--I hate it!\\\"\\n\\nHe had the feeling that he hated it more than she--to him sex was so much easier to mention between man and woman than between man and man; and she had always been more natural and frank, not deeply secretive like his Forsyte self.\\n\\n\\\"I wonder if he will understand, even now, Jolyon?  He's so young; and he shrinks from the physical.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He gets that shrinking from my father, he was as fastidious as a girl in all such matters.  Would it be better to rewrite the whole thing, and just say you hated Soames?\\\"\\n\\nIrene shook her head.\\n\\n\\\"Hate's only a word.  It conveys nothing.  No, better as it is.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well.  It shall go to-morrow.\\\"\\n\\nShe raised her face to his, and in sight of the big house's many creepered windows, he kissed her.\\n\\nII\\n\\nCONFESSION\\n\\nLate that same afternoon, Jolyon had a nap in the old armchair. Face down on his knee was La Rotisserie de la Refine Pedauque, and just before he fell asleep he had been thinking: 'As a people shall we ever really like the French?  Will they ever really like us!'  He himself had always liked the French, feeling at home with their wit, their taste, their cooking.  Irene and he had paid many visits to France before the War, when Jon had been at his private school.  His romance with her had begun in Paris--his last and most enduring romance.  But the French--no Englishman could like them who could not see them in some sort with the detached aesthetic eye!  And with that melancholy conclusion he had nodded off.\\n\\nWhen he woke he saw Jon standing between him and the window.  The boy had evidently come in from the garden and was waiting for him to wake.  Jolyon smiled, still half asleep.  How nice the chap looked-- sensitive, affectionate, straight!  Then his heart gave a nasty jump; and a quaking sensation overcame him.  Jon!  That confession!  He controlled himself with an effort.  \\\"Why, Jon, where did you spring from?\\\"\\n\\nJon bent over and kissed his forehead.\\n\\nOnly then he noticed the look on the boy's face.\\n\\n\\\"I came home to tell you something, Dad.\\\"\\n\\nWith all his might Jolyon tried to get the better of the jumping, gurgling sensations within his chest.\\n\\n\\\"Well, sit down, old man.  Have you seen your mother?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.\\\"  The boy's flushed look gave place to pallor; he sat down on the arm of the old chair, as, in old days, Jolyon himself used to sit beside his own father, installed in its recesses.  Right up to the time of the rupture in their relations he had been wont to perch there--had he now reached such a moment with his own son?  All his life he had hated scenes like poison, avoided rows, gone on his own way quietly and let others go on theirs.  But now--it seemed--at the very end of things, he had a scene before him more painful than any he had avoided.  He drew a visor down over his emotion, and waited for his son to speak.\\n\\n\\\"Father,\\\" said Jon slowly, \\\"Fleur and I are engaged.\\\"\\n\\n'Exactly!' thought Jolyon, breathing with difficulty.\\n\\n\\\"I know that you and Mother don't like the idea.  Fleur says that Mother was engaged to her father before you married her.  Of course I don't know what happened, but it must be ages ago.  I'm devoted to her, Dad, and she says she is to me.\\\"\\n\\nJolyon uttered a queer sound, half laugh, half groan.\\n\\n\\\"You are nineteen, Jon, and I am seventy-two.  How are we to understand each other in a matter like this, eh?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You love Mother, Dad; you must know what we feel.  It isn't fair to us to let old things spoil our happiness, is it?\\\"\\n\\nBrought face to face with his confession, Jolyon resolved to do without it if by any means he could.  He laid his hand on the boy's arm.\\n\\n\\\"Look, Jon! I might put you off with talk about your both being too young and not knowing your own minds, and all that, but you wouldn't listen, besides, it doesn't meet the case--Youth, unfortunately, cures itself.  You talk lightly about 'old things like that,' knowing nothing--as you say truly--of what happened.  Now, have I ever given you reason to doubt my love for you, or my word?\\\"\\n\\nAt a less anxious moment he might have been amused by the conflict his words aroused--the boy's eager clasp, to reassure him on these points, the dread on his face of what that reassurance would bring forth; but he could only feel grateful for the squeeze.\\n\\n\\\"Very well, you can believe what I tell you.  If you don't give up this love affair, you will make Mother wretched to the end of her days.  Believe me, my dear, the past, whatever it was, can't be buried--it can't indeed.\\\"\\n\\nJon got off the arm of the chair.\\n\\n'The girl'--thought Jolyon--'there she goes--starting up before him-- life itself--eager, pretty, loving!'\\n\\n\\\"I can't, Father; how can I--just because you say that?  Of course, I can't!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Jon, if you knew the story you would give this up without hesitation; you would have to!  Can't you believe me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How can you tell what I should think?  Father, I love her better than anything in the world.\\\"\\n\\nJolyon's face twitched, and he said with painful slowness:\\n\\n\\\"Better than your mother, Jon?\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1639990444,\"title\":\"The thing began to go to pieces with bicycles and motor-cars; the War has finished it\"},\"digest\":\"1EJjRw-Q7-c4fSFZ_Bo7naUhXxIsViplAxdTg41bEg8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xeCFFC09a569272AB1413A3E9E440BC486ddb0a97\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"d35IJagIGZirvYtGysyv6atK6uIeAHv6qjD15IwqOi8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Z32fNSLDUcf8s00h9xur7mKDVcPTJVy5s8hj52fFb6E\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"G2XJH2oyfOddD_PXAUr7bNYMhJIVQJ4dcnGiTgZu5pfBJbADFfizyU-fUs28bUTkllZoKm1U32fTxqif4Y6peg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0fe88d15cc5f0af006c4a672fc65173c1ff7bd1de0934b2dd121a5d2fe4e352c61626f3b5613e21c879fbe51fe8302e30c0346b19acae727da73f4a0fe4174881c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"d35IJagIGZirvYtGysyv6atK6uIeAHv6qjD15IwqOi8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Z32fNSLDUcf8s00h9xur7mKDVcPTJVy5s8hj52fFb6E\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"1EJjRw-Q7-c4fSFZ_Bo7naUhXxIsViplAxdTg41bEg8\"}"
