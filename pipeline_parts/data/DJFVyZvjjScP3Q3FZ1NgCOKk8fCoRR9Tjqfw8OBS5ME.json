"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"# Welcome to the the future of the fashion industry.\\n\\n**From the ashes they will rise, from the dust they will create, and from the dirt they will form beauty. — KALAU**\\n\\n![FUTR E\\\\*SHCK Alterrage Fashion Film : WORLD 1 by NGHTWLK](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oYnglEFqZy8PDr9ZBKrLQ.png?height=762&width=1400)\\n\\nThe birth of [Alterrage](https://linktr.ee/alterrageofficial) was conceived as a reaction to the current “status quo” of the fashion industry. Since the age of 10, I aspired to the likes of Alexander McQueen (so overused), Hussein Chalayan (the table dress), and **Rick Owens** (the god of 90s goth); to gain access to a private and elite crowd that I believed would also bring me **the same design stardom as my idols**.\\n\\nAfter paying my “fashion dues” after **12 unpaid internships**, **3 different countries of residence** (NYC, London, France), and **hours of blood** (from those damn pins and needles), **sweat**, and **tears**, I finally had reached mecca : **Paris, France**. The studio marbled halls were breathtaking, the fabrics exquisite, and the sample sales made my heart ache with lust. But *only* upon reaching my “final” destination, did I have my realisation.\\n\\n**Is this it?**\\n\\nAfter all the residual glitter dusted the floor, I felt empty. There was **no collaboration**, **no empathy**, **no true creativity** in the work I was doing. After working in the top luxury houses in Paris, I didn’t feel like I was getting any closer to finding where I belonged.\\n\\nI’ve always loved the underdog character in films. But it didn’t prepare me for what came next.\\n\\nFrom what seemed to be from a science fiction film, in 2019 Covid came and shut the whole world down. I lost my luxurious role in my tall tower and reinvented myself as a freelance accessories designer. But something had changed while everyone was inside **baking bread** and **stocking up on the last rolls of toilet paper**. *I began listening to myself instead, of following and watching everyone else around me*.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KozasfhAmuB-UN4U_xDJz.png?height=298&width=1400)\\n\\nIn early 2020, I came across a conference hosted by [Anina.net](https://shor.by/anina) , which brought together a myriad of digital and fashion creatives in blockchain, virtual avatar dressing, and 3D fit. This discovery of digital fashion was the **spark that lit the flame** for **[Alterrage](https://www.alterrage.com/)**, a **PHYGITAL** fashion label founded on circular principles, eco-activism, collaboration, and imagination.\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tH6T8A5L8U&feature=emb_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tH6T8A5L8U&feature=emb_logo)\\n\\n> *With Alterrage I have rediscovered my passion for creation and leading an industry-wide revolution. **It is time to tear down these walls that constrain us and train us to continue with the status quo, a broken construct that those in power have created to keep division from the ones at the “top” from those “beneath” them.***\\n\\nI am so excited to share what I have been building for the past year and a half with you, and grow Alterrage from a single designer’s vision to a *mission-driven collective* **affinity**. I am just one designer, and I know together that we can be so much more. We can create the industry and a future that **WE WANT TO LIVE AND WORK IN.**\\n\\nSee our links below and more exciting news coming soon.\\n\\n\\\\*DISCORD NOW OPEN FOR ACCESS\\\\* : \\n <https://discord.gg/bpCH7bDEQB> \\n — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — \\n Website: <https://www.alterrage.com/> \\n — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — \\n Clubhouse: <https://www.clubhouse.com/club/the-future-of-phygital> \\n — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — \\n Twitter: <https://twitter.com/alterragelabel> \\n — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — \\n Instagram: <https://www.instagram.com/alterrageofficial/> \\n — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — \\n LinkedIn: <https://www.linkedin.com/company/alterrage/> \\n — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — -\\n\\n> *Who the f\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* is [KALAU](https://linktr.ee/kalau.url)?*\\n>\\n> *American fashion designer and entrepreneur with a specialisation in circular and digital fashion, in Paris, London, and New York.
