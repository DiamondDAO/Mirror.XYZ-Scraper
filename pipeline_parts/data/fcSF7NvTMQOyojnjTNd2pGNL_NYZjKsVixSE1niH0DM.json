"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"After several months of [re-publishing (pre-publishing?) leaked Mars Spectrum transmissions from the latter half of this century](https://www.marsspectrum.com), my source informs me the project receiving these missives has been shut down.\\n\\n![A reconstruction of the first Mars Spectrum transmission, which seems to be the debut edition of a future publication from the Red Planet.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cead5bb6-d81a-4629-9710-d19b01cd5e6c.JPG?height=1060&width=1174)\\n\\nFortunately, we are now collaborating on a new experiment to re-establish communications via a theoretical [Rajan-Visser quantum networked blockchain](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05979), which, as Rajan and Visser wrote in 2018, “could be viewed as a quantum-networked time machine.”\\n\\nWe believe Mirror’s platform is the best currently available option for possible future integration into such a next-generation network. The Mars Mirror is the new, forward-facing home of this effort, allowing this important initiative to finally emerge from the shadows.\\n\\nThis is where we will also be using Mirror’s tools to help build a community around tackling this urgent project.\\n\\nLook for more details to follow very soon as we continue to develop our model for community engagement.\\n\\nIn the meantime, to support this important effort we have minted an NFT that is representative of this historic post, including the original artwork at the top [created by paper.prankster](https://www.instagram.com/paper.prankster/). Check back soon for your chance to participate in the auction of this unique collectible and support a landmark effort to build a better future on two worlds.\",\"timestamp\":1630087447,\"title\":\"News From Mars Via a Quantum Networked Time Machine\",\"publication\":\"mars\"},\"digest\":\"tcXR9Svt_n38FLc1eeBAK7O6nrzAHOXh9lInKWFVias\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x15F44e08d75277915Fe09d90490511E75df9B70A\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"szCyRUqxnrFv7DRcJnGx-epxvN5sKIruBiTwc5MpZPs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eUkDX_Cqi40z6095Lgy8pEAbcN2ZDe125kNXwbdQ1T4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"MG-JrgDxoQXECZCwXTOq_XjFndvF4CdoswRaR-deq-MIzFvqjBwKkcp6r2bFOY6xuO2izW-rl-FHB19VvhGohA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4e5bb7a03fd5d434e3ca041826f1ca17c28005cf4f7e34261acd1983243a242b7ce38f788f30c2f3c58dc3aca9a2082019df8eaf92f00b8ef591b0aa2c1f4cd11b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on mars.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"szCyRUqxnrFv7DRcJnGx-epxvN5sKIruBiTwc5MpZPs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eUkDX_Cqi40z6095Lgy8pEAbcN2ZDe125kNXwbdQ1T4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"tcXR9Svt_n38FLc1eeBAK7O6nrzAHOXh9lInKWFVias\"}"
