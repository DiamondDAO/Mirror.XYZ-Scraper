"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Ravel’s life was in the main uneventful. He never married, and, though he enjoyed the society of a few chosen friends, he lived the life of a semirecluse at his country retreat at Montfort-L’Amaury, in the forest of Rambouillet, near [Paris](https://www.britannica.com/place/Paris). He served in [World War I](https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-I) for a short time as a truck driver at the front, but the strain was too great for his fragile constitution, and he was discharged from the army in 1917.\\n\\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.[Subscribe Now](https://premium.britannica.com/premium-membership/?utm_source=inline&utm_medium=mendel&utm_campaign=evergreen)\\n\\nIn 1928 Ravel embarked on a four months’ tour of Canada and the United States and in the same year visited England to receive an honorary degree of doctor of music from Oxford. That year also saw the creation of *Boléro* in its original form as a ballet, with [Ida Rubinstein](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ida-Rubinstein) in the principal role.\\n\\nThe last five years of Ravel’s life were clouded by [aphasia](https://www.britannica.com/science/aphasia-pathology), which not only prevented him from writing another note of music but also deprived him of the power of speech and made it impossible for him even to sign his name. Perhaps the real tragedy of his condition was that his musical imagination remained as active as ever. An operation to relieve the obstruction of a [blood vessel](https://www.britannica.com/science/blood-vessel) that supplies the brain was unsuccessful. Ravel was buried in the cemetery of Levallois, a Paris suburb in which he had lived, in the presence of Stravinsky and other distinguished musicians and composers.\\n\\nFor Ravel, music was a kind of ritual, having its own laws, to be conducted behind high walls, sealed off from the outside world, and impenetrable to unauthorized intruders. When his Russian contemporary [Igor Stravinsky](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Igor-Stravinsky) compared Ravel to “the most perfect of Swiss watchmakers,” he was in fact extolling those qualities of intricacy and precision to which he himself attached so much importance.\",\"timestamp\":1637008144,\"title\":\"Let's know about Ravel - Part 2\"},\"digest\":\"PV4GfJrobmUkIbhTO1eDgOKHBVJcicm2fInEExlHsoc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x13BdD13534Dcec07a2E7B862a126D2F09D04A094\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Z8zUrBEdficZiD7UpANEHBsWmdviLCvLTsFvUJ6FUO8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KADdZY4m4M1xJKrjp_UI_AkF6xVLnOI7OIPTZ5rnQ0A\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Jndm8ugzFKR9uidDwI7Fqv-GFY2kTpP9kEJzfMOeW0uyLmKg1SLq-WJoC2EGyeRQ7XBzxk08DDse71Lwp7mj3Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5aa98da35445da9f533b413c2e62231af1eb2e997d9abb2cb9878b8b66e7c06f1b113bb4371b03454d55601c47aa6fb58138b2a7fdc92a867dcf3efdb745735f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Z8zUrBEdficZiD7UpANEHBsWmdviLCvLTsFvUJ6FUO8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KADdZY4m4M1xJKrjp_UI_AkF6xVLnOI7OIPTZ5rnQ0A\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"PV4GfJrobmUkIbhTO1eDgOKHBVJcicm2fInEExlHsoc\"}"
