"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"![Stage at NFT BZL conference in Miami](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*DtKotaCKbNrVAcRFlsgzAg.png)\\n\\nI’ve been having the time of my life learning about crypto currencies (last five years) / NFTs (last three months) and thought to share some of the cool, fun, educational conversations and experiences I’ve been having lately.\\n\\n**My Alice in Wonderland Moment** (*Trust me, crypto is coming to something you like soon too…)*\\n\\nTwo months ago, I received an email on my phone from [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/en-us/) (an exchange to buy crypto) that Deadmaus is playing in [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) (a metaverse) right now. I log in via my laptop to check it out. There are many other avatars (people) there too. “That’s cool” I say, even though I close my computer one minute later. Several hours later I go to do something else online and discover that I’m still in Decentraland. Deadmaus is long gone, and I decide to walk until I find something interesting. 20 seconds later I come to a Burning Man style tent that has five pieces of art on its “walls.” I check out each piece and click through to [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) (NFT marketplace), where I see the provenance of the pieces, whether they are for sale, and if so, how much.\\n\\nIn five minutes TOTAL, this example ties together cryptocurrency, music, the metaverse, art, and free market capitalism. I love all these things, save maybe the metaverse in its current incarnation. This is just ONE example of the interesting tie-ins that I discover *on a daily basis*. The rabbit holes are many. A few are listed below. Enjoy!\\n\\n**My NFT Vignettes**\\n\\nI spoke to someone at [GigLabs](https://www.giglabs.io/) at a Bitcoin conference. They help corporations with their NFT strategy/roadmap, including helping them set up a [Discord](https://discord.com/) server. He said a lot of people and corporations will enter crypto via NFTs. They are essentially skipping over crypto and/or will come at crypto backwards. We are seeing that right now.\\n\\nDiscord as alien spaceship — I tell people that experiencing a Discord server is like landing in an alien spaceship and not knowing what button to push. I probably know how to push about 20% of the buttons at this point. It’s hyper. Brands are interacting with their communities in real time. Global communities with niche interests form in weeks.\\n\\n![Scammed out of $1,000 trying to buy this bunny](https://miro.medium.com/max/612/1\\\\*fF_5mN1SB2pE771khpVxKg.jpeg)\\n\\nScammed! I lost over $1000 trying to buy an NFT two months ago. I’ve spent hundreds (ok, thousands) of dollars on gas fees learning how blockchains work. I look at these costs as tuition. And, you know what, I’ve actually come out ahead financially.\\n\\n[Meta4 Capital](https://www.meta4.capital/) — This is an investment fund backed by Andreesen Horowitz. They are looking to create a Smithsonian level collection of NFTs — describing themselves as archaeologists “digging” to find the rarest, oldest, and most unique specimens. I believe them.\\n\\nPepsi NFT — I “minted” a free [Pepsi Mic Drop NFT](https://micdrop.pepsi.com/) on Dec 14. Also on Dec 14, I sold it for almost $4000 on [Open Sea](https://opensea.io/collection/pepsi-mic-drop). Chump change in NFT land.\\n\\n![Pepsi's Ad Dollars at Work! Sold for $4000. Cost = $0](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\\\*4ADXifpd9bhK3PHN7_iICQ.png)\\n\\n“Greg, there is no \\\\[investment\\\\] alpha in Cam Harvey’s book on [DeFi, The Future of Finance](https://www.amazon.com/DeFi-Future-Finance-Campbell-Harvey/dp/1119836018/ref=asc_df_1119836018/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=509245866633&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=6168737360651021373&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=21137&hvtargid=pla-1298558441725&psc=1). The \\\\[investment\\\\] alpha is coming from 20-year-olds spending all day on Reddit/Discord and that have time to read all the White Papers.” If only I were 20 yrs old? I hear ya, but Cam Harvey’s book is still awesome!\\n\\nIn game assets — VCs are no longer just investing in companies and tokens, they are investing in in-game / in the metaverse assets. Anyone want to chip in for a $100k space [Battleship](https://medium.com/star-atlas/shipmas-9-new-star-atlas-spaceships-f24afc7956b1) in [Star Atlas](https://staratlas.com/)? There are only 90 of them available . . .\\n\\n![This spaceship only costs $30000 in Star Atlas](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\\\*XqIK2-Nfqy8VqyDuo_k7Bw.jpeg)\\n\\n[AMC Theaters / Spiderman NFT](https://www.amctheatres.com/giveaway/spider-man-nft) — They just drove millions in revenue by offering 86,000 NFTs to any premier member (starts at $15/yr) that buys a $15–20 ticket to see Spiderman on its opening night. And they just engaged their customers in a cool way.\\n\\nThe Matrix — Dropped 100,000 Avatars two weeks ago via a platform called [Nifty’s.](https://niftys.com/) $50each. It was a disaster. My best friend from high school and I are eagerly waiting to decide whether our Avatars will take the red pill or the blue pill. In the meantime, . . . Millions of dollars in revenue for Universal. Matrix fan engagement. Connecting with a best friend. $350 from selling two of my five avatars. And . . . I’ll spare you the details of “aping” into Nifty’s Looney Toon collection.\\n\\nBitcoin conference, end of conversation with very interesting crypto guy — Me: “Do you have a business card?” Crypto guy: “I don’t.” Me: “Find you on LinkedIn?” Crypto guy: “You can, but it’s best to find me on Telegram.” I’m now proud to say I know how to use about 20% of Telegram . . .\\n\\nFinding your community concept — Tickets as NFTs. In the future, your ticket stub will no longer be thrown out, stored in a drawer, or digital trash. There will be a record of which games/concerts you went to. To the extent other share their event history, you’ll be able to find people that went to the same event or like the same team/band. You can easily find your tribe. Wait, you saw [Greensky Bluegrass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm27FHBAuRs) at Telluride too?! (You don’t really need to click that link, but it is a great song.)\\n\\nScene: Opening night invite-only party during Miami Art Basel (Note: I was over this shit 10 yrs ago, but oh oh oh, I did so looooove it for a time). Aside from the music being over 100 decibels according to my NIOSH app, there were NFT collectors and artists meeting for the first time and some killer art. I loved it, minus the hearing loss. One artist does NFT work for a non-profit. My ears perked up, as I’m on the board of a non-profit ([Free Forest School](https://www.freeforestschool.org/)). She told me that Free Forest School could have a presence in the metaverse — say a really cool digital forest where the kids could do/learn XYZ. Huh? / Maybe . . .?\\n\\n*I’m laaaaate!* This is how I’ve been feeling, but it’s wrong wrong wrong. I attended the [NFT BZL](https://nftbzl.com/) conference two weeks ago, which is what this screed was supposed to be about originally. Look out for a part 2 email. It will be something titled along the lines of *“Really Cool Notes from the NFT BZL conference.”* The conference took place in the FTX Arena. You know, where the Miami Heat play. There were “experts” on stage that have only been involved in the space since March. It’s only the very beginning.\\n\\nMost of the vignettes above are from playing around 1–2 hours per day for the last \\\\~3 months. It’s been fun, and I’ve enjoyed discovering new ways that communities are being fostered, the game/present/trading card-like elements, the social signaling, multiple ways of engaging with the arts, rewarding creators, IRL “utility,” financial reward (. . . and potential ruin), etc.\\n\\nJoin me during the first inning and/or please let me know about some more cool stuff to check out!\\n\\n![My friend won this Boss Beauty at the NFT BZL Conference that we attended together. Very cool project about empowering women. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KUQARjwCOTotnhqUPw4Xi.png?height=600&width=600)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1642346876,\"title\":\"NFT Musings (Scams, Spaceships, Art, $$$)\"},\"digest\":\"AfIt03Fer_VGDXOFK-hWB1M6bwSQjsjhpoxsEyvVGMU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4184F399B416f5D2ae4FcD9A842253a9896e73cC\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Y3k8uxTG1VHJkrCXovXrAPhJQPbVz8LL-lnJhwfnL2Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JuItaU5XtZsjLDmquRLFqHf4Eah_59IS0Mv5MPGZ8IY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"DzlZEM-Wlbpsf4FNNnTnsgeWwdhwT2dEN_gIVbFgT7bfWuVAc2_YoLi8iOR8nxE4_FYGm9xA5gdKAEpWBa3mLg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa7e6d3d5c3f3f59bb283b761504acbfe2255dedf0a7715be714bbd1916bd2db50d13fca8c832e129f871dcdfa6236408b02fceb3ccee3c6bcb8184fe403c53611c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Y3k8uxTG1VHJkrCXovXrAPhJQPbVz8LL-lnJhwfnL2Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JuItaU5XtZsjLDmquRLFqHf4Eah_59IS0Mv5MPGZ8IY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Lr_t9fIlLmdl7EP2jRp3Z8-TBwmYXkfNo2QxbiKHqxM\"}"
