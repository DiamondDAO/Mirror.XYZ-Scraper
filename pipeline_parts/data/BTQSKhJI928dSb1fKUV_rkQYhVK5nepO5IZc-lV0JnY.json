"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"A long time ago, when I was telling others about Bitcoin , I talked about it for an hour, and then they came over, what's the use of Bitcoin? embarrassment!\\n\\nIncluding Bitcoin, all kinds of coins have been useless. Almost all people who buy coins expect to sell them at a higher price one day. The only logic for price increases is Ponzi, more people and more people. More money to pick up the plate.\\n\\nAlthough I would talk a lot about Bitcoin's payment function, store of value, unfrozen wealth... and the like, but they all seemed reluctant.\\n\\nSince I started using Bitcoin, the real function was to buy other coins, especially ICOs, and I was so angry that I lost everything. For other payments, spending money to buy something online can basically be characterized as performance art, and it is actually better to use Alipay and the like.\\n\\nThe biggest applications of Bitcoin back then were satoshiDice and 3M . The former was a shameless game compared to the size of the game, and the latter was the abominable CX.\\n\\nIncluding in 2016 and 2017 , when Ethereum 's smart contracts were used on a large scale, the main purpose was to issue coins, and everyone still wanted to earn more coins.\\n\\nIn 2017 he appeared on a number of Ethernet Square Dapp , encrypted cats and F O3D as the representative, or simply take money games class games.\\n\\nThe first stage economic model developed in the blockchain universe is Ponzi.\\n\\nThe Ponzi I am talking about here is neutral and does not carry a derogatory meaning.\\n\\nAt the beginning of 2020 , I was blocked by the epidemic at home, and I did my best to study DeFi . This is incredible. I realized that the economic model of the blockchain universe has developed to a positive cash flow, and coins are really useful.\\n\\nBuffett said that Bitcoin is mouse shit, saying that it does not generate any cash flow. It's a pity that the old man's fame is not guaranteed in the late festival. Buffett, who refuses to learn DeFi , is not a good value investor.\\n\\nIn the real universe, finance, central banks, commercial banks, investment banks, stock exchanges, insurance, etc., must be useful, definitely valuable, and there must be positive cash flow.\\n\\nWell, in the blockchain universe, these are all there. M akerDao is to go to the center of the central bank, c ompound is to go to the center of the commercial bank, great uncle is decentralized to the investment bank, U niswap is decentralized to exchange ...... the insurance money ring also did a poor job.\\n\\nIn traditional finance, it is natural for money to make money, and people who don't use money to make money are considered stupid.\\n\\nWith DEFi coins, generating coins has become a matter of course, and holding coins no longer needs to rely solely on Ponzi to gain value as before. Now there are enough investment opportunities on the chain to allow coins to generate coins.\\n\\nWith the help of the economic model of the DeFi blockchain universe, it has developed to the second stage, and the currency has become an asset with cash flow.\\n\\nEthereum has made great contributions.\\n\\nNow the hot concepts of NFT, meta universe, and G ameFi have once again pushed the economic model of the blockchain universe to the third stage, giving birth to consumption.\\n\\nWhen I expressed my love for virtual assets, my dad always said, \\\"You can eat rice, wear clothes, and sit on chairs. What's the use of your shit money?\\\"\\n\\nAn industry must have an output that can be consumed. This seems to be a serious industry.\\n\\nOpensea trading NFT is already clear consumer behavior, like someone just to buy a c CryptoAPI the p- UNK , those strange paintings that are collections of people. Although most NFTs are for hype, a single spark can start a prairie fire.\\n\\nG ameFi rise of consumer behavior contributed significantly to the block chain of the universe, the purpose although many people buy NFT strange play AXS is P Lay to Earn , but there are still a lot of people really come in to play games buy NFT play the game.\\n\\nI downloaded a lot of games in G ameFi to play. I am not a game lover. I bit my head and played AXS all afternoon. Damn, I really canâ€™t understand why some people love to play this stuff. I played a few games of THG, and this thing has evolved a lot at once, just like the King of Glory. When I checked the THG data last week, the official website showed 2 million game users.\\n\\nS andbox buys land for Metaverse . Many big companies seem to buy land for advertising. Is this investment or consumption? On the ( -21 , -12 ) plot of S andbox is the Planck (P lancker ) Logo, haha.\\n\\nWith the support of NFT \\\\\\\\ G ameFi and Metaverse , the economic model of the blockchain universe has evolved into a consumer market. Congratulations for changing the world.\\n\\nThe consumer market in the blockchain universe will definitely be very large, at least to cut a big piece of the current traditional game market and entertainment market. We will wait and see.\",\"timestamp\":1639536444,\"title\":\"An article to understand the three stages of blockchain economic model development\"},\"digest\":\"WHSm6lpf6M_ahqFdZ7z14wLI1iW017753eQ4bALc5Jk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa37EBdFE568B827019Acb772C61BCc4EE8871E0c\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"a6pUN_QFWk_kenq5iOCQyC1yw84n-uUKbwaoaBI4X9Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"-cBZpQ1xEDBim0v1QTehQ71s4UG8zQVMAzRRMP4ybTs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ODBRyPLqGSnBe4jjnDyqVsc5JBMPHzxcrg0b8DoPlxJlGk_KwlD2wKqfxYbgHxqRqdqj0fCDZmVqjcIx4bQoCg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x33528a8ebd1bc09aa0766d2d47f976e5c6462ba7ea5ede31f4d412fdf606fcd46405e63f1a962567e29f71670919b86411cc2bc60cc36efd2386fa1d7019fb7c1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"a6pUN_QFWk_kenq5iOCQyC1yw84n-uUKbwaoaBI4X9Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"-cBZpQ1xEDBim0v1QTehQ71s4UG8zQVMAzRRMP4ybTs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"WHSm6lpf6M_ahqFdZ7z14wLI1iW017753eQ4bALc5Jk\"}"
