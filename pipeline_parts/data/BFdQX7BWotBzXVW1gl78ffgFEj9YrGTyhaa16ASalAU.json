"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"She had talked volubly, more than a little terrified at Merlin's scowls, and the attitude of Citizen Tinville, who was known to be very severe if anyone committed any blunders.\\n\\nBut the Citizeness--her name was Brogard and her husband's brother kept an inn in the neighbourhood of Calais--the Citizeness Brogard had a clear conscience. She held a license from the Committee of Public Safety for letting apartments, and she had always given due notice to the Committee of the arrival and departure of her lodgers. The only thing was that if any lodger paid her more than ordinarily well for the accommodation and he so desired it, she would send in the notice conveniently late, and conveniently vaguely worded as to the description, status and nationality of her more liberal patrons.\\n\\nThis had occurred in the case of her recent English visitor.\\n\\nBut she did not explain it quite like that to Citizen Foucquier Tinville or to Citizen Merlin.\\n\\nHowever, she was rather frightened, and produced the scrap of paper which the Englishman had left with her, together with the assurance that when she showed it there would be no further trouble.\\n\\nTinville took it roughly out of her hand, but would not glance at it. He crushed it into a ball and then Merlin snatched it from him with a coarse laugh, smoothed out the creases on his knee and studied it for a moment.\\n\\nThere were two lines of what looked like poetry, written in a language which Merlin did not understand. English, no doubt.\\n\\nBut what was perfectly clear, and easily comprehended by any one, was the little drawing in the corner, done in red ink and representing a small star-shaped flower.\\n\\nThen Tinville and Merlin both cursed loudly and volubly, and bidding their men follow them, turned away from the house in the Rue de l'Ancienne Comedie and left its toothless landlady on her own doorstep still volubly protesting her patriotism and her desire to serve the government of the Republic.\\n\\nTinville and Merlin, however, took the scrap of paper to Citizen Robespierre, who smiled grimly as he in his turn crushed the offensive little document in the palm of his well-washed hands.\\n\\nRobespierre did not swear. He never wasted either words or oaths, but he slipped the bit of paper inside the double lid of his silver snuff box and then he sent a special messenger to Citizen Chauvelin in the Rue Corneille, bidding him come that same evening after ten o'clock to room No. 16 in the ci-devant Palace of the Tuileries.\\n\\nIt was now half-past ten, and Chauvelin and Robespierre sat opposite one another in the ex-boudoir of Queen Marie Antoinette, and between them on the table, just below the tallow-candle, was a much creased, exceedingly grimy bit of paper.\\n\\nIt had passed through several unclean hands before Citizen Robespierre's immaculately white fingers had smoothed it out and placed it before the eyes of ex-Ambassador Chauvelin.\\n\\nThe latter, however, was not looking at the paper, he was not even looking at the pale, cruel face before him. He had closed his eyes and for a moment had lost sight of the small dark room, of Robespierre's ruthless gaze, of the mud-stained walls and greasy floor. He was seeing, as in a bright and sudden vision, the brilliantly-lighted salons of the Foreign Office in London, with beautiful Marguerite Blakeney gliding queenlike on the arm of the Prince of Wales.\\n\\nHe heard the flutter of many fans, the frou-frou of silk dresses, and above all the din and sound of dance music, he heard an inane laugh and an affected voice repeating the doggerel rhyme that was even now written on that dirty piece of paper which Robespierre had placed before him:\\n\\n\\\"We seek him here, and we seek him there, Those Frenchies seek him everywhere! Is he in heaven, is he in hell, That demmed elusive Pimpernel?\\\"\\n\\nIt was a mere flash! One of memory's swiftly effaced pictures, when she shows us for the fraction of a second, indelible pictures from out our past. Chauvelin, in that same second, while his own eyes were closed and Robespierre's fixed upon him, also saw the lonely cliffs of Calais, heard the same voice singing: \\\"God save the King!\\\" the volley of musketry, the despairing cries of Marguerite Blakeney; and once again he felt the keen and bitter pang of complete humiliation and defeat.\",\"timestamp\":1636532174,\"title\":\"She had talked volubly\"},\"digest\":\"JIAgsPZBZTyofsMLSfsSumXZqsbW-y_OCQf2tPkhwMg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xb58Fb3bc38b2ACb99CcfBc6A4e3223f798F927DE\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JuGy4Uh6GlvW-RLUBKftDN9Skeps30sBqLrkE2EyI0Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"M0OcZAIUCIQkH8xE0PTHTeEAnmxtEIpKKhgxhGY8B_A\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Uu_dSrNK4hUgSp4U5BBVHkGq4D6AjkQIya9eKWzt9qWcs6wMzvw6s97KXf8phlQEbL7Lfi5NwrJseAKUuYXDOQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9214f3729524f94e2062f5790faa8a88affb02b5555289c1d85d10ba9215c49f0f1bc19745328a9bc96df3b4e76dd730606799ba743dfa63473ee4b9af5789281c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JuGy4Uh6GlvW-RLUBKftDN9Skeps30sBqLrkE2EyI0Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"M0OcZAIUCIQkH8xE0PTHTeEAnmxtEIpKKhgxhGY8B_A\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"JIAgsPZBZTyofsMLSfsSumXZqsbW-y_OCQf2tPkhwMg\"}"
