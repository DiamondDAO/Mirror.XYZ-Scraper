"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"```\\nBetween deliberate falsehood and small arrangements with reality which aim to safeguard the human bond, the palette is wide. When an industrialist cheats on anti-pollution standards, the scandal is of a different ethical - and legal - significance than hiding his margin from his customer. What do philosophers think?\\n```\\n\\n### Imagine \\n\\nas soon as you know about departures or promotions, you announce them to your team; both externally and internally, you say everything about the financial health of your company; you reveal to your customers the margin you are making ... With such principles, the business would not last long! Is lying structural in the business world? And if so, what lie are we talking about? There are the big scandals linked to lies - like the Dieselgate, where Volkswagen underestimated its polluting emissions - and the small daily arrangements with reality: \\\"my bus was late\\\", \\\"I no longer had a network\\\" ... What is a real lie? Are we facing an erosion of truth in business? What about it from a moral point of view? And can we rank the lies according to their seriousness?\\n\\n### The real construction of myths \\n\\nAt first glance, the lie has everything to displease the lover of truth that is the philosopher. Denouncing rhetoric, Socrates defends a use of discourse that seeks truth in all circumstances. Words must be used to describe and understand reality, and not to persuade crowds by disguising the truth, as the Sophists do in his time ... and communicators today.\\n\\n> “An advertisement does not describe all of reality. However, is it a lie? ”\\n\\nBut for there to be a lie, there must be truth. Aristotle defines truth as the correspondence between a statement and a fact. If the error is to say the false without knowing the truth, the lie presupposes that one knows the real fact. But can we so easily define what is true and what is false? When you create a commercial, you know that customers don't necessarily want to know the truth or be given an exhaustive description of the product, which would be unnecessary or boring, but that they expect an effective… and compelling message. An advertisement does not describe all of reality. Is it for all that false?\\n\\nWhen a company cares about its communication, it is telling a fiction. On the website of a brand with a strong identity (luxury, sport, beauty, etc.), the \\\"history\\\" section does not tell everything that has happened since the creation of the brand, but what inspires dreams. Agencies specializing in *storytelling* build a flattering “brand image”. Language is therefore not only used to tell the truth, it is also used to make people dream, to convince, to build an (e-) reputation ... or to formulate objectives that have yet to be achieved, values ​​that constitute an ideal to be achieved. aim rather than a state of affairs.\\n\\n### From fake news to characterized lies\\n\\nTruth under conditions, nicely put together stories, multiplication of points of view ... Could the company be the world of post-truth? When reality is so fabricated that we no longer know what is true, the notion of lies risks losing relevance, and relativism triumphing. Since the arrival of Donald Trump, the White House has become a past master in the art of drowning the fish, howling at fake news and brandishing its alternative facts when journalists confront them with verified information. Can the company do the same in front of the press?\\n\\nThere is, however, a difference between fiction and reality. Between joke, irony, error and lies, which the Ancients define with precision. In the fifth century, the moralist Saint Augustine made the intention to lie a determining criterion: \\\"*It is by the intention of the mind and not by the truth or the falsity of things in themselves that judge whether someone is lying or not lying*”. In the case of Volkswagen, the collective disappointment with the revelations about the automaker, for example, arose from the impression that the emissions of particulate matter had been intentionally falsified.\\n\\nBecause the lie poses a threat to the whole being as well as to the business. A company that brazenly lies takes a reputational risk, which can affect in the long term its relations with the State, but also its “employer brand”, its attractiveness on the labor market. The lie \\\"*breaks all our commerce, and dissolves all the links of our police*,\\\" warns Montaigne. Seeing the broken trust between the actors is what liars in society expose themselves to.\\n\\n### The lie, the cement of the company?\\n\\n> “For Thomas Aquinas, lying is inherently wrong, although it is permissible to carefully conceal the truth”\\n\\nBut beyond large-scale fraud, are there tolerable lies? Since ancient times, moralists have torn their hair out on the subject, attempting to identify categories of lies to determine their level of seriousness. In the Middle Ages, Thomas of Aquinas recalls that lying is inherently bad, \\\"*although it is permissible to cautiously conceal the truth*\\\". Theologians will debate endlessly this notion of \\\"lie by omission\\\", and when it is acceptable. In business, the attitude of simply being silent is commonplace. No one is going to give up in the middle of a team lunch: \\\"*Here! you knew Ms. Cheffe is leaving in three weeks, that's why she's not doing anything anymore; it must be said that she was paid 20% less than Mr. Chef who, by the way, is paid 4.5 times more than you. Everyone spontaneously applies the saying that \\\"not all truth is good to speak*\\\". The lie would cement the business and preserve human relationships.\\n\\nHowever, one thing is to stay on good terms with your collaborators and clients, another is to lie to harm someone: to denigrate the work of a colleague to obtain a promotion, for example, or to fail to denounce actions dangerous to society. Sometimes you have to know how to raise the alarm. Basically, we all know how to distinguish between politeness, consideration, concern for others - which add fuel to our social machine - and the fact of concealing something in view of our own interest, be it individual or collective. If I disguise reality a little bit so as not to offend my interlocutor, I am courteous. But if I omit or distort certain facts as it suits me, I betray the ideal of truth and undermine mutual trust.\\n\\n### The courage to lie\\n\\nThe special cases remain. What about the pious lie dropped to protect someone, for example? Imagine a malicious boss asks you where your colleague has gone, while the latter has gone to pick up his sick child from the nursery. Do we have to be so sincere as to denounce someone? Should we - this is the classic example - tell an attacker who asks him where his victim is? If one readily condemns lying when it is malicious, one hesitates, as Saint Augustine notes, when it \\\"serves someone and harms no one.\\\"\\n\\n> \\\"No man has the right to the truth which harms others\\\" Benjamin Constant\\n\\nMore severe, Immanuel Kant recalls in the 8th century that not to lie is a fundamental principle of our ethics, and refutes without mercy this \\\"*alleged right to lie by humanity*\\\". His contemporary Benjamin Constant will criticize the Protestant rigor of the German philosopher, with a pragmatism that speaks to us more today. \\\"*The moral principle that telling the truth is a duty, if taken in an absolute and isolated way, would make any society impossible*\\\" says the liberal writer. The truth cannot be told without conditions: if it impedes privacy or security, for example, it should not be revealed. Lying is preferable to him. A reasonable warning for us contemporaries, confronted with the display of our daily life on social networks. Finally, Kant's abstract reasoning on morality comes up against the difficulty of obeying absolute moral principles in a world plagued by violence and power relations. “Telling the truth,” writes Benjamin Constant, “is a duty only to those who have a right to the truth. But no man has a right to the truth which harms others. This is true for the Nazis who came to arrest Jews or resistance fighters, but also for the inhuman leader whom you know is capable of dismissing a collaborator for having taken care of his sick child.\\n\\n### Be sincere\\n\\nSmall arrangements with reality in no way exempt us from wondering about the lie, especially when it is collective. Rounding off a number to make a presentation more digestible is not the same as rounding off a number when transmitting flight settings on an airplane. Sharpening one's \\\"*good ethical sense*\\\" requires careful attention, of course, to the word - unfulfilled, deceptive, concealed - but also to the situation in which the discourse fits and to the ethical climate. We thus find ourselves confronted with the stake, not moral but ethical, of becoming aware of our responsibility towards others and of the consequences of our actions.\\n\\nWhat is at stake is all the more crucial as we live in an era of media manipulation and fake news. It's up to everyone to decide not to lie all the time, without sinking into moral rigidity or relativism! Moreover, the business world cannot completely ignore the dramatic consequences of the feeling that \\\"*everything is bogus*\\\": beyond lies, the generalization of political correctness and the mania of drowning fish in a harmless newspeak, often practiced in a way unconscious, engender an increasingly noticeable discomfort among employees who complain of loss of meaning and bullshit jobs. At the level of our contemporary societies, Harry G. Frankfurt, author of the visionary On the art of saying bullshit (2005; transl. 10/18, 2006), resolves the dilemma in his own way: \\\"A world of Responsible lies is perhaps safer than a world of irresponsible bullshit, where no one bother to measure their deceptive speaking acts against their consequences. Neither in the purist defense of the truth, nor in an alleged right to lie, the deeply ethical individual seeks in his soul and conscience the right attitude to adopt according to the circumstance. **To be sincere, basically**.\\n\\n`about that :` \\n\\n* Benjamin Constant, Political Writings (1797, Gallimard, 1997)\\n* Emmanuel Kant, Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals (1792; Vrin, 1992)\\n\\n  [https://data.bnf.fr/en/11886006/benjamin_constant/](https://data.bnf.fr/en/11886006/benjamin_constant/)\\n\\n  [https://data.bnf.fr/en/11909393/immanuel_kant/](https://data.bnf.fr/en/11909393/immanuel_kant/)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639102870,\"title\":\"Can you lie at work?\"},\"digest\":\"B6dChU3a3cwsjHCmZ_vAlDFjidLtqKaI0Mb03RPku6g\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x737254A9C2c1143c9417eA7899a31fB477FEE92a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eBxDRrEvQn-fipNefa3F8w2Usu_LyNn7XaRmn41ICZM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"EN9yyuEXNfC1o22ylvrpBvxAgwh7Wrll6liQwic00IA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ePrGokBH8RuNgNo8io0mZBXizEg1tW_Zeq99AT_SVG5FodHj7gKjVbF641f2Gt6CWufmlbMpkD1UqUInW-oGYQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x64da6053e5ee1195deb28db189157d350948cde39b42976df0af509186ac86241d77119a4703bb240db8008f6db4a1c9e72bbd141a549d908c871344040082a91c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eBxDRrEvQn-fipNefa3F8w2Usu_LyNn7XaRmn41ICZM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"EN9yyuEXNfC1o22ylvrpBvxAgwh7Wrll6liQwic00IA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"B6dChU3a3cwsjHCmZ_vAlDFjidLtqKaI0Mb03RPku6g\"}"
