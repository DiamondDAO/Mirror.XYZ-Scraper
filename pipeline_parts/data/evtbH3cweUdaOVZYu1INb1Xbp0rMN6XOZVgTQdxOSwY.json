"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Itâ€™s been about two weeks since our [last update](https://protein.mirror.xyz/iEKJT-ZdPmmz0DubFc4SZVAb8i5ysekvNj-ltArgqeU), and since then weâ€™ve launched custom discord bots, kicked off an our first working groups, created a #tough-questions channel and shared pictures of â€˜exoticâ€™ snacks as we continue our journey to Season 1.\\n\\nIn our last workshop and article we identified 12 key values across *â€˜structure, approach and outcomeâ€™* which the community are using as a WIP guide for Good Growth.\\n\\nFollowing this, weâ€™ve been working through 3 more sessions which are designed to align the community around philosophical, emotional and actionable examples of good growth for Season 1.\\n\\n*Letâ€™s take a look at where we are nowâ€¦*\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Workshop #2 & #3 - Manifesting and facilitating Good Growth\\n\\nIn our workshops on *Manifesting* and *Facilitating Good Growth* we had between 12-15 people turn up to each session. Our focus was to confirm some tangible goals for season 1 and think about how specifically Web3 technologies could help us do thisâ€¦\\n\\n*We asked:*\\n\\n### Workshop #2\\n\\n* *What's the first thing we can do on our path to good growth?*\\n* *How can Web3 enable good growth?*\\n\\n([View the Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_luEUIGU=/?invite_link_id=501142974188))\\n\\n### Workshop #3\\n\\n* *How can our Community and social token facilitate meaningful collaboration?*\\n* *How can we structure meaningful conversation?*\\n\\n([View the Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lt5xmHU=/))\\n\\nFollowing the workshop we grouped the thoughts from the Community into some priorities and focuses, ultimately we formed a plan which looked something like this:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-9FXrWuu0TfyL1RrVMrPw.png?height=1290&width=2036)\\n\\nAt a macro level, there were recurring themes around accountability and accessibility, as well the overarching goal of creating a Good Growth Framework that ourselves and others can implement across any community/DAO.\\n\\nThis is a framework which would outline processes and approaches to tokens models, funding, governance and membership which are positive for people, the planet and ultimately â€˜profitableâ€™ for everyone.\\n\\nRunning alongside this exploration, our sessions on *meaningful collaboration and conversation* really brought to life different buckets for how we can implement Good Growth within the Community.\\n\\n**For People:**\\n\\n* Cross DAO programming\\n* Courses and Curriculum\\n* Accessibility Initiatives\\n\\n**For ideas:**\\n\\n* Community Projects\\n* Grant Structures\\n* Bounty based projects\\n\\nThen in Workshop #4, *Defining Season 1* we presented this back to the Community and asked 3 questions:\\n\\n* How close are we with this overview for Season 1?\\n* What are we missing?\\n* How will we achieve these goals?\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oEdyui0VZSwqObsYOomBs.png?height=1050&width=1746)\\n\\n[View the miro](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ls_KkBE=/)\\n\\nFrom this workshop, the community raised key questions like;\\n\\n* Can you clarify the relationship between Protein Community and the wider Protein ecosystem? (agency, coworking space, OS)\\n* How will members be given responsibility and become compensated contributors?\\n* What's the roadmap and timeline for achieving our objectives in Season?\\n* How will the token be used as a financial resource?\\n* How will we raise and distribute funds to projects?\\n* How are we going to reach other communities outside of our bubble with this proposal for season 1 onboarding?\\n\\nThe core team is now using these questions to interrogate and refine the proposal further.\\n\\nWhile the above article is just a WIP teaser of where the Community is right now, we canâ€™t wait to share the full proposal with you.\\n\\nThank you to everyone who contributed to the last 3 workshops\\n\\n@AnaRoman, @Arian, @Dindindeniz, @Domingo Bette Encore, @Faith_robinson, @Gustavo, @Marv | TMT, @Mel, @Oâ€™plerou, @Pri, @zhiganov.eth, @Ink, @Jaybrave, @NatalieCrue, @Shalpern, @Simonvc, @Yrikush @jamees\\n\\nGm, ga, gn,\\n\\nðŸ’š PRTN Team\",\"timestamp\":1634403472,\"title\":\"An update on Good Growth...\",\"publication\":\"protein\"},\"digest\":\"5rkldJStnRNudetTNwc4J-wd22_1NMxwitXNUv5nN9M\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2bbF34c5EAf9498c88c9d1cd04F3885da53670B1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8zFIVpwag5BzibfKZn_qhJRz8nlyld7q5kB5Jmum224\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"BX9bO-s_Lcb-ngVv5yuzKwfsoQWqyNZQeTKHEnb-Fwk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"CIJ1tLmu11yOzRGph1-w-qYp9af6H0lk5ilrnRACNTWLAoMJrn3yAY_XWzXNvulTp8XhvNF8gWbkZwuupPaf9A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0113572bd31bf6b888bbfd3e949ca157a4fae435631418e4fef822193a24817b6a266fb700a532478cd15908cda205df1b3f4448483b51a108fe8ffd917696f91c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on protein.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8zFIVpwag5BzibfKZn_qhJRz8nlyld7q5kB5Jmum224\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"BX9bO-s_Lcb-ngVv5yuzKwfsoQWqyNZQeTKHEnb-Fwk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"gpPsKd38-GDlGtOLdXxzYjV_FsdaQPY4q4wydfKJCu4\"}"
