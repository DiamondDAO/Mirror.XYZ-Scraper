"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Decentralized technologies are starting to revolutionize the financial world, and cryptocurrencies are being applied in different ways to re-create traditional financial instruments.\\nHowever, since cryptocurrencies are not backed by anything but people's confidence in them, they are very volatile.\\nThis means that when it comes to making value loans with cryptocurrencies, neither side can be sure they'll get a fair deal.\\n\\nThere needs to be a way to guarantee the value of loan assets, and this can be done by backing them up with real-world values.\\nThat's where tokenization of real assets comes in.\\nThis process is very simple when we consider tangible assets such as buildings or gold bars, but what about intangible assets such as intellectual property?\\n\\nThe rise of the creator economy has resulted in intangibles accounting for more than 90% of the market value of the S&P 500 index, a number that will only get bigger.\\nThere needs to be a way to unleash more creativity to realize the potential of human capital.\\n\\nStart creator financing\\n\\nFinding a starting point for financing in the creator economy is a huge challenge, especially for newcomers.\\nAs many entrepreneurs in this field have discovered, it's sometimes easier to come up with a good idea than to create a business from it.\\n\\nBy definition, ideas subvert what came before;\\nIt's about new ideas, new technologies, new products, new services and new ways of doing things.\\nDriven in large part by the digital revolution, many creative industries are innovative not only in what they do, but also in how they do it.\\n\\nFinancing can be difficult for several reasons.\\nFirst, banks and investors tend to be conservative.\\nThey like certainty, are unlikely to be moved by an enthusiastic entrepreneur, and believe that a new, untested idea -- be it a design, a software tool, a fashion concept or a video game -- will be a commercial success.\\nIn addition, banks want collateral for their loans, but many creative businesses have no capital assets to offer.\\n\\nStumbling block\\n\\nInvestors specialising in creative industries may indeed recognise the talents of entrepreneurs.\\nBut in return for their investment, they often want some ownership of the idea, and thus some control over its development and marketing.\\nThis may seem unacceptable to creative entrepreneurs who prefer debt financing in the form of loans rather than equity financing in the form of sharing ownership and control of their work with investors.\\n\\nDEIP founder Alex Shkor - a company that is building creators economic agreements - explained to me: \\\"in order for the creator to their work tokens, and collateral to obtain funds, it need to have a set of intelligent contract, it can register assets on the chain, issuance of NFT, assets evaluation, and in the default management and liquidation of the mortgage.\\\"\\n\\nCredit framework for creator economy\\n\\nJust as it is possible to make loans against collateral in the real economy, so it is possible to do so in the creator economy.\\n\\nImagine a game developer (let's call them Jane) working on a side project.\\nAfter a while, with the positive encouragement of her friends and family, Jane decided to turn her side project into a full-time job.\\nBut over the course of a few months, Jane's funds began to dwindle as progress was slower than initially expected;\\nThey are starting to think about full-time work again.\\nThis is not uncommon for budding creators.\\n\\nHowever, with a decentralized platform for knowledge assets, Jane's progress can be evaluated by a decentralized evaluation system that brings together the expertise of people in the field to evaluate unfinished creations, guided by the intrinsic value of ideas.\\nThis intrinsic value is used as input to the mortgage calculation, that is, the value of the loan that it can be issued.\\nJane can use the loans made available to them for whatever purpose they like;\\nIn that case, support them when they finish developing the game.\\n\\nIn addition, small loans can be made to new couples with or without collateral.\\nIf Jane doesn't have any projects, off-the-shelf or partial creations, they still have a chance to get initial funding as a newcomer to the platform.\\nThe loan amount will be small as it is unsecured and the loan itself is supported by the decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) and budget derived from its Ecosystem Fund.\\nThe fund is financed by transaction fees and bandwidth allocation payments from the underlying blockchain.\\n\\nIf the loan is repaid on time, Jane's personal credit rating will be improved.\\nIn this case, if Jane wants to take out another loan, the mortgage coefficient will be reduced, allowing them to borrow more money.\\n\\nIf Jane defaults on her loan, any mortgage assets are assumed by the platform and can be sold to recoup the money through a smart clearing contract.\\nIf Jane does not pledge anything, the default risk is implemented by the platform and borne by the DAO.\\n\\nAs long as the creator's credit history is solid and validated with each new loan, the next batch of loans can be issued on ever-improving terms and conditions.\\nCredit history becomes an integral part of the creator's reputation status.\",\"timestamp\":1634039601,\"title\":\"Unleash creativity with decentralized financ\"},\"digest\":\"xd4maytPWHRTUIqQhqNDRYaor_5pUSqnly4lw7AM-fg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4d740E9c7DA2341bf6E6B7f58228f65599c87016\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"T0gasPpgPOqjL7vDaEKz6xAbZw7ybP75xqcsk-J02Qc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"plv9ECCj53QI0jr5CzIba6Z6Oa0gz1q8Fnu1k_OytU0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"cYhUJVQqSa33lyeW7DFfkCHgGes61zcno25uJjzuQBb90ikG4vON7kzi5TfmzuzAn02mDinXeLipxCOwKHwefQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5799513e079f1a495e3b8dcefb61c73a329734566f7f635c5065ec85d11309371d2be01161e892a679102ace47af4643145594d8d96b6967470b094d125d64d21b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"T0gasPpgPOqjL7vDaEKz6xAbZw7ybP75xqcsk-J02Qc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"plv9ECCj53QI0jr5CzIba6Z6Oa0gz1q8Fnu1k_OytU0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"xd4maytPWHRTUIqQhqNDRYaor_5pUSqnly4lw7AM-fg\"}"
