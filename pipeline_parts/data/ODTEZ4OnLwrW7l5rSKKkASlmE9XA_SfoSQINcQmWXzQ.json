"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**[Good Vibe Hunters](https://www.instagram.com/goodvibehunters) is an adventure lifestyle brand with big ambitions to disrupt the Travel, Apparel and Event Management industries by using the power of community and the shared ownership economy.**\\n\\nThe goal here is to create a rapidly growing decentralised organisation of like minded individuals that work towards a global DAO of interlinked real world, and web3 businesses - think Contiki Group Travel, Nomads Hostels, Patagonia and Tomorrowland all under one DAO.\\n\\nThis does sound very ambitious on the surface. But when broken down into bite sized pieces and baby steps coupled with a global network of different people with different talents and resources, the trajectory towards big goals is far easier than a traditional business model.\\n\\nWeb3 has created a thriving community of online avatars who have been busy creating the infrastructure for a new frontier, now it is time to turn this dream into reality..\\n\\n### Background\\n\\nGood Vibe Hunters was created in 2014 with the idea to have community generated content from followers on instagram wearing our apparel whilst outdoors doing whatever their idea of good vibe hunting might be. It did not take long for hashtag #goodvibehunters to got from 0 to 10,000+ posts. It was very interesting to see how the sky diving community became the leading group of good vibe hunters, followed closely by SUP Yoga.. Neither of which, either of us two Aussie founders had ever done!\\n\\nUnfortunately as we were traveling Europe ourselves, we did not exactly have the stability to be processing clothing orders out of our backpacks! And such, the momentum fizzled out.\\n\\n### The Future is faster than you think..\\n\\n*We are currently in the middle of a multitude of converging technologies as well as macro economic themes that I believe are setting the scene for one of the greatest opportunities in a lifetime. Let me explain..*\\n\\n1. Web3 and DAO’s - Let’s be honest, we are all still figuring out the possibilities of what this entails. If you have zero understanding, I suggest starting with[ this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=260&v=IooTahsgXTs&feature=emb_logo&ab_channel=Upstream) explainer video.\\n2. The rise of the gig economy - First Uber, then Freelancer and now Web3. People want to work when they want, **where they want** on what they want!\\n3. Covid-19 - The global lockdowns have created opportunities in the most pent up industry: **Travel**.. 2 Years of forced savings have 18-35 year olds the world over ready to explore!\\n4. Struggling Countries - Some Countries have faired better than others, unfortunately some fan favourites have not done so well. But that could create opportunities to scoop up cheap digital nomad resorts/hostels.\\n\\n### Ok, let’s talk details!\\n\\n*GVHDAO is a token to help fund the foundations of a decentralised travel, event and apparel company. All will interlink some way in the future.*\\n\\n**Real world income opportunities include:**\\n\\n* Shopify Store with community designed and managed products.\\n* Group Travel Tours, location and activities included voted by $GVHDAO holders\\n* *Purchase and manage a chain of hostels (Start with one!) token holders share economic benefits*\\n* Community created content with advertising revenue on platforms like Youtube\\n* Music Festival or special event, voted by token holders.\\n* Many more opportunities as the brand recognition grows.\\n\\n**Web3 income opportunities:**\\n\\n* A “Golden Ticket” NFT sale. For example: 500 Golden tickets, 10 ETH each. Ticket holders has lifetime free access to all events and accomodation. This alone, could fund the first hostel purchase in a location like Bali, Indonesia.\\n* Treasury yield farming (Attractive interest rates earn’t on funds in the treasury by using various DeFi Protocols)\\n* Other lower tier NFT’s with transaction fee income.\\n* Metaverse Meetups and events\\n\\n### What are the details of this project? (COMING SOON)\\n\\nWe are raising 10 ETH, with contributions capped at 0.25 ETH. That ensures a reasonable number of people are able to participate. Allocations are made on a first come, first serve basis. If you don’t have an Ethereum wallet, I recommend downloading[ Rainbow’s](https://rainbow.me/) mobile app (iOS only).[ Metamask](https://metamask.io/) is a good alternative.\\n\\nContributors will receive a stake in $GVHDAO, our token.\\n\\n### What do $GVHDAO holders get? (COMING SOON)\\n\\nAs this is the foundation or “seed investment” round, the risks of a wasted investment are at their highest. As such, a high risk should come with high reward. By backing the crowdfund, supporters receive three primary benefits if the project is a success.\\n\\n1. Profit distribution similar to dividends\\n2. Founders “Golden Ticket” NFT \\\\*Coming Soon\\n3. Voting rights in business decisions\\n\\nAbove all, you will be entering into the process of building this with us.\\n\\n### What happens after I back this crowdfund? (COMING SOON)\\n\\nAll proceeds of this initial crowdfund are for idea validation and to fund the expansion of the community, start building the correct governance and smart contracts. Funds will be held in a treasury to be spent on the most efficient investments to take us to the next step.\\n\\n### Let’s break it down.\\n\\n*Ok, you may still be thinking this is still overwhelming. So let me break it down into the initial problems that come to mind and need solutions..*\\n\\n1. How do I know if any of this is even possible?\\n\\n   *SOLUTION: That is why I created this initial pitch. I will then go ahead and share it around with all the leading Web3 thinkers to scrutinise.*\\n2. I don’ have all the coding and design skills required to build a global corporation\\n\\n   *SOLUTION: Find like minded people with the skills I am lacking, if they do not want to join the community but have the skills we are after, use the treasury funds or $GVHDAO tokens to pay for their services.*\\n3. What about all the legal requirements to operate an international corporation? \\n\\n   *SOLUTION: Find the right person to navigate this difficult question.*\\n4. How do I avoid being scammed or rug pulled?\\n\\n   *SOLUTION: Total transparency is key. If I can build a solid community of contributors that understand and agree on the long game (building revenue streams and a collection of assets that have utility) coupled with the leading cyber security systems, the organisation could grow exponentially. Corruption and greed is the major drag on any growing enterprise.*\\n\\n**Next Steps: (AFTER SEED ROUND)**\\n\\nAs I mentioned earlier, this initial “seed round” is to connect with and find a founding group of likeminded individuals that agree with the vision. Once we have found 10-100 people with the skills required and built a treasury, the next steps would be to:\\n\\n1. Set up and organise a Discord Chat Group\\n2. Improve the DAO Smart Contract and Treasury Management\\n3. Grow the community\\n4. Grow the traditional social media profiles\\n5. Organise 2nd Round of Funding - Proceeds used to hire the missing pieces to the puzzle!\\n6. Design the NFT’s with correct and economic use cases \\n7. Sell NFT’s\\n8. Vote on second funding round\\n9. Vote on first project (Example: Special Event, Purchase a Hostel, Shopify Products ect)\\n\\nRegister your interest by joining the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rxjaFVft)\",\"timestamp\":1641525579,\"title\":\"GVH DAO - Idea Validation..\"},\"digest\":\"PBkpzOTRii5O-4r1OSga2UI-AjOY2Ks0j9ETkfj6hZs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD6F067bbAB8D8b15Bd3450606bb0951E5B82Bf6B\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"iZ23FYrQ3lsFzzzqEdpgKK5VeaClp3YMUjBcAQIhOaE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"CheMvo6bOVQ48MHme_HgIUuy5URC0YZV9Clg1PxcudI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"h_lED5hT09-ZNSHyhHmUQMRtcj1-ZY-CkM6oUFnOvO3wBtxqrwfiunt0dvxKnjqWIUTSdQVxyxhN0GqrpoCuIg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x37eea53903b0fb97d86770371f00d4bf074064a19231434bae120f3783c568b95544a28d158f1854eb4d4f309a74d1fd8215833b5d5105fc9ce8b5874d75914b1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"iZ23FYrQ3lsFzzzqEdpgKK5VeaClp3YMUjBcAQIhOaE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"CheMvo6bOVQ48MHme_HgIUuy5URC0YZV9Clg1PxcudI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"a-86MKtik_WRizDj2GYpTcrCcdcd4ucx2vyCR5PX1TQ\"}"
