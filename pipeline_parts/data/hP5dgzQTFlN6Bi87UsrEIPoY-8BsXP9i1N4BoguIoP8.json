"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"![The Startup Boxset](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6W845RR9xm9sSbQMxzNKb.png?height=2381&width=3288)\\n\\nI'm preparing to deploy my Genesis collection, [The Startup](http://thestartupnft.com/), 4.444 collectible artworks that grant holders membership in the Founding Members Club (FMC) and I'm nervous. I don't know what to expect, what people will think or if they will understand and see my vision. The anxiety surrounding it is nanas, N A N A S.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1469524159587774466?s=20](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1469524159587774466?s=20)\\n\\nWant to own a piece of a tech startup with patent pending technology that’s also developing the a web3 engage to earn (E2E) social media platform? Well now you can, [The Startup](http://thestartupnft.com/) is a collection of NFTs that allow you to do just that.\\n\\nThe First of it’s kind, [The Startup](http://thestartupnft.com/) is a collection of 4.444 that makes holders co-founders of a startup and gives them membership in the Founding Members Club(FMC). FMC is a social exercise created by [The Founder](https://www.twitter.com/kstephon) to provide a platform for its members to network, exchange ideas, contribute, give insight, knowledge and resources in order to help scale a startup along with The Founder.\\n\\n> *'Want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together' - unknown*\\n\\nBuilding a company isn't about being the boss or being the boss of someone, it's about adding value to others. The Founder via [The Startup](http://thestartupnft.com/) wants to encourage levels of ownership, empower members to make decisions that heighten innovation, personal productivity and wants to as well empower each member to think like an en·tre·pre·neur. This collectible artwork is for private membership making holders apart of a club for Founding Members dedicated to building, scaling, supercharging and contributing to an innovative community driven startup with The Founder.\\n\\n![Boxset Content](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/C8xK0wdNjE341wyeMgAQT.png?height=500&width=1500)\\n\\nEvery person that purchases one or more collectible artwork will receive a gift called a SAFE, Simple Agreement for Future Equity, which was created by Y-Combinator in Silicon Valley and is used by investors when investing in startup companies. Members also get Data Room access, a pitch deck presentation prepared by The Founder with startup and current project details.\\n\\nMembership allows members to ask business related questions, give feedback, vote on the startups next hires, apply to help with a project, attend virtual meetings, make suggestions, take free courses to learn about building a startup from A to Z, attend private events, get information about the startup only co-founders and investors are privy to, plus more.\\n\\nEvery holder that spends 1 ETH or more will receive [The Startup](http://thestartupnft.com/) Boxset with exclusive membership perks, far more utilization and additional member benefits. The Boxset will come with every item pictured, merch and other cool gifts to show our appreciation for their support. There will be 4 golden tickets that may or may not be in a boxset, if found the holder with a golden ticket will receive even more perks.\\n\\n![Business Card: Angel](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V_REmPC-KCJz5RHFdS4KY.png?height=1454&width=1104)\\n\\nAll of the funds received from this collection will be used to scale ‘the startup’, to develop consumer tech products like the first web3 engage to earn (E2E) social media platform, hire great people and ensure that the community benefits long term. We are a community first project, 100% member focused, so our roadmap will change as we hear suggestions and receive votes from our founding members!\\n\\nMembership is limited and is closed once we reach the valuation cap within the terms of the SAFE, there are only 4,444 assets to be claimed. Each is a lifetime membership, which is as well sellable and transferable via the Ethereum blockchain. Resells are encouraged as it is a way to refer or initiate new members in the Founding Members Club until we reach the cap set within the terms of the SAFE.\\n\\nAll player card (128) collectibles will be minted first for early adopters to purchase at a discounted rate. All other NFTs will be minted by users that want to support the project and join FMC. We encourage anyone interested to join [the Discord group](https://discord.gg/sETWZh3GXR) and as well check out [The Startup](http://thestartupnft.com/) for more information.\\n\\n**Collection Contents:**\\n\\n* *128 Player Cards*\\n* *61 Player Credential IDs*\\n* *270 Challenge Plates*\\n* *477 Business Cards*\\n* *3508 Community Cards*\\n\\n**FMC Objectives Include:**\\n\\n* *Strategizing*\\n* *Project Development*\\n* *Project Resources (Intros, Designers, Developers)*\\n* *Feedback*\\n* *Polls*\\n* *Private Events*\\n* *+More*\\n\\n![Space Plate: Silicon Valley](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4GMpFtm5Q4x5FLxwZR3IM.png?height=1000&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639232659,\"title\":\"The Startup\"},\"digest\":\"ghWPJneXBaiBG7NmuHhmptlAPw-jIyeOcb69BVra9iI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa4Cd575392CaB84a804cdcef3C3fDcE134B451ed\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tivR_zhl9utWoj_yil88XenVVf75D3mFNDiiLtficG8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"shKxvZ5kr19aWf96OCEBVoOMLJER6_dq48UZ4ot1TMw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"hsqCSYY01XXhkXXhFwTUeWdPpk0Iyea2fmnTTYHXr4vuRFLpIdMithYeJMlvBm-xJO7doGzAjmZgAEMcm9xmdg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x92a1125fe4b4b18854f6f54edd90fca0d40ee9142d64b040b314d441add17bd67f297b76bad5169171ba7b09f031e1bbfdb96504089654774b240fba8f0f47dc01\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tivR_zhl9utWoj_yil88XenVVf75D3mFNDiiLtficG8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"shKxvZ5kr19aWf96OCEBVoOMLJER6_dq48UZ4ot1TMw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"umT7oz4_sIkM5S7GLDEjSxCXVle6STSU5R7mtcgh25U\"}"
