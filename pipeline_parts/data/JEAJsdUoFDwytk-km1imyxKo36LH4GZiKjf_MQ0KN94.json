"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"that in coming here you would deprive yourself forever of the income you received? Did no inward voice tell you that all would be changed when you compelled me, Lia d'Argeles, to say, 'Well, yes, it is true; you are my son? ' So long as you did not know who and what I was, I had a mother's right to watch over you.  I could help you without disgracing you, without despising you.  But now that you know me, and know what I am, I can do nothing more for you--nothing! I would rather let you starve than succor you, for I would rather see you dead than dishonored by my money.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What! would you still consent to receive the allowance I have made you, even if I consented to continue it?\\\"\\n\\nHad a viper raised its head in M. Wilkie's path he would not have recoiled more quickly.  \\\"Never!\\\" he exclaimed.  \\\"Ah, no! What do you take me for?\\\"\\n\\nThis repugnance was sincere; there could be no doubt of that, and it seemed to give Madame d'Argeles a ray of hope.  \\\"I have misjudged him,\\\" she thought.  \\\"Poor Wilkie! Evil advice has led him astray; but he is not bad at heart.  In that case, my poor child,\\\" she said aloud, \\\"you must see that a new life is about to commence for you.  What do you intend to do? How will you gain a livelihood? People must have food, and clothes, and a roof to shelter them.  These things cost money.  And where will you obtain it--you who rebel at the very word work? Ah! if I had only listened to M. Patterson.  He was not blind like myself.  He was always telling me that I was spoiling you, and ruining your future by giving you so much money.  Do you know that you have spent more than fifty thousand francs during the past two years? How have you squandered them? Have you been to the law-school a dozen times?  No.  But you can be seen at the races, at the opera, in the fashionable restaurants, and at every place of amusement where a young man can squander money.  And who are your associates? Dissipated and heartless idlers, grooms, gamblers, and abandoned women.\\\"\\n\\nA sneer from M. Wilkie interrupted her.  To think that any one should dare to attack his friends, his tastes, and his pleasures.  Such a thing was not to be tolerated.  \\\"This is astonishing-- astonishing, upon my word!\\\" said he.  \\\"You moralizing! that's really too good! I should like a few minutes to laugh; it is too ridiculous!\\\"\\n\\nWas he really conscious of the cruelty of his ironical words? The blow was so terrible that Madame d'Argeles staggered beneath it.  She was prepared for anything and everything except this insult from her son.  Still, she accepted it without rebellion, although it was in a tone of heart-broken anguish that she replied: \\\"Perhaps I have no right to tell you the truth.  I hope the future will prove that I am wrong.  However, you are without resources, and you have no profession.  Pray Heaven that you may never know what it is to be hungry and to have no bread.\\\"\\n\\nFor some time already the ingenious young man had shown unmistakable signs of impatience.  This gloomy prediction irritated him beyond endurance.\\n\\n\\\"All this is empty talk,\\\" he interrupted.  \\\"I don't mean to work, for it's not at all in my line.  Still, I don't expect to want for anything! That's plain enough, I hope.\\\"\\n\\nMadame d'Argeles did not wince.  \\\"What do you mean to do then?\\\" she asked, coldly.  \\\"I don't understand you.\\\"\\n\\nHe shrugged his shoulders impatiently.  \\\"Are we to keep up this farce for ever?\\\" he petulantly exclaimed.  \\\"It doesn't take with me.  You know what I mean as well as I do.  Why do you talk to me about dying of starvation? What about the fortune?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What fortune?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Eh? why, my uncle's, of course! Your brother's, the Count de Chalusse.\\\"\\n\\nNow M. Wilkie's visit, manner, assurance, wheedling, and contradictions were all explained.  That maternal confidence which is so strong in the hearts of mothers vanished from Madame d'Argeles's for ever.  The depths of selfishness and cunning she discerned in Wilkie's mind appalled her.  She now understood why he had declared himself ready to brave public opinion--why he had proved willing to accept his share of the past ignominy.  It was not his mother's, but the Count de Chalusse's estate that he claimed.  \\\"Ah! so you've heard of that,\\\" she said, in a tone of bitter irony.  And then, remembering M. Isidore Fortunat, she asked: \\\"Some one has sold you this valuable secret.  How much have you promised to pay him in case of success?\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Wilkie prided himself on being very clever, he did not pretend to be a diplomatist, and, indeed, he was greatly disconcerted by this question; still, recovering himself, he replied: \\\"It doesn't matter how I obtained the information-- whether I paid for it, or whether it cost me nothing--but I know that you are a Chalusse, and that you are the heiress of the count's property, which is valued at eight or ten millions of francs.  Do you deny it?\\\"\\n\\nMadame d'Argeles sadly shook her head.  \\\"I deny nothing,\\\" she replied, \\\"but I am about to tell you something which will destroy all your plans and extinguish your hopes.  I am resolved, understand, and my resolution is irrevocable, never to assert my rights.  To receive this fortune, I should be obliged to confess that Lia d'Argeles is a Chalusse--and that is a confession which no consideration whatever will wring from me.\\\"\\n\\nShe imagined that this declaration would silence and discomfit Wilkie, but she was mistaken.  If he had been obliged to depend upon himself he would perhaps have been conquered by it; but he was armed with weapons which had been furnished by the cunning viscount.  So he shrugged his shoulders, and coolly replied: \\\"In that case we should remain poor, and the government would take possession of our millions.  One moment.  I have something to say in this matter.  You may renounce your claim, but I shall not renounce mine.  I am your son, and I shall claim the property.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Even if I entreated you on my knees not to do so?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\nMadame d'Argeles's eyes flashed.  \\\"Very well.  I will show you that this estate can never be yours.  By what right will you lay claim to it? Because you are my son? But I will deny that you are.  I will declare upon oath that you are nothing to me, and that I don't even know you.\\\"\\n\\nBut even this did not daunt Wilkie.  He drew from his pocket a scrap of paper, and flourishing it triumphantly, he exclaimed: \\\"It would be extremely cruel on your part to deny me, but I foresaw such a contingency, and here is my answer, copied from the civil code: 'Article 341.  Inquiry as to maternity allowed, etc., etc.'\\\"\\n\\nWhat the exact bearing of Wilkie's threat might be Madame d'Argeles did not know.  But she felt that this Article 341 would no doubt destroy her last hope; for the person who had chosen this weapon from the code to place it in Wilkie's hand must have chosen it carefully.  She understood the situation perfectly.  With her experience of life, she could not fail to understand the despicable part Wilkie was playing.  And though it was not her son who had conceived this odious plot, it was more than enough to know that he had consented to carry it into execution.  Should she try to persuade Wilkie to abandon this shameful scheme? She might have done so if she had not been so horrified by the utter want of principle which she had discovered in his character.  But, under the circumstances, she realized that any effort in this direction would prove unavailing.  So it was purely from a sense of duty and to prevent her conscience from reproaching her that she exclaimed: \\\"So you will apply to the courts in order to constrain me to acknowledge you as my son?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you are not reasonable----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is to say, you care nothing for the scandal that will be created by such a course.  In order to prove yourself a member of the Chalusse family you will begin by disgracing the name and dragging it through the mire.\\\"\\n\\nWilkie had no wish to prolong this discussion.  So much talk about an affair, which, in his opinion, at least, was an extremely simple one, seemed to him utterly ridiculous, and irritated him beyond endurance.  \\\"It strikes me this is much ado about nothing,\\\" he remarked.  \\\"One would suppose, to hear you talk, that you were the greatest criminal in the world.  Goodness is all very well in its way, but there is such a thing as having too much of it! Break loose from this life to-morrow, assume your rightful name, install yourself at the Hotel de Chalusse, and in a week from now no one will remember that you were once known as Lia d'Argeles.  I wager one hundred louis on it.  Why, if people attempted to rake up the past life of their acquaintances, they should have far too much to do.  Folks do not trouble themselves as to whether a person has done this or that; the essential thing is to have plenty of money.  And if any fool speaks slightingly of you, you can reply: 'I have an income of five hundred thousand francs,' and he'll say no more.\\\"\\n\\nMadame d'Argeles listened, speechless with horror and disgust.  Was it really her son who was speaking in this style, and to her of all people in the world? M. Wilkie misunderstood her silence.  He had an excellent opinion of himself, but he was rather surprised at the effect of his eloquence.  \\\"Besides, I'm tired of vegetating, and having only one name,\\\" he continued.  \\\"I want to be on the move.  Even with the small allowance I've had, I have gained a very good position in society; and if I had plenty of money I should be the most stylish man in Paris.  The count's estate belongs to me, and so I must have it--in fact, I will have it.  So believe me when I tell you that it will be much better for you if you acknowledge me without any fuss! Now, will you do so? No? Once, twice, three times? Is it still no? Very well then; to- morrow, then, you may expect an official notice.  I wish you good- evening.\\\"\\n\\nHe bowed; he was really going, for his hand was already on the door-knob.  But Madame d'Argeles detained him with a gesture.  \\\"One word more,\\\" she said, in a voice hoarse with emotion.\\n\\nHe scarcely deigned to come back, and he made no attempt to conceal his impatience.  \\\"Well, what is it?\\\" he asked, hastily.\\n\\n\\\"I wish to give you a bit of parting advice.  The court will undoubtedly decide in your favor; I shall be placed in possession of my brother's estate; but neither you nor I will have the disposal of these millions.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because, though this fortune belongs to me, the control of it belongs to your father.\\\"\\n\\nM. Wilkie was thunderstruck.  \\\"To my father?\\\" he exclaimed.  \\\"Impossible!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is so, however; and you would not have been ignorant of the fact, if your greed for money had not made you forget to question me.  You believe yourself an illegitimate child.  Wilkie, you are mistaken.  You are my legitimate child.  I am a married woman----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Bah!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And my husband--your father--is not dead.  If he is not here now, threatening our safety, it is because I have succeeded in eluding him.  He lost all trace of us eighteen years ago.  Since then he has been constantly striving to discover us, but in vain.  He is still watching, you may be sure of that; and as soon as there is any talk of a law-suit respecting the Chalusse property, you will see him appear, armed with his rights.  He is the head of the family--your master and mine.  Ah! this seems to disturb you.  You will find him full of insatiable greed for wealth, a greed which has been whetted by twenty years' waiting.  You may yet see the day when you will regret the paltry twenty thousand francs a year formerly given you by your poor mother.\\\"\\n\\nWilkie's face was whiter than his shirt.  \\\"You are deceiving me,\\\" he stammered.\\n\\n\\\"To-morrow I will show you my marriage certificate.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why not this evening?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because it is locked up in a room which is now full of people.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And what was my father's name?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Arthur Gordon--he is an American.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then my name is Wilkie Gordon?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And---is my father rich?\\\" he inquired.\\n\\n\\\"No.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What does he do?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Everything that a man can do when he has a taste for luxury and a horror for work.\\\"\\n\\nThis reply was so explicit in its brevity, and implied so many terrible accusations, that Wilkie was dismayed.  \\\"The devil!\\\" he exclaimed, \\\"and where does he live!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He lives at Baden or Homburg in the summer; in Paris or at Monaco in the winter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh! oh! oh!\\\" ejaculated Wilkie, in three different tones.  He knew what he had to expect from such a father as that.  Anger now followed stupor--one of those terrible, white rages which stir the bile and not the blood.  He saw his hopes and his cherished visions fade.  Luxury and notoriety, high-stepping horses, yellow- haired mistresses, all vanished.  He pictured himself reduced to a mere pittance, and held in check and domineered over by a brutal father.  \\\"Ah! I understand your game,\\\" he hissed through his set teeth.  \\\"If you would only quietly assert your rights, everything could be arranged privately, and I should have time to put the property out of my father's reach before he could claim it.  Instead of doing that--as you hate me--you compel me to make the affair public, so that my father will hear of it and defraud me of everything.  But you won't play this trick on me.  You are going to write at once, and make known your claim to your brother's estate.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah! you won't? You refuse----\\\" He approached threateningly, and caught hold of her arm.  \\\"Take care!\\\" he vociferated; \\\"take care! Do not infuriate me beyond endurance----\\\"\\n\\nAs cold and rigid as marble, Madame d'Argeles faced him with the undaunted glance of a martyr whose spirit no violence can subdue.  \\\"You will obtain nothing from me,\\\" she said, firmly; \\\"nothing, nothing, nothing!\\\"\\n\\nMaddened with rage and disappointment, M. Wilkie dared to lift his hand as if about to strike her.  But at this moment the door was flung open, and a man sprang upon him.  It was Baron Trigault.\\n\\nLike the other guests, the baron had seen the terrible effect produced upon Madame d'Argeles by a simple visiting card.  But he had this advantage over the others: he thought he could divine and explain the reason of this sudden, seemingly incomprehensible terror.  \\\"The poor woman has been betrayed,\\\" he thought; \\\"her son is here!\\\" Still, while the other players crowded around their hostess, he did not leave the card-table.  He was sitting opposite M. de Coralth, and he had seen the dashing viscount start and change color.  His suspicions were instantly aroused, and he wished to verify them.  He therefore pretended to be more than ever absorbed in the cards, and swore lustily at the deserters who had broken up the game.  \\\"Come back, gentleman, come back,\\\" he cried, angrily.  \\\"We are wasting precious time.  While you have been trifling there, I might have gained--or lost--a hundred louis.\\\"\\n\\nHe was nevertheless greatly alarmed, and the prolonged absence of Madame d'Argeles increased his fears each moment.  At the end of an hour he could restrain himself no longer.  So taking advantage of a heavy loss, he rose from the table, swearing that the beastly turmoil of a few moments before had changed the luck.  Then passing into the adjoining drawing-room, he managed to make his escape unobserved.  \\\"Where is madame?\\\" he inquired of the first servant he met.\\n\\n\\\"In the little sitting-room.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Alone?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No; a young gentleman is with her.\\\"\\n\\nThe baron no longer doubted the correctness of his conjectures, and his disquietude increased.  Quickly, and as if he had been in his own house, he hastened to the door of the little sitting-room and listened.  At that moment rage was imparting a truly frightful intonation to M. Wilkie's voice.  The baron really felt alarmed.  He stooped, applied his eye to the keyhole, and seeing M. Wilkie with his hand uplifted, he burst open the door and went in.  He arrived only just in time to fell Wilkie to the floor, and save Madame d'Argeles from that most terrible of humiliations: the degradation of being struck by her own son.  \\\"Ah, you rascal!\\\" cried the worthy baron, transported with indignation, \\\"you beggarly rascal! you brigand! Is this the way you treat an unfortunate woman who has sacrificed herself for you--your mother? You try to strike your mother, when you ought to kiss her very footprints!\\\"\\n\\nAs livid as if his blood had been suddenly turned to gall--with quivering lips and eyes starting from their sockets--M. Wilkie rose, with difficulty, to his feet, at the same time rubbing his left elbow which had struck against the corner of a piece of furniture, in his fall.  \\\"Scoundrel! You brutal scoundrel!\\\" he growled, ferociously.  And then, retreating a step: \\\"Who gave you permission to come in here?\\\" he added.  \\\"Who are you? By what right do you meddle with my affairs?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"By the right that every honest man possesses to chastise a cowardly rascal.\\\"\\n\\nM. Wilkie shook his fist at the baron.  \\\"You are a coward yourself,\\\" he retorted.  \\\"You had better learn who you are talking to! You must mend your manners a little, you old----\\\"\\n\\nThe word he uttered was so vile that no man could fail to resent it, much less the baron, who was already frantic with passion.  His faced turned as purple as if he were stricken with apoplexy, and such furious rage gleamed in his eyes that Madame d'Argeles was frightened.  She feared she should see her son butchered before her very eyes, and she extended her arms as if to protect him.  \\\"Jacques,\\\" she said beseechingly, \\\"Jacques!\\\"\\n\\nThis was the name which was indelibly impressed upon Wilkie's memory--the name he had heard when he was but a child.  Jacques-- that was the name of the man who had brought him cakes and toys in the comfortable rooms where he had remained only a few days.  He understood, or at least he thought he understood, everything.  \\\"Ah, ha!\\\" he exclaimed, with a laugh that was at once both ferocious and idiotic.  \\\"This is very fine--monsieur is the lover.  He has the say here--he--\\\"\\n\\nHe did not have time to finish his sentence, for quick as thought the baron caught him by the collar, lifted him from the ground with irresistible strength, and flung him on his knees at Madame d'Argeles's feet, exclaiming: \\\"Ask her pardon, you vile wretch! Ask her pardon, or----\\\" \\\"Or\\\" meant the baron's clinched fist descending like a sledge-hammer on M. Wilkie's head.\\n\\nThe worthy youth was frightened--so terribly frightened that his teeth chattered.  \\\"Pardon!\\\" he faltered.\\n\\n\\\"Louder--speak up better than that.  Your mother must answer you!\\\"\\n\\nAlas! the poor woman could no longer hear.  She had endured so much during the past hour that her strength was exhausted, and she had fallen back in her arm-chair in a deep swoon.  The baron waited for a moment, and seeing that her eyes remained obstinately closed, he exclaimed: \\\"This is your work, wretch!\\\"\\n\\nAnd lifting him again, as easily as if he had been a child, he set him on his feet, saying in a calmer tone, but in one that admitted of no reply: \\\"Arrange your clothes and go.\\\"\\n\\nThis advice was not unnecessary.  Baron Trigault had a powerful hand; and M. Wilkie's attire was decidedly the worse for the encounter.  He had lost his cravat, his shirt-front was crumpled and torn, and his waistcoat--one of those that open to the waist and are fastened by a single button--hung down in the most dejected manner.  He obeyed the baron's order without a word, but not without considerable difficulty, for his hands trembled like a leaf.  When he had finished, the baron exclaimed: \\\"Now be off; and never set foot here again--understand me--never set foot here again, never!\\\"\\n\\nM. Wilkie made no reply until he reached the door leading into the hall.  But when he had opened it, he suddenly regained his powers of speech.  \\\"I'm not afraid of you,\\\" he cried, with frantic violence.  \\\"You have taken advantage of your superior strength-- you are a coward.  But this shall not end here.  No!--you shall answer for it.  I shall find your address, and to-morrow you will receive a visit from my friends M. Costard and M. Serpillon.  I am the insulted party--and I choose swords!\\\"\\n\\nA frightful oath from the baron somewhat hastened M. Wilkie's exit.  He went out into the hall, and holding the door open, in a way that would enable him to close it at the shortest notice, he shouted back, so as to be heard by all the servants: \\\"Yes; I will have satisfaction.  I will not stand such treatment.  Is it any fault of mine that Madame d'Argeles is a Chalusse, and that she wishes to defraud me of my fortune.  To-morrow, I call you all to witness, there will be a lawyer here.  You don't frighten me.  Here is my card!\\\" And actually, before he closed the door, he threw one of his cards into the middle of the room.\\n\\nThe baron did not trouble himself to pick it up; his attention was devoted to Madame d'Argeles.  She was lying back in her arm-chair, white, motionless and rigid, to all appearance dead.  What should the baron do? He did not wish to call the servants; they had heard too much already--but he had almost decided to do so, when his eyes fell upon a tiny aquarium, in a corner of the room.  He dipped his handkerchief in it; and alternately bathed Madame d'Argeles's temples and chafed her hands.  It was not long before the cold water revived her.  She trembled, a convulsive shudder shook her from head to foot, and at last she opened her eyes, murmuring: \\\"Wilkie!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have sent him away,\\\" replied the baron.\\n\\nPoor woman! with returning life came the consciousness of the terrible reality.  \\\"He is my son!\\\" she moaned, \\\"my son, my Wilkie!\\\" Then with a despairing gesture she pressed her hands to her forehead as if to calm its throbbings.  \\\"And I believed that my sin was expiated,\\\" she pursued.  \\\"I thought I had been sufficiently punished.  Fool that I was! This is my chastisement, Jacques.  Ah! women like me have no right to be mothers!\\\"\\n\\nA burning tear coursed down the baron's cheek; but he concealed his emotion as well as he could, and said, in a tone of assumed gayety: \\\"Nonsense! Wilkie is young--he will mend his ways! We were all ridiculous when we were twenty.  We have all caused our mothers many anxious nights.  Time will set everything to rights, and put some ballast in this young madcap's brains.  Besides, your friend Patterson doesn't seem to me quite free from blame.  In knowledge of books, he may have been unequalled; but as a guardian for youth, he must have been the worst of fools.  After keeping your son on a short allowance for years, he suddenly gorges him with oats--or I should say, money--lets him loose; and then seems surprised because the boy is guilty of acts of folly.  It would be a miracle if he were not.  So take courage, and hope for the best, my dear Lia.\\\"\\n\\nShe shook her head despondingly.  \\\"Do you suppose that my heart hasn't pleaded for him?\\\" she said.  \\\"I am his mother; I can never cease to love him, whatever he may do.  Even now I am ready to give a drop of blood for each tear I can save him.  But I am not blind; I have read his nature.  Wilkie has no heart.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah! my dear friend, how do you know what shameful advice he may have received before coming to you?\\\"\\n\\nMadame d'Argeles half rose, and said, in an agitated voice: \\\"What! you try to make me believe that? 'Advice!' Then he must have found a man who said to him: 'Go to the house of this unfortunate woman who gave you birth, and order her to publish her dishonor and yours.  If she refuses, insult and beat her! 'You know, even better than I, baron, that this is impossible.  In the vilest natures, and when every other honorable feeling has been lost, love for one's mother survives.  Even convicts deprive themselves of their wine, and sell their rations, in order to send a trifle now and then to their mothers--while he----\\\"\\n\\nShe paused, not because she shrunk from what she was about to say, but because she was exhausted and out of breath.  She rested for a moment, and then resumed in a calmer tone: \\\"Besides, the person who sent him here had counselled coolness and prudence.  I  discovered this at once.  It was only toward the close of the interview, and after an unexpected revelation from me, that he lost all control over himself.  The thought that he would lose my brother's millions crazed him.  Oh! that fatal and accursed money! Wilkie's adviser wished him to employ legal means to obtain an acknowledgment of his parentage; and he had copied from the Code a clause which is applicable to this case.  By this one circumstance I am convinced that his adviser is a man of experience in such matters--in other words, the business agent----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What business agent?\\\" inquired the baron.\",\"timestamp\":1640139637,\"title\":\"\\nBut he was not allowed a hearing.  \\\"Fool!\\\" continued Madame d'Argeles, \\\"did nothing warn you\"},\"digest\":\"lg7nQ37r7_jFIRRLMbjl6aogOhuozxaTsNmQzXHup7w\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9dA14EBFe3CfE059a88A873b83F5D7f596175316\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Vr9mz7EqldPV2kniitM4J-1aZfXwXlT5Xs3lfwOEz5A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"RPh0MZXdbiG7R5wM1roGlkzqHG-WoRS0HO-D8EF2YN0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"hm-3UbrT4hQLR2ll_5RXGd69aDBcni6e5FLcXQuNFwOhcHLektP2TegYLOckRD_0FZiQehn_pwjRu1OH-uloRw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd6c056777e7fb61f183b8f8c873e0a207f13c771a327c86151ce972d710f31bd140741479950240e21b37416710e6f59fc2774c33b14de34575f90194b595e0f1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Vr9mz7EqldPV2kniitM4J-1aZfXwXlT5Xs3lfwOEz5A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"RPh0MZXdbiG7R5wM1roGlkzqHG-WoRS0HO-D8EF2YN0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"lg7nQ37r7_jFIRRLMbjl6aogOhuozxaTsNmQzXHup7w\"}"
