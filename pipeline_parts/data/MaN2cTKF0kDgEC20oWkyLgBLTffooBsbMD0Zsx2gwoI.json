"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Hey everybody. Hope you all are safe and doing great.\\n\\nToday we’ll know about the chaos in DAOs’ Discord channel.\\n\\nFor the new users, discord is pretty clunky to use. And if they are new to web3 , then it’s total chaos.\\n\\nEvery DAO (nowadays) starts by the formation of their discord channel. Some free to join, some token-gated.\\n\\nDAOs are about co-ordination. But ones you are in the group, it’s impossible to keep track of everything.\\n\\nThere are so many members that one may not keep track of the announcements and may miss on some big ones.\\n\\nI think the problem is partly due to the user interface (which we can do nothing about) and partly due to the no. of members.\\n\\nI think one approach to tackle it can be tokens. Make a token-gated private discord group or invite-only groups.\\n\\nThis will not completely tackle the problem but may substantially reduce it as you will know that those who have joined have skin in the game or are great resource for the entire group.\\n\\nAlso, people are not in 1 or 2 discords but 100 other.\\n\\nFirst of all they don’t know the entire scenario and voting happens so often that they don’t have the knowledge and don’t take part in governance.\\n\\nAlso, Discord was not made with DAOs in mind. So, we have to look another alternative of it.\\n\\nThere are people trying to buidl platforms specifically for DAOs.\\n\\nBut I guess none are launched at the moment. But surely we will see some in the future.\\n\\nSome alternatives :\\n\\nThank you for reading.
