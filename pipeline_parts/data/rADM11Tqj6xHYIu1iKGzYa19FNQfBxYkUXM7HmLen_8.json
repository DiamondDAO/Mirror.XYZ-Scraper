"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The Columbus 5 upgrade is important for two main reasons.\\n\\nFirst, before the recent upgrade, LUNA that was burned to keep the UST peg with the dollar was sent to the community pool. Now, after the upgrade, the LUNA is permanently burned. Thus, it further decreases the supply of LUNA and could boost its value.\\n\\nSecond, and perhaps more importantly, the new upgrade integrated the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol of Cosmos. This means that the Terra blockchain is compatible with many [decentralized applications (DApps)](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/defi-decentralized-finance/) from the Cosmos ecosystem.\\n\\n**Key Things To Watch: The Value Of LUNA and New Projects**\\n\\nGiven the importance of the Columbus 5 upgrade to the Terra ecosystem, many projects have waited until its completion.\\n\\nProjects on Terra mainly launch on two platforms: Pylon and StarTerra.\\n\\nPylon allows users to gain exposure to projects launching on the platform by staking the native MINE token. StarTerra enables users to gain exposure to new projects by staking the STT token in a gamified system.\\n\\nOn [StarTerra](https://starterra.io/), projects like Orion Money and Loop Finance are preparing to launch following the Columbus 5 upgrade.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JHicON48KfeK04MprRXao.jpg?height=410&width=750)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638353807,\"title\":\"\\nPankaj Terra station information\"},\"digest\":\"ffw1yREIRF5dfzMz1OAEdtLBrgTuQqwAlLtyoOSONwg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6B164B2480861B3a8c2e9195094CA233A60cE950\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"T3OLvwntpcIE6-IDBxEoBBk1H4PxquQ3w8dtQCk5j8c\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MB9t4uEhZdjvEqT-Ip848U-JUHRfTL57hFAuGR5HSYA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"HsFg008Vohr_pExf-gJxNnkqiJuuuhrguuP2Jd_7d4REzhlwMCuXbTOILygD8elgW06MqRzErgoPYPb_tkCLUQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x850674a935586eaa14136cfac11ad2c5074826e9ecd0ab1479bc0a6e0044b4817e16565d9a1345395d2f4113629fcdd32c253e79c78091ce7c0bfde3d44faee81c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"T3OLvwntpcIE6-IDBxEoBBk1H4PxquQ3w8dtQCk5j8c\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MB9t4uEhZdjvEqT-Ip848U-JUHRfTL57hFAuGR5HSYA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ffw1yREIRF5dfzMz1OAEdtLBrgTuQqwAlLtyoOSONwg\"}"
