"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"It’s terrible. The onboarding across Web3 apps is incredibly bad. It’s understandable.\\n\\nThere’s a solution. \\n\\nThere is a way to create flows that explain any website or app on the web. Flows that anyone can follow and within which the explanations smoothly continue through an app, across apps, and even help complete entire processes.\\n\\nWe can’t force existing Web3 apps to make their onboarding simple but we can put a layer above it that explains the app to anyone and guides them through it.\\n\\nIdeally we’d need a ‘flow’ explanation with several options like “Explain it to me like I’m a 5 year old” at the lowest level and rising up to “Explain it to me like I’m a solidity developer”. Most people right now need the 5 year old explanation of Web3. I did.\\n\\nWe’re currently building this Web2 flows type app to help accelerate Web3. The vision statement being to ‘Accelerate progress’. It’s a win-win world. There’s no Malthusian trap. \\n\\nSteps\\n\\n1. Build the app. Iterate until it’s an app people love to use. Nothing less.\\n2. Issue an NFT to fund it, participate in it and own it.\\n3. Test flows across industries to look for hot streaks.\\n4. Bring focus to Web3.\\n5. Define ‘Accelerate progress’ aims. List critical mass numbers.\\n\\nThe underlying tech already built is insanely difficult to do but is done. It was initially built for another purpose. The surface levels flow tech has been prototyped. Now the real build has started.\",\"timestamp\":1636247960,\"title\":\"Web3 Onboarding Solution Coming\"},\"digest\":\"5rASXUii6QEShMze7lPdBUrw7ADzAwjegO5Ak_sZDJc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x04bf23985F9f57d3092381cA2f1239Cf2F2ef09f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jrTE0a4Fz-ZPTaOPaAYf4w4gVNXmSe6Gw93Sj1vdCKs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NBu4Mf0kKOTkKSPH8uRBsoLU49iQHL7tHrwic40WnWY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ZebWASgp2b6bVubLNv5AePld_4TC-FnVy5AopX6dfGu0X441p74wBqcOCA9korTQpj8BQraBr6Gd5CzMeEkZjA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xace00cde02d9a45acf4757c127413df4870203d2a1adb7643792c151245451eb4abf3be01f9eaabba9878c9f64721f153262cc527cc5604b5adb6f58524ece451c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jrTE0a4Fz-ZPTaOPaAYf4w4gVNXmSe6Gw93Sj1vdCKs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NBu4Mf0kKOTkKSPH8uRBsoLU49iQHL7tHrwic40WnWY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"5rASXUii6QEShMze7lPdBUrw7ADzAwjegO5Ak_sZDJc\"}"
