"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"o prolific of mistakes and confusion, about\\na century ago.\\n\\n\\\"English, as we have seen, is already the language of 600,000,000\\npeople, and the number is constantly increasing through its\\nadoption by the numerous races of India, where, even before the\\nclose of the last century, it was about as important as Latin\\nduring the greatness of Rome, and by the fact that the Spanish\\nand Portuguese elements in Mexico and Central and South America\\nshow a constant tendency to die out, much as the population of\\nSpain fell from 30,000,000 to 17,000,000 during the nineteenth\\ncentury.  As this goes on, in the Western hemisphere, the places\\nleft vacant are gradually filled by the more progressive\\nAnglo-Saxons, so that it looks as if the study of ethnology in\\nthe future would be very simple.\\n\\n\\\"The people with cultivation and leisure, whose number is\\nincreasing relatively to the population at each generation, spend\\nmuch more of their year in the country than formerly, where they\\nhave large and well-cultivated country seats, parts of which are\\nalso preserved for game.  This growing custom on the part of\\nsociety, in addition to being of great advantage to the\\nout-of-town districts, has done much to save the forests and\\npreserve some forms of game that would otherwise, like the\\nbuffalo, have become extinct.\\n\\n\\\"In astronomy we have also made tremendous strides.  The\\nold-fashioned double-convex lens used in telescopes became so\\nheavy as its size grew, that it bent perceptibly from its own\\nweight, when pointed at the zenith, distorting the vision; while\\nwhen it was used upon a star near the horizon, though the glass\\non edge kept its shape, there was too much atmosphere between it\\nand the observed object for successful study.  Our recent\\ntelescopes have, therefore, concave plate-glass mirrors, twenty\\nmetres in diameter, like those used for converging the sun's rays\\nin solar engines, but with curves more mathematically exact,\\nwhich collect an immense amount of light and focus it on a\\nsensitive plate or on the eye of the observer, whose back is\\nturned to the object he is studying.  An electrical field also\\nplays an important part, the electricity being as great an aid to\\nlight as in the telephone it is to sound.  With these placed\\ngenerally on high mountain peaks, beyond the reach of clouds, we\\nhave enormously increased the number of visible stars, though\\nthere are still probably boundless regions that we cannot see.\\nThese telescopes have several hundred times the power of the\\nlargest lenses of the nineteenth century, and apparently bring\\nMars and Jupiter, when in opposition, within one thousand and ten\\nthousand miles, respectively, so that we study their physical\\ngeography and topography; and we have good maps of Jupiter, and\\neven of Saturn, notwithstanding their distance and atmospheric\\nenvelopes, and we are able to see the disks of third-magnitude\\nstars.\\n\\n\\\"It seems as if, when we wish any particular discovery or\\ninvention, in whatever field, we had but to turn our efforts in\\nits direction to obtain our desire.  We seem, in fact, to have\\nawakened in the scenes of the Arabian Nights; yet the mysterious\\ngenius which we control, and which dims Aladdin's lamp, is the\\ngift of no fairy godmother sustained by the haze of dreams, but\\nshines as the child of science with fadeless and growing\\nsplendour, and may yet bring us and our little planet much closer\\nto God.\\n\\n\\\"We should indeed be happy, living as we do at this apex of\\nattained civilization, with the boundless possibilities of the\\nfuture unfolding before us, on the horizon of which we may fairly\\nbe said to stand.\\n\\n\\\"We are freed from the rattling granite pavement of only a\\ncentury ago, which made the occupant of an omnibus feel like a\\nfly inside of a drum; from the domination of our local politics\\nby ignorant foreigners; and from country roads that either filled\\nthe eyes, lungs, and hair of the unfortunates travelling upon\\nthem with dust, or, resembling ploughed and fertilized fields,\\nsaturated and plastered them with mud.  These miseries, together\\nwith sea-sickness in ocean travelling, are forever passed, and we\\nfeel that 'Excelsior!' is indeed our motto.  Our new and\\nincreasing sources of power have so stimulated production and\\nmanufacturing that poverty or want is scarcely known; while the\\ndevelopment of the popular demand, as a result of the supplied\\nneed, is so great that there is no visible limit to the\\ndiversification of industry or the possibilities of the arts.\\n\\n\\\"It may seem strange to some that apparently so disproportionate\\na number of inventions have been made in the last century.  There\\nare several reasons.  Since every discovery or advance in\\nknowledge increases our chance of obtaining more, it becomes\\ncumulative, and our progress is in geometric instead of\\narithmetical ratio.  Public interest and general appreciation of\\nthe value of time have also effectively assisted progress.  At\\nthe beginning of each year the President, the Governors of the\\nStates, and the Mayors of cities publish a prospectus of the\\ngreat improvements needed, contemplated, and under way within\\ntheir jurisdiction--it may be planning a new boulevard, a new\\npark, or an improved system of sewers; and at the year's end they\\nissue a resume of everything completed, and the progress in\\neverything else; and though there is usually a great difference\\nbetween the results hoped for and those attained, the effect is\\ngood.  The newspapers publish at length the recommendations of\\nthe Executives, and also the results obtained, and keep up public\\ninterest in all important matters.\\n\\n\\\"Free to delve in the allurement and fascination of science,\\nemancipated man goes on subduing Nature, as his Maker said he\\nshould, and turning her giant forces to his service in his\\nconstant struggle to rise and become more like Him who gave the\\ncommandments and showed him how he should go.\\n\\n\\\"Notwithstanding our strides in material progress,  we are not\\nentirely content.  As the requirements of the animal become fully\\nsupplied, we feel a need for something else.  Some say this is\\nlike a child that cries for the moon, but others believe it the\\nawakening and craving of our souls.  The historian narrates but\\nthe signs of the times, and strives to efface himself; yet there\\nis clearly a void, becoming yearly more apparent, which\\nmaterialism cannot fill.  Is it some new subtle force for which\\nwe sigh, or would we commune with spirits?  There is, so far as\\nwe can see, no limit to our journey, and I will add, in closing,\\nthat, with the exception of religion, we have most to hope from\\nscience.\\\"\\n\\n```\\n                       CHAPTER VI.\\n\\n                   FAR-REACHING PLANS.\\n```\\n\\nKnowing that the rectification of the earth's axis was\\nsatisfactorily begun, and that each year would show an increasing\\nimprovement in climate, many of the delegates, after hearing\\nBearwarden's speech, set out for their homes.  Those from the\\nvalley of the Amazon and the eastern coast of South America\\nboarded a lightning express that rushed them to Key West at the\\nrate of three hundred miles an hour.  The railroad had six\\ntracks, two for through passengers, two for locals, and two for\\nfreight.  There they took a \\\"water-spider,\\\" six hundred feet long\\nby three hundred in width, the deck of which was one hundred feet\\nabove the surface, which carried them over the water at the rate\\nof a mile a minute, around the eastern end of Cuba, through\\nWindward Passage, and so to the South American mainland, where\\nthey continued their journey by rail.\\n\\nThe Siberian and Russian delegates, who, of course, felt a keen\\ninterest in the company's proceedings, took a magnetic\\ndouble-ender car to Bering Strait.  It was eighteen feet high,\\none hundred and fifty feet long, and had two stories.  The upper,\\nwith a toughened glass dome running the entire length, descended\\nto within three feet of the floor, and afforded an unobstructed\\nview of the rushing scenery.  The rails on which it ran were ten\\nfeet apart, the wheels being beyond the sides, like those of a\\ncarriage, and fitted with ball bearings to ridged axles.  The\\ncar's flexibility allowed it to follow slight irregularities in\\nthe track, while the free, independent wheels gave it a great\\nadvantage in rounding curves over cars with wheels and axle in\\none casting, in which one must slip while traversing a greater or\\nsmaller arc than the other, except when the slope of the tread\\nand the centrifugal force happen to correspond exactly.  The fact\\nof having its supports outside instead of underneath, while\\nincreasing its stability, also enabled the lower floor to come\\nmuch nearer the ground, while still the wheels were large.\\nArriving in just twenty hours, they ran across on an electric\\nferry-boat, capable of carrying several dozen cars, to East Cape,\\nSiberia, and then, by running as far north as possible, had a\\nshort cut to Europe.\\n\\nThe Patagonians went by the all-rail Intercontinental Line,\\nwithout change of cars, making the run of ten thousand miles in\\nforty hours.  The Australians entered a flying machine, and were\\nsoon out of sight; while the Central Americans and members from\\nother States of the Union returned for the most part in their\\nmechanical phaetons.\\n\\n\\\"A prospective improvement in travelling,\\\" said Bearwarden, as he\\nand his friends watched the crowd disperse, \\\"will be when we can\\nrise beyond the limits of the atmosphere, wait till the earth\\nrevolves beneath us, and descend in twelve hours on the other\\nside.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"True,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"but then we can travel westward only,\\nand shall have to make a complete circuit when we wish to go\\neast.\\\"\\n\\nA few days later there was a knock at President Bearwarden's\\ndoor, while he was seated at his desk looking over some papers\\nand other matters.  Taking his foot from a partly opened desk\\ndrawer where it had been resting, he placed it upon the handle of\\na handsome brass-mounted bellows, which proved to be\\narticulating, for, as he pressed, it called lustily, \\\"Come in!\\\"\\nThe door opened, and in walked Secretary of State Stillman,\\nSecretary of the Navy Deepwaters, who was himself an old sailor,\\nDr. Cortlandt, Ayrault.  Vice-President Dumby, of the T. A. S.\\nCo., and two of the company's directors.\\n\\n\\\"Good-morning,\\\" said Bearwarden, as he shook hands with his\\nvisitors.  \\\"Charmed to see you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's a great invention,\\\" said Secretary Stillman, examining\\nthe bellows.  \\\"We must get Congress to make an appropriation for\\nits introduction in the department buildings in Washington.  You\\nhave no idea how it dries my throat to be all the time shouting,\\n'Come in!'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you know, Bearwarden,\\\" said Secretary Deepwaters, \\\"I'm afraid\\nwhen we have this millennium of climate every one will be so well\\nsatisfied that our friend here (pointing to Secretary Stillman\\nwith his thumb) will have nothing to do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have sometimes thought some of the excitement will be gone,\\nand the struggle of the 'survival of the fittest' will become\\nless problematical,\\\" said Bearwarden.\\n\\n\\\"The earth seems destined to have a calm old age,\\\" said\\nCortlandt, \\\"unless we can look to the Cabinet to prevent it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This world will soon be a dull place.  I wish we could leave it\\nfor a change,\\\" said Ayrault.  \\\"I don't mean forever, of course,\\nbut just as people have grown tired of remaining like plants in\\nthe places in which they grew.  Alan has been a caterpillar for\\nuntold ages; can he not become the butterfly?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Since we have found out how to straighten the axis,\\\" said\\nDeepwaters, \\\"might we not go one better, and improve the orbit as\\nwell?--increase the difference between aphelion and perihelion,\\nand give those that still like a changing climate a chance, while\\nincidentally we should see more of the world--I mean the solar\\nsystem--and, by enlarging the parallax, be able to measure the\\ndistance of a greater number of fixed stars.  Put your helm hard\\ndown and shout 'Hard-a-lee!'  You see, there is nothing simpler.\\nYou keep her off now, and six months hence you let her luff.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's an idea!\\\" said Bearwarden.  \\\"Our orbit could be enough\\nlike that of a comet to cross the orbits of both Venus and Mars;\\nand the climatic extremes would not be inconvenient.  The whole\\nearth being simultaneously warmed or cooled, there would be no\\nequinoctials or storms resulting from changes on one part of the\\nsurface from intense heat to intense cold; every part would have\\na twelve-hour day and night, and none would be turned towards or\\nfrom the sun for six months at a time; for, however eccentric the\\norbit, we should keep the axis absolutely straight.  At\\nperihelion there would simply be increased evaporation and clouds\\nnear the equator, which would shield those regions from the sun,\\nonly to disappear again as the earth receded.\\n\\n\\\"The only trouble,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"is that we should have no\\nfulcrum.  Straightening the axis is simple enough, for we have\\nthe attraction of the sun with which to work, and we have but to\\nincrease it at one end while decreasing it at the other, and\\nchange this as the poles change their inclination towards the\\nsun, to bring it about.  If a comet with a sufficiently large\\nhead would but come along and retard us, or opportunely give us a\\npull, or if we could increase the attraction of the other planets\\nfor us, or decrease it at times, it might be done.  If the force,\\nthe control of which was discovered too late to help us\\nstraighten the axis, could be applied on a sufficiently large\\nscale; if apergy----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have it!\\\" exclaimed Ayrault, jumping up.  \\\"Apergy will do it.\\nWe can build an airtight projectile, hermetically seal ourselves\\nwithin, and charge it in such a way that it will be repelled by\\nthe magnetism of the earth, and it will be forced from it with\\nequal or greater violence than that with which it is ordinarily\\nattracted.  I believe the earth has but the same relation to\\nspace that the individual molecule has to any solid, liquid, or\\ngaseous matter we know; and that, just as molecules strive to fly\\napart on the application of heat, this earth will repel that\\nprojectile when electricity, which we are coming to look upon as\\nanother form of heat, is properly applied.  It must be so, and it\\nis the manifest destiny of the race to improve it.  Man is a\\nspirit cursed with a mortal body, which glues him to the earth,\\nand his yearning to rise, which is innate, is, I believe, only a\\npart of his probation and trial.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Show us how it can be done,\\\" shouted his listeners in chorus.\\n\\n\\\"Apergy is and must be able to do it,\\\" Ayrault continued.\\n\\\"Throughout Nature we find a system of compensation.  The\\ncentripetal force is offset by the centrifugal; and when,\\naccording to the fable, the crystal complained of its hard lot in\\nbeing unable to move, while the eagle could soar through the\\nupper air and see all the glories of the world, the bird replied,\\n'My life is but for a moment, while you, set in the rock, will\\nlive forever, and will see the last sunrise that flashes upon the\\nearth.'\\n\\n\\\"We know that Christ, while walking on the waves, did not sink,\\nand that he and Elijah were carried up into heaven.  What became\\nof their material bodies we cannot  tell, but they were certainly\\nsuperior to the force of gravitation.  We have no reason to\\nbelieve that in miracles any natural law was broken, or even set\\naside, but simply that some other law, whose workings we do not\\nunderstand, became operative and modified the law that otherwise\\nwould have had things its own way.  In apergy we undoubtedly have\\nthe counterpart of gravitation, which must exist, or Nature's\\nsystem of compensation is broken.  May we not believe that in\\nChrist's transfiguration on the mount, and in the appearance of\\nMoses and Elias with him--doubtless in the flesh, since otherwise\\nmortal eyes could not have seen them--apergy came into play and\\nupheld them; that otherwise, and if no other modification had\\nintervened, they would have fallen to the ground; and that apergy\\nwas, in other words, the working principle of those miracles?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"May we not also believe,\\\" added Cortlandt, \\\"that in the\\ntransfiguration Christ's companions took the substance of their\\nmaterial bodies--the oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon--from\\nthe air and the moisture it contained; for, though spiritual\\nbodies, be their activity magnetic or any other, could of course\\npass the absolute cold and void of space without being affected,\\nno mortal body could; and that in the same manner Elijah's body\\ndissolved into air without the usual intervention of\\ndecomposition; for we know that, though matter can easily change\\nits form, it can never be destroyed.\\\"\\n\\nAll assented to this, and Ayrault continued:  \\\"If apergy can\\nannul gravitation, I do not see why it should not do more, for to\\nannul it the repulsion of the earth that it produces must be as\\ngreat as its attraction, unless we suppose gravitation for the\\ntime being to be suspended; but whether it is or not, does not\\naffect the result in this case, for, after the apergetic\\nrepulsion is brought to the degree at which a body does not fall,\\nany increase in the current's strength will cause it to rise, and\\nin the case of electro-magnets we know that the attraction or\\nrepulsion has practically no limit.  This will be of great\\nadvantage to us,\\\" he continued, \\\"for if a projectile could move\\naway from the earth with no more rapid acceleration than that\\nwith which it approaches, it would take too long to reach the\\nnearest planet, but the maximum repulsion being at the start by\\nreason of its proximity to the earth--for apergy, being the\\ncounterpart of gravitation, is subject to Newton's and Kepler's\\nlaws--the acceleration of a body apergetically charged will be\\ngreatest at first.  Two inclined planes may have the same fall,\\nbut a ball will reach the bottom of one that is steepest near the\\ntop in less time than on any other, because the maximum\\nacceleration is at the start.  We are all tired of being stuck to\\nthis cosmical speck, with its monotonous ocean, leaden sky, and\\nsingle moon that is useless more than half the time, while its\\nsize is so microscopic compared with the universe that we can\\ntraverse its great circle in four days.  Its possibilities are\\nexhausted; and just as Greece became too small for the\\ncivilization of the Greeks, and as reproduction is growth beyond\\nthe individual, so it seems to me that the future glory of the\\nhuman race lies in exploring at least the solar system, without\\nwaiting to become shades.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Should you propose to go to Mars or Venus?\\\" asked Cortlandt.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" replied Ayrault, \\\"we know all about Mars; it is but one\\nseventh the size of the earth, and as the axis is inclined more\\nthan ours, it would be a less comfortable globe than this; while,\\nas our president here told us in his T. A. S. Company's report,\\nthe axis of Venus is inclined to such a degree that it would be\\nalmost uninhabitable for us.  It would be as if colonists tried\\nto settle Greenland, or had come to North America during its\\nGlacial period.  Neither Venus nor Mars would be a good place\\nnow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where should you propose to go?\\\" asked Stillman.\\n\\n\\\"To Jupiter, and, if possible, after that to Saturn,\\\" replied\\nAyrault; \\\"the former's mean distance from the sun is 480,000,000\\nmiles; but, as our president showed us, its axis is so nearly\\nstraight that I think, with its internal warmth, there will be\\nnothing to fear from cold.  Though, on account of the planet's\\nvast size, objects on its surface weigh more than twice as much\\nas here, if I am able to reach it by means of apergy, the same\\nforce will enable me to regulate my weight.  Will any one go with\\nme?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Splendid!\\\" said Bearwarden.  \\\"If Mr. Dumby, our vice-president,\\nwill temporarily assume my office, nothing will give me greater\\npleasure.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So will I go, if there is room for me,\\\" said Cortlandt.  \\\"I will\\nat once resign my place as Government expert, and consider it the\\ngrandest event of my life.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If I were not afraid of leaving Stillman here to his own\\ndevices, I'd ask for a berth as well,\\\" said Deepwaters.\\n\\n\\\"I am afraid,\\\" said Stillman, \\\"if you take any more, you will be\\novercrowded.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Modesty forbids his saying,\\\" said Deepwaters, \\\"that it wouldn't\\ndo for the country to have all its eggs in one basket.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are you not afraid you will find the surface hot, or even\\nmolten?\\\" asked Vice-President Dumby.  \\\"With its eighty-six\\nthousand five hundred mile diameter, the amount of original\\ninternal heat must have been terrific.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, said Cortlandt, \\\"it cannot be molten, or even in the least\\ndegree luminous, for, if it were, its satellites would be visible\\nwhen they enter its shadow, whereas they entirely disappear.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do not believe Jupiter's surface is even perceptibly warm,\\\"\\nsaid Bearwarden.  \\\"We know that Algol, known to the ancients as\\nthe 'Demon Star,' and several other variable stars, are\\naccompanied by a dark companion, with which they revolve about a\\ncommon centre, and which periodically obscures part of their\\nlight.  Now, some of these non-luminaries are nearly as large as\\nour sun, and, of course, many hundred times the size of Jupiter.\\nIf these bodies have lost enough heat to be invisible, Jupiter's\\nsurface at least must be nearly cold.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In the phosphorescence of seawater,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"and in\\nother instances in Nature, we find light without heat, and we may\\nsoon be able to produce it in the arts by oxidizing coal without\\nthe intervention of the steam engine; but we never find any\\nconsiderable heat without light.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am convinced,\\\" said Bearwarden, \\\"that we shall find Jupiter\\nhabitable for intelligent beings who have been developed on a\\nmore advanced sphere than itself, though I do not believe it has\\nprogressed far enough in its evolution to produce them.  I expect\\nto find it in its Palaeozoic or Mesozoic period, while over a\\nhundred years ago the English astronomer, Chambers, thought that\\non Saturn there was good reason for suspecting the presence of\\nsnow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What sort of spaceship do you propose to have?\\\" asked the\\nvice-president.\\n\\n\\\"As you have to pass through but little air,\\\" said Deepwaters, \\\"I\\nshould suggest a short-stroke cylinder of large diameter, with a\\nflat base and dome roof, composed of aluminum, or, still better,\\nof glucinum or beryllium as it is sometimes called, which is\\ntwice as good a conductor of electricity as aluminum, four times\\nas strong, and is the lightest of all known metals, having a\\nspecific gravity of only two, which last property will be of\\ngreat use to you, for of course the more weight you have to\\npropel the more apergetic repulsion you will have to develop.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will get some drawing-paper I left outside in my trap,\\\" said\\nAyrault, \\\"when with your ideas we may arrive at something\\ndefinite,\\\" saying which, he left the room.\\n\\n\\\"He seems very cynical in his ideas of life and the world in\\ngeneral,\\\" said Secretary Stillman, \\\"for a man of his age, and one\\nthat is engaged.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You see,\\\" replied Bearwarden, \\\"his fiancee is not yet a senior,\\nbeing in the class of two thousand and one at Vassar, and so\\ncannot marry him for a year.  Not till next June can this sweet\\ngirl graduate come forth with her mortar-board and sheepskin to\\nenlighten the world and make him happy.  That is, I suspect, one\\nreason why he proposed this trip.\\\"\\n\\n```\\n                      CHAPTER VII.\\n\\n                      HARD AT WORK.\\n```\\n\\nIn a few moments Ayrault returned with pencils, a pair of\\ncompasses, and paper.\\n\\n\\\"Let us see, in the first place,\\\" said Deepwaters, \\\"how long the\\njourney will take.  Since a stone falls 16.09 feet the first\\nsecond, and 64+ feet the next, it is easy to calculate at what\\nrate your speed would increase with the repulsion twice that of\\nthe ordinary traction.  But I think this would be too slow.  It\\nwill be best to treble or quadruple the apergetic charge, which\\ncan easily be done, in which case your speed will exceed the\\nmuzzle-velocity of a projectile from a long-range gun, in a few\\nseconds.  As the earth's repulsion decreases, the attraction of\\nmars and Jupiter will increase, and, there being no resistance,\\nyour gait will become more and more rapid till it is necessary to\\nreverse the charge to avoid being dashed to pieces or being\\nconsumed like a falling star by the friction in passing through\\nJupiter's atmosphere.  You can be on the safe side by checking\\nyour speed in advance.  You must, of course, be careful to avoid\\ncollisions with meteors and asteroids but if you do, they will be\\nof use to you, for by attracting or repelling them you can change\\nyour course to suit yourself, and also theirs in inverse ratio to\\ntheir masses.  Jupiter's moons will be like head and stern lines\\nin enabling you to choose the part of the surface on which you\\nwish to land.  With apergy it is as essential to have some heavy\\nbody on which to work, within range, as to have water about a\\nship's propellers.  Whether, when apergy is developed,\\ngravitation is temporarily annulled, or reversed like the late\\nattraction of a magnet when the current is changed, or whether it\\nis merely overpowered, in which case your motion will be the\\nresultant of the two, is an unsettled and not very important\\npoint; for, though we know but little more of the nature of\\nelectricity than was known a hundred years ago, this does not\\nprevent our producing and using it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Jupiter, when in opposition,\\\" he continued, \\\"is about\\n380,000,000 miles from us, and it takes light, which travels at\\nthe rate of 190,000 miles a second, just thirty-four minutes to\\nreach the earth from Jupiter.  If we suppose the average speed of\\nyour ship to be one- five-hundredth as great, it will take you\\njust eleven days, nineteen hours and twenty minutes to make the\\njourney.  You will have a fine view of Mars and the asteroids,\\nand when 1,169,000 miles from Jupiter, will cross the orbit of\\nCallisto, the fifth moon in distance from the giant planet.  That\\nwill be your best point to steer by.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think,\\\" said Ayrault, \\\"as that will be the first member of\\nJupiter's system we pass, and as it will guide us into port, it\\nwould be a good name for our ship, and you must christen her if\\nwe have her launched.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, no,\\\" said Deepwaters, \\\"Miss Preston must do that; but we\\ncertainly should have a launch, for you might have to land in the\\nwater, and you must be sure the ship is tight.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Talking of tight ships,\\\" said Bearwarden, passing a decanter of\\nclaret to Stillman, \\\"may remind us that it is time to splice the\\n'main brace.'  There's a bottle of whisky and some water just\\nbehind you,\\\" he added to Deepwaters, \\\"while three minutes after I\\nring this bell,\\\" he said, pressing a button and jerking a handle\\nmarked '8,' \\\"the champagne cocktails will be on the desk.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I see you know his ways,\\\" said Stillman to Bearwarden, drooping\\nhis eyes in Deepwaters's direction.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes, I've been here before,\\\" replied Deepwaters.  \\\"You see,\\nwe navy men have to hustle now-a-days, and can't pass our time in\\na high-backed chair, talking platitudes.\\\"\\n\\nAt this moment there was a slight rumbling, and eight champagne\\ncocktails, with the froth still on, and straws on a separate\\nplate, shot in and landed on a corner of the desk.\\n\\n\\\"Help yourselves, gentlemen,\\\" said Bearwarden, placing them on a\\ntable; \\\"I hope we shall find them cold.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1636791491,\"title\":\"\\\"The metric system, now universal, superseded the old\"},\"digest\":\"4Zre5q2V0TWadYovhCYvkFR4Ki-EDiXME_wshPBRXOI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7f94dec1e4822ed495baC7236249BE901ae350ff\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ckHZCw2wswfQ-8-4bsSNf6icEta_FMB_YW0Aah3FiIc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0srOGQgzlLpbW_fDniFAXRA10u5xKtcE0XGjGu4DFKE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"mXnZi7-E12988MqSYVsmDQ_Ul3xFGA-SIAso77E4NpItMASRK33S-d0lRk1Bz3ipEo5UtWoHIcOV0dzEAaRukw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x45a7b7aee71e3ba25218f631b12dfe297a3a6f605e77f12145b76c6f444af1f934b6a1d3981b46b6205b0c335c1b396aafe1278d439c7edc0e4f84138c2c1bf41b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ckHZCw2wswfQ-8-4bsSNf6icEta_FMB_YW0Aah3FiIc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0srOGQgzlLpbW_fDniFAXRA10u5xKtcE0XGjGu4DFKE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"4Zre5q2V0TWadYovhCYvkFR4Ki-EDiXME_wshPBRXOI\"}"
