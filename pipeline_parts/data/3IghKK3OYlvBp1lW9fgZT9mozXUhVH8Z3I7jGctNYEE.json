Through this cooperation, we can expand WePiggy’s influence to a larger user base. If $CHE gets listed on WePiggy, that will empower $CHE token lending feature. Token holders of $CHE can enjoy the powerful and secure application of WePiggy. \\\\****”***\\n\\n**– Ron, Zheng, Founder and CEO of WePiggy**\\n\\n## About WePiggy\\n\\nWePiggy is an open-source, non-custodial, crypto asset lending market protocol.
