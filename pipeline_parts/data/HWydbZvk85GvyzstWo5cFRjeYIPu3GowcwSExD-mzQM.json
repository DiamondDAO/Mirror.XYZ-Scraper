"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"though at a retarded pace.  The weekly payments we're regularly made, and I was kept in a sort of financial ease.  After three months the rotary engine was finished to the inventor's complete satisfaction.  But when the power it gave out was compared with that of a good ordinary steam-engine, the verdict as to consumption of fuel was against the new rotary engine.  Nevertheless, the enthusiastic projector, \\\"tho' vanquished he would argue still,\\\" insisted that the merits of his contrivance would sooner or later cause it to be a most formidable rival to the crank steam-engines.  As he was pleased with its performances, I had no reason to be dissatisfied.  I had done my part in the matter, and Mr. Steen had done his.  His punctual weekly payments had assisted me in the completion of my tools; and after a few months more labour I had everything ready for starting business on my own account.\\n\\nMy choice lay between Liverpool and Manchester.  I had seen both of these cities while on my visit to Lancashire to witness the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.  I now proceeded to visit them again.  I was fortified with valuable introductions to leading men in both places.  I was received by them with great kindness and hospitality.  I have heard a great deal about the ingratitude and selfishness of the world.  It may have been my good fortune, but I have never experienced either of those unfeeling conditions.  On the whole I have found a great deal of unselfish kindness among my fellow-beings. They have often turned out of their way to do me a service; and I can never be too grateful for the unwearied kindness, civility, and generosity of the friends I met with during my stay in Lancashire.\\n\\nIt was a question which would be the best place to settle in-- Liverpool or Manchester.  I had seen striking evidences of the natural aptitude of Lancashire workmen for every sort of mechanical employment, and had observed their unsparing energy while at work.  I compared them with the workmen whom I had seen in London, and found them superior. They were men of greater energy of character; their minds were more capacious; their ingenuity was more inventive.  I felt assured that in either Liverpool or Manchester--the centres of commercial and manipulative energy--I could settle down with my limited capital and tools, and in course of time contrive to get on, helped by energy, self-reliance, and determination.  I also found that the demand for machine-making tools was considerable, and that their production would soon become an important department of business.  It might be carried on with little expenditure of capital, as the risks were small and the returns were quick.  I resolved to cultivate that moderate and safe class of mechanical business, at all events at the outset.\\n\\nI first went to Liverpool.  I presented my letter of introduction to Mr. Roscoe, head of the Mersey Steel and Iron Company.  He received me with great kindness, and gave me much good advice.  I called upon Edward Berry, engineer, and also upon William Fawcett, who had received me with so much kindness on my former visit.  I cannot omit mentioning also the friendly reception which I received from Dr. Sillar. He had been a medical student at Edinburgh, and had during that time met with some kindness from my father.  He expressed his remembrance of it with grateful effusion; and added his personal introduction, with that of my letters, to some of the leading men in Liverpool.  I may mention that Dr. Sillar was the son of Burns's \\\"Brother Poet\\\" Davie, to whom the well-known \\\"Epistle\\\" was addressed.\\n\\nAmong the other well-known men to whom I was introduced at Liverpool was John Cragg, an intelligent and enterprising ironfounder.  He was an extensive manufacturer of the large sugar-boiling pans used in the West Indies.  He had also given his attention to the introduction of iron into buildings of different sorts.  Being a man of artistic taste he had even introduced cast-iron into Gothic architecture.  In order to exhibit, in an impressive form, the uses of his favourite metal, he erected at his own cost a very elegant church in the northern part of Liverpool.\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... So far as I can recollect, the name of the church was St. James's. It exhibited a very early introduction of iron as an important element in architectural construction.  Iron was afterwards largely introduced into mills, mill gearing, and buildings generally.  ...\\\\]\\n\\nCast-iron was introduced, not only in the material parts of the structure, but into the Gothic columns and Gothic tracery of the windows, as well as into the lofty and elegant spire.  Iron was also employed in the external ornamental details, where delicate yet effective decoration was desirable.  The famous architect, Edward Blore, was the designer of the church; and the whole details of the building--of which cast-iron formed the principal material-- were executed to his entire satisfaction\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... So far as I can recollect, the name of the church was St. James's. It exhibited a very early introduction of iron as an important element in architectural construction.  Iron was afterwards largely introduced into mills, mill gearing, and buildings generally.  ...\\\\]\\n\\nMy introduction to Mr. Cragg led to an acquaintance, and then to a friendship.  When the ice was broken which was very soon--he told me that he was desirous of retiring from the more active part of his business.  Whether he liked my looks or not I do not know; but, quite unexpectedly, he made me a very tempting offer to enter his works as his successor.  He had already amassed a fortune, and I might do the same.  I could only thank him most sincerely for his kindness. But, on carefully thinking the matter over, I declined the proposal. My principal reason was, that the special nature of his foundry work did not quite harmonise with my desire to follow the more strictly mechanical part of the iron business.  Besides, I thought I had a brighter prospect of success before me; though I knew that I had many difficulties to contend against.  Did I throw away my chances in declining the liberal proposal of Mr. Cragg?  The reader will be able to judge from the following pages.  But to the last\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... Mr. Cragg died in 1853, aged 84.  ...\\\\]                                                                                               I continued a most friendly intercourse with my intended patron, while he on his part took an almost paternal interest in my progress.\\n\\nAfter my visit to Liverpool I passed on to Manchester. I was fortunate in having introductions to some of the leading men there,--to John Kennedy, William Fairbairn, the Grant Brothers, and lastly, to that most admirable man, Benjamin Hick, engineer, Bolton. To narrate in detail all the instances of warm and hospitable kindnesses which I received from men in Lancashire, even from the outset of my career there, would fill a volume.\\n\\nI first went to see my friend Edward Tootal, who had given me so kind a reception in 1830.  I was again cordially received; he now promised to befriend me, which he did most effectually.  I next visited John Chippendale, of the firm of Thomson, Chippendale, and Company, calico printers.  I had met him at a friend's house in London, where he had offered, if I ever visited Manchester, to introduce me to some of the best men there.  I accordingly called upon him at his counting-house. It happened to be Tuesday, the market day, when all the heads of manufacturing establishments in and round Manchester met together at the Exchange between 12 and 1; and thus all were brought to a focus in a very convenient manner.\\n\\nMr. Chippendale first introduced me to Mr. John Kennedy, one of the most distinguished men in Manchester.  I had a special letter of introduction to him from Buchanan of Catrine, and his partner Smith of Deanstone.  I explained to him the object of my visit to Manchester, and he cordially entered into my views.  He left his occupation at the time, and went with me to see a place which he thought might be suitable for my workshop.  The building was new at hand--in Dale Street, Piccadilly.  It had been used as a cotton mill, but was abandoned by the owner in favour of more suitable and extensive premises.  It was now let out in flats for manufacturing purposes. Power was supplied to each flat from a shaft connected with a large mill up the street, the owner of which had power to spare. The flat shown to me was 130 feet long by 27 feet wide, and the rent was only #50 a year.  I thought the premises very suitable, but I took a night to sleep over it.  I thanked Mr. Kennedy very much for his kindness, and for the trouble which he had taken on behalf of an unknown stranger.\\n\\nOn this memorable day I had another introduction, through the kindness of Mr. Chippendale, which proved of great service to me.  It was to the Messrs. Grant, the famous \\\"Brothers Cheeryble\\\" of Dickens. I was taken to their counting-house in Cannon Street, where I was introduced to Daniel Grant.  Although business was at its full height, he gave me a cordial reception.  But, to save time, he invited me to come after the Exchange was over and take \\\"tiffin\\\" with him at his hospitable mansion in Mosely Street.\\n\\nThere, he said, I should meet some of the most enterprising men in Lancashire.  I was most happy, of course, to avail myself of his invitation.  I went thither accordingly, and the first thing that Daniel did was to present me in the most cordial manner to \\\"his noble brother William,\\\" as he always affectionately called him.  William was the head of the firm, and he, too, gave me a warm and hearty welcome. He asked me to sit beside him at the head of the table.\\n\\nDuring dinner--for indeed it was such, being the survival of the old-fashioned one o'clock dinner of a departing age--William entered into conversation with me.  He took occasion to inquire into the object of my visit to Manchester.  I told him, as briefly as I could, that I intended to begin the business of a mechanical engineer on a very moderate scale, and that I had been looking out for premises wherein to commence operations.  He seemed interested, and asked more questions.  I related to him my little history, and told him of my desires, hopes, and aspirations.  What was my age?  \\\"Twenty-six.\\\" \\\"That is a very young age at which to begin business on your own account\\\" \\\"Yes; but I have plenty of work in me, and I am very economical.\\\" Then he pressed his questions home.  \\\"But what is your capital?\\\" I told him that my capital in cash was #63.  \\\"What!\\\" he said, \\\"that will do very little for you when Saturday nights come round.\\\" \\\"That's true,\\\" I answered; \\\"but as there will be only myself and Archy Torry to provide for, I think I can manage to get along very well until profitable work comes in.\\\"\\n\\nHe whispered to me, \\\"Keep your heart up!\\\"  With such views, he said, I was sure to do well.  And if, he added, on any Saturday night I wanted money to pay wages or other expenses, I would find a credit for #500 at 3 per cent at his office in Cannon Street, \\\"and no security.\\\" These were his very words.  What could have been more generous? I could only whisper my earnest thanks for his warm-hearted kindness. He gave me a kindly squeeze of the hand in return, which set me in a glow of gladness.  He also gave me a sort of wink that I shall never forget--a most knowing wink.  In looking at me he seemed to turn his eye round and brought his eyebrows down upon it in a sudden and extraordinary manner.  I thought it was a mere confirmation of his kind advice to \\\"keep my heart up!\\\"  It was not until two years after that I found, from a mutual friend, that the eye in question was made of glass!  Sometimes the glass eye got slightly out of its place, and Mr. Grant had to force it in again by this odd contortion of his eyebrows, which I had translated into all manner of kind intentions. As soon as the party broke up I went to Wren and Bennett, the agents for the flat of the old mill which I had seen in Dale Street. I inspected it again, and found that it was in all respects suitable for my purpose.  I may mention in passing that the flat below mine was in the occupation of a glass-cutter, whose glass-cutting lathes and grindstones were supplied with power from the same upright shaft that was to serve me in the same manner on the flat above, Encouraged by the support of William Grant, I immediately entered into a contract for the premises as a yearly tenant.  Nothing could have been more happily arranged for my entering into business as a mechanical engineer and machine tool maker.  The situation of the premises was excellent, being in the heart of Manchester There was a powerful crab crane, or hoisting apparatus, in the upper story, and the main chains came down in front of the wide door of my workshop, so that heavy castings or cases of machinery might be lifted up or let down with the utmost case and convenience.  At the same time I was relieved from looking after the moving power and its natural accompaniment of trouble and expense in the way of fuel and attendance.\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  My factory flat at Manchester\\n\\nWhen I had settled the contract for taking the place, I wrote down to Edinburgh by that night's post to tell my father of the happy results of my visit to Manchester, and also to inform my right hand man, Archy Torry, that I should soon be with him.  He was to prepare for packing up my lathes, planing machines, drilling machines, and other smaller tools, not forgetting my father's foot lathe, of which I had made such effective use.\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... I have still this foot-lathe in full and perfect and almost daily action.  I continue to work with it now, after sixty-three years of almost constant use.  It is a lathe that I duly prize and venerate, not only because it was my father's, but also because it was, in practical fact, the progenitor, more or less directly, of all the mechanical productions of my long and active life.  ...\\\\]\\n\\nI soon followed up my letter.  I was in Edinburgh in a few days' time, and had all my tools packed up.  In the course of about ten days I returned to Manchester, and was followed by Archy Torry and the ponderous cases of machinery and engineer's tools.  They were all duly delivered, hoisted to my flat, and put in their proper places. I was then ready for work.\\n\\nThe very first order I received was from my friend Edward Tootal. It was a new metallic piston for the small steam-engine that gave motion to his silk-winding machinery.  It was necessary that it should be done over night, in order that his factory should be at work as usual in the morning.\\n\\nMy faithful Archy and I set to work accordingly.  We removed the old defective piston, and replaced it by a new and improved one, made according to my own ideas of how so important a part of a steam-engine should be constructed.  We conveyed it to Mr. Tootal's factory over night, and by five o'clock in the morning gave it a preliminary trial to see that everything was in order.  The \\\"hands\\\" came in at six, and the machine was set to work.  It was no doubt a very small order, but the piston was executed perfectly and satisfactorily.  The result of its easier action, through reduced friction, was soon observable in the smaller consumption of coal.  Mr. Tootal and his brother were highly pleased at my prompt and careful attention to their little order, and it was the forerunner of better things to come.\\n\\nOrders soon came in.  My planing machine was soon fully occupied. When not engaged in executing other work it was employed in planing the flat cast-iron inking tables for printing machines.  These were made in considerable numbers by Messrs.  Wren and Bennett (my landlords) under the personal superintendence of Ebenezer Cowper, brother of the inventor, who, in conjunction with Mr. Applegath, was the first to produce a really effective newspaper printing machine.  I had many small subsidiary jobs sent to me to execute.  They not only served to keep my machine tools properly employed, but tended in the most effective way to make my work known to some of the best firms in Manchester, who in course of time became my employers.\\n\\nIn order to keep pace with the influx of work I had to take on fresh hands.  I established a smithy down in the cellar flat of the old mill in Dale Street, so that all forge work in iron and steel might be promptly and economically produced on the premises.  There was a small iron foundry belonging to a Mr. Heath, about three minutes walk from my workshop, where I had all my castings of iron and brass done with promptness, and of excellent quality.  Mr. Heath very much wanted a more powerful steam-engine to drive his cupola blowing fan.  I had made a steam-engine in Edinburgh and brought it with me.  There it lay in my workshop, where it remained unused, for I was sufficiently supplied with power from the rotating shaft.  Mr. Heath offered to buy it. The engine was accordingly removed to his iron foundry, and I received my full quota of value in castings.\\n\\nWeek by week my orders grew, and the flat of the old mill soon assumed a very busy aspect.  By occasionally adding to the number of my lathes, drilling machines, and other engineers' tools, I attracted the attention of employers.  When seen in action they not only facilitated and economised the production of my own work, but became my best advertisements.  Each new tool that I constructed had some feature of novelty about it.  I always endeavoured after greater simplicity and perfectness of workmanship.  I was punctual in all my engagements. The business proved safe and profitable.  The returns were quick. Sometimes one-third of the money was paid in advance on receipt of the order, and the balance was paid on delivery at my own premises. All risk of bad debts was avoided.  Thus I was enabled to carry on my business with a very moderate amount of capital.\\n\\nMy crowded workshop and the active scene it presented, together with the satisfaction my work gave to my employers, induced several persons to offer to enter into partnership with me.  Sometimes it was on their own account, or for a son or relation for whom they desired an opening. But I fought shy of such proposals.  It was a very riskful affair to admit as partners young men whose character for ability might be very doubtful.  I was therefore satisfied to go on as before. Besides, I had the kind and disinterested offer of the Brothers Grant, which was always available, though, indeed, I did not need to make use of it. I had also the good fortune to be honoured by the friendship of Edward Lloyd, the head of the firm of Jones, Lloyd, and Co.  I had some moderate financial transactions with the bank.  Mr. Lloyd had, no doubt, heard something of my industry and economy.  I never asked him for any accommodation; but on one occasion he invited me into his parlour, not to sweat me, but to give me some most kindly hints and advice as to the conduct of my financial affairs.  He volunteered an offer which I could not but feel proud of.  He said that I should have a credit of #1000 at my service, at the usual bank rate.  He added, \\\"As soon as you can, lay by a little capital of your own, and baste it with its own gravy!\\\"  A receipt which I have carefully followed through life, and I am thankful to say with satisfactory results.\\n\\nBefore I conclude this chapter, let me add something more about my kind friends the Brothers Grant.  It is well that their history should be remembered, as the men who personally knew them will soon be all dead. The three brothers, William, Daniel, and John Grant, were the sons of a herdsman or cattle-dealer, whose occupation consisted in driving cattle from the far north of Scotland to the rich pastures of Cheshire and Lancashire.  The father was generally accompanied by his three sons, who marched barefoot, as was the custom of the north country lads in those days.  Being shrewd fellows, they observed with interest the thriving looks and well-fed condition of the Lancashire folks. They were attracted by the print works and cotton mills which lay by the Irwell, as it crept along in its bright and rural valley towards Manchester.  When passing the works of Sir Robert Peel at Nuttal, near Bury, they admired the beauty of the situation.  The thought possessed them that they would like to obtain some employment in the neighbourhood. They went together in search of a situation.  It is said that when they reached the crown of the hill near Walmsley, from which a beautiful prospect is to be seen, they were in doubt as to the line of road which they should pursue.  To decide their course, a stick was put up, and they agreed to follow the direction in which it should fall. The stick fell in the direction of Ramsbottom, then a little village in the bottom of the valley, on the river Irwell.  There they went, and found employment.\\n\\nThey were thrifty, economical, and hard-working; and they soon saved money.  Their savings became capital, and they invested it in a little print work.  Their capital grew, and they went on investing it in print works and cotton mills.\\n\\nThey became great capitalists and manufacturers; and by their industry, ability, and integrity, were regarded as among the best men in Lancashire.  As a memorial of the event which enabled them to take up their happy home at Ramsbottom, they caused to be erected at the top of Walmsley Hill a lofty tower, overlooking the valley, as a kind of public thank-offering for the prosperity and success which they had achieved in their new home.  Their well-directed diligence made the valley teem with industry, activity, health, joy, and opulence. They never forgot the working class from which they had sprung, and as their labours had contributed to their wealth, they spared no expense in providing for the moral, intellectual, and physical interests of their work-people.  Whenever a worthy object was to be achieved, the Brothers Grant were always ready with their hearty and substantial help. They contributed to found schools, churches, and public buildings, and many a deserving man did they aid with their magnanimous bounty.\\n\\nI may also mention that they never forgot their first impression of the splendid position of the first Sir Robert Peel's works at Nuttal. In course of time Sir Robert had, by his skill and enterprise, acquired a large fortune, and desired to retire from business.  By this time the Grant Brothers had succeeded so well that they were enabled to purchase the whole of his works and property in the neighbourhood. They proceeded to introduce every improvement in the way of machinery and calico printing, and thus greatly added to the quality of their productions.  Their name became associated with everything that was admirable.  They abounded in hospitality and generosity. In the course of many long years of industry, enterprise, and benevolence, they earned the goodwill of thousands, the gratitude of many, and the respect of all who knew them.  I was only one of many who had cause to remember them with gratefulness.  How could I acknowledge their kindness?  There was one way; it was a very small way, but I will relate it.   Soon after my introduction to the Grants, and before I had brought my tools to Manchester, William invited me to join a gathering of his friends at Ramsbottom.  The church built at his cost had just been finished, and it was to be opened with great eclat on the following Sunday.  He asked me to be his guest, and I accepted his invitation with pleasure.  As it was a very fine day at the end of May, I walked out to Ramsbottom, and enjoyed the scenery of the district. Here was the scene of the Grant Brothers' industry and prosperity. I met many enterprising and intelligent men, to whom William Grant introduced me.  I was greatly pleased with the ceremonies connected with the opening of the church.\\n\\nOn the Monday morning William Grant, having seen some specimens of my father's artistic skill as a landscape painter, requested me to convey to him his desire that he should paint two pictures--one of Castle Grant, the residence of the chief of the Clan Grant, and the other of Elgin Cathedral.  These places were intimately associated with his early recollections, The brothers had been born in the village adjoining Castle Grant; and Elgin Cathedral was one of the principal old buildings of the north.  My father replied, saying that he would be delighted to execute the pictures for a gentleman who had given me so kindly a reception, but that he had no authentic data--no drawings, no engravings--from which to paint them; and that he was now too old to visit the places.  I therefore resolved to do what I could to help him to paint the pictures.\\n\\nAs it was necessary that I should go to London before returning to Edinburgh to pack up my machine tools there, I went thither, and after doing my business, I embarked for Dundee by the usual steamer. I made my way from there, via Perth and Dunkeld, to Inverness, and from thence I proceeded to Elgin.  I made most careful drawings of the remains of that noble cathedral.  I endeavoured to include all that was most beautiful in the building and its surrounding scenery. I then went on to Castle Grant, through a picturesque and romantic country.  I found the castle amidst its deep forests of pine, larch, elm, and chestnut.  The building consists of a high quadrangular pile of many stories, projecting backwards at each end, and pierced with windows of all shapes and sizes.  I did my best to carry away a graphic sketch of the old castle and its surroundings:  and then, with my stock of drawings, I prepared to return to Inverness on foot.  The scenery was grand and beautiful.  The weather was fine, although after mid-day it became very hot.  A thunder storm was evidently approaching. The sun was obscured by a thunder-cloud; the sky flashed with lightning, and the rain began to pour down.  I was then high up on a wild looking moor, covered with heather and vast boulders.\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  An extemporised shower-bath\\n\\nThere was no shelter to be had, for not a house was in sight. I did not so much mind for my clothes, but I feared very much for my sketches.  Taking advantage of the solitude, I stripped myself, put my sketches under my clothes, and thrust them into a hollow underneath a huge boulder.  I sat myself down on the top of it, and there I had a magnificent shower-bath of warm rain.  I never enjoyed a bath under such romantic circumstances.  The thunder-clouds soon passed over my head, and the sun broke out again  cheerily.  When the rain had ceased I took out my clothes and drawings from the hollow, and found them perfectly dry.  I set out again on my long walk to Inverness; and reached it just in time to catch the Caledonian Canal steamer. While passing down Loch Ness I visited the romantic Fail of Foyers; then through Loch Lochy, past Ben Nevis to Loch Linnhe, Oban, and the Kyles of Bute, to Glasgow, and from thence to Edinburgh.\",\"timestamp\":1639289962,\"title\":\"\\nI made the requisite drawings, and proceeded with the work.
