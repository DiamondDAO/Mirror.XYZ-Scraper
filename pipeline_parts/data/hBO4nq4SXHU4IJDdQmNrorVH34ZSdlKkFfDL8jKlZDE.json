"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Introduction:\\n\\nWeb3 is limitless … kinda.\\n\\nOne of the major bottlenecks in our interaction with web3 ecosystems is the noticeable   lack of ideation in hardware. And I get it. Hardware is not nearly as sexy to scale and far tougher to start up. While a group of friends can band together and code a fully functional web application in one night, planning out and manufacturing even an MVP for hardware takes far more blood, sweat, and tears. To build out the requisite infrastructure to *actually* *scale* seems like a nightmare.\\n\\nThe natural issue that emerges is that such activation energy means consolidation is inevitable. Take NVIDIA for example: once enough nerds (term of endearment) figured out that graphics cards speed up the mining process, NVIDIA saw its market cap grow tenfold. Why? Because who is else has the capabilities to produce our precious GPUs?\\n\\nIn the spirit of Web3, this is a partially a good thing. We want to reward early adopters for their dedication to the cause (even if NVIDIA’s backing was rather implicit). On the other hand, consolidation goes against the very principles of decentralization. How are we supposed to build a world accessible to everyone if a few major players control the floodgates of access?\\n\\nSomething clearly needs to change. The NVIDIA example only speaks to the mining aspect of the crypto pipeline. But in general, for an effective web3 ecosystem to function, there needs to be efficient methods to both passively and actively converting ideas and personal data into productivity of some form, with both hardware and compute functioning as the oil facilitating that conversion process.\\n\\nFor the sake of simplicity, we can assume that efficiently allocating compute is a relatively solved problem -- or at least one that enough smart people are working on. So if we focus purely on hardware, our goal should be to create a *seamless* interface between the physical world and an infinite rolodex of metaverses. While simple computer monitors and mobile devices suffice for now, and VR/AR provide some hope for the future of interfacing, ***we need to think waaay bigger***. Here are some ideas:\\n\\n## 1) Modular Ecosystems\\n\\n> *\\\"There are no bad ideas in tech, only bad timing.\\\"*\\n\\n* Marc Andreesen\\n\\nIn web 2.0, modular devices fell flat on their face. Expeditions like Google’s Project Ara provided an incredible framework for a modular future but ultimately failed as a result of internal tension and weak public reception. The push to decentralization changes the fundamental assumptions that terrorized modularity in the past.\\n\\n## 2) Personal Passive Mining Rigs\\n\\n> *“A man’s rights rest in three boxes: the ballot box, the jury box, and the cartridge box.”*\\n\\n* Frederick Douglass\\n\\nTo bypass the inevitable erosion of personal necessity as a function of advancing technology,\\n\\n## 3) Drugs\\n\\n> *“I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer What did they look like? Ships? Motorcycles? Were the circuits like freeways? I kept dreaming of a world I thought I'd never see And then, one day I got in”*\\n\\n* Daft Punk\\n\\nOur reality is rapidly changing. The world that existed in our minds even two decades ago pales in comparison to what we know now.
