"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**December 26th 2021**\\n\\n** \\n **\\n\\nThis is my first post in a writing challenge I am starting for my winter break 2021/2022.  I plan to write a blog/journal every day until at least January 26th, 2022, which is  the start of my next semester of college.  I am doing this for a couple reasons I will lay out here, and there are probably more reasons I will either forget to mention, or they will be subconscious reasons I am unaware of.  \\n\\nI love writing and want to get better. I think writing is one of the most important skills to develop, and the only way to get better is to write more.  I am fortunate enough to be in college where I get to write a lot, but I am not always excited about the topics I am writing about, so it can feel excruciatingly laborious.  This challenge is an opportunity to build my writing skills on my own terms. I also hope by publishing my writings for the world to see, I will receive some constructive criticism to help me improve. \\n\\nI want to share my ideas with the world (and have them torn down). The artist and the writer are inherently narcissistic, and I am no different.  An odd anecdote from high school that has really stuck with me touches on this idea.  On the first day of class my freshman year, one of my favorite professors, Mr. Evans, gave us a pop quiz on his favorite topic: himself.  While he was making a joke, there is an essential truth behind it.  We are all obsessed with ourselves whether we would like to admit it or not.  This writing project is an outward manifestation of my self obsession.  I believe my thoughts and beliefs are so important that they need to be out there for others to spend some of what little time they have on earth reading them.  The only thing I love more than being right is being wrong (and being corrected).  When someone explains why my beliefs are wrong, I just become smarter and more right in the long run.  Hopefully someone will come across my writing and will be willing to challenge the assumptions and arguments in my writing, and I will grow from it.\\n\\nTo play the “Great Online Game”.  I am throwing up a little bit at how cliche and unoriginal it is to talk about Packy McCormick’s Substack article, “The Great Online Game”, but sometimes the truth is cliche.  I do not expect anyone to actually read my writing and there is a 99% chance that I will just be yelling into the void, but it is worth a try.  Being able to look back on my writing will let me see how my views have changed and I have matured.  Looking back to last year when I was writing about investments I would make, I “invested” in Substack post Series A, OpenSea post seed, and others.  Almost a year later, it shows my intuition that these companies would be successful was not only correct, but they have grown much larger than I expected.  I hope during this writing challenge I will have some predictions as strong as those, and maybe by adding Alpha to the universe someone will see and give me an internship or job offer. \\n\\nPromote Web3. I know I want to work in crypto/web3 when I get out of college.  I think doing anything else would be a costly mistake and I would kick myself for the rest of my life.  One of the best companies in Web3 right now is Mirror, the platform you are reading this article on right now.  It is similar to Substack but allows readers to own the articles, not just pay a monthly subscription.  Mirror will increase revenue for writers and allow early adopters to profit from their support.  The biggest issue I have seen with Mirror is that it is almost exclusively used to talk about crypto and web3.  This is a problem with the greater crypto community in general:  It is tremendously self-referential and it is not reaching out to expand its influence.  By using Mirror to share my mainly non-web3 thoughts, I hope to have a minuscule part in expanding the influence of web3.\\n\\nOne last idea for why I am publishing online is that I am holding myself accountable.  Even though no one is going to actually read this, posting online and on the block chain gives me a goal to reach and a record to make sure I actually write.  Along those lines I want to hold myself accountable on other facets of my life so I will post daily updates on those as well.  I want to play chess every day, read every day, meditate every day, and write at least 500 words per post.  I will provide relative metrics to those goals below.\\n\\nChess rating: 913\\n\\nBook Page # (On the Road, the original scroll): 223\\n\\nMinutes meditated today: (0) :(\\n\\nWord count: 816\\n\\n** \\n **\\n\\nThank you for checking this out!       \\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1640597460,\"title\":\"Writing ever day for the rest of my life or 1 month have not fully decided yet\"},\"digest\":\"5nk7FVfUVywVfqfdRQjncDyOaAOCb9QFTEs475oUlDI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x11CE580B7D64Fb08F73161AA95835202ae1C9417\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"j1jKRrjSsD3FM4saBPqJm78H5l1kG4hAk1d7jWdMycI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Tp7IvKX8tC_97S4Ce6wRmaSZa54E4F1Ru0OH1LaQI2U\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"wwqgETGm6Qydm9CoLUBXs-kS8LDvw_OsJEuaxgcEMMlF8GDP61Gq3hqOfqj1tRSQGtDbNkRa634Y3aolWfkJjw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa6949fadace177ef2e44a19c43ae6dc1969d58116cd54c8ebfb7b8884c536c837cdd375c62e68551d034b54a14cf9e0d2e1de62b66ff5707f6aba4f2b91073741b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"j1jKRrjSsD3FM4saBPqJm78H5l1kG4hAk1d7jWdMycI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Tp7IvKX8tC_97S4Ce6wRmaSZa54E4F1Ru0OH1LaQI2U\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wGgsivjDRWEZ1RvbR1ZIFrqvKhTmtnw1_0CDfCHllbI\"}"
