"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"together with the warlike nations of the Vilelas and the Guaycurus, had from the first rejected Christianity.  Attempts had several times been made to establish settlements amongst them, but the ferocity of all the tribes, their nomad habits -- for many of them passed their lives on horseback -- and the peculiar nature of their country, a vast domain of swamp, pierced by great rivers quite unknown to the Spanish settlers, had hitherto combined to render every effort vain. But, notwithstanding this, the Jesuits laboured incessantly, and not without success, amongst the wildest of the Chaco tribes. The gentle and eccentric Father Martin Dobrizhoffer passed many years amongst the Abipones, of whom he wrote his charming book.  He enumerates many tribes, of whom he says\\\\* \\\\`these are for the most converted by us, and settled in towns.'\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* \\\\`Account of the Abipones', p. 125. --\\n\\nNothing, perhaps, displays the Jesuits at their best, more than their efforts in the Chaco.  The enormous territory was sparsely peopled by about seventy tribes,*1* whereof there were fifteen or sixteen of considerable size.  Hardly two tribes spoke dialects by which they could communicate with one another, and almost every one of them lived in a state of warfare, not only with the Spaniards, but with the neighbouring tribes.  The inventories preserved by Brabo*2* show us the town of Paisanes in the Chaco, with its rough wooden houses, and the Jesuits' habitation in the middle of the place, stockaded, and without doors, and with but narrow openings in the wall, through which the missionaries crept.  The inside of the house contained five or six rough rooms, almost unfurnished, but for a few religious books and a plentiful supply of guns.*3* Their beds were of unvarnished wood, with curtains of rough cotton spun by the Indians.  Sometimes they had a sofa of leather slung between four stakes, a rack for medicine bottles, and for the wine for Mass. Lastly, one priest, in the settlement amongst the Toquitistines, had among his books copies of Cervantes and Quevedo; one hopes he read them half smiling, half with a tear in his eye, for your true humour is akin to tears.  Perhaps, reading `Don Quixote' or `El Gran Tacano', the poor priest forgot his troubles, and, wandering with Sancho in La Manchan oak-woods or through Castilian uplands, thought he was in Spain.*4*\\n\\n\\\\-- *1* Brabo, `Inventarios', p. ix. *2* Francisco Xavier Brabo, `Inventarios de los bienes hallados     a/ la expulsion de los Jesuitas' (Madrid, 1872). *3* The lists of cannons, guns, and arms of all kinds     in the inventories of the Chaco towns, preserved by Brabo,     serve to show not only the dangers to which the Jesuits were exposed,     but also how thoroughly the Jesuits understood the fickle nature of those     with whom they lived. *4* Another priest, the list of whose effects Brabo has preserved     in his `Inventarios', had a book called `El Alivio de Tristes'.     Even a Protestant may be excused for hoping that it merited its title. --\\n\\nThroughout the territory of the Gran Chaco there were but seven reductions established by the Jesuits.  These were San Jose de Bilelas, with its little town Petacas; San Juan Bautista de los Iristines, with its townlet of the same name; San Esteban de los Lules, with the town of Miraflores; Nuestra Senora del Buen Consejo de los Omarapas, capital Ortega; Nuestra Senora de Pilar de los Paisanes, with Macapillo as its centre; Nuestra Senora del Rosario de los Tobas, with its chief place called San Lucas; and, lastly, the establishment amongst the Abipones, known as La Concepcion.  In all these missions the Jesuits lived in constant peril of their lives.  In reading their old chronicles one finds the records of their obscure and half-forgotten martyrdoms, their sufferings, and the brief record of their deaths by an arrow or a club.  In 1711 Father Cavallero, with all his following, was slain by the savage Pinzocas.  In 1717 Father Romero, having, as a Jesuit writer says, \\\\`nothing but moral force behind him,'\\\\* was slain with twelve companions of the Guaranis of Paraguay. In 1718 Fathers Arco and Blende, Sylva and Maceo, received their dusted-over martyrs' crowns.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Cretineau Joly, tome v., chap. ii., p. 95.  Your moral force is excellent   in a civilized country; but your modern missionary usually prefers something   more in accordance with the spirit of the times. --\\n\\nRight up the western bank of the river Paraguay, in the old maps, the crosses mark the sites where Jesuits were slain.  That they all died to further crafty schemes, or for some hidden purpose of a Machiavelian nature, even a Dominican will scarcely urge.  That they did good -- more or less good than Protestant fanatics of the same kidney might have achieved -- it were invidious to inquire.  That which is certain is that they were single-hearted men, faithful unto the end to what they thought was right, faithful even to the shedding of their own blood, which is, one may believe, the way in which the scriptural injunction should be rightly read.\\n\\nIn the dim future, when some shadow of common-sense dawns on the world, and when men recognise that it is better to let others follow their destiny as it best pleases them, without the officious interference of their fellows, it may be that they will say all missionaries of whatsoever sect or congregation should have stayed at home, and not gone gadding to the desert places of the earth seeking to remedy the errors of their God by their exertions; but whilst the ideal still remains of sacrifice (which may, for all I know, be useless in itself, or even harmful), they must perforce allow the Jesuits in Paraguay high rank, or else be stultified.\\n\\nBut in the Chaco the Jesuits found conditions most different from those prevailing in their missions between the Uruguay and Parana. Instead of open plains, vast swamps; instead of docile semi-Arcadians like the Guaranis, who almost worshipped them, fierce nomad horsemen, broken into a hundred little tribes, always at war, and caring little for religion of any sort or kind.  Again, there seems in the Chaco to have been no means of amassing any kind of wealth, as all the territory was quite uncultivated and in a virgin state; but, still, the settlements had existed long enough for cattle to increase.\\\\* Lastly, the incursions of the barbarous tribes were a constant menace both to the Jesuits and their neophytes.  Yet in their indefatigable way the Jesuits made considerable progress amongst the Chaco tribes, as both the curious \\\\`History of the Abipones' by Father Dobrizhoffer and the inventories preserved by Brabo prove.\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* The total number of cattle was 78,171, as against   698,353 in the towns of the Guaranis.  See Brabo,   `Inventarios de los bienes hallados a/ la expulsion de los Jesuitas',   Appendix, p. 668. ** `History of the Abipones', from the Latin of Martin Dobrizhoffer,    London, 1822.\\n\\nIt is a curious circumstance that in the missions in the Chaco    there were negro slaves, though in the Paraguayan missions    they were unknown.  In the inventory of the town of San Lucas    appear the following entries, under the head of \\\\`Negros Esclavos':\\n\\n\\\\`Justo, que sirve de capataz en el campo; sera/ de edad    de veinte y siete an\\\\~os, mas o/ menos segun su aspecto.'\\n\\n\\\\`Item, Pedro, sera/ de diez y seis an\\\\~os y es medio fatuo.'\\n\\n\\\\`Item, Jose/ Felix, sera/ de un mes y medio.' --\\n\\nBesides their seven establishments in the Gran Chaco, they had three establishments in the north of Paraguay in the great woods which fringe the central mountain range of the country, known as the Cordillera de M'baracayu.  These missions, called San Joaquin del Taruma, San Estanislao, and Belen, were quite apart from all the other missions of the Guaranis, far distant from the Chaco, and removed by an enormous distance from those of the Order in the Moxos and amongst the Chiquitos, forming, as it were, an oasis in the recesses of the Tarumensian woods. These three reductions, founded respectively in 1747,\\\\* 1747, and 1760, were, as their dates indicate, the swansong of the Jesuits in Paraguay. Founded as they were far from the Spanish settlements, they were quite removed from the intrigues and interferences of the Spanish settlers, which were the curse of the other missions on the Parana. The Tobatines Indians\\\\*\\\\* were of a different class to the Guaranis, though possibly of the same stock originally.  Not having come in contact until recent years with the Spaniards, and having had two fierce and prolonged wars with the nearest settlements, they had remained more in their primitive condition than any of the Indians with whom the Jesuits had come in contact in Paraguay. During the short period of Jesuit rule amongst them (1746-1767) things seem to have gone on in a half-Arcadian way.  In San Joaquin, Dobrizhoffer, as he says himself, devoted eight years of unregretted labour to the Indians.  Most certainly he was one of the Jesuits who understood the Indians best, and his descriptions of them and their life are among the most delightful which have been preserved. He tells of the romantic but fruitless search during eighteen months throughout the forests of the Taruma by Fathers Yegros, Escandon, Villagarcia, and Rodriguez, for the Itatines who had left the reduction of Nuestra Senora de Santa Fe, and had hidden in the woods.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Though 1747 was the date of the final founding of these reductions,   as early as 1697 about four hundred Indians were discovered   in the woods of the Taruma by Fathers Robles and Ximenes,   and established in the mission of Nuestra Senora de Fe;   but in the year 1721 they all returned to the woods,   a famine and an outbreak of the small-pox having frightened them.   After being again established in a mission, and again having left it,   in 1746, they were established definitely at San Joaquin. \\\\*\\\\* Dobrizhoffer calls the Tobatines by the name of Itatines.    Charlevoix and others refer to them as Tobatines. --\\n\\nThen, commenting upon the strangeness of all affairs sublunary, he relates that accident at length effected what labour could not do. In 1746 Father Sebastian de Yegros, after a search of forty days, came on the Indians -- as it were, directed by Providence, or, as we now say, accident.  He built a town for them, and, as Dobrizhoffer says, \\\\`assembled them in Christian polity.' To the new-founded village cattle of every kind were sent, with clothes -- useful, of course, to those who had never worn them -- axes, and furniture, and lastly a few music masters,\\\\* without whose help those who build cities spend their toil in vain.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* \\\\`Account of the Abipones', p. 54. --\\n\\nTo the new town (in which the simple-hearted priest remained eight years), in 1753, came Don Carlos Morphi, an Irishman, and Governor of Paraguay; and, having stayed five days with Dobrizhoffer, departed, marvelling at the accuracy with which the new-made Christians (\\\\`Cristianos nuevos') managed their double-basses, their flageolets, their violins, and, in general, all their instruments, whether of music or of war.\\n\\nModestly, but with prolixity, as befits a virtuous, God-fearing man, the simple Jesuit relates a special instance of the way in which he was enabled to work both for his own glory and for the profit of the Lord. Not far from San Estanislao was situate the forest of M'baevera, in which grew quantities of trees from which the `yerba-mate' (Paraguayan tea) was made.  To reach it was a work of pain and trouble, for through the woods a track called a `picada' had to be cut; the rivers were deep, bridgeless, and had to have branches strewed along the track to give a footing to the struggling mules.\\\\*\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* In 1873, when I visited the outskirts of this forest,   the conditions were similar to those which Dobrizhoffer describes,   with the addition that the depopulation of the country,   owing to the recent long war, had allowed the tigers to multiply   to an extraordinary degree, and my guide and myself,   after feeding our horses, had to sleep alternately,   the waker holding the two horses hobbled and bridled. --\\n\\nAn expedition having been sent under a certain Spaniard called Villalba to collect `yerba', came suddenly upon a deserted Indian hut. As they had started quite unarmed, except with knives and axes to cut down the boughs, a panic seized them, and, instead of collecting any leaves,* they hurried back to San Estanislao.  No sooner did Dobrizhoffer hear the news than he set out to find the Indians, with a few neophytes, upon his own account.  Having travelled the `mournful solitudes' for eighteen days, they came upon no sign of Indians, and returned footsore and hungry, \\\\`the improvement of our patience being our sole recompense.'\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* The whole operation of collecting and preparing the leaves   of the `Ilex Paraguayensis', to make the `yerba-mate', was most curious.   Bands of men used to sally out for a six-months' expedition,   either by land with bullock-waggons, or up one of the rivers   in flat-bottomed boats, which were poled along against the rapid current   by crews of six to twelve men.  Arrived at the `yerbal',   as the forest was called, they built shelters, after the fashion of those   in use amongst the larger of the anthropoid apes.  Some roamed the woods   in search of the proper trees, the boughs of which they cut down   with machetes, whilst others remained and built a large shed of canes   called a `barbacoa'.  On this shed were laid the bundles of boughs   brought from the woods, and a large fire was lighted underneath.   During forty-eight hours (if I remember rightly) the toasting went on;   then, when sufficiently dry, the leaves were stripped from the twigs,   and placed on a sort of open space of hard clay, something like   a Spanish threshing-floor.  On this they were pounded fine,   and the powder rammed into raw-hide bags.  This concluded the operations,   and the `yerba' was then ready for the `higgling of the market'. --\\n\\nHe himself walked all the way, and `often barefoot', suffering `what neither I can describe nor yet my reader credit.' The missionary calling has undergone considerable change since 1750. Hardships which the greater faith or stronger constitutions of the missionaries of the last century rendered endurable are now largely fallen out of fashion, and your missionary seldom walks barefoot, even in a wood, because to do so would give offence, and bring discredit on the society for which he works.\\n\\nThough unsuccessful in his search that year, Dobrizhoffer, not daunted by his barefoot marching, set out again upon the Gospel trail next spring.  After another journey of some twenty days, during the whole course of which it rained incessantly, he came on a community of seemingly quite happy sylvans, whom he proceeded to convert.  In the first hut he met with there were eight doors, and in it dwelt some sixty Indians -- a palm-built, grass-thatched phalanstery, with hammocks slung from the rude beams, in which `these heathen' used to sleep. Each separate family had its own fire, on the hearth of which stood mugs and gourds and pots of rudely-fashioned earthenware. Naked and not ashamed `these savages', and the men wore upon their heads high crowns of parrot feathers.  For arms they carried bows and arrows, and the first man Dobrizhoffer saw was holding a dead pheasant in one hand, and in the other a short bow.  In the woods around the phalanstery was an \\\\`amazing' quantity of maize, of fruits of divers sorts, and of tobacco. From the hives which the wild bees make in hollow trees, they collected honey in large quantities, which served them (at least so Dobrizhoffer says) for meat and drink alike.\\n\\nTheir name for the god they worshipped was Tupa, but \\\\`of that God and his commandments they care to know but little.'  This sounds ambiguous, and would appear at first sight as if the confidence betwixt the creators and their God had been but slight.  Perhaps the ambiguity may be set down to the translator\\\\* who turned the Latin in which the memoirs first were formed into the vulgar tongue.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* \\\\`Traduttore traditore', as the proverb says. --\\n\\nA thing remarkable enough when one considers how prone mankind is to act differently was that, although the Itatines knew an evil spirit under the name of Ana, yet they paid little adoration to him, apparently content to know as little of him and his laws as they did of their God.\\n\\nThose hapless, harmless folk, as innocent of God and devil, right and wrong, and all the other things which by all rights they should have known, as they are said to be implanted in the mind of man, no matter what his state, seem to have lived quite happily in their involuntary sin.\\\\*  But Dobrizhoffer, in his simple faith and zeal for what he thought was right, wept bitter tears when he thought upon their unregenerate state.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Charlevoix says, in his `Histoire de la Nouvelle France',   speaking of the Indians in general:  `L'expe/rience a fait voir   qu'il e/toit plus a\\\\\\\\ propos de les laisser dans leur simplicite/   et dans leur ignorance, que les sauvages peuvent e^tre des bons Chre/tiens   sans rien prendre de notre politesse et de notre fac,on de vivre,   ou du moins qu'il falloit laisser faire au tems pour les tirer   de leur grossie\\\\\\\\rete/, qui ne les empe^che pas de vivre   dans une grande innocence, d'avoir beaucoup de modestie,   et de servir Dieu avec une pie/te/ et une ferveur, que les rendent   tre\\\\\\\\s propres aux plus sublimes ope/rations de la gra^ce.'   Had more people thought with Charlevoix, and not been too anxious   to draw savages incontrovertibly to our `politesse' (sic) and `fac,on',   and left more to time (\\\\`au tems'), how much misery might have been saved,   and how many interesting peoples preserved!  For, in spite of the domination   of the Anglo-Saxon race, it might have been wise to leave other types,   if only to remind us of our superiority. --\\n\\nA sycophantic Guarani from the reductions then took up his parable, and said:  `God save ye, brothers; we are come to visit you as friends. This father-priest is God's own minister, and comes to visit you, and pray for your estate.'  An aged Indian interrupted him, saying he did not want a father-priest, and that St. Thomas in the past had prayed sufficiently, as fruits of every sort abounded in the land. The Indian, in his unsophisticated way, seems to have thought the presence of a priest acted but as manure on the ground where he abode; but the Jesuit, almost as simple-minded as himself, took it in kindliness, and journeyed with the Indian to a large village about three days away. Arrived there, all the inhabitants of the place sat in a circle round the missionary.  They appeared (he says) in so much modesty and silence `that I seemed to behold statues, and not live Indians.' To awaken their attention he played upon the viol d'amore, and, having thus captured their ears, began to preach to them. The good priest probably believed all that he said, for, after dwelling on the perils of the road, he said:  `My friends, my errand is to make you happy.'  It did not seem to him that their free life in woods, in which abounded maize, fruits, and tobacco, with game of every kind, could possibly have induced content.  Content, as Christians know, comes but with faith, and a true knowledge of the dogma is above liberty.  Kindly, but muddle-headedly, he deplored their lot, their want of clothes, their want of interest in their God, their lack of knowledge of that God's commands.  Then, coming to the point, he spoke of hell, and told the astonished Indians that it was quite impossible for them to avoid its flames, unless, taught by a priest, they came to know God's law.  He then briefly (as he says) explained the mysteries of our faith.  They listened rapt, except that `the boys laughed a little' when he spoke of hell.\\\\* Nothing more painful than to see a child laughing unconscious of its peril in the traffic of a crowded street, and we may well believe that the kind-hearted Dobrizhoffer shuddered at the laughter of these children when he reflected that had he taken the wrong path, crossing the marshes or in the woods, the laughers had been damned. Much more he said to them after exhausting hell, and, to `add weight' to his oration, presented each of them with scissors, knives, glass beads, axes, small looking-glasses, and fishing-hooks, for he knew well that sermons which end in `give me' have but a small effect.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Hell not infrequently seems to have struck the Indians as a joke,   for Charlevoix relates that when the first missionaries   expatiated on its flames to the Chirignanos, they said,   \\\\`If there is fire in hell, we could soon get enough water   to put it out.'  This answer scandalized the good priest,   who could not foresee that the flames of Tophet would be extinguished   without the necessity of any other waters than those of indifference. --\\n\\nHe says himself quite frankly, \\\\`I seemed to have borne down all before me because I had mingled my oration with a copious largess.'\\\\* Glass beads and looking-glasses have from the time when the first Christian missionary preached to the Indians been potent factors in conversion, and still to-day do yeoman service in the great work of bringing souls to God.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* \\\\`Account of the Abipones', p. 74. --\\n\\nSeated around the fire `smoking tobacco through a reed', and pondering perchance over the mysteries of the new expounded faith, the `cacique' of the Itatines took up his parable.\\n\\n`I have' (said he) `conceived an affection for the father-priest, and hope to enjoy his company throughout my life.  My daughter is the prettiest girl in the whole world, and I am now resolved to give her to the father-priest, that he may always stay with me, and with my family, here in the woods.'\\n\\nThe Indians from the missions broke into laughter, after the fashion of all those who, knowing but a little, think that they are wise. The `cacique', who knew nothing, was astounded that any man, no matter what his calling, could live without a wife, and asked the Jesuit if the strange thing was true.  His doubts being satisfied, they fell discoursing on the nature of the Deity, a subject not easy of exhaustion, and difficult to treat of through the medium of an interpreter. `We know' (the `cacique' said) `that there is someone who dwells in heaven.' This vagueness put the missionary upon his mettle, and he set out at once to expatiate upon the attributes of God.  They seemed to please the `cacique', who inquired, `What is it that displeases, then, the dweller in the skies?'\\n\\nLies, calumnies, adulteries, thefts, all were enumerated, and received the Indian's assent; but the injunction not to kill provoked a bystander to ask if it was not permitted to a man to slay those who attacked his life.  He added, \\\\`I have endeavoured so to do since the first day I carried arms.'\\n\\n`Fanatical casuist' is a stout argument in the mouth of a man nurtured upon Suarez and Molina, but no doubt it did good service, and Dobrizhoffer uses it when speaking of the chief.  But Dobrizhoffer did better work than mere theological disputation, for he prevailed upon eighteen of the Indians to accompany him to the settlement of San Joaquin; and after having `for some months tried the constancy' of a youth called Arapotiyu, he admitted him to the sacrament of baptism, and `not long afterwards united him in marriage according to the Christian rites.'  It is evident that baptism should precede marriage; but it is an open question as to the duration of the interval between the two ceremonies, and we may be permitted to wonder whether, after all, both might not be advantageously dispensed at the same time. In the case of Arapotiyu the system worked satisfactorily, for he `surpassed in every kind of virtue, and might have been taken for an old disciple of Christianity.'  Even \\\\`old Christians' occasionally, despite their more laborious induction into the rites and customs of their faith, have fallen from grace, perhaps from the undue prolongation of the term between the ceremonies.\\n\\nIn the case of another youth (one Gato) things did not go so smoothly, for though he, too, by his conduct obtained both baptism and Christian wedlock, Dobrizhoffer adds without comment, \\\\`not many months after he died of a slow disease.'\\\\*  The slow disease was not improbably the nostalgia of the woods, from which the efforts of the good missionary had so successfully withdrawn him.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Padre del Techo, in his `History of Paraguay', says of the wood Indians   that `they died like plants which, grown in the shade,   will not bear the sun.' --\\n\\nThe labours of the Jesuits in the three isolated missions in the north of Paraguay\\\\* seem to have been as successful as those in the Chaco were unfortunate.  In dealing with the wild equestrian tribes of the Gran Chaco, the system of the Jesuits was not so likely to achieve success as amongst the peaceful Guaranis. That of the Spanish settlers was entirely ineffectual, and has remained so down to the present day, when still the shattered remnants of the Lules, Lenguas, Mocobios, and the rest, roam on their horses or in their canoes about the Chaco and its rivers, having received no other benefits from contact with the European races but gunpowder and gin.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* San Joaquin, San Estanislao, and Belen. --\\n\\nChapter IX\\n\\nThe Spanish and Portuguese attempt to force new laws on the Indians --   The Indians revolt against them -- The hopeless struggle goes on   for eight years -- Ruin of the missions\\n\\nThe missions in the Chaco and the Taruma, all founded between 1700 and 1760, the last (Belen) but seven years before the expulsion of the Jesuits from America, go far towards disproving the allegations of some writers,*1* that the apostolic energy of the first foundations had decayed, and that the Jesuits were merely living on the good name of the first founders in the beginning of the past century.  But let the zeal of any class of men be what it may, if they oppose themselves to slavery and at the same time are reported to have lands in which is gold, and resolutely exclude adventurers from them, their doom is sealed. Both crimes were set down to the Jesuits.  Writing in 1784, or twenty years after the expulsion of his order, Dobrizhoffer refers to the Indians of the reductions as \\\\`being in subjection*2* only to the Catholic King and the royal Governors, not in dreaded slavery amongst private Spaniards as the other Indians;' and Montoya, Lozano, and Del Techo, writing in earlier times, all confirm the statement, which is also doubly confirmed by the various royal edicts on the subject.*3* The reports of gold-mines, too, had never ceased, although they had been repeatedly disproved, and those, together with the stand for freedom for the Indians, led to the events which finally brought about the expulsion of the Order from the territories where they had worked so long.\\n\\n\\\\-- *1* Notably those of Azara. *2* `Account of the Abipones', p. 15. *3* As that of Philip V., from the palace of Buen Retiro, December 28, 1743,     and his two letters to the Jesuits of Paraguay.  Also the previous edict     obtained by Montoya from Philip II., and by the various additions     on the same head made from time to time to the code     known as `The Laws of the Indies'. --\\n\\nIn 1740, Gomez de Andrade, Governor for the King of Portugal in Rio de Janeiro, being one of those who was convinced that the reason why the Jesuits guarded their territories so religiously was that they had mines, bethought him of a plan.  His plan, like most of those conceived on the fantastic reasons which are called \\\\`of State', took no account of sentiment, and therefore, as mankind are and will ever be a thousand times more influenced by sentiment than by hard reasoning, was from the first bound of itself to fail.\\n\\nThe colony of Sacramento upon the river Plate had for a hundred years been the source of conflict between the Spaniards and the Portuguese.*1* Situated as it was almost in front of Buenos Ayres, it served as a depot for smugglers; and, moreover, being fortified, menaced the navigation both of the Parana and Paraguay. Slavers from England, Holland, and the German ports crowded the harbour. Arms of all kinds were stored there, and were distributed to all adventurers who meditated assaults against the crown of Spain.  Twice or three times it had been taken and restored, the Indians of the missions always rendering most efficient help.  At the time of which I write (1740) it had passed again by treaty under the dominion of the Portuguese, but still remained a standing menace to the Spaniards. Gomez Andrade advised the court of Lisbon to exchange it against the seven reductions*2* of the Uruguay, and thus at once to secure a country rich in gold and to adjust the frontier at the river Uruguay.  Nothing appears so simple to a statesman as to exchange one piece of territory for another.  A parchment signed after some international negotiations, and the whole thing is done. If, though, as happened in this case, one of the territories contains a population such as that which inhabited the seven towns upon the Uruguay, and which has conquered the country in which it lives from virgin forest, and defended it against all comers, it sometimes happens that the unreasonable inhabitants, by clinging to their homes, defeat the statesmen's plans.  Yet statesmen, once embarked in any plan, do not stick at such trifles as the affection of a people for its home, but quietly pursue their path, knowing that that which is conceived by ministers of State must in the end be beneficial to mankind. Without this patriotic abnegation of their feelings, no statesmen would be worthy of the name.  Indifference to the feelings of others is perhaps the greatest proof a public man can give of his attachment to the State.  After negotiations, lasting many years, in 1750 a treaty was signed between Portugal and Spain agreeing that the former should give up the Colonia del Sacramento to the Spaniards in exchange for the seven Jesuit towns upon the Uruguay, and that both nations should furnish a commission to fix the frontiers of the two nations on the Uruguay.*3*  On February 15, 1750, the Spanish court sent to the Jesuits of the seven towns to prepare their Indians to leave their homes and march into the forests, and there found new towns.\\n\\n\\\\-- *1* Since the discovery of America the Spaniards and the Portuguese     had been in constant rivalry throughout the south-eastern portion.     Their frontier, between what are now Brazil and Argentina, had never     been defined.  In 1494 King John II. of Castile concluded a treaty     signed at Tordesillas with the King of Portugal, placing the dividing-line     between the countries two hundred leagues more to the westward     than that of the famous Bull of Pope Alexander VI. (May 4, 1493),     which placed it at one hundred leagues west of Cape Verd,     cutting the world in two from the Arctic to the Antarctic Pole.     From the signing of the treaty of Tordesillas trouble began     in South America between the Powers, as by that treaty a portion of Brazil     came into the power of Portugal. *2* These were the towns of San Angel, San Nicolas, San Luis, San Lorenzo,     San Miguel, San Juan, and San Borja. *3* According to the 1913 edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia     (in the article titled \\\"Reductions of Paraguay\\\") this treaty,     signed in secret on 15 January 1750, was a deliberate assault     on the Jesuit Order by the Ministers of Spain and Portugal,     the latter of whom, Pombal, is said to have been responsible     also for the false and libelous \\\\`Histoire de Nicolas I.,     Roy du Paraguai et Empereur des Mamalus' (referred to in this chapter)     which was distributed throughout Europe as another attack on the Jesuits.     As anyone familiar with the situation could see that the Indians     would not be happy about the treaty's requirement to abandon their homes,     it was a well-calculated, though detestable, move.  -- A. L., 1998. --\\n\\nAt that date Francois Retz was General of the Jesuits, and on him devolved the duty of communicating the orders of the courts of Spain and Portugal to the Jesuits in the missions of the Uruguay.  Father Bernard Neyderdorffer was the man on whom the Provincial of Paraguay (Father Barreda) imposed the task of communicating to the Indians the wishes of the two courts. Though he had lived already thirty-five years in the missions, and knew the Indians well, and was respected by them as a father, he seems at first to have shrunk from such a task.  When the news was brought to the towns upon the Uruguay, none of the Indians at first would credit it. The `caciques' (chiefs) of the seven towns declared that they would rather die than leave their native place.  Nothing was heard but lamentations and expressions of hatred of the Portuguese, mingled with denunciations of the Jesuits themselves, who the poor Indians not unnaturally believed were in league with Spain to sell them to the Portuguese.  But in a little the clamours turned to action, and, not content with refusing to obey the edict of the two courts, the Indians broke into revolt.  Two most important narratives of this revolt exist, one by Father Cardiel and one by Father Ennis, both of whom were witnesses of the events.  After considerable negotiations, which lasted till 1753,*1* the united troops of Portugal and Spain advanced into the mission territory to arrange the occupation of the ceded towns. The commissioners of the two nations were, for Spain, the Marques de Valdelirios, and for Portugal General Gomez Freyre de Andrade, and both of them appear to have come to America already prejudiced against the Jesuits.  On March 24, 1753, Andrade wrote to Valdelirios, almost before he could have heard anything definite about the mission territory, to which they both were strangers, telling him that opposition was to be expected, and that the Jesuits were urging the Indians to revolt.*2*  The opposition that the two commissioners so confidently hoped to find,*3* and which contemporary writers have set forth in its true colours as but the revolt of ignorant Indians rendered desperate by being arbitrarily dispossessed of lands which they themselves had settled and held for almost a hundred years, was fraught with serious consequences, not only to the Jesuits in Paraguay, but to the Order throughout the world at large.  For years their enemies had said the Jesuits were endeavouring to set up in the missions a State quite independent of the Spanish crown.  By their own conduct the Jesuits to some extent had given colour to the report, for by excluding (in the interest of the Indians) all Spaniards from the mission territories, it looked as if they were at work at something which they wished to keep a secret, as no one at that time deemed it a serious plea to enter into any line of conduct for the good of Indians, whom in general the Spanish settlers looked upon as beasts.  That it was the best policy they could have possibly pursued under the circumstances is proved abundantly by the code of instructions laid down by Don Francisco Bucareli, the Viceroy of Buenos Ayres, under whose auspices the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1760 was carried out. In that code occurs the following article:*4*  `You will not allow any strangers, of whatever estate, quality, or condition they may be, to reside in the town (that is, of the missions), even if they be artisans,*5* and much less that they deal or take contracts in them either for themselves or for others, and you shall take especial care that the Laws of the Indies be executed, and specially those which are contained in Article 27 of Book IX.;*6* and also if any Portuguese deserters or other persons of whatever conditions should come to the towns, you will instantly conduct them to this city, taking every precaution to prevent their escape.'\\n\\n\\\\-- *1* Most of the dates of the events subsequent to the cession     of the seven reductions on the Uruguay are taken from     `La Causa Jesuitica de Portugal' (Madrid, 1768), written by Ibanez,     a great enemy of the Jesuits.  In it is also an account of the events     in Paraguay between 1750 and 1756, called `Relacion de la Guerra     que sustentaron los Jesuitas contra las tropas Espan\\\\~olas y Portuguesas     en el Uruguay y Parana/'.  No proof has ever been brought forward     that the Jesuits as a body ever incited the revolt of the Indians,     though undoubtedly Father Tadeo Ennis, a hot-headed priest, stirred up     his own particular reduction to resist.  It does not seem likely     that the Jesuits could have thought it possible to wage a successful war     against Spain and Portugal.  The dates taken from Ibanez     tally with original letters from the Marques de Valdelirios,     the Spanish boundary commissioner, and others, which are preserved     in the Spanish national archives at Simancas. *2* Vide `Exc. por los cartas que recibi con los avisos,     y llegada del P. Altamirano, entiendo acabara/ de persuadirse     a que los Padres de la Campan~ia son los sublevados,     sino los quitan de las aldeas sus Santos Padres (como ellos los llaman)     no experimentara/n mas que rebeliones insolencias y desprecios. . . .'     -- Letter quoted by Ibanez (`Causa Jesuitica'), and also preserved     at Simancas. *3* The Marques de Valdelirios, writing to Don Jose de Carvajal     from Monte Video, June 28, 1752 (Simancas, Legajo 7,447), says:     `Estoy cierto de que los padres estan ya en la persuasion     de que el tratado no se ha de dejar de executar.'  This being so,     it was evident that the Marquis, at the date of writing, was of opinion     that the Jesuits were not going to oppose the execution of the treaty,     as he goes on to say:  `Y es credible que con este desengan\\\\~o trabajan     seriamente en la mudanza de sus pueblos.' *4* The instructions were prepared in 1768 by Bucareli     for the guidance of Don Juan Joseph de Vertiz, his interim successor     in the government of the River Plate, and were delivered to him in 1770     when Bucareli returned to Spain.  They are printed by Brabo in his     `Coleccion de Documentos relativos a/ la Expulsion de los Jesuitas',     Madrid, 1872, p. 320. *5* `Oficiales mecanicos'. *6* This refers to the same subject, and prohibits any Spaniard     from settling in an Indian town in any part of America. --\\n\\nStill, though their policy was pursued, it did not stop the opponents of the Jesuits from denouncing that very policy, both at the cession of the seven towns and at the expulsion of the Order from America.  The commissioners, after innumerable delays, having found themselves in 1753 at Santa Tecla, a village near the Uruguay, it becomes necessary to cast a glance at what the Jesuits themselves were doing, and how they tried to do their duty as they saw it both to their Sovereign, their Order, and the Indians over whom they ruled. It seems as if, whilst the superiors of the Order recognised at once the futility of striving against Portugal and Spain, some of the inferior members secretly set on the Indians to armed resistance to the impolitic decree.  The council of the province (Paraguay)*1* assembled at the Jesuit college in Cordoba, composed of Fathers Masala, Horos, Caballero, Lopez, and Lozano, sent a memorial*2* both to the Viceroy of Peru and to the High Court of Charcas. In the memorial they first set forth their loyalty, and then exposed the deceit to which the ministers of Spain and Portugal had been subjected by their advisers in America.  They pointed out most justly that the treaty was damaging to both the countries concerned,*3* and that in regard to the Indians of the seven towns peculiarly unjust. Both at Charcas and at Lima their memorial (though diffuse) was favourably received, and a copy remitted to the King and Council at Madrid.  Ibanez, in his `Republica Jesuitica', qualifies the action of the Jesuits in this matter as a `great crime'.  Dean Funes only sees duplicity of language, but seems to excuse it in the circumstances in which the Jesuits were placed.  Certainly, after efforts extending over almost two hundred years, it was hard on them to see seven of their most flourishing missions arbitrarily broken up, the Indians driven from their homes, and their territory occupied by those very Portuguese who for a hundred years had been their persecutors. There was much to say in extenuation, even for \\\\`duplicity of language', when one remembers that the Jesuits alone (no matter how mistaken their views of treatment may seem to modern eyes) stood out against the assumption that the Indians were a mere flock of sheep, who might be driven from their homes on any pretext, or at the exigencies of ministers at courts who lived ten thousand miles away, and were completely ignorant of the local circumstances. Whether the memorial influenced the court of Spain is hard to say; but it is certain that when, in 1752, the Marques de Valdelirios arrived in Buenos Ayres, with him came as a commissioner to fix the boundary between the two nations of the Uruguay Father Luis de Altamirano, accompanied by his secretary, Rafael de Cordoba, both members of the Order, and that the Marquis took up his lodging in the college of the Jesuits.  There papers and memorials rained on him: one came from the Bishop of Tucuman, and one from Don Jaime de San Just, the Governor of Paraguay, with many others from people of inferior note, all in the interest of the Company.  It appears as if Valdelirios thought that these memorials were inspired, for his first action was to publish to the priests of the seven towns the wishes of his government as to evacuation by the Indians of the territory.  This he did through the prefect of the missions, who seems to have acted in good faith in his endeavours to carry out the wishes of the Spanish court. Just at that moment Barreda, the Provincial of Paraguay, arrived in Buenos Ayres, and Valdelirios asked him his opinion as to the measures best calculated to insure the treaty being quietly carried out.  Barreda, though all his interests were against the execution of the treaty, seems to have acted in good faith. He gave the sensible advice that, as the treaty had been made entirely without taking into consideration the difficulties of carrying it out, it could not be held a crime to ask the King for some delay.*4* He advised consulting three ex-Governors of Paraguay, who happened to be in Buenos Ayres,*5* and, lastly, that all hurry, or anything likely to excite the Indians, should be avoided; for it was possible that they, relying on their numbers and local knowledge, might be able to give much trouble even to the joint forces of both crowns. He laid before Valdelirios the condition of the reductions, telling him that they were fertile and well cultivated,*6* and that this of itself would incline the Indians against migrating from their lands. Lastly, he said it was the opinion of the most experienced of the priests that the Indians would yield neither to arguments nor reason, for the hatred of the Portuguese had put them quite beside themselves with fury at the idea of giving up their lands.  Valdelirios must have found himself not in too comfortable a state.  Lodged as he was in the college of the Jesuits, he must have felt that most of the advice which was so freely tendered him was biassed, and to relieve his mind he called a council, at which the Provincial Barreda, Juan Escadon, his secretary, Altamirano, and Rafael de Cordoba appeared.  The council recommended prudence, and, as the majority were Jesuits, pushed their prudence even beyond Lowland Scotch or north of Ireland limits, for they proposed to institute a commission which, after three years' investigation, should report at Buenos Ayres on what it had found out. Commissions, royal or otherwise, have always been a trump-card in the hands of governments, since peddling democracy, with show of noses and the like, came in and put an end to those good old methods which are as dear to-day to rulers' hearts as they have ever been since the beginning of the world, and will be whilst election, battle, fitness, talents, wealth, unfitness, or any other cause, gives power into the hands of anyone to rule.\\n\\n\\\\-- *1* Dean Funes, `Ensayo de la Historia Civil del Paraguay', etc.,     tome iii., p. 45. *2* Dean Funes says `una difusa memoria'; but, then, even though friendly,     churchmen and cats rarely forego a scratch.  The proverb has it,     `Palabras de santo, un~as de gato'. *3* Though Ibanez (`Republica Jesuitica', tome i., cap. i.) says:     \\\\`This treaty caused entire satisfaction to all the world     except the English, who feared their commerce would suffer by it     (i.e., by the closing of the Colonia del Sacramento as an entry     for smuggled goods), and the Jesuits.'\\n\\n```\\nRaynal, also an ex-Jesuit, but a man of far higher character     than Ibanez, says (tome iii., lib. 97):  `This treaty     met censure on both sides, the ministers in Lisbon     themselves alleging that it was a false policy to sacrifice     the Colonia del Sacramento, the clandestine commerce of which     amounted to two millions of dollars a year . . . for possessions     whose advantages were uncertain and position remote.  The outcries     were even stronger in Madrid.  There they imagined that the Portuguese     would soon rule all along the Uruguay . . . and from thence penetrate     up the rivers into Tucuman, Chile, and Potosi.' *4* Quoting the Pope who advised St. Augustine on his first mission visit     to England, to convert the natives to Christianity, to go slowly. *5* D. Martin de Echaria, Don Rafael de Menedo, and Don Marcos de Lauazabel. *6* From a letter preserved at Simancas (Legajo 7,447),     written by P. Diego Palacios to P. Luiz de Altamirano,     dated San Miguel, June 20, 1752, it appears that there were     in the territory of the seven towns plantations of `yerba' trees, cotton,     and valuable woods. --\\n```\\n\\nValdelirios, who was not a fool, saw their design, and instantly despatched Altamirano (1752) to Castillos to meet Freire de Andrade and the Portuguese, and set about drawing the new frontier line at once. Altamirano, though a Jesuit, appears (at first at any rate) to have been anxious that the treaty should be carried out. In 1752 (September 22) he wrote\\\\* from the reduction of San Borja to P. Mathias Stroner,\\\\*\\\\* ordering all the Jesuits to assist in carrying out the evacuation of the seven towns.  By his advice Freire de Andrade and Valdelirios met at Castillos, and, after having laid off some twenty leagues of boundary line, returned respectively to the Colonia and to Buenos Ayres.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Archivo de Simancas, Legajo 7,378, folio 17 -- a long and curious letter. \\\\*\\\\* `Stroner' may have been `Stoner', in which case he must have been    an Englishman.  There were few English names amongst    the Paraguayan Jesuits, if one except Juan Bruno de Yorca    (John Brown of York), Padre Esmid (Smith), the supposititious \\\\`Stoner',    and the doubtful Taddeo Ennis, who, though said to be a Bohemian,    was not impossibly a Milesian. --\\n\\nBut in the missions things were in a state bordering on revolution. When the letter from the prefect of the missions reached San Miguel, the Indians assembled outside the church,\\\\* and having learned the situation of the lands to which they were to move, their fury knew no bounds.  They all refused to stir, saying they had inherited their lands from their forefathers and by the grace of God.\\\\*\\\\*  Their example was at once followed by three more of the towns, and virtually a state of absolute defiance to the orders of the Spanish crown ensued.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Dean Funes, `Ensayo de la Historia Civil de Paraguay', etc., book v., p. 52. ** They also said, in a memorial presented to the Marquis of Valdelirios    by the Provincial Barreda, preserved at Simancas (Legajo 7,447),    `That they had voluntarily made themselves vassals of the King of Spain --    despues de Christianarnos, nos hizimos voluntariamente vasallos    de nuestro Catholico Rey de Espan\\\\~a para que amparandonos con su poder    fomentase nuestra devota Christiandad.'  It was not likely, therefore,    that they would voluntarily become subject to the Portuguese,    their most bitter persecutors. --\\n\\nJust at this moment Altamirano, the commissary, arrived, and found the state of things most serious.*1*  The commissary Altamirano set to work at once to place before the Jesuits of the seven towns the danger they exposed themselves to if they refused to help him to carry out the orders of the crown.  Almost immediately on his arrival he wrote*2* to Don Jose de Caruajal y Lancastre to send more troops, and to the various priests*3* to destroy their powder, and cease to manufacture any more.*4*  It is most likely that, if Altamirano had no secret understanding with his brother Jesuits, his letters must have considerably amazed them, and certainly they gave offence to the Indians, who declared he could not be a Jesuit at all.  Six hundred Indians, under a chief called Sepe Tyaragu, marched upon Santo Thome, where Altamirano had taken up his residence, with the avowed purpose of discussing whether he was a Jesuit or not, and, if the latter supposition proved correct, of throwing him into the river Uruguay;*5* but Altamirano did not wait their coming, and returned precipitately to Buenos Ayres.  The commission which had set out to mark the limits between the countries,*6* buried in the woods, or marching along the river, was absolutely unaware of what was going on amongst the Indians till they arrived in Santa Tecla on February 26, 1753.  The first notice that they had of it was when they found themselves surrounded by a strong force of Indians. One of the commissaries, Don Juan de Echevarria, is known to have left a curious account of the proceedings, from which Dean Funes, Ibanez, and most of the writers on the subject must have copied.*7*\\n\\n\\\\-- *1* Jose Barreda, the Father Provincial of the missions,     in a curious letter under date of August 2nd, 1753,     tells the Marquis of Valdelirios that he fears not only     that the 30,000 Indians resident in the seven towns may rebel,     but that they may be joined by the Indians of the other reductions,     and that it is possible they may all apostatize and return to the woods.     Brabo, in the notes to his `Atlas de Cartas Geograficas     de los Paises de la America Meridianal' (Madrid, 1872),     gives a synopsis of this letter, which formed part of his collection,     and contained the greatest quantity of interesting papers     on the Jesuits in Paraguay and Bolivia which has ever been     brought together.  In 1872, after publishing his `Atlas',     his `Coleccion de Documentos', and his `Inventarios',     he presented his papers (more than 30,000 in number)     to the Archivo Historico Nacional of Madrid.  There they remain,     and form a rich mine for dogged scholars who have not passed their youth     on horseback with the lazo in their hands. *2* Archivo de Simancas, Legajo 7,378, folio 146. *3* Ibid.:  `Que toda la polvora que tengan los curas y misioneros     se queme o se inutilize y pierda hechandola al rio, y que en los pueblos     donde se fabrica, cese luego este labor.' *4* In another letter, also preserved at Simancas, and dated at Yapeyu,     he complains bitterly of his own suffering on the journey:     `Me moli tanto con el traqueo violento del carreton que no he podido     volver sobre mi.'  The roads to the missions seem to have been     as bad as those which produced the historical exclamation,     `O dura tellus Hispaniae!'  It is certainly the case that Ibanez,     in his `Republica Jesuitica' (Madrid, 1768), gives a very different     version of the doings of Altamirano; for he says that Rafael de Cordoba,     Altamirano's secretary, `embarked in a schooner called `La Real'     a great quantity of guns and lead for balls, packing them all in boxes,     which, he said, were full of objects of a pious nature. . . .     This,' says Ibanez, `was told me by the master of the schooner     `Jose el Ingles', a man worthy of credence.'  This is pleasing to one's     national pride, but, still, one seems to want a little better authority     even than that of `Bardolph, the Englishman'. *5* Dean Funes, book v., cap. iii., p. 54. *6* In a most curious letter (preserved at Simancas, Legajo 7,447),     the mayor and council of the reduction of San Juan write to Altamirano     upbraiding him with being their enemy, and tell him that     `St. Michael sent by God showed their poor grandfathers     (\\\\`sus pobres abuelos') where to plant a cross, and afterwards     to march due south from the cross and they would find     a holy father of the Company.'  This, of course, turned out     as the saint had foretold, and after a long day's march     they encountered the Jesuit and became Christians. *7* This account seems to have been lost, and a careful search     has not disinterred it from the Maelstrom of Simancas,     that prison-house of so many documents, without whose aid     so much of Spanish history cannot be written. --\",\"timestamp\":1637495759,\"title\":\"\\nThe Tobas, Mataguayos, Lules, Aguilotas, Abipones, and the rest, together \"},\"digest\":\"vnjgrgWjiKMjCzWNBqKSSpBFd1YIrJ1j7T3XG6MQn9I\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x457882665D7cCf3457ff8b3aB95dA15a63bfDFa4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GRBjTzw8yDTHSTgKqXjy2cESOaLAPhaCsdQZTSfhfhU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TOuZIcTLvbBmhLaO8EA5Utju1bIfBDXu6z32WXGlrj8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"zRX8csQZYUBl8Z_XgTgnu7h5p0ioG86uDahuH4WEYPKu8RKNJ4BSdppqx2BgjJG1Xq4YlwGp6EHMxLDjSk-AAQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x09ba523ac873a8caf938f8b308ffd850e8b17c2d046805dd9710afba1c76514778ede268034cb75a54ccf26baee7bdd1968aea6d8054029a4a9a292f519476661b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GRBjTzw8yDTHSTgKqXjy2cESOaLAPhaCsdQZTSfhfhU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TOuZIcTLvbBmhLaO8EA5Utju1bIfBDXu6z32WXGlrj8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"vnjgrgWjiKMjCzWNBqKSSpBFd1YIrJ1j7T3XG6MQn9I\"}"
