"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Welcome to The Dog Lover, the first ever short film backed by Ethereum. Why? Because the old models of fundraising are lacking. Traditionally, crowdfunding campaigns are the only way young artists like us can bring our visions to life. Art is essential: bringing people meaning, comfort, and community. But with the current infrastructure, art can be really difficult to make and share with the world: we’re often forced to put a lot of our own money, hard work and time into projects without compensation. Often, we have to sign away ownership of our creative vision to companies that hold our art and our creative rights hostage. It goes both ways, too: fans are just fans, and donors don’t get much in return for their financial contribution.\\n\\n[Dog Lover](crowdfund://0x7265b48eBF05d83bfB97C5fc341E4eBBFd1b53C0?version=tiered_1&network=rinkeby&features=overview)\\n\\nWith this experiment in a crypto-funded model of filmmaking, we want to pave the way for change. We want models of direct ownership of art: a future where there is a real connection between artists and their fans. We want you to have a stake in The Dog Lover. We want supporters who aren’t just supporters, but collaborators. By participating, you’re co-creating that future with us. You’re coming on to our creative team and gaining a behind-the-scenes look into what it takes to make films happen. Together with you, we will take The Dog Lover to through the festival circuit, where we anticipate it being a major contender.\\n\\nSupporters of The Dog Lover will be innovators: no other short films have been created this way in cinema history!\\n\\n### What’s The Dog Lover About?\\nHow far would you go to be loved? What personal price would you pay? Would you change yourself into someone — or something — other than who you are?\\n\\nThese are the questions The Dog Lover asks, and that our main character, Walter, must answer.\\n\\nWhen Walter’s wife’s beloved dog Max dies, her grief is crushing. Walter works hard to fill the aching void in her heart, but nothing seems to please her. Walter soon discovers that he can win Sarah’s love by acting like her dog.\\n\\nIt isn’t long before the couple begins to rekindle their romance through these strange circumstances. Things are looking up, until Walter realizes that this particular pathway to love is paved with all sorts of bizarre pitfalls. A little too bizarre, perhaps. It soon becomes clear to Walter that he must choose whether he’s willing to be his wife’s dog.\\n\\nThe Dog Lover is a weird, offbeat story with elements of dark comedy and horror. But it also has an emotional core that is deeply relatable: at one point or another, we’ve all had to decide if we’re going to be someone’s dog (so to speak) or risk loneliness. Needless to say, we don’t always make the right decision.\\n\\nCheck out the trailer below, cut from footage from the original short we made together during our first year at the American Film Institute Conservatory (the number one film school in the US according to the Hollywood Reporter). With this new version, we’re going to expand and perfect the story and utilize the skills we developed during our time at AFI.\\n\\nTRAILER\\n\\n## Meet the team\\n\\n### Director\\n**ANNE-SOPHIE BINE**\\nOf French and Polish background, Anne-Sophie Bine was raised in several different countries — which may be why she speaks five languages.
