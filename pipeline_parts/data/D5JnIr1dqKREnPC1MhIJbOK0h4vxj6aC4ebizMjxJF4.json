"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Let’s get you set up and into the community! This guide will be broken down into the following sections: \\n\\n1. Getting a Wallet\\n2. Receiving the NFT\\n3. Joining the Discord\\n\\n## 1. Getting a Wallet\\n\\nYou may already have a Coinbase account for trading. Exchange accounts ≠ wallets, the same way that your stock brokerage account ≠ your checkings account. Plus, it’s much more secure to separate accounts you trade on and accounts where you hold collectibles! A couple of popular recommendations are:\\n\\n* **[Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)** - Great for the casual user. Compatible with Coinbase and has a great UI/UX experience.\\n* **[Metamask](https://metamask.io/)** - A convenient extension that tags onto your Google Chrome browser. Has a companion mobile app too.\\n* **[Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/)** - Another great wallet for predominantly mobile-phone users with a great UI/UX.\\n\\n**After you’re set-up with your wallet, send me your public Ethereum wallet address. This is where I’ll send your NFT to.** Ideally, you copy-paste this rather than type it to avoid errors. It should look something like this:\\n\\n0x963A0183E1BB92bDb31916C6a15B217F3c4cD8de\\n\\n## 2. Receiving the NFT\\n\\nAfter you send over your wallet address, either directly to me or with one of the Airtable forms sent to you, I’ll airdrop you your NFT. You’ll be able to find it in your wallet or on [Opensea](https://www.opensea.io), the largest NFT marketplace on the internet. \\n\\nLooks something like this:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TddfK6xHzRuUvtTf4NTzd.png?height=2355&width=3360)\\n\\nThis is now your exclusive ticket into the Discord channel. No one can take it away from you (unless you willingly give it to someone else). You don’t need to do anything as of now, other than verify that it is indeed in your account. It may take up to 10 minutes to show up.\\n\\n## 3. Joining Discord\\n\\nIn the meantime, feel free to join our Discord. You can do this as you are waiting for the NFT to arrive! Following [this link](https://discord.gg/nr2A4qMnz4), you’ll be able to login or signup. At first, the server will look very empty. This is because the rest of the server is “members only” for ConsumerDAO ticket holders.\\n\\n![How the server will look as you join!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HWAW1NcftJ1EKAs1yvtFk.png?height=1146&width=2696)\\n\\nFollowing the onboarding instructions in the “**#start-here**” channel, you’ll be taken to through CollabLand’s verification process in “**#collabland-join**.” Hit the “Let’s go!” button as seen below, and further instructions will be provided to you in-browser.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yA6kO45axmWdWrEvqWSK-.png?height=842&width=1564)\\n\\nWithin 10 minutes, you should be verified and given a role called “Insider.” With this role, you should have access to the rest of the server :) A sneak peek is as below:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_6kEEk5c9vTjCUnPP7pD2.png?height=1432&width=2680)\\n\\n## And you’re in!\\n\\nAppreciate your patience as we onboard our initial users into Discord. If you check back on a daily basis, we’ll have discussion questions and learning materials posted for your enjoyment.\",\"timestamp\":1640456355,\"title\":\"Getting Started (ConsumerDAO)\"},\"digest\":\"KDTnGEHWixY-60_itmZiZoKDnugOPuIk0l6m5pxZXcE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x963A0183E1BB92bDb31916C6a15B217F3c4cD8de\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"my3cD8vKPN1j-8FyMiAFsQFh-9slHAc4ZjqvERMTnRU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zmbVQIIGw4vuD_niFqFTT3DvfOBAn85X81KIvD7cgT4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"hw00c_mIbC2Q2viNDpx5gmg_EY2c_5aMDPK8wLOpwvO2HvpEj1RZNQw9Y8_hM1bAovNgq2AB5jxMzddhlYhmYg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4e5f7547015734cab83b1833306b3562a0ac6346091b9ed29a839dd0fdcea8b20b7801d80a8cdcfc0f69cdf740c0d24a8570e305998deced5c351dcc925f8d0f1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"my3cD8vKPN1j-8FyMiAFsQFh-9slHAc4ZjqvERMTnRU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zmbVQIIGw4vuD_niFqFTT3DvfOBAn85X81KIvD7cgT4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"PWygfcdDw2YXcuAswT5C9HnCRqKEYEDmdAH3tY0rh3U\"}"
