"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Overview\\n\\nThere's a bunch of crypto/web3 content out there: articles, books, videos, tweets, etc. However, nothing beats actually trying things out and seeing how web3 works with your own eyes.\\n\\nThis post should help you do just that. Think of it as a hands-on beginner's guide to web3. My hope is that this helps you get your feet wet in the space, and sparks your curiosity to dig further!\\n\\nWe’ll cover the following topics:\\n\\n* Custodial vs non-custodial crypto\\n* Wallets & identity\\n* ENS domains\\n* Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)\\n* Investigating transactions\\n* Web3 communities\\n\\nTo do so, we’ll go through the following steps:\\n\\n1. Buy ETH\\n2. Set up MetaMask\\n3. Send ETH to your MetaMask\\n4. Set up your .eth name with ENS\\n5. Swap ETH for AAVE on Uniswap\\n6. Buy an NFT\\n7. Investigate transactions on Etherscan\\n8. Join web3 communities\\n\\nWe’ll be focused on the Ethereum ecosystem. Since we’ll be making transactions, we’ll have costs along the way (e.g. gas fees, NFTs, etc), so be ready to dedicate \\\\~$500 for this.\\n\\nIn the first iteration of this post, I’m making the choice to not distill every single step and screenshot, since I think there’s value and figuring stuff out on your on (to some extent).\\n\\n### 1. Buy ETH\\n\\nYou’ll need ETH to buy NFTs, pay for gas fees, trade for BTC, etc. You should buy it from an exchange that allows you to transfer cryptocurrency out of their custody, such as [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) and [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/). I recommend buying at least 0.1 ETH for this exercise.\\n\\n### 2. Set up MetaMask\\n\\nMetaMask is the most popular crypto wallet, and it’s how you’ll interact with dApps (decentralized applications). While it’s called “wallet”, you can think of it as your “crypto profile” that you can use across any web3 app — kind of like a “Login with Facebook”.\\n\\nFirst set up [MetaMask as a browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn), and then download the accompanying mobile app.\\n\\nWhen setting up MetaMask, you’ll create a wallet address, that might look something like this: 0x9fD7c5133243696784771cE7Fb0d8433D91Cd730. This is the public unique identifier of your wallet (i.e. “crypto profile”).\\n\\nMake sure you store your MetaMask seed phrase and password in a safe place!\\n\\n### 3. Send ETH to your MetaMask\\n\\nSend ETH from your centralized exchange (i.e. Coinbase, Gemini) to your newly-created MetaMask account. In order words, send the ETH to your wallet’s address.\\n\\nYou now officially have full custody of your ETH, congrats!!\\n\\n### 4. Set up your .eth name with ENS\\n\\nYou can think of the [Ethereum Name Service (ENS)](https://app.ens.domains/) as a “domain registrar” for web3. You can use it to buy .eth names.\\n\\nFor instance, I own the **bru.eth** name, which now maps to my wallet address 0x9fD7c5133243696784771cE7Fb0d8433D91Cd730. This is cool because bru.eth can substitute my super long address number, which is much more user-friendly (e.g. in searches, in apps, etc).\\n\\nOnce you buy your .eth domain, you’ll need to do two things:\\n\\n1. Map your .eth name to your wallet address\\n2. Map your wallet address to your .eth name\\n\\nThen you’re done, and your .eth name will start resolving to your wallet address!\\n\\nAs you might expect, the .eth is an NFT, as it is unique (i.e. non-fungible).\\n\\n### 5. Swap ETH for AAVE on Uniswap\\n\\n[Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap) is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX). Essentially a web3 version of Coinbase, based on smart contracts. Uniswap was built on top of Ethereum. Let’s try it out.\\n\\nConnect your wallet to Uniswap — if you did the previous step correctly, you should see your newly created .eth name there, instead of a long wallet address.\\n\\nNow let’s swap some ETH for another token, like AAVE for instance. Enter the amount of ETH you want to swap for AAVE (or whatever other token you choose).\\n\\nOnce the swap has been completed, you should see both ETH and AAVE in your wallet.\\n\\n### 6. Buy NFT\\n\\n[OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) is the largest NFT marketplace. Find a cheap NFT to purchase that speaks to you, and go for it!\\n\\nAs a suggestion, these [Fucked Crypto Homers](https://opensea.io/collection/fucked-crypto-homers) are pretty cool (and, more importantly, very cheap).\\n\\nYour wallet should now have: \\n\\n* Some ETH\\n* Some AAVE\\n* Your .eth name\\n* Your newly bought NFT\\n\\n### 7. Investigate transactions on Etherscan\\n\\n[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) is essentially a search engine for Ethereum transactions. Since the Ethereum blockchain is public, anyone can see every transaction in it. Transparency is one of the beautiful things about web3.\\n\\nSearch for your wallet address on Etherscan, and then find all the transactions you’ve done so far:\\n\\n* Transfering ETH from centralized exchange to MetaMask\\n* Buying .eth name on ENS\\n* Swapping ETH for AAVE on Uniswap\\n* Buying NFT on OpenSea\\n\\nMake sure to spend some there clicking things through, reading every label, and really wrapping your head around how etherscan works. Feeling comfortable using etherscan will pay a lot of dividends in your web3 journey.\\n\\n### 8. Join web3 communities\\n\\nCommunities are at the core of web3. And they tend to be concentrated in Discord, Twitter and Telegram.\\n\\nHere are some interesting Discord communities for you to join:\\n\\n1. **Bored Ape Yacht Club.** [Website](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/bayc).\\n2. **Art Blocks**. [Website](https://artblocks.io/) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/KyKZgSUk59).\\n3. **Uniswap**. [Website](https://uniswap.org/) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/FBs5FYfb).\\n\\nI also created this [NFT Twitter List](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1421481307524186115) a while back with some relevant people in the space. Get ready for a lot of avatars on your timeline!\\n\\n## Further reading\\n\\nIf you want to dig deeper, here are some resources and ideas:\\n\\n* [Mastering Ethereum: Building Smart Contracts and DApps](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Ethereum-Building-Smart-Contracts/dp/1491971940/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1P90Y4EHRPX2G&keywords=mastering+ethereum&qid=1636332939&qsid=130-4447074-6974018&sprefix=mastering+et%2Caps%2C158&sr=8-1&sres=1491971940%2C1789531373%2C1839213191%2C1491954388%2C198617011X%2C1492054704%2C1492045268%2C1492054860%2CB07D81VLQH%2C1617295159%2C0578528150%2C1839218266%2CB08WZ4P1DY%2C1789954118%2CB095GNTW1G%2C1492031496&srpt=ABIS_BOOK).
