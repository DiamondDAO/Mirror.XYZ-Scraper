"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"A clever chap once said, [“I think, therefore I am”](https://newlearningonline.com/new-learning/chapter-7/descartes-i-think-therefore-i-am). No thought, no identity. At least, no identity you choose for yourself. Identity and choice. This is what’s at stake.\\n\\nElsewhere it’s said that we are made in God’s image, attributing identity and creation to the purview of divinity. Where *we* define identity and *we* author creation, are we too not torches of this sublime privilege? A privilege, yes, and with it, responsibility. To all of you involved in creation, whatever you create, this is for you. If you create fashion, as I do, this is especially for you.\\n\\nNow, cast your eye upon our digital landscape and you will observe that we sit on the edge of a very large shift. For fashion and far beyond. I suspect you already have an opinion on it. I speak, of course, of the metaverse.\\n\\nFor or against what you have heard so far, it is too important to ignore. Never in the history of humankind have we had the opportunity to create in the purest sense – to create something from nothing. And every voice is needed. My hope is that I prompt you to consider how you use yours.\\n\\nI believe in you. You think. You are. You have skills, talents, passions. And a place on this earth. Pay attention to the movements of this shift and consider how your unique self might help shape them. Neglect this and it will be [what gets built for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C74amJRp730).\\n\\nThe metaverse. We must create it consciously. And we must create it together.\\n\\nThe question now is “how?”\\n\\n![\\\"Rene Descartes\\\", an AI-generated portrait from the LOSTPOETS project by pak.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yzzrWm39q8wCVqCOUusYL.png?height=600&width=600)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1642371346,\"title\":\"I think, therefore I am: the need for conscious design in the metaverse.\"},\"digest\":\"wzGxI333WmDqygLT4MpYz5CEZRQvbyF5POnxVu7weaw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7b994E111Cd89c9391bE815Fa6Fcd6ef2abFD053\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"lgipa4a0gwbtPpk-aEZ5Iq2hmRlEU6IMLgSILi6ujcE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_HsNpCBifui_MkBngrJEJkN5uhMd7-EBIjvcFdxxAX8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"xksNHZG-hXVGz4C_DYORnP4E1d-xS2poCz1tQAUWmgwHGsJtV-ni5bqgRuNebJ-BQwz3f9rCB9PCGJhorudAUQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8efd16653f11d1fb5529530c36a6156ee4fa66de902f9491c11ab0dcfc0a6cac05b0c2d58e2501e755c044912ea281828b6351e6b516e476e930220a5bb92dd51b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"lgipa4a0gwbtPpk-aEZ5Iq2hmRlEU6IMLgSILi6ujcE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_HsNpCBifui_MkBngrJEJkN5uhMd7-EBIjvcFdxxAX8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"HEpZfZQFnHC0VzdgfERK1sTwzBUxhIKT4EAyKwZCLd0\"}"
