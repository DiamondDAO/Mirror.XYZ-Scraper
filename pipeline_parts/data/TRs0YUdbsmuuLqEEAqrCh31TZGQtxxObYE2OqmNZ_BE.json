"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*This is not a one-time post. Instead, this post will be home to my daily entries as I navigate through and participate in the first project by the [Jenkins the Valet Writers Room](https://cointelegraph.com/news/jenkins-the-valet-founder-wants-to-create-a-decentralized-web3-content-company). New posts will appear directly beneath this text. Older posts will be pushed ever downward.*\\n\\n### Wednesday, December 29, 2021\\n\\n**Yesterday I finally dove into the Jenkins short stories to get a sense of the BAYC narrative world. These \\\"short stories\\\" are actually just 500-word introductions — of characters and their concomitant intrigue.**\\n\\nIn this world, rarity and valuation determine personal worth — pretty utopian, right? — and all lesser BAYCs (don't even mention Mutant Apes) get stuck in service positions, like our hero Jenkins, who sees his shiny job valet job at the Yacht Club as his chance to make a little scratch and do some wise hodling.\\n\\nBut combine Skull & Crossbones, The Five Families, the CIA, the FBI, and the KGB and you're only starting to approach the soul-sucking dastardliness of this moneyed place. Here, Jenkins learns that obedience and discretion can go a long way.\\n\\nJenkins first earns The Ape Father's trust. Then word gets around fast, and pretty soon he's helping out other apes — some of whom seem to be at cross-purposes. He helps a down-on-his-luck old-timer recover a priceless private key. He meets a famous former stuntman-turned-altcoin-shill and falls in love with a model ape who's appeared in magazines.\\n\\nThe more I read these stories, the more I drift into a Pynchonian mindset — who are the bad guys? are there good guys? who's got the money and who's got the drugs? are they the same people? why?\\n\\nThere will be plenty to report back. Next time, I'll recount a bit more of Jenkins' backstory, and soon I'll introduce the two apes I'll be co-licensing for Book 1. \\n\\n### Friday, December 24, 2021\\n\\nJenkins the Valet is making good on the paradigm-shifting move made by the creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club. The move? Issue intellectual property rights with each NFT purchase, which — overnight — laid the groundwork for a potential extended narrative universe. The Writers Room is the natural outgrowth of that decision on the part of the BAYC creators.\\n\\nIt’s been about two weeks since I bought my first Jenkins the Valet Writers Room ticket. It’s not even been a week since I decided that the ticket didn’t give me enough to work with, so I bought a Writers Room key.\\n\\nThis post will be the living document of my experience in The Writers Room. I plan to post my learnings, opinions, and creative process in this daily-updated article.\\n\\nOver the coming weeks, I will be:\\n\\n* Learning the ins and outs of existing Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) lore and existing stories.\\n* Introducing my co-licensed apes and going through the process of building out their backstories and lore.\\n* Participating in the submitting proposals, voting, and collaborating with other apes and the official author of the first Jenkins the Valet novel, Neil Strauss.\",\"timestamp\":1640796589,\"title\":\"In the Jenkins Writers Room\"},\"digest\":\"h04qwY02jjO21ohN0yNGrXGeA5l7iMcUFqwhHJwz6JE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x38D4E17B62BF1bADD7132aCDA9E4BFF009846978\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_SHVdRow9ekLC85wPR49S6Ug5awTmdqYhThkdIkwcIw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AWb1Fa4BUAlupllCR-MLgtPcmVgwBNu5jncjscmE_Ts\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"9muBscVyEo1SWAGpQTToRRD_qBWGvZiVJZp34wKF_Nzg0DkhmOtwoOm1Rj-61TEZ9RM-IFtNAEZ54pTNbziaUw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x3cfa4c77654c8fc5306772dd657468a246449425599d7fb2f956374e81b7dbb37e3b83c8f2033eab3f3a336184351f164b7030a33c0227025c5a7a70e6472c4a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_SHVdRow9ekLC85wPR49S6Ug5awTmdqYhThkdIkwcIw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AWb1Fa4BUAlupllCR-MLgtPcmVgwBNu5jncjscmE_Ts\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"LbKHkQf5YGAD70gnMuTMrSp2YmiVcpgUk6xTmaKQADE\"}"
