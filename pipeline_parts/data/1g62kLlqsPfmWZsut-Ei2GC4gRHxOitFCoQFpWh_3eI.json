"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Portal-the workflow editor, the platform itself. Here, you can use the ParsiQL language to build a simple workflow or write a complex logical structure in a few seconds, with additional conditions and formats.\\n\\nSmart Trigger-We are equivalent to Zapier's \\\"Zap\\\". It is defined as monitoring specific on-chain events and triggering downstream operations when they occur. Smart triggers are actually smart contracts deployed in the PARSIQ ecosystem. It allows triggers from the external chain to be passed to the off-chain system.\\n\\nTrigger Wizard-No code editor, embedded application on Portal, can help you build Smart Trigger in minutes. In the wizard, you can enter the blockchain address to be monitored, add custom parameters such as risk score, and then select the delivery channel to be notified. Essentially, Wizard will create the ParsiQL code for you.\\n\\nParsiQL-a specific programming language that provides support for all smart triggers, including those built using the Trigger Wizard. For more in-depth customization, developers can further customize and edit ParsiQL code to meet their specific needs. Like most coding languages, it has unlimited possibilities.\\n\\nBut what if I want to use...Graph?\\n\\nThen you should be good at indexing and querying historical blockchain data. However, if you need to respond in real time, you need PARSIQ. Graph is a service based on pull-based query data, which means you need to pull related query data from historical records. PARSIQ is a push-based service because it is promoting the development of events for further operations.\\nGraph provides an interface for historical events that have occurred on the blockchain in a queryable way. PARSIQ works in real time, allowing this unlimited real-time data stream to be converted.\\n\\nBut what if I use...Chainlink?\\n\\nThen you have a good data source for your smart contract to execute a result. Usually, the oracle uses one method: input off-chain data into the blockchain. The data comes from sensors or other real-world sources. Then it will be verified. It will be delivered to the blockchain or smart contract. However, if you need data to move in the opposite way, you need to use PARSIQ.\\n\\nYou can call it a reverse oracle, because PARSIQ uses real-time blockchain data and delivers it to real-world applications through notifications, reminders, and APIs.\",\"timestamp\":1635663193,\"title\":\"PARSIQ related terms\"},\"digest\":\"wxXTgrf_MZPGaW-S8yRiy5eLKfx1Ew0rDwhsH3ebobs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa7A74628446F158CB4Ae4D9e052d351baE487b11\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"SEPcENnqV3HYJo6UiCiRq8MhQlZ91Hja2rfaktq4ozA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"RZGnwHsMVAnmbbOfr6Lzcs1dUuzBVljMLjf2nx5lBvk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"NP0zHqLCChkLMq6uvWIhThsodhda0h8x1pTJE9tCb-KXq9eNGZOpUz4fWKKav75NmUY0uDy77T63NjoaDNxDuw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x38db38244f916d4bd48513f86c9031d328bc0ce08e700b9b213528a7dc6334870ee8eee088c0c3fc414629bc68b8c45468f98ba7b2c70a4e8d077bed303018161b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"SEPcENnqV3HYJo6UiCiRq8MhQlZ91Hja2rfaktq4ozA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"RZGnwHsMVAnmbbOfr6Lzcs1dUuzBVljMLjf2nx5lBvk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wxXTgrf_MZPGaW-S8yRiy5eLKfx1Ew0rDwhsH3ebobs\"}"
