"{\"content\":{\"body\":\" *[Supermash](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/SuperMash-1695264.html)*, developed and published by [Digital Continue](https://www.digitalcontinue.com/), bids itself as a “game that makes games”. You run a video games store, that’s on the verge of closing when you discover an old retro console that lets you combine (or mash) two different genres of game together to generate a unique old-school title that borrows elements from your chosen genres.\\n\\nEvery game you generate has its own challenge for you to complete. Whether the task is achievable, however, is a whole other story. In fact, *Supermash* begins with a screen that states:\\n\\n> “*Supermash doesn’t design games a person would. The mashes can be: Good, Weird, Unbalanced, Incredibly Hard, Super Easy. The fun comes from finding and saving the games and rising to the challenge to overcome seemingly unbeatable mashes*.”\\n\\nIn a bid to perhaps spice things up a bit, Digital Continue also incorporated “glitches” into the *Supermash* generation process. That’s right, a retro game wouldn’t be retro without the odd glitch now would it… would it? The difference here is that these glitches actively affect the game’s mechanics, with some having positive effects and others negative. This is why, in my time playing *Supermash*, I’ve often found that it was the glitches themselves that dictated if my play-through would be a success or failure, more so than the combination of the two chosen genres.\\n\\n![The Conqueror: Ninja](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NR4E5GIExgoS_vmOnM5Eu.jpg?height=976&width=1259)\\n\\nFor example, **The Conqueror: Ninja** was an example of a fun, functioning Stealth & Metroidvania mash, where I played as “Quinn” on a 5-minute mission to kill all the shadow bats throughout the level with my silenced pistol. I particularly liked the sonar-esque field-of-vision cones they gave the bats, and as long as you stayed clear of these you remained undetected. Where the glitch came into play, was the spawning of a heart canister every time I got hit by an enemy. This essentially resulted in me being somewhat invincible.\\n\\n![Forgotten Legends of the Epic Gems](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bD3brAlT2hF73Xfnx9E36.jpg?height=972&width=1257)\\n\\nMeanwhile, **Forgotten Legends of the Epic Gems** was a hilarious combination of Shooter and Adventure, as my “G-74 Striker” aircraft navigated a Zelda-like dungeon, swinging a stoneblade sword and breaking pots. There was even a secret area that transported me to a traditional top-down Shmup environment. This time, the active glitch was a treasure chest that spawned after several swings of my sword, which would contain either power-ups, gems, or hearts. So, if you spammed the attack button, you would spawn in more chests.\\n\\n![Boing Boing Town](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tx5WVU1ZFsdG7aViJy9E6.jpg?height=970&width=1254)\\n\\nSadly, **Boing Boing Town** was just impossible. I received a task from a customer to create a hard Platformer Jrpg, and boy did *Supermash* overachieve. Despite her best efforts, “Lady Justus” and her team were no match for the evil undead, when the active glitch was to spawn a new enemy foe during a random encounter battle, on each successful hit by the enemy. Soon outnumbered, I never got past the first fight.\\n\\nAll of this got me thinking. How do we approach genre-mashing in Literature?\\n\\nCross-genre or “*Hybrid Genre*” writing is hugely popular and has been a long-established approach to fiction writing. William Blake’s *The Marriage of Heaven and Hell* (1793) is considered a truly classic example of hybrid genre fiction, with a blend of poetry, prose, and engravings.\\n\\nIn contemporary fiction, we are more likely to think of contrasting combinations such as the Noir/SciFi of *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep*, the Period Drama/Horror splicing of *Pride & Prejudice & Zombies*, the Crime/Fantasy of *Rivers of London* & *The City & The City*, and the Fantasy/Romance of YA series’ *Twilight &* The Mortal Instruments. However, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-genre) also suggests Action Comedy, Comedy Drama, and Romantic Comedy amongst others as examples of literary mashes. I can’t help but think these have become such mainstream, popular combinations that they are taken for granted as hybrid genres.\\n\\nSo how do you pen a successful cross-genre novel?\\n\\n[Esther Rabbit](https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/writing-cross-genre-novels-trends-marketing-insights/), author and content creator, proposes there are two types of reader to identify when marketing your story.\\n\\n> **The Reality anchored reader:** Even when reading works of fiction, this reader seeks real-life experiences through the written word. No flying unicorns, no glittery vampires, no magic wielding creatures. Just life unfolding in its realistic layers whether it’s drama, romance or comedy.\\n>\\n> **The Fantasy anchored reader:** This reader is looking for a way out of real-life, wanting nothing more than to escape in a world where nothing is impossible: supernatural creatures, life on other planets, worlds hidden in plain sight.\\n>\\n> Esther Rabbit – Writing Cross-Genre Novels: Trends, Marketing & Insights\\n\\nIn addition to this, [Michelle Richmond](https://www.writersdigest.com/write-better-fiction/how-to-write-sell-the-cross-genre-novel) proposes 3 key objectives to the perfect *Supermash* formula.\\n\\n> **• Recognize your primary genre—and use it as your compass.** Let your primary genre give your story structure, and you’ll have a strong foundation upon which to build.\\n>\\n> \\\\*\\\\*• Draw on your strengths as a writer, regardless of genre.\\\\*\\\\*Write what you love, and write it with an eye toward entertaining your reader.\\n>\\n> **• Create characters that defy genre conventions.** If you were to extract your main character from the novel and set them down in an entirely different situation, would the reader still care what happens to them?\\n>\\n> Michelle Richmond – How to Write & Sell a Cross-Genre Novel\\n\\nSo how far could we push this cross-genre envelope? How far-flung and subversive can we get before the sublime became ridiculous? How about…\\n\\n**The Hunt for Red Riding Hood** | Classic fairy tale meets Tom Clancy thriller.
