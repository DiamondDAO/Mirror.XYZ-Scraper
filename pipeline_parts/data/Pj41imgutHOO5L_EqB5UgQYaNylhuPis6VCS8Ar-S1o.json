Our team deserve to be listened to; it’s only 1 minute of their time. Don’t give any flags to anyone who isn’t giving you the time of day.\\n* Do not serve flags to anyone talking on the phone. You can say “It’s okay, I’ll wait until you’re finished” repeatedly until they give you their undivided attention.\\n* Awkward situation? Be firm, polite, and know when to inform the bars security. Never try to reprimand someone yourself.\\n* It’s okay to chat but Ambassadors mustn’t hang around the table for more than 15 minutes.\\n* Every participant should take the national flag.\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1640063670,\"title\":\"Resident Ambassadors\"},\"digest\":\"bBAbDlrE9FuubfgvCPYFl4l8BFsddtYNExCxqhBtrB4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"34suyCfnLUoFM02SOhmJJJ9iXgiiL5kC6iPH6Fv3LXk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"jtVAiplEVAd0RPMj7L2P0umm9wTPdvk-kh1vAJTvwJc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"qKE8ts0Hh28o8FS2FVfsEnHx9y2NvVxfFdiLQRboIP0PH-DFmcoZ5yfK5ntfkRknADlga2-hLcfTq-_xYfh7Sg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x57d0f7cbea22222afabed23e09ac819f759269ea4cca2a83cdd992ddf3ffe88d22a7afd325b70c3c1ae7dee6f5fc8e22188ba69c589cf1f0528e258261121ae51b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"34suyCfnLUoFM02SOhmJJJ9iXgiiL5kC6iPH6Fv3LXk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"jtVAiplEVAd0RPMj7L2P0umm9wTPdvk-kh1vAJTvwJc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"bBAbDlrE9FuubfgvCPYFl4l8BFsddtYNExCxqhBtrB4\"}"
