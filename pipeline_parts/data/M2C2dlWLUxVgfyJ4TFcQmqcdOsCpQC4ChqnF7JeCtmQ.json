"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Her bosom heaved, but she would not encourage such proceedings, nor let Rosa see how eager she was to hear those very excuses she had evaded.\\n\\nBut, for all that, Rosa knew she was going to read it, for she only had her gown taken off and a peignoir substituted, and her hair let down and brushed a little. Then she dismissed Rosa, locked the door, and pounced on the letter. It lay on her table with the seal uppermost. She turned it round. It was not from *him:* it was from Lord Uxmoor.\\n\\nShe sat down and read it.\\n\\n\\\"DEAR MISS VIZARD--I have had no opportunities of telling you all I feel for you, without attracting an attention that might have been unpleasant to you; but I am sure you must have seen that I admired you at first sight. That was admiration of your beauty and grace, though even then you showed me a gentle heart and a sympathy that made me grateful. But, now I have had the privilege of being under the same roof with you, it is admiration no longer--it is deep and ardent love; and I see that my happiness depends on you. Will you confide *your* happiness to me? I don't know that I could make you as proud and happy as I should be myself; but I should try very hard, out of gratitude as well as love. We have also certain sentiments in common. That would be one bond more.\\n\\n\\\"But indeed I feel I cannot make my love a good bargain to you, for you are peerless, and deserve a much better lot in every way than I can offer. I can only kneel to you and say, 'Zoe Vizard, if your heart is your own to give, pray be my lover, my queen, my wife.'\\n\\n\\\"Your faithful servant and devoted admirer,\\n\\nUXMOOR.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Poor fellow!\\\" said Zoe, and her eyes filled. She sat quite quiet, with the letter open in her hand. She looked at it, and murmured, \\\"A pearl is offered me here: wealth, title, all that some women sigh for, and--what I value above all--a noble nature, a true heart, and a soul above all meanness. No; Uxmoor will never tell a falsehood. He *could* not.\\\"\\n\\nShe sighed deeply, and closed her eyes. All was still. The light was faint; yet she closed her eyes, like a true woman, to see the future clearer.\\n\\nThen, in the sober and deep calm, there seemed to be faint peeps of coming things: It appeared a troubled sea, and Uxmoor's strong hand stretched out to rescue her. If she married him, she knew the worst--an honest man she esteemed, and had almost an affection for, but no love.\\n\\nAs some have an impulse to fling themselves from a height, she had one to give herself to Uxmoor, quietly, irrevocably, by three written words dispatched that night.\\n\\nBut it was only an impulse. If she had written it, she would have torn it up.\\n\\nPresently a light thrill passed through her: she wore a sort of half-furtive, guilty look, and opened the window.\\n\\nAy, there he stood in the moonlight, waiting to be heard.\\n\\nShe did not start nor utter any exclamation. Somehow or other she almost knew he was there before she opened the window.\\n\\n\\\"Well?\\\" said she, with a world of meaning.\\n\\n\\\"You grant me a hearing at last.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do. But it is no use. You cannot explain away a falsehood.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course not. I am here to confess that I told a falsehood. But it was not you I wished to deceive. I was going to explain the whole thing to you, and tell you all; but there is no getting a word with you since that lord came.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He had nothing to do with it. I should have been just as much shocked.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But it would only have been for five minutes. Zoe!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Just put yourself in my place. A detective, who ought to have written to me in reply to my note, surprises me with a call. I was ashamed that such a visitor should enter your brother's house to see me. There sat my rival--an aristocrat. I was surprised into disowning the unwelcomed visitor, and calling him my solicitor.\\\"\\n\\nNow if Zoe had been an Old Bailey counsel, she would have kept him to the point, reminded him that his visitor was unseen, and fixed a voluntary falsehood on him; but she was not an experienced cross-examiner, and perhaps she was at heart as indignant at the detective as at the falsehood: so she missed her advantage, and said, indignantly, \\\"And what business had you with a detective? You having one at all, and then calling him your solicitor, makes one think all manner of things.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should have told you all about it that afternoon, only our intercourse is broken off to please a rival. Suppose I gave you a rival, and used you for her sake as you use me for his, what would you say? That would be a worse infidelity than sending for a detective, would it not?\\\"\\n\\nZoe replied, haughtily, \\\"You have no right to say you have a rival; how dare you? Besides,\\\" said she, a little ruefully, \\\"it is you who are on your defense, not me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"True; I forgot that. Recrimination is not convenient, is it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can escape it by shutting the window,\\\" said Zoe, coldly.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, don't do that. Let me have the bliss of seeing you, and I will submit to a good deal of injustice without a murmur.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The detective?\\\" said Zoe, sternly.\\n\\n\\\"I sent for him, and gave him his instructions, and he is gone for me to Homburg.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah! I thought so. What for?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"About my money. To try and find out whether they mean to keep it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Would you really take it if they would give it you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course I would.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yet you know my mind about it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know you forbade me to go for it in person: and I obeyed you, did I not?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, you did--at the time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do now. You object to my going in person to Homburg. You know I was once acquainted with that lady, and you feel about her a little of what I feel about Lord Uxmoor; about a tenth part of what I feel, I suppose, and with not one-tenth so much reason. Well, I know what the pangs of jealousy are: I will never inflict them on you, as you have on me. But I *will* have my money, whether you like or not.\\\"\\n\\nZoe looked amazed at being defied. It was new to her. She drew up, but said nothing.\\n\\nSeverne went on: \\\"And I will tell you why: because without money I cannot have you. My circumstances have lately improved; with my money that lies in Homburg I can now clear my family estate of all incumbrance, and come to your brother for your hand. Oh, I shall be a very bad match even then, but I shall not be a pauper, nor a man in debt. I shall be one of your own class, as I was born--a small landed gentleman with an unencumbered estate.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is not the way to my affection. I do not care for money.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But other people do. Dear Zoe, you have plenty of pride yourself; you must let me have a little. Deeply as I love you, I could not come to your brother and say, 'Give me your sister, and maintain us both.' No, Zoe, I cannot ask your hand till I have cleared my estate; and I cannot clear it without that money. For once I must resist you, and take my chance. There is wealth and a title offered you. I won't ask you to dismiss them and take a pauper. If you don't like me to try for my own money, give your hand to Lord Uxmoor; then I shall recall my detective, and let all go; for poverty or wealth will matter nothing to me: I shall have lost the angel I love: and she once loved me.\\\"\\n\\nHe faltered, and the sad cadence of his voice melted her. She began to cry. He turned his head away and cried too.\\n\\nThere was a silence. Zoe broke it first.\\n\\n\\\"Edward,\\\" said she, softly.\\n\\n[ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/10](ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/10)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637670468,\"title\":\"\\nZoe divined that the girl had been asked to put it there.\"},\"digest\":\"QCECC63OvllNk8rF7ioqr4gc9-kgKrWF8RiEyXL_xeE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xeCFFC09a569272AB1413A3E9E440BC486ddb0a97\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ooT6-Gj4i_gpoWQCD5iAZ5W3fa28ZFnnQP1IuweyS3E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"S3jozTgC95QcRnE8bIHjxmW2zrpUzt015_K9jb949G8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"_2GZ1QNe0kLBOixEOdK0WTGv6tdS4ATODl8Lb8uesUJfkg30hzL5RH4cdZsm8EZacXX-bbdopZkY9-ae65H1DA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8dd6faf9f87cd84b51ebc4c755a6fe6d6daa712ad386200a291be0958b61dbb125af7a88b50506ae4bb939620e0ac2a6911e0bd9302f7d2250048b911bf0d6a71c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ooT6-Gj4i_gpoWQCD5iAZ5W3fa28ZFnnQP1IuweyS3E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"S3jozTgC95QcRnE8bIHjxmW2zrpUzt015_K9jb949G8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"QCECC63OvllNk8rF7ioqr4gc9-kgKrWF8RiEyXL_xeE\"}"
