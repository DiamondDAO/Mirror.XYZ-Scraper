"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"From that time, for months, there was usually a little volume of Scott in one's pocket, in company with the miscellaneous collection of a boy's treasures.  Scott certainly took his fairy folk seriously, and the Mauth Dog was rather a disagreeable companion to a small boy in wakeful hours. {1}  After this kind of introduction to Sir Walter, after learning one's first lessons in history from the \\\"Tales of a Grandfather,\\\" nobody, one hopes, can criticise him in cold blood, or after the manner of Mr. Leslie Stephen, who is not sentimental.  Scott is not an author like another, but our earliest known friend in letters; for, of course, we did not ask who Shakespeare was, nor inquire about the private history of Madame d'Aulnoy.  Scott peopled for us the rivers and burnsides with his reivers; the Fairy Queen came out of Eildon Hill and haunted Carterhaugh; at Newark Tower we saw \\\"the embattled portal arch\\\" -\\n\\n\\\"Whose ponderous grate and massy bar Had oft rolled back the tide of war,\\\" -\\n\\njust as, at Foulshiels, on Yarrow, we beheld the very roofless cottage whence Mungo Park went forth to trace the waters of the Niger, and at Oakwood the tower of the Wizard Michael Scott.\\n\\nProbably the first novel I ever read was read at Elgin, and the story was \\\"Jane Eyre.\\\"  This tale was a creepy one for a boy of nine, and Rochester was a mystery, St. John a bore.  But the lonely little girl in her despair, when something came into the room, and her days of starvation at school, and the terrible first Mrs. Rochester, were not to be forgotten.  They abide in one's recollection with a Red Indian's ghost, who carried a rusty ruined gun, and whose acquaintance was made at the same time.\\n\\nI fancy I was rather an industrious little boy, and that I had minded my lessons, and satisfied my teachers--I know I was reading Pinnock's \\\"History of Rome\\\" for pleasure--till \\\"the wicked day of destiny\\\" came, and I felt a \\\"call,\\\" and underwent a process which may be described as the opposite of \\\"conversion.\\\"  The \\\"call\\\" came from Dickens.  \\\"Pickwick\\\" was brought into the house.  From that hour it was all over, for five or six years, with anything like industry and lesson-books.  I read \\\"Pickwick\\\" in convulsions of mirth.  I dropped Pinnock's \\\"Rome\\\" for good.  I neglected everything printed in Latin, in fact everything that one was understood to prepare for one's classes in the school whither I was now sent, in Edinburgh.  For there, living a rather lonely small boy in the house of an aged relation, I found the Waverley Novels. The rest is transport.  A conscientious tutor dragged me through the Latin grammar, and a constitutional dislike to being beaten on the hands with a leather strap urged me to acquire a certain amount of elementary erudition.  But, for a year, I was a young hermit, living with Scott in the \\\"Waverleys\\\" and the \\\"Border Minstrelsy,\\\" with Pope, and Prior, and a translation of Ariosto, with Lever and Dickens, David Copperfield and Charles O'Malley, Longfellow and Mayne Reid, Dumas, and in brief, with every kind of light literature that I could lay my hands upon.  Carlyle did not escape me; I vividly remember the helpless rage with which I read of the Flight to Varennes.  In his work on French novelists, Mr. Saintsbury speaks of a disagreeable little boy, in a French romance, who found Scott assommant, stunningly stupid.  This was a very odious little boy, it seems (I have not read his adventures), and he came, as he deserved, to a bad end.  Other and better boys, I learn, find Scott \\\"slow.\\\"  Extraordinary boys!  Perhaps \\\"Ivanhoe\\\" was first favourite of yore; you cannot beat Front de Boeuf, the assault on his castle, the tournament.  No other tournament need apply.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, greatly daring, has attempted to enter the lists, but he is a mere Ralph the Hospitaller.  Next, I think, in order of delight, came \\\"Quentin Durward,\\\" especially the hero of the scar, whose name Thackeray could not remember, Quentin's uncle.  Then \\\"The Black Dwarf,\\\" and Dugald, our dear Rittmeister.  I could not read \\\"Rob Roy\\\" then, nor later; nay, not till I was forty.  Now Di Vernon is the lady for me; the queen of fiction, the peerless, the brave, the tender, and true.\\n\\nThe wisdom of the authorities decided that I was to read no more novels, but, as an observer remarked, \\\"I don't see what is the use of preventing the boy from reading novels, for he's just reading 'Don Juan' instead.\\\"  This was so manifestly no improvement, that the ban on novels was tacitly withdrawn, or was permitted to become a dead letter.  They were far more enjoyable than Byron.  The worst that came of this was the suggestion of a young friend, whose life had been adventurous--indeed he had served in the Crimea with the Bashi Bazouks--that I should master the writings of Edgar Poe.  I do not think that the \\\"Black Cat,\\\" and the \\\"Fall of the House of Usher,\\\" and the \\\"Murders in the Rue Morgue,\\\" are very good reading for a boy who is not peculiarly intrepid.  Many a bad hour they gave me, haunting me, especially, with a fear of being prematurely buried, and of waking up before breakfast to find myself in a coffin.  Of all the books I devoured in that year, Poe is the only author whom I wish I had reserved for later consideration, and whom I cannot conscientiously recommend to children.\\n\\nI had already enjoyed a sip of Thackeray, reading at a venture, in \\\"Vanity Fair,\\\" about the Battle of Waterloo.  It was not like Lever's accounts of battles, but it was enchanting.  However, \\\"Vanity Fair\\\" was under a taboo.  It is not easy to say why; but Mr. Thackeray himself informed a small boy, whom he found reading \\\"Vanity Fair\\\" under the table, that he had better read something else.  What harm can the story do to a child?  He reads about Waterloo, about fat Jos, about little George and the pony, about little Rawdon and the rat-hunt, and is happy and unharmed.\\n\\nLeaving my hermitage, and going into the very different and very disagreeable world of a master's house, I was lucky enough to find a charming library there.  Most of Thackeray was on the shelves, and Thackeray became the chief enchanter.  As Henry Kingsley says, a boy reads him and thinks he knows all about life.  I do not think that the mundane parts, about Lady Kew and her wiles, about Ethel and the Marquis of Farintosh, appealed to one or enlightened one. Ethel was a mystery, and not an interesting mystery, though one used to copy Doyle's pictures of her, with the straight nose, the impossible eyes, the impossible waist.  It was not Ethel who captivated us; it was Clive's youth and art, it was J. J., the painter, it was jolly F. B. and his address to the maid about the lobster.  \\\"A finer fish, Mary, my dear, I have never seen.  Does not this solve the vexed question whether lobsters are fish, in the French sense?\\\"  Then \\\"The Rose and the Ring\\\" came out.  It was worth while to be twelve years old, when the Christmas books were written by Dickens and Thackeray.  I got hold of \\\"The Rose and the Ring,\\\" I know, and of the \\\"Christmas Carol,\\\" when they were damp from the press.  King Valoroso, and Bulbo, and Angelica were even more delightful than Scrooge, and Tiny Tim, and Trotty Veck.  One remembers the fairy monarch more vividly, and the wondrous array of egg-cups from which he sipped brandy--or was it right Nantes?-- still \\\"going on sipping, I am sorry to say,\\\" even after \\\"Valoroso was himself again.\\\"\\n\\nBut, of all Thackeray's books, I suppose \\\"Pendennis\\\" was the favourite.  The delightful Marryat had entertained us with Peter Simple and O'Brien (how good their flight through France is!) with Mesty and Mr. Midshipman Easy, with Jacob Faithful (Mr. Thackeray's favourite), and with Snarleyyow; but Marryat never made us wish to run away to sea.  That did not seem to be one's vocation.  But the story of Pen made one wish to run away to literature, to the Temple, to streets where Brown, the famous reviewer, might be seen walking with his wife and umbrella.  The writing of poems \\\"up to\\\" pictures, the beer with Warrington in the mornings, the suppers in the back-kitchen, these were the alluring things, not society, and Lady Rockminster, and Lord Steyne.  Well, one has run away to literature since, but where is the matutinal beer?  Where is the back-kitchen?  Where are Warrington, and Foker, and F. B.?  I have never met them in this living world, though Brown, the celebrated reviewer, is familiar to me, and also Mr. Sydney Scraper, of the Oxford and Cambridge Club.  Perhaps back-kitchens exist, perhaps there are cakes and ale in the life literary, and F. B. may take his walks by the Round Pond.  But one never encounters these rarities, and Bungay and Bacon are no longer the innocent and ignorant rivals whom Thackeray drew.  They do not give those wonderful parties; Miss Bunnion has become quite conventional; Percy Popjoy has abandoned letters; Mr. Wenham does not toady; Mr. Wagg does not joke any more.  The literary life is very like any other, in London, or is it that we do not see it aright, not having the eyes of genius?  Well, a life on the ocean wave, too, may not be so desirable as it seems in Marryat's novels:  so many a lad whom he tempted into the navy has discovered.  The best part of the existence of a man of letters is his looking forward to it through the spectacles of Titmarsh.\\n\\nOne can never say how much one owes to a school-master who was a friend of literature, who kept a houseful of books, and who was himself a graceful scholar, and an author, while he chose to write, of poetic and humorous genius.  Such was the master who wrote the \\\"Day Dreams of a Schoolmaster,\\\" Mr. D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson, to whom, in this place, I am glad to confess my gratitude after all these many years.  While we were deep in the history of Pendennis we were also being dragged through the Commentaries of Caius Julius Caesar, through the Latin and Greek grammars, through Xenophon, and the Eclogues of Virgil, and a depressing play of Euripides, the \\\"Phoenissae.\\\"  I can never say how much I detested these authors, who, taken in small doses, are far, indeed, from being attractive. Horace, to a lazy boy, appears in his Odes to have nothing to say, and to say it in the most frivolous and vexatious manner.  Then Cowper's \\\"Task,\\\" or \\\"Paradise Lost,\\\" as school-books, with notes, seems arid enough to a school-boy.  I remember reading ahead, in Cowper, instead of attending to the lesson and the class-work.  His observations on public schools were not uninteresting, but the whole English school-work of those days was repugnant.  One's English education was all got out of school.\\n\\nAs to Greek, for years it seemed a mere vacuous terror; one invented for one's self all the current arguments against \\\"compulsory Greek.\\\"  What was the use of it, who ever spoke in it, who could find any sense in it, or any interest?  A language with such cruel superfluities as a middle voice and a dual; a language whose verbs were so fantastically irregular, looked like a barbaric survival, a mere plague and torment.  So one thought till Homer was opened before us.  Elsewhere I have tried to describe the vivid delight of first reading Homer, delight, by the way, which St. Augustine failed to appreciate.  Most boys not wholly immersed in dulness felt it, I think; to myself, for one, Homer was the real beginning of study.  One had tried him, when one was very young, in Pope, and had been baffled by Pope, and his artificial manner, his \\\"fairs,\\\" and \\\"swains.\\\"  Homer seemed better reading in the absurd \\\"crib\\\" which Mr. Buckley wrote for Bohn's series.  Hector and Ajax, in that disguise, were as great favourites as Horatius on the Bridge, or the younger Tarquin.  Scott, by the way, must have made one a furious and consistent Legitimist.  In reading the \\\"Lays of Ancient Rome,\\\" my sympathies were with the expelled kings, at least with him who fought so well at Lake Regillus:-\\n\\n\\\"Titus, the youngest Tarquin, Too good for such a breed.\\\"\\n\\nWhere -\\n\\n\\\"Valerius struck at Titus, And lopped off half his crest; But Titus stabbed Valerius A span deep in the breast,\\\" -\\n\\nI find, on the margin of my old copy, in a schoolboy's hand, the words \\\"Well done, the Jacobites!\\\"  Perhaps my politics have never gone much beyond this sentiment.  But this is a digression from Homer.  The very sound of the hexameter, that long, inimitable roll of the most various music, was enough to win the heart, even if the words were not understood.  But the words proved unexpectedly easy to understand, full as they are of all nobility, all tenderness, all courage, courtesy, and romance.  The \\\"Morte d'Arthur\\\" itself, which about this time fell into our hands, was not so dear as the \\\"Odyssey,\\\" though for a boy to read Sir Thomas Malory is to ride at adventure in enchanted forests, to enter haunted chapels where a light shines from the Graal, to find by lonely mountain meres the magic boat of Sir Galahad.\\n\\nAfter once being initiated into the mysteries of Greece by Homer, the work at Greek was no longer tedious.  Herodotus was a charming and humorous story-teller, and, as for Thucydides, his account of the Sicilian Expedition and its ending was one of the very rare things in literature which almost, if not quite, brought tears into one's eyes.  Few passages, indeed, have done that, and they are curiously discrepant.  The first book that ever made me cry, of which feat I was horribly ashamed, was \\\"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\\\" with the death of Eva, Topsy's friend.  Then it was trying when Colonel Newcome said Adsum, and the end of Socrates in the Phaedo moved one more than seemed becoming--these, and a passage in the history of Skalagrim Lamb's Tail, and, as I said, the ruin of the Athenians in the Syracusan Bay.  I have read these chapters in an old French version derived through the Italian from a Latin translation of Thucydides.  Even in this far-descended form, the tale keeps its pathos; the calm, grave stamp of that tragic telling cannot be worn away by much handling, by long time, by the many changes of human speech.  \\\"Others too,\\\" says Nicias, in that fatal speech, when -\\n\\n\\\"All was done that men may do, And all was done in vain,\\\" -\\n\\n\\\"having achieved what men may, have borne what men must.\\\"  This is the very burden of life, and the last word of tragedy.  For now all is vain:  courage, wisdom, piety, the bravery of Lamachus, the goodness of Nicias, the brilliance of Alcibiades, all are expended, all wasted, nothing of that brave venture abides, except torture, defeat, and death.  No play not poem of individual fortunes is so moving as this ruin of a people; no modern story can stir us, with all its eloquence, like the brief gravity of this ancient history. Nor can we find, at the last, any wisdom more wise than that which bids us do what men may, and bear what men must.  Such are the lessons of the Greek, of the people who tried all things, in the morning of the world, and who still speak to us of what they tried in words which are the sum of human gaiety and gloom, of grief and triumph, hope and despair.  The world, since their day, has but followed in the same round, which only seems new:  has only made the same experiments, and failed with the same failure, but less gallantly and less gloriously.\\n\\nOne's school-boy adventures among books ended not long after winning the friendship of Homer and Thucydides, of Lucretius and Catullus.  One's application was far too desultory to make a serious and accurate scholar.\\n\\n[ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/333](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/333)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639041088,\"title\":\"Few were the stragglers, following far, That reached the lake of Vennachar, And when the Brig of Turk was won\"},\"digest\":\"_ylAvLBcNjgrxoYT_736tZd01skxJQTrcWdDOJ6vAvA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x64C49f050417521e14CDAd1447c72F8234716Cd7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"yOaib18UuQtyiFn81cEdYe0Zpfv_gx9TWAF30sCk8B0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kTbiyNA4DsQz7Xf_feJ7e8DO24xtCpnBLhiDXjEYiIg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"QMuRL0tcetT-qZ_r4t2Dsx0O-lcUWZmpixRJ-aeRwPiKJznQTXfW5Qy5CHv3HP1JjcFDZw5PtBeztVTcVjYkLQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x78e6bbc0ae087e2785ce426e7ccdd5d8d236fb5b73ce6c6f72648e9a0252af1318bbbce7b9a03dec3e1f9d0ee14fff464ee59f675974f40d4963374b06034b931c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"yOaib18UuQtyiFn81cEdYe0Zpfv_gx9TWAF30sCk8B0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kTbiyNA4DsQz7Xf_feJ7e8DO24xtCpnBLhiDXjEYiIg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"_ylAvLBcNjgrxoYT_736tZd01skxJQTrcWdDOJ6vAvA\"}"
