At that time, I invested thousands of dollars in Binance to buy Dogecoin and SHIB. It is conceivable that without any experience Now, the loss is inevitable, and I didn't care about it at the time. After all, the amount is not particularly large, and it will be nothing to do with it later.\\n\\nUntil September 2021, the sky-high auction of beeple's \\\"Everyday: The First 5,000 Days\\\" NFT paintings will once again bring Crypto to the public eye. At the same time, it happens that there are friends around who have achieved financial freedom because of currency speculation, so I took With close to 60% of the net worth, he entered the currency circle impulsive.\\n\\nThe plan was good at the beginning, 60% was allocated to eth, 30% to BNB, and 10% to altcoins. As a result... I did not follow the original plan. I wandered around the recently added section of Coinmarket every day, trying to find a project that would make me rich overnight, so I followed my goddamn intuition and picked a few projects, joined their telegram group, and browsed the group at random. I saw a bunch of meme pictures, the atmosphere was very lively, so in just a few days, half of my money was exchanged for these junk altcoins. As a result, the sale of these altcoins peaked and fell one after another. The telegram group The various hanging pictures of \\\"buy the dip, to the moon\\\" in it made me unconsciously go to the bottom of it. The result was that I wanted to copy it, and it wanted to copy my home. Watching the amount in my wallet drop day by day, I was optimistic and told myself \\\"hodl, maybe it will take off\\\".\\n\\nAfter I followed some KOL tweets, I slowly learned some common sense in the currency circle, and then I realized that I didn’t know my mother who had been cut, so I gritted my teeth and endured a loss of nearly 70% in exchange for I bought USDT, and I sorted out the money in my hand at that time, only 50% of the amount when I entered the market.\\n\\nIn mid-December, I was attracted by the narrative of $People, and briefly understood the token mechanism of $People. I thought it was quite reliable, so during the huge fluctuations at the end of December, I was full of $People.\\n\\nUntil the first day I wrote the leek diary, $People cut in half, I had no choice. The ignorant are fearless, but lose money! So I decided to study the knowledge of the currency circle in the new year, which is also based on my recognition that the cryptocurrency industry has an unlimited future.\\n\\nThe chapter is over.\",\"timestamp\":1642277215,\"title\":\"Leek Diary [#1] 2022/01/16\"},\"digest\":\"kdrTboD65Pdk7NArTvqdX14OdYQGvX6H9o-n12FOxnI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa00c27ABa22B1ef0e5786DE7344442A75d1B3535\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"X9-SR6GshrMdC6JmkPkT97RaZ9Q-yf_j6oIGds1emmk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"rAcmOsIAZkLLCCT3ApoqcQyUEuvIbmhhy937QcW6VL4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"6sNTBB_PtgMfA0IYuml-1ViR0x9h3tkLitk0NcNnRx_lBrZWrF68APBvLxgYRQLx5YLcmphUtWmaTHyIfIB4VQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x11108c9d75d131d152fd64aa0e98eaf956a6f3fc2a65d1782195c71d6470a5040b03a4fa677d918118ec22107d243723869683d54cd827c6f9bfc98ce4baedbf1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"X9-SR6GshrMdC6JmkPkT97RaZ9Q-yf_j6oIGds1emmk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"rAcmOsIAZkLLCCT3ApoqcQyUEuvIbmhhy937QcW6VL4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"kdrTboD65Pdk7NArTvqdX14OdYQGvX6H9o-n12FOxnI\"}"
