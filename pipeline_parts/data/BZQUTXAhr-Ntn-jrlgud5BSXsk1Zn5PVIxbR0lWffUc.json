In case you forgot what this is all about, **[check out this post](https://mirror.xyz/thumbsupfinance.eth/utrrjpJbOtEQlYXpZGMBxh9X7iQBPBBLx9RKl-NqnNs)** ✨ Effectively this is where I share my favourite places to learn about Decentralized Finance, aka **DeFi**. There’s lots of nonsense out there, so I want to help you navigate through it so you can become an informed citizen of the cryptosphere 🌍\\n\\nWith each post we’ll explore great creators who run the gamut from beginner to advanced subject matter. I’ll give you a brief summary of who they are and why I recommend them, and I’ll **rate them on a scale from beginner to advanced** so you know which ones fit your level 👨‍🏫\\n\\nSo off we go! 🚀\\n\\n## Coin Bureau\\n\\n**Rating:** Beginner (to intermediate) 👼\\n\\nI’m really excited to share this recommendation with you because it caught me buy complete surprise. I came across **[Coin Bureau on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/CoinBureau)** multiple times before I ever clicked on a video. That’s because the video thumbnails looked like clickbait and I wasn’t interested. I now know that that is part of the humour that underlies this whole project.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*pTcANWFkuVUhiGGY.png)\\n\\nSee what I mean about thinking it was clickbait?\\n\\nEach video on the **[Coin Bureau YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/CoinBureau)** is actually a super thorough deep dive into one subject, from explaining cryptocurrency projects like **[Fantom](https://youtu.be/E-8w6NIQalA)** or **[Enjin](https://youtu.be/4ozLTBG83eE)**, to demystifying **[technical analysis (TA)](https://youtu.be/lW3eWIj3Q04)** or the **[Wyckoff Pattern](https://youtu.be/ltcnTTeDFjY)**, to explaining fundamentals like **[hardware wallets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t3Brlb0qzQ)** or **[MetaMask](https://youtu.be/MfkqgXNPiHg)**. I can honestly say, I’ve learned a ton from Coin Bureau 🙌\\n\\nWhat I like about it is that the host, Guy explains things from a fairly neutral position, weighing both pros and cons for even the projects that he himself is invested in. This is extremely uncommon in the cryptocurrency space (and the stock market investing space as well) as people often want to pump the projects they’re backing 😒\\n\\nI guess another word for that is **honesty**. And that honesty is no more clear than at the beginning of each episode when Guy finds a comical way to inform the audience that nothing he says is financial advice 🙅‍♂️ That’s a required disclaimer, but it’s also an admission that we like to hear in this industry, especially when framed in a way that doesn’t sound like a wink and a nudge, but rather an honest reminder to do your own follow-up 👌\\n\\nThe humour on the channel is right up my alley. Guy is British, and brings that quintessential dry wit to much of the commentary 🇬🇧 There’s an intelligence to it, and it’s often so subtle it doesn’t detract in any way from the quality of the information being presented.\\n\\n**And the information is dense!**\\n\\nEach of the **daily videos** is over 20 minutes long, covering all aspects of a given topic and really making an effort to explain them in the clearest terms possible. Where a subject is too complicated to explain adequately, he recommends a related video (something I’m quite fond of doing). Guy starts each week with a weekly news segment called **[This Week In Crypto](https://youtu.be/EFMn1_4nxhQ)** 📰\\n\\nLastly, there’s also a website with some pretty nice articles covering a range of topics. I liked this **[brief explanation of smart contracts](https://www.coinbureau.com/education/ethereum-smart-contracts/)** or this one about a subject that is interrelated to cryptocurrency and all facets of financial life, **[password managers](https://www.coinbureau.com/review/best-password-management-tools/)** 🔐\\n\\nThere’s honestly so much content, I can’t find a way to link to it all, but throughout this post I’ve linked several videos and articles to check out. And here’s one that you might like to check out all about the debate over Bitcoin’s energy use.\\n\\n[https://youtu.be/DidAwxWaDKI](https://youtu.be/DidAwxWaDKI)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nGuy and his team over at the Coin Bureau are making the kind of content I love: entertaining, informative, and thorough. If you like my content, I have a feeling you’ll like his. And while the videos may be long, they make great background noise if you want to passively absorb crypto knowledge 📺\\n\\nAnd if you want to actively absorb crypto content, you know where to go (hint: you’re there already) 😉\\n\\n## Links\\n\\n**[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/CoinBureau)** \\n **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/coinbureau)** \\n **[Website](https://www.coinbureau.com/)**\\n\\nWhat did you think of this recommendation? Did you check out any of the links? As we go through each issue of Rec’d, I plan to start including more and more advanced content, but to start I’m focusing on sources for those who are new to this world as that is the most crucial phase.\\n\\nUntil next time 👋 \\n Thumbs Up\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nDid you enjoy this content?
