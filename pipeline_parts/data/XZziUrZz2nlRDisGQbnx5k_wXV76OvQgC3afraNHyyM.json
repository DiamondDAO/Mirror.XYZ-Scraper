"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"as they opened the doors of the carriages one after another, very slowly as it seemed to me.  I went from carriage to carriage seeking my mother.  Had she at the last moment decided not to come!  What a trial to me if it were so!  What a night I should have to pass in all the torment of suspicions which, I knew too well, her mere presence would dispel. A voice called me.  It was hers.  Then I saw her, dressed in black, and never in my life did I clasp her in my arms as I did then, utterly forgetting that we were in a public place, and why she had come, in the joy of feeling my horrible imaginations vanish, melt away at the mere touch of the being whom I loved so profoundly, the only one who was dear to me, notwithstanding our differences, in the very depths of my heart, now that I had lost my Aunt Louise. After that first movement, which resembled the grasp in which a drowning man seizes the swimmer who dives for him, I looked at my mother without speaking, holding both her hands.  She had thrown back her veil, and in the flickering light of the station I saw that she was very pale and had been weeping.  I had only to meet her eyes, which were still wet with tears, to know that I had been mad.  I felt this, with the first words she uttered, telling me so tenderly of her grief, and that she had resolved to come at once, although my stepfather was ill.  M. Termonde had suffered of late from frequent attacks of liver-complaint. But neither her grief nor her anxiety about her husband had prevented my poor mother from providing herself, for this little excursion of a few hours, with all her customary appliances of comfort and elegance.  Her maid stood behind her, accompanied by a porter, and both were laden with three or four bags of different sizes, of the best English make, carefully buttoned up in their waterproof covers; a dressing-case, a writing-case, an elegant wallet to hold the traveler's purse, handkerchief, book, and second veil; a hot-water bottle for her feet, two cushions for her head, and a little clock suspended from a swinging disc. \\\"You see,\\\" said she, while I was pointing out the carriage to the maid, so that she might get rid of her impedimenta, \\\"I shall not have my right mourning until to-morrow\\\"--and now I perceived that her gown was dark brown and only braided with black--\\\"they could not have the things ready in time, but will send them as early as possible.\\\"  Then, as I placed her in the carriage, she added: \\\"There is still a trunk and a bonnet-box.\\\"  She half smiled in saying this, to make me smile too, for the mass of luggage and the number of small parcels with which she encumbered herself had been of old a subject of mild quarrel between us. In any other state of mind I should have been pained to find the unfailing evidence of her frivolity side by side with the mark of affection she had given me by coming.  Was not this one of the small causes of my great misery?  True, but her frivolity was delightful to me at that moment.  This then was the woman whom I had been picturing to myself as coming to the house of death, with the sinister purpose of searching my dead aunt's papers and stealing or destroying any accusing pages which she might find among them!  This was the woman whom I had represented to myself, that morning, as a criminal steeped in the guilt of a cowardly murder!  Yes! I had been mad! had been like a runaway horse galloping after its own shadow.  But what a relief to make sure that it was madness, what a blessed relief!  It almost made me forget the dear dead woman. I was very sad at heart in reality, and yet I was happy, while we were rattling through the town in the old coupe, past the long lines of lighted windows.  I held my mother's hand; I longed to beg her pardon, to kiss the hem of her dress, to tell her again and again that I loved and revered her.  She perceived my emotion very plainly; but she attributed it to the affliction that had just befallen me, and she condoled with me.  She said, \\\"My Andre,\\\" several times.  How rare it was for me to have her thus, all my own, and just in that mood of feeling for which my sick heart pined! I had had the room on the ground floor, next to the salon, prepared for my mother.  I remembered that she had occupied it, when she came to Compiegne with my father, a few days after her marriage, and I felt sure that the impression which would be produced upon her by the sight of the house in the first instance, and then by the sight of the room, would help me to get rid of my dreadful suspicions.  I was determined to note minutely the slightest signs of agitation which she might betray at the contact of a resuscitated past, rendered more striking by the aspect of things that do not change so quickly as the heart of a woman.  And now, I blushed for that idea, worthy of a detective; for I felt it a shameful thing to judge one's mother: one ought to make an Act of Faith in her which would resist any evidence.  I felt this, alas! all the more, because the innocent woman was quite off her guard, as was perfectly natural. She entered the room with a thoughtful look, seated herself before the fire, and held her slender feet towards the flames, which touched her pale cheeks with red; and, with her jet black hair, her elegant figure, which still retained its youthful grace, she shed upon the dim twilight of the old-fashioned room that refined and aristocratic charm of which my father spoke in his letters.  She looked slowly all around her, recognizing most of the things which my aunt's pious care had preserved in their former place, and said, sorrowfully: \\\"What recollections!\\\"  But there was no bitterness in the emotion depicted on her face.  Ah! no; a woman who is brought, after twenty years, into the room which she had occupied, as a bride, with the husband whose murder she had contrived after having betrayed him, has not such eyes, such a brow, such a mouth as hers.\\n\\nVIII\\n\\nThere was but one remedy to be applied to my unbearable malady-- that remedy which had already been successful in the case of my suspicions of my mother.  I must at once proceed to place the real in opposition to the suggestions of imagination.  I must seek the presence of the man whom I suspected, look him straight in the face, and see him as he was, not as my fancy, growing more feverish day by day, represented him.  Then I should discern whether I had or had not been the sport of a delusion; and the sooner I resorted to this test the better, for my sufferings were terribly increased by solitude. My head became confused; at last I ceased even to doubt.  That which ought to have been only a faint indication, assumed to my mind the importance of an overwhelming proof.  In the interest of my inquiry itself it was full time to resist this, if I were ever to pursue my inquiry farther, or else I should fall into the nervous state which I knew so well, and which rendered any kind of action in cold blood impossible to me. I made up my mind to leave Compiegne, see my stepfather, and form my judgment of whether there was or was not anything in my suspicions upon the first effect produced on him by my sudden and unexpected appearance before him.  I founded this hope on an argument which I had already used in the case of my mother, namely, that if M. Termonde had really been concerned in the assassination of my father, he had dreaded my aunt's penetration beyond all things.  Their relations had been formal, with an undercurrent of enmity on her part which had assuredly not escaped a man so astute as he.  If he were guilty, would he not have feared that my aunt would have confided her thoughts to me on her death-bed?  The attitude that he should assume towards me, at and after our first interview, would be a proof, complete in proportion to its suddenness, and he must have no time for preparation. I returned to Paris, therefore, without having informed even my valet of my intention, and proceeded almost immediately to my mother's hotel. I rang the bell. The door was opened, and the narrow court, the glass porch, the red carpet of the staircase, were before me.  The concierge, who saluted me, was not he by whom I had fancied myself slighted in my childhood; but the old valet de chambre who opened the door to me was the same.  His close-shaven face wore its former impassive expression, the look that used to convey to me such an impression of insult and insolence when I came home from school.  What childish absurdity! To my question the man replied that my mother was in, also H. Termonde, and Madame Bernard, a friend of theirs.  The latter name brought me back at once to the reality of the situation.  Madame Bernard was a prettyish woman, very slight and very dark, with a \\\"tip-tilted\\\" nose, frizzy hair worn low upon her forehead, very white teeth which were continually shown by a constant smile, a short upper lip, and all the manners and ways of a woman of society well up to its latest gossip.  I fell at once from my fancied height as an imaginary Grand Judiciary into the shallows of Parisian frivolity.  I felt about to hear chatter upon the last new play, the latest suit for separation, the latest love affairs, and the newest bonnet.  It was for this that I had eaten my heart out all these days! The servant preceded me to the hall I knew so well, with its Oriental divan, its green plants, its strange furniture, its slightly faded carpet, its Meissonier on a draped easel, in the place formerly occupied by my father's portrait, its crowd of ornamental trifles, and the wide-spreading Japanese parasol open in the middle of the ceiling.  The walls were hung with large pieces of Chinese stuff embroidered in black and white silk.  My mother was half-reclining in an American rocking-chair, and shading her face from the fire with a hand-screen; Madame Bernard, who sat opposite to her, was holding her muff with one hand and gesticulating with the other; M. Termonde, in walking-dress, was standing with his back to the chimney, smoking a cigar, and warming the sole of one of his boots. On my appearance, my mother uttered a little cry of glad surprise, and rose to welcome me.  Madame Bernard instantly assumed the air with which a well-bred woman prepares to condole with a person of her acquaintance upon a bereavement.  All these little details I perceived in a moment, and also the shrug of M. Termonde's shoulders, the quick flutter of his eyelids, the rapidly-dismissed expression of disagreeable surprise which my sudden appearance called forth.  But what then?  Was it not the same with myself?  I could have sworn that at the same moment he experienced sensations exactly similar to those which were catching me at the chest and by the throat.  What did this prove but that a current of antipathy existed between him and me?  Was it a reason for the man's being a murderer?  He was simply my stepfather, and a stepfather who did not like his stepson. Matters had stood thus for years, and yet, after the week of miserable suspicion I had lived through, the quick look and shrug struck me strangely, even while I took his hand after I had kissed my mother and saluted Madame Bernard.  His hand?  No, only his finger tips as usual, and they trembled a little as I touched them. How often had my own hand shrunk with unconquerable repugnance from that contact!  I listened while he repeated the same phrases of sympathy with my sorrow which he had already written to me while I was at Compiegne.  I listened while Madame Bernard uttered other phrases to the same effect; and then the conversation resumed its course, and, during the half-hour that ensued, I looked on, speaking hardly at all, but mentally comparing the physiognomy of my stepfather with that of the visitor, and that of my mother.  The contemplation of those three faces produced a curious impression upon me; it was that of their difference, not only of age, but of intensity, of depth.  There was no mystery in my mother's face, it was as easy to read as a page in dear handwriting!  The mind of Madame Bernard, a worldly, trumpery, poor mind, but harmless enough, was readily to be discerned in her features which were at once refined and commonplace.  How little there was of reflection, of decision, of exercise of will, in short of individuality, behind the poetic grace of the one and the pretty affectations of the other!  What a face, on the contrary, was that of my stepfather, with its strong individuality, and its vivid expression!  In this man of the world, as he stood there talking with two women of the world, in his blue, furtive eyes, too wide apart, and always seeming to shun observation, in his prematurely gray hair, his mouth set round with deep wrinkles, in his dark, blotched, bilious complexion, there seemed to be a creature of another race.  What passions had worn those furrows? what vigils had hollowed those eyeballs?  Was this the face of a happy man, with whom everything had succeeded, who, having been born to wealth and of an excellent family, had married the woman he loved; who had known neither the wearing cares of ambition, the toil of money-getting, nor the stings of wounded self-love?  It is true, he suffered from liver complaint; but why was it that, although I had hitherto been satisfied with this answer, it now appeared to me childish and even foolish?  Why did all these marks of trouble and exhaustion suddenly strike me as effects of a secret cause, and why was I astonished that I had not sooner sought for it?  Why was it that in his presence, contrary to my expectations, contrary to what had happened about my mother, I was plunged more deeply into the gulf of suspicion from which I had hoped to emerge with a free mind? Why, when our eyes met for just one second, was I afraid that he might read my thoughts in my glance, and why did I shift them with a pang of shame and terror?  Ah! coward that I was, triple coward! Either I was wrong to think thus, and at any price I must know that I was wrong; or, I was right and I must know that too.  The sole resource henceforth remaining to me for the preservation of my self-respect was ardent and ceaseless search after certainty. That such a search was beset with difficulty I was well aware.  How was I to get at facts?  The very position of the problem which I had before me forbade all hope of discovering anything whatsoever by a formal inquiry.  What, in fact, was the matter in question? It was to make myself certain whether M. Termonde was or was not the accomplice of the man who had led my father into the trap in which he had lost his life.  But I did not know that man himself; I had no data to go upon except the particulars of his disguise and the vague speculations of a Judge of Instruction.  If I could only have consulted that Judge, and availed myself of his experience? How often since have I taken out the packet containing the denunciatory letters, with the intention of showing them to him and imploring advice, support, suggestions, from him.  But I have always stopped short before the door of his house; the thought of my mother barred its entrance against me.  What if he, the Judge of Instruction in the case, were to suspect her as my aunt had done? Then I would go back to my own abode, and shut myself up for hours, lying on the divan in my smoking-room and drugging my senses with tobacco.  During that time I read and re-read the fatal letters, although I knew them by heart, in order to verify my first impression with the hope of dispelling it.  It was, on the contrary, deepened.  The only gain I obtained from my repeated perusals was the knowledge that this certainty, of which I had made a point of honor to myself, could only be psychological.  In short, all my fancies started from the moral data of the crime, apart from physical data which I could not obtain.  I was therefore obliged to rely entirely, absolutely, upon those moral data, and I began again to reason as I had done at Compiegne.  \\\"Supposing,\\\" said I to myself, \\\"that M. Termonde is guilty, what state of mind must he be in?  This state of mind being once ascertained, how can I act so as to wrest some sign of his guilt from him?\\\"  As to his state of mind I had no doubt.  Ill and depressed as I knew him to be, his mind troubled to the point of torment, if that suffering, that gloom, that misery were accompanied by the recollection of a murder committed in the past, the man was the victim of secret remorse. The point was then to invent a plan which should give, as it were, a form to his remorse, to raise the specter of the deed he had done roughly and suddenly before him.  If guilty, it was impossible but that he would tremble; if innocent, he would not even be aware of the experiment.  But how was this sudden summoning-up of his crime before the man whom I suspected to be accomplished?  On the stage and in novels one confronts an assassin with the spectacle of his crime, and keeps watch upon his face for the one second during which he loses his self-possession; but in reality there is no instrument except unwieldy, unmanageable speech wherewith to probe a human conscience.  I could not, however, go straight to M. Termonde and say to his face: \\\"You had my father killed!\\\"  Innocent or guilty, he would have had me turned from the door as a madman! After several hours of reflection, I came to the conclusion that only one plan was reasonable, and available: this was to have a private talk with my stepfather at a moment when he would least expect it, an interview in which all should be hints, shades, double meanings, in which each word should be like the laying of a finger upon the sorest spots in his breast, if indeed his reflections were those of a murderer. Every sentence of mine must be so contrived as to force him to ask himself: \\\"Why does he say this to me if he knows nothing?  He does know something.  How much does he know?\\\" So well acquainted was I with every physical trait of his, the slightest variations of his countenance, his simplest gestures, that no sign of disturbance on his part, however slight, could escape me.  If I did not succeed in discovering the seat of the malady by this process, I should be convinced of the baselessness of those suspicions which were constantly springing up afresh in my mind since the death of my aunt.  I would then admit the simple and probable explanation--nothing in my father's letters discredited it--that M. Termonde had loved my mother without hope in the lifetime of her first husband, and had then profited by her widowhood, of which he had not even ventured to think. If, on the contrary, I observed during our interview that he was alive to my suspicions, that he divined them, and anxiously followed my words; if I surprised that swift gleam in his eye which reveals the instinctive terror of an animal, attacked at the moment of its fancied security, if the experiment succeeded, then--then--I dared not think of what then? The mere possibility was too overwhelming. But should I have the strength to carry on such a conversation?  At the mere thought of it my heart-beats were quickened, and my nerves thrilled.  What! this was the first opportunity that had been offered to me of action, of devoting myself to the task of vengeance, so coveted, so fully accepted during all my early years, and I could hesitate? Happily, or unhappily, I had near me a counsellor stronger than my doubts, my father's portrait, which was hung in my smoking-room. When I awoke in the night and plunged into those thoughts, I would light my candle and go to look at the picture.  How like we were to each other, my father and I, although I was more slightly built! How exactly the same we were!  How near to me I felt him, and how dearly I loved him!  With what emotion I studied those features, the lofty forehead, the brown eyes, the rather large mouth, the rather long chin, the mouth especially half-hidden by a black moustache cut like my own; it had no need to open, and cry out: \\\"Andre, Andre, remember me!\\\"  Ah, no, my dear dead father, I could not leave you thus, without having done my utmost to avenge you, and it was only an interview to be faced, only an interview! My nervousness gave way to determination at once feverish and fixed--yes, it was both--and it was in a mood of perfect self- mastery, that, after a long period of mental conflict, I repaired to the hotel on the boulevard, with the plan of my discourse clearly laid out.  I felt almost sure of finding my stepfather alone; for my mother was to breakfast on that day with Madame Bernard.  M. Termonde was at home, and, as I expected, alone in his study. When I entered the room, he was sitting in a low chair, close to the fire, looking chilly, and smoking.  Like myself in my dark hours, he drugged himself with tobacco.  The room was a large one, and both luxurious and ordinary.  A handsome bookcase lined one of the walls.  Its contents were various, ranging from grave works on history and political economy, to the lightest novels of the day. A large, flat writing-table, on which every kind of writing- material was carefully arranged, occupied the middle of the room, and was adorned with photographs in plain leather cases.  These were portraits of my mother and M. Termonde's father and mother. At least one prominent trait of its owner's character, his scrupulous attention to order and correctness of detail, was revealed by the aspect of my stepfather's study; but this quality, which is common to so many persons of his position in the world, may belong to the most commonplace character as well as to the most refined hypocrite.  It was not only in the external order and bearing of his life that my stepfather was impenetrable, none could tell whether profound thoughts were or were not hidden behind his politeness and elegance of manner.  I had often reflected on this, at a period when as yet I had no stronger motive for examining into the recesses of the man's character than curiosity, and the impression came to me with extreme intensity at the moment when I entered his presence with a firm resolve to read in the book of his past life. We shook hands, I took a seat opposite to his on the other side of the hearth, lighted a cigar, and said, as if to explain my unaccustomed presence: \\\"Mamma is not here?\\\" \\\"Did she not tell you, the other day, that she was to breakfast with Madame Bernard?  There's an expedition to Lozano's studio\\\" (Lozano was a Spanish painter much in vogue just then), \\\"to see a portrait he is painting of Madame Bernard.  Is there anything you want to have told to your mother?\\\" he added, simply. These few words were sufficient to show me that he had remarked the singularity of my visit.  Ought I to regret or to rejoice at this? He was, then, already aware that I had some particular motive for coming; but this very fact would give all their intended weight to my words.  I began by turning the conversation on an indifferent matter, talking of the painter Lozano and a good picture of his which I knew, \\\"A Gipsy-dance in a Tavern-yard at Grenada.\\\" I described the bold attitudes, the pale complexions, the Moorish faces of the \\\"gitanas,\\\" and the red carnations stuck into the heavy braids of their black hair, and I questioned him about Spain. He answered me, but evidently out of mere politeness. While continuing to smoke his cigar, he raked the fire with the tongs, taking up one small piece of charred wood after another between their points.  By the quivering of his fingers, the only sign of his nervous sensitiveness which he was unable entirely to keep down, I could observe that my presence was then, as it always was, disagreeable to him.  Nevertheless he talked on with his habitual courtesy, in his low voice, almost without tone or accent, as though he had trained himself to talk thus.  His eyes were fixed on the flame, and his face, which I saw in profile, wore the expression of infinite weariness that I knew well, in indescribable stillness and sadness, with long deep lines, and the mouth was contracted as though by some bitter thought ever present. Suddenly, I looked straight at that detested profile, concentrating all the attention I had in me upon it, and, passing from one subject to another without transition, I said: \\\"I paid a very interesting visit this morning.\\\" \\\"In that you are agreeably distinguished from me,\\\" was his reply, made in a tone of utter indifference, \\\"for I wasted my morning in putting my correspondence in order.\\\" \\\"Yes,\\\" I continued, \\\"very interesting.  I passed two hours with M. Massol.\\\" I had reckoned a good deal on the effect of this name, which must have instantly recalled the inquiry into the mystery of the Imperial Hotel to his memory.  The muscles of his face did not move.  He laid down the tongs, leaned back in his chair, and said in an absent manner: \\\"The former Judge of Instruction?  What is he doing now?\\\" Was it possible that he really did not know where the man, whom, if he were guilty, he ought to have dreaded most of all men, was then living?  How was I to know whether this indifference was feigned? The trap I had set appeared to me all at once a childish notion. Admitting that my stepfather's pulses were even now throbbing with fever, and that he was saying to himself with dread: \\\"What is he coming to?  What does he mean?\\\" why, this was a reason why he should conceal his emotion all the more carefully.  No matter.  I had begun; I was bound to go on, and to hit hard. \\\"M. Massol is Counsellor to the Court,\\\" I replied, and I added-- although this was not true--\\\"I see him often.  We were talking this morning of criminals who have escaped punishment.  Only fancy his being convinced that Troppman had an accomplice.  He founds his belief on the details of the crime, which presuppose two men, he says.  If this be true it must be admitted that 'Messieurs les assassins' have a kind of honor of their own, however odd that may appear, since the child-killing monster let his own head be cut off without denouncing the other.  Nevertheless, the accomplice must have put some bad time over him, after the discovery of the bodies and the arrest of his comrade.  I, for my part, would not trust to that honor, and if the humor took me to commit a crime, I should do it by myself.  Would you?\\\" I asked jestingly. These two little words meant nothing, were merely an insignificant jest, if the man to whom I put my odd question was innocent.  But, if he were guilty, those two little words were enough to freeze the marrow in his bones.  He surrounded himself with smoke while listening to me, his eye-lids half veiled his eyes; I could no longer see his left hand, which hung over the far side of his chair, and he had put the right into the pocket of his morning- coat.  There was a short pause before he answered me--very short-- but the interval, perhaps a minute, that divided his reply from my question, was a burning one for me.  But what of this?  It was not his way to speak in a hurry; and besides, my question had nothing interesting in it if he were not guilty, and if he were, would he not have to calculate the bearing of the phrase which he was about to utter with the quickness of thought?  He closed his eyes completely--his constant habit--and said, in the unconcerned tone of a man who is talking generalities: \\\"It is a fact that scraps of conscience do remain intact in very depraved individuals.  One sees instances of this especially in countries where habits and morals are more genuine and true to nature than ours.  There's Spain, for instance, the country that interests you so much; when I lived in Spain, it was still infested by brigands.  One had to make treaties with them in order to cross the Sierras in safety; there was no case known in which they broke the contract.  The history of celebrated criminal cases swarms with scoundrels who have been excellent friends, devoted sons, and constant lovers.  But I am of your opinion, and I think it is best not to count too much upon them.\\\" He smiled as he uttered the last words, and now he looked full at me with those light blue eyes which were so mysterious and impassible.  No, I was not of stature to cope with him, to read his heart by force.  It needed capacity of another kind than mine to play in the case of this personage the part of the magnate of police who magnetizes a criminal.  And yet, why did my suspicions gather force as I felt the masked, dissimulating, guarded nature of the man in all its strength?  Are there not natures so constituted that they shut themselves up without cause, just as others reveal themselves; are there not souls that love darkness as others love daylight?  Courage, then, let me strike again. \\\"M. Massol and I,\\\" I resumed, \\\"have been talking about what kind of life Troppmann's accomplice must be leading; and also Rochdale's; for neither of us has relinquished the intention of finding him. Before M. Massol's retirement he took the precaution to bar the limitation by a formal notice, and we have several years before us in which to search for the man.  Do these criminals sleep in peace? Are they punished by remorse, or by the apprehension of danger, even in their momentary security?  It would be strange if they were both at this moment good, quiet citizens, smoking their cigars like you and me, loved and loving.  Do you believe in remorse?\\\" \\\"Yes, I do believe in remorse,\\\" he answered. Was it the contrast between the affected levity of my speech, and the seriousness with which he had spoken, that caused his voice to sound grave and deep to my ears?  No, no; I was deceiving myself, for without a thrill he had heard the news that the limitation had been barred, that the case might be reopened any day--terrible news for him if he were mixed up with the murder--and he added, calmly, referring to the philosophic side of my question only: \\\"And does M. Massol believe in remorse?\\\" \\\"M. Massol,\\\" said I, \\\"is a cynic.  He has seen too much wickedness, known too many terrible stories.  He says that remorse is a question of stomach and religious education, and that a man with a sound digestion, who had never heard anything about hell in his childhood, might rob and kill from morning to night without feeling any other remorse than fear of the police.  He also maintains, being a sceptic, that we do not know what part that question of the other life plays in solitude; and I think he is right, for I often begin to think of death, at night, and I am afraid;-- yes, I, who don't believe in anything very much, am afraid.  And you,\\\" I continued, \\\"do you believe in another world?\\\" \\\"Yes.\\\"  This time I was sure that there was an alteration in his voice. \\\"And in the justice of God?\\\" \\\"In His justice and His mercy,\\\" he answered, in a strange tone. \\\"Singular justice,\\\" I said vehemently, \\\"which is able to do everything, and yet delays to punish!  My poor aunt used always to say to me when I talked to her about avenging my father: 'I leave it to God to punish,' but, for my part, if I had got hold of the murderer, and he was there before me--if I were sure--no, I would not wait for the hour of that tardy justice of God.\\\" I had risen while uttering these words, carried away by involuntary excitement which I knew to be unwise.  M. Termonde had bent over the fire again, and once more taken up the tongs.  He made no answer to my outburst.  Had he really felt some slight disturbance, as I believed for an instant, at hearing me speak of that inevitable and dreadful morrow of the grave which fills myself with such fear now that there is blood upon my hands? I could not tell.  His profile was, as usual, calm and sad. The restlessness of his hands--recalling to my mind the gesture with which he turned and returned his cane while my mother was telling him of the disappearance of my father--yes, the restlessness of his hands was extreme; but he had been working at the fire with the same feverish eagerness just before.  Silence had fallen between us suddenly; but how often had the same thing happened?  Did it ever fail to happen when he and I were in each other's company?  And then, what could he have to say against the outburst of my grief and wrath, orphan that I was?  Guilty or innocent, it was for him to be silent, and he held his peace.  My heart sank; but, at the same time, a senseless rage seized upon me. At that moment I would have given my remaining life for the power of forcing their secret from those shut lips, by any mode of torture. My stepfather looked at the clock--he, too, had risen now--and said: \\\"Shall I put you down anywhere?  I have ordered the carriage for three o'clock, as I have to be at the club at half-past. There's a ballot coming off tomorrow.\\\"  Instead of the down- stricken criminal I had dreamed of, there stood before me a man of society thinking about the affairs of his club.  He came with me so far as the hall, and took leave of me with a smile. Why, then, a quarter of an hour afterwards, when we passed each other on the quay, I going homeward on foot, he in his coupe--yes-- why was his face so transformed, so dark and tragic?  He did not see me.  He was sitting back in the corner, and his clay-colored face was thrown out by the green leather behind his head.  His eyes were looking--where, and at what?  The vision of distress that passed before me was so different from the smiling countenance of a while ago that it shook me from head to foot with an extraordinary emotion, and forced me to exclaim, as though frightened at my own success: \\\"Have I struck home?\\\"\\n\\nIX\\n\\nThis impression of dread kept hold of me during the whole of that evening, and for several days afterwards.  There is an infinite distance between our fancies, however precise they may be, and the least bit of reality. My father's letters had stirred my being to its utmost depths, had summoned up tragic pictures before my eyes; but the simple fact of my having seen the agonized look in my stepfather's face, after my interview with him, gave me a shock of an entirely different kind. Even after I had read the letters repeatedly, I had cherished a secret hope that I was mistaken, that some slight proof would arise and dispel suspicions which I denounced as senseless, perhaps because I had a foreknowledge of the dreadful duty that would devolve upon me when the hour of certainty had come.  Then I should be obliged to act on a resolution, and I dared not look the necessity in the face.  No, I had not so regarded it, previous to my meeting with my enemy, when I saw him cowering in anguish upon the cushions of his carriage.  Now I would force myself to contemplate it.  What should my course be, if he were guilty?  I put this question to myself plainly, and I perceived all the horror of the situation.  On whatever side I turned I was confronted with intolerable misery. That things should remain as they were I could not endure.  I saw my mother approach M. Termonde, as she often did, and touch his forehead caressingly with her hand or her lips.  That she should do this to the murderer of my father!  My very bones burned at the mere thought of it, and I felt as though an arrow pierced my breast.  So be it!  I would act; I would find strength to go to my mother and say: \\\"This man is an assassin,\\\" and prove it to her--and lo!  I was already shrinking from the pain that my words must inflict on her.  It seemed to me that while I was speaking I should see her eyes open wide, and, through the distended pupils, discern the rending asunder of her being, even to her heart, and that she would go mad or fall down dead on the spot, before my eyes.  No, I would speak to her myself.  If I held the convincing proof in my hands I would appeal to justice. But then a new scene arose before me.  I pictured my mother at the moment of her husband's arrest.  She would be there, in the room, close to him.  \\\"Of what crime is he accused?\\\" she would ask, and she would have to hear the inevitable answer.  And I should be the voluntary cause of this, I, who, since my childhood, and to spare her a pang, had stifled all my complaints at the time when my heart was laden with so many sighs, so many tears, so much sorrow, that it would have been a supreme relief to have poured them out to her. I had not done so then, because I knew that she was happy in her life, and that it was her happiness only that blinded her to my pain.  I preferred that she should be blind and happy.  And now? Ah! how could I strike her such a cruel blow, dear and fragile being that she was? The first glimpse of the double prospect of misery which my future offered if my suspicions proved just was too terrible for endurance, and I summoned all my strength of will to shut out a vision which must bring about such consequences.  Contrary to my habit, I persuaded myself into a happy solution.  My stepfather looked sad when he passed me in his coupe; true, but what did this prove?  Had he not many causes of care and trouble, beginning with his health, which was failing from day to day? One fact only would have furnished me with absolute, indisputable proof; if he had been shaken by a nervous convulsion while we were talking, if I had seen him (as Hamlet, my brother in anguish, saw his uncle) start up with distorted face, before the suddenly-evoked specter of his crime.  Not a muscle of his face had moved, not an eyelash had quivered;--why, then, should I set down this untroubled calm to amazing hypocrisy, and take the discomposure of his countenance half an hour later for a revelation of the truth?  This was just reasoning, or at least it appears so to me, now that I am writing down my recollections in cold blood.  They did not prevail against the sort of fatal instinct which forced me to follow this trail.  Yes, it was absurd, it was mad, gratuitously to imagine that M. Termonde had employed another person to murder my father; yet I could not prevent myself constantly admitting that this most unlikely suggestion of my fancy was possible, and sometimes that it was certain. When a man has given place in his mind to ideas of this kind he is no longer his own master; either he is a coward, or the thing must be fought out.  It was due to my father, my mother, and myself that I should KNOW. I walked about my rooms for hours, revolving these thoughts, and more than once I took up a pistol, saying to myself: \\\"Just a touch, a slight movement like this\\\"--I made the gesture--\\\"and I am cured forever of my mortal pain.\\\"  But the very handling of the weapon, the touch of the smooth barrel, reminded me of the mysterious scene of my father's death.  It called up before me the sitting-room in the Imperial Hotel, the disguised man waiting, my father coming in, taking a seat at the table, turning over the papers laid before him, while a pistol, like this one in my hand, was levelled at him, close to the back of his neck; and then the fatal crack of the weapon, the head dropping down upon the table, the murderer wrapping the bleeding neck in towels and washing his hands, coolly, leisurely, as though he had just completed some ordinary task.  The picture roused in me a raging thirst for vengeance.  I approached the portrait of the dead man, which looked at me with its motionless eyes.  What!  I had my suspicions of the instigator of this murder, and I would leave them unverified because I was afraid of what I should have to do afterwards!  No, no; at any price, I must in the first place know! Three days elapsed.  I was suffering tortures of irresolution, mingled with incoherent projects no sooner formed than they were rejected as impracticable.  To know?--this was easily said, but I, who was so eager, nervous, and excitable, so little able to restrain my quickly-varying emotions, would never be able to extort his secret from so resolute a man, one so completely master of himself as my stepfather.  My consciousness of his strength and my weakness made me dread his presence as much as I desired it.  I was like a novice in arms who was about to fight a duel with a very skillful adversary; he desires to defend himself and to be victorious, but he is doubtful of his own coolness.  What was I to do now, when I had struck a first blow and it had not been decisive?  If our interview had really told upon his conscience, how was I to proceed to the redoubling of the first effect, to the final reduction of that proud spirit? My reflections had arrived and stopped at this point, I was forming and re-forming plans only to abandon them, when a note reached me from my mother, complaining that I had not gone to her house since the day on which I had missed seeing her, and telling me that my stepfather had been very ill indeed two days previously with his customary liver complaint. Two days previously, that was on the day after my conversation with him. Here again it might be said that fate was making sport of me, redoubling the ambiguity of the signs, the chief cause of my despair.  Was the imminence of this attack explanatory of the agonized expression on my stepfather's face when he passed me in his carriage?  Was it a cause, or merely the effect of the terror by which he had been assailed, if he was guilty, under his mask of indifference, while I flung my menacing words in his face?  Oh, how intolerable was this uncertainty, and my mother increased it, when I went to her, by her first words. \\\"This,\\\" she said, \\\"is the second attack he has had in two months; they have never come so near together until now.  What alarms me most is the strength of the doses of morphine he takes to lull the pain.  He has never been a sound sleeper, and for some years he has not slept one single night without having recourse to narcotics; but he used to be moderate--whereas, now--\\\" She shook her head dejectedly, poor woman, and I, instead of compassionating her sorrow, was conjecturing whether this, too, was not a sign, whether the man's sleeplessness did not arise from terrible, invincible remorse, or whether it also could be merely the result of illness. \\\"Would you like to see him?\\\" asked my mother, almost timidly, and as I hesitated she added, under the impression that I was afraid of fatiguing him, whereas I was much surprised by the proposal, \\\"he asked to see you himself; he wants to hear the news from you about yesterday's ballot at the club.\\\"  Was this the real motive of a desire to see me, which I could not but regard as singular, or did he want to prove that our interview had left him wholly unmoved? Was I to interpret the message which he had sent me by my mother as an additional sign of the extreme importance that he attached to the details of \\\"society\\\" life, or was he, apprehending my suspicions, forestalling them?  Or, yet again, was he, too, tortured by the desire TO KNOW, by the urgent need of satisfying his curiosity by the sight of my face, whereon he might decipher my thoughts? I entered the room--it was the same that had been mine when I was a child, but I had not been inside its door for years--in a state of mind similar to that in which I had gone to my former interview with him.  I had, however, no hope now that M. Termonde would be brought to his knees by my direct allusion to the hideous crime of which I imagined him to be guilty.  My stepfather occupied the room as a sleeping-apartment when he was ill, ordinarily he only dressed there.  The walls, hung with dark green damask, ill-lighted by one lamp, with a pink shade, placed upon a pedestal at some distance from the bed, to avoid fatigue to the sick man's eyes, had for their only ornament a likeness of my mother by Bonnat, one of his first female portraits.  The picture was hung between the two windows, facing the bed, so that M. Termonde, when he slept in that room, might turn his last look at night and his first look in the morning upon the face whose long-descended beauty the painter had very finely rendered.  No less finely had he conveyed the something half-theatrical which characterized that face, the slightly affected set of the mouth, the far-off look in the eyes, the elaborate arrangement of the hair. First, I looked at this portrait; it confronted me on entering the room; then my glance fell on my stepfather in the bed.  His head, with its white hair, and his thin yellow face were supported by the large pillows, round his neck was tied a handkerchief of pale blue silk which I recognized, for I had seen it on my mother's neck, and I also recognized the red woollen coverlet that she had knitted for him; it was exactly the same as one she had made for me; a pretty bit of woman's work on which I had seen her occupied for hours, ornamented with ribbons and lined with silk.  Ever and always the smallest details were destined to renew that impression of a shared interest in my mother's life from which I suffered so much, and more cruelly than ever now, by reason of my suspicion. I felt that my looks must needs betray the tumult of such feelings, and, while I seated myself by the side of the bed, and asked my stepfather how he was, in a voice that sounded to me like that of another person, I avoided meeting his eyes. My mother had gone out immediately after announcing me, to attend to some small matters relative to the well-being of her dear invalid.  My stepfather questioned me upon the ballot at the club which he had assigned as a pretext for his wish to see me.  I sat with my elbow on the marble top of the table and my forehead resting in my hand; although I did not catch his eye I felt that he was studying my face, and I persisted in looking fixedly into the half-open drawer where a small pocket-pistol, of English make, lay side by side with his watch, and a brown silk purse, also made for him by my mother.  What were the dark misgivings revealed by the presence of this weapon placed within reach of his hand and probably habitually placed there?  Did he interpret my thoughts from my steady observation?  Or had he, too, let his glance fall by chance upon the pistol, and was he pursuing the ideas that it suggested in order to keep up the talk it was always so difficult to maintain between us?  The fact is that he said, as though replying to the question in my mind: \\\"You are looking at that pistol, it is a pretty thing, is it not?\\\"  He took it up, turned in about in his hand, and then replaced it in the drawer, which he closed.  \\\"I have a strange fancy, quite a mania; I could not sleep unless I had a loaded pistol there, quite close to me.  After all, it is a habit which does no harm to anyone, and might have its advantages.  If your poor father had carried a weapon like that upon him when he went to the Imperial Hotel, things would not have gone so easily with the assassin.\\\" This time I could not refrain from raising my eyes and seeking his. How, if he were guilty, did he dare to recall this remembrance? Why, if he were not, did his glance sink before mine?  Was it merely in following out an association of ideas that he referred thus to the death of my father; was it for the purpose of displaying his entire unconcern respecting the subject-matter of our last interview; or was he using a probe to discover the depth of my suspicion?  After this allusion to the mysterious murder which had made me fatherless, he went on to say: \\\"And, by-the-bye, have you seen M. Massol again?\\\" \\\"No,\\\" said I, \\\"not since the other day.\\\" \\\"He is a very intelligent man.  At the time of that terrible affair, I had a great deal of talk with him, in my capacity as the intimate friend of both your father and mother.  If I had known that you were in the habit of seeing him latterly, I should have asked you to convey my kind regards.\\\" \\\"He has not forgotten you,\\\" I answered.  In this I lied; for M. Massol had never spoken of my stepfather to me; but that frenzy which had made me attack him almost madly in the conversation of the other evening had seized upon me again.  Should I never find the vulnerable spot in that dark soul for which I was always looking?  This time his eyes did not falter, and whatever there was of the enigmatical in what I had said, did not lead him to question me farther.  On the contrary, he put his finger on his lips.  Used as he was to all the sounds of the house, he had heard a step approaching, and knew it was my mother's. Did I deceive myself, or was there an entreaty that I would respect the unsuspecting security of an innocent woman in the gesture by which he enjoined silence? Was I to translate the look that accompanied the sign into: \\\"Do not awaken suspicion in your mother's mind, she would suffer too much;\\\" and was his motive merely the solicitude of a man who desires to save his wife from the revival of a sad remembrance. She came in; with the same glance she saw us both, lighted by the same ray from the lamp, and she gave us a smile, meant for both of us in common, and fraught with the same tenderness for each.  It had been the dream of her life that we should be together thus, and both of us with her, and, as she had told me at Compiegne, she imputed the obstacles which had hindered the realization of her dream to my moody disposition.  She came towards us, smiling, and carrying a silver tray with a glass of Vichy water upon it; this she held out to my stepfather, who drank the water eagerly, and, returning the glass to her, kissed her hand. \\\"Let us leave him to rest,\\\" she said, \\\"his head is burning.\\\" Indeed, in merely touching the tips of his fingers, which he placed in mine, I could feel that he was highly feverish; but how was I to interpret this symptom, which was ambiguous like all the others, and might, like them, signify either moral or physical distress?  I had sworn to myself that I would KNOW; but how? how? I had been surprised by my stepfather's having expressed a wish to see me during his illness; but I was far more surprised when, a fortnight later, my servant announced M. Termonde in person, at my abode.  I was in my study, and occupied in arranging some papers of my father's which I had brought up from Compiegne.  I had passed these two weeks at my poor aunt's house, making a pretext of a final settlement of affairs, but in reality because I needed to reflect at leisure upon the course to be taken with respect to M. Termonde, and my reflections had increased my doubts.  At my request, my mother had written to me three times, giving me news of the patient, so that I was aware he was now better and able to go out.  On my return, the day before, I had selected a time at which I was almost sure not to see anyone for my visit to my mother's home.  And now, here was my stepfather, who had not been inside my door ten times since I had been installed in an apartment of my own, paying me a visit without the loss of an hour.  My mother, he said, had sent him with a message to me.  She had lent me two numbers of a review, and she now wanted them back as she was sending the yearly volume to be bound; so, as he was passing the door, he had stepped in to ask me for them.  I examined him closely while he was giving this simple explanation of his visit, without being able to decide whether the pretext did or did not conceal his real motive.  His complexion was more sallow than usual, the look in his eyes was more glittering, he handled his hat nervously. \\\"The reviews are not here,\\\" I answered; \\\"we shall probably find them in the smoking-room.\\\" It was not true that the two numbers were not there; I knew their exact place on the table in my study; but my father's portrait hung in the smoking-room, and the notion of bringing M. Termonde face to face with the picture, to see how he would bear the confrontation, had occurred to me.  At first he did not observe the portrait at all; but I went to the side of the room on which the easel supporting it stood, and his eyes, following all my movements, encountered it.  His eyelids opened and closed rapidly, and a sort of dark thrill passed over his face; then he turned his eyes carelessly upon another little picture hanging upon the wall.  I did not give him time to recover from the shock; but, in pursuance of the almost brutal method from which I had hitherto gained so little, I persisted: \\\"Do you not think,\\\" said I, \\\"that my father's portrait is strikingly like me?  A friend of mine was saying the other day that, if I had my hair cut in the same way, my head would be exactly like--\\\" He looked first at me, and then at the picture, in the most leisurely way, like an expert in painting examining a work of art, without any other motive than that of establishing its authenticity.  If this man had procured the death of him whose portrait he studied thus, his power over himself was indeed wonderful.  But--was not the experiment a crucial one for him?  To betray his trouble would be to avow all?  How ardently I longed to place my hand upon his heart at that moment and to count its beats. \\\"You do resemble him,\\\" he said at length, \\\"but not to that degree. The lower part of the chin especially, the nose and the mouth, are alike, but you have not the same look in the eyes, and the brows, forehead, and cheeks are not the same shape.\\\" \\\"Do you think,\\\" said I, \\\"that the resemblance is strong enough for me to startle the murderer if he were to meet me suddenly here, and thus?\\\"--I advanced upon him, looking into the depths of his eyes as though I were imitating a dramatic scene.  \\\"Yes,\\\" I continued, \\\"would the likeness of feature enable me to produce the effect of a specter, on saying to the man, 'Do you recognize the son of him whom you killed?\\\"' \\\"Now we are returning to our former discussion,\\\" he replied, without any farther alteration of his countenance; \\\"that would depend upon the man's remorse, if he had any, and on his nervous system.\\\" Again we were silent.  His pale and sickly but motionless face exasperated me by its complete absence of expression.  In those minutes--and how many such scenes have we not acted together since my suspicion was first conceived--I felt myself as bold and resolute as I was the reverse when alone with my own thoughts.  His impassive manner drove me wild again; I did not limit myself to this second experiment, but immediately devised a third, which ought to make him suffer as much as the two others, if he were guilty.  I was like a man who strikes his enemy with a broken- handled knife, holding it by the blade in his shut hand; the blow draws his own blood also.  But no, no; I was not exactly that man; I could not doubt or deny the harm that I was doing to myself by these cruel experiments, while he, my adversary, hid his wound so well that I saw it not.  No matter, the mad desire TO KNOW overcame my pain. \\\"How strange those resemblances are,\\\" I said.  \\\"My father's handwriting and mine are exactly the same.  Look here.\\\" I opened an iron safe built into the wall, in which I kept papers which I especially valued, and took out first the letters from my father to my aunt which I had selected and placed on top of the packet.  These were the latest in date, and I held them out to him, just as I had arranged them in their envelopes.  The letters were addressed to \\\"Mademoiselle Louise Cornelis, Compiegne;\\\" they bore the postmark and the quite legible stamp of the days on which they were posted in the April and May of 1864.  It was the former process over again.  If M. Termonde were guilty, he would be conscious that the sudden change of my attitude towards himself, the boldness of my allusions, the vigor of my attacks were all explained by these letters, and also that I had found the documents among my dead aunt's papers.  It was impossible that he should not seek with intense anxiety to ascertain what was contained in those letters that had aroused such suspicions in me.  When he had the envelopes in his hands I saw him bend his brows, and I had a momentary hope that I had shattered the mask that hid his true face, that face in which the inner workings of the soul are reflected.  The bent brow was, however, merely a contraction of the muscles of the eye, caused by regarding an object closely, and it cleared immediately.  He handed me back the letters without any question as to their contents. \\\"This time,\\\" said he simply, \\\"there really is an astonishing resemblance.\\\"  Then, returning to the ostensible object of his visit--\\\"And the reviews?\\\" he asked. I could have shed tears of rage.  Once more I was conscious that I was a nervous youth engaged in a struggle with a resolutely self- possessed man.  I locked up the letters in the safe, and I now rummaged the small bookcase in the smoking-room, then the large one in my study, and finally pretended to be greatly astonished at finding the two reviews under a heap of newspapers on my table. What a silly farce!  Was my stepfather taken in by it?  When I had handed him the two numbers, he rose from the chair that he had sat in during my pretended search in the chimney-corner of the smoking- room, with his back to my father's portrait.  But, again, what did this attitude prove?  Why should he care to contemplate an image which could not be anything but painful to him, even if he were innocent? \\\"I am going to take advantage of the sunshine to have a turn in the Bois,\\\" said he.  \\\"I have my coupe; will you come with me?\\\" Was he sincere in proposing this tete-a-tete drive which was so contrary to our habits?  What was his motive: the wish to show me that he had not even understood my attack, or the yearning of the sick man who dreads to be alone? I accepted the offer at all hazards, in order to continue my observation of him, and a quarter of an hour afterwards we were speeding towards the Arc de Triomphe in that same carriage in which I had seen him pass by me, beaten, broken, almost killed, after our first interview. This time, he looked like another man.  Warmly wrapped in an overcoat lined with seal fur, smoking a cigar, waving his hand to this person or that through the open window, he talked on and on, telling me anecdotes of all sorts, which I had either heard or not heard previously, about people whose carriages crossed ours.  He seemed to be talking before me and not with me, so little heed did he take of whether he was telling what I might know, or apprising me of what I did not know.  I concluded from this--for, in certain states of mind, every mood is significant--that he was talking thus in order to ward off some fresh attempt on my part.  But I had not the courage to recommence my efforts to open the wound in his heart and set it bleeding afresh so soon.  I merely listened to him, and once again I remarked the strange contrast between his private thoughts and the rigid doctrines which he generally professed.  One would have said that in his eyes the high society, whose principles he habitually defended, was a brigand's cave.  It was the hour at which women of fashion go out for their shopping and their calls, and he related all the scandals of their conduct, false or true. He dwelt on all these stories and calumnies with a horrid pleasure, as though he rejoiced in the vileness of humanity.  Did this mean the facile misanthropy of a profligate, accustomed to such conversations at the club, or in sporting circles, during which each man lays bare his brutal egotism, and voluntarily exaggerates the depth of his own disenchantment that he may boast more largely of his experience?  Was this the cynicism of a villain, guilty of the most hideous of crimes, and glad to demonstrate that others were less worthy than he?  To hear him laugh and talk thus threw me into a singular state of dejection. We had passed the last houses in the Avenue de Bois, and were driving along an alley on the right in which there were but few carriages.  On the bare hedgerows a beautiful light shone, coming from that lofty, pale blue sky which is seen only over Paris. He continued to sneer and chuckle, and I reflected that perhaps he was right, that the seamy side of the world was what he depicted it.  Why not?  Was not I there, in the same carriage with this man, and I suspected him of having had my father murdered!  All the bitterness of life filled my heart with a rush.  Did my stepfather perceive, by my silence and my face, that his gay talk was torturing me?  Was he weary of his own effort? He suddenly left off talking, and as we had reached a forsaken corner of the Bois, we got out of the carriage to walk a little. How strongly present to my mind is that by-path, a gray line between the poor spare grass and the bare trees, the cold winter sky, the wide road at a little distance with the carriage advancing slowly, drawn by the bay horse, shaking its head and its bit, and driven by a wooden-faced coachman--then, the man.  He walked by my side, a tall figure in a long overcoat.  The collar of dark brown fur brought out the premature whiteness of his hair.  He held a cane in his gloved hand, and struck away the pebbles with it impatiently.  Why does his image return to me at this hour with an unendurable exactness?  It is because, as I observed him walking along the wintry road, with his head bent forward, I was struck as I had never been before with the sense of his absolute unremitting wretchedness.  Was this due to the influence of our conversation of that afternoon, to the dejection which his sneering, sniggering talk had produced in me, or to the death of nature all around us? For the first time since I knew him, a pang of pity mingled with my hatred of him, while he walked by my side, trying to warm himself in the pale sunshine, a shrunken, weary, lamentable creature. Suddenly he turned his face, which was contracted with pain, to me, and said: \\\"I do not feel well.  Let us go home.\\\"  When we were in the carriage, he said, putting his sudden seizure upon the pretext of his health: \\\"I have not long to live, and I suffer so much that I should have made an end of it all years ago, had it not been for your mother.\\\" Then he went on talking of her with the blindness that I had already remarked in him.  Never, in my most hostile hours, had I doubted that his worship of his wife was perfectly sincere, and once again I listened to him, as we drove rapidly into Paris in the gathering twilight, and all that he said proved how much he loved her.  Alas! his passion rated her more highly than my tenderness. He praised the exquisite tact with which my mother discerned the things of the heart, to me, who knew so well her want of feeling! He lauded the keenness of her intelligence to me, whom she had so little understood!  And he added, he who had so largely contributed to our separation: \\\"Love her dearly; you will soon be the only one to love her.\\\" If he were the criminal I believed him to be, he was certainly aware that in thus placing my mother between himself and me he was putting in my way the only barrier which I could never, never break down, and I on my side understood clearly, and with bitterness of soul, that the obstacles so placed would be stronger than even the most fatal certainty.  What, then, was the good of seeking any further?  Why not renounce my useless quest at once?  But it was already too late.\\n\\nX\\n\\nAt the beginning of the summer, six months after my aunt's death, I was in exactly the same position with respect to my stepfather as on that already distant day when, maddened with suspicion by my father's letters, I entered his study, to play the part of the physician who examines a man's body, searching with his finger for the tender spot that is probably a symptom of a hidden abscess. I was full of intuitions now, just as I was at the moment when he passed me in his carriage with his terrible face, but I did not grasp a single certainty.  Would I have persisted in a struggle in which I felt beforehand that I must be beaten? I cannot tell; for, when I no longer expected any solution to the problem set before me for my grief, a grief, too, that was both sterile and mortal, a day came on which I had a conversation with my mother so startling and appalling that to this hour my heart stands still when I think of it.  I have spoken of dates; among them is the 25th of May, 1879. My stepfather, who was on the eve of his departure for Vichy, had just had a severe attack of liver-complaint, the first since his illness after our terrible conversation in the month of January.  I know that I counted for nothing--at least in any direct or positive way--in this acute revival of his malady.  The fight between us, which went on without the utterance of a word on either side, and with no witnesses except ourselves, had not been marked by any fresh episode; I therefore attributed this complication to the natural development of the disease under which he labored. I can exactly recall what I was thinking of on the 25th of May, at five o'clock in the evening, as I walked up the stairs in the hotel on the Boulevard de Latour-Marbourg.  I hoped to learn that my stepfather was better, because I had been witnessing my mother's distress for a whole week, and also--I must tell all--because to know he was going to the watering-place was a great relief to me, on account of the separation it would bring about.  I was so tired of my unprofitable pain!  My wretched nerves were in such a state of tension that the slightest disagreeable impression became a torment.  I could not sleep without the aid of narcotics, and such sleep as these procured was full of cruel dreams in which I walked by my father's side, while knowing and feeling that he was dead. One particular nightmare used to recur so regularly that it rendered my dread of the night almost unbearable.  I stood in a street crowded with people and was looking into a shop window; on a sudden I heard a man's step approaching, that of M. Termonde.  I did not see him, and yet I was certain it was he.  I tried to move on, but my feet were leaden; to turn my head, but my neck was immovable.  The step drew nearer, my enemy was behind me, I heard his breathing, and knew that he was about to strike me.  He passed his arm over my shoulder.  I saw his hand, it grasped a knife, and sought for the spot where my heart lay; then it drove the blade in, slowly, slowly, and I awoke in unspeakable agony. So often had this nightmare recurred within a few weeks, that I had taken to counting the days until my stepfather's departure, which had been at first fixed for the 21st, and then put off until he should be stronger.  I hoped that when he was absent I should be at rest at least for a time.  I had not the courage to go away myself, attracted as I was every day by that presence which I hated, and yet sought with feverish eagerness; but I secretly rejoiced that the obstacle was of his raising, that his absence gave me breathing-time, without my being obliged to reproach myself with weakness. Such were my reflections as I mounted the wooden staircase, covered with a red carpet, and lighted by stained-glass windows, that led to my mother's favorite hall.  The servant who opened the door informed me in answer to my question that my stepfather was better, and I entered the room with which my saddest recollections were connected, more cheerfully than usual.  Little did I think that the dial hung upon one of the walls was ticking off in minutes one of the most solemn hours of my life! My mother was seated before a small writing-table, placed in a corner of the deep glazed projection which formed the garden-end of the hall.  Her left hand supported her head, and in the right, instead of going on with the letter she had begun to write, she held her idle pen, in a golden holder with a fine pearl set in the top of it (the latter small detail was itself a revelation of her luxurious habits).  She was so lost in reverie that she did not hear me enter the room, and I looked at her for some time without moving, startled by the expression of misery in her refined and lovely face.  What dark thought was it that closed her mouth, furrowed her brow, and transformed her features?  The alteration in her looks and the evident absorption of her mind contrasted so strongly with the habitual serenity of her countenance that it at once alarmed me.  But, what was the matter?  Her husband was better; why, then, should the anxiety of the last few days have developed into this acute trouble?  Did she suspect what had been going on close to her, in her own house, for months past?  Had M. Termonde made up his mind to complain to her, in order to procure the cessation of the torture inflicted upon him by my assiduity? No.  If he had divined my meaning from the very first day, as I thought he had, unless he were sure he could not have said to her: \\\"Andre suspects me of having had his father killed.\\\"  Or had the doctor discerned dangerous symptoms behind this seeming improvement in the invalid? Was my stepfather in danger of death? At the idea, my first feeling was joy, my second was rage--joy that he should disappear from my life, and for ever; rage that, being guilty, he should die without having felt my full vengeance. Beneath all my hesitation, my scruples, my doubts, there lurked that savage appetite for revenge which I had allowed to grow up in me, revenge that is not satisfied with the death of the hated object unless it be caused by one's self.  I thirsted for revenge as a dog thirsts for water after running in the sun on a summer day.  I wanted to roll myself in it, as the dog in question rolls himself in the water when he comes to it, were it the sludge of a swamp.  I continued to gaze at my mother without moving.  Presently she heaved a deep sigh and said aloud: \\\"Oh, me, oh, me! what misery it is!\\\"  Then lifting up her tear-stained face, she saw me, and uttered a cry of surprise.  I hastened towards her. \\\"You are in trouble, mother,\\\" I said.  \\\"What ails you?\\\" Dread of her answer made my voice falter; I knelt down before her as I used to do when a child, and, taking both her hands, I covered them with kisses.  Again, at this solemn hour, my lips were met by that golden wedding-ring which I hated like a living person; yet the feeling did not hinder me from speaking to her almost childishly.  \\\"Ah,\\\" I said, \\\"you have troubles, and to whom should you tell them if not to me?  Where will you find anyone to love you more?  Be good to me,\\\" I went on; \\\"do you not feel how dear you are to me?\\\" She bent her head twice, made a sign that she could not speak, and burst into painful sobs. \\\"Has your trouble anything to do with me?\\\" I asked. She shook her head as an emphatic negative, and then said in a half-stifled voice, while she smoothed my hair with her hands, as she used to do in the old times: \\\"You are very nice to me, my Andre.\\\" How simple those few words were, and yet they caught my heart and gripped it as a hand might do.  How had I longed for some of those little words which she had never uttered, some of those gracious phrases which are like the gestures of the mind, some of her involuntary tender caresses.  Now I had what I had so earnestly desired, but at what a moment and by what means!  It was, nevertheless, very sweet to feel that she loved me.  I told her so, employing words which scorched my lips, so that I might be kind to her. \\\"Is our dear invalid worse?\\\" \\\"No, he is better.  He is resting now,\\\" she answered, pointing in the direction of my stepfather's room. \\\"Mother, speak to me,\\\" I urged, \\\"trust yourself to me; let me grieve with you, perhaps I may help you.  It is so cruel for me that I must take you by surprise in order to see your tears.\\\" I went on, pressing her by my questions and my complaining.  What, then, did I hope to tear from those lips which quivered but yet kept silence?  At any price I WOULD know; I was in no state to endure fresh mysteries, and I was certain that my stepfather was somehow concerned in this inexplicable trouble, for it was only he and I who so deeply moved that woman's heart of hers.  She was not thus troubled on account of me, she had just told me so; the cause of her grief must have reference to him, and it was not his health. Had she, too, made any discovery?  Had the terrible suspicion crossed her mind also?  At the mere idea a burning fever seized upon me; I insisted and insisted again.  I felt that she was yielding, if it were only by the leaning of her head towards me, the passing of her trembling hand over my hair, and the quickening of her breath. \\\"If I were sure,\\\" said she at length, \\\"that this secret would die with you and me.\\\" \\\"Oh, mother!\\\" I exclaimed, in so reproachful a tone that the blood flew to her cheeks.  Perhaps this little betrayal of shame decided her; she pressed a lingering kiss on my forehead, as though she would have effaced the frown which her unjust distrust had set there. \\\"Forgive me, my Andre,\\\" she said, \\\"I was wrong.  In whom should I trust, to whom confide this thing, except to you?  From whom ask counsel?\\\"  And then she went on as though she were speaking to herself, \\\"If he were ever to apply to him?\\\" \\\"He!  Whom?\\\" \\\"Andre, will you swear to me by your love for me, that you will never, you understand me, never, make the least illusion to what I am going to tell you?\\\" \\\"Mother!\\\" I replied, in the same tone of reproach, and then added at once, to draw her on, \\\"I give you my word of honor!\\\" \\\"Nor--\\\" she did not pronounce a name, but she pointed anew to the door of the sick man's room. \\\"Never.\\\" \\\"You have heard of Edmond Termonde, his brother?\\\"  Her voice was lowered, as though she were afraid of the words she uttered, and now her eyes only were turned towards the closed door, indicating that she meant the brother of her husband.  I had a vague knowledge of the story; it was of this brother I had thought when I was reviewing the mental history of my stepfather's family.  I knew that Edmond Termonde had dissipated his share of the family fortune, no less than 1,200,000 francs, in a few years; that he had been enlisted, that he had gone on leading a debauched life in his regiment; that, having no money to come into from any quarter, and after a heavy loss at cards, he had been tempted into committing both theft and forgery.  Then, finding himself on the brink of being detected, he had deserted.  The end was that he did justice on himself by drowning himself in the Seine, after he had implored his brother's forgiveness in terms which proved that some sense of moral decency still lingered in him.  The stolen money was made good by my stepfather; the scandal was hushed up, thanks to the scoundrel's disappearance.  I had reconstructed the whole story in my mind from the gossip of my good old nurse, and also from certain traces of it which I had found in some passages of my father's correspondence.  Thus, when my mother put her question to me in so agitated a way, I supposed she was about to tell me of family grievances on the part of her husband which were totally indifferent to me, and it was with a feeling of disappointment that I asked her: \\\"Edmond Termonde?  The man who killed himself?\\\" She bent her head to answer, yes, to the first part of my question; then, in a still lower voice, she said: \\\"He did not kill himself, he is still alive.\\\" \\\"He is still alive,\\\" I repeated mechanically, and without a notion of what could be the relation between the existence of this brother and the tears which I had seen her shed. \\\"Now you know the secret of my sorrow,\\\" she resumed, in a firmer, almost a relieved tone.  \\\"This infamous brother is a tormentor of my Jacques; he puts him to death daily by the agonies which he inflicts upon him.  No; the suicide never took place.  Such men as he have not the courage to kill themselves.  Jacques dictated that letter to save him from penal servitude after he had arranged everything for his flight, and given him the wherewithal to lead a new life, if he would have done so.  My poor love, he hoped at least to save the integrity of his name out of all the terrible wreck.  Edmond had, of course, to renounce the name of Termonde, to escape pursuit, and he went to America.  There he lived--as he had lived here.  The money he took with him was soon exhausted, and again he had recourse to his brother.  Ah! the wretch knew well that Jacques had made all these sacrifices to the honor of his name, and when my husband refused him the money he demanded, he made use of the weapon which he knew would avail. \\\"Then began the vilest persecution, the most atrocious levying of black-mail.  Edmond threatened to return to France; between going to the galleys here or starving in America, he said, he preferred the galleys here and Jacques yielded the first time--he loved him; after all, he was his only brother.  You know when you have once shown weakness in dealing with people of this sort you are lost. The threat to return had succeeded, and the other has since used it to extort sums of which you have no idea. \\\"This abominable persecution has been going on for years, but I have only been aware of it since the war.  I saw that my husband was utterly miserable about something; I knew that a hidden trouble was preying on him, and then, one day, he told me all.  Would you believe it?  It was for me that he was afraid.  'What can he possibly do to me?' I asked my Jacques.  'Ah,' he said, 'he is capable of anything for the sake of revenge.  And then he saw me so overwhelmed by distress at his fits of melancholy, and I so earnestly entreated him, that at length he made a stand.  He positively refused to give any more money.  We have not heard of the wretch for some time--he has kept his word--Andre he is in Paris!\\\" I had listened to my mother with growing attention.  At any period of my life, I, who had not the same notions of my stepfather's sensitiveness of feeling which my dear mother entertained, would have been astonished at the influence exercised by this disgraced brother.  There are similar pests in so many families, that it is plainly to the interest of society to separate the various representatives of the same name from each other.  At any time I should have doubted whether M. Termonde, a bold and violent man as I knew him to be, had yielded under the menace of a scandal whose real importance he would have estimated quite correctly.  Then I would have explained this weakness by the recollections of his childhood, by a promise made to his dying parents; but now, in the actual state of my mind, full as I was of the suspicions which had been occupying my thoughts for weeks, it was inevitable that another idea should occur to me.  And that idea grew, and grew, taking form as my mother went on speaking.  No doubt my face betrayed the dread with which the notion inspired me, for she interrupted her narrative to ask me: \\\"Are you feeling ill, Andre?\\\" I found strength to answer, \\\"No; I am upset by having found you in tears.  It is nothing.\\\" She believed me; she had just seen me overcome by her emotion; she kissed me tenderly, and I begged her to continue.  She then told me that one day in the previous week a stranger, coming ostensibly from one of their friends in London, had asked to see my stepfather.  He was ushered into the hall, and into her presence, and she guessed at once by the extraordinary agitation which M. Termonde displayed that the man was Edmond.  The two brothers went into my stepfather's private room, while my mother remained in the hall, half dead with anxiety and suspense, every now and then hearing the angry tones of their voices, but unable to distinguish any words.  At length the brother came out, through the hall, and looked at her as he passed by with eyes that transfixed her with fear. \\\"And the same evening,\\\" she went on, \\\"Jacques took to his bed. Now, do you understand my despair?  Ah, it is not our name that I care for.  I wear myself out with repeating, 'What has this to do with us?  How can we be spattered by this mud?'  It is his health, his precious health!  The doctor says that every violent emotion is a dose of poison to him.  Ah!\\\" she cried, with a gesture of despair, \\\"this man will kill him.\\\" To hear that cry, which once again revealed to me the depth of her passion for my stepfather, to hear it at this moment, and to think what I was thinking! \\\"You saw him?\\\" I asked, hardly knowing what I said.  \\\"Have I not told you that he passed by me, there?\\\" and with terror depicted in her face, she showed me the place on the carpet. \\\"And you are sure that the man was his brother?\\\" \\\"Jacques told me so in the evening; but I did not require that; I should have recognized him by the eyes.  How strange it is!  Those two brothers, so different; Jacques so refined, so distinguished, so noble-minded, and the other, a big, heavy, vulgar lout, common- looking, and a rascal--well, they have the same look in their eyes.\\\" \\\"And under what name is he in Paris?\\\" \\\"I do not know.  I dare not speak of him any more.  If he knew that I have told you this, with his ideas!  But then, dear, you would have heard it at some time or other; and besides,\\\" she added with firmness, \\\"I would have told you long ago about this wretched secret if I had dared!  You are a man now, and you are not bound by this excessively scrupulous fraternal affection.  Advise me, Andre; what is to be done?\\\" \\\"I do not understand you.\\\" \\\"Yes, yes.  There must be some means of informing the police and having this man arrested without its being talked of in the newspapers or elsewhere.  Jacques would not do this, because the man is his brother; but if we were to act, you and I, on our own side?  I have heard you say that you visit M. Massol, whom we knew at the time of our great misfortune; suppose I were to go to him and ask his advice?  Ah! I must keep my husband alive--he must be saved!  I love him too much!\\\" Why was I seized with a panic at the idea that she might carry out this project, and apply to the former Judge of Instruction--I, who had not ventured to go to his house since my aunt's death for fear he should divine my suspicions merely by looking at me?  What was it that I saw so clearly, that made me implore her to abandon her idea in the very name of the love she bore her husband? \\\"You will not do this,\\\" I said; \\\"you have no right to do it.  He would never forgive you, and he would have just cause; it would be betraying him.\\\" \\\"Betraying him!  It would be saving him!\\\" \\\"And if his brother's arrest were to strike him a fresh blow?  If you were to see him ill, more ill than ever, on account of what you had done?\\\" I had used the only argument that could have convinced her. Strange irony of fate!  I calmed her, I persuaded her not to act-- I, who had suddenly conceived the monstrous notion that the doer of the murderous deed, the docile instrument in my stepfather's hands, was this infamous brother--that Edmond Termonde and Rochdale were one and the same man!\",\"timestamp\":1639709067,\"title\":\"The train from Paris approached, and stopped.
