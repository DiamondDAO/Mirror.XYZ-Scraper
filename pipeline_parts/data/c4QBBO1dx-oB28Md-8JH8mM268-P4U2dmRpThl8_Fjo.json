"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### Transmission from Valgueri The Myriad\\n\\n**Current cycle:** 1092 PH / December 31, 2021, Prime Earth Local  \\n **Current virtual identity**: Valgueri as [The Sleeper](https://magiceden.io/item-details/AaDAVSV8nHwnnHiNRqgAnTBanxs2NHzw1QoMgMGKgSBw)  \\n **Current whereabouts**: Node 787  \\n **Collection / Sphere reference:** [legendmaps.io](https://legendmaps.io/)\\n\\nDuring my travels I’ve come across an…archive, I suppose, of intriguing maps and scraps on forgotten lore, from...I’m not actually sure if these refer to one, or many, of the virtual spheres. Something to investigate further.\\n\\nAt a surprisingly reasonable cost, [I was able to acquire a few of these maps](https://opensea.io/collection/legend-maps-founder), and have been studying them.\\n\\nThey seem to be both self-contained and hinting at a larger construct, and my current hypothesis is that they are designed to be challenges of a sort for the manifestations within the Etherium Spheres.\\n\\nInformation on the specific locations they depict and the denizens therein are limited, but what I have been able to dig up is rather compelling; odds and ends, tales, and tantalizing tidbits that tell of a magical and deadly world that could very well contain echos from all across the Ethersea. Here is one such echo, a small fragment of verse about a place known as the **[Mazes of The Wyrmcaller](https://opensea.io/assets/0xbff184118bf575859dc6a236e8c7c4f80dc7c25c/5464)**.\\n\\n![Mazes of The Wyrmcaller](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rf59IrthcuhkAbXpE6-oB.png?height=600&width=600)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nLet me tell you of a place frozen in time  \\n The Resting of the Wyrm, called to its death  \\n By a haunting melody  \\n A treasonous rhyme\\n\\nThe fairest of folk, once…now in shadow  \\n Her song forsaken  \\n To the umbral embrace  \\n A blood-red moon\\n\\nOf riches, there are aplenty  \\n A crown of cold iron  \\n For a kingdom lost  \\n A legacy yet to be claimed\\n\\nA twisting labyrinth  \\n Hides a secret  \\n And a key to the past  \\n A harrowing and faded memory\\n\\nBehind the doors of time, the doors of bone  \\n The graveyard of ashes  \\n A soul without song  \\n A challenge for the worthy\\n\\n\\\\~ Unknown\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nNotes to Nine: Could this be referring to the Shaghail A’venfae? And perhaps a reference to the Serpentine Court? The reference to the harrowed memory is interesting, as is the choice of wording there. Could this perhaps be related to glitches I’ve seen amongst these maps? Perhaps something linking these realms to my own? Evidence of The Harrowing in these virtual realms?\",\"timestamp\":1640972161,\"title\":\"03: Mazes of The Wyrmcaller\"},\"digest\":\"aJjrkMAUM1Vo9arSleR6nNbKfbUx9eK-3NC4cw50qLY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4156a0b6dE663f70041860f5584B1A8c9ea50dC0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"SHFCIJWT1-00mg7fhNsXU1ZsxVFZFLRQsnhxsB6qsYw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Y9rlOZdLzrknh4idpiaVzT4FBYjyX2ALELbcb737M8E\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"aPM67NNPUJwISH6Y1NlL3pObPBlgXzyVV-dW-VvdQMgSUPy1fsZJEq8UQOiVX11DjEMKpKfXvg4dquPwvRWV5g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1a058a2c4e58d94e7647f427a269ffeacbf5588d7b6a40a4a20d89b6aee7f6674e3e16dabd2d230e628bc1f003c66006e074b2e033da754c74ef7b2388eb65f11c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"SHFCIJWT1-00mg7fhNsXU1ZsxVFZFLRQsnhxsB6qsYw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Y9rlOZdLzrknh4idpiaVzT4FBYjyX2ALELbcb737M8E\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"aJjrkMAUM1Vo9arSleR6nNbKfbUx9eK-3NC4cw50qLY\"}"
