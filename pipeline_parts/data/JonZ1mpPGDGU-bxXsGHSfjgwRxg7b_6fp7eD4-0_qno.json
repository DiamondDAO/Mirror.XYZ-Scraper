To celebrate, I set up a lunch with a number of co-workers to break virtual bread over Zoom.\\n\\nWe met. We laughed. We swapped stories. The conversation was fluid and I loved the camaraderie. One of my co-workers brought up the subject of art and asked if anyone collected. I didn‚Äôt personally, but many did! As dialogue quelled, I asked them if they could share any artists they enjoyed and any specific pieces they‚Äôve purchased.\\n\\nI browsed through their suggested galleries and enjoyed browsing.\\n\\nBut nothing compelled me to make a move.\\n\\nThe conversation took a turn when one my co-workers asked:\\n\\n> ‚Äú*Does anyone own an NFT?*‚Äù\\n\\nThe silence was telling: no one owned an NFT or understood what they were there for.\\n\\nOur lunch time quickly concluded, but their question left an impression on me.\\n\\nI asked myself:\\n\\n> *‚ÄúWhat are NFTs and why is there so much excitement over them?‚Äù*\\n\\n**May 2021 to September 2021**. I took a break from the crypto space to focus on my new role as an engineer and to take time for my mental and spiritual health.\\n\\n**October 2021.** I decided to get back into the space and I remembered [Laura Shin‚Äôs Unchained Podcast](https://unchainedpodcast.com/about/). It had been a guiding light in previous months to get perspective across spectrums. I hopped back in and what caught my attention was [this episode](https://unchainedpodcast.com/visa-is-building-infrastructure-for-nfts-smart-contracts-and-l2s-why/) when Laura interviewed  [Cuy Sheffield](https://twitter.com/cuysheffield), Visa‚Äôs Head of Crypto. Cuy shared why NFTs were his favorite topic and how they have the potential to level the playing field for black artists (and artists in general).\\n\\nFor as long as I could remember, if I wasn‚Äôt paying in cash, I was swiping my VISA. And, to know that a company I had long relied upon was going into crypto sent a signal to me.\\n\\nI finished the episode and I experienced cognitive dissonance. Up until this point in my crypto journey, the general impression of NFTs were largely based from my peers‚Äô opinions. Many described them as an overhyped scam built on technology that would never stand the test of time. And, I believed it without questioning it.\\n\\nKnowing what I know now, they weren‚Äôt entirely wrong. There are still folks out there that are out to pump and dump. It‚Äôs not great, but not every NFT project is like that as I‚Äôve come to find.\\n\\nI decided to learn more about the space by listening to [more podcasts](https://field-notes.almndbtr.dev/readme/new-start-here#podcasts-and-videos) and consuming [Real Vision‚Äô](https://www.realvision.com/)s articles and videos.\\n\\nFast forward to November 2021, I listened to [Cuy‚Äôs interview with the Bankless team](https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/-93-crypto-payments-and-the-defi), Ryan Sean Adams and David Hoffman. After that episode, I asked myself:\\n\\n> *‚ÄúWhat could the positive side of NFTs look like?‚Äù*\\n\\n## üñºÔ∏è Marking a work anniversary with an art NFT\\n\\n**December 1, 2021.** My official ‚Äústart‚Äù date in web3. It was my 6th year work anniversary and I wanted to buy a piece of art to commemorate the occasion.\\n\\nI checked out [Foundation](https://foundation.app/), [Zora](https://zora.co/), and [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), but I didn‚Äôt have enough `ETH` to purchase anything that really resonated with me. I had some `SOL` at the time and I checked out [SolSea](https://solsea.io/), the Solana ‚Äúfork‚Äù of OpenSea. I filtered for pieces related to art and AI and I found the [Ghost Machine](https://solsea.io/collection/614b578ee7554f9e3179a330) collection.\\n\\nAccording to their profile, each piece is generated from an AI trained on hundreds of hours of art history and is 1 of 1 unique and part of artificial intelligence history. It was created by an AI artist and everything was minted on the Solana Chain.\\n\\nIt all started with [this NFT](https://solsea.io/nft/CmVesJvouYFUpodJpA4GePvjdj3ThesYCbCas2H6kvn):\\n\\n![Ghost Machine 0096](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mMeVKu2Q5dOYjFMTBXFGI.jpg?height=1024&width=1024)\\n\\n`Ghost Machine 0096` , also known as ‚ÄúThe Woman in White‚Äù, resonated with me for these reasons:\\n\\n* The composition caught my eye\\n* I could afford it\\n\\nI [purchased](https://solscan.io/token/CmVesJvouYFUpodJpA4GePvjdj3ThesYCbCas2H6kvn) it, chose it as my avatar in the metaverse, and I acknowledged the author for their work on Twitter:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/almndbtr/status/1470812605937717248?s=20](https://twitter.com/almndbtr/status/1470812605937717248?s=20)\\n\\nThis marked the beginning of my creative journey into web3.\\n\\n## üêá The Start of an Adventure\\n\\nI created a Twitter account after spending years away from social media. I reveled in being completely disconnected from platforms that hijacked my attention.\\n\\nOn the advent of web3, I knew that if I didn‚Äôt connect to Twitter, I knew I would be deeply missing out on context and building meaningful relationships with other strangers on the internet who were geeking out on the same stuff I was on.\\n\\nI yielded. üòé\\n\\nMy first tweet back on was replying to [AbJo](https://twitter.com/_AbJo)‚Äôs question about an upcoming drop:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/almndbtr/status/1466654337745096705?s=20](https://twitter.com/almndbtr/status/1466654337745096705?s=20)\\n\\nFrom there, I felt like creative dominoes started to fall. I started to see the way commercial investors, culture investors, and creators were interacting in a new fashion unlike anything I have seen before.\\n\\n### Five examples of signal\\n\\n* Industry\\n* Musician\\n* Developer\\n* Skeptic\\n* Community\\n\\n**\\\\[1\\\\] Industry Signal**: Through Real Vision‚Äôs Takeover, I discovered the way investors, musicians, and artists were mobilizing around technology for different causes:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/RealVision/status/1469492982030102530?s=20](https://twitter.com/RealVision/status/1469492982030102530?s=20)\\n\\n**\\\\[2\\\\] Musician Signal**: Through AbJo, I learned about [sound.xyz](https://sound.xyz/) and their listening parties. When you buy a song, you join a community of `#sound-holders` . I [lost my first bid wanting to mint AbJo‚Äôs Genesis NFT](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x90d8bf2a386776e979a1cdc66543ff9073afbf1b2c614741f0e2fc444535141f), but I won my second bid for AllanKingdom‚Äôs Reasons. When I became a `#sound-hodler` , I joined the community and provided engineering and product feedback to team in their Discord:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/almndbtr/status/1470877683873554435?s=20](https://twitter.com/almndbtr/status/1470877683873554435?s=20)\\n\\n**\\\\[3\\\\] Developer Signal:** Through [Chase Barker](https://twitter.com/therealchaseeb), I learned about [pencilflip.sol](https://twitter.com/pencilflip), [Katherine](https://twitter.com/petrichorate), and the [Mycoverse](https://twitter.com/TheMycoverse):\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/almndbtr/status/1470815416880537608?s=20](https://twitter.com/almndbtr/status/1470815416880537608?s=20)\\n\\nThis led me to discover [@marcelc63](https://twitter.com/marcelc63) and [their work on smart contract breakdowns](https://web3pad.xyz/) along with their project [Retro1990.xyz](https://retro1990.xyz/), their NFT project inspired by ‚Äò90s nostalgia. I [minted five to show love](https://twitter.com/almndbtr/status/1479276299633922050?s=20) and acknowledged how it made me feel seen as an Asian person:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/almndbtr/status/1479281509446025218?s=20](https://twitter.com/almndbtr/status/1479281509446025218?s=20)\\n\\n**\\\\[4\\\\] Skeptic Signal:** With any new advancement, it is important to consider the other sides of the argument. These pieces helped me see where the space could use thoughtful consideration and more activists (like me!) to help shape and make it better:\\n\\n* [My first impressions of web3](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html) by [Moxie Marlinspike](https://moxie.org/)\\n* [The Case Against Crypto](https://www.stephendiehl.com/blog/against-crypto.html) by [Stephen Diehl](https://www.stephendiehl.com/)\\n* [Cooper Turley‚Äôs Apology Note](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1481060726307500038?s=20) by [Cooopahtroopa.eth](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa)\\n* [Amid the Hype over Web3, Informed Skepticism Is Critical](https://www.cigionline.org/articles/amid-the-hype-over-web3-informed-skepticism-is-critical/) by [Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI)](https://www.cigionline.org/about/)\\n\\n**\\\\[5\\\\] Community Signal**: Technology is great, but can we talk about community?\\n\\nIn my past life, I was a support engineer and a community manager for a large tech company. I wasn‚Äôt involved in Twitter in any ‚Äúprofessional capacity‚Äù, but I re-discovered the joy of spontaneous interactions and social events through Twitter Spaces.\\n\\nJames and I discovered each other over Twitter and Twitter Spaces and I started following his work. He‚Äôs extremely encouraging, shows up for other people‚Äôs Genesis NFT launches, and is just available to help people when they need help.\\n\\nOne of the first Twitter Spaces that I hopped on as a speaker for was with [James](https://twitter.com/JamesGardin_) and [Pat Junior](https://twitter.com/iampatjunior). I took [extensive notes](https://field-notes.almndbtr.dev/twitter-spaces/jamesgardin.eth-and-patjunior.eth), chopped it up, and learned so much from just listening to different perspectives in the room.\\n\\nThat led to another Twitter space debuting [#web3 Black Notes](https://field-notes.almndbtr.dev/twitter-spaces/web3-black-notes). James and Pat Junior are excellent communicators and interviewers and I took a background role in being the ‚Äúnotorious notetaker‚Äù (üé© to [JPReynolds](https://twitter.com/OfficiallyJP_) for that one üòâ) until the security question came up.\\n\\nFrom these collective conversations, I learned:\\n\\n* One of the most fruitful ways to learn is to ask questions, write down answers, and reflect on them before asking new questions. üí≠\\n* You can‚Äôt embark on any new journey without finding people that will walk alongside you. It‚Äôs just, going to be way too difficult otherwise. üíØ\\n* It‚Äôs totally cool to make friends on the internet and sharing what you feel comfortable sharing. Just, please use wisdom. ü§ó\\n* James and Pat Junior are incredible human beings and I want them to keep making music. üé∂\\n* It‚Äôs important to make space just as it is to occupy space. Be mindful of what you share and be sure to acknowledge those who go before you, the hosts, and anyone that you recognize in the audience. üéØ\\n\\n## üèóÔ∏è Next: four goals until Day 90\\n\\n* üìú Publish three end-to-end smart art+music contract overviews in [Almond‚Äôs Field Notes](https://field-notes.almndbtr.dev/) and in Twitter threads.\\n* üñ§ Launch my Genesis NFTs (poetry, visual art, and/or music). Because [gas fees](https://ethgasstation.info/) on Ethereum are just way too high, I‚Äôm highly inclined to launch on [Metaplex](https://www.metaplex.com/) and see where it goes from there.\\n* üéπ Continue being a part of the Black Keys as a notetaker, contributor, and technical advocate.\\n* üè¶ Acquire either a [McClenney](https://twitter.com/MisterMcClenney), [Pat Junior](https://twitter.com/iampatjunior), or [Soulection](https://twitter.com/soulection) NFT.\\n\\n### Peace & love be with you.
