"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Let’s check in where I’m at with my 2022 goals. As much as possible, I’ll try to post a weekly update. Also helps maintain commitments (and doubles as a blog post!)\\n\\n7/8 Goals are **Green**.\\n\\n*Good progress on (most) fronts! Stayed (mostly) on track.*\\n\\n**Progress**\\n\\n*   \\\\[Triathlon] Completed 6/9 planned workouts and met with Triathlon friends to plan 12-week training block and discuss travel.\\n*   \\\\[Lose weight] Lost 1.9lbs on Slow Carb diet. Enjoyed cheat day immensely. Favorite cheat meal: Donut cooked in butter at 2am.\\n*   \\\\[Lake house] Saved $200 towards lake house account. But am trending $110 over budget for the month (need to reduce burn to get ahead of savings targets)\\n*   \\\\[Crypto Project] Started focusing deeply with [LinksDao](https://linksdao.io/) on community product and DAO operations. Absolutely incredible community and learning a lot.\\n*   \\\\[Crypto Project] Posted first video for my own project uiux.gg (site forthcoming), a [“teardown” video (need better word, it’s too negative) of Rabbithole.gg’s onboarding.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LHGsoe1HuU\\\\&t=1s)\\n*   \\\\[Blogging] Wrote 4 blog posts. Not 5 but more than 0! This is the one at biggest risk. With everything else sitting down to write is a challenge currently.\\n*   \\\\[Learn Chinese] 6-day streak (30 mins/day) on the excellent [Fluent Forever](https://fluent-forever.com/app/). Even had an aha moment at the grocery store. Walked up to the Spinach and said “Bo cai” and realized other greens have similar names.\\n*   \\\\[Read future books] 21% through Ray Diallo’s *[The Changing World Order](https://www.amazon.com/Changing-World-Order-Nations-Succeed/dp/1982160276/?maas=maas_adg_B0DF71C19F94DE6B0996A4872DB7D9DE_afap_abs\\\\&ref\\\\_=aa_maas)*. Love it.\\n\\n**Plans**\\n\\n*   \\\\[Triathlon] Last week of this training block ends Sunday. Then will do my Swim, Bike, and Run threshold tests to see improvement from 8 weeks ago. Also taking my 2nd body fat test!\\n*   \\\\[Lose weight] Keep on the four hour body baby!\\n*   \\\\[Lake House] Most of my spend has been variable, but actually my budget for “wants” is on track. Need to think through if all the supplements I’m taking are positive ROI.\\n*   In the next two weeks, I’ll go to my favorite local Magic The Gathering Store and talk to the owner. He should know someone who would be willing to be a mentor (necessary step to becoming a level 1 judge)\\n*   \\\\[Crypto Project] Plan to invest \\\\~20 hours/week in LinksDao for the time being.\\n*   \\\\[Crypto Project] Plan on releasing an onboarding “teardown” (again, need more positive word) on Thursday.\\n*   \\\\[Learn Chinese] Try to hit a 7 day streak. I’m convinced the app is great and just need to put in the time.\\n*   \\\\[Read future books] Finish *[The Changing World Order](https://www.amazon.com/Changing-World-Order-Nations-Succeed/dp/1982160276/?maas=maas_adg_B0DF71C19F94DE6B0996A4872DB7D9DE_afap_abs\\\\&ref\\\\_=aa_maas)* this weekend when traveling.\\n\\n**Problems**\\n\\n*   \\\\[Triathlon] For the first time in 16 weeks I missed a workout. Missed 3 because it snowed in Nashville, the Y was closed so I couldn’t swim and it was too icy to run outside. This was an extreme edge case. Not sweating it.\\n*   \\\\[Blogging] This is the one at biggest risk. With everything else sitting down to write is a challenge currently. Need to give myself permission to write shorter posts mixed with longer ones later.\\n*   \\\\[Level 1 magic judge] Made no progress here. It’s way lower on my priority list. I didn’t even PLAY magic this week because the snow made travel difficult.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1641973269,\"title\":\"Week 1 3Ps\"},\"digest\":\"FMDjNFeWBQ_rHVCFQqVoua0OHwiyi24RLrr4rEwcTlM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x34ce371934D701b69Cf83C03a3f1d2878a2BEf27\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bafMnNHrxgk65c2rHNSfjlpB4dpqckJRogdCL62_mmY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ISP-c5raBGoecu3zFg7FXOEZaTbPkWeMu3YoftWOpLg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"WfamJrltHDi9LRn1BWOTSuFZOClCYgSxD5UE32oAtyNhIWvUDYr7GX5fkXvlQgKg_rOO12-urZ1Ls0BJGiKnGg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xdcb2b1adbcee0b2b440676d8b9d885bb1fe52e4aa3e36eb86038180557be502a77bae19c27c074445c773ffa422e75d02eea0da8fbbbfe6de89553838c4ec04b1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bafMnNHrxgk65c2rHNSfjlpB4dpqckJRogdCL62_mmY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ISP-c5raBGoecu3zFg7FXOEZaTbPkWeMu3YoftWOpLg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"FMDjNFeWBQ_rHVCFQqVoua0OHwiyi24RLrr4rEwcTlM\"}"
