"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### \\\"We are born like this, into this. Into hospitals which are so expensive that it's cheaper to die. Into lawyers who charged so much, it's cheaper to plead guilty...Born into this, walking and living through this—dying because of this.\\\"\\n*[Charles Bukowski — Dinosauria, We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDiLfQUBnyA)*\\n\\nIf I think about my own community, as a Black American, our traditions are mostly oral being barred from reading or writing for over 200 years in American history. While we since have developed the most global cultural zeitgeist through literature, music, language, and other cultural markers that document our experiences, for a long time, we were the property of America. Undocumented human labor dying en masse for the benefits of the estranged Britons, and subject to the experimentation of bizarre proportions under other European countries. To be Black is to live in a transient truth; unknowing of our past selves and thrust in a world built from our backs we cannot claim nor own as our own. \\n\\nUntil today.\\n\\nI had the pleasure of being [interviewed by George Howard](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgehoward/2021/04/30/creative-immortality-ameer-carters-mint-fund-helps-bipoc-and-lgbtqia-creators-mint-their-first-nfts/?sh=2bac2bb94fa6), a passionate writer, educator, and lawyer who preaches “purpose not product” in a post in Forbes about [Mint Fund](https://themint.fund). We talked at length about black culture and the exploitation we’ve endured for centuries. One of his points stood out to me:\\n\\n\\n> *“This is something so near and dear to me...Black culture has had their voices silenced, their art appropriated by white people, with no or little-to-no credit, and certainly no financial benefit. You know for me the thing that absolutely destroys me is the South Bronx, in the late seventies, and DJ Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash actually taking Rock’n’Roll records — which were obviously built upon Black people’s rhythms — and Grandmaster Flash pulling the record backwards. To me, that was the gesture of reclamation. But even to this day, people kind of know Grandmaster Flash, but nobody knows Kool Herc, right? But everyone knows Eminem. Again, all props to Eminem, but this is why [Blockchain tech, social tokens, NFTs are] interesting to me: **The provenance of creation, and particularly as it resonates to the actual creators.** Not the rent seekers, not the people who just steal the ideas.”*\\n\\n\\nThe provenance of creation. Tracking value to and from the source transparently. Or what I like to call, “Creative Immortality”. With the advent of decentralized applications, **we have the opportunity to build a framework of perpetual wealth redistribution through attribution, patronage, community, and culture capital.** \\n\\nAs a participant in this space, my goal is to activate and engage Black Culture into crypto. To document and record our cultural past, and build our cultural future at the same time. In order to achieve that level of creative immortality, we need to be able to reconcile with the things we’ve already made. It doesn’t necessarily mean it has to be in the same form of an NFT, but it does mean that we should have all of our references available and easily accessible. I am reminded of institutions like our HBCUs that are constantly fighting for resources to preserve and teach our history. Or institutions like Yale or the MOMA who have profited from us without retribution. \\n\\nHow much of our work has been purchased over the years that has never seen the light of day? That has never been exhibited before, that hasn’t been intellectualized, that doesn't have the type of attention or appeal that centralized institutions are looking for. What if the artists of our past could have flourished had we seen ourselves in those galleries, publicly supported, and paid equitably?\\n\\nCrypto can enable that level of patronage at scale, if we anchor ourselves to act inclusively. \\n\\n---\\n\\n### “Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow/ It's a number game, but shit don't add up somehow/ Like I got, sixteen to thirty-two bars to rock it/ But only 15% of profits, ever see my pockets like—” \\n*[Mos Def, Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ir-zFC9nFE)*\\n\\n\\n\\nLet's face it: Out of the the $MM that have touched the hands of NFT artists, cultural communities can count on their fingers the amount of artists that have seen any significant portion of that. Micah Johnson's first Aku drop on Nifty Gateway, and the DAO Clash to acquire the work of Ix_Shells x TOR collaboration are the ONLY examples of black artists in the space (notwithstanding celebrities) that have had their works sold for over $1mm. \\n\\nThat's two fingers. The other 8? \\n\\n- (50 ETH)* $77.7k high for Carlos Marcial;\\n- (22 ETH) $55k high for Cory Van Lew; \\n- (11 ETH) $44k high for Osinachi;\\n- (10 ETH) $28k high for DIGITAL + Mighty33; \\n- (4 ETH) $16.4k high for Yatreda;\\n- (9.7 ETH) $16.1k high for Blacksneakers; \\n- (4 ETH) $11.6k high for Yosnier;\\n- (2.68 ETH) $11.1k high for Latasha (collab);\\n\\n\\nNow if we take these 10 artists out of the equation, for black artists, **our average HIGH ETH sale is roughly 1.79 ETH.**** \\n\\nThat sucks. \\n\\nEven if these artists manage to hodl their assets for as long as they can, as the cost of ETH rises, their holdings do not rise at the same rate making it increasingly harder for us to participate in other projects. Perhaps this speaks to a larger issue about ETH becoming more of a store of value than token to be exchanged—but ultimately, the disparity of asset accrual is not foreign to the black experience. While we have this \\\"early access\\\" to crypto, we must work toward broader redistribution of assets to prevent the same issues that plague us: income disparity, low wealth accrual, lack of access to funding, etc.\\n\\n---\\n\\nInclusion. Diversity. Equity. Buzzwords when spoken through hollow action. Powerful instruments of change when cultivated in the right hands. But let's be honest with ourselves—this shit is hard fucking work. Many don't want to talk about it. Many don't believe there's a problem. And many of us don't want to do shit about it. The fact remains, cultural work is undervalued. \\n\\nAnd that’s a problem.\\n\\nWe are at an inflection point in the digital art age where the same mistakes in traditional institutions are being made in cryptospaces:\\n\\n\\n---\\nAppendix:\\n\\n**Accounting for trading value of ETH at time of sale, not adjusted for current value.*\\n\\n** *This study is based off of the sales collected from a pool of 40 black artists. The sales account for highest historic USD value from ETH sale. There is a correlation of higher ETH = higher USD despite some outliers. This post and study will be updated as I collect more data.*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1621034120,\"title\":\"Creative Immortality: Combating Cultural Erasure Through Active Archivism + Curation\",\"publication\":\"sirsu\"},\"digest\":\"aY5NWo3tf__bWWvZ5slk61T2b6rgGDbXBRzjHSSw_O0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xEB95ff72EAb9e8D8fdb545FE15587AcCF410b42E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"g0prTex5sH12YlvI1YSz3RK4zPQ9NC6FAfZ6YLjoCU8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_qAGwWtU704Mjvat_zLKKpLgf-6_OnJv0PkQfZ8I9t4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"EMBXQfsfHu6N_CFVwGDkN090CChQF7aYiadvk5a3DIH6bhhljJkQzMYyCSf_43PJ0bj45LBgaL6jrM21PN9mKQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xefc5e6de4581cb792e6411321f942ad5e6fb72235d5c23693634c505922edd3601ea195ef82970b34422f27a05f2d6cb0e687a007f81234e975a90a8e14956ff1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on sirsu.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"g0prTex5sH12YlvI1YSz3RK4zPQ9NC6FAfZ6YLjoCU8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_qAGwWtU704Mjvat_zLKKpLgf-6_OnJv0PkQfZ8I9t4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"aY5NWo3tf__bWWvZ5slk61T2b6rgGDbXBRzjHSSw_O0\"}"
