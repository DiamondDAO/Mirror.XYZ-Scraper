Many of you (raising hands) are now wearing Nike shoes. Nike reported that in the fiscal year ending May 31, 2021, its revenue increased by 19% to $44.5 billion. But this is in the real world. What about in the meta universe?\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Wp2j1Nlf-S7TVM4iAeRae.png?height=1129&width=1450)\\n\\n## Why Nike is interested in the meta universe\\n\\nFor those who are not familiar with this concept, the easiest-but very incomplete-way to imagine the metaverse is to imagine yourself in a video game in real life. Nike will enter and provide very cool meta products.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aw1CeDkw7tZByQmLZ7M7L.png?height=930&width=1450)\\n\\nThis is not a joke. Nike attaches great importance to Metaverse.\\n\\nThe patent application of Meta Universe dating back to 2018 shows that Nike has been carefully stocking tools in order to conduct business in Meta Universe. These digital tools will include sports shoes, as well as virtual characters and other forms of virtual brands. Of course, Nike intends to sell you digital products (you will buy them because Nike knows how to make you want to own), but its meta-universe plan will revolve around the entire digital world.\\n\\nIs this why Nike became Nike? Of course, but if we choose to define it as creating a whole new revenue stream, as it has always done, then this is good for it. Someone will own a meta-universe item, it may be Nike.\\n\\n## The rules of the meta universe will be brand new to Nike\\n\\nNike needs to prepare for the damage caused by copying. In the real world, Nike has recently filed a lot of intellectual property (IP) lawsuits. However, in the meta-universe, replication will transcend the current concept of what is legal. The value of Nike's meta products will definitely be affected by what the company considers to be pirated and others call it an artist.\\n\\nIn the real world, there has recently been an art project called \\\"Museum of Forgeries\\\", which has important commercial application value. In short, Brooklyn art group Mschf bought an original Warhol painting for $20,000 and produced 999 accurate fakes. Then, it mixed the original works and sold all 1,000 \\\"possibly real\\\" Warhol works for $250 each, for a total of $250,000 and a profit of $230,000.\\n\\nThe same thing will happen in the meta universe. Some rare Nike products (we call them newly released shoes by sneaker lovers, or even the color of the shoes-called \\\"color matching\\\") will be true, some may be true, and some may be intentional or Unintentional fakes.\\n\\n## For the court, the meta universe is a new thing\\n\\nAs for how the court will ultimately deal with these meta-universe disputes, Samir Patel, a Miami lawyer and appointee of the Miami-Dade County Cryptocurrency Working Group, recently wrote on Twitter:\\n\\n> The judge's lack of understanding of blockchain technology is something that developers who think their invention circumvents the law did not expect at all. Judges make judgments based on what they know, not what you know.\\n>\\n> \\\\-Samir Patel (@SamirPatelLaw) October 26, 2021\\n\\nPatel and I discussed the reality of Xinyuan Universe and what a quick and cruel discovery it will be when the judge realizes that common law precedents will be more of a hindrance than a help when adjudicating metaverse cases. As Patel said:\\n\\n> \\\"Legal principles like real property rights, violation of wet contracts, and infringement of the copyright of human derivative works will govern the relationship in Metaverse (MV).\\\"\\n\\nHe continued: “So, when Nike wants to participate in Metaverse, whether it is through virtual storefronts, virtual character equipment, or creating new products specifically for Metaverse, then its lawyers need to engage in legal infringements or claims against Metaverse. Establish a connection between the real world.\\\"\\n\\nIn fact, very few judges (and even very few lawyers) have used or heard of the word \\\"meatspace\\\", which is a problem in itself. This term refers to our physical world, not cyberspace or virtual environments such as meta-universes.\\n\\nSo, yes, for the judge, the Metaverse claims will need to be simplified, at least in the beginning, in a common way, using traditional language, so that the judge will not lose his way.\\n\\n## Can Nike help establish a meta-universal legal structure?\\n\\nPatel saw a real opportunity. \\\"Nike has the resources to educate judges through trials because they can pay their lawyers to delay the proceedings, but other smaller petitioners will have a hard time persuading judges that they have virtual property that exists in a virtual land registry and is left to the center. Blockchain maintenance,\\\" he said.\\n\\nPatel explained to me that if he were to buy virtual land in Metaverse, the judge might treat the transaction as a sale of goods, rather than a real estate transfer. Since the regulations do not include or consider the concept of virtual real estate, virtual land cannot be registered in the virtual land registry because the registry is not managed by municipalities or sovereign states.\\n\\n\\\"So, if Nike wants to sell a pair of virtual sneakers, but fails to deliver the sneakers to the buyer, then this is a violation of the contract to sell sneakers. But the bargaining value exchange still needs to be articulated in the real world and may be recorded Come down,\\\" Patel explained.\\n\\nThis is a difficult problem for judges in practice, because there is no evidence that a contract has been concluded in Metaverse, such as an oral contract signed by two virtual characters. So, in this dispute, how does the judge make a ruling for one party? This is exactly the same as an oral contract in the real world. If virtual characters can prove their reliance on verbal contracts in the meta-universe, as they can in the real world, then there may be evidence to support the plaintiff’s claim.\\n\\n## The meta universe may be as full of litigation as the real world\\n\\nThere will be a large number of claims. If Nike has an opinion that its creation has been modified in the real world without its permission, and the defendant in the Nike lawsuit boldly replied that the modification is art, not the theft of intellectual property, just think of Metaverse. Patel pointed out:\\n\\n> \\\"If artificial intelligence is used to create landscapes or other virtual objects, intellectual property law will be tested in the meta-universe.\\\"\\n\\nHe added: \\\"This is because artificial intelligence-derived works are not protected by US copyright law. So, if I deploy AI in the metaverse and AI creates some great things, I don’t have any rights to the derivative works. , Other people can imitate the work and apply for copyright for themselves. Protecting one’s copyright will be extremely difficult, because the metaverse may be very large, and the infringer may be an entity that has deployed AI. The judge will use the real world Copyright law deals with these issues.\\\"\\n\\nThis leaves us with the only feasible way to change the way judges view and decide meta-universe cases: by changing our existing laws to adapt to virtual reality. If there is no such change, in the eyes of the judge, everything is the real world, and virtual reality does not exist as a legal reality.\\n\\nAs Patel pointed out, the real legal reality is: \\\"It would be prudent for Nike to hire lawyers who are proficient (I mean really proficient) in real estate, the Uniform Commercial Code, and blockchain technology experts.\\\"\\n\\nMetaverse provides a new virtual world with opportunities for creation, sale, purchase and prosecution. It will be very fascinating to observe through social, commercial and legal perspectives. Just the fact that Nike is ready to create, sell and litigate in this new field means that you should also be ready to meet the reality of the metaverse, which will soon appear on your computer or mobile phone.\",\"timestamp\":1639396035,\"title\":\"Buy it: Nike wants to bring sneaker lovers into the meta universe\"},\"digest\":\"2XJF7Ee4qJCCXUbDzvZjFrBTxuoPmPxzzoEsdmXmu2w\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xA2Df2F66174D4DfEff115c18AA7Eca13e962008F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"CdGwenhwOJP31avsmH3xUp3pzFjzjqjTc2mgDtDNuuY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JONJ4DqxpSL7ggvoUvu28rvEXJqDmkWRvstdzl0GfRo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"V0jawhqv-Jst2eGe1aCPe2e48ighm0TrskAuIa1yECANX4inXX2pwDmjsgjTwcP1SeFaoywygjrgQb_pu6nbug\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xadea8073c932af33a828c4d351e71b99c0f39607bb82f3a342444cc350cf5f1d23f2224bcd2c61c6b96eaa4c6b17c9c660f031b7e183b735b453c14db59e72d51c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"CdGwenhwOJP31avsmH3xUp3pzFjzjqjTc2mgDtDNuuY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JONJ4DqxpSL7ggvoUvu28rvEXJqDmkWRvstdzl0GfRo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"2XJF7Ee4qJCCXUbDzvZjFrBTxuoPmPxzzoEsdmXmu2w\"}"
