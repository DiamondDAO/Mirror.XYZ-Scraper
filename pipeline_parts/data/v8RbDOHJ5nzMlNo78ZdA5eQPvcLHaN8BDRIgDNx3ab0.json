Then the front and rear military expenses, the expenses of entertaining envoys and strategists, the expenses of materials such as glue and paint used for weapon maintenance, the expenses of maintaining chariots and armors, etc., consume thousands of gold every day. Only after preparing according to this standard can an army of 100,000 set out on the battlefield.\\n\\nTherefore, the army requires quick victory in battle, and if it is dragged on for a long time, the army will inevitably become exhausted and lose its spirit. Once the city is attacked, the troops will be exhausted, and the long-term battle outside the country will inevitably lead to insufficient financial resources of the country. If the army is exhausted from the long battle, its spirit is frustrated, its military strength is exhausted, and its domestic materials are exhausted, other princes will surely take advantage of the fire. In this way, even resourceful people have no good plan to save the peril. Therefore, in actual combat, I have only heard that generals lacking great skills are difficult to win quickly, but I have never seen a commander who is clever and skillful in long-term combat. There has never been a protracted war that is beneficial to the country. Therefore, without a detailed understanding of the harms of military use, it is impossible to fully understand the benefits of military use.\\n\\nThose who are good at using troops do not need to recruit troops again, and do not need to transport rations many times. Arms and equipment are supplied domestically, and food is sought from the enemy so that the army can be plentiful. The reason why the country was impoverished by the war was that the army had to travel long distances because of the expedition. Long-distance transportation inevitably leads to poverty among the people. The price of goods near the garrison will inevitably soar, and the soaring prices will inevitably lead to the depletion of materials, the exhaustion of materials and wealth, and the increase of taxes and labor. On the battlefield, the military is exhausted, the financial resources at home are exhausted, and the private property of the people is depleted by seven-tenths. Six-tenths of the public property was consumed due to the damage of vehicles, exhaustion of horses, loss of armor, bows and arrows, spears, shields, and bullock carts. Therefore, a wise general must solve the food and grass in the enemy country. One hour of food from the enemy country is equivalent to twenty minutes when it is shipped from the country, and one stone of fodder in the local area is equivalent to twenty stone when it is shipped from the country. Therefore, in order to make soldiers desperate to kill the enemy, they must be angry and motivated. To make the soldiers brave to seize the enemy's munitions and supplies, they must be rewarded with the seized property. Therefore, in a chariot battle, the one who grabs more than ten chariots will be rewarded for the first to grab the chariot. The chariots that are captured must be immediately changed to our flag, and the captured chariots must be incorporated into our team. Be kind to the captives, so that they have a heart of surrender. This is the way to defeat the enemy and make yourself stronger. Therefore, the most important and beneficial thing in combat is to win quickly, and the least suitable thing is to be protracted. A general who really knows how to use soldiers and knows the benefits and benefits of using them controls the life and death of the people and dominates the safety of the country.\",\"timestamp\":1642488483,\"title\":\"《孙子兵法》之【始计第二】（THE ART OF WAR-Begin to count second)\"},\"digest\":\"SO-e7E_IeyQ9OwQVYVcWbwmKM8T5aTlXcwnqLtYzYRM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xC22330943F8342F94Bef053c6547f88FA852510f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ynB4mkp4bjQSl41-nSws5kWK5cCdFswuTzfnnH1UpUk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zcvGtX6bM77UJmC1blv5lk3TkgAmlXX6zD2SIF2kri4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"f-ssQHgqDrH_2q7x-Ai5EUwfC6uvlMcfRo15OercBaXLHQNfaL0P9BIXpcGgOCnVDpUsR3Wv8LDLG9INc499Ww\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa0a9d78cc623e3bf4a41f68088450bc934f07754c19be2c446f84463f02dc0961c4f67b6c343c276b7e72aa3c6357ce77d8534f487f16a3f9473860b149442dd1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ynB4mkp4bjQSl41-nSws5kWK5cCdFswuTzfnnH1UpUk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zcvGtX6bM77UJmC1blv5lk3TkgAmlXX6zD2SIF2kri4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"yZVTUyrnuRtwc9hUFVah9uTWZ6Fh1-9BWQQoX26OQ68\"}"
