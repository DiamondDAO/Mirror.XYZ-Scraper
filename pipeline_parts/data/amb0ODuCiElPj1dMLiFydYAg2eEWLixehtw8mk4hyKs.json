There is little usefulness in overly metaphysical abstraction when we have real work to do.\\n\\nIn this chapter we will consider how blockchain technologies have approached the problem of the ‘truth’ state in a real-world setting with multiple participants, which is most relevant for a participatory ethics.[\\\\[2\\\\]](#_ftn2)\\n\\n*The question is: what is the truth state of all interactions within a system of communication?*\\n\\nThe main problem for any system of information communication or transaction is the so-called ‘byzantine problem’: how to communicate without reliance upon a central authority, and when the network of communication may be compromised by bad agents.\\n\\nBitcoin needed to solve a number of other very difficult and well-known security problems in order to create trusted transactions without the need for trust between participants, including proof of when an event took place without a single central clock.[\\\\[3\\\\]](#_ftn3)\\n\\n**“What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes … To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proof-of-work system”**\\n\\n(*Satoshi Nakamoto*)[\\\\[4\\\\]](#_ftn4)\\n\\nBitcoin solves the problem of time and bad agents by using ‘proof of work’, which can be considered an extraordinarily democratic process (in principle); since the network of computers storing the distributed and decentralised ledger of transactions collectively agrees on what the current ‘truth state’ of the ledger is. This is achieved by each truth snapshot (block) being determined by the completion of arbitrary and difficult mathematical problems that are memoryless (i.e., each attempt at a solution is a standalone problem requiring work).\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0\\\\*okUxbnJzN_wcQMKe?&size=medium)\\n\\nUnder this proof of work system all that matters in terms of solving the problem is the processing power of all participants at the time in question. For this reason, the problem difficulty scales in line with the processing power on the network, using a formula (on a suitably time-smoothed basis) that ensures approximately every ten minutes a new block of transactions is agreed upon whatever the amount of processing power available.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*b4hvks0nbwuDiPygCPBJSg.png)\\n\\nI have simplified the process, but in short if the network is building blocks more quickly than every ten minutes, then over time the difficulty increases:[\\\\[5\\\\]](#_ftn5)\\n\\nThe computer process that solves the arbitrary problem for that ten-minute block is the reconciler of all transactions in the block period. The difficulty (computational work required) of solving the problem is why it is named ‘proof of work’.\\n\\nThe protection against gaming of the system and cheating by double-spend or fraudulent recording of transactions is the cost in energy and computing of being able to create six blocks consecutively. Bitcoin only deems transactions to be irreversibly true — that is, determinative of the truth state of the ledger — when they have been contained within six blocks following the transaction.\\n\\nThe unavoidable and verifiable work required to solve the arbitrarily difficult mathematical problem is what also gives us a distributed, decentralised clock. Each node on the network therefore confirms whether a block that has been submitted is correct (including the rules relating to permitted time-stamping).\\n\\n**“The miners have to construct a perfect block, based on the shared rules that all nodes follow, and mine it with a correct solution to the proof of work. To do so, they expend a lot of electricity in mining, and if they cheat, all the electricity and effort is wasted.”**\\n\\n(*Andreas M. Antonopoulos*)[\\\\[6\\\\]](#_ftn6)\\n\\nObviously, there is a limit to such a ‘universal’ distributed clock. The speed of light determines the upper limit of the speed at which communication of any solution between different computers can take place and relativistic time dilation effects also apply. There is no absolute ‘ten-minute’ block anywhere in this universe.\\n\\nIn the case of the Moon, the communication delay is small and fixed (Bitcoin mining between computers on the Moon and Earth is possible). In the case of other planets, it is neither small nor fixed when factoring changes in where the Earth and those other planets are in respect of their orbits around the Sun.[\\\\[7\\\\]](#_ftn7)\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\\\*X_iWTVx76Wz6aMSgDwgicg.png?&size=medium)\\n\\nFor this reason, in practice only computers that are within an approximately similar space-time are able to work together on a cryptographic network like Bitcoin.\\n\\nObviously, the people of Mars could decide to run their own version of Bitcoin (Bitcoin Mars), and this would then work on a similar ten-minute block basis, but it would not be the same ledger as the Earth ledger and so could be seen as a local ledger running in parallel on its own relative time.\\n\\n*What about a person operating Bitcoin in the twin experiment?*\\n\\nImagine the ‘twin paradox’ experiment again, whereby at first the twins are communicating with each other, and both are solving the arbitrary proof-of-work problems and will continue to do so using exactly the same computers for the intervening period. Remember, the Earth twin (A) will have aged ten years and B will have aged eight years when A and B re-synchronise their relative space-times.\\n\\nWhen the twins compare each other’s blockchains on B’s return to Earth, A will notice that all of B’s clocks (including the amount of time taken for B’s computer to solve the arbitrary hash problems) have been running more slowly; B’s blockchain will have fewer blocks (105,120 fewer) because compared to A everything related to B (including his atoms, watch and computers) worked (ticked) more slowly.\\n\\nTo summarise the truth state in a ‘proof-of-work’ blockchain: everyone can communicate with each other using agreed rules without the requirement that participants rely on a trusted intermediary or trust each other.\\n\\nTruth here is determined for all on the basis that no single participant has universal power (in this case to control the network processing power) and no single participant has an absolute vantage point from which to determine the total state of play at any time or over a period of time. **Satoshi created a system of trusted transactions without the need for trust between each participant.**\\n\\nIn my opinion, if developments like blockchain technology do not lead to a more equitable distribution of power and wealth, we will have failed their wonderful potential.\\n\\nLet us return to the concept of ‘truth’ in an experimental participatory ethics. We need a system by which to reach consensus on the validity (ethical lawfulness) of a particular decision. We want as many people to participate as possible to improve the likelihood that useful information is included in the decision-making process. We know that no single person can have an absolute vantage point from which to make judgements and we are concerned about the risks inherent in having trusted representatives in a representative democracy or other forms of centralised government.\\n\\nObviously, having a secure and distributed network — for the widest possible range of people to make ethical decisions — in no way guarantees any decisions made will be relatively better in each case. In some cases, the consensus may make ethical decisions that might be deemed worse than those of a benevolent dictator.\\n\\n*Which person or process is better able to make ethical judgements affecting all life-forms?*\\n\\nThe key point is that over time this is the only way to make consistently better and safer ethical decisions for which everyone has some responsibility. In principle, resembling a blockchain in broad terms, a suitable empirical ethical framework requires a lot of work in order to determine the facts and the ethical decisions that flow from the facts. This encourages the decision-making beings in question to proceed carefully and slowly in most cases and, other than when facing a critical emergency, this slower speed and higher level of work should improve the outcomes.\\n\\nIn times of emergency, quicker decisions can be made (see later section — Consensus), but the quality of the decisions will often be impaired since the quality of the information is reduced and the time needed to make good judgements is also limited.\\n\\nFor the purposes of this section, I am leaving aside the many practical difficulties involved in securing a democratic blockchain process. The time required to develop the experimental ethics, proposed in Part II of this book, into a global participatory ethics with real power provides plenty of time for technology experts to resolve those issues.[\\\\[8\\\\]](#_ftn8)\\n\\n**“none of the frequently used consensus algorithms fully comply with the requirements of an online voting system. The consensus on the correctness of the blockchain and anonymity of the voters are only necessary, but not sufficient conditions for a real life voting. The blockchain technology has a real potential in developing a secure, trusted and inexpensive voting system, but there are many theoretical and practical issues that have to be dealt with before the technology will be accepted even for testing.”**\\n\\n(*Peter Racsko*)[\\\\[9\\\\]](#_ftn9)\\n\\nTo understand the comparison made between a suitable ethics and a distributed decentralised blockchain: consider the example of a book that attempts to create a participatory ethical framework — that is, the one you are reading right now.\\n\\nThis book is my personal telling of a complex story of life and ethics between life-forms. It benefits when people look at the draft and provide helpful feedback (on typos, spelling mistakes, mistakes in logic, science etc.). The narrative part of this book benefits from some limited feedback and interaction with other people, but it cannot be written by consensus. At a certain point, the more feedback sought, the harder it becomes to determine my own views, construct a readable narrative and ultimately finish the book.\\n\\nWhereas the ethical framework proposed later in this book is, by definition, not a series of personal subjective statements; it only has value if a wider community reads it and decides they can work with it and improve it. The most useful work of any modern suitable ethics only starts once one or more persons (other than me) decide to join in refining and improving it.\\n\\nThe heaviest lifting of any suitable ethics happens when there is a wide community of the willing involved in working through the main issues. Only then would such an ethical framework reach the point at which the widest possible community of sapient beings could be involved in making decisions using it (albeit at first only experimentally so).\\n\\nThe work by all of the diverse participants in a distributed, decentralised ethical framework requiring consensus can then in some respects be related to the process and value of the use of ‘proof of work’.\\n\\nWhilst the ethical decisions may be considered by some of better or worse quality, like Bitcoin, the extraordinary amount of effort required to have a properly functioning participatory ethical framework[\\\\[10\\\\]](#_ftn10) means that the better process should give us some confidence in a probabilistically (more likely) better quality of ethical decisions.\\n\\n**“Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, benevolence, were all my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!”**\\n\\n(*Charles Dickens*)[\\\\[11\\\\]](#_ftn11)\\n\\nEven if the reader is not persuaded that suitable information and consensus frameworks would be better than what we have now, perhaps they might concede that under such an approach at least all sapient beings would have collective responsibility for what we all do and the collective ability to change it if we realise what we do is not wise. We have never had a distributed ethical consensus machine; modern democratic processes are mostly a charade of distributed decision-making.\\n\\nThe first part of the twentieth century does not provide a good example of the benefits of centralised decision-making. If we all have ‘skin in the game’ of life, and must make mistakes and get it wrong, then let us all be responsible and pay the price of getting it wrong together. Let us create a collaborative equilibrium.\\n\\n**“Libertarians had it all wrong. They sought to shrink the State’s influence by participating in the democratic process. This has been and remains a hopeless, Sisyphean task. Like Tolkien’s Ungoliant, the State hungers without limit, and its most engaged constituents duly reward it with votes for more growth, receiving in exchange ever-greater entitlements.”**\\n\\n(*Nic Carter*)[\\\\[12\\\\]](#_ftn12)\\n\\nI can think of nothing more motivating to encourage a wholesale review and restructuring of our education systems, our use of media channels, our economies and our political structures than for the elites to begin to lose control and realise they are now subject to the wisdom or ignorance of the crowd.\\n\\nIt would highlight why we are as weak as the weakest link; how we all have skin in the game when it comes to how each of us lives, develops and learns. It would highlight the truth of how the conditions for each of us impact all of us.\\n\\n**“Homogeneous groups are great at doing what they do well, but they become progressively less able to investigate alternatives. Or, as March has famously argued, they spend too much time exploiting and not enough time exploring … No decision-making system is going to guarantee corporate success. The strategic decisions that corporations have to make are of mind-numbing complexity. But we know that the more power you give a single individual in the face of complexity and uncertainty, the more likely it is that bad decisions will get made.”**\\n\\n(*James Surowiecki*)[\\\\[13\\\\]](#_ftn13)\\n\\n*Would such a consensual ethical framework result in better decisions than those made by this author or you the reader?*\\n\\nGiven that there is no absolute position or vantage point from which to determine what is ‘better’, all I can mean by this is that, in the future, some other group might look at its decisions and determine by consensus that it was better than the likely decision made by an individual.\\n\\n**“None of our men are ‘experts.’ We have most unfortunately found it necessary to get rid of a man as soon as he thinks himself an expert because no one ever considers himself expert if he really knows his job … The moment one gets into the ‘expert’ state of mind a great number of things become impossible.”**\\n\\n(*Henry Ford*)\\n\\nGiven that there is no absolute position of ethical authority, we are left with probabilities and degrees of subjectivity and objectivity within a relativistic framework for any particular ethical decision. The question, particularly over many iterations and evolutions, then becomes: *will the ethical framework proposed tend to lead to more objective ethical decisions than those which would be made by one person or a small group of people?*\\n\\n**“The wisdom of the crowd is the collective opinion of a group of individuals rather than that of a single expert … An explanation for this phenomenon is that there is idiosyncratic noise associated with each individual judgment, and taking the average over a large number of responses will go some way toward canceling the effect of this noise.”**[\\\\[14\\\\]](#_ftn14)\\n\\nI could not have written and published this book without the help of Wikipedia and Google particularly. This book is more a work of curation than creation. In addition, many of the images in this book can only be included because of the great work done by Wikipedia and others to limit the restrictions on copyright to reasonable levels — to protect genuine individual creative effort and skill of photographers, rather than maintaining information monopolies over public information and old creative works.\\n\\n*Does anyone really think this book would be better if it were written by me alone, in a dark room, dictating to myself?*\\n\\nThe non-subjective value, if any, of this work is in its absorption of and interaction with the thoughts and art (work) of others. In addition, the ethical framework proposed in the latter part of this book could be developed into something that is potentially objective and may even have universal propositions of truth embedded within it.\\n\\nThat process must be evidence based and consensual; participants would need to agree on and rank discrete qualities and ordering of priorities; this is an example of combinatorial problem-solving.[\\\\[15\\\\]](#_ftn15)\\n\\n**“I invented nothing new. I simply assembled the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work…So it is with every new thing. Progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready, and then it is inevitable. To teach that a comparatively few men are responsible for the greatest forward steps of mankind is the worst sort of nonsense.”**\\n\\n(*Henry Ford*)[\\\\[16\\\\]](#_ftn16)\\n\\n![“A Warli painting by Jivya Soma Mashe, Thane district”, Wikipedia, photo by Jean-Pierre Dalbra, 2010 CE, CC BY 2.0.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UV3t97Z0zdQjk5C0ikQ6B.png?height=1200&width=1600&&size=medium)\\n\\n**“Diversity and independence are important because the best collective decisions are the product of disagreement and contest.”**\\n\\n(*James Surowiecki*)[\\\\[17\\\\]](#_ftn17)\\n\\nA final point of interest on cryptography, linking with the later section on entropy, is that it uses God’s or the universe’s own tricks to make cheating nearly impossible. Certain calculations are so difficult that the energy required to brute-force an attack on a secure wallet or transaction is the defensive moat.[\\\\[18\\\\]](#_ftn18)\\n\\nCryptography can rely upon the use of entropy to create a random number generator (RNG), such as by moving a mouse randomly, or through the exact environmental conditions of a server at a point in time.\\n\\n**“Along with a standard RNG method, programming languages usually provide a RNG specifically designed for cryptographic operations. This method is usually much more secure, because it draws entropy straight from the operating system. The result of such RNG is much harder to reproduce. You can’t do it by knowing the time of generation”**[\\\\[19\\\\]](#_ftn19)\\n\\nBlockchain cryptography has evolved new forms of public–private key pair technologies. This makes it very easy for everyone on the network to verify whether an individual has the authority they claim to have without anyone else being able to assume that same person’s identity (authority).\\n\\n**“Almost all public-key cryptography today is standardized on elliptic curves because ECC is much more efficient than RSA given the same level of security … Standard ECC keys are 256 bits, about 1/10 the size of standard RSA keys. Given the key sizes of 256 bits, it’s virtually guaranteed that no two randomly generated ECC keys will ever collide. Just to give you a sense how much more efficient ECC is than RSA: the computational energy required to crack a 228-bit RSA key would be enough to boil a teaspoon of water. The energy required to crack a 228-bit ECC key would be enough to boil all of the water on earth.”**[\\\\[20\\\\]](#_ftn20)\\n\\nThis gives rise to the concept of the secure private wallet (which generates transactions that are provably authorised) being your effective on-network identity. Additional developments in zero-knowledge proof technology allow verification without disclosure of sensitive personal data.[\\\\[21\\\\]](#_ftn21)\\n\\n**“In Bitcoin, your key pair is itself your identity. There is no other form of identity beyond the cryptographic keys … You might wonder: if a person is just their key pair, what’s to stop you from randomly generating someone else’s keys and impersonating them — or stealing all their bitcoins? … Given that Bitcoin’s cryptography uses 256-bit public keys, this means you’d need 2128 keys registered before you’re likely to ever see a single collision in a public key … one key for every carbon atom in every human that has ever existed. This is precisely what makes public-key cryptography feasible as a form of identity … the key space is so mind-bogglingly large.”**[\\\\[22\\\\]](#_ftn22)\\n\\nThe future is here and it is almost distributed.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*GRCZOcesXH31zcJ_nnHMkQ.png)\\n\\n![Pink Floyd \\\\[23\\\\]](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\\\*0FaKQr_aGWd9F-Ezfr2gIQ.png?&size=medium)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\ncontinued in:\\n\\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x6e2fBc139e37b43f4F29cC10B7BeDe36587f7306/RHRzdoI0VOfu7TKka9bwtLntK1hztgrAxhzdfhQYdaQ](https://mirror.xyz/0x6e2fBc139e37b43f4F29cC10B7BeDe36587f7306/RHRzdoI0VOfu7TKka9bwtLntK1hztgrAxhzdfhQYdaQ)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n[\\\\[1\\\\]](#_ftnref1) Albert Einstein, *Relativity*, 1916 CE.\\n\\n[\\\\[2\\\\]](#_ftnref2) Excepting the invariance or objectivity of any axiom in the ethics which is governed by normal scientific principles and conduct.
