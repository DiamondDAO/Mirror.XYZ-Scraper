The 18-year-old is one of nine trailblazers who this season became the first female players to enroll at La Masia, Barca's famed soccer academy where the likes of Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta and Xavi Hernandez all honed their skills.\\n\\nSince opening in 1979 as an old house next to Camp Nou, La Masia has never had female residents.\\n\\nBut the women's team has been knocking on the door for a long time, with Barcelona Femenino winning the Champions League, Liga Femenina and Copa de la Reina last season.\\n\\n\\\"This year they have given us La Masia, which is a gift,\\\" says Claudia, who for years had to travel an hour by car from her town of Girona just to be able to train with girls.\\n\\n![Jerseys bearing the names of Barcelona players are displayed at the club's La Masia academy](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iIbFh506edQUvRvg28mPK.png?height=800&width=1199)\\n\\nAfter playing for local rival Espanyol, she now represents Barca B and in the afternoons studies chemistry at university.\\n\\nShaken by a financial crisis and the unexpected departure of Messi, most of the good news around the club these days comes from the women's team.\\n\\nAs well as last season's treble, Barca's captain Alexia Putellas was chosen as UEFA's player of the year and is now also nominated, along with four teammates, for the Women's Ballon d'Or.\\n\\n\\\"It's a huge responsibility because we are the pioneers, but it's also nice to know that you are one of the first women to go to La Masia,\\\" says Laura Coronado, an 18-year-old goalkeeper.\\n\\n**Coronado's photo,** like that of the 105 others at La Masia spread across the club's five professional sports, now hangs in the reception of the more modern complex that replaced the original in 2011.\\n\\nGavi, the latest gem of the men's team, arrived when he was 11 years old and continues to live there. *The 19-year-old Ansu Fati is also a former resident.*\\n\\n\\\"The good thing we have at this club is the mirror is very clear,\\\" explains Markel Zubizarreta, sporting director of Barcelona Femenino. \\\"We just have to look at the men's side to see what we have to aim for.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1636624487,\"title\":\"La Masia's new arrivals kicking off Nou era\"},\"digest\":\"i1Es8efJOVzlE9RZs__DfQS8Jde2DdcHpCWxCBJaIxc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xadd86165A3caA9B1FbC066E3E0a1bA0a591F4058\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Ff_0Tr8gxv8pqJBh_7_6vx4ZbJ32bx9Vqmgz78r41Hw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"u0qDv52ik1n0lm8gZUlJFEowi9b4K6PiwSEZSTByZ8M\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ZyKDPNVdr-KfeTNEc0EjrBs-DLJgDQLl3j_k39vnaKF_cCTLCspnc4DHs7KFkmtdNaH4FJb59zr51dWGJVNKlA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe939d1e030deff14e5de404b4914dd94af676b776e509dcaeabbe8d4577e2b47381c5965c4f0adddfe063080ff241d4a36d49858f4cd1cbd88896bc138e491391c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Ff_0Tr8gxv8pqJBh_7_6vx4ZbJ32bx9Vqmgz78r41Hw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"u0qDv52ik1n0lm8gZUlJFEowi9b4K6PiwSEZSTByZ8M\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"i1Es8efJOVzlE9RZs__DfQS8Jde2DdcHpCWxCBJaIxc\"}"
