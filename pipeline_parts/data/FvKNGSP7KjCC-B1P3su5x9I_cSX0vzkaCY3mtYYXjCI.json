"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Abstract: Apprecio.finance (AF)\\n\\nAF is a decentralized inflation dashboard powered by IPFS, Filecoin and Chainlink. Its main goal is to be censor-resistant and, as such, provide an alternative to centralized measures such as the ones coming from Central Banks and national statistics agencies.\\n\\n## Introduction: Whoever Causes the Problem Cannot be Trusted to Measure it\\n\\nThe inspiration for AF came from the August 5, 2021, [1729 Newsletter](https://1729.com/inflation), famously sponsored by Bajali Srinivasan (@[balajis](https://twitter.com/balajis)):\\n\\n> “Inflation is a [monetary phenomenon](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781119205814.app2), a function of money printing. But it is also in part a social phenomenon, a function of mass psychology. If enough of the right people believe that inflation is going to happen, it will. As such, when inflation is happening, there is often a push to *censor* discussion of inflation itself, under the grounds that discussing the problem actually causes it in the first place. That is exactly what happened in [Argentina](https://qz.com/84838/argentines-are-now-allowed-to-know-the-real-rate-of-inflation-thanks-to-their-courts/) and [Venezuela](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2015/04/04/maduros-muzzle) over the last decade \\\\[…\\\\] And that is why the world needs a global, decentralized, censorship-resistant inflation dashboard.\\n>\\n> Why do we need an inflation dashboard? Because trillions of dollars have been [printed](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-the-feds-balance-sheet-is-expected-to-top-9-trillion-after-it-starts-reducing-its-monthly-asset-purchases-11626135642) over the last year – and it's not just dollars. Many countries besides the US have been printing fiat like mad to fund the response to COVID. Figures that shocked and stunned ten years ago ([$787B](https://www.politico.com/story/2009/02/senate-passes-787-billion-stimulus-bill-018837) for the bailout!) no longer warrant a headline today, though they may well result in headlines tomorrow.\\n>\\n> If inflation is a government-caused problem, we can't necessarily rely on government statistics like the [CPI](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/) to diagnose it or remediate it. Indeed, in places with high inflation, censorship and denial is the rule rather than the exception.”\\n\\n## AF Design\\n\\nTo achieve the greatest possible resistance to censorship, AF implements decentralization both on and off the chain.\\n\\n### Data Recollection\\n\\nThis step is crucial in maintaining decentralization. If the manipulation of the data source by a third party is able to significantly alter the measurement of AF’s inflation rate then the goal of censorship resistance would be compromised.\\n\\nThus for the Mexican case, our first measure, data is obtained from xxxx\\n\\nInformation from prices of common \",\"timestamp\":1637449123,\"title\":\"Apprecio.finance - Decentralized On-Chain Inflation Measures\"},\"digest\":\"GeYEoRFxF-HSaZr78pjeAx-3yTvcpAH7yd64bgL7ajI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xC606d7ea8fE2c134CC35874Bf05EEB76f6371F44\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Q-xx-StMMZOKJPBqJ1F7NISKpeAvov0klxsb1CqR7So\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JdyVX__aiOYj5zEYItX8hPEXlWIIIOn1gxLt0nUw9-M\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ACqEnm7WUeL_92_lrA-n-RFeoUtAoWuxxY3_ir4h367ykAkuJ-yQtfFZUKDHyQJw1UJN29bykVef8FTuuScZ6A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd54dc228145f076c0b1546a8acc65f0b00533bbe1d4685a0255c4840c0fc9c2834a0686567909f7a99b5cc275fe36961ef2d7f3437632fc6b89dc8ff9c188a321b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Q-xx-StMMZOKJPBqJ1F7NISKpeAvov0klxsb1CqR7So\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JdyVX__aiOYj5zEYItX8hPEXlWIIIOn1gxLt0nUw9-M\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"GeYEoRFxF-HSaZr78pjeAx-3yTvcpAH7yd64bgL7ajI\"}"
