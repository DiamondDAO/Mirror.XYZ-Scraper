"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### What is Kusama/ Polkadot ecosystems?\\n\\nKusama is a scalable network of specialized blockchains built using Substrate and nearly the same codebase as Polkadot. The network is an experimental development environment for teams who want to move fast and innovate on Kusama, or prepare for deployment on Polkadot.\\n\\n### What is MoonRiver? What is MVOR?\\n\\nMoonriver is a canary network of Moonbeam. Other projects will be able to test their code base on Moonriver, and only then deploy to Moonbeam. The Moonriver has already been launched and is being traded, because it has a faster process of obtaining a parachain slot. Moonriver is a full Ethereum-like environment and works with industry-standard Ethereum tools, DApps, and protocols.\\n\\nMoonriver (MOVR) is the utility token of the Moonriver Network, Moonbeam’s Kusama deployment that serves as a “CanaryNet” to the Moonbeam Network.\\n\\n### What’s the Dexes in MoonRiver network.\\n\\nThe best way to get the popular Dexes in MoonRiver is by check this website. <https://defillama.com/chain/Moonriver>\\n\\n1. Bridge Fund from other chains (ETH,BSC, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, Polkadot) using **RelayChain bridge** (The cross chain asset mainly used in Solarbeam website)\\n   * Go to DEX Solarbeam. <https://app.solarbeam.io/>\\n   * Go to Bridge page to bridge your asset from other Chains to Moonriver.\\n   * For ETH, BSC, the bridge fee is 0, but user still have to pay the transactions fee in from chain network. (For BSC, normally it toke around 5-15 mins to complete the bridge). User can check History Tab for bridge status.\\n   * Get the $MVOR faucet for first transactions. Go to Bridge tab => Choose Faucet.\\n   * Once all the funds transfer is completed and the faucet $MVOR transfer is complete, then user is ready to do their first transaction in MoonRiver.\\n     * Supported Chains and Asset Type\\n       * ETH: DAI,ETH,USDC,USDT,WBTC and so on\\n       * BSC: BNB, BUSD, LAIKA,BIFI\\n       * Avalanche: AVAX and others through RelayChain bridge\\n       * Polygon: Matic and others through RelayChain bridge\\n       * Fantom: WFTM, SPELL, MIM through RelayChain bridge\\n       * Polkadot: DOT through RelayChain bridge\\n2. Bridge Fund from other chains (ETH,BSC, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, Polkadot) using Wan Bridge (The cross chain asset mainly used in Huckleberry website)\\n   * Go to DEX Huckleberry. <https://www.huckleberry.finance/#/swap>\\n   * Go to Bridge Page. <https://bridge.wanchain.org/#/>\\n   * The detail steps can found in Wanchain docs <https://medium.com/wanchain-foundation/guide-crosschain-transactions-with-the-new-wanbridge-web-b806da1dcca1>\\n   * The bridge fee is 0, but user still have to pay the transactions fee in from chain network.\\n   * Once all the funds transfer is completed, user can enjoy the MoonRiver low fee and high speed.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ivQiTwVzq5sqDg4pxvwuD.png?height=366&width=1204)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1635809777,\"title\":\"Bridge the Funds to MoonRiver Guide\"},\"digest\":\"hSeOQO_vmmL5J73VfQYj8SPHrPjjXmJh_frt6VMipTE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x241e25c9d15b5E7FB007B5E028C4ce8694893870\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Wat5qhlR56L67FlC9WLxU6Kfs8wahaXUmBF7RUmuUxo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"v214oOg5qUo_U1xq-1gehZcLALut1-jRzW9kUyqlEkQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ptZbmFkGq4kXNO74VaKt544FD8doxfP_wUaQrPEhAoingsOdkcaPIdQXUHvCKuZ9UkL6e4BuGLKlvZRYtQbzyg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4c07bfb83bb1ad1afe7b18dfdb90a84f5a9cd1402bc422ddd797c8e3e89fa6e75419a4a06482af12188218194966e635dce7cc5edf8a1b2a59ea6fb944a66bd51c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Wat5qhlR56L67FlC9WLxU6Kfs8wahaXUmBF7RUmuUxo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"v214oOg5qUo_U1xq-1gehZcLALut1-jRzW9kUyqlEkQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"MdeAsOIMY82eZMoYlyg5btCxIBZ3ow6pwqlVgSONfko\"}"
