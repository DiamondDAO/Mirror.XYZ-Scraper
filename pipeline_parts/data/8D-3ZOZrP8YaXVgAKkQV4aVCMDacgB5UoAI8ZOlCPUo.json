"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"TLDR;\\nNew Order is a community led project so we can't stay true to our core values without building this project hand in hand with you! To encourage participation, we are launching a Contributor Program that any interested member can participate in.\\n\\nTo learn more, please refer to [our Notion page](https://new-order.notion.site/Contributor-Dashboard-f09371abaf3048d1a0f706b971010933), where each workstream is outlined with relevant tasks that need completion. During the pre-launch of our platform, contributors will be rewarded with non-transferable tokens that can be redeemed on launch.\\n\\n**--**\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nWe firmly believe that the success of our project is derived from our community.\\n\\nSince New Order is a DAO first and foremost, we will be launching with a strong emphasis on onboarding and community engagement.\\n\\nWe are not a business nor a company, we are a community owned effort that seeks to empower projects through combining our core abilities with the great ideas of community founders.\\n\\nTo build this project together, we will be launching a Contributor Program to ensure that even prior to genesis our approach is shaped by the community.\\n\\nOur core team has kickstarted the project, laying the groundwork for success, but it will be the community that builds on this foundation!\\n\\n## New Order Contributor Program\\n\\nThere are several ways to get involved with our network. First things first, to become a participating member of the DAO, you can follow the steps below:\\n\\n1. Explore our social media presence, following us on all [platforms](https://linktr.ee/NewOrder.Network) to keep up-to-date on new developments as we approach our token generation event.\\n2. We ask that interested users [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/TUaSK6RA9S) and choose a workstream that best suits their strengths. In the chosen workstream, please introduce yourself to everyone and tell us your skills and background so that we can send tasks your way.\\n3. Check out our [Notion](https://new-order.notion.site/Contributor-Dashboard-f09371abaf3048d1a0f706b971010933) page that will have tasks outlined for each workstream. You can complete a task and submit the completed details through the included Airtable link.\\n4. Lastly, to stay current with news and developments of New Order you should join our weekly calls on [Discord](https://discord.gg/TUaSK6RA9S) which will be posted under the #announcements channel.\\n\\n### How will it Work?\\n\\nTo achieve our goal of becoming the YC of DeFi, we rely on our community! Our goal is to build a system that allows the community to align on a vision, while leading the key roles of the DAO.\\n\\nContribution opportunities span from development work, token engineering and governance improvements to portfolio management contributions and enhancing yield strategies.\\n\\nWith the contributor program we want to make sure the New Orders governance token is used to manage and build a sustainable DAO that anyone is able to participate in.\\n\\nWe made sure that the available tasks are of different difficulty levels so that all members can get involved. **Contributors can always submit new ideas for tasks on Notion**, and discuss their importance to the project's development with the core team.\\n\\nAs mentioned, contributors will earn tokens which will be distributed upon launch! More details will be announced in Discord.\\n\\n### Workstreams\\n\\nOur contributor program has many different projects / tasks that New Order needs completed. There are tasks from every skill level so anyone can contribute regardless of ability.\\n\\nThe available workstreams are below:\\n \\n **Treasury Management**\\nFind new and unique ways to channel the DAO treasury to increase its profits through yield farming opportunities, staking programs, etc. Collaborate with other workstreams to see what the community wants to do and potentially earn performance fees from vaults we deploy.\\n\\n**Engineering**\\nAre you a builder? Let’s talk. We’re looking for talented people to help not only our existing three projects - Redacted, H2O and OptiFi - but in executing ideas the community comes up with. These can be forks, dashboards, anything that is useful to the DeFi eco-system.\\n\\n**Partnerships**\\nThe crypto space is all about partnerships - if you have frens on other teams that want to work together then let us know about them. We’re open to AMAs, Twitter spaces, joint projects with our OHMies, educational content and more.\\n\\n**Venture**\\nAre you great at finding project gems in crypto? Help us analyze technical, business, legal and token economics of potential partner projects that are submitted to New Order to make sure they are aligned with the DAOs mission / vision and usefulness in the dApp ecosystem.\\n\\n**Community and Content**\\nTo assist with brand development of the DAO and dApps, designers will be rewarded for creating unique graphics, banners, logos etc. to further promote and develop the look, feel and experience of being part of the New Order community.\\n\\n**Marketing**\\nContributors with great community management experience can assist in moderating and generating all types of content for our social media platforms. We also require help in operating our Discord, Twitter, Forum, and other platforms.\\n\\n**//------**\\n\\nThat’s it for now - head on over to [our Contributor Program page](https://new-order.notion.site/Contributor-Dashboard-f09371abaf3048d1a0f706b971010933) and get started now.\",\"timestamp\":1637951498,\"title\":\"Overview of the Contributor Program\"},\"digest\":\"u-INVUheilf6S273GXMqpo79apmS_crSDkUl7s71DeU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x13c5432CfC12bA1f32B6090d1a09cf0Efe9C95Bd\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bLxmZHYxxW-wpOQV53_bn7B2ra06Ydwmsyr-86x7BMU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"g55snd5wNjs7gMfvLmi-DflTVLp-y738fCdqrf6Km6E\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"oCRtwMdtkNGNXR4IlRQ_1LxCZshMo5ftKGEM9BSdZaF3N_Wd-5X3FDZpQsU81XBKpKOTczqBZXMAkyczR27rSw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xdcf1146b589225fc78db761c2d2cb97505fbd3ac2c2178ef50daaef920c97a132a6bbbba36424c357e09be5893dfa257ff9eb984f268b91c3d9df5a54fed27c21c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bLxmZHYxxW-wpOQV53_bn7B2ra06Ydwmsyr-86x7BMU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"g55snd5wNjs7gMfvLmi-DflTVLp-y738fCdqrf6Km6E\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Oy-pVq5aTXCXwWpEJz_dWgkvU_vA_HOfW73lrw2Qhhw\"}"
