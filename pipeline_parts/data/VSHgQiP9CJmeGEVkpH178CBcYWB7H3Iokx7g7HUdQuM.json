"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I once read in a book that there is a distance between life and death, called life, and how to walk through this distance, called life, so, in the growing time, I think most is why I was born, and then, and how to live. I have always thought that life has a great relationship with life, the single life, let me have a kind of inexplicable confusion. Every day, I'm like a robot, doing the same thing over and over again. Get up, eat, go to class, do your homework, go to bed. It chills me to think that every day has been like the first, and I even wonder if I am still alive. I often ask myself, why are you still alive if your life has no meaning?\\n\\nI've tried to use technology to solve this abstract problem, but it turns out that science can't explain spiritual puzzles. Aspiring people on the Internet discuss the meaning of life. Some people believe that the meaning of life lies in the contribution to society: life is too short to make a contribution to the benefit of mankind, and your life is full of significance to the whole society. Some people retort that the meaning of life lies in thoughts: some people live as if they were dead, and some people die and still live. Life is finite, thought is infinite, and the finite life rests on infinite thought, and only life and death are meaningful. People express their own thoughts, and some even say that the meaning of life is to find the meaning of life.\\n\\nFor now, if I were asked to express the meaning of life, I would say that life itself is meaningless. If there is meaning, it is the things themselves that give life a meaning.\\n\\nFor the Earth, for example, the meaning of life is to bring vitality to the earth. For a nation, the meaning of life lies in one's contribution...\\n\\nTherefore, the meaning of life is different for different things, and the diffusion of thinking leads to the conclusion that the meaning of life is different for different people.\\n\\nA scientist might say that the meaning of life is to create.\\n\\nA thinker might say that the meaning of life is to think.\\n\\nThe meaning of life lies in the pursuit of happiness.\\n\\nThe meaning of life for the very poor is the pursuit of wealth.\\n\\nPerhaps, then, the meaning of life lies in meeting needs and achieving goals. Needs and goals are fulfilled, life is no longer a soulless shell, and each life is bouncing on the earth, continuing its journey in pursuit of life's meaning!\\n\\n【 Chapter 3 】\\n\\nIn the dark of night, I often lie in bed and wonder: what is life? Anyway, human life is limited, it is impossible to live in this beautiful world forever, one day will be and relatives, and the world to say goodbye. So what's the point of living in this world?\\n\\nOne day, I read a very interesting story in a book:\\n\\nIn one zoo, the keeper fed a plate of meat to the boa constrictors every day. One day the keeper suddenly wanted to see what it would be like to feed a boa constrictor chicken. So he put a live chicken in the boa constrictor's cage.\\n\\nThe chicken was suddenly in trouble, but nothing could be done, for it was now in the snake's cage. But it thought, anyway is dead, why sit and wait for death ah! Go fight and have a chance to live. This heart a horizontal, it hard to fly up, towards the boa constrictor hard to peck. The boa constrictor was caught off guard by the sudden attack and was unable to fight back. An hour later, the boa constrictor was pecked to death by the chickens.\\n\\nThe next day, the keeper came in and saw this. He was very surprised. He was moved by the chicken's courage and finally set the chicken free.\\n\\nThe article, though short, inspired me a lot. It is because of constant suffering that people become strong. Greene said, \\\"The secret of success in life is known only to those who have not yet succeeded in their struggle.\\\" That is to challenge the defeat of life, to achieve the value of life.\\n\\nOur life is limited, but it can embody infinite value. We should also not be discouraged in the face of setbacks, do not bow in the face of difficulties, try our best to shine for the country, for the society, to achieve the greatest significance of life.\",\"timestamp\":1640144912,\"title\":\"Meaning of life\"},\"digest\":\"02X_rcmCWMRYk5b_4qsXjb7X5I2AGBXbGLBpAJ9lnL4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x43469718666Fbf0d76D53D1aa5E8ADaa51Aa03c5\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"XHgd_Tei1BaWiAFpcTa-VYFaItRRXtwudKVUael7UN0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"INOGUJeyWXbkYR8mQV0bHqCJ6YXg97j9Iwfdnmq0dWw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"F0Gnd9lZSlg_hkUzAPwsMm90Vu8UJwkZqC9eUfjlSOTcdtZ_LKS8fJwVJcnpuCbI7QaDssT4OIjoeIzpjvdl2g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x00b2a162fb2479d064d4da35b9a9db2fbe1b998e17d234eb85a30c66e3dcb9703c2a7437e4da7e5d5508ee2c5875c78f1640b4a62cece88128313bf338c2e28f1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"XHgd_Tei1BaWiAFpcTa-VYFaItRRXtwudKVUael7UN0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"INOGUJeyWXbkYR8mQV0bHqCJ6YXg97j9Iwfdnmq0dWw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"02X_rcmCWMRYk5b_4qsXjb7X5I2AGBXbGLBpAJ9lnL4\"}"
