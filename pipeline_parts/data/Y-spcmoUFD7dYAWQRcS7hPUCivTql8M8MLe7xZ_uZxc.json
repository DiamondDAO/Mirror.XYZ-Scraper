He thought AL was there.He saw a flashing light then a ping from the Magpie.”MESSAGE WAITING. MESSAGE WAITING.”Jake Jr. waved his hand to listen. A holostream of AL began.\\n\\n\\\"Jakey. If you're seeing this then it all worked. But I made a few changes to the plan. It wouldn't be like my dad's plan. Or your dad's plans. It was my plan. I trained for years but I also learned too and made some last minute changes.\\n\\nWhat was tried before failed. I had to find a new way to succeed. We have to leave old answers behind so that we can answer new questions. The question was why am I here? Me?My dad made me as an answer. I spent my life finding the right questions for me. Once I found them, I knew what to do.\\n\\nMy plan was to \\\"help\\\" and not stop the Grand Halt, just not in the way they expected.\\n\\nThis was more important than revenge. This was more effective than rescue. Nobody has to rush out of the solar system as refugees. They will leave as explorers when they're ready. June and Elena will leave on their own terms.\\n\\nInstead of evacuating all of you, I gave everyone who wanted to do the Grand Halt their wish. I used the Array to open a special 'Fold and gave them the world they wanted.\\n\\nThe price was me making sure they stay there. I'm also keeping this use of the Manifold out of humanity's hands. You're not ready for it. Yet.\\n\\nYou never had a life where you could just breathe air, and feel the sun on your face. Your mom and dad never had it easy. My mom and dad never had it easy.\\n\\nI think they would be happy with how this worked out. You're going to be okay. Do your best with your life. You can do it.\\\"\\n\\nEnd message.Jake Chinua Tagore, Jr. smiled. He felt the sunlight on his face.\",\"timestamp\":1633972535,\"title\":\"2921: 3.29.2 The Evacuation, Pt.2, 2921\"},\"digest\":\"sHqkeuWNJHvzPvh2TnM8W4PgOCb1Fohq_CTB6qd1ksY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"MS6ri_V3nGGDrHPJXXJmA_L7MGGXPRDivqCD3LsQxhKkvKdIQAlzvBRHh7k-bVsnfv2n-7VCWjkS05JnVyOLxA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"_SMbQ8qhwFdqbkjn6zqPtizC3jL6YsAOmXU9uxUMx5k\"}"
