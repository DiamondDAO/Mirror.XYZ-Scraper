DeFi TVL will exceed $1 T USD\\n 2. On-chain reputation will replace the new protocol's ridiculous \\\"whitelisting\\\" process\\n 3. Argent and Dharma will both launch tokens, but will announce them earlier to promote mainstream mobile DeFi adoption\\n 4. UST will remain the #1 decentralized stablecoin, and will grow faster than USDT/USDC\\n 5. Cross-chain bridging infrastructure will be a huge growth area and be built into DEX, revenue aggregators, cryptocurrency marketplaces and other important DApps\\n 6. There will be 9-digit DeFi vulnerabilities, but the total number of vulnerabilities will be less than half of what it will be in 2021\\n 7. Starting in 2021, most \\\"meta-universe\\\" returns will be similar to DeFi\\n 8.

Under-collateralized lending via KYC and credit mandates will become a growing narrative, with Aave ARC and Maple Finance being the clear leaders, and Compound Treasury a close second.\\n10. The largest dollar-denominated short sales will come from the ZKSync ecosystem; Zapper, Zerion and DeBank will all make short sales\\n11. NFTFi will be an important narrative. NFTs from early adopters can be exchanged for tokens, NFTs for reputation/access gating (e.g., Yearn Blue Pill), NFTs that generate revenue\\n12. A major CEX will partner with Rocket Pool for ETH pledging in an attempt to show support for decentralization. cex will run nodes as well as on-board clients to rETH.\\n\\n**Layer 1.**\\n\\n1.

Jack Dorsey will continue to be the suprematist of BTC and drive DeFi on Bitcoin/Lightning Network forward by merging elements into Block.\\n8. DeFi on Bitcoin will not be widely adopted and TVL will grow less than the top SC layers (ETH, BNB, SOL, LUNA, AMAX, ADA, DOT, MATIC, ALGO, NEAR)\\n9. Major Layer 1 blockchains (> $5b market cap) will be under 51% attack due to lack of sufficient decentralization\\n\\n**WEB3 Culture.**\\n\\n1. Everyone needs interns due to the expanding multi-chain world\\n2. The trend of employees working for Web3 and crypto natively (builders, DAOs, investors) leaving corporate jobs is not a passing fad and will continue\\n3.

The growth of cryptocurrencies will largely depend on macroeconomic policies and behave as a high beta asset for the S&P 500 index. In the event of high inflation, rate hikes and accelerated tapering (hawkish Fed policy), cryptocurrencies will enter a bear market. otoh, a dovish Fed is bullish on cryptocurrencies and inflows/returns will be better than TradFi. the latter scenario and a sustained bull market will play out in 2022.\\n7.
