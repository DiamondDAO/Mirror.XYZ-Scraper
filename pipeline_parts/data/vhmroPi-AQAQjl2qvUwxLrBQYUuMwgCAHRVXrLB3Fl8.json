"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"To vice and folly to confine the jest,\\nSets half the world, God knows, against the rest;\\nDid not the sneer of more impartial men\\nAt sense and virtue, balance all again.\\nJudicious wits spread wide the ridicule,\\nAnd charitably comfort knave and fool.\\nP.  Dear sir, forgive the prejudice of youth;\\nAdieu distinction, satire, warmth, and truth!\\nCome, harmless characters, that no one hit;\\nCome, Henley's oratory, Osborne's wit!\\nThe honey dropping from Favonio's tongue,\\nThe flowers of Bubo, and the flow of Y--ng!\\nThe gracious dew of pulpit eloquence,\\nAnd all the well-whipped cream of courtly sense,\\nThat first was H--vy's, F---'s next, and then\\nThe S---te's, and then H--vy's once again.\\nO, come, that easy Ciceronian style,\\nSo Latin, yet so English all the while,\\nAs, though the pride of Middleton and Bland,\\nAll boys may read, and girls may understand!\\nThen might I sing, without the least offence,\\nAnd all I sung should be the nation's sense;\\nOr teach the melancholy muse to mourn,\\nHang the sad verse on Carolina's urn,\\nAnd hail her passage to the realms of rest,\\nAll parts performed, and all her children blessed!\\nSo--satire is no more--I feel it die--\\nNo Gazetteer more innocent than I--\\nAnd let, a' God's name, every fool and knave\\nBe graced through life, and flattered in his grave.\\nF.  Why so? if satire knows its time and place\\nYou still may lash the greatest--in disgrace:\\nFor merit will by turns forsake them all;\\nWould you know when? exactly when they fall.\\nBut let all satire in all changes spare\\nImmortal S--k, and grave De--re.\\nSilent and soft, as saints remove to heaven,\\nAll ties dissolved and every sin forgiven,\\nThese may some gentle ministerial wing\\nReceive, and place for ever near a king!\\nThere, where no passion, pride, or shame transport,\\nLulled with the sweet nepenthe of a Court;\\nThere, where no father's, brother's, friend's disgrace\\nOnce break their rest, or stir them from their place:\\nBut past the sense of human miseries,\\nAll tears are wiped for ever from all eyes;\\nNo cheek is known to blush, no heart to throb,\\nSave when they lose a question, or a job.\\nP.
