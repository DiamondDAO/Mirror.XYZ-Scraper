"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Tokenization can actually be understood as a real estate certificate issued to real estate. Many rural lands in China do not have a real estate certificate. There is no real estate certificate for the relocated house, and the homestead does not have a real estate certificate from the Land Bureau.\\n\\n \\n\\nIs a house without a real estate certificate not a house? I have built a house by myself, can I issue a real estate certificate to myself at will?\\n\\n \\n\\nIsn't it the same when switching to NFT logic? Who has issued this token? Who is it sent to? The tokenization of physical assets require a centralized authority similar to the Housing Management Bureau.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe crypto native asset though can be different, since the digital world can be truly decentralized.\\n\\n \\n\\nSo in order to avoid complicated situations, all tokenized assets must be digital. And do not get involved in the business of physical assets tokenization before the government takes part in it.\\n\\n \\n\\nHowever, even if the physical assets are to be tokenized, they have to be assets that haven’t been made yet. For the completed assets, the existing assets will have very complicated problems. The shots of sports stars are made into NFTs. Does the copyright belong to the stars or to the league or the team? This is not a problem, it can be resolved through a contract. The artist’s NFT works will soon be recognized by the gallery and regulated in the new contract. At present, the market is not large enough to attract enough attention.\\n\\n \",\"timestamp\":1641120221,\"title\":\"Capsule（14.5.2021）The Analogy of NFT and Real Estate Certificate\"},\"digest\":\"mHSfn-dHHyfdoKnc7tulS2GgAd1xMJUFUbgAj69Q_CU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xE828f8bE1a3CB994133936fB4D9A708a7D192462\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"30oV-kOFSC9lQBdHEarttZfxjliQz8okqoKZUNLBj88\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"oE3PBJa5icihwzV4Vo38ifbPXR099aDCDl_ixLAomho\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"3f8Wi0hv6wqcjooJd9zTDtFGjdy35wqa07uUKKwI5AZ4ft0MSOiC7krlUvBczvphUh9oI_paCGDq7rmgKWY2sg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x31cd513577813d56dac188e35743ecb529db0e03e283593e4cc226acb4e7611a5a06f0e8d95703de997b6dc6c43ffc9841842d11590b5c80d29579b563e532581b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"30oV-kOFSC9lQBdHEarttZfxjliQz8okqoKZUNLBj88\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"oE3PBJa5icihwzV4Vo38ifbPXR099aDCDl_ixLAomho\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"LvQOx0859eB0dF1IN7UZDLPy09KiNC3-RI0VZy-IJco\"}"
