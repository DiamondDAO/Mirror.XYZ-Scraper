If you don’t understand how money and credit work, you can’t understand how the systems works, and if you don’t understand how the system works, you can’t understand what’s coming at you.\\n\\n# The Timeless and Universal Fundamentals of Money and Credit\\n\\nAll entities, people, companies, nonprofit organizations, and governments, deal with the same basic financial realities and always have. They have money that comes in and money that goes out that, when netted, make up their net income. These flows are measured in numbers that appear in income statements. If an entity brings in more than it spends, it has a profit that causes its savings to go up. If it spends more than it earns, its savings go down, or it makes up the difference by borrowing or taking money from someone else. If an entity has many more assets than liabilities, it can spend above its income by selling assets until the money runs out, at which point it has to slash its expenses. If it doesn’t have much more in assets than it has in liabilities and its income falls beneath the amount it needs to pay out to cover the total of its operating expenses and its debt-service expenses, it will have to cut its expenses or will default or restructure its debts.\\n\\nThe way entities collectively handle their finances as reflected in their income statements and balance sheets is the biggest driver of changes in internal and world orders. If you can take your understanding of your own income, expense, and savings, imagine how that applies to others, and put them together, you will see how the whole thing works.\\n\\nFor example, since one entity’s spending is another’s income, when one entity cuts its expenses, that will hurt not just that entity, but it will also hurt others who depend on that spending to earn income. Similarly, since an entity’s debts are another's assets, an entity that defaults reduces other entities’ assets, which requires them to cut their spending. This dynamic produces a self-reinforcing downward debt and economic contraction that becomes a political issue as people argue over how to divide the shrunken pie.\\n\\nDebt eats equity. What I mean by that is that debts have to be paid above all else. For example, if you own a house and you cannot make the mortgage payments, the house will be sold or taken away. In other words, the creditor will get paid ahead of the owner of the house. As a result, when your income is less than your expenses and your assets are less than your liabilities, you are on the way to having to sell your assets.\\n\\nThere isn’t a fixed amount of money and credit in existence. Money and credit can easily be created by central banks. People, companies, nonprofit organizations, and governments like it when central banks make a lot of money and credit because it gives them more spending power. When the money and credit are spent, it makes most goods, services, and investment assets go up in price. It also creates a debt that has to be repaid, which requires people, companies, nonprofit organizations, and governments to spend less than they earn, which is difficult and painful. That is why money, credit, debt, and economic activity are inherently cyclical. In the credit-creation phase, demand for goods, services, and investment assets and the production of them are both strong, and in the debt-repayment phase, both are weak.\\n\\nBut what if the debts never had to be paid back?\\n\\nThis is the exact thing that happened in the wake of the economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Many versions of this have happened many times in history. Who pays? It is back for those outside the central bank who still hold the debts as assets, cash and bonds, who won’t get returns that would preserve their purchasing power.\\n\\nThe biggest problem that we now collectively face is that for many people, companies, nonprofit organizations, and governments, their incomes are low in relation to their expenses, and their debts and other liabilities are very large relative to the value of their assets. The liabilities are enormous relative to the net incomes and the asset values that are required to meet those obligations, so they are financially weak, but they don’t look that way because they spend a lot financed by borrowing.\\n\\nIn summary, these basic financial realities work for all people, companies, nonprofit organizations, and governments in the same way they work for you and me, with the one big, important exception I mentioned earlier. All countries can create money and credit out of the air to give to people to spend or lend out.\\n\\nDebt eats equity but central banks can feed debt by printing money instead.\\n\\nHowever, not all money that governments print is of equal value.\\n\\nThe monies that are widely accepted around the world are called reserve currencies.\\n\\nHaving a reserve currency is great while it lasts because it gives a country exceptional borrowing and the spending power and significant power over who else in the world gets the money and credit needed to buy and sell internationally. Having a reserve currency is one of the greatest powers a country can have because it gives the country enormous buying power and geopolitical power.\\n\\nWhen countries desperately need reserve currencies to service their serve currency-denominated debts and to buy things from sellers who only accept reserve currencies, they can go bankrupt.\\n\\n# What is Money?\\n\\nMoney is a medium of exchange that can also be used as a store hold of wealth.\\n\\nMost money and credit have no intrinsic value. They are just journaling entries in an accounting system that can easily be changed. The purpose of that system is to help allocate resources efficiently so that productivity can grow, rewarding both lenders and borrowers, but the system periodically breaks down.\\n\\n# Money, Credit, and Wealth\\n\\nWhile money and credit are associated with wealth, they are not the same thing as wealth. Because money and credit can buy wealth, the amount of money and credit you have and the amount of wealth you have look pretty much the same. But you cannot create more wealth simply by creating more money and credit. To create more wealth, you have to be more productive. The relationship between the creation of money and credit and the creation of wealth is often confused, yet it is the biggest driver of economic cycles. Let’s look at it more closely.\\n\\nThink of it this way: there is both a financial economy and a real economy. Though they are related, they are different. Each has its own supply-and-demand factors that drive it. By raising and lowering supplies of money and credit, central banks are able to raise and lower the demand and production of financial assets, goods, and services. We have to watch movements in the supplies and demands of both the real economy and the financial economy to understand what is likely to happen financially and economically.\\n\\nRelated to this confusion between the financial economy and the real economy is the relationship between the prices of things and the value of things. Because they tend to go together, they can be confused as being the same thing. They tend to go together because when people have more money and credit, they are more inclined to spend more and can spend more. To the extent that spending increases economic production and raises the prices of goods, services, and financial assets, it can be said to increase wealth because the people who already own those assets become “richer” when measured by the way we account for wealth. However, that increase in wealth is more an illusion than a reality for two reasons: 1) the increased credit that pushes prices and production up has to be paid back, which, all things being equal, will have the opposite effect when the bill comes due and 2) the intrinsic value of a thing doesn’t increase just because its prices go up.\\n\\nThink about it this way: if you own a house and the government creates a lot of money and credit, there might be many eager buyers who would push the price of your house up. But it’s still the same house; your actual wealth hasn’t increased, just your calculated wealth. Money and credit are stimulative when they’re given out and depressing when they have to be paid back. That’s what normally makes money, credit, and economic growth so cyclical.\\n\\nThe central bankers who control money and credit vary the costs and availability of money and credit to control markets and the economy.\\n\\nThink of the central bank as having a bottle of stimulants it can inject into the economy as needed. When the markets and the economy sag, it delivers shots of the money and credit stimulant to pick them up. When the markets and economy are too strong, it gives them less or no stimulant. These moves lead to cyclical rises and declines in the amounts and prices of money and credit, and of goods, services, and financial assets. These moves typically come in the form of short-term debt cycles and long-term debt cycles. The short-term debt cycles of ups and downs typically last about 8 years, give or take a few. I distinguish them from the long-term debt cycle, which typically plays out over 50 to 75 years. Because the crises that occur as these long-term debt cycles play out happen only once in a lifetime, most people don’t expect them. The long-term debt cycle that is now in the late-cycle phase was designed in 1944 in Bretton Woods and began in 1945 when World War II ended and the dollar-dominated world order began.\\n\\nWhen the central bank loses its ability to produce money and credit growth that passes through the economic system to produce real economic growth.\\n\\nThroughout history, central governments and central banks have created money and credit, which weakened their own currencies and raised their levels of monetary inflation to offset the deflation that comes from deflationary credit and economic contractions. This typically happens when debt levels are high, interest rates cant be adequately lowered, and the creation of money and credit increases financial asset prices more than it increases actual economic activity. At such times those who are holding the debt typically want to exchange the debt they are holding for other store holds of wealth. Once it is widely perceived that money and debt assets are no longer good store holds of wealth, the long-term debt cycle is at its end, and a restructuring of the monetary system has to occur.\\n\\n# The Long-term Debt Cycle\\n\\nThe long-term debt cycle tanspires in six stages:\\n\\n1. It begains with a) little or no debt and b) money being “hard”.\\n2. Then come claims on hard money (i.e., notes or paper money). \\n\\n   Soon people treat these paper “claims on money” as if they are money itself.\\n3. Then comes increased debt.\\n\\n   At first there are the same number of claims on the “hard money” as there is hard money in the bank. Then the holders of paper claims and the banks discover the wonders of credit and debt.\\n\\n   Trouble approaches when there isn’t enough income to service one’s debt, or when the amount of claims people are holding in the expectation that they can sell them to get money to buy goods and services increases faster than the amount of goods and services by an amount that makes the conversion from that debt asset impossible. These two problems tend to come together.\\n4. Then debt crises, defaults, and devaluations come, which leads to the printing of money and the breaking of the link to hard money.\\n\\n   Private banks must either default or get bailed out by the government when they get into trouble, while central banks can devalue their claims if their debts are denominated in their national currency. If the debt is denominated in a currency that they cant print, then they too must ultimately default.\\n5. Then comes fiat money, which eventually leads to the debasement of money.\",\"timestamp\":1639969824,\"title\":\"The Big Cycle of Money, Credit, Debt, and Economic Activity\"},\"digest\":\"-ZpXnwdTlJwvBnDHedJ3xR7I3AdMPfZeIlWsDX_Pz1I\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x1586775eEF0E4F992FBdc206fe78d33fBD2B8696\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MZtRjDiy5eabs1knoU4SE2vvJFCjjVzEYm2xOWB4ObU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qqi3-qPgFsPPi_U9AvK7xyMVMqAJQ_BhSB5PqafW4E8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"v-L3vodTs73jqTMBhKnwZGt61pf02P5tLW1GorpdOaR0S1mpmkj9oRZ9uyDmeM51ilgP6WdgZmkYcknoXQdz2w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xecb982d1d8aeb5c00c6ec86bc9d4d5a8455370672b81017c05d27b2360c173b814b4d4cbc4f7b496c07288289e44fc8477761a587beec3ef4a835762cefe52f71b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MZtRjDiy5eabs1knoU4SE2vvJFCjjVzEYm2xOWB4ObU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qqi3-qPgFsPPi_U9AvK7xyMVMqAJQ_BhSB5PqafW4E8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"fyXfcMWFdMoiPxd79Zp8aL5VcyFSeRmCD5am92HNz2A\"}"
