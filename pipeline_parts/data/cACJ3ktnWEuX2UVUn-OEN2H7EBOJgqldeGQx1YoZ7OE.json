"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"If you look at the chart of TERRA (LUNA), one of the biggest drivers of the initial run-up in price from $0.50 to $20.00 was the anticipation of the release of the Anchor Protocol. It ran up from around $0.50 in December 2020 when I got involved in LUNA to about $20 in March 2021. The Anchor Protocol did not fail to deliver and has been working well.\\n\\n## So what is Anchor Protocol?\\n\\nAccording to Anchor Protocol Whitepaper, Anchor Protocol is a savings protocol on Terra blockchain that offers yield powered by the rewards of major Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains. In a time of low yields throughout the world, the search for yield has been an ongoing question. In the Crypto space, this is even more intense. \\n\\nProtocols like Maker and Compound ushered in this search for yield. One of their limitations is the cyclical nature of their yields. Cyclical yields just mean that yields are volatile and not stable. Even though cyclical yields might be okay for folks in the Cryptocurrency space, cyclical yields will not work in the real world because regular folks and institutional investors are used to stable yields no matter how small the yields are.\\n\\n## What does Anchor Protocol offer above other yield platforms?\\n\\nAnchor Protocol offers a stable yield. Instead of cyclical or volatile yields, Anchor Protocol offers a low-volatility interest rate. A stable interest rate has broad appeal to your regular average Joe and also institutional investors. The reason that Cryptocurrency adoption is still low is because of the volatility. \\n\\nWhen it comes to interest rates, your average Joe and Institutional investors want interest rates that they can rely on month after month that do not fluctuate a lot. This has been the broad appeal of the Anchor Protocol since it’s inception. Let’s not forget that pension funds are always looking for stable yields that they can pay to retirees. I believe this will be one of the huge benefactors of the Anchor Protocol.\\n\\n## How does Anchor Protocol get this yield?\\n\\nOn Anchor Protocol, there are savers and borrowers. The savers are those that deposit Terra USD (UST) and get the Anchor savings rate on their UST. The borrowers are those that deposit assets and borrow UST. Anchor Protocol only allows people to deposit assets from Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks. PoS networks have a staking yield so Anchor Protocol can use this yield from these PoS network to pay depositors. \\n\\nFor these PoS tokens to be deposited as collateral, they have to be “bonded.” A bonded asset (bAsset) is a tokenized stake on a PoS blockchain. A bAsset allows the holder to earn block rewards while maintaining the liquidity and fungibility that staked assets forego. Now how the protocol does this is more technical and uses some algorithm that is pretty complex so is beyond the scope of this article. Let’s just say that Anchor Protocol is able to harvest the staking rewards of that PoS token and uses that to pay the savers.\",\"timestamp\":1639556348,\"title\":\"Anchor Protocol; bringing Stable Yield to the masses in a time of little to zero Yield!\"},\"digest\":\"opSYpC0xqX50MaRN_hkVd0bMBBgH3doa1sNUnjwpRGI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xed80dea559a056A693C33f2c17ec93Dee4d30C20\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qPemyrm4p1bzUzMakeutHduYbQKVesLb_6Tze8dIzt8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"C6e0Gwl-YZ-MiNnQRG0qM31qPLmHFNtXAwqEvHKxY8s\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ZL3nEX4ujww4fd5UrxrMMZgfO9ajguuPkUFhcceMT8Gh__K1xBmcqlaT-O09KbAHkDLWiFiBWN-svAVl08ZIDw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x7cac54489ae38b8cc32e8a4f97e5ceda894bad4f320026ed997a87510ce6af94374e9312ce5401cdd5e4fb7019f1cd67cc085d95764c64bfb939e058739771e41b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qPemyrm4p1bzUzMakeutHduYbQKVesLb_6Tze8dIzt8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"C6e0Gwl-YZ-MiNnQRG0qM31qPLmHFNtXAwqEvHKxY8s\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"opSYpC0xqX50MaRN_hkVd0bMBBgH3doa1sNUnjwpRGI\"}"
