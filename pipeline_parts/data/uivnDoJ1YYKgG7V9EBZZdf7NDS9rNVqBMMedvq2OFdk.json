"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I’m kind of mind blown at how this week has gone, honestly. First, the MTAVerse NFT project launched and @whizwang blessed me with the 161st street - Yankees Stadium stop to onboard me into the NFT space. I was blown away by that generosity. \\n\\nIf that project were to get big, that would probably be one of the more valuable ones. I asked how much she wanted to sell it for in the DM and she just…gave it to me!\\n\\nIt doesn’t sound like a big deal, but it was to me. We didn’t even follow each other before I asked, so she was just trusting that I wasn’t someone just trying to scheme a free NFT. \\n\\nI am a ginormous Yankees fan who has gone into that station several times for games. I truly don’t think there is a price I’d ever sell that for. I won’t get into details, but they have gone the way of the Olive Garden and Waffle House, so I am actually kind of excited to see how that unfolds lol\\n\\nTHEN Dastardly Ducks launched.\\n\\nThis is a project I found out about before it launched because I happened to follow one of the founders, @ExistentialEnso, and then I found her girlfriend @fumeiji through the Dastardly Ducks Twitter.\\n\\nI knew this would be my first NFT purchase because the funds were going to help two nice people save their little duck farm. They sold out 10,000 ducks in like 6 hours! At roughly $15 per duck, that’s about $150,000 total…in 6 hours…from like 700ish individuals.\\n\\nThat is such an INSANE level of fundraising power. To be able to raise $150,000 in 6 hours is so fucking cool. It might be the coolest thing I’ve participated in online to be quite honest. Why?\\n\\nBecause a community has rapidly formed around this project. Now NFTs make perfect sense to me. It really is the friends you make along the way.\\n\\nThe most disappointing thing about this project was how much hate the creators got from folks that they once considered friends. All because they see the rug pulls and think that’s all there is within the space.\\n\\nI hope this project is a catalyst in shifting what makes a collection popular. Let’s push this concept as far as we can and start tying our purchase of dope art to dope causes. If we start doing this en masse, we take away any argument the anti-NFT crew can make. The best troll is achieving fundraising numbers they could only dream of.\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1642645138,\"title\":\"DMCA Takedown and Saving a Duck Farm - My First Week in NFTs\"},\"digest\":\"4LrogdKPd-KQKSyr6VZsp8HwghMs0uoUhHn6D5KJ3HM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xe8cbCf4AB8aEf17742eF204c557b3050E8f992C3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uq0FBjOtreYUGIztdLpvMTRsB5oUnatdcXlaQg_TBoQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"917GdVWtZSlxTP1cLUNZgKY3Kg-srPUUp4IXMGIENy4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"FsFBbrPonAvgH-QsJfxfYAUTSwb4r1KXz_wPXHTfgEQoup5PHejGfUy5MhkPnFtjpi5-lbonEwsuiGlnBRsIfg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xdba1fd4d561bbe163362c04709da09a41ba651a4687599af0a79c858f7db70a667e37ce65203f47505316b760c86c9e4732f943a0fd6d9faa75739531992358a1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uq0FBjOtreYUGIztdLpvMTRsB5oUnatdcXlaQg_TBoQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"917GdVWtZSlxTP1cLUNZgKY3Kg-srPUUp4IXMGIENy4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"4LrogdKPd-KQKSyr6VZsp8HwghMs0uoUhHn6D5KJ3HM\"}"
