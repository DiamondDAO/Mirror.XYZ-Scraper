"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Governance is minimized to focus purely on two areas:\\n\\n1. What are the KPIs/metrics and OKRs of the DAO?\\n2. Which proposals should be funded?\\n\\nThe entire DAO will be organized as sub-DAOs and ideally [two-pizza teams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/introduction-devops-aws/two-pizza-teams.html):\\n\\n* All sub-DAOs will take care of their own internal governance, compensation, and allocation of responsibilities (central leadership is encouraged when practical)\\n* Anyone can join and contribute to any arbitrary number of sub-DAOs\\n* Sub-DAOs can have any arbitrary amount of members\\n* All sub-DAOs engaged to the overarching DAO via work proposals\\n* All work proposals outline:\\n  * The specific KPI that the sub-DAO will focus on driving success in\\n  * The actual work that the sub-DAO will undertake to drive toward the KPI\\n  * The compensation and resources requested by the sub-DAO\\n\\nEvery 3.5 months (April, August, December), the DAO engages in a two week intensive period of governance participation revolving around:\\n\\n* Assessing whether the DAO’s key outcomes and KPIs should change\\n* Assessing whether the DAO’s funding forwards proposals have created satisfactory progress towards the key objectives (identifying what works and what doesn’t)\\n* Identifying key organizational needs and bottlenecks to be addressed (these would need to pose a barrier to the DAO in achieving its key KPIs)\\n* Pivoting, iterating, improving, and creating new work proposals\\n\\nDuring these two weeks, everyone in the sub-DAOs is expected to participate in shared discussions. If a team’s work is found to be ineffective or needs improvement, they either can quickly iterate their plans or are given a notice period for which they may continue on for another 4 months but need to iterate on their work plan.\\n\\n**When focusing on accelerating the progress of the DAO, the goal is to grow horizontally via more sub-DAOs (vs. growing vertically through working groups)**\\n\\nThrough more sub-DAOs, the entire org can increase the number of teams trying new approaches to solving and innovating on existing problems and focuses while maintaining the same level of meta-organizational admin/overhead required to run. The competition is good.\\n\\nEncourage new community members to join existing sub-DAOs or start new ones.\\n\\nPrincipals of this Sub-DAO model:\\n\\n* If a work proposal has a decent chance of driving forward KPIs, fund it\\n* Loosely fund and operate as many ideas that may have a chance of working, allocate more resources to sub-DAOs that produce results, de-fund ones that don’t\\n* Encourage competition of ideas in driving KPIs (being open to two sub-DAOs in running similar work eg. two teams working on two different go to market plans)\\n* Once proposals are funded, let the proposers/sub-DAO figure out the rest\\n\\nBut what about protocol governance?\\n\\nA protocol may still need its parameters to be tweaked, smart contracts upgraded, etc. \\n\\nThis is generally imo this is generally a far more straightforward side of protocol governance and can run in parallel to the sub-DAO processes.\\n\\n===\\n\\nCredit goes to James Young for most of the core ideas outlined here.\",\"timestamp\":1641358927,\"title\":\"KPI Sub-DAO Structure\"},\"digest\":\"5nsl1Xnr-BwmNAPoNeMlghPiTFMhxNg4zE7suaR0sXc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x865c2F85C9fEa1C6Ac7F53de07554D68cB92eD88\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"6gDGJEFjPEqtMq9xHuRSVL-TDY91RC7aBg7EM5bSULw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"LtR_uV0LWyilAr6RmPIoT16RoOykpkM8T9M0YLF3rWU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"demqqbXwdOOkPDNn85mjl6nk1XeKgWqJOT_558m3FZnZe3ZJqdSkra2UEJPhdeoLVO8Ggl_bc4pHH6zkA89oOA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x669327858cadca509db022d30fe46789e446c8d648d1869ad44502111e2a5d627af916a34bffec806e78293d3fdea453461f491184118e0ee125b76b1c377df01c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"6gDGJEFjPEqtMq9xHuRSVL-TDY91RC7aBg7EM5bSULw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"LtR_uV0LWyilAr6RmPIoT16RoOykpkM8T9M0YLF3rWU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"5nsl1Xnr-BwmNAPoNeMlghPiTFMhxNg4zE7suaR0sXc\"}"
