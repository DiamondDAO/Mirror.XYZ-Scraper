"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"It was night, the stars were low and there was no wind.Momo's room was thick with a dark golden mist.These mists were mingled with a great deal of pure star power.And the mist formed a seemingly mighty whirlpool, and at every turn of the whirlpool the objects in the house made rustling noises of overwhelming weight.Apparently, the vortex, though only four or five meters wide, was incredibly thick.Above the house there were dark golden streaks that were invisible to the naked eye, falling in great quantities with the force of the invisible star, and then pouring into the dark golden whirlpool inside the room.The vortex pulls in so much star force that it condenses into a dark golden droplet at its center.Star power is originally invisible and without quality from the vast sky, it is hard to imagine such a pure drop of star power in such a place.Maybe even the two people who pulled it out didn't know what it meant.Two men sat opposite each other in the dark gold swirl. It was Tanner and Momo.Now they sat opposite each other, palms facing each other, with expressions of anguish.Drops of sweat poured from their bodies and were instantly shattered into nothingness by the intense star force.The whirlpool in the room was created by Tanner.But it is only sandalwood, but it is impossible to display the whirlpool to such a horrible [point.So](http://point.So) that the leading star force drops down and condenses into pure star force droplets below.The main reason for this phenomenon is actually Momo's uncontrollable talent, or that it.Well, it seems to be eating away at the very essence of Momo's life.Once, in order to save Momo, Tanner had worked so hard to cultivate the star power into Momo body, want to suppress it.Who had thought, Tanner injected into momo's body of the star power was swallowed by it in a flash, but it also seemed to eat, no longer swallow momo's life source.This gave Momo and Tanner [hope.It](http://hope.It) seems impossible to subdue it, so its only hope of survival is to feed it.But I do not know it is also in the growth of the cause or it is more and more greedy, in recent years, its appetite is more and more big, big to even the speed of tanner cultivation are some difficult to support the point.And it's devouring more and more powerful, almost as long as there's not enough star power injected, Momo is dead.If it had been all this, Momowan would not have survived.Because at this moment, only tanner's strength is not enough to meet his needs.But it also seems to have spirit wisdom, know who is its parents, every time \\\"eat\\\" will give tanner a lot of star power, accelerate tanner cultivation.And it seems to have a very strong power, can be tanner into the star force as a starting energy, to absorb more and more star power.And it seems to be a particularly picky eater.A lot of pure star power was given to Tanner.That alone doesn't seem to be a bad thing.But it shows a power that Neither Momo nor Tanner can resist.And it had grown so fast that by now it was giving back more star power than Tanner could [contain.It](http://contain.It) grows at its own pace [regardless.It](http://regardless.It) was like an accelerant in Momo's body, urging Momo and Tanner to keep running, keep running.And when they get tired, they eat them!Besides, I don't know what it has to do with [Momo.It](http://Momo.It) can even control Momo at times, causing him pain and doing incredible things.And this time, for the first time, he seemed to show any emotion other than his desire to eat. He was angry!This is not good [news.At](http://news.At) the center of the vortex, the pressure from the star force builds up until it's too much to bear.Tan er mouth mouth outflow dark golden by star force filled with blood, even hair, skin and so on have become dark golden, as if by pure and incomparable star force assimilation general.Yet this is not enough.The black solid emerged from the majestic and pure star force, like the pure essence separated from the dark golden star [force.As](http://force.As) soon as the black solid appears, the dark golden sandalwood tends to break.First, the blood flowing out of the body is shattered by the star force, and then the skin on the surface is broken more and more, and more and more blood is flowing out.And the star force inside Sandalwood body also lost control as general, want to take the flesh and blood of sandalwood to fly out, devote oneself to in this to pure star force together next!More and more black crystals appear in the star force vortex, as if absorbing all the light.All star forces are collapsing as if attracted.The whole star power vortex was churning violently.Finally, the paper cloth inside the house was torn to pieces, and then wooden tables and chairs, vases...Far away, the whole person seems to be in slow dissipation.Like a sand statue blown away by the wind.Tanner tried to open his eyes and pull his body out, but it was as if he was attracted by a force too strong to resist, as if he were trapped in a whirlpool and could not escape.I can only watch death inch by inch engulfing [me.No](http://me.No) amount of hard struggle is going to help.Tanner wanted to shout, to hold on to something.Yet everything is so powerless.Tanner's life was flowing into the black crystal, and the black crystal was flowing into Momo's body, consumed by it.Dong...The shattering in the room stopped, and the star force vortex disappeared in an instant.Only the black crystals of astral force hung motionless between Momo and Tanner.The flickering flame stood still, and the dripping water that kept time hung in midair.Not even the precious pendant clock moved.Behind Tanner, a pair of dark golden eyes opened and gazed coldly at the black crystals of starpower.Those eyes could be the size of a star and infinitely distant.But even so, or the oppression of time and space are still!Momo's mouth curled up.He raised his chin proudly and opened his eyes, a pair of black pupils that absorbed all the light.Momo looked fearlessly into those dark golden eyes and seemed to smile in some eerie way.Suddenly, the flame continued to beat again, the water drops fell slowly, and the pendulum clock resumed its rhythm.The dark golden eyes seemed to be pulled away by space, getting smaller and [smaller.At](http://smaller.At) last, just before vanishing, a terrifying beam of light broke out.Momo was still staring at the emptiness behind Tanner.Just different from the previous fearless, this time that a pair of black pupils seem to have some fear and caution.Out of the void suddenly appeared a room.There was a man sitting in the room.There was a neatly arranged desk in front of the man.The man had an undrawn sword at hand.The man seemed absorbed in writing something.Couldn't read the previous section, but when momo went to read it, she wrote the last word, \\\"Go!\\\"The void [collapsed.It](http://collapsed.It) seems startled and retreats inside Momo.Momo closed his eyes and fell slowly.Black and blue sandalwood also slowly fell.The black crystals of starpower eventually failed to fall and dissolved in a pool of blood.\",\"timestamp\":1642130634,\"title\":\"[Water Air]Drop15\"},\"digest\":\"bpfnRdWp7DfKSprSGXtAzKK6zB_RO0u7MNVBIhv_6t4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x34A470C697D3D29aA2f27e32A5153aC4384F9825\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"55u9ew7dzE4tkqePgnwhqY1uJZFyv1JAZUMhqzjBDm8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gaQvF-0MpI8TPHarcCDt2puMeyFrVwkvP4MkYt1JmOM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"vlO7NRRRQ-yPfL0eGSGyR176FTtHuz9EB2_xcRi83yXNxc4EDCC6zTm8jrBnV5Bjx1bqEIdZYT1s_La5gIsIFg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb12f46aef44c617901438c6acb5912239eb10896a70650ef06e8256f7502c87b2a75cfd536cc9c684b2feb8f80be2fffb07939adf1c3da29d15d7e05aac90b341b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"55u9ew7dzE4tkqePgnwhqY1uJZFyv1JAZUMhqzjBDm8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gaQvF-0MpI8TPHarcCDt2puMeyFrVwkvP4MkYt1JmOM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"bpfnRdWp7DfKSprSGXtAzKK6zB_RO0u7MNVBIhv_6t4\"}"
