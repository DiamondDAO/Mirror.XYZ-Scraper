"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Secure your username for the future of the web.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1\\\\*oinvymsK1Vssj0Bl9qnAHA.png)\\n\\nFor illustrative purposes only\\n\\nAs we begin to see more mainstream use cases of blockchain technology in payments, gaming, art, and even social media, it‚Äôs becoming really important to further simplify the user experience of crypto in general ‚Äî starting with addresses.\\n\\nAddresses are a huge part of how we interface with the blockchain because they‚Äôre essentially how transactions are received and sent out. However, they are in the form of a long combination of letters and numbers. For instance, an Ethereum address looks like this: ‚Äò0x6405A46E53680Eae9cC68228ec3a459c3CEDD972‚Äô.\\n\\nAs such, it‚Äôs really easy to make costly mistakes like sending money to the wrong address. This also affects the user experience of decentralized apps since oftentimes they have to identify you by this non-memorable string.\\n\\nThere are no other aspects of digital technology where *everyday people* are expected to use anything like this on a regular basis. Imagine if we didn‚Äôt have usernames on Twitter, and every time you wanted to tag your friend on a funny post, you had to go copy their Twitter user ID first. Or every time you wanted to visit a website, you had to find and type in the IP address. For the most part, we‚Äôve developed ways to map memorable names to complicated IDs like this. It generally makes for a better user experience, reduces the propensity for error and makes it easier to build communities around an identity.\\n\\nThis is why the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a really important project that I‚Äôm excited about. ENS is a service that enables you to map a human-readable name (ENS name) to your wallet address on the Ethereum blockchain. It makes the concept of identities on the blockchain a lot more accessible and user friendly, as other people (and dApps) can now identify you with a memorable name.\\n\\nYou can pay for an ENS name on the [ENS App](https://app.ens.domains/) or buy it on the secondary market if someone else has claimed a name that you want. ENS names are essentially Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), so you can trade them on marketplaces like OpenSea. This is similar to having to bid for your preferred domain name on GoDaddy.\\n\\nWhen you get an ENS name, you can:\\n\\n* Receive any cryptocurrency, token, or blockchain-based item (like NFTs) with it. E.g. You can share ‚Äòteju.eth‚Äô instead of a long address to receive crypto.\\n* Point your ENS name to your website. With browsers that offer native support for ENS such as [Brave](http://www.brave.com/) and [Opera](http://www.opera.com/), you can simply type your ENS name to visit the site directly. For non-web3 browsers like Chrome, you can add a ‚Äú.link‚Äù suffix to open the website. E.g ‚Äòteju.eth.link‚Äô.\\n* Set your reverse record and have decentralized apps display your ENS name in place of your wallet address.\\n* Add profile information like an avatar, email address, or Twitter handle. These will also be visible on the blockchain.\\n\\nNow that you have that information, here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to registering your ENS name and setting the reverse record for it.\\n\\n## **You‚Äôll need:**\\n\\n* A [non-custodial Ethereum Wallet.](https://tejuadeyinka.medium.com/exploring-crypto-wallets-your-portal-into-the-future-d1e15ee77492?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------) In the example below, I use [Rainbow](http://rainbow.me/)‚Äôs mobile wallet.\\n* Ether: You‚Äôll need this to pay for the registration and cover the transaction fees. The renewal fee is currently set at $5/year for names that are 5 characters or longer, $160/year for names 4 characters in length, and $640/year for names 3 characters in length. Remember to check what the gas fees currently are before starting the process.\\n* You‚Äôll need to have the Ether in your non-custodial wallet. So, if you have it on an exchange, send it to a wallet that you own first. Here are guides to sending cryptocurrency from [Buycoins](https://help.buycoins.africa/article/5shnmmtevz-example) and [Coinbase](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/cryptocurrency-trading-pairs/how-to-send-and-receive-cryptocurrency).\\n\\n## **Step 1**\\n\\nGo to [app.ens.domains ‚Üí](http://app.ens.domains/)\\n\\n![Visit app.ens.domains and connect your wallet.](https://miro.medium.com/max/5760/1\\\\*Z2lS0nUk8Gx6VghCZdwUWw.png)\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/5760/1\\\\*c9zylVkIRzWepnmETRWRbg.png)\\n\\nClick on the ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù button on the top left and select your preferred wallet. If yours isn‚Äôt listed, click on WalletConnect to check if it is supported.\\n\\nWhen you select WalletConnect, you‚Äôll get a QR code to scan. If you‚Äôre using Rainbow, navigate to the ‚Äò*Discover*‚Äô page and click the QR icon to scan the code. Once it scans successfully, you‚Äôll get a prompt to connect the ENS App to your wallet.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/4688/1\\\\*C3u5PTAcNrsPdqFUesOMdQ.png)\\n\\n![Connect the ENS app to your wallet](https://miro.medium.com/max/2250/1\\\\*fjZO4vkbDIcGJ20iu3OjWw.png)\\n\\n## Step 2\\n\\nYou‚Äôre in!\\n\\nType in the name you‚Äôre trying to buy to see if it‚Äôs still available. You may select a period (in years) to register it for.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*QG-nyk3-8QH9fCHKC6KcWA.png)\\n\\nSearch to see if your name is available\\n\\nOnce you do this, you‚Äôll see an estimate of what it costs including the current gas fee.\\n\\nIn this case, I got a total dollar estimate of $30.97 to pay for a name above 5 characters for three years, but I ended up paying about $25 in total.\\n\\n![See how much you‚Äôll have to pay.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*GqhVmm67faMd3cRyl4O3ww.png)\\n\\n## **Step 3**\\n\\nYou‚Äôll be required to sign two transactions ‚Äî one to request to register, and the other to actually register.\\n\\nClick on the ‚Äúrequest to register‚Äù button, you‚Äôll get a push notification from Rainbow (or your wallet) to confirm this transaction.\\n\\nHere, you‚Äôll notice a small network fee. In my case, it was $1.39. You can adjust the amount to pay depending on how quickly you want the transaction to get fulfilled, the wallet app will usually suggest an estimate that you can go with. Rainbow and most other wallets allow you to select amounts for a ‚Äúslowüêå, normal‚è± or fastüöÄ‚Äù transaction. The more money you‚Äôre willing to spend, the faster your transaction will be.\\n\\nOnce you approve the transaction, it will be submitted on the blockchain, and you‚Äôll wait for it to be confirmed.\\n\\nOn Rainbow, even after you have submitted the transaction, you can click on it to speed it up (by paying more gas), cancel the transaction or view it on [Etherscan](http://www.etherscan.io/) (a tool that lets you see your transactions on the blockchain).\\n\\n## Step 4\\n\\nOnce your transaction has been confirmed on the blockchain, you‚Äôll be required to wait for one minute to ensure that someone else hasn‚Äôt tried to register that name within the same period. If this checks out, you‚Äôll be able to initiate the second transaction by clicking ‚ÄúRegister‚Äù.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/5760/1\\\\*OMIHOSB-GKGueKQIhcpT2A.png)\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/5670/1\\\\*GsjdxIfNmwBCF79qTwnonA.png)\\n\\nYou‚Äôll get another notification from your wallet to sign the transaction. This time, you‚Äôll see the cost of the ENS name ($16.51 for three years in this case), as well as the network fee.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1182/1\\\\*bOjm-zUu93sZsLm7oW0JXA.jpeg)\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1182/1\\\\*G68S5jupZ8O0v4r0aZeiBg.jpeg)\\n\\n![Pay to complete your registration](https://miro.medium.com/max/1182/1\\\\*yzYfrPlNjIANSHPN-_TQfg.jpeg)\\n\\nOnce this transaction is confirmed, you now own the ENS name and will be able to see it as a collectible in your wallet.\\n\\n## Step 5\\n\\nOne last thing ‚Äî set the reverse record. This is what will allow decentralized apps to recognize and display your address as your ENS name.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*MnGiCwW3tAqsB6-5rwwSKg.png)\\n\\nAfter setting the reverse record, dApps like Showtime will display your ENS name instead of your address\\n\\nTo do this, click ‚ÄúMy Account‚Äù on the bar to the left, and select the ENS name that you want to set your address to. In your case, it‚Äôs probably the one you just bought.\\n\\n![Set the reverse record](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*b1as5uB5eHePyiSgr9WqrA.png)\\n\\nYou‚Äôll have to sign another transaction from your wallet to complete this process. Once it‚Äôs done, decentralized apps will be able to display your ENS name when you sign in with the address that it‚Äôs set to.\\n\\nYou can also update your record and set other cryptocurrency addresses to link to your ENS name. You can also set text records such as your Twitter profile or public website etc.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/5736/1\\\\*QeyIY0q6VGlRx_gPQiWpWA.png)\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/4324/1\\\\*re4LKKczRPlQ2LjXyaAT1g.png)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633903534,\"title\":\"How to register an ENS name for your wallet address\",\"publication\":\"teju\"},\"digest\":\"RX7N6sefjjvKu-ETe5OjXML3GybrlJidYiaD9ASeQbs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6405A46E53680Eae9cC68228ec3a459c3CEDD972\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"EJTO3ETX-5VAa0Q9CIeI4wxUNunubkoYk9ITi9g00Nk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ny3p4bwjUqWK64_kYmtRNMxojeXC2kt0_WhLbBFwVjk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"A_QnrD2wFCh-6VXTPoqx1qPl_tCyCrj8d88frzNrxjolkeLy7odYvpT7zxXASoLzfg3Un8du91XUgXjbeK1l-Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x56acf91f3233a30aea58b06f4f7bbe7e74f9d618f71bcf56643a96cb771e241620aeb90d9c5eb17e8107690f73f14a06f0ebea5c2dba8969959299b28b6378c21b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"EJTO3ETX-5VAa0Q9CIeI4wxUNunubkoYk9ITi9g00Nk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ny3p4bwjUqWK64_kYmtRNMxojeXC2kt0_WhLbBFwVjk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"RX7N6sefjjvKu-ETe5OjXML3GybrlJidYiaD9ASeQbs\"}"
