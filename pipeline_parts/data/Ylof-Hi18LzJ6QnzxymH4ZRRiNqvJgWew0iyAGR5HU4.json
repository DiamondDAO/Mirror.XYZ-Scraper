"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Apple’s newest batch of [14 and 16-inch MacBook Pros](https://gizmodo.com/the-new-macbook-pro-is-a-ridiculous-beast-powered-by-ne-1847884294?rev=1634581160844) have finally started shipping to customers with pre-orders and are expected to reach their new owners as soon as Tuesday. However, if you didn’t have a pre-order and are looking to place an order soon, be prepared to wait to receive your hardware.\\n\\nOn Saturday, the Apple Store’s expected delivery dates for new orders of the company’s MacBook Pros, spotted by [9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/23/macbook-pro-orders-now-shipping/), ranged from Nov. 16 to Dec. 23 for standard and custom models. The news isn’t exactly a surprise as it had been [reported](https://gizmodo.com/the-chip-shortage-has-finally-hit-apple-1847911264) by [other outlets](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-21/apple-s-device-shortages-threaten-record-setting-holiday-season?sref=P6Q0mxvj) earlier this week, but we now have more specific dates to reference.\\n\\nAs we’ve noted before, delays for Apple products aren’t out of the ordinary, the difference in this situation is the scale. Here are the expected delivery dates on MacBook Pros from the Apple Store that we have so far:\\n\\n#### Related Stories\\n\\n[A USB-C Hub With an SSD Slot Solves Your Laptop's Lack of Storage and Ports](https://gizmodo.com/a-usb-c-hub-with-an-ssd-slot-solves-your-laptops-lack-o-1847915426)\\n\\n[The Next MacBook Air Might Be the First With the M2 Chip](https://gizmodo.com/the-next-macbook-air-might-be-the-first-with-the-m2-chi-1847915947)\\n\\n[How to Watch and What to Expect From Apple's October Event (Macs!)](https://gizmodo.com/what-to-expect-from-apples-october-event-macs-1847853365)\\n\\n* **Standard 14-inch MacBook Pro**: Nov. 16 to Nov. 23 \\n \\n* **Customized 14-inch MacBook Pro with high-spec options**: As late as Dec. 16 (applies to some models) \\n \\n* **Standard 16-inch MacBook Pro**: Nov. 23 to Dec. 1 \\n \\n* **Customized 16-inch MacBook Pro with high-spec options**: As late as Dec. 23 (applies to some models) \\n \\n\\nTop Articles[READ MORE‘Some Issues’ Force Tesla to Pull Newest FullSelf‑Driving Beta](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-says-some-issues-have-forced-tesla-to-pull-1847927184?traffic_source=Connatix)\\n\\nNonetheless, considering the [demand](https://mashable.com/article/apple-polishing-cloth-sold-out) for Apple products in general—people have backordered the company’s $19 polishing cloth—as well as the [global supply chain crisis](https://gizmodo.com/more-than-100-cargo-ships-were-waiting-to-unload-in-sou-1847924794) and [chip shortage](https://gizmodo.com/the-chip-shortage-has-finally-hit-apple-1847911264), it’s likely these dates will change as people start ramping up their buying for the holiday season.\\n\\nThe MacBook Pro isn’t the only Apple product experiencing delays. None of the company’s recently announced products are readily available and even some [older products](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-21/apple-s-device-shortages-threaten-record-setting-holiday-season?sref=P6Q0mxvj), such as the iPhone 11, iPhone 12, 2021 iMac, and Mac Pro, among others, are seeing longer delivery windows. In addition, Apple is expected to [slash production targets](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/apple-poised-to-slash-iphone-production-goals-due-to-chip-crunch?sref=P6Q0mxvj) for its shiny new iPhone 13 by as much as 10 million because of the chip shortage.\\n\\nWhen you step back and consider all the other more pressing problems we have in the world, such as a [global pandemic](https://gizmodo.com/moscow-to-enter-lockdown-next-week-as-covid-19-cases-sk-1847914717) and a [planet in crisis](https://gizmodo.com/the-era-of-climate-sickness-has-arrived-1847903223), delivery delays of Apple’s newest products are a relatively small thing. Sure, it’ll take longer for you to get the hardware you’re really excited about, but you’ll get it eventually.
