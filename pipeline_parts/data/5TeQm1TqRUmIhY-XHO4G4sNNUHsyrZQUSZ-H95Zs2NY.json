It’s curated and published by Global Designer Network DAO member Mo'Casso. Weave your way through the threads below to get all caught up on the culture*.\\n\\n## #RAWorkshops on Wednesdays is officially live!\\n\\nWhen I first started creating the RAW realm I asked a few people for ideas on what they thought I could incorporate to help grow our community.  Alma Andrea gave me the great idea once to host Q & A sessions with people that are making waves within the physical 2 digital space in our discord.\\n\\nAs our discord continued to grow, more and more people began introducing theirs elves and sharing their gifts. It became super evident at this point, that was going to work out perfectly! I pitched the idea to the group and everyone loved it. I even had the idea to turn the party up a notch and take it to twitter spaces! So we set a date and time that would work for most and decided to start by spotlighting member Krave Artistry and talk about filliping NFTs.\\n\\nDuring the Workshop Krave covered vital information for people that are new in the web3 space and interested in investing in NFTs.\\n\\n### He talked about:\\n\\n* getting into projects early (major key!)\\n* vetting projects\\n* protecting yourself when entering new projects and spaces\\n* red flags in NFT projects\\n* DYOR! DYOR! DYOR!\\n* ***and much more!***\\n\\n**The recording is only available for a month on twitter, so catch the replay and be on the look out for our next workshop next Wednesday @ 2pm PST**\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/raw_apparel_/status/1481399090688577536?s=20](https://twitter.com/raw_apparel_/status/1481399090688577536?s=20)\\n\\n### We also have an awesome POAP that was sent to everyone who made it to our first workshop!
