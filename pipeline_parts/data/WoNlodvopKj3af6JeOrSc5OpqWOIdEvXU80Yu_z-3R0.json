"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"# In every class, there will be some bad students, they are very active and annoy other students. The bad students don’t want to study, they will interfere other students to listen to the class, which also bothers the teachers. Bad students are not welcomed everywhere, so students will stay away from them, some teachers even give up on them. But some day, when I went home after school, I found a bad student who was in my class carry a cat, he handed the cat to a woman, the woman said thank you to him for help her find the cat. I was surprised, I saw the good side of a bad student. I think I need to be nice to the bad students, they are not that bad, maybe they just want to attract other people’s attention. If we give them more chances, they will be good students. \",\"timestamp\":1639102474,\"title\":\"Be Kind to the Bad Students\"},\"digest\":\"A5B3eWf9XFrd7kqwXHufwkeYu1OiFIW1cNIvg3ACBqU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3E0A6E8c22091652e5beA6fEa0cCad697D9C3C00\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"9mYpY-oUcmucPpifa-BVDWerz0s7MUPHv4ct1hGpU6w\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QhE16LhL-g5aWlsbxQHlxZQRHwxUzyNjfrONViHfN6I\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"q8LroLl7vPr9Rw_ypVG4QtW-Mt6aJcfp-RigQGdq14wzewltxMj3knYZ2vCGVzf3VBU6NNQLKSVm5xDB_wi39A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb7d5d26e4e51ea4b81bb319b1221bc228f4dea214a215eaccd366406884b07245d1f7696eff6441fdb2433d7a9738c730d236586e566817e637b1233a42b3fe71c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"9mYpY-oUcmucPpifa-BVDWerz0s7MUPHv4ct1hGpU6w\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QhE16LhL-g5aWlsbxQHlxZQRHwxUzyNjfrONViHfN6I\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"A5B3eWf9XFrd7kqwXHufwkeYu1OiFIW1cNIvg3ACBqU\"}"
