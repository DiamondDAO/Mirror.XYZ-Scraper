"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The first NFT I purchased was patrickworkman.eth. It was an obvious choice. Domain names are familiar. I'm Patrick Workman. Peanut Butter & Jelly.\\n\\n![Maneki Gang #11892](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ovPNJ0xthezTlVOXAfgvO.png?height=600&width=600)\\n\\nMy second NFT was from from the [Maneki Gang Collection](https://opensea.io/collection/manekigang). [I chose Maneki Gang #11892](https://opensea.io/assets/0x08da8a11c9b3a35d715b5da5b3e4661929490f53/11892) because it had a tie dyed shirt (I like tie dye!), a newspaper hat (I like newspapers!), an active Discord server and cost $200. After I purchased my Maneki, I used it as my pfp everywhere, including work.\\n\\nA co-worker noticed my Maneki pfp and reached out to talk about NFTs. He's been working on a project that prints and delivers t-shirts using the images from NFTs in a wallet. After our call, he asked me for my NFT thesis. I didn't have one, so I drafted this:\\n\\n* NFTs are in the early innings, maybe not even in the game yet.\\n* Most of the projects are aspirational w/o substance.\\n  * People copy/pasta BAYC and hope to profit.\\n* 99.9% of projects attempting to build communities through images will die.\\n  * Community building is hard.\\n* This wave of NFT projects will come crashing down with the next crypto dip. Demand is being  pumped by people w/ big bags of crypto and no where to spend it.\\n* Gaming will create the first consumer crypto projects that scale.\\n  * Owning land in the metaverse will produce gains. TBD what platform breaks out before FB gobbles up all the attention.\\n    * Tough to compete against a $10B bag…\\n* I don’t understand the draw of owning digital art. I also don’t understand the draw of physical art ownership.\\n  * There’s a status in ownership element component, but it isn’t in my universe.\\n  * I understand collecting and owning Phish posters, which I buy and keep in a binder under my bed. I have limited interest in collecting or owning an NFT of a Phish poster.\\n* People are pushing the easy button and attempting to force physical > digital.\\n  * Smells like web1 when magazines became websites.\\n* Purpose based projects (buy the Constitution) will organize people around a common goals/interests. I'm going to create [Daft Punk DAO](https://twitter.com/daftpunkdao) to get the group to perform…one more time.\\n  * **LIFE GOAL**: Book Phish for a private show with tickets allocated to people with the highest levels of participation in our DAO (what ‘participation means is TBD).\\n\\nWhat I learned yesterday:\\n\\n* $TIME is on my side: I heard about OlympusDAO's Wonderland project, [did a minor amount of research](https://www.blocmates.com/blogmates/a-complete-guide-to-wonderland-money-time-mim-and-memo) and aped in. Getting tokens to Avalanche was an adventure. Through [ElkDex](https://app.elk.finance/#/elknet), I  bought $ELK (Polygon) and bridged $ELK / Polygon > Avalanche. Once the $ELK arrived on Avalanche, I swapped $ELK for $TIME through TraderJoe and staked it through Wonderland.
