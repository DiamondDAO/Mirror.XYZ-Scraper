"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"Who is to be invited?\\\" asked the raven.\\n\\n```\\n\\\"All the world may come to the great ball, even human beings, if\\n```\\n\\nthey can only talk in their sleep, or do something after our\\n\\nfashion. But for the feast the company must be carefully selected;\\n\\nwe can only admit persons of high rank; I have had a dispute myself\\n\\nwith the elf king, as he thought we could not admit ghosts. The merman\\n\\nand his daughter must be invited first, although it may not be\\n\\nagreeable to them to remain so long on dry land, but they shall have a\\n\\nwet stone to sit on, or perhaps something better; so I think they will\\n\\nnot refuse this time. We must have all the old demons of the first\\n\\nclass, with tails, and the hobgoblins and imps; and then I think we\\n\\nought not to leave out the death-horse, or the grave-pig, or even\\n\\nthe church dwarf, although they do belong to the clergy, and are not\\n\\nreckoned among our people; but that is merely their office, they are\\n\\nnearly related to us, and visit us very frequently.\\\"\\n\\n```\\n\\\"Croak,\\\" said the night-raven as he flew away with the\\n```\\n\\ninvitations.\\n\\n```\\nThe elfin maidens we're already dancing on the elf hill, and\\n```\\n\\nthey danced in shawls woven from moonshine and mist, which look very\\n\\npretty to those who like such things. The large hall within the elf\\n\\nhill was splendidly decorated; the floor had been washed with\\n\\nmoonshine, and the walls had been rubbed with magic ointment, so\\n\\nthat they glowed like tulip-leaves in the light. In the kitchen were\\n\\nfrogs roasting on the spit, and dishes preparing of snail skins,\\n\\nwith children's fingers in them, salad of mushroom seed, hemlock,\\n\\nnoses and marrow of mice, beer from the marsh woman's brewery, and\\n\\nsparkling salt-petre wine from the grave cellars. These were all\\n\\nsubstantial food. Rusty nails and church-window glass formed the\\n\\ndessert. The old elf king had his gold crown polished up with powdered\\n\\nslate-pencil; it was like that used by the first form, and very\\n\\ndifficult for an elf king to obtain. In the bedrooms, curtains were\\n\\nhung up and fastened with the slime of snails; there was, indeed, a\\n\\nbuzzing and humming everywhere.\",\"timestamp\":1636531666,\"title\":\"Who is to be invited\"},\"digest\":\"tKgqmUNZz07-rNI4p5wDdNUsUpVETRX6hXc2qtvvhc4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD6FFaeE2D21c98999e3c40052687ea652b1411a9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1ZNGbA8hw50NqTEH60pjWtttAxTmj-O0q7ZAWIpIk0I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Epibr8SDl9ci73c4unNeA-8NllUfAXuSKPWIm6Niu6Y\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"pw21khhdsELQ3rsRSLAhJPbppVtnTtbtHQxOclIVJBcNrt1ZkHY_bRI48aN0ewJPmUArWFXtGht7c5ExwvU8cQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb13d364ecd5e04aa25ca6557de5d189f61a2cbb86427e42295a20a7b062a8d42191f967d5c21fc550f4cef070e74615201c656b41dc700c6e43dad71f764389b1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1ZNGbA8hw50NqTEH60pjWtttAxTmj-O0q7ZAWIpIk0I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Epibr8SDl9ci73c4unNeA-8NllUfAXuSKPWIm6Niu6Y\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"tKgqmUNZz07-rNI4p5wDdNUsUpVETRX6hXc2qtvvhc4\"}"
