Catherine and Mrs. Abigail's apartment complex outdoor garden***\\n\\nRosa is returning from the closest pharmacy located on the other side of Catherine's apartment block, and she is walking back to Mrs. Abigail's residence. Rosa is a certified nurse and a US Green Cardholder. She is a single Mexican woman in her mid 30th. Every spring, she goes to the US and works for six months as a nurse on a contract basis for one of the largest nursing homes in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\\n\\nRosa lost all of her family after similar-like flu symptoms, which became a pandemic in early 2020, and later on, the virus was named Corona or COVID-19. When COVID-19 hit Mexico, she lost her husband, her brother, her father, and her only eighth years old daughter. She used to be an ordinary housewife, but after she lost all of her family because of the COVID-19 pandemic, she decided that other people should not suffer the way she did.\\n\\nSo instead of starting a new family, she decided to become a nurse. At first, she wanted to take care of children, but as she tried it once, the pain inside her felt greater, and she often cried every time she returned home from work because she missed her daughter deeply. Then her colleague told her to try working in the US as a part-time nurse for a nursing home in Albuquerque, New Mexico, three years ago.\\n\\nRosa is trying to rebuild her new life and hopes one day she can be a US citizen. After she lost her beloved family, she could not bear to live in Mexico any longer.\\n\\nThis year is Rosa's third year going to the US and worked there, and as the summer will soon come to an end, she is close to going back to Mexico again this year as she wants to spends Christmas in her hometown with the rest of her relatives she has left.\\n\\nToday, Rosa is a certified house nurse and responsible for taking good care of Mrs. Abigail's health and well-being. She also understands how Mrs. Abigail must have felt from losing her beloved husband because of the same pandemic that had taken away all of her family. And it is the same way of looking at why Mrs. Abigail has considered Rosa, not only as her nurse but for the past years, Rosa is the only family she ever has left who truly cares for her. Deep down, Mrs. Abigail knows perfectly what Rosa has been going through.\\n\\nAs Rosa arrived in front of the apartment building, she saw Mrs. Abigail is standing by holding her walker outside the apartment. Mrs. Abigail is slowly walking towards the garden instead of going to her apartment. These past few months, Mrs. Abigail somehow becomes more emotional, anxious, easily offended, and a bit hard to handle. But Rosa understands how difficult Mrs. Abigail's life might be as she gets weaker and older by the day.\\n\\nRosa approaches her slowly because she does not want to surprise Mrs. Abigail from behind right after she finished talking using her mobile phone to her office. And then, she pretends to speak but this time, with a louder voice, because she knows Mrs. Abigail has a hearing problem. Rosa says, \\\"EVERYTHING IS FINE. MRS. ABIGAIL IS HERE WITH ME IN THE GARDEN.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Abigail can hear Rosa's voice coming from behind her, and she slowly turns and look towards Rosa with a smile. She knew she had somehow 'escape' from her apartment without Rosa's permission and now she felt caught by the police. She asks Rosa to stand beside her, she says,\\n\\nMrs. Abigail: \\\"Rosa, dear, come here and look. You have been here for how many years now? ...But have you seen that oak tree over there? I have been living here for years, and I swear I never saw an oak tree by that corner before...\\\"\\n\\nRosa: “I caught you red-handed Mrs. Abigail. You can tell me anytime if you want to go to the garden. I will accompany you, but I must be well prepared with my medicine bag.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Abigail: \\\"I am so sorry, dear, but I was throwing some garbage away, and Beatrice is not herself today, she keeps meowing all day, and she insisted I open the front door. Anyway, Rosa, dear, do you remember there is an oak tree by that corner?\\\"\\n\\nRosa: “It's okay, Mrs. Abigail, but next time, dial number one on your mobile phone first and wait for me, so we can go together to anywhere you like to go. Which tree, Mrs. Abigail?”\\n\\nAs Rosa tries to forgive Mrs. Abigail's excuses, she looks at the tree where Mrs. Abigail points using her left hand because she uses her right hand to grips the walker tightly so she can stay balanced. It took several seconds for Rosa to stare at the tree from about 20 meters away with Mrs. Abigail, and then Rosa says, \\\"hmm... I don't know Mrs. Abigail. Maybe, because I have not taken notice of the surrounding trees around here, but I don't know what tree is that. It looks like an oak tree but trusts me, Mrs. Abigail, it is not.”\\n\\nMrs. Abigail: \\\"That is an oak tree, Rosa. Right there, the medium-sized one in the middle.\\\"\\n\\nRosa: \\\"I came from Mexico, Mrs. Abigail. We have almost all kinds of oak trees compared to the rest of the world, even the rarest, but that one, it just looks like an oak, but I have not seen an oak tree like that in my entire life.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Abigail was puzzled by Rosa's explanation, but she also knew that Rosa's eyes were better than hers, so she turned silent.\\n\\nRosa then says to Mrs. Abigail after she stares at the oak tree for quite some time now, and she suddenly feels uncomfortable by looking at it as she gets goosebumps throughout her body. She says,\\n\\nRosa: \\\"*No nos dejes caer en la tentación y líbranos del mal, amén*...Let's go, Mrs. Abigail. I will call the building maintenance tomorrow morning. Something is not right with that tree. I get goosebumps.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Abigail also feels something is wrong with the tree, but she tries to stay calm and act normal, although she feels scared after hearing what Rosa just said. Mrs. Abigail smiles and says,\\n\\nMrs. Abigail: \\\"It's only a tree, Rosa, dear. Come, let's go home and drink some tea. Now you are making me uncomfortable.\\\"\\n\\nRosa: \\\"Perhaps, Mrs. Abigail. But in our culture, every tree is also a house for demons and spirits. Some are good, but some are bad. Anyway, it is getting late, let's go home, and we can drink tea together.\\\"\\n\\n## CHAPTER THIRTY TWO\\n\\n### Beatrice and Tom are missing\\n\\n![(Illustration 37)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GzcIDfpIrPRYjRjuIbCrz.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\\n\\n***December 2029, Mrs. Abigail and Catherine apartment complex***\\n\\nMrs. Abigail: \\\"You are too superstitious, Rosa.\\\"\\n\\nRosa: \\\"Call me anything you like, Mrs. Abigail, but this Rosa has seen so many weird things back in Mexico. You know what, Mrs. Abigail? Perhaps one day you and I should go to Mexico together for a holiday, and you can see the Mexican wonders. What do you say?\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Abigail: \\\"You are too kind, Rosa, dear. A holiday to Mexico, just the two of us? Really? Of course, why not? I do need a vacation right now. I am so bored sitting at home, Rosa. I know I am an old lady, but I promise I will not be too much trouble as long as we go to the beach once in a while....\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Abigail was so excited by Rosa's offer, and Rosa needs to go to Mexico with a friend right now, so she could avoid thinking too often about her past every time she returns to Mexico. For Rosa, Mrs. Abigail is becoming like the mother she once had. Rosa's mother died when she was seven years old, and she has been living with her father ever since. Her father was devastated when her mother passed away and never started a new family until he passed away.\\n\\nRosa walks beside Mrs. Abigail slowly, as Mrs. Abigail uses her walker to return to the house after their short visit to the garden to look at a strange-looking oak tree.\\n\\nAs they reach the apartment's main hallway, Mrs. Abigail's apartment is located on the left side by the ground floor, and the door was not closed properly. Rosa was surprised and asked Mrs. Abigail.\\n\\nRosa: \\\"Did you leave the door open?\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Abigail: \\\"Perhaps, I forgot, Rosa. O, yes, I think I did open it because today Beatrice was not behaving as she used to. She keeps meowing by the door after you leave. I don't know what has gotten to her. Where is she anyway?\\\"\\n\\nRosa: \\\"Thank God is you, but you should not do that. I know this place is secure and has CCTV everywhere, but you must shut your apartment door properly, Mrs. Abigail, because I need to make a report to the nursing homes, but since you remember, I guess it is alright then. Let's go inside, first. Maybe Beatrice is inside. It is her snack time.\\\"\\n\\nAs soon as Rosa enters Mrs. Abigail's apartment, she looks around to see if everything is still in its proper place. Once she sees everything is secure, she closes the door and helps Mrs. Abigail sits on her favorite chair.\\n\\nMrs. Abigail: \\\"Beatrice! Beatrice, dear! I am home.\\\"\\n\\nRosa: \\\"She is not here, Mrs. Abigail, and so is Tom, but Nancy is still sleeping. I hope her mama returns soon for breastfeeding.\\\"\\n\\nRosa quickly opens the lock of the small cat door on the main apartment door. She turns on the CCTV and the motion sensor to monitor if there is someone, or most of the time is just Beatrice in front of the door waiting to get inside the apartment.\\n\\nBecause of her oversize body, Beatrice sometimes is just too lazy to slip in the cat door. She usually chooses to sit or meowing until someone opens the door for her.\\n\\nBeatrice had given labor two months ago and has two kittens, Tom and Nancy. Today, Beatrice and Tom are not at Mrs. Abigail's apartment, and that is something Beatrice has never done before.\\n\\n## CHAPTER THIRTY THREE\\n\\n### Beatrice returns home without Tom\\n\\n![(Illustration 38)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QtavMEsO-IRFp25gsAMVQ.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\\n\\n***December 2024, Albuquerque, Mrs. Abigail's residence***\\n\\nIn New Mexico, nighttime begins early in December. Mrs. Abigail sits on her favorite chair while Rosa goes to the kitchen to make an afternoon tea and prepare some cookies for Mrs. Abigail before taking her medicine.\\n\\nAt her age, Mrs. Abigail has a box of medicine for her to consume every day.\\n\\nRosa wants to make sure Mrs. Abigail's medicine is always available at home, and it is why she went to the pharmacy earlier today to refill the stock.\\n\\nBefore returning to Mexico later this month, Rosa needs to prepare everything for Mrs. Abigail. Once she is on holiday, Mrs. Abigail will have a temporary nurse but not daily. The temporary nurse will only make three hours short visits five times each week. It will be difficult months for Mrs. Abigail.\\n\\nEvery time Rosa's nursing service almost comes to an end, Mrs. Abigail is a little bit stress out because she knows that she will have to do most of everything in her house on her own. Rosa will inform the nearby neighbor will, and she requests them to be helpful in case there is an emergency.\\n\\nWhile in the kitchen, Rosa seems busy opening and closing the kitchen cabinet because she can not find what she is looking for. She could not believe she missed buying several packs of tea on her last visit to the grocery store.\\n\\nRosa: \\\"Mrs. Abigail, your tea is finished, and I forgot to buy it when we went to the supermarket together last week.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Abigail: \\\"What should we do then..?\\\"\\n\\nRosa: \\\"Wait... Wait ... This Rosa is like a walking kitchen. I remember I have several in my purse. My tea and yours are the same anyway. While we drink tea, we will try to solve this. I need to drink tea right now.\\\"\\n\\nRosa returns to the living room smiling over what she said about trying to solve the tea problem. Seeing Rosa always prepared for everything and her funny ways to calm everyone around her, Mrs. Abigail remembered how she was like her when she was the same age as Rosa. Independent, energetic, and optimistic.\\n\\nMrs. Abigail: \\\"You were just like me when I was your age, Rosa.\\\" And all of a sudden, Mrs. Abigail cries.\\n\\nOnce Rosa sees Mrs. Abigail, cries, she knows what Mrs. Abigail is going through. Then, Rosa sits next to her, and she says,\\n\\nRosa: \\\"Please don't cry because you are also making me sad. I always return every year. I will not leave you, I promise. You are like my mother, now. Look! What we need right now is a hot tea and a piece of joyful music.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Abigail: \\\"Thank you, Rosa, and you are like a daughter I never had. I am sorry I cried. I didn't know what comes to me these days. I wish you could stay so we can spend Christmas together. Anyway, let's drink some tea and hear any songs you like.”\\n\\nMrs. Abigail looks at Rosa and smiles.\\n\\nRosa: \\\"You said you were like me just now. Are you sure about that? Because Rosa knows how to dance, but Rosa is not sure about the young Mrs. Abigail?\\\"\\n\\nRosa is a sincere type of person. When she wants to do something, she does it wholeheartedly. Ever since Rosa lost all of her family in the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no one else in her life that she could give a care about anymore until she met Mrs. Abigail. She sees Mrs. Abigail not only as a patient but also as the only family she has left.\\n\\nAfter she jokes around with Mrs. Abigail, she turns on a wifi speaker which belongs to Mrs. Abigail's late husband and connects it to her mobile. Then, a 2017 song titled \\\"Despacito\\\" by Justin Bieber feat Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee starts to fill throughout Mrs. Abigail's apartment.\\n\\n\\\"*Comin' over in my direction\\nSo thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah\\nTurn every situation into heaven, yeah\\nOh-oh, you are\\nMy sunrise on the darkest day...*\\\" (song lyric)\\n\\nRosa starts dancing in front of Mrs. Abigail, and they both laughing. They are having a great time in the living room. Suddenly the boiling pot starts screaming from inside the kitchen. Rosa lowers the volume, and she prepares the tea.\\n\\nTwenty minutes have passed, Rosa and Mrs. Abigail are still enjoying their late afternoon tea, and Rosa has turned the music off.\\n\\nThe small cat door is open beneath Mrs. Abigail's apartment door, and a fat female cat enters the apartment. It was Beatrice, but she returned home without Tom, her kitten. Not only she comes home alone, but she is meowing and in haste.\\n\\n## CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR\\n\\n### Night of the mist\\n\\n![(Illustration 39)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ycGeS_AyDNDmVB_z4uNWP.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\\n\\n***December 2024. Mrs. Abigail's residence***\\n\\nRight after Beatrice returns to Mrs. Abigail's apartment, she approaches Mrs. Abigail, and she starts meowing like never before. She goes to Mrs. Abigail's leg, and she keeps stroking her head and body to Mrs. Abigail's feet.\\n\\nMrs. Abigail: \\\"What is it, Beatrice? Where is Tom? Is he alright?\\\"\\n\\nRosa: \\\"What is wrong, Mrs. Fat Cat? Did you leave Tom by the door outside?”\\n\\nRosa goes to the main door, but the CCTV does not show anyone or even Tom outside. To be sure, Rosa opens the door, and she starts looking for Tom in the hallway until she walks to the building apartment's door, towards the park.\\n\\nBeatrice looks at Mrs. Abigail and jumps to her lap. She looks sad but in haste stroking her head and body to Mrs. Abigail over and over again, and then she raises her two heavy legs to Mrs. Abigail's left shoulder and strokes her head to Mrs. Abigail's cheeks. She starts kissing and licking Mrs. Abigail's face several times. Mrs. Abigail tries to calm Beatrice by cuddling her head and body. But as soon as Mrs. Abigail wants to hold her, she jumps to the floor and runs to Nancy, her other kittens, while her meowing turns louder.\\n\\nRosa is still standing outside looking for Tom near the entrance to the apartment building, which leads to the apartment walkways.\\n\\nThe day is getting dark as it is almost 6:00 p.m. After several minutes of looking for Tom outside, Rosa returns to the apartment.\\n\\nRosa: \\\"I can not find Tom, and it gets dark outside. It is beginning hard to see. Where is Beatrice now?\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Abigail: \\\"She went inside to see Nancy. I told you, Rosa, she has been meowing since morning and wanted to go outside. I think she took Tom somewhere when I was throwing the garbage earlier.\\\"\\n\\nSuddenly Beatrice returns to the living room in a hurry, and she carries Nancy in her mouth heads to the main door, but this time Rosa quickly closes the apartment door. Beatrice does not put Nancy down, and she only stares at Rosa and the door for several seconds.\\n\\nBeatrice looks panicky, she put Nancy on the floor from her mouth, and she meows by the door. At that moment, a person who never pets a cat will understand that Beatrice is requesting her owner to open the door for her. She goes to Mrs. Abigail again stroke her head and fat body to her leg, then she returns to her kitten, Nancy, hoping someone can open the door for her.\\n\\nRosa: \\\"Where are you going with Nancy, Beatrice? It is not safe outside and is late now. Where is Tom?\\\"\\n\\nBeatrice keeps meowing, and her sound is getting louder. Understand her Mama's voice, Nancy begins following her mother by meowing at the door.\\n\\nShe insists on going outside as if she does not want to stay in Mrs. Abigail's apartment anymore and wants to leave with her kitten for good after she says thank you and goodbye to Mrs. Abigail, in Beatrice's way.\\n\\nOr perhaps, Beatrice tries to tell Mrs. Abigail and Rosa to leave immediately that evening.\\n\\n## CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE\\n\\n### The call\\n\\n![(Illustration 40)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NOfUbEjykFlNJ4uC56npH.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\\n\\n***December 2024. Mrs. Abigail’s residence***\\n\\nRosa is a tough person, but like Mrs. Abigail, she also has a loving and caring heart. As a mother who raised a daughter once, she knows how Beatrice must be worried sick for leaving Tom alone somewhere on that early evening, and she has no time to prolong her dispute or force Beatrice to stay at Mrs. Abigail's apartment if Beatrice does not want to.\\n\\nAnd besides, Rosa has been working full-day, and she is tired. She wants to return to the dormitory near her office, although she still has one more thing to do, and that is going to the nearest supermarket to buy tea or any other kitchen-related stuff for Mrs. Abigail.\\n\\nRosa: \\\"Mrs. Abigail, should I let her out? I still have to go to the supermarket after this.\\\"\\n\\nInstead of responding directly to Rosa, Mrs. Abigail is upset at Beatrice since she has been noisy since morning and insists to go outside.\\n\\nMrs. Abigail: \\\"What is it with you, Beatrice? Today you have given me nothing but trouble. Where are you taking Tom and Nancy at this hour?\\\"\\n\\nBeatrice keeps meowing with her kitten by the main door, and after she knows no one wants to help her, she slams her fat body to the floor, which is always what Beatrice does when she is upset.\\n\\nAfter seeing Beatrice's gesture, Mrs. Abigail decides to let Beatrice out because she worries about Tom's safety without her mother at his side. But she also wants Beatrice to know that she was not pleased by her attitude today.\\n\\nMrs. Abigail: \\\"Open the door and let Beatrice out, Rosa. I am worried about Tom being alone outside at this hour. Maybe she is too, that is why she is upset and noisy. I don't understand why she is doing, because she never behaves this way before.\\\"\\n\\nRosa: \\\"Alright, Mrs. Fat Cat, you win. Be careful playing outside, and I will leave this tiny cat door for you to remain unlocked, okay. Do you get that? I am going to the supermarket soon, you three should also be at home by then.\\\"\\n\\nOnce Beatrice sees Rosa open the main door, she strokes Rosa's leg, then she carefully carries Nancy and slowly disappears into the night. Beatrice exits to the right side of the building, which leads to the main street and the underground sewer but not to the garden.\\n\\nRosa: \\\"Don't worry, Mrs. Abigail, she will return later tonight, but now I need to go to the supermarket before going home.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Abigail: \\\"Can I come along with you, Rosa? My heart feels so uncomfortable right now.\\\"\\n\\nRosa closes the door, and then she looks at Mrs. Abigail by smiling. And while she is still thinking, Rosa's mobile phone rings. The incoming call is from Catherine. Rosa quickly answers it and signals Mrs. Abigail to wait for a moment before she responds to her request.\\n\\nRosa: \\\"Hello, Catherine…\\\"\\n\\nCatherine: \\\"Hi, Rosa. We are still at the Supercenter right now, and Diana and I were talking about you because we are wondering if you like to join us for dinner here at the restaurant? Mike and Alice are still having a great time, so we will probably return home a little bit late this evening. Are you still in Mrs. Abigail's apartment?\\\"\\n\\nAs Rosa hears Catherine's offer, it is what she needs right now. A good rest and a nice dinner at a restaurant.\\n\\nRosa: \\\"Dinner at the supercenter? Right now? Yes of course....\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Abigail can hear clearly what the women were talking about, she says to Rosa,\\n\\nMrs. Abigail: \\\"Can I come along Rosa? I am so bored.\\\"\\n\\nRosa looks confused since she tries to listen to what Catherine has to say and Mrs. Abigail's opinion.\\n\\nRosa: \\\"Yes, I am still with Mrs. Abigail, and in her apartment...\\\"\\n\\nCatherine: \\\"Okay, so are you coming? I can take you home later since the supercenter is near to your house.\\\"\\n\\n## CHAPTER THIRTY SIX\\n\\n### Close call\\n\\n![(Illustration 41)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cf3ioIFrh8DyDJucih_au.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\\n\\n***December 2024. Mrs. Abigail’s residence***\\n\\nRosa: \\\"Sure, Catherine, I will come to the Supercenter because I still need to buy some groceries for Mrs. Abigail...\\\"\\n\\nCatherine: \\\"Right now? Are you still working? I thought you said you work until five in the afternoon the other day.\\\"\\n\\nRosa: \\\"Yes, I am, but today is quite a long day, and Mrs. Fat Cat, Beatrice. She has been making quite a commotion in the house since morning to Mrs. Abigail, but everything is fine now. And by the way, Catherine, will it be alright with you and Diana if Mrs. Abigail can come along? She asked me to ask you because she said she is bored at home right now. Well, if it's alright with both of you, of course?\\\"\\n\\nCatherine: \\\"Who? Mrs. Abigail?... Well, I don't know. Wait, Rosa, I ask Diana first. One minute Rosa.\\\"\\n\\nCatherine was not surprised by Rosa's question, but she wants to ask Diana if it is alright for Mrs. Abigail to come along to the supercenter.\\n\\nCatherine: \\\"Diana, Rosa is coming to have dinner with us, but she asks if it is alright for Mrs. Abigail to come along? Rosa said Beatrice has been troubling since morning, and she's bored at home..\\\"\\n\\nDiana: \\\"Who?... O, no, are you telling me that your dream is coming to you, now?\\\" (Diana laughing)\\n\\nCatherine: \\\"That's funny, Diana. Ha-ha-ha (Catherine laughs back sarcastically). So?!\\\"\\n\\nDiana: \\\"No problem. Let's have fun together, and besides, it is not like we have to worry about our husbands asking us where we are, aren't we? And one more thing, Catherine, some say, you need to face your fear (Diana laughs again).”\\n\\nCatherine: \\\"Likewise, Diana... (They both laughing).\\\"\\n\\nAfter making jokes about a simple question, Catherine talks again to Rosa on her mobile.\\n\\nCatherine: \\\"Okay, Rosa, let's all of us have fun together this evening.\\\"\\n\\nRosa: \\\"You are both angels. Okay, we are leaving in ten minutes, Catherine. See you there.\\\"\\n\\nCatherine: \\\"Okay, bye.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Abigail is so happy that she can come along with the girls. Rosa quickly orders an online taxi for two. In just a short while, a taxi responded and will pick them up in 7 minutes.\\n\\nRosa: \\\"Come on Mrs. Abigail, I need to get you ready in seven minutes.\\\"\\n\\nOnce the online taxi driver arrived by the apartment entrance. He saw an elderly lady with her nurse, so he immediately helping Rosa and Mrs. Abigail getting into his car. As everyone is seated in the car, the driver asks,\\n\\nTaxi driver: \\\"So everything is good to go? Anything else to bring along?\\\"\\n\\nRosa immediately rechecks everything, including Mrs. Abigail's medicine box.\\n\\nRosa: \\\"All good. Let's go.\\\"\\n\\nTaxi driver: \\\"Okay. Let's go. Excuse me, why is there smoke coming out from the bushes near that tree over there? Did someone make a barbeque?\\\"\\n\\nRosa: \\\"Where?... I don't know, it is too dark to see. Maybe, It looks like there is someone or more people there?\\\"\\n\\nTaxi driver: \\\"Do you want me to check it out first?\\\"\\n\\nRosa: \\\"No, I don't think so. Perhaps just the gardener with apartment security. What an odd coincidence? We were both just talking about that tree this afternoon. I don't think it's necessary and we have to meet our friends right now, and we are kind in a hurry.\\\"\\n\\nTaxi driver: \\\"Okay. Let's go.\\\"\\n\\nAs the online taxi drives away and passes the apartment's main gate, the mist starts to expand rapidly inside Catherine and Mrs. Abigail's apartment complex. The moving shadows that Rosa saw and thinks were the apartment security guards with the gardener begin to multiply, and creatures slowly lurking out from within the mist silently.\\n\\nDogs begin to bark suddenly can be heard throughout the apartment complex, helplessly trying to warn the rest of the residents who are trap inside their own homes without knowing where to escape.\\n\\nSeveral minutes later, numerous gunshots are heard from Catherine's apartment complex, followed by horrifying screams for help. Men, women, children, babies, and animals are viciously attacked and eaten while they are still alive by creatures coming out from an oak tree covered in mist on that tragic and dreadful December evening.\\n\\nAnd it is only the beginning…\\n\\n**(To be continued)**\",\"timestamp\":1633941125,\"title\":\"Survivor in the mist\"},\"digest\":\"0lxFhFG1ufIbyuBgfRDMSiE30YQ3t6GGmuyI1MT5Xpk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xc1C41e3606bF2756c09c95132F528012be17f724\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wg8oJqWRiHRLP3Zz1zzhuzNkcKThvoK_fay_6PwYC7c\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"e-RLvtHWPxywJxIy7kXPOEx9waDfbm-Wq7pLpqnWQbM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"fjsQEreCTvyawgHPYVO8aLv1MzjOI7YzeaWmyvQgmiI62U41YM2y_7hG4GQyFU6aJxtQmCP_HApFRX0NoAPQFA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x000d3aaaafb85cc19410044dcabab9cbfe7a2c74fb1b77d8d5b9e7acff504300161586b40d2f7cd0068b7dd12204d8fa59eb55ed4c01cbaed11c632e434bc9011c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wg8oJqWRiHRLP3Zz1zzhuzNkcKThvoK_fay_6PwYC7c\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"e-RLvtHWPxywJxIy7kXPOEx9waDfbm-Wq7pLpqnWQbM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"UvvVk_Z1bKz14GvvbA2S5EcQ60G1dIdQo6pcLrdfAa0\"}"
