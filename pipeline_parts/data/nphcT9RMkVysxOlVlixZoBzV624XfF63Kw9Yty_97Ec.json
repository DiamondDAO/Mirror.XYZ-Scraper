"{\"content\":{\"body\":\" I’ve been going down the rabbit hole since spring of 2017. After watching some Andreas Antonopoulos videos I decided to go all-in on crypto and find a full time job in the space. From one hand switching was easier because I was an online poker pro back then, so I don’t have to quit any job, from another - as a non-coder, non-native English speaker outside of US w/o a tons of work experience it ended up being hard. It took almost 4 years and after that I finally made it.  \\n  \\n  In this article I want to share my experience and some tips that hopefully will be helpful some someone trying to jump into the rocket.  \\n  \\n  1) Two words about **trading: forget about it**. Daytrading/swing trading is a profession and takes a few years of dedicated work to master. It’s easy to start but it’s a hard game to play. I started trading/arbitraging altcoins and made some money longing on the bull run. In 2018-2019 I keep longing and lost some of it back, got hacked a few times; just holding BTC and ETH would be better for me. Surviving the bear market was the hardest thing.  \\n  \\n  I’ve been doing other things like translating, writing content, trying to get airdrops/bounty (sometimes I actually did) etc \\n  \\n  In 2019 it was bear market, I was running out of money, gave up and get a job at local McDonalds… As a customer support at a fintech firm doing mostly US stocks that things and just started some crypto (so I don’t call it my 1st crypto job). I haven’t done a tons of crypto related stuff there but manager to survive the bear and learned from my experience that banks suck and stocks are boring as hell. In 2020 I started looking for smth different and sending my CV.  \\n  \\n 2) My **CV** was bad. You have only a few seconds to get an HR’s attention (that’s what Ryan Selkis from Messari said and didn’t hire me as an analyst, lol). You gotta learn the basics and create a decent one, google can help here.  \\n  \\n  3) **Job interview.** Actually it’s very similar to a regular non-crypto job.  \\n You can go to indeed.com and find “the most common questions for a job interview”, that what everybody usually ask. Like 80% of it. They really do, that’s why they call the articles like this. As a former poker pro I tried to focus more on my crypto experience, languages and people skills, it worked out for me.  \\n  \\n 4) Turning your **weaknesses** into you **strength**. I’m based outside of US and my English is not perfect. I still write using grammarly. I didn’t hide it, doesn’t make sense to lie on an interview. A firm was interested in hiring someone knowing another languages and working remotely in different timezone so I got lucky and landed I job in a crypto company based in US.  \\n  \\n 5) Prepare to wear a tons of **hats**, it’s most likely will be an early stage start up. Fast pace. I work as a tech support for an exchange, do a lot of things, mostly answer emails, the job is not glamorous but hey, I’m full time in crypto.  \\n  \\n Finding a job as a non-coder is hard, it’s even harder if your English has some flaws and your country is a wildwest shitshow. But it’s possible. Hope it will help someone.  \\n  \\n  \\n Twitter: @genki_sudo_k  \\n DM are open \\n  \\n Cheers! \\n\\n \",\"timestamp\":1641670450,\"title\":\"How I landed a full-time Crypto Job\"},\"digest\":\"N1oYJrc3GA4MfGB_cv38_s_J6dNECQiRRo0O0QzKRgw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6d79ADe3F835Cf7b24b74aF9FDa542fc941c0579\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"IFCsEP7HbIkpm0kh8fBPFcsX_k5sYG8VKJIwdXXXtO8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Y2BplNypJ4JoGqCUf0wilp92JYPIKVkxvQDPDCDlaTM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"g5Nfd0F0vE86IirBQNK4RdjOUNsc3fRWUmp0kc8VUp0xCm2kt4PpTKkdnuEsA5tF3s9gXhxVrrpRzu_lelKatw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa1e2b2e850774e429f62cfc7837434ccf88ac39aaecb26440795793529ad07902a9e1b8024eec9448d1ec25bf0cd4a937d6e4d19aaa5131708395073eeda721c1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"IFCsEP7HbIkpm0kh8fBPFcsX_k5sYG8VKJIwdXXXtO8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Y2BplNypJ4JoGqCUf0wilp92JYPIKVkxvQDPDCDlaTM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"N1oYJrc3GA4MfGB_cv38_s_J6dNECQiRRo0O0QzKRgw\"}"
