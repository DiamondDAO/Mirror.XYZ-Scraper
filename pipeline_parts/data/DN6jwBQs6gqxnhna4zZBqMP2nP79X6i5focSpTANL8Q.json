"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Happy Thursday!\\n\\nA lot has happened the past week in Dappland.\\n\\n**Story of the week:** ENS (Ethereum Name Service) transitioned into a DAO, and in the process distributed 25% of the total governance tokens to anyone who minted a domain using ENS since release.\\n\\nThe token appreciated upwards to $85 per token on Uniswap, making the 127,000 pre-existing users thousands, while proving the power of decentralization. Now the real test is how governance functions, with token-holders voting on delegates, and Coinbase winning a spot (despite being a centralized exchange). The question on my mind is can and will ENS DAO serve as a functional model for other DAOs?\\n\\nI missed a lot of the hoopla surrounding ENS, as I found myself caught up in a different type of frenzy, being shot in the head repeatedly by Mad Max characters, while “researching” Mini Royale: Nations, the first web3 game delivered by [Faraway](https://faraway.gg/).\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38413ac2-bbbe-4588-b577-e972ac71c170\\\\_1834x1140.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38413ac2-bbbe-4588-b577-e972ac71c170\\\\_1834x1140.png)\\n\\nMini Royale: Nations The studio has released an open [beta of the game](http://miniroyale.io/), and plans to add a in game economy built on top of Solana by Q2 2022.\\n\\n**Setup:**\\n\\nThe game is browser based, so you don’t need a specific device to play, which should drive more initial usage, compared to other Web3 games that are device specific.\\n\\n**Gameplay:**\\n\\nYou start off as a scruffy muscular guy. As you gain experience, you can customize the look by visiting the shop with coins earned in the game.\\n\\nFaraway explains in their white-paper that there will be a bunch of different play vs player modes. Currently in the open beta you have four:\\n\\n*   Team Deathmatch - *First team to kill set number of opponents.*\\n*   Battle Royale - *Last one living.*\\n*   Capture the Flag - *Most flags captured.*\\n*   Unreal Pistols - *Pistols, increased HP and speed.* *First to 30 kills.*\\n\\nAs a player, you earn XP, Battle Pass points and coins while you progress towards mission objectives while playing these modes.\\n\\n**Tip:** from playing around I noticed you garner more BP & XP points when playing capture the flag, or Death Match compared to Battle Royale, likely as you rack up way more kills, much faster. *These points and coins are needed to up-level and eventually get $Cheddar, the in-game currency when it officially launches on Solana (Q2, 2022).*\\n\\n**Mini Royale Nation keyboard controls:**\\n\\n*   Movement: WASD\\n*   Shift: slow walk\\n*   Aim: mouse\\n*   Shoot: left click\\n*   Focus: right click\\n*   Jump: space bar\\n*   Map/Tablet: caps lock\\n*   Inventory: tab\\n*   Switching Weapon: 1, 2, 3, 4\\n*   Using pill or syringe: X\\n\\n## **In-game Economy, and becoming a land owner.**\\n\\nHere’s where it gets interesting for those interested in-game economies. The game is designed to promote trade among two classifications of players:\\n\\n*   Shooters, typical players looking to battle and play.\\n*   Strategic land owners & builders, looking to create the ecosystem (and profit).\\n\\nHow it works:\\n\\n*   Shooters win items and tokens needed by Land owners / builders.\\n*   Land owners / builders win items needed by the Shooters\\n\\nThe two groups trade amongst themselves in order to benefit. See below for a diagram by the Faraway team explaining the economy flow they envision.\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe358be34-9692-4613-aedf-29b693a0cba7\\\\_1600x754.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe358be34-9692-4613-aedf-29b693a0cba7\\\\_1600x754.png)\\n\\nCore game loop from white-paper\\n\\nA common theme amongst metaverse worlds has been land ownership. Over, and over, we’ve seen VC’s / whales buy up land to drive passive income or sell sponsorships. This has led to land in practically any web3 game being snapped up for future rewards.\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0f86bc0-6a59-4384-9fd7-a23604904007\\\\_1317x697.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0f86bc0-6a59-4384-9fd7-a23604904007\\\\_1317x697.jpeg)\\n\\nBillboard sponsorship in popular metaverse game - decentraland\\n\\nWhile trolling the discord channel for MRN, I noted those same concerns brought up by users.\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedafa502-d4c2-4785-9627-775944021889\\\\_868x384.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedafa502-d4c2-4785-9627-775944021889\\\\_868x384.png)\\n\\n#### **Prerequisites for land ownership:**\\n\\nWhile, the mechanism for buying land is still in the works, Faraway has introduced rules for landownership, to ensure the game is player run and equitable.\\n\\nFor private land to be usable by other players (and capable of generating fees from this usage), the Land Owner has to build a HQ, one resource-producing building, and a storage facility. This purely requires $RYL tokens, which can be bought.\\n\\nBut, here’s the kicker: landowners need to be active participants in order to derive the most value from their lands, Per Faraway:\\n\\n> “There is a difference between land ownership and land control in the game. This is to indirectly tax passive landholders who are not active in the MRN community.”\\n\\n#### Landowners vs Rulers (the fight for land control):\\n\\nPlayers can wins **land control** by having the most powerful set of guns staked to that land. As a player with guns staked, you can get an up to 50% share of the Land Owner’s resource generating fees from a piece of land (through control). If no guns are staked, the owner gets 100 percent of the resource generating fees.\\n\\n**Becoming a ruler**\\n\\nIn order to gain control of a piece of Land, the Offensive Power of weapons staked on a piece of Land has to exceed the Land’s Defensive Power.\\n\\n**Clan support**\\n\\nAs part of the gameplay you can join a clan, which has several benefits for participating in this social behavior (and presumably lowering the CAC of getting new users).\\n\\nFrom a land perspective being part of a [Clan](https://dappland.substack.com/gameplay/clans) gives players both Offensive and Defensive boost modifiers for Staking guns to a piece of Land, and allows for multiple people from the same Clan to stake guns on that land.\\n\\n*   If players stake guns on someone else’s Land, and that player is in their Clan, then those guns contribute to the Defensive power on that Piece of land\\n*   If players stake guns on someone else’s Land, and that player is NOT in their Clan, then those guns contribute to the Offensive Power on that piece of land\\n\\nOnce a player gains control of a piece of Land, he or she has agency over which economic activity they take a cut of fees from.\\n\\n#### Ways for landowners to increase profit:\\n\\nAs landowners you are able to increase & secure profits in a few ways:\\n\\n1.  Buy shields using $Royale to block enemy attacks. During the period the shield is instituted, any players outside of your Clan are unable to stake additional guns on your land plot.\\n\\n2.  Construct buildings that will allow for the production, or optimization of valuable in game assets. Examples include:\\n\\n    *   Refineries\\n    *   Mines\\n\\n3.  Make sure you take collect fees before they get raided, AKA being on top of the ball. These fees need to be manually collected by either the Land Owner or Ruler, the process is not automatic.\\n\\n*There is a fee for players outside your Clan to use your Refineries or Mines*\\n\\nI find this framework interesting, as it really incentivizes land owners / builders to be active participants in order to profit and prevent getting raided by enemies. This is antithetical to most play to earn games, where venture capital or whales, buys up land as a passive investment, or to sell for higher on exchanges like Opensea, like what has happened on Decentraland, Cryptovoxels, and Sandbox.\\n\\nIt encourages community, versus outsiders, which feels more sustainable and user-driven.\\n\\n## Roadmap\\n\\nCurious, how & when you can participate in MRN?\\n\\n1.  [Open beta](https://miniroyale.io/) is available now, with the team hinting that rewards will be given for early tests.\\n2.  In their [white-paper](https://whitepaper.miniroyale.io/), the Faraway team shared a roadmap for now until mid next year:\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6288fc4d-3fff-48d1-9ca7-89986a845173\\\\_1540x647.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6288fc4d-3fff-48d1-9ca7-89986a845173\\\\_1540x647.png)\\n\\n3.  **They are holding a town hall to answer questions on November 15th.** If you’re interested in playing, or want to know how to be a landowner in one of the most anticipated games to date, I’d hit attend.\\n\\nAs always, thanks for reading.\\n\\nJared\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637096899,\"title\":\"Mini Royale: become a bada$$ killer & earn $Cheddar at the same time.\"},\"digest\":\"RF1qxnw-2bq69wIrMrOkgBsXcCDVfDTcQ3MPQG9hnhE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4B14f1B382B9ccbE683EE1Ef689fA7dD332d69AB\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"int-VfBrid6IpujXOt-7-6iWif8eWf91M-fk1vdjToU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"A1a8Dj75VpYicM9S2Ro-8GoowgnWP8juIV5zYPZ2MPo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"mHkhedqvMLHEULBsn_N57ja16xbfb7WAs98KK_hbgXmDmO1mSE5VHbJNSXxkBlNOtPYkPBl5Ppclociw7C_3Vg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x424b37d8393c0d26b33f772dafc95d4806a94bf0a487dded46f8f40da32cdf3f18b7209534522cf2026b96ef0b0a34407027dee4c511dd4ab3d7b9b2ab6062111c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"int-VfBrid6IpujXOt-7-6iWif8eWf91M-fk1vdjToU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"A1a8Dj75VpYicM9S2Ro-8GoowgnWP8juIV5zYPZ2MPo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"RF1qxnw-2bq69wIrMrOkgBsXcCDVfDTcQ3MPQG9hnhE\"}"
