"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**ointelegraph Markets Pro User:** How can someone benefit from bots / API \\\\[Application Programming Interface\\\\] trading with no coding experience? Does OKEx have any partnerships fully integrated?\\n\\n**OKEx Staff:** TLDR \\\\[Too Long, Didn't Read\\\\], you do NOT need to have any coding experience to automate trades with the trading bot on OKEx. We make it really easy for you to set the trading bot up — it's integrated into the OKEx trading dashboard. You can basically go fully automated by choosing the AI option and just setting the order amount in Tether ([USDT](https://cointelegraph.com/tether-price-index)) or you can manually set your parameters, including the upper and lower price limits, for the asset you want to trade.\\n\\nSo the bot is essentially an auto-trading tool with pre-set parameters. Trading bots can maximize profit potential, especially in times of a range-traded market. So with a trading bot, like the one we have on OKEx, it will be more profitable if the market you choose goes up (selling), then down (buying), then up, down, etc., rather than just up, up, up. The trading bot on OKEx is available for all spot trading pairs, which means you can buy and sell Ether ([ETH](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price)), in and out of Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)), for example. A trading bot video tutorial is coming soon! Next week, likely, but here's the written tutorial. And here's what it [looks](https://www.okex.com/academy/en/automated-trading-on-okex-with-artificial-intelligence-trading-bots-or-manual-trading-bots) like in the user interface (UI). You don't need to \\\\[have\\\\] API/coding experience in order to execute such a powerful and automated strategy. \",\"timestamp\":1639119645,\"title\":\"ointelegraph Markets Pro User: How can someone benefit from bots / A\"},\"digest\":\"00vAjYR2BWVwK_mMqEedBE2ATJdIjj_KV_1WN3z_UDE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9d5721cC666fe69c82F54dA3d57BD60F93a1727f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-snkGnS1ulVrARI-7xl467vP8M9lQNT_CGCFRoouprQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KrCwjYQvxlg_eT9wecKxCNaRWcv8RAJqO2ZGuN_s1eI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"dA_fVBqTYYIQUWJmvCnO3QhKaemB2ttivAb8g-4kpQnkI5x9Z_Sc-4nsCP7GckLsFW-VGVFkvOfJrHGmXdbQlQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0060b077a1c1d89b304575db6ebd8e84f117192aea2cbb29e7ee215e4d652adf4b4b3d52078f18938ee2bfaf230687ac20558fb9f7d3243d4ec1d853d58094f81c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-snkGnS1ulVrARI-7xl467vP8M9lQNT_CGCFRoouprQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KrCwjYQvxlg_eT9wecKxCNaRWcv8RAJqO2ZGuN_s1eI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"00vAjYR2BWVwK_mMqEedBE2ATJdIjj_KV_1WN3z_UDE\"}"
