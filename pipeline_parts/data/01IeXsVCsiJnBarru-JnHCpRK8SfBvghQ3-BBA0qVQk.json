"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"It is difficult to write when you are putting together a book. There is much to look into. You say you are taking a break but it is more of the same thing that takes more time or delays the task at hand. Words take time to snap out from the thought stream into the screen especially if it is on a specific subject. There is more processing involved when it comes to writing a research post of any kind. Then there are temporal distractions which become projects. I haven't completely gotten a grip on my substack yet but now there is mirror dot xyz. This right here. I don't have the capacity to post another set of ideas onto another platform. But still, this is written while on a break from actual writing. I am not referring to anything, not all that much but a reflection on what my anticipated relationship with web3 will turn out as. The thing about the distractions all revolves around time and investment in the platform for it to generate any returns. Web2 was just time, web3 is time and money. First, there are the ens domains as a foundation of activities. Even before that you need to be part of some exchange. See the prices rise and fall. Then a wallet with some money from the exchange. Stop after money is the NFTs marketplaces. Both of these require a lot of whitepaper and documents reading. That is time. Yes, you can mint for free but it is just an onboarding exercise to spend more money on the platform. Proper minting costs, almost like actual paintings have canvas, brushes, and colors that costs. This is one part of the web3 ecosystem. The metaverse is another business that you need to know a bit about how art works and then gaming on web2. Investment then just escalates from there.\\n\\n**exchange**\\n\\n* coinbase\\n\\n**contract**\\n\\n* ens domains\\n\\n**gas**\\n\\n* ethgas.watch\\n* gas.metasync\\n\\n**storage**\\n\\n* ipfs\\n* pinata\\n\\n**marketplaces**\\n\\n* opensea\\n* rarible\\n* foundation\\n* niftygateway\\n* knownorigin\\n* superrare\\n* mintable\\n\\n**metaverse**\\n\\n* decentraland\\n* roblox\\n* nikeland\\n* sandbox\\n* cryptovoxels\\n* somniumspace\\n* omniverse\\n* xboxmuseum\",\"timestamp\":1638691149,\"title\":\"2112050043 daily sentences\"},\"digest\":\"QZP8k49P-jyk2bUb_FZ6z9VOWKGCf3q-JdX9HVEkidg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9A1EB96d2eCEDF6fd6423DFA24755EE7B23C2D7C\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"oC9l2gwA9zEg70_S9-eGqTEEKvF5oZJZtsFDjbnRtEQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3vd_oigx9nIYBjn1QKEdSIfUMo2XZNT-q5veSAwZpRE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"7H0mxc0mTXpnUXKvkpmtk-fCqAMwoXHL1X2B4QDGvwXFF0kTsi1qsUfYd6a9m326qIw1be42dg8u3ch8xkdG0w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x3f8023d56f219495ad0aae96c5d77466c7fe2ea219f7aea70fd8b264820978417bf88e267fc9918e8afedaab2112ab66cf1829e2cd5c88a58924d7c334a6204b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"oC9l2gwA9zEg70_S9-eGqTEEKvF5oZJZtsFDjbnRtEQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3vd_oigx9nIYBjn1QKEdSIfUMo2XZNT-q5veSAwZpRE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wwW4pbkm6tcNkGF6YIAWWGj-hh0CSpzL9EOhEeYEJbk\"}"
