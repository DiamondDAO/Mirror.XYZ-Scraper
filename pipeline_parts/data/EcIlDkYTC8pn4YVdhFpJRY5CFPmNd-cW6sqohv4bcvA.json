"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### Deep dive into the future of interoperability of blockchains\\n\\nWhile Bitcoin is king, I don’t subscribe to the notion that it’s the only sheriff in town. With [over 110 active public blockchains](https://blockchain-comparison.com/blockchain-protocols/) it is not unreasonable to suggest that the “**one-chain-to-rule-them-all**” thesis is dead.\\n\\nCEO of **Avalanche** **[Emin Gün Sirer](https://twitter.com/el33th4xor)** gets it.\\n\\n![Source: Twitter](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zL-90SgdRuDi7fkCfGMBC.png?height=386&width=736)\\n\\n**Despite what individual tribes believe, the reality is that technology is ephemeral.** What is the best technology now may not stay the best forever. This means that the number of these networks will likely continue to increase into the future.\\n\\n**All of these new blockchains (plus Ethereum Layer-2 roll-ups) will need to talk to each other so this necessitates the need for interoperability between these distinct networks.** **Accordingly, cross-chain bridges attempt to unify this increasingly fragmented landscape by enabling the transfer of tokens, assets, smart contract instructions, or data between blockchains.**\\n\\n**[Ryan Selkis](https://twitter.com/twobitidiot)**, CEO and co-founder of **[Messari Inc](https://messari.io/)**, rightly [notes](https://messari.io/crypto-theses-for-2022) that:\\n\\n> ”By now, it’s abundantly clear that a multichain world isn’t just the future, it’s the present.”\\n\\nSpeaking of which, **Ryan Selkis** has written up an excellent **[crypto theses](https://messari.io/crypto-theses-for-2022)** detailing key trends, people, companies, and projects across the crypto landscape, with predictions for 2022. **This report is a must-read for all budding crypto professionals.**\\n\\nI have spent the last 6 days going over it, highlighting things, clicking on links, and above all **LEARNING**. It is not too late! Do yourself a favour — print it (all 165 pages of it) & read it. Here is a podcast for you if you are more of a listener:\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i621Hrd978s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i621Hrd978s)\\n\\nTo be sure **Ryan Selkis** has dedicated a whole section on scaling and interoperability solutions.\\n\\nAs **[Do Kwon](https://twitter.com/stablekwon)** chimes in at the [Mainnet](https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1439969124550119431) conference:\\n\\n> ”Maybe it’s a bad idea to stick all the applications into one global computer. Maybe it just makes sense to have a multi-chain future.”\\n\\nThis is well reflected by the fact that we have seen an explosion in blockchain bridges that attempt to unify an increasingly fragmented landscape.\\n\\n**[DezentralizedFinance.com](https://dezentralizedfinance.com/cross-chain-bridges/)** lists more than **50 different bridge projects**:\\n\\n![Source: DezentralizedFinance.com](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UW_5-HewYVAF0waBVmabo.png?height=713&width=963)\\n\\nTo create a better framework on how to evaluate each bridge design we can draw on **[Dmitriy Berenzon](https://twitter.com/dberenzon)’s** article ***[Blockchain Bridges: Building Networks of Cryptonetworks](https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/blockchain-bridges-5db6afac44f8)***, which overviews the various approaches to cross-chain bridges.\\n\\nAt an abstract level, **Dmitriy Berenzon** defines a bridge as a system that transfers information between two or more blockchains. In this context, “information” could refer to assets, contract calls, proofs, or state. He offers a nice visual to conceptualize cross-chain bridges.\\n\\n![Source: Blockchain Bridges: Building Newtworks of Cryptonetworks](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WdnQnD3LjJ-BkC1bhs5Rf.png?height=775&width=1357)\\n\\nTo clarify things further **Dmitriy Berenzon** distinguishes roughly four types of bridges. I believe this separation is very useful for our understanding of bridges.\\n\\n* **Asset-specific**: A bridge with the sole purpose of providing access to a specific asset from a foreign chain.\\n* **Chain-specific**: A bridge between two blockchains which usually supports simple operations around locking & unlocking tokens on the source chain and minting any wrapped asset on the destination chain.\\n* **Application-specific**: An application that provides access to two or more blockchains, but solely for use within that application.\\n* **Generalized:** A protocol specifically designed for transferring information across multiple blockchains.\\n\\n\\\\*See [article](https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/blockchain-bridges-5db6afac44f8) for more details.\\n\\n![Source: Blockchain Bridges: Building Newtworks of Cryptonetworks](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mlK0ur3nzP8wCoLxckfh4.png?height=551&width=963)\\n\\n**Dmitriy Berenzon** rightly notes that **while an ideal state would have been one homogeneous bridge for everything, it is likely that there is no single “best” bridge design and that different types of bridges will be best fit for specific applications** (e.g. asset transfer, contract calls, minting tokens).\\n\\n**Ryan Selkis** would certainly agree with this assertion. In fact, he is convinced that **it’s inevitable that cross-chain bridges will facilitate an enormous amount of asset and data transfer volume.** He goes on to prognosticate that **the most popular L1 <> L2 / L1 <> L1 / L2 <>L2 bridge protocols will have higher daily volumes than the most popular centralized exchange within five years.**\\n\\nAccording to data by **[Footprint Analytics](https://www.footprint.network/guest/question/3c012763-936a-4edf-a340-6e3c88c2fca3/ethereum-bridges-tvl-ranking-change)** the four largest cross-chain bridges namely, **[Avalanche Bridge](https://bridge.avax.network/login)**, **[Polygon Bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/)**, **[Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/)** and **[Fantom Anyswap Bridge](https://anyswap.exchange/#/bridge)**, account for 95.61% of the entire cross-chain bridge, with its highest monthly increase of 401.23% last month.\\n\\n![Source: Footprint Analytics](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XkR0C1W2F9xgNGiscCKqi.png?height=467&width=963)\\n\\nTo go through each and every cross-chain bridge is beyond the scope of this post but let’s consider some projects that have caught my eyes.\\n\\n## **Hop Protocol**\\n\\nMoving assets between roll-ups and the Layer 1 network is slow and expensive, thereby diminishing the savings users gain by using the roll-up.\\n\\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cb42944-6eb7-4efd-9ea2-8023acf1b2ea_963x321.jpeg)\\n\\n**The [Hop Protocol](https://hop.exchange/) allows allows users to quickly and easily transfer tokens among blockchains such as Ethereum, Polygon, xDAi, Optimism, and Arbitrum,** **enabling a composable and interoperable layer-2 ecosystem for Ethereum.**\\n\\nFor more details check out this **Bankless Podcast** interview with CEO and Founder of Hop Protocol **[Chris Whinfrey](https://twitter.com/WhinfreyChris):**\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFM2hvdXcHA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFM2hvdXcHA)\\n\\nThe Hop Protocol has caught my attention because it is the leading trust-minimized bridge by [volume](https://dune.xyz/rchen8/Hop-Exchange) right now and uses bonders and stableswap AMMs to rebalance funds on both sides of the bridge.\\n\\nKeyword here is **trust-minimized** bridge!\\n\\n**[Richard Chen](https://twitter.com/richardchen39)** explains that almost **all cross-chain bridges right now are variations of trusted [multisigs](https://thecontrol.co/under-the-radar-product-trends-2021-recap-and-2022-predictions-403084a63ce8)**. The Ethereum to Avalanche bridge, in particular, is an **EOA** (Externally Owned Account) whose private key is [sharded](https://twitter.com/ChrisBlec/status/1445811525491507200) among four trusted Intel SGX signers. And it [holds over $6B](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe78388b4ce79068e89bf8aa7f218ef6b9ab0e9d0) in users’ funds.\\n\\n![Source: Twitter](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mRaOm7I-ZB0BQ4V1Qfkbs.png?height=467&width=742)\\n\\nThis in and of itself is very worrisome as these bridges are massive **honeypots** and it is not unreasonable to predict that **dredict bridge hacks will be the new CEX and DeFi hacks**. For example, the **[$611M Poly Network hack](https://rekt.news/polynetwork-rekt/)** might just be the tip of the iceberg of what’s to come.\\n\\nWhile the focus of bridges to date has been on token transfers, **[Richard Chen](https://twitter.com/richardchen39) points out that the holy grail and an active area of research right now is on how to do cross-chain message passing trustlessly.**\\n\\n**Hop Protocol doesn’t have a token (yet)!** So you’d be advised to check out [How To Bridge Your Assets Using Hop Protocol](https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/how-to-bridge-your-assets-using-hop-protocol/?utm_content=191516262&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-3129477561) for a more practical guide on how to use this technology. This might very well be worth your time! **Put simply, use the bridge to get a chance of receiving a potential retroactive airdrop from Hop Protocol!**\\n\\n## **Loopring**\\n\\n**tldr: [Loopring](https://loopring.org/#/) is Ethereum’s first and only ZK roll-up DEX.**\\n\\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8537aacb-e548-42a4-baff-d73a0a9ae1f8_963x309.png)\\n\\n**[Loopring](https://loopring.org/#/) is an open-source, audited, and non-custodial decentralized exchange**. It hosts a unique approach compared to other Ethereum-based DEXs, implementing ZK roll-ups, which is centred around [scalability](https://medium.com/pnetwork/loopring-lists-pbtc-creating-the-first-cross-chain-dex-bridge-with-zkrollups-1e39db83cdcf).\\n\\n**In particular, Loopring allows anyone to build high-throughput, non-custodial, orderbook-based exchanges on Ethereum by leveraging Zero-Knowledge Proofs.** If you are not on the ZK roll-ups bandwagon check out my previous article **[here](https://freibier.substack.com/p/ethereum-might-have-more-to-offer?r=xmscc&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)** and **[here](https://freibier.substack.com/p/the-ethereum-scaling-solutions-gold?r=xmscc&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)**. Suffice to say that ZK roll-ups in particular are poised to be the key scalability solution for Ethereum for the foreseeable future.\\n\\n**[The Wolf Of All Streets](https://twitter.com/scottmelker)** would certainly agree with this assertion:\\n\\n![Source: Twitter](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Nmjcj9fIlsrkab76Kr8DH.png?height=357&width=736)\\n\\nWith zk Roll-ups, Loopring asserts its exchanges can offer faster settlements for traders. Rather than settling trades on the Ethereum blockchain directly (as other decentralized exchanges do), zk Roll-ups enable Loopring exchanges to complete key computations [elsewhere](https://www.kraken.com/uk-ua/learn/what-is-loopring-lrc).\\n\\nThe idea is that this can reduce the number of transactions that a Loopring exchange will need to submit to the Ethereum network, thus increasing speed and reducing costs for traders.\\n\\nSpeaking of The Man, The Myth, The Legend — **[Vitalik Buterin](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin)** was interviewed today (05.01.2022) by the **Bankless** duo, in which **he specifically mentioned Loopring and the cheap and fast transactions that they are able to offer**. Here is the whole two hours of it. Enjoy!\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1m_PTVxD-s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1m_PTVxD-s)\\n\\n**All in all, I love me some [ZK roll-ups](https://freibier.substack.com/p/the-ethereum-scaling-solutions-gold?r=xmscc&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web) and therefore by extension I am very intrigued by Loopring.** Gas fees are too damn high and this is the reason why I stay away from Uniswap and all other DEXs. Does Loopring fix this?\\n\\n![Source: Twitter](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_nmDuyKWlBxzG0xOMbJb5.png?height=728&width=732)\\n\\nBe that as it may, Loopring appears to be gaining momentum. **Most [recently](https://medium.com/pnetwork/loopring-lists-pbtc-creating-the-first-cross-chain-dex-bridge-with-zkrollups-1e39db83cdcf) Loopring announced that** **[pTokens](http://ptokens.io/) BTC is now available on Loopring exchange and can be swapped with USDT.** This makes Loopring compatible with BTC and introduces its market liquidity.\\n\\nThere has also been talk about the possibility of a partnership with **[GameStop](https://wccftech.com/loopring-lrc-deserves-a-new-all-time-high-even-if-the-much-hyped-partnership-with-gamestop-gme-does-not-materialize/)**. \\\\*Not sure if this is bullish. We didn’t have GameStop in New Zealand so I don’t quite get excited about this.\\n\\nAnd last but not least I wanted to introduce you to an interoperability startup called **[LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/).**\\n\\n## **LayerZero**\\n\\n**tldr: Interoperability that actually works!**\\n\\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F425a5c14-f002-44da-bd82-7ac8753d6dc6_963x497.png)\\n\\nIn short, **LayerZero** is an omnichain interoperability protocol that unites decentralized applications (dapps) across disparate blockchains.\\n\\nRead **[Ryan Zarick’s](https://twitter.com/ryanzarick)** [LayerZero- An Omnichain Interoperability Protocol](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/layerzero-an-omnichain-interoperability-protocol-b43d2ae975b6) to get into the weeds of this project.\\n\\nTheir **[whitepaper](https://layerzero.network/)** is an easy read. Notably, it lists all the important players in the cross-chain interaction space, why they fall short of the ideals of trustless valid delivery, and how **LayerZero** closes that gap i.e. **whose lunch they are going to eat!** (e.g. Polygon, THORChain, Polkadot, AnySwap, and others beware — LayerZero is coming for your lunch!)\\n\\nHere is a nifty diagram of the architectural differences between CEXs, DEXs, and a cross-chain bridge built using LayerZero.\\n\\n![Source: LayerZero whitepaper](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/O1IO0EDmcMsQrIWqaz9EZ.png?height=414&width=963)\\n\\n**The ultimate goal is that LayerZero will connect all chains seamlessly, having users unaware they are even using it. It will enable current and new Decentralized Applications to expand beyond the borders of EVM or Non-EVM, creating the world’s first omnichain applications.**\\n\\n**\\\\*Please note: It’s a start-up so no token yet!**\\n\\nThat certainly sounds mouth watering — \\\\***[Multicoin Capital](https://multicoin.capital/)** (**[Kyle Samani](https://twitter.com/KyleSamani)** at it again — his spider webs are everywhere), Binance Labs, [Delphi Digital](https://delphidigital.io/) (the experts for the experts), and many other high profile VC’s would certainly agree as they have poured serious initial seed funding into this project. **[Do Kwon](https://twitter.com/stablekwon)** of Luna is also in on the action as an angel investor.\\n\\n\\\\*Zoom over to [Multicoin Capital](https://multicoin.capital/) and read their [thesis](https://assets.ctfassets.net/qtbqvna1l0yq/5f1FAdRDF71JzD7CG5ZHeL/f0d52e3ae3b8c7bcfc63d8f29d004e76/Crypto_Mega_Theses.pdf) — good stuff! Also follow [Kyle Samani](https://twitter.com/KyleSamani) on Twitter.

Accordingly, **many maxi tribes across the industry might have to swallow the bitter ‘interoperability’ pill and embrace it as fundamental to the industry’s future.**\\n\\nI have zoomed in on the **Hop Protocol** (airdrop?), **Loopering** (ZK roll-ups), and **LayerZero** (novel technology) but there are certainly other projects out there that stand out.\\n\\n**[Synapse](https://synapseprotocol.com/?inputCurrency=USDC&outputCurrency=MIM&outputChain=42161)**, **[dYdX](https://dydx.exchange/), [Ren](https://renproject.io/), [THORChain](https://thorchain.org/)** and many other cross-chain bridges equally deserve some love so get your spectacle out and #DYOR.\\n\\nI will leave you with this little gem by **[EllioTrades Crypto](https://twitter.com/elliotrades):**\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mt7rOAyAlUc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mt7rOAyAlUc)\\n\\nIn this video **[Ellio](https://twitter.com/elliotrades)** rightly points out that **the crypto market is characterized by microcycles of narratives with bullish 3 month cycles.** This makes sense — think of **DeFi summer** or the crazy **[NFT craze](https://freibier.substack.com/p/getting-aquainted-with-nfts?r=xmscc&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)**.
