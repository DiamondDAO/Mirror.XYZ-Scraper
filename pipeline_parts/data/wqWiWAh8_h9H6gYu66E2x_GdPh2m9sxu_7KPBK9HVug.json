"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Cosmos Hub Users:**\\n\\n* **ATOM Governance Prop 44**: Without this proposal there would be no Evmos. Thanks to the generosity of the community for giving the Tharsis team 100,000 ATOMs, Evmos is made possible! Individual users that voted (independent of the option) will be eligible for this item.\\n* **ATOM Delegators**: Staking is a critical component of securing the network and we want to thank those that take part in it. Those delegated to centralized exchange validators will not be included in this snapshot. We will reward based on whether or not you have staked, not based on how much you have staked.\\n\\n**Osmosis Users**\\n\\n* **OSMO Delegators**: Osmosis has played a critical role in the growth of the Cosmos ecosystem as the first decentralized exchange on Cosmos and as such we want to thank those that have been early contributors.\\n* **OSMO/ATOM LPs**: This pool is not only the largest but also the first pool created on Osmosis and thus one that we felt had to be included.\\n* **OSMO/AKT, ATOM/AKT LPs**: With a founder named [Akash](http://twitter.com/akash_khosla) (the rightful CEO of [Akash Network](https://akash.network/)), it felt wrong not to reward these LPers.\\n* **OSMO/UST LPs**: Not only is it one of the first stablecoins, but many holders of UST have been early DeFi users of Terra and should be rewarded as such.\\n* **ION Holders**: ION has graced the Cosmos ecosystem with its presence and we want to encourage further development of ION’s use cases and potential.\\n* **IBC Token Transfers**: IBC is the core of what makes Cosmos special and we want to reward users who take advantage of Cosmos’ capabilities. This item applies to all users that have transferred tokens to and from the Osmosis chain\",\"timestamp\":1642691813,\"title\":\"The Evmos Rektdrop\"},\"digest\":\"OT4LFJ51VZEJGfXX1wiiEoqN4ZZD-zu5L0eNkS_zVdQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x16Ad14D08a7826D6fA61ee85b51178DC043239A4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4RsrJ9K2wf5zwvuuA7OwzVzDqLp9UC7qroy46qQKUxU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dm9wFPpFBDxJfBNVYM8oKTwtpW6UoPrfirpDeoOnX0I\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Y1ITGfKQZc1TYklbHEdHDqRxFWt9KImoTEaGy4Bx3uJCI5Oc_NVNw0NI7Tmnib3cYxsBdS5BId-75YGnhTqNQQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1ef9eef5a9a631e39a8345ee373c8e50e458552d9f95f69831f03abec381868a5b5e0c34f9346fd06cc199c37e82c693da650a84836a39bb0be5fe28099f640b1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4RsrJ9K2wf5zwvuuA7OwzVzDqLp9UC7qroy46qQKUxU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dm9wFPpFBDxJfBNVYM8oKTwtpW6UoPrfirpDeoOnX0I\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"OT4LFJ51VZEJGfXX1wiiEoqN4ZZD-zu5L0eNkS_zVdQ\"}"
