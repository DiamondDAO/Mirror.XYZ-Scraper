"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"and in a tone of mingled sentimentality and irony, he said: \\\"I know that it's absurd, and that I shall be the laughing-stock of my acquaintances.  Still it doesn't matter; I have never been coward enough to hide my feelings.  I'm in love, my dear baron, as madly in love as a young collegian--sufficiently in love to watch my lady's house at night even when I have no possible hope of seeing her.  I thought myself blase, I boasted of being invulnerable.  Well, one fine morning I woke up with the heart of a youth of twenty beating in my breast--a heart which trembled at the slightest glance from the girl I love, and sent purple flushes to my face.  Naturally I tried to reason with myself.  I was ashamed of my weakness; but the more clearly I showed myself my folly, the more obstinate my heart became.  And perhaps my folly is not such a great one after all.  Such perfect beauty united with such modesty, grace, and nobility of soul, such passion, candor and talent, cannot be met twice in a lifetime.  I intend to leave Paris.  We shall first of all go to Italy, my wife and I.  After a while we shall return and install ourselves at Valorsay, like two turtle-doves.  Upon my word, my imagination paints a charming picture of the calm and happy life we shall lead there! I don't deserve such good fortune.  I must have been born under a lucky star!\\\"\\n\\nHad he been less engrossed in his narrative, he would have heard the sound of a stifled oath in the adjoining room; and had he been less absorbed in the part he was playing, he would have observed a cloud on his companion's brow.  The baron was a keen observer, and he had detected a false ring in this apparently vehement outburst of passion.  \\\"I understand it now, my dear marquis,\\\" said he; \\\"you have met the descendant of some illustrious but impoverished family.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are wrong.  My future bride has no other name than her Christian name of Marguerite.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is a regular romance then!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are quite right; it is a romance.  Were you acquainted with the Count de Chalusse, who died a few days ago?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No; but I have often heard him spoken of.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, it is his daughter whom I am about to marry--his illegitimate daughter.\\\"\\n\\nThe baron started.  \\\"Excuse me,\\\" said he; \\\"M. de Chalusse was immensely rich, and he was a bachelor.  How does it happen then that his daughter, even though she be his illegitimate child, should find herself penniless?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A mere chance--a fatality.  M. de Chalusse died very suddenly; he had no time to make a will or to acknowledge his daughter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But why had he not taken some precautions?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A formal recognition of his daughter was attended by too many difficulties, and even dangers.  Mademoiselle Marguerite had been abandoned by her mother when only five or six months old; it is only a few years since M. de Chalusse, after a thousand vain attempts, at last succeeded in finding her.\\\"\\n\\nIt was no longer on Pascal's account, but on his own, that Baron Trigault listened with breathless attention.  \\\"How very strange,\\\" he exclaimed, in default of something better to say.  \\\"How very strange!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Isn't it? It is as good as a novel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Would it be--indiscreet----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To inquire? Certainly not.  The count told me the whole story, without entering into particulars--you understand.  When he was quite young, M. de Chalusse became enamoured of a charming young lady, whose husband had gone to tempt fortune in America.  Being an honest woman, she resisted the count's advances for awhile--a very little while; but in less than a year after her husband's departure, she gave birth to a pretty little daughter, Mademoiselle Marguerite.  But then why had the husband gone to America?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" faltered the baron; \\\"why--why, indeed?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Everything was progressing finely, when M. de Chalusse was in his turn obliged to start for Germany, having been informed that a sister of his, who had fled from the paternal roof with nobody knows who, had been seen there.  He had been absent some four months or so, when one morning the post brought him a letter from his pretty mistress, who wrote: 'We are lost! My husband is at Marseilles: he will be here to-morrow.  Never attempt to see me again.  Fear everything from him.  Farewell.' On receiving this letter, M. de Chalusse flung himself into a postchaise, and returned to Paris.  He was determined, absolutely determined, to have his daughter.  But he arrived too late.  On hearing of her husband's return, the young wife had lost her head.  She had but one thought--to conceal her fault, at any cost; and one night, being completely disguised, she left her child on a doorstep in the vicinity of the central markets----\\\"\\n\\nThe marquis suddenly paused in his story to exclaim: \\\"Why, what is the matter with you, my dear baron? What is the matter? Are you ill? Shall I ring?\\\"\\n\\nThe baron was as pale as if the last drop of blood had been drawn from his veins, and there were dark purple circles about his eyes.  Still, on being questioned, he managed to answer in a choked voice, but not without a terrible effort: \\\"Nothing! It is nothing.  A mere trifle! It will be over in a moment.  It IS over!\\\" Still his limbs trembled so much that he could not stand, and he sank on to a chair, murmuring: \\\"I entreat you, marquis--continue.  It is very interesting--very interesting indeed.\\\"\\n\\nM. de Valorsay resumed his narrative.  \\\"The husband was incontestably an artless fellow: but he was also, it appears, a man of remarkable energy and determination.  Having somehow ascertained that his wife had given birth to a child in his absence, he moved heaven and earth not only to discover the child, but its father also.  He had sworn to kill them both; and he was a man to keep his vow unmoved by a thought of the guillotine.  And if you require a proof of his strength of character, here it is: He said nothing to his wife on the subject, he did not utter a single reproach; he treated her exactly as he had done before his absence.  But he watched her, or employed others to watch her, both and night, convinced that she would finally commit some act of imprudence which would give him the clue he wanted.  Fortunately, she was very shrewd.  She soon discovered that her husband knew everything, and she warned M. de Chalusse, thus saving his life.\\\"\\n\\nIt is not at all remarkable that the Marquis de Valorsay should have failed to see any connection between his narrative and the baron's agitation.  What possible connection could there be between opulent Baron Trigault and the poor devil who went to seek his fortune in America? What imaginable connection could there be between the confirmed gambler, who was Kami-Bey's companion, Lia d'Argeles's friend, and the husband who for ten long years had pursued the man who, by seducing his wife, had robbed him of all the happiness of life? Another point that would have dispelled any suspicions on the marquis's part was that he had found the baron greatly agitated on arriving, and that he now seemed to be gradually regaining his composure.  So he continued his story in his customary light, mocking tone.  It is the perfection of good taste and high breeding--\\\"proper form,\\\" indeed, not to be astonished or moved by anything, in fact to sneer at everything, and hold one's self quite above the emotions which disturb the minds of plebeians.\\n\\nThus the marquis continued: \\\"I am necessarily compelled to omit many particulars, my dear baron.  The count was not very explicit when he reached this part of his story; but, in spite of his reticence, I learned that he had been tricked in his turn, that certain papers had been stolen from him, and that he had been defrauded in many ways by his inamorata.  I also know that M. de Chalusse's whole life was haunted by the thought of the husband he had wronged.  He felt a presentiment that he would die by this man's hand.  He saw danger on every side.  If he went out alone in the evening, which was an exceedingly rare occurrence, he turned the street corners with infinite caution; it seemed to him that he could always see the gleam of a poniard or a pistol in the shade.  I should never have believed in this constant terror on the part of a really brave man, if he had not confessed it to me with his own lips.  Ten or twelve years passed before he dared to make the slightest attempt to find his daughter, so much did he fear to arouse his enemy's attention.  It was not until he had discovered that the husband had become discouraged and had discontinued his search, that the count began his.  It was a long and arduous one, but at last it succeeded, thanks to the assistance of a clever scoundrel named Fortunat.\\\"\\n\\nThe baron with difficulty repressed a movement of eager curiosity, and remarked: \\\"What a peculiar name!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And his first name is Isidore.  Ah! he's a smooth-tongued scoundrel, a rascal of the most dangerous kind, who richly deserves to be in jail.  How it is that he is allowed to prosecute his dishonorable calling I can't understand; but it is none the less true that he does follow it, and without the slightest attempt at concealment, at an office he has on the Place de la Bourse.\\\"\\n\\nThis name and address were engraved upon the baron's memory, never to be effaced.\\n\\n\\\"However,\\\" resumed M. de Valorsay, \\\"the poor count was fated to have no peace.  The husband had scarcely ceased to torment him, he had scarcely begun to breathe freely, when the wife attacked him in her turn.  She must have been one of those vile and despicable women who make a man hate the entire sex.  Pretending that the count had turned her from the path of duty, and destroyed her life and happiness, she lost no opportunity of tormenting him.  She would not allow M. de Chalusse to keep the child with him, nor would she consent to his adopting the girl.  She declared it an act of imprudence, which would surely set her husband upon the track, sooner or later.  And when the count announced his intention of legally adopting the child, in spite of her protests, she declared that, rather than allow it, she would confess everything to her husband.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The count was a patient man,\\\" sneered the baron.\\n\\n\\\"Not so patient as you may suppose.  His submission was due to some secret cause which he never confided to me.  There must have been some great crime under all this.  In any case, the poor count found it impossible to escape this terrible woman.  He took refuge at Cannes; but she followed him.  He travelled through Italy, for I don't know how many months under an assumed name, but all in vain.  He was at last compelled to conceal his daughter in some provincial convent.  During the last few months of his life he obtained peace--that is to say, he bought it.  This lady's husband must either be very poor or exceedingly stingy; and as she was exceedingly fond of luxury, M. de Chalusse effected a compromise by giving her a large sum monthly, and also by paying her dress- maker's bills.\\\"\\n\\nThe baron sprang to his feet with a passionate exclamation.  \\\"The vile wretch!\\\" he said.\\n\\nBut he quickly reseated himself, and the exclamation astonished M. de Valorsay so little that he quietly concluded by saying: \\\"And this is the reason, baron, why my beloved Marguerite, the future Marquise de Valorsay, has no dowry.\\\"\\n\\nThe baron cast a look of positive anguish at the door of the smoking-room.  He had heard a slight movement there; and he trembled with fear lest Pascal, maddened with anger and jealousy, should rush in and throw himself upon the marquis.  Plainly enough, this perilous situation could not last much longer.  The baron's own powers of self-control and dissimulation were almost exhausted, and so postponing until another time the many questions he still wished to ask M. de Valorsay, he made haste to check these confidential disclosures.  \\\"Upon my word,\\\" he exclaimed, with a forced laugh, \\\"I was expecting something quite different.  This affair begins like a genuine romance, and ends, as everything ends nowadays, in money!\\\"\\n\\nIV.\\n\\nAs a millionaire and a gambler, Baron Trigault enjoyed all sorts of privileges.  He assumed the right to be brutal, ill-bred, cynical and bold; to be one of those persons who declare that folks must take them as they find them.  But his rudeness now was so thoroughly offensive that under any other circumstances the marquis would have resented it.  However, he had special reasons for preserving his temper, so he decided to laugh.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, these stories always end in the same way, baron,\\\" said he.  \\\"You haven't touched a card this morning, and I know your hands are itching.  Excuse me for making you waste precious time, as you say; but what you have just heard was only a necessary preface.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Only a preface?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes; but don't be discouraged.  I have arrived at the object of my visit now.\\\"\\n\\nAs Baron Trigault was supposed to enjoy an income of at least eight hundred thousand francs a year, he received in the course of a twelvemonth at least a million applications for money or help, and for this reason he had not an equal for detecting a coming appeal.  \\\"Good heavens!\\\" he thought, \\\"Valorsay is going to ask me for money.\\\" In fact, he felt certain that the marquis's pretended carelessness concealed real embarrassment, and that it was difficult for him to find the words he wanted.\\n\\n\\\"So I am about to marry,\\\" M. de Valorsay resumed--\\\"I wish to break off my former life, to turn over a new leaf.  And now the wedding gifts, the two fetes that I propose giving, the repairs at Valorsay, and the honeymoon with my wife--all these things will cost a nice little sum.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A nice little sum, indeed!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, well! as I'm not going to wed an heiress, I fear I shall run a trifle short.  The matter was worrying me a little, when I thought of you.  I said to myself: 'The baron, who always has money at his disposal, will no doubt let me have the use of five thousand louis for a year.'\\\"\\n\\nThe baron's eyes were fixed upon his companion's face.  \\\"Zounds!\\\" he exclaimed in a half-grieved, half-petulant tone; \\\"I haven't the amount!\\\"\\n\\nIt was not disappointment that showed itself on the marquis's face; it was absolute despair, quickly concealed.\\n\\nBut the baron had detected it; and he realized his applicant's urgent need.  He felt certain that M. de Valorsay was financially ruined--and yet, as it did not suit his plans to refuse, he hastily added: \\\"When I say I haven't that amount, I mean that I haven't got it on hand just at this moment.  But I shall have it within forty-eight hours; and if you are at home at this time on the day after to-morrow, I will send you one of my agents, who will arrange the matter with you.\\\"\\n\\nA moment before, the marquis had allowed his consternation to show itself; but this time he knew how to conceal the joy that filled his soul.  So it was in the most indifferent manner, as if the affair were one of trivial importance, that he thanked the baron for being so obliging.  Plainly enough, he now longed to make his escape, and indeed, after rattling off a few commonplace remarks.  he rose to his feet and took his leave, exclaiming: \\\"Till the day after to-morrow, then!\\\"\\n\\nThe baron sank into an arm-chair, completely overcome.  A martyr to a passion that was stronger than reason itself, the victim of a fatal love which he had not been able to drive from his heart, Baron Trigault had passed many terrible hours, but never had he been so completely crushed as at this moment when chance revealed the secret which he had vainly pursued for years.  The old wounds in his heart opened afresh, and his sufferings were poignant beyond description.  All his efforts to save this woman whom he at once loved and hated from the depths of degradation, had proved unavailing.  \\\"And she has extorted money from the Count de Chalusse,\\\" he thought; \\\"she sold him the right to adopt their own daughter.\\\" And so strange are the workings of the human heart, that this circumstance, trivial in comparison with many others, drove the unfortunate baron almost frantic with rage.  What did it avail him that he had become one of the richest men in Paris? He allowed his wife eight thousand francs a month, almost one hundred thousand francs a year, merely for her dresses and fancies.  Not a quarter-day passed, but what he paid her debts to a large amount, and in spite of all this, she had sunk so low as to extort money from a man who had once loved her.  \\\"What can she do with it all?\\\" muttered the baron, overcome with sorrow and indignation.  \\\"How can she succeed in spending the income of several millions?\\\"\\n\\nA name, the name of Ferdinand de Coralth, rose to his lips; but he did not pronounce it.  He saw Pascal emerging from the smoking- room; and though he had forgotten the young advocate's very existence, his appearance now restored him to a consciousness of reality.  \\\"Ah, well! M. Ferailleur?\\\" he said, like a man suddenly aroused from some terrible nightmare.  Pascal tried to make some reply, but he was unable to do so--such a flood of incoherent thoughts was seething and foaming in his brain.  \\\"Did you hear, M. de Valorsay?\\\" continued the baron.  \\\"Now we know, beyond the possibility of doubt, who Mademoiselle Marguerite's mother is.  What is to be done? What would you do in my place?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, monsieur! how can I tell?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Wouldn't your first thought be of vengeance! It is mine.  But upon whom can I wreak my vengeance? Upon the Count de Chalusse? He is dead.  Upon my wife? Yes, I might do so; but I lack the courage--Mademoiselle Marguerite remains.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But she is innocent, monsieur; she has never wronged you.\\\"\\n\\nThe baron did not seem to hear this exclamation.  \\\"And to make Mademoiselle Marguerite's life one long misery,\\\" said he, \\\"I need only favor her marriage with the marquis.  Ah, he would make her cruelly expiate the crime of her birth.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you won't do so!\\\" cried Pascal, in a transport, \\\"it would be shameful; I won't allow it.  Never, I swear before high Heaven! never, while I live, shall Valorsay marry Marguerite.  He may perhaps vanquish me in the coming struggle; he may lead her to the threshold of the church, but there he will find me--armed--and I will have justice--human justice in default of legal satisfaction.  And, afterward, the law may take its course!\\\"\\n\\nThe baron looked at him with deep emotion.  \\\"Ah, you know what it is to love!\\\" he exclaimed; and in a hollow voice, he added: \\\"and thus it was that I loved Marguerite's mother.\\\"\\n\\nThe breakfast-table had not been cleared, and a large decanter of water was still standing on it.  The baron poured out two large glasses, which he drained with feverish avidity, and then he began to walk aimlessly about the room.\\n\\nPascal held his peace.  It seemed to him that his own destiny was being decided in this man's mind, that his whole future depended upon the determination he arrived at.  A prisoner awaiting the verdict of the jury could not have suffered more intense anxiety.  At last, when a minute, which seemed a century, had elapsed, the baron paused.  \\\"Now as before, M. Ferailleur,\\\" he said, roughly, \\\"I'm for you and with you.  Give me your hand--that's right.  Honest people ought to protect and assist one another when scoundrels assail them.  We will reinstate you in public esteem, monsieur.  We will unmask Coralth, and we will crush Valorsay if we find that he is really the instigator of the infamous plot that ruined you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What, monsieur! Can you doubt it after your conversation with him?\\\"\\n\\nThe baron shook his head.  \\\"I've no doubt but what Valorsay is ruined financially,\\\" said he.  \\\"I am certain that my hundred thousand francs will be lost forever if I lend them to him.  I would be willing to swear that he bet against his own horse and prevented the animal from winning, as he is accused of doing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You must see, then--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Excuse me--all this does NOT explain the great discrepancy between your allegations and his story.  You assure me that he cares nothing whatever for Mademoiselle Marguerite; he pretends that he adores her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, monsieur, yes--the scoundrel dared to say so.  Ah! if I had not been deterred by a fear of losing my revenge!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I understand; but allow me to conclude.  According to you, Mademoiselle Marguerite possesses several millions.  According to him, she hasn't a penny of her own.  Which is right? I believe he is.  His desire to borrow a hundred thousand francs of me proves it; and, besides, he wouldn't have come this morning to tell me a falsehood, which would be discovered to-morrow.  Still, if he is telling the truth, it is impossible to explain the foul conspiracy you have suffered by.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1640139483,\"title\":\"\\nValorsay shrugged his shoulders with the air of a man who has made up his mind to accept the banter\"},\"digest\":\"qI9OP9yGxRbLhpTkUCKlUDcBmKT3gHcPt36duZYx93s\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6961235d2e95818F7a1E230634bC24de80Bd6f6a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NC8q73LxTHbmv6eaSQKbHhap62tkp-JM7EnmSWBjASw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1aUvaUfEwinKs6sbnEYRa52GowAsRJYUU8boac2v_DU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"yNvT6O-Iu4fyO0NaXkJBgz8aNNZAl1DYvnFA3PkEhddDeovhmX815dFC_vjZFrrjNcZ9TJsflvY_gdns8BVYzQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2d2225b153c22f66c167dbe5c0db09d8cd26f2da05a6ee5777265ff38e50d1065e4f44cd492d6a7d6b46704ae804e4f8f16c806bedc78103232d2678e63c8b531c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NC8q73LxTHbmv6eaSQKbHhap62tkp-JM7EnmSWBjASw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1aUvaUfEwinKs6sbnEYRa52GowAsRJYUU8boac2v_DU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"qI9OP9yGxRbLhpTkUCKlUDcBmKT3gHcPt36duZYx93s\"}"
