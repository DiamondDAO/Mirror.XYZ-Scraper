Quick example. I was one of the first people to join CityDAO. I'd seen a tweet by Scott Fitsimones. Scott's a nice guy, smart and hard working, but he's not superhuman. Following his tweet, he simply opened a Discord channel, and populated it with a few basic ideas. Almost immediately, like magic, a DAO materialized with the powers of a genie. More than a thousand people joined in no time and immediately began collaborating. Teams were set, governance began forming, outside partners were identified and engaged, the $WriteRace was won (on their first try), and real land was evaluated in preparation for acquisition in the future. All this before a token that could further align incentives was even distributed. These DAO collaborators were fueled by the joy of working on an interesting project for a good cause with others who share the mission, and the promise of future ownership of the outcome.\\n\\n[DAO’s to find missing people? $$ for your best ideas — Mirror](https://danconway.mirror.xyz/r6fadqo3KF_ndkllf0iJfbOVwmk-kXF4dH-C_z-moaQ)\\n\\n### 🔥\\n\\nDefinitely check out CommonLands by community member @rlamis!\\n\\n> Working to close the generational wealth gap through community-owned affordable, permanent housing using innovative tech.\\n\\n[CommonLands - Coming Soon](https://www.commonlands.us/)\\n\\np.s. will have some more updates on CommonLands in the future as they are up to some BIG things! 😉\\n\\n### 🔥\\n\\n@Phil Levin was a founding team member of Culdesac, whose ambition is to build a car-free city in the US.

Here are the posts so far:\\n\\n[Announcing CityDAO - a city built on Ethereum — Mirror](https://city.mirror.xyz/mZOpFWkTi0M2lVE1PsT1e2sJwdUT4PdgetHw_S4hS5A)\\n\\n[Become the First Citizen of CityDAO and name our first city parcel](https://city.mirror.xyz/CmZyzy3tuOu4TPUnfsYaR1Zoub1yiej6ZoOEuoayDQM)\\n\\n### 🔥\\n\\nSome recent tweets we love:\\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/m_j_rossman/status/1421629107117428749?s=20)\\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/SyndicateDAO/status/1422703077929361412?s=20)\\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/CityDao/status/1423365937353216000?s=20)\\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/NpappaG/status/1422323969718427650?s=20)\\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/thesidsridhar/status/1421157994197364736?s=20)\\n\\n***\\n\\n## Overheard in CityDAO\\n\\n> Viva la Wyoming\\n\\n> Vision of a DAO city is fascinating to me\\n\\n> So much innovation happening in portugal wow\\n\\n> Cause it’s crypto-tax free lol\\n\\n> Even with influencers, there should be a balance. The ape community is dragging the devs there on Twitter as we speak bc of the shift to hyper focusing on influencers rather than nurturing the current community.\\n\\n> Someone say BaconDAO?\\n\\n> imagining a parcel map like google maps with ENS addresses. so you can see who owns each and make requests to them. interesting concept for sure\\n\\n> the DAO has been officially incorporated\\n\\n> 🏡 Creator Cabins is here to support City DAO for $WRITE RACE\\n\\n> The possibilities are endless, and the stakes are extremely high\\n\\n> I’m new here and confirming I’m not a bot. My expertise is in building great financial products that users love. I think we can do that with CityDAO!\\n\\n> 3D printing houses in general is such an awesome concept/industry, esp. for creating affordable housing.  Also looks like they are primed for when CityDAO expands to the moon/Mars 🙃\\n\\n> I'm a former urban planner and now work on streamlining multifamily and condominium development\\n\\n> currently in law school, planning on working with daos + nfts + web3 once I graduate. Fascinated by this project!\\n\\n> Love the mission here, and excited to get involved!\\n\\n> Have just voted for our City! on fire 🔥\\n\\n> I much prefer modular homes to Tiny Homes and love this community being built near Austin\\n\\n> My 'day job' is creating intergenerational co-living communities, where older and younger people together and support each other.  Also a real estate investor of niche asset classes like co-living, co-working and government-leased properties.  I'm fascinated by the intersection of DeFi and Real Estate, particularly as a means to re-invent the way we value and underwrite real estate.\\n\\n> Hello folks. Fed here. I am interested in restoring \\\"true community\\\" to our lives.\\n\\n> I went down the NFT and DAO rabbit hole at the start of 2021 and I don’t want to come out. I’m currently a member of FingerPrintsDAO, SquiggleDAO amd Muse0. I joined this group as I’m really interested in how a DAO community can come together to impact the real world, particularly in land ownership models.\\n\\n> Love the Wyoming area - Love the concept of a DAO holding onto land - so I must love CityDAO! A bit about me: Work at a cryptocurrency exchange in the US. Helped co-found a charitable endowment platform/DAO on Terra.\\n\\n> BaconDAO is realeasing a member rewards system in the coming weeks to identify contributions through mee6 levels and significant contributions through recognition through team members\\n\\n> Imagine as a land owner receiving messages of offers to join a DAO to use adjacent parcels together (without revealing their personal contact information to the offerer), or a camper who wants to lease a spot next Wednesday for a week, or an owner of an adjacent parcel who wants explicit permission to walk across your parcel when accessing theirs (if that wasn't baked into the original parcel NFT head-lease.), or...\\n\\n> Wow, interesting points here about rural zoning and hostility\\n\\n> Nice community call!\\n\\n> Tell me why I live in austin and this is my first time hearing about this lol\\n\\n> WE'RE TOP 10! KEEP GOING!!!!!\\n\\n***\\n\\n### 🔊\\n\\nThanks to @Justin1066 who shared this awesome twitter thread re: insights on challenges of assembling land and purchasing as a group of people\\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/zachklein/status/1422293114480250880?s=20)\\n\\n### 🔊\\n\\nThanks to @R3sist who shared this interesting overview of Coordinape:\\n\\n[Decentralized payroll management for DAOs](https://medium.com/iearn/decentralized-payroll-management-for-daos-b2252160c543)\\n\\n\\n## Memes to go\\n\\nHere's a couple of gem-stone memes by @bpetes:\\n\\n![](https://chance.ghost.io/content/images/2021/08/image-6.png)\\n\\n![](https://chance.ghost.io/content/images/2021/08/image-7.png)\\n\\n![](https://chance.ghost.io/content/images/2021/08/image-8.png)\\n\\nThat's all for this roundup!\\n\\nSee y'all next time,\\n\\n\\\\-- Chance Taken\\n\\n![](https://chance.ghost.io/content/images/2021/08/image-5.png)\\n\",\"timestamp\":1628542837,\"title\":\"CityDAO July Community Roundup #2\",\"publication\":\"city\"},\"digest\":\"fSNKx70cya_yVAdOGCCTyKuoSATKEJvF4VdtsPjsxnw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x77aA943A365161e499eaFF59E936a799e6051e15\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eJsvqgco0TRptskPYj5TwzXO79ofDZNURiuNAhkYAEQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3AtPdRGEX9ouugKMnEq9KuN5lBBODfKCAHynPnS4Sfc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"x8MtPmMlFLOgd5-nS4IoAURGvl1zTO33Nmn2spw_A68Twr2IBnut7C_tY35-DHzSHrPiefqhL4VRuDO_qGIEKw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf59ddcbb164d40d50e8b4483e5193034ba4502f54dcaf6f3ae7f8b68c524ea69418b77bb693f80280e96ebf804b8181e7a1d81d2ecceb2f2f902e6fbcb7e22921c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on city.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eJsvqgco0TRptskPYj5TwzXO79ofDZNURiuNAhkYAEQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3AtPdRGEX9ouugKMnEq9KuN5lBBODfKCAHynPnS4Sfc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jTi0-xQOMadDgvP_KgMOoHZaYvWJY6D7YK4bcdFz-f4\"}"
