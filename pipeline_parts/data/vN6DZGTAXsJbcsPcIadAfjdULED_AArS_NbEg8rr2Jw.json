"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I had always been in on and off in the crypto since 2018. I got back more actively in 2020 when I saw some traction and has been actively learning since. In July 2021, I bought my first NFT, a Pudgy Penguin from a Instagrammer @heybentan. That generated my interest in exploring the NFT world and I started joining more discord groups to learn about crypto. That was when I was searching for more details about CyberKongz.

What I did not realised is that the domain name is Collabs.Land which came with an extra s.
