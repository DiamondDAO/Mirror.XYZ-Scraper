"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"One theme I want to see emerge in 2022 is the **rise of learn-to earn models**. We’ve seen play-to-earn come onto the scene last year with Axie Infinity and it was great to see how Web3 can help people that are economically vulnerable earn a new stream of income, without having to ask permission from anyone. X-to-earn models are based on compensating users in return for their usage, data and attention. Users and investors become one and the same, leading to a better incentive model.\\n\\nWhile I am a big fan of play-to-earn, one thing this model doesn’t enable is the ability for users to acquire new skills than can be used outside of the context of the game, in a direct manner. Becoming very good at Axie Infinity is not a transferable skill. The skills are captive.\\n\\nNow, what if users got paid to learn transferable skills, skills which helps them level up their careers, open new doors and combine multiple skills to become experts in emerging fields? As the world is changing increasingly fast, I wouldn’t be surprised for people to develop a new rhythm to their career cycles. I doubt people can just keep doing the same thing for very long when everything is changing around them  so quickly. What if the future workplace was best suited for 3-5 year work stints, followed by 1-year of learning and re-training? What if you could actually earn a living during that year, thanks to learn-to-earn? \\n\\nSwitching careers would incur a much reduced opportunity cost, and anyone willing to re-train would have the incentive to do so. More broadly, getting paid to learn would remove the trade off of many people: which is to go work at McDonald’s to make money in order to pay for school. Why not skip the work part and let people both learn and make money? It would free up the time for people to spend more time learning. Given that the internet has so much educational content already available, the main barriers standing in one’s way is self-motivation, discipline and time availability. \\n\\nLet’s imagine what that could actually look like for individuals. Let’s say I want to learn Solidity and become a blockchain developer for a Web3 app. I could access a Web3 learning platform, i.e a decentralized Udacity, where I can then purchase a membership (NFT) which grants me access to the course I selected. I could then then earn rewards \\n\\nI can access a web3 equivalent to Udacity, where I can purchase a NFT or token that grants me access to the course I selected. I then earn rewards in proportion to my level of usage. I complete a course? Reward, I help another student figure out a problem? Reward, I complete 5 courses? Reward. I create a course for users? Earn a share of the NFTs.Actually, I suspect the best learn-to-earn products will be disguised as play-to-earn games. \\n\\nCollectively, users own the learning platform. These users can transfer the money they made outside. They can do the same with skills, it will serve them over a long period of time on a whole bunch of various occasions. They more or less become the main character, such as Link in Zelda, who holds more hearts and has better gear as the journey progresses. They carry their intellectual assets with them everywhere they go.\\n\\nWe’re going through a shortage of skills and staff on a global scale. The access to economic opportunity is overwhelmingly  tied to where you live in the world. We’re seeing the great resignation unfold, where people feel disengaged with their current work. Add the need for better remote learning systems.\\n\\nAll of these global trends make me believe that the time for learn-to-earn has come. The model might well look like a hybrid between education and gaming, where users can transfer their new skills to help them build a better career.\",\"timestamp\":1641408895,\"title\":\"Learn-to-earn \"},\"digest\":\"HvqexYQWqWwum5ynrcbGkJajJruUFIUUtJq7UjA1x38\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x862f26238d773Fde4E29156f3Bb7CF58eA4cD1af\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"P4nBNYlI27sU1fyPXBFxXEeKOgctKoH3pFDkGs7jWJA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"SZKDe4uCRlx1_QniGoCltm1Lad9RVbQB3Gt_ynapYwI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"nQfGilAP4B0oLZ9yfraAeO3LCqAF_4MPuNGIUCOrrHch94o7RG5pcO19_SQ8JUxFi9OrpxBRtFGZ2fkCznlAtw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x68c945b26350c2d3ec8786cfa992e307e63a637ed75db74eead7c613fe8bce98701111e5992e62c7a5c2a77442ec8b2c6af0bd1ffbe7170331c6e1d281471d9c01\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"P4nBNYlI27sU1fyPXBFxXEeKOgctKoH3pFDkGs7jWJA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"SZKDe4uCRlx1_QniGoCltm1Lad9RVbQB3Gt_ynapYwI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jR2feSNXzOZhGGV1ln18fE-Vr3MhbxqAud89UZEvYog\"}"
