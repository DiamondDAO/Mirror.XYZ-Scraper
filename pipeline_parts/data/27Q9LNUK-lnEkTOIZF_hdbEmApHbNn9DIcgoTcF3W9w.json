"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"In this cycle, we will see that the crypto market is much more mature than in previous cycles. In those blockchain networks and protocols that perform well, the value narrative and fundamental elements will play a greater role. Therefore, it is becoming more and more important to be an active early user, so that you can experience each platform and really form a real understanding of which is better or worse. In addition, you will often receive rewards for actively participating in each network. Many airdrops in the past year have brought benefits ranging from 4-6 digits. Of course, it depends on personal contributions. For example, recall the UNI / 1INCH / dYdX airdrop. This year, we have seen that cryptocurrencies have been legalized (invested) by traditional financial institutions more than ever before, which has pushed a lot of funds into the cryptocurrency field. These investors, who were previously outside the crypto field, carefully select the investment targets and decide which long-term bets will be made. When these institutions allocate funds to crypto assets other than BTC, they need a process to evaluate the relevant crypto networks and determine which has the greatest advantage.\\nI think the underlying public chain will outperform all other altcoins this year. One of the reasons is because they are one of the easiest ways to bet on the decentralized future of smart contract systems. All decentralized applications (DApps) will run on these underlying blockchain networks. Compared to betting on these underlying networks, it is more difficult to find a needle in a haystack to screen individual lending agreements or decentralized exchanges (DEX). many. You might think that the overall expected future value of these networks is much higher than that of Bitcoin (BTC), which is mainly used as a store of value. From the perspective of technical analysis, in my opinion, the breakthrough of the multi-year interval with the ETH/BTC currency pair and the formation of a consistent dome chart is the main trend of this year, and the market is showing the future direction. This is the only cycle so far in which BTC has not hit a historical peak. Since ETH has outperformed BTC in the past year, other L1 networks, such as Solana, Avalanche, Terra (Luna), Fantom, and Harmony, have also performed much better than Ethereum. These networks are relatively new and have undergone fewer practical tests, but they are currently operating as faster and cheaper smart contract platforms. These platforms have gained a lot from hedge funds and other institutions and investors who bet on future success. funds. The founder of FTX, SBF, as Solana's consultant, led this trend. Because of his previous close ties with traditional financial circles, and his tremendous influence as the CEO of FTX / Alameda Research, his name has played an important role in influencing high-net-worth individuals + traditional funds. Most traditional financial companies generally held negative views on cryptocurrencies in 2017, but the current situation is very different. The list of PYTH partners clearly shows that public opinion has undergone an astonishing change. One of the most notable examples of traditional financial institutions (tradFi) entering cryptocurrencies is Jump Capital, which recently established its own independent crypto fund department. They even stated that they have been actively participating in PYTH and other blockchains (such as LUNA). ) Governance. It is likely that there are many other funds similar to Jump Capital, either waiting for the right opportunity to participate, or quietly rolling up their sleeves behind the scenes. Each L1 public chain has its own early investors and strong founders, who are committed to building their own ecosystem: AVAX has Emin + 3AC, Terra Luna has Do Kwon + Novo. I think we will continue to see new capital and new capable developers enter the crypto field in the next few years, and as the dollar capital and talent pool grow, we will see a platform composed of different smart contract platforms. Users will be able to choose freely from the thriving ecosystem.\\nWith this in mind, I think the base currency should be ETH, and transactions should focus on outperforming ETH. If you do anything on the chain (which should form the main part of your transaction), you need to use ETH as a starting point of reference. When buying NFTs, altcoins, and \\\"bridge\\\" assets, you should ensure that your performance outperforms holding ETH. Comparing the field of altcoins in 2021 with the field of altcoins in 2017 does not make much sense in my opinion, because the value at that time was very small compared to the present. In the past, you needed BTC to buy any alternative currency on any exchange, and the only DEX we used at the time was etherdelta. The current altcoin ecosystem is much more complicated than it was 4-5 years ago, which is why the ALT/ETH chart is more important than ALT/BTC in my opinion.\\nI personally believe that BTC is now the most important safe-haven asset in my portfolio, because I believe that as its scale grows and its market value gets closer to things like gold, its volatility will continue to show a downward trend. . At the same time, the institutions currently involved in investing in BTC are trying to accumulate BTC for a long time, and we will usher in a slow rise instead of the parabola like in 2017, which is in the best interests of the institution. Whenever retail derivatives traders encounter a liquidation frenzy, we will continue to see BTC market corrections. I still think of ETH and other currencies as a transaction, and when I want to reduce risk and profit from long positions, holding BTC can be the best choice for this part of my portfolio. BTC is also very suitable for measuring the degree of correction of the entire market, because it is the easiest crypto asset to be used as a hedge asset, and whenever BTC is sold, the selling frenzy of a large number of altcoins is even more fierce. As a hard currency, BTC has no competitors, so BTC will continue to grow with the growth of encrypted assets, even if it does not lead other cryptocurrencies in terms of innovation. You should always isolate the BTC stack from active trading stacks that you have never touched, and you can accumulate your favorite L1 currency for trading based on your personal risk preferences. These assets are relatively risky, because many Ethereum competitors have emerged in the past few years, but their influence has been severely weakened compared to four years ago, for example, TRON/DRGN/EOS. Due to the lasting influence of FTX / SBF / Alameda, I personally think Solana is the best choice after ETH, but I think this is just a subjective idea. The main concern for altcoins should be to examine the trend of its ALT/ETH currency pair. When trading altcoins in each L1 ecosystem, you should carefully study those ALT/L1 charts. For example, many SPL tokens in the Solana ecosystem have performed less than SOL throughout the year.\\nIn the next quarter, I expect this trend to continue, as these L1 smart contract platforms will narrow the gap with Ethereum in terms of the amount of funds locked in users and the network. At present, the market leaders in this type of L1 (SOL / AVAX / LUNA / FTM / ONE) have risen 5-10 times compared to the lows in July, and the market performance of ETH has fallen behind. In the short term, I think SOL has risen a bit too aggressively, while LUNA has recently fluctuated around its all-time high since earlier this year. It is expected that Solana will form a new consolidation band in this range, while other currencies will start to start new trends. If we do usher in the sideways consolidation of L1 altcoins for a period of time and ETH outperforms the broader market, I expect the developer activity/user activity/total lock-up (TVL) on the L1 altcoin network will continue to show an upward trend. If this situation comes to an abrupt end for any reason, I personally will re-evaluate the argument that these currencies will perform better in the medium and long term. In the existing L1, Terra Luna and ONE may have the strongest rise in the short term, and AVAX is the strongest Ethereum competitor based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\",\"timestamp\":1634228301,\"title\":\"Overall market and underlying public chain outlook\"},\"digest\":\"M1dBrWJL2GrCt2U6A3Yr4F5pKO0tsZYPLUimieZt6uc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7b0D60C4Fb47A942D3b625A1a6aF3f3d9d5F65D4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ib8Pb5JWirAN7zmE0DbhG0UFn_597bc5jpGhC5j0wH8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8kbvv4zYvgSFUEL4zEL1a2wU64pgef2sKLz7jaNzJwQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"-eYWKB-pz12SHAsN8y1aRlhqqFD1sWotv5QgYaQG7es0VrVRG82fNObaZcUZJEiB9poA5V-xz_US3vQkWifR-w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd25f281a6692cd2f0a677aff60d10fc94839978808c4b49c0a0cd25d6ba6135416ec7725c59af951ac0d40d9555a0f1d14988660043d83fec64134773bbeb7131b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ib8Pb5JWirAN7zmE0DbhG0UFn_597bc5jpGhC5j0wH8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8kbvv4zYvgSFUEL4zEL1a2wU64pgef2sKLz7jaNzJwQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"M1dBrWJL2GrCt2U6A3Yr4F5pKO0tsZYPLUimieZt6uc\"}"
