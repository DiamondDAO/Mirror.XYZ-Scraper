"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Welcome to my web3 blog, where everyday I will be journaling my learnings related to web3.\\n\\n## How I got into web3\\n\\nI got into crypto thanks to Loopring, a true layer 2 zkrollup ethereum scaling solution, after hearing about it from $GME, currently the main asset I’ve been holding in my portfolio for a year now. In short, GameStop is set to launch in early 2022 an NFT Marketplace that’s expected to have no gas fees thanks to Loopring’s layer 2 tech, and this marketplace may introduce millions of new people into crypto / NFTs. They’re already calling for creators to mint their projects on their platform at [nft.gamestop.com](https://nft.gamestop.com)\\n\\n## Buying my first NFT\\n\\nI first heard about NFTs in Feb. 2021, and thought to myself, “I should look deeper into this,” but everywhere I looked was intense hate towards NFTs, so I dismissed it. Once it was confirmed that GameStop was going to launch an NFT Marketplace, I decided it would be in my best interest to look deeper into the world of NFTs.\\n\\nI learn best by doing, so I decided to buy my first NFT in the early morning of Dec. 24. I’ll be honest, I didn’t do much research before aping into the first NFT project that looked promising. I ended up buying [More Than Gamers (MTG) #6702.](https://opensea.io/assets/0x49907029e80de1cbb3a46fd44247bf8ba8b5f12f/6702)\\n\\n![MTG #6702 on OpenSea](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uaHTfwuw7e7yYU-UTqLPj.png?height=3000&width=3000)\\n\\nI had bought it on the secondary NFT marketplace called Opensea, which is commonly referred to as closed sea because it is constantly crashing. When I had bought this NFT, all the NFTs in the MTG project were still un-revealed, so I didn’t know what it looked like until the metadata was revealed on Dec. 28 -- however, this reveal crashed Opensea and resulted in Opensea not revealing the art until much later.\\n\\nI bought this with no intention of flipping, or selling after the initial pump to make a quick profit, because I wanted to see what it’s like to participate in a project’s community.\\n\\nI’ll talk more about my learnings about MTG later, but I wanted to share two quick things:\\n\\n* The floor, or the lowest ask price on the secondary market, of NFT projects typically pump before reveal, and dump after the reveal. MTG for example pumped up to 0.75 ETH pre-reveal, and dumped to 0.32 after the reveal (the mint price of the project was 0.2ETH).\\n* If there’s no intention on flipping, the floor is not that important in the early stages of a project. The floor goes up when the community is high quality and strong (helping each other out, hanging out, etc,) because it will be more desirable to join that community by buying their NFT. But if a community only focuses on the floor price, that is a sign of a weak community and the floor is likely to fall further.\\n\\ngn\",\"timestamp\":1641185342,\"title\":\"gn 2/365 - introducing myself / starting my web3 journey\"},\"digest\":\"4oPgTdhrBRoN7DQRZu8ADJfC7NH-egEEgQS6ZZoHmXQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x590bDAb51CFb50ae675D957912a3647f2716F441\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"DRCc3-geIkETK7c437ievl6ETppgZaO7-r58b4-5Pmc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"EK6WphmToN4mc1joF1CJgs16ngotEwH3uDP61wC7I5s\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"zCeRvjrGJbJmyLjbnz3sQ5GuEyz1Y3n-4rSRCXOQptk8aMVd--ZeSZFAljUtMf1PZboNT8D_6i84amsNBDpX8g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd29face444bc54e55be2d31b0745b12f35e6a5e235578085983eed26b4f47b241f96449c60d67d50a26a4bdcaed3f4c8c516ac5f65b2fa48b601735839600d221c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"DRCc3-geIkETK7c437ievl6ETppgZaO7-r58b4-5Pmc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"EK6WphmToN4mc1joF1CJgs16ngotEwH3uDP61wC7I5s\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wSvYJ4fbP9KtbAAo47OVxBRIGf0oHRU80sLvOrDpseE\"}"
