Then they printed the SAME amount out of thin air just by hitting Ctrl-P for the past 2 years.\\n\\nYour overlords created a global emergency, locked you inside, and exaggerated danger at every opportunity for an excuse to speed up the money-printers to **>40% per year.**  \\n\\nIn other words, the buying power of your cash ‚Äì for any currency in the world ‚Äì will go down by 2x from this \\\\~50% dilution until you make them stop or find a way out‚Ä¶\\n\\n### Extrapolating\\n\\nYou see all that room I left in top right of the chart?\\n\\nThat‚Äôs so you can picture global money supply doubling AGAIN.  None of us actually know if the money-supply will:\\n\\n* course-correct violently (go negative),\\n* flatline (+0%)\\n* mean-revert to normal (+5-10%), \\n* slow down slightly (+20%),\\n* continue apace (+40%),\\n* or speed up (>50%) ‚Ä¶\\n\\nBut that‚Äôs actually the WHOLE POINT.

But over time homes are always taxed or taken, and bullion is always seized or stolen. Especially in woke territory, especially during a crisis, and especially in crumbling civilizations.\\n\\nSo what alternative are we left with?\\n\\nWe would need the same value, but a way to hide it.  Or in tech lingo, digitize and ***encrypt*** it.  So that‚Äôs what society did: create digital real estate + ***digital gold***, hide them from prying eyes with encryption technology, and ***iterate on the game-theory*** incentives until something stuck ...\\n\\nJust like church & state, money has traits both collective and individual ‚Äì \\n\\n* serving a Common Good, while allowing & protecting Private Possessions; \\n* optimized for storing, exchanging, & accounting ‚Äì belief, culture, and value.\\n* and probably more, to investigate another day.\\n\\n### Moral of the Story\\n\\nEverything has a half-life. üîªt=1/2\\n\\nIncluding your cash, money, wealth.\\n\\nSometimes it‚Äôs 10 years, sometimes it‚Äôs 2.\\n\\nIf your government or society is corrupt enough, it could be immediate.\\n\\nBut we‚Äôve now begun the separation of Money & State.\\n\\nAutomation, removing human-error & intervention.\\n\\nBuilding a better system for Money.\\n\\na True, Good, & Beautiful one.\\n\\nKeep working on it.\\n\\n‚Äì Sovereign ‚öîÔ∏è üîë\",\"timestamp\":1637284101,\"title\":\"Wealth üîª1/2 every 2 Years\"},\"digest\":\"bS5SlVZTUdVGytnD2JSOXlr9ya9m5JhadZkdF-OvchA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd98B36bC66bD4a5b8D15E41951aafDF328240953\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wnxZ4lEXSm-4TjzWBVIkF11zLUuMYOPqysi5atT_kuo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Yw44_GsPQ5U8-TFejyxwxZ8QMZ0P4z0X0mDgHtB9zRA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ouRYLCxuS9SynDoDHFkV5SmSn1vuyzpmR0TVsucZLOvubhoeSbaTOjzy8eh7mhdDQ5G16QEcde0LrY9o3wbFHg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x520d91a457c124c3060d04320150d0e75d13e259194d707bd24b6981e5af9661173ed2f1a2918bf67449838f983d1c2adab3cb6fa5d94f3d439ec2ad1dcad5261c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wnxZ4lEXSm-4TjzWBVIkF11zLUuMYOPqysi5atT_kuo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Yw44_GsPQ5U8-TFejyxwxZ8QMZ0P4z0X0mDgHtB9zRA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"bS5SlVZTUdVGytnD2JSOXlr9ya9m5JhadZkdF-OvchA\"}"
