In China, more than 10 million students study outside their hometowns.\\n\\nHe said that companies and institutes need to guide employees to take their vacations to avoid the peak period of the travel rush and arrange work schedules accordingly.\\n\\nFor the 2022 travel rush, most people leaving for their hometowns should provide proof of negative nucleic acid test results within 48 hours before departure.\\n\\nZhao said that local governments need to enhance nucleic acid testing capabilities by adding testing sites and improving efficiency, since testing supply fell short of demand in some cities last year.\\n\\nTransportation departments need to prevent overloading and set up quarantine areas in stations and carriages.\\n\\nThe number of people preferring to drive their own vehicles has significantly increased compared with pre-pandemic time. For highways where traffic jams extend more than 10 kilometers, local officials need to report this immediately and find a timely solution, Zhao said.\\n\\nHe Qinghua, an official of the National Health Commission, said at the conference that China is faced with greater pressure from imported COVID-19 cases from overseas.\\n\\n\\\"COVID-19 infection is still at a high prevalence globally. During the travel rush, overseas returnees will increase. And the 2022 Olympic Winter Games to be held in February will increase the risk of pandemic spread,\\\" he said.\\n\\nHe said ports should enhance efforts to prevent and control imported cases of the virus and detect the new Omicron variant. People from high-risk areas should not travel outside of the region if not necessary.\",\"timestamp\":1640963917,\"title\":\"Virus control measures ready for rush\"},\"digest\":\"zUJ-VBQFyAnf2fNbpArk_fEprzJ0U16tjhO-ToLYNO0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd1be21759BE7907cFA4Ea58198d5Bbc59A6D6b0C\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hbHGKd574MmzaOvXKC5n9-N1ZFsIrj54uMjcA1wkb-8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Md0yk_drNeAFBoy8ZFTbUmsgeINZUg_IwTKn_hYGVYY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"SRxzbulWebVnbAocef0HNQie3kB2fLac1_9aNXzAKV3Md0KGYzOy6Lvap2Jjon2pD_sn6zGm4fOmqAWi_rgOjw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5b83f588cb720df85fa01f7ab40bee68dbe154376ead9530ba2fc5690ab1c8e0559ca6410d2281ed45e7c0dd852f749e8e5e05e831bb17babb478bfa1fa4123f1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hbHGKd574MmzaOvXKC5n9-N1ZFsIrj54uMjcA1wkb-8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Md0yk_drNeAFBoy8ZFTbUmsgeINZUg_IwTKn_hYGVYY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"zUJ-VBQFyAnf2fNbpArk_fEprzJ0U16tjhO-ToLYNO0\"}"
