"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Published Nov 28, 2021**\\n\\nI realized that my Roth IRA balance can increase, without increasing in value.\\n\\nLet me explain.\\n\\nThere’s a difference between money printing and inflation.\\n\\nSome people assume that inflation comes from money printing. That’s true when all else is equal. But a decrease in demand is a deflationary force.\\n\\nMillions of boomers are retiring and consuming less. And the millennials replacing them are not making up the difference.\\n\\nThat will put downward pressure on CPI (consumption goods) throughout the 2020s and 2030s. And the US will keep printing money to make up for both the decrease in demand and labor force participation.\\n\\nOk, so what?\\n\\nThe money printing will not show up in CPI, as most expect. It’ll show up in asset prices, which are denominated in USD, which is falling.\\n\\nMy Roth IRA was full of index funds tracking traditional stocks and bonds.\\n\\nOver the next decade or so, those assets will continue to rise in price, not because they’re worth more relative to other assets, but because the US dollar is worth less.\\n\\nI liquidated it because I realized I wouldn’t be making money over time.\\n\\nI put the balance into digital assets and tech stocks that I believe will increase in **value** despite the debasement. Growth and innovation can outperform the Fed.\\n\\nSome traditional assets will preserve their value during the debasement, which is fine.\\n\\nBut anyone interested in building wealth for the future, in real terms, should migrate to Web3 as soon as possible.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nThese ideas are borrowed from [Robert Breedlove's interview of Raoul Pal on The \\\"What Is Money?\\\" Show](https://whatismoneypodcast.com/episodes/the-ultimate-macro-framework-with-raoul-pal-wim078).\",\"timestamp\":1638585380,\"title\":\"Why I liquidated my Roth IRA\"},\"digest\":\"B-H7ugFgMDHilf9H7BPsWxn3QYBrSfyUclY5puSd-H4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4923A3c2e28Dd97C122BF33979DD8dCA613Ab9E6\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RWh81d5MyG6KXa0EsAy5TSjK-KQVGjtdWaKwAvJz2Js\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KQ9CScIor0IxYU8nXrENA1gM-iLoWeAKZNr-pbn7W2E\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"uae_7iGP3HbH6QV6PvhmAyi4z9ncGlfTtLkN4nqMCAMe1i0VtVtPkDakz-wwK7JHH4rP5TpiV-Nmd7MrtNwVrA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x64936e3134093360f7e0086ee50e45cb3d9e979beff8ef5612b679f319c7041f588b246d53473c8144a9985a49c36adee833282b9f030e3ba74d7bb4356726cc1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RWh81d5MyG6KXa0EsAy5TSjK-KQVGjtdWaKwAvJz2Js\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KQ9CScIor0IxYU8nXrENA1gM-iLoWeAKZNr-pbn7W2E\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"zeGv_k4OBy9xpedyB6Q_1vBYmcS_TT-OFDCcp1GPIGo\"}"
