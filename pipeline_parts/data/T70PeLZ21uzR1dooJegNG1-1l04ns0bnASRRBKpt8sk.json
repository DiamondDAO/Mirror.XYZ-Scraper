As of June 9, WePiggy’s smart contracts have already been deployed to the Arbitrum mainnet.\\n\\n## Front-end Upgrading\\n\\nOver the next several weeks, the team will work on the front-end of WePiggy-Arbitrum, including cross-chain bridge entrance and wallet integrations.\\n\\n## Price Feed System Building\\n\\nWill follow the usual practice on other networks, give priority to using Chainlink’s price feed. At the same time, we have set up a warning system. Once a failure of the ChainLink oracle is found, it will automatically switch channels according to the priority.\\n\\nThe warning system will also feed back abnormal situations to the risk control team of the core development team so that the risk control team can make timely judgments based on changes in the market environment to minimize the loss of user assets in extreme environments.\\n\\n## On-chain Data Monitoring\\n\\nThe liquidity construction is the key point of the on-chain liquidation mechanism, will keep our eye on this part and bring the users with more markets and a better user experience.\\n\\n## About Arbitrum\\n\\nArbitrum is an L2 scaling solution for Ethereum, offering a unique combination of benefits:\\n\\n* Trustless security: security rooted in Ethereum, with any one party able to ensure correct Layer 2 results\\n* Compatibility with Ethereum: able to run unmodified EVM contracts and unmodified Ethereum transactions\\n* Scalability: moving contracts’ computation and storage off of the main Ethereum chain, allowing much higher throughput\\n* Minimum cost: designed and engineered to minimize the L1 gas footprint of the system, minimizing per-transaction cost.\\n\\nIt’s the first available and true Layer 2 solution of Ethereum, no other system offers the above combination of features at the same cost.\\n\\n## About WePiggy\\n\\nWePiggy is an open-source, non-custodial, crypto asset lending market protocol.
