"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"For anyone investing in bitcoin, or even just following it, 2020 has been a thrilling year. As recently as December, the price of bitcoin, the world's most valuable virtual currency, hit an all-time high of more than $24,000. Bitcoin could be more mainstream accepted in 2021, market analyst James Ledbetter predicted on Dec. 22, but it could remain volatile in the face of competition from big tech companies and digital currencies from central banks, as well as tougher regulation from the Biden administration.\\n\\nExperts predict five major trends for bitcoin in 2021\\n\\nBack in early March 2020, when the United States first began responding to the outbreak, bitcoin was trading at less than $4,000. As bitcoin has soared, investors have reaped handsome gains. To onlookers, it is a market show tinged with envy and vertigo.\\n\\nWhile bitcoin's price has been volatile -- generally on the rise -- 2020 is also a relatively mature year for a currency that has only been trading for 10 years. Market analyst James Ledbetter says he sees five key bitcoin trends for 2021 from his perspective as editor of a fintech newsletter:\\n\\n① More acceptable to the mainstream\\n\\nBitcoin has always had a chicken-and-egg problem in its everyday use: very few people use or accept it.\\n\\nBut in 2020, bitcoin's adaptability has changed dramatically. Prominent fintech companies have endorsed bitcoin, from Square's $50 million investment to PayPal, which allows users to buy and sell bitcoins.\\n\\nIn 2021, we may see greater mainstream acceptance of bitcoin. At least one major BANK in the United States or Europe will announce some kind of bitcoin purchase system or agree to hold bitcoin for clients.\\n\\n② Competition from big tech companies\\n\\nWhatever bitcoin achieves in its 10 years of existence, it has forced a number of large global entities to consider offering an international digital currency.\\n\\nEvery company involved in the payments space knows there is still room for growth in the digital payments market, with payments involving different currency markets having the greatest potential. That's because such deals currently take days to resolve and often involve high fees.\\n\\nBitcoin has shown that a global digital currency can greatly simplify this process, albeit in its infancy. In 2020, Facebook and Google -- two companies with a global reach that Bitcoin can only dream of -- both rolled out big plans for digital currencies.\\n\\nTech products like Facebook's Diem aren't exactly the same as bitcoin, but they could have an impact if they start to catch on in 2021.\\n\\n③ Competition from central bank digital currencies\\n\\nIn 2020, the Bank for International Settlements published a report and survey showing that 80 percent of the world's central banks were working on some form of digital currency.\\n\\nThere are already attempts by Asian countries to push forward with digital currencies, which could undermine demand for Bitcoin and other standalone cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nIn 2021, it is likely that other countries will try to advance digital currencies, which is not good news for Bitcoin.\\n\\n(4) A new regulatory arena\\n\\nThe Biden administration will have bigger priorities in its first 90 days than regulating cryptocurrencies. Of course, it is hard to read the attitude and expertise of Congress on this issue.\\n\\nIt is natural to assume that a Democratic administration would be more tightly regulated than a Republican one, but some assert that a Biden presidency would be \\\"good for cryptocurrencies\\\".\\n\\nThat may be true, but bitcoin enthusiasts tend to overlook issues such as anonymity and its potential fraudulent uses. These are very serious problems for regulators.\\n\\nBiden's team is likely to come up with a more comprehensive and rational approach to regulating cryptocurrencies, but James Ledbetter doesn't think they'll be particularly partial to bitcoin.\\n\\n⑤ The price of bitcoin will continue to fluctuate\\n\\nBecause bitcoin's value is not directly tied to any obvious real-world phenomenon, like fiscal or monetary policy,\\n\\nIt can rise or fall in ways that are hard to predict or even explain\\n\\n.\\n\\nAs an investment, this is hard to recommend to anyone hoping to avoid big losses. Some say bitcoin could cost as much as $50,000 in 2021, and while that seems extreme, it's not out of the question if investors move money from other assets into bitcoin.\\n\\nOf course, bitcoin prices are also likely to move in the opposite direction in 2021.\\n\\nOne thing seems certain: Bitcoin's wild ride will be repeated in 2020 -- so buckle up\",\"timestamp\":1635733134,\"title\":\"Experts predict five bitcoin
