Starting with BTC, she said:\\n\\n*“… I know that we just had a correction recently around November 19, 20, and that was predicted because of the lunar eclipse… I personally don't think we're over the top yet. , I don't think November to December will have a bearish trend. I see we'll bounce back from November 26 to 30, which is a pretty optimistic time. ”*\\n\\nHowever, Altman added that she  disagrees with PlanB’s prediction for Bitcoin to hit $98,000 by the end of November. She  said:\\n\\n*“Astrologically, I don't see us hitting 98k by the end of the year. I think 75, 80k is reasonable. I said 80 to 100k is the goal I think.* ”\\n\\nWhen it comes to Ethereum, however, Altman claims that Star Map for this cryptocurrency is almost the opposite of Bitcoin. Regarding Ether's price performance, she  said:\\n\\n*“…The year-end difficulties will be related to the retrograde of Venus as well as the appearance of Pluto directly on the moon of Ethereum.”*\\n\\nAltman said  that she saw a correction \\\"  more catastrophic  \\\" for Ethereum than Bitcoin – if the adjustment occurs.\\n\\n**Ethereum to the moon…literally**\\n\\nThe Trading View moon phase indicator is based on some traders' belief that a transition from a full moon to a new moon or vice versa can be correlated with bullish or bearish movements in a coin.\\n\\nNovember 19 – a full moon – and a few days later should have seen a bull run if this prediction were correct.\",\"timestamp\":1638431565,\"title\":\"Astrologer predicts future crypto market\"},\"digest\":\"u4ei_tg4KJDXz5Wk4YRehOF2Udk13if35TOzLdm7qL0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xEa62F678b154eC48A794d4d5D16e1353De605176\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"gJVQyLmeubVw0sWxFZX4SenCnugesfX7M8jfbvSsT7E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"V3NG-014GtBGeUoeDide5Gknfm-H_u3cmqFRgzpTgGk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"6HI4IFeD9YtOwOZCjcArv0_Tu394wf-0fuehnI4jdcMrw9gQRpxnGvpB2m9JjKtJro4oxltlUvlawqtWWJ394A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xba45eddbba531f9c185e57d45ca53eec1ddd125b6a47cc4e9306127f1479e1871a6312a0fbaa6d126586ec9d4c911ae1747d8e72a75887ea7e55862b24922ac21b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"gJVQyLmeubVw0sWxFZX4SenCnugesfX7M8jfbvSsT7E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"V3NG-014GtBGeUoeDide5Gknfm-H_u3cmqFRgzpTgGk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"u4ei_tg4KJDXz5Wk4YRehOF2Udk13if35TOzLdm7qL0\"}"
