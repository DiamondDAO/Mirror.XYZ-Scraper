"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Claude Debussy**, in full **Achille-Claude Debussy**, (born [August](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/August) 22, 1862, [Saint-Germain-en-Laye](https://www.britannica.com/place/Saint-Germain-en-Laye), France—died March 25, 1918, Paris), French composer whose works were a [seminal](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/seminal) force in the [music](https://www.britannica.com/art/music) of the 20th century. He developed a highly original system of harmony and musical structure that expressed in many respects the ideals to which the [Impressionist](https://www.britannica.com/art/Impressionism-music) and [Symbolist](https://www.britannica.com/art/Symbolism-literary-and-artistic-movement) painters and writers of his time aspired. His major works include *Clair de lune* (“Moonlight,” in *Suite bergamasque*, 1890–1905), *Prélude à l’après-midi d’un faune* (1894; *Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun*), the opera *Pelléas et Mélisande* (1902), and *La Mer* (1905; “The Sea”).\\n\\n## Early period\\n\\nDebussy showed a gift as a pianist by the age of nine. He was encouraged by Madame Mauté de Fleurville, who was associated with the Polish composer [Frédéric Chopin](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Frederic-Chopin), and in 1873 he entered the Paris Conservatory, where he studied the piano and [composition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/composition), eventually winning in 1884 the [Grand Prix de Rome](https://www.britannica.com/art/Prix-de-Rome) with his [cantata](https://www.britannica.com/art/cantata-music) *L’Enfant prodigue* (*The Prodigal Child*).\\n\\nDebussy’s youth was spent in circumstances of great turbulence. He was almost overwhelmed by situations of great extremes, both material and emotional. While living with his parents in a poverty-stricken suburb of [Paris](https://www.britannica.com/place/Paris), he unexpectedly came under the patronage of a Russian millionairess, [Nadezhda Filaretovna von Meck](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nadezhda-Filaretovna-von-Meck), who engaged him to play duets with her and her children. He traveled with her to her palatial residences throughout Europe during the long summer vacations at the Conservatory. In Paris during this time he fell in love with a singer, Blanche Vasnier, the beautiful young wife of an architect; she inspired many of his early works. It is clear that he was torn by influences from many directions; these stormy years, however, contributed to the sensitivity of his early style.\\n\\nThis early style is well illustrated in one of Debussy’s best-known [compositions](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/compositions), *[Clair de lune](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Clair-de-lune-by-Debussy)*. The title refers to a folk [song](https://www.britannica.com/art/song) that was the conventional accompaniment of scenes of the lovesick Pierrot in the French pantomime, and indeed the many Pierrot-like associations in Debussy’s later music, notably in the orchestral work *Images* (1912) and the *Sonata for Cello and Piano* (1915; originally titled *Pierrot fâché avec la lune* \\\\[“Pierrot Vexed by the Moon”\\\\]), show his connections with the circus spirit that also appeared in works by other composers, notably the [ballet](https://www.britannica.com/art/ballet) *Petrushka* (1911) by [Igor Stravinsky](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Igor-Stravinsky) and *Pierrot Lunaire* by [Arnold Schoenberg](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Arnold-Schoenberg).\",\"timestamp\":1637008182,\"title\":\"Let's know about Debussy\"},\"digest\":\"Tj7Vc_xS4IvVdVm-cd33y7e4vLdxDTH7LUP8QPXs69E\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x13BdD13534Dcec07a2E7B862a126D2F09D04A094\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Z8zUrBEdficZiD7UpANEHBsWmdviLCvLTsFvUJ6FUO8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KADdZY4m4M1xJKrjp_UI_AkF6xVLnOI7OIPTZ5rnQ0A\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"f2chHZEQamNrMV_tdiNeNJ3pCDbXVHxoh5uRt_UdEta8WLQZKV5eJK80DXVwczVcOGARNfURJ-ingC9ovRat4w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5aa98da35445da9f533b413c2e62231af1eb2e997d9abb2cb9878b8b66e7c06f1b113bb4371b03454d55601c47aa6fb58138b2a7fdc92a867dcf3efdb745735f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Z8zUrBEdficZiD7UpANEHBsWmdviLCvLTsFvUJ6FUO8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KADdZY4m4M1xJKrjp_UI_AkF6xVLnOI7OIPTZ5rnQ0A\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Tj7Vc_xS4IvVdVm-cd33y7e4vLdxDTH7LUP8QPXs69E\"}"
