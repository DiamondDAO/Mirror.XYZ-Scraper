"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"But we must part,\\\" said the young man; \\\"your brother does not\\n\\nlike our engagement, and therefore he sends me so far away on\\n\\nbusiness, over mountains and seas. Farewell, my sweet bride; for so\\n\\nyou are to me.\\\"\\n\\n```\\nAnd then they kissed each other, and the girl wept, and gave him a\\n```\\n\\nrose; but before she did so, she pressed a kiss upon it so fervently\\n\\nthat the flower opened. Then the little elf flew in, and leaned his\\n\\nhead on the delicate, fragrant walls. Here he could plainly hear\\n\\nthem say, \\\"Farewell, farewell;\\\" and he felt that the rose had been\\n\\nplaced on the young man's breast. Oh, how his heart did beat! The\\n\\nlittle elf could not go to sleep, it thumped so loudly. The young\\n\\nman took it out as he walked through the dark wood alone, and kissed\\n\\nthe flower so often and so violently, that the little elf was almost\\n\\ncrushed. He could feel through the leaf how hot the lips of the\\n\\nyoung man were, and the rose had opened, as if from the heat of the\\n\\nnoonday sun.\\n\\n```\\nThere came another man, who looked gloomy and wicked. He was the\\n```\\n\\nwicked brother of the beautiful maiden. He drew out a sharp knife, and\\n\\nwhile the other was kissing the rose, the wicked man stabbed him to\\n\\ndeath; then he cut off his head, and buried it with the body in the\\n\\nsoft earth under the linden-tree.\\n\\n```\\n\\\"Now he is gone, and will soon be forgotten,\\\" thought the wicked\\n```\\n\\nbrother; \\\"he will never come back again. He was going on a long\\n\\njourney over mountains and seas; it is easy for a man to lose his life\\n\\nin such a journey. My sister will suppose he is dead; for he cannot\\n\\ncome back, and she will not dare to question me about him.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1636531355,\"title\":\"But we must part\"},\"digest\":\"OZZebZOUjVTHhwPL5ZjSp948lU0K-u12M1mIR0HHgr4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8918151a07B96D518Ab70C61e4091FfA62e25A17\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tGXb0_gY0JSZktdQSvSXTNC67TyW8O-2ngQKjv-6Qak\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wEqfIoFrn-f-Y_64FC3M1RZzCdocCF2jVCEwFVWy0tY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"fLfVQkNA_rsTNX0EmIMCiVuGpsxcKqT9E1McU8IwhFaxO31ng_pDcNN0nazQkMp2mwKXSQKn1dwXBvcz3VGeIQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1d0070b3d71460522c9fef6c88b79f7074cfae0e0c715cda41e6999a0d02a29b705fd62c19372523f43bbe911bd30f899c0a56dfaaf5bbac2c28b1ba4e1878171c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tGXb0_gY0JSZktdQSvSXTNC67TyW8O-2ngQKjv-6Qak\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wEqfIoFrn-f-Y_64FC3M1RZzCdocCF2jVCEwFVWy0tY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"OZZebZOUjVTHhwPL5ZjSp948lU0K-u12M1mIR0HHgr4\"}"
