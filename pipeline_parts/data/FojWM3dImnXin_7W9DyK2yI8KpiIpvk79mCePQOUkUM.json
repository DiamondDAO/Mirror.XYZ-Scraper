This growth has a lot to do with the appreciation of Ether, Ethereum’s token, which is the blockchain that houses close to 70% of all DeFi protocols.\\n\\nThese enormous growth did not come without a price tag. “Gas fees” **the transaction fees that users pay to miners on a blockchain protocol to have their transaction included in the block** have skyrocketed as the volume of transactions increased.\\n\\nGas can **get expensive when the Ethereum network is experiencing a high volume of transactions**. For each new block added to the Ethereum blockchain, there is limited space for how many transactions can be included. Due to supply and demand, miners are incentivized to accept transactions at [higher gas fees](https://etherscan.io/gastracker), creating a bidding war that discriminates against small trade.\\n\\n![Gas Fees to supply.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3a%2f%2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2fpublic%2fimages%2f74d13fd0-397f-424f-958e-33a7041b8b7c_2070x1110.png)\\n\\nIn the picture above, we can see that to swap tokens, users have to pay up to $161 dollars in gas fees. **This does not make it very accessible to those who want to swap or stake small amounts.** The graph below shows how gas prices have gone through the roof during the past months.\\n\\n![Gas Price in Gwei (Since Aug 2015)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3a%2f%2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2fpublic%2fimages%2f7aa95c7c-e76b-4045-a9e5-3b62633b80ea_1456x1008.png)\\n\\nA few days ago, Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, released a document named the “End Game” in which he describes a [plausible roadmap](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html) for the blockchain and **outlines the things that would make a ‘big blockchain’ completely trustless and censorship-resistant.** It basically encapsulates the promises of Etherum 2.0.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, the objetive of this second version of the Ethereum network, is to migrate from the present proof of work (POF) consensus to a proof of stake (POF) which will allow the protocol to increase the number of transactions per second, while lowering gas fees. Easier said than done, and we have been patiently waiting for this Ethereum-scaling solutions.\\n\\n***Are there any Options?***\\n\\n* Blockchains like **[Polygon (MATIC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/)** seems to be thriving thanks to Ethereum's scalability issues and extremely high gas fees, but it has been inundated with security concerns,[ rising gas fees with increased traffic (not as high as ETH), and poor marketing amidst Ethereum's enormous popularity.](https://blockster.com/blockdesk/1954_with-eth-gas-fees-so-high-why-isn-039-t-polygon-breaking-out)\\n* Another major player in the space is **[Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/),** which aims to conduct faster transactions with lower fees than Ethereum. Its token has more than double in price during the past three months with the idea that will take some of ETH market, but it’s not easy to compete with the reputation, prominence and capabilities of the largest blockchain available.\\n\\nThera many other chains in the space and many other potential protocols ready to take the crown away from Ethereum, while promising to solve the issues of scalability, gas fees, and security. But we are yet to see if they are able to do it prior to the Ethereum 2.0 launch.\\n\\n> **In the mean time, it seems that DeFi it’s for the wealthy.**\\n\\n[Subscribe now](https://yarocelis.substack.com/subscribe?utm_medium=web&utm_source=subscribe-widget&utm_content=45599018)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 👀 Under the Radar\\n\\n* [Wrapped Bitcoin](http://wbtc.network/) (WBTC) - Tokenized version of [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC) that runs on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain.
