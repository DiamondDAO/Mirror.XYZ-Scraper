The goal is to prepare a document that will go over a breadth of topics from blockchain, to bitcoin and ethereum, DeFi, NFTs, DAOs and a lot more so someone can get up to speed within a few hours.\\n\\nWhat if we added some cool animation around that to make the material easier to digest?\\n\\nIs this the first real project coming out of KaramelaDAO? Stay tuned for more!\\n\\n## 2/ Governance / Citizenship / Logistics\\n\\nIn the recent community call of Dec 15th we had our first brainstorm of how to approach the marketing aspect of our DAO. There was some talk about using part of our citizenship NFTs for marketing purposes, e.g. press releases, articles etc so we can get the word out! At the end of the day there is nothing more exciting than more people knowing about the awesome things that are happening within KaramelaDAO! \\n\\nMore publicity, means more citizens, more engagement within and outside the community and a fairer and more exciting DAO!\\n\\nFinally, there have been lots of interesting conversations around voting and funding of projects in this early stage. How do we have a fair voting mechanism when we don’t have the NFTs yet? How do we decide who gets a bounty work citizenship? How do we pay for the work done within the DAO by potential citizens or total outsiders?\\n\\nClearly, this is a complex problem and lots of interesting solutions have been proposed like issuing our own sweet coin **$CGUM (chewing-gum)** and potentially tying the value to the treasury and make it exchangeable for citizenship NFTs, or allowing the market decide the value of the coin or some combination of the above.\\n\\nBut we kind of need an imperfect solution to move forward, at least on the voting side, which leads us to….\\n\\n## 3/ KaramelaDAO’s first official proposal\\n\\njonromero put the first proposal up this week to facilitate project voting until the DAO has a big and lively community!\\n\\n`“Giving temporary voting rights to POAP holders`\\n\\n`I propose to give voting rights to anyone that has a POAP from our community calls until we have at least 100 Citizens.`\\n\\n`Citizens (holders of our NFT) will also be able to vote and their vote will count as 5 votes.`\\n\\n`After we have 100 Citizens, POAP holders won't be able to vote”`\\n\\nThe proposal is up and 6 people have already voted. So don’t forget to vote [here](https://snapshot.org/#/karameladao.eth/proposal/0xf24de40fb826cd2955676c479465b27d265247551d794522270900fb47b0ee1e).\\n\\nHow can you vote? **It’s simple, you need to have attended at least one of the previous four community calls and have claimed your Proof of Attendance (POAP)!** \\n\\nThe voting ends on Dec 22nd, 2021!\\n\\n**This means that going forward you need to attend the community calls and claim your POAP in order to be able to vote on the KaramelaDAO proposals!** \\n\\n**So don’t forget to claim those POAPs!**\\n\\n## 4/ Heard on the Sweet Sweet DAO\\n\\nThis week Fation gave a quick reading list for people who want to learn more about blockchain, DAOs, governance and tokenomics!\\n\\n* [TokenEconomyBook](https://github.com/sherminvo/TokenEconomyBook/wiki)\\n* Bitcoin Billionaires - Mezrich\\n* Mastering Bitcoin - Antonopoulos \\n* The Bitcoin Standard - Ammous \\n* Token Economy, How the web3 reinvents the internet - Voshmgir \\n* The Fiat Standard - Ammous \\n* DeFi and the future of finance - Harvey, Ramachandran, Santoro\\n\\n  ## 6/ KaramelaDAO So Far\\n\\n*First, let’s do a quick recap of the KaramelaDAO adventure so far:*\\n\\nMonth 1: November - laying the groundwork\\n\\n* November 1     - DAOs Discord is ON\\n* November  2    - KaramelaDAO starts (Jon’s infamous tweet)\\n* November  17 - First Community call\\n* November  18  - First Governance call\\n* \\n\\nMonth 2: December - more groundwork\\n\\n* December 1 - Second Community call\\n* December 2 - Second Governance call\\n* December 3 - We finally have a logo!!\\n* December 8 - Third Community call -  New name, who dis?
