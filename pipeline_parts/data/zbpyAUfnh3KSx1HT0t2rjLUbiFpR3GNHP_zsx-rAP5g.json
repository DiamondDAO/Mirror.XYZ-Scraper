Bring the sense of reality to any digital realm. The most important thing is that we can bring our humanity and choose We want to experience the way of this world.\\\"\\n\\n> The meta universe is here. It not only changes the way we view the world, but also the way we participate in the world-from the factory floor to the meeting room.\\n>\\n> \\\\-Satya Nadella (@satyanadella) November 2, 2021\\n\\nThe update of Microsoft Teams is called \\\"Mesh\\\", and it will be launched for the first time in 2022, providing users with personalized digital avatars and immersive spaces to meet in the meta-universe, \\\"can be accessed from any device, no special equipment is required\\\" .\\n\\nIn the later stages of Mesh development, organizations will also be able to create custom spaces to support environments such as meetings or \\\"social gatherings\\\".\\n\\n![Mesh update: Microsoft](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Rk46ZLqoM_74MFQPvcz4w.png?height=485&width=940)\\n\\nMicrosoft’s new product, Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces, will be previewed for the first time in December 2021, and it will enable organizations to combine meta-universe and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with their businesses. The company said that in the so-called \\\"mixed work environment\\\", Spaces can be used to use data observed by cameras \\\"from retail stores to factory floors.\\\"\\n\\nVishal Sood, General Manager of Connected Spaces, wrote in a blog post on November 2: Perspective.\\\"\\n\\n> \\\"After deployment, you only need to turn on the artificial intelligence-driven model, the so-called skills, to help understand specific scenarios, such as customer behavior during promotional presentations, business models, and unique insights into your space.\\\"\\n\\nIn an interview with Bloomberg TV on November 3, Nadella also said that Microsoft's electronic gaming company Xbox \\\"absolutely\\\" will be committed to integrating Metaverse into its game product line. However, the CEO was tight-lipped and did not provide any specific updates on the gaming sector.\\n\\n\\\"You can expect us to make a difference in the game field,\\\" Nadella said, adding:\\n\\n> \\\"If you think of \\\"Halo\\\" as a game, then it is a meta-universe. \\\"Minecraft\\\" is a meta-universe, and so is \\\"Flight Simulator.\\\" In a sense, they are now 2D. The problem is Can you bring it to a fully 3D world now, we definitely plan to do so.\\\"\\n\\nMicrosoft is not the only mainstream giant to launch the meta-universe project this week. Cointelegraph reported earlier today that Nike has submitted a trademark application for the iconic logo and slogan of the \\\"online virtual world.\\\" The company also recently released two recruitment notices for virtual material designers.\\n\\nNike stated that the new employees will \\\"play a key role in redefining our digital world and leading us into the meta-universe.\\\"\\n\\nAs we all know, the social media giant Facebook is entering the meta universe and is renamed Meta. The company is committed to providing creators with a platform to develop virtual online businesses, connecting online experiences with the real world, and launching a \\\"Reality Labs\\\" Virtual reality hardware business.\\n\\nOn October 29, in an interview with the CNBC program Squawk Box, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian commented on Facebook's plan, calling it a \\\"magic move and distraction\\\" from the problems that plagued the company.\\n\\nAlthough Ohanian pointed out that Meta should not be \\\"undervalued,\\\" he emphasized that there is enough organic movement in the crypto space to create an open meta-universe, rather than being controlled by social media giants:\\n\\n> \\\"There is now a bottom-up movement to create the meta-universe. We have seen what is happening in the crypto community... We see that many people are building a more organic world that I think and hope will become, rather than A top-down world imposed by Facebook.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1639398320,\"title\":\"Microsoft enters the meta-universe with Teams update and Xbox update\"},\"digest\":\"t1weCe_v1--Cz5H-nZTAJcHEZxrCQE6WpHOsV2kb9Vo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x66B915a0854a127eD183Bfc8b4eF98B3DEb539C6\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FWOHgkkLZtVTdG11ISKFrfBNlz85CbUCJSvmBYPw3kU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TyUIstWcJWW42ujN474mmBSW0QMOhfRvZQtELwdxqR0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"lipGqi337YELacwksHiWVnBtKha8Ws8Zx_s5VIFNoc_Evv-04-2VqNgDffwdzemeacUm4FVMfZc5jitiobX_LQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa9c5d3f0eb5597bd8b26f0ce3dd4db0dc23030e8648f37d8beb55b51784b258c6bde2c9f09c221b680c36ce4f2eff4482b25af3b30df37adea0336fd331c831e1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FWOHgkkLZtVTdG11ISKFrfBNlz85CbUCJSvmBYPw3kU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TyUIstWcJWW42ujN474mmBSW0QMOhfRvZQtELwdxqR0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"t1weCe_v1--Cz5H-nZTAJcHEZxrCQE6WpHOsV2kb9Vo\"}"
