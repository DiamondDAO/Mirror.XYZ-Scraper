I used to be in the same situation and feel guilty of not reading enough. After all, how could I even find time with 2 kids, day time job, multiple side projects, list goes on...\\n\\nThen this happened:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/oykun/status/1196430204081725441?s=20](https://twitter.com/oykun/status/1196430204081725441?s=20)\\n\\nYes it is an old tweet and it proves the effectiveness as it still stands.\\n\\nWe think that we need to spare a big chunk of time during the day to read.

Kindle or physical.\\n* Pick up your book instead of your phone when you have a moment\\n\\n> Once you start using these bits of time to read, you will naturally want to create time for reading as you fall back in love with reading and want to finish that page, section, then the whole book.\",\"timestamp\":1637616345,\"title\":\"How I read more books\"},\"digest\":\"kTs3q-VXP2MZG-xkU-21VdtGV55Qoiz5Iea6y-mfYA8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5feb4d00Ee1b890571Ae9732E0c08cBB2d4699DC\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"noZARfjoBCdmJwtLF-ZD34u7bhwRfQ0ZeNwhFkxpS5U\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"nIr_4W3e7FHAuc7tEBqNm9WUI55OtiGKPLeGjS8VULY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Yg4Asb6hqGTBHG476HtLiZWJWiGFi-Wsob3YinbHNlDOWnRpAN9rgBk95TPGxMJxmD1a76dbG6DqjFJ35ku-Jw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2bad2a0bf55c15c6730d7efec89a1f146c3abc615f1c971d5312404103d48a963eadbcb8b0605c8136bbb1bf1d520fa6ad8881bdd0a271ab9ca89f92bf1f99611c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"noZARfjoBCdmJwtLF-ZD34u7bhwRfQ0ZeNwhFkxpS5U\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"nIr_4W3e7FHAuc7tEBqNm9WUI55OtiGKPLeGjS8VULY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"kTs3q-VXP2MZG-xkU-21VdtGV55Qoiz5Iea6y-mfYA8\"}"
