"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"This provebr came to my mind yesterday, when watching news. You can find it also in The Bible (Hosea 8:7): \\\"For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind...\\\" and the meaning can be simplified t: “If you behave badly, it will come back to you.”\\n\\nThe news on the Czech Republic over the past few weeks had been the illness of our Mr. president, Milos Zeman. I sincerely hope that he will get better, but what reminded me the proverb had been what is happening in public.\\n\\nWhen our first Czech president, Vaclav Havel, fell seriously ill, it had been the number one story for media outlets (and for the public). And while there are always controversial media trying to take advantage, mostly you would feel sympathy and and people hoping that he will get better.\\n\\nWhere Vaclav Havel had been a person trying to unite people, Milos Zeman is a very controversial person. Not only due to his manners and actions, but also with his team selection, which keep media busy since he had been elected to the office. And once he fell ill and was admitted to the hospital, you cannot help but feel that his team is not being fully honest with public - latest controversy being that while hospital informed his chancellor that Mr. president cannot fulfil his duties due to his current health issues, he did not inform public or state officials, and it had to be communicated through senate, which requested the information at the hospital.\\n\\nAnd thanks to to all this you cannot help but feel more like watching a political satire of presidential office, than a good management, both from procedural and PR point od view.\\n\\nI hope our president will recover and resume his duty soon, but hopefully this will serve as a learning for our state officials in all positions: behave with good manners, be kind and work to unite people. The other approach might get you political points in the short term, but in the long run it sets you for failure - be it in your career, or your legacy.\\n\\nThe good thing is that it is that it is never too late to remedy yourself. That is, if one listens and acts.\",\"timestamp\":1634714003,\"title\":\"Who seeds wind, shall harvest storm\"},\"digest\":\"dBaL7gAqQ1kCp9_5KJps-ZBH8biq2SITmk_1sBzas4U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7075ca44F16B453610681823b167FfE692dd1AB2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HRkXSv0jHFTGIAdoznDxoTxNtyNiEkrJyFqWSay3q30\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"SXUZ5xlzSJlcyuoq1jZYKG1Ucb1PIA7SyDBoNpYLrCA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"agdySNnYUCAqRmR-k85oXo-jhTdYIj5XaWLcWwmGjC8d69Vx2SPmM9QOccxbbKB9_dDDdVnaR2E5_qaXokeOuQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x79307ffc897a1494bafb7f7d588882e9011c8c59758ddfb248c58129422d3bfa036886ea4f0786ed887ef9ebac0f719293b66c4525c94a21170dc93398dfff131b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HRkXSv0jHFTGIAdoznDxoTxNtyNiEkrJyFqWSay3q30\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"SXUZ5xlzSJlcyuoq1jZYKG1Ucb1PIA7SyDBoNpYLrCA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"dBaL7gAqQ1kCp9_5KJps-ZBH8biq2SITmk_1sBzas4U\"}"
