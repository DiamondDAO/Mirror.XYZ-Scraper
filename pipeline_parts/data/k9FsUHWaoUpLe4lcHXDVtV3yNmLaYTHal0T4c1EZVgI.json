"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"You are praising me at your own expense,\\\" said Zoe. \\\"Well, then,\\\" said she, sweetly, \\\"please accept my sympathy. It is so rare to find a gentleman of your age thinking so little of himself and so much of poor people. Yet that is a Divine command. But somehow we forget our religion out of church--most of us. I am sure I do, for one.\\\"\\n\\nThis conversation brought them to the village, and there they met Vizard, and Zoe repeated old Sally's discourse to him word for word. He shook his head solemnly, and said he shared her misgivings. \\\"We have caught a Tartar.\\\"\\n\\nOn arriving at Vizard Court, they found Miss Gale had called and left two cards.\\n\\nOpen rivalry having now commenced between Uxmoor and Severne, his lordship was adroit enough to contrive that the drag should be in request next day.\\n\\nThen Severne got Fanny to convey a note to Zoe, imploring her to open her bedroom window and say good-night to him the last. \\\"For,\\\" said he, \\\"I have no coach and four, and I am very unhappy.\\\"\\n\\nThis and his staying sullenly at home spoiled Zoe's ride, and she was cool to Uxmoor, and spoiled his drive.\\n\\nAt night Zoe peeped through the curtain and saw Severne standing in the moonlight. She drank him in for some time in silence, then softly opened her window and looked out. He took a step nearer.\\n\\nShe said, very softly and tenderly, \\\"You are very naughty, and very foolish. Go to bed _di-_rectly.\\\" And she closed her window with a valiant slam; then sat down and sighed.\\n\\nSame game next day. Uxmoor driving, Zoe wonderfully polite, but chill, because he was separating her and Severne. At night, Severne on the wet grass, and Zoe remonstrating severely, but not sincerely, and closing the window peremptorily she would have liked to keep open half the night.\\n\\nIt has often been remarked that great things arise out of small things, and sometimes, when in full motion, depend on small things. History offers brilliant examples upon its large stage. Fiction has imitated history in *un verre d'eau* and other compositions. To these examples, real or feigned, I am now about to add one; and the curious reader may, if he thinks it worth while, note the various ramifications at home and abroad of a seemingly trivial incident.\\n\\nThey were all seated at luncheon, when a servant came in with a salver, and said, \\\"A gentleman to see you, sir.\\\" He presented his salver with a card upon it. Severne clutched the card, and jumped up, reddening.\\n\\n\\\"Show him in here,\\\" said the hospitable Vizard.\\n\\n\\\"No, no,\\\" cried Severne, rather nervously; \\\"it is my lawyer on a little private business.\\\"\\n\\nVizard told the servant to show the visitor into the library, and take in the Madeira and some biscuits.\\n\\n\\\"It is about a lease,\\\" said Ned Severne, and went out rather hurriedly.\\n\\n\\\"La!\\\" said Fanny, \\\"what a curious name--Poikilus. And what does S. I. mean, I wonder?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This is enigmatical discourse,\\\" said Vizard, dryly. \\\"Please explain.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, the card had Poikilus on it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are very inquisitive,\\\" said Zoe, coloring.\\n\\n\\\"No more than my neighbors. But the man put his salver right between our noses, and how could I help seeing Poikilus in large letters, and S. I. in little ones up in the corner?\\\"\\n\\nSaid Vizard, \\\"The female eye is naturally swift. She couldn't help seeing all that in *half a minute of time;* for Ned Severne snatched up the card with vast expedition.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I saw that too,\\\" said Fanny, defiantly.\\n\\nUxmoor put in his word. \\\"Poikilus! That is a name one sees in the papers.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course you do. He is one of the humbugs of the day. Pretends to find things out; advertises mysterious disappearances; offers a magnificent reward--with perfect safety, because he has invented the lost girl's features and dress, and her disappearance into the bargain; and I hold with the schoolmen that she who does not exist cannot disappear. Poikilus, a puffing detective. S. I., Secret Inquiry. *I* spell Enquiry with an E--but Poikilus is a man of the day. What the deuce can Ned Severne want of him? I suppose I ought not to object. I have established a female detective at Hillstoke. So Ned sets one up at Islip. I shall make my own secret arrangements. If Poikilus settles here, he will be drawn through the horse-pond by small-minded rustics once a week.\\\"\\n\\nWhile he was going on like this, Zoe felt uncomfortable, and almost irritated by his volubility, and it was a relief to her when Severne returned. He had confided a most delicate case to the detective, given him written instructions, and stipulated for his leaving the house without a word to any one, and, indeed, seen him off--all in seven minutes. Yet he returned to our party cool as a cucumber, to throw dust in everybody's eyes.\\n\\n\\\"I must apologize for this intrusion,\\\" he said to Vizard; \\\"but my lawyer wanted to consult me about the lease of one of my farms, and, finding himself in the neighborhood, he called instead of writing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your lawyer, eh?\\\" said Vizard, slyly. \\\"What is your lawyer's name?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Jackson,\\\" said Ned, without a moment's hesitation.\\n\\nFanny giggled in her own despite.\\n\\nInstead of stopping here, Severne must go on; it was his unlucky day.\\n\\n\\\"Not quite a gentleman, you know, or I would have inflicted his society on you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not quite--eh?\\\" said Harrington, so dryly that Fanny Dover burst into a fit of uncontrollable laughter.\\n\\nBut Zoe turned hot and cold to see him blundering thus, and telling lie upon lie.\\n\\nSeverne saw there was something wrong, and buried his nose in pigeon pie. He devoured it with an excellent appetite, while every eye rested on him; Zoe's with shame and misery, Uxmoor's with open contempt, Vizard's with good humored satire.\\n\\nThe situation became intolerable to Zoe Vizard. Indignant and deeply shocked herself, she still could not bear to see him the butt of others' ridicule and contempt. She rose haughtily and marched to the door. He raised his head for a moment as she went out. She turned, and their eyes met. She gave him such a glance of pity and disdain as suspended the meat upon his fork, and froze him into comprehending that something very serious indeed had happened.\\n\\nHe resolved to learn from Fanny what it was, and act accordingly. But Zoe's maid came in and whispered Fanny. She went out, and neither of the young ladies was seen till dinner-time. It was conveyed to Uxmoor that there would be no excursion of any kind this afternoon; and therefore he took his hat, and went off to pay a visit. He called on Rhoda Gale. She was at home. He intended merely to offer her his respects, and to side with her generally against these foolish rustics; but she was pleased with him for coming, and made herself so agreeable that he spent the whole afternoon comparing notes with her upon village life, and the amelioration it was capable of. Each could give the other valuable ideas; and he said he hoped she would visit his part of the country ere long; she would find many defects, but also a great desire to amend them.\\n\\nThis flattered her, naturally; and she began to take an interest in him. That interest soon took the form of curiosity. She must know whether he was seriously courting Zoe Vizard or not. The natural reserve of a well-bred man withstood this at first; but that armor could not resist for two mortal hours such a daughter of Eve as this, with her insidious questions, her artful statements, her cat-like retreats and cat-like returns. She learned--though he did not see how far he had committed himself--that he admired Zoe Vizard and would marry her to-morrow if she would have him; his hesitation to ask her, because he had a rival, whose power he could not exactly measure; but a formidable and permitted rival.\\n\\nThey parted almost friends; and Rhoda settled quietly in her mind he should have Zoe Vizard, since he was so fond of her.\\n\\nHere again it was Severne's unlucky day, and Uxmoor's lucky. To carry this same day to a close, Severne tried more than once to get near Zoe and ask if he had offended her, and in what. But no opportunity occurred. So then he sat and gazed at her, and looked unhappy. She saw, and was not unmoved, but would not do more than glance at him. He resigned himself to wait till night.\\n\\nNight came. He went on the grass. There was a light in Zoe's room. It was eleven o'clock. He waited, shivering, till twelve. Then the light was put out; but no window opened. There was a moon; and her windows glared black on him, dark and bright as the eyes she now averted from him. He was in disgrace.\\n\\nThe present incident I have recorded did not end here; and I must now follow Poikilus on his mission to Homburg; and if the reader has a sense of justice, methinks he will not complain of the journey, for see how long I have neglected the noblest figure in this story, and the most to be pitied. To desert her longer would be too unjust, and derange entirely the balance of this complicated story.\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII.\\n\\nA CRUEL mental stroke, like a heavy blow upon the body, sometimes benumbs and sickens at first, but does not torture; yet that is to follow.\\n\\nIt was so with Ina Klosking. The day she just missed Edward Severne, and he seemed to melt away from her very grasp into the wide world again, she could drag herself to the theater and sing angelically, with a dull and aching heart. But next day her heart entered on sharper suffering. She was irritated, exasperated; chained to the theater, to Homburg, yet wild to follow Severne to England without delay. She told Ashmead she must and would go. He opposed it stoutly, and gave good reasons. She could not break faith with the management. England was a large place. They had, as yet, no clew but a name. By waiting, the clew would come. The sure course was to give publicity in England to her winnings, and so draw Severne to her. But for once she was too excited to listen to reason. She was tempest-tossed. \\\"I will go--I will go,\\\" she repeated, as she walked the room wildly, and flung her arms aloft with reckless abandon, and yet with a terrible majesty, an instinctive grace, and all the poetry of a great soul wronged and driven wild.\\n\\nShe overpowered Ashmead and drove him to the director. He went most unwillingly; but once there, was true to her, and begged off the engagement eagerly. The director refused this plump. Then Ashmead, still true to his commission, offered him (most reluctantly) a considerable sum down to annul the contract, and backed this with a quiet hint that she would certainly fall ill if refused. The director knew by experience what this meant, and how easily these ladies can command the human body to death's door *pro re nata,* and how readily a doctor's certificate can be had to say or swear that the great creature cannot sing or act without peril to life, though really both these arts are grand medicines, and far less likely to injure the *bona fide* sick than are the certifying doctor's draughts and drugs. The director knew all this; but he was furious at the disappointment threatened him. \\\"No,\\\" said he; \\\"this is always the way; a poor devil of a manager is never to have a success. It is treacherous, it is ungrateful: I'll close. You tell her if she is determined to cut all our throats and kick her own good fortune down, she can; but, by ----, I'll make her smart for it! Mind, now; she closes the theater and pays the expenses, if she plays me false.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But if she is ill?\\\"\\n\\n[ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/88](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/88)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637670276,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"Indeed I do,\\\" said Zoe, \\\"and I honor you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, Miss Vizard,\\\" said Uxmoor, \\\"that is more than I can ever deserve.\\\"\\n\"},\"digest\":\"bKUcWvgv7MzCeI5gO6WxlalRxsIcBHdOQ4MYbkNyRHI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x755Bda80E984cd5fAabcbf90e065196EEDb3214A\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Fi41pK2LVUTaRgK11WtHtdpAfe52Tb2_-tZmjoaywgY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gLmw7B4I6Rt8g6STzvIEF4Ze_jFnnGWWzRRsOU3PtyU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"-XfWAwqXIq2UyijCC3t4ybMCKWNVHTAyLJ7aaGoxR02ymdZPd8lOCevEtyh9AIdH5XPAqQfGLUt0mz8piaMMFA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2ce3e88b0607f5750fbf032cb3a892aee9d043a2b063546001e4f0c5933854695bff5bc5297400ed46f658bf56b20654aefd524dda1a9fb037d26d95724c17a81c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Fi41pK2LVUTaRgK11WtHtdpAfe52Tb2_-tZmjoaywgY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gLmw7B4I6Rt8g6STzvIEF4Ze_jFnnGWWzRRsOU3PtyU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"bKUcWvgv7MzCeI5gO6WxlalRxsIcBHdOQ4MYbkNyRHI\"}"
