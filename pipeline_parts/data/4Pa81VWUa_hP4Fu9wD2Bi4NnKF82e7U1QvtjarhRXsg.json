We wanted to take filmmaking into the future and bring everyone.*\\n>\\n> *The result? **[FilmmakerDAO](http://filmmakerdao.com/)** (formerly [MidsummerDAO](https://docs.midsummer.party/)).*\\n\\nWe're at an exciting place in history, and nowhere is that more evident than in the arts. Using the community-focused advent of DAOs, **FilmmakerDAO** is set to build a unique space for film and web3 for the new era. And that starts with community, first and foremost.\\n\\nInstead of gatekeeping, you'll find trust. Instead of old ideas, you'll find a passionate group of like-minded cinephiles, eager to create something together.\\n\\nWe aim to dive into this space with an eagerness to be heard and to make space for creativity. We've all been struggling to find our people, so we thought we'd make a place for them instead.\\n\\n> *\\\"Poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.\\\" -John Keating, Dead Poets Society*\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🎥 FilmmakerDAO is the DAO for filmmakers and film enthusiasts\\n\\n![filmmakerdao.com](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VcQ1lEhGZoAM60d7f3F8t.png?height=1344&width=2618)\\n\\n```\\nThe future of organizations is decentralized community-owned\\ncollectives, and this is what FilmmakerDAO is about.\\n```\\n\\nTechnically speaking, **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations** (DAOs) are a new revolutionary crypto-native type of organization that yields **governance, payment, liquidity, funding, and incorporation** on cryptonetworks through smart contracts.\\n\\n```\\nSmart contracts are deterministic and immutable computer\\nprograms stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined\\nconditions are met.\\n```\\n\\nDAOs are essentially token-gated online communities. They enable many forms of fundraising for projects, community-led decision-making, transparent capital flow, and governance.\\n\\n```\\nAt FilmmakerDAO, we coordinated efforts from filmmakers,\\ntechnologists, and art lovers who believe in the power of film.\\n```\\n\\nWe believe filmmakers should have more ownership of their careers, and more sovereignty over the IP they create.\\n\\nWe recognize that the current landscape of distribution options does not provide commensurate upside for the storytellers and artists whose work populates these platforms.\\n\\nWe seek to become a diverse and open community from a broad spectrum of backgrounds and specialties unified and aligned in the vision to build more equitable distribution strategies for the filmmaking industry.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 😔 The film industry needs help\\n\\nThe storytelling/film industry is still facing a **cold start problem** and *\\\"𝘸𝘩𝘰 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘬𝘯𝘰𝘸*\\\" is an outdated model for our generation:\\n\\n1. Film **storytellers** and **screenwriters** have a hard time getting produced if they don't have prior work to showcase.\\n2. Film **producers** have a hard time getting funded if they haven't delivered a project before.\\n3. Film **curators** have a hard time finding compelling stories and don't have agency over what gets produced.\\n\\n```\\nHow can we fix this problem?\\n```\\n\\n*(more about the problem storytelling is facing: [bt3gl’s talk at LisCon 2021](https://vimeo.com/638007916))*\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## ⛓ A new paradigm brought by blockchain technologies\\n\\nIn the 90s, web1 was about open protocols that were decentralized and community-governed. We had static websites, low bandwidth, and limited hardware. Most of the value accrued to **builders+users.**\\n\\nIn the 2020s, web2 was about **centralized services run by a handful of corporations**. Social networking, AI/ML, SaaS, and the gig economy take place.\\n\\nThe web3 era is now starting, **combining the community-governed and fractionalization character from web1 with the modern functionalities of web2 through cyrptonetworks (blockchains).**\\n\\n**Cryptonetworks** are state machines that are instantiated with a genesis state and have very strict rules (*consensus*) that define how that state can transit. **No single entity controls this decentralized state machine — it is collectively maintained by everyone in the network**.\\n\\nOur generation is creating an entirely new digital universe. Ownership and governance are becoming decentralized by design, and control is being shifted to communities. **Builders+users own pieces of services with digital tokens, both *non-fungible* and *fungible***. Tokens provide property rights, governance, and ownership. We now own our own destiny.\\n\\n```\\nFilmmakerDAO is a web3 community-owned economy for \\nfilmmakers and film curators.\\n```\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 🚀 Why Blockchain\\n\\nBillions of images, videos, songs, and status updates are uploaded to centralized platforms every day. **In the traditional client-server architecture, servers are closed systems owned by a particular company**.\\n\\nThe internet (i.e., *the* *cloud*) is a collection of these closed systems interacting. The traditional client-server model delivers great scalability and faster iteration, but it relies on a monopolistic behavior with centralized control and single points of failure.\\n\\n![Web2 model](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AdpMVFtZ1WJPdYcs54pfy.png?height=640&width=785)\\n\\n**Web3 architecture is decentralized by design**: blockchains are peer-to-peer networks. **Blockchain trade technical scalability for social scalability.** In this new paradigm, validators are incentivized to keep the network impartial. There is no single point of failure, and each client node owns its data.\\n\\n![Web3 model.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zVSKGKQKyHkL0Tc3YSQJE.png?height=760&width=1080)\\n\\n```\\nBlockchains enable public access and private ownership \\nof any digital media file.\\n```\\n\\n### Why fungible (interchangeable) tokens\\n\\nIn the Ethereum network, *money* is represented by the ERC20 standard. They are blockchain-based primitives that can **hold value and be sent and received**. [They are simply computer code (](https://future.a16z.com/a-taxonomy-of-tokens-distinctions-with-a-difference/)*smart contracts)* [living on these global peer-to-peer network](https://future.a16z.com/a-taxonomy-of-tokens-distinctions-with-a-difference/)s. Smart contracts determine the token's total supply, how the supply is circulated, the issuance schedule, among other properties.\\n\\nFungible tokens can be used for several functions: crowdfunding, voting rights, representation of physical objects, among others.\\n\\nFor instance, *equity tokens* are fungible tokens that represent ownership in an asset or a pool of assets. These tokens are used to incentivize participants to provide a scarce resource to a network. On the other hand, *governance tokens* represent percentage ownership over voting rights.\\n\\n```\\n$REEL is FilmmakerDAO's governance ERC20 token, designed \\nto be fair, flexible, and transparent.\\n```\\n\\n### Why non-fungible (unique) tokens\\n\\nIn the web2 model, when data is uploaded to a company's centralized platform, it's kept in its backend. The ownership is transferred to the company. **Web2 platforms monetize on the content and maintain most of the value.** Purchasing a film from a web2 centralized platform does not grant ownership.\\n\\nNFTs or non-fungible tokens are also files that live on a blockchain and they are suitable for collectibles, rewards, and digital ownership. They can be designed to **enable artists to monetize and own the value of their work,** and receive royalties that are baked into the metadata.\\n\\nAn NFT can represent any kind of digital item, whether it's an image, a video, a document, an IRL event. Rather than a content license, the content itself is purchased.\\n\\n```\\nNFTs authenticity and scarcity can be confirmed via \\nblockchain technology.\\n```\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/developer_dao/status/1471937026408816642?s=20](https://twitter.com/developer_dao/status/1471937026408816642?s=20)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 👯‍♂️ Community first\\n\\n> *Think of a beautiful garden- it's a beautiful sanctuary, brimming with flowers and trees, in a small town and beloved by everyone. People pour their hearts and souls into tending to the garden, proud of their work and collaboration. They start to think of sharing it with the world, because it tells the story of their town and all they've been through. Only the town realizes it costs too much money to drive out of towners to the garden, house them, monitor the lights and sway of people. Too much money to go around telling people about it, getting the appropriate licenses. Even with the right license, there are so many other sites people want to go that the people start to give up. They start to think tourism is so saturated, no one will care about their lovely little garden. It's a lovely garden and everyone believes in its story, but in the end, they can't find a way to pull everything together. What do they do? How do they come together to share their story?*\\n\\nThat is what **FilmmakerDAO** is all about.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/crystaladalyn/status/1472038226462326784?s=20](https://twitter.com/crystaladalyn/status/1472038226462326784?s=20)\\n\\nHelping filmmakers share their gardens. Time has moved very fast, but over the course of a few months, we've documented our ethos, goals, and mission and welcomed in a ton of new community members.\\n\\n```\\n💡 Community building takes time, and our Discord is at \\nthe heart of it. \\n\\nIt's a nuanced, nascent process that requires cultivation. \\n\\nStill, we have aimed to keep this cost accessible to you, \\nin order to ensure a welcome atmosphere.\\n```\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 📽️ Humans of Web3, the first FilmmakerDAO Production\\n\\nThe first production by a decentralized collective is here!\\n\\nWe are happy to announce that we will be starting the pre-production of series **[Humans of Web 3](https://twitter.com/humansofweb3)** in 2022! One of the goal of this project is to reveal the human side of web3 and inspire the next wave of talent.\\n\\nWe are very fortunate to have secured some of the filmmaking industry’s most talented people to help us deliver this project:\\n\\n### Mary Ann Marino\\n\\n*Former Head of Production at Amazon Studios and Tim Burton Productions and Executive Producer at Park Pictures, Mary Ann Marino has been involved in some of the most imaginative and memorable films (Manchester By The Sea, James, and the Giant Peach, My Own Private Idaho) and among the most award-winning advertising campaigns in recent history (VW’s The Force, Apple’s Misunderstood).*\\n\\n*In the past decade, her work has won Oscars, Emmys, and Cannes Lions. Skilled at balancing unique creative visions and commercial appetites, Mary Ann has over 25 years of experience in entertainment.*\\n\\n*She’s currently developing The Caretaker, written by Andres Heinz, for Studiocanal, and in post-production on Oorlagh George’s  Sundance-Lab supported feature, Stranger With A Camera.*\\n\\n### Alex Kondracke\\n\\n*Alexandra Martínez Kondracke is an award-winning writer/director/producer who studied at Dartmouth College and NYU Graduate Film school.*\\n\\n*Alex worked as a writer on several high-profile feature projects, including an unannounced Star Wars trilogy, an upcoming Star Trek film from J.J. Abrams, and multiple Disney feature films. Most recently, Alex directed a 3D animated short called Pocket Portals in collaboration with Epic Games, using their Unreal Engine.*\\n\\n*Other notable projects include an adaptation of Gregory Maguire’s novel Wicked for Amazon Studios and co-creating Annapurna Films’ first television project, The Players, for Epix. Alex was also a writer/producer on Showtime’s The L Word and HBO’s Hung, and directed the musical feature Girltrash: All Night Long. Alex co-founded The Latinx House, which launched at Sundance 2020, and co-founded Poderistas, a Latina lifestyle platform, with America Ferrara and Eva Longoria.*\\n\\n*Early in her career, Alex’s short film Ice Fishing won a jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival, and she worked as a cinematographer for documentaries and TV shows on the BBC, Bravo, VH-1, TLC, Discovery, A&E, and National Geographic.*\\n\\n*Alex is currently developing several TV pilots for Warner Brothers.*\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/ChadHugghins/status/1458326637439750145?s=20](https://twitter.com/ChadHugghins/status/1458326637439750145?s=20)\\n\\nMary Ann and Alex will also be joining the FilmmakerDAO as industry advisors.\\n\\n```\\nWith our growing community, we seek to wrangle up passionate \\nand talented veterans of film, newcomers, and audiences alike, \\nto take film into the future.\\n```\\n\\n**Stay tuned for more details soon!**\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🗳 FilmmakerDAO Governance ERC20 Token, $REEL\\n\\n**$REEL** is FilmmakerDAO’s illiquid governance and rewarding token, deployed on Ethereum and bridged on Polygon.
