This is not what this guide is about.\\n\\nThis guide is about a new way to scoop up crypto for a (possibly hefty) discount to its current market price.\\n\\n**two**\\n\\n[@TeamKujira](https://twitter.com/TeamKujira)'s [#Orca](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Orca?src=hashtag_click) Protocol allows users to snipe crypto for cheaper prices when borrowers get liquidated.  \\n  \\n This means you could buy [$ETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&src=cashtag_click) or [$LUNA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LUNA&src=cashtag_click) for 10% less than its trading price. \\n  \\n Maybe even 20% cheaper. Or 30%.\\n\\nHere's how it works..\\n\\n**there**\\n\\nI've posted before about how you can earn up to 20% interest on your stablecoins using \\n\\n[@anchor_protocol](https://twitter.com/anchor_protocol): [https://twitter.com/shivsakhuja/status/1467550237036187650?s=20…](https://twitter.com/shivsakhuja/status/1467550237036187650?s=20) The interest you're earning on Anchor Protocol comes from borrowers.\\n\\n**four**\\n\\n[@anchor_protocol](https://twitter.com/anchor_protocol) requires users to deposit an asset like [$bETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24bETH&src=cashtag_click) or [$bLUNA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24bLUNA&src=cashtag_click) as collateral in order to borrow against it. \\n  \\n In order to borrow $60 of [$UST](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24UST&src=cashtag_click), you need to deposit $100 or more of collateral. \\n  \\n Your Loan-To-Value or LTV ratio here is $60/$100 = 60%\\n\\n**five**\\n\\n[@anchor_protocol](https://twitter.com/anchor_protocol) requires borrowers to have an LTV ratio <= 60%. \\n  \\n This means that borrowing the maximum amount allowed ($60 [$UST](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24UST&src=cashtag_click) with $100 bETH collateral) is very risky because the value of [$ETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&src=cashtag_click) could fall, and put your collateral at risk.\\n\\n**six**\\n\\nLet’s say you borrow $60 [$UST](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24UST&src=cashtag_click) using $100 [$bETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24bETH&src=cashtag_click) as collateral. \\n  \\n [$ETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&src=cashtag_click) falls 20%. You now have $80 of [$bETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24bETH&src=cashtag_click) collateral but $60 of borrowed [$UST](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24UST&src=cashtag_click). So your LTV now rises to $60/$80 = 75%. \\n  \\n Anchor is not comfortable with this level of collateral, so the loan is deemed at risk.\\n\\n**seven**\\n\\nAnchor is now looking to liquidate the collateral and repay the loan. So they need to find buyers for the [$bETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24bETH&src=cashtag_click) collateral. 🐳 \\n  \\n The buyer of the collateral needs an incentive as well (otherwise he / she could simply buy [$ETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&src=cashtag_click) from the spot market).\\n\\n**eight**\\n\\nSo Anchor is willing to sell it at a discount to the market value. The size of the discount depends on what people are willing to pay. \\n  \\n This is where Kujira [#Orca](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Orca?src=hashtag_click) comes in. \\n  \\n On Kujira, you can place \\\"bids\\\" to buy the collateral ($bETH or [$bLUNA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24bLUNA&src=cashtag_click)) for a discount of 0-30%.\\n\\n**nine**\\n\\nCollateral will be sold at the lowest discount (0%) first, then going all the way up to 30% till all the necessary collateral has been liquidated. \\n  \\n When you buy this collateral, you can then use [@terraswap_io](https://twitter.com/terraswap_io) to immediately exchange it for [$UST](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24UST&src=cashtag_click) or [$LUNA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LUNA&src=cashtag_click) for a higher price.\\n\\n**ten**\\n\\nThis graph on Kujira shows how many people have placed bids at different discount levels. \\n  \\n As you can see, most people have placed bids around the 10-12% level for [$bETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24bETH&src=cashtag_click). \\n  \\n Those bids will only be filled AFTER the ones on the left (0-10%) are filled.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YUkEoGso5PPCNqrsldi19.png?height=323&width=900)\\n\\n**eleven**\\n\\nThe more people that use Kujira Orca, the smaller the opportunity to get discounted assets is likely to be. Currently the pool size (total amount of people looking to buy discounted assets) is only \\\\~1% of the total collateral anchor has.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xNAMG-7EIVei2e4Dyb1N8.png?height=456&width=1442)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oLL8aAyTuY58gD5oV9h-W.png?height=454&width=1472)\\n\\n**twelve**\\n\\nLiquidations are likely when the asset prices fall, or when borrowers have high LTV. This is why you should be very conservative when borrowing using crypto as collateral. With high-volatility assets, chances of liquidation are quite high if your LTV is high.\\n\\n**thirteen**\\n\\nIf you want to snipe some cheap crypto on Kujira, here are the steps:\\n\\n1. Get $UST onto Terra Station wallet\\n2. Go to <http://orca.kujira.app/market/bETH>\\n3. Select your desired discount (they call it \\\"premium\\\")\\n4. Choose amount and place bid\\n5. After 10 mins, you can activate the bid\\n\\n**fourteen**\\n\\nTo activate the bids, scroll down to the section that says \\\"My Bids\\\", and click activate. I'm not sure why this step is necessary. You can also cancel the bids from this section.\\n\\n**fifteen**\\n\\nHere are some resources for further reading if you're interested.
