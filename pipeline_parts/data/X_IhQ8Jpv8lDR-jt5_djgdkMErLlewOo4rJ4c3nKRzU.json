"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**What is BID?$BID** is the governance token of the TopBidder protocol, which is used for protocol revenue’s Yield Farming and subsequent project governance. In order to improve the efficiency of decision-making in the early stage of the project, the dev team will have the right to make decisions. With the gradual mature of the ecology, the decision-making power will gradually be transferred to the community.\\n\\n1. In the early stage of the project, after the artists certified on the platform, part of their **rNFT** issued has the function of minting $**BID** in the bidding process. The release speed of **$BID** is related to the number of artworks submitted by artists, about 12 million **$BID** expected to be issued every year\\n2. The Top Bidder DAO will be opened after the **$BID** is distributed to a certain stage, say 30M has been circulated in the market. The DAO will vote to determine the setting of each parameter of the auction system, and the governance adopts a quadratic voting mechanism.\\n3. The governance token **$BID** has the function of yield farming the weekly revenue generated by the protocol\\n\\n**What are the rules of $BID issuance?**Token Name: **BID**Total circulation: 100 MillionAttributes: ERC20Function: protocol governance\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*__VilLHMQRnh3xFmZ_T-9Q.png)\\n\\n**Token Generate Method:**\\n\\n1. **Auction Farming** (5 years distribution, 60M)\\n2. **Team** (since the protocol official launch for 6 months, linear release within 33 months, 20M)\\n3. **Community Reservation** (volunteer grants, 50,000 caps per month, 3M)\\n4. **Artists Certification Subsidies** (after the artists passing the certification and mint an artwork, subsidy 1000 **$BID**, 1M)\\n5. \\\\*\\\\*CryptoArt community Airdrop \\\\*\\\\*(will be unlocked on May 20th 0:00 UTC, 1M)\\n6. **Early volunteer Grants** (core community and early contributors rewards, will be unlocked on May 20th 0:00 UTC, 1M)\\n7. **Community Fundraising** (released after the protocol is officially launched, linear release within 6 months, 6M)\\n8. \\\\*\\\\*Marketing and Strategic Partners \\\\*\\\\*(will be released 6 months after the protocol is officially launched, 3M)\\n9. **LBP and DEX liquidity providing** (liquidity bootstrapping completed before the protocol official launched, 5M)\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*NpquluZ3AAw3aXd1ACJfkA.png)\\n\\n***[BID TOKEN DISTRIBUTION SCHEDULE](https://topbidder.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/token_distribution.html)***\\n\\n**What are the rules for BID airdrop?$BID** performs airdrop to CryptoArt community, as long as you hold any NFTs of the following products below between the block height of 11,000,000 (October 6, 2020) and the block height of 12,128,000 (March 28, 2021), meanwhile your total spend in Opensea/Rarible/Foundation/SuperRare is more than 100 USD (0.05ETH), you are qualified for this airdrop.\\n\\nThe weight of each product is different. For example, if you own any parcels in CryptoVoxels and any Hashmasks, then you’ll get 200+50 **$BID**. The airdrop can be claimed on May 20th 0:00 UTC, and you can check it out on ***[this page](https://bidder.top/#/lbp)*** at any time\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*lg-hki-2UFo54Oq1ENETDg.png)\\n\\n***[BID TOKEN AIRDROP ADDRESS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15fuWAJq4keJ5uEDsuuajXnpXr1AQT1Kfsfsr2xaIRSo)***\\n\\n**What is LBP?**Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools, which is a smart trading pool launched by **Balancer**. The Tokens in the pool will gradually change the weight over time, and the price will also change accordingly.\\n\\nIn the most extreme case, if BID has not been purchased during the entire LBP period, then the price will gradually fall, as shown in the figure below\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1\\\\*x4XFWdO3DJ8YXT-IdJX2GQ.png)\\n\\nHowever, in practice, the price will fluctuate around the above curve: when someone buys, the price will rise immediately, otherwise the price will continue to fall. Like the game Flappy Bird\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1240/1\\\\*mZxO-XIoRVaOt7R0LNG54A.gif)\\n\\n***[The LBP Simulator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QVdE0hSkFeaN-ItFjqtwdhP4cBC4SbdQBi-2rERZui0)***\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* of BID Token\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n**How is the LBP parameter setting?**\\n\\nThe LBP of TopBidder Protocol lasts for 3 Days, starting at block height **12243100** (approximately 6:00 UTC on April 15th) and ending at block height **12262900** (approximately 6:00 UTC on April 18th).\\n\\nThe trading pair is BID/USDC, the initial weight is set to BID **90% + USDC 10%**, and the ending weight is set to **BID 50% + USDC 50%**. During the LBP process, only USDC can be used for trading. The initial price is **1.8 USDC**, and the **$BID** weight will gradually decrease within 72 hours.\\n\\nWhen the LBP is completed, the transaction will be suspended and the team will withdraw all the liquidity in the Balancer pool. At the same time, based on the closing price, a **BID/ETH** trading pair with a liquidity of US$2 million will be established in Uniswap.\\n\\nIn the Balancer LBP stage, the transaction fee rate is 0.15%, and traders other than the team cannot add liquidity. After the LBP ends and the Uniswap trading pair is established, traders can freely add BID/ETH liquidity.\\n\\n**How to trade BID during the LBP?**There is no difference between LBP transaction and ordinary Balancer transaction. Enter Balancer Exchange, select **USDC** and **BID** (contract address: 0x00000000000045166C45aF0FC6E4Cf31D9E14B9A) to start trading.\\n\\nor you can ***[Click on the link to enter directly](https://balancer.exchange/#/swap/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48/0x00000000000045166c45af0fc6e4cf31d9e14b9a)***\\n\\n**What is Poke Weight and what is the benefit?**Anyone can call **[Poke Weight](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0x126e65ce5d55c5b91891176fa27a6dddf2eb9755/actions)** before large purchases. This function is used to update the **$BID** weight to the current block height and obtain the latest price of the **$BID**, which helps to reduce transaction slippage.\\n\\nAfter the LBP starts, the team will adjust the weight every 30 minutes (The first 6 hours) / 1 hour (6–18 hours) / 2 hours (18–36 hours) / 3 hours (36–72) Hours) if no one calls the poke weight function\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*TzQ4uc385DQbQWTBPb8eiQ.png)\\n\\n**What is the best strategy for LBP?**\\n\\n1. First of all, do not trade in the first time after LBP starts. Unlike usual projects, the first time the transaction price will be at the highest position, and also there will be a high slippage. Wait for the price to gradually drop to a reasonable price before trading\\n2. Call [PokeWeight](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0x126e65ce5d55c5b91891176fa27a6dddf2eb9755/actions) to update the weight before large transactions, you can get lower prices and smaller transaction slippage\\n3. Under the premise of reasonable transaction fees, split the funds into multiple small transactions to reduce the uncertainty caused by price fluctuations and reduce the possibility of arbitrage by trading bots\\n\\n**Other informations:**\\n\\n[Website](https://bidder.top/)\\n\\nBID TOKEN contract address: *[0x00000000000045166C45aF0FC6E4Cf31D9E14B9A](http://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000000045166C45aF0FC6E4Cf31D9E14B9A)*\\n\\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/BidderTop)\\n\\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/BPRpFBvC7f)\",\"timestamp\":1636047639,\"title\":\"TopBidder Liquidity Bootstrapping (LBP) Tutorial - TopBidder - Medium\"},\"digest\":\"dMUgMWOXPOq05QlTJUkzYGa1N01m1vgB1C_pnKsner4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8888888888646B186b3b7cDc989411E8CD5A2bA2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZQTSu0QGWxt3mC_Hh6n9GcVQYVVT8MBeqNverlUPMlk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ycS2yUoWKKtQFrsUMhUgR8iJZW9R2XVbe40wnviza7Q\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"pwLdvPkQqmGmNokQB_Xrd5Chg2N_A-SqoEvYEJ4E58gYRAd47xKMW2iVMdz83NH42_8UHxocqcYEIuiM4f2-PQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x33dcd409feb7de332d9cbe7f5140a391437681f7a9296daf143a5e1691ef5f481f3ec6a1a20831639ffab1e11c52796badb0f3afdc34963b55df4aa4f1488b441b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZQTSu0QGWxt3mC_Hh6n9GcVQYVVT8MBeqNverlUPMlk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ycS2yUoWKKtQFrsUMhUgR8iJZW9R2XVbe40wnviza7Q\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"dMUgMWOXPOq05QlTJUkzYGa1N01m1vgB1C_pnKsner4\"}"
