"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The Greatest Generation saved the world from the Axis nations so democracy could live on. Originally dubbed the Baby Boomers, my generation was handed freedom and democracy to show the modern world what could be done with the opportunity.\\n\\nWe took that opportunity and provided the world with medical breakthroughs, technology, goods and services never imagined and created a lifestyle unmatched by so many in human history. We built great companies and developed an unparalleled economy.\\n\\n### Success or Failure?\\n\\nUnfortunately, although we succeeded greatly, we also failed monumentally.   We provided ourselves with more financial gain and opportunity than the world has ever known which allowed many of us to have two cars  and huge houses. The rising middle class was not satisfied with the stuff available so we developed and promoted designer brands of clothing, automobiles, big homes with swimming pools  and many other luxuries the Greatest Generation never imagined. We bought boats, RV's and second homes. Of course, even as there is no generality that describes everyone’s circumstances, the truth is that many boomers are living a greater life than any generation in history. Even most of the poor claim TVs, cell phones, and computers as part of life's necessities.  Life may be  satisfying but too much of that is based on borrowing from the prospects of future generations.\\n\\nWe declared many of the things the Greatest Generation fought hard for as rights due us.  For example, Medicare, social security, welfare and much more are expected today as rights due all U.S. citizens. Recently we have added a right to gun ownership, free healthcare, and avoiding a vaccine and mask to rights too many of us declare.\\n\\nAt the same time we evolved away from repairing our belongings into a throwaway society.  We tried to placate our consciences by tossing things in a recycle bin, but for the most part, we wasted more than any previous generation.\\n\\n### Air Land and Sea\\n\\nAlthough we were warned in the 1960s about the dangers of polluting the air with carbon compounds that could dangerously alter the climate, we bought more cars, boats, planes, trains and buses than ever before. We dumped the exhaust into the world’s atmosphere for future generations to contend with. Much of our pollution led to warming oceans that foster huge hurricanes, floods, melting glaciers, rising tides and threats to sea life.\\n\\nWhile past generations moved to apartments or downsized when they reached their 60’s, boomers are staying in their homes and at times buying additional vacation homes. That has left the next generation in a frenzy to find affordable housing which has, in turn, driven prices through the roof. Guess which generation can best afford those high price tags.\\n\\n### Our Last Hurrah?\\n\\nNow the Democrats seem to be perpetuating the entitlement of the boomer generation. They are borrowing money  from future generations to provide a more comfortable stay in assisted living, nursing homes and a more comfortable exit  to the already charmed lives of our generation.\\n\\n### The Legacy We Leave\\n\\nMost millennials will have less opportunity and see less success than their parents.\\n\\nThe technology we developed to provide robots with artificial intelligence will compete with the coming generations for meaningful jobs.  Even today, more people are taking jobs in the service sector than manufacturing or agriculture.  The family farm is gone and technology is running much of the huge farming industry. People who drive vehicles for a living have a dim future.\\n\\nThe Greatest Generation handed us a rosy future. We, on the other hand, are presenting the next generation a warming climate that carries with it floods, fires, drought, huge storms and scorching heat. We are bequeathing them a crushing debt that will be a burden for at least several decades. We are handing over a political system that has ground to a halt due to our inability to compromise, listen or even think.  We are handing over a career subservient to a computer or serving other people.\\n\\n### What Will Be Our Legacy?\\n\\nWe entered as the Boomer generation. Will our legacy be as the Selfish Generation, the Lucky Generation or just by the masses of babies that were born after the war?  My hope is that our progeny does more to leave the world in better shape than our generation did.\\n\\nDon't hesitate to leave your thoughts on the Boomer Legacy!  Is there time to shape our legacy?  \",\"timestamp\":1634327014,\"title\":\"Who Will We Have Been?\"},\"digest\":\"N_tXJ3gzSG4GQNYoz2R-Qr0hLweaR8F8wblLaUv_wRQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6dD59Ea98F1B30D3D99ff16B072541771b59dEC3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xEsgEq1dTF_1oRjUOWCGvOLcWTuFDpRreibfMxur4ZU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2Hl9Hjeh29Ggvv_IhG1S2HgSPUeVhBt1AWZ35hFxLzg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"aMepXIIy0E6eB6Z4ATM-oKC2YmMjGU3ePL2mrRWdnXnUCRl8MFaWXzjjAOKC_rK0NXOSY89c9y6tOAVvxEOe4A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2b03ef3040fb86ceb3b336746cd9aabbe1d68c627726cb3e4e46ec00aca431ed34ff713fda6dcf2a31e123064442fdccec4fccdc541b0b3de695ec9b57e14d1c1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xEsgEq1dTF_1oRjUOWCGvOLcWTuFDpRreibfMxur4ZU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2Hl9Hjeh29Ggvv_IhG1S2HgSPUeVhBt1AWZ35hFxLzg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"N_tXJ3gzSG4GQNYoz2R-Qr0hLweaR8F8wblLaUv_wRQ\"}"
