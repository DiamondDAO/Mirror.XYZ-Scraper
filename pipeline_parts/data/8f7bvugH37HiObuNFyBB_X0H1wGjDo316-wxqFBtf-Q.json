"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The world has become interesting again.\\n\\nIf you’re reading this, I’d assume you agree with me. That’s because there’s a shred of optimism when you read a blog, a Twitter thread, or a Medium post. Wait, should I say Mirror now? Sorry, Mirror. Thank you for letting me write here for free. \\n\\nAnyways, on to the optimism. Taking the time to read anything is a hopeful act. In doing so, we are trying to gain knowledge, value, opportunity. Before crypto, I found myself doing this less and less. The world, as I had come to understand it, was set in stone. The big players had cemented their lead, the small folks were learning to accept their lot in life and most of us began to bicker incessantly amongst ourselves on who is the “lesser evil”. \\n\\nNow, I can see something different. Crypto is the closest thing to a “New World” moment that we’ve had in some time. Each of us has become modern-day digital explorers, seeking fame, glory and riches on the risk-filled blockchain seas. \\n\\nUnlike the violent exploration and extractive colonization from our history, this New World only thrives if we truly build it together. With interoperability, open-source code and welcoming communities. That difference has me more excited than ever to learn, share and invest in this future.\\n\\nAnd while most people feeling this way would not bother to write long-form articles, I am not alone in my newfound voice. I’ve encountered people of all backgrounds, ideologies, and skill levels this year in what many are now calling Web3. Each of them was excited about *something*. Often it was an animal PFP or the meme coin of the week, but, well, you get the point. Even if those people end up rekt and leave the space, it’s a telling signal. Crypto is now a place for optimists, and you know what they say about those people.\\n\\n> “Pessimists are usually right and optimists are usually wrong but all the great changes have been accomplished by optimists.” ― Thomas Friedman\\n\\n## So, this is nice, but why am I reading this? \\n\\nIf you’re like me, you’re beginning to realize that there is so much noise in this space that makes deep thought difficult. This bull run is no different. It often feels that if you sit on an idea for a week, you’ve already missed the pump.\\n\\nFirst, there was Bitcoin making its post-halving move, and shortly after, the market woke up to Ethereum. Remember these Decentralized Finance apps that are completely open-source? Neat. Don’t forget about NFTs, those are pretty big now. Oh, and there are also Ethereum competitors, with their own DeFi apps and NFTs! \\n\\nDon’t worry. My head is spinning too. These inventions take time to understand.\\n\\nA new layer is needed for crypto to continue its growth. That layer is made up of people like me who have the audacity to think their words can add value to the world. Through well-connected narratives, data points, and anecdotes, I believe that we have the ability to build out this crazy crypto coalition. Not because it’s coming from some advanced trader or millionaire NFT collector. Instead, it sometimes needs to come from an average person that’s just trying to wrap their head around it all.\\n\\nThe funny part is, I don’t think even 5% of the world’s population has processed Bitcoin and what it represents, and Bitcoin is the simplest thing we have in crypto. The market needs translators, columnists, and dare I say, journalists to help onboard the next generation. It has to become *easier* to get into crypto, and this is one way I can contribute.\\n\\nSo, hello to the New World. I look forward to what comes next.\",\"timestamp\":1640713612,\"title\":\"Hello New World\"},\"digest\":\"dDDbtwGibA5PFrYRcZhfgEhHRvLgoeIlcJ_KsgXoO2Q\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x489cb726a939d56FFFdAD680A0485c17a0a39DAf\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"YNShYp4Wfwlulov_CUmc2nTa4f7yT0Zz-p2KSLpO81g\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kETBMZb7in0pZiUvpzM-XPSk9Ux8_vyUyJ2JDhV31XI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"tlsm7u1NxeVmwox5gk84pTMFEhw2PfEb8ClbewWouY7Qxsxr6BJ-62xQ0rj8-0RQWbc4ZfCa9JneFJbKygwEuQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x97e873a7524c731e3b8b16de2471728a027e46af3f89fa36b3c40dfc1970547c2c2450e9518ee43fd006811bf2bbf1c869f1d65ade46de2ba9c446c7ef6affda1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"YNShYp4Wfwlulov_CUmc2nTa4f7yT0Zz-p2KSLpO81g\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kETBMZb7in0pZiUvpzM-XPSk9Ux8_vyUyJ2JDhV31XI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"srRAvBf7U7SC44ZmSAgG7CC5ASIyYsAnPbf_fIeKrnc\"}"
