"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"he, puzzled, vexed, and alarmed.  The black boy stood like a statue--a plum-black statue--taking no interest in the transactions of these incomprehensible whites, but dreaming with calm eyes of a certain bush village high on the jungle slopes of Malaita, with blue smoke curling up from the grass houses against the gray background of an oncoming mountain-squall.\\n\\n\\\"But you won't do anything so foolish--\\\" he began.\\n\\n\\\"There you go again,\\\" she cried.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't mean it that way, and you know I didn't.\\\"  He was speaking slowly and gravely.  \\\"And that other thing, that not permitting--it is only a manner of speaking.

And I am very sorry that I should have said anything that hurt you.  Remember, I am an Englishman.\\\"\\n\\nJoan smiled and sat down again.\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps I have been hasty,\\\" she admitted.  \\\"You see, I am intolerant of restraint.  If you only knew how I have been compelled to fight for my freedom.  It is a sore point with me, this being told what I am to do or not do by you self-constituted lords of creation.-Viaburi I You stop along kitchen.  No bring 'm Noa Noah.--And now, Mr. Sheldon, what am I to do?  You don't want me here, and there doesn't seem to be any place for me to go.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is unfair.  Your being wrecked here has been a godsend to me. I was very lonely and very sick.  I really am not certain whether or not I should have pulled through had you not happened along. But that is not the point.  Personally, purely selfishly personally, I should be sorry to see you go.  But I am not considering myself.  I am considering you.  It--it is hardly the proper thing, you know.

I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.  There is no use in fighting the inevitable.  Here is the situation.  You are here.  I am here.  I can't go elsewhere, by your own account.  You certainly can't go elsewhere and leave me here alone with a whole plantation and two hundred woolly cannibals on my hands.  Therefore you stay, and I stay.  It is very simple.  Also, it is adventure.  And furthermore, you needn't worry for yourself.  I am not matrimonially inclined.  I came to the Solomons for a plantation, not a husband.\\\"\\n\\nSheldon flushed, but remained silent.\\n\\n\\\"I know what you are thinking,\\\" she laughed gaily.  \\\"That if I were a man you'd wring my neck for me.  And I deserve it, too.  I'm so sorry.  I ought not to keep on hurting your feelings.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm afraid I rather invite it,\\\" he said, relieved by the signs of the tempest subsiding.\\n\\n\\\"I have it,\\\" she announced.  \\\"Lend me a gang of your boys for to- day.  I'll build a grass house for myself over in the far corner of the compound--on piles, of course.  I can move in to-night.  I'll be comfortable and safe.  The Tahitians can keep an anchor watch just as aboard ship.  And then I'll study cocoanut planting.  In return, I'll run the kitchen end of your household and give you some decent food to eat.  And finally, I won't listen to any of your protests.  I know all that you are going to say and offer-- your giving the bungalow up to me and building a grass house for yourself.  And I won't have it.  You may as well consider everything settled.  On the other hand, if you don't agree, I will go across the river, beyond your jurisdiction, and build a village for myself and my sailors, whom I shall send in the whale-boat to Guvutu for provisions.  And now I want you to teach me billiards.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER VII--A HARD-BITTEN GANG\\n\\nJoan took hold of the household with no uncertain grip, revolutionizing things till Sheldon hardly recognized the place. For the first time the bungalow was clean and orderly.  No longer the house-boys loafed and did as little as they could; while the cook complained that \\\"head belong him walk about too much,\\\" from the strenuous course in cookery which she put him through.  Nor did Sheldon escape being roundly lectured for his laziness in eating nothing but tinned provisions.  She called him a muddler and a slouch, and other invidious names, for his slackness and his disregard of healthful food.\\n\\nShe sent her whale-boat down the coast twenty miles for limes and oranges, and wanted to know scathingly why said fruits had not long since been planted at Berande, while he was beneath contempt because there was no kitchen garden.  Mummy apples, which he had regarded as weeds, under her guidance appeared as appetizing breakfast fruit, and, at dinner, were metamorphosed into puddings that elicited his unqualified admiration.  Bananas, foraged from the bush, were served, cooked and raw, a dozen different ways, each one of which he declared was better than any other.  She or her sailors dynamited fish daily, while the Balesuna natives were paid tobacco for bringing in oysters from the mangrove swamps.  Her achievements with cocoanuts were a revelation.  She taught the cook how to make yeast from the milk, that, in turn, raised light and airy bread.  From the tip-top heart of the tree she concocted a delicious salad.  From the milk and the meat of the nut she made various sauces and dressings, sweet and sour, that were served, according to preparation, with dishes that ranged from fish to pudding.  She taught Sheldon the superiority of cocoanut cream over condensed cream, for use in coffee.  From the old and sprouting nuts she took the solid, spongy centres and turned them into salads.  Her forte seemed to be salads, and she astonished him with the deliciousness of a salad made from young bamboo shoots.  Wild tomatoes, which had gone to seed or been remorselessly hoed out from the beginning of Berande, were foraged for salads, soups, and sauces.  The chickens, which had always gone into the bush and hidden their eggs, were given laying-bins, and Joan went out herself to shoot wild duck and wild pigeons for the table.\\n\\n\\\"Not that I like to do this sort of work,\\\" she explained, in reference to the cookery; \\\"but because I can't get away from Dad's training.\\\"\\n\\nAmong other things, she burned the pestilential hospital, quarrelled with Sheldon over the dead, and, in anger, set her own men to work building a new, and what she called a decent, hospital. She robbed the windows of their lawn and muslin curtains, replacing them with gaudy calico from the trade-store, and made herself several gowns.  When she wrote out a list of goods and clothing for herself, to be sent down to Sydney by the first steamer, Sheldon wondered how long she had made up her mind to stay.\\n\\nShe was certainly unlike any woman he had ever known or dreamed of. So far as he was concerned she was not a woman at all.  She neither languished nor blandished.  No feminine lures were wasted on him. He might have been her brother, or she his brother, for all sex had to do with the strange situation.  Any mere polite gallantry on his part was ignored or snubbed, and he had very early given up offering his hand to her in getting into a boat or climbing over a log, and he had to acknowledge to himself that she was eminently fitted to take care of herself.  Despite his warnings about crocodiles and sharks, she persisted in swimming in deep water off the beach; nor could he persuade her, when she was in the boat, to let one of the sailors throw the dynamite when shooting fish.  She argued that she was at least a little bit more intelligent than they, and that, therefore, there was less liability of an accident if she did the shooting.  She was to him the most masculine and at the same time the most feminine woman he had ever met.\\n\\nA source of continual trouble between them was the disagreement over methods of handling the black boys.  She ruled by stern kindness, rarely rewarding, never punishing, and he had to confess that her own sailors worshipped her, while the house-boys were her slaves, and did three times as much work for her as he had ever got out of them.  She quickly saw the unrest of the contract labourers, and was not blind to the danger, always imminent, that both she and Sheldon ran.  Neither of them ever ventured out without a revolver, and the sailors who stood the night watches by Joan's grass house were armed with rifles.  But Joan insisted that this reign of terror had been caused by the reign of fear practised by the white men.  She had been brought up with the gentle Hawaiians, who never were ill-treated nor roughly handled, and she generalized that the Solomon Islanders, under kind treatment, would grow gentle.\\n\\nOne evening a terrific uproar arose in the barracks, and Sheldon, aided by Joan's sailors, succeeded in rescuing two women whom the blacks were beating to death.  To save them from the vengeance of the blacks, they were guarded in the cook-house for the night. They were the two women who did the cooking for the labourers, and their offence had consisted of one of them taking a bath in the big cauldron in which the potatoes were boiled.  The blacks were not outraged from the standpoint of cleanliness; they often took baths in the cauldrons themselves.  The trouble lay in that the bather had been a low, degraded, wretched female; for to the Solomon Islander all females are low, degraded, and wretched.\",\"timestamp\":1638930337,\"title\":\"Both were now on their feet, she with flushed cheeks and angry eyes\"},\"digest\":\"J5aWM8p23xQDBZopFsNYEkNiYKhOEgbML4QQWgJQTsM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x755Bda80E984cd5fAabcbf90e065196EEDb3214A\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Q4V3GRNtpUqfFGQurL4I5eqfNXUWxgbALrnFHhZea3g\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"iyMmFapZm6aVjcgOib1hyH7cP7xWOAfaPqb6of8i-Fg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Wedapg_QpN1KaS9RUuEwQW8yCNrZ2BMwi2zsIE9RdF_1H0ftT2qtygDjaJugNnzKkX59ysh2dEVMGo8qPw4u_A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x99178a96e5d62e3c8ed15f4efd4bf1ca59a84d97eb5de1d71a2fb86e2b3567b67461613242896734f81b9d76c792bf20d8de49f518a7d4b06a97eac61c0eb4a51b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Q4V3GRNtpUqfFGQurL4I5eqfNXUWxgbALrnFHhZea3g\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"iyMmFapZm6aVjcgOib1hyH7cP7xWOAfaPqb6of8i-Fg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"J5aWM8p23xQDBZopFsNYEkNiYKhOEgbML4QQWgJQTsM\"}"
