"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I previously wrote that:\\n\\nOpenSourceFutures (OSF) is an entity focused on the systematic exploration of possible futures that might unfold, based on understanding the trends that had been occurring. It looks backwards to try to perceive and re-perceive the present, and forwards to look at the possible trajectories. OSF is based in Singapore and writes at Medium as [Open Source Futures](http://www.medium.com/open-source-futures) and on the [Patreon](http://www.patreon.com/opensourcefutures).\\n\\nOSF uses foresight methodologies, such as scenarios analysis, causal layered analysis, and other tools. There are other times when OSF will lay out a conceptual framework or describe events that are happening. And sometimes, there are book reviews as well.\\n\\nOSF believes that the futures can be explored immersively, and sometimes the best way to learn about it is to try and use it, and that’s why OSF is on the Mirror platform.\\n\\n… \\n\\nThe essay below touched on several important aspects, especially the part about DAOs being a different kind of social organization. Kei looked at the Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace by John Perry Barlow, a manifesto for its time. \\n\\n[https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/t4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/t4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q)\\n\\nBuilding on such themes, I want to look into the implications of DAOs and what it means for global politics, to add to the discourse.\\n\\nI would be watching about how DAOs will operate alongside the constructs of countries and corporates. \\n\\n![How might DAOs interact with nation-states, corporations, in digital realities? in physical realities?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YVYv5OLlQV5vrP6tbJZrJ.jpg?height=563&width=1000)\\n\\nRight now, DAOs cannot operate independently yet; they still rely on the ecosystem from the rest of the world for translating digital finance into actual finance and goods. Perhaps there might be entire commodities and product ecosystems where one can live a life completely using on-chain products. \\n\\nI would be watching out for rule-making and rule-enforcements. How will DAOs make rules among the different members and enforce these rules? Will rulebreakers have a chance to re-enter chains, and on what terms? \\n\\nI am also wondering about how DAOs will respond to possible allocation failures, and how those might be corrected. Will hierarchies re-emerge and assert some fiat allocations every now and then? \\n\\nWhat kinds of rules might govern DAO interactions with nation-states and actual corporations in a transition period? How might DAO principles and ideologies come to shape their behaviours over a long period of time? How might DAO tokens and resources come to affect the physical reality? These are the questions I would be thinking about to think about the impact of DAOs on the real world.\\n\\nThe historical precedence that I can think about is when European explorers and entrepreneurs created the joint-stock company, pooling risk and rewards together for dangerous trades. \\n\\nMight the new Digital, Extended Realities (virtual realities-Metaverse, etc.) be the equivalent? It’s not quite clear. Those early Dutch sailing ships were competing against state-sanctioned privateers as well in those days. There has to be a sequence of major payoff events for DAOs to make their mark in the real world. Maybe it might be NFTs? \\n\\nThis is definitely an exciting space to watch!\",\"timestamp\":1640330014,\"title\":\"Starting (Again)\"},\"digest\":\"u7dRhdVP716gbtrWMTfXAkDTjG8-Z6j6xBN_mRs-VAU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x61015dA024bbf27b16E53934cF7A9Ab86e400d09\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"k0lkU9uQ4TbAP94gfLR2NajwOR1uxz10hAWlng-t2U0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"RaR2cR2hOWLb5NJgPGW_eC6lS-tKCGeN4xBm3FWizqw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"NS5OzHn5CdHvjeHi9ABach4M3Hihv8UvP84_DsDkdllm7l9tmOpNxMdZLEAjOWsj4B2lXinV-ehWETLnsAflnA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe08bb2bb2be14eba73a6ea83d18da69852b481f0f1980345490ef56f37513f8e095b5def4ae402dcb5aa35da7237180941dd8d2aed3a0a55ba8447a1a9ceffff1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"k0lkU9uQ4TbAP94gfLR2NajwOR1uxz10hAWlng-t2U0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"RaR2cR2hOWLb5NJgPGW_eC6lS-tKCGeN4xBm3FWizqw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"u7dRhdVP716gbtrWMTfXAkDTjG8-Z6j6xBN_mRs-VAU\"}"
