"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"[$SELF](https://dame.mirror.xyz/KHVDbIRgNJCVmEJYbS6T_cdCTfRDB4h0kL6PpLkD6t8) has been completed and each unique NFT is being distributed to the correct participant. If you missed out on the original project, or if you'd like an extra collectible, I've made a collage that features all of the pieces in sequential order. You can mint one of these collectibles here on this post.\\n\\n$SELF was an experiment and a participatory art project. I wanted to see what would happen when relationships, self identity, and blockchains collided. Anyone could join for a minimum of 0.01 ETH. At the beginning, I had no idea what this project would blossom into.\\n\\nIn the end, I created 72 unique abstract pieces. Each one has different traits, qualities, and complexities. I created them all by hand, one by one.\\n\\nHalfway through the project, I took a snapshot of the participating wallets and analyzed the resulting data bit by bit. I also [encoded an on-chain message](https://dame.mirror.xyz/5xbwbVzWcO8vQkEIGlMaUjXNM6UNM8labiN-5QkVCHM) that was sent to each participant. Almost half of the participants sent on-chain replies. All of these elements influenced my perception and understanding of each $SELF, as well as its relation to my $SELFs.\\n\\nIf I’m honest, I didn’t like many of my $SELFs. Many of the pieces felt quite ugly or nonsensical to me. I struggled with this fact during the creation process but ultimately leaned into it. I accepted it as an expression of the project’s conceptual roots.\\n\\nAfter all, $SELF hatred is real. It’s a dislike for parts of our $SELFs or the things we make. But there is also $SELF love. With time and patience we can come to appreciate all of our $SELFs and make room for them to change and grow. Making this space is essential to the process, and without it we can't move forward.\\n\\nIt feels rather fitting to finalize this project on the day that EIP-1559 went live on Ethereum Mainnet. The London fork is a new version of Ethereum's self. \\n\\nSharing these final NFTs with you is a form of $SELF expression and an invitation into a deeper relationship with your own $SELFs, to each other, and to the blockchain itself.\\n\\nAnd remember, we don’t just contain multitudes... we are multitudes.\\n\\n--- \\n\\nThank you to everyone who participated. We are forever tied together on-chain.\\n\\n[Self](crowdfund://0x972fBE58D550F17eD723Bc4bcEb60163d45E46c1?version=3&network=homestead&features=backers)\",\"timestamp\":1628217308,\"title\":\"$SELF Reflection\",\"publication\":\"dame\"},\"digest\":\"WgwPFvnBKyr0Lu1zy2HFENuA9uLaZMf-cDzOSSGTD4c\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3B3525F60eeea4a1eF554df5425912c2a532875D\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kuTE5QRs7R5VfZwXe4JhqLgVzNwW39EX4voXVBc0CuQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"x5OYHoI3n3HW5LxDNOWCIeGtPbvfYBNlHaMuELcPVWc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"XCwClvbbexO5CvNemWYhRA0V-eMyReDsc2Zwgk3J0Vp-z_tYlNw3dZj2qWwKkd_pfHgIZXTiqAF-XoIPr_z5dw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1077cb3f3647d571bac526817b07b91f203648ed5b76c6b7cef75171161b211e7e4a56dddfd0c9155c6c5f9fc14e12145dd8561c535dbf76d7f251fae42b5a2c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on dame.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kuTE5QRs7R5VfZwXe4JhqLgVzNwW39EX4voXVBc0CuQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"x5OYHoI3n3HW5LxDNOWCIeGtPbvfYBNlHaMuELcPVWc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"o4V9Mcjm5pombjhCwqC-NmiGj4PEBNcxhtrd4bDRlfw\"}"
