"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Hayden Adams came onto the crypto scene when he decided to learn how to code using the Solidity language that powers the Ethereum network. This was after he was laid off by tech giant Siemens, which was, according to him, “The best thing that ever happened to me.”\\n\\nThereafter, Hayden perfected his knowledge of automated market makers and decentralized exchanges, which led him to launch Uniswap in late 2018. The second version of the DEX came in May 2020, and soon, the total value locked on the decentralized application was going through the roof, inspired in part by the SushiSwap liquidity mining rush. But even with SushiSwap now running its own gig, Uniswap is still going from strength to strength. \",\"timestamp\":1639029828,\"title\":\"Legit the coolest thing about this page is not Uniswap competing with cex\"},\"digest\":\"dumsdWIsiEyd0JoAXcgvHfCwmPuWwKxAL7hZZy9Z53g\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xe49BE7Ec23409e53999155F0e35578176bcf3b32\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LYF0QXkNBsVHWXjDbve5cRFsGEQK32lMEEvuwqgQsug\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"pnl3tENgarFgkqHYvrmpdWBQrZN3WOCn_AoaFHab7qA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Hhfmllc6yk2hcT7PXbW8Pd-VRZHdAqvPimme9nwx-61g1Oef-K5ou9l1X3tja0t-w6f0C31nQHVpRRlzG_mXNQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5be7b356a9ac3b0922989e82f31f7e27734df26ed1d1bdd8a40dda18471ff5801db715dbb3a74b7b60739acc750ef6ce83d05af271ff77921d380b20a4bafb821b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LYF0QXkNBsVHWXjDbve5cRFsGEQK32lMEEvuwqgQsug\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"pnl3tENgarFgkqHYvrmpdWBQrZN3WOCn_AoaFHab7qA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"dumsdWIsiEyd0JoAXcgvHfCwmPuWwKxAL7hZZy9Z53g\"}"
