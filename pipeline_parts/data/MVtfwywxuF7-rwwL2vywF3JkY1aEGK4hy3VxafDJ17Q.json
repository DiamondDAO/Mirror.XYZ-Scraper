"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"and saw Uxmoor drive up. Dark blue coach; silver harness, glittering in the sun; four chestnuts, glossy as velvet; two neat grooms as quick as lightning. He was down in a moment, and his traps in the hall, and the grooms drove the trap round to the stables.\\n\\nThey were all in the drawing-room when Lord Uxmoor appeared; greeted Zoe with respectful warmth, Vizard with easy friendship, Severne and Miss Dover with well-bred civility. He took Zoe out, and sat at her right hand at dinner.\\n\\nAs the new guest, he had the first claim on her attention and they had a topic ready--his sick friend. He told her all about him, and his happy recovery, with simple warmth. Zoe was interested and sympathetic; Fanny listened, and gave Severne short answers. Severne felt dethroned.\\n\\nHe was rather mortified, and a little uneasy, but too brave to show it. He bided his time. In the drawing-room Lord Uxmoor singled out Zoe, and courted her openly with respectful admiration. Severne drew Fanny apart, and exerted himself to amuse her. Zoe began to cast uneasy glances. Severne made common cause with Fanny. \\\"We have no chance against a lord, or a lady, you and I, Miss Dover.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I haven't,\\\" said she; \\\"but you need not complain. She wishes she were here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So do I. Will you help me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, I shall not. You can make love to me. I am tired of never being made love to.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said this ingenuous youth, \\\"you certainly do not get your deserts in this house. Even I am so blinded by my passion for Zoe, that I forget she does not monopolize all the beauty and grace and wit in the house.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Go on,\\\" said Fanny. \\\"I can bear a good deal of it--after such a fast.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have no doubt you can bear a good deal. You are one of those that inspire feelings, but don't share them. Give me a chance; let me sing you a song.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A love song?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Can you sing it as well as you can talk it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"With a little encouragement. If you would kindly stand at the end of the piano, and let me see your beautiful eyes fixed on me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"With disdain?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, no.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"With just suspicion?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No; with unmerited pity.\\\" And he began to open the piano.\\n\\n\\\"What! do you accompany yourself?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, after a fashion; by that means I don't get run over.\\\"\\n\\nThen this accomplished person fixed his eyes on Fanny Dover, and sung her an Italian love song in the artificial passionate style of that nation; and the English girl received it pointblank with complacent composure. But Zoe started and thrilled at the first note, and crept up to the piano as if drawn by an irresistible cord. She gazed on the singer with amazement and admiration. His voice was a low tenor, round, and sweet as honey. It was a real voice, a musical instrument.\\n\\n\\\"More tunable than lark to shepherd's ear When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.\\\"\\n\\nAnd the Klosking had cured him of the fatal whine which stains the amateur, male or female, and had taught him climax, so that he articulated and sung with perfect purity, and rang out his final notes instead of slurring them. In short, in plain passages he was a reflection, on a small scale, of that great singer. He knew this himself, and had kept clear of song: it was so full of reminiscence and stings. But now jealousy drove him to it.\\n\\nIt was Vizard's rule to leave the room whenever Zoe or Fanny opened the piano. So in the evening that instrument of torture was always mute.\\n\\nBut hearing a male voice, the squire, who doted on good music, as he abhorred bad, strolled in upon the chance; and he stared at the singer.\\n\\nWhen the song ended, there was a little clamor of ladies' voices calling him to account for concealing his talent from them.\\n\\n\\\"I was afraid of Vizard,\\\" said he; \\\"he hates bad music.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"None of your tricks,\\\" said the squire; \\\"yours is not bad music; you speak your words articulately, and even eloquently. Your accompaniment is a little queer, especially in the bass; but you find out your mistakes, and slip out of them Heaven knows how. Zoe, you are tame, but accurate. Correct his accompaniments some day--when I'm out of hearing. Practice drives me mad. Give us another.\\\"\\n\\nSeverne laughed good-humoredly. \\\"Thus encouraged, who could resist?\\\" said he. \\\"It is so delightful to sing in a shower bath of criticism.\\\"\\n\\nHe sung a sprightly French song, with prodigious spirit and dash.\\n\\nThey all applauded, and Vizard said, \\\"I see how it is. We were not good enough. He would not come out for us. He wanted the public. Uxmoor, you are the public. It is to you we owe this pretty warbler. Have you any favorite song, Public? Say the word, and he shall sing it you.\\\"\\n\\nSeverne turned rather red at that, and was about to rise slowly, when Uxmoor, who was instinctively a gentleman, though not a courtier, said, \\\"I don't presume to choose Mr. Severne' s songs; but if we are not tiring him, I own I should like to hear an English song; for I am no musician, and the words are everything with me.\\\"\\n\\nSeverne assented dryly, and made him a shrewd return for his courtesy.\\n\\nZoe had a brave rose in her black hair. He gave her one rapid glance of significance, and sung a Scotch song, almost as finely as it could be sung in a room:\\n\\n\\\"My love is like the red, red rose That's newly sprung in June; My love is like a melody That's sweetly played in tune.\\\"\\n\\nThe dog did not slur the short notes and howl upon the long ones, as did a little fat Jew from London, with a sweet voice and no brains, whom I last heard howl it in the Theater Royal, Edinburgh. No; he retained the pure rhythm of the composition, and, above all, sung it with the gentle earnestness and unquavering emotion of a Briton.\\n\\nIt struck Zoe's heart pointblank. She drew back, blushing like the rose in her hair and in the song, and hiding her happiness from all but the keen Fanny. Everybody but Zoe applauded the song. She spoke only with her cheeks and eyes.\\n\\nSeverne rose from the piano. He was asked to sing another, but declined laughingly. Indeed, soon afterward he glided out of the room and was seen no more that night.\\n\\nConsequently he became the topic of conversation; and the three, who thought they knew him, vied in his praises.\\n\\nIn the morning an expedition was planned, and Uxmoor proffered his \\\"four-in-hand.\\\" It was accepted. All young ladies like to sit behind four spanking trotters; and few object to be driven by a viscount with a glorious beard and large estates.\\n\\nZoe sat by Uxmoor. Severne sat behind them with Fanny, a spectator of his open admiration. He could not defend himself so well as last night, and he felt humiliated by the position.\\n\\nIt was renewed day after day. Zoe often cast a glance back, and drew him into the conversation; yet, on the whole, Uxmoor thrust him aside by his advantages and his resolute wooing.\\n\\nThe same thing at dinner. It was only at night he could be number one. He tuned Zoe's guitar; and one night when there was a party, he walked about the room with this, and, putting his left leg out, serenaded one lady after another. Barfordshire was amazed and delighted at him, but Uxmoor courted Zoe as if he did not exist. He began to feel that he was the man to amuse women in Barfordshire, but Uxmoor the man to marry them. He began to sulk. Zoe's quick eyes saw and pitied. She was puzzled what to do. Lord Uxmoor gave her no excuse for throwing cold water on him, because his adoration was implied, not expressed; and he followed her up so closely, she could hardly get a word with Severne. When she did, there was consolation in every tone; and she took care to let drop that Lord Uxmoor was going in a day or two. So he was, but he altered his mind, and asked leave to stay.\\n\\nSeverne looked gloomy at this, and he became dejected. He was miserable, and showed it, to see what Zoe would do. What she did was to get rather bored by Uxmoor, and glance from Fanny to Severne. I believe Zoe only meant, \\\"Do pray say things to comfort him;\\\" but Fanny read these gentle glances *'a la* Dover. She got hold of Severne one day, and said,\\n\\n\\\"What is the matter with you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course you can't divine,\\\" said he, sarcastically.\\n\\n\\\"Oh yes, I can; and it is your own fault.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My fault! That is a good joke. Did I invite this man with all his advantages? That was Vizard's doing, who calls himself my friend.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If it was not this one, it would be some other. Can you hope to keep Zoe Vizard from being courted? Why, she is the beauty of the county! and her brother not married. It is no use your making love by halves to her. She will go to some man who is in earnest.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And am I not in earnest?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not so much as he is. You have known her four months, and never once asked her to marry you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So I am to be punished for my self-denial.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Self-denial! Nonsense. Men have no self-denial. It is your cowardice.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't be cruel. You know it is my poverty.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your poverty of spirit. You gave up money for her, and that is as good as if you had it still, and better. If you love Zoe, scrape up an income somehow, and say the word. Why, Harrington is bewitched with you, and he is rolling in money. I wouldn't lose her by cowardice, if I were you. Uxmoor will offer marriage before he goes. He is staying on for that. Now, take my word for it, when one man offers marriage, and the other does not, there is always a good chance of the girl saying this one is in earnest, and the other is not. We don't expect self-denial in a man; we don't believe in it. We see you seizing upon everything else you care for; and, if you don't seize on us, it wounds our vanity, the strongest passion we have. Consider, Uxmoor has title, wealth, everything to bestow with the wedding-ring. If he offers all that, and you don't offer all you have, how much more generous he looks to her than you do!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In short, you think she will doubt my affection, if I don't ask her to share my poverty.\\\"\\n\\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/31](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/31)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637670019,\"title\":\"\\nHalf an hour before dinner there was a grating of wheels on the gravel.
