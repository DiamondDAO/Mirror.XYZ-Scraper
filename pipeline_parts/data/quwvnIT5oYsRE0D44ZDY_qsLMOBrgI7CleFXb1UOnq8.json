Mankind’s true moral test, its fundamental test (which is deeply buried from view), consists of its attitude towards those who are at its mercy: animals.”\\n\\n(*Milan Kundera*)[\\\\[48\\\\]](#_ftn48)\\n\\nIn the last 70 years we have achieved something extraordinary. Perhaps for the first time in the Common Era, we have learned not to sacrifice a large percentage of our young men’s lives or health in fighting over limited resources in war — and all of the additional uncountable suffering in the fear, rape, hunger and homelessness of women and children. Yet we are still practising activities that cause unneeded untold suffering to many other life-forms.\\n\\nWe are sacrificing nearly all other life-forms, and potentially millions of subspecies, to our immediate desires. We are doing so without even understanding our actions, without undertaking a fuller review of their qualities and value within a holistic ethical framework.\\n\\nEven leaving aside the issues of utility value, suffering and wisdom, the impact on the quality of life for billions of humans alone is not being properly reviewed and assessed in our decision-making.\\n\\nWe must first count the value of other life-forms fairly — not on human-centric terms, which are subjectively biased about what can ‘feel’ or what is affected by the loss of its freedom of action. Our culture can no longer be based largely on our desire to avoid recognition of our actions by redefining suffering, sentience and sapience so as to exclude other life-forms. We need to realise the intrinsic value of other life-forms.\\n\\nThe last 10,000 years, during which humans have accelerated their dominance of the biosphere, has already seen the extinction of extraordinary numbers of life-forms and species. This has been a species level sacrifice whereby humans (unknowingly, at first, and now knowingly) have eradicated billions of years of evolutionary complexity and problem-solving in what is, relatively speaking, a few heartbeats.\\n\\nThe extinction rate keeps climbing (exponentially so) and we can no longer claim naivety — that we expect each animal and species we kill to be magically renewed by God or nature. The cognitive revolution that gave rise to human culture changed the rules of the game in a manner similar to that which would happen if an aggressive non-human AI evolved today. Earth’s other life-forms never had a chance to adapt and survive.\\n\\n*Who will create a holocaust*[\\\\[49\\\\]](#_ftn49)\\\\* museum to remember all of the extinct species and life-forms — to remember the loss of diversity and complexity and uncountable avoidable suffering?\\\\*\\n\\n*Are we prepared to be asked: and where were you, and what did you do?**[\\\\[50\\\\]](#_ftn50)***\\n\\n![\\\\[51\\\\] “Ice age fauna of northern Spain”, Wikipedia, Mauricio Antón, c. 2004 CE, CC BY 2.5: “The image depicts a late Pleistocene landscape in northern Spain with woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius), equids, a woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis), and European cave lions (Panthera leo spelaea) with a reindeer carcass.”\\\\[51\\\\]](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\\\*pQFmOIaQEAzYqBLrk1Fw6Q.jpeg?&size=medium)\\n\\n![“MammothVsMastodon”, Wikipedia, Dantheman9758, 2007 CE, CC BY S.A 3.0; Charles R.
