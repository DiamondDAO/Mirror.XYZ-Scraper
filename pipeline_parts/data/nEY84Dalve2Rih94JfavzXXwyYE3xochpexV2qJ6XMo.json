"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"In China, students have to study all the time, they need to take all kinds of important exams, their parents want their kids take the first place, so students bury their heads in the books. When talking about Chinese kids and foreign kids, it has been admitted that Chinese kids are good at exams, while foreign kids are good at hand work. I think hand work is more important than the exam, students need to do some work to make themselves' living. Chinese students need to join more activities, it can not only help them broaden their vision, but also can improve their overall quality. Besides getting high scores, students also need to learn to do some hand work, or they will become bookworms. Parents should not care so much about the exams, they should give the children more freedom, exam is not everything.\",\"timestamp\":1639134803,\"title\":\"Join Activity\"},\"digest\":\"wRVTN9L14OAmOaLQdzEBhj7n3iU6OKbsedG2-7MZp1U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD1946d5C83DAfC52435c9FdAbF0f469f8a1571d7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"dklAgemnqxOZ9BD2zHf6Z7-oBPTiJSTNKIbkkiiYGJk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"-RhCuEjLeI2FTNMthWwJvhHNNr99uIygwwYVUGzmuYU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"mA949q69x1D07NA3nT9E5imbI8wXJ7_4Wqx_q98IO46sNc1A_RaX8fE75-f2E2vcdpKHd87zJsgdsg-UfbUeVQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5b48cdb4f37401b1fa6ba5da63b164029f48d239ae1afeffef9901110375879d58b7d706856abc28fe494814e7403b7da28a6287c8da91bb7f0c205ae6ddad4e1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"dklAgemnqxOZ9BD2zHf6Z7-oBPTiJSTNKIbkkiiYGJk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"-RhCuEjLeI2FTNMthWwJvhHNNr99uIygwwYVUGzmuYU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wRVTN9L14OAmOaLQdzEBhj7n3iU6OKbsedG2-7MZp1U\"}"
