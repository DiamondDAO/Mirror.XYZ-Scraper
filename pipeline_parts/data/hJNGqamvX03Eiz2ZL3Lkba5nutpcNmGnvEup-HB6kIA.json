"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## How the past can help us in the present and future\\n\\nI’ve been reading history avidly for about four years now. Mostly biographies of presidents, but also many deep dives into historical events. Throughout my journey of the past, I’ve learned many lessons. I’ve written this article to help make sense of the uncovered nuances buried throughout the pages of history, by formulating them into a concrete and digestible list. \\n\\n### Reading history makes you better informed\\n\\n“History doesn’t repeat itself but it often rhymes.” You’ve probably heard this quote from Mark Twain before, but if you haven’t - certainly take note.  \\n\\nI will admit I was a news junkie. I would constantly be looking for breaking news headlines and rapidly evolving events. I wanted to be informed, and had a craving to always keep up with the latest news. After reading history, my previous notions of what it meant to be “informed” caused a complete reversal in how I digest information. \\n\\nIt is my understanding now that if you want to truly understand why things happen, and the nature of causality amongst day-to-day breaking news, you have to get to the source. History is the source. \\n\\nIt’s easy to be sucked into the modern 24-hour news cycle. Filled with sensationalist “breaking news” content that plays into our deep rooted, ancient, emotionally driven instincts. It divides us, misinforms us, and is a parasite to modern life. Reading history helps fix this.\\n\\nTell me if these events sound familiar. A non-violent black American was killed at the hands of a racist white man. The murder got international attention, and by nightfall, riots were popping up across the nation. In Washington D.C. reports of storefront windows being broken into with looting starting to take place. Angry violent mobs gathered near the capitol and torched a Chevrolet dealership. Mobs across the country continued to act in these violent manners. \\n\\nWere these events that happened from the death of George Floyd? No, these were the events that transpired upon the death of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4th, 1968.

These are almost two identical events in history, and having lived through the death of George Floyd I heard many people across the media claim that this is an “event never seen before.”\\n\\nIt certainly has been seen before. The outrage amongst the public in these two events isn’t anything new. There are countless examples of things like this happening, and to think you’re living through something that’s never been experienced before, you’re probably wrong. \\n\\nI like using this example, although very tragic in both events, they reinforce Mark Twain’s point above which is that history and people do repeat a lot of the same things. Knowing this, and by reading history you get a better understanding of your place in time. You get the sense that these are things we’ve seen before and can certainly overcome. \\n\\n### You have more influence than you think you do\\n\\nThe great thing about reading history is you get a top-down view of events as they unfolded through time. This allows you to get the whole story - an objective view of a subjective time. \\n\\nA common undercurrent that emerges as you read history from this perspective, is you see the patterns and connections throughout. You see that Event A was caused because Event B happened at just the right time. In the moment they seem unrelated, but have massive impacts on how history has unfolded. \\n\\nAlthough this is an extreme example, it’s a perfect illustration of exactly how a single person or persons can influence an outcome, or in this case deter an outcome from happening. \\n\\nIt was the fall of 1960, then President-elect John F. Kennedy was spending much of his time at his Palm Beach house awaiting inauguration. The Secret Service was aware that Kennedy had been receiving a lot of hate mail, mostly due to the fact that he was the first Catholic President. \\n\\nOne letter in particular by a man from New Hampshire caught the Secret Service’s full attention. He threatened to kill President-elect Kennedy by turning himself into a “human bomb.” The man had recently gone missing, and suspicions around it becoming a reality were starting to cause concern.\\n\\nOne Sunday in Palm Beach, President-elect Kennedy planned on attending a ten o’clock Mass. Jaqueline Kennedy had told the press that she was not going to attend. When JFK emerged from his house, to the dismay of the public Mrs. Kennedy and their three year old daughter, Caroline decided to join him. They walked out to the front gate, where there was a group of people wanting to get a glimpse of the newly elected President.  \\n\\nA few days later, Palm Beach police found the man behind the bomb threats. He was a seventy three year old man named Richard Pavlick. The cops arrested him when they found dynamite and bomb-making material in his motel room nearby. \\n\\nIt turned out that Pavlick had been sitting in his car down the street from the Kennedy’s residence when they had walked out to greet the public, but when Mrs. Kennedy and Caroline came out with JFK, Pavlick said he couldn't will himself to do it. He decided to wait for another opportunity when JFK was alone.

Although we know his tragic ending, this at least spared him a few more years he could enjoy with his family, and the people he cared about. \\n\\nThese are choices that we can make today; how we treat people and the actions we take, although it may seem like they have no causal effect, have much more weight and influence than you think.   \\n\\n### History teaches you how to treat people\\n\\nOur parents and teachers have a vital impact on our worldview. They teach us right from wrong, the philosophy of ethics and morals, but they are human just like the rest of us. They make mistakes too, and can otherwise not offer the breadth of knowledge available. \\n\\nReading history expands that breadth. You are able to read intimate stories of other humans, and how they lead their lives. You get a deeper understanding that we’re all trying our best, and that everyone has a story. \\n\\nIn my mind, history is like your oldest grandfather, telling you an infinite amount of stories and lessons from the past that can help make you a better human today. \\n\\nMarcus Aurelius, in his book [Meditations](https://www.amazon.com/Meditations-New-Translation-Marcus-Aurelius/dp/0812968255/ref=sr_1_5?crid=60GZFOZH44W1&dchild=1&keywords=meditations+marcus+aurelius&qid=1629812713&sprefix=meditations%2Caps%2C225&sr=8-5) talks a lot about how to treat people. He says: \\n\\n> “When you wake up in the morning tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine … We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions.” \\n\\nRegarded as one of the most respected emperors in Roman history, an active member of stoic philosophy, Marcus Aurelius was one of the most powerful men the world has ever seen. Given the circumstances of his power, it’s easy to get caught up in egotism. In the passage above, it’s clear that Marcus had a keen sense of self-awareness. An ability to block out the power bestowed upon him, and to treat each person he met with dignity and respect. He stuck to his teachings, and left us with a masterclass in philosophy, ethics, morals and how to treat your fellow man. \\n\\nMeditations is an intimate amalgamation of all of Marcus Aurelius’s journals. He would likely scoff at the notion that his private journals are now widely published, but the lessons we can learn from the internal thoughts of the most powerful man in the world at the time is invaluable information we can’t pass up.\\n\\nIt is my understanding now, having read through history, that you have a moral obligation to treat people kindly, respectfully and with patience because we’re all in this together. \",\"timestamp\":1642390608,\"title\":\"Key Lessons From Reading History\"},\"digest\":\"7uNH_O0lkRtJLXNmIV3AUTk5i_-t0k0IXF970RKhA2g\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8cB5384BE0Fb397233b7e26baA155Ad3Da29B3F3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3y21Aaq8jqdELqNoOfgsuwQokYheysdoLHwc5_QRVns\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dLlmGbuWgB7uckMYA3s1L22MqfS9iCgdFvM4RqWNgp0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"8bpRIE72N455sqpbVr3ISFpdOAODKi_XAmOq_X8-tOL29rpfkcQUj1HRHCs6u8KHPh1texvn9n9UWVeHBqFVvw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xbabc562fda5eecb57f7de262e0c212799731f904dde8d41d491e38b0e5cc4d506020bccd1cd138e3a2cca13333406630b0412cc0febd6774cb27f389774cbaf91c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3y21Aaq8jqdELqNoOfgsuwQokYheysdoLHwc5_QRVns\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dLlmGbuWgB7uckMYA3s1L22MqfS9iCgdFvM4RqWNgp0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"7uNH_O0lkRtJLXNmIV3AUTk5i_-t0k0IXF970RKhA2g\"}"
