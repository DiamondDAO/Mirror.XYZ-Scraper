"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The withdrawal of these Southern members threw the control of the House into the hands of the Republicans.  Their realization of their power was expressed in two measures which also passed the Senate; Kansas was admitted--as a State with an anti-slavery constitution; and the Morrill tariff, which they had failed to pass the previous spring, now became law.  Thus the Republicans began redeeming their pledges to the anti-slavery men on the one hand and to the commercial interest on the other.  The time had now arrived for the Republican nominee to proceed from Springfield to Washington.  The journey was circuitous in order to enable Lincoln to speak at a number of places.  Never before, probably, had the Northern people felt such tense strain as at that moment; never had they looked to an incoming President with such anxious doubt.  Would he prevent war?  Or, if he could not do that, would he be able to extricate the country--Heaven alone knew how!--without a terrible ordeal?  Since his election, Lincoln had remained quietly at Springfield.  Though he had influenced events through letters to Congressmen, his one conspicuous action during that winter was the defeat of the Crittenden Compromise.  The Southern President had called upon his people to put their house in order as preparation for war.  What, now, had Lincoln to say to the people of the North?\\n\\nThe biographers of Lincoln have not satisfactorily revealed the state of his mind between election and inauguration.  We may safely guess that his silence covered a great internal struggle. Except for his one action in defeating the Compromise, he had allowed events to drift; but by that one action he had taken upon himself the responsibility for the drift.  Though the country at that time did not fully appreciate this aspect of the situation, who now can doubt that Lincoln did?  His mind was always a lonely one.  His very humor has in it, so often, the note of solitude, of one who is laughing to make the best of things, of one who is spiritually alone.  During those months when the country drifted from its moorings, and when war was becoming steadily more probable, Lincoln, after the manner of the prophets, wrestled alone with the problems which he saw before him.  From the little we know of his inward state, it is hard for us to conclude that he was happy.  A story which is told by his former partner, Mr. Herndon, seems significant.  As Lincoln was leaving his unpretentious law-office for the last time, he turned to Mr. Herndon and asked him not to take down their old sign.  \\\"Let it hang there undisturbed,\\\" said he.  \\\"Give our clients to understand that the election of a President makes no difference in the firm....  If I live, I'm coming back some time, and then we'll go right on practising law as if nothing had happened.\\\"\\n\\nHow far removed from self-sufficiency was the man whose thoughts, on the eve of his elevation to the Presidency, lingered in a provincial law office, fondly insistent that only death should prevent his returning some time and resuming in those homely surroundings the life he had led previous to his greatness.  In a mood of wistfulness and of intense preoccupation, he began his journey to Washington.  It was not the mood from which to strike fire and kindle hope.  To the anxious, listening country his speeches on the journey to Washington were disappointing.  Perhaps his strangely sensitive mind felt too powerfully the fatefulness of the moment and reacted with a sort of lightness that did not really represent the real man.  Be that as it may, he was never less convincing than at that time.  Nor were people impressed by his bearing.  Often he appeared awkward, too much in appearance the country lawyer.  He acted as a man who was ill at ease and he spoke as a man who had nothing to say.  Gloom darkened the North as a consequence of these unfortunate speeches, for they expressed an optimism which we cannot believe he really felt, and which hurt him in the estimation of the country.  \\\"There is no crisis but an artificial one,\\\" was one of his ill-timed assurances, and another, \\\"There is nothing going wrong....  There is nothing that really hurts any one.\\\"  Of his supporters some were discouraged; others were exasperated; and an able but angry partisan even went so far as to write in a private letter, \\\"Lincoln is a Simple Susan.\\\"\\n\\nThe fourth of March arrived, and with it the end of Lincoln's blundering.  One good omen for the success of the new Administration was the presence of Douglas on the inaugural platform.  He had accepted fate, deeply as it wounded him, and had come out of the shattered party of evasion on the side of his section.  For the purpose of showing his support of the administration at this critical time, he had taken a place on the stand where Lincoln was to speak.  By one of those curious little dramatic touches with which chance loves to embroider history, the presence of Douglas became a gracious detail in the memory of the day.  Lincoln, worn and awkward, continued to hold his hat in his hand.  Douglas, with the tact born of social experience, stepped forward and took it from him without--exposing Lincoln's embarrassment.\\n\\nThe inaugural address which Lincoln now pronounced had little similarity to those unfortunate utterances which he had made on the journey to Washington.  The cloud that had been over him, whatever it was, had lifted.  Lincoln was ready for his great labor.  The inaugural contained three main propositions.  Lincoln pledged himself not to interfere directly or indirectly with slavery in the States where it then existed; he promised to support the enforcement of the fugitive slave law; and he declared he would maintain the Union.  \\\"No State,\\\" said he, \\\"upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the Union....  To the extent of my ability I shall take care, as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States....  In doing this, there need be no bloodshed or violence; and there shall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority.  The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property and places belonging to the government.\\\"  Addressing the Southerners, he said: \\\"In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war.  The Government will not assail you....  We are not enemies but friends....  The mystic cords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\\\"\\n\\nGentle, as was the phrasing of the inaugural, it was perfectly firm, and it outlined a policy which the South would not accept, and which, in the opinion of the Southern leaders, brought them a step nearer war.  Wall Street held the same belief, and as a consequence the price of stocks fell.\\n\\nCHAPTER VI. WAR\\n\\nOn the day following the inauguration, commissioners of the newly formed Confederacy appeared at Washington and applied to the Secretary of State for recognition as envoys of a foreign power. Seward refused them such recognition.  But he entered into a private negotiation with them which is nearly, if not quite, the strangest thing in our history.  Virtually, Seward intrigued against Lincoln for control of the Administration.  The events of the next five weeks have an importance out of all proportion to the brevity of the time.  This was Lincoln's period of final probation.  The psychological intensity of this episode grew from the consciousness in every mind that now, irretrievably, destiny was to be determined.  War or peace, happiness or adversity, one nation or two--all these were in the balance.  Lincoln entered the episode a doubtful quantity, not with certainty the master even in his own Cabinet.  He emerged dominating the situation, but committed to the terrible course of war.\\n\\nOne cannot enter upon this great episode, truly the turning point in American history, without pausing for a glance at the character of Seward.  The subject is elusive.  His ablest biographer\\\\* plainly is so constantly on guard not to appear an apologist that he ends by reducing his portrait to a mere outline, wavering across a background of political details.  The most recent study of Seward\\\\*\\\\* surely reveals between the lines the doubtfulness of the author about pushing his points home. The different sides of the man are hard to reconcile.  Now he seemed frank and honest; again subtle and insincere.  As an active politician in the narrow sense, he should have been sagacious and astute, yet he displayed at the crisis of his life the most absolute fatuity.  At times he had a buoyant and puerile way of disregarding fact and enveloping himself in a world of his own imagining.  He could bluster, when he wished, like any demagogue; and yet he could be persuasive, agreeable, and even personally charming.\\n\\n\\\\*Frederic Bancroft, \\\"Life of William H. Seward\\\". \\\\*\\\\* Gamaliel Bradford, \\\"Union Portraits\\\".\\n\\nBut of one thing with regard to Seward, in the first week of March, 1861, there can be no doubt: he thought himself a great statesman --and he thought Lincoln \\\"a Simple Susan.\\\"  He conceived his role in the new administration to involve a subtle and patient manipulation of his childlike superior.  That Lincoln would gradually yield to his spell and insensibly become his figurehead; that he, Seward, could save the country and would go down to history a statesman above compare, he took for granted.  Nor can he fairly be called conceited, either; that is part of his singularity.\\n\\nLincoln's Cabinet was, as Seward said, a compound body.  With a view to strengthening his position, Lincoln had appointed to cabinet positions all his former rivals for the Republican nomination.  Besides Seward, there was Chase as Secretary of the Treasury; Simon Cameron of Pennsylvania as Secretary of War; Edward Bates of Missouri as Attorney-General.  The appointment of Montgomery Blair of Maryland as Postmaster-General was intended to placate the border Slave States.  The same motive dictated the later inclusion of James Speed of Kentucky in the Cabinet.  The Black-Stanton wing of the Democrats was represented in the Navy Department by Gideon Welles, and in course of time in the War Department also, when Cameron resigned and Stanton succeeded him. The West of that day was represented by Caleb B. Smith of Indiana.\\n\\nSeward disapproved of the composition of the Cabinet so much that, almost at the last moment, he withdrew his acceptance of the State Department.  It was Lincoln's gentleness of argument which overcame his reluctance to serve.  We may be sure, however, that Seward failed to observe that Lincoln's tactlessness in social matters did not extend to his management of men in politics; we may feel sure that what remained in his mind was Lincoln's unwillingness to enter office without William Henry Seward as Secretary of State.\\n\\nThe promptness with which Seward assumed the role of prime minister bears out this inference.  The same fact also reveals a puzzling detail of Seward's character which amounted to obtuseness--his forgetfulness that appointment to cabinet offices had not transformed his old political rivals Chase and Cameron, nor softened the feelings of an inveterate political enemy, Welles, the Secretary of the Navy.  The impression which Seward made on his colleagues in the first days of the new Government has been thus sharply recorded by Welles: \\\"The Secretary of State was, of course, apprised of every meeting \\\\[of ministers\\\\] and never failed in his attendance, whatever was the subject-matter, and though entirely out of his official province.  He was vigilantly attentive to every measure and movement in other Departments, however trivial--as much so as to his own--watched and scrutinized every appointment that was made, or proposed to be made, but was not communicative in regard to the transaction of the State Department.\\\"  So eager was Seward to keep all the threads of affairs in his own hands that he tried to persuade Lincoln not to hold cabinet meetings but merely to consult with particular ministers, and with the Secretary of State, as occasion might demand.  A combined protest from the other Secretaries, however, caused the regular holding of Cabinet meetings.\\n\\nWith regard to the Confederacy, Seward's policy was one of non-resistance.  For this he had two reasons.  The first of these was his rooted delusion that the bulk of the Southerners were opposed to secession and, if let alone, would force their leaders to reconsider their action.  He might have quoted the nursery rhyme, \\\"Let them alone and they'll come home\\\"; it would have been like him and in tune with a frivolous side of his nature.  He was quite as irresponsible when he complacently assured the North that the trouble would all blow over within ninety days.  He also believed that any display of force would convert these hypothetical Unionists of the South from friends to enemies and would consolidate opinion in the Confederacy to produce war.  In justice to Seward it must be remembered that on this point time justified his fears.\\n\\nHis dealings with the Confederate commissioners show that he was playing to gain time, not with intent to deceive the Southerners but to acquire that domination over Lincoln which he felt was his by natural right.  Intending to institute a peace policy the moment he gained this ascendency, he felt perfectly safe in making promises to the commissioners through mutual friends.  He virtually told them that Sumter would eventually be given up and that all they need do was to wait.\\n\\nSeward brought to bear upon the President the opinions of various military men who thought the time had passed when any expedition for the relief of Sumter could succeed.  For some time Lincoln seemed about to consent, though reluctantly, to Seward's lead in the matter of the forts.  He was pulled up standing, however, by the threatened resignation of the Postmaster-General, Blair. After a conference with leading Republican politicians the President announced to his Cabinet that his policy would include the relief of Sumter.  \\\"Seward,\\\" says Welles, \\\"...was evidently displeased.\\\"\\n\\nSeward now took a new tack.  Fort Pickens, at Pensacola, was a problem similar to that of Sumter at Charleston.  Both were demanded by the Confederates, and both were in need of supplies. But Fort Pickens lay to one side, so to speak, of the public mind, and there was not conspicuously in the world's eye the square issue over it that there was over Sumter.  Seward conceived the idea that, if the President's attention were diverted from Sumter to Pickens and a relief expedition were sent to the latter but none to the former, his private negotiations with the Confederates might still be kept going; Lincoln might yet be hypnotized; and at last all would be well.\\n\\nOn All-Fools' Day, 1861, in the midst of a press of business, he obtained Lincoln's signature to some dispatches, which Lincoln, it seems, discussed with him hurriedly and without detailed consideration.  There were now in preparation two relief expeditions, one to carry supplies to Pensacola, the other to Charleston.  Neither was to fight if it was not molested.  Both were to be strong enough to fight if their commanders deemed it necessary.  As flagship of the Charleston expedition, Welles had detailed the powerful warship Powhatan, which was rapidly being made ready at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.  Such was the situation as Welles understood it when he was thinking of bed late on the night of the 6th of April.  Until then he had not suspected that there was doubt and bewilderment about the Powhatan at Brooklyn. One of those dispatches which Lincoln had so hastily signed provided for detaching the Powhatan from the Charleston expedition and sending it safe out of harm's way to Pensacola.  The commander of the ship had before him the conflicting orders, one from the President, one from the Secretary of the Navy.  He was about to sail under the President's orders for Pensacola; but wishing to make sure of his authority, he had telegraphed to Washington. Gideon Welles was a pugnacious man.  His dislike for Seward was deepseated.  Imagine his state of mind when it was accidently revealed to him that Seward had gone behind his back and had issued to naval officers orders which were contradictory to his own!  The immediate result was an interview that same night between Seward and Welles in which, as Welles coldly admitted in after days, the Secretary of the Navy showed \\\"some excitement.\\\" Together they went, about midnight, to the White House.  Lincoln had some difficulty recalling the incident of the dispatch on the 1st of April; but when he did remember, he took the responsibility entirely upon himself, saying he had had no purpose but to strengthen the Pickens expedition, and no thought of weakening the expedition to Charleston.  He directed Seward to telegraph immediately cancelling the order detaching the Powhatan. Seward made a desperate attempt to put him off, protesting, it was too late to send a telegram that night.  \\\"But the President was imperative,\\\" writes Secretary Welles, in describing the incident, and a dispatch was sent.\\n\\nSeward then, doubtless in his agitation, did a strange thing. Instead of telegraphing in the President's name, the dispatch which he sent read merely, \\\"Give up the Powhatan...Seward.\\\"  When this dispatch was received at Brooklyn, the Powhatan was already under way and had to be overtaken by a fast tug.  In the eyes of her commander, however, a personal telegram from the Secretary of State appeared as of no weight against the official orders of the President, and he continued his voyage to Pensacola.\\n\\nThe mercurial temper of Seward comes out even in the caustic narrative written afterwards by Welles.  Evidently Seward was deeply mortified and depressed by the incident.  He remarked, says Welles, that old as he was he had learned a lesson, and that was that he had better attend to his own business.  \\\"To this,\\\" commented his enemy, \\\"I cordially assented.\\\"\\n\\nNevertheless Seward's loss of faith in himself was only momentary. A night's sleep was sufficient to restore it.  His next communication to the commissioners shows that he was himself again, sure that destiny owed him the control of the situation.  On the following day the commissioners had got wind of the relief expedition and pressed him for information, recalling his assurance that nothing would be done to their disadvantage.  In reply, still through a third person, Seward sent them the famous message, over the precise meaning of which great debate has raged: \\\"Faith as to Sumter fully kept; wait and see.\\\"  If this infatuated dreamer still believed he could dominate Lincoln, still hoped at the last moment to arrest the expedition to Charleston, he was doomed to bitterest disappointment.\\n\\nOn the 9th of April, the expedition to Fort Sumter sailed, but without, as we have seen, the assistance of the much needed warship, the Powhatan.  As all the world knows, the expedition had been too long delayed and it accomplished nothing.  Before it arrived, the surrender of Sumter had been demanded and refused --and war had begun.  During the bombardment of Sumter, the relief expedition appeared beyond the bar, but its commander had no vessels of such a character as to enable him to carry aid to the fortress.  Furthermore, he had not been informed that the Powhatan had been detached from his squadron, and he expected to meet her at the mouth of the harbor.  There his ships lay idle until the fort was surrendered, waiting for the Powhatan--for whose detachment from the squadron Seward was responsible.\\n\\nTo return to the world of intrigue at Washington, however, it must not be supposed, as is so often done, that Fort Sumter was the one concern of the new government during its first six weeks.  In fact, the subject occupied but a fraction of Lincoln's time.  Scarcely second in importance was that matter so curiously bound up with the relief of the forts--the getting in hand of the strangely vain glorious Secretary of State.  Mention has already been made of All-Fools' Day, 1861.  Several marvelous things took place on that day. Strangest of all was the presentation of a paper by the Secretary of State to his chief, entitled \\\"Thoughts for the President's Consideration\\\".  Whether it be regarded as a state paper or as a biographical detail in the career of Seward, it proves to be quite the most astounding thing in the whole episode.  The \\\"Thoughts\\\" outlined a course of policy by which the buoyant Secretary intended to make good his prophecy of domestic peace within ninety days. Besides calmly patronizing Lincoln, assuring him that his lack of \\\"a policy either domestic or foreign\\\" was \\\"not culpable and...even unavoidable,\\\" the paper warned him that \\\"policies...both domestic and foreign\\\" must immediately be adopted, and it proceeded to point out what they ought to be.  Briefly stated, the one true policy which he advocated at home was to evacuate Sumter (though Pickens for some unexplained reason might be safely retained) and then, in order to bring the Southerners back into the Union, to pick quarrels with both Spain and France; to proceed as quickly as possible to war with both powers; and to have the ultimate satisfaction of beholding the reunion of the country through the general enthusiasm that was bound to come.  Finally, the paper intimated that the Secretary of State was the man to carry this project through to success.\\n\\nAll this is not opera bouffe, but serious history.  It must have taxed Lincoln's sense of humor and strained his sense of the fitness of things to treat such nonsense with the tactful forbearance which he showed and to relegate it to the pigeonhole without making Seward angry.  Yet this he contrived to do; and he also managed, gently but firmly, to make it plain that the President intended to exercise his authority as the chief magistrate of the nation.  His forbearance was further shown in passing over without rebuke Seward's part in the affair of Sumter, which might so easily have been made to appear treacherous, and in shouldering himself with all responsibility for the failure of the Charleston expedition.  In the wave of excitement following the surrender, even so debonair a minister as Seward must have realized how fortunate it was for him that his chief did not tell all he knew.  About this time Seward began to perceive that Lincoln had a will of his own, and that it was not safe to trifle further with the President.  Seward thereupon ceased his interference.\\n\\nIt was in the dark days preceding the fall of Sumter that a crowd of office-seekers gathered at Washington, most of them men who had little interest in anything but the spoils.  It is a distressing commentary on the American party system that, during the most critical month of the most critical period of American history, much of the President's time was consumed by these political vampires who would not be put off, even though a revolution was in progress and nations, perhaps, were dying and being born.  \\\"The scramble for office,\\\" wrote Stanton, \\\"is terrible.\\\"  Seward noted privately: \\\"Solicitants for office besiege the President....  My duties call me to the White House two or three times a day.  The grounds, halls, stairways, closets, are filled with applicants who render ingress and egress difficult.\\\"\\n\\nSecretary Welles has etched the Washington of that time in his coldly scornful way:\\n\\n\\\"A strange state of things existed at that time in Washington. The atmosphere was thick with treason.  Party spirit and old party differences prevailed, however, amidst these accumulated dangers. Secession was considered by most persons as a political party question, not as rebellion.  Democrats to a large extent sympathized with the Rebels more than with the Administration, which they opposed, not that they wished Secession to be successful and the Union divided, but they hoped that President Lincoln and the Republicans would, overwhelmed by obstacles and embarrassments, prove failures.  The Republicans on the other hand, were scarcely less partisan and unreasonable.  Patriotism was with them no test, no shield from party malevolence.  They demanded the proscription and exclusion of such Democrats as opposed the Rebel movement and clung to the Union, with the same vehemence that they demanded the removal of the worst Rebels who advocated a dissolution of the Union.  Neither party appeared to be apprehensive of, or to realize the gathering storm.\\\"\\n\\n[ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/65](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/65)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637674998,\"title\":\"\\nThe resignation of Jefferson Davis was communicated to the Senate in a speech of farewell which even now holds the imagination of the student\"},\"digest\":\"qVeB72j-JV2GX3Z2rMXl6two7Fm0iiJvCV4TuY9uvnA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x667E6054E728f4dC76df3f0F3c9c6bf23c751e8a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hOC5vRLgRdvpQY0e0dOoa9yh61sC0sNUFX1uHXshnr4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NH0slfb5hjFZsouFDlzZ3ocv7lNjy6iSOmm2jxF2DiM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ayZaer8F3eBg54ky-GfFewH2VwvgpVmUDwlzp1-lcAVkerckuIQIw1C-_tNIno6t2bWnqD-FGRHYA-eUS2F4zw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x501ad5575689544d72321e28a2e55f4b11ae003b89b1981a309f9882872d678c1e045f1ed1cbe5853b4690c4b95edc444b42652aa8c341847a651ad618eb139a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hOC5vRLgRdvpQY0e0dOoa9yh61sC0sNUFX1uHXshnr4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NH0slfb5hjFZsouFDlzZ3ocv7lNjy6iSOmm2jxF2DiM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"qVeB72j-JV2GX3Z2rMXl6two7Fm0iiJvCV4TuY9uvnA\"}"
