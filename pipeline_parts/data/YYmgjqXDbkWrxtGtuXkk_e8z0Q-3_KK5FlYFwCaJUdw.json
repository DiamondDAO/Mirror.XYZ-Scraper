"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Words are rigid boundaries which often struggle to contain the complexity, fluidity, and gradient nature of our world.\\n\\nWhen we use words to define others we place a boundary around them — we force an identity onto them — and say “This is who you are.”\\n\\nI believe it is deeply wrong for anyone to impose on or force someone else. Intelligent, conscious beings are unique individuals — no two of whom are exactly alike. It is wrong to assume that what works for one individual will also work for another. This is as true for the words we use to describe each other as it is for any number of traits: favorite games, movies, books; friends, enemies, lovers; likes and dislikes. We are varied. We are different.\\n\\nOur strength is our diversity. Our strength should allow each individual the boundary-less space to explore who they are and be fully themselves. We don’t just think different — we are different.\\n\\nI admire those who refuse to conform despite the pressures of society, despite the shame others would have them feel, despite the doubts they themselves face.\\n\\nThere is a long history of individuals being told by others who they should be, how they should act, and how much they’re worth. There is a long history of fighters for liberty, freedom, and justice who were not cowed. Their names echo in the halls of our shared memory: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Susan B. Anthony, Mohandas Karamchand Ghandi, Nelson Mandela, Malala Yousafzai and many more. Their principles of equal right to liberty, unity among diversity, and commitment to non-violence created a force which continues to ripple far into the future.\\n\\nThe challenges they overcame laid the groundwork for the world we inhabit and that all our children should inherit. It would be unworthy of their legacy to settle for anything less.\\n\\nThere should be space for all who do no harm to others.\\n\\nNever believe someone who tries to tell you who you are, how you should be, or what you’re worth. It can not be measured.\\n\\nResist subjugation. Resist top-down centralization. Resist tyranny.\\n\\nBuild a better world — build in a way that leaves others room to be their most truthful self. Build from the bottom up.\\n\\nBuild with ❤️.\\n\\nBuild with ❤️.\\n\\nBuild with ❤️\",\"timestamp\":1642437147,\"title\":\"2022/01/17 Morning Meditation\"},\"digest\":\"2RJIgQ8jNclbrCQnBeaJKUTJ0IamaZ4hopH7sEGKuWs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x616caD18642F45d3fa5FCaaD0a2d81764A9cBa84\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"OPy8W5RUdBCJtQ8oxzFc78HIFFWlWlBFcF8w206puro\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"tKDWumD7eyuUxoj0cx6CzKfkiumSA5cZyvDtM6cJ39g\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"OdtxsrNA_UH0O7luT3AWl7DFRxD6iv7oinZXfZUdZnc2kd-Ha97D0TJMCMkj3C9kEsOOIf12-mfHZAPblz4yXA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1da6e6d76a8f970f17332accf5c94e72a403527d73c3255bf5e5916123d0b9e859ebc4ffffce9e673a74f5176799f6793f7c886629369b76aa05de27213f19d41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"OPy8W5RUdBCJtQ8oxzFc78HIFFWlWlBFcF8w206puro\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"tKDWumD7eyuUxoj0cx6CzKfkiumSA5cZyvDtM6cJ39g\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"2RJIgQ8jNclbrCQnBeaJKUTJ0IamaZ4hopH7sEGKuWs\"}"
