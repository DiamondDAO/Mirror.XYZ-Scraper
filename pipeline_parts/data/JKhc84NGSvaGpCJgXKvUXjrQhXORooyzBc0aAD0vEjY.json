On Nov 16, some 100 migrants clashed with Polish forces in an attempt to force their way through the Bruzgi-Kuznica border crossing.\\n\\nThe Polish army detained dozens of migrants who crossed the Belarus border, and accused Belarusian special forces of masterminding the operation.\\n\\nEU officials have accused Lukashenko's government of orchestrating the crisis in retaliation for the trading bloc's support for the Belarusian opposition. Last week, EU foreign ministers agreed on the legal basis for a new round of sanctions against Minsk.\\n\\nForeign ministers from the EU and G-7 global powers said, \\\"We call on the government to cease immediately its aggressive and exploitative campaign.\\\"\\n\\n![Migrants gather at a transportation and logistics center near the Belarusian-Polish border in Grodno region, Belarus, on Friday. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RIqanAZ5tHMIOPbhW-pps.png?height=800&width=1200)\\n\\n![A repatriation flight carrying between 200 and 300 migrants took off from Minsk on Thursday bound for Erbil in Iraqi Kurdistan, and Baghdad. The flight to Baghdad carried 431 people, Russia's Interfax news agency reported.\\nIn 2015-16, more than 1 million people, primarily Syrians, poured into Europe. The resulting backlash buoyed right-wing nationalists across the continent, and since then, mainstream politicians have been reluctant to embrace immigration.\\n\\nThe number of migrants that have crossed or are waiting to cross the Poland-Belarus border is not so large when compared with the millions who fled Syria or Afghanistan, but the politics of migration are so volatile in Europe that even a small group can trigger tensions.\\n\\nThe New York Times said the right-wing governing party in Poland has long termed non-European migrants a threat to Polish culture and sovereignty, and its response to the current group has been predictably heated.\\n\\nSix years ago, some countries, notably Germany, welcomed migrants, while others, including Poland, refused to accept more than a few, clashing with EU leaders. But there was no danger that the issue would develop into armed conflict.\\n\\nNow, no one is offering to take the migrants, even as they experience life-threatening conditions. The EU is united behind Poland, which is portraying itself as the first line of defense for the bloc, while Warsaw and Minsk are trading ominous threats.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kg9_5MlZLAidAEYiPr7ZA.png?height=800&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638457595,\"title\":\"Border tensions fan flames of migration politics\"},\"digest\":\"SorNmaip6bQJi39mMwypjyyw1dAmA-uToNmG_x8doKk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5E62D5927d7A359Eca4e8feF15005C0FA818C07E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"dLDOLHHXtD_6_0r4P4qkektvvFxBi2Lr0MuJp7IEM_E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Gz8JmooNpxNVKZFrf2Y1EOVpqMkpsI6Uy5EyOYxyyf0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Dyw1QnlVO_6rPiJHV1l24TBmlaMYsBVgcsvxCsX1wEh2HxY4krtDVKrw-kMXk5hdMk7OCd2G0vWEQjlk7vDVkg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x03cd159331963e20e2c122599106acf8e6330654e4483f7969cfccf80cef76a47d5f901ac19ed4a048defef9c480f9449467a1de69f85d6e61c742862c0eaf001b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"dLDOLHHXtD_6_0r4P4qkektvvFxBi2Lr0MuJp7IEM_E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Gz8JmooNpxNVKZFrf2Y1EOVpqMkpsI6Uy5EyOYxyyf0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"SorNmaip6bQJi39mMwypjyyw1dAmA-uToNmG_x8doKk\"}"
