"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"This peasant food comes from Roman sheep herders who had little time and money to spend on eating. They used their sheep's cheese and a bit of the water that cooked the pasta to create a cream, then added black pepper to give it some extra flavor. Cheap, easy, and fast: this was perfect for them and for us even today!\\n\\n[ \\n ](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/melaniegiovenzana/)Step 1\\n\\nBring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt. Cook bucatini in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.\\n\\n* Step 2\\n\\n  Place grated Pecorino Romano cheese into a large glass bowl and mix with a fork to make sure the cheese contains no lumps.\\n* Step 3\\n\\n  Once the bucatini are al dente, lift them out with a spaghetti fork or tongs and put them directly into the bowl with the cheese. Do not allow the water to drain too much.\\n* Step 4\\n\\n  Add one ladle of pasta water to the bowl. Stir the bucatini around until a cream has formed. Add more pasta water, little by little, until a thick cream has formed. Sprinkle freshly ground pepper over the pasta. Toss and serve immediately.\",\"timestamp\":1640336994,\"title\":\"Bucatini Cacio e Pepe\"},\"digest\":\"7DMSEq2maX3TjZ0eofZhzxr-QnuZrY5P_uKE6mBfk2Y\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7B41f45cdC87dbEF8816f67ae57F4c2310c22e94\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kNWH4raMDt2HHesI9NQyrqobrzQuXvoma-aB3idMTy0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"hoQBBy98MXqn4M-J-w20gs-of2Hv4odjXk2EElBwqzc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ha8sFXL0I3v7-VRNKJ-2tUz7_qkL3BWhSz9Frov5XWRXo-ENRqlga_gp7tnuuHxG_s3Qgk-nqQxphZG_T_8a2w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd467f0e33d5cbd1a9e83bf0b7921f83098b4e53a74b6d2bfce819255be3654487ae2cb2e31cbb4ad558f45841df8cd17ad926f328e813f8b3fdbe482820b3dac1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kNWH4raMDt2HHesI9NQyrqobrzQuXvoma-aB3idMTy0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"hoQBBy98MXqn4M-J-w20gs-of2Hv4odjXk2EElBwqzc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"dEfwIVeS_fzhMwBFrEkLCzNo6wO5_ElLMl1HFLywqTk\"}"
