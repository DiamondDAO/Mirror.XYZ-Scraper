"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"【Overview of 30 seconds】\\n\\n1. The constant maturity of blockchain technology will be reflected in real-life applications.\\n2. Technical difficulties deter outsiders, and solving cross-domain problems can make more people understand and use blockchain technology to benefit.\\n3. The global market for smart contracts has reached 345.4 million US dollars, still growing.\\n\\n【Project overview】\\n\\nUnilab aims to address the cross-cutting concerns of each smart contract lifecycle. From startups to enterprises, Unilab's open community will create, run, and expand smart contracts.\\n\\n【Industry background】\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3R_viBE1NNi-YDZWsB2dL.png?height=548&width=975)\\n\\n1. The global market for smart contracts has reached $345.4 million and is growing. \\n2. Six thousand smart contracts are produced every day. \\n3. Annual losses due to loopholes or technical defects amount to $1 billion. \\n4. The compound growth rate of blockchain development costs is up to 46%.\\n5. The market spends $8 billion every year on blockchain solutions.\\n\\n**【Project function】**\\n\\nThe code-free smart contract service platform helps users complete the deployment and application of smart contracts in four steps.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7a-WXanjmvwz9bqYtkdrR.png?height=548&width=974)\\n\\n1. Users find smart contract templates according to their own needs.\\n2. customised according to users' preferences.\\n3. Deploy smart contracts on the main network.\\n4. Detect and manage smart contracts.\\n\\nBased on the 12 smart contracts supported, four kinds of 96 smart contract templates will be added soon.\\n\\n【Token Distribution】\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EjQO_etIsFIXPW8tyOhS2.png?height=606&width=1080)\\n\\n**【Participating institutions】**\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Qa4zkxSg4E4gS2qach16z.png?height=598&width=1312)\\n\\n**【Project advantages】**\\n\\n**1.Punctuality.** \\n\\nOnce the contract is established by law, it will automatically implement its agreement. Since the smart contract is digital, its business agreement is automated, and there is no need to process and study the paperwork of the renewal date.\\n\\n**2.Security.** \\n\\nThe smart contract does not require the participation of a third party, and since all records are encrypted in the blockchain, the information in it cannot be changed for personal benefit. All files and related transactions in the blockchain are encrypted.\\n\\n**3.Optimise the cost.** \\n\\nUnilab's smart contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries to handle transactions, monitor renewals or extensions, and require large physical files. It supports many networks, including Ethernet squares and different keys.\\n\\n**4.Easy to use.** \\n\\nUnilab can implement dapp using users with a variety of skills. Unilab's platform is open to the community. Because it is decentralised, there is no single point of control, which means there is no single point of failure.\\n\\n**\\\\[Scorpio point of view\\\\]**\\n\\nEthereum is currently the largest smart contract platform, but its network congestion, high fees, slow transaction speed and other problems have been perplexing developers and users, so on this basis, more and more smart contract platforms have emerged. As the application of smart contract becomes more and more popular, a simple and efficient smart contract platform will attract more developers and increase the number of users.\\n\\nUnilab does not need code, only four steps to help users complete the deployment and application of smart contracts so that users with zero technical support can also make good use of smart contracts. It is a platform for simplifying the process of creation and deployment. \\n\\nAt present, there are many smart contract platforms, Unilab as a rising star, with its easy to use, excellent performance characteristics, will be able to stand out from many platforms.\\n\\n**\\\\[Related links\\\\]**\\n\\nWebsite :https://unilab.network/\\n\\nTwitter : @unilab_network\\n\\nTelegram :https://t.me/unilab_network\\n\\n· Risk Warning·\\n\\nThe above contents are based on the analysis and collationof network data, only for project research, and should not be used as a basisfor investment.\\n\\nPlease pay attention to guard against all kinds of illegalfund-raising and online pyramid selling activities carried out in the name of\\\"blockchain\\\" and \\\"cryptocurrency\\\".\\n\\nScorpio.VC will strictly abide by national laws andregulations and resolutely resist all kinds of illegal activities.\\n\\nIf you find that thecontent contains sensitive information, please contact us in the background andwe will deal with it in a timely manner.​ \\n \",\"timestamp\":1640011424,\"title\":\"[Scorpio research]Smart contracts service platform——UNILAB\"},\"digest\":\"THI5x0260TO_hm_thAbKCwSqlEvEhdxHdhBldRmh5Rk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x41C7a9BF1D59ff2d838445B683BdC4aD412d7A7b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"VHXFUnBuNSCZ_GqTXWD3u80WjolUrJ86qPac-hru18M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gkpkMXzfCMIgZRZq5ZQ4kDWQ4K9ODsP96UG_tovpqOk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"lWo7aO4LIxusuSIMs5D6A32BkSeTZd_18JJfWpJA4eabhz9MLs5mAfVVZfmaahsH9U-n7u-uZoq7L3gUBSPnPQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd36ebc5dbb22e36b28a0cfb23c908f4da172bdf3279e3cd552e9b0ff82c962525aee9700dad2106eb0ad05ebf6ab3ff402d1f5b37460a16475dd11fedb775b571b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"VHXFUnBuNSCZ_GqTXWD3u80WjolUrJ86qPac-hru18M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gkpkMXzfCMIgZRZq5ZQ4kDWQ4K9ODsP96UG_tovpqOk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"THI5x0260TO_hm_thAbKCwSqlEvEhdxHdhBldRmh5Rk\"}"
