The storms can occur at any time of year but are [most common between September and April](http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/weather/2016/01/20/noreaster-explainer-orig-nws.cnn.html).\\n\\nIn winter, temperatures associated with a nor'easter can be much more extreme than in the fall, which can lead to more intense storms and snow. The storms can cause beach erosion and rough ocean conditions, with winds of 58 mph or more.\\n\\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the New York City subway and other transit lines, is expecting 6 inches of rain over 12 hours, but it will be nothing like Hurricane Ida.\\n\\n\\\"At no point do we expect to see the type of intense rainfall over a very short term that we had during Hurricane Ida,\\\" MTA's acting Chair and CEO Janno Lieber said, noting the city saw more than 3.5 inches in one hour during Ida.\\n\\n* \\n\\n\\\"But, we are prepared for whatever comes,\\\" Janno added.\\n\\nThe biggest issue and constraint the MTA faces is the city sewers, which can be overwhelmed as they were during Ida, Janno said, but they don't expect it to be an issue during the storm.\\n\\n*CNN's Gene Norman, Rob Frehse and Kiely Westhoff contributed to this report.*\",\"timestamp\":1635248966,\"title\":\"New Jersey and New York issue states of emergency ahead of nor'easter\"},\"digest\":\"A66vxdFb6iTz0c1E67rHvnFiBB4DH2tsjyvZcy0jA6s\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x47CC9063B147f6D9fF7b366328DcF5A2D6F08265\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZrKHQOGD4gFXivVBM8Pu76G3W8wgI_i-OCgbNYh2M9Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"iLfNUhDpSBizSYxuBlAvGFZpG71ut91xYlkEC8A9ub8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"GrNauiQjKF2cQzZ2Fgo0fMjLZwXVW4Dk9JzaHQezXGid-cXBRyA4KiieCYXEXQnnJRKwXbgiX81fDih46ABkvQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x88b29817e85270ec4fc7745dd2bda90f9d79cc577d3bfa00f0a0a0b4abe499aa2f14a9a95beeb5adc0988cea38cd802eee97ab264110b877494f20337e166c071c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZrKHQOGD4gFXivVBM8Pu76G3W8wgI_i-OCgbNYh2M9Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"iLfNUhDpSBizSYxuBlAvGFZpG71ut91xYlkEC8A9ub8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"A66vxdFb6iTz0c1E67rHvnFiBB4DH2tsjyvZcy0jA6s\"}"
