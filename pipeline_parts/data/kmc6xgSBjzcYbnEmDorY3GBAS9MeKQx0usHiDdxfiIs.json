To improve the on-chain transaction speed, REI Network has inherited the DPoS consensus mechanism from GXChain. To further reduce the on-chain costs consumed, REI Network innovatively developed a new method of staking to obtain on-chain resources. This article will focus on how is REI Network's free economic model realized?\\n\\n**Why does REI Network require on-chain resources?**\\n\\nREI Network is a public chain that is compatible with EVM, lightweight, and supports the operation of smart contracts. As an underlying public chain, REI Network is essentially similar to an operating system, and various smart contracts that will run on REI Network in the future are like programs that consume resources for networking, computing, and storage.\\n\\n**On-chain resource consumption models of other networks**\\n\\nEVM-compatible networks basically adopt the GAS model, and each transaction and the operation of smart contracts need to pay a certain fee to the network, which will prompt\\n\\n1. Developers will try to write the code as concise and efficient as possible, so as to effectively avoid the abuse of resources;\\n2. Prevent Dusting Attacks from malicious users (because each transaction requires a trading fee to maintain the stability of the network);\\n3. Incentivize more miners/nodes to participate in the competition to verify network transactions, which improves the security of the network and makes the entire system more decentralized.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6-m-_6J9voudPasmmoIpU.png?height=291&width=612)\\n\\nHowever, the setting of GAS also has limitations. The value of the native token is too high, and in the case of network congestion, the trading fee for frequently interacting on-chain transactions (such as DEX transactions, Gamefi) is not small for users, which is the threshold for users to participate in on-chain interactions and reduces the enthusiasm of new users to participate in on-chain transactions.\\n\\n**Advantages of Gas-free Models on REI Network**\\n\\nAn important feature of REI Network is that users can obtain free on-chain resources by staking $REI token. For on-chain users, reducing trading fee consumption can increase the enthusiasm of users to participate in transactions; for the network, it reduces the market circulation of the native token, and increases its usage scenarios, improving it’s value.\\n\\n### How the Gas-free Model is implemented\\n\\n**Two important concepts**\\n\\n$Crude: The name of the on-chain resources obtained by REI users through staking, which can be used to deduct gas fees. After nodes verify the transaction to obtain $Crude, $Crude can be uniformly exchanged for REI Network’s native token $REI.\\n\\nFee pool: $Crude consumed by transactions will first be gathered in the fee pool, and 24-hour verification nodes can exchange $Crude in the fee pool into $REI through contracts.\\n\\n**Methods**\\n\\nREI Network Foundation will release 10 million $REI (1 million $GXC before the split) each year for the node as block producing reward and the user's staking reward for Crude consumption. Among them, the block producing reward and staking reward will account for 80% of the 10 million $REI, and the $crude consumption will account for 20% (this ratio is an initial decision, and the final ratio will be voted by $REI holders after the REI Network mainnet and the gas-free economic model are running stably .)\\n\\nStaking rewards are issued to staking&voting users, and block rewards are distributed to blocking nodes. For more details, please refer to: “The Staking Mechanism of REI Network”( <https://mirror.xyz/0xeaF9A6B15cE49DeAE7Fd8949D3B50B87Bf6AACcc/p1XguxXEjt38VnA18CI4hpbtxr3tMMM9k5iFyHG-ovA>) This article will focus on the third part of the 10 million $REI grants - the distribution and acquisition of $Crude.\\n\\n**Where does the free on-chain resource ($Crude) come from?**\\n\\nThe user staking $REI to vote for the node, and the smart contract will comprehensively calculate the amount of $Crude that the user can get every day according to the amount and duration of the staking, and the $Crude will be emptied every 24 hours.\\n\\n**How can users utilize free on-chain resources ($Crude)?**\\n\\n$Crude can be used to offset gas. When users trade on REI Network, they will consume $Crude first. If there is no Crude, then they will consume their own $REI. If the user only staking and does not trade, the $Crude in the account will be emptied every 24 hours, and $Crude cannot be transferred.\\n\\n**How can users utilize free on-chain resources ($Crude)?**\\n\\n$Crude can be used to offset gas fees. When users trade on REI Network, they will consume their own $Crude first. If there is no Crude, they will start to consume their own $REI. If the user only pledges and does not trade, the Crude in the account will be emptied every 24 hours, and transactions cannot be transferred.\\n\\n### For example:\\n\\nUser A has staked 10,000 $REI and can get 2 $Crude every day, which is the ten trading fees on REI Network, then User A can trade ten transactions on REI Network for free every day, and when the eleventh trading begins, $REI is required as a trading fee.\\n\\nUser B has not staked $REI. If he wants to trade on REI Network, he needs to keep a certain amount of $REI in his account as a trading fee, otherwise, the transaction will fail.\\n\\n**Where is the free on-chain resource ($Crude) going?**\\n\\nThe $Crude consumed by users every day is collected in the Fee pool, which is uniformly converted into $REI every 24 hours and distributed to each node according to the proportion of block packaging.\\n\\n**Infographic**\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qEOumfGsGs2exuylPvKSb.png?height=262&width=612)\\n\\nThe Gas-free economic model is an innovative design created by REI Network from the practical problems faced in the development of major public chains under the current competition. The future Web3 market will be billions of Web2 users. For those who are accustomed to free-fee-consumption, the public chain with  high gas fees is unattractive to them, so REI Network may be a good choice for newcomers.\\n\\n### Join the GXChain Community\\n\\nGXChain 2.0 is an EVM-compatible public blockchain. As an Ethereum para chain, it owns the features of lightweight, free and dev-friendly. GXChain 2.0 is to effectively solve the current high cost and low-efficiency problems of public chains. Therefore, GXChain can achieve free, low-cost development, and rapid migration of applications, and can be shared and symbiotic with the EVM ecosystem, also supporting the development of Defi, GameFi, and NFT.\\n\\n*Users can access the GXC token on:*\\n\\n[Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/GXS_USDT) | [Huobi Global](https://www.huobi.com/en-us/exchange/gxc_usdt?invite_code=d8c53)| [Upbit ](https://upbit.com/exchange?code=CRIX.UPBIT.BTC-GXC)| [Bithumb](https://www.bithumb.pro/en-us/spot/trade?q=GXC-USDT) | [Bittrex](https://global.bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=USDT-GXC)\\n\\nIf you are interested to participate in our community and receive timely updates from the following official channels:\\n\\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/GXChainGlobal) | [Telegram ](https://t.me/GXChain_international)| [Medium](https://medium.com/gxchain-project) |[Github](http://github.com/gxchain/) | [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/GXS/) | [Website](http://www.gxchain.org/en/)| [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/qHWZR5fJQa)\",\"timestamp\":1642149291,\"title\":\"How Does REI Network Achieve Gas-free Model\"},\"digest\":\"WEaVc7l0AlcZLqCf-ho9wgTFtUslk3XV0EgkxcqbMIM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xeaF9A6B15cE49DeAE7Fd8949D3B50B87Bf6AACcc\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rGXF5D7foEBGtpc6ID4HkiUsOi-9hKusRxbSdqIDTsc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"o_M7sq6wZ85pxm0SrBB2zOGpZSsa-kLdvO0YSl-uEIw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"29JDjhixv3wOGqcP-1j3B1SZ5v3xIwZ5Za4K9qWx2WXqoetIIujB6BTpv60sekPBMPlIvjkPubrfSD6_tiw8cg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xeab5974a6c114d120cdd2ba73d58b2e21f1eaab2a169c188287ec695a24aede81f520f51961628e9f471251031c327d47c6918107c9248187717e6e90600ee051c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rGXF5D7foEBGtpc6ID4HkiUsOi-9hKusRxbSdqIDTsc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"o_M7sq6wZ85pxm0SrBB2zOGpZSsa-kLdvO0YSl-uEIw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"WEaVc7l0AlcZLqCf-ho9wgTFtUslk3XV0EgkxcqbMIM\"}"
