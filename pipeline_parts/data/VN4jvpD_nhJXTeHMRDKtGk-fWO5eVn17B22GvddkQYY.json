The narrative attached to the region is one with continuous rife with tumultuous economies full of propaganda targeting the Western world. In the past decade, the world is starting to see that narrative shift, with more of the region’s innovators being highlighted to potential investors and partners globally, tying the MENA ecosystem to India, Sub Saharan Africa, and Eastern Europe. With these parallels, multiple parties are laying down the groundwork to further uplift this  budding technology ecosystem. A necessary first step is education innovation, as it can act to both keep this new ecosystem flourishing and maintain the region’s upward projection.  Yet, education within the MENA region has historically been tied to [“meritocratic” high-stakes testing](https://convention2.allacademic.com/one/cies/cies18/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Paper&selected_paper_id=1352207&PHPSESSID=021i3jjr3lk1edipctmddgv02o), a [cultural hierarchy of professions](https://www.stats.gov.sa/en/page/292), and the need to signal locally consistency among family and peer group career placement. \\n\\nEmpirical evidence demonstrates that lack of education innovation dooms emerging markets in two important ways. First, it staunches economic innovation. Second, without education innovation, the cycles of capital keep persisting outside as the emerging market falls further and further behind, usually resulting in mass unemployment. This mass unemployment widens the divide between the “haves” and the “have-nots,” which destabilizes governments. \\n\\n** \\n **As investment dollars start flowing to the MENA, edtech is one of the most prominent sub-sectors. Big players that have never entered the region before, such as Silicon Valley-based firm Sequoia Capital, have made their first investment in the region [this past summer](https://wired.me/business/startups/sequoia-capital-makes-its-first-splash-in-the-middle-east/) with a $5 million investment in the Egyptian digital banking startup, [Telda](http://v). This marks the MENA region’s largest pre-seed funding round. Overall, venture capital funding within the region grew [four times in August](https://magnitt.com/research/august-2021-venture-dashboard-50777?utm_source=cta&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=News), showing the increased attention from investors on both sides of the globe, and a turning point on current economic trends downwards with unemployment and education misalignment. \\n \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/R9q2vqaL_bbyw6mD5WJpJ.png?height=571&width=784)\\n\\nWithin MENA, the schools and universities are not the “career accelerators”  they are meant to be, but instead act as training modules for high-stakes testing and reclassify students into professions with very little human choice. According to recent studies,[ 38% of young people in the Middle East](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/20210608-impacts-of-covid19.pdf) believe their secondary school has ill-prepared them for the competitive market. Since the 2000s, concerted efforts in the Middle East have been made by Egypt, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates to revamp education and schooling. Egypt has launched “[Teachers First](https://teachersfirstegypt.com/new/teachers-first-begins-its-third-phase-seminars-with-al-minya-governorate-2/),” a program to update skills and modern instructional practices over high-stakes testing and at-home based curricula. As a result of this shift in focus, the World Bank has started supporting Tunisia and the UAE in bringing about[ universal preschool enrollment](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/opinion/2018/11/13/fixing-the-education-crisis-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa) by the end of this year, 2021.  \\n \\n\\nOne country in the region that has the capital and stability to grow much quicker is Jordan, which is traditionally known for its prevalence in the tourism sector. This paper will focus on Jordan and reflects other countries in the Levant region, including Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria. As the Levant region’s economy remains in flux between traditional career hierarchy and tech-enabled careers, education and profession matching becomes more and more complex, with unexpected salary outcomes. \\n\\nJordan’s education is ripe for disruption as they have a rise in [engineering talent](https://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/jordan-tops-capita-engineers-globally-%E2%80%94-jea), as well as international attention from the technology community.[ Ranked #1 in education in the Arab world,](https://en.unesco.org/countries/jordan) its students are still behind the wave of Western innovation.

Before entering their Tawjihi “year,” year 12 of school, students in Jordan must decide their “stream” of study in their national high school curriculum. Streams are labeled scientific, literary, technological, or managerial, and many secondary schools do not offer every stream. Students may take tests in multiple streams, yet the tests a student tends to excel in are within the stream of study. These streams are reflected in the curricula of both public and private schools and are overall a forced decision before the completion of secondary school. \\n\\nThe [scores on these tests](https://www.collateralrepairproject.org/whats-the-tawjihi/) are used to fill “seats” in the national universities, and seats are given out by department and profession. For example, the highest ranked “humanities” stream placement may be a law major at the University of Jordan and the highest ranked “science” stream placement may be medicine and a pre-doctoral track. These seats have a high cutoff of Tawjihi scores and will decide who deserves that seat to the hundredth percent difference (98.67% vs. 98.66%). The last count of students that took the Tawjihi was over 145,000 in June of 2018, with a minimum score of 40% to be considered for university. \\n\\nBy using a numbers-only approach, the region touts equality and meritocracy. But as tests, in particular high-stakes college admittance exams, are becoming a [political battle in the United State](https://ucsdguardian.org/2021/05/23/uc-agrees-to-no-longer-consider-act-sat-scores-in-admissions/)s, we need to reflect on the validity of the skills assessed in these budding economies as well. \\n\\n![https://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/tawjihi-results-announced](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IQKc7u824CwxKksG1oZg2.png?height=716&width=1276)\\n\\n## Tawjihi in the News\\n\\nTop scorers are coming out of [public schools ](http://jordantimes.com/opinion/editorial/after-tawjihi)more than the country’s private schools, with a preference for female students, reiterating the meritocratic basis of the exam. [Unemployment ](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR500/RR556/RAND_RR556.pdf)among women is still 2x greater than that of men in Jordan, according to the International Labor Organization (ILO), and around 30 % for young people between the ages of 15 - 24. And in 2021, 67% of jobs within Jordan are filled by non-citizens. \\n\\nThere seems to be a growing need to focus on noncognitive skills, such as language, teamwork, and problem-solving, that are more and more necessary for this new economy, which favors the creative and adaptable, rather than the number crunchers and the memorizers. According to RAND, the first issue of Jordanian graduates finding jobs after completing postsecondary education institutions in [enhancing vocational and technical education](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR500/RR556/RAND_RR556.pdf).\\n\\nCulturally, many issues are holding back Jordanians on their way to professionalism. Jordanians do not feel free to pursue career choices due to social and familial pressure, specifically women who are pressured into jobs that could also be “domestic.” Those who choose the science stream before the tawjihi are considered “smart,” whereas those who choose literature are considered “weak.” For both genders, there is a [negative perception on the private sector, including instability and harsher labor](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR500/RR556/RAND_RR556.pdf). Yet to secure a government job, many Jordanians are left behind due to [“wasta'' or lacking familial/friendly connections](https://www.transparency.org/en/news/wasta-how-personal-connections-are-denying-citizens-opportunities-services). ** \\n **\\n\\nThe [World Bank assessed the scene in 2012](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/9332) and promoted the need to form stronger networks between universities and business/industry to align postsecondary curriculum with the needs of the labor market. This assessment also included the need for career guidance and internships between universities and industry/business to educate youth with the knowledge and experience to gain access to high-paying jobs in the private work sector, a common issue in all postsecondary, including Western nations like the United States. \\n\\n## What Jordan Needs to Do Next \\n\\nOutside the many needed social measures to allow more access to all occupations and education, large strides can be taken in the college/major matching taking place through this [one high-stakes test](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/245762) process, the Tawjihi. **The changes to the Tawjihi process will be broken into 3 main claims:** \\n\\n1. **The addition of a writing section or personal statement.** College and career matching is a very complex problem to fix, but the addition of more appropriate measures of work ethic and motivation will be key. The adoption of a writing section to the Tawjihi process that is not graded by form and grammar but by voice and nuance will fast track the self-aware and driven students. One may [adopt the ACT standard](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/newsroom/students-in-jordan-given-option-to-take-act-test.html) as others have done in emerging economies. \\n2. **The bucketing of majors and removing “seat” protocol until after year 1 of university.**  Removing the stratification of majors into top performers and bottom performers takes away the grace and importance of each specialty. The ability to move around while in post-secondary school is also necessary for choice 2 and choice 3 to be more personal and less anxiety-inducing. In addition, studying an area of interest promotes the habit of lifelong learning and remaining on the cutting edge of every industry. From interviewing 8 Tawjihi takers this past season (June 2021), many were conflicted on the options they no longer had, and the passions they had discovered from choice 1, Year 9, and the allocated choices in year 12, post-Tawjihi. \\n3. **A co-operative year or a work engagement requirement that the university facilitates.** Education should successfully combine the classroom with on-the-job understanding, preparing the next generation for the business world. These are similar to the many programs stimulating local economies in the Midwestern and Southern United States. The world is in a war for skills, and these skills are the ones that become antiquated in 10 year sprints. On-the-job training is more accessible and useful than the textbooks these students are used to.** \\n **\\n\\n### With these major changes to the higher education process in Jordan, the strength of this nation can push its technology industry to be competitive with the giants of the world. \\n\\n** \\n  \\n ** \\n \",\"timestamp\":1638216471,\"title\":\"Need to Jumpstart Jordan’s Tech Potential?
