"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Pantera Capital recently led a $4 million seed funding round in Stader Labs, an India-based pledge DeFi protocol. In addition to Pantera, several top investors such as Coinbase Ventures, True Ventures, Jump Capital, Firecoin Ventures, Terraform Labs, Solana Foundation and Near Foundation also participated in the round. With the deal launching its master network in a few weeks, I think it's the right time to explain what Stader Labs does, how it fits into the broader pledge ecosystem, and why we at Pantera are so excited about the work they're building.\\n\\nWhat is the current shape of pledging?\\nThis is an important time for proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains. The number one underlying public chain platform for smart contracts, Ether, is transitioning to Ether 2.0, which involves a shift from the current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to PoS consensus, while Polkadot, Solana, Cosmos, Terra and a number of other prominent PoS underlying public chains are experiencing soaring market capitalisation, increased community excitement and early developer adoption. adoption.\\n\\nSimilar to the multi-billion dollar cryptocurrency mining industry, we expect PoS networks to unlock similarly sized rewards for participants (\\\"verifiers\\\" or \\\"pledgers\\\") who secure these blockchains. These blockchains already have a cumulative market capitalisation of over $350 billion and are expected to pay out over $10 billion in pledge rewards in 2021 alone.\",\"timestamp\":1634975007,\"title\":\"Pantera Capital partner: Pledge market could reach billions of dollars, Stader protocol helps retail investors get a piece of the pie\"},\"digest\":\"DWxeLx6YlgbExK1PDnwLYUj_IIQg3PvpT2Uw02v28y4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0b1f89F0164142f35d436E8baFCde4ad1b9A86E5\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2LOBkWAvQBCG9UcxOMb1fKJ8c6DJeTyEWFHPKvCQHzc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qQor2byf6wDlFYur6kWppU1V3yRznYsEtrUuhRPk-D0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"0G5cBZoGEBHt1RDvUYudZT1wed3LHmSOt7mwCdjJ6nWvYGI2WM3uAqC9_jrciX_RblfSWJiZC8QXefFaledi3Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc8fc805ae23cf44cfd7678cbea471424ae64080ead6779fea09ec54a2a832c547e7cb1b0fff742bb327ce6c72c9611023e03b0d9182674c425a449712c83eddd1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2LOBkWAvQBCG9UcxOMb1fKJ8c6DJeTyEWFHPKvCQHzc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qQor2byf6wDlFYur6kWppU1V3yRznYsEtrUuhRPk-D0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"DWxeLx6YlgbExK1PDnwLYUj_IIQg3PvpT2Uw02v28y4\"}"
