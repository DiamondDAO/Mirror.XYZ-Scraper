Carnivora (Meat-Eaters)\\n\\nCarnivora are an order of mammals that specialise in eating flesh, including bears, cats, wolves, hyenas, otters, seals and walruses. All evolved from a common weasel-like ancestor that appeared a few million years after the Cretaceous–Tertiary (K–T) extinction event around 66 million years ago, which is associated with the meteorite impact at Chicxulub in the Yucatan Peninsula that killed off the dinosaurs (and many other species).\\n\\nAmong the mammals of the animal kingdom, wolves have had a disproportionate impact on the evolution of human society and our relationship with other animals. They were perhaps the first wild animal to be domesticated by humans,[\\\\[80\\\\]](#_ftn80) from 40,000 to 14,000 years ago, in order to provide hunting support and protection to communities from animal predators and other humans. Since then, dogs have diversified in appearance to an astonishing degree,[\\\\[81\\\\]](#_ftn81) whilst remaining genetically similar enough to breed with their wilder wolf cousins. A number of canid species did not directly descend from lupine ancestors, including dholes, jackals and African wild dogs — which are sadly now endangered.\\n\\n![“Evolution of the wolf”, Wikipedia, public domain](https://miro.medium.com/max/1344/1\\\\*JDq3ecbhy0z7sUzIyT_ekA.png)\\n\\nThe canids[\\\\[82\\\\]](#_ftn82) are mostly closely related to seals and the highly inquisitive and tenacious ursidae (bear)[\\\\[83\\\\]](#_ftn83) family and mustelidae superfamily (containing, among others, badgers,[\\\\[84\\\\]](#_ftn84) otters,[\\\\[85\\\\]](#_ftn85) ferrets,[\\\\[86\\\\]](#_ftn86) weasels and wolverines).[\\\\[87\\\\]](#_ftn87)\\n\\n![Jonathan Othén, “Wolverine in Sweden”, Wikipedia, 2013 CE, CC BY-SA 4.0; “Badger”, pxhere.com, public domain; Dmitry Azovtsev,“Otters”, Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 3.0.](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\\\*LMyG295m1H_AvaXKc4Q7cA.png)\\n\\n![“Black-footed Ferret Learning to Hunt”, Wikipedia, USFWS Mountain-Prairie, 2013 CE, CC BY 2.0;Jean Beaufort, “GrizzlyBear”, Wikipedia,  public domain dedication.](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\\\*32GruXk1pKHanEuEo5hUkQ.png)\\n\\nFeliformia is a sub-order of carnivora that includes the wild cats (such as fossas,[\\\\[88\\\\]](#_ftn88) tigers, lions, leopards,[\\\\[89\\\\]](#_ftn89) cougars and cheetahs), as well as hyenas, mongooses and domesticated cats. The group apparently split from the canid species around 42 million years ago. Like wolves, some of the feline species have formed very close relationships with humans.\\n\\nAs with a great number of other animal groups, many of the wild cats are now extinct or critically endangered, including the South China tiger, the Balkan and Iberian lynx, the Asiatic and Northwest African cheetah, the Arabian, Sri Lankan and Amur leopards and the Barbary serval.[\\\\[90\\\\]](#_ftn90)\\n\\n![Chad Teer, “Cryptoprocta ferox”, Wikipedia, 2008 CE, CC BY 2.0; Charles J.

These are not safe, viable population numbers, especially given the risk of environmental damage to their homelands, continued hunting for meat and disease.
