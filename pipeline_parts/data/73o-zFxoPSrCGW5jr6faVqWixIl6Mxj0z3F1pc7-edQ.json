"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Possession is an extremely common topic in soccer discussion. It's almost a written arrangement: The best (and richest) teams in Europe -- think Manchester City, for one -- will dominate the ball and take it back the moment they lose it, while the lesser (and/or less monied) teams will have to make do without it.\\n\\nIn this, the age of Pep Guardiola, having the ball is tantamount to winning. If you know who had more of the ball over the course of a given season, you probably know who ended up with more of the points.\\n\\nPoints per game for teams with different possession rates in Europe's Big 5 leagues (2017-18 to present):\\n\\nOver 65% possession: 2.38 points per game\\n\\n60-65%: 2.04\\n\\n55-60%: 1.77\\n\\n50-55%: 1.51\\n\\n45-50%: 1.18\\n\\nUnder 45%: 1.04\\n\\nHog the ball, win trophies. Sounds downright orderly, yeah? But if you've ever actually watched a soccer match -- and if you're reading this, odds are good that you have -- you know that \\\"orderly\\\" isn't a very accurate way to describe the sport. For every long string of passes, there's a string of ineffective headers or a quick, long pass that goes awry.\\n\\nFor every run of order, there's a run of chaos.\\n\\n* ESPN+ viewers' guide: LaLiga, Bundesliga, MLS, FA Cup, more\\n* Stream ESPN FC Daily on ESPN+ (U.S. only)\\n* Don't have ESPN?

This Guardiola-n ideal of a squad enjoyed 71% possession, the highest of any Big 5 team in the last five seasons, and posted 100 points, the most in the history of the Premier League. They hogged the ball like few could ever dream, but only 48% of their possessions lasted more than 20 seconds, and 38% lasted under 10. Even the most organized City team on record was playing about half of a given match under reasonably chaotic circumstances.\\n\\nA healthy percentage of any match between any teams is spent in transition between attack and defense (or vice versa). Proper transition play isn't an equalizer, exactly. It can't make a bad team good, but it is the polish that can make a good team great. It can decide title races and relegation battles, too.\\n\\nFor the purposes of exploration, let's talk about a specific type of transition\\nLet's talk about the quick-burst possessions that occupy a solid portion of a given match: possessions that begin outside of the attacking third and last 20 or fewer seconds. These account for over 60% of the possessions in a given match, and most of them go absolutely nowhere.\\n\\nWhereas teams average about 0.13 shots per possession overall, these possessions -- we'll keep it simple and call them \\\"transition possessions\\\" for this story -- average just 0.05. Still, these possessions have accounted for 29% of all goals in Big 5 leagues over the past five seasons; they are specialized situations that can have more impact than set pieces (20% of all goals).\",\"timestamp\":1640307032,\"title\":\"How are Man City, Real Madrid so good?
