It’s a project from the team at [MoBA](https://t.co/5nLdaXPJl0?amp=1) - Makers of Blockchain Art. It’s a series I was introduced to through a conversation with [@BoredElonMusk](https://twitter.com/MobaGallery), and their place at the intersection of artificial intelligence, storytelling and conceptual art is thrilling.*\\n\\n*I caught up with **J** from the MoBA team to talk about the work and explore their concepts of what it means to be artists in the world of technology.*\\n\\n*[Note: Maxon Bollocks is still minting here.](https://maxonbollocks.com/)*\\n\\n### **Can you describe the genesis of the Maxon Bollocks project?**\\n\\nMaxon Bollocks originally stemmed from the question: \\\"Can we simulate, in hyper-speed, the life and death of an artist?\\\"\\n\\nBasically, we were fascinated by the potential for deep learning in generative neural networks – the idea that we could teach a machine to ‘dream’, and to be creative in its own right. To become an artist. \\n\\nAt the same time, we wanted to explore the mythology of canonized artists – that the life story and the mystique attached to artists become a critical element in the value of their work as time goes on. Take Jackson Pollock, the pioneering abstract painter, and target of ‘my toddler could paint that’ style criticism. Pollock defied all critics and has only grown more esteemed after his death, and the careful marketing and management of his estate by his widow. The name ‘Maxon Bollocks’ began as a playful homage to Pollock and his legacy.\\n\\nOur collective combined our engineering, art, and storytelling skills to try something new, and do a little myth-building around an artist and reflect artists' experiences in our community and the NFT space. So, that’s how it began – to tell a Frankenstein story about an artificial intelligence trained from ‘birth’ to be a great artist.  \\n\\n### **What are some examples of the Maxon Bollocks output that speak to you?**\\n\\nEverything that is produced is so fundamentally unique, I have an affinity for simplicity. But, also the bright obnoxious colors I love. Personally, I’m a fan of abstract – Pollock-inspired works. Others in the team prefer the gothic and slightly disturbing portraiture that the AI produced late in its simulated life and career.\\n\\n Within the growing community who have already minted their Maxons collectors are finding and holding works that speak to them, personally, which to my mind is the goal of any real art, so we’re thrilled about that.\\n\\n### **What was your role in putting the project together?**\\n\\nI was thinking about the NFT space as a whole and thought something of depth could be done. The potential to use NFTs in a more experience-based way – to take them beyond simple collectibles and add levels of tangible, cultural value – was very exciting to me.\\n\\nFrom there, I teamed up with the most creative people I know and really handed it across to evolve. \\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb63636a4-2cab-471e-80d2-8d4b4a7fd0b4\\\\_1024x1024.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb63636a4-2cab-471e-80d2-8d4b4a7fd0b4\\\\_1024x1024.png)\\n\\n### **How do you view the relationship between tech and art?**\\n\\nTechnology often drives art. We explore this in the story and in many cases artists or creatives often have the ability to predict the future of technology. Or even inspire it. \\n\\nMaybe the exciting lens is how art can drive technology. We can look at the effect that William Gibson or Neal Stephenson had on the language of the internet. We can talk about Asimov and his three rules and the development of AI or 'Back to the Future’ and the hoverboard.\\n\\nBut, maybe we miss the more direct impact, the tools being developed for artists to use and create. Which to older eyes, may seem sci-fi if you haven't used creative software for two decades. Even something as outwardly simple as Grammarly is actually a relatively complex and well-developed tool for writers. Blender or C4d or any of the 3d toolsets are endlessly complex pieces of software, and here too, the developers put new capabilities in the hands of creatives every year. When we look at it through this lens, the list of examples is extremely long.\\n\\nThe developers of these tools do so to support creatives and are built on the ambitions of artists. So the boundaries being expanded by this creative software can be state of the art, the vanguard of academic stuff, and an artistic intent drives it.\\n\\nSo when we talk about art's influence on technology, maybe we short-change it by only talking about 'Cyberspace', Star Trek communicators, or Tesla plaid mode.\\n\\nIts most significant effect is inspiring engineers to build tools for creators, which is pretty sci-fi sometimes (We still love William Gibson and Star Trek).\\n\\n### **Who were some artists who inspired you early on?**\\n\\nWu-Tang forever. As a team, we looked at those epochal artists – those visionaries who do something entirely new and change the game entirely, inspiring the next generation, and driving cultural change. Carravagio, Leonardo, all the modernists, from Picasso right through to Warhol. We were struck by how they were, in their own time, the product of amazing advancements in technology and culture – the way art and technology move in lockstep. So we wanted this project to pay homage to that idea.  \\n\\n### **How does this reflect your own interpretation of tokenized art production and its merits as a form of expression? **\\n\\nMaybe the community needs to settle on a better word than 'Token'; maybe this trivializes it.\\n\\nBut, its merits as a form of expression? Why are we always so defensive as a group? It's valid because we say it's valid, and the collectors and community say it's valid. Your crazy aunt Sylvia or your doctor don't have to 'get it’ for it to be a worthwhile expression and endeavor. Same with any artwork. Let ‘em smirk, leave them to Dilbert calendars and Cathy memorabilia; Ack.\\n\\nWe see it as an avenue of creative expression that reaches new audiences and breaks some boundaries that the traditional art market set up for itself. At its heart, it's driven by artists and engineers and offers new ways to develop ideas and deliver them to people without the funnels and barriers the art market has.\\n\\n### **What do you hope people get out of it?**\\n\\nAn experience. If they choose to explore the story of Maxon there are many insights, considerations, and musings on life, art, and our internal inner conflicts. If you read the story, the value of the art instantly increases, as the connections between the story and the NFT art you have invested in becoming clear. \\n\\nWe're looking to tell a story to begin with, and mirror it in our art. We also want to make some commentary about the market, to reflect on our community and art in general.\\n\\nIt’s our goal to bring generative art to an audience and deepen the audience's engagement with both art and narrative. We want people to see the possibilities for abstraction using these tools. We want our community to engage with the project as we use it to bring new ideas to the space. We hope they engage with our art and stick with us as we develop our voice.\\n\\n### **Do you have any future plans for Maxon Bollocks’ projects or expansions?**\\n\\nYes, we are focussing on maximizing the opportunity and experience of Maxon this will include a number of experiences for collectors, packed with ongoing benefits for holding the art. The fiscal value of owning a Maxon is a valuable asset, but that’s just the beginning.\\n\\nCollectors and community is our core focus. In creating something like nothing else out there, we are going to continue to push the boundaries in what is possible both from the storytelling aspect but also from a functional sense of the art. \\n\\nThe functionality of the art will become progressively sophisticated, almost a performance in itself. \\n\\nWe intend to expand the Maxon Bollocks project by growing our existing community and reaching new audiences. It comes from a community-first approach. We're working on some things to bring new ideas and experiences using this project, expanding the boundaries of storytelling and functionality.\\n\\nWe're just getting started. Watch this space. And get in on the ground floor. \\n\\n### **How important is the ability for artists to use technology for storytelling?**\\n\\nPeople can tell a story with some drums and a campfire, but they'll have a hard time doing that to a wide audience. It took technology to bring the oral histories of antiquity to the modern age – clay tablets, to parchment, to paper, to the printing press, to being able to download the entire Odyssey onto my phone to listen to it while I do the dishes. \\n\\nFilms, TV, and video games - it's baked in, without film stock, DV, microprocessors, those artforms just can exist. With emerging Web3 assets, new artforms will start to emerge. We are just taking the first steps here. \\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff74cd773-8783-4e48-b9c9-4d487a7e350d\\\\_1024x1024.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff74cd773-8783-4e48-b9c9-4d487a7e350d\\\\_1024x1024.png)\\n\\n### **Do you feel like there's a need for an artist and their audience to be on the same page in terms of technical knowledge?**\\n\\nIn some ways, no. In my opinion, great art is truly great when anyone can appreciate it. All the technical aspects of classical art – ratio, dynamics of sightlines, Fibonacci spirals, golden ratio – if you are trained in these aspects, it makes for a richer viewing experience on a technical level, but any layperson can walk past the Mona Lisa without knowing what any of those things mean and still appreciate it as a painting that slaps. The same is true of blockchain-driven artwork. \\n\\nWe have certainly tried to use Maxon as partly an education tool, unlike other GAN-backed projects which focus on producing a single result. Our collection demonstrates the gamut of the GAN from the very early stages right through to the more complex works it ends up producing. \\n\\nWe wrote an in-depth article on this and what we tried to achieve [here](https://maxonbollocks.com/the-gan-who-knew-too-much/).\\n\\nI think this kind of education is necessary, as it not only lifts up other artists in the space and gains more awareness for their work and the understanding of their work. But it allows the audience to be more comfortable and informed, curious about the mechanics.\\n\\nWe're evangelical about generative art and machine learning. We think it plays a role in the storytelling and awareness gives new light to the art. Our job is to manage the different avenues into the project and we hope that’s a process of discovery. It needs to work from whichever angle the audience comes at it from, including explaining the generative process. If they grok the project then we’re succeeding.  \\n\\n### **What are your preferred medium(s) to use as a platform for storytelling?**\\n\\nWe see that to be NFTs and I think everything we pursue that is creative, will have NFTs involved. It creates an experience of owning part of it, but also generating a community to propel the ideas, stories forward. \\n\\nWe come from an arts and engineering background, so our team has some experience in books, film, and visual media. Including online platforms and development, this is our first stab at bringing it to the NFT community. \\n\\n### **What do you think about the state of storytelling in NFTs?**\\n\\nIt is very early days. I am completely unaware of any other project like what we have completed, I’d say we are the first project that delivered a story that’s inextricable from, and a vital component of the NFTs.\\n\\nThere is another interesting group behind a project called Hail Draconis, who are working on an animated series. \\n\\nThere are some successful projects, and there are some excellent experiments and ideas being explored. Once someone cracks that wider audience, it's off to the races. We hope we see more of them.\\n\\n### **What is your perception of where Web3 assets are heading?**\\n\\nI think gamification is going to be huge. It just makes sense. \\n\\nI think it will take some time for it to cross over into more traditional and conservative industries. If we look at tokens as a whole, they have been fighting for credibility and widespread adoption for over a decade. \\n\\nThings take time. But it will be embraced in the most creative areas of our societies and then spread out from there. Which makes complete sense why art is at the forefront. \\n\\n### **What art do you like to collect on your own time?**\\n\\nFans of James Jean. One of us is knee-deep in CryptoKitties. Throw in Kozyndan and also John K animation cells. Sergio Aragones sketches, if I could afford them. We do not mind a bit of humor provided by the likes of CryptoLeos by David Gersch and internet history such as Nyan Cat. A couple of us have had tilts at some Ralph Steadman’s but our cupboards were bare.\\n\\nWe’re keeping our eyes open for other projects like ours – projects that push the functionality of NFTs and provide experiences for the collector. We’re building a larger ecosystem, and we’re looking for collaborators and innovators who are as excited by the space as we are.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633731666,\"title\":\"We Like Maxon Bollocks\"},\"digest\":\"OVa4bfg1yb8vAJqdwQbiKvi15jll2AOTi6aBva3Yuaw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xdEb3348Eb6fa98193cE2229a5B71175edb5F5f76\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_4UzcY_SrUdsK55e-hJh5v6U9EmmPZQzx7Ld4UH48gk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"P0MiRV0AwbmGsMNmnO1omIBEz6XLWNW2YrBpet8GbWU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ArxbirWq05UAwsPVSJlZpmuY_vRHGaWrkY4TU9ihyWkoaxdstblyuck1fZKvnPS0Ik1JNmhPfJiS0IIi8KWb4Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xac98ca7a572993673ccc0a1771d13723f9fdcbfb594442bee78cf8ba88ee632b70efbe4e536657a079bc5d5007e6adf6eda4f1f9fe1c1cbda658c127158434c41b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_4UzcY_SrUdsK55e-hJh5v6U9EmmPZQzx7Ld4UH48gk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"P0MiRV0AwbmGsMNmnO1omIBEz6XLWNW2YrBpet8GbWU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"OVa4bfg1yb8vAJqdwQbiKvi15jll2AOTi6aBva3Yuaw\"}"
