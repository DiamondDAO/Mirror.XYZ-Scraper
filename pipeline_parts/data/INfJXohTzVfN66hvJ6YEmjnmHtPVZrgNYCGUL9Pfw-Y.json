"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**NFTs are all the rage in 2021. But the headlines can be overwhelmingly about “Cryptopunk sells for 1.11 Million Dollars” or “Snoop Dogg puts 2 zillion bitcoins on a Bored Ape”. \\n  \\n This does make NFTs sound like only a playground for the rich celebrities and crypto-bros (that part does exist!), but there is much more to it – and you can be part of it too.   \\n  \\n I’d like to convince you that NFTs – if widely adopted – can fundamentally change the way people consume media and create new models for how content creators are paid.  \\n  \\n This is a soft landing for you to go from know zero to something. With some resources to get you started!**\\n\\n## 1) Erm…What is an NFT?\\n\\nI was afraid you’d not ask!\\n\\nNFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. “Non-Fungible” simply put, means “unique” or “irreplaceable”.\\n\\nIf you upload a photograph (Image X) that you own as an NFT (NFT Y), you’re telling the world that this particular NFT is an ORIGINAL copy of Image X.\\n\\nIf you sell that NFT to me for $10, I am now the new owner of that NFT. This certification of ownership can be checked on an “indestructible Excel sheet” (called the blockchain).\\n\\nThis NFT can be resold an unlimited amount of times. Built into many NFTs are royalty mechanisms called smart contracts that guarantee a royalty payment (for eg: 10%) back to the original creator - YOU.\\n\\nYes, anyone on the internet can copy Image X and upload it as an NFT (NFT Z). But that “indestructible Excel sheet” can quickly prove that NFT Z is not the original NFT Y uploaded by you.\\n\\nWith this, you can see that NFTs allow us to:\\n\\n* prove authenticity\\n* create a royalty system that rewards creators.\\n\\nNeed a better explanation?

(That’s his name because he owns Cryptopunk #6259) \\n  \\n \\n\\n## 2) Do I need to be savvy with crypto?\\n\\nYou don’t have to be an expert in trading crypto. You’d just have to understand how cryptocurrencies are used to mint (aka create) an NFT on the blockchain. \\n\\nJust think of crypto as a way for you to pay for your work to be minted, and to pay you when your work sells. \\n  \\n As with anything that has affects your personal finances, you need to tread safely. More on this below…\\n\\n## 3) What is the first step that I need to take?\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1638036242,\"title\":\"YOU’RE A CREATIVE. \\nYOU’RE NFT-CURIOUS.\\nOK, READ THIS ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️\"},\"digest\":\"3hWfyh2vHnP9EBvZ8KFrUrQST_6bvfW1I70kE-NSaes\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x075e309e2c901fc4Ec876d6655849835f6849A33\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Zs6Xl3uGBCnnRzZnbW9YSjWfmB0sQuVdDXyHsfEy03Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ta6Whf-mKwFuASPikzokqgWj6R4IQDyzQxb1ysEVMII\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"gft6iDDx2efCijyBM5ucZ4z0LPxMxQh5Xp33-Qtjys1q3uVW6Zk3YqxeXxECcaXcf9Kqkzj2Gvbw4MuOsaHOZw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x61c75d52c27d4b4a2a6c2348399527daed2e9316309cb8ce4292fb404c373b312ebf62f537f0be714c74751a81fcf703daee22ffe0243f78f998f889a1dea5161b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Zs6Xl3uGBCnnRzZnbW9YSjWfmB0sQuVdDXyHsfEy03Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ta6Whf-mKwFuASPikzokqgWj6R4IQDyzQxb1ysEVMII\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"3hWfyh2vHnP9EBvZ8KFrUrQST_6bvfW1I70kE-NSaes\"}"
