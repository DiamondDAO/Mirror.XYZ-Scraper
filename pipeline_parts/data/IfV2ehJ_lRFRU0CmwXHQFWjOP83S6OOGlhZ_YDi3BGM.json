"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"It was after they went to Mississippi to live.  The young man was engaged to be married to the young lady, and they sometimes called upon Margaret, driving over of afternoons in a buggy.  Edna was a little miss, just merging into her teens; and the realization that she herself was nothing, nothing, nothing to the engaged young man was a bitter affliction to her.  But he, too, went the way of dreams.\\n\\nShe was a grown young woman when she was overtaken by what she supposed to be the climax of her fate.  It was when the face and figure of a great tragedian began to haunt her imagination and stir her senses.  The persistence of the infatuation lent it an aspect of genuineness.  The hopelessness of it colored it with the lofty tones of a great passion.\\n\\nThe picture of the tragedian stood enframed upon her desk. Any one may possess the portrait of a tragedian without exciting suspicion or comment. (This was a sinister reflection which she cherished.) In the presence of others she expressed admiration for his exalted gifts, as she handed the photograph around and dwelt upon the fidelity of the likeness.  When alone she sometimes picked it up and kissed the cold glass passionately.\\n\\nHer marriage to Leonce Pontellier was purely an accident, in this respect resembling many other marriages which masquerade as the decrees of Fate.  It was in the midst of her secret great passion that she met him.  He fell in love, as men are in the habit of doing, and pressed his suit with an earnestness and an ardor which left nothing to be desired.  He pleased her; his absolute devotion flattered her.  She fancied there was a sympathy of thought and taste between them, in which fancy she was mistaken.  Add to this the violent opposition of her father and her sister Margaret to her marriage with a Catholic, and we need seek no further for the motives which led her to accept Monsieur Pontellier. for her husband.\\n\\nThe acme of bliss, which would have been a marriage with the tragedian, was not for her in this world.  As the devoted wife of a man who worshiped her, she felt she would take her place with a certain dignity in the world of reality, closing the portals forever behind her upon the realm of romance and dreams.\\n\\nBut it was not long before the tragedian had gone to join the cavalry officer and the engaged young man and a few others; and Edna found herself face to face with the realities.  She grew fond of her husband, realizing with some unaccountable satisfaction that no trace of passion or excessive and fictitious warmth colored her affection, thereby threatening its dissolution.\\n\\nShe was fond of her children in an uneven, impulsive way.  She would sometimes gather them passionately to her heart; she would sometimes forget them.  The year before they had spent part of the summer with their grandmother Pontellier in Iberville.  Feeling secure regarding their happiness and welfare, she did not miss them except with an occasional intense longing.  Their absence was a sort of relief, though she did not admit this, even to herself.  It seemed to free her of a responsibility which she had blindly assumed and for which Fate had not fitted her.\\n\\nEdna did not reveal so much as all this to Madame Ratignolle that summer day when they sat with faces turned to the sea.  But a good part of it escaped her.  She had put her head down on Madame Ratignolle's shoulder.  She was flushed and felt intoxicated with the sound of her own voice and the unaccustomed taste of candor. It muddled her like wine, or like a first breath of freedom.\\n\\nThere was the sound of approaching voices.  It was Robert, surrounded by a troop of children, searching for them.  The two little Pontelliers were with him, and he carried Madame Ratignolle's little girl in his arms.  There were other children beside, and two nurse-maids followed, looking disagreeable and resigned.\\n\\nThe women at once rose and began to shake out their draperies and relax their muscles.  Mrs. Pontellier threw the cushions and rug into the bath-house.  The children all scampered off to the awning, and they stood there in a line, gazing upon the intruding lovers, still exchanging their vows and sighs.  The lovers got up, with only a silent protest, and walked slowly away somewhere else.\\n\\nThe children possessed themselves of the tent, and Mrs. Pontellier went over to join them.\\n\\nMadame Ratignolle begged Robert to accompany her to the house; she complained of cramp in her limbs and stiffness of the joints. She leaned draggingly upon his arm as they walked.\\n\\nVIII\\n\\n\\\"Do me a favor, Robert,\\\" spoke the pretty woman at his side, almost as soon as she and Robert had started their slow, homeward way.  She looked up in his face, leaning on his arm beneath the encircling shadow of the umbrella which he had lifted.\\n\\n\\\"Granted; as many as you like,\\\" he returned, glancing down into her eyes that were full of thoughtfulness and some speculation.\\n\\n\\\"I only ask for one; let Mrs. Pontellier alone.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tiens!\\\" he exclaimed, with a sudden, boyish laugh. \\\"Voila que Madame Ratignolle est jalouse!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nonsense!  I'm in earnest; I mean what I say.  Let Mrs. Pontellier alone.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why?\\\" he asked; himself growing serious at his companion's solicitation.\\n\\n\\\"She is not one of us; she is not like us.  She might make the unfortunate blunder of taking you seriously.\\\"\\n\\nHis face flushed with annoyance, and taking off his soft hat he began to beat it impatiently against his leg as he walked.  \\\"Why shouldn't she take me seriously?\\\" he demanded sharply.  \\\"Am I a comedian, a clown, a jack-in-the-box?  Why shouldn't she?  You Creoles!  I have no patience with you!  Am I always to be regarded as a feature of an amusing programme?  I hope Mrs. Pontellier does take me seriously.  I hope she has discernment enough to find in me something besides the blagueur.  If I thought there was any doubt--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, enough, Robert!\\\" she broke into his heated outburst. \\\"You are not thinking of what you are saying.  You speak with about as little reflection as we might expect from one of those children down there playing in the sand.  If your attentions to any married women here were ever offered with any intention of being convincing, you would not be the gentleman we all know you to be, and you would be unfit to associate with the wives and daughters of the people who trust you.\\\"\\n\\nMadame Ratignolle had spoken what she believed to be the law and the gospel.  The young man shrugged his shoulders impatiently.\\n\\n\\\"Oh! well!  That isn't it,\\\" slamming his hat down vehemently upon his head.  \\\"You ought to feel that such things are not flattering to say to a fellow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Should our whole intercourse consist of an exchange of compliments?  Ma foi!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It isn't pleasant to have a woman tell you--\\\" he went on, unheedingly, but breaking off suddenly: \\\"Now if I were like Arobin-you remember Alcee Arobin and that story of the consul's wife at Biloxi?\\\"  And he related the story of Alcee Arobin and the consul's wife; and another about the tenor of the French Opera, who received letters which should never have been written; and still other stories, grave and gay, till Mrs. Pontellier and her possible propensity for taking young men seriously was apparently forgotten.\\n\\nMadame Ratignolle, when they had regained her cottage, went in to take the hour's rest which she considered helpful.  Before leaving her, Robert begged her pardon for the impatience--he called it rudeness--with which he had received her well-meant caution.\\n\\n\\\"You made one mistake, Adele,\\\" he said, with a light smile; \\\"there is no earthly possibility of Mrs. Pontellier ever taking me seriously.  You should have warned me against taking myself seriously.  Your advice might then have carried some weight and given me subject for some reflection.  Au revoir.  But you look tired,\\\" he added, solicitously.  \\\"Would you like a cup of bouillon? Shall I stir you a toddy?  Let me mix you a toddy with a drop of Angostura.\\\"\\n\\nShe acceded to the suggestion of bouillon, which was grateful and acceptable.  He went himself to the kitchen, which was a building apart from the cottages and lying to the rear of the house.  And he himself brought her the golden-brown bouillon, in a dainty Sevres cup, with a flaky cracker or two on the saucer.\\n\\nShe thrust a bare, white arm from the curtain which shielded her open door, and received the cup from his hands.  She told him he was a bon garcon, and she meant it. Robert thanked her and turned away toward \\\"the house.\\\"\\n\\nThe lovers were just entering the grounds of the pension. They were leaning toward each other as the wateroaks bent from the sea.  There was not a particle of earth beneath their feet.  Their heads might have been turned upside-down, so absolutely did they tread upon blue ether.  The lady in black, creeping behind them, looked a trifle paler and more jaded than usual.  There was no sign of Mrs. Pontellier and the children.  Robert scanned the distance for any such apparition.  They would doubtless remain away till the dinner hour.  The young man ascended to his mother's room.  It was situated at the top of the house, made up of odd angles and a queer, sloping ceiling.  Two broad dormer windows looked out toward the Gulf, and as far across it as a man's eye might reach.  The furnishings of the room were light, cool, and practical.\\n\\nMadame Lebrun was busily engaged at the sewing-machine.  A little black girl sat on the floor, and with her hands worked the treadle of the machine.  The Creole woman does not take any chances which may be avoided of imperiling her health.\\n\\nRobert went over and seated himself on the broad sill of one of the dormer windows.  He took a book from his pocket and began energetically to read it, judging by the precision and frequency with which he turned the leaves.  The sewing-machine made a resounding clatter in the room; it was of a ponderous, by-gone make.  In the lulls, Robert and his mother exchanged bits of desultory conversation.\\n\\n\\\"Where is Mrs. Pontellier?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Down at the beach with the children.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I promised to lend her the Goncourt.  Don't forget to take it down when you go; it's there on the bookshelf over the small table.\\\" Clatter, clatter, clatter, bang! for the next five or eight minutes.\\n\\n\\\"Where is Victor going with the rockaway?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The rockaway?  Victor?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes; down there in front.  He seems to be getting ready to drive away somewhere.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Call him.\\\"  Clatter, clatter!\\n\\nRobert uttered a shrill, piercing whistle which might have been heard back at the wharf.\\n\\n\\\"He won't look up.\\\"\\n\\nMadame Lebrun flew to the window.  She called \\\"Victor!\\\"  She waved a handkerchief and called again.  The young fellow below got into the vehicle and started the horse off at a gallop.\\n\\nMadame Lebrun went back to the machine, crimson with annoyance.  Victor was the younger son and brother--a tete montee, with a temper which invited violence and a will which no ax could break.\\n\\n\\\"Whenever you say the word I'm ready to thrash any amount of reason into him that he's able to hold.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If your father had only lived!\\\"  Clatter, clatter, clatter, clatter, bang!  It was a fixed belief with Madame Lebrun that the conduct of the universe and all things pertaining thereto would have been manifestly of a more intelligent and higher order had not Monsieur Lebrun been removed to other spheres during the early years of their married life.\\n\\n\\\"What do you hear from Montel?\\\"  Montel was a middleaged gentleman whose vain ambition and desire for the past twenty years had been to fill the void which Monsieur Lebrun's taking off had left in the Lebrun household.  Clatter, clatter, bang, clatter!\\n\\n\\\"I have a letter somewhere,\\\" looking in the machine drawer and finding the letter in the bottom of the workbasket. \\\"He says to tell you he will be in Vera Cruz the beginning of next month,\\\"-- clatter, clatter!--\\\"and if you still have the intention of joining him\\\"--bang! clatter, clatter, bang!\\n\\n\\\"Why didn't you tell me so before, mother?  You know I wanted--\\\"Clatter, clatter, clatter!\\n\\n\\\"Do you see Mrs. Pontellier starting back with the children? She will be in late to luncheon again.  She never starts to get ready for luncheon till the last minute.\\\" Clatter, clatter! \\\"Where are you going?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where did you say the Goncourt was?\\\"\\n\\nIX\\n\\nEvery light in the hall was ablaze; every lamp turned as high as it could be without smoking the chimney or threatening explosion. The lamps were fixed at intervals against the wall, encircling the whole room. Some one had gathered orange and lemon branches, and with these fashioned graceful festoons between.  The dark green of the branches stood out and glistened against the white muslin curtains which draped the windows, and which puffed, floated, and flapped at the capricious will of a stiff breeze that swept up from the Gulf.\\n\\nIt was Saturday night a few weeks after the intimate conversation held between Robert and Madame Ratignolle on their way from the beach.  An unusual number of husbands, fathers, and friends had come down to stay over Sunday; and they were being suitably entertained by their families, with the material help of Madame Lebrun.  The dining tables had all been removed to one end of the hall, and the chairs ranged about in rows and in clusters. Each little family group had had its say and exchanged its domestic gossip earlier in the evening.  There was now an apparent disposition to relax; to widen the circle of confidences and give a more general tone to the conversation.\\n\\nMany of the children had been permitted to sit up beyond their usual bedtime.  A small band of them were lying on their stomachs on the floor looking at the colored sheets of the comic papers which Mr. Pontellier had brought down.  The little Pontellier boys were permitting them to do so, and making their authority felt.\\n\\nMusic, dancing, and a recitation or two were the entertainments furnished, or rather, offered.  But there was nothing systematic about the programme, no appearance of prearrangement nor even premeditation.\\n\\nAt an early hour in the evening the Farival twins were prevailed upon to play the piano.  They were girls of fourteen, always clad in the Virgin's colors, blue and white, having been dedicated to the Blessed Virgin at their baptism.  They played a duet from \\\"Zampa,\\\" and at the earnest solicitation of every one present followed it with the overture to \\\"The Poet and the Peasant.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Allez vous-en!  Sapristi!\\\" shrieked the parrot outside the door.  He was the only being present who possessed sufficient candor to admit that he was not listening to these gracious performances for the first time that summer.  Old Monsieur Farival,\\n\\ngrandfather of the twins, grew indignant over the interruption, and insisted upon having the bird removed and consigned to regions of darkness.  Victor Lebrun objected; and his decrees were as immutable as those of Fate. The parrot fortunately offered no further interruption to the entertainment, the whole venom of his nature apparently having been cherished up and hurled against the twins in that one impetuous outburst.\\n\\nLater a young brother and sister gave recitations, which every one present had heard many times at winter evening entertainments in the city.\\n\\nA little girl performed a skirt dance in the center of the floor.  The mother played her accompaniments and at the same time watched her daughter with greedy admiration and nervous apprehension.  She need have had no apprehension.  The child was mistress of the situation.  She had been properly dressed for the occasion in black tulle and black silk tights.  Her little neck and arms were bare, and her hair, artificially crimped, stood out like fluffy black plumes over her head.  Her poses were full of grace, and her little black-shod toes twinkled as they shot out and upward with a rapidity and suddenness which were bewildering.\\n\\nBut there was no reason why every one should not dance. Madame Ratignolle could not, so it was she who gaily consented to play for the others.  She played very well, keeping excellent waltz time and infusing an expression into the strains which was indeed inspiring.  She was keeping up her music on account of the children, she said; because she and her husband both considered it a means of brightening the home and making it attractive.\\n\\nAlmost every one danced but the twins, who could not be induced to separate during the brief period when one or the other should be whirling around the room in the arms of a man.  They might have danced together, but they did not think of it.\\n\\nThe children were sent to bed.  Some went submissively; others with shrieks and protests as they were dragged away. They had been permitted to sit up till after the ice-cream, which naturally marked the limit of human indulgence.\\n\\nThe ice-cream was passed around with cake--gold and silver cake arranged on platters in alternate slices; it had been made and frozen during the afternoon back of the kitchen by two black women, under the supervision of Victor.  It was pronounced a great success--excellent if it had only contained a little less vanilla or a little more sugar, if it had been frozen a degree harder, and if the salt might have been kept out of portions of it.  Victor was proud of his achievement, and went about recommending it and urging every one to partake of it to excess.\\n\\nAfter Mrs. Pontellier had danced twice with her husband, once with Robert, and once with Monsieur Ratignolle, who was thin and tall and swayed like a reed in the wind when he danced, she went out on the gallery and seated herself on the low window-sill, where she commanded a view of all that went on in the hall and could look out toward the Gulf.  There was a soft effulgence in the east.  The moon was coming up, and its mystic shimmer was casting a million lights across the distant, restless water.\\n\\n\\\"Would you like to hear Mademoiselle Reisz play?\\\" asked Robert, coming out on the porch where she was.  Of course Edna would like to hear Mademoiselle Reisz play; but she feared it would be useless to entreat her.\\n\\n\\\"I'll ask her,\\\" he said.  \\\"I'll tell her that you want to hear her.  She likes you.  She will come.\\\" He turned and hurried away to one of the far cottages, where Mademoiselle Reisz was shuffling away.  She was dragging a chair in and out of her room, and at intervals objecting to the crying of a baby, which a nurse in the adjoining cottage was endeavoring to put to sleep.  She was a disagreeable little woman, no longer young, who had quarreled with almost every one, owing to a temper which was self-assertive and a disposition to trample upon the rights of others.  Robert prevailed upon her without any too great difficulty.\\n\\nShe entered the hall with him during a lull in the dance.  She made an awkward, imperious little bow as she went in.  She was a homely woman, with a small weazened face and body and eyes that glowed.  She had absolutely no taste in dress, and wore a batch of rusty black lace with a bunch of artificial violets pinned to the side of her hair.\\n\\n\\\"Ask Mrs. Pontellier what she would like to hear me play,\\\" she requested of Robert.  She sat perfectly still before the piano, not touching the keys, while Robert carried her message to Edna at the window.  A general air of surprise and genuine satisfaction fell upon every one as they saw the pianist enter.  There was a settling down, and a prevailing air of expectancy everywhere.  Edna was a trifle embarrassed at being thus signaled out for the imperious little woman's favor.  She would not dare to choose, and begged that Mademoiselle Reisz would please herself in her selections.\\n\\nEdna was what she herself called very fond of music.  Musical strains, well rendered, had a way of evoking pictures in her mind. She sometimes liked to sit in the room of mornings when Madame Ratignolle played or practiced.  One piece which that lady played Edna had entitled \\\"Solitude.\\\" It was a short, plaintive, minor strain.  The name of the piece was something else, but she called it \\\"Solitude.\\\" When she heard it there came before her imagination the figure of a man standing beside a desolate rock on the seashore.  He was naked.  His attitude was one of hopeless resignation as he looked toward a distant bird winging its flight away from him.\",\"timestamp\":1639988511,\"title\":\"At another time her affections were deeply engaged by a young gentleman who visited\"},\"digest\":\"ajjxv8joreok0w-HEwWGp2EbI96If0NpCQa4liHXpwE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9dA14EBFe3CfE059a88A873b83F5D7f596175316\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xgLQ4KTe5m1tnl9_Ove85AzSMZc5WmLKq3MIojJMAJE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"b70hID4S1d4pvhJO4zynBqvRLjGKqn12FXUD3BA6_r8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Du6CYBeL-l03kCOdHLIPB4MZH_JKhveYpysDZB6nBxu9nUt8D88K0dNbM_OKEcvY6K2s3Tl87md4prR7fvXjiQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1cc19b51ddaac205c2a998855d7cb6477286f585343bdc88dbcd11ab305182153babdd5128bafc4e4074e1d5c53aa95e0aca8dde255061017450d86fcb5b07d01c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xgLQ4KTe5m1tnl9_Ove85AzSMZc5WmLKq3MIojJMAJE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"b70hID4S1d4pvhJO4zynBqvRLjGKqn12FXUD3BA6_r8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ajjxv8joreok0w-HEwWGp2EbI96If0NpCQa4liHXpwE\"}"
