"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"From having only 12 teams in 2005, Major League Soccer is closing in on 30 teams before the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Expansion of the MLS means more rivalries so lets go through the 10 biggest rivalries in the league today.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Hudson River Derby\\n\\nThe New York derby between New York Red Bulls and New York City FC represents the largest city in America. Following the first ever derby in 2015, Red Bulls had cut the allocation of NYCFC fans by two-thirds for their next home game because of NYCFC fan behaviour that included throwing smoke bombs and flares onto the pitch. That set the tone for the Hudson River derby which the Red Bulls have so far dominated, including A 7-0 victory in 2016 for the Red Bulls in a game known as 'The Red Wedding'.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Atlantic Cup\\n\\nDC United and New York Red Bulls were always going to be rivals with strong Washington-New York rivalries in the NFL and NHL already in place. The Atlantic Cup has developed into one of the fiercest derbies in the MLS with both clubs having among the largest and oldest supporter groups in the league.\\n\\nThe pair have been going at it since 2002 and one of the most iconic moments was in 2006. After DC United's Alecko Eskandarian scored the first goal in a 4–1 win, he celebrated by taking a sip of a Red Bull energy drink and then spat it on the ground.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Canadian Classique\\n\\nCanadian clubs Toronto FC and CF Montreal compete in the heated Canadian Classique, also known as the Two Solitudes Derby or the 410 Derby. The two cities have been historical rivals in sports which is something that has translated over to the MLS.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Texas Derby\\n\\nThe winner of the Texas derby annual series between FC Dallas and Houston Dynamo takes home one of the most unique trophies in world soccer, a replica 18th century mountain howitzer cannon called the El Capitán. Despite the series starting back in 2006 the derby has been evenly matched. The rivalry is a bit more intense over social media than it is in the stands but the addition of Austin FC should raise the stakes in the state.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Battle of Cascadia\\n\\nOne of the most ferocious derbies in the MLS, the Seattle Sounders and Portland Timbers battle it out in a war between the two Pacific-Northwest giants. Considered one of the greatest rivalries in American soccer, it's atmosphere has been compared to English Premier League derbies. The two have been rivals since 1975 during the old NASL so have built up quite a storied history during their rivalry.\\n\\nViolence however is extremely rare between both sets of supporters but there is deep resentment between the two sets of fans with the teams facing frighteningly hostile receptions during away games. The attitude of the fans is shared among players on the pitch; former Timber's defender Scot Thompson and Sounders striker Roger Levesque playing out a fierce rivalry of their own.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Hell is Real Derby\\n\\nColumbus traditionally lacked a geographic rival prior to FC Cincinnati joining the league. The two battle it out in the Hell is Real Derby, also known as the Ohio derby, and is one of the newest derbies in the league with the first MLS match between FC Cincinnati and Columbus Crew played in 2019. The rivalry started a couple years earlier in the U.S. Open Cup with FC Cincinnati, a USL club at the time, upsetting the Crew who were playing a close to full strength side.\\n\\nThe derby name is no doubt the best in the league, originating from an Interstate 71 sign just south of Columbus that reads 'Hell is Real' when driving toward Cincinnati. While intended to encourage religious reflection, it's inspired the name for one of the biggest growing rivalries in the MLS.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## California Clásico\\n\\nThe LA Galaxy and San Jose Earthquakes participate in the California Clásico in a Northern California vs. Southern California matchup. Considered one of the most historical rivalries in the MLS it's also one of the most intense. The San Jose Ultras and Angel City Brigade supporter groups are among the most hated of rivals often taunting each other with huge tifos and chants.\\n\\nWhen the two teams play together there's a strong away team support resulting in heightened security to separate the two sets of supporters from fighting. One of the most controversial moments between the two rivals was off the pitch with the transfer of one of the greatest U.S players of all-time, Landon Donovan moving from San Jose to the LA Galaxy.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Rocky Mountain Cup\\n\\nThe Real Salt Lake and Colorado Rapids rivalry is one of the most underrated derbies. The Mountain West regional derby has been dominated by RSL since the cups creation in 2005 and there's been no shortage of drama. The clubs completed a player exchange before the start of the 2006 season with Rapids forward Jeff Cunningham and RSL midfielder Clint Mathis swapping sides.\\n\\nCunningham would haunt his former Colorado team with two goals and an assist during a 4-1 win that season. The Rapids would get their revenge later on in the year in a heated match. Fans threw debris and missiles onto the field throughout the game which Colorado would end up winning and retaining the Rocky Mountain Cup. Rapids captain Pablo Mastroeni further ignited the derby by celebrating and taunting Salt Lake fans following their win.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## El Trafico\\n\\nThe rivalry between the two Los Angeles based clubs LA Galaxy and LAFC is one of two crosstown derbies in the MLS alongside New York's Hudson River derby. The derby name references the notorious traffic congestion in LA with the two clubs separated by a 12-mile stretch of freeway. The derby name is also a play on the El Clásico derby between Real Madrid and Barcelona.\\n\\nThe first MLS meeting between the clubs in 2018 set the tone for the derby. After LAFC built a 3-0 lead, the Galaxy's Zlatan Ibrahimović inspired a comeback off the bench in his first ever MLS game, scoring two goals including a stoppage time winner in a 4-3 victory.\\n\\nEven before the derby began on the pitch there was already bad blood off it between both sets of supporters. In 2017 shortly after LAFC's creation, a mural in the clubs colours was painted in downtown Los Angeles. Months later the mural was vandalized to read 'GALAXY' and was done in retaliation to a Galaxy billboard being defaced.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Precourt Derby\\n\\nOk I've made this one up but there's the potential for a genuine rivalry between Columbus Crew and Austin FC. Investor Anthony Precourt once owned the Crew but announced plans in 2017 to relocate the club to Austin as Columbus wouldn't publicly fund a new stadium.\\n\\nThere was a massive outcry from MLS fans and fortunately, Pete Edwards partnered with Jimmy and Dee Haslam to save the Crew in 2019. Bizarrely, Precourt was rewarded with an MLS expansion franchise in Austin despite his tactics and Crew fans won't forget Precourt holding the club hostage.\",\"timestamp\":1639178201,\"title\":\"Top 10 Biggest MLS Rivalries Revealed\"},\"digest\":\"wJ1JTWY0WDjr9Km7madXWpheKue3qBs8LmjNOkKhLAI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x239734245217b5aE0FB74D5a712cF823f471A2aE\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PzJV8XzNP88exDC2cw6BcH_2EexPpnutl4bS85c5s84\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"61hXmm9we8NxNgeqhRiOxtuwsS6Wpas3ZHt9x-zU_uw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"UejHuHJo2B0j0OAmf-SuDkZDIJCwGBCHCXPDQOLIc_NRQifiQuX_am0JALV4eE1h3zQDHAkYBIwHDs_cnDKo4g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x57c5b347940c3a4e83481cd494db6db2003f5ff5d819fd41b0f112dde240954c583474f9d8316a5084e18bd2fd215a155e4502c95933640d9d617805429d3ea21b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PzJV8XzNP88exDC2cw6BcH_2EexPpnutl4bS85c5s84\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"61hXmm9we8NxNgeqhRiOxtuwsS6Wpas3ZHt9x-zU_uw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wJ1JTWY0WDjr9Km7madXWpheKue3qBs8LmjNOkKhLAI\"}"
