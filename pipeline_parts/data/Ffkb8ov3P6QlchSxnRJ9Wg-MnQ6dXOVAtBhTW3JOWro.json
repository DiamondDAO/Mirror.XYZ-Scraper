"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Round 2 is complete and PaperclipDAO has obtained a Cryptopunk and some Meebit to boot! We acquired [CryptoPunk #3744](https://opensea.io/assets/0xb7f7f6c52f2e2fdb1963eab30438024864c313f6/3744) (long known as the ‚ÄúPaperclip Punk‚Äù) and a portion of a [Dissected Meebit](https://opensea.io/assets/0xc36442b4a4522e871399cd717abdd847ab11fe88/113567) from Calvin Liu who gets a [1/5 SE Earthen Concept Art Card](https://opensea.io/assets/0x76be3b62873462d2142405439777e971754e8e77/42) and 400 $CLIP in return.

We care about more than just the economic value of a trade; we value the culture, story, and journey of the NFT as well. In Round 1, we picked the future. But the past always has a way of coming back around‚Ä¶ And the 2 (ok 1.02) historic LarvaLabs NFTs we acquired bridge the past to the future beautifully.\\n\\nThis decision wasn‚Äôt easy; we received incredible offers and, as in Round 1, were sad to part with all the memorable NFTs that we couldn‚Äôt accept. Check out the full [Round 2 offer thread](https://discord.gg/ePU79bhBjs) to see all the amazing offers.\\n\\nWe only have time to highlight a few of our favorites. In no particular order, here is our homage to the ones that got away in Round 2:\\n\\n* Several offers paid homage to @paperclipDAO.

What an awesome gesture! We were also offered a [$CLIP Kitty](https://opensea.io/assets/0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d/906847) by AnimalTPFR ([discord link](https://discord.com/channels/874453658425757729/874453942279495680/875903985746346004)).\\n* We received several offers for [Blitmaps](https://www.blitmap.com), a really cool community started by [Dom Hofmann](https://twitter.com/dhof). Blitmaps and their metadata are stored and processed entirely on-chain.

The [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://twitter.com/BoredApeYC) NFTs double as a PFP and a Yacht Club membership (aka a swamp club for Apes). We received a few other offers for PFPs: [Sisyphus](https://twitter.com/0xSisyphus) offered a crowned [Pudgy Penguin](https://opensea.io/assets/0xbd3531da5cf5857e7cfaa92426877b022e612cf8/2251) and state ([discord link](https://discord.com/channels/874453658425757729/874453942279495680/877032545064222740)) offered a bundle of a [classy pengu](https://opensea.io/assets/0xbd3531da5cf5857e7cfaa92426877b022e612cf8/2120) & [classy meeb](https://opensea.io/assets/0x7bd29408f11d2bfc23c34f18275bbf23bb716bc7/4875).\\n* We already mentioned our beloved CryptoPunk #3744 but we also received an incredible offer from [Andy8052](https://twitter.com/andy8052) for [80,000 $DEAD tokens](https://fractional.art/vaults/0x0C7060BF06a78AAAAB3fac76941318A52a3F4613) (currently valued at $200,000) which represent 6.66% of [Zombie Punk #2066](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/2066), ([link to discord](https://discord.com/channels/874453658425757729/874453942279495680/877652589326508052)).\\n* Mr. bulldops offered the [0xmons Dza](https://opensea.io/assets/0x0427743df720801825a5c82e0582b1e915e0f750/170) ([discord link](https://discord.com/channels/874453658425757729/874453942279495680/877697951575732224)), a Lovecraftian ‚Äúpixel monster‚Äù generated by a neural net. Though we find it hard to believe that the artist behind this amazing project is the same 0xmons who created our beloved sudoswap, we have been assured this is actually the case.\\n* We were also offered a [FuckinTroll](https://opensea.io/assets/0x240eb6b465f61dfc965053791f963cd0f0e4fdb0/1933), a [Shiny Nyan Cat](https://opensea.io/assets/0xb32979486938aa9694bfc898f35dbed459f44424/7) ([discord link](https://discord.com/channels/874453658425757729/874453942279495680/877687465664733214)), several [Treeverse plots](https://twitter.com/TheTreeverse), and a few [RTFKT](https://twitter.com/RTFKTstudios) NFTs.

Cliff proposed that this swap would represent a unique intersection of PaperclipDAO, Parallel, Matt Furie, POAP, Metaverse DAO, and Cryptovoxels, forming a beautiful bond of NFT history ([discord link](https://discord.com/channels/874453658425757729/874453942279495680/877624309340864573)).\\n\\nEach of these offers adds to the storied history of the PaperclipDAO and we couldn‚Äôt be more excited to add our second trade to the history books.
