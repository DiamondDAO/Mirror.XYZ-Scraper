FAQ at the bottom.*\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*kctzSaGOmCA-mNcq7944UQ.png)\\n\\n**UPDATE: Links to Access Auction starting December 1st at 3pm EST**\\n\\n*   To transact on Ethereum Mainnet**: **[**Ethereum Mainnet Auction**](https://copperlaunch.com/auctions/0x327C7cb1Ad72216ac90988FaE4960Bc2d5EF9738)\\n*   To transact on Polygon Network: [**Polygon Network Auction**](https://polygon.copperlaunch.com/auctions/0xd153e1de63b478213b7b62bf47dcc4099608b1ae)\\n\\nWe are less than 48 hours away from the fair launch of the humanDAO ($HDAO) token. This will be the first opportunity for the public to purchase $HDAO and participate in the governance. In this post we will guide you through the required steps, parameters and 20% rewards bonus program for participating in the public launch.\\n\\n***Please note: the contract address and official links to auction will be shared through our official channels only. Nobody will DM you nor can you purchase $HDAO tokens prior to the auction. Our site will hold the link to the actual Auction pages. Never give your private keys/passphrase to anyone, ever.***\\n\\n> **Token Contract: 0xdac657ffd44a3b9d8aba8749830bf14beb66ff2d**\\n\\n**Why Launch Through LBP on Copper?**\\n\\nThere will be an option to participate in the auction from the Polygon chain or Ethereum Mainnet. You will need to have $ETH, $DAI, $WETH or $USDC on Ethereum Mainnet or $WETH, $Matic and $USDC on Polygon chains. Given our commitment to serve our community of both early crypto adopters and also[ underserved crypto communities](https://medium.com/@TheHumanDAO/degen-meets-do-good-92cd80ffba2e), we wanted to make the launch as broad and accessible as possible. ETH gas fees are not accessible for many, thus the Polygon option.\\n\\nCopper facilitates Token Launch Auctions (TLAs), which are a specific configuration of Balancer’s Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBP). Read more about LBPs [here](https://docs.balancer.fi/products/balancer-pools/liquidity-bootstrapping-pools-lbps). Copper is “the most open and user-friendly way to participate in a fair token launch auction.” Read more about Copper [here](https://docs.alchemist.wtf/copper/). TLA is a permissionless price discovery mechanism that enables projects and ideas from across the world to fairly launch a token and have the public participate without barriers.\\n\\n> The value of launching on Copper is that we can offer opportunities for participants to leverage both the Mainnet and L2. Those who prefer transacting on ETH Mainnet and don’t mind the gas fees can do so. Those who can’t afford or prefer not to pay Mainnet gas fees can participate on L2 (Polygon). Below we will outline the details.\\n\\n## 20% Public Token Sale Reward Program\\n\\nAs we mentioned before, we skipped pre-seed and private sales in favor of keeping the tokens in the HDAO community. Instead we are rewarding all of our early adopters who participate in the public token launch. 10M tokens will be used in a 20% rewards bonus program for everyone participating. For example, If you purchase 100 tokens, you will receive 20 bonus tokens in a post-launch airdrop. **Only those addresses that took place in the auction will be able to claim bonus rewards and must still be holding $HDAO tokens. The exact date of this bonus claim is unknown as we work on the smart contracts, but expect within 2 weeks of the auction ending.**\\n\\n## How to Participate on Ethereum Mainnet\\n\\n*For beginners, the first step is to set up a wallet. We recommend MetaMask For detailed instructions on how to do this, please click *[*here*](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/360002198491-Getting-Started).\\n\\n**Step 1 **Transfer $ETH, $DAI, $WETH or $USDC into your MetaMask wallet from an exchange or use any Ethereum wallet.\\n\\n**Step 2 **With $ETH, $DAI, $WETH or $USDC in your Ethereum wallet, visit [Copper Auction Page](https://copperlaunch.com/auctions) to participate in the $HDAO token launch. Our name will be added to the drop down menu and stay tuned for the official link through Twitter and our site.\\n\\nAlthough this method is more convenient, it has higher fees compared to a layer 2 like Polygon.\\n\\n## How to Participate on Polygon Sidechain\\n\\n**TL;DR Version**\\n\\n1.  You willneed $WETH, $Matic or $USDC on Polygon Network to participate.\\n2.  There are 2 key steps to get your assets on Polygon: a) bridge asset(s) to Polygon Network using the Polygon [bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge/). b) add the Polygon Network to your wallet (MetaMask).\\n3.  You can bridge any major token(s) to the Polygon network through their bridge.\\n4.  If you are not using a CEX, we recommend swapping your asset(s) on the Polygon Network THEN using a DEX or Metamask swap to reduce fees.\\n5.  **You need $MATIC in your wallet to pay for gas fees on the Polygon Network.**\\n\\n## To Participate in Auction on Polygon\\n\\nOn Polygon, $MATIC is used to pay gas fees and interact with the Polygon chain. It’s the same as having $ETH in your Ethereum Mainnet wallet to interact with the network. The extra steps it takes to prepare your funds on the Polygon network are worth the time as fees are reduced to less than a dollar. In order to participate in the auction, you will need to have $WETH, $Matic or $USDC.\\n\\nIf you have access to $WETH, $Matic or $USDC on a centralized exchange, that’s great. **However, if you don’t already have USDC, we recommend that you first bridge your asset(s) (ETH, Chainlink, USDT, etc.) to the Polygon chain in the steps provided below. Once you have bridged your asset(s), THEN make the swap to $WETH, $Matic or $USDC on the Polygon Network through Uniswap, Balancer, or your Metamask wallet.**\\n\\n## If Buying & Sending $MATIC\\n\\nAgain, you can use fiat to buy $MATIC on a CEX like Coinbase (or any exchange with $MATIC). Most of these exchanges will keep your $MATIC tokens on the Ethereum Mainnet, not on the Polygon chain.\\n\\nHowever, if outside the US, Binance allows you to withdraw directly to the polygon network. To withdraw MATIC directly from Binance to Polygon, follow the steps below:\\n\\n*   Go to the withdraw Crypto page, select MATIC(Polygon) as the token you want to withdraw. Input your Polygon wallet address in the address field.\\n*   Click the drop down arrow in the network field. A list of networks will appear. Select $MATIC (Polygon).\\n*   Enter the amount of $MATIC you want to withdraw in the amount field.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*SGwH2uupijziYNW\\\\_)\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*SZ9RDVQ_x\\\\_1Zc6UY)\\n\\nWhen buying $MATIC on other exchanges, a few additional steps are required to bridge the tokens over to the MATIC to use in the Token Launch Auction.\\n\\nWhen you purchase your $MATIC tokens like you would any other token on CEX, you’ll then want to withdraw the tokens to your MetaMask wallet.\\n\\nOnce you’ve sent $MATIC to MetaMask, you’ll need to add/import the $MATIC token to have your Metamask read the token and show the balance. To add the MATIC token click ‘import tokens’ at the bottom of your MetaMask wallet and search for ‘Matic Network Token ($MATIC).’\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0\\\\*n8mIfI8WMJIxKXp\\\\_)\\n\\nOnce you add the token, you should be able to see the amount of MATIC you sent on the Ethereum Mainnet.\\n\\n## Moving Asset(s) to Polygon Chain\\n\\nNow we need to move the $MATIC tokens (or any token you have) onto the Polygon chain. Moving assets from one blockchain to another is called bridging, and Polygon provides a[ bridge tool](https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge) to easily move your assets from Ethereum Mainnet to Polygon Mainnet. Make sure you have ‘Matic Token’ (or the correct token) selected in the dropdown.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0\\\\*HhACiZHD9iHmAzd\\\\_)\\n\\n## Setup MetaMask to connect to MATIC Network\\n\\n## The Easy Way\\n\\nIn order to add Polygon Mainnet (MATIC) to MetaMask,[ go to chainlist.org and search for Polygon](https://chainlist.org/). You’ll find the search bar in the middle of the page. This will automatically add the custom RPC (Remote Procedural Call) to your wallet.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1394/0\\\\*syobmJmJlKtho9F9)\\n\\n## The Manual Way\\n\\nIf Chainlist isn’t working for you there is a manual way to set up your Metamask wallet to connect to Polygon Network by adding the custom RPC, here are the steps:\\n\\n## On Desktop\\n\\nAt the top of your MetaMask wallet, switch the connected blockchain by clicking on the tab ‘Main Ethereum Network.’\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/878/0\\\\*eh575qi1kfhw2S6u)\\n\\nScroll down until you find ‘Custom RPC.’\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/648/0\\\\*XCMYRycukUxLUs9q)\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/706/0\\\\*pw5VMFiOkkqccpAs)\\n\\nEnter in the Matic Mainnet settings as follows:\\n\\n*   Network Name: Polygon\\n*   New RPC URL:[ https://polygon-rpc.com](https://polygon-rpc.com/)\\n*   ChainID: 137\\n*   Symbol: MATIC\\n*   Block Explorer URL:[ https://polygonscan.com/](https://polygonscan.com/)\\n*   You have now connected to the MATIC Mainnet with your Metamask Wallet!\\n\\n## On the Mobile App\\n\\nYou will need to go to your Metamask wallet settings, then choose Networks, then Add Network.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*FvH_WGL8bHxjwmbC)\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*QjcHtlhyfnkOcLErJ8uCpg.jpeg)\\n\\nThen input the required data:\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/706/0\\\\*2bMqLhE60kIqsZcr)\\n\\nEnter in the Matic Mainnet settings as follows:\\n\\n*   Network Name: Polygon\\n*   New RPC URL:[ https://polygon-rpc.com](https://polygon-rpc.com/)\\n*   ChainID: 137\\n*   Symbol: MATIC\\n*   Block Explorer URL:[ https://polygonscan.com/](https://polygonscan.com/)\\n*   You have now connected to the MATIC Mainnet with your Metamask Wallet.\\n\\n## Swap Your Assets in MetaMask\\n\\nFinally, you’re ready to swap your assets ($ETH, $USDT, etc.) to $WETH, $Matic or $USDC. Simply click ‘Swap’ while in the Matic Network screen of your MetaMask Wallet.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/712/0\\\\*t0MdIo_HZtmLwyMx)\\n\\nEnter the amount of the asset you would like to swap for $WETH, $Matic or $USDC. If you choose $WETH or $USDC, be sure to reserve some $Matic to pay gas fees for transactions and the auction.\\n\\nIf you accidentally use all of your $Matic or have none we will be providing a ‘faucet’ to receive enough $Matic to cover transaction fee (we will update this post with the link prior to launch).\\n\\nThere’s no need to adjust the advanced options. Click ‘Review Swap,’ and then ‘Swap.’\\n\\nYou’ll now see your assets on the Polygon network under the Assets tab when your transaction is confirmed.\\n\\n## Participating in the Token Launch Auction on Copper\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*ab6NjPXmtFXkE9Gi)\\n\\nNow that you’ve got your funds prepared, you’re ready to go to[ Copper](https://copperlaunch.com/), connect your wallet, and participate in the $HDAO launch on December 1st. If you’ve swapped tokens on a DEX before, you’ll be familiar with the general interface, but if you’d like a preview of the Copper experience,[ check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb_IhYigoLo).

Available options are MetaMask, Gnosis Safe, WalletConnect and Ledger.\\n\\n**Which cryptocurrencies do I need for the BLBP?**\\n\\nIn order to participate in the LBP, you need the following tokens:\\n\\nEthereum Mainnet: $ETH, $DAI, $WETH or $USDC to purchase HDAO tokens + $ETH for gas fees\\n\\nPolygon Network: $WETH, $Matic or $USDC to purchase HDAO tokens + $MATIC for gas fees.\\n\\n**At what price level should I start buying?**\\n\\nAt the bottom we have included some scenarios of LBP auctions. We can’t give advice as to how much, when or in what way you should be investing. Remember, that the price on a LBP will gradually decrease when no buys occur but it can also be the case that large volume buys cause the price to quickly increase.\\n\\n**What is the minimum amount I can buy?**\\n\\nThere is no minimum amount of $HDAO tokens that you have to buy. It’s completely up to you to choose how much you want to buy at the price that’s available at that time.\\n\\n**Will there be a lockup period for $HDAO purchased in the LBP?**\\n\\n$HDAO tokens purchased in the LBP will be freely tradable immediately after the sale as they arrive in your wallet straight after swapping.\\n\\n**Are there any other unlocked tokens?**\\n\\nThe LBP will be the first opportunity to purchase the $HDAO token.\\n\\n**What can I do with my $HDAO tokens after the LBP?**\\n\\nWe aim to launch our staking contracts shortly after the LBP. Anyone who holds $HDAO tokens will be able to stake their tokens for additional rewards. On top of that, the $HDAO token holds your voting rights in humanDAO. Governance forum and voting will be launched in the very near future.\\n\\n**What was HDAO’s seed round price?**\\n\\nThere was no seed round or private sales.\\n\\n**When will HDAO be open for trading post LBP?**\\n\\n$HDAO will be available to trade directly when acquired in the LBP — no constraints. The liquidity mining programs and staking where you can use your $HDAO will start after the LBP. Stay posted for more info.\\n\\n**Once LBP is over, will there be a Uniswap/SushiSwap/Balancer pool to trade our HDAO tokens in?**\\n\\nYes, there will be incentivised AMMs/trading pools as part of the liquidity mining program that you can trade $HDAO with.\\n\\n**What are the tokenomics?**\\n\\nCheck out this Medium article: [The HDAO Token & Network](https://medium.com/@TheHumanDAO/the-hdao-token-network-5aeee6dceeea)\\n\\n**What’s HDAO’s max supply?**\\n\\nThe max supply is 1,000,000,000.\\n\\n**Will HDAO be deployed on Ethereum or Polygon?**\\n\\nParticipants have the option to choose which chain they will purchase $HDAO on. The actual token deployment/generation is on Ethereum Mainnet.\\n\\n**When will we be able to claim rewards?**\\n\\n**Only the addresses that took place in the auction will be able to claim bonus rewards and must still be holding $HDAO tokens.** The exact date of this bonus claim is unknown as we work on the smart contracts, but expect within 2 weeks of the auction ending.\\n\\n**Someone claiming to be a team member asked me to register my wallet using some external link or send them some crypto to take part in a presale**\\n\\nPlease only use official channels as there are a lot of scam links floating around at the moment. There is no presale and the $HDAO token will be distributed throughthe LBP. Team members will never DM you first about the LBP.\\n\\n## How does price discovery on LBP Work\\n\\nDue to the downward shifting weights over time, there is a natural downward selling pressure on the price throughout the duration of the pool that would be offset by the inflow of USDC into the pool.\\n\\nHere are some price discovery curves of other LBP launches.\\n\\n**$PERP**\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1316/0\\\\*FkLuVsyQ1UQQj-J\\\\_)\\n\\n**$GRO**\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*8uPBTTmYKl8tFUqK)\\n\\n**$MC (Merit Circle — similar business model)**\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*IFLcVOSdoPb0Fzgx)\\n\\n**About HumanDAO**\\n\\n*At humanDAO we are setting out to create a public good.
