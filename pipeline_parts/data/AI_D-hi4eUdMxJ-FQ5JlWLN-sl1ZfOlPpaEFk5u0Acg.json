"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*nJghDydo6zVq8hGH.jpg)\\n\\nHey friends üëã\\n\\nIf you‚Äôve been following along with the blog you‚Äôll know I‚Äôm a big fan of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the way it opens up the doors for everyday people to participate in the formerly classist, elitist, and, let‚Äôs not forget opaque (‚â† transparent) world of finance üè¶\\n\\nEverything from the way we **trade**, **remit**, **lend and borrow**, **save**, and **invest** are being entirely rebuilt on the principles of open source and stakeholder value ü§ù But it doesn‚Äôt end at finance. Blockchain technology opens to the doors to new ways of connecting. We can connect ownership (including history of ownership) to everything from global currencies (stablecoins); art, collectibles, and in-game items (NFTs); even voting share of an organization (governance tokens) üó≥\\n\\nThat last one is what we‚Äôre going to be talking about today. You see, one of the ideas pushing forward the world of decentralized finance is the idea of the **DAO**.\\n\\n## Decentralized. Autonomous. Organization.\\n\\nThe name says it all. DAOs aim to remove hierarchical structure and thus centralized risk (read consolidation of power). They are, in essence, an evolution of the **[cooperative](https://ncbaclusa.coop/resources/what-is-a-co-op/).**\\n\\nHere‚Äôs an excerpt from **[Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/)** that I think succinctly defines the concept of a DAO:\\n\\n> *DAOs are an effective and safe way to work with like-minded folks around the globe.*\\n>\\n> *Think of them like an internet-native business that‚Äôs collectively owned and managed by its members. They have built-in treasuries that no one has the authority to access without the approval of the group. Decisions are governed by proposals and voting to ensure everyone in the organisation has a voice.*\\n>\\n> *There‚Äôs no CEO who can authorise spending based on their own whims and no chance of a dodgy CFO manipulating the books. Everything is out in the open and the rules around spending are baked into the DAO via its code.*\\n\\nBut who gets to vote? üßê\\n\\nThe most common method of gaining votes is to own **[governance tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance-token)**. You can buy the tokens on the market, or earn them through the protocol. You may also earn them by working for the DAO and earning some form of compensation or grant üí∞\\n\\nHere‚Äôs another excerpt from [Ethereum.org](http://ethereum.org/):\\n\\n> *Token-based membership Usually fully permissionless, depending on the token used. Mostly these governance tokens can be traded for permissionlessly on a decentralized exchange. Others must be earned through providing liquidity or some other ‚Äòproof of work‚Äô. Either way, simply holding the token grants access to voting.*\\n>\\n> Typically used for more closer-knit, human-centric organizations like charities, worker collectives, and investment clubs. Can also govern protocols and tokens as well.\\n\\nNow this is far from a perfect system, and Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum‚Äôs cofounder has recently been **[promoting the idea that innovations are needed](https://decrypt.co/69979/vitalik-buterin-talks-nfts-daos-defi-and-the-next-billion-ethereum-users)** to further decentralize and democratize governance üí° But there is an upside to token voting which is that one has to be invested in the project enough to feel that the tokens they bought will remain worthwhile, hence, buying a huge amount of tokens just to vote for a proposal that cripples the protocol will likely tank the value of the tokens. Not exactly in their best interest if you ask me üßê\\n\\nAnd besides, for the time being, it‚Äôs the best solution we‚Äôve come up with.\\n\\n## Maker‚Äôs DAOzen\\n\\nOne of the most famous DAOs is **[MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/en/)**, the creators of the Dai stablecoin, which I‚Äôve **[written about before](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/thumbsupfinance/kyc-how-stable-are-you)**. MakerDAO is governed by the MKR governance token. If you‚Äôd like to learn about how governance at MakerDAO works, there‚Äôs plenty of fantastic information available **[here](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/)**. But the key takeaway is that the fourth largest stablecoin by market cap and the only decentralized stablecoin amongst those four, is governed entirely via this DAO üôå\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*wQ8EbGZkyWpPY9o7.png)\\n\\n(Source: **[Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/stablecoins/)**)\\n\\nThat‚Äôs pretty cool if you ask me.\\n\\nBut this post is not about MakerDAO. In fact, I don‚Äôt even hold MKR ‚Äî except in within my **[DeFi Pulse Index ($DPI)](https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi)** tokens ‚Äî but I do hold one governance token: POOL.\\n\\n## Pooling Together\\n\\nIf you‚Äôve been following along with the blog then you probably already know a bit about PoolTogtether, as it is literally my favourite DeFi protocol. Built on one of the best ideas of all time ‚Äî Prize Linked Savings Accounts ‚Äî PoolTogether allows people to participate in a sort of no-loss lottery where just for saving their money, they have a chance to win prizes üé∞\\n\\nThis works a lot like a regular savings account. Only instead of each depositor receiving a small amount of interest, all of the yield from the deposits is pooled to pay out weekly (or in some cases daily) prizes. Everyone keeps their original deposit, plus any winnings they may have üí∞\\n\\n**But** **why are the prizes so big?**\\n\\nWhether or not you realize this, when you deposit money in a bank, they don‚Äôt just hold it there. Instead they lend your money to others (or in some cases invest it), to earn interest. Then they keep the majority of that interest and pay you usually well under 1%\\n\\nAs I‚Äôve written about before, DeFi protocols strip away these greedy middlemen, leaving you with far higher returns. In fact DeFi protocols like Compound or Aave can regularly return 3‚Äì5% or more on stablecoins üíµ Apply these kinds of returns, to large pools of deposits, and the prizes can be really impressive.\\n\\nOh and by the way, a new version of PoolTogether is rolling out now that makes the system even better, with more prizes, across multiple blockchains, and mechanisms to prevent large depositors from winning too frequently. But I‚Äôm going to do a post all about that üåäüèÜ\\n\\nFor today, let‚Äôs get back to talking about Governance.\\n\\n## Participating in PoolTogether Policy\\n\\nPoolTogether is an open-source and decentralized protocol or what many would describe as a DAO (although that term is used to describe many differing models). Essentially this means that the users govern the protocol and vote on changes üó≥\\n\\nHere‚Äôs how PoolTogether‚Äôs co-founder Leighton Cusack describes the structure:\\n\\n> *Control of the PoolTogether Protocol rests solely in the hands of the community holding the POOL tokens. This is a revolutionary new way of organizing and it takes some education.*\\n>\\n> *\\\\[‚Ä¶\\\\]*\\n>\\n> *Changes to the protocol are submitted as governance proposals. Anyone who either holds 10,000 POOL tokens (0.1% of total supply) OR has 10,000 POOL tokens delegated to them can submit a governance proposal. Once submitted governance proposals are voted on for five days. After five days, if the majority of votes are in favor AND at least 100,000 votes have been cast in favor, the proposal will pass. There is a two day ‚Äútimelock‚Äù before the proposal is actually implemented.*\\n\\nYou can check out the post this quote is from, titled *Governance 101*, **[here](https://medium.com/pooltogether/governance-101-fca9ab8b8ba2)**.\\n\\n**So that‚Äôs the governance, but what about the voting?**\\n\\nWell as you can imagine, POOL holders are the ones who vote on proposals. Only unlike the proposal creation, there is no minimum required to vote beyond that you must hold more than zero.\\n\\nToken holders have a couple of ways to vote. They can vote on-chain via Sybil provided that they hold POOL tokens in an Ethereum wallet. The downside of this is that it will cost a small transaction fee to sign each vote ‚õΩÔ∏è Alternatively, they can vote gas free, using SnapShot, but in order to do so, they need to hold PPOOL tokens.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*FBGD9R6ke4KkfZZ3.png)\\n\\n## POOL, PPOOL, POOL Pool üé∂\\n\\nPPOOL tokens are acquired by depositing into the POOL Pool. Like the other prize-linked savings pools, this comes with the chance to win a weekly prize ‚Äî actually one of five prizes often valued in the hundreds of dollars.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*SOAySBxVRf_EJYmW.png)\\n\\nIt also comes with the bonus of receiving weekly rewards paid in POOL tokens. So participating in this one pool gives you three bonuses. To recap those are:\\n\\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Chance to win weekly prizes2Ô∏è‚É£ Rewards paid in POOL (currently around 7.35%)3Ô∏è‚É£ Ability to vote gas-free on governance proposals.\\n\\n## How to Join the Fun\\n\\nIf you think you might be interested in participating more directly in PoolTogether, the best place to get started is on either the Reddit (**[r/PoolTogether](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoolTogether/)**) or on the Discord. I‚Äôm a big fan of the Discord especially. The community around PoolTogether is great and on discord, they offer help, discuss governance proposals, chat about what‚Äôs going on in the world of crypto, and more ü§ì\\n\\nIn fact, by joining the discord, you may find yourself with an opportunity to earn some POOL tokens. That‚Äôs because the community uses a popular Discord bot called Collabland to tip members who contribute. You might create a funny meme, translate an article, or create a youtube video. You might offer some help or share some really relevant news. It‚Äôs up to the users who they want to tip and when, and it‚Äôs not uncommon to see generosity aimed at bringing more people into the community üíñ\\n\\nAnother cool feature of this tipping bot is that you can unlock a gated area of the discord. Simply by proving that you hold POOL, PPOOL, mPOOL (Pool on Polygon), or the POOL-ETH LP tokens (for providing liquidity on UniSwap), you get access to the HODLers Hangout. This is a general chat area when users talk about whatever, but also sometimes host games like trivia or little contests where users can earn more POOL üéâ\\n\\nThe Discord is also where the weekly Community Calls take place. Every Friday, anyone with a discord account can listen in, and even contribute to the dialogue. During the calls there‚Äôs both a live chat thread and a period of the call called Swim Meet where people can ask questions üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\\n\\n## Proof of Attendance\\n\\nSpeaking of community calls; those who tune in to these weekly events gain access to another unique form of reward, a Proof of Attendance Protocol or POAP üéñ POAPs are NFT badges that show that you participated in an event. They can be seen as collectibles or even as a sort of blockchain CV. However you view them, collecting them can become a bit of an addiction.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*6Bu5VucibuUyDfFm.png)\\n\\n**How does it work?**\\n\\nEach week during the call ‚Äî usually near the end ‚Äî a POAP code is issued that anyone who was present can enter to receive their POAP. Since these NFTs are issued on the xDAI sidechain there is no fee for minting üÜì\\n\\nPOAPs can be used in really interesting ways, like to unlock special content or rewards like raffles or airdrops. For more on the value proposition of POAPs, **[read this](https://medium.com/@poap/the-core-value-proposition-of-poap-explained-dc379aca332d)**.\\n\\nFor the moment, in the context of PoolTogether, POAPs are like concert ticket stubs. You only get one shot ever to collect a particular one (even those who diligently listen to **[the recordings](https://anchor.fm/oops-irrelephant/)** of the community calls won‚Äôt be able to retroactively claim them). So if you wanna be one of the cool kids, you‚Äôll need to participate.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1216/0\\\\*bhrmBwEuqXUWGSG2.png)\\n\\nI have a few so far\\n\\n## Coordination Station\\n\\nI can‚Äôt speak for all protocols or DAOs, but one thing I‚Äôve noticed with PoolTogether since the early days is just how motivated everyone is to building a great community. In my newsletter, I once wrote about an incident that took place that I found very heartening.\\n\\n**Here is that excerpt in its entirety for those who missed it:**\\n\\nThe internet can be so tribal and aggressive at times, and I like to see examples of positivity üíñ And by the way, that doesn‚Äôt mean everyone agrees all the time. Just that they‚Äôre respectful and try to find solutions to the underlying problems being addressed. Everyone coming together to make something that is greater than the sum of its parts is one of the strengths of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) üôå\\n\\nAnd that‚Äôs exactly what I saw recently, when I logged in and witnessed a conversation happening live. A very active member of the community who goes by the screen name Oops was talking about how his laptop had died, and so he wasn‚Äôt able to upload the recordings he‚Äôd done of the community calls üòì\\n\\nOops is an integral member of PoolTogether community ‚Äî even though he doesn‚Äôt yet have a formal title or compensation ‚Äî and everyone in the Discord knows it. Even the people at Fortune Magazine know it, given that they featured Oops prominently in a recent article üî•\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/Irrelephantoops/status/1421476192461393923?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1421476192461393923%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=](https://twitter.com/Irrelephantoops/status/1421476192461393923?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1421476192461393923%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=)\\n\\nSo when the subject of the broken laptop came up, one of the community‚Äôs other most prominent members, rliriano didn‚Äôt hesitate, offering almost instantly to help fund a new Macbook Pro for Oops.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*6uW0Ol4nskm27nyY.png)\\n\\nA few other members also stepped up, including CEO Leighton Cusack, and within a few hours, the laptop was ordered\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*P7ozK8P0DR9xgBOo.png)\\n\\nSo often, when we see others struggling, we shrug it off as their own responsibility. But when we look at how hard people work and how much they contribute to our communities, sometimes it‚Äôs obvious that they deserve our support ü§ù\\n\\nI think everyone in that Discord knew that losing Oops would mean losing a part of what makes PoolTogether so great. They value the work that Oops does üíñ And not only did they manage to get the laptop ordered, within a few hours, they had sort everything our amongst themselves to settle up with each other. Talk about efficient! üëè\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*xz8mGTDFHq0ERGJt.png)\\n\\nYou hear me talk a lot about value if you follow my blog and twitter. I‚Äôm very fond of how the creator economy, for example, looks past traditional views of who is/what is valuable, and where/how we should support creators. There is a new approach being birthed as we speak that bridges the ideas of meritocracy and the value we place on contributions to culture and community üëè\\n\\nI‚Äôve written already about **patronage**, and I‚Äôm working on content around NFTs, and even quadratic funding, but this was none of those things. This was grassroots, love thy neighbour type support. A rising tide only lifts all boats as long as you bail out the ones who are sinking first. After all, *this* is what community looks like üíñ\\n\\nYou can read that newsletter in its entirety **[here](https://twitter.com/Irrelephantoops/status/1421476192461393923?s=20)**. Don‚Äôt forget to subscribe!\\n\\nSince that event, the community has been trying out a new system for rewarding members called **[Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/)**. This is a really great tool where regular contributors are given an allocation of a faux-currency called GIVE which they can tip to anyone who participates in a given epoch. At the end of that epoch the GIVE received is converted to POOL at a predefined ratio.\\n\\nAs I wrote in my first ever **Blog Income Update**, the POOL I‚Äôve received through Coordinape is one of my biggest sources of income in recent months. All this for doing work that I had already intended to do.\\n\\nInterestingly, I myself had a moment a little like the *Tale of Oops‚Äô Macbook* recently.\\n\\nAfter releasing my **video about the Celo blockchain** and their campaign with PoolTogether, I got some feedback that the voiceover was a little quiet. I explained that I was still just using my MacBook‚Äôs built in microphone because as I‚Äôve said before I‚Äôm a small fry üçü\\n\\nQuickly the community jumped in with a suggestion\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*5N_R-deQ3tXnG5GI.png)\\n\\nAnd give they did! At the end of the epoch I had received around $230 worth of POOL tokens, which was enough to purchase a nice microphone on Amazon\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1256/0\\\\*AnmpyNEV-nJG494L.png)\\n\\nIn fact, if you watch the video that accompanies this post, you‚Äôll get to hear me use that microphone for the very first time. Here‚Äôs hoping I get the hang of it quickly.\\n\\n## Tutorial Time\\n\\nSpeaking of a video, I wanted to show you all quickly how to participate in governance on PoolTogether. In this video, we‚Äôre going to see how to acquire some POOL, and deposit into the POOL pool, and then I‚Äôll show you how to participate in SnapShot voting üë®‚Äçüè´\\n\\n[https://youtu.be/aBIWbsyBgy4](https://youtu.be/aBIWbsyBgy4)\\n\\nSo that‚Äôs that. In under a year I‚Äôve gone from bearely understanding Bitcoin to a full on crypto convert! üòÇ But it‚Äôs easy to see why. Like the internet, and perhaps even more so, blockchain is being built by a diverse, forward thinking community, and that is reflected throughout the many communities therein üåé\\n\\nAt PoolTogether, I‚Äôve found a tribe. One that cares about creating a new way of saving money that‚Äôs fun, that‚Äôs fair, and that favours the small fish as much as the whales üêü That‚Äôs something I want to be a part of, and thanks to the decentralized governance, and the open community, I can.\\n\\nUntil next time üëã\\n\\nThumbs Up\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nDid you enjoy this content?
