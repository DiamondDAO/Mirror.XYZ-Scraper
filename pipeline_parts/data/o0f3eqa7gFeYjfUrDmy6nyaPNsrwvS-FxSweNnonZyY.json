"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"LADY CAROLINE.  Jane, have you seen John anywhere?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You needn't be anxious about him, dear.  He is with Lady Stutfield; I saw them some time ago, in the Yellow Drawing-room.  They seem quite happy together.  You are not going, Caroline?  Pray sit down.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think I had better look after John.\\n\\n\\\\[Exit LADY CAROLINE.\\\\]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  It doesn't do to pay men so much attention.  And Caroline has really nothing to be anxious about.  Lady Stutfield is very sympathetic.  She is just as sympathetic about one thing as she is about another.  A beautiful nature.\\n\\n\\\\[Enter SIR JOHN and MRS. ALLONBY.\\\\]\\n\\nAh! here is Sir John!  And with Mrs. Allonby too!  I suppose it was Mrs. Allonby I saw him with.  Sir John, Caroline has been looking everywhere for you.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  We have been waiting for her in the Music-room, dear Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! the Music-room, of course.  I thought it was the Yellow Drawing-room, my memory is getting so defective.  \\\\[To the ARCHDEACON.\\\\]  Mrs. Daubeny has a wonderful memory, hasn't she?\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  She used to be quite remarkable for her memory, but since her last attack she recalls chiefly the events of her early childhood.  But she finds great pleasure in such retrospections, great pleasure.\\n\\n\\\\[Enter LADY STUTFIELD and MR. KELVIL.\\\\]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! dear Lady Stutfield! and what has Mr. Kelvil been talking to you about?\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  About Bimetallism, as well as I remember.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Bimetallism!  Is that quite a nice subject? However, I know people discuss everything very freely nowadays. What did Sir John talk to you about, dear Mrs. Allonby?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  About Patagonia.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Really?  What a remote topic!  But very improving, I have no doubt.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He has been most interesting on the subject of Patagonia.  Savages seem to have quite the same views as cultured people on almost all subjects.  They are excessively advanced.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What do they do?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Apparently everything.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, it is very gratifying, dear Archdeacon, is it not, to find that Human Nature is permanently one. - On the whole, the world is the same world, is it not?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The world is simply divided into two classes - those who believe the incredible, like the public - and those who do the improbable -\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Like yourself?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Yes; I am always astonishing myself.  It is the only thing that makes life worth living.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  And what have you been doing lately that astonishes you?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have been discovering all kinds of beautiful qualities in my own nature.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah! don't become quite perfect all at once.  Do it gradually!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don't intend to grow perfect at all.  At least, I hope I shan't.  It would be most inconvenient.  Women love us for our defects.  If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything, even our gigantic intellects.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It is premature to ask us to forgive analysis.  We forgive adoration; that is quite as much as should be expected from us.\\n\\n\\\\[Enter LORD ALFRED.  He joins LADY STUTFIELD.\\\\]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! we women should forgive everything, shouldn't we, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot?  I am sure you agree with me in that.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not, Lady Hunstanton.  I think there are many things women should never forgive.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What sort of things?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  The ruin of another woman's life.\\n\\n\\\\[Moves slowly away to back of stage.\\\\]\\n\\nLADY  HUNSTANTON.  Ah! those things are very sad, no doubt, but I believe there are admirable homes where people of that kind are looked after and reformed, and I think on the whole that the secret of life is to take things very, very easily.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The secret of life is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  The secret of life is to appreciate the pleasure of being terribly, terribly deceived.\\n\\nKELVIL.  The secret of life is to resist temptation, Lady Stutfield.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  There is no secret of life.  Life's aim, if it has one, is simply to be always looking for temptations.  There are not nearly enough.  I sometimes pass a whole day without coming across a single one.  It is quite dreadful.  It makes one so nervous about the future.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  \\\\[Shakes her fan at him.\\\\]  I don't know how it is, dear Lord Illingworth, but everything you have said to-day seems to me excessively immoral.  It has been most interesting, listening to you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  All thought is immoral.  Its very essence is destruction.  If you think of anything, you kill it.  Nothing survives being thought of.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I don't understand a word, Lord Illingworth.  But I have no doubt it is all quite true.  Personally, I have very little to reproach myself with, on the score of thinking.  I don't believe in women thinking too much.  Women should think in moderation, as they should do all things in moderation.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Moderation is a fatal thing, Lady Hunstanton. Nothing succeeds like excess.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I hope I shall remember that.  It sounds an admirable maxim.  But I'm beginning to forget everything.  It's a great misfortune.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is one of your most fascinating qualities, Lady Hunstanton.  No woman should have a memory.  Memory in a woman is the beginning of dowdiness.  One can always tell from a woman's bonnet whether she has got a memory or not.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  How charming you are, dear Lord Illingworth.  You always find out that one's most glaring fault is one's most important virtue.  You have the most comforting views of life.\\n\\n\\\\[Enter FARQUHAR.\\\\]\\n\\nFARQUHAR.  Doctor Daubeny's carriage!\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Archdeacon!  It is only half-past ten.\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  \\\\[Rising.\\\\]  I am afraid I must go, Lady Hunstanton. Tuesday is always one of Mrs. Daubeny's bad nights.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  \\\\[Rising.\\\\]  Well, I won't keep you from her. \\\\[Goes with him towards door.\\\\]  I have told Farquhar to put a brace of partridge into the carriage.  Mrs. Daubeny may fancy them.\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  It is very kind of you, but Mrs. Daubeny never touches solids now.  Lives entirely on jellies.  But she is wonderfully cheerful, wonderfully cheerful.  She has nothing to complain of.\\n\\n\\\\[Exit with LADY HUNSTANTON.\\\\]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  \\\\[Goes over to LORD ILLINGWORTH.\\\\]  There is a beautiful moon to-night.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Let us go and look at it.  To look at anything that is inconstant is charming nowadays.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You have your looking-glass.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is unkind.  It merely shows me my wrinkles.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Mine is better behaved.  It never tells me the truth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then it is in love with you.\\n\\n\\\\[Exeunt SIR JOHN, LADY STUTFIELD, MR. KELVIL and LORD ALFRED.\\\\]\\n\\nGERALD.  \\\\[To LORD ILLINGWORTH\\\\]  May I come too?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do, my dear boy.  \\\\[Moves towards with MRS. ALLONBY and GERALD.\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[LADY CAROLINE enters, looks rapidly round and goes off in opposite direction to that taken by SIR JOHN and LADY STUTFIELD.\\\\]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald!\\n\\nGERALD.  What, mother!\\n\\n\\\\[Exit LORD ILLINGWORTH with MRS. ALLONBY.\\\\]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is getting late.  Let us go home.\\n\\nGERALD.  My dear mother.  Do let us wait a little longer.  Lord Illingworth is so delightful, and, by the way, mother, I have a great surprise for you.  We are starting for India at the end of this month.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let us go home.\\n\\nGERALD.  If you really want to, of course, mother, but I must bid good-bye to Lord Illingworth first.  I'll be back in five minutes. \\\\[Exit.\\\\]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let him leave me if he chooses, but not with him - not with him!  I couldn't bear it.  \\\\[Walks up and down.\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[Enter HESTER.\\\\]\\n\\nHESTER.  What a lovely night it is, Mrs. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Is it?\\n\\nHESTER.  Mrs. Arbuthnot, I wish you would let us be friends.  You are so different from the other women here.  When you came into the Drawing-room this evening, somehow you brought with you a sense of what is good and pure in life.  I had been foolish.  There are things that are right to say, but that may be said at the wrong time and to the wrong people.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I heard what you said.  I agree with it, Miss Worsley.\\n\\nHESTER.  I didn't know you had heard it.  But I knew you would agree with me.  A woman who has sinned should be punished, shouldn't she?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nHESTER.  She shouldn't be allowed to come into the society of good men and women?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  She should not.\\n\\nHESTER.  And the man should be punished in the same way?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  In the same way.  And the children, if there are children, in the same way also?\\n\\nHESTER.  Yes, it is right that the sins of the parents should be visited on the children.  It is a just law.  It is God's law.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is one of God's terrible laws.\\n\\n\\\\[Moves away to fireplace.\\\\]\\n\\nHESTER.  You are distressed about your son leaving you, Mrs. Arbuthnot?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nHESTER.  Do you like him going away with Lord Illingworth?  Of course there is position, no doubt, and money, but position and money are not everything, are they?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  They are nothing; they bring misery.\\n\\nHESTER.  Then why do you let your son go with him?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He wishes it himself.\\n\\nHESTER.  But if you asked him he would stay, would he not?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He has set his heart on going.\\n\\nHESTER.  He couldn't refuse you anything.  He loves you too much. Ask him to stay.  Let me send him in to you.  He is on the terrace at this moment with Lord Illingworth.  I heard them laughing together as I passed through the Music-room.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don't trouble, Miss Worsley, I can wait.  It is of no consequence.\\n\\nHESTER.  No, I'll tell him you want him.  Do - do ask him to stay. \\\\[Exit HESTER.\\\\]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He won't come - I know he won't come.\\n\\n\\\\[Enter LADY CAROLINE.  She looks round anxiously.  Enter GERALD.\\\\]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Mr. Arbuthnot, may I ask you is Sir John anywhere on the terrace?\\n\\nGERALD.  No, Lady Caroline, he is not on the terrace.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  It is very curious.  It is time for him to retire.\\n\\n\\\\[Exit LADY CAROLINE.\\\\]\\n\\nGERALD.  Dear mother, I am afraid I kept you waiting.  I forgot all about it.  I am so happy to-night, mother; I have never been so happy.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  At the prospect of going away?\\n\\nGERALD.  Don't put it like that, mother.  Of course I am sorry to leave you.  Why, you are the best mother in the whole world.  But after all, as Lord Illingworth says, it is impossible to live in such a place as Wrockley.  You don't mind it.  But I'm ambitions; I want something more than that.  I want to have a career.  I want to do something that will make you proud of me, and Lord Illingworth is going to help me.  He is going to do everything for me.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, don't go away with Lord Illingworth.  I implore you not to.  Gerald, I beg you!\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, how changeable you are!  You don't seem to know your own mind for a single moment.  An hour and a half ago in the Drawing-room you agreed to the whole thing; now you turn round and make objections, and try to force me to give up my one chance in life.  Yes, my one chance.  You don't suppose that men like Lord Illingworth are to be found every day, do you, mother?  It is very strange that when I have had such a wonderful piece of good luck, the one person to put difficulties in my way should be my own mother.  Besides, you know, mother, I love Hester Worsley.  Who could help loving her?  I love her more than I have ever told you, far more.  And if I had a position, if I had prospects, I could - I could ask her to - Don't you understand now, mother, what it means to me to be Lord Illingworth's secretary?  To start like that is to find a career ready for one - before one - waiting for one.  If I were Lord Illingworth's secretary I could ask Hester to be my wife. As a wretched bank clerk with a hundred a year it would be an impertinence.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I fear you need have no hopes of Miss Worsley.  I know her views on life.  She has just told them to me.  \\\\[A pause.\\\\]\\n\\nGERALD.  Then I have my ambition left, at any rate.  That is something - I am glad I have that!  You have always tried to crush my ambition, mother - haven't you?  You have told me that the world is a wicked place, that success is not worth having, that society is shallow, and all that sort of thing - well, I don't believe it, mother.  I think the world must be delightful.  I think society must be exquisite.  I think success is a thing worth having.  You have been wrong in all that you taught me, mother, quite wrong. Lord Illingworth is a successful man.  He is a fashionable man.  He is a man who lives in the world and for it.  Well, I would give anything to be just like Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I would sooner see you dead.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, what is your objection to Lord Illingworth?  Tell me - tell me right out.  What is it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He is a bad man.\\n\\nGERALD.  In what way bad?  I don't understand what you mean.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will tell you.\\n\\nGERALD.  I suppose you think him bad, because he doesn't believe the same things as you do.  Well, men are different from women, mother.  It is natural that they should have different views.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is not what Lord Illingworth believes, or what he does not believe, that makes him bad.  It is what he is.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, is it something you know of him?  Something you actually know?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is something I know.\\n\\nGERALD.  Something you are quite sure of?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Quite sure of.\\n\\nGERALD.  How long have you known it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For twenty years.\\n\\nGERALD.  Is it fair to go back twenty years in any man's career? And what have you or I to do with Lord Illingworth's early life? What business is it of ours?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What this man has been, he is now, and will be always.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, tell me what Lord Illingworth did?  If he did anything shameful, I will not go away with him.  Surely you know me well enough for that?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, come near to me.  Quite close to me, as you used to do when you were a little boy, when you were mother's own boy.  \\\\[GERALD sits down betide his mother.  She runs her fingers through his hair, and strokes his hands.\\\\]  Gerald, there was a girl once, she was very young, she was little over eighteen at the time.  George Harford - that was Lord Illingworth's name then - George Harford met her.  She knew nothing about life.  He - knew everything.  He made this girl love him.  He made her love him so much that she left her father's house with him one morning.  She loved him so much, and he had promised to marry her!  He had solemnly promised to marry her, and she had believed him.  She was very young, and - and ignorant of what life really is.  But he put the marriage off from week to week, and month to month. - She trusted in him all the while.  She loved him. - Before her child was born - for she had a child - she implored him for the child's sake to marry her, that the child might have a name, that her sin might not be visited on the child, who was innocent.  He refused. After the child was born she left him, taking the child away, and her life was ruined, and her soul ruined, and all that was sweet, and good, and pure in her ruined also.  She suffered terribly - she suffers now.  She will always suffer.  For her there is no joy, no peace, no atonement.  She is a woman who drags a chain like a guilty thing.  She is a woman who wears a mask, like a thing that is a leper.  The fire cannot purify her.  The waters cannot quench her anguish.  Nothing can heal her! no anodyne can give her sleep! no poppies forgetfulness!  She is lost!  She is a lost soul! - That is why I call Lord Illingworth a bad man.  That is why I don't want my boy to be with him.\\n\\nGERALD.  My dear mother, it all sounds very tragic, of course.  But I dare say the girl was just as much to blame as Lord Illingworth was. - After all, would a really nice girl, a girl with any nice feelings at all, go away from her home with a man to whom she was not married, and live with him as his wife?  No nice girl would.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  \\\\[After a pause.\\\\]  Gerald, I withdraw all my objections.  You are at liberty to go away with Lord Illingworth, when and where you choose.\\n\\nGERALD.  Dear mother, I knew you wouldn't stand in my way.  You are the best woman God ever made.  And, as for Lord Illingworth, I don't believe he is capable of anything infamous or base.  I can't believe it of him - I can't.\\n\\nHESTER.  \\\\[Outside.\\\\]  Let me go!  Let me go!  \\\\[Enter HESTER in terror, and rushes over to GERALD and flings herself in his arms.\\\\]\\n\\nHESTER.  Oh! save me - save me from him!\\n\\nGERALD.  From whom?\\n\\nHESTER.  He has insulted me!  Horribly insulted me!  Save me!\\n\\nGERALD.  Who?  Who has dared - ?\\n\\n\\\\[LORD ILLINGWORTH enters at back of stage.  HESTER breaks from GERALD'S arms and points to him.\\\\]\\n\\nGERALD  \\\\[He is quite beside himself with rage and indignation.\\\\] Lord Illingworth, you have insulted the purest thing on God's earth, a thing as pure as my own mother.  You have insulted the woman I love most in the world with my own mother.  As there is a God in Heaven, I will kill you!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  \\\\[Rushing across and catching hold of him\\\\]  No! no!\\n\\nGERALD.  \\\\[Thrusting her back.\\\\]  Don't hold me, mother.  Don't hold me - I'll kill him!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald!\\n\\nGERALD.  Let me go, I say!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Stop, Gerald, stop!  He is your own father!\\n\\n\\\\[GERALD clutches his mother's hands and looks into her face.  She sinks slowly on the ground in shame.  HESTER steals towards the door.  LORD ILLINGWORTH frowns and bites his lip.  After a time GERALD raises his mother up, puts his am round her, and leads her from the room.\\\\]\\n\\nACT DROP\\n\\nFOURTH ACT\\n\\nSCENE\\n\\nSitting-room at Mrs. Arbuthnot's.  Large open French window at back, looking on to garden.  Doors R.C. and L.C.\\n\\n\\\\[GERALD ARBUTHNOT writing at table.\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[Enter ALICE R.C. followed by LADY HUNSTANTON and MRS. ALLONBY.\\\\]\\n\\nALICE.  Lady Hunstanton and Mrs. Allonby.\\n\\n\\\\[Exit L.C.\\\\]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Good morning, Gerald.\\n\\nGERALD.  \\\\[Rising.\\\\]  Good morning, Lady Hunstanton.  Good morning, Mrs. Allonby.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  \\\\[Sitting down.\\\\]  We came to inquire for your dear mother, Gerald.  I hope she is better?\\n\\nGERALD.  My mother has not come down yet, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY  HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for her last night.  I think there must have been thunder in the air.  Or perhaps it was the music.  Music makes one feel so romantic - at least it always gets on one's nerves.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It's the same thing, nowadays.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I am so glad I don't know what you mean, dear.  I am afraid you mean something wrong.  Ah, I see you're examining Mrs. Arbuthnot's pretty room.  Isn't it nice and old-fashioned?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  \\\\[Surveying the room through her lorgnette.\\\\]  It looks quite the happy English home.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  That's just the word, dear; that just describes it.  One feels your mother's good influence in everything she has about her, Gerald.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad, but that a good influence is the worst in the world.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  When Lord Illingworth knows Mrs. Arbuthnot better he will change his mind.  I must certainly bring him here.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I should like to see Lord Illingworth in a happy English home.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  It would do him a great deal of good, dear.  Most women in London, nowadays, seem to furnish their rooms with nothing but orchids, foreigners, and French novels.  But here we have the room of a sweet saint.  Fresh natural flowers, books that don't shock one, pictures that one can look at without blushing.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  But I like blushing.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, there IS a good deal to be said for blushing, if one can do it at the proper moment.  Poor dear Hunstanton used to tell me I didn't blush nearly often enough.  But then he was so very particular.  He wouldn't let me know any of his men friends, except those who were over seventy, like poor Lord Ashton: who afterwards, by the way, was brought into the Divorce Court.  A most unfortunate case.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I delight in men over seventy.  They always offer one the devotion of a lifetime.  I think seventy an ideal age for a man.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  She is quite incorrigible, Gerald, isn't she? By-the-by, Gerald, I hope your dear mother will come and see me more often now.  You and Lord Illingworth start almost immediately, don't you?\\n\\nGERALD.  I have given up my intention of being Lord Illingworth's secretary.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Surely not, Gerald!  It would be most unwise of you.  What reason can you have?\\n\\nGERALD.  I don't think I should be suitable for the post.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I wish Lord Illingworth would ask me to be his secretary.  But he says I am not serious enough.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, you really mustn't talk like that in this house.  Mrs. Arbuthnot doesn't know anything about the wicked society in which we all live.  She won't go into it.  She is far too good.  I consider it was a great honour her coming to me last night.  It gave quite an atmosphere of respectability to the party.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, that must have been what you thought was thunder in the air.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, how can you say that?  There is no resemblance between the two things at all.  But really, Gerald, what do you mean by not being suitable?\\n\\nGERALD.  Lord Illingworth's views of life and mine are too different.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But, my dear Gerald, at your age you shouldn't have any views of life.  They are quite out of place.  You must be guided by others in this matter.  Lord Illingworth has made you the most flattering offer, and travelling with him you would see the world - as much of it, at least, as one should look at - under the\\n\\nbest auspices possible, and stay with all the right people, which is so important at this solemn moment in your career.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don't want to see the world: I've seen enough of it.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I hope you don't think you have exhausted life, Mr. Arbuthnot.  When a man says that, one knows that life has exhausted him.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don't wish to leave my mother.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Now, Gerald, that is pure laziness on your part. Not leave your mother!  If I were your mother I would insist on your going.\\n\\n\\\\[Enter ALICE L.C.\\\\]\\n\\nALICE.  Mrs. Arbuthnot's compliments, my lady, but she has a bad headache, and cannot see any one this morning.  \\\\[Exit R.C.\\\\]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  \\\\[Rising.\\\\]  A bad headache!  I am so sorry! Perhaps you'll bring her up to Hunstanton this afternoon, if she is better, Gerald.\\n\\nGERALD.  I am afraid not this afternoon, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, to-morrow, then.  Ah, if you had a father, Gerald, he wouldn't let you waste your life here.  He would send you off with Lord Illingworth at once.  But mothers are so weak. They give up to their sons in everything.  We are all heart, all heart.  Come, dear, I must call at the rectory and inquire for Mrs. Daubeny, who, I am afraid, is far from well.  It is wonderful how the Archdeacon bears up, quite wonderful.  He is the most sympathetic of husbands.  Quite a model.  Good-bye, Gerald, give my fondest love to your mother.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Good-bye, Mr. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nGERALD.  Good-bye.\\n\\n\\\\[Exit LADY HUNSTANTON and MRS. ALLONBY.  GERALD sits down and reads over his letter.\\\\]\\n\\nGERALD.  What name can I sign?  I, who have no right to any name. \\\\[Signs name, puts letter into envelope, addresses it, and is about to seal it, when door L.C. opens and MRS. ARBUTHNOT enters.  GERALD lays down sealing-wax.  Mother and son look at each other.\\\\]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  \\\\[Through French window at the back.\\\\]  Good-bye again, Gerald.  We are taking the short cut across your pretty garden.  Now, remember my advice to you - start at once with Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  AU REVOIR, Mr. Arbuthnot.  Mind you bring me back something nice from your travels - not an Indian shawl - on no account an Indian shawl.\\n\\n\\\\[Exeunt.\\\\]\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I have just written to him.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  To whom?\\n\\nGERALD.  To my father.  I have written to tell him to come here at four o'clock this afternoon.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He shall not come here.  He shall not cross the threshold of my house.\\n\\nGERALD.  He must come.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, if you are going away with Lord Illingworth, go at once.  Go before it kills me: but don't ask me to meet him.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you don't understand.  Nothing in the world would induce me to go away with Lord Illingworth, or to leave you. Surely you know me well enough for that.  No: I have written to him to say -\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What can you have to say to him?\\n\\nGERALD.  Can't you guess, mother, what I have written in this letter?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, surely you can.  Think, think what must be done, now, at once, within the next few days.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There is nothing to be done.\\n\\nGERALD.  I have written to Lord Illingworth to tell him that he must marry you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Marry me?\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I will force him to do it.  The wrong that has been done you must be repaired.  Atonement must be made.  Justice may be slow, mother, but it comes in the end.  In a few days you shall be Lord Illingworth's lawful wife.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But, Gerald -\\n\\nGERALD.  I will insist upon his doing it.  I will make him do it: he will not dare to refuse.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But, Gerald, it is I who refuse.  I will not marry Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nGERALD.  Not marry him?  Mother!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not marry him.\\n\\nGERALD.  But you don't understand: it is for your sake I am talking, not for mine.  This marriage, this necessary marriage, this marriage which for obvious reasons must inevitably take place, will not help me, will not give me a name that will be really, rightly mine to bear.  But surely it will be something for you, that you, my mother, should, however late, become the wife of the man who is my father.  Will not that be something?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not marry him.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you must.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not.  You talk of atonement for a wrong done.  What atonement can be made to me?  There is no atonement possible.  I am disgraced: he is not.  That is all.  It is the usual history of a man and a woman as it usually happens, as it always happens.  And the ending is the ordinary ending.  The woman suffers.  The man goes free.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don't know if that is the ordinary ending, mother: I hope it is not.  But your life, at any rate, shall not end like that.  The man shall make whatever reparation is possible.  It is not enough.  It does not wipe out the past, I know that.  But at least it makes the future better, better for you, mother.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I refuse to marry Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nGERALD.  If he came to you himself and asked you to be his wife you would give him a different answer.  Remember, he is my father.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  If he came himself, which he will not do, my answer would be the same.  Remember I am your mother.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you make it terribly difficult for me by talking like that; and I can't understand why you won't look at this matter from the right, from the only proper standpoint.  It is to take away the bitterness out of your life, to take away the shadow that lies on your name, that this marriage must take place.  There is no alternative: and after the marriage you and I can go away together. But the marriage must take place first.  It is a duty that you owe, not merely to yourself, but to all other women - yes: to all the other women in the world, lest he betray more.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I owe nothing to other women.  There is not one of them to help me.  There is not one woman in the world to whom I could go for pity, if I would take it, or for sympathy, if I could win it.  Women are hard on each other.  That girl, last night, good though she is, fled from the room as though I were a tainted thing. She was right.  I am a tainted thing.  But my wrongs are my own, and I will bear them alone.  I must bear them alone.  What have women who have not sinned to do with me, or I with them?  We do not understand each other.\\n\\n\\\\[Enter HESTER behind.\\\\]\\n\\nGERALD.  I implore you to do what I ask you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What son has ever asked of his mother to make so hideous a sacrifice?  None.\\n\\nGERALD.  What mother has ever refused to marry the father of her own child?  None.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let me be the first, then.  I will not do it.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you believe in religion, and you brought me up to believe in it also.  Well, surely your religion, the religion that you taught me when I was a boy, mother, must tell you that I am right.  You know it, you feel it.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not know it.  I do not feel it, nor will I ever stand before God's altar and ask God's blessing on so hideous a mockery as a marriage between me and George Harford.  I will not say the words the Church bids us to say.  I will not say them.  I dare not.  How could I swear to love the man I loathe, to honour him who wrought you dishonour, to obey him who, in his mastery, made me to sin?  No: marriage is a sacrament for those who love each other.  It is not for such as him, or such as me.  Gerald, to save you from the world's sneers and taunts I have lied to the world.  For twenty years I have lied to the world.  I could not tell the world the truth.  Who can, ever?  But not for my own sake will I lie to God, and in God's presence.  No, Gerald, no ceremony, Church-hallowed or State-made, shall ever bind me to George Harford.  It may be that I am too bound to him already, who, robbing me, yet left me richer, so that in the mire of my life I found the pearl of price, or what I thought would be so.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don't understand you now.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Men don't understand what mothers are.  I am no different from other women except in the wrong done me and the wrong I did, and my very heavy punishments and great disgrace.  And yet, to bear you I had to look on death.  To nurture you I had to wrestle with it.  Death fought with me for you.  All women have to fight with death to keep their children.  Death, being childless, wants our children from us.  Gerald, when you were naked I clothed you, when you were hungry I gave you food.  Night and day all that long winter I tended you.  No office is too mean, no care too lowly for the thing we women love - and oh! how I loved YOU.  Not Hannah, Samuel more.  And you needed love, for you were weakly, and only love could have kept you alive.  Only love can keep any one alive. And boys are careless often and without thinking give pain, and we always fancy that when they come to man's estate and know us better they will repay us.  But it is not so.  The world draws them from our side, and they make friends with whom they are happier than they are with us, and have amusements from which we are barred, and interests that are not ours: and they are unjust to us often, for when they find life bitter they blame us for it, and when they find it sweet we do not taste its sweetness with them . . . You made many friends and went into their houses and were glad with them, and I, knowing my secret, did not dare to follow, but stayed at home and closed the door, shut out the sun and sat in darkness. What should I have done in honest households?  My past was ever with me. . . . And you thought I didn't care for the pleasant things of life.  I tell you I longed for them, but did not dare to touch them, feeling I had no right.  You thought I was happier working amongst the poor.  That was my mission, you imagined.  It was not, but where else was I to go?  The sick do not ask if the hand that smooths their pillow is pure, nor the dying care if the lips that touch their brow have known the kiss of sin.  It was you I thought of all the time; I gave to them the love you did not need: lavished on them a love that was not theirs . . . And you thought I spent too much of my time in going to Church, and in Church duties.  But where else could I turn?  God's house is the only house where sinners are made welcome, and you were always in my heart, Gerald, too much in my heart.  For, though day after day, at morn or evensong, I have knelt in God's house, I have never repented of my sin.  How could I repent of my sin when you, my love, were its fruit!  Even now that you are bitter to me I cannot repent.  I do not.  You are more to me than innocence.  I would rather be your mother - oh! much rather! - than have been always pure . . . Oh, don't you see? don't you understand?  It is my dishonour that has made you so dear to me.  It is my disgrace that has bound you so closely to me.  It is the price I paid for you - the price of soul and body - that makes me love you as I do.  Oh, don't ask me to do this horrible thing.  Child of my shame, be still the child of my shame!\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I didn't know you loved me so much as that.  And I will be a better son to you than I have been.  And you and I must never leave each other . . . but, mother . . . I can't help it . . . you must become my father's wife.  You must marry him.  It is your duty.\\n\\nHESTER.  \\\\[Running forwards and embracing MRS. ARBUTHNOT.\\\\]  No, no; you shall not.  That would be real dishonour, the first you have ever known.  That would be real disgrace: the first to touch you. Leave him and come with me.  There are other countries than England . . . Oh! other countries over sea, better, wiser, and less unjust lands.  The world is very wide and very big.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No, not for me.  For me the world is shrivelled to a palm's breadth, and where I walk there are thorns.\\n\\nHESTER.  It shall not be so.  We shall somewhere find green valleys and fresh waters, and if we weep, well, we shall weep together. Have we not both loved him?\\n\\nGERALD.  Hester!\\n\\nHESTER.  \\\\[Waving him back.\\\\]  Don't, don't!  You cannot love me at all, unless you love her also.  You cannot honour me, unless she's holier to you.  In her all womanhood is martyred.  Not she alone, but all of us are stricken in her house.\\n\\nGERALD.  Hester, Hester, what shall I do?\\n\\n[ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/1](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/1)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637650168,\"title\":\"shrugs his shoulders and looks irritably over at his mother.
