"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I just got back from walking Meli, she is a Korean Village Dog that we rescued from the streets of Korea. Gorgeous pup who has opened up to us over the last year and a half but is still terrified of a lot of things. Fire, smoke, strange noises, strangers, etc. You  wouldn’t think she’s terrified by looking at her instagram my girlfriend curates, but trust me.. she most definitely is.\\n\\n![Meli in Tahoe](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oI7ix-TybLAPUXxx4tBQh.jpg?height=4032&width=3024)\\n\\n[https://www.instagram.com/meli_the_kvd/](https://www.instagram.com/meli_the_kvd/)\\n\\n^The page will be found if you click^\\n\\nBut anyway, when we got back I opened up twitter to see a live chat happening with Coinbase. “Do Process with Jeff Staple” to be exact. Here’s a link below to be even more exact.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1jMJgeDebzwKL](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1jMJgeDebzwKL)\\n\\nBut they talked about fashion in the Metaverse, web 3.0, NFTs, among other things and I loved their energy and passion about the space. As a crypto enthusiast myself, I’m always trying to find ways to engage and participate in the community. When they mentioned this site, Mirror.xyz, I have never heard of it and had to check it out for myself. I love the idea in web 3.0 where content creators are rewarded with their participation and effort they put out there. Which gives creators more incentive to create!\\n\\n![Be creative](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f1PJ1fjpIBniJYMXNiZFE.jpg?height=2724&width=3916)\\n\\nI’ve started multiple blogs in the past but eventually stopped writing.. I enjoy writing from time to time.. you should see my notes app, just random streams of thought vomitted onto a page. I usually write about personal experiences or dive deep into a topic that I find interesting. It helps me get things off my chest because I’m not one who talks about my emotions. It also helps me learn while I do more research into whatever topic I decide to write on.\\n\\nBut who am I anyway? I am a 29 year old male who works as a trader of securities and cryptocurrencies. This is an occupation that not many people understand. A lot of people think it’s gambling, which sometimes it can be, but if you begin to learn the psychology of trading and dive into technical analysis you will begin to see how markets work.\\n\\nI’ve only been doing this for two years. It was challenging for me to find something that I wanted to do with my life. In high school I played golf and wanted to pursue a professional golf career. I went to college at San Diego State University and received a degree in Multimedia with a minor in Marketing. I learned a lot in college but the career path afterwards didn’t pan out. I worked as a photographer for a few years but lost my passion for it when it became a job. I then looked into computer science and found a coding bootcamp through UCSD. That taught me a lot about programming and how computer networks work. I learned HTML and CSS pretty quickly but struggled with concepts in Javascript. So I’m not computer nerd, but I sure would like to be.\\n\\nThe bootcamp indirectly got me interested in cryptocurrencies even more because now I somewhat understood algorithms and basic computer science. Somewhere around there I dove down the rabbit hole of crypto and haven’t looked back since. Here’s a video that I enjoyed if you are new to crypto and want to learn more about it.\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYWc9dFqROI&ab_channel=CoinBureau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYWc9dFqROI&ab_channel=CoinBureau)\\n\\nGuy, is the man behind the coin bureau and he puts out solid videos to help explain different crypto projects and current events that are happening within the space. He is very detailed and easy to listen to so I guess that’s why I found him appealing.\\n\\nAnyway I have to go…  I plan to spend most of my time in life trying to understand markets and cryptocurrencies while spending the rest of my time with my dog and girlfriend (soon to be wife). I’m an open minded person, a life long learner, and all in all hope this blog will teach and inspire whoever decides to read it.  See you around.\\n\\nAh.. And join my discord if you’d like to chat anytime. It’s a very small group now but hey, you gotta start somewhere right?\\n\\n[https://discord.gg/ADpMbDjhtQ](https://discord.gg/ADpMbDjhtQ)\\n\\nMistaManTrev\",\"timestamp\":1641597926,\"title\":\"Welcome to Mirror\"},\"digest\":\"9v3DPgnMOXjONG7JOEaUjIHiACnERchWvVuFYoipiMc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7C4A2B563168B8c20112c710134ea30E380b9Ac4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fX8zyGBstXecN-lrquHiWEL2feQg2GBZiSdyulmRbhQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"CmGrmPMkfPz_vBFipiVLv91DshDbcj1oFw-baLVjCuE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"tJ6Ika6xjb4xvfycK3bMQSIkghJwWzE-pFnEqEquGk_BzAsIeZh86LFvqLE5yfAuvsOZMPpyeWvEh0cuY0GhyQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x7817ecdc454eea2df13fa8487cbcd08669fddb0f904afd0f4ef4c55b9877b9a51524e59baf5cf83d84c5faf0a3f15289dcfd0eaa4246a8ad3670c9c54dab41ec1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fX8zyGBstXecN-lrquHiWEL2feQg2GBZiSdyulmRbhQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"CmGrmPMkfPz_vBFipiVLv91DshDbcj1oFw-baLVjCuE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Mslzetcy219tZZgePS9ZfRKcJRqhgxSeL0RLiROFTWk\"}"
