"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Be a manager in a small company first, and then you will get rich if you quit and get promoted! The point is speed\\n\\nquick.\\n\\nI know a brother who just quit a job as a salesperson in a company. He quit as a sales manager from a low-level salesperson. In this company, he hasn't received a salary from the company for three years since he joined the company. At that time, the boss saw that he had a good performance and wanted to promote him to be a supervisor. However, there was no other subsidies such as management, and the commission did not increase. He still received the commission when he was a salesperson. Later, he said that when training to be a manager, he still needs to be a salesperson. The commission is well-known as the salary of management when he is able to improve.\\n\\nIn the daily morning meeting for the past three years, personnel training, recruitment, sales, after-sales service, front desk answering the phone, he has to do everything in every aspect of the company, because this company is not a very big company, so he has to do some chores.\\n\\nIn the past three years, he has never mentioned anything about a penny to his boss. He runs his own business to support himself.\\n\\nNow he has quit his job and works as a salesman in a group company with an annual turnover of more than 100 million yuan.\\n\\n122 Entrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs\\n\\nAs a sales manager, the commission is higher and the conditions are better. Now he won’t complain, “The boss didn’t pay him, and he had to let the boss pay him for the three years\\n\\nThe cost of helping the company with other tasks.” Instead, thank the boss for the platform he gave him. It was this opportunity that allowed him to learn more useful values.\\n\\nKnowledge of money and experience as a sales manager. Now the boss wants to call him back many times, and he doesn't go back anymore. The relationship with the boss now is a cooperative relationship, which is equal.\\n\\nThe following is my analysis: On the surface, the boss asked you to do the work of the manager and did not give you an extra penny. You\\n\\nSuffering... (The boss intended to take advantage of you and exploit the wealth created by your labor-doing more work but not giving more money, of course it is exploitation, right?)\\n\\nIn fact, the boss inadvertently gave you \\\"manager qualifications.\\\" This qualification is very valuable. Without this qualification, if you go to any other place, you will\\n\\nIt is an employee’s qualification; with this qualification, you can pat your chest wherever you go and introduce yourself generously: I used to be the manager of a certain company. This is true and approved by the boss.\\n\\nYou didn't lie, you told the truth, and you will be a manager in the future! The boss asked you to do the manager’s work and did not give you the manager’s salary, but the boss accidentally gave you\\n\\nThe worth of the manager! The manager’s worth, with this qualification, can get a lifetime manager’s salary, and more\\n\\nThe money is less than what the boss gave you in three years. I don’t know how many times it is. Therefore, I suggest that many people who have just graduated or have not mixed for several years\\n\\nPeople, first go to a small company to get the qualifications of a manager, and then quickly apply for the positions of managers in charge of some medium-sized enterprises. It should be said that within one year, you can complete this transformation and increase your income several times.\",\"timestamp\":1634796376,\"title\":\"Be a manager of a small company first, and then you will become rich if you change jobs and appreciate in value\"},\"digest\":\"oxMJ79fFcbDaPox9msGRTJ0zsHawTnpnGJerewEgtbI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ip6p3RKYhbu42jtdmO4IeTnlZbRoTK9P5HrxmMHTlTXuSt_2EYKq-iUogNINFuDQ54kDG3iUetEfoMmFZgKuuA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"oxMJ79fFcbDaPox9msGRTJ0zsHawTnpnGJerewEgtbI\"}"
