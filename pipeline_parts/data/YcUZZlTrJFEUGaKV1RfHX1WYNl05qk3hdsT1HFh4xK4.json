"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"DEXtools is a price data analytics tool which helps traders to more easily navigate decentralized networks. One of the most important features of [the platform](https://www.dextools.io/) is the ability to keep a record of the live price of tokens. So, let’s jump in and introduce you to the basics of Dextools.\\n\\n## What does the DEXtools platform offer?\\n\\nDEXtools allows traders to have more insight into different tokens. The platform ranks tokens based on different data and allows the community to rank them as well. This can be seen under the “Community Ranking” section of the website. Furthermore, it gives you live prices and shows you detailed tokenomics, such as liquidity and volume.\\n\\nOne of the most advanced tools that DEXtools offers is the transaction section where all transactions, including size, time, address and price of a selected token can be seen. A good trader can use this information to evaluate the timing of his trades.\\n\\n### Accurate pricing\\n\\nThe problem with most websites that keep a list of token prices is that the prices are several minutes behind the live price. DEXtools is almost 100% accurate. So, it’s always best to check the price here first before purchasing a token. As for some tokens the price fluctuates heavily, this feature can save you alot of money and allows you to trade with more confidence.\\n\\n### Trending Tokens\\n\\nIn the middle section of DEXtools you can see coins that are trending. This section is useful if you want to hop on to the next trend or if you just want to see where the money is currently flowing.\\n\\n### Charts and Tokenomics\\n\\nIf you are looking for the charts and tokenomics of a specific token, you may enter in the name of the token or the contract address in the search bar for the DEX you’re using. Make sure you use the correct name and address, as for many coins and tokens there are fake and fraudulent tokens around.\\n\\n## DexTools Features\\n\\nDexTool provides a complete overview of a token’s key analytics to improve your trading strategies, here are the key features: \\n\\n* **Pool Explorer**: Find trending pools easily to find new gems and quickly see the total value in a pair’s pool. Additionally, you can monitor liquidity adds and removes which is a great way to know how bullish/bearish to be on a token. Plus all the important links such as the token’s Etherscan or Uniswap page are in one place. Making it easy for you to verify information. There is also a quick link to see if the pool has locked liquidity via UniCrypt.\\n* **Pair Explorer**: Follow trade history and price action charts in real-time, along with keeping tabs on your favorite tokens. DexTools also generates a score for token pairs which can help investors avoid obvious scams. Standard and Premium members can also set up decentralized limit orders or use algorithmic trading bots. \\n* **Big Swaps**: This tool tracks big swaps, aka whale trades. For example, monitoring big sell swaps can help you time your buys to catch the dips! \\n* **MultiSwap**: No need to have open multiple browsers and tabs, with DexTools you can interact with multiple pairs on one screen.\\n* **Notifications**: Price alerts for your favorite tokens are possible via Desktop, Mail, or Telegram. This is a vital tool to improve your DeFi trading strategies as currently no DEXs support stop-win or stop-loss orders.  \\n* **Tracking**: It’s hard to track your positions across all those Altcoins! Especially if you’re buying tokens to move around farming pools. DexTools makes it easy with an in-built P&L tracker for your positions. Having a trade journal is one of the best ways to document trade decisions, hold yourself accountable, and improve your trading strategy over time.\\n\\n## Final thoughts\\n\\nKnowing how to use DEXtools is important for all traders that use decentralized exchanges.
