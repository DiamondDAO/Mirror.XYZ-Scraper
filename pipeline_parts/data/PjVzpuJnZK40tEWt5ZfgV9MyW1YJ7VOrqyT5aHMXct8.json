"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"and were returning gently on a long, straight road, at some distance we saw a boy trying to leap a pony over a gate; the pony would not take the leap, and the boy cut him with the whip, but he only turned off on one side. He whipped him again, but the pony turned off on the other side. Then the boy got off and gave him a hard thrashing, and knocked him about the head; then he got up again and tried to make him leap the gate, kicking him all the time shamefully, but still the pony refused. When we were nearly at the spot the pony put down his head and threw up his heels, and sent the boy neatly over into a broad quickset hedge, and with the rein dangling from his head he set off home at a full gallop. John laughed out quite loud.  \\\"Served him right,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, oh, oh!\\\" cried the boy as he struggled about among the thorns; \\\"I say, come and help me out.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thank ye,\\\" said John, \\\"I think you are quite in the right place, and maybe a little scratching will teach you not to leap a pony over a gate that is too high for him,\\\" and so with that John rode off.  \\\"It may be,\\\" said he to himself, \\\"that young fellow is a liar as well as a cruel one; we'll just go home by Farmer Bushby's, Beauty, and then if anybody wants to know you and I can tell 'em, ye see.\\\" So we turned off to the right, and soon came up to the stack-yard, and within sight of the house.  The farmer was hurrying out into the road, and his wife was standing at the gate, looking very frightened.\\n\\n\\\"Have you seen my boy?\\\" said Mr. Bushby as we came up; \\\"he went out an hour ago on my black pony, and the creature is just come back without a rider.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should think, sir,\\\" said John, \\\"he had better be without a rider, unless he can be ridden properly.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you mean?\\\" said the farmer.\\n\\n\\\"Well, sir, I saw your son whipping, and kicking, and knocking that good little pony about shamefully because he would not leap a gate that was too high for him.  The pony behaved well, sir, and showed no vice; but at last he just threw up his heels and tipped the young gentleman into the thorn hedge.  He wanted me to help him out, but I hope you will excuse me, sir, I did not feel inclined to do so.  There's no bones broken, sir; he'll only get a few scratches.  I love horses, and it riles me to see them badly used; it is a bad plan to aggravate an animal till he uses his heels; the first time is not always the last.\\\"\\n\\nDuring this time the mother began to cry, \\\"Oh, my poor Bill, I must go and meet him; he must be hurt.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You had better go into the house, wife,\\\" said the farmer; \\\"Bill wants a lesson about this, and I must see that he gets it; this is not the first time, nor the second, that he has ill-used that pony, and I shall stop it.  I am much obliged to you, Manly.  Good-evening.\\\"\\n\\nSo we went on, John chuckling all the way home; then he told James about it, who laughed and said, \\\"Serve him right.  I knew that boy at school; he took great airs on himself because he was a farmer's son; he used to swagger about and bully the little boys.  Of course, we elder ones would not have any of that nonsense, and let him know that in the school and the playground farmers' sons and laborers' sons were all alike.  I well remember one day, just before afternoon school, I found him at the large window catching flies and pulling off their wings. He did not see me and I gave him a box on the ears that laid him sprawling on the floor.  Well, angry as I was, I was almost frightened, he roared and bellowed in such a style.  The boys rushed in from the playground, and the master ran in from the road to see who was being murdered.  Of course I said fair and square at once what I had done, and why; then I showed the master the flies, some crushed and some crawling about helpless, and I showed him the wings on the window sill.  I never saw him so angry before; but as Bill was still howling and whining, like the coward that he was, he did not give him any more punishment of that kind, but set him up on a stool for the rest of the afternoon, and said that he should not go out to play for that week. Then he talked to all the boys very seriously about cruelty, and said how hard-hearted and cowardly it was to hurt the weak and the helpless; but what stuck in my mind was this, he said that cruelty was the devil's own trade-mark, and if we saw any one who took pleasure in cruelty we might know who he belonged to, for the devil was a murderer from the beginning, and a tormentor to the end.  On the other hand, where we saw people who loved their neighbors, and were kind to man and beast, we might know that was God's mark.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your master never taught you a truer thing,\\\" said John; \\\"there is no religion without love, and people may talk as much as they like about their religion, but if it does not teach them to be good and kind to man and beast it is all a sham -- all a sham, James, and it won't stand when things come to be turned inside out.\\\"\\n\\n14      James Howard\\n\\nEarly one morning in December John had just led me into my box after my daily exercise, and was strapping my cloth on and James was coming in from the corn chamber with some oats, when the master came into the stable.  He looked rather serious, and held an open letter in his hand.  John fastened the door of my box, touched his cap, and waited for orders.\\n\\n\\\"Good-morning, John,\\\" said the master.  \\\"I want to know if you have any complaint to make of James.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Complaint, sir?  No, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is he industrious at his work and respectful to you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, sir, always.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You never find he slights his work when your back is turned?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Never, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's well; but I must put another question.  Have you no reason to suspect, when he goes out with the horses to exercise them or to take a message, that he stops about talking to his acquaintances, or goes into houses where he has no business, leaving the horses outside?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, sir, certainly not; and if anybody has been saying that about James, I don't believe it, and I don't mean to believe it unless I have it fairly proved before witnesses; it's not for me to say who has been trying to take away James' character, but I will say this, sir, that a steadier, pleasanter, honester, smarter young fellow I never had in this stable. I can trust his word and I can trust his work; he is gentle and clever with the horses, and I would rather have them in charge with him than with half the young fellows I know of in laced hats and liveries; and whoever wants a character of James Howard,\\\" said John, with a decided jerk of his head, \\\"let them come to John Manly.\\\"\\n\\nThe master stood all this time grave and attentive, but as John finished his speech a broad smile spread over his face, and looking kindly across at James, who all this time had stood still at the door, he said, \\\"James, my lad, set down the oats and come here; I am very glad to find that John's opinion of your character agrees so exactly with my own.  John is a cautious man,\\\" he said, with a droll smile, \\\"and it is not always easy to get his opinion about people, so I thought if I beat the bush on this side the birds would fly out, and I should learn what I wanted to know quickly; so now we will come to business.  I have a letter from my brother-in-law, Sir Clifford Williams, of Clifford Hall.  He wants me to find him a trustworthy young groom, about twenty or twenty-one, who knows his business.  His old coachman, who has lived with him thirty years, is getting feeble, and he wants a man to work with him and get into his ways, who would be able, when the old man was pensioned off, to step into his place.  He would have eighteen shillings a week at first, a stable suit, a driving suit, a bedroom over the coachhouse, and a boy under him.  Sir Clifford is a good master, and if you could get the place it would be a good start for you. I don't want to part with you, and if you left us I know John would lose his right hand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That I should, sir,\\\" said John, \\\"but I would not stand in his light for the world.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How old are you, James?\\\" said master.\\n\\n\\\"Nineteen next May, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's young; what do you think, John?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, sir, it is young; but he is as steady as a man, and is strong, and well grown, and though he has not had much experience in driving, he has a light firm hand and a quick eye, and he is very careful, and I am quite sure no horse of his will be ruined for want of having his feet and shoes looked after.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your word will go the furthest, John,\\\" said the master, \\\"for Sir Clifford adds in a postscript, \\\\`If I could find a man trained by your John I should like him better than any other;' so, James, lad, think it over, talk to your mother at dinner-time, and then let me know what you wish.\\\"\\n\\nIn a few days after this conversation it was fully settled that James should go to Clifford Hall, in a month or six weeks, as it suited his master, and in the meantime he was to get all the practice in driving that could be given to him.  I never knew the carriage to go out so often before; when the mistress did not go out the master drove himself in the two-wheeled chaise; but now, whether it was master or the young ladies, or only an errand, Ginger and I were put in the carriage and James drove us. At the first John rode with him on the box, telling him this and that, and after that James drove alone.\\n\\nThen it was wonderful what a number of places the master would go to in the city on Saturday, and what queer streets we were driven through. He was sure to go to the railway station just as the train was coming in, and cabs and carriages, carts and omnibuses were all trying to get over the bridge together; that bridge wanted good horses and good drivers when the railway bell was ringing, for it was narrow, and there was a very sharp turn up to the station, where it would not have been at all difficult for people to run into each other, if they did not look sharp and keep their wits about them.\\n\\n15      The Old Hostler\\n\\nAfter this it was decided by my master and mistress to pay a visit to some friends who lived about forty-six miles from our home, and James was to drive them.  The first day we traveled thirty-two miles. There were some long, heavy hills, but James drove so carefully and thoughtfully that we were not at all harassed.  He never forgot to put on the brake as we went downhill, nor to take it off at the right place. He kept our feet on the smoothest part of the road, and if the uphill was very long, he set the carriage wheels a little across the road, so as not to run back, and gave us a breathing.  All these little things help a horse very much, particularly if he gets kind words into the bargain.\\n\\nWe stopped once or twice on the road, and just as the sun was going down we reached the town where we were to spend the night.  We stopped at the principal hotel, which was in the market-place; it was a very large one; we drove under an archway into a long yard, at the further end of which were the stables and coachhouses.  Two hostlers came to take us out. The head hostler was a pleasant, active little man, with a crooked leg, and a yellow striped waistcoat.  I never saw a man unbuckle harness so quickly as he did, and with a pat and a good word he led me to a long stable, with six or eight stalls in it, and two or three horses. The other man brought Ginger; James stood by while we were rubbed down and cleaned.\\n\\nI never was cleaned so lightly and quickly as by that little old man. When he had done James stepped up and felt me over, as if he thought I could not be thoroughly done, but he found my coat as clean and smooth as silk.\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" he said, \\\"I thought I was pretty quick, and our John quicker still, but you do beat all I ever saw for being quick and thorough at the same time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Practice makes perfect,\\\" said the crooked little hostler, \\\"and 'twould be a pity if it didn't; forty years' practice, and not perfect! ha, ha! that would be a pity; and as to being quick, why, bless you! that is only a matter of habit; if you get into the habit of being quick it is just as easy as being slow; easier, I should say; in fact it don't agree with my health to be hulking about over a job twice as long as it need take.  Bless you! I couldn't whistle if I crawled over my work as some folks do!  You see, I have been about horses ever since I was twelve years old, in hunting stables, and racing stables; and being small, ye see, I was jockey for several years; but at the Goodwood, ye see, the turf was very slippery and my poor Larkspur got a fall, and I broke my knee, and so of course I was of no more use there. But I could not live without horses, of course I couldn't, so I took to the hotels.  And I can tell ye it is a downright pleasure to handle an animal like this, well-bred, well-mannered, well-cared-for; bless ye! I can tell how a horse is treated.  Give me the handling of a horse for twenty minutes, and I'll tell you what sort of a groom he has had. Look at this one, pleasant, quiet, turns about just as you want him, holds up his feet to be cleaned out, or anything else you please to wish; then you'll find another fidgety, fretty, won't move the right way, or starts across the stall, tosses up his head as soon as you come near him, lays his ears, and seems afraid of you; or else squares about at you with his heels.  Poor things!  I know what sort of treatment they have had. If they are timid it makes them start or shy; if they are high-mettled it makes them vicious or dangerous; their tempers are mostly made when they are young.  Bless you! they are like children, train 'em up in the way they should go, as the good book says, and when they are old they will not depart from it, if they have a chance.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I like to hear you talk,\\\" said James, \\\"that's the way we lay it down at home, at our master's.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who is your master, young man? if it be a proper question. I should judge he is a good one, from what I see.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is Squire Gordon, of Birtwick Park, the other side the Beacon Hills,\\\" said James.\\n\\n\\\"Ah! so, so, I have heard tell of him; fine judge of horses, ain't he? the best rider in the county.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I believe he is,\\\" said James, \\\"but he rides very little now, since the poor young master was killed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah! poor gentleman; I read all about it in the paper at the time. A fine horse killed, too, wasn't there?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said James; \\\"he was a splendid creature, brother to this one, and just like him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Pity! pity!\\\" said the old man; \\\"'twas a bad place to leap, if I remember; a thin fence at top, a steep bank down to the stream, wasn't it? No chance for a horse to see where he is going.  Now, I am for bold riding as much as any man, but still there are some leaps that only a very knowing old huntsman has any right to take.  A man's life and a horse's life are worth more than a fox's tail; at least, I should say they ought to be.\\\"\\n\\nDuring this time the other man had finished Ginger and had brought our corn, and James and the old man left the stable together.\\n\\n16      The Fire\\n\\nLater on in the evening a traveler's horse was brought in by the second hostler, and while he was cleaning him a young man with a pipe in his mouth lounged into the stable to gossip.\\n\\n\\\"I say, Towler,\\\" said the hostler, \\\"just run up the ladder into the loft and put some hay down into this horse's rack, will you? only lay down your pipe.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All right,\\\" said the other, and went up through the trapdoor; and I heard him step across the floor overhead and put down the hay. James came in to look at us the last thing, and then the door was locked.\\n\\nI cannot say how long I had slept, nor what time in the night it was, but I woke up very uncomfortable, though I hardly knew why.  I got up; the air seemed all thick and choking.  I heard Ginger coughing and one of the other horses seemed very restless; it was quite dark, and I could see nothing, but the stable seemed full of smoke, and I hardly knew how to breathe.\\n\\nThe trapdoor had been left open, and I thought that was the place it came through.  I listened, and heard a soft rushing sort of noise and a low crackling and snapping.  I did not know what it was, but there was something in the sound so strange that it made me tremble all over. The other horses were all awake; some were pulling at their halters, others stamping.\\n\\nAt last I heard steps outside, and the hostler who had put up the traveler's horse burst into the stable with a lantern, and began to untie the horses, and try to lead them out; but he seemed in such a hurry and so frightened himself that he frightened me still more.  The first horse would not go with him; he tried the second and third, and they too would not stir. He came to me next and tried to drag me out of the stall by force; of course that was no use.  He tried us all by turns and then left the stable.\\n\\nNo doubt we were very foolish, but danger seemed to be all round, and there was nobody we knew to trust in, and all was strange and uncertain. The fresh air that had come in through the open door made it easier to breathe, but the rushing sound overhead grew louder, and as I looked upward through the bars of my empty rack I saw a red light flickering on the wall.  Then I heard a cry of \\\"Fire!\\\" outside, and the old hostler quietly and quickly came in; he got one horse out, and went to another, but the flames were playing round the trapdoor, and the roaring overhead was dreadful.\\n\\nThe next thing I heard was James' voice, quiet and cheery, as it always was.\\n\\n\\\"Come, my beauties, it is time for us to be off, so wake up and come along.\\\" I stood nearest the door, so he came to me first, patting me as he came in.\\n\\n\\\"Come, Beauty, on with your bridle, my boy, we'll soon be out of this smother.\\\"  It was on in no time; then he took the scarf off his neck, and tied it lightly over my eyes, and patting and coaxing he led me out of the stable.  Safe in the yard, he slipped the scarf off my eyes, and shouted, \\\"Here somebody! take this horse while I go back for the other.\\\"\\n\\nA tall, broad man stepped forward and took me, and James darted back into the stable.  I set up a shrill whinny as I saw him go. Ginger told me afterward that whinny was the best thing I could have done for her, for had she not heard me outside she would never have had courage to come out.\\n\\nThere was much confusion in the yard; the horses being got out of other stables, and the carriages and gigs being pulled out of houses and sheds, lest the flames should spread further. On the other side the yard windows were thrown up, and people were shouting all sorts of things; but I kept my eye fixed on the stable door, where the smoke poured out thicker than ever, and I could see flashes of red light; presently I heard above all the stir and din a loud, clear voice, which I knew was master's:\\n\\n\\\"James Howard! James Howard!  Are you there?\\\"  There was no answer, but I heard a crash of something falling in the stable, and the next moment I gave a loud, joyful neigh, for I saw James coming through the smoke leading Ginger with him; she was coughing violently, and he was not able to speak.\\n\\n\\\"My brave lad!\\\" said master, laying his hand on his shoulder, \\\"are you hurt?\\\"\\n\\nJames shook his head, for he could not yet speak.\\n\\n\\\"Ay,\\\" said the big man who held me; \\\"he is a brave lad, and no mistake.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And now,\\\" said master, \\\"when you have got your breath, James, we'll get out of this place as quickly as we can,\\\" and we were moving toward the entry, when from the market-place there came a sound of galloping feet and loud rumbling wheels.\\n\\n\\\"'Tis the fire-engine! the fire-engine!\\\" shouted two or three voices, \\\"stand back, make way!\\\" and clattering and thundering over the stones two horses dashed into the yard with a heavy engine behind them.  The firemen leaped to the ground; there was no need to ask where the fire was -- it was rolling up in a great blaze from the roof.\\n\\nWe got out as fast as we could into the broad quiet market-place; the stars were shining, and except the noise behind us, all was still. Master led the way to a large hotel on the other side, and as soon as the hostler came, he said, \\\"James, I must now hasten to your mistress; I trust the horses entirely to you, order whatever you think is needed,\\\" and with that he was gone. The master did not run, but I never saw mortal man walk so fast as he did that night.\\n\\nThere was a dreadful sound before we got into our stalls -- the shrieks of those poor horses that were left burning to death in the stable -- it was very terrible! and made both Ginger and me feel very bad.  We, however, were taken in and well done by.\\n\\nThe next morning the master came to see how we were and to speak to James. I did not hear much, for the hostler was rubbing me down, but I could see that James looked very happy, and I thought the master was proud of him.  Our mistress had been so much alarmed in the night that the journey was put off till the afternoon, so James had the morning on hand, and went first to the inn to see about our harness and the carriage, and then to hear more about the fire.  When he came back we heard him tell the hostler about it.  At first no one could guess how the fire had been caused, but at last a man said he saw Dick Towler go into the stable with a pipe in his mouth, and when he came out he had not one, and went to the tap for another.  Then the under hostler said he had asked Dick to go up the ladder to put down some hay, but told him to lay down his pipe first.  Dick denied taking the pipe with him, but no one believed him.  I remember our John Manly's rule, never to allow a pipe in the stable, and thought it ought to be the rule everywhere.\\n\\nJames said the roof and floor had all fallen in, and that only the black walls were standing; the two poor horses that could not be got out were buried under the burnt rafters and tiles.\\n\\n17      John Manly's Talk\\n\\nThe rest of our journey was very easy, and a little after sunset we reached the house of my master's friend.  We were taken into a clean, snug stable; there was a kind coachman, who made us very comfortable, and who seemed to think a good deal of James when he heard about the fire.\\n\\n\\\"There is one thing quite clear, young man,\\\" he said, \\\"your horses know who they can trust; it is one of the hardest things in the world to get horses out of a stable when there is either fire or flood. I don't know why they won't come out, but they won't -- not one in twenty.\\\"\\n\\nWe stopped two or three days at this place and then returned home. All went well on the journey; we were glad to be in our own stable again, and John was equally glad to see us.\\n\\nBefore he and James left us for the night James said, \\\"I wonder who is coming in my place.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Little Joe Green at the lodge,\\\" said John.\\n\\n\\\"Little Joe Green! why, he's a child!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is fourteen and a half,\\\" said John.\\n\\n\\\"But he is such a little chap!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, he is small, but he is quick and willing, and kind-hearted, too, and then he wishes very much to come, and his father would like it; and I know the master would like to give him the chance. He said if I thought he would not do he would look out for a bigger boy; but I said I was quite agreeable to try him for six weeks.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Six weeks!\\\" said James; \\\"why, it will be six months before he can be of much use!  It will make you a deal of work, John.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said John with a laugh, \\\"work and I are very good friends; I never was afraid of work yet.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are a very good man,\\\" said James.  \\\"I wish I may ever be like you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't often speak of myself,\\\" said John, \\\"but as you are going away from us out into the world to shift for yourself I'll just tell you how I look on these things.  I was just as old as Joseph when my father and mother died of the fever within ten days of each other, and left me and my cripple sister Nelly alone in the world, without a relation that we could look to for help.  I was a farmer's boy, not earning enough to keep myself, much less both of us, and she must have gone to the workhouse but for our mistress (Nelly calls her her angel, and she has good right to do so). She went and hired a room for her with old Widow Mallet, and she gave her knitting and needlework when she was able to do it; and when she was ill she sent her dinners and many nice, comfortable things, and was like a mother to her.  Then the master he took me into the stable under old Norman, the coachman that was then.  I had my food at the house and my bed in the loft, and a suit of clothes, and three shillings a week, so that I could help Nelly.  Then there was Norman; he might have turned round and said at his age he could not be troubled with a raw boy from the plow-tail, but he was like a father to me, and took no end of pains with me.  When the old man died some years after I stepped into his place, and now of course I have top wages, and can lay by for a rainy day or a sunny day, as it may happen, and Nelly is as happy as a bird.  So you see, James, I am not the man that should turn up his nose at a little boy and vex a good, kind master. No, no! I shall miss you very much, James, but we shall pull through, and there's nothing like doing a kindness when 'tis put in your way, and I am glad I can do it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then,\\\" said James, \\\"you don't hold with that saying, \\\\`Everybody look after himself, and take care of number one'?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, indeed,\\\" said John, \\\"where should I and Nelly have been if master and mistress and old Norman had only taken care of number one? Why, she in the workhouse and I hoeing turnips!  Where would Black Beauty and Ginger have been if you had only thought of number one? why, roasted to death!  No, Jim, no! that is a selfish, heathenish saying, whoever uses it; and any man who thinks he has nothing to do but take care of number one, why, it's a pity but what he had been drowned like a puppy or a kitten, before he got his eyes open; that's what I think,\\\" said John, with a very decided jerk of his head.\\n\\nJames laughed at this; but there was a thickness in his voice when he said, \\\"You have been my best friend except my mother; I hope you won't forget me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, lad, no!\\\" said John, \\\"and if ever I can do you a good turn I hope you won't forget me.\\\"\\n\\nThe next day Joe came to the stables to learn all he could before James left. He learned to sweep the stable, to bring in the straw and hay; he began to clean the harness, and helped to wash the carriage. As he was quite too short to do anything in the way of grooming Ginger and me, James taught him upon Merrylegs, for he was to have full charge of him, under John.  He was a nice little bright fellow, and always came whistling to his work.\\n\\nMerrylegs was a good deal put out at being \\\"mauled about,\\\" as he said, \\\"by a boy who knew nothing;\\\" but toward the end of the second week he told me confidentially that he thought the boy would turn out well.\\n\\nAt last the day came when James had to leave us; cheerful as he always was, he looked quite down-hearted that morning.\\n\\n\\\"You see,\\\" he said to John, \\\"I am leaving a great deal behind; my mother and Betsy, and you, and a good master and mistress, and then the horses, and my old Merrylegs.  At the new place there will not be a soul that I shall know.  If it were not that I shall get a higher place, and be able to help my mother better, I don't think I should have made up my mind to it; it is a real pinch, John.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ay, James, lad, so it is; but I should not think much of you if you could leave your home for the first time and not feel it.  Cheer up, you'll make friends there; and if you get on well, as I am sure you will, it will be a fine thing for your mother, and she will be proud enough that you have got into such a good place as that.\\\"\\n\\nSo John cheered him up, but every one was sorry to lose James; as for Merrylegs, he pined after him for several days, and went quite off his appetite.  So John took him out several mornings with a leading rein, when he exercised me, and, trotting and galloping by my side, got up the little fellow's spirits again, and he was soon all right.\\n\\nJoe's father would often come in and give a little help, as he understood the work; and Joe took a great deal of pains to learn, and John was quite encouraged about him.\\n\\n18      Going for the Doctor\\n\\nOne night, a few days after James had left, I had eaten my hay and was lying down in my straw fast asleep, when I was suddenly roused by the stable bell ringing very loud.  I heard the door of John's house open, and his feet running up to the hall.  He was back again in no time; he unlocked the stable door, and came in, calling out, \\\"Wake up, Beauty! You must go well now, if ever you did;\\\" and almost before I could think he had got the saddle on my back and the bridle on my head. He just ran round for his coat, and then took me at a quick trot up to the hall door.  The squire stood there, with a lamp in his hand.\\n\\n\\\"Now, John,\\\" he said, \\\"ride for your life -- that is, for your mistress' life; there is not a moment to lose. Give this note to Dr. White; give your horse a rest at the inn, and be back as soon as you can.\\\"\\n\\nJohn said, \\\"Yes, sir,\\\" and was on my back in a minute. The gardener who lived at the lodge had heard the bell ring, and was ready with the gate open, and away we went through the park, and through the village, and down the hill till we came to the toll-gate. John called very loud and thumped upon the door; the man was soon out and flung open the gate.\\n\\n\\\"Now,\\\" said John, \\\"do you keep the gate open for the doctor; here's the money,\\\" and off he went again.\\n\\nThere was before us a long piece of level road by the river side; John said to me, \\\"Now, Beauty, do your best,\\\" and so I did; I wanted no whip nor spur, and for two miles I galloped as fast as I could lay my feet to the ground; I don't believe that my old grandfather, who won the race at Newmarket, could have gone faster.  When we came to the bridge John pulled me up a little and patted my neck.  \\\"Well done, Beauty! good old fellow,\\\" he said.  He would have let me go slower, but my spirit was up, and I was off again as fast as before. The air was frosty, the moon was bright; it was very pleasant. We came through a village, then through a dark wood, then uphill, then downhill, till after eight miles' run we came to the town, through the streets and into the market-place.  It was all quite still except the clatter of my feet on the stones -- everybody was asleep. The church clock struck three as we drew up at Dr. White's door. John rang the bell twice, and then knocked at the door like thunder. A window was thrown up, and Dr. White, in his nightcap, put his head out and said, \\\"What do you want?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mrs. Gordon is very ill, sir; master wants you to go at once; he thinks she will die if you cannot get there.  Here is a note.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Wait,\\\" he said, \\\"I will come.\\\"\\n\\nHe shut the window, and was soon at the door.\\n\\n\\\"The worst of it is,\\\" he said, \\\"that my horse has been out all day and is quite done up; my son has just been sent for, and he has taken the other.  What is to be done?  Can I have your horse?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He has come at a gallop nearly all the way, sir, and I was to give him a rest here; but I think my master would not be against it, if you think fit, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All right,\\\" he said; \\\"I will soon be ready.\\\"\\n\\nJohn stood by me and stroked my neck; I was very hot.  The doctor came out with his riding-whip.\\n\\n\\\"You need not take that, sir,\\\" said John; \\\"Black Beauty will go till he drops.  Take care of him, sir, if you can; I should not like any harm to come to him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, no, John,\\\" said the doctor, \\\"I hope not,\\\" and in a minute we had left John far behind.\\n\\nI will not tell about our way back.  The doctor was a heavier man than John, and not so good a rider; however, I did my very best. The man at the toll-gate had it open.  When we came to the hill the doctor drew me up.  \\\"Now, my good fellow,\\\" he said, \\\"take some breath.\\\" I was glad he did, for I was nearly spent, but that breathing helped me on, and soon we were in the park.  Joe was at the lodge gate; my master was at the hall door, for he had heard us coming. He spoke not a word; the doctor went into the house with him, and Joe led me to the stable.  I was glad to get home; my legs shook under me, and I could only stand and pant. I had not a dry hair on my body, the water ran down my legs, and I steamed all over, Joe used to say, like a pot on the fire. Poor Joe! he was young and small, and as yet he knew very little, and his father, who would have helped him, had been sent to the next village; but I am sure he did the very best he knew.  He rubbed my legs and my chest, but he did not put my warm cloth on me; he thought I was so hot I should not like it.  Then he gave me a pailful of water to drink; it was cold and very good, and I drank it all; then he gave me some hay and some corn, and thinking he had done right, he went away. Soon I began to shake and tremble, and turned deadly cold; my legs ached, my loins ached, and my chest ached, and I felt sore all over. Oh! how I wished for my warm, thick cloth, as I stood and trembled. I wished for John, but he had eight miles to walk, so I lay down in my straw and tried to go to sleep.  After a long while I heard John at the door; I gave a low moan, for I was in great pain.  He was at my side in a moment, stooping down by me.  I could not tell him how I felt, but he seemed to know it all; he covered me up with two or three warm cloths, and then ran to the house for some hot water; he made me some warm gruel, which I drank, and then I think I went to sleep.\\n\\nJohn seemed to be very much put out.  I heard him say to himself over and over again, \\\"Stupid boy! stupid boy! no cloth put on, and I dare say the water was cold, too; boys are no good;\\\" but Joe was a good boy, after all.\\n\\nI was now very ill; a strong inflammation had attacked my lungs, and I could not draw my breath without pain.  John nursed me night and day; he would get up two or three times in the night to come to me. My master, too, often came to see me.  \\\"My poor Beauty,\\\" he said one day, \\\"my good horse, you saved your mistress' life, Beauty; yes, you saved her life.\\\"  I was very glad to hear that, for it seems the doctor had said if we had been a little longer it would have been too late.  John told my master he never saw a horse go so fast in his life.  It seemed as if the horse knew what was the matter. Of course I did, though John thought not; at least I knew as much as this -- that John and I must go at the top of our speed, and that it was for the sake of the mistress.\\n\\n19      Only Ignorance\\n\\nI do not know how long I was ill.  Mr. Bond, the horse-doctor, came every day.  One day he bled me; John held a pail for the blood. I felt very faint after it and thought I should die, and I believe they all thought so too.\\n\\nGinger and Merrylegs had been moved into the other stable, so that I might be quiet, for the fever made me very quick of hearing; any little noise seemed quite loud, and I could tell every one's footstep going to and from the house.  I knew all that was going on. One night John had to give me a draught; Thomas Green came in to help him. After I had taken it and John had made me as comfortable as he could, he said he should stay half an hour to see how the medicine settled. Thomas said he would stay with him, so they went and sat down on a bench that had been brought into Merrylegs' stall, and put down the lantern at their feet, that I might not be disturbed with the light.\\n\\nFor awhile both men sat silent, and then Tom Green said in a low voice:\\n\\n\\\"I wish, John, you'd say a bit of a kind word to Joe. The boy is quite broken-hearted; he can't eat his meals, and he can't smile. He says he knows it was all his fault, though he is sure he did the best he knew, and he says if Beauty dies no one will ever speak to him again. It goes to my heart to hear him.  I think you might give him just a word; he is not a bad boy.\\\"\\n\\nAfter a short pause John said slowly, \\\"You must not be too hard upon me, Tom. I know he meant no harm, I never said he did; I know he is not a bad boy. But you see, I am sore myself; that horse is the pride of my heart, to say nothing of his being such a favorite with the master and mistress; and to think that his life may be flung away in this manner is more than I can bear.  But if you think I am hard on the boy I will try to give him a good word to-morrow -- that is, I mean if Beauty is better.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, John, thank you.  I knew you did not wish to be too hard, and I am glad you see it was only ignorance.\\\"\\n\\nJohn's voice almost startled me as he answered:\\n\\n\\\"Only ignorance! only ignorance! how can you talk about only ignorance? Don't you know that it is the worst thing in the world, next to wickedness? -- and which does the most mischief heaven only knows.  If people can say, \\\\`Oh! I did not know, I did not mean any harm,' they think it is all right. I suppose Martha Mulwash did not mean to kill that baby when she dosed it with Dalby and soothing syrups; but she did kill it, and was tried for manslaughter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And serve her right, too,\\\" said Tom.  \\\"A woman should not undertake to nurse a tender little child without knowing what is good and what is bad for it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Bill Starkey,\\\" continued John, \\\"did not mean to frighten his brother into fits when he dressed up like a ghost and ran after him in the moonlight; but he did; and that bright, handsome little fellow, that might have been the pride of any mother's heart is just no better than an idiot, and never will be, if he lives to be eighty years old. You were a good deal cut up yourself, Tom, two weeks ago, when those young ladies left your hothouse door open, with a frosty east wind blowing right in; you said it killed a good many of your plants.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A good many!\\\" said Tom; \\\"there was not one of the tender cuttings that was not nipped off.  I shall have to strike all over again, and the worst of it is that I don't know where to go to get fresh ones. I was nearly mad when I came in and saw what was done.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And yet,\\\" said John, \\\"I am sure the young ladies did not mean it; it was only ignorance.\\\"\\n\\nI heard no more of this conversation, for the medicine did well and sent me to sleep, and in the morning I felt much better; but I often thought of John's words when I came to know more of the world.\\n\\n20      Joe Green\\n\\nJoe Green went on very well; he learned quickly, and was so attentive and careful that John began to trust him in many things; but as I have said, he was small of his age, and it was seldom that he was allowed to exercise either Ginger or me; but it so happened one morning that John was out with Justice in the luggage cart, and the master wanted a note to be taken immediately to a gentleman's house, about three miles distant, and sent his orders for Joe to saddle me and take it, adding the caution that he was to ride steadily.\",\"timestamp\":1641275238,\"title\":\"\\nOne day when John and I had been out on some business of our master's, \"},\"digest\":\"STZ3RY3HIFFbTjn7iXygco2i7PYh478L7OIPMyBelgs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4FEa0511D28B2e43455B26d9Bb2E5c7B7044985a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Kmec29nDMTPXDXsKQwdNAoZ7mGTYauQ7B5gamJeVXl8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"hAq0fsmd6irkxbVAIKoKrJYfDuBsODQk6xy-R2_TZaU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"xe_ZU8zJj4O-cWhk6MqbG_lMedjIg-W2y8OVONJ4b0Xc_hrWrF0a1oyv534aTQLEqHNJV3v9VnAW04XcPT0Mrg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc617d04a1d7b29a03d00011398d8db80821ef22ebe7335b21d477881e7f25fb3200017db16718e9c10ede411b855363bb03af6b6f4c53f444a643a18e31dfa0d1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Kmec29nDMTPXDXsKQwdNAoZ7mGTYauQ7B5gamJeVXl8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"hAq0fsmd6irkxbVAIKoKrJYfDuBsODQk6xy-R2_TZaU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"STZ3RY3HIFFbTjn7iXygco2i7PYh478L7OIPMyBelgs\"}"
