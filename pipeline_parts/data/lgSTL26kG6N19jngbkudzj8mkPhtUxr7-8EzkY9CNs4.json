With a tx hash, POB fetches metadata related to the transaction from Ethereum nodes.\\n2.  With the blockchain transaction data as a source of truth, a ‘gene’ is created that describes all the parameters to produce a generative artwork. The ‘gene’ traits are directly correlated to transaction data.\\n3.  With the gene, an artwork can be produced by the generative process; the output is what you see on [pob.studio](https://pob.studio/). \\n\\nFor the curious and developer minded, feel free to browse the open-sourced gateway to learn about the nuances of how the three steps above are achieved.\\n\\nIn the UI, six ‘traits’ are highlighted to help art collectors and speculators get a sense on how the artwork is drawn. By no means are these labels ‘visually’ accurate and only represent what the traits numerically represent. I hope that the following quick read will help explain, in layman terms what these traits suggest about the artwork.\\n\\n## Texture\\n\\nPOB leverages a comic book inspired ‘dot texture’ to provide visual complexity to the quarter circles. The effect helps to introduce subtle color changes, noise, and visual focus to the artworks.\\n\\nTexture in the artwork is loosely derived with the following formula:\\n\\n    const texture = gasUsed / gasLimit;\\n\\nWhen gas used is closer to the gas limit, the dot grid is denser and creates a visually ‘smooth’ grain texture.\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3df51ac8-afb7-4ee7-9fb0-6b3888cd0b97\\\\_371x278.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3df51ac8-afb7-4ee7-9fb0-6b3888cd0b97\\\\_371x278.png)\\n\\nA smoother grain texture created with the dot texture\\n\\nHere is an artificially induced ‘low’ texture artwork to help highlight the contrast.\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e1b93ad-70af-458c-928e-2c68923bd5a0\\\\_455x287.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e1b93ad-70af-458c-928e-2c68923bd5a0\\\\_455x287.png)\\n\\nSo much SPAAAACE\\n\\nWith this trait design, hopefully artworks with lower texture values are rarer and more valuable.\\n\\n## Grid\\n\\nThe ‘grid’ trait perhaps is the most influential trait. Larger grids mean the quarter circles are drawn bigger and smaller grids, smaller quarter circles.\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48bdaf5b-85e3-4738-9244-33c1010e6012\\\\_1743x985.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48bdaf5b-85e3-4738-9244-33c1010e6012\\\\_1743x985.png)\\n\\nThe grid size is dictated by gas price. The lower the gas price, the smaller the grid, and vice-versa.\\n\\nWith this trait design, hopefully larger more visually ‘strong’ artworks are rarer as high gas price transactions are fewer.\\n\\n## Complexity\\n\\nComplexity is a very ambiguous trait. It generally describes the compositional design of the artworks. Should this area be left empty, or that area? Higher complexity doesn’t imply an artwork is visually better, but offers opportunities for more unique outputs.\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0c96a96-0b54-4379-94b4-e2b6e18cbd1c\\\\_1743x985.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0c96a96-0b54-4379-94b4-e2b6e18cbd1c\\\\_1743x985.png)\\n\\nComplexity is linearly related to the nonce. The higher the nonce, the higher the complexity value.\\n\\nWhile complexity value doesn’t tie to an artworks visual quality, it does allow for more interesting artworks. It is left to art speculators and collectors to be the judge of its quality.\\n\\n## Size Diversity\\n\\nFor each color palette, the quarter circles are drawn in a number of varying sizes. The chance for larger size circles to occur is linearly related to the amount of ETH transferred in the transaction.\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa91a8486-c502-499a-bccb-5576a6d1c532\\\\_1743x985.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa91a8486-c502-499a-bccb-5576a6d1c532\\\\_1743x985.png)\\n\\nThe higher the ETH, the higher the chance you see a diverse collection of quarter circle sizes in the artwork.\\n\\n## Number of palettes\\n\\nTo pay homage to proof of work, POB uses a similar mechanism to determine the number of palettes in the artwork.\\n\\nAll artworks will have two palettes at the minimum. Each palette dictates a layer of quarter circles seen in the artwork. Some transactions will have more palettes. The number of palettes is largely dictated by the number of leading zeros in the hexadecimal hash string.\\n\\n    // 2 color palettes\\n    0x5FC0F...\\n    // 3 color palettes\\n    0x0AB15...\\n    // 8 color palettes ???\\n    0x00000...\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b4befda-a0ae-411f-a25a-9c52c1e6dc12\\\\_940x1514.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b4befda-a0ae-411f-a25a-9c52c1e6dc12\\\\_940x1514.png)\\n\\nArtwork with 3 palettes\\n\\nThe next question to ask: how are the palette colors chosen?\\n\\nEach color palette is deterministically picked with an address; as in, an Ethereum address maps to a color palette.\\n\\n    colorPalleteDeterminer(address) => 4 colors;\\n\\nSome popular addresses are mapped to their own brand colors while most other addresses map to POB’s own collection of palettes.\\n\\nThe final part: which addresses are used to select the **x** palettes used in the artwork?\\n\\nThe art process uses this format of addresses:\\n\\n    [ toAddress, fromAddress, addressFromLogs[0] ... addressFromLogs[x] ]\\n\\nIf there is one leading zero, then the addresses used would be:\\n\\n    [ toAddress, fromAddress, addressFromLogs[0]]\\n\\nColor palette for an address can be easily viewed by the following link:\\n\\nhttps\\\\://pob.studio/palette/0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d\\n\\nInput any address in the place of 0x7a250… to see what color palette you would expect from a transaction that interacts with the address in the link.\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6cfb83a-52b7-4589-8d13-2ac6b4c7193b\\\\_681x385.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6cfb83a-52b7-4589-8d13-2ac6b4c7193b\\\\_681x385.png)\\n\\nTo note, I glanced over some of the design details with how color palettes are selected, consult the code to learn more.\\n\\nHopefully the trait designs spurs collectors to ‘mine’ and collect artworks that are historically relevant and visually interesting. Some visual features are rarer and may be assessed at a higher value. Getting the ‘just right’ amount of each trait to create a desired aesthetic will be a unique skill developed by a few in the community.
