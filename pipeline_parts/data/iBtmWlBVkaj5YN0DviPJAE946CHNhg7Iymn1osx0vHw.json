"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"With video content production entirely off my hands, I've been taking a few weeks off recently to sit and conceptualize the leap forward with my partners into the [web3-oriented realm](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/05/business/dealbook/what-is-web3.html). The short backstory: after a few pretty uneventful attempts at creating a promising web2 digital studio in Russia, we started discussing during the summer of 2021 the next steps in our business endeavors and where we see our collaboration the next couple of years. The web3 as a market (or the fundamental technological background even) didn't come to my attention till the end of August. That was the moment of revelation, where suddenly everything became extremely clear and incredibly complicated. The most obvious question is: **how do you approach migrating from a centralized layer to a decentralized in an organic way while keeping the same level of understanding within the team?**\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JSMwv6THJ54vcSwJEoIcN.jpeg?height=1280&width=848)\\n\\nSo, with this post, **I want to point out the key steps that we as a team of entrepreneurs and artists will implement from this moment**. It's the principles of web2-web3 migration of sorts, which we hope will lay the ground for future projects as we enter the entirely unknown space. While writing this, I've noticed the irony of the situation: our previously manifested objective as a digital studio has been to transform into a “kind-of Goodby Silverstein.\\\" We wanted to be a big corporation with lots of internal corporate gimmicks. Until one day, we stumbled upon a [HAWRAF archive](https://www.fastcompany.com/90315699/how-to-design-the-end-of-a-studios-life) and figured that it's never going to work out the way we wanted with basically the same level of resources and input. Perhaps we don't need to be an enormous creative conglomerate with many responsibility levels. It's simply no longer a sufficient model for a future. Flexibility and interoperability are.\\n\\n*Here it goes.*\\n\\n1. **Try a lot, try at a fast pace, and make quick decisions.** The price of error is as low as it has ever been. If stuck, abandon one concept, start another one. Make mistakes, try different approaches. If there's an open-source solution for your problem – use it. Don't try t invent the bicycle. Every problem has to be solved once.\\n2. **Don't punish yourself with a single solution.** At the moment, for us, it's not about the specific chain, API, or a market share: we are at the point where creative ideas > integration inside a particular technology. The question is not *\\\"how to throw ourselves into the future vision of the metaverse by [Meta](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/),\\\"* but rather *\\\"what can we do now with the instruments at our disposal to create something unique and long withstanding that will have all the qualifications to drive the creative market for web3\\\"*. Don't try to swallow the whole space with one giant slurp – web3 is vast and borderless.\\n3. **Educate your team and the audience/clients you already have.** It's still very early, and in our optics, as an ex-web2 studio, the most straightforward steps are about simply explaining stuff: from what the metaverse actually is to how to store your digital goods safely. Prepare yourself and your audience for the future.\\n4. **Collaborate a lot.** At the current pace, a new team enters the playfield each day. It's up to you to either throw yourself into the \\\"winner takes all\\\" competition mentality or try to create something more significant than the sum of your parts and ideas. Web3 is about collaboration across people, governments, and technologies.\\n5. **Show your work.** Visibility is the key. Whatever the reaction.\\n6. **Everything is possible.** You're here for the long run, so enjoy the journey as much as possible.\",\"timestamp\":1639317316,\"title\":\"\\\"This web3 thing of yours sounds nice – so what's next?\\\"\"},\"digest\":\"wDn75GY24Auu8pUdHJ_E9l3Fcx9Hx8yCrIVksCXOILk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xCfc4BF2ccD9bc5a3F91225c39c40Cdd57F041cf6\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"W6_ht8lcstIWkOLWSWf4nfER0q6qI3ErDV2QsXl-1kg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"iONp4WjvW0zBBAQU3moX9Jj5uf4M0Rc4-i2UmKY5VbI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"QFcZAS6qSJGsr_8yyBC7r-JLBa06Ft9s_QxiCOvKAYptl20_I-vh8l4GUHrlIdJ_piLRZChsVacDISeiir6Eig\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x172975744f16fdfa83664f649e4e65cbf195e813508bc7f49538176a89b9dacc65499c425a01092ce9b142abd13f7f00b8faa3d9685a7ffbb0f31f33c3a8defa1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"W6_ht8lcstIWkOLWSWf4nfER0q6qI3ErDV2QsXl-1kg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"iONp4WjvW0zBBAQU3moX9Jj5uf4M0Rc4-i2UmKY5VbI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"d7LV2wxtvH-VHSVPhfLfPDYu5NBgGF3LyicP94I6l8M\"}"
