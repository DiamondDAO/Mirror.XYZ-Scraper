"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Male and Female -- Slate-colored above, with a greenish-yellow or   bronze patch in the middle of the back. Chin, throat, and   breast yellow. A black, bluish, or rufous band across the   breast, usually lacking in female. Underneath white, sometimes   marked with rufous on sides, but these markings are variable.   Wings have two white patches; outer tail feathers have white   patch near the end. Range -- Eastern North America. Winters from Florida southward. Migrations -- April. October. Summer resident.\\n\\nThrough an open window of an apartment in the very heart of New York City, a parula warbler flew this spring of 1897, surely the daintiest, most exquisitely beautiful bird visitor that ever voluntarily lodged between two brick walls.\\n\\nA number of such airy, tiny beauties flitting about among the blossoms of the shrubbery on a bright May morning and swaying on the slenderest branches with their inimitable grace, is a sight that the memory should retain into old age. They seem the very embodiment of life, joy, beauty, grace; of everything lovely that birds by any possibility could be. Apparently they are wafted about the garden; they fly with no more effort than a dainty lifting of the wings, as if to catch the breeze, that seems to lift them as it might a bunch of thistledown. They go through a great variety of charming posturings as they hunt for their food upon the blossoms and tender fresh twigs, now creeping like a nuthatch along the bark and peering into the crevices, now gracefully swaying and balancing like a goldfinch upon a slender, pendent stem. One little sprite pauses in its hunt for the insects to raise its pretty head and trill a short and wiry song.\\n\\nBut the parula warbler does not remain long about the gardens and orchards, though it will not forsake us altogether for the Canadian forests, where most of its relatives pass the summer. It retreats only to the woods near the water, if may be, or to just as close a counterpart of a swampy southern woods, where the Spanish or Usnea \\\"moss\\\" drapes itself over the cypresses, as it can find here at the north. Its rarely \\\\[found,\\\\] beautiful nest, that hangs suspended from a slender branch very much like the Baltimore oriole's, is so woven and festooned with this moss that its concealment is perfect.\\n\\nBLACK-THROATED BLUE WARBLER (Dendroica caerulescens) Wood Warbler family\\n\\nLength -- 5.30 inches. About an inch shorter than the English   sparrow. Male -- Slate-color, not blue above; lightest on forehead and   darkest on lower back. Wings and tail edged with bluish.   Cheeks, chin, throat, upper breast, and sides black. Breast and   underneath white. White spots on wings, and a little white on   tail. Female -- Olive-green above; underneath soiled yellow. Wing-spots   inconspicuous. Tail generally has a faint bluish tinge. Range -- Eastern North America, from Labrador to tropics, where   It winters. Migrations -- May. September. Usually a migrant only in the   United States.\\n\\nWhoever looks for this beautifully marked warbler among the bluebirds, will wish that the man who named him had possessed a truer eye for color. But if the name so illy fits the bright slate-colored male, how grieved must be his little olive-and-yellow mate to answer to the name of black-throated blue warbler when she has neither a black throat nor a blue feather! It is not easy to distinguish her as she flits about the twigs and leaves of the garden in May or early autumn, except as she is seen in company with her husband, whose name she has taken with him for better or for worse. The white spot on the wings should always be looked for to positively identify this bird.\\n\\nBefore flying up to a twig to peck off the insects, the birds have a pretty vireo trick of cocking their heads on one side to investigate the quantity hidden underneath the leaves. They seem less nervous and more deliberate than many of their restless family.\\n\\nMost warblers go over the Canada border to nest, but there are many records of the nests of this species in the Alleghanies as far south as Georgia, in the Catskills, in Connecticut, northern Minnesota and Michigan. Laurel thickets and moist undergrowth of woods in the United States, and more commonly pine woods in Canada, are the favorite nesting haunts. A sharp zip, zip, like some midsummer insect's noise, is the bird's call-note, but its love-song, zee, zee, zee, or twee, twea, twea-e-e, as one authority writes it, is only rarely heard in the migrations. It is a languid, drawling little strain, with an upward slide that is easily drowned in the full bird chorus of May.\\n\\nBLUE AND BLUISH BIRDS\\n\\nBluebird   Indigo Bunting   Belted Kingfisher   Blue Jay   Blue Grosbeak   Barn Swallow   Cliff Swallow   Mourning Dove   Blue-gray Gnatcatcher\\n\\nLook also among Slate-colored Birds in preceding group, particularly among the Warblers there, or in the group of Birds conspicuously Yellow and Orange.\\n\\nBLUE AND BLUISH BIRDS\\n\\nTHE BLUEBIRD (Sialia sialis) Thrush family\\n\\nCalled also: BLUE ROBIN; \\\\[EASTERN BLUEBIRD, AOU 1998\\\\]\\n\\nLength -- 7 inches. About an inch longer than the English   sparrow. Male -- Upper parts, wings, and tail bright blue, with rusty wash   in autumn. Throat, breast, and sides cinnamon-red. Underneath   white. Female -- Has duller blue feathers, washed with gray, and a paler   breast than male. Range -- North America, from Nova Scotia. and Manitoba to Gulf of   Mexico. Southward in winter from Middle States to Bermuda and   West Indies. Migrations -- March. November. Summer resident. A few sometimes   remain throughout the winter.\\n\\nWith the first soft, plaintive warble of the bluebirds early in March, the sugar camps, waiting for their signal, take on a bustling activity; the farmer looks to his plough; orders are hurried off to the seedsmen; a fever to be out of doors seizes one: spring is here. Snowstorms may yet whiten fields and gardens, high winds may howl about the trees and chimneys, but the little blue heralds persistently proclaim from the orchard and garden that the spring procession has begun to move.Tru-al-ly, tru-al-ly, they sweetly assert to our incredulous ears.\\n\\nThe bluebird is not always a migrant, except in the more northern portions of the country. Some representatives there are always with us, but the great majority winter south and drop out of the spring procession on its way northward, the males a little ahead of their mates, which show housewifely instincts immediately after their arrival. A pair of these rather undemonstrative  matter-of-fact lovers go about looking for some deserted woodpecker's hole in the orchard, peering into cavities in the fence-rails, or into the bird-houses that, once set up in the  old-fashioned gardens for their special benefit, are now appropriated too often by the ubiquitous sparrow. Wrens they can readily dispossess of an attractive tenement, and do. With a temper as heavenly as the color of their feathers, the bluebird's sense of justice is not always so adorable. But sparrows unnerve them into cowardice. The comparatively infrequent nesting of the bluebirds about our homes at the present time is one of the most deplorable results of unrestricted sparrow immigration. Formerly they were the commonest of bird neighbors.\\n\\nNest-building is not a favorite occupation with the bluebirds, that are conspicuously domestic none the less. Two, and even three, broods in a season fully occupy their time. As in most cases, the mother-bird does more than her share of the work. The male looks with wondering admiration at the housewifely activity, applauds her with song, feeds her as she sits brooding over the nestful of pale greenish-blue eggs, but his adoration of her virtues does not lead him into emulation.\\n\\n```\\n         \\\"Shifting his light load of song,          From post to post along the cheerless fence,\\\"\\n```\\n\\nLowell observed that he carried his duties quite as lightly.\\n\\nWhen the young birds first emerge from the shell they are almost black; they come into their splendid heritage of color by degrees, lest their young heads might be turned. It is only as they spread their tiny wings for their first flight from the nest that we can see a few blue feathers.\\n\\nWith the first cool days of autumn the bluebirds collect in flocks, often associating with orioles and kingbirds in sheltered, sunny places where insects are still plentiful. Their steady, undulating flight now becomes erratic as they take food on the wing -- a habit that they may have learned by association with the kingbirds, for they have also adopted the habit of perching upon some conspicuous lookout and then suddenly launching out into the air for a passing fly and returning to their perch. Long after their associates have gone southward, they linger like the last leaves on the tree. It is indeed \\\"good-bye to summer\\\" when the bluebirds withdraw their touch of brightness from the dreary November landscape.\\n\\nThe bluebirds from Canada and the northern portions of New England and New York migrate into Virginia and the Carolinas, the birds from the Middle States move down into the Gulf States to pass the winter. It was there that countless numbers were cut off by the severe winter of 1894-95, which was so severe in that section.\\n\\nINDIGO BUNTING (Passerina cyanea) Finch family\\n\\nCalled also: INDIGO BIRD\\n\\nLength -- 5 to 6 inches. Smaller than the English sparrow, or the   size of a canary. Male -- In certain lights rich blue, deepest on head. In another   light the blue feathers show verdigris tints. Wings, tail, and   lower back with brownish wash, most prominent in autumn   plumage. Quills of wings and tail deep blue, margined with   light. Female -- Plain sienna-brown above. Yellowish on breast and   shading to white underneath, and indistinctly streaked. Wings   and tail darkest, sometimes with slight tinge of blue in outer   webs and on shoulders. Range -- North America, from Hudson Bay to Panama. Most common in   eastern part of United States. Winters in Central America and   Mexico. Migrations -- May. September. Summer resident.\\n\\nThe \\\"glowing indigo\\\" of this tropical-looking visitor that so delighted Thoreau in the Walden woods, often seems only the more intense by comparison with the blue sky, against which it stands out in relief as the bird perches singing in a tree-top. What has this gaily dressed, dapper little cavalier in common with his dingy sparrow cousins that haunt the ground and delight in  dust-baths, leaving their feathers no whit more dingy than they were before, and in temper, as in plumage, suggesting more of earth than of heaven? Apparently he has nothing, and yet the small brown bird in the roadside thicket, which you have misnamed a sparrow, not noticing the glint of blue in her shoulders and tail, is his mate. Besides the structural resemblances, which are, of course, the only ones considered by ornithologists in classifying birds, the indigo buntings have several sparrowlike traits. They feed upon the ground, mainly upon seeds of grasses and herbs, with a few insects interspersed to give relish  to the grain; they build grassy nests in low bushes or tall, rank grass; and their flight is short and labored. Borders of woods, roadside thickets, and even garden shrubbery, with open pasture lots for foraging grounds near by, are favorite haunts of these birds, that return again and again to some preferred spot. But however close to our homes they build theirs, our presence never ceases to be regarded by them with anything but suspicion, not to say alarm. Their metallic cheep, cheep, warns you to keep away from the little blue-white eggs, hidden away securely in the bushes; and the nervous tail twitchings and jerkings are pathetic to see. Happily for the safety of their nest, the brooding mother has no tell-tale feathers to attract the eye. Dense foliage no more conceals the male bird's brilliant coat than it can the tanager's or oriole's.\\n\\nWith no attempt at concealment, which he doubtless understands would be quite impossible, he chooses some high, conspicuous perch to which he mounts by easy stages, singing as he goes; and there begins a loud and rapid strain that promises much, but growing weaker and weaker, ends as if the bird were either out of breath or too, weak to finish. Then suddenly he begins the same song over again, and keeps up this continuous performance for nearly half an hour. The noonday heat of an August day that silences nearly every other voice, seems to give to the indigo bird's only fresh animation and timbre.\\n\\nTHE BELTED KINGFISHER (Ceryle alcyon) Kingfisher family\\n\\nCalled also: THE HALCYON\\n\\nLength -- 12 to 13 inches. About one-fourth as large again as the   robin. Male -- Upper part grayish blue, with prominent crest on head   reaching to the nape. A white spot in front of the eye. Bill   longer than the head, which is large and heavy. Wings and the   short tail minutely speckled and marked with broken bands of   white. Chin, band around throat, and underneath white. Two   bluish bands across the breast and a bluish wash on sides. Female -- Female and immature specimens have rufous bands where   The adult male's are blue. Plumage of both birds oily. Range -- North America, except where the Texan kingfisher   replaces it in a limited area in the Southwest. Common from   Labrador to Florida, east and west. Winters chiefly from   Virginia southward to South America. Migrations -- March. December. Common summer resident. Usually a   winter resident also.\\n\\nIf the kingfisher is not so neighborly as we could wish, or as he used to be, it is not because he has grown less friendly, but because the streams near our homes are fished out. Fish he must and will have, and to get them nowadays it is too often necessary to follow the stream back through secluded woods to the quiet waters of its source: a clear, cool pond or lake whose scaly inmates have not yet learned wisdom at the point of the sportsman's fly.\\n\\nIn such quiet haunts the kingfisher is easily the most conspicuous object in sight, where he perches on some dead or projecting branch over the water, intently watching for a dinner that is all unsuspectingly swimming below. Suddenly the bird drops -- dives; there is a splash, a struggle, and then the \\\"lone fisherman\\\" returns triumphant to his perch, holding a shining fish in his beak. If the fish is small it is swallowed at once, but if it is large and bony it must first be killed against the branch. A few sharp knocks, and the struggles of the fish are over, but the kingfisher's have only begun. How he gags and writhes, swallows his dinner, and then, regretting his haste, brings it up again to try another wider avenue down his throat I The many abortive efforts he makes to land his dinner safely below in his stomach, his grim contortions as the fishbones scratch his throat-lining on their way down and up again, force a smile in spite of the bird's evident distress. It is small wonder he supplements his fish diet with various kinds of the larger insects, shrimps, and fresh-water mollusks.\\n\\nFlying well over the tree-tops or along the waterways. the kingfisher makes the woodland echo with his noisy rattle, that breaks the stillness like a watchman's at midnight. It is, perhaps, the most familiar sound heard along the banks of the inland rivers. No love or cradle song does he know. Instead of softening and growing sweet, as the voices of most birds do in the nesting season, the endearments uttered by a pair of mated kingfishers are the most strident, rattly shrieks ever heard by lovers it sounds as if they were perpetually quarrelling, yet they are really particularly devoted.\\n\\nThe nest of these birds, like the bank swallow's, is excavated in the face of a high bank, preferably one that rises from a stream; and at about six feet from the entrance of the tunnel six or eight clear, shining white eggs are placed on a curious nest. All the fish bones and scales that, being indigestible, are disgorged in pellets by the parents, are carefully carried to the end of the tunnel to form a prickly cradle for the unhappy fledglings. Very rarely a nest is made in the hollow trunk of a tree; but wherever the home is, the kingfishers become strongly attached to it, returning again and again to the spot that has cost them so much labor to excavate. Some observers have accused them of appropriating the holes of the water-rats.\\n\\nIn ancient times of myths and fables, kingfishers or halcyons were said to build a floating nest on the sea, and to possess some mysterious power that calmed the troubled waves while the eggs were hatching and the young birds were being reared, hence the term \\\"halcyon days,\\\" meaning days of fair weather.\\n\\nBLUE JAY (Cyanocitta cristata) Crow and Jay family\\n\\nLength -- 11 to 12 inches. A little larger than the robin.\\n\\nMale and Female -- Blue above. Black band around the neck,   joining some black feathers on the back. Under parts dusky   white. Wing coverts and tail bright blue, striped transversely   with black. Tail much rounded. Many feathers edged and tipped   with white. Head finely crested; bill, tongue, and legs black. Range -- Eastern coast of North America to the plains, and from   northern Canada to Florida and eastern Texas. Migrations -- Permanent resident. Although seen in flocks moving   southward or northward, they are merely seeking happier hunting   grounds, not migrating.\\n\\nNo bird of finer color or presence sojourns with us the year round than the blue jay. In a peculiar sense his is a case o. \\\"beauty covering a multitude of sins.\\\" Among close students of bird traits, we find none so poor as to do him reverence. Dishonest, cruel, inquisitive, murderous, voracious, villainous, are some of the epithets applied to this bird of exquisite plumage. Emerson, however, has said in his defence he does \\\"more good than harm,\\\" alluding, no doubt, to his habit of burying nuts and hard seeds in the ground, so that many a waste place is clothed with trees and shrubs, thanks to his propensity and industry.\\n\\nHe is mischievous as a small boy, destructive as a monkey, deft at hiding as a squirrel. He is unsociable and unamiable, disliking the society of other birds. His harsh screams, shrieks, and most aggressive and unmusical calls seem often intended maliciously to drown the songs of the sweet-voiced singers.\\n\\nFrom April to September, the breeding and moulting season, the blue jays are almost silent, only sallying forth from the woods to pillage and devour the young and eggs of their more peaceful neighbors. In a bulky nest, usually placed in a tree-crotch high above our heads, from four to six eggs, olive-gray with brown spots, are laid and most carefully tended.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the unlovely characteristics of the blue jay, we could ill spare the flash of color, like a bit of blue sky dropped from above, which is so rare a tint even in our land, that we number not more than three or four true blue birds, and in England, it is said, there is none.\\n\\nBLUE GROSBEAK (Guiraca carulea) Finch family\\n\\nLength -- 7 inches. About an inch larger than the English   sparrow. Male -- Deep blue, dark, and almost black on the back; wings and   tail black, slightly edged with blue, and the former marked   with bright chestnut. Cheeks and chin black. Bill heavy and   bluish. Female -- Grayish brown above, sometimes with bluish tinge on   head, lower back, and shoulders. Wings dark olive-brown, with   faint buff markings; tail same shade as wings, but witb bluish   gray markings. Underneath brownish cream-color, the breast   feathers often blue at the base. Range -- United States, from southern New England westward to the   Rocky Mountains and southward into Mexico and beyon d.M ost   common in the Southwest. Rare along the Atlantic seaboard. Migrations -- May. September. Summer resident.\\n\\nThis beautiful but rather shy and solitary bird occasionally wanders eastward to rival the bluebird and the indigo bunting in their rare and lovely coloring, and eclipse them both in song. Audubon, we remember, found the nest in New Jersey. Pennsylvania is still favored with one now and then, but it is in the Southwest only that the blue grosbeak is as common as the evening grosbeak is in the Northwest. Since rice is its favorite food, it naturally abounds where that cereal grows. Seeds and kernels of the hardest kinds, that its heavy, strong beak is well adapted to crack, constitute its diet when it strays beyond the rice-fields.\\n\\nPossibly the heavy bills of all the grosbeaks make them look stupid whether they are or not -- a characteristic that the blue grosbeak's habit of sitting motionless with a vacant stare many minutes at a time unfortunately emphasizes.\\n\\nWhen seen in the roadside thickets or tall weeds, such as the field sparrow chooses to frequent, it shows little fear of man unless actually approached and threatened, but whether this fearlessness comes from actual confidence or stupidity is by no means certain. Whatever the motive of its inactivity, it accomplishes an end to be desired by the cleverest bird; its presence is almost never suspected by the passer-by, and its grassy nest on a tree-branch, containing three or four pale bluish-white eggs, is never betrayed by look or sign to the marauding small boy.\\n\\nBARN SWALLOW (Chelidon erythrogaster) Swallow family\\n\\nLength -- 6.5 to 7 inches. A trifle larger than the English   sparrow. Apparently considerably larger, because of its wide   wingspread. Male -- Glistening steel-blue shading to black above. Chin,   breast, and underneath bright chestnut-brown and brilliant buff   that glistens in the sunlight. A partial collar of steel-blue.   Tail very deeply forked and slender. Female -- Smaller and paler, with shorter outer tail feathers,   making the fork less prominent. Range -- Throughout North America. Winters in tropics of both   Americas. Migrations -- April. September. Summer resident.\\n\\nAny one who attempts to describe the coloring of a bird's plumage knows how inadequate words are to convey a just idea of the delicacy, richness, and brilliancy of the living tints. But, happily, the beautiful barn swallow is too familiar to need description. Wheeling about our barns and houses, skimming over the fields, its bright sides flashing in the sunlight, playing \\\"cross tag\\\" with its friends at evening, when the insects, too, are on the wing, gyrating, darting, and gliding through the air, it is no more possible to adequately describe the exquisite grace of a swallow's flight than the glistening buff of its breast.\\n\\nThis is a typical bird of the air, as an oriole is of the trees and a sparrow of the ground. Though the swallow may often be seen perching on a telegraph wire, suddenly it darts off as if it had received a shock of electricity, and we see the bird in its true element.\\n\\nWhile this swallow is peculiarly American, it is often confounded with its European cousin Hirundo rustica in noted ornithologies.\\n\\nUp in the rafters of the barn, or in the arch of an old bridge that spans a stream, these swallows build their bracket-like nests of clay or mud pellets intermixed with straw. Here the noisy little broods pick their way out of the white eggs curiously spotted with brown and lilac that were all too familiar in the marauding days of our childhood.\\n\\nCLIFF SWALLOW (Petrochelidon lunifrons) Swallow family\\n\\nCalled also: EAVE SWALLOW; CRESCENT SWALLOW; ROCKY MOUNTAIN   SWALLOW\\n\\nLength -- 6 inches. A trifle smaller than the English sparrow.   Apparently considerably larger because of its wide wingspread. Male and Female -- Steel-blue above, shading to blue-black on   crown of head and on wings and tail. A brownish-gray ring   around the neck. Beneath dusty white, with rufous tint.   Crescent-like frontlet. Chin, throat, sides of head, and tail   coverts rufous. Range -- North and South America. Winters in the tropics. Migrations -- Early April. Late September. Summer resident.\\n\\nNot quite so brilliantly colored as the barn swallow, nor with tail so deeply forked, and consequently without so much  grace in flying, and with a squeak rather than the really musical twitter of the gayer bird, the cliff swallow may be positively identified by the rufous feathers of its tail coverts, but more definitely by its crescent-shaped frontlet shining like a new moon; hence its specific Latin name from luna = moon, and frons = front.\\n\\nSuch great numbers of these swallows have been seen in the far West that the name of Rocky Mountain swallows is sometimes given to them; though however rare they may have been in 1824, when DeWitt Clinton thought he \\\"discovered\\\" them near Lake Champlain, they are now common enough in all parts of the United States.\\n\\nIn the West this swallow is wholly a cliff-dweller, but it has learned to modify its home in different localities. As usually seen, it is gourd-shaped, opened at the top, built entirely of mud pellets (\\\"bricks without straw\\\"), softly lined with feathers and wisps of grass, and attached by the larger part to a projecting cliff or eave.\\n\\nLike all the swallows, this bird lives in colonies, and the clay-colored nests beneath the eaves of barns are often so close together that a group of them resembles nothing so much as a gigantic wasp's nest. It is said that when swallows pair they are mated for life; but, then, more is said about swallows than the most tireless bird-lover could substantiate. The tradition that swallows fly low when it is going to rain may be easily credited, because the air before a storm is usually too heavy with moisture for the winged insects, upon which the swallows feed, to fly high.\\n\\nMOURNING DOVE (Zenaidura macroura) Pigeon family\\n\\nCalled also: CAROLINA DOVE; TURTLE DOVE\\n\\nLength -- 12 to 13 inches. About one-half as large again as the   robin. Male -- Grayish brown or fawn-color above, varying to bluish   gray. Crown and upper part of head greenish blue, with green   and golden metallic reflections on sides of neck. A black spot   under each ear. Forehead and breast reddish buff; lighter   underneath. (General impression of color, bluish fawn.) Bill   black, with tumid, fleshy covering; feet red; two middle tail   feathers longest; all others banded with black and tipped with   ashy white. Wing coverts sparsely spotted with black. Flanks   and underneath the wings bluish. Female -- Duller and without iridescent reflections on neck. Range -- North America, from Quebec to Panama, and westward to   Arizona. Most common in temperate climate, east of Rocky   Mountains. Migrations -- March. November. Common summer resident not   Migratory south of Virginia.\",\"timestamp\":1641275056,\"title\":\"About an inch and a half shorter   than the English sparrow.\"},\"digest\":\"1F84J5tVKand1nAyNQJDyYP-kHbkAIvqSYT7Tex76YY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x1928Fa8c1480697A043aA639A3c2C52BE5B7890a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Xgq6-gx9NIcox83QYfiqU4Xi3dIkkQ7FGBBUrAvgKGE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xshVCfMXT13Zr2pwXrrQ8no3iM8MA9Cx7Q0wOF4oiH4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"WbeKMEuUjgZyDZHuK9QgvI4xoZSDwoNcf6XNpMtrBBOoBrLl_kU9l0xy7wc3iGEoATWr5KuAiWw46Zu7NGmX-Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc2915f508c470a2722a4ce73fed65c9347ae24c5a106468b1af15839395171e91d9ca4c2d65449597024ea314327baa430722944031d3ce541f337f3160405471c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Xgq6-gx9NIcox83QYfiqU4Xi3dIkkQ7FGBBUrAvgKGE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xshVCfMXT13Zr2pwXrrQ8no3iM8MA9Cx7Q0wOF4oiH4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"1F84J5tVKand1nAyNQJDyYP-kHbkAIvqSYT7Tex76YY\"}"
