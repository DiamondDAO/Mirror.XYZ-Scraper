"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The laughableness of the thing--this ferocious atomy defying him--struck home to the little man. Delighted at such a display of vice in so tender a plant, he fell to chuckling.\\n\\n\\\"Ye leetle devil!\\\" he laughed. \\\"He! he! ye leetle devil!\\\" and flipped together finger and thumb in vain endeavor to coax the puppy to him.\\n\\nBut it growled, and glared more terribly.\\n\\n\\\"Stop it, ye little snake, or I'll flatten you!\\\" cried the big drover, and shuffled his feet threateningly. Whereat the puppy, gurgling like hot water in a kettle, made a feint as though to advance and wipe them out, these two bad men.\\n\\nM'Adam laughed again, and smote his leg.\\n\\n\\\"Keep a ceevil tongue and yer distance,\\\" says he, \\\"or I'll e'en ha' to mak' ye. Though he is but as big as a man's thumb, a dog's a dog for a' that--he! he! the leetle devil.\\\" And he fell to flipping finger and thumb afresh.\\n\\n\\\"Ye're maybe wantin' a dog?\\\" inquired the stranger. \\\"Yer friend said as much.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ma friend lied; it's his way,\\\" M'Adam replied.\\n\\n\\\"I'm willin' to part wi' him,\\\" the other pursued.\\n\\nThe little man yawned. \\\"Weel, I'll tak' him to oblige ye,\\\" he said indifferently.\\n\\nThe drover rose to his feet.\\n\\n\\\"It's givin' 'im ye, fair givin' im ye, mind! But I'll do it!\\\"--he smacked a great fist into a hollow palm. \\\"Ye may have the dog for a pun'--I'll only ask you a pun',\\\" and he walked away to the window.\\n\\nM'Adam drew back, the better to scan his would-be benefactor; his lower jaw dropped, and he eyed the stranger with a drolly sarcastic air.\\n\\n\\\"A poun', man! A pouxi'--for yon noble dorg!\\\" he pointed a crooked forefinger at the little creature, whose scowling mask peered from beneath the chair. \\\"Man, I couldna do it. Na, na; ma conscience wadna permit me.\\n\\n'Twad be fair robbin' ye. Ah, ye Englishmen!\\\" he spoke half to himself, and sadly, as if deploring the unhappy accident of his nationality; \\\"it's yer grand, open-hairted generosity that grips a puir Scotsman by the throat. A poun'! and for yon!\\\" He wagged his head mournfully, cocking it sideways the better to scan his subject.\\n\\n\\\"Take him or leave him,\\\" ordered the drover truculently, still gazing out of the window.\\n\\n\\\"Wi' yer permission I'll leave him,\\\" M'Adam answered meeldy.\\n\\n\\\"I'm short o' the ready,\\\" the big man pursued, \\\"or I wouldna part with him. Could I bide me time there's many'd be glad to give me a tenner for one o' that bree--\\\" he caught himself up hastily--\\\" for a dog sic as that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And yet ye offer him me for a poun'! Noble indeed!\\\"\\n\\nNevertheless the little man had pricked his ears at the other's slip and quick correction. Again he approached the puppy, dangling his coat before him to protect his ankles; and again that wee wild beast sprang out, seized the coat in its small jaw, and worried it savagely.\\n\\nM'Adam stooped quickly and picked up his tiny assailant; and the puppy, suspended by its neck, gurgled and slobbered; then, wriggling desperately round, made its teeth meet in its adversary's shirt. At which M'Adam shook it gently and laughed. Then he set to examining it.\\n\\nApparently some six weeks old; a tawny coat, fiery eyes, a square head with small, cropped ears, and a comparatively immense jaw; the whole giving promise of great strength, if little beauty. And this effect was enhanced by the manner of its docking. For the miserable relic of a tail, yet raw, looked little more than a red button adhering to its wearer's stern.\\n\\nM'Adam's inspection was as minute as it was apparently absorbing; he omitted nothing from the square muzzle to the lozenge-like scut. And every now and then he threw a quick glance at the man at the window, who was watching the careful scrutiny a thought uneasily.\\n\\n\\\"Ye've cut him short,\\\" he said at length, swinging round on the drover.\\n\\n\\\"Ay; strengthens their backs,\\\" the big man answered with averted gaze.\\n\\nM'Adam's chin went up in the air; his. mouth partly opened and his eyelids partly closed as he eyed his informant.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, ay,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Gie him back to me,\\\" ordered the drover surlily. He took the puppy and set it on the floor; whereupon it immediately resumed its former fortified position. \\\"Ye're no buyer; I knoo that all along by that face on ye,\\\" he said in insulting tones.\\n\\n\\\"Ye wad ha' bought him yerseif', nae doot?\\\" M'Adam inquired blandly.\\n\\n\\\"In course; if you says so.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Or airblins ye bred him?\\\"\\n\\n'Appen I did.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ye'll no be from these parts?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Will I no?\\\" answered the other.\\n\\nA smile of genuine pleasure stole over M'Adam's face. He laid his hand on the other's arm.\\n\\n\\\"Man,\\\" he said gently, \\\"ye mind me o' hame.\\\" Then almost in the same breath:\\n\\nYe said ye found him?\\\"\\n\\nIt was the stranger's turn to laugh.\\n\\n\\\"Ha! ha! Ye teecide me, little mon. Found 'im? Nay; I was give 'im by a friend. But there's nowt amiss wi' his breedin', ye may believe me.\\\"\\n\\nThe great fellow advanced to the chair under which the puppy lay. It leapt out like a lion, and fastened on his huge boot.\\n\\n\\\"A rare bred un, look 'ee! a rare game wi. Ma word, he's a big-hearted un! Look at the back on him; see the jaws to him; mark the pluck of him!\\\" He shook his booted foot fiercely, tossing his leg to and fro like a tree in a wind. But the little creature, now raised ceilingward, now dashed to the ground, held on with incomparable doggedness, till its small jaw was all bloody and muzzle wrinkled with the effort.\\n\\n\\\"Ay, ay, that'll do,\\\" M'Adam interposed, irritably.\\n\\nThe drover ceased his efforts.\\n\\n\\\"Now, I'll mak' ye a last offer.\\\" He thrust his head down to a level with the other's, shooting out his neck. \\\"It's throwin' him at ye, mind. 'Tain't buyin' him ye'll be-- don't go for to deceive yourself. Ye may have him for fifteen shillin'. Why do I do it, ye ask? Why, 'cos I think ye'll be kind to him,\\\" as the puppy retreated to its chair, leaving a spotted track of red along its route.\\n\\n\\\"Ay, ye wadna be happy gin ye thocht he'd no a comfortable hame, conseederate man?\\\" M'Adam answered, eyeing the dark track on the floor. Then he put on his coat.\\n\\n\\\"Na, na, he's no for me. Weel, I'll no detain ye. Good-nicht to ye, mister!\\\" and he made for the door.\\n\\n\\\"A gran' worker he'll be,\\\" called the drover after him.\\n\\n\\\"Ay; muckle wark he'll mak' amang the sheep wi' sic a jaw and sic a temper. Weel, I maun be steppin'. Good-nicht to ye.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ye'll niver have sich anither chanst.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nor niver wush to. Na, na; he'll never mak' a sheep-dog\\\"; and the little man turned up the collar of his coat.\\n\\n\\\"Will he not?\\\" cried the other scornfully. \\\"There niver yet was one o' that line \\\"he stopped abruptly.\\n\\nThe little man spun round.\\n\\n\\\"Iss?\\\" he said, as innocent as any child; \\\"ye were sayin'?\\\"\\n\\nThe other turned to the window and watched the rain falling monotonously.\\n\\n\\\"Ye'll be wantin' wet,\\\" he said adroitly.\\n\\n\\\"Ay, we could do wi' a drappin'. And he'll never mak' a sheep-dog.\\\" He shoved his cap down on his head. \\\"Weel, good-nicht to ye!\\\" and he stepped out into the rain.\\n\\nIt was long after dark when the bargain was finally struck.\\n\\nAdam M'Adam's Red Wull became that little man's property for the following realizable assets: ninepence in cash--three coppers and a doubtful sixpence; a plug of suspicious tobacco in a well-worn pouch; and an old watch.\\n\\n\\\"It's clean givin' 'im ye,\\\" said the stranger bitterly, at the end of the deal.\\n\\n\\\"It's mair the charity than aught else mak's me sae leeberal,\\\" the other answered gently. \\\"I wad not like to see ye pinched.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thank ye kindly,\\\" the big man replied with some acerbity, and plunged out into the darkness and rain. Nor was that long-limbed drover-man ever again seen in the countryside. And the puppy's previous history--. whether he was honestly come by or no, whether he was, indeed, of the famous Red McCulloch\\\\* strain, ever remained a mystery in the Daleland.\\n\\n\\\\*N. B--You may know a Red McCulloeh anywhere by the ring of white upon his tail some two inches from the root.\\n\\nChapter IV.  FIRST BLOOD\\n\\nAFTER that first encounter in the Dales-. man's Daughter, Red Wull, for so M'Adam called him, resigned himself complacently to his lot; recognizing, perhaps, his destiny.\\n\\nThenceforward the sour little man and the vicious puppy grew, as it were, together. The two were never apart. Where M'Adam was, there was sure to be his tiny attendant, bristling defiance as he kept ludicrous guard over his master.\\n\\nThe little man and his dog were inseparable. M'Adam never left him even at the Grange.\\n\\n\\\"I couldna trust ma Wullie at hame alone wi' the dear lad,\\\" was his explanation. \\\"I ken wed I'd come back to find a wee corpse on the floor, and David singin':\\n\\n'My heart is sair, I daur na tell,\\n\\nMy heart is sair for somebody.'\\n\\nAy, and he'd be sair elsewhere by the time I'd done wi' him--he! he!\\\"\\n\\nThe sneer at David's expense was as characteristic as it was unjust. For though the puppy and the boy were already sworn enemies, yet the lad would have scorned to harm so small a foe. And many a tale did David tell at Kenmuir of Red Wull's viciousness, of his hatred of him (David), and his devotion to his master; how, whether immersed in the pig-bucket or chasing the fleeting rabbit, he would desist at once, and bundle, panting, up at his master's call; how he routed the tomcat and drove him from the kitchen; and how he clambered on to David's bed and pinned him murderously by the nose.\\n\\nOf late the relations between M'Adam and James Moore had been unusually strained. Though they were neighbors, communications between the two were of the rarest; and it was for the first time for many a long day that, on an afternoon shortly after Red Wull had come into his possession, M'Adam entered the yard of Kenmuir, bent on girding at the master for an alleged trespass at the Stony Bottom.\\n\\n\\\"WI' yer permission, Mr. Moore,'' said the little man, \\\"I'll wheestle ma dog, \\\" and, turning, he whistled a shrill, peculiar note like the cry of a disturbed peewit.\\n\\nStraightway there came scurrying desperately up, ears back, head down, tongue out, as if the world depended on his speed, a little tawny beetle of a thing, who placed his forepaws against his master's ankles and looked up into his face; then, catching sight of the strangers, hurriedly he took up his position between them and M'Adam, assuming his natural attitude of grisly defiance. Such a laughable spectacle he made, that martial mite, standing at bay with bristles up and teeth bared, that even James Moore smiled.\\n\\n\\\"Ma word! Ha' yo' brought his muzzle, man?\\\" cried old Tammas, the humorist; and, turning, climbed all in a heat on to an upturned bucket that stood by. Whereat the puppy, emboldened by his foe's retreat, advanced savagely to the attack, buzzing round the slippery pail like a wasp on a windowpane, in vain attempt to reach the old man.\\n\\nTammas stood on the top, hitching his trousers and looking down on his assailant, the picture of mortal fear.\\n\\n'Elp! Oh, 'elp!\\\" he bawled. \\\"Send for the sogers! fetch the p'lice! For lawk-amussy's sake call him off, man!\\\" Even Sam'l Todd, watching the scene from the cart-shed, was tickled and burst into a loud guffaw, heartily backed by 'Enry and oor Job. While M'Adam remarked: \\\"Ye're fitter for a stage than a stable-bucket, Mr. Thornton.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How didst coom by him?\\\" asked Tammas, nodding at the puppy.\\n\\n\\\"Found him,\\\" the little man replied, sucking his twig. \\\"Found him in ma stockin' on ma birthday. A present from ma leetle David for his auld dad, I doot.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So do I,\\\" said Tammas, and was seized with sudden spasm of seemingly causeless merriment. For looking up as M'Adam was speaking, he had caught a glimpse of a boy's fair head, peering cautiously round the cow-shed, and, behind, the flutter of short petti.. coats. They disappeared as silently as they had come; and two small figures, just returned from school, glided away and sought shelter in the friendly darkness of a coal-hole.\\n\\n\\\"Coom awa', Maggie, coom awa'! 'Tis th' owd un, 'isself,\\\" whispered a disrespectful voice.\\n\\nM'Adam looked round suspiciously.\\n\\n\\\"What's that?\\\" he asked sharply.\\n\\nAt the moment, however, Mrs. Moore put her head out of the kitchen window.\\n\\n\\\"Coom thy ways in, Mister M'Adam, and tak' a soop o' tea,\\\" she called hospitably.\\n\\n\\\"Thank ye kindly, Mrs. Moore, I will,\\\" he answered, politely for him. And this one good thing must be allowed of Adam M'Adam:\\n\\nthat, if there was only one woman of whom he was ever known to speak well, there was also only one, in the whole course of his life, against whom he ever insinuated evil--and that was years afterward, when men said his brain was sapped. Flouts and jeers he had for every man, but a woman, good or bad, was sacred to him. For the sex that had given him his mother and his wife he had that sentiment of tender reverence which, if a man still preserve, he cannot be altogether bad. As he turned into the house he looked back at Red Wull.\\n\\n\\\"Ay, we may leave him,\\\" he said. \\\"That is, gin ye're no afraid, Mr. Thornton?\\\"\\n\\nOf what happened while the men were within doors, it is enough to tell two things. First, that Owd Bob was no bully. Second, this: In the code of sheep-dog honor there is written a word in stark black letters; and opposite it another word, writ large in the color of blood. The first is \\\"Sheep-murder\\\"; the second, \\\"Death.\\\" It is the one crime only to be wiped away in blood; and to accuse of the crime is to offer the one unpardonable insult. Every sheep-dog knows it, and every shepherd.\\n\\nThat afternoon, as the men still talked, the quiet echoes of the farm rung with a furious animal cry, twice repeated: \\\"Shot for sheepmurder\\\"--\\\" Shot for sheep-murder\\\"; followed by a hollow stillness.\\n\\nThe two men finished their colloquy. The matter was concluded peacefully, mainly owing to the pacifying influence of Mrs. Moore. Together the three went out into the yard; Mrs. Moore seizing the opportunity to shyly speak on David's behalf.\\n\\n\\\"lie's such a good little lad, I do think,\\\" she was saying.\\n\\n\\\"Ye should ken, Mrs. Moore,\\\" the little man answered, a thought bitterly; \\\"ye see enough of him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yo' mun be main proud of un, mester,\\\" the woman continued, heedless of the sneer: \\\"an' 'im growin' such a gradely lad.\\\"\\n\\nM'Adam shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n\\\"I barely ken the lad,\\\" he said. \\\"By sight I know him, of course, but barely to speak to. He's but seldom at hame.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"An' hoo proud his mother'd be if she could see him,\\\" the woman continued, well aware of his one tender place. \\\"Eh, but she was fond o' him, so she was.\\\"\\n\\nAn angry flush stole over the little man's face. Well he understood the implied rebuke; and it hurt him like a knife.\\n\\n\\\"Ay, ay, Mrs. Moore,\\\" he began. Then breaking off, and looking about him-- \\\"Where's ma Wullie?\\\" he cried excitedly. \\\"James Moore!\\\" whipping round on the Master, \\\"ma Wullie's gone--gone, I say!\\\"\\n\\nElizabeth Moore turned away indignantly. \\\"I do declar' he tak's more fash after yon little yaller beastie than iver he does after his own flesh,\\\" she muttered.\\n\\n\\\"Wullie, ma we doggie! Wullie, where are ye? James Moore, he's gone--ma Wullie's gone!\\\" cried the little man, running about the yard, searching everywhere.\\n\\n\\\"Cannot 'a' gotten far,\\\" said the Master, reassuringly, looking about him.\\n\\n\\\"Niver no tellin',\\\" said Sam'l, appearing on the scene, pig-bucket in hand. \\\"I inisdoot yo'll iver see your dog agin, mister.\\\" He turned sorrowfully to M'Adam.\\n\\nThat little man, all dishevelled, and with the perspiration standing on his face, came hurrying out of the cow-shed and danced up to the Master.\\n\\n\\\"It's robbed I am--robbed, I tell ye!\\\" he cried recklessly. \\\"Ma wee Wull's bin stolen while I was ben your hoose, James Moore!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yo' munna say that, ma mon. No robbin' at Kenmuir,\\\" the Master answered sternly.\\n\\n\\\"Then where is he? It's for you to say.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've ma own idee, I 'aye,\\\" Sam'l announced opportunely, pig-bucket uplifted.\\n\\nM'Adam turned on him.\\n\\n\\\"What, man? What is it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I misdoot yo'll iver see your dog agin, mister,\\\" Sam'l repeated, as if he was supplying the key to the mystery.\\n\\n\\\"Noo, Sam'l, if yo' know owt tell it, \\\"ordered his master.\\n\\nSam'l grunted sulkily.\\n\\n\\\"Wheer's oor Bob, then?\\\" he asked.\\n\\nAt that M'Adam turned on the Master.\\n\\n'Tis that, nae doot. It's yer gray dog, James Moore, yer--dog. I might ha' kent it, \\\"--and he loosed off a volley of foul words.\\n\\n\\\"Sweerin' will no find him,\\\" said the Master coldly. \\\"Noo, Sam'l.\\\"\\n\\nThe big man shifted his feet, and looked mournfully at M'Adam.\\n\\n'Twas 'appen 'aif an hour agone, when I sees oor Bob goin' oot o' yard wi' little yaller tyke in his mouth. In a minnit I looks agin-- and theer! little yaller 'Un was gone, and oor Bob a-sittin' a-lickin' his chops. Gone for-iver, I do reck'n. Ah, yo' may well take on, Tammas Thornton!\\\" For the old man was rolling about the yard, bent double with merriment.\\n\\nM'Adam turned on the Master with the resignation of despair.\\n\\n\\\"Man, Moore,\\\" he cried piteously, \\\"it's yer gray dog has murdered ma wee Wull! Ye have it from yer am man.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nonsense,\\\" said the Master encouragingly. \\\" 'Tis but yon girt oof.\\\"\\n\\nSam'l tossed his head and snorted.\\n\\n\\\"Coom, then, and i'll show yo',\\\" he said, and led the way out of the yard. And there below them on the slope to the stream, sitting like Justice at the Courts of Law, was Owd Bob.\\n\\nStraightway Sam'l whose humor was something of the calibre of old Ross's, the sexton, burst into horse-merriment. \\\"Why's he sit-tin' so still, think 'ee? Ho! Ho! See un lickin' his chops--ha! ha! \\\"--and he roared afresh. While from afar you could hear the distant rumbling of 'Enry and oor Job.\\n\\nAt the sight, M'Adam burst into a storm of passionate invective, and would have rushed on the dog had not James Moore forcibly restrained him.\\n\\n\\\"Bob, lad,\\\" called the Master, \\\"coom here!\\\" But even as he spoke, the gray dog cocked his ears, listened a moment, and then shot down the slope. At the same moment Tammas hallooed: \\\"Theer he be! yon's yaller un coomin' oot o' drain! La, Sam'l!\\\" And there, indeed, on the slope below them, a little angry, smutty-faced figure was crawling out of a rabbit-burrow.\\n\\n\\\"Ye murderin' devil, wad ye duar touch ma Wullie?\\\" yelled M'Adam, and, breaking away, pursued hotly down the hill; for the gray dog had picked up the puppy, like a lancer a tent-peg, and was sweeping on, his captive in his mouth, toward the stream.\\n\\nBehind, hurried James Moore and Sam'l, wondering what the issue of the comedy would be. After them toddled old Tammas, chuckling. While over the yard-wall was now a little cluster of heads: 'Enry, oor Job, Maggie and David, and Vi'let Thornton, the dairy-maid.\\n\\nStraight on to the plank-bridge galloped Owd Bob. In the middle he halted, leant over, and dropped his prisoner; who fell with a cool plop into the running water beneath.\\n\\nAnother moment and M'Adam had reached the bank of the stream. In he plunged, splashing and cursing, and seized the struggling puppy; then waded back, the waters surging about his waist, and Red Wull, limp as a wet rag, in his hand. The little man's hair was dripping, for his cap was gone; his clothes clung to him, exposing the miserableness of his figure; and his eyes blazed like hot ashes in his wet face.\\n\\nHe sprang on to the bank, and, beside himself with passion, rushed at Owd Bob.\\n\\n\\\"Curse ye for a--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Stan' back, or yo'll have him at your throat!\\\" shouted the Master, thundering up. \\\"Stan' back, I say, yo' fule!\\\" And, as the little man still came madly on, he reached forth his hand and hurled him back; at the same moment, bending, he buried the other hand deep in Owd Bob's shaggy neck. It was but just in time; for if ever the fierce desire of battle gleamed in gray eyes, it did in the young dog's as M'Adam came down on him.\\n\\nThe little man staggered, tottered, and fell heavily. At the shock, the blood gushed from his nose, and, mixing with the water on his face, ran down in vague red streams, dripping off his chin; while Red Wull, jerked from his grasp, was thrown afar, and lay motionless.\\n\\n\\\"Curse ye!\\\" M'Adam screamed, his face dead-white save for the running red about his jaw. \\\"Curse ye for a cowardly Englishman!\\\" and, struggling to his feet, he made at the Master.\\n\\nBut Sam'l interposed his great bulk between the two.\\n\\n\\\"Easy, little mon,\\\" he said leisurely, regarding the small fury before him with mournful interest. \\\"Eli, but thee do be a little spit-cat, surely!\\\"\\n\\nJames Moore stood, breathing deep, his hand still buried in Owd Bob's coat.\\n\\n\\\"If yo'd touched him,\\\" he explained, \\\"I conidna ha' stopped him. He'd ha' mauled yo' afore iver I could ha' had him off. They're bad to hold, the Gray Dogs, when they're roosed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ay, ma word, that they are!\\\" corroborated Tammas, speaking from the experience of sixty years. \\\"Once on, yo' canna get 'em off.\\\"\\n\\nThe little man turned away.\\n\\n\\\"Ye're all agin me,\\\" he said, and his voice shook. A pitiful figure he made, standing there with the water dripping from him. A red stream was running slowly from his chin; his head was bare, and face working.\\n\\nJames Moore stood eyeing him with some pity and some contempt. Behind was Tammas, enjoying the scene. While Sam'l regarded them all with an impassive melancholy.\\n\\nM'Adam turned and bent over Red Wull, who still lay like a dead thing. As his master handled him, the button-tail quivered feebly; he opened his eyes, looked about him, snarled faintly, and glared with devilish hate at the gray dog and the group with him.\\n\\nThe little man picked him up, stroking him tenderly. Then he turned away and on to the bridge. Half-way across he stopped. It rattled feverishly beneath him, for he still trembled like a palsied man.\\n\\n\\\"Man, Moore!\\\" he called, striving to quell the agitation in his voice--\\\" I wad shoot yon dog.\\\"\\n\\nAcross the bridge he turned again. \\\"Man, Moore!\\\" he called and paused. Ye'll not forget this day.\\\" And with that the blood flared up a dull crimson into his white face.\\n\\nPART II  THE LITTLE MAN\\n\\nChapter V.  A MAN'S SON\\n\\nTHE storm, long threatened, having once burst, M'Adam allowed loose rein to his bitter animosity against James Moore.\\n\\nThe two often met. For the little man frequently returned home from the village by the footpath across Kenmuir. It was out of his way, but he preferred it in order to annoy his enemy and keep a watch upon his doings.\",\"timestamp\":1641283151,\"title\":\"\\nA sense of humor is many a man's salvation, and was M'Adam's one redeeming feature\"},\"digest\":\"iPCPNPtrqPHq_1WIaHwTPNSSNOqfqwmks8kpj0N_ei4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x93be0c9BA98F727B6919FE7c4E542c3bD617d31D\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"62HcMya--YU8wYmi6i20WvsPb1DplLR5_OpslJF5Dqk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"J2_a5dE7G7A6MtZbnlYQzyA8-Q77zyDPoh7sFyFeJx0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"wLNwAKjdjZx3KkIWGGfdC44wBGVot1N215nmyRQwZSTTtv8PdPOwTBQ1t8V_SRmt0nqwJC3r3qqsH3Dl78-mVg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa6e5d52838b0f9dbbc449be39a221f3adbfec0dba0a7f79c67efbbb4b227bf835c824210dbf65cf22527bcf71ea93a732df2fa2c9e8588ad55c9fcb3aab318841b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"62HcMya--YU8wYmi6i20WvsPb1DplLR5_OpslJF5Dqk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"J2_a5dE7G7A6MtZbnlYQzyA8-Q77zyDPoh7sFyFeJx0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"iPCPNPtrqPHq_1WIaHwTPNSSNOqfqwmks8kpj0N_ei4\"}"
