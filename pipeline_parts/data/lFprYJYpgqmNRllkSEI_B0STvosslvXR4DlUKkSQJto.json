"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Looking back, It has been around 7 months since I happened to know slingshot first time from a friend. I was searching for some dexes on polygon that can monitor realtime price movement and support as many tokens as possible. At that time, the dex market was not that of many choices, not to mention a simple but handy enough tool. Then, slingshot gave me the answer: yeah, that’s the one.\\n\\nIf I had to sum up my first impression of slingshot in one word, I’d say: “**smooth**.”\\n\\nTrying dexguru, dextools…during times, I chose slingshot finally cuz some of its amazing features caught me inside:\\n\\n1\\\\. **Positive slippage giveaway**. Price fluctuation happens every second. While most time we have to accept a not-so-good price the moment we placed the order. The more frequent we trade, more friction cost we are likely to bear. Unlike many other exchanges, slingshot does give the positive slippage (additional profit from the trade due to price fluctuations) back to users. This is very definitely a tempting feature for frequent traders.\\n\\n![positive slippage kept for users](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_QVe0SZ3fUfjmRBfV7k25.png?height=131&width=1291)\\n\\n2\\\\. **Clean and efficient design language**. It may seems a bit old school, at slingshot, all is about charts, figures and latest market data, there’re no rich colors, animation effects… But that's exactly what I think makes slingshot a professional exchange, so the trader can concentrate on their trading simply. It’s a hard fact that not all of projects could be aware of what a target user really wants, and as a person who lives to the principle of high efficiency, the “flat“ design hits my spots: Less is more.\\n\\n![professional charts, contract address, realtime trades...a full range of fundamental but essential elements](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WiRtx85Z6j6uP3OZwb7yU.png?height=601&width=1747)\\n\\n3\\\\. **Global Chat.** Honestly speaking, I didn’t pay attention to that feature at first when most time I focused on trading. While later, I realized the genius part of it. Firstly, it was put in a place safe enough to ensure it won’t influence the main trading function. Secondly, with such a bulit-in dialogue box feature, one literally don’t have to switch out to ~~newspaper~~ twitter to see the public opinions about the market, which improves the user stickiness.Thirdly, it increases user engagement. People may be interested in chatting with peers around the world, one of them may be an experienced trader, one may be a great tutor…this little dialogue box serves as a nexus and make deeper connection possible. Of course, with the full shape of the chat function comes to live, more to anticipate, like instant feedback and f/u when one encounters a technique bug or requests a new feature, he can directly leave a message in a specified tab of the chat box.\\n\\n(Currently, there’re not so many active users and I’m expecting the chat will become something greater someday, and thanks to mod who would mobilize the atmosphere )\\n\\n![Real-time global communication](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f58baqlI_c3VCCW4sdHHf.png?height=253&width=377)\\n\\n4\\\\. **Small but thoughtful features**. Slingshot considers much in users’ position. Below are some of the details that surprised me.\\n\\n* **APE Mode**. Slingshot puts the safety of users' assets in a high priority. Actually, the default mode users are trading on is limited to a certain range of tokens, which to some extent protects users from being exposed to fraud and high risk of losses. In the meantime, slingshot also offers an APE mode for advanced users which supports a wider range of tokens.\\n* **Foldable Modules**, an inconspicuous but intimate consideration. Even the elements on slingshot are compact, it still offers to the users the choice of folding any modules they don’t want to see. Through clicking on the banner of each module: Position, Order History, Global Chat… everyone can have a personalized trading interface.\\n* **Downloadable Order History**. It’s a feature that can be easily overlooked but very practical, solving the pain points of a large number of dedicated traders. In the Order History panel, one can view his most recent trades, but there will always be times when one wants to look at trades over a certain period of time, inspect them, and review past trading strategies. I need to say, it’s quite satisfactory when I found that slingshot gave me the option to download trading data in an organized form.\\n\\n![slingshot order history downloaded from the system](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-_sH14q9b-tczfwm4P5AZ.png?height=208&width=642)\\n\\n## Tips on slingshot in its journey to a better dex\\n\\nAs a long-time user, Inevitably, I have some nagging for the product along with my expectation that slingshot could consider some of them when doing scaling.\\n\\n1\\\\. Error alert for some of the unpopular trading pairs, like blok-gohm. It seems I have to divide such trade in 2 steps: unpopular token-popular token-unpopular token. I don’t know if it’s because of lack of liquidity. I hope with the increase in supported tokens, the depth of unpopular trading pairs will also be optimized.\\n\\n![Error occurred for unpopular pairs](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sIzHyzpnkQvfwX9ljLMi6.png?height=599&width=342)\\n\\n2\\\\. Users have to sign in twice in the wallet in order to use the global chat feature. Global chat is a fantastic built-in function, so in order to encourage users to try this cool stuff, from UE perspective, it’s suggested that users could input their messages with just a single click, signing wallet twice can be a small obstacle preventing users to have a try.\\n\\n![Users are required another sign in to chat](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cphz_282VMqTDFsDQ0iYs.png?height=300&width=379)\\n\\n3\\\\. Adding some ingredients to the order history panel. The bottom panel (aka order history) shows our past and current transactions in progress. I think it could afford more functional features like adding simple statistics(eg. sum) and sorting (one can view a trade per its size or time). Plus, it would be nicer when one encounter slow txs, the ”speed up“ button would directly navigate the users to a pop-up wallet window indicating adding gas fee.\\n\\n![could be better if \\\"speed up\\\" directly leads users to the wallet](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FUeIssij8g35MiLTwe0HJ.png?height=122&width=1743)\\n\\n4\\\\. The inconsistency between transaction completion status and blockchain records. It seldom happens, like 1 in 15. While the status told me the order failed, it was actually successful according to the blockchain exploerer. Just don't understand what's happening, maybe it's a display issue? Mark a note here.\\n\\n![Order Failed within the app interface](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oTfvztHF09auLAjQUV-BA.png?height=455&width=416)\\n\\n![Success status in the Explorer](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EaRYEub8PvVSCx-4CngJ8.png?height=178&width=1400)\\n\\n5\\\\. The estimation of execution speed. It feels so convenient that slingshot has pre-set different gas levels that saves users’ efforts for extra clicks. Compared with other dexes, the gas level on slingshot is more differentiated which satisfies the appetites of different types of users. Just to mention one point here, since it fluctuates accordingly with the market stituation, sometimes especially under a highly volatile circumstance, I observed a major deviation from the statistics in Chain Explorer. It may lead to unnecessary extra cost if we follow the pre-set parameters in the app, so it’s also something I think that can be tuned.\\n\\n![Deviation of gas data between app and explorer](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lbEAZl8aU-JKYTU6VZu4G.png?height=174&width=1175)\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nThis is all I got from slingshot so far. Many wonderful things to be expected as the team continues building and bringing cool stuff to this baby. In a word, this is a team who makes the best of the simple thing, I’m holding all optimistic about its future development and looking forward to that.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/agsvzsFqiUylsskY0rCqY.png?height=270&width=1415)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1642273256,\"title\":\"User Feedback-better slingshot\"},\"digest\":\"i_BZOF4Plz2SIqc8eLCQOJEnaRYYPo8H7FQ06TmFUDw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8F2A0c6BDd5c1f61552558D2C0D2Afe6d3dC5272\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"5LLxvpGj-v_netFQvWPMQzcCvgthLvmjRT42wkpN7l0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NAlIn7erIQTyCpdGN60R8bbxA9kPPVIFTBKlFR4nYS0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"q5W_ijL4O4rqTwgtpSFOEnLRKSDgdRKCSVWL1L6eYRkcYlGYvYIEKB3FtzVyXSbQDNYEAGo5_PoNWO98a8CoIQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xba78dc8ae761e3f2c7f73b42d27ee5b2fc5988d9236d0027c09db689bfa0e06741f6be316b8cdb14de92049539667ebd6a2b2b9e5a9a8bfee08a42b7b199c59d1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"5LLxvpGj-v_netFQvWPMQzcCvgthLvmjRT42wkpN7l0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NAlIn7erIQTyCpdGN60R8bbxA9kPPVIFTBKlFR4nYS0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Yv3IItjrJqg_SnXf0nldMu_kjYj4PyY3FYR1WkpqMUQ\"}"
