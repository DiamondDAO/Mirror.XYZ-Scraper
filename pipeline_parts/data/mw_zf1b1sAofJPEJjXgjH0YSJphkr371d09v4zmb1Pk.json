"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Some people say that those who struggle to choose a pen for practicing writing; those who are obsessed with the camera for photography; those who struggle to choose an e-book reader for reading books ...... Those so-called equipment party, ultimately do not learn well.\\n\\nThis certainly reflects a problem, not only is the individual in the initial establishment of the goal of the lost, but also may be due to the imperfection of society in the supply of information, resulting in the increased cost of access to information, understanding that in the end, a tired, feeling \\\"deep water\\\", \\\"false\\\" ..... Negative effect on consumer confidence, weakening the target source of motivation.\\n\\nNot an excuse for lazy people, but such phenomena do exist. We also can't just emphasize the role of subjective factors, like our parents did when we were kids and test results came out: You must not have worked hard enough to get that! Very often, a competent weapon, a highly skilled practitioner, a unique environment, a little accounted for the same, the result will be completely different.\\n\\nThe same foreign book, the existence of two publishers, the two different levels of translation. For the reader, the purpose is to read the book itself, yet what about picking the version with the slightly inferior translation? The reading experience is seriously affected, and the reader may be unaware of it, with annoyed mood after reading, hurriedly thrown aside, the heart criticism is not enough, run to the book review column to complain a lot, so the subsequent book buyers know, advise each other: this book is very poor, do not buy!\\n\\nReaders are wrong? No, he is not. Assuming he picked a good translation, including him, I wonder how many people will benefit from it!\\n\\nSimilarly, a high end computer, people think that for the usual just code, do audit people can not use; but when the problem arises, the card machine, the computer blue screen .... Although it is some simple repair can be used normally is not a problem, but the long-term accumulation of this series of small failures and how much impact will be caused to the user? Perhaps, he will be disgusted with the work in front of the screen, the dissatisfaction with the computer transferred to the work content, and then transferred to their lives ......\\n\\nBeautiful things always have infinite possibilities. Suppose a coder is using a high end macbook, he is typing and typing and suddenly has inspiration to learn some drawing, followed by open classes, PS,AI,3DMax, Coreldraw ..... Transformation into a designer, not without the possibility of a great experience gives him this possibility, and if he is placed in front of just a couple of thousand cottage computers, the possibility will be extremely low, tending to 0.\\n\\nWhen I decide to do something, the preparatory work (mostly shopping) should account for 30%-50% of the overall workload, to confirm that the items are within their financial reach of the largest range, and the most suitable for their own will buy, so as to ensure that the item will bring me long-term positive benefits: I have fully understood the product, even if the back of the problem will be solved in a timely manner, never bring adverse, fatal impact on the whole work.\\n\\nSome people may think that spending a lot of time and energy to shop for equipment is detrimental to the achievement of the goal, indeed, as mentioned above, once the time is spent in, people are easily lost in the sea of information, and eventually into another pit, contrary to the purpose. So, first of all, you must be sure to firm up their goals, for people with weak willpower or a lack of certain aspects, equipment may be more important to make up for their deficiencies, and in the purchase of this piece, such people are easy to lose information and give up, then I suggest that do not choose their own, directly buy the most sales, random Google search is mentioned the most on the line, do not bother to ask this and that, the whole process will not exceed The whole process will not take more than 2 hours. Grasp a good degree, while mastering the information search and filtering tips, you can significantly reduce the early time, to facilitate the subsequent learning.\",\"timestamp\":1634374851,\"title\":\"Philosophy of object selection\\n\"},\"digest\":\"lKMrKrNLR71emeU-ZO02W-qGzJxJugHouLicniFwIbo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x71213a9C9504E406d3242436A4bf69c6bfE74461\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cDh4EsNRM8B8ZnIKO5zIFo0g-V7mbXpI9coPM1dGvgk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"6ChVoybo9kX-_IxfHk1lLpAdkr0vmiYROKZvAx3cV6E\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"l8aIyswS5dcDzN7C7tpb_jYpS78v38DI_wI0RDgr_MvZqQV2Eutgftk0v1BYu6l2IrBDlBdqeKMPJ2cj2xtQ5g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf0431e21a9c905919dffdb801b62118a7cfda0d1abd6d0f4938f3864444c8f85323e7037edb5097b2371f1be06794c8f47646d14e5af5ab8314b08671cc9a6a21c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cDh4EsNRM8B8ZnIKO5zIFo0g-V7mbXpI9coPM1dGvgk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"6ChVoybo9kX-_IxfHk1lLpAdkr0vmiYROKZvAx3cV6E\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"lKMrKrNLR71emeU-ZO02W-qGzJxJugHouLicniFwIbo\"}"
