Members of the Avalanche community also participated in the seed round.\\n\\nColony will use the funds to finance early-stage projects building on the Avalanche network and to provide liquidity for decentralized finance, or DeFi, protocols. Colony’s community will also have the opportunity to invest in early-stage projects through a process called ecosystem farming.\\n\\nUnder Colony’s validator program, 10% of the accelerator’s capital will be deployed in Avalanche’s native AVAX token to be staked. Another 10% will be allocated to the top 10 Avalanche projects by market capitalization. Fifty percent will be used to support teams and projects building on the network, with the remaining 30% allocated to liquidity protocols.\\n\\n***Related: [Finance Redefined: Avalanche launches $200M fund, wXRP to debut on Ethereum, Oct. 29–Nov. 5](https://cointelegraph.com/news/finance-redefined-avalanche-launches-200m-fund-wxrp-to-debut-on-ethereum-oct-29-nov-5)***\\n\\nAvalanche has quickly emerged as a leading blockchain project after [receiving](https://twitter.com/zhusu/status/1452788002128740353) backing from some of crypto’s biggest venture funds, including [Zhu Su’s Three Arrows Capital](https://cointelegraph.com/news/three-arrows-capital-ceo-backtracks-on-ethereum-abandonment-comments) and Polychain Capital, among others.
