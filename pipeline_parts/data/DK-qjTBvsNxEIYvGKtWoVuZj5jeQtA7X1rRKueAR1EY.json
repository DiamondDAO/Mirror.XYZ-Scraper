"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Everyone has ideas. \\n\\nSometime's called visions. \\n\\nI'd know, because I've built other people's ideas while trying to build mine.\\n\\nStill, this is pretty normal while growing up during the internet's golden age. Most of this generation is proficient enough in multiple skill sets, that executing on an array of ideas would be the most logical course of action. Not only can this introduce alternate streams of income, it also builds the foundation of your brand.\\n\\nWe all look at creating brands as telling a story. But in narcissistic fashion, I rather look at it as building worlds. With entities that include protagonist, antagonist and the environment. An important brand will touch on a multitude of problems. Our favourite brands like Disney, encapsulates companies from resorts to software development studios. But the brilliance is how all these companies interact with each other. The network, a web spun by the parent company â€” Walt Disney. This can be achieved with choosing a north star. Principles that act as guidelines to ensure consistency.\\n\\nThere's a coined term, \\\"Startup Studio\\\". It's the idea of creating many different entities under the roof of one company. It's very easy to build ideas as they come into your head. Especially when you're a developer. But that's the point of this post. A letter to the universe. To cement my path towards building a studio with all the products intertwined.\\n\\nThe way I've been approaching this concept, while still keeping that dopamine boost of spontaneity, is seeing where I can recycle ideas. I started with an initial principal. I wanted to build products for creators. Many ideas failed, but that's where the recycling comes in to play. A product may not be a market success, but as you break down the idea atom by atom, new ideas are created with the same initial principal. I'm not a rocket scientist, but I believe that's how atoms work.\\n\\nThere is second pillar when it comes to building a product studio. It's the act of creating a system of processes. Since the majority of products being built wont be a success, It's important to be able to fail fast. For me, this meant the following:\\n\\n* Choose a studio wide framework and coding language\\n* Create a SaaS starter ([1upblitz.com](https://www.1upblitz.com/))\\n* Notion templates\\n* Reusable React components\\n* Fully coded landing pages riddled with Lorem Ipsum & email captures\\n* Marketing tasks for first 100 users\\n\\nThe funny thing is, most of all these processes can be recycled into it's own product. They can all be connected, and leverage each others audience to funnel into more sales. \\n\\nOn a final note, don't get too attached to ideas. You never know what will stick. But it's important to fail, and fail fast. Keep it moving. Recycle. Create an ecosystem. Determine principals and processes and it will make the journey easier for you.\",\"timestamp\":1637258953,\"title\":\"Building an ecosystem of products\"},\"digest\":\"1cJVZOvOoLrqpmL31JoK9tPjYfruVT2ZrAfgpET69rU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x60D959C97833F8791260190A085d2dcF6d5Ab9D0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"aAA5nXF9vgwPfCuUB3fF3X62zhxFXS1g1m5I1Bvr0cI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"9V581qU6128Nbi-5uqruZ1wlfljPckdlNX5e_aZ7mqY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"amoQpHAZ1iecONJe2mnii6ODm0jGLqy_qnrWQKo64V7Vkey7wWXiG-ZJ0P9Ee5bQ6zH114RCp7Ja_NsIb6pggw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x95536cc1b70c7a5ff4af18b10465811d66cf512bf283b4c95b2901b2895da61c3c5da1d2f1c6a024b44215ff57308a29094bb3eeaf00369e8f345234c41ddf281c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"aAA5nXF9vgwPfCuUB3fF3X62zhxFXS1g1m5I1Bvr0cI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"9V581qU6128Nbi-5uqruZ1wlfljPckdlNX5e_aZ7mqY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"4FkwzUkZIb9Lfvrh6XOIfC3irDRHNOSZu2vEf_Qg6V0\"}"
