"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Efforts for ecological construction, empowering the infrastructure construction of Web3\\nIn essence, Filecoin is just a low-level broker market. Demanders and storage providers use the blockchain to establish trustless connections, and the applications built on Filecoin in the future are the true value of Filecoin.\\n\\nThe first person to see this is probably the Ethereum developer ConsenSys. Soon after the Filecoin mainnet went live, ConsenSys announced the cooperation with the Filecoin development team for inter-project integration, allowing developers to use Infura, Codefi, MetaMask and other ConsenSys projects. IPFS and Filecoin functions are integrated into its application. In addition to ConsenSys, Canadian technology company ChainSafe and other technology companies have also supported Filecoin and launched storage applications based on IPFS and Filecoin.\\nIn terms of storage applications, Filecoin has reached cooperation with NFT projects or companies such as Dapper Labs and OpenSea so that such projects can store metadata or NFT content data through the Filecoin network. In addition, Textile has also created cross-chain bridges for NEAR and Polygon using Filecoin storage to facilitate interaction between users and developers. In addition, Ninth City, a U.S.-listed company, also cooperated with Polygon and Filecoin development team Protocol Labs on the NFT's NFT platform NFTSTAR and GameFi projects.\\n\\nIt is worth mentioning that two months ago, Filecoin and Chainlink jointly launched a funding program to support developers to develop a \\\"hybrid smart contract\\\" that integrates Chainlink oracles and Filecoin storage, and for Filecoin to enter DeFi and other areas that require extensive use of oracles. The native blockchain market has opened the door.\\n\\nIn terms of investment in ecological construction, Filecoin has also spared no expense. It has jointly launched an incubator and tens of millions of dollars in ecological investment funds with institutions including Huobi, Ouyi OKEx's Block Dream Fund and Fenbushi Capital, which are the upper level of Filecoin in the future. Building construction provides abundant funds and resources.\\n\\nThe layout of Filecoin in the Web3 field is too numerous to list, so I wonâ€™t repeat them here. In addition to Web3, Filecoin has also launched a real data storage reward program to promote applications in the traditional field. The program has designated several \\\"witnesses\\\" \\\"The miner can submit the actual data storage requirements to the witnesses. If passed, the effective data capacity stored by the miner can be recognized by the network as 10 times the effective storage capacity. That is, if a miner stores 10G of real data, the Filecoin network will use it as 100G of effective storage capacity to issue mining rewards. After the implementation of the plan, companies including the photography company Taopaipai have tried to use Filecoin to store data and files, because compared to traditional cloud storage, the use of Filecoin to store the service provider is the agreement rather than the customer. , Directly reducing the cost to zero.\",\"timestamp\":1634479474,\"title\":\"What happened during the year when the Filecoin mainnet went live?\"},\"digest\":\"ScYCvANB4OHWgK6wyA6JX1KDQqb7m7UeHRqc9-us6fI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xB21aC2Bf5014b928B66534c159E06D89bb5a899f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jeJkRu97glpSvkM3fG0TGDnq0ouzSbbmO5DJJSk8QAo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3Sz9kpLPp5cvCzZ3ZaaO-AakTGaVh1iRPDtNwd0kSjY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"nWbWCshYIEeQnW46ofyBeciGAafQ9hbIu43n_YA-7WE1burmlr9_qNf8iGze2YCg9veF710YEoaoi_yj-UKjcA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd07a210ad80984b1de2fe7cbf9f838a970782adc49b5d83671cb97c27e53624e4e9fc03eca87db0087191afed4c41a304980dc672a20547c65011691387739ba1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jeJkRu97glpSvkM3fG0TGDnq0ouzSbbmO5DJJSk8QAo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3Sz9kpLPp5cvCzZ3ZaaO-AakTGaVh1iRPDtNwd0kSjY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ScYCvANB4OHWgK6wyA6JX1KDQqb7m7UeHRqc9-us6fI\"}"
