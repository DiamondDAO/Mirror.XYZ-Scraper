"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"[Axie players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTG1KC0K91o&feature=youtu.be) have estimated you can make $1.50 – 2.50 per hour grinding battles. Not enough to laugh your way to the bank, but for players in less developed countries this can be significant. For the average U.S. player, this is enough to supplement reinvestment into the game and keep playing without having to immediately make additional purchases to advance. \\n\\nAxie Infinity growth lead Jeff Zirlin says “Axie appeals to a few different archetypes of entrepreneurial gamers. We have grinders and farmers from lower average-income countries like Venezuela and Indonesia. We also have intense PVP competitors that love the liquid token rewards for our leaderboard. Collectors and traders, empowered by our Ethereum-based marketplace, have bought and sold individual Axies for [over ten thousand dollars](https://axieedge.com/highest-axie-sales/)— with zero counterparty risk. \\n\\nMoving forward, we’d like to further empower our community by allowing them to earn a token that allows them to govern the ecosystem in the future, making decisions like what content to add within the universe, what tech upgrades should be focused on, and what to do with funds generated by the game’s operation.”\\n\\n#### A new form of community economics\\n\\nProgressive game developers are embracing game extensibility, encouraging the community to build tools and experiences on top of the game to enhance its utility. It’s common for game developers to look to their user base to help design future content to be added into a game. This could be voting for or designing a new set of skins, a new level, or even unique game modes. \\n\\nBut today, this process provides no long term benefit to the community members who help to create high quality content.\\n\\nSome examples of extensibility are [deck tracking tools](https://skyweaverdecks.com/) for a digital card game, or sites\",\"timestamp\":1639040870,\"title\":\"Axie players have estimated you can make $1.50 – 2.50 per hour grinding battles\"},\"digest\":\"o6z9c1ssrIPljAubfLHoevOpLAZlLuXdf3NXjuyz1t4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2b02466633bE17c2B131430b6B3d2e5CB918c964\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3rdg5Bx_4yxfiiUIvEMJGkQeAGpSh-yGSOamY-0bZkM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"om8yFSjfBHQnlBBKS7abFr69-VhL3DYIUn2HyKl8Wf4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"PkR3_MvMFyxgp3Lr3UBu6VdT6V5skEVZQOVs0Yac-8CpNHT4amHFrQlyz9SK4SgDLt2yubLEoaikVAAVkbFDXA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x76be8ed67ee59308f1c89d08aadfcd1ba90d5b9e4d675e2c421b836fba8638d95cf4a9fd7e6127672d18549f5fa15f02005c9dac351106ae62c8396e08d44f771c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3rdg5Bx_4yxfiiUIvEMJGkQeAGpSh-yGSOamY-0bZkM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"om8yFSjfBHQnlBBKS7abFr69-VhL3DYIUn2HyKl8Wf4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"o6z9c1ssrIPljAubfLHoevOpLAZlLuXdf3NXjuyz1t4\"}"
