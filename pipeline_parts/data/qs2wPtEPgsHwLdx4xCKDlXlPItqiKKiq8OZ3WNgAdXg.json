"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*_p6XzG6mhJwNjsdTcBe1TQ.png)\\n\\nWe are excited to announce that WePiggy is coming to [Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network/), the Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform on Polkadot, starting with [Moonriver](https://moonbeam.network/networks/moonriver/), the network’s sister parachain on Kusama. WePiggy will join the growing ecosystem of DeFi projects building on Moonbeam, offering a secure, powerful, and user-friendly cross-chain lending protocol to the Kusama and Polkadot community.\\n\\nMoonriver is a layer one parachain (sub-chain) that leverages Kusama relay chain (parent chain) security. It is the sister of the upcoming Moonbeam chain on the Polkadot relay chain. Kusama targets rapid testing and long-tail applications, whereas Polkadot is optimized for stability and less frequent changes.\\n\\nWePiggy focuses on building an open-source, non-custodial crypto-asset lending market protocol that helps users realize asset appreciation and maximize utilization across many blockchain networks. WePiggy actively creates a more diverse lending market, optimizes the execution efficiency of smart contracts, and expands more dimensions of the business logic. Under WePiggy multi-chain deployment plan, WePiggy is covering Ethereum, OKExChain, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Huobi Eco Chain, and innovative public and Layer-2 networks.\\n\\n## WePiggy + Moonriver / Moonbeam\\n\\nWePiggy’s core development team will work with the Moonriver / Moonbeam team to promote the integration in phases:\\n\\nThe governance proposal has been passed, and the first phase is the official launch on Moonriver mainnet and the start of the liquidity mining program.\\n\\nNext, after the infrastructures on Moonbeam mainnet are ready, the core development team will propose a specific plan for WePiggy to be deployed on the Moonbeam mainnet.\\n\\nMoonbeam will contribute to the building of DeFi infrastructures, by trading liquidity, lending liquidity, and integrating price-feeds. This helps to eliminate the systemic risk of the WePiggy protocol.\\n\\nMoonbeam will also provide its marketing resources to WePiggy, bringing new users to the WePiggy protocol.\\n\\nAdditionally, marketing events between WePiggy and Moonbeam are on the way.\\n\\n***“Participating in the ecosystem of Polkadot is an important part of our multi-chain deployment plan. The launches on the Moonriver and Moonbeam mainnet can undoubtedly get traffic support from the Polkadot community, gain greater influence, user base and capital scale, and increase WePiggy’s industry reputation and brand value. ”***\\n\\n**– Ron, Zheng, Founder and CEO of WePiggy**\\n\\n## About WePiggy\\n\\nWePiggy is an open-source, non-custodial, crypto asset lending market protocol. In WePiggy’s market, users can deposit their crypto assets to earn interest, or borrow other crypto assets by paying interest. WePiggy aims to spread the benefits of cryptocurrency’s freedom and transparency to the widest possible user community in a more friendly and simple way, as well as be a good partner for them in wealth management.\\n\\n**[Website](https://wepiggy.com/)**\\\\*\\\\* | **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/wepiggydotcom)** | **[Medium](https://wepiggy-com.medium.com/)** | **[Forum](https://gov.wepiggy.com/)** | **[Discord](https://discord.gg/pew9k58)** | **[Github](https://github.com/WePiggy)** | \\\\*\\\\***[Telegram](https://t.me/wepiggy)**\\n\\n## About the Moonbeam Network\\n\\nMoonbeam is an Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform on the Polkadot network that makes it easy to build natively interoperable applications. This Ethereum compatibility allows developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and DApp frontends to Moonbeam with minimal changes. As a parachain on the Polkadot network, Moonbeam will benefit from the shared security of the Polkadot relay chain and integrations with other chains that are connected to Polkadot. Currently in active development by PureStake, Moonbeam is expected to reach MainNet by January 2022.\\n\\n**[Telegram](https://t.me/Moonbeam_Official)**\\\\*\\\\* |**[\\\\*\\\\* Twitter\\\\*\\\\*](https://twitter.com/moonbeamnetwork)** |**[\\\\*\\\\* Discord\\\\*\\\\*](https://harmony.one/discord)** |**[\\\\*\\\\* YouTube\\\\*\\\\*](https://www.youtube.com/c/MoonbeamNetwork?sub_confirmation=1)** |**[\\\\*\\\\* Medium\\\\*\\\\*](https://medium.com/moonbeam-network)** |**[\\\\*\\\\* GitHub\\\\*\\\\*](https://github.com/PureStake/moonbeam)** |**[\\\\*\\\\* LinkedIn\\\\*\\\\*](https://www.linkedin.com/company/moonbeam-network/)** |**[\\\\*\\\\* Reddit\\\\*\\\\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/moonbeam/)** | \\\\*\\\\***[Website](https://moonbeam.network/)**\",\"timestamp\":1639969589,\"title\":\"WePiggy Integrates with Moonriver to Bring Multi-Chain Lending Protocol to Kusama\"},\"digest\":\"oxShj_V2zUsiz7AVfFrS25arfVuhqYngyXWx7yAbltg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xf14a9FA917a5517867e4e0018f320c1F6BF6f182\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"UTGWUUwEtX_RtgqE6b0mS8feTEd4sdWQnPa0LML83hs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"OUgodDF45U77jdEMOeHVVrWPT-cZYy8H8vmj59Zzcto\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"NaJXBTNdpCjU3vDzgNRJ5Hn_XGjDC2zxHrpPkub-tRXnRQGdlt0Wr_BPPuItw7LSdhnLuDWnWyA9q5EhKDDT3g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x816bbe8c5287b3b9a0d8a79200153324211f060a42854fa225531a4ecbcc685347ba5931bed33d34332f6a36e558582c1e893cee26c1a5b2c7755c1879da49f51c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"UTGWUUwEtX_RtgqE6b0mS8feTEd4sdWQnPa0LML83hs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"OUgodDF45U77jdEMOeHVVrWPT-cZYy8H8vmj59Zzcto\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"oxShj_V2zUsiz7AVfFrS25arfVuhqYngyXWx7yAbltg\"}"
