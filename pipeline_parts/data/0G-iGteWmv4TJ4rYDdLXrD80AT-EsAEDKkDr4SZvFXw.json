"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Crabbe wasn't the most prime flavour in Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans, but at least he had the good grace to admit it. Most days the stuff that happened around him reminded him of that mathematic problem from his childhood which had involving balancing Galleons, nickles, and knuts, no matter how much he applied himself, he wasn't able to solve it. His mother had said that his brain was a sieve that sometimes sifted things it wasn't supposed to and that's just the way it was.\\n\\nStill, Crabbe made do much better than most.\\n\\nFor example, after the Quidditch match the other day, it had been such a close save in the common room! Crabbe had been reporting to Draco about the daft Hufflepuffs when Draco abruptly slid an arm around his shoulders and declared, \\\"you needn't pull down your knickers for farting my dear chuckaboo, \\\" much to the gleeful cackles of all purebloods. Crabbe had chortled along with others even though the punchline had sailed over his head as unerringly as a delivery owl. \\n\\nTwo days after that, Draco had been so pleased with him- no, Crabbe wasn't making it up- Draco had said so himself! Crabbe had nicked the hair of an unsuspecting Ravenclaw girl for their Polyjuice Potion experiment so neatly, that Draco had made him in charge of procuring hair strands for all their future undertakings. Take that Goyle, Crabbe had snorted.\\n\\nAnd now, incredibly, things were taking off like a new snitch in an open sky! He had borrowed this analogy from one of Draco's essays but never mind! Originality was just a matter of hiding the source.\\n\\nAnd now, things would be even more different. Crabbe knew Draco's BIG SECRET after all.\\n\\nAs if felix felicis were running in Crabbe's veins- golden, wonderful! No, not golden actually, he amended with a shudder, make that emerald green.\\n\\nFinally, finally, Draco would have to stop making him take Polyjuice to turn into that tittering second year Hufflepuff girl! And not a day too soon as far as Crabbe was concerned. He was done collecting details on the mudblood's schedule. She was so mind numbingly boring, her nose always in one book or the other!\\n\\nAs for the secret, well, Crabbe had stumbled upon it quite by accident.\\n\\nHe was in his Hufflepuff form-*what else*-and making his way to the Slytherin common room, when he heard the mudblood. Crabbe paused and let out a long suffering sigh, he had thought his duty was over when he hadn't found her in the library but no-she had the audacity to be roaming outside like a stray cat!\\n\\nHe would have informed the patrolling prefects but Draco had forbidden him from doing stuff like that. \\\"They would catch you too you moron!\\\" That's exactly why Crabbe's mother had told him to outsource his thinking to Draco because really, Draco was smart like that.\\n\\nCrabbe could see a play of shadows around the corner where the mudblood's voice had come from. He flattened himself on the castle's thick wall making it easy for him to eavesdrop without being noticed.\\n\\n\\\"-just want to cease your sense of wonderment.\\\"\\n\\nCrabbe's breathing hitched in excitement. But that was Draco's voice!\\n\\n\\\"Admit it, Granger, you want to choke yourself with books and convert all mysteries of our world into questions. You want to feel special when you solve them. Take away your habit of correcting others to feel superior to them, of constantly bombarding them with knowledge so that the opinions you have borrowed from books may seem like your own, and the world may very quickly figure out that there is little else going on for you.\\\"\\n\\nCrabbe pushed a fist into his mouth to stop the sound of his snigger from escaping his lips. Draco really was so smart!\\n\\nA minute later he heard the mudblood reply, \\\"Fine! I borrow my opinions from books. But at least I am the one who selects them. I really pity you Malfoy, you act as a glove puppet for your Ventriloquist parents with no inkling about the strings that move you.\\\"\\n\\nCrabbe's brows scrunched up and he stepped forward to peer at the two. Draco was standing very close to the mudblood, his hands itching up to close around her throat.  That's right, Crabbe cheered mentally, show her who's in charge, Draco! Ventro-*whatever* hippogriff crap.\\n\\nThe mudblood pressed herself closer to Draco, whispering something and then...bit his ear. Just like an animal, Crabbe noted in disgust, delighting when Draco's other hand tightened around the mudblood's waist. Then several things seem to happen at a pace too fast for Crabbe to process.\\n\\nThe mudblood leveled her hand at Draco's hair and muttered in a low but clear voice, \\\"Tergeo.\\\"\\n\\nImmediately, Draco pushed himself away from her, both his hands clutching his head, an expression of disbelief on his face. \\\"Aww what the fuck, Granger!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It looks better this way,\\\" she replied, and Crabbe thought there was laughter in her voice but he couldn't be sure. The mudblood rarely laughed. The last time he had heard her show a human emotion was...actually never.\\n\\n\\\"I am not taking tips on how to take care of my hair from you,\\\" Draco muttered, running a hand through his silver curls, much to Crabbe's awe. He hadn't known Draco had curls!\\n\\nCrabbe had to really strain himself to hear what was being said, suddenly Draco's voice had dropped an octave, \\\"Your hair looks like a product of Crookshank' cross-species mating with Longbottom's toad.\\\"\\n\\nCrabbe forgot he was hiding this time and a low giggle broke free from him. Draco and the mudblood stiffened, drawing apart. Bugger! Crabbe quickly pressed himself against the wall, his heart pounding in his ears. 'If I can't see them, they can't see me', he mentally chanted.\\n\\n\\\"Did you hear that?\\\" Asked the mudblood.\\n\\n\\\"We should get going. I heard Filch has been doubling down on his rounds,\\\" Draco replied.\\n\\nCrabbe heard some rustling and waited with abated breath till their voices grew distant. Phew! That was close. He hurried back to the dungeon, trying to piece together what had happened. Unfortunately, sleep took him over as soon as he hit his bed. It was tiring being a simpering second year Hufflepuff girl after all.\\n\\nThe next morning, Crabbe's drowsy eyes opened to note that Draco was already dressed up. He looked on as Draco stood in front of the dressing table and glared at the hair gel for a long time, as if Snape may ask him to make an exact replica later. \\n\\nCrabbe remembered his discovery from last night's rounds and hastily removing the duvet from over himself, he walked up to Draco's side.\\n\\n\\\"I know your big secret,\\\" he told Draco in a conspiring whisper. Draco did not appear to hear him, turning around absentmindedly. \\\"Get ready, Crabbe. We'll be late for breakfast.\\\"\\n\\nDon't want to talk now, do you, big boy? Crabbe mentally snickered but he was famished himself, so he freshened up.\\n\\nHe could wait till Draco had something in his stomach to retch out!\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nCrabbe was still reveling in his knowledge, looking at Draco sympathetically. The latter kept drumming his fingers on the table even though breakfast had been served, throwing glances at the entrance every half a minute. Then abruptly, he turned towards his plate and started piling it up with poached eggs, his cheeks flushed. Crabbe looked up and saw the mudblood staring at Draco. Her cheeks were definitely pulled into something that could pass for a smile.\\n\\nCrabbe could hold himself back no longer. \\\"You are afraid of that mudblood, Draco! I know it. I know you did not even wear hair gel today in case she hexes you again!\\\"\\n\\nAt the mudblood's mention, Draco swiveled around and looked at Crabbe, making a sound in the back of his throat—a growling sort of laugh, unexpected, unsettling, unpolished. Crabbe felt a pang of anxiety, as if something was slipping by him. As if peeves had taken the thoughts in his head and transcribed them into a language he did not know. \\n\\nDraco swung his arm around Crabbe's neck again like that day in the common room and said, \\\"Oh Crabbe, you sweet, sweet summer child, here take some more walnuts.\\\"\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1639326371,\"title\":\"Sweet Summer Child\"},\"digest\":\"y21tNK_UOnMCnL6cdIEdTS7u5imetONPlAKPaQZAkIk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x23860B3E7000fa31B3081592Bd54434e789E2365\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wqjRmf4wq4AHoyKBHMumkrTIHTi9dbC6XMSwnEl4BQg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Yvs2QX2QJ4l8nURmbiK-59ydPIHYaAhxLR5HBP5Nvno\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"fYvU-aJ9aECXQ6WWx9Rx-9NgeZGZYK3NRXCfoKZcgS-Ns07lkHbz2Oo4uzWJf0rNvrRrkA62K1y3-xS9fZOc-Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x32b2557184a4d32c18b9b17dd878c6165dddc2ff635cdf97b9ac56b87b021db768a14c865555bbca4451140e99856e935679ef1fb3c279bfada35ebb1c5da5eb1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wqjRmf4wq4AHoyKBHMumkrTIHTi9dbC6XMSwnEl4BQg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Yvs2QX2QJ4l8nURmbiK-59ydPIHYaAhxLR5HBP5Nvno\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"y21tNK_UOnMCnL6cdIEdTS7u5imetONPlAKPaQZAkIk\"}"
