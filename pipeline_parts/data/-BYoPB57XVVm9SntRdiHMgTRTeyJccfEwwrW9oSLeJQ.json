In the 2nd grade, when people were making baking soda volcanos, my project was on anti-gravitics. Coming from generations of farmers, my middle school projects explored aeroponics and the use of fiber optics to create alternate, energy-efficient methods of industrial lighting. And in 8th grade I got 1st in the Bay Area for Experimental Design and 3rd in the State. \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MNFfaf6PtV3QP3X1MuoCJ.png?height=633&width=798)\\n\\nAt the end of 8th grade I got my first taste of business when I was appointed “CEO” for a group project where we learned to create and run our own business. We called it “Unrated: We Have What They Don’t” and sold snacks and other small goods during lunch. At the end of the year, I had the idea of making a class t-shirt, so I hopped on Vistaprint, designed a front and back of a shirt and pre-sold it to my entire 8th grade class. \\n\\n![Unrated : We Have What They Don't \\\"Vintage\\\" Tee](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_oq5qczFAUDuc34ggadiB.png?height=4032&width=3024)\\n\\nIn high school, I continued my passion of making clothes by making production merch and created a streetwear brand called “Unbendables” with my friend where we sourced the shirts, vinyl-cut the material, and sold at school for a short run.\\n\\n![Unbendables : \\\"If It Bends It Breaks\\\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aK-Ur0qK8kyD1Ahft2qTK.png?height=4032&width=3024)\\n\\nIt was around then, I learned about the \\\\**cue Money Man - Blockchain*\\\\* blockchain technology & cryptocurrencies when writing a paper for AP Econ, and in 2013 I joined my Marketing & Management class where I was appointed “CEO” once again and we created a company called heArt, a digital platform for artists to auction/sell IRL art. Here’s the link to my first NFT in the “Whitepaper Collection” which includes my crypto report from 2013 and the business plan to heArt:\\n\\n[https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/67535360450453933326890224387754850460346845537266990341055626080155414854179/](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/67535360450453933326890224387754850460346845537266990341055626080155414854179/)\\n\\nWhen we went to a trade show in Bakersfield, we were short on art pieces so I made a pseudonym called “Aave” and drew a black line on a blank poster paper.\\n\\nThe mode of our company was an auction,  “Aave” made this piece on the concept that while there is so much white on the paper, most of us tend to focus on the black line; just like in life; while there is so much “good” occurring around us, our minds tend to gravitate toward the “bad”.  Although we were using fiat currency, the piece sold for $187,000+ at the auction. Here’s a pic of the auction at the trade show :\\n\\n![heArt : Design Your Mind](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/F-I9h2rjN_06PfEkafZxQ.jpg?height=847&width=1445)\\n\\nAfter working with local artists and attending studio sessions, I saw the disparity for the rising artist to acquire funding and the right process for successful launches. Inspired by E-40, Master P, and Stones Throw Records, a few friends and I created Lone Wolves Entertainment. Later that year, I went to NYC for my first time, where I went on a “pilgrimage of hip hop.” From “the Birthplace of Hip Hop”, Big L’s memorial, Jay-Z’s house, to ending it watching the demolition of 5 Pointz, I knew that Hip-Hop was much bigger that the music or the city, it was CULTURE. \\n\\nFast forward to University, inspired by the independent artist cause that was brewing in my city, I was making music as a hobby and was working on creating a music streaming platform that would be geared toward fair artist compensation. As we were gearing up to code a prototype, Jay-Z launched Tidal. Thinking it was over, I scrapped the project and went back to the drawing board. I knew creating something independent and community-driven, like the principles of Hip-Hop ingrained in me, was essential to my core message. \\n\\n![\\\"Merging Hip Hop & Spirituality\\\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/w4Oy8Kr4LbOHula48LNy2.png?height=549&width=975)\\n\\nFrom my accounting professor telling me “people like you don’t deserve to be here” my first day of University to learning about ENRON and it’s national-level scams as a part of course curriculum, I simply didn’t resonate with the current college format. And after getting caught with less than a gram of cannabis on my 19th birthday, I was immediately suspended. Although I felt like it was an extremely unfair and color-based judgment as no one else I knew faced the same consequences for doing much worse, a majority white environment led me to believe that “racism doesn’t exist” and that I didn’t “deserve” to be in college. A couple years later, that same school faced a ton of backlash by other students for the discrimination they faced and even had to change collegiate staff. Since then, I’ve noticed American Universities like to demonize, brainwash, and breed inherent hate toward of particular groups of people and out-the-box thinkers.\\n\\nI said f\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* the “system”, dropped out and started working on the foundation for 5-Dee. It was around then I started getting into meditation and coming across the Jewish Kabbalah and my first Mystery School in New England. After attending a few meditations and having some extraordinary experiences, I was sparked to study various mystical traditions and which created the basis for my second NFT, “Mental Health & Field Dynamics”:\\n\\n[https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/67535360450453933326890224387754850460346845537266990341055626081254926481955/](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/67535360450453933326890224387754850460346845537266990341055626081254926481955/)\\n\\nI came across a video called Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique by Dolores Cannon and was intrigued by the idea of “past life regression work” and “instantaneous healing” of mental and physical conditions. I found my local practitioner and booked a session. Although I cannot share the specifics, the experience was incredible! So much that I went home and signed up to get certified myself. \\n\\nClick here to learn more : [Soul Services](https://www.5-dee.com/link-in-bio)\\n\\nComing back to the Bay, I didn’t want to monetize “spiritual services” so I picked up a job at my local print shop, printing tees and fulfilling orders for companies like Apple and Starbucks. After a couple weeks of waking up every morning at 4 AM and putting in work, I decided this wasn’t it, I up and left the job within my first month. \\n\\n![\\\"Conscious Living For the Now\\\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0cdFm0J6A390JvWgnfOuk.png?height=551&width=980)\\n\\nIt was around then I decided to start creating a media and content production company 5-Dee; community, culture, and commerce centered around hip hop and the goal was de-centralization. This was the foundation for the Genesis piece I minted for my 25th birthday: “occulture”: \\n\\n[https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:493650?tab=owners](https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:493650?tab=owners)\\n\\nThe goal was help a creative get paid, from creating frameworks for course creation to doing online marketing in 2016. From helping record people’s first songs, shooting and edit short films, and setting up their e-commerce presence. I designed logos and websites, edited ads for brands, planned and executed business strategy by helping individuals and brands generate value, often in exchange for services or at a minimal cost. Around then, I started compiling the principles and tools for my third NFT in the “Whitepaper Collection” by the name of **Abundance Business Concepts**.\\n\\n[https://mailchi.mp/e28d761bda80/abundancebusinessconcepts](https://mailchi.mp/e28d761bda80/abundancebusinessconcepts)\\n\\n5-Dee DAO is a headless creative collective geared towards creating high-production content & media, community tooling for the Creator Economy, and a Web3 & Metaverse roadmap that extends to IRL physical experiences. \\n\\nHere are some of our current projects: \\n\\n[https://www.monksandmagic.com/](https://www.monksandmagic.com/)\\n\\n[https://calendly.com/510consciousconsulting/activation-portal](https://calendly.com/510consciousconsulting/activation-portal)\\n\\nMore details to be announced in the 5-DEE DAO white paper, visit us at [5-DEE](https://www.instagram.com/510consciousconsulting/).\\n\\n![5-Dee Studios: Tech-wear for the Future](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4-tfRY0gSbXSuV6PLoQX3.png?height=550&width=980)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639706730,\"title\":\"A CREATOR ECONOMY PT. 1\"},\"digest\":\"kbnIJkzs4DpyVqzwojPkohLEChydOo_h9ZfLRvAwEH8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x954fA8cfb797a26D4878ee212004889a2C9D7624\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nGUrGqyRBdkXupj02ZcDifbw5IEXnn3HGH739q00ae8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"A5F9bdA6pEa1yXZlJaS0VO3lHx9lMC0WNk9unIKCU_Q\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"9p-USGnW259Pt_el46tSl4ZvfbzJQ2O1UULbqMbVTTeMx1ZGJepoj0ihjYLW1NQeJgr1Yk-mBStY1afVmvpNUg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1e9cd028c65cb989e107871eb1ef168e8f61757a297a3a0c7675d16bd31ffd477b9a9ea8d6bab8a2dccf300a29e4df2f8680450921b3b21453bbb4cc8f48171f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nGUrGqyRBdkXupj02ZcDifbw5IEXnn3HGH739q00ae8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"A5F9bdA6pEa1yXZlJaS0VO3lHx9lMC0WNk9unIKCU_Q\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"kbnIJkzs4DpyVqzwojPkohLEChydOo_h9ZfLRvAwEH8\"}"
