So now that your brain is on fire and completely overwhelmed by the emerging vastness of the metaverse, should you just ape into the first project that you think looks cool? No. Aping is fun, but missing out on the next project that will inevitably come because of a sudden lack of funds is not. THAT is real FOMO.\\n\\nThe best way to avoid FOMO, but more importantly have conviction about your jpegs is to develop a self-honest framework to evaluate a project across key attributes. This will inevitably look different for everyone - What do you care about? What do you find interesting? What makes you happy? What will you be willing to spend time and energy on?\\n\\nThe factors I look at for every project are:\\n\\n* Art / Aesthetic\\n* Memability\\n* Scarcity\\n* Leadership\\n* Community vibes\\n* Brand energy vs hype\\n* High-profile members (whales, celebrities, influencers)\\n* Future direction structure - e.g. roadmap\\n* Cultivation of community content development\\n* Tokenomics / Defi\\n* DAO\\n* Timing...am I early?\\n\\nFull disclosure: I have attempted to include a mix of example NFT projects - from those that I do not own, those I own (am I biased? of course), and those I have sold - always from a positive lens because WAGMI\\n\\n**Art / Aesthetic** - at the end of the day, this is the only thing you truly have and therefore the most important factor about many jpegs. If everything comes crumbling down and our jpegs’ value goes to 0 USD, this is what will be left amongst the rubble. The only rule is to be honest with yourself.\\n\\n* Tier 1: How visually appealing is the jpeg to your brain? Do you think it’s cool? Does it make you smile?\\n\\nDon't take it from me.

The collective emotional state of the community, represented on Discord and Twitter at any given time. Good vibes beget community growth - it is human nature. If I were to boil down the NFT community to the purest positive community vibes - it's Cryptoadz. They’ve built social norms of the community via memes generated by bot commands that directly combat toxic aspects of NFT culture\\n\\n* Toxic dynamic #1: FUD\\n  * Solution: !vibe - first thing comes first when you go to the lily pad (Cryptoadz general chat). Come, stay, vibe. This is your rock, your north star. If you’re feeling yourself, vibe. If you had an awful meeting, vibe. Puppy took a dump in the house? Vibe.\\n* Toxic dynamic #2: conversations complaining about floor price and anyone who spams “DELIST”\\n  * Solution: !floor - 1 toad = 1 toad; a gentle reminder you bought this toad because you like the way it looks/you love vibes/memes make you happy/ we are early\\n* Toxic dynamic #3: roadmap obsession. Structure often inhibits creativity and roadmaps do not rule the world (although can be valuable, see later)\\n  * Solution: !toadmap \\n\\n![!toadmap](https://cdn.mee6.xyz/guild-images/874463570904117268/2b130d84136f2d6c1d2aa86241ad2da791762de95b88a15cc7ad609558196c20.png)\\n\\nOr…..maybe it’s a bad idea to analyze “community” \\n\\n[https://twitter.com/iamDCinvestor/status/1446118914224656384?s=20](https://twitter.com/iamDCinvestor/status/1446118914224656384?s=20)\\n\\n**Brand energy vs hype** - play the long game, it works\\n\\n* Classic NFT hype cycle: \\n\\n  [https://twitter.com/beijingdou/status/1445215919152713729?s=20](https://twitter.com/beijingdou/status/1445215919152713729?s=20)\\n\\n* Another take on the hype cycle \\n\\n  [https://twitter.com/DCLBlogger/status/1443041592382689285?s=20](https://twitter.com/DCLBlogger/status/1443041592382689285?s=20)\\n\\n* Reputation is good, hype is bad \\n\\n  [https://twitter.com/beaniemaxi/status/1443216534877388802?s=20](https://twitter.com/beaniemaxi/status/1443216534877388802?s=20)\\n\\n* Brand management over decades, no hype necessary \\n\\n  [https://twitter.com/magdalenakala/status/1433998743116951556?s=20](https://twitter.com/magdalenakala/status/1433998743116951556?s=20)\\n\\n\\n**High profile members (whales, celebrities, etc)** - who owns and has posted recently? \\n\\nProject examples:\\n\\n* Bored Ape Yacht Club: \\n\\n  [https://boardroom.tv/steph-curry-bored-ape-yacht-club-nft/](https://boardroom.tv/steph-curry-bored-ape-yacht-club-nft/)\\n\\n* Cryptoadz: \\n\\n  [https://twitter.com/krybharat/status/1444816410044153862?s=20](https://twitter.com/krybharat/status/1444816410044153862?s=20)\\n\\n* Humanoids: \\n\\n  [https://twitter.com/packyM/status/1444815867993370624?s=20](https://twitter.com/packyM/status/1444815867993370624?s=20)\\n\\n\\n**Future direction structure (e.g. roadmap)** - a project roadmap should never be the primary lens to analyze a project, but a quality, detailed one can be a large differentiator.
