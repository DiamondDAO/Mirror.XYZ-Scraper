In particular, I like to imagine a world where waste does not exist, where humanity lives in perfect harmony with the planet, and everything that is produced has its place. A world without waste.\\n\\nI imagine this because I’ve been working in the field for almost 25 years and the vision of a world without waste feels further off than it ever did. I can pull together all sorts of statistics to demonstrate the point, but that won’t help the story. Waste generation is increasing, even though society is (apparently) working hard on the problem.\\n\\nIt seems that, unless society takes a different approach, waste will continue to  grow until it eats us all. At that point, we end and nature takes over. We can do better.\\n\\nTo do better feels like a journey of not just solving waste, but also solving society. It feels like a radical thing, something that upends the status quo and replaces it with...a different approach.\\n\\nLet’s be clear here. I don’t know how it will be done. I am not in possession of the fix that just needs funding. I am not trying to persuade anyone of the rightness of my technology or system.\\n\\nInstead, I propose a process to bring solutions from “what might be” to “what is”. This process is collaborative, and I write to bring the process into existence. This article is the first of what shall become many, articles that hope to lay out the foundations for how we might create a world without waste.\\n\\nThe foundations will underpin a DAO that will be formed to deliver the world without waste. The DAO will bring together people and technology, and the foundations explored here will be the first elements of a DAO manifesto. The manifesto will, in turn, guide how the DAO is to execute its mission.\\n\\nAt the moment, there are no foundations, just leitmotifs that need development. Ideas that feel important, that keep recurring in their own way. I list them below, in brief, and will expand on them in later articles. I will also return to this list and hyperlink subsequent articles. This creation is constant.\\n\\n## The leitmotifs\\n\\n* **Spirituality**. This might not be the first thing you’d associate with waste. Why infuse spirit into a material problem? To which I would answer that the treatment of waste as a physical problem has not brought us closer to a solution. I’d suggest that waste is a failing of the mystical, and what needs to emerge also returns spirit.\\n* **People**. People have created the waste problem, both through their systems and through their lack of imagination in how to deal with what the system generates. As a result, people are vital for its resolution. People who are expert and non-expert. People with a range of backgrounds and views, all are part of the solution.\\n* **Story**. Stories are important, partly in the obvious and almost cliched way that stories are how we create meaning. This is true, however I suggest that stories are important on a far deeper level. If we look at stories as the Aboriginal Australians did, as songlines that connect places across the Australian continent, and generation across 60,000 years, then you get the sense of the deep and constructive power of story. They do not interpret the world, but they make the world. Especially when rich, evocative and beautiful, filled with poetry and power.\\n* **Complexity**. Waste emerges out of complexity. It is poorly understood, and any understandings that we currently hold are likely radically incomplete. Waste is the byproduct of society, in itself complex. There is little conscious thought given to it, and so-called “perverse outcomes” are legion. For example, increase landfill levies to make recycling more cost competitive, and you get waste hauled hundreds of kilometers to landfills where levies do not apply.\\n* **Interdependence** and Self-Sovereignty. These are not contradictory, but rather describe the need to be a complete regenerative person in relationship to community. The status quo is a partial self squashed into an extractive box, separate from community. This is true of waste as it is of people. How do we make materials show up as their full potential? How do we make bring waste materials back into relationship? How do we shift an extractive model to a regenerative one?\\n* **Web3 / cryptocurrencies**. Web3 offers immense potential for humanity to shift. At its fundamental level, the blockchain that Web3 is built upon offers a way of assuring peer to peer trust rather than mandating centralised trust. This, in turn, promises to open up a whole new world of doing and being. That’s a big deal, and is nowhere near mapped out. DAOs are one element. Decentralised Finance (DeFi) and Regenerative Finance (ReFi) another. Non Fungible Tokens, tokenomics, yield curves. There is a bright and flourishing world in Web3, and it is a part of the solution to waste.\\n* **Connection**. Waste is, quite possibly, a problem of connection. Of connecting people with each, of connecting ideas, of connecting materials with their home in time and space. It feels an important part of the map.\\n* **Technology**. This clearly plays a role, although in a different way to how it is currently conceived. Technology currently enables scale. Large scale waste plants filled with robotics and machinery and sensors. A new solution takes high functioning technology and applies it at the edge, the local, the small scale. Technology, but different.\\n* **Sensors**. Connected to technology, but worth its own consideration. This is creating systems that can sense materials, and at the very simplest level this is detecting what they are (or even more interestingly, what they might be) when collected or processed. On a larger level this is about building a broad picture of the movement of materials, without impinging on human privacy, to then understand opportunity points. Sensors on rubbish bins to know when they are full is a simple, simple first step. There is so much more to be achieved.\\n* **Artificial Intelligence**. I am fascinated by the potential for AI to steer imperfect decision making. Connected with an increasingly sensed world, as we gather increasing amounts of data, we can see more distributed mapping of what is happening with our materials and so design intelligent, self-learning approaches for the recovery and regeneration of those materials. A nervous system, if you will, that is far more intelligent than what we have now. And for that nervous system to work best it needs to be highly distributed rather than centralised. Just as it works in the human body, so too it needs to work in the social body of humanity.\\n* **Decentralised and distributed**. A system that does not refer back to a centralised source of truth, and distributes decision making away from the centre to the edge where things are felt far more true. This is anarchistic thinking, not in the “blow everything up” way, but in the “mutual aid” way of Kropotkin. It is a form of localism that is highly antifragile - in times of crisis, it turns to local support rather than centralised bail-out.\\n* **Micro economies**. A communal world where micro transactions form a new economy, releasing economic value for everybody in the economy, and not just those who control the means to production (ie the wealthy and already fortunate). That’s less about Marxist rhetoric and more about creating a world of abundance — how can we claim to realise humanity’s full potential with the majority of people are essentially excluded from fully participating?\\n* **Moonshots**. This feels very Silicon Valley, but this 10x thinking has been liberating for me. It sparks an internal dialogue that spirals progressively higher. Testing lots of ideas to quickly come to a BIG idea — 100 ideas for the one killer idea means that you’ve got to be comfortable with failure. Doing a pre-mortem of a project you’re in. Devising action lists ordered by priority of learning rather than priority of importance.\\n\\nThese are the leitmotifs that I can currently think of. I’m sure there are more. I’d love to hear what I’ve missed.\\n\\n## This is not to be left to the engineers\\n\\nI write this as an environmental engineer myself. Engineers are not equipped with the tools to solve this problem. In fact, engineers create the problem of waste in the way they need to reframe and solve the problem of waste.\\n\\nPut another way, following the vibe of “Seeing Like a State”, to make waste legible to engineers, they must strip out all of the elements that solve the problem of waste. Some of these elements are discussed in the leitmotifs above. Others will emerge through discussion.\\n\\n## Developing the leitmotifs\\n\\nTo be clear, the leitmotifs currently feel like a grab-bag of concepts, a potentially meaningless list of things that nobody would object to, but equally, no-one can do anything with. What the hell do they mean for a world without waste?\\n\\nThis is where the fun begins. The leitmotifs are just that, notions that need to be expanded upon. I will do this over the coming articles. There will be a lot of articles. I’m aiming for 100. Some will be highly tangible, dealing with particularities. Others will be philosophical.\\n\\nThe work will be done best where it is done with others. I’d love to collaborate on how to make the leitmotifs whole, the foundations solid and capable of supporting a DAO designed to take action in the world.\\n\\nFinding the others will take time. It must, because there needs to be enough substance for people wandering by to gather around. The idea needs to take form, even if it changes its form quickly.\\n\\n## Formation and transformation\\n\\nPerhaps the analogy here is of the silkworm. As a caterpillar, it eats fiercely, consuming huge amounts of mulberry leaf and grows fast. Eventually it knows that its time has come, and so spins the cocoon, encases itself and is changed into a moth.\\n\\nIt’s not important to get all of this perfect, right from the start. The idea and the collective need to grow through feeding on concepts, growing until they are ready to spin the cocoon for transformation. This will be the 100 article threshold, at which point everything comes together into a thing of great beauty, transforms and emerges the same, but completely different.\\n\\nThis is the start of a journey to create a world without waste. \\n\\nThank you for joining me. I look forward to getting to know you better as the journey unfolds and more channels unfurl for co-development.\",\"timestamp\":1638371235,\"title\":\"Leitmotifs of a world without waste\"},\"digest\":\"Qc8uuOKD1rIWmPjWw68h7iI2Q7cPi040H1fJVLTveh8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x29b2B813dE1eDff985ea63FDd255c995d1171D59\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bYmE918KETRrgIxhCYHORxNpJWj3kLYrdqiS_80-t-A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4HeF0v3_ZjcV-m_HxIDof90ZjJ_yUsUpaXVNMxlgM-4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"mm-AzXq_vVoIqZXXtWmzRV1tFfqKkMfQX4UzWgPMBf0f3gZdnjAAWYoG8dhTpmNlkYZZKfSkaOaysii7ZeP-Bw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4b7dc53f295960a07cf909f535ec75878dcff1deacbc2f540da73a86fdf7e9841f4e1291d2198b8a3fa1b0a2adc64e0c71514e6470c714882b677f693eabc5d11c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bYmE918KETRrgIxhCYHORxNpJWj3kLYrdqiS_80-t-A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4HeF0v3_ZjcV-m_HxIDof90ZjJ_yUsUpaXVNMxlgM-4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"g_25Hqws9ecE-x8an82w36EIkURmMPvyNF6A3WXUkRk\"}"
