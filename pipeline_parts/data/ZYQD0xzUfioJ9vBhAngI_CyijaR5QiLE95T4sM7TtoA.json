In the War this was a “normal” moment. A little older than you.”\\n\\n\\\"I heard from Dad...\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For a long time I blamed your Dad for what happened to Junior. It wasn't easy for him either.” Jacob Sr. paused.\\n\\n“None of the past matters if we lose the future. That's the mission now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You said I could call you Jacob, or Jake. I want to change what everyone calls me. Dad called me \\\"H\\\", because I was the 7th of my \\\"brothers\\\", all gone now. My name is now ‘AL’.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"AL is a good name.
