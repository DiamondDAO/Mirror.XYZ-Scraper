"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I have a [Samsung Frame](https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/the-frame/) in my home office. I think I posted a photo of it here at AVC once before. But for those who did not see that post, here it is:\\n\\n![](https://avc.com/content/uploads/2021/03/PXL\\\\_20210325\\\\_134355481-1501x2048.jpg)\\n\\nI’ve had it for something like three years and I change the digital art on it from time to time.\\n\\nDigital Art has been tricky to purchase and own and the business models around it are a bit challenging.\\n\\nI think NFTs might change that. If artists can get paid for the “original” or a “limited edition” and then make copies free or near free, then I think the digital art market could explode.\\n\\nMy partner Albert [posted about NFTs](https://continuations.com/post/645017712412786688/a-word-on-nfts) a week or so ago and made an important point that I think is a bit lost in all of the hype/mania about NFTs right now:\\n\\n> This is what NFTs do for digital content. They let someone assert “I am the Louvre” (for that piece of content).\\n>\\n> This is not a fad. It is a fundamental and profound innovation.\\n>\\n> https://continuations.com/post/645017712412786688/a-word-on-nfts\\n\\n[Go here](https://continuations.com/post/645017712412786688/a-word-on-nfts) and read the entire thing because “the Louvre” is a bit out of context in that quote. His point is that crypto/blockchains allow for someone (or a group) to own the original(s) and everyone else to own copies that are as good as the original.\\n\\nAnd that is the kind of thing that could make owning digital frames really awesome.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1616753394,\"title\":\"Digital Art Frames - AVC\",\"publication\":\"avc\"},\"digest\":\"nAaod_y5j8lYr3XK91VMTfeIAn3yf4mkB95TZzXPBnE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LTl3aLSRol2QUVUD6CZDmgOh-_8_repOG-vj-b00m1o\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Q21DlwnMAzKTxzvSjREQR-eWtchCVIOEf9pQ8-_jbbs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"3dE-_L0_h2MGEbWUc2Rh_IEKIhdrd29OzLXkXV-1JsbvpfWJ2g16jK8PCkxnW4GydxnSnyza_yIglnniKxvb5w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa36ed4a1f484cc32e85a01be266ff07df93d7d551959ab6f44e5cb7aca49bba22841e81a419ff9150996b75ecf4a0a87eda7e1e79898e4f8e48a13744383f7451b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on avc.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LTl3aLSRol2QUVUD6CZDmgOh-_8_repOG-vj-b00m1o\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Q21DlwnMAzKTxzvSjREQR-eWtchCVIOEf9pQ8-_jbbs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"nAaod_y5j8lYr3XK91VMTfeIAn3yf4mkB95TZzXPBnE\"}"
