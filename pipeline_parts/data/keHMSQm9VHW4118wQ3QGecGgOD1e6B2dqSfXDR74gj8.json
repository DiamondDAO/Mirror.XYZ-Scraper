The reign of [Ahmad al-Mansur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_al-Mansur) brought new wealth and prestige to the Sultanate, and a large expedition to West Africa inflicted a crushing defeat on the [Songhay Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songhay_Empire) in 1591. However, managing the territories across the [Sahara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara) proved too difficult. After the death of al-Mansur, the country was divided among his sons.\\n\\nIn 1631, Morocco was reunited by the Alaouite dynasty, who have been the ruling house of Morocco ever since. Morocco was facing aggression from [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain) and the Ottoman Empire allies pressing westward. The Alaouites succeeded in stabilising their position, and while the kingdom was smaller than previous ones in the region, it remained quite wealthy.
