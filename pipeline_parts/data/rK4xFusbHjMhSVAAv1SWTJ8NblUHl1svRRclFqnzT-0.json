Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.`\\n\\n`Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you.`\\n\\n`Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.`\\n\\n`You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.`\\n\\n`You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.`\\n\\n`Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people.`\\n\\n`The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven't figured this out yet.`\\n\\n`Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.`\\n\\n`Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity.`\\n\\n`Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.`\\n\\n`Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.`\\n\\n`Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.`\\n\\n`Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you.`\\n\\n`Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.`\\n\\n`Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.`\\n\\n`When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools.`\\n\\n`Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.`\\n\\n`Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.`\\n\\n`The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon.`\\n\\n`“Give me a lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.” - Archimedes`\\n\\n`Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).`\\n\\n`Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability, and show resulting good judgment.`\\n\\n`Labor means people working for you. It's the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it.`\\n\\n`Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.`\\n\\n`Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.`\\n\\n`An army of robots is freely available - it's just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.`\\n\\n`If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.`\\n\\n`Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.`\\n\\n`Judgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.`\\n\\n`There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes.`\\n\\n                                                                    ----    All From Naval ***via Twitter(我愿称之为财富圣经）***\\n\\n***~~Seek Wealth, it’s yours.~~***\",\"timestamp\":1641800910,\"title\":\"1.10(the bible)\"},\"digest\":\"lXLmCKyy27LMcnW-tJXhIKfyn2-jttPGK_qs4irzKVE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xf23A9799FE0011ACB4326306a539B88644aC19A2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0NwSD_-boimZdr8tZHn2YcMC9JsUxGCO_5MM7A1xtys\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"aqD7sw1FXKYGQMtiGhfFI4fjWWi_VLPNsrlMLbuV2NE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Gj-hpENu0KjSFpe_x2PjyGeE-xeC139Mgbizcu6_08UCSoc_aC96GRaFIAGAXKjABtvhPd4l6nMLGxFnIGDF0w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa20c441603f2c95aced58cf02f53891e0db36f8bc70e236a7406b567d543422645fee41d78ef153bf4079767b9261af34a2999bc9bae26c939e79ab76d9bec821b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0NwSD_-boimZdr8tZHn2YcMC9JsUxGCO_5MM7A1xtys\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"aqD7sw1FXKYGQMtiGhfFI4fjWWi_VLPNsrlMLbuV2NE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"lXLmCKyy27LMcnW-tJXhIKfyn2-jttPGK_qs4irzKVE\"}"
