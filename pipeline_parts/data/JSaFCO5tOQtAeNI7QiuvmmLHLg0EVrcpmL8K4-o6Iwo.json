"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"There are two ways to supply props in games or metaverse: \\n\\nOne is an unlimited supply, which is also the mode of traditional game props. For example, a virtual hat are developed in 2020, and many novice players may buy one. If it is an ordinary game item and the user only has permission to use it, it will not be able to reflect when the hat was manufactured, although It can be checked theoretically it is very troublesome. \\n\\nThe other is in the form of NFT, even if it is ERC1155. For example, if 10,000 tops are issued at a time, its raw data is stored in the NFT, which is like the clothes tag and washing label. Then it will form an in game fashion and fast-moving consumer industry, the clothes of 2020 may be out of date in 2021. Players need to replace them. Second-hand clothes can be sold at a discount. Of course, players with design skills can design their own clothes. \\n\\nThis also requires game creators to continue to provide creativity and even open APIs to allow users to participate in creating, such as user-customized clothing, etc, and even spawn a  clothing company in the game. This clothing company can serve multiple game platforms. Game clothing can be converted to formats supported by different games. If the game developer is lazy and does not introduce the old and bring forth the new, it is easy to be discovered, because the information of each item is stored on-chain which is a piece of public history.\",\"timestamp\":1641146866,\"title\":\"Capsule（12.7.2021）NFT Carries a Piece of History: the Clothing Industry in Games\"},\"digest\":\"nHujFtRSH3MwZnvgruHC6tFoUJWxMo9yCHmUtNGXC2k\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xE828f8bE1a3CB994133936fB4D9A708a7D192462\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cWndKezD0ZiMgnYOqspWtyALlI_KYDziYOZaOerHeCY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Kf7VHolS02uUcQvJnvpP7ci_9wxCwvj1KsxIdy1wyS4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"hddueuLxBbKK09tIxBBn-gcHGzPPI7Te9e9oWAylB8LumEoV9W2iV9bC8k7abAr1OOpntSiYxN8cBRXcIuKIdA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x24845bd906a3dcd3a6a2c8def0e1867a94aa37e04d35018a13b94099ae5be24d4b1abdd27984d765963fd65aa852fe7e1dc6d3934335a6e14328e5bca1565db21b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cWndKezD0ZiMgnYOqspWtyALlI_KYDziYOZaOerHeCY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Kf7VHolS02uUcQvJnvpP7ci_9wxCwvj1KsxIdy1wyS4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"nHujFtRSH3MwZnvgruHC6tFoUJWxMo9yCHmUtNGXC2k\"}"
