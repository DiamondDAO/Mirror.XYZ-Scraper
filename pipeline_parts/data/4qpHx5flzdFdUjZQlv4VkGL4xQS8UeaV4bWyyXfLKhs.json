A good boss does not need to tell others what to do every day, because even\\n\\n10 A small company with a few people has a lot of things, such as personnel, marketing, product, and design. Even if you are very smart, you can't master all these parts. If you are not good at mobilizing other people's brains to take the initiative Work, you only know to work with your own brain, then, at best, you are the life of a project manager.\\n\\nWhen the company is getting bigger and bigger, for example, there are 200 people, it will be more difficult for you to arrange what each person needs to do. Therefore, a truly competent boss only does one thing, which is to publicize the company’s vision, let employees understand the company’s vision, tell them where we want to go, and then provide them with support to reach the goal. The rest is up to Employees do it themselves. A great boss, from the very beginning, he must do a good job in this kind of cultural construction, otherwise it will be difficult to make corrections when it grows into a crooked neck tree.\\n\\nDon't interfere with the work of team members, don't interfere with everything. From the beginning, we must cultivate their ability to complete their work independently. Only when everyone has deviated from the company's goals, should I remind them. This is called “ruling by doing nothing”. This is how I currently manage the team. It is very worry-free and happy.\",\"timestamp\":1634797599,\"title\":\"The invisible leader-the highest state of the boss\"},\"digest\":\"9sfTokffsXKIREO3rl_oM07S8-1VbTLz_ENxm6lg674\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"wh7Y54b3DD7_2x4cafIjCkJ0J2wu8vYkKZ4ouVaFQ8CAcjPPPOct5Pr_wmwI0SlG_THfGs1EZe30NFu6wClp6Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"9sfTokffsXKIREO3rl_oM07S8-1VbTLz_ENxm6lg674\"}"
