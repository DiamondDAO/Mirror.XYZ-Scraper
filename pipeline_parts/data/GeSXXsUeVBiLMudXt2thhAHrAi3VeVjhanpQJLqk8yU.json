"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The stock and crypto markets have started off the year in selloff mode, with the Nasdaq down almost 5% this week and the big crypto assets down almost 10% this week. But this selloff has been going on for a lot longer than one week. It has been going on since early November when the Nasdaq peaked at $16k and BTC hit $67k. Since then it’s been downhill and the biggest carnage has been in the highflying “cloud” stocks. The Gotham Gal and I own a few stocks that have been cut in half in the last two months. Yes, they lost half of their value in the last two months.\\n\\nOf course, these highflying stocks have only given up some of their gains over the last two years. In the case of a few of our public stock holdings, they went up 10x in the last two years and are now “only” up 5x. Easy come, easy go.\\n\\nEven at these new “discount” prices, none of these stocks look cheap to me. Most are still trading well in excess of 10x revenues which has always been my baseline for a subscription-based software business. I don’t know where they will bottom out, but it certainly could be lower. Or the sector could have already bottomed out in this first week of 2022 blowout sale. One never knows where the bottom is until you are well on your way back up.\\n\\nThe capital markets have been awash in money for the entire pandemic and it has resulted in some crazy prices being paid for public stocks and for growth rounds in high-performing privately held companies. The optimist in me sees this selloff as a return to normalcy, in the capital markets and in the world we live in. It’s hard to see a return to normalcy when offices remain closed, events are being postponed or moving to virtual. But markets tend to see things first and I do wonder if the capital markets are coming back to earth in anticipation of things getting better this year.\\n\\nIt also makes me wonder if the “pay any price” mentality in venture may ease up a bit this year. When the IPO markets or the M\\\\&A markets can’t/won’t be able to pay more for a business than the private markets are paying, that’s unsustainable. It can last a few quarters, maybe even a year. It can’t last forever. We will see.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1641481754,\"title\":\"The Selloff\",\"publication\":\"avc\"},\"digest\":\"iBr-LHmlW4Nvt4WVzU83ryWv0Q-BSsotP0lGrkm7KRw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fWJJHZczFLTl0i3oWUS-1xh8NIEeK3DwHVkkGuRQqb4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"lHd08KiYmW0Azh5BGQLuuYopRgwfhR1_t_4QsO7w18M\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"jXz6uA0ZELZTeCVpb8XqN3-_ei75viuFlpUSXjqtMJTpupOFxgY8q27aKdtrpFkoBxgpYW2eKYQiuF7VPiUqvQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x34c724c7260612c1d9916dcf97b3c5a76fa8e19e6f8a85b568329f13bb61ffb073b99798cbc275062f8ed3cdcc3f567ee7c12630ae1d1927986607ad0997512f1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fWJJHZczFLTl0i3oWUS-1xh8NIEeK3DwHVkkGuRQqb4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"lHd08KiYmW0Azh5BGQLuuYopRgwfhR1_t_4QsO7w18M\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"iBr-LHmlW4Nvt4WVzU83ryWv0Q-BSsotP0lGrkm7KRw\"}"
