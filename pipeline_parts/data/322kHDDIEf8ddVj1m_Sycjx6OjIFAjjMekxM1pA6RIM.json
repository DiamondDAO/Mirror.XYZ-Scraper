"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"and bringing him up to the log. He was very shy of Miss Laura, but Mr.\\nWood held him firmly, and let her stroke his head as much as she liked. \\\"You\\ncall him little,\\\" said Mr. Wood; \\\"if you put your arm around him, you'll find\\nhe's a pretty: substantial lamb. He was born in March. This is the last of July;\\nhe'll be shorn the middle of next month, and think he's quite grown up. Poor\\nlittle animal! he had quite a struggle for life. The sheep were turned out to\\npasture in April. They can't bear confinement as well as the cows, and as they\\nbite closer they can be turned out earlier, and get on well by having good\\nrations of corn in addition to the grass, which is thin and poor so early in the\\nspring. This young creature was running by his mother's side, rather a weak-\\nlegged, poor specimen of a lamb. Every night the flock was put under shelter,\\nfor the ground was cold, and though the sheep might not suffer from lying out-\\ndoors, the lambs would get chilled. One night this fellow's mother got astray,\\nand as Ben neglected to make the count, she wasn't missed. I'm always anxious\\nabout my lambs in the spring and often get up in the night to look after them.\\nThat night I went out about two o'clock. I took it into my head, for some reason\\nor other, to count them. I found a sheep and lamb missing, took my lantern and\\nBruno, who was some good at tracking sheep, and started out. Bruno barked and I\\ncalled, and the foolish creature came to me, the little lamb staggering after\\nher. I wrapped the lamb in my coat, took it to the house, made a fire, and\\nheated some milk. Your Aunt Hattie heard me and got up. She won't let me give\\nbrandy even to a dumb beast, so I put some ground sugar, which is just as good,\\nin the milk, and forced it down the lamb's throat. Then we wrapped an old\\nblanket round him, and put him near the stove, and the next evening he was ready\\nto go back to his mother. I petted him all through April, and gave him extras\\ndifferent kinds of meal, till I found what suited him best; now he does me\\ncredit.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dear little lamb,\\\" said Miss Laura, patting him, \\\"How can you tell him from the\\nothers, uncle?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know all their faces, Laura. A flock of sheep is just like a crowd of people.\\nThey all have different expressions, and have different dispositions.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They all look alike to me,\\\" said Miss Laura.\\n\\n\\\"I dare say. You are not accustomed to them. Do you know how to tell a sheep's\\nage?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, uncle.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Here, open your mouth, Cosset,\\\" he said to the lamb that he still held. \\\"At one\\nyear they have two teeth in the centre of the jaw. They get two teeth more every\\nyear up to five years. Then we say they have 'a full mouth.' After that you\\ncan't tell their age exactly by the teeth. Now, run back to your mother,\\\" and he\\nlet the lamb go.\\n\\n\\\"Do they always know their own mothers?\\\" asked Miss Laura.\\n\\n\\\"Usually. Sometimes a ewe will not own her lamb. In that case we tie them up in\\na separate stall till she recognizes it. Do you see that sheep over there by the\\nblueberry bushes the one with the very pointed ears?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, uncle,\\\" said Miss Laura.\\n\\n\\\"That lamb by her side is not her own. Hers died and we took its fleece and\\nwrapped it around a twin lamb that we took from another ewe, and gave to her.\\nShe soon adopted it. Now, come this way, and I'll show you our movable feeding\\ntroughs.\\\"\\n\\nHe got up from the log, and Miss Laura followed him to the fence. \\\"These big\\ntroughs are for the sheep,\\\" said Mr. Wood, \\\"and these shallow ones in the\\nenclosure are for the lambs. See, there is just room enough for them to get\\nunder the fence. You should see the small creatures rush to them whenever we\\nappear with their oats, and wheat, or bran, or whatever we are going to give\\nthem. If they are going to the butcher, they get corn meal and oil meal.\\nWhatever it is, they eat it up clean. I don't believe in cramming animals. I\\nfeed them as much as is good for them, and not any more. Now, you go sit down\\nover there behind those bushes with Joe, and I'll attend to business.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Laura found a shady place, and I curled myself up beside her. We sat there\\na long time, but we did not get tired, for it was amusing to watch the sheep and\\nlambs. After a while, Mr. Wood came and sat down beside us. He talked some more\\nabout sheep-raising; then he said, \\\"You may stay here longer if you like, but I\\nmust get down to the house. The work must be done, if the weather is hot.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What are you going to do now?\\\" asked Miss Laura, jumping up.\\n\\n\\\"Oh! more sheep business. I've set out some young trees in the orchard, and\\nunless I get chicken wire around them, my sheep will be barking them for me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've seen them,\\\" said Miss Laura, \\\"standing up on their hind legs and nibbling\\nat the trees, taking off every shoot they can reach.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They don't hurt the old trees,\\\" said Mr. Wood; \\\"but the young ones have to be\\nprotected. It pays me to take care of my fruit trees, for I get a splendid crop\\nfrom them, thanks to the sheep.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good-bye, little lambs and dear old sheep,\\\" said Miss Laura, as her uncle\\nopened the gate for her to leave the pasture. \\\"I'll come and see you again some\\ntime. Now, you had better go down to the brook in the dingle and have a drink.\\nYou look hot in your warm coats.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You've mastered one detail of sheep-keeping,\\\" said Mr. Wood, as he slowly\\nwalked along beside his niece. \\\"To raise healthy sheep one must have pure water\\nwhere they can get to it whenever they like. Give them good water, good food,\\nand a variety of it, good quarters cool in summer, comfortable in winter, and\\nkeep them quiet, and you'll make them happy and make money on them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think I'd like sheep-raising,\\\" said Miss Laura; \\\"won't you have me for your\\nflock mistress, uncle?\\\"\\n\\nHe laughed, and said he thought not, for she would cry every time any of her\\ncharge were sent to the butcher.\\n\\nAfter this Miss Laura and I often went up to the pasture to see the sheep and\\nthe lambs. We used to get into a shady place where they could not see us, and\\nwatch them. One day I got a great surprise about the sheep. I had heard so much\\nabout their meekness that I never dreamed that they would fight; but it turned\\nout that they did, and they went about it in such a business-like way, that I\\ncould not help smiling at them. I suppose that like most other animals they had\\na spice of wickedness in them. On this day a quarrel arose between two sheep;\\nbut instead of running at each other like two dogs they went a long distance\\napart, and then came rushing at each other with lowered heads. Their object\\nseemed to be to break each other's skull; but Miss Laura soon stopped them by\\ncalling out and frightening them apart. I thought that the lambs were more\\ninteresting than the sheep. Sometimes they fed quietly by their mothers' sides,\\nand at other times they all huddled together on the top of some flat rock or in\\na bare place, and seemed to be talking to each other with their heads close\\ntogether. Suddenly one would jump down, and start for the bushes or the other\\nside of the pasture. They would all follow pell-mell; then in a few minutes they\\nwould come rushing back again. It was pretty to see them playing together and\\nhaving a good time before the sorrowful day of their death came.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXX  A JEALOUS OX\\n\\nMR. WOOD had a dozen calves that he was raising, and Miss Laura sometimes went\\nup to the stable to see them. Each calf was in a crib, and it was fed with milk.\\nThey had gentle, patient faces, and beautiful eyes, and looked very meek, as\\nthey stood quietly gazing about them, or sucking away at their milk. They\\nreminded me of big, gentle dogs.\\n\\nI never got a very good look at them in their cribs, but one day when they were\\nold enough to be let out, I went up with Miss Laura to the yard where they were\\nkept. Such queer, ungainly, large-boned creatures they were, and such a good\\ntime they were having, running and jumping and throwing up their heels.\\n\\nMrs. Wood was with us, and she said that it was not good for calves to be\\nclosely penned after they got to be a few weeks old. They were better for\\ngetting out and having a frolic. She stood beside Miss Laura for a long time,\\nwatching the calves, and laughing a great deal at their awkward gambols. They\\nwanted to play, but they did not seem to know how to use their limbs.\\n\\nThey were lean calves, and Miss Laura asked her aunt why all the nice milk they\\nhad taken had not made them fat. \\\"The fat will come all in good time,\\\" said Mrs.\\nWood. \\\"A fat calf makes a poor cow, and a fat, small calf isn't profitable to\\nfit for sending to the butcher. It's better to have a bony one and fatten it. If\\nyou come here next summer, you'll see a fine show of young cattle, with fat\\nsides, and big, open horns, and a good coat of hair. Can you imagine,\\\" she went\\non, indignantly, \\\"that any one could be cruel enough to torture such a harmless\\ncreature as a calf?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, indeed,\\\" replied Miss Laura. \\\"Who has been doing it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who has been doing it?\\\" repeated Mrs. Wood, bitterly; \\\"they are doing it all\\nthe time. Do you know what makes the nice, white veal one gets in big cities?\\nThe calves are bled to death. They linger for hours, and moan their lives away.\\nThe first time I heard it, I was so angry that I cried for a day, and made John\\npromise that he'd never send another animal of his to a big city to be killed.\\nThat's why all of our stock goes to Hoytville, and small country places. Oh,\\nthose big cities are awful places, Laura. It seems to me that it makes people\\nwicked to huddle them together. I'd rather live in a desert than a city. There's\\nCh o. Every night since I've been there I pray to the Lord either to change the\\nhearts of some of the wicked people in it, or to destroy them off the face of\\nthe earth. You know three years ago I got run down, and your uncle said I'd got\\nto have a change, so he sent me off to my brother's in Ch o. I stayed and\\nenjoyed myself pretty well, for it is a wonderful city, till one day some\\nWestern men came in, who had been visiting the slaughter houses outside the\\ncity. I sat and listened to their talk, and it seemed to me that I was hearing\\nthe description of a great battle. These men were cattle dealers, and had been\\nsending stock to Ch o, and they were furious that men, in their rage for wealth,\\nwould so utterly ignore and trample on all decent and humane feelings as to\\ntorture animals as the Ch o men were doing.\\n\\n\\\"It is too dreadful to repeat the sights they saw. I listened till they were\\ndescribing Texan steers kicking in agony under the torture that was practised,\\nand then I gave a loud scream, and fainted dead away. They had to send for your\\nuncle, and he brought me home, and for days and days I heard nothing but\\nshouting and swearing, and saw animals dripping with blood, and crying and\\nmoaning in their anguish, and now, Laura, if you'd lay down a bit of Ch o meat,\\nand cover it with gold, I'd spurn it from me. But what am I saying? you're as\\nwhite as a sheet. Come and see the cow stable. John's just had it whitewashed.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Laura took her aunt's arm, and I walked slowly behind them. The cow stable\\nwas a long building, well-built, and with no chinks in the walls, as Jenkins's\\nstable had. There were large windows where the afternoon sun came streaming in,\\nand a number of ventilators, and a great many stalls. A pipe of water ran\\nthrough the stalls from one end of the stable to the other. The floor was\\ncovered with sawdust and leaves, and the ceiling and tops of the walls were\\nwhitewashed. Mrs. Wood said that her husband would not have the walls a glare of\\nwhite right down to the floor, because he thought it injured the animals' eyes.\\nSo the lower parts of the walls were stained a dark, brown color.\\n\\nThere were doors at each end of the stable, and just now they stood open, and a\\ngentle breeze was blowing through, but Mrs. Wood said that when the cattle stood\\nin the stalls, both doors were never allowed to be open at the same time. Mr.\\nWood was most particular to have no drafts blowing upon his cattle. He would not\\nhave them chilled, and he would not have them overheated. One thing was as bad\\nas the other. And during the winter they were never allowed to drink icy water.\\nHe took the chill off the water for his cows, just as Mrs. Wood did for her\\nhens.\\n\\n\\\"You know, Laura,\\\" Mrs. Wood went on, \\\"that when cows are kept dry and warm,\\nthey eat less than when they are cold and wet. They are so warm-blooded that if\\nthey are cold, they have to eat a great deal to keep up the heat of their\\nbodies, so it pays better to house and feed them well. They like quiet, too. I\\nnever knew that till I married your uncle. On our farm, the boys always shouted\\nand screamed at the cows when they were driving them, and sometimes they made\\nthem run. They're never allowed to do that here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have noticed how quiet this farm seems,\\\" said Miss Laura. \\\"You have so many\\nmen about, and yet there is so little noise.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your uncle whistles a great deal,\\\" said Mrs. Wood. \\\"Have you noticed that? He\\nwhistles when he's about his work, and then he has a calling whistle that nearly\\nall of the animals know, and the men run when they hear it. You'd see every cow\\nin this stable turn its head, if he whistled in a certain way outside. He says\\nthat he got into the way of doing it when he was a boy and went for his father's\\ncows. He trained them so that he'd just stand in the pasture and whistle, and\\nthey'd come to him. I believe the first thing that inclined me to him was his\\nclear, happy whistle. I'd hear him from our house away down on the road, jogging\\nalong with his cart, or driving in his buggy. He says there is no need of\\nscreaming at any animal. It only frightens and angers them. They will mind much\\nbetter if you speak clearly and distinctly. He says there is only one thing an\\nanimal hates more than to be shouted at, and that's to be crept on to have a\\nperson sneak up to it and startle it. John says many a man is kicked, because he\\ncomes up to his horse like a thief. A startled animal's first instinct is to\\ndefend itself. A dog will spring at you, and a horse will let his heels fly.\\nJohn always speaks or whistles to let the stock know when he's approaching.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where is uncle this afternoon?\\\" asked Miss Laura.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, up to his eyes in hay. He's even got one of the oxen harnessed to a hay\\ncart.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I wonder whether it's Duke?\\\" said Miss Laura.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, it is. I saw the star on his forehead,\\\" replied Mrs. Wood.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know when I have laughed at anything as much as I did at him the other\\nday,\\\" said Miss Laura. \\\"Uncle asked me if I had ever heard of such a thing as a\\njealous ox, and I said no. He said, 'Come to the barnyard, and I'll show you\\none.' The oxen were both there, Duke with his broad face, and Bright so much\\nsharper and more intelligent looking. Duke was drinking at the trough there, and\\nuncle said: 'Just look at him. Isn't he a great, fat, self-satisfied creature,\\nand doesn't he look as if he thought the world owed him a living, and he ought\\nto get it?' Then he got the card and went up to Bright, and began scratching\\nhim. Duke lifted his head from the trough, and stared at uncle, who paid no\\nattention to him but went on carding Bright, and stroking and petting him. Duke\\nlooked so angry. He left the trough, and with the water dripping from his lips,\\nwent up to uncle, and gave him a push with his horns. Still uncle took no\\nnotice, and Duke almost pushed him over. Then uncle left off petting Bright, and\\nturned to him. He said Duke would have treated him roughly, if he hadn't. I\\nnever saw a creature look as satisfied as Duke did, when uncle began to card\\nhim. Bright didn't seem to care, and only gazed calmly at them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've seen Duke do that again and again,\\\" said Mrs. Wood. \\\"He's the most jealous\\nanimal that we have, and it makes him perfectly miserable to have your uncle pay\\nattention to any animal but him. What queer creatures these dumb brutes are.\\nThey're pretty much like us in most ways. They're jealous and resentful, and\\nthey can love or hate equally well and forgive, too, for that matter; and suffer\\nhow they can suffer, and so patiently, too. Where is the human being that would\\nput up with the tortures that animals endure and yet come out so patient?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nowhere,\\\" said Miss Laura, in a low voice \\\"we couldn't do it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And there doesn't seem to be an animal,\\\" Mrs. Wood went on, \\\"no matter how ugly\\nand repulsive it is, but what has some lovable qualities. I have just been\\nreading about some sewer rats, Louise Michel's rats \\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who is she?\\\" asked Miss Laura.\\n\\n\\\"A celebrated Frenchwoman, my dear child, 'the priestess of pity and vengeance,'\\nMr. Stead calls her. You are too young to know about her but I remember reading\\nof her in 1872, during the Commune troubles in France. She is an anarchist, and\\nshe used to wear a uniform, and shoulder a rifle, and help to build barricades.\\nShe was arrested and sent as a convict to one of the French penal colonies. She\\nhas a most wonderful love for animals in her heart, and when she went home she\\ntook four cats with her. She was put into prison again in France and took the\\ncats with her. Rats came about her cell and she petted them and taught her cats\\nto be kind to them. Before she got the cats thoroughly drilled one of them bit a\\nrat's paw. Louise nursed the rat till it got well, then let it down by a string\\nfrom her window. It went back to its sewer, and, I suppose, told the other rats\\nhow kind Louise had been to it, for after that they came to her cell without\\nfear. Mother rats brought their young ones and placed them at her feet, as if to\\nask her protection for them. The most remarkable thing about them was their\\naffection for each other. Young rats would chew the crusts thrown to old\\ntoothless rats, so that they might more easily eat them, and if a young rat\\ndared help itself before an old one, the others punished it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That sounds very interesting, auntie,\\\" said Miss Laura. \\\"Where did you read\\nit?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have just got the magazine,\\\" said Mrs. Wood; \\\"you shall have it as soon as\\nyou come into the house.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I love to be with you, dear auntie,\\\" said Miss Laura, putting her arm\\naffectionately around her, as they stood in the doorway; \\\"because you understand\\nme when I talk about animals. I can't explain it,\\\" went on my dear young\\nmistress, laying her hand on her heart, \\\"the feeling I have here for them. I\\njust love a dumb creature, and I want to stop and talk to every one I see.\\nSometimes I worry poor Bessie Drury, and I'm so sorry, but I can't help it. She\\nsays, \\\"What makes you so silly, Laura?\\\"\\n\\nMiss Laura was standing just where the sunlight shone through her light-brown\\nhair, and made her face all in a glow. I thought she looked more beautiful than\\nI had ever seen her before, and I think Mrs. Wood thought the same. She turned\\naround and put both hands on Miss Laura's shoulders. \\\"Laura,\\\" she said,\\nearnestly, \\\"there are enough cold hearts in the world. Don't you ever stifle a\\nwarm or tender feeling toward a dumb creature. That is your chief attraction, my\\nchild: your love for everything that breathes and moves. Tear out the\\nselfishness from your heart, if there is any there, but let the love and pity\\nstay. And now let me talk a little more to you about the cows. I want to\\ninterest you in dairy matters. This stable is new since you were here, and we've\\nmade a number of improvements. Do you see those bits of rock salt in each stall?\\nThey are for the cows to lick whenever they want to. Now, come here, and I'll\\nshow you what we call 'The Black Hole.'\\\"\\n\\nIt was a tiny stable off the main one, and it was very dark and cool. \\\"Is this a\\nplace of punishment?\\\" asked Miss Laura, in surprise.\\n\\nMrs. Wood laughed heartily. \\\"No, no; a place of pleasure. Sometimes when the\\nflies are very bad and the cows are brought into the yard to be milked and a\\nfresh swarm settles on them, they are nearly frantic; and though they are the\\nbest cows in New Hampshire, they will kick a little. When they do, those that\\nare the worst are brought in here to be milked where there are no flies. The\\nothers have big strips of cotton laid over their backs and tied under them, and\\nthe men brush their legs with tansy tea, or water with a little carbolic acid in\\nit. That keeps the flies away, and the cows know just as well that it is done\\nfor their comfort, and stand quietly till the milking is over. I must ask John\\nto have their nightdresses put on sometimes for you to see. Harry calls them\\n'sheeted ghosts,' and they do look queer enough sending all round the barnyard\\nrobed in white.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXI  IN THE COW STABLE\\n\\n\\\"ISN'T it a strange thing,\\\" said Miss Laura, \\\"that a little thing like a fly,\\ncan cause so much annoyance to animals as well to people? Sometimes when I am\\ntrying to get more sleep in the morning, their little feet tickle me so that I\\nam nearly frantic and have to fly out of bed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You shall have some netting to put over your bed,\\\" said Mrs. Wood; \\\"but\\nsuppose, Laura, you had no hands to brush away the flies. Suppose your whole\\nbody was covered with them; and you were tied up somewhere and could not get\\nloose. I can't imagine more exquisite torture myself. Last summer the flies here\\nwere dreadful. It seems to me that they are getting worse and worse every year,\\nand worry the animals more. I believe it is because the birds are getting\\nthinned out all over the country. There are not enough of them to catch the\\nflies. John says that the next improvements we make on the farm are to be wire\\ngauze at all the stable windows and screen doers to keep the little pests from\\nthe horses and cattle.\\n\\n\\\"One afternoon last summer, Mr. Maxwell's mother came for me to go for a drive\\nwith her. The heat was intense, and when we got down by the river, she proposed\\ngetting out of the phaeton and sitting under the trees, to see if it would be\\nany cooler. She was driving a horse that she had got from the hotel in the\\nvillage, a roan horse that was clipped, and check-reined, and had his tail\\ndocked. I wouldn't drive behind a tailless horse now. Then, I wasn't so\\nparticular. However, I made her unfasten the check-rein before I'd set foot in\\nthe carriage. Well, I thought that horse would go mad. He'd tremble and shiver\\nand look go pitifully at us. The flies were nearly eating him up. Then he'd\\nstart a little. Mrs. Maxwell had a weight at his head to hold him, but he could\\neasily have dragged that. He was a good dispositioned horse, and he didn't want\\nto run away, but he could not stand still. I soon jumped up and slapped him, and\\nrubbed him till my hands were dripping wet. The poor brute was so grateful and\\nwould keep touching my arm with his nose. Mrs. Maxwell sat under the trees\\nfanning herself and laughing at me, but I didn't care. How could I enjoy myself\\nwith a dumb creature writhing in pain before me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A docked horse can neither eat nor sleep comfortably in the fly season. In one\\nof our New England villages they have a sign up, 'Horses taken in to grass. Long\\ntails, one dollar and fifty cents. Short tails, one dollar.' And it just means\\nthat the short-tailed ones are taken on cheaper, because they are so bothered by\\nthe flies that they can't eat much, while the long-tailed ones are able to brush\\nthem away and eat in peace. I read the other day of a Buffalo coal dealer's\\nhorse that was in such an agony through flies, that he committed suicide. You\\nknow animals will do that. I've read of horses and dogs drowning themselves.\\nThis horse had been clipped and his tail was docked, and he was turned out to\\ngraze. The flies stung him till he was nearly crazy. He ran up to a picket\\nfence, and sprang up on the sharp spikes. There he hung, making no effort to get\\ndown. Some men saw him, and they said it was a clear case of suicide.\\n\\n\\\"I would like to have the power to take every man who cuts off a horse's tail,\\nand tie his hands, and turn him out in a field in the hot sun, with little\\nclothing on, and plenty of flies about. Then we would see if he wouldn't\\nsympathize with the poor, dumb beast. It's the most senseless thing in the\\nworld, this docking fashion. They've a few flimsy arguments about a horse with a\\ndocked tail being stronger-backed, like a short-tailed sheep, but I don't\\nbelieve a word of it. The horse was made strong enough to do the work he's got\\nto do, and man can't improve on him. Docking is a cruel, wicked thing. Now,\\nthere's a ghost of an argument in favor of check-reins, on certain occasions. A\\nfiery, young horse can't run away, with an overdrawn check, and in speeding\\nhorses a tight check-rein will make them hold their heads up, and keep them from\\nchoking. But I don't believe in raising colts in a way to make them fiery, and I\\nwish there wasn't a race horse on the face of the earth, so if it depended race\\non me, every kind of check-rein would go. It's pity we women can't vote, Laura.\\nWe'd do away with a good many abuses.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Laura smiled, but it was a very faint, almost an unhappy smile, and Mrs.\\nWood said hastily, \\\"Let us talk about something else. Did you ever hear that\\ncows will give less milk on a dark day than on a bright one?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No; I never did,\\\" said Miss Laura.\\n\\n\\\"Well, they do. They are most sensitive animals. One finds out all manner of\\nthings about animals if he makes a study of them. Cows are wonderful creatures,\\nI think, and so grateful for good usage that they return every scrap of care\\ngiven them, with interest. Have you ever heard anything about dehorning, Laura?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not much, auntie. Does uncle approve?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, indeed. He'd just as soon think of cutting their tails off, as of dehorning\\nthem. He says he guesses the Creator knew how to make a cow better than he does.\\nSometimes I tell John that his argument doesn't hold good for a man in some ways\\ncan improve on nature. In the natural course of things, a cow would be feeding\\nher calf for half a year, but we take it away from her, raise it as well as she\\ncould and get an extra quantity of milk from her in addition. I don't know what\\nto think myself about dehorning. Mr. Windham's cattle are all polled, and he has\\nan open space in his barn for them, instead of keeping them in stalls, and he\\nsays they're more comfortable and not so confined. I suppose in sending cattle\\nto sea, it's necessary to take their horns off, but when they're going to be\\nturned out to grass, it seems like mutilating them. Our cows couldn't keep the\\ndogs away from the sheep if they didn't have their horns. Their horns are their\\nmeans of defense.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do your cattle stand in these stalls all winter?\\\" asked Miss Laura.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes, except when they're turned out in the barnyard, and then John usually\\nhas to send a man to keep them moving or they'd take cold. Sometimes on very\\nfine days they get out all day. You know cows aren't like horses. John says\\nthey're like great milk machines. You've got to keep them quiet, only exercising\\nenough to keep them in health. If a cow is hurried or worried or chilled or\\nheated, it stops her milk yield. And bad usage poisons it. John says you can't\\ntake a stick and strike a cow across the back, without her milk being that much\\nworse, and as for drinking the milk that comes from a cow that isn't kept clean,\\nyou'd better throw it away and drink water. When I was in Chicago, my sister-in-\\nlaw kept complaining to her milkman about what she called the 'cowy' smell to\\nher milk. 'It's the animal odor, ma'am,' he said, 'and it can't be helped. All\\nmilk smells like that.' 'It's dirt,' I said, when she asked my opinion about it.\\n'I'll wager my best bonnet that that man's cows are kept dirty. Their skins are\\nplastered up with filth and as the poison in them can't escape that way, it's\\ncoming out through the milk, and you're helping to dispose of it.' She was\\nastonished to hear this, and she got her milkman's address, and one day dropped\\nin upon him. She said that this cows were standing in a stable that was\\ncomparatively clean, but that their bodies were in just the state that I\\ndescribed them as living in. She advised the man to card and brush his cows\\nevery day, and said that he need bring her no more milk.\\n\\n\\\"That shows how you city people are imposed upon with regard to your milk. I\\nshould think you'd be poisoned with the treatment your cows receive; and even\\nwhen your milk is examined you can't tell whether it is pure or not. In New York\\nthe law only requires thirteen per cent. of solids in milk.
