What is all this?\\n\\nTheEnigmaDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO for short) and The Enigma is a 555.55 carat black diamond, that is not only the largest fancy black natural colour diamond in the world, but in 2006 it was also named the largest cut diamond in the world by the Guinness Book of World Records.\\n\\nAnd TheEnigmaDAO is born.\\n\\n### That’s great, so what are you trying to do exactly?\\n\\nLong story short, TheEnigmaDAO intends to raise funds through crowdfunding on crypto/blockchain to purchase The Enigma. You can contribute by clicking [here](https://juicebox.money/#/p/theenigmadao).\\n\\n[Sotheby’s is auctioning the diamond](https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2022/the-enigma-555-55-carat-fancy-black-diamond) on 3 February 2022 • 14:00 GMT in London.\\n\\n### Why are you doing this?\\n\\nTheEnigmaDAO wants to honour the most hard-core members of the crypto community, the diamond hands. Without their strong belief, a lot of amazing things in the crypto space won’t be happening and we are grateful to them.\\n\\nThat’s why if we successfully purchase The Enigma, TheEnigmaDAO intends to hold private functions all over the world, exclusively for our contributors to hold this gem in their very own diamond hands.\\n\\nLiteral (💎,🤲)\\n\\n### Okay…How are you gonna buy that exactly?\\n\\nWe are going to raise our fund through [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money/#/p/theenigmadao), which is a website that uses smart contract protocols deployed on the Ethereum network. This might sound familiar, because this is exactly the same platform that ConstitutionDAO raised all of it’s 47 millions dollar funding to bid for a copy of the Constitution.\\n\\n### Where are the funds raised from the Juicebox going to be stored?\\n\\nWe are using a Gnosis Safe wallet that currently has 4 signers. The identities of the signers can be viewed on our [website](https://theenigmadao.com/). It will be a 3/4 multisig and currently is only going to be used to submit the funds to Sotheby’s, or return the funds to Juicebox for refunds should we lose. If we win, the funds will be used to cover any related expenses that arise.\\n\\n### Am I receiving ownership of The Enigma in exchange for my contribution?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nYou are receiving a governance token called $WAGBAD, which stands for\\n\\n> We’re All Gonna Buy A Diamond\\n\\nThe token does NOT represent fractionalized ownership.\\n\\nGovernance includes the ability to advise on where the The Enigma should be displayed, how it should be exhibited, and the mission and values of TheEnigmaDAO.\\n\\n### Interesting, will I get a say in any of this if I contribute?\\n\\nAbsolutely!!! That is the whole foundation of DAO, which is an organization managed by its people.\\n\\nWe will be closely communicating with our contributors, holding polls and voting sessions to decide the fate of The Enigma. If the majority of the contributors have other plans for The Enigma, whether it is placing it in a museum, throwing it into the sea (please don’t) or even sending it back to space, we will respect it.\\n\\n### So what’s gonna happen if you get outbid at the auction?\\n\\nHopefully that won’t happen. But in the case that it does, our current plan is to refund your entire original contribution (minus [gas fee](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/)\\\\*) through the Juicebox refund protocol.\\n\\nHowever, the community can vote to allocate the funds otherwise, for example use it to purchase another diamond or any significant valuables that the majority can agree on. Again, we will respect whatever the community wants.\\n\\n\\\\*Disclaimer: TheEnigmaDAO and us devs do not receive the gas fee. The gas fee is paid to the miners of the Ethereum blockchain who facilitates the transactions.\\n\\n### What’s the utility for $WAGBAD tokens after the auction?\\n\\nIf we succeed at purchasing The Enigma, our initial contributors (those who helped us raise the fund before the auction) will always get priority in future events and activities.\\n\\nFor example, when we launch the private functions for our token holders to hold The Enigma in their own diamond hands, we will verify if the wallet you hold is one of the wallets that contributed before the auction which will give you priority before other token holders who bought after the auction ended.\\n\\nIn addition, token holders who bought after the auction ended will have to purchase a set amount of tokens to even enter the venue. This amount will be decided by the community through voting.\\n\\nWe are also exploring making exclusive NFTs for our initial contributors that will be an additional access key to even more exclusive functions.\\n\\n### How much are you raising and how many tokens are minted?\\n\\nWe aim to raise at least 10 million USD to give us solid chance at winning the bidding. However, there will be no max cap and the funding will keep going when it surpasses 10 million USD.\\n\\nWe will be setting the $WAGBAD/Ethereum ratio to 1,000,000 $WAGBAD per 1 [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/chart). Meaning for every 1 Ethereum you contribute you will get 1,000,000 $WAGBAD tokens in return for you to claim.\\n\\nThe amount of tokens being minted will be determined by how much Ethereum we receive on Juicebox. For example if we are able to raise 5,000 Ethereum, there will be 5,000 x 1,000,000 = 5,000,000,000 $WAGBAD minted.\\n\\n### Is the team receiving any of the contributions or profiting off this in any way?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nNobody including the team will not be receiving or pre-minting any tokens. We will be contributing our own money and receiving the same amount of $WAGBAD/Ethereum when the DAO is publicly launched on Juicebox, just like everyone else.\\n\\nAll raised funds will be used for bidding at the auction and later any costs (e.g. maintenance, secure storage and transport, event functions etc) that arises.\\n\\nIf you would like to donate to the team (Below is NOT the TheEnigmaDAO Contribution Address!!!), you can do so by sending us crypto payments to the below addresses.\\n\\nETH: 0x77aD10313a7B902b327F28496fA553A61FD55555\\n\\n### Hold on a minute, Sotheby’s estimate The Enigma would only sell for around 6.8 million USD, why is there no fund raising cap?\\n\\nWe all know the ConstitutionDAO incident where a billionaire swooped in and outbid them. Originally, Sotheby’s estimated the Constitution will only sell for 15-20 million USD, it ended up selling for 43.2 million USD!\\n\\nTherefore we want to minimise the chance for history to repeat, hence why we are not setting a fund raising cap.\\n\\nBut don’t worry, if we are able to successfully win the bid at a lower price, we will refund everyone proportionally of the extra funds once we decided we have enough to cover future expenses.\\n\\n### So what now?\\n\\nWell, we would love for you to join our [community](https://discord.com/invite/szczBrHRmt) and [contribute](https://juicebox.money/#/p/theenigmadao) to help us secure The Enigma and let us deliver this gem into your diamond hands.\\n\\n## (💎,🤲)\",\"timestamp\":1642692664,\"title\":\"WAGBAD — We’re All Gonna Buy A Diamond (💎,🤲)\"},\"digest\":\"lENT6uVQvr36QD-LhGz5feUALSpLVVHb2uNebvvwWJk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x77aD10313a7B902b327F28496fA553A61FD55555\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"6hJvsIppXdJE6gYHtO10tVxhECFiyf6uTA7aCGXbnBw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"-HbF788Ag3O-2NLdqTLbNzTruqQie-itdDrjnm8BgJ4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"XNAdjcCExuHkS78jnZ1ZRNaZ72zBAJ_Px5knMz0N8pXxzf34rv1UOvHqYgVzhMcMa8EBPTNZz9sIEFbq78KOag\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2cbbeabf3e9f9874e5e26939a1f2af7641fc2c935acc5ebfffaeb53232402d161fdb868302f1d5bcd8b7d75570607fe80167702e0ad384d4bc8c1c0ea3c382c51b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"6hJvsIppXdJE6gYHtO10tVxhECFiyf6uTA7aCGXbnBw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"-HbF788Ag3O-2NLdqTLbNzTruqQie-itdDrjnm8BgJ4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"lENT6uVQvr36QD-LhGz5feUALSpLVVHb2uNebvvwWJk\"}"
