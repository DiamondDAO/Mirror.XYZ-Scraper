"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"In 1946, he was arrested. Malcolm Little was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the crimes he had committed. In his time in prison, he could have planned his next crime spree, he could have dedicated his time to be even a better criminal than he already was.\\n\\nBut what did he do? He started reading. To learn the English language, he literally copied every word in the dictionary, word by word. Every minute he was not in his bunk, he would be in the library, reading. And this is how Malcolm Little was transformed into Malcolm X.\\n\\nNow our lives may be a bit different, hopefully, none of us is in prison. But what we can learn from the story of Malcolm X, is how he decided to use time as a tool. As young adults, I imagine most of us don’t know or understand our purpose in life. We don’t know what we want to do with our lives, or which career we want to serve. And we are in sort of this unsure period about life where we literally don’t know what the future holds.\\n\\nAnd this is precisely the case with me, I am trying out a bunch of stuff, but I have no idea what I want to do with my life. But I certainly know what I don’t want to do. I don’t want my days to go by where I make no progress. I want to choose Alive time over Dead time, just as Malcolm X did. Instead of waiting for his prison days to be over, he actively tried to better himself.\\n\\nHe was trying to be ready for the world when he came out.\\n\\nAs Winston Churchill once said. “There comes in their life a special moment, when they are figuratively tapped on their shoulder and offered the chance to do a very special thing, unique to them and fitted to their talents. What a tragedy if that moment finds them unprepared or unqualified for what could have been their finest hour.”\\n\\nRead that line again, “what a tragedy if that moment finds them unprepared or unqualified”.\\n\\nAnd what we have to do is to reduce the chances of us being unprepared. Every day when we wake up, we have to prepare ourselves for our finest hour. We have to learn new skills, sharpen old ones so that when the time comes, we are ready\\n\\nEvery day we have to dedicate time towards making progress. We have to see every day as an opportunity for becoming a skilful and capable person.\\n\\nDoes not matter how big or small your dreams are, Everything has to start today.\\n\\nRome was not built in a day, But bricks were laid every hour, and that’s what we have to do.\\n\\nLay a brick, every single day. And one day, if you look up,You will see these bricks tuned into walls, walls into castles and castles into the city.But everything starts from a small action you take today.\\n\\nRemember, this moment is not the only thing that makes your life, but this is a moment in your life.\\n\\nLearn new things, explore new domains,So that when the time comes, you are ready.\\n\\nUntil next time,Pushkar SIngh\\n\\n* [How to be resilient and build your self worth](https://stoicpushkar.com/self-worth/)\\n* [How To Not Be happy: The Indian Herd Mentality](https://stoicpushkar.com/herd-mentality/)\\n* [Why Someone Needs To Crush You](https://stoicpushkar.com/crush-you/)\\n* [“How “trying” To Run 100k In 30 Days Changed My Perspective Towards Life.”](https://stoicpushkar.com/running-100/)\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n<!-- #post-## -->\\n\\n<!-- #comments -->\\n\\n<!-- #main -->\",\"timestamp\":1641045439,\"title\":\"Don’t know what to do with your life?
