'Yea, so fast and firm was it knit and compact together that, had it not been for the townsmen themselves, it could not have been shaken or broken down for ever.  For here lay the excellent wisdom of Him that builded Mansoul, that the walls could never be broken down nor hurt by the most mighty adverse potentate unless the townsmen gave their consent thereto.'  Now, what would the military engineers of Chatham and Paris and Berlin, who are now at their wits' end, not give for a secret like that!  A wall impregnable and insurmountable and not to be sapped or mined from the outside:  a wall that could only suffer hurt from the inside!  And then that wonderful wall was pierced from within with five magnificently answerable gates.  That is to say, the gates could neither be burst in nor any way forced from without.  'This famous town of Mansoul had five gates, in at which to come, out of which to go; and these were made likewise answerable to the walls; to wit, impregnable, and such as could never be opened or forced but by the will and leave of those within.  The names of the gates were these:  Ear-gate, Eye-gate, Mouth-gate; in short, 'the five senses,' as we say.\\n\\nIn the south of England, in the time of Edward the Confessor and after the battle of Hastings, there were five cities which had special immunities and peculiar privileges bestowed upon them, in recognition of the special dangers to which they were exposed and the eminent services they performed as facing the hostile shores of France.  Owing to their privileges and their position, the 'Cinque Ports' came to be cities of great strength, till, as time went on, they became a positive weakness rather than a strength to the land that lay behind them.  Privilege bred pride, and in their pride the Cinque Ports proclaimed wars and formed alliances on their own account:  piracies by sea and robberies by land were hatched within their walls; and it took centuries to reduce those pampered and arrogant ports to the safe and peaceful rank of ordinary English cities.  The Revolution of 1688 did something, and the Reform Bill of 1832 did more to make Dover and her insolent sisters like the other free and equal cities of England; but to this day there are remnants of public shows and pageantries left in those old towns sufficient to witness to the former privileges, power, and pride of the famous Cinque Ports.  Now, Mansoul, in like manner, has her cinque ports.  And the whole of the Holy War is one long and detailed history of how the five senses are clothed with such power as they possess; how they abuse and misuse their power; what disloyalty and despite they show to their sovereign; what conspiracies and depredations they enter into; what untold miseries they let in upon themselves and upon the land that lies behind them; what years and years of siege, legislation, and rule it takes to reduce our bodily senses, those proud and licentious gates, to their true and proper allegiance, and to make their possessors a people loyal and contented, law-abiding and happy.\\n\\nThe Apostle has a terrible passage to the Corinthians, in which he treats of the soul and the senses with tremendous and overwhelming power.  'Your bodies and your bodily members,' he argues, with crushing indignation, 'are not your own to do with them as you like.  Your bodies and your souls are both Christ's.  He has bought your body and your soul at an incalculable cost.  What! know ye not that your body is nothing less than the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, and ye are not any more your own? know ye not that your bodies are the very members of Christ?'  And then he says a thing so terrible that I tremble to transcribe it.  For a more terrible thing was never written.  'Shall I then,' filled with shame he demands, 'take the members of Christ and make them the members of an harlot?'  O God, have mercy on me!  I knew all the time that I was abusing and polluting myself, but I did not know, I did not think, I was never told that I was abusing and polluting Thy Son, Jesus Christ.  Oh, too awful thought.  And yet, stupid sinner that I am, I had often read that if any man defile the temple of God and the members of Christ, him shall God destroy.  O God, destroy me not as I see now that I deserve.  Spare me that I may cleanse and sanctify myself and the members of Christ in me, which I have so often embruted and defiled.  Assist me to summon up my imagination henceforth to my sanctification as Thine apostle has here taught me the way.  Let me henceforth look at my whole body in all its senses and in all its members, the most open and the most secret, as in reality no more my own.  Let me henceforth look at myself with Paul's deep and holy eyes.  Let me henceforth seat Christ, my Redeemer and my King, in the very throne of my heart, and then keep every gate of my body and every avenue of my mind as all not any more mine own but His.  Let me open my eye, and my ear, and my mouth, as if in all that I were opening Christ's eye and Christ's ear and Christ's mouth; and let me thrust in nothing on Him as He dwells within me that will make Him ashamed or angry, or that will defile and pollute Him.  That thought, O God, I feel that it will often arrest me in time to come in the very act of sin.  It will make me start back before I make Christ cruel or false, a wine-bibber, a glutton, or unclean.  I feel at this moment as if I shall yet come to ask Him at every meal, and at every other opportunity and temptation of every kind, what He would have and what He would do before I go on to take or to do anything myself. What a check, what a restraint, what an awful scrupulosity that will henceforth work in me!  But, through that, what a pure, blameless, noble, holy and heavenly life I shall then lead!  What bodily pains, diseases, premature decays; what mental remorses, what shames and scandals, what self-loathings and what self- disgusts, what cups bitterer to drink than blood, I shall then escape!  Yes, O Paul, I shall henceforth hold with thee that my body is the temple of Christ, and that I am not my own, but that I am bought with a transporting price, and can, therefore, do nothing less than glorify God in my body and in my spirit which are God's. 'This place,' says the Pauline author of the Holy War--'This place the King intended but for Himself alone, and not for another with Him.'\\n\\nBut, my brethren, lay this well, and as never before, to heart-- this, namely, that when you thus begin to keep any gate for Christ, your King and Captain and Better-self,--Ear-gate, or Eye-gate, or Mouth-gate, or any other gate--you will have taken up a task that shall have no end with you in this life.  Till you begin in dead earnest to watch your heart, and all the doors of your heart, as if you were watching Christ's heart for Him and all the doors of His heart, you will have no idea of the arduousness and the endurance, the sleeplessness and the self-denial, of the undertaking.\\n\\n'Mansoul!  Her wars seemed endless in her eyes; She's lost by one, becomes another's prize. Mansoul!  Her mighty wars, they did portend Her weal or woe and that world without end. Wherefore she must be more concern'd than they Whose fears begin and end the self-same day.'\\n\\n'We all thought one battle would decide it,' says Richard Baxter, writing about the Civil War.  'But we were all very much mistaken,' sardonically adds Carlyle.  Yes; and you will be very much mistaken too if you enter on the war with sin in your soul, in your senses and in your members, with powder and shot for one engagement only. When you enlist here, lay well to heart that it is for life.  There is no discharge in this war.  There are no ornamental old pensioners here.  It is a warfare for eternal life, and nothing will end it but the end of your evil days on earth.\\n\\nCHAPTER III--EAR-GATE\\n\\n'Take heed what ye hear.'--Our Lord in Mark. 'Take heed how you hear.'--Our Lord in Luke.\\n\\nThis famous town of Mansoul had five gates, in at which to come, out at which to go, and these were made likewise answerable to the walls--to wit, impregnable, and such as could never be opened nor forced but by the will and leave of those within.  'The names of the gates were these, Ear-gate, Eye-gate,' and so on.  Dr. George Wilson, who was once Professor of Technology in our University, took this suggestive passage out of the Holy War and made it the text of his famous lecture in the Philosophical Institution, and then he printed the passage on the fly-leaf of his delightful book The Five Gateways of Knowledge.  That is a book to read sometime, but this evening is to be spent with the master.\\n\\nFor, after all, no one can write at once so beautifully, so quaintly, so suggestively, and so evangelically as John Bunyan. 'The Lord Willbewill,' says John Bunyan, 'took special care that the gates should be secured with double guards, double bolts, and double locks and bars; and that Ear-gate especially might the better be looked to, for that was the gate in at which the King's forces sought most to enter.  The Lord Willbewill therefore made old Mr. Prejudice, an angry and ill-conditioned fellow, captain of the ward at that gate, and put under his power sixty men, called Deafmen; men advantageous for that service, forasmuch as they mattered no words of the captain nor of the soldiers.  And first the King's officers made their force more formidable against Ear- gate:  for they knew that unless they could penetrate that no good could be done upon the town.  This done, they put the rest of their men in their places; after which they gave out the word, which was, Ye must be born again!  And so the battle began.  Now, they in the town had planted upon the tower over Ear-gate two great guns, the one called High-mind and the other Heady.  Unto these two guns they trusted much; they were cast in the castle by Diabolus's ironfounder, whose name was Mr. Puff-up, and mischievous pieces they were.  They in the camp also did stoutly, for they saw that unless they could open Ear-gate it would be in vain to batter the wall.'  And so on, through many allegorical, and, if sometimes somewhat laboured, yet always eloquent, pungent, and heart-exposing pages.\\n\\nWith these for our text let us now take a rapid glance at what some of the more Bunyan-like passages in the prophets and the psalms say about the ear; how it is kept and how it is lost; how it is used and how it is abused.\\n\\n1. The Psalmist uses a very striking expression in the 94th Psalm when he is calling for justice, and is teaching God's providence over men.  'He that planted the ear,' the Psalmist exclaims, 'shall he not hear?'  And, considering his church and his day, that is not a bad remark of Cardinal Bellarmine on that psalm,--'the Psalmist's word planted,' says that able churchman, 'implies design, in that the ear was not spontaneously evolved by an act of vital force, but was independently created by God for a certain object, just as a tree, not of indigenous growth, is of set purpose planted in some new place by the hand of man.'  The same thing is said in Genesis, you remember, about the Garden of Eden,--the Lord planted it and put the man and the woman, whose ears he had just planted also, into the garden to dress it and keep it.  How they dressed the garden and kept it, and how they held the gate of their ear against him who squatted down before it with his innuendoes and his lies, we all know to our as yet unrepaired, though not always irreparable, cost.\\n2. One would almost think that the scornful apostle had the Garden of Eden in his eye when he speaks so bitterly to Timothy of a class of people who are cursed with 'itching ears.'  Eve's ears itched unappeasably for the devil's promised secret; and we have all inherited our first mother's miserable curiosity.  How eager, how restless, how importunate, we all are to hear that new thing that does not at all concern us; or only concerns us to our loss and our shame.  And the more forbidden that secret is to us, and the more full of inward evil to us--insane sinners that we are--the more determined we are to get at it.  Let any forbidden secret be in the keeping of some one within earshot of us and we will give him no rest till he has shared the evil thing with us.  Let any specially evil page be published in a newspaper, and we will take good care that that day's paper is not thrown into the waste-basket; we will hide it away, like a dog with a stolen bone, till we are able to dig it up and chew it dry in secret.  The devil has no need to blockade or besiege the gate of our ear if he has any of his good things to offer us.  The gate that can only be opened from within will open at once of itself if he or any of his newsmongers but squat down for a moment before it.  Shame on us, and on all of us, for our itching ears.\\n3. Isaiah speaks of some men in his day whose ears were 'heavy' and whose hearts were fat, and the Psalmist speaks of some men in his day whose ears were 'stopped' up altogether.  And there is not a better thing in Bunyan at his very best than that surly old churl called Prejudice, so ill-conditioned and so always on the edge of anger.  By the devil's plan of battle old Prejudice was appointed to be warder of Ear-gate, and to enable him to keep that gate for his master he had sixty deaf men put under him, men most advantageous for that post, forasmuch as it mattered not to them what Emmanuel and His officers said.  There could be no manner of doubt who composed that inimitable passage.  There is all the truth and all the humour and all the satire in Old Prejudice that our author has accustomed us to in his best pieces.  The common people always get the best literature along with the best religion in John Bunyan.  'They are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear, and which will not hearken to the voice of charmers charming never so wisely,' says the Psalmist, speaking about some bad men in his day. Now, I will not stand upon David's natural history here, but his moral and religious meaning is evident enough.  David is not concerned about adders and their ears, he is wholly taken up with us and our adder-like animosity against the truth.  Against what teacher, then; against what preacher; against what writer; against what doctrine, reproof, correction, has your churlish prejudice adder-like shut your ear?  Against what truth, human or divine, have you hitherto stopped up your ear like the Psalmist's serpent? To ask that boldly, honestly, and in the sight of God, at yourself to-night, would end in making you the lifelong friend of some preacher, some teacher, some soul-saving truth you have up till to- night been prejudiced against with the rooted prejudice and the sullen obstinacy of sixty deaf men.  O God, help us to lay aside all this adder-like antipathy at men and things, both in public and in private life.  Help us to give all men and all causes a fair field and no favour, but the field and the favour of an open and an honest mind, and a simple and a sincere heart.  He that hath ears, let him hear!\\n4. As we work our way through the various developments and vicissitudes of the Holy War we shall find Ear-gate in it and in ourselves passing through many unexpected experiences; now held by one side and now by another.  And we find the same succession of vicissitudes set forth in Holy Scripture.  If you pay any attention to what you read and hear, and then begin to ask yourselves fair in the face as to your own prejudices, prepossessions, animosities, and antipathies,--you will at once begin to reap your reward in having put into your possession what the Scriptures so often call an 'inclined' ear.  That is to say, an ear not only unstopped, not only unloaded, but actually prepared and predisposed to all manner of truth and goodness.  Around our city there are the remains, the still visible tracks, of roads that at one time took the country people into our city, but which are now stopped up and made wholly impassable.  There is no longer any road into Edinburgh that way. There are other roads still open, but they are very roundabout, and at best very up-hill.  And then there are other roads so smooth, and level, and broad, and well kept, that they are full of all kinds of traffic; in the centre carts and carriages crowd them, on the one side horses and their riders delight to display themselves, and on the other side pedestrians and perambulators enjoy the sun. And then there are still other roads with such a sweet and gentle incline upon them that it is a positive pleasure both to man and beast to set their foot upon them.  And so it is with the minds and the hearts of the men and the women who crowd these roads.  Just as the various roads are, so are the ears and the understandings, the affections and the inclinations of those who walk and ride and drive upon them.  Some of those men's ears are impassably stopped up by self-love, self-interest, party-spirit, anger, envy, and ill- will,--impenetrably stopped up against all the men and all the truths of earth and of heaven that would instruct, enlighten, convict or correct them.  Some men's minds, again, are not so much shut up as they are crooked, and warped, and narrow, and full of obstruction and opposition.  Whereas here and there, sometimes on horseback and sometimes on foot; sometimes a learned man walking out of the city to take the air, and sometimes an unlettered countryman coming into the city to make his market, will have his ear hospitably open to every good man he meets, to every good book he reads, to every good paper he buys at the street corner, and to every good speech, and report, and letter, and article he reads in it.  And how happy that man is, how happy his house is at home, and how happy he makes all those he but smiles to on his afternoon walk, and in all his walk along the roads of this life.  Never see an I incline' on a railway or on a driving or a walking road without saying on it before you leave it, 'I waited patiently for the Lord, and He inclined His ear unto me and heard my cry. Because He hath inclined His ear unto me, therefore will I call upon Him as long as I live.  Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with them that work iniquity. Incline my heart unto Thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.  I have inclined mine heart to perform Thy statutes alway, even unto the end.'\\n5. Shakespeare speaks in Richard the Second of 'the open ear of youth,' and it is a beautiful truth in a beautiful passage.  Young men, who are still young men, keep your ears open to all truth and to all duty and to all goodness, and shut your ears with an adder's determination against all that which ruined Richard--flattering sounds, reports of fashions, and lascivious metres.  'Our souls would only be gainers by the perfection of our bodies were they wisely dealt with,' says Professor Wilson in his Five Gateways. 'And for every human being we should aim at securing, so far as they can be attained, an eye as keen and piercing as that of the eagle; an ear as sensitive to the faintest sound as that of the hare; a nostril as far-scenting as that of the wild deer; a tongue as delicate as that of the butterfly; and a touch as acute as that of the spider.  No man ever was so endowed, and no man ever will be; but all men come infinitely short of what they should achieve were they to make their senses what they might be made.  The old have outlived their opportunity, and the diseased never had it; but the young, who have still an undimmed eye, an undulled ear, and a soft hand; an unblunted nostril, and a tongue which tastes with relish the plainest fare--the young can so cultivate their senses as to make the narrow ring, which for the old and the infirm encircles things sensible, widen for them into an almost limitless horizon.'\\n\\nTake heed what you hear, and take heed how you hear.\\n\\nCHAPTER IV--EYE-GATE\\n\\n'Mine eye affecteth mine heart.'--Jeremiah.\\n\\n'Think, in the first place,' says the eloquent author of the Five Gateways of Knowledge, 'how beautiful the human eye is.  The eyes of many of the lower animals are, doubtless, very beautiful.  You must all have admired the bold, fierce, bright eye of the eagle; the large, gentle, brown eye of the ox; the treacherous, green eye of the cat, waxing and waning like the moon; the pert eye of the sparrow; the sly eye of the fox; the peering little bead of black enamel in the mouse's head; the gem-like eye that redeems the toad from ugliness, and the intelligent, affectionate expression which looks out of the human-like eye of the horse and dog.  There are many other animals whose eyes are full of beauty, but there is a glory that excelleth in the eye of a man.  We realise this best when we gaze into the eyes of those we love.  It is their eyes we look at when we are near them, and it is their eyes we recall when we are far away from them.  The face is all but a blank without the eye; the eye seems to concentrate every feature in itself.  It is the eye that smiles, not the lips; it is the eye that listens, not the ear; it is the eye that frowns, not the brow; it is the eye that mourns, not the voice.  The eye sees what it brings the power to see.  How true is this!  The sailor on the look-out can see a ship where the landsman can see nothing.  The Esquimaux can distinguish a white fox among the white snow.  The astronomer can see a star in the sky where to others the blue expanse is unbroken. The shepherd can distinguish the face of every single sheep in his flock,' so Professor Wilson.  And then Dr. Gould tells us in his mystico-evolutionary, Behmen-and-Darwin book, The Meaning and the Method of Life--a book which those will read who can and ought-- that the eye is the most psychical, the most spiritual, the most useful, and the most valued and cherished of all the senses; after which he adds this wonderful and heart-affecting scientific fact, that in death by starvation, every particle of fat in the body is auto-digested except the cream-cushion of the eye-ball!  So true is it that the eye is the mistress, the queen, and the most precious, to Creator and creature alike, of all the five senses.\\n\\nNow, in the Holy War John Bunyan says a thing about the ear, as distinguished from the eye, that I cannot subscribe to in my own experience at any rate.  In describing the terrible war that raged round Ear-gate, and finally swept up through that gate and into the streets of the city, he says that the ear is the shortest and the surest road to the heart.  I confess I cannot think that to be the actual case.  I am certain that it is not so in my own case.  My eye is very much nearer my heart than my ear is.  My eye much sooner affects, and much more powerfully affects, my heart than my ear ever does.  Not only is my eye by very much the shortest road to my heart, but, like all other short roads, it is cram-full of all kinds of traffic when my ear stands altogether empty.  My eye is constantly crowded and choked with all kinds of commerce; whole hordes of immigrants and invaders trample one another down on the congested street that leads from my eye to my heart.  Speaking for myself, for one assault that is made on my heart through my ear there are a thousand assaults successfully made through my eye. Indeed, were my eye but stopped up; had I but obedience and courage and self-mortification enough to pluck both my eyes out, that would be half the cleansing and healing and holiness of my evil heart; or at least, the half of its corruption, rebellion, and abominable wickedness would henceforth be hidden from me.  I think I can see what led John Bunyan in his day and in this book to make that too strong statement about the ear as against the eye; but it is not like him to have let such an over-statement stand and continue in his corrected and carefully finished work.  The prophet Jeremiah, I feel satisfied, would not have subscribed to what is said in the Holy War in extenuation of the eye.  That heart-broken prophet does not say that it has been his ear that has made his head waters.  It is his eye, he says, that has so affected his heart.  The Prophet of the Captivity had all the Holy War potentially in his imagination when he penned that so suggestive sentence.  And the Latin poet of experience, the grown-up man's own poet, says somewhere that the things that enter by his eye seize and hold his heart much more swiftly and much more surely than those things that but enter by his ear.  I shall continue, then, to hold by my text, 'Mine eye affecteth mine heart.'\\n\\n1. Turning then, to the prophets and proverb-makers of Israel, and then to the New Testament for the true teaching on the eye, I come, in the first place, on that so pungent saying of Solomon that 'the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.'  Look at that born fool, says Solomon, who has his eyes and his heart committed to him to keep.  See him how he gapes and stares after everything that does not concern him, and lets the door of his own heart stand open to every entering thief.  London is a city of three million inhabitants, and they are mostly fools, Carlyle once said.  And let him in this city whose eyes keep at home cast the first stone at those foreign fools.  I will wager on their side that many of you here to-night know better what went on in Mashonaland last week than what went on in your own kitchen downstairs, or in your own nursery or schoolroom upstairs.  Some of you are ten times more taken up with the prospects of Her Majesty's Government this session, and with the plots of Her Majesty's Opposition, than you are with the prospects of the good and the evil, and the plots of God and the devil, all this winter in your own hearts.  You rise early, and make a fight to get the first of the newspaper; but when the minister comes in in the afternoon you blush because the housemaid has mislaid the Bible.  Did you ever read of the stargazer who fell into an open well at the street corner?  Like him, you may be a great astronomer, a great politician, a great theologian, a great defender of the faith even, and yet may be a stark fool just in keeping the doors and the windows of your own heart.  'You shall see a poor soul,' says Dr. Goodwin, 'mean in abilities of wit, or accomplishments of learning, who knows not how the world goes, nor upon what wheels its states turn, who yet knows more clearly and experimentally his own heart than all the learned men in the world know theirs.  And though the other may better discourse philosophically of the acts of the soul, yet this poor man sees more into the corruption of it than they all.'  And in another excellent place he says:  'Many who have leisure and parts to read much, instead of ballasting their hearts with divine truth, and building up their souls with its precious words, are much more versed in play-books, jeering pasquils, romances, and feigned staves, which are but apes and peacocks' feathers instead of pearls and precious stones.  Foreign and foolish discourses please their eyes and their ears; they are more chameleons than men, for they live on the east wind.'\\n2. 'If thine eye offend thee'--our Lord lays down this law to all those who would enter into life--'pluck it out and cast it from thee; for it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than, having two eyes, to be cast into hell-fire.'  Does your eye offend you, my brethren?  Does your eye cause you to stumble and fall, as it is in the etymology?  The right use of the eye is to keep you from stumbling and falling; but so perverted are the eye and the heart of every sinner that the city watchman has become a partaker with thieves, and our trusted guide and guardian a traitor and a knave.  If thine eye, therefore, offends thee; if it places a stone or a tree in thy way in a dark night; if it digs a deep ditch right across thy way home; if it in any way leads thee astray, or lets in upon thee thine enemies--then, surely, thou wert better to be without that eye altogether.  Pluck it out, then; or, what is still harder to go on all your days doing, pluck the evil thing out of it.  Shut up that book and put it away.  Throw that paper and that picture into the fire.  Cut off that companion, even if he were an adoring lover.  Refuse that entertainment and that amusement, though all the world were crowding upto it.  And soon, and soon, till you have plucked your eye as clean of temptations and snares as it is possible to be in this life.  For this life is full of that terrible but blessed law of our Lord.  The life of all His people, that is; and you are one of them, are you not?  You will know whether or no you are one of them just by the number of the beautiful things, and the sweet things, and the things to be desired, that you have plucked out of your eye at His advice and demand.  True religion, my brethren, on some sides of it, and at some stages of it, is a terribly severe and sore business; and unless it is proving a terribly severe and sore business to you, look out! lest, with your two hands and your two feet and your two eyes, you be cast, with all that your hands and feet and eyes have feasted on, into the everlasting fires!  Woe unto the world because of offences, but woe much more to that member and entrance-gate of the body by which the offence cometh!  Wherefore, if thine eye offend thee -!\\n3. 'Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.'  Now, if you wish both to preserve your eyes, and to escape the everlasting fires at the same time, attend to this text.  For this is almost as good as plucking out your two eyes; indeed, it is almost the very same thing.  Solomon shall speak to the man in this house to-night who has the most inflammable, the most ungovernable, and the most desperately wicked heart.  You, man, with that heart, you know that you cannot pass up the street without your eye becoming a perfect hell-gate of lust, of hate, of ill-will, of resentment and of revenge.  Your eye falls on a man, on a woman, on a house, on a shop, on a school, on a church, on a carriage, on a cart, on an innocent child's perambulator even; and, devil let loose that you are, your eye fills your heart on the spot with absolute hell-fire.  Your presence and your progress poison the very streets of the city. And that, not as the short-sighted and the vulgar will read Solomon's plain-spoken Scripture, with the poison of lewdness and uncleanness, but with the still more malignant, stealthy, and deadly poison of social, professional, political, and ecclesiastical hatred, resentment, and ill-will.  Whoredom and wine openly slay their thousands on all our streets; but envy and spite, dislike and hatred their ten thousands.  The fact is, we would never know how malignantly wicked our hearts are but for our eyes. But a sudden spark, a single flash through the eye falling on the gunpowder that fills our hearts, that lets us know a hundred times every day what at heart we are made of.  'Of a verity, O Lord, I am made of sin, and that my life maketh manifest,' prays Bishop Andrewes every day.  Why, sir, not to go to the street, the direction in which your eyes turn in this house this evening will make this house a very 'den,' as our Lord said--yes, a very den to you of temptation and transgression.  My son, let thine eyes look right on.  Ponder the path of thy feet, turn not to the right hand nor to the left--remove thy foot from all evil!\\n4. There is still another eye that is almost as good as an eye out altogether, and that is a Job's eye.  Job was the first author of that eye and all we who have that excellent eye take it of him.  'I have made a covenant with mine eyes,' said that extraordinary man-- that extraordinarily able, honest, exposed and exercised man.  Now, you must all know what a covenant is.  A covenant is a compact, a contract, an agreement, an engagement.  In a covenant two parties come to terms with one another.  The two covenanters strike hands, and solemnly engage themselves to one another:  I will do this for you if you will do that for me.  It is a bargain, says the other; let us have it sealed with wax and signed with pen and ink before two witnesses.  As, for instance, at the Lord's Table.  I swear, you say, over the Body and the Blood of the Son of God, I swear to make a covenant with mine eyes.  I will never let them read again that idle, infidel, scoffing, unclean sheet.  I will not let them look on any of my former images or imaginations of forbidden pleasures.  I swear, O Thou to whom the night shineth as the day, that I will never again say, Surely the darkness shall cover me! See if I do not henceforth by Thy grace keep my feet off every slippery street.  That, and many other things like that, was the way that Job made his so noble covenant with his eyes in his day and in his land.  And it was because he so made and so kept his covenant that God so boasted over him and said, Hast thou considered my servant Job?  And then, every covenant has its two sides.  The other side of Job's covenant, of which God Himself was the surety, you can read and think over in your solitary lodgings to-night.  Read Job xxxi. 1, and then Job xl. to the end, and then be sure you take covenant paper and ink to God before you sleep. And let all fashionable young ladies hear what Miss Rossetti expects for herself, and for all of her sex with her who shall subscribe her covenant.  'True,' she admits, 'all our life long we shall be bound to refrain our soul, and keep it low; but what then? For the books we now refrain to read we shall one day be endowed with wisdom and knowledge.  For the music we will not listen to we shall join in the song of the redeemed.  For the pictures from which we turn we shall gaze unabashed on the Beatific Vision.  For the companionship we shun we shall be welcomed into angelic society and the communion of triumphant saints.  For the amusements we avoid we shall keep the supreme jubilee.  For all the pleasures we miss we shall abide, and for evermore abide, in the rapture of heaven.'\\n5. And then there is the Pauline eye.  An eye, however, that Job would have shared with Paul and with the Corinthian Church had the patriarch been privileged to live in our New Testament day.  Ever since the Holy Ghost with His anointing oil fell on us at Pentecost, says the apostle, we have had an eye by means of which we look not at the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen.  Now, he who has an eye like that is above both plucking out his eyes or making a covenant with them either.  It is like what Paul says about the law also.  The law is not made for a righteous man.  A righteous man is above the law and independent of it.  The law does not reach to him and he is not hampered with it. And so it is with the man who has got Paul's splendid eyes for the unseen.  He does not need to touch so much as one of his eye-lashes to pluck them out.  For his eyes are blind, and his ears are deaf, and his whole body is dead to the things that are temporal.  His eyes are inwardly ablaze with the things that are eternal.  He whose eyes have been opened to the truth and the love of his Bible, he will gloat no more over your books and your papers filled with lies, and slander, and spite, and lewdness!  He who has his conversation in heaven does not need to set a watch on his lips lest he take up an ill report about his neighbour.  He who walks every day on the streets of gold will step as swiftly as may be, with girt loins, and with a preoccupied eye, out of the slippery and unsavoury streets of this forsaken earth.  He who has fast working out for him an exceeding and eternal weight of glory will easily count all his cups and all his crosses, and all the crooks in his lot but as so many light afflictions and but for a moment. My Lord Understanding had his palace built with high perspective towers on it, and the site of it was near to Eye-gate, from the top of which his lordship every day looked not at the things which are temporal, but at the things which are eternal, and down from his palace towers he every day descended to administer his heavenly office in the city.\\n\\nYour eye, then, is the shortest way into your heart.  Watch it well, therefore; suspect and challenge all outsiders who come near it.  Keep the passes that lead to your heart with all diligence. Let nothing contraband, let nothing that even looks suspicious, ever enter your hearts; for, if it once enters, and turns out to be evil, you will never get it all out again as long as you live. 'Death is come up into our windows,' says our prophet in another place, 'and is entered into our palaces, to cut off our children in our houses and our young men in our streets.'  Make a covenant, then, with your eyes.  Take an oath of your eyes as to which way they are henceforth to look.  For, let them look this way, and your heart is immediately full of lust, and hate, and envy, and ill- will.  On the other hand, lead them to look that way and your heart is as immediately full of truth and beauty, brotherly kindness and charity.  The light of the body is the eye; if, therefore, thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light; but if thine eye be evil, thy whole body is full of darkness.  If, therefore, the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!\\n\\nCHAPTER V--THE KING'S PALACE\\n\\n'The palace is not for man, but for the Lord God.'--David.\\n\\n'Now, there is in this gallant country a fair and delicate town, a corporation, called Mansoul:  a town for its building so curious, for its situation so commodious, for its privileges so advantageous, that I may say of it, there is not its equal under the whole heaven.  Also, there was reared up in the midst of this town a most famous and stately palace:  for strength, it might be called a castle; for pleasantness, a paradise; and for largeness, a place so copious as to contain all the world.  This place the King intended for Himself alone, and not for another with Him, so great was His delight in it.'  Thus far, our excellent allegorical author.  But there are other authors that treat of this great matter now in hand besides the allegorical authors.  You will hear tell sometimes about a class of authors called the Mystics.  Well, listen at this stage to one of them, and one of the best of them, on this present matter--the human heart, that is.  'Our heart,' he says, 'is our manner of existence, or the state in which we feel ourselves to be; it is an inward life, a vital sensibility, which contains our manner of feeling what and how we are; it is the state of our desires and tendencies, of inwardly seeing, tasting, relishing, and feeling that which passes within us; our heart is that to us inwardly with regard to ourselves which our senses of seeing, hearing, feeling, and such like are with regard to things that are without or external to us.  Your heart is the best and greatest gift of God to you.  It is the highest, greatest, strongest, and noblest power of your nature.  It forms your whole life, be it what it will.  All evil and all good come from your heart.  Your heart alone has the key of life and death for you.'  I was just about to ask you at this point which of our two authors, our allegorical or our mystical author upon the heart, you like best.  But that would be a stupid and a wayward question since you have them both before you, and both at their best, to possess and to enjoy.  To go back then to John Bunyan, and to his allegory of the human heart.\\n\\n1. To begin with, then, there was reared up in the midst of this town of Mansoul a most famous and stately palace.  And that palace and the town immediately around it were the mirror and the glory of all that its founder and maker had ever made.  His palace was his very top-piece.  It was the metropolitan of the whole world round about it; and it had positive commission and power to demand service and support of all around.  Yes.  And all that is literally, evidently, and actually true of the human heart.  For all other earthly things are created and upheld, are ordered and administered, with an eye to the human heart.  The human heart is the final cause, as our scholars would say, of absolutely all other earthly things.  Earth, air, water; light and heat; all the successively existing worlds, mineral, vegetable, animal, spiritual; grass, herbs, corn, fruit-trees, cattle and sheep, and all other living creatures; all are upheld for the use and the support of man.  And, then, all that is in man himself is in him for the end and the use of his heart.  All his bodily senses; all his bodily members; every fearfully and wonderfully made part of his body and of his mind; all administer to his heart.  She is the sovereign and sits supreme.  And she is worthy and is fully entitled so to sit.  For there is nothing on the earth greater or better than the heart, unless it is the Creator Himself, who planned and executed the heart for Himself and not for another with Him.  'The body exists,' says a philosophical biologist of our day, 'to furnish the cerebral centres with prepared food, just as the vegetable world, viewed biologically, exists to furnish the animal world with similar food.  The higher is the last formed, the most difficult, and the most complex; but it is just this that is most precious and significant--all of which shows His unrolling purpose. It is the last that alone explains all that went before, and it is the coming that will alone explain the present.  God before all, through all, foreseeing all, and still preparing all; God in all is profoundly evident.'  Yes, profoundly evident to profound minds, and experimentally and sweetly evident to religious minds, and to renewed and loving and holy hearts.\\n2. For fame and for state a palace, while for strength it might be called a castle.  In sufficiently ancient times the king's palace was always a castle also.  David's palace on Mount Zion was as much a military fortress as a royal residence; and King Priam's palace was the protection both of itself and of the whole of the country around.  In those wild times great men built their houses on high places, and then the weak and endangered people gathered around the strongholds of the powerful, as we see in our own city.  Our own steep and towering rock invited to its top the castle-builder of a remote age, and then the exposed country around began to gather itself together under the shelter of the bourg.  And thus it is that the military engineering of the Holy War makes that old allegorical book most excellent to read, not only for common men like you and me, who are bent on the fortification and the defence of our own hearts, but for the military historians of those old times also, for the experts of to-day also, and for all good students of fortification.  And the New Testament of the Divine peace itself, as well as the Old Testament so full of the wars of the Lord--they both support and serve as an encouragement and an example to our spiritual author in the elaboration of his military allegory.  Every good soldier of Jesus Christ has by heart the noble paradox of Paul to the Philippians--that the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep their hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.  Let God's peace, he says, be your man of war.  Let His surpassing peace do both the work of war and the work of peace also in your hearts and in your minds.  Let that peace both fortify with walls, and garrison with soldiers, and watch every gate, and hold every street and lane of your hearts and of your minds all around your hearts.  And all through the Prince of Peace, the Captain of all Holy War, Jesus Christ Himself.  No wonder, then, that in a strength--in a kind and in a degree of strength--that passeth all understanding, this stately palace of the heart is also here called a well-garrisoned castle.\",\"timestamp\":1641296463,\"title\":\"\\nAnd then, as for the wall of the city, hear our excellent historian's own words about that. \"},\"digest\":\"oC0tkJwfWkOsGAzSWm03PYuJUrK6X3rfCp681fd8Qe0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x025bE40F20d6f0f04d76fE7Ad916e5d61bc4D69f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"DAjc1XhCsadCYfZonMUyzpIX4vQHApAqf-QdXqhfztU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"GLoa-Kt6H82OLEijDq-yUGbYyjVH1QIl-SQ8OXHOVYA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"FG1HhLu5-0j2jDvfqFlLo5W-vDW8ZO2WxG1BviSShnEhZgdN9sfjeWpL1221wVXbLT71NtjzXnyKVBV4u8p3LA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xfaad670c48d69127487c5cca4f446c9007947e725fab423c477e472a79d7719a24e2a9c5645cb65bfed0f4ac95d36d062d9efccf14af3238f263d2909d1d502d1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"DAjc1XhCsadCYfZonMUyzpIX4vQHApAqf-QdXqhfztU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"GLoa-Kt6H82OLEijDq-yUGbYyjVH1QIl-SQ8OXHOVYA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"oC0tkJwfWkOsGAzSWm03PYuJUrK6X3rfCp681fd8Qe0\"}"
