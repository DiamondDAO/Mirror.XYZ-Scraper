[Propheta](https://www.instagram.com/__propheta__/) and I have been exploring the idea of an **[Economy of Sound](https://www.aquariantransmissions.com/practices/2020/1/27/economy-of-sound-convo-with-propheta-kym)** for some time. A lot of people would loOk confused when we said this and now, here we are, about to quite literally morph the music industry into a decentralized Economy (and Ecosystem) of Sound. (*Highly recommend listening to the below convo from 2018/2019*).\\n\\n[https://www.aquariantransmissions.com/practices/2020/1/27/economy-of-sound-convo-with-propheta-kym](https://www.aquariantransmissions.com/practices/2020/1/27/economy-of-sound-convo-with-propheta-kym)\\n\\nThis topic is major for me as DJ and sonic curator. Sharing music is like the air I breathe. To finally have the ability to track and value the sharing of music is important. VERY IMPORTANT. We are the #SonicCuration Generation after all. Being able to do this in a holistic way that supports and values the artists and the listeners is exciting AF!\\n\\nThe backend of the music industry is antiquated and has some catching up to do (to say the least). The very small percentage of royalties paid out to artists by centralized streaming services and record labels should not be the norm. For artists, these nexts moves will be determined by their autonomy and contractual obligations with their labels. This is the grey area and also why it is so important to remain independent and own your masters at this time, keep your **SONIC SOVEREIGNTY**!\\n\\nBecause finding new music, organizing it and sharing it is my specialty and I spend so much of my time and energy in this space, I‚Äôm reviewing the platforms I come across for alternative options I‚Äôve found in the world of **Decentralized Music Streaming Tools** (*which I will now refer to as **DMST,** not to be confused with DMT*). I‚Äôll be documenting this journey as I search for the next decentralized Spotify, Tidal or Apple Music, but way better. Some things I‚Äôll be looking for from these tools are\\n\\n### KYM√Ö‚Äôs W I S H L I S T:\\n\\n* Easy social sharing capabilities\\n* Direct access to uploading music to the platform by the artists themselves (no gatekeepers).\\n* Direct payouts and capabilities for writing your own smart contracts for split sheets with co-producers, song writers etc\\n* Merch marketplaces\\n* Listener rewards\\n* Social media capabilities (see what friends are listening to, clubhouse like listening rooms and conversations, Twitter space like talks and more in depth involvement around listening and socializing around the music).\\n* Innovative curation capabilities and playlisting features.\\n* AI auto-suggestions (not gonna lie, I‚Äôve stuck with Spotify for this long because of its on point recommendations).\\n* Capabilities to stream DJ mixes and podcasts in addition to music.\\n* Cross platform capabilities for tracking ‚Äúroyalties‚Äù of the music. Have this built into the initial upload through smart contracts - consulting with artists for best practices for making the proper contracts for this. Option for pay-outs + social tokens (this is touched on a bit re: copyright and onboarding artists into web3 in the podcast below).\\n* HiFi sound quality\\n* Free to use or nominal subscription that gets re-distributed into ecosystem/ DAO set up\\n\\n**NOW LISTENING TO:**\\n\\n[https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HXeyEEXm2CIvDkvUMxDBH?si=cb70be4bab284094](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HXeyEEXm2CIvDkvUMxDBH?si=cb70be4bab284094)\\n\\n**That‚Äôs a wrap... for now‚Ä¶**\\n\\nBecause we‚Äôve been conditioned to have access to enormous libraries of music immediately, there does need to be some context and patience in these beta spaces I realize. It also appears we are moving away from standardization which may or may not mean inconsistent sound quality (ie: Soundcloud - which did end up generating a new ‚ÄúLowFi‚Äù genre). It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that we are building this new world together from the ground up. What do we want it to look like and sound like? What terms are we taking into consideration in our smart contracts? If we are setting our own standards, how do we not sell ourselves short while coming together as a community to support each others creativity and generosity?\\n\\n@ me on Twitter and let me know what features you‚Äôd like to see in your DMST. Might just fuck around and make a crowdfund link for this too and find a team to develop myself‚Ä¶ Share your wishlist features, give me a little bit of time to set it up (is it just me or does it feel like everyone is rushing these days?) and I‚Äôll definitely press play on that idea!\\n\\n## Find your vibe‚Ä¶\\n\\n*Currently testing a variety of platforms and protocols. In the meantime, because I can‚Äôt NOT share music, I am posting my FR3QZ of the WEEK to the KYMX√Ö  \\\\*\\\\*[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHAtWr2yDRTES1ZCzOwPZjA) \\\\*\\\\* until I decide what the next move in this transition to web3 is going to be. It‚Äôs a whole new wide world web now and any DMST I subscribe to is going to be home for so much of what I do. I want to be thoughtful in my selections and have capabilities that allow easy sharing and onboarding for new users or members to the community while truly supporting all contributors in the ecosystem.*\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/kyma/status/1481694735567781888?s=20](https://twitter.com/kyma/status/1481694735567781888?s=20)\\n\\n((( üíó )))\\n\\nTwitter: [@](https://www.twitter.com/_kyma_)*[kyma](https://www.twitter.com/_kyma_) Insta: [@](https://www.instagram.com/_kyma_)*[kyma](https://www.instagram.com/_kyma_)\",\"timestamp\":1642103114,\"title\":\"Economy of Sound: what's the next .wav?\"},\"digest\":\"w8n9Mi2_9mV5aGS1uFIFZE7NAJk97ctn2UJuR47S0oE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd1348Edc181C989DC5abe4d6Aba9d20ECee176Ad\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PzTTpyQ3Ri9MjCb5WNKiDAuwANnwqxDyWNaQ39QmjLY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"aUeTTwYkjhTLzZLiBqvsEMDFj35-LmRn2bZK5XfBioE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"8jGKNVmakqxJJyxpDG7867xDI6bI2cmUz24y_6mUHTHDaQCl6bOWnSShQ9p6xC3r7KiuM__V1ZfkBaVPrGlHVQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xcff3d253af4a6ab9007dbe03bf4c294991007898f24c195136c723d73305dfaf4f1d815ad6dacb12b6aed98ed081cf2a3c10afdce54bd7591e60245d74502c3e1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PzTTpyQ3Ri9MjCb5WNKiDAuwANnwqxDyWNaQ39QmjLY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"aUeTTwYkjhTLzZLiBqvsEMDFj35-LmRn2bZK5XfBioE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"j8PSJEZqnt9ZlYvT5jJQlBZpImQtcpQ-iq2yVaKqlq0\"}"
