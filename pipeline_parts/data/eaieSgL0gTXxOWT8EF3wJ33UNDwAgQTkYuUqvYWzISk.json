I have seen a lot of new NFT collectors in the past months and want to touch on the how NFT is way beyond just another profile picture project and give some introduction to NFT utility. The most common NFT utility is to combine it with DeFi mechanics to deliver passive income or additional NFTs to holders. However, are NFT and DeFi the perfect match for each other? What have we learnt so far from the projects we have seen this year?*\\n\\nBefore jumping into the integration of NFT and Defi, let‚Äôs introduce some **Defi basics.**\\n\\n## What is staking?\\n\\nStaking is a way to earn rewards for holding certain cryptocurrencies, similar concept as an interest-bearing savings account.\\n\\n## What is DAO?\\n\\nDAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. DAO is a governance organization represented by rules encoded as a open source computer program, aka smart contract.\\n\\n**Transparent and public**\\n\\nSince financial transactions and rules are recorded in smart contract, it eliminates the need of hierarchy or central body. No one can edit the rules without people noticing, because DAOs are transparent and public.\\n\\n**No Hierarchy**\\n\\nDecision-making process in a DAO is not top-down but based on a **bottom-up community.** This **consensus is achieved through voting**. Similar to voting at a company level, voting in DAOs is based on **ownership of assets**.\\n\\n## NFT & Staking & DAO ‚Äî Case study on CyberKongz\\n\\nCyberKongz is runs a classic model of NFT staking and DAO.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\\\*tlLYjEtiiAmXh0eR5qqSGA@2x.jpeg)\\n\\n**Stake**: CyberKongz NFT\\n\\n**Returns**: 10 $BANANA a day\\n\\n**Utility**: Customise your Kong, breed baby kongz, and also a governance token, meaning the amount of $BANANA and NFT represent the votes owners have.\\n\\n**What we learn from CyberKongz:**\\n\\n***Tokenomics of NFT native ecosystem utility token:***\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*TGRYajKLwpOv_LWbBlQTdA@2x.jpeg)\\n\\nThe price of $BANANA is primarily driven by the demand of people that want to customize and breed, generating more income from additional NFTs. As seen from the price chart, the price of $BANANA hit its ATH(all-time-high) in October, implying the high demand in breeding, as most holders have accumulated enough $BANANA to breed another Kong at that time. With the new NFT collection breeding and increase hype on the project, there is a high motivation for owners to breed more Kongz for sale to generate more income, hence higher demand for $BANANA.\\n\\nHowever, it is difficult to keep the NFT world interested and keep the token price up, if there isn‚Äôt a quick next step to the project that utilizes the token. We can see that from the price chart.\\n\\nSo is NFT passive income generation a reason for someone to ape into an NFT? Might not seem the wisest. I am not saying that these NFT won‚Äôt generate life changing wealth, but I am just saying people should sell their bag before the project dies down, and not naively believe some influencers saying diamond hand without doing in-depth research.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\\\*z6mpBT60HzKArD9vZdJKYQ@2x.jpeg)\\n\\n***Engagement and Efficiency of DAO in NFT:***\\n\\n$BANANA and the NFT are translated into votes. Owners can vote on the proposal by the dev team. But I see two problems coming with this:\\n\\n1. **Low engagement:** Only 686 members out of [2282 holders](https://etherscan.io/token/0x57a204aa1042f6e66dd7730813f4024114d74f37) are in the snapshot group, and less in each proposal voting.\\n2. **Decisions are binary:** Owners can either vote yes or no in a DAO. But this causes the decision making process less efficient, because of the absolute decision made, and not having room for add-on suggestions.\\n3. **One way communication:** In some other projects, like Doodles, the DAO proposal is two way, can be made by both dev and holders. This can keep engagement higher and build a two-way communication channel between dev and holders, besides Discord when things can get disorganised.\\n\\n## NFT Gaming: Staking with Risk ‚Äî Case study on Wolf Game\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*5WXizK_QLci4XKvFjm4vKg@2x.jpeg)\\n\\nWolf Game crashed the whole NFT Twitter overnight. Everyone was talking about sheep and wolf and wool. It is a good play on staking and game theory, imagine Olympus DAO but make it NFT. It is so far the most exciting project I have seen, experimenting with the Play-to-Earn (P2E) model and game theory.\\n\\n**Brief intro to wolf game:**\\n\\n*tl;dr: Wolf game is a play-to-earn game that provides owners passive income (in native utility token $WOOL) by using NFT and DeFi mechanics (staking). Key difference of this game and other NFT staking example stated above is its focus on risk in decision-making, to stake or unstake. The higher the risk, the higher the returns.*\\n\\nIn Wolf Game, owners can get either sheep or wolf (only a 10% chance). Sheep holder can have the option to keep staking their sheep in the barn and earn $WOOL (a native game utility token), but wolf will take a 20% tax. Or, if holders want to unstake their sheep, they will need to play a risky game, with a 50/50 chance of winning a portion of the 2.4 billion $WOOL.\\n\\n$WOOL can be traded on DEX, or use to be an in-game token to breed more sheep/ wolf, buy land or farmer. The utility and gameplay mechanics of land and farmer are still not announced yet.\\n\\nIf you want to know more, here is a [Wolf Game Newbie Guide and FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A-VxZpbqleNECPvB7jWY5CDgNuehI5WE6s2-67Zv908/edit?usp=sharing) made by **[terminatus.eth](https://twitter.com/TerminatusX).**\\n\\n**What we learn from Wolf Game:**\\n\\n***Vulnerability of blockchain gaming:*** The game is built entirely on-chain, meaning that the entire code of the game is put on to the blockchain, anyone can see it. Someone on twitter found a bug in the contract that could lead to potential exploit and the dev was completely transparent about it on [twitter](https://twitter.com/wolfdotgame/status/1462665060908736515?s=20) and paused the minting. Because of the immutability of NFT, the solution to it would be to mint new NFT and to make the old NFT invalid. The team had to change the whole game with additional game feature such as risk play and wool pouches to avoid a massive selloff of $WOOL.\\n\\n***Grind might not be necessary for a P2E model:*** In most of the blockchain games, like Axie Infinity, users have to put in a lot of time and grind in the game to have returns. But Wolf Game introduced a new idea of idle play. It takes up little time of the user to assess risks and make decision, while still generating traction from low market supply because most NFTs are staked. This explores a new type of P2E model.\\n\\n***Game theory and ponzinomics:*** Wolf game is a good game design to play on game theory and ‚Äúponzinomics‚Äù. Users need to calculate the risk & rewards for staking and unstaking their sheep, and selling or hodling $WOOL/ wool pouches. Users need to think whether others will also keep their sheep in staking, to keep the supply of NFT low and the price high, or whether people are selling and creating an abundant supply in the market. A great play on game theory (üêë , üêë ) and it creates the ‚Äú*ponzinomics‚Äù,* the \\\\*\\\\*more people stake their sheep, the less supply in the market, the higher the price.\\n\\n## NFT Fractionalisation ‚Äî Case Study on PleasrDAO\\n\\nNFT is built on ERC-721, with a nature of being indivisible and unique.\\n\\n**Limitations of NFT trading:**\\n\\n* ***Speculative market:*** A lot of the value of NFT is based on hype and investor sentiments. If a project loses investor‚Äôs attention, the NFT would be unsellable.\\n* ***Low liquidity:*** Some NFTs can get very expensive for regular investor to purchase. Owners need to wait for a long time for an investor to buy it.\\n\\nFractionalisation helps to solve these problems.\\n\\n**PleasrDAO and Fractionalization**\\n\\nFractionalisation is to divide the ERC-721 contract token (an NFT) into multiple ERC-20 token (just like bitcoin, ether, etc.). That means owners of the ERC-20 tokens are one of the owners of the NFT.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*X16YI3-cqL2YOuYhiz7elQ@2x.jpeg)\\n\\nPleasrDAO fractionalizaed the Doge NFT. The process was done by auctioning the token and sell it at the price that people are willing to pay for.\\n\\n**What we learn from PleasrDAO:**\\n\\nFractionalisation gives a few **benefits** that solve the limitations of NFT trading:\\n\\n* ***Pricing:*** This methods allow price discovery and understand the market value of the NFT, solving the problem of the first limitation listed above ‚Äî speculative market.\\n* **Improved liquidity:** Since these tokens are ERC-20 tokens, they can be trade freely in DEX, just like ETH. This provides liquidity to the NFT market.\\n\\n***DAO as a corporate structure:*** We have seen from above definitions and examples that DAO is a community-friendly inclusive organisation. But, PleasrDAO is completely opposite of that. It is made up by a handful of early NFT investors and artists, investing together and exploring ways for public like us to join them in their investment. This DAO formats remind me of a company structure. I think in foreseeable future, DAO can be a foundation of business partnership, lowering the legal costs required to setup companies and easier accounting since all the transactions should be already documented on the blockchain.\\n\\n**Final thoughts**\\n\\nIt is interesting to see how the NFT space had evolved this year. In my opinion, the relationship of NFT and DeFi is still in an experimental phase. The two are still in that trial and error couple phase to see how things can work out best. There are a lot of lessons we can learn from the DeFi and NFT integration. I think we will see a lot more innovative utility delivered by different NFT projects. Maybe we will even laugh at the ridiculous amount of money we spent on a profile picture that merely delivers any values in 10 years.\",\"timestamp\":1642164119,\"title\":\"The Marriage of NFT and DeFi \"},\"digest\":\"e4A44kkXtbjLJuDyj4JKzFt12ae2YDYQGauQ3iEqriY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xfB494ccD5F9440B28ed663525b3151CEBAF4E8e5\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FcwgtBR1airJmCot6Fnuxbs03nfm7CX3X6qK32Zrxn4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"fvTInlyp2IVOslwqQhzHg17QCLp1FgoyyLoIiMsgSWI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"z3tCn-sdXVfRCJp7RruHA7KycIuY5ZZatlBTLrWvvPNX8jw7m9M50AiLSlp98UM5_EmlxjOp24Oq3NZd-n1POQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1444dc6f4cdc13f3ad75b77576245b18c23e36c95adb56a037773062913c411670b5208b7a16be6371fc44a4297e06f2d6ea634a660ff83e9ffccf18fc0ef72f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FcwgtBR1airJmCot6Fnuxbs03nfm7CX3X6qK32Zrxn4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"fvTInlyp2IVOslwqQhzHg17QCLp1FgoyyLoIiMsgSWI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Fod-AJ5Rvvle8_OhZ_OxV7icdY50qXszIORDbgwj9CQ\"}"
