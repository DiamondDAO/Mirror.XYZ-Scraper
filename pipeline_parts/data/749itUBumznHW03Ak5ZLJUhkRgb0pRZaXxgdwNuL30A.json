"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*There is blood on the streets.* \\n\\n*Always is a good time to make a sound investment.* \\n\\n#### whui\\n\\nNew Year saw a lot of people posting their 2021 experiences, all full of excitement and undoings and learnings. I rarely document these things, cause I’m an average guy. However, I got inspired by these people to start writing these blog-esque things ([yes you](https://twitter.com/pinehearst_/status/1478006848787681280?s=20)). Searching for a niche I could focus on, I landed on something known to you as copy-trading, you know the one where you copy trade your favorite influencer or finfluencer. \\n\\nMy observation was that most of these players are either paid shillers or big bag holders. Paid shillers usually make money from your views, while big bag holders usually have the liberty to speculate. Now, I'm not gonna give your copy trading or investment advice. I'm gonna document my decisions, no matter how stupid or smart they are. This will give you validation on how an average noob or newbie functions (I'll be honest, I’m not a savvy investor, and let’s be honest most of us are not). For me, at the end of 2022, this should give me a summary of how far I have improved, not just financially, but also in writing skills and vocab. \\n\\nSo as Fabrizio Romano says, here we go …. \\n\\n#### gobennas\\n\\nIf you travel 365 back, from the date of publishing, I was a crypto-ignorant person. GME and DOGE hype got me into it. I had around 200 INR, which I put into DOGE thinking  “*hey if it goes from 0.01 USD to at least 10,000 USD, I’m a millionaire right ?*”. So that’s my origin story. \\n\\nMonths of saving pocket money got me to around 300 USD in crypto. Now, I didn’t have a job. I was a fresh postgraduate (jobless) and pocket money experimentation was all I had. It was around this time I came across [The Defiant Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDefiant). My first venture into DeFi was Terra’s Anchor Protocol. Get some LUNA, borrow some UST, deposit into savings. \\n\\nThe simplicity and beautiful UI aesthetics were key to my attraction towards it. And I found [FlipsideCrypto](https://twitter.com/flipsidecrypto). They pay you for DeFi analytics and insights, and you get to learn daily about these new protocols and get paid to do that. I entered the Flipside early, so I got to experiment and learn without much pressure. These days however, what can I say, competition is mad (often against machines and code). Thanks to those folks, I know SQL, HTML, Python, and some basic data analysis skills, and now sit atop of crypto worth 22K as of the bloody market (i mean red everywhere). \\n\\n![my payments so far using 'https://kidas.app/flipside/payments'](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qbvuxMr9c-lzCzGzErdcP.png?height=299&width=890)\\n\\n#### apalume\\n\\nSo in like 4 months’ time, I went from 300 USD to 20+K USD. DeFi is a place of new opportunities, for those ready to seize it. But it is also a place for attaining Financial Freedom as you earn. Put your assets to work in Protocols like Anchor, Nexus, Yearn, Convex, Olympus and earn good passive income.\\n\\nNow, my definition of personal Financial Freedom is 650 USD a month right now, which is around 50,000 INR, which in the eyes of my parents is a very solid salary. For achieving this, I will need to have at least 75000 USD worth of assets earning a minimum of 10% APR. This shouldn’t be extremely hard as All the protocols mentioned above promise such double-digit yields on various assets and asset classes.\\n\\nThe problem however is, will I reach that magic number?\\n\\nMoreover, @punk6529 in their [new year tweet thread](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1477259887746990084?s=20), mentions how Crypto is highly speculative. Add to that, [this warning](https://medium.com/predict/sorry-but-the-mother-of-all-crashes-is-coming-and-it-wont-be-fun-beaa2bc9f96a) by Eugenio De Lucchi, it’s a scary time for me to take this risk, but I want to try a full-on onchain. \\n\\n#### ita\",\"timestamp\":1641640252,\"title\":\"genesis\"},\"digest\":\"Uvw3GqRT2Gr5R1T5r3bxrR14_ejMuuwDfLCjTcoiB5c\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5Ea3b08B0588297063debbE5a0Ad1c3f307299F0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tpTh2P-5ukCIpchoOtxy6nLRZk7iyeQE0COIa67JCog\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"A3MOwSidVzoNpadkeCGoaAA7bXxqOZfJPswzo0rVKvU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"dNI15r05oz6rfUTNgTDtCJU6zonj4DpD9reXoMnq5RAWgGG9Q0pCi60TCVxtq9htY7pMYZb6mSRKA8CTDTl1dA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x695a3a2c9d842170127f4535cd3e589d29b28626eec25dd66f9998f2ee8296ff7ecd8a56f0c6521b3edba48958f37373b1e37ab6bcf3a1e9bfdc21d017afed8e1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tpTh2P-5ukCIpchoOtxy6nLRZk7iyeQE0COIa67JCog\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"A3MOwSidVzoNpadkeCGoaAA7bXxqOZfJPswzo0rVKvU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"J32uXTOoC1bayvos9jgJNWZws-DarIbdzhZ1T9msspI\"}"
