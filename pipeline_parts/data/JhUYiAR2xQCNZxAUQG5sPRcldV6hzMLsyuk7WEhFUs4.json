"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"As a human being, we often tend to look forward (which is good), but forget to take a step back and reflect on the things that we achieve in the past. Looking back through the time that we’ve been through sometimes makes us realize how far we are since the last time that we wrote the “dream” that we prayed for during the hard time.\\n\\n**Rejection**\\n\\nRejection was always being a part of everyone's journey, especially me. I still remember getting rejected from Google Summer of code when I’ve already prepared for the 2-3 months for the proposal. Applying for Google Student campus lead & Amazon campus ambassador then get a rejection for both of them. Even in my personal life, I got rejected by the people that I loved the most at that time.\\n\\nGetting rejection to make me evaluate myself & make a conclusion that I’ve not good enough. Rejection makes me use that energy to move forward then push myself out of my limit & do the things that I’ve never become to and that drives me to this point now.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*Taking a Risk\\n\\\\*\\\\*We may tend to didn’t to take a risk for anything that we do. But leaving the status quo was necessary if the growth was the end goal. The risk of leaving the status quo will make us to leaving our comfort zone and hedge the risk. The risk maybe will align with the reward (growth) that we’ve projected but sometimes even more! As long as the risk will not bet against our integrity, that’s was the worth bet.\\n\\nThe biggest decision that I’ve been making in early 2020 - now, was:\\n\\n* Creating Youtube videos\\n* Publishing my learning process in public\\n* Move 90% of my savings account to $ETH as a hedge\\n* Say “Yes” when my lead (Albert & Yusuf) challenges me with things that I’ve never done yet.\\n* Working with foreign people (Upwork)\\n* Taking web3 jobs\\n* Take Cryptography as the main topic for my thesis\\n* Buy a Desktop (PC) for gaming & hang out with my old friends on discord\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*What Next?\\\\*\\\\*So, what are the most important goals for 22’?\\n\\n* Graduated from college\\n* Grow my youtube channel\\n* Reach 1B (Networth)\\n\\nHopefully, this article will be a reminder for me in the future that I’ve made a progress.\\n\\n![Happy new year everyone!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lUXjir1vvX4t8EeBZLrcP.JPG?height=464&width=828)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1640955874,\"title\":\"2021\"},\"digest\":\"DuG8qymqH1p8Y8Xlr_T2Vl7-GrXwrn8woiciW6-Jn8I\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x23f9511cBBCF8021722E1A4324d5cd5E7AEc1397\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZsMsLMhLhH70RY3ffMsoip658HA8GbmfIoNe15-0G6k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1CXHJ5icvavgnebkxZvy3aPyd27mlkaxzFmVh_2XfTI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"fSncYGvuOtoQmHUKfuMQBctUx5tNdZwlLIJYK2DsPTfI5T8mL9Uuyj6exdJIum2EDn1txfwYH-n1k5374h0_Hw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x462bbee9ee199ccf41be0eff27e59ec0214f613723bde7148f63f92f223cfe4a396bcb20710350ad78dea28e62b81d6c448b4c45152c4a6f21f8e5c37ea657221b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZsMsLMhLhH70RY3ffMsoip658HA8GbmfIoNe15-0G6k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1CXHJ5icvavgnebkxZvy3aPyd27mlkaxzFmVh_2XfTI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jqUv7otXbW8RRUHFSTPYqF6ZXu21oFkyGocr_BVW2jY\"}"
