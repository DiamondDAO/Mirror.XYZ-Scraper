People or investors who send coins become miners. These are rewarded with a percentage (around 70%) of new CityCoins tokens, and the other percentage (30%) goes to a city-managed portfolio to invest in municipal projects.\\n\\nThis financial strategy has the potential to replace taxes as we know them, by creating funds from mining and crypto DeFi protocols.\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54b1c3a7-f50e-4f0e-a1bd-85a723fe9c1c\\\\_2378x1184.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54b1c3a7-f50e-4f0e-a1bd-85a723fe9c1c\\\\_2378x1184.png)\\n\\nIn the future, citizens will have the option to vote for the financing of different municipal projects, thus creating more democracy.\\n\\nMiami was the first city in the United States to have its own cryptocurrency using this same model.\\n\\n> MiamiCoin (MIA) is a way for people to support Magic City and grow their cryptocurrency treasure while earning STX and BTC for themselves.\\n\\nSTX is the token that represents the [Stacks](http://stacks.co/) protocol, where the ‚Äú[Citycoins](https://www.citycoins.co/)‚Äù infrastructure is built on.\\n\\n#### üìà All Time Highs (ATH)\\n\\nOn Wednesday November 10th, [Bitcoin](http://ycobitcoin.com/) reached its all-time high by briefly touching $69k. That same day, Ethereum also broke a record by reaching $ 4,878.26 per Ether.\\n\\nMost of the rest of the crypto market (alt-coins) has been on the downside ever since as many investors choose to exchange their alt-coins for bitcoins and ethers upon seeing an uptrend in these two cryptocurrencies that reign the market.\\n\\nAdding to the fuel is the exponential adoption growth that we are witnessing.\\n\\nAt the beginning of 2015 there were about 60 million Bitcoin addresses, today we have close to 900 million bitcoin addresses available. (see below)\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9866f7f2-411f-46ca-9714-dc987216df6b\\\\_1800x1013.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9866f7f2-411f-46ca-9714-dc987216df6b\\\\_1800x1013.png)\\n\\nIt is important to note that institutional money has just started to enter this industry in a massive way. A few days ago the first ‚ÄúBitcoin Futures ETF‚Äù was approved, but many other ETFs are awaiting approval. The world of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) continues to explore new use case and keep attracting large corporations in their effort to jump on the bandwagon and monetize their digital assets. Additionally, it feels like every day a new DeFi protocol hits the market and with improvements and new investment strategies that allows the multiplication of crypto assets.\\n\\nAnother important measure of the speed of change in the market is the amount of bitcoins that is leaving exchanges. As we can see in the lower graph (yellow line) the balance in the exchanges has fallen precipitously in recent months.\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5772a6dd-6027-4266-a63a-a363d375071f\\\\_1800x1013.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5772a6dd-6027-4266-a63a-a363d375071f\\\\_1800x1013.png)\\n\\nMany of these coins are being sent to cold wallets and other to custodians.
