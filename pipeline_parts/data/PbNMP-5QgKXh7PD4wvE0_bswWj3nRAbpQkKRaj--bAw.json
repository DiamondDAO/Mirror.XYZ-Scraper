She added, “We are happy to launch this new segment at Nasdaq Stockholm with 21Shares as the first issuer.” \\n\\nAccording to the press release, most traditional banks and brokers allow investors to trade all ETNs listed on Nasdaq Stockholm. This is a first that opens up new possibilities to investors interested in investing in cryptocurrencies but who are uncomfortable doing so on unregulated exchanges.\",\"timestamp\":1639038925,\"title\":\"Nasdaq Stockholm lists Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded notes\"},\"digest\":\"v2YoNEg7Jis0gqfpzBFmnH44eBQB5dGrcuqt57ZPTPI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x70659845Ee05445b244797871c807e20DBf007E2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cLb5oizWe6wvslKQemb6lS0EmumIcznHW0YyoyGB8Ig\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"XMt7c8xifhI1E5mRushQL4ayxHQNbtisFpdmaQlApnk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"BjPkzNq9E4Qi33n2fjGKPFfrSf9ssi56s9HPXEH4H6eKIVUgyeMVyahfWNJ6-xe39pSwNFEuMJU6zTtNKv3M8A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x7364c531ab703bdf2db32f8d458acf07034e7f63901cd8dcb954883caff3601c7a08c7cc8915b71662aa8dedc33f37f6f6dfdf3008d3c8a554d581c0b1dbcbd51c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cLb5oizWe6wvslKQemb6lS0EmumIcznHW0YyoyGB8Ig\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"XMt7c8xifhI1E5mRushQL4ayxHQNbtisFpdmaQlApnk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"v2YoNEg7Jis0gqfpzBFmnH44eBQB5dGrcuqt57ZPTPI\"}"
