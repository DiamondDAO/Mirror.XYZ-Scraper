"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## The collections “BAYC” and “CryptoPunks” are bright examples of why buying in early is essential.\\n\\nIt is no secret that the earlier you are in something that is growing and involves money, the better. This is true for stocks, crypto, and even sneakers. Of course, this applies to NFTs too.\\n\\nBelow, we will briefly talk about 2 of the most notorious and expensive NFT collections, Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks.\\n*Spoiler alert: they both have strong communities behind them.*\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/njoaJV64R4qI5iiR4nHwv.png?height=874&width=1400)\\n\\n**Bored Ape Yacht Club**\\n\\nBAYC is a collection created by Yuga Labs, and it contains 10,000 Bored Apes. Each Bored Ape gives you access to the exclusive Yacht Club and grants you full commercial rights for your Ape. The project was minted on the 23rd of April, 2021, for 0.08 eth (around $200) and was not ultimately sold out by early May. To give you a perspective of how mindblowing it is that BAYC was not sold out for several weeks, the floor price of the collection is now $180,000, and the total trading volume is \\\\~$500,000,000 in the last 7 months!\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/P1XbCWqxc0ghEOTX-ww_b.png?height=688&width=1400)\\n\\n**CryptoPunks**\\n\\nThe collection CryptoPunks was created by Larva Labs in June of 2017. It contains 10,000 uniquely generated characters. Each artwork is 24x24 pixels and “live” in the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) blockchain.\\nLavra Labs planned to offer 9,000 characters for free and keep 1,000 for the creators as the “Punk Devs.” Yes, **CryptoPunks were free**. After Mashable published [an article](https://mashable.com/article/cryptopunks-ethereum-art-collectibles) about the project, the characters were gone in 24 hours. Now, the floor price of CryptoPunks is \\\\~80 eth ($304,000).\\n\\nThat is all, folks. The conclusion is simple: The earlier you are into an NFT collection, the better.
