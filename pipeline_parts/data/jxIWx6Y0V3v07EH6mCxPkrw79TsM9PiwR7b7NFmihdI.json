Once you set up your BrightID, there are more opportunities for you to interact with other crypto applications with full confidence that you are among mensch. \\n\\nüöÄ  Let's go üé¢ \\n\\n## Watch the full tutorial via the shortened bit.ly links below. I actually taught two friends to do this from beginning to end!\\n\\nPart 1 link: [bit.ly/Part1BrightID](bit.ly/Part1BrightID)\\n\\nPart 2 link: [bit.ly/Part2BrightID](bit.ly/Part2BrightID)\\n\\nPart 3 link: [bit.ly/Part3BrightID](bit.ly/Part3BrightID)\\n\\n## This post teaches you how to set up BrightID, step by step, in written form below.\\n\\n\\n### 1. Download BrightID on your mobile device. \\n- Here's the link for [Android](bit.ly/Part3BrightID) \\n- Here's the link for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brightid/id1428946820)\\n- Follow on screen instructions. Set up your username and photo.\\n\\n\\n### 2. Read through BrightID's gitbook for more context.\\n\\n- [https://brightid.gitbook.io/brightid/getting-verified](https://brightid.gitbook.io/brightid/getting-verified)\\n- It's extremely detailed in case my post is too brief for you.\\n\\n\\n### 3. Attend a connection party.\\n- Go to this link [https://meet.brightid.org/#/](https://meet.brightid.org/#/).\\n- Find a time that is suitable for you and attend the zoom meeting. I attended 2 where no one showed up and the host didn't let me in; I was freaking out and asking my friends to verify me. Be patient, just stay on for another 15 min waiting for the host to let you in. I finally got in my third connection party.\\n- Your zoom BrightID host will tell you everything you need to know about getting verified and will verify you along with others in your group. Your host will tell you that it takes 1hour before you are verified in the system. You will need to wait 1hour before you can proceed to linking your BrightID with Rabbithole. Your host will also answer any additional questions you have at the end.\\n\\n\\n> Part 1 (Steps 1 - 3) video tutorial [link](https://www.loom.com/share/afec1f4fe6694759a902d33a6e907b1c).\\n\\n\\n### 4. Set up your wallet.\\n- Personally, I used my Metamask wallet. If you don't know how to link Rabbithole to your Metamask, you probably just haven't used MetaMask before.\\n- Google \\\"Metamask\\\" and download the chrome extension (my recommendation).\\n- Once it's downloaded, make your own Metamask account. Follow on screen instructions to set up your password.\\n\\n> Part 2 (Step 4) video tutorial [link](https://www.loom.com/share/e34577cea43b43ee85c67966484e547c).\\n\\n\\n### 5. Link your Rabbithole account (once you are verified on BrightID).\\n- Connect your Metamask to your Rabbithole account by clicking \\\"Connect Wallet\\\" on the top right of [app.rabbithole.gg](app.rabbithole.gg).\\n- Let's switch over to BrightID.\\n- Here's the [URL](https://brightid.gitbook.io/brightid/linking-brightid-to-applications) about how to link.\\n- Here's the [link](https://apps.brightid.org/) to actually link.\\n- On the previous link, click on Rabbithole among all the choices of applications to link BrightID. It will open up a new window for Rabbithole. You can then scan a QR code with your BrightID app to link. Next step is how.\\n- Open up the BrightID app on your phone, hit \\\"Scan a Code,\\\" then scan the QR code on your desktop.\\n- Follow the on screen instructions.\\n- Rabbithole will be sponsoring you. Do not freak out if you don't have a \\\"sponsor\\\" to be verified. You should be verified and linked!\\n\\n\\n### 6. Verify Task Completion on Rabbithole.\\n- Make sure you have Rabbithole's [url](https://app.rabbithole.gg/skills/bright-id) for this skill open.\\n- You already started task from #5.\\n- Click \\\"Redeem\\\" in the top right on the page.\\n- Metamask extension will pop up and you will click \\\"Sign.\\\"\\n- Now, your task says it's \\\"Redeemed.\\\" You now have 100XP points for your Rabbithole profile.\\n- Click \\\"Back to Skill\\\" on the left.\\n- Then click \\\"Complete Skill\\\" on the right.\\n- Metamask extension will pop up and you will click \\\"Sign.\\\"\\n- ALL DONE ‚úÖ\\n\\n> Part 3 (Steps 5 & 6) video tutorial [link](https://www.loom.com/share/0a2b34f30ec84fe18a4fb6e882fd9478).\\n\\n### Hope you're ready for more quests and skills to master!
