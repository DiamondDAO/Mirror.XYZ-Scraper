"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Sometimes i feel so boring in web3.\\n\\nI donno why this happens time to time, but it feels so true and so deep.\\n\\nIt may be because of my lack of money to pay the gas, or my lack of insights to tell the goldens from rugs, or may be my lack of wisdom to comprehend what’s happening in this crypto world.\\n\\nI know what’s web3, what’s gamefi, what’s a dao, what’s defi1&2. But I may no fully understand them. As I see, it’s just another way of making money.\\n\\nIt shouldn’t be. It should be totally degen. Crypto should be anti-capital rather than born for it.\\n\\nI donno how many people are reading this. Most probably 0. I don’t even have a ens by which people can find me.\\n\\nI donno know how to contribute to a dao cuz I have no skills I can boast. I have no talent in management or economy or design either.\\n\\nI donno when I could afford a nft on opensea. Most probably never.\\n\\nPeople talking about decentralization, full ownership everyday. I don’t understand why you still have to boast your identity and belongings everywhere around esp in web2. I don’t see the point of doing so when you live in a decentralized world.\\n\\nIt feels like I’m so honored to be a node on chain.\\n\\nBut I love the fact that people finally begin to realize the value of Ghozali Everyday.\\n\\nI love how $people were mooning up in the first place when people think of this idea. I love how Daos and forums run in the first place. I love the fact people buy bitcoin for nothing when it’s first created. I love how people stand for crypto when most of the people haven’t realized its beauty. Too many people are rushing into the crypto world for money. This feels weird but on the other hand it’s right these group of people who are pushing the price soaring up high.\\n\\nI will buy nft, and it will soon be down to 0E. It’s totally alright. I love the image.\\n\\nI wish those who speculate would be washed away, while pure meme spirit of dogecoin stays.\",\"timestamp\":1642093659,\"title\":\"A Hobo Mumbles\"},\"digest\":\"C1-z5nvlaoe80_ztD9ExjQUlQuHKtblWW2g1Vj-oOo0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x637e5b007d9EEae686e0f19f05a8E5B8e2Afd4d5\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"h_wMzLcFa0M0n6McSh_SBSsupLYGFJjri2neKoANZ0o\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xOp-qJ0cDHRz95iXAPmPwn2SuHC1n5_sfxfpKy5NSuo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"bSHZDXgLeZNgq2nXdDTzfTWuMyQhvVNeOqxeuK3eOcKr0ol-oJXfsfrNJw-L22guh0lOb8RxeRDybnGB1GM2RA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x79fa0abcad24cf3f3e95bb735d2beef87bbc61bca3fdb585ab65c4408c9b9e5765a0bd5c725600e9b6b061036f7af7c0e17affec74ddd11c4e5bfc8d6e1d9dc01c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"h_wMzLcFa0M0n6McSh_SBSsupLYGFJjri2neKoANZ0o\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xOp-qJ0cDHRz95iXAPmPwn2SuHC1n5_sfxfpKy5NSuo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"t21dgT7YlLqlD1_Zt0zMn6t26tyNrDs3R5caaAj4uYs\"}"
