"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1. The fund does not adopt a temporary defensive position. Normally, the foundation holds Bitcoin futures contracts when the value of Bitcoin is flat or falling or rising. In order to maintain exposure to Bitcoin futures contracts, the foundation sells its futures contracts when it is about to expire and replaces them with new futures contracts with a later expiration date, commonly known as \\\"Rolling\\\". There is a difference between a new futures contract with a later expiration date and a futures contract with a shorter expiration date, that is, \\\"futures premium.\\\" If the futures contract with a later expiration date is priced higher than that with a shorter expiration date, during the rollover, the fund will sell the expiring contract at a relatively low price and buy the expiring contract at a relatively high price Contracts with a later date, and vice versa. In short, the foundation \\\"renews\\\" indefinitely and does not take the initiative to liquidate positions.\\n2. Funds generally seek to maintain full investment in these portfolios at all times, providing exposure to Bitcoin futures, regardless of market conditions, trends or directions.\\n3. The fund does not invest or seek direct access to the current \\\"spot\\\" or cash prices of Bitcoin. Funds are classified as non-diversified, that is, a relatively high proportion of assets are invested in financial instruments with a single or a small number of counterparties.\\n4.
