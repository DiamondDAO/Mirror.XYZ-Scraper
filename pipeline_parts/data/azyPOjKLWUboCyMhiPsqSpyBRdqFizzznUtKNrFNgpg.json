"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1963 Houston\\n\\nIn 1960, a U-2 Spy-plane was shot down while deep inside USSR airspace, on the eve of an East-West summit in Paris. A thaw in the Cold War, from a 1959 meeting at Camp David, had frozen over.\\n\\nThe Cold War called for a new kind of spy in the sky out of the reach of conventional missiles.\\n\\nAn Earth-bound spacecraft was designed in the middle of a Space Race to the moon. It would take pictures of the Earth from orbit, for Soviets and secrets. In 1957, years before anyone was launched into space, the U.S. Air Force funded an idea developed in WW II - A spaceplane called \\\"Dyna-Soar\\\".\\n\\nFunding for the spaceplane was cut just as construction began in 1963. It was mothballed.\\n\\nThe US Air Force had a plan B. It was named 'Manned Orbital Laboratory' (MOL).\\n\\nMilitary astronauts would pilot modified Gemini ships for 30 day missions. Black ops eyes in the sky.\\n\\nThe Gemini ships were expanded two-pilot versions of the single-pilot space-craft flown by the \\\"Mercury Seven\\\". There was an unmanned test-flight in 1966 but the Vietnam War took precedence. The program was cancelled in June 1969. Seven of the program's astronauts would be transferred to a new program, and all would fly it.\\n\\nThe new program was for a spaceplane called \\\"the Space Shuttle\\\".\\n\\n2911\\n\\nJacob C. Tagore, Jr. wandered through the kaleidoscope panopticon of the unreal realities of a world. All the stories, histories, splendor, sadness, ennui, and entertainment were packed into the great halls of the Crystal Palaces - the 24/7 beating heart of how a world saw itself.\\n\\n\\\"It takes some getting used to, you will with training. You can hide in plain sight.\\\" said the voice.\\n\\n\\\"But everyone can see you and you can see everything.\\\" said Jacob.\\n\\n\\\"You only see what others want you to see. Layer on seeing only what you want to see, whether you admit it or not, now you're seeing a lot less. And they see a lot less of you than they realize.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I get that. It's like a shared lie.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, you can share a lie or a story with someone, even if neither of you agreed to it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, a story is a lie, isn't it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Jacob, a story can contain more truth than any official report. Even the 'Oracles on the 'chains will turn a story into history, and history into story, if things are done just a little differently.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is this why you had me coming here the last few weeks?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have to learn in public, if you're going to work in secret, Jacob.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What happens now? What am I supposed to do and to whom am I doing it to this time?‚Äù Jacob thought about his escape from that tower.\\n\\n\\\"Jacob, you will unlearn a lifetime of habits. We all want to be 'good' and tell the 'truth', or at least look that way, which is a kind of a secret lie we can tell ourselves. Tell too many, you fall in your own trap. Tell too few, you can't escape others' traps.\\\"\\n\\nJacob walking from trap to trap, as he explored the Crystal Palaces.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_AnWInHmm4ENsSd7tSzgv.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7X7SOZ5H9YmPNEinO-BzK.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633890080,\"title\":\"1961: 5.3 Mothball and Moon, 2911\"},\"digest\":\"XGcpiJO3mUtYV35n3GoFmvFxa33YdnNnTDdgtIV_Xlk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"nnQVhd2SZfKFNoz4_7RWy__SOdKDJ614aLL964KPW7e4-f1OKzkkTx706t46_WzNOATtncmGcCsW-FJ_sjcgeg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"XGcpiJO3mUtYV35n3GoFmvFxa33YdnNnTDdgtIV_Xlk\"}"
