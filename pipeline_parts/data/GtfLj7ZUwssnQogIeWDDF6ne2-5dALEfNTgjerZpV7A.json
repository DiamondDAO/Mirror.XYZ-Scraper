"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Maurice Ravel**, in full **Joseph-Maurice Ravel**, (born March 7, 1875, Ciboure, France—died December 28, 1937, Paris), French composer of Swiss-Basque descent, noted for his musical craftsmanship and perfection of form and style in such works as *Boléro* (1928), *Pavane pour une infante défunte* (1899; *Pavane for a Dead Princess*)*, Rapsodie espagnole* (1907), the [ballet](https://www.britannica.com/art/ballet) *Daphnis et Chloé* (first performed 1912), and the opera *L’Enfant et les sortilèges* (1925; *The Child and the Enchantments*).\\n\\nRavel was born in a village near Saint-Jean-de-Luz, [France](https://www.britannica.com/place/France), of a Swiss father and a Basque mother. His family background was an artistic and [cultivated](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cultivated) one, and the young Maurice received every encouragement from his father when his talent for [music](https://www.britannica.com/art/music) became apparent at an early age. In 1889, at 14, he entered the Paris Conservatoire, where he remained until 1905. During this period he composed some of his best known works, including the *Pavane for a Dead Princess,* the *Sonatine* for piano, and the *String Quartet.* All these works, especially the two latter, show the astonishing early perfection of style and craftsmanship that are the hallmarks of Ravel’s entire [oeuvre](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oeuvre). He is one of the rare composers whose early works seem scarcely less mature than those of his maturity. Indeed, his failure at the Conservatoire, after three attempts, to win the coveted [Prix de Rome](https://www.britannica.com/art/Prix-de-Rome) for [composition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/composition) (the works he submitted were judged too “advanced” by ultraconservative members of the jury) caused something of a scandal. Indignant protests were published, and liberal-minded musicians and writers, including the musicologist and novelist [Romain Rolland](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Romain-Rolland), supported Ravel. As a result, the director of the Conservatoire, [Théodore Dubois](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Theodore-Dubois), was forced to resign, and his place was taken by the composer [Gabriel Fauré](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gabriel-Faure), with whom Ravel had studied composition.\\n\\nRavel was in no sense a revolutionary musician. He was for the most part content to work within the established formal and harmonic conventions of his day, still firmly rooted in tonality—i.e., the organization of music around focal tones. Yet, so very personal and individual was his [adaptation](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adaptation) and manipulation of the traditional musical [idiom](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idiom) that it would be true to say he forged for himself a language of his own that bears the stamp of his personality as unmistakably as any work of Bach or [Chopin](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Frederic-Chopin). While his melodies are almost always modal (i.e., based not on the conventional Western [diatonic scale](https://www.britannica.com/art/diatonic) but on the old Greek Phrygian and Dorian modes), his harmonies derive their often somewhat acid flavour from his fondness for “added” notes and unresolved appoggiaturas, or notes extraneous to the chord that are allowed to remain harmonically unresolved. He enriched the literature of the piano by a series of masterworks, ranging from the early *Jeux d’eau* (completed 1901) and the *Miroirs* of 1905 to the [formidable](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/formidable) *Gaspard de la nuit* (1908), *Le Tombeau de Couperin* (1917), and the two piano concerti (1931). Of his purely orchestral works, the *Rapsodie espagnole* and *[Boléro](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bolero-by-Ravel)* are the best known and reveal his [consummate](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consummate) mastery of the art of instrumentation. But perhaps the highlights of his career were his collaboration with the Russian impresario [Serge Diaghilev](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Serge-Pavlovich-Diaghilev), for whose [Ballets Russes](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ballets-Russes-ballet-company) he composed the masterpiece *[Daphnis et Chloé](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Daphnis-and-Chloe-ballet-by-Fokine),* and with the French writer [Colette](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Colette), who was the librettist of his best known opera, *L’Enfant et les sortilèges.* The latter work gave Ravel an opportunity of doing ingenious and amusing things with the animals and inanimate objects that come to life in this tale of bewitchment and magic in which a naughty child is involved. His only other operatic venture had been his brilliantly satirical *L’Heure espagnole* (first performed 1911). As a songwriter Ravel achieved great distinction with his imaginative *Histoires naturelles, Trois poèmes de Stéphane Mallarmé,* and *Chansons madécasses*.\",\"timestamp\":1637008025,\"title\":\"Ravel - About him\"},\"digest\":\"YHClaQJZgpB7lr7I6fjapGAiW_J4kXQNej5nLXkwzKQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xb88894483799D7cb7a030E0d3aB20D46e54b0085\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"WJpwfkfy0DB3Kiiv1PxUjX8rIUO2g_yVrevf6KscXfA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"epoQBOT3QMeRC5XCWXBWEG3MQMyqOH3L15ypFwdaFKM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"0erhlckXp3_JjX11_sdwfXwSpjHXPo42QABHkB0mVHD2ap4lCVDPfBg2vl7QBc-OHUR9r0kTuhtxGLhabql-jA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8a447e5aa199001c4e87897f351cf5d8b670559cbf479f0a2e6eeeb6c9ad63c6449bc7bc16508956c9b5c985e94d8ffe9713678b5afc2003b8b09eb1616449b11c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"WJpwfkfy0DB3Kiiv1PxUjX8rIUO2g_yVrevf6KscXfA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"epoQBOT3QMeRC5XCWXBWEG3MQMyqOH3L15ypFwdaFKM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"YHClaQJZgpB7lr7I6fjapGAiW_J4kXQNej5nLXkwzKQ\"}"
