"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"which seemed to him a plausible one.  \\\"M. de Chalusse was not dead,\\\" said he, \\\"when M. de Coralth and M. de Valorsay decided on this plan of ridding themselves of me.  Consequently, Mademoiselle Marguerite was still an heiress.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's true; but the very day after the commission of the crime, the accomplices must have discovered that it could do them no good; so, why have they still persisted in their scheme?\\\"\\n\\nPascal tried to find a satisfactory answer, but failed.\\n\\n\\\"There must be some iniquitous mystery in this affair, which neither you nor I suspect,\\\" remarked the baron.\\n\\n\\\"That is exactly what my mother told me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah! that's Madame Ferailleur's opinion? Then it is a good one.  Come, let us reason a little.  Mademoiselle Marguerite loved you, you say?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And she has suddenly broken off the engagement?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She wrote to me that the Count de Chalusse extorted from her a promise on his death-bed, that she would marry the Marquis de Valorsay.\\\"\\n\\nThe baron sprang to his feet.  \\\"Stop,\\\" he cried--\\\"stop! We now have a clue to the truth, perhaps.  Ah! so Mademoiselle Marguerite has written to you that M. de Chalusse commanded her to marry the marquis! Then the count must have been fully restored to consciousness before he breathed his last.  On the other hand, Valorsay pretends that Mademoiselle Marguerite is left without resources, simply because the count died too suddenly to be able to write or to sign a couple of lines.  Can you reconcile these two versions of the affair, M. Ferailleur? Certainly not.  Then which version is false? We must ascertain that point.  When shall you see Mademoiselle Marguerite again?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She has requested me NEVER to try to see her again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well! She must be disobeyed.  You must discover some way of seeing her without anyone's knowledge.  She is undoubtedly watched, so don't write on any account.\\\" He reflected for a moment, and then added: \\\"We shall, perhaps, become morally certain of Valorsay's and Coralth's guilt, but there's a wide difference between this and the establishment of their guilt by material proofs.  Two scoundrels who league to ruin an honest man don't sign a contract to that effect before a notary.  Proofs! Ah! where shall we find them? We must gain an intimate knowledge of Valorsay's private life.  The best plan would be to find some man devoted to our interests who would watch him, and insinuate himself into his confidence.\\\"\\n\\nPascal interrupted the baron with an eager gesture. Hope glittered in his eyes.  \\\"Yes!\\\" he exclaimed, \\\"yes; it is necessary that M. de Valorsay should be watched by a man of quick perception--a man clever enough to make himself useful to the marquis, and capable of rendering him an important service in case of need.  I will be the man, monsieur, if you will allow me.  The thought occurred to me just now while I was listening to you.  You promised to send some one to Valorsay's house with money.  I entreat you to allow me to take the place of the man you intended to send.  The marquis doesn't know me, and I am sufficiently sure of myself to promise you that I will not betray my identity.  I will present myself as your agent; he will give me his confidence.  I shall take him money or fair promises, I shall be well received, and I have a plan----\\\"\\n\\nHe was interrupted by a rap at the door.  The next moment a footman entered, and informed his master that a messenger wished to speak to him on urgent business.  \\\"Let him come in,\\\" said the baron.\\n\\nIt was Job, Madame Lia d'Argeles's confidential servant, who entered the room.  He bowed respectfully, and, with an air of profound mystery exclaimed: \\\"I have been looking for the baron everywhere.  I was ordered by madame not to return without him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well,\\\" said M. Trigault.  \\\"I will go with you at once.\\\"\\n\\nV.\\n\\nHow was it that a clever man like M. Fortunat made such a blunder as to choose a Sunday, and a racing Sunday too, to call on M. Wilkie.  His anxiety might explain the mistake, but it did not justify it.  He felt certain, that under any other circumstances he would not have been dismissed so cavalierly.  He would at least have been allowed to develop his proposals, and then who knows what might have happened?\\n\\nBut the races had interfered with his plans.  M. Wilkie had been compelled to attend to Pompier de Nanterre, that famous steeplechaser, of which he owned one-third part, and he had, moreover, to give orders to the jockey, whose lord and master he was to an equal extent.  These were sacred duties, since Wilkie's share in a race-horse constituted his only claim to a footing in fashionable society.  But it was a strong claim--a claim that justified the display of whips and spurs that decorated his apartments in the Rue du Helder, and allowed him to aspire to the character of a sporting man.  Wilkie really imagined that folks were waiting for him at Vincennes; and that the fete would not be complete without his presence.\\n\\nStill, when he presented himself inside the enclosure, a cigar in his mouth, and his racing card dangling from his button-hole, he was obliged to confess that his entrance did not create much of a sensation.  An astonishing bit of news had imparted unusual excitement to the ring.  People were eagerly discussing the Marquis de Valorsay's sudden determination to pay forfeit and withdraw his horses from the contest; and the best informed declared that in the betting-rooms the evening before he had openly announced his intention of selling his racing stable.  If the marquis had hoped that by adopting this course he would silence the suspicions which had been aroused, he was doomed to grievous disappointment.  The rumor that he had secretly bet against his own horse, Domingo, on the previous Sunday, and that he had given orders not to let the animal win the race, was steadily gaining credence.\\n\\nLarge sums had been staked on Domingo's success.  He had been the favorite in the betting ring and the losers were by no means pleased.  Some declared that they had seen the jockey hold Domingo back; and they insisted that it was necessary to make an example, and disqualify both the marquis and his jockey.  Still one weighty circumstance pleaded in M. de Valorsay's favor--his fortune, or, at least, the fortune he was supposed to possess.  \\\"Why should such a rich man stoop to cheat?\\\" asked his defenders.  \\\"To put money into one's pocket in this way is even worse than to cheat at cards! Besides, it's impossible! Valorsay is above such contemptible charges.  He is a perfect gentleman.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps so,\\\" replied the skeptical bystanders.  \\\"But people said exactly the same of Croisenois, of the Duc de H., and Baron P., who were finally convicted of the same rascality that Valorsay is accused of.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's an infamous slander! If he had been inclined to cheat, he could have easily diverted suspicion.  He would have let Domingo come in second, not third!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If he were not guilty, and afraid of detection, he wouldn't pay forfeit to-day nor sell his horses.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He only retires from the turf because he's going to marry----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nonsense! That's no reason whatever.\\\"\\n\\nLike all gamblers, the frequenters of the turf are distrustful and inclined to be quarrelsome.  No one is above their suspicions when they lose nor above their wrath when they are duped.  And this Domingo affair united all the losers against Valorsay; they formed a little battalion of enemies who were no doubt powerless for the time being, but who were ready to take a startling revenge whenever a good opportunity presented itself.  Naturally enough, M. Wilkie sided with the marquis, whom he had heard his friend, M. de Coralth, speak of on several occasions.  \\\"Accuse the dear marquis!\\\" he exclaimed.  \\\"It's contemptible, outrageous.  Why, only last evening he said to me, 'My good friend, Domingo's defeat cost me two thousand louis!'\\\" M. de Valorsay had said nothing of the kind, for the very good reason that he did not even know Wilkie by sight; still, no one paid much heed to the assertion, whereat Wilkie felt vexed, and resolved to turn his attention to his jockey.\\n\\nThe latter was a lazy, worthless fellow, who had been dismissed from every stable he had previously served in, and who swindled and robbed the young gentlemen who employed him without either limit or shame.  Although he made them pay him a very high salary-- something like eight thousand francs a year--on the plea that it was most repugnant to his feelings to act as a groom, trainer, and jockey at the same time, he regularly every month presented them with fabulous bills from the grain merchant, the veterinary surgeon, and the harness-maker.  In addition, he regularly sold Pompier's oats in order to obtain liquor, and in fact the poor animal was so nearly starved that he could scarcely stand on his legs.  The jockey ascribed the horse's extreme thinness to a system of rigorous training; and the owners did not question the statement in the least.  He had made them believe, and they in turn had made many others believe, that Pompier de Nanterre would certainly win such and such a race; and, trusting in this fallacious promise, they risked their money on the poor animal-- and lost it.\\n\\nIn point of fact, this jockey would have been the happiest mortal in the world if such things as steeple-chases had never existed.  In the first place, he judged, with no little reason, that it was dangerous to leap hurdles on such an animal as Pompier; and, secondly, nothing irritated him so much as to be obliged to promenade with his three employers in turn.  But how could he refuse, since he knew that if these young men hired him, it was chiefly, or only in view of, displaying themselves in his company.  It afforded them untold satisfaction to walk to and fro along the course in front of the grand stand, with their jockey in his orange jacket with green sleeves.  They were firmly convinced that he reflected enormous credit upon them, and their hearts swelled with joy at the thought of the envy they no doubt inspired.  This conviction gave rise indeed to terrible quarrels, in which each of the three owners was wont to accuse the others of monopolizing the jockey.\\n\\nOn this occasion, M. Wilkie--being fortunate enough to arrive the first--immediately repaired to Pompier de Nanterre's stall.  Never had circumstances been more favorable for a display of the animal's speed.  The day was magnificent; the stands were crowded, and thousands of eager spectators were pushing and jostling one another beyond the ropes which limited the course.  M. Wilkie seemed to be everywhere; he showed himself in a dozen different places at once, always followed by his jockey, whom he ordered about in a loud voice, with many excited gesticulations.  And how great his delight was when, as he passed through the crowd, he heard people exclaim: \\\"That gentleman has a racing stable.  His horses are going to compete!\\\" What bliss thrilled his heart when he overheard the admiring exclamation of some worthy shopkeeper who was greatly impressed by the gay silk jacket and the top- boots!\\n\\nBut, unfortunately, this happiness could not last forever.  His partners arrived, and claimed the jockey in their turn.  So M. Wilkie left the course and strolled about among the carriages, until at last he found an equipage which was occupied by the young ladies who had accepted his invitation to supper the evening before, and who were now making a profuse display of the very yellowest hair they possessed.  This afforded him another opportunity of attracting public attention, and to giving proofs of his \\\"form,\\\" for he had not filled the box of his carriage with champagne for nothing.  At last the decisive moment came, and he made himself conspicuous by shouting.  \\\"Now! Now! Here he is! Look! Bravo, Pompier! One hundred on Pompier!\\\"\\n\\nBut, alas! poor Pompier de Nanterre fell exhausted before half the distance was accomplished; and that evening Wilkie described his defeat, with a profusion of technical terms that inspired the uninitiated with the deepest awe.  \\\"What a disaster, my friends,\\\" he exclaimed.  \\\"Pompier de Nanterre, an incomparable steeplechaser, to break down in such a fashion! And beaten by whom? My Mustapha, an outsider, without any record whatever! The ring was intensely excited--and I was simply crazed.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, his defeat did not affect him very deeply.  It was forgotten at thought of the inheritance which his friend Coralth had spoken to him about.  And to-morrow M. de Coralth would tell him the secret.  He had only twenty hours longer to wait!\\\" To- morrow! to-morrow!\\\" he said to himself again and again, with a thrill of mingled joy and impatience.  And what bright visions of future glory haunted him! He saw himself the possessor of a magnificent stud, of sufficient wealth to gratify every fancy; he would splash mud upon all the passers-by, and especially upon his former acquaintances, as he dashed past them in his superb equipage; the best tailor should invent astonishing garments for him; he would make himself conspicuous at all the first performances in a stage-box, with the most notorious women in Paris; his fetes would be described in the papers; he would be the continual subject of comment; he would be credited with splendid, perfect \\\"form.\\\"\\n\\nIt is true that M. de Coralth had promised him all this, without a word of explanation; but what did that matter? Should he doubt his friend's word? Never! The viscount was not merely his model, but his oracle as well.  By the way in which he spoke of him, it might have been supposed that they had been friends from their childhood, or, at least, that they had known each other for years.  Such was not the case, however.  Their acquaintance dated only seven or eight months back, and their first meeting had apparently been the result of chance; though it is needless to say, perhaps, that this chance had been carefully prepared by M. de Coralth.  Having discovered Madame Lia d'Argeles's secret, the viscount watched Wilkie, ascertained where he spent his evenings, contrived a way of introducing himself into his society, and on their third meeting was skilful enough to render him a service--in other words, to lend him some money.  From that moment the conquest was assured; for M. de Coralth possessed in an eminent degree all the attributes that were likely to dazzle and charm the gifted owner of Pompier de Nanterre.  First of all, there was his title, then his impudent assurance and his apparent wealth, and last, but by no means least, his numerous and fashionable acquaintances.  He was not long in discovering his advantage, and in profiting by it.  And without giving M. Wilkie an inkling of the truth, he succeeded in obtaining from him as accurate a knowledge of his past career as the young fellow himself possessed.\\n\\nM. Wilkie did not know much concerning his origin or his early life; and his history, so far as he was acquainted with it, could be told in a few words.  His earliest recollection was of the ocean.  He was sure, perfectly sure, that he had made a very long sea voyage when only a little child, and he looked upon America as his birthplace.  The French language was certainly not the first he had learned, for he still remembered a limited number of English phrases.  The English word \\\"father\\\" was among those that lingered in his memory; and now, after a lapse of twenty years, he pronounced it without the least foreign accent.  But while he remembered the word perfectly well, no recollection remained to him of the person he had called by that name.  His first sensations were those of hunger, weariness, and cold.  He recollected, and very distinctly too, how on one long winter night, a woman had dragged him after her through the streets of Paris, in an icy rain.  He could still see himself as he wandered on, crying with weariness, and begging for something to eat.  And then the poor woman who held him by the hand lifted him in her arms and carried him on--on, until her own strength failed, and she was obliged to set him on the ground again.  A vague portrait of this woman, who was most probably his mother, still lingered in his memory.  According to his description, she was extremely handsome, tall, and very fair.  He had been particularly impressed with the pale tint and profusion of her beautiful hair.\\n\\nTheir poverty had not lasted long.  He remembered being installed with his mother in a very handsome suite of rooms.  A man, who was still young, and whom he called \\\"Monsieur Jacques,\\\" came every day, and brought him sweetmeats and playthings.  He thought he must have been about four years old at that time.  However, he had enjoyed this comfortable state of things scarcely a month, when one morning a stranger presented himself.  The visitor held a long conference with his mother, or, at least, with the person whom he called by that name.  He did not understand what they were talking about, but he was none the less very uneasy.  The result of the interview must have justified his instinctive fear, for his mother took him on her lap, and embraced him with convulsive tenderness.  She sobbed violently, and repeated again and again in a faltering voice: \\\"Poor child! my beloved Wilkie! I shall never kiss you again--never, never! 'Alas! It must be so! Give me courage, my God!\\\"\\n\\nThose were the exact words; Wilkie was sure on that point.  It seemed to him he could still hear that despairing farewell.  For it was indeed a farewell.  The stranger took him in his arms and carried him away, in spite of his cries and struggles to escape.  This person to whose care he was confined was the master of a small boarding-school, and his wife was the kindest and most patient of women.  However, this did not prevent Wilkie from crying and begging for his mother at first; but gradually he forgot her.  He was not unhappy, for he was petted and indulged more than any of the other pupils, and he spent most of his time playing on the terrace or wandering about the garden.  But this charming life could not last for ever.  According to his calculation, he was just ten years old when, one Sunday, toward the end of October, a grave-looking, red-whiskered gentleman, clad in solemn black with a white necktie, presented himself at the school, and declared that he had been instructed by Wilkie's relatives to place him in a college to continue his education.\\n\\nYoung Wilkie's lamentations were long and loud; but they did not prevent M. Patterson--for that was the gentleman's name--from taking him to the college of Louis-the-Great, where he was entered as a boarder.  As he did not study, and as he was only endowed with a small amount of intelligence, he learned scarcely anything during the years he remained there.  Every Sunday and every fete day, M. Patterson made his appearance at ten o'clock precisely, took Wilkie for a walk in Paris or the environs, gave him his breakfast and dinner at some of the best restaurants, bought everything he expressed a desire to have, and at nine o'clock precisely took him back to the college again.  During the holidays M. Patterson kept the boy with him, refusing him nothing in the way of pleasure, granting all his wishes, but never losing sight of him for a moment.  And if Wilkie complained of this constant watchfulness, M. Patterson always replied, \\\"I must obey orders;\\\" and this answer invariably put an end to the discussion.\\n\\nSo things went on until it became time for Wilkie to take his degree.  He presented himself for examination; and, of course, he failed.  Fortunately, however, M. Patterson was not at a loss for an expedient.  He placed his charge in a private school; and the following year, at a cost of five thousand francs, he beguiled a poor devil into running the risk of three years' imprisonment, by assuming M. Wilkie's name, and passing the examination in his place.  In possession of the precious diploma which opens the door of every career, M. Wilkie now hoped that his pockets would be filled, and that he would then be set at liberty.  But the hope was vain! M. Patterson placed him in the hands of an old tutor who had been engaged to travel with him through Europe; and as this tutor held the purse-strings, Wilkie was obliged to follow him through Germany, England, and Italy.\\n\\nWhen he returned to Paris he was just twenty years old, and the very next day M. Patterson conducted him to the suite of rooms which he still occupied in the Rue du Helder.  \\\"You are now in your own home, M. Wilkie,\\\" said M. Patterson in his most impressive manner.  \\\"You are now old enough to be responsible for your own actions, and I hope you will conduct yourself like an honest man.  From this moment you are your own master.  Those who gave you your education desire you to study law.  If I were in your place, I should obey them.  If you wish to be somebody, and to acquire a fortune, work, for you have no property, nor anything to expect from any one.  The allowance which is granted you, a far too liberal one in my opinion, may be cut off at any moment.  I don't think it right to conceal this fact from you.  But at all events until then.  I am instructed to pay you five thousand francs quarterly.  Here is the amount for the first quarter, and in three months' time I shall send you a similar amount.  I say 'shall SEND,' because my business compels me to return to England, and take up my abode there.  Here is my London address; and if any serious trouble befalls you, write to me.  Now, my duty being fulfilled, farewell.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Go to the devil, you old preacher!\\\" growled Wilkie, as he saw the door close on the retreating figure of M. Patterson, who had acted as his guardian for ten years.  None of M. Patterson's wise advice lingered in the young fellow's mind.  To use a familiar expression, \\\"It went in through one ear and came out through the other.\\\" Only two facts had made an impression upon him: that he was to be his own master henceforth, and that he had a fortune at his command.  There it lay upon the table, five thousand francs in glittering gold.\\n\\nIf M. Wilkie had taken the trouble to attentively examine the rooms which had suddenly become his own, he would perhaps have recognized the fact that a loving hand had prepared them for his reception.  Countless details revealed the delicate taste of a woman, and the thoughtful tenderness of a mother.  None of those little superfluities which delight a young man had been forgotten.  There was a box of choice cigars upon the table, and a jar of tobacco on the mantel-shelf.  But Wilkie did not take time to discover this.  He hastily slipped five hundred francs into his pocket, locked the rest of his money in a drawer, and went out with as lofty an air as if all Paris belonged to him, or as if he had enough money to purchase it.\\n\\nHe had resolved to give a fete in honor of his deliverance, and so he hurried off in search of some of his old college chums.  He found two of them; and, although it was very wounding to his self- love, M. Wilkie was obliged to confess to them that this was his first taste of liberty, and that he scarcely knew what to do with himself.  Of course his friends assured him that they could quickly make him acquainted with the only life that it was worth while living; and, to prove it, they accepted the invitation to dinner which he immediately offered them.  It was a remarkable repast.  Other acquaintances dropped in, the wine flowed in rivers; and after dinner they danced.  And at day-break, having served his apprenticeship at baccarat, M. Wilkie found himself without a penny in his pocket, and face to face with a bill of four hundred francs, for which amount he was obliged to go to his rooms, under the escort of one of the waiters.  This first experiment ought to have disgusted him, or at least have made him reflect.  But no.  He felt quite in his element in the society of dissipated young men and enamelled women.  He swore that he would win a place in their midst, and an influential place too.  But it was easier to form this plan than to carry it into execution, as he discovered when, at the end of the month, he counted his money to see what remained of the five thousand francs that had been given him for his quarterly allowance.  He had just three hundred francs left.\\n\\nTwenty thousand francs a year is what one chooses to make it-- wealth or poverty.  Twenty thousand francs a year represents about sixty francs a day; but what are sixty francs to a high liver, who breakfasts and dines at the best restaurants, whose clothes are designed by an illustrious tailor, who declines to make a pair of trousers for less than a hundred francs? What are three louis a day to a man who hires a box for first performances at the opera, to a man who gambles and gives expensive suppers, to a man who drives out with yellow-haired demoiselles, and who owns a race- horse? Measuring his purse and his ambition, M. Wilkie discovered that he should never succeed in making both ends meet.  \\\"How do other people manage?\\\" he wondered.  A puzzling question! Every evening a thousand gorgeously apparelled gentlemen, with a cigar in their mouth and a flower in their button-hole, may be seen promenading between the Chaussee d'Antin and the Faubourg Montmartre.  Everybody knows them, and they know everybody, but how they exist is a problem which it is impossible to solve.  How do they live, and what do they live on? Everybody knows that they have no property; they do nothing, and yet they are reckless in their expenditures, and rail at work and jeer at economy.  What source do they derive their money from? What vile business are they engaged in?\\n\\nHowever, M.  Wilkie did not devote much time to solving this question.  \\\"My relatives must wish me to starve,\\\" he said to himself.  \\\"Not I--I'm not that sort of a person, as I'll soon let them know.\\\" And thereupon he wrote to M. Patterson.  By return of post that gentleman sent him a cheque for one thousand francs--a mere drop in the bucket.  M. Wilkie felt indignant and so he wrote again.  This time he was obliged to wait for a reply.  Still at last it came.  M. Patterson sent him two thousand francs, and an interminable epistle full of reproaches.  The interesting young man threw the letter into the fire, and went out to hire a carriage by the month and a servant.\\n\\nFrom that day forward, his life was spent in demanding money and waiting for it.  He employed in quick succession every pretext that could soften the hearts of obdurate relatives, or find the way to the most closely guarded cash-box.  He was ill--he had contracted a debt of honor--he had imprudently lent money to an unscrupulous friend--he was about to be arrested for debt.  And in accordance with the favorable or unfavorable character of the replies his manner became humble or impertinent, so that his friends soon learned to judge very accurately of the condition of his purse by the way he wore his mustaches.  He became wise with experience, however; and on adding all the sums he had received together, he decided that his family must be very rich to allow him so much money.  And this thought made him anxious to fathom the mystery of his birth and his infancy.  He finally persuaded himself that he was the son of a great English nobleman--a member of the House of Lords, who was twenty times a millionaire.  And he more than half believed it when he told his creditors that his lordship, his father, would some day or other come to Paris and pay all his debts.  Unfortunately it was not M. Wilkie's noble father that arrived, but a letter from M. Patterson, which was couched as follows:\\n\\n\\\"MY DEAR SIR, a considerable sum was placed in my hands to meet your unexpected requirements; and in compliance with your repeated appeals, I have remitted the entire amount to you.  Not a penny remains in my possession--so that my instructions have been fulfilled.  Spare yourself the trouble of making any fresh demands; they will meet with no reply.  In future you will not receive a penny above your allowance, which in my opinion is already too large a one for a young man of your age.\\\"\\n\\nThis letter proved a terrible blow to Wilkie.  What should he do? He felt that M. Patterson would not revoke his decision; and indeed he wrote him several imploring letters, in vain.  Yet never had his need of money been so urgent.  His creditors were becoming uneasy; bills actually rained in upon his concierge; his next quarterly allowance was not due for some time to come, and it was only through the pawnbroker that he could obtain money for his more pressing requirements.  He had begun to consider himself ruined.  He saw himself reduced to dismissing his carriage, to selling his third share of Pompier de Nanterre and losing the esteem of all his witty friends.\\n\\nHe was in the depths of despair, when one morning his servant woke him up with the announcement that the Viscount de Coralth was in the sitting-room and wished to speak with him on very important business.  It was not usually an easy task to entice M. Wilkie from his bed, but the name his servant mentioned seemed to have a prodigious effect upon him.  He bounded on to the floor, and as he hastily dressed himself, he muttered: \\\"The viscount here, at this hour! It's astonishing! What if he's going to fight a duel and wishes me to be his second? That would be a piece of grand good luck and no mistake.  It would assure my position at once.  Certainly something must have happened!\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1640139498,\"title\":\"\\nThis objection had previously presented itself to Pascal's mind, and he had found an explanation \"},\"digest\":\"04ldAMgyipxLx6fi5ur5Kj27_DL4Ep883CGmugZpNbQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6961235d2e95818F7a1E230634bC24de80Bd6f6a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NC8q73LxTHbmv6eaSQKbHhap62tkp-JM7EnmSWBjASw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1aUvaUfEwinKs6sbnEYRa52GowAsRJYUU8boac2v_DU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ZAF8ZRwmB4mXxANwKtwJeKOEj01p6gD-cMcnZ1EWPpp-Da6e6X0YGc_koit0_o9DKL16Q4Z7uDoD33jPsfOCUQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2d2225b153c22f66c167dbe5c0db09d8cd26f2da05a6ee5777265ff38e50d1065e4f44cd492d6a7d6b46704ae804e4f8f16c806bedc78103232d2678e63c8b531c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NC8q73LxTHbmv6eaSQKbHhap62tkp-JM7EnmSWBjASw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1aUvaUfEwinKs6sbnEYRa52GowAsRJYUU8boac2v_DU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"04ldAMgyipxLx6fi5ur5Kj27_DL4Ep883CGmugZpNbQ\"}"
