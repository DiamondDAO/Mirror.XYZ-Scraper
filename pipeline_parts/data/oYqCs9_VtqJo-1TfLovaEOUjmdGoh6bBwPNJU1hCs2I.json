It is in this last sense that the Sun is negatively entropic — that is, from the perspective of any life-form receiving and using this free source of significant and higher-frequency local energy.\\n\\nWhen we speak about life being negatively entropic, we do not mean in exactly the same way that a star is. We are referring to life’s capacity to consume and recycle the free energy from a star (in the Earth’s case from the Sun) to create unique information, to do work, to recycle matter. To recycle death.\\n\\nLike the Sun in its burning, life processes create entropy, but the entropy created is more like a waste product to life-forms (in that the energy used and recycled becomes an increasingly less useful form of energy as it flows). So, life processes borrow usable energy from the Sun for some time and use it within life-forms that require it to stay alive and to perpetuate the life-cycle (to create new life-forms).\\n\\nPausing there for a moment, the astute reader may have noticed that stars, like the Sun, appear to be acting contrary to the second law of thermodynamics.\\n\\n*If it is improbable for sand on a beach to spontaneously rearrange itself into a sand-castle (or a sandy Taj Mahal), how can randomly distributed hydrogen atoms in a vast cloud in space arrange themselves into such tightly structured and useful stars?*\\n\\n## \\n\\n![Rich Mazzola, “What is entropy?

For example with just 50 states, the odds of observing the least likely arrangement is 1 in 132,931,168,175. Now imagine the sand castle has hundreds of millions[\\\\[30\\\\]](#_ftn30) of grains of sand.”[\\\\[31\\\\]](#_ftn31)**\\n\\nIf entropy tends always to increase, I wondered whether stars were an example of an eddy in the entropy flow (a temporary reversal), where entropy decreases for a short time even though it is still ultimately tending to maximum entropy.\\n\\nMy initial understanding was that the gravitational forces involved in the creation of stars and in forcing atoms together (which more than overwhelms the energy required in the star formation process) are greater than the energy required to force fusion reactions. They are. I also thought that when all of these different energies were combined, the total entropy in the star formation process would have temporarily decreased, as the end result is a configuration of matter that is more concentrated and structured. Apparently, this is not how entropy works.\\n\\n**“This is another common source of confusion, because a condensed cloud seems more ‘ordered’ than a dispersed one. It isn’t, because the speed of the molecules of a dispersed cloud are all small (in an ordered manner), while, when the cloud condenses, the speeds of the molecules increase and spread in phase space. The molecules concentrate in physical space but disperse in phase space, which is the relevant one.”**\\n\\n(*Carlo Rovelli*)[\\\\[32\\\\]](#_ftn32)\\n\\n*So where did I go wrong?*\\n\\nLow entropy is not necessarily about the increased complexity or structure of a configuration of matter (i.e., reduced uniformity). Entropy is apparently lowest, even when matter is uniformly distributed, if it is in a very small phase space (e.g., conditions near the Big Bang) and it is highest when matter is massively dispersed in phase space (for example, an older universe with stars, solar systems, galaxies, clusters and black holes with lots of ‘empty’ space in between — the one we live in).[\\\\[33\\\\]](#_ftn33)\\n\\nEntropy is always about the number of possible microstates the matter may be in and the difficulty in ascertaining that information. In the example of the star versus the dispersed hydrogen cloud, the momentum of the matter in the star (being its mass multiplied by its velocity) gives rise to more possible microstates for the matter.\\n\\nThe definition of phase space incorporates these additional values in momentum, and so the possible microstates for the arrangements of atoms increases in phase-space (the denser space-time).[\\\\[34\\\\]](#_ftn34)\\n\\nIn addition, the Sun creates new matter, like helium and heavier atoms, and unlocks energy trapped in hydrogen and other atoms in the process. The unlocked energy further interacts with the existing matter in the star (heating it up). This all adds to the complexity of the number of possible microstates of all matter within a star system compared to a colder and widely distributed but more leisurely cloud of hydrogen atoms.\\n\\nFor these reasons, it has been suggested that black holes are sources of maximum entropy since there appears to be no way of knowing or estimating the number of possible microstates of any matter that falls through the event horizon; nor is there any way to get useful energy back from it.[\\\\[35\\\\]](#_ftn35) There appears to be no further extractable specific or probabilistic information available about that matter.[\\\\[36\\\\]](#_ftn36)\\n\\nIn order to maintain the cosmic accounting balance, black holes must be sources of great entropy; at least as perceived from this universe.\\n\\n![Caravaggio, “The Cardsharps”, 1594 CE, Wikipedia, public domain.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\\\*2k2w-4SWHKfyh151FttS8g.jpeg)\\n\\nLet us revisit our simple pack of cards. As discussed, the probability of having 26 red cards dealt in consecutive order from a well-shuffled pack is extraordinarily low.\\n\\nNote what happens after card 26 is dealt — all of that initial unlikeliness is now balanced by a near-absolute certainty (in probability terms) that the next 26 cards will be black.\\n\\nThat is, the total number of microstates (if the colour black is the only quality in question) for the remaining cards is now 1. The initial improbability of the system is mirrored by the extremely unusual amount of information those initial conditions give us about the nature or microstates of the remaining cards.\\n\\n*Is the extreme improbability of 26 black cards being dealt first just another way of highlighting the universal law that makes it nearly impossible to know the future?*[\\\\[37\\\\]](#_ftn37)\\n\\nThe universe appears to go to great lengths in its laws to avoid absolute pre-determinacy at all scales. In the example of the first 26 cards being red, whatever configuration the next 26 cards are in, we know — without doing any more work — that each card dealt will be black.\\n\\nThere is zero entropy, in information terms, within the remaining pack in respect of the quality or value ‘black’. All of the randomness of a well-shuffled deck of cards has effectively been removed. Such an improbable initial configuration has given rise to information certainty about the remainder. This move from very high initial uncertainty to absolute certainty of the colour of the cards as they are dealt gives us a simple general sense of what entropy and negative entropy are in information terms.\\n\\n*Why might this be relevant to freedom of action and the ethics of life for life-forms?*\\n\\n**“David Layzer … made it clear that in an expanding universe the entropy would increase, as required by the second law of thermodynamics, but that the maximum possible entropy of the universe might increase faster than the actual entropy increase. This would leave room for an increase of order or information at the same time the entropy is increasing!”\\\\[38\\\\]**\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\\\*mQVqLLB88hJ-kbhWe0doqg.png?&&&&&size=medium)\\n\\nDavid Layzer, “[Arrow of Time](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/problems/arrow_of_time/)”, The Information Philosopher, date unknown\\n\\nLife is an emergent complex property that can arise, within a window of opportunity, due to the interplay between different types and locations of energy and matter and the way in which this creates opportunities from the perspective of life-forms.\\n\\nLife lives in the delta between the difficulty of knowing or doing anything useful and an increase in available information we have about this condition. At first this seems counter-intuitive since the aggregate information entropy must increase with general cosmic entropy (thermodynamic equilibrium) but, as with life-forms’ use of usable energy in this overall process, information about the past is useful and we can make measurements to guess at or even mould likely futures.\\n\\n‘Reality’ therefore unfolds with increasing potential information and memory about what has happened and increased uncertainty about what is happening or going to happen (an increase in aggregate microstatic uncertainty).[\\\\[39\\\\]](#_ftn39)\\n\\nThe current success of life-forms is despite the fact that the universe appears to ultimately be headed towards a condition of maximum entropy (death to any life-forms), where there is likely to be no more useful matter, energy or information from the perspective of any life-forms that are still alive in this universe through the next 10¹⁰⁶ years or so i.e., this number of years:[\\\\[40\\\\]](#_ftn40)\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*rk3xsGCx0JAA74oPU0nx4w.png)\\n\\n**“But entropy, heat, past and future are qualities that belong not to the fundamental grammar of the world but to our superficial observation of it. ‘If I observe the microscopic state of things,’ writes Rovelli, ‘then the difference between past and future vanishes … in the elementary grammar of things, there is no distinction between “cause” and “effect””[\\\\[41\\\\]](#_ftn41)**\\n\\nWhilst we must be very careful to avoid bringing this tricksy second law into potentially subjective definitions of order and structure, in respect of using free energy, doing useful work and creating the conditions for greater freedom of action to do work, we should be on somewhat safer ground.[\\\\[42\\\\]](#_ftn42)\\n\\nBy living and evolving through variation, life-forms create useful information, and this gives rise to other complex life-forms (utility engines).

It can only keep aloof from it, i.e. alive, by continually drawing from its environment negative entropy — which is something very positive as we shall immediately see. What an organism feeds upon is negative entropy.”**\\n\\n(*Erwin Schrödinger*)[\\\\[48\\\\]](#_ftn48)\\n\\nAs such, life always has some potentially measurable impact on its environment and some value, even using a strictly utilitarian approach for all living things (whether sapient, sentient or otherwise).\\n\\nIt may be that our understanding of entropy is still nascent and, given the equivalence of matter and energy by E = mc2, the differences between the entropy of matter in an expanding, ‘cooling’ universe is cancelled out eventually by a decrease in gravitational entropy of the whole system as it collapses or gravity ceases to apply (there being no matter with which to bend space-time and conceptualise any space between things).\\n\\nPerhaps material and energy entropy are just the two faces of an underlying unity. They may always sum to zero entropy again when all matter and energy recombine — such as at a singularity, whether at the event horizon of each black hole, the pre-Big Bang singularity or at the end of this current universal epoch.[\\\\[49\\\\]](#_ftn49)\\n\\n*Perhaps our universe is just one bounded localised bubble within a sea of infinite possibility?*\\n\\n![Peter Pink-Howitt, “If light must snake and oscillate“, algo-art, 2021 CE](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AJG4Ak02JsbE4eCvxO3Xk.jpeg?height=1280&width=2304&size=medium)\\n\\n![Peter Pink-Howitt \\\\[50\\\\]](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AoezAsV60a9DoaYZjXpfY.png?height=646&width=1598&&&&size=medium)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\ncontinued in:\\n\\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x6e2fBc139e37b43f4F29cC10B7BeDe36587f7306/rnVTcJwODI44mQkllVSjfsrepD1KzNjMMp7Z9A6T7Hk](https://mirror.xyz/0x6e2fBc139e37b43f4F29cC10B7BeDe36587f7306/rnVTcJwODI44mQkllVSjfsrepD1KzNjMMp7Z9A6T7Hk)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n[\\\\[30\\\\]](#_ftnref30) To really hurt your head with numbers, each grain of sand consists of approximately 2 x 10¹⁹ or 20,000,000,000,000,000 000 atoms.\\n\\n[\\\\[31\\\\]](#_ftnref31) “The probability that the sand pile would blow away and land as a sand castle, the least likely random arrangement, is almost incalculably low.
