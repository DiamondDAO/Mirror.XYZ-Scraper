"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"While the majority of NFTs currently exist on Ethereum, the current scalability and high gas fee issues of Ethereum have artists and collectors looking elsewhere.  Here are 5 reasons why Tezos could be the future primary blockchain for NFT’s:\\n\\n1. The Tezos ecosystem continues to attract more top NFT generative artists including  [Helena Sarin](https://www.neuralbricolage.com/), [Matt DesLauriers](https://www.mattdesl.com/), [Sutu (Stuart Campbell)](https://www.sutueatsflies.com/), and [Iskra Velitchkova](http://iskraovelitchkova.com/), and others.  Generative art is rising in popularity after ArtBlocks brought computer-generated AI artwork massive popularity on the Ethereum ecosystem.\\n2. Tezos is positioning itself as an energy-efficient blockchain with a Proof-of-Stake model, fast transaction times, and affordable gas fees.  While the demand remains sustainable for Tezos, the gas fees are extremely affordable especially in comparison to other L1 blockchains.\\n3. Top NFT marketplace Rarible is aiming to integrate with the Tezos blockchain.  Other NFT marketplaces will likely follow suit as OpenSea has already announced a coming integration with Tezos back in February, and NFTrade announced a future integration a day ago.\\n4. Developer activity on Tezos is hitting all-time high’s with over 5 million contracts calls in a single month, almost 4x as high as the previous high in March 2021.\\n5. Musicians are gravitating toward Tezos including Doja Cat, Quincy Jones, John Legend, and now Linkin Park frontman Mike Shinoda is launching a new generative, 5,000 set NFT series titled *Ziggurats*. The project will hit Tezos on December 3rd on a dedicated site, ziggurats.xyz.\",\"timestamp\":1638224412,\"title\":\"Five Reasons Why Tezos Could be the Main Blockchain for NFTs\"},\"digest\":\"JjltIA8Zc1UQpRXBBU2E1Hmnai6l_YsGU4eZAR-kFHI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x79bD66139531c886620bC41fF29F112f326f1d89\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xdLe7lkBUJVnaIVu9g37vQv8P2auH19CcIIegwU5Fz4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eossABG9FXJtl-pxsrFOWm5WotBnK57vMn_TO5JA_cU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"cXcfJqz9K7C4R1cHdRo0LCNmen9KAKNPu7XDRAHuS0BNtSSXsQNN9Uk5cRFJ3z0QJsXy3l9HInNCLdRs883RUQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x76f5064cd20608226ba635ea068bbf84a89afde6b723baec198b8bb0901e4ae064e2c3965d20b90332770f20ee14e6f1b6687650fb67749180e8c407d2aab9b41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xdLe7lkBUJVnaIVu9g37vQv8P2auH19CcIIegwU5Fz4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eossABG9FXJtl-pxsrFOWm5WotBnK57vMn_TO5JA_cU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"JjltIA8Zc1UQpRXBBU2E1Hmnai6l_YsGU4eZAR-kFHI\"}"
