"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Some people always feel that God is unfair and lonely, saying that those excellent people have their own awesome circles. If they don't have that circle, they are nothing. It seems very correct. For example, when Yu Minhong entered Peking University, he had students like Xu Xiaoping and Wang Qiang, and then he became New Oriental. But I want to say that first of all, Yu Minhong was admitted to Peking University from a rural area and became friends with excellent people. This proved that Yu Minhong was an excellent person.\\n\\n```\\nOnly you are a good person, and other good people are willing to make friends with you. If you are not good, then it makes little sense to scour all kinds of awesome circles.\\n\\nThe better the circle, the smarter everyone is. On the surface, people in excellent circles are easy to touch, approachable, and courteous, but in fact, this is not the case. It's because they have to do this so as not to offend people. To really have a deep friendship with good people, you must also be a good person, and you must be able to deal with them. Whether it is spiritual or material.\\n\\nSociety is originally a trading system. Don't expect good people to do business at a loss. Being together is mutual benefit. This can also show from another angle that if you are of little value, unwilling or unable to make corresponding contributions, then you will not be able to make friends of the corresponding level.\\n\\nSo I don't recommend entrepreneurs to go outside to mix in the boss circle, business circle, because it is meaningless and it's a waste of time.\\n\\nEveryone is shrewd like a ghost. It is the right thing to concentrate on expanding your business and doing your own thing well.\\n```\\n\\nWhen you do your business well and do your own business well, you will be surprised to find that your circle will increase with your career. Excellent people will naturally gather around you, and those who are not good will automatically stay away from you. Even if everyone is together at the beginning, those who are not good will automatically fall behind. And if you wholeheartedly want to rely on others to make a fortune, you want to mix in some circles and try to change your social status and economic status, the result will only be in vain.\\n\\n```\\nEven if you get into a high-end circle by luck, you can only be a poor bug in that circle.\\n\\nOf course, if you are purely trying to get into the high-end circle to learn some experience, I think you can also mix in the circle for a short time. To sum up in one sentence, things are gathered by similarities, and people are divided by groups. Entrepreneurs must be more practical and have dreams, but they must implement them step by step as planned.\\n```\",\"timestamp\":1634803983,\"title\":\"People have good friends because they are good\"},\"digest\":\"uKasKI202KePQLTEtcmrPk_Du-37ycEMvbLFo5fb4Ds\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0B27cE1053585ef548Cd78618Ee0b73D84246712\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FWHKuUadZNUD2AcIaH2jGL63PlPKxJxdB2P-UVSGKyo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TGI_NAnOwHtvZb-9m7wqNj24YxnrIjurKisiIm7dHV0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"SZWjmH4Rq45maGbp_8tPcIem9FgdnbG05sYC35gT00MOIr3Dm6RgXqLFgaGwa3bvk5RZivAH-qtAfcU1DBnAaQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9d86f85b2660a8cb6873525924f9adb0c5f51dfb6229fed7a757ade2793c2f19347cb8076af39b12116743e30b34d1bacb42c80a0030cd272dd62c1ad0ad21081b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FWHKuUadZNUD2AcIaH2jGL63PlPKxJxdB2P-UVSGKyo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TGI_NAnOwHtvZb-9m7wqNj24YxnrIjurKisiIm7dHV0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"uKasKI202KePQLTEtcmrPk_Du-37ycEMvbLFo5fb4Ds\"}"
