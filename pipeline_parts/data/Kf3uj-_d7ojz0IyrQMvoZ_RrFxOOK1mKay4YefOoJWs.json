"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Which is more important, the spiritual world or the material world? If the metauniverse continues to develop, does the interaction in reality still make sense? NFT's fomo sentiment led to a sharp rise, which is speculation based on the access threshold of the future world. Gamefi complements the economic cycle of the future world. It's too big to discuss the feasibility of the meta universe. Let's talk about reality. \\\"How to make money in gamefi?\\\". I have communicated with some new gamefi players recently. We are most concerned about where to find the project and where the revenue comes from. The following two issues are discussed: where to find gamefi? It is important to participate in the new chain tour. Once the players and popularity of a gamefi project are relatively high, the ecology in the game will reach a balanced state, and new players will face a large number of \\\"play earn\\\" competitors. At the peak of our well-known axie infinity, there were millions of daily users and millions of players. Among them, there must be people who know more about games, teams and economic models. The income space of latecomers is very small, and even many times they are providing income for head players, or more commonly, they are \\\"taking orders\\\". Keeping up with a core gamefi circle is an important shortcut to reduce the cost of information acquisition. Ouyi okex chain tour tribe（ <https://t.me/OKExGameFiCN> ）It is the most professional chain game player community I have found at present. Leaders in the telegraph group often share the latest chain games, game tutorials, token acquisition and sales tutorials, etc. As the saying goes, many people have great power. Standing on the shoulders of giants can always get the latest chain travel information more conveniently. Public chain benefits are also very important to the current gamefi project. At present, the OEC public chain focuses on supporting the gamefi sector and has established a support fund of US $350 million. At present, the online projects do have both game and wealth benefits. They are very popular, such as cryptogladiator (Gladiator). 80000 registered users and 12000 players have been online for 3 days, and the results are quite good. If you want to find a fast screening and feasible chain game project in the chain game field, it is a good choice to follow the footsteps of OEC and study the new games on the chain. Where does gamefi benefit from? Like defi, if you don't know who will provide the revenue of your gamefi, you will probably become the one who will provide the revenue. Understanding the source of revenue and making good use of it is the key to sustainable revenue in the gamefi field. To some extent, gamefi's revenue channel is the collection of traditional games and traditional defi. To sum up, the current chain game revenue probably comes from the following five directions: market revenue, investment revenue, mechanism understanding revenue, advantageous resources revenue and news revenue. Market revenue the market revenue of gamefi project mainly comes from the big market of currency circle and the big market of gamefi plate. The so-called big currency market, the rise of mainstream currencies, opens the so-called big or small bull market, and the rise of all tokens drives the rise of project tokens. Gamefi plate market is often an opportunity for a major project to go online or good, which has attracted more people's attention and understanding. Of course, the gains based on the market are partly due to the rise of mainstream currencies, which has raised the threshold of the game for the participants in the game, and the silence cost has increased. The so-called no selling is a rise. One of the main differences between investment income gamefi projects and traditional games is that most projects have access barriers. It is often the purchase of NFT to open the road of gold. Once the rise in the price of tokens leads to high gold income, long return cycle, or the increase in the threshold floor price caused by more users' entry, it will directly lead to. Like the defi two pools, once the system causes users' fomo mood, the price of NFT that already holds the key threshold in the game will rise rapidly, and the probability of token will also rise. Many investors only watch and don't play (only buy threshold NFT or hold tokens) is also interested in the investment income of the whole sector. Mechanism understanding most of the money making places in the revenue game are not written on the surface. In the traditional game ecology, many businessmen find another way to make money from the rules of the game. For example, DNF Antun version of magic brake stone and reinforced mat; World of warcraft gold coin reselling; Jianling artillery orchid version of the boss car; Even the heroic League. As long as there are probability, human cost, key resources and economic circulation channels, there will be all kinds of ways to make money. If you want to earn this part of money, you need to have a very in-depth understanding of the game mechanism. The reason why it is easier to find such income space in the chain game field is also related to its current access threshold. The benefits based on game understanding that can be seen include PVP control points of axie infinity, cross account brush level reselling of OEC Gladiator heroes, and so on. Each sector of gamefi project is easier to be directly related to revenue, so we can seize the rare opportunity by taking the opportunity to deeply study the game mechanism and find revenue points. From a certain point of view, gamefi actually uses manpower to replace the mining of traditional electricity. There is a role of \\\"moving bricks\\\" in the traditional game ecology. In order to save time or achieve goals stronger and faster, many people often trade in the form of \\\"krypton gold\\\", which is also the most direct source of income for the \\\"moving bricks\\\" industry. From the perspective of gamefi's leading project, axis project, I know that many studios may hold dozens of hundreds of equipment and accounts, operate at the same time, complete daily tasks, receive SLP and obtain income. At the same time, multi terminal operation and even script operation can greatly reduce labor costs and obtain higher income. The YGG trade union, as we know it, is also making use of its human advantages to obtain benefits in various chain game projects. The lower labor cost in the game is actually the same as the lower mining electricity fee. At present, the overall development of gamefi is not very mature, and because of its heavily related economic model, the project party often adjusts the rules according to the current market environment and in-game environment. The adjustment of rules is often very large for the economic system in the game, so if you can know the trend of the project party or the rule change plan in advance, you may take the opportunity to obtain huge benefits. In essence, it is similar to tracking the trend of the project side of tokens, but because the rule changes in gamefi have a greater and more direct impact, there is also a greater impact and income space. Gamefi ecology is actually an economy highly similar to the real economic ecology. Only by being more confident, hardworking, studying and keen can we get higher benefits.\",\"timestamp\":1636938686,\"title\":\"How to make money in the hot gamefi field\"},\"digest\":\"6VqG-X2m4mqfVMDffG62aJ9Ii_tsMRyMv4O_rx_KqIA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x174459460A65Dac1242793534dAf9502B0168ab0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Sp1lveAPpg4rHCmAqTL27vwv5eONFBRnrLZPjqJ-hGs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"74pFvIBCRw9-xI_fklXAQbaVqPtes0CbVdIz2-4txW4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"XTZ7DGcwRt91siMjrdECwurB2nkk1TCwSBAVtgb-VyCpN3IfnHqabRtzxrTEb_-GmHN84AMKk-s0DvzRnAfQ_Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe770dfa65e6081282e102729142f613b40e16c545a65701205e113d1b3124363745e5fc522af036bcfca8c3988f63aa671d5e3642283acef26cc90e6bfad25641c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Sp1lveAPpg4rHCmAqTL27vwv5eONFBRnrLZPjqJ-hGs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"74pFvIBCRw9-xI_fklXAQbaVqPtes0CbVdIz2-4txW4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"6VqG-X2m4mqfVMDffG62aJ9Ii_tsMRyMv4O_rx_KqIA\"}"
