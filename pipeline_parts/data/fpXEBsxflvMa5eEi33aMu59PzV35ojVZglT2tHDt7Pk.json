"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"But presently she found him looking gravely at her again.\\n\\n\\\"Signora,\\\" he began, \\\"the Signorina loves the island.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Gaspare.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you love it?\\\"\\n\\nThe question startled her. Had he read her thoughts in the last days?\\n\\n\\\"Don't you think I love it?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\\"You go away from it very often, Signora.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I must occasionally go in to Naples!\\\" she protested.\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signora.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, but mustn't I?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Non lo so, Signora. Perhaps we have been here long enough. Perhaps we had better go away from here.\\\"\\n\\nHe spoke slowly, and with something less than his usual firmness, as if in his mind there was uncertainty, some indecision or some conflict of desires.\\n\\n\\\"Do you want to go away?\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"It is not for me to want, Signora.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't think the Signorina would like to go, Gaspare. She hates the idea of leaving the island.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Signorina is not every one,\\\" he returned.\\n\\nHabitually blunt as Gaspare was, Hermione had never before heard him speak of Vere like this, not with the least impertinence, but with a certain roughness. To-day it did not hurt her. Nor, indeed, could it ever have hurt her, coming from some one so proven as Gaspare. But to-day it even warmed her, for it made her feel that some one was thinking exclusively of her--was putting her first. She longed for some expression of affection from some one. She felt that she was starving for it. And this feeling made her say:\\n\\n\\\"How do you mean, Gaspare?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Signora, it is for you to say whether we shall go away or stay here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You--you put me first, Gaspare?\\\"\\n\\nShe was ashamed of herself for saying it. But she had to say it.\\n\\n\\\"First, Signora? Of course you are first.\\\"\\n\\nHe looked genuinely surprised.\\n\\n\\\"Are you not the Padrona?\\\" he added. \\\"It is for you to command.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. But I don't quite mean that.\\\"\\n\\nShe stopped. But she had to go on:\\n\\n\\\"I mean, would you rather do what I wanted than what any one else wanted?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signora--much rather.\\\"\\n\\nThere was more in his voice than in his words.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you, Gaspare,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Signora,\\\" he said, \\\"if you think we had better leave the island, let us leave it. Let us go away.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, but I have never said I wished to go. I am--\\\" she paused. \\\"I have been very contented to be here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Va bene, Signora.\\\"\\n\\nWhen they reached the island Hermione felt nervous--almost as if she were to meet strangers who were critical, who would appraise her and be ready to despise her. She told herself that she was mad to feel like that; but when she thought of Emile and Vere talking of her failure--of their secret combined action to keep from her the knowledge of the effort of the child--that seemed just then to her a successful rivalry concealed--she could not dismiss the feeling.\\n\\nShe dreaded to meet Emile and Vere.\\n\\n\\\"I wonder where they are,\\\" she said, as she got out. \\\"Perhaps they are on the cliff, or out in the little boat. I'll go into the house.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Signora, I will go to the seat and see if they are there.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, don't bother--\\\" she began.\\n\\nBut he ran off, springing up the steps with a strong agility, like that of a boy.\\n\\nShe hurried after him and went into the house. After what he had said in the boat she wished to look at herself in the glass, to see if there was anything strange or painful, anything that might rouse surprise, in her appearance. She gained her bedroom, and went at once to the mirror.\\n\\nHermione was not by nature at all a self-conscious woman. She knew that she was plain, and had sometimes, very simply, regretted it. But she did not generally think about her appearance, and very seldom now wondered what others were thinking of it. When Maurice had been with her she had often indeed secretly compared her ugliness with his beauty. But a great love breeds many regrets as well as many joys. And that was long ago. It was years since she had looked at herself in the glass with any keen feminine anxiety, any tremor of fear, or any cruel self-criticism. But now she stood for a long time before the glass, quite still, looking at her reflection with wide, almost with staring, eyes.\\n\\nIt was true what Gaspare said. She saw that she was looking ill, very different from her usual strong self. There was not a thread of white in her thick hair, and this fact, combined with the eagerness of her expression, the strong vivacity and intelligence that normally shone in her eyes, deceived many people as to her age. But to-day her face was strained, haggard, and feverish. Under the brown tint that the sunrays had given to her complexion there seemed to lurk a sickly white, which was most markedly suggested at the corner of the mouth. The cheek-bones seemed unusually prominent. And the eyes held surely a depth of uneasiness, of--\\n\\nHermione approached her face to the mirror till it almost touched the glass. The reflected eyes drew hers. She gazed into them with a scrutiny into which she seemed to be pouring her whole force, both of soul and body. She was trying to look at her nature, to see its shape, its color, its expression, so that she might judge of what it was capable--whether for good or evil. The eyes into which she looked both helped her and frustrated her. They told her much--too much. And yet they baffled her. When she would know all, they seemed to substitute themselves for that which she saw through them, and she found herself noticing their size, their prominence, the exact shade of their brown hue. And the quick human creature behind them was hidden from her.\\n\\nBut Gaspare was right. She did look ill. Emile would notice it directly.\\n\\nShe washed her face with cold water, then dried it almost cruelly with a rough towel. Having done this, she did not look again into the glass, but went at once down-stairs. As she came into the drawing-room she heard voices in the garden. She stood still and listened. They were the voices of Vere and Emile talking tirelessly. She could not hear what they said. Had she been able to hear it she would not have listened. She could only hear the sound made by their voices, that noise by which human beings strive to explain, or to conceal, what they really are. They were talking seriously. She heard no sounds of laughter. Vere was saying most. It seemed to Hermione that Vere never talked so much and so eagerly to her, with such a ceaseless vivacity. And there was surely an intimate sound in her voice, a sound of being warmly at ease, as if she spoke in an atmosphere of ardent sympathy.\\n\\nAgain the jealousy came in Hermione, acute, fierce, and travelling-- like a needle being moved steadily, point downwards, through a network of quivering nerves.\\n\\n\\\"Vere!\\\" she called out. \\\"Vere! Emile!\\\"\\n\\nWas her voice odd, startling?\\n\\nThey did not hear her. Emile was speaking now. She heard the deep, booming sound of his powerful voice, that seemed expressive of strength and will.\\n\\n\\\"Vere! Emile!\\\"\\n\\nAs she called again she went towards the window. She felt passionately excited. The excitement had come suddenly to her when they had not heard her first call.\\n\\n\\\"Emile! Emile!\\\" she repeated. \\\"Emile!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Madre!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hermione!\\\"\\n\\nBoth voices sounded startled.\\n\\n\\\"What's the matter?\\\"\\n\\nVere appeared at the window, looking frightened.\\n\\n\\\"Hermione, what is it?\\\"\\n\\nEmile was there beside her. And he, too, looked anxious, almost alarmed.\\n\\n\\\"I only wanted to let you know I had come back,\\\" said Hermione, crushing down her excitement and forcing herself to smile.\\n\\n\\\"But why did you call like that?\\\"\\n\\nVere spoke.\\n\\n\\\"Like what? What do you mean, figlia mia?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It sounded--\\\"\\n\\nShe stopped and looked at Artois.\\n\\n\\\"It frightened me. And you, Monsieur Emile?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I, too, was afraid for a moment that something unpleasant had happened.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You nervous people! Isn't it lunch-time?\\\"\\n\\nAs they looked at her she felt they had been talking about her, about her failure. And she felt, too, as if they must be able to see in her eyes that she knew the secret Vere had wished to keep from her and thought she did not know. Emile had given her a glance of intense scrutiny, and the eyes of her child still questioned her with a sort of bright and searching eagerness.\\n\\n\\\"You make me feel as if I were with detectives,\\\" she said, laughing, but uneasily. \\\"There's really nothing the matter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And your tooth, Madre? Is it better?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, quite well. I am perfectly well. Let us go in.\\\"\\n\\nHermione had said to herself that if she could see Emile and Vere together, without any third person, she would know something that she felt she must know. When she was with them she meant to be a watcher. And now her whole being was strung to attention. But it seemed to her that for some reason they, too, were on the alert, and so were not quite natural. And she could not be sure of certain things unless the atmosphere was normal. So she said to herself now, though before she had had the inimitable confidence of woman in certain detective instincts claimed by the whole sex. At one moment the thing she feared --and her whole being recoiled from the thought of it with a shaking disgust--the thing she feared seemed to her fact. Then something occurred to make her distrust herself. And she felt that betraying imagination of hers at work, obscuring all issues, tricking her, punishing her.\\n\\nAnd when the meal was over she did not know at all. And she felt as if she had perhaps been deliberately baffled--not, of course, by Vere, of whose attitude she was not, and never had been, doubtful, but by Emile.\\n\\nWhen they got up from the table Vere said:\\n\\n\\\"I'm going to take the siesta.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You look remarkably wide awake, Vere,\\\" Artois said, smiling.\\n\\n\\\"But I'm going to, because I've had you all to myself the whole morning. Now it's Madre's turn. Isn't it, Madre?\\\"\\n\\nThe girl's remark showed her sense of their complete triple intimacy, but it emphasized to Hermione her own cruel sense of being in the wilderness. And she even felt vexed that it should be supposed she wanted Emile's company. Nevertheless, she restrained herself from making any disclaimer. Vere went up-stairs, and she and Artois went out and sat down under the trellis. But with the removal of Vere a protection and safety-valve seemed to be removed, and neither Hermione nor Emile could for a moment continue the conversation. Again a sense of humiliation, of being mindless, nothing in the eyes of Artois came to Hermione, diminishing all her powers. She was never a conceited, but she had often been a self-reliant woman. Now she felt a humbleness such as she knew no one should ever feel--a humbleness that was contemptible, that felt itself incapable, unworthy of notice. She tried to resist it, but when she thought of this man, her friend, talking over her failure with her child, in whom he must surely believe, she could not. She felt \\\"Vere can talk to Emile better than I can. She interests him more than I.\\\" And then her years seemed to gather round her and whip her. She shrank beneath the thongs of age, which had not even brought to her those gifts of the mind with which it often partially replaces the bodily gifts and graces it is so eager to remove.\\n\\n\\\"Hermione.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Emile.\\\"\\n\\nShe turned slowly in her chair, forcing herself to face him.\\n\\n\\\"Are you sure you are not feeling ill?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Quite sure. Did you have a pleasant morning with Vere?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. Oh\\\"--he sat forward in his chair--\\\"she told me something that rather surprised me--that you had told her she might read my books.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well?\\\"\\n\\nHermione's voice was rather hard.\\n\\n\\\"Well, I never meant them for 'la jeune fille.' \\\"\\n\\n\\\"You consider Vere--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is she not?\\\"\\n\\nShe felt he was condemning her secretly for her permission to Vere. What would he think if he knew her under-reason for giving it?\\n\\n\\\"You don't wish Vere to read your books, then?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. And I ventured to tell her so.\\\"\\n\\nHermione felt hot.\\n\\n\\\"What did she say?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She said she would not read them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh.\\\"\\n\\nShe looked up and met his eyes, and was sure she read condemnation in them.\\n\\n\\\"After I had told Vere--\\\" she began.\\n\\nShe was about to defend herself, to tell him how she had gone to Vere's room intending to withdraw the permission given; but suddenly she realized clearly that she, a mother, was being secretly taken to task by a man for her conduct to her child.\\n\\nThat was intolerable.\\n\\nAnd Vere had yielded to Emile's prohibition, though she had eagerly resisted her mother's attempt to retreat from the promise made. That was more intolerable.\\n\\nShe sat without saying anything. Her knees were trembling under her thin summer gown. Artois felt something of her agitation, perhaps, for he said, with a kind of hesitating diffidence, very rare in him:\\n\\n\\\"Of course, my friend, I would not interfere between you and Vere, only, as I was concerned, as they were my own writings that were in question--\\\" He broke off. \\\"You won't misunderstand my motives?\\\" he concluded.\\n\\n\\\"Oh no.\\\"\\n\\nHe was more conscious that she was feeling something acutely.\\n\\n\\\"I feel that I perfectly understand why you gave the permission at this particular moment,\\\" he continued, anxious to excuse her to herself and to himself.\\n\\n\\\"Why?\\\" Hermione said, sharply.\\n\\n\\\"Wasn't it because of Peppina?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Peppina?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes; didn't you--\\\"\\n\\nHe looked into her face and saw at once that he had made a false step, that Vere had not told her mother of Peppina's outburst.\\n\\n\\\"Didn't I--what?\\\"\\n\\nHe still looked at her.\\n\\n\\\"What?\\\" she repeated. \\\"What has Peppina to do with it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nothing. Only--don't you remember what you said to me about not keeping Vere in cotton-wool?\\\"\\n\\nShe knew that he was deceiving her. A hopeless, desperate feeling of being in the dark rushed over her. What was friendship without sincerity? Nothing--less than nothing. She felt as if her whole body stiffened with a proud reserve to meet the reserve with which he treated her. And she felt as if her friend of years, the friend whose life she had perhaps saved in Africa, had turned in that moment into a stranger, or--even into an enemy. For this furtive withdrawal from their beautiful and open intimacy was like an act of hostility. She was almost dazed for an instant. Then her brain worked with feverish activity. What had Emile meant? Her permission to Vere was connected in his mind with Peppina. He must know something about Vere and Peppina that she did not know. She looked at him, and her face, usually so sensitive, so receptive, so warmly benign when it was turned to his, was hard and cold.\\n\\n\\\"Emile,\\\" she said, \\\"what was it you meant about Peppina? I think I have a right to know. I brought her into the house. Why should Peppina have anything to do with my giving Vere permission to read your books?\\\"\\n\\nArtois' instinct was not to tell what Vere had not told, and therefore had not wished to be known. Yet he hated to shuffle with Hermione. He chose a middle course.\\n\\n\\\"My friend,\\\" he said quietly, but with determination, \\\"I made a mistake. I was following foolishly a wrong track. Let us say no more about it. But do not be angry with me about the books. I think my motive in speaking as I did to Vere was partly a selfish one. It is not only that I wish Vere to be as she is for as long a time as possible, but that I--well, don't think me a great coward if I say that I almost dread her discovery of all the cruel knowledge that is mine, and that I have, perhaps wrongly, brought to the attention of the world.\\\"\\n\\nHermione was amazed.\\n\\n\\\"You regret having written your books!\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know--I don't know. But I think the happy confidence, the sweet respect of youth, makes one regret a thousand things. Don't you, Hermione? Don't you think youth is often the most terrible tutor age can have?\\\"\\n\\nShe thought of Ruffo singing, \\\"Oh, dolce luna bianca de l' Estate\\\"-- and suddenly she felt that she could not stay any longer with Artois just then. She got up.\\n\\n\\\"I don't feel very well,\\\" she said.\\n\\nArtois sprang up and came towards her with a face full of concern. But she drew back.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't sleep last night--and then going into Naples-- I'll go to my room and lie down. I'll keep quiet. Vere will look after you. I'll be down at tea.\\\"\\n\\nShe went away before he could say or do anything. For some time he was alone. Then Vere came. Hermione had not told her of the episode, and she had only come because she thought the pretended siesta had lasted long enough. When Artois told her about her mother, she wanted to run away at once, and see what was the matter--see if she could do something. But Artois stopped her.\\n\\n\\\"I should leave her to rest,\\\" he said. \\\"I--I feel sure she wishes to be alone.\\\"\\n\\nVere was looking at him while he spoke, and her face caught the gravity of his, reflected it for a moment, then showed an uneasiness that deepened into fear. She laid her hand on his arm.\\n\\n\\\"Monsieur Emile, what is the matter with Madre?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Only a headache, I fancy. She did not sleep last night, and--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, no, the real matter, Monsieur Emile.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you mean, Vere?\\\"\\n\\nThe girl looked excited. Her own words had revealed to her a feeling of which till then she had only been vaguely aware.\\n\\n\\\"Madre has seemed different lately,\\\" she said--\\\"been different. I am sure she has. What is it?\\\"\\n\\nAs the girl spoke, and looked keenly at him with her bright, searching eyes, a thought came, like a flash, upon Artois--a thought that almost frightened him. He could not tell it to Vere, and almost immediately he thrust it away from his mind. But Vere had seen that something had come to him.\\n\\n\\\"You know what it is!\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Monsieur Emile!\\\"\\n\\nHer voice was full of reproach.\\n\\n\\\"Vere, I am telling you the truth,\\\" he said, earnestly. \\\"If there is anything seriously troubling your mother I do not know what it is. She has sorrows, of course. You know that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This is something fresh,\\\" the girl said. She thrust forward her little chin decisively. \\\"This is something new.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It cannot be that,\\\" Artois said to himself. \\\"It cannot be that.\\\"\\n\\nTo Vere he said: \\\"Sleeplessness is terribly distressing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well--but only one night.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps there have been others.\\\"\\n\\nIn reply Vere said:\\n\\n\\\"Monsieur Emile, you remember this morning, when we were in the garden, and mother called?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you know, the way she called made me feel frightened?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We were so busy talking that the sudden sound startled us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, it wasn't that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But when we came your mother was smiling--she was perfectly well. You let your imagination--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, Monsieur Emile, indeed I don't.\\\"\\n\\nHe did not try any more to remove her impression. He saw that to do so would be quite useless.\\n\\n\\\"I should like to speak to Gaspare,\\\" Vere said, after a moment's thought.\\n\\n\\\"Gaspare! Why?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps you will laugh at me! But I often think Gaspare understands Madre better than any of us, Monsieur Emile.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Gaspare has been with your mother a very long time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, and in his way he is very clever. Haven't you noticed it?\\\"\\n\\nArtois did not answer this. But he said:\\n\\n\\\"Follow your instincts, Vere. I don't think they will often lead you wrong.\\\"\\n\\nAt tea-time Hermione came from her bedroom looking calm and smiling. There was something deliberate about her serenity, and her eyes were tired, but she said the little rest had done her good. Vere instinctively felt that her mother did not wish to be observed, or to have any fuss made about her condition, and Artois took Vere's cue. When tea was over, Artois said:\\n\\n\\\"Well, I suppose I ought to be going.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh no,\\\" Hermione said. \\\"We asked you for a long day. That means dinner.\\\"\\n\\nThe cordiality in her voice sounded determined, and therefore formal. Artois felt chilled. For a moment he looked at her doubtfully.\\n\\n\\\"Well, but, Hermione, you aren't feeling very well.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am much better now. Do stay. I shall rest, and Vere will take care of you.\\\"\\n\\nIt struck him for the first time that she was becoming very ready to substitute Vere for herself as his companion. He wondered if he had really offended or hurt her in any way. He even wondered for a moment whether she was not pleased at his spending the summer in Naples-- whether, for some reason, she had wished, and still wished, to be alone with Vere.\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps Vere will get sick of looking after an--an old man,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"You are not an old man, Monsieur Emile. Don't tout!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tout?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, for compliments about your youth. You meant me, you meant us both, to say how young you are.\\\"\\n\\nShe spoke gayly, laughingly, but he felt she was cleverly and secretly trying to smooth things out, to cover up the difficulty that had intruded itself into their generally natural and simple relations.\\n\\n\\\"And your mother says nothing,\\\" said Artois, trying to fall in with her desire, and to restore their wonted liveliness. \\\"Don't you look upon me as almost a boy, Hermione?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think sometimes you seem wonderfully young,\\\" she said.\\n\\nHer voice suggested that she wished to please him, but also that she meant what she said. Yet Artois had never felt his age more acutely than when she finished speaking.\\n\\n\\\"I am a poor companion for Vere,\\\" he said, almost bitterly. \\\"She ought to be with friends of her own age.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You mean that I am a poor companion for you, Monsieur Emile. I often feel how good you are to put up with me in the way you do.\\\"\\n\\nThe gayety had gone from her now, and she spoke with an earnestness that seemed to him wonderfully gracious. He looked at her, and his eyes thanked her gently.\\n\\n\\\"Take Emile out in the boat, Vere,\\\" Hermione said, \\\"while I read a book till dinner time.\\\"\\n\\nAt that moment she longed for them to be gone. Vere looked at her mother, then said:\\n\\n\\\"Come along, Monsieur Emile. I'm sorry for you, but Madre wants rest.\\\"\\n\\nShe led the way out of the room.\\n\\nHermione was on the sofa. Before he followed Vere, Artois went up to her and said:\\n\\n\\\"You are sure you won't come out with us, my friend? Perhaps the air on the sea would do you good.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, thank you, Emile; I really think I had better stay quietly here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1637314987,\"title\":\"He said no more, and rowed steadily on for a while. \"},\"digest\":\"pZ3PqPKtackfAxn8BbqpQ-jaTh175IBO4MTm_LKhSSc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6e5524266431C8A2Cd3e28b5B838834791C3533a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ibEN9vXwq9bcXIpkvkE2Nx13XXN7a5_JEZSQHoC3R8o\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xqSEqTzzlD2_XpC-B4C9mngkN8HIDKL1nnJ3HEPvA_A\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"xPXJP_kiCSP9sByQgfkgWQzjVxAHuMRJ2_2OBT0wkT6vCaswZJVgboe2r8AzxKh7p64N_TFwAB9knLruQP3jTg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xffa28a02d35c1b16cd6caf3dc2d2e3d835ad0f957bf370fc00baebf0e47825992fd9c6ef6ac2ea41e42bbfbfdd48c5af7067f182d9182f63ee925c5a10c49a021b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ibEN9vXwq9bcXIpkvkE2Nx13XXN7a5_JEZSQHoC3R8o\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xqSEqTzzlD2_XpC-B4C9mngkN8HIDKL1nnJ3HEPvA_A\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"pZ3PqPKtackfAxn8BbqpQ-jaTh175IBO4MTm_LKhSSc\"}"
