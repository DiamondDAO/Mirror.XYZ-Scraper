"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"2891, Mars, The Crystal Palaces\\n\\n \\n \\\"It is a wonderful place – vast, strange, new and impossible to describe. Its grandeur does not consist in one thing, but in the unique assemblage of all things... It seems as if only magic could have gathered this mass of wealth from all the ends of the earth ... with such a blaze and contrast of colours and marvellous power of effect.\\\" - Charlotte Bronte, 1851\\n\\nThe \\\"Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations\\\" in 1851 was a global showcase of over 100,000 works of human ingenuity and industry from all over the world.\\n\\nIt was a glass structure which covered 18 acres - a Crystal Palace - with an elm tree at its center.\\n\\nThe myth of a benevolent empire was projected by a temporary building made of glass. If a glass case is more memorable more than the jewels encased, it may be on purpose and the point of it in the first place.\\n\\nAbout 30 Years before April 2X21, Mars.\\n\\nCommander Jacob Chinua Tagore, Sr., retired, was wandering absent-minded, through the showrooms. He watched, streamed and walked through various events, The wealth of the Whole’Verse’s grandeur on display.\\n\\n\\\"Jacob.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Doc. It's been a long time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This is my boy, Al.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's nice to meet you, Al.\\\"\\n\\nJacob shook hands with a very young looking teenager. He had a lot of questions but held his tongue. The Dr. John Cadmus he knew from the Long War was a widower who lost a child.\\n\\nHe knew Cadmus well enough to understand that an in-person meeting down a gravity well was a signal that this was a serious meeting of old friends. He began to sweat.\\n\\nThe last time they were together, the world was on fire, they were fighting for their lives and for everyone they loved. A face from the past sometimes opens doors best kept locked.\",\"timestamp\":1633906366,\"title\":\"2921: 3.8 The Crystal Palaces of Eternity, 2891\"},\"digest\":\"4EyQZz9dkLuuAo862Km1JMa-xPt6BcH3g1s6YYip-6g\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"7Dh1lzGC5sX9x4VqPSrgCYA8BwSlURlO8JfzuiOMqYI4YpNLrYkfGm4aP-uR18VguAQu9zYTv1az4Fu0LlbJGA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"oOxan0UhYaf0HVFDDNt3ErPWSxejIWnKOJhFHfcp-c4\"}"
