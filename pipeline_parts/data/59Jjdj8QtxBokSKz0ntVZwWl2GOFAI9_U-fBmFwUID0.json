"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The Bolsheviki took advantage of this situation, increased their forces to one thousand men and began a forward movement to recover what they had lost, while the remnants of Colonel Kazagrandi's detachment were retreating on Khathyl, where he determined to make his last stand against the Reds.  The inhabitants were loading their movable property with their families into carts and scurrying away from the town, leaving all their cattle and horses to whomsoever should have the power to seize and hold them.  One party intended to hide in the dense larch forest and the mountain ravines not far away, while another party made southward for Muren Kure and Uliassutai.  The morning following our arrival the Mongol official received word that the Red troops had outflanked Colonel Kazagrandi's men and were approaching Khathyl.  The Mongol loaded his documents and his servants on eleven camels and left his yamen. Our Mongol guides, without ever saying a word to us, secretly slipped off with him and left us without camels.  Our situation thus became desperate.  We hastened to the colonists who had not yet got away to bargain with them for camels, but they had previously, in anticipation of trouble, sent their herds to distant Mongols and so could do nothing to help us.  Then we betook ourselves to Dr. V. G. Gay, a veterinarian living in the town, famous throughout Mongolia for his battle against rinderpest.  He lived here with his family and after being forced to give up his government work became a cattle dealer.  He was a most interesting person, clever and energetic, and the one who had been appointed under the Czarist regime to purchase all the meat supplies from Mongolia for the Russian Army on the German Front.  He organized a huge enterprise in Mongolia but when the Bolsheviki seized power in 1917 he transferred his allegiance and began to work with them. Then in May, 1918, when the Kolchak forces drove the Bolsheviki out of Siberia, he was arrested and taken for trial.  However, he was released because he was looked upon as the single individual to organize this big Mongolian enterprise and he handed to Admiral Kolchak all the supplies of meat and the silver formerly received from the Soviet commissars.  At this time Gay had been serving as the chief organizer and supplier of the forces of Kazagrandi.\\n\\nWhen we went to him, he at once suggested that we take the only thing left, some poor, broken-down horses which would be able to carry us the sixty miles to Muren Kure, where we could secure camels to return to Uliassutai.  However, even these were being kept some distance from the town so that we should have to spend the night there, the night in which the Red troops were expected to arrive.  Also we were much astonished to see that Gay was remaining there with his family right up to the time of the expected arrival of the Reds.  The only others in the town were a few Cossacks, who had been ordered to stay behind to watch the movements of the Red troops.  The night came.  My friend and I were prepared either to fight or, in the last event, to commit suicide.  We stayed in a small house near the Yaga, where some workmen were living who could not, and did not feel it necessary to, leave.  They went up on a hill from which they could scan the whole country up to the range from behind which the Red detachment must appear.  From this vantage point in the forest one of the workmen came running in and cried out:\\n\\n\\\"Woe, woe to us!  The Reds have arrived.  A horseman is galloping fast through the forest road.  I called to him but he did not answer me.  It was dark but I knew the horse was a strange one.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do not babble so,\\\" said another of the workmen.  \\\"Some Mongol rode by and you jumped to the conclusion that he was a Red.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, it was not a Mongol,\\\" he replied.  \\\"The horse was shod.  I heard the sound of iron shoes on the road.  Woe to us!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said my friend, \\\"it seems that this is our finish.  It is a silly way for it all to end.\\\"\\n\\nHe was right.  Just then there was a knock at our door but it was that of the Mongol bringing us three horses for our escape. Immediately we saddled them, packed the third beast with our tent and food and rode off at once to take leave of Gay.\\n\\nIn his house we found the whole war council.  Two or three colonists and several Cossacks had galloped from the mountains and announced that the Red detachment was approaching Khathyl but would remain for the night in the forest, where they were building campfires.  In fact, through the house windows we could see the glare of the fires.  It seemed very strange that the enemy should await the morning there in the forest when they were right on the village they wished to capture.\\n\\nAn armed Cossack entered the room and announced that two armed men from the detachment were approaching.  All the men in the room pricked up their ears.  Outside were heard the horses' hoofs followed by men's voices and a knock at the door.\\n\\n\\\"Come in,\\\" said Gay.\\n\\nTwo young men entered, their moustaches and beards white and their cheeks blazing red from the cold.  They were dressed in the common Siberian overcoat with the big Astrakhan caps, but they had no weapons.  Questions began.  It developed that it was a detachment of White peasants from the Irkutsk and Yakutsk districts who had been fighting with the Bolsheviki.  They had been defeated somewhere in the vicinity of Irkutsk and were now trying to make a junction with Kazagrandi.  The leader of this band was a socialist, Captain Vassilieff, who had suffered much under the Czar because of his tenets.\\n\\nOur troubles had vanished but we decided to start immediately to Muren Kure, as we had gathered our information and were in a hurry to make our report.  We started.  On the road we overtook three Cossacks who were going out to bring back the colonists who were fleeing to the south.  We joined them and, dismounting, we all led our horses over the ice.  The Yaga was mad.  The subterranean forces produced underneath the ice great heaving waves which with a swirling roar threw up and tore loose great sections of ice, breaking them into small blocks and sucking them under the unbroken downstream field.  Cracks ran like snakes over the surface in different directions.  One of the Cossacks fell into one of these but we had just time to save him.  He was forced by his ducking in such extreme cold to turn back to Khathyl.  Our horses slipped about and fell several times.  Men and animals felt the presence of death which hovered over them and momentarily threatened them with destruction.  At last we made the farther bank and continued southward down the valley, glad to have left the geological and figurative volcanoes behind us.  Ten miles farther on we came up with the first party of refugees.  They had spread a big tent and made a fire inside, filling it with warmth and smoke.  Their camp was made beside the establishment of a large Chinese trading house, where the owners refused to let the colonists come into their amply spacious buildings, even though there were children, women and invalids among the refugees.  We spent but half an hour here.  The road as we continued was easy, save in places where the snow lay deep.  We crossed the fairly high divide between the Egingol and Muren.  Near the pass one very unexpected event occurred to us.  We crossed the mouth of a fairly wide valley whose upper end was covered with a dense wood.  Near this wood we noticed two horsemen, evidently watching us.  Their manner of sitting in their saddles and the character of their horses told us that they were not Mongols.  We began shouting and waving to them; but they did not answer.  Out of the wood emerged a third and stopped to look at us. We decided to interview them and, whipping up our horses, galloped toward them.  When we were about one thousand yards from them, they slipped from their saddles and opened on us with a running fire. Fortunately we rode a little apart and thus made a poor target for them.  We jumped off our horses, dropped prone on the ground and prepared to fight.  However, we did not fire because we thought it might be a mistake on their part, thinking that we were Reds.  They shortly made off.  Their shots from the European rifles had given us further proof that they were not Mongols.  We waited until they had disappeared into the woods and then went forward to investigate their tracks, which we found were those of shod horses, clearly corroborating the earlier evidence that they were not Mongols.  Who could they have been?  We never found out; yet what a different relationship they might have borne to our lives, had their shots been true!\\n\\nAfter we had passed over the divide, we met the Russian colonist D. A. Teternikoff from Muren Kure, who invited us to stay in his house and promised to secure camels for us from the Lamas.  The cold was intense and heightened by a piercing wind.  During the day we froze to the bone but at night thawed and warmed up nicely by our tent stove.  After two days we entered the valley of Muren and from afar made out the square of the Kure with its Chinese roofs and large red temples.  Nearby was a second square, the Chinese and Russian settlement.  Two hours more brought us to the house of our hospitable companion and his attractive young wife who feasted us with a wonderful luncheon of tasty dishes.  We spent five days at Muren waiting for the camels to be engaged.  During this time many refugees arrived from Khathyl because Colonel Kazagrandi was gradually falling back upon the town.  Among others there were two Colonels, Plavako and Maklakoff, who had caused the disruption of the Kazagrandi force.  No sooner had the refugees appeared in Muren Kure than the Mongolian officials announced that the Chinese authorities had ordered them to drive out all Russian refugees.\\n\\n\\\"Where can we go now in winter with women and children and no homes of our own?\\\" asked the distraught refugees.\\n\\n\\\"That is of no moment to us,\\\" answered the Mongolian officials. \\\"The Chinese authorities are angry and have ordered us to drive you away.  We cannot help you at all.\\\"\\n\\nThe refugees had to leave Muren Kure and so erected their tents in the open not far away.  Plavako and Maklakoff bought horses and started out for Van Kure.  Long afterwards I learned that both had been killed by the Chinese along the road.\\n\\nWe secured three camels and started out with a large group of Chinese merchants and Russian refugees to make Uliassutai, preserving the warmest recollections of our courteous hosts, T. V. and D. A. Teternikoff.  For the trip we had to pay for our camels the very high price of 33 lan of the silver bullion which had been supplied us by an American firm in Uliassutai, the equivalent roughly of 2.7 pounds of the white metal.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV\\n\\nA BLOODY CHASTISEMENT\\n\\nBefore long we struck the road which we had travelled coming north and saw again the kindly rows of chopped down telegraph poles which had once so warmly protected us.  Over the timbered hillocks north of the valley of Tisingol we wended just as it was growing dark. We decided to stay in Bobroff's house and our companions thought to seek the hospitality of Kanine in the telegraph station.  At the station gate we found a soldier with a rifle, who questioned us as to who we were and whence we had come and, being apparently satisfied, whistled out a young officer from the house.\\n\\n\\\"Lieutenant Ivanoff,\\\" he introduced himself.  \\\"I am staying here with my detachment of White Partisans.\\\"\\n\\nHe had come from near Irkutsk with his following of ten men and had formed a connection with Lieutenant-Colonel Michailoff at Uliassutai, who commanded him to take possession of this blockhouse.\\n\\n\\\"Enter, please,\\\" he said hospitably.\\n\\nI explained to him that I wanted to stay with Bobroff, whereat he made a despairing gesture with his hand and said:\\n\\n\\\"Don't trouble yourself.  The Bobroffs are killed and their house burned.\\\"\\n\\nI could not keep back a cry of horror.\\n\\nThe Lieutenant continued:  \\\"Kanine and the Pouzikoffs killed them, pillaged the place and afterwards burned the house with their dead bodies in it.  Do you want to see it?\\\"\\n\\nMy friend and I went with the Lieutenant and looked over the ominous site.  Blackened uprights stood among charred beams and planks while crockery and iron pots and pans were scattered all around.  A little to one side under some felt lay the remains of the four unfortunate individuals.  The Lieutenant first spoke:\\n\\n\\\"I reported the case to Uliassutai and received word back that the relatives of the deceased would come with two officers, who would investigate the affair.  That is why I cannot bury the bodies.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How did it happen?\\\" we asked, oppressed by the sad picture.\\n\\n\\\"It was like this,\\\" he began.  \\\"I was approaching Tisingol at night with my ten soldiers.  Fearing that there might be Reds here, we sneaked up to the station and looked into the windows.  We saw Pouzikoff, Kanine and the short-haired girl, looking over and dividing clothes and other things and weighing lumps of silver.  I did not at once grasp the significance of all this; but, feeling the need for continued caution, ordered one of my soldiers to climb the fence and open the gate.  We rushed into the court.  The first to run from the house was Kanine's wife, who threw up her hands and shrieked in fear:  \\\"I knew that misfortune would come of all this!\\\" and then fainted.  One of the men ran out of a side door to a shed in the yard and there tried to get over the fence.  I had not noticed him but one of my soldiers caught him.  We were met at the door by Kanine, who was white and trembling.  I realized that something important had taken place, placed them all under arrest, ordered the men tied and placed a close guard.  All my questions were met with silence save by Madame Kanine who cried:  'Pity, pity for the children!  They are innocent!' as she dropped on her knees and stretched out her hands in supplication to us.  The short- haired girl laughed out of impudent eyes and blew a puff of smoke into my face.  I was forced to threaten them and said:\\n\\n\\\"'I know that you have committed some crime, but you do not want to confess.  If you do not, I shall shoot the men and take the women to Uliassutai to try them there.'\\n\\n\\\"I spoke with definiteness of voice and intention, for they roused my deepest anger.  Quite to my surprise the short-haired girl first began to speak.\\n\\n\\\"'I want to tell you about everything,' she said.\\n\\n\\\"I ordered ink, paper and pen brought me.  My soldiers were the witnesses.  Then I prepared the protocol of the confession of Pouzikoff's wife.  This was her dark and bloody tale.\\n\\n\\\"'My husband and I are Bolshevik commissars and we have been sent to find out how many White officers are hidden in Mongolia.  But the old fellow Bobroff knew us.  We wanted to go away but Kanine kept us, telling us that Bobroff was rich and that he had for a long time wanted to kill him and pillage his place.  We agreed to join him.  We decoyed the young Bobroff to come and play cards with us.  When he was going home my husband stole along behind and shot him.  Afterwards we all went to Bobroff's place.  I climbed upon the fence and threw some poisoned meat to the dogs, who were dead in a few minutes.  Then we all climbed over.  The first person to emerge from the house was Bobroff's wife.  Pouzikoff, who was hidden behind the door, killed her with his ax.  The old fellow we killed with a blow of the ax as he slept.  The little girl ran out into the room as she heard the noise and Kanine shot her in the head with buckshot.  Afterwards we looted the house and burned it, even destroying the horses and cattle.  Later all would have been completely burned, so that no traces remained, but you suddenly arrived and these stupid fellows at once betrayed us.'\\n\\n\\\"It was a dastardly affair,\\\" continued the Lieutenant, as we returned to the station.  \\\"The hair raised on my head as I listened to the calm description of this young woman, hardly more than a girl.  Only then did I fully realize what depravity Bolshevism had brought into the world, crushing out faith, fear of God and conscience.  Only then did I understand that all honest people must fight without compromise against this most dangerous enemy of mankind, so long as life and strength endure.\\\"\\n\\nAs we walked I noticed at the side of the road a black spot.  It attracted and fixed my attention.\\n\\n\\\"What is that?\\\" I asked, pointing to the spot.\\n\\n\\\"It is the murderer Pouzikoff whom I shot,\\\" answered the Lieutenant.  \\\"I would have shot both Kanine and the wife of Pouzikoff but I was sorry for Kanine's wife and children and I haven't learned the lesson of shooting women.  Now I shall send them along with you under the surveillance of my soldiers to Uliassutai.  The same result will come, for the Mongols who try them for the murder will surely kill them.\\\"\\n\\nThis is what happened at Tisingol, on whose shores the will-o'-the- wisp flits over the marshy pools and near which runs the cleavage of over two hundred miles that the last earthquake left in the surface of the land.  Maybe it was out of this cleavage that Pouzikoff, Kanine and the others who have sought to infect the whole world with horror and crime made their appearance from the land of the inferno.  One of Lieutenant Ivanoff's soldiers, who was always praying and pale, called them all \\\"the servants of Satan.\\\"\\n\\nOur trip from Tisingol to Uliassutai in the company of these criminals was very unpleasant.  My friend and I entirely lost our usual strength of spirit and healthy frame of mind.  Kanine persistently brooded and thought while the impudent woman laughed, smoked and joked with the soldiers and several of our companions. At last we crossed the Jagisstai and in a few hours descried at first the fortress and then the low adobe houses huddled on the plain, which we knew to be Uliassutai.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV\\n\\nHARASSING DAYS\\n\\nOnce more we found ourselves in the whirl of events.  During our fortnight away a great deal had happened here.  The Chinese Commissioner Wang Tsao-tsun had sent eleven envoys to Urga but none had returned.  The situation in Mongolia remained far from clear. The Russian detachment had been increased by the arrival of new colonists and secretly continued its illegal existence, although the Chinese knew about it through their omnipresent system of spies.  In the town no Russian or foreign citizens left their houses and all remained armed and ready to act.  At night armed sentinels stood guard in all their court-yards.  It was the Chinese who induced such precautions.  By order of their Commissioner all the Chinese merchants with stocks of rifles armed their staffs and handed over any surplus guns to the officials, who with these formed and equipped a force of two hundred coolies into a special garrison of gamins.  Then they took possession of the Mongolian arsenal and distributed these additional guns among the Chinese vegetable farmers in the nagan hushun, where there was always a floating population of the lowest grade of transient Chinese laborers.  This trash of China now felt themselves strong, gathered together in excited discussions and evidently were preparing for some outburst of aggression.  At night the coolies transported many boxes of cartridges from the Chinese shops to the nagan hushun and the behaviour of the Chinese mob became unbearably audacious. These coolies and gamins impertinently stopped and searched people right on the streets and sought to provoke fights that would allow them to take anything they wanted.  Through secret news we received from certain Chinese quarters we learned that the Chinese were preparing a pogrom for all the Russians and Mongols in Uliassutai. We fully realized that it was only necessary to fire one single house at the right part of the town and the entire settlement of wooden buildings would go up in flames.  The whole population prepared to defend themselves, increased the sentinels in the compounds, appointed leaders for certain sections of the town, organized a special fire brigade and prepared horses, carts and food for a hasty flight.  The situation became worse when news arrived from Kobdo that the Chinese there had made a pogrom, killing some of the inhabitants and burning the whole town after a wild looting orgy.  Most of the people got away to the forests on the mountains but it was at night and consequently without warm clothes and without food.  During the following days these mountains around Kobdo heard many cries of misfortune, woe and death.  The severe cold and hunger killed off the women and children out under the open sky of the Mongolian winter.  This news was soon known to the Chinese.  They laughed in mockery and soon organized a big meeting at the nagan hushun to discuss letting the mob and gamins loose on the town.\\n\\nA young Chinese, the son of a cook of one of the colonists, revealed this news.  We immediately decided to make an investigation.  A Russian officer and my friend joined me with this young Chinese as a guide for a trip to the outskirts of the town. We feigned simply a stroll but were stopped by the Chinese sentinel on the side of the city toward the nagan hushun with an impertinent command that no one was allowed to leave the town.  As we spoke with him, I noticed that between the town and the nagan hushun Chinese guards were stationed all along the way and that streams of Chinese were moving in that direction.  We saw at once it was impossible to reach the meeting from this approach, so we chose another route.  We left the city from the eastern side and passed along by the camp of the Mongolians who had been reduced to beggary by the Chinese impositions.  There also they were evidently anxiously awaiting the turn of events, for, in spite of the lateness of the hour, none had gone to sleep.  We slipped out on the ice and worked around by the river to the nagan hushun.  As we passed free of the city we began to sneak cautiously along, taking advantage of every bit of cover.  We were armed with revolvers and hand grenades and knew that a small detachment had been prepared in the town to come to our aid, if we should be in danger.  First the young Chinese stole forward with my friend following him like a shadow, constantly reminding him that he would strangle him like a mouse if he made one move to betray us.  I fear the young guide did not greatly enjoy the trip with my gigantic friend puffing all too loudly with the unusual exertions.  At last the fences of nagan hushun were in sight and nothing between us and them save the open plain, where our group would have been easily spotted; so that we decided to crawl up one by one, save that the Chinese was retained in the society of my trusted friend.  Fortunately there were many heaps of frozen manure on the plain, which we made use of as cover to lead us right up to our objective point, the fence of the enclosures.  In the shadow of this we slunk along to the courtyard where the voices of the excited crowd beckoned us.  As we took good vantage points in the darkness for listening and making observations, we remarked two extraordinary things in our immediate neighborhood.\\n\\nAnother invisible guest was present with us at the Chinese gathering.  He lay on the ground with his head in a hole dug by the dogs under the fence.  He was perfectly still and evidently had not heard our advance.  Nearby in a ditch lay a white horse with his nose muzzled and a little further away stood another saddled horse tied to a fence.\\n\\nIn the courtyard there was a great hubbub.  About two thousand men were shouting, arguing and flourishing their arms about in wild gesticulations.  Nearly all were armed with rifles, revolvers, swords and axes.  In among the crowd circulated the gamins, constantly talking, handing out papers, explaining and assuring. Finally a big, broad-shouldered Chinese mounted the well combing, waved his rifle about over his head and opened a tirade in strong, sharp tones.\\n\\n\\\"He is assuring the people,\\\" said our interpreter, \\\"that they must do here what the Chinese have done in Kobdo and must secure from the Commissioner the assurance of an order to his guard not to prevent the carrying out of their plans.  Also that the Chinese Commissioner must demand from the Russians all their weapons. 'Then we shall take vengeance on the Russians for their Blagoveschensk crime when they drowned three thousand Chinese in 1900.  You remain here while I go to the Commissioner and talk with him.'\\\"\\n\\nHe jumped down from the well and quickly made his way to the gate toward the town.  At once I saw the man who was lying with his head under the fence draw back out of his hole, take his white horse from the ditch and then run over to untie the other horse and lead them both back to our side, which was away from the city.  He left the second horse there and hid himself around the corner of the hushun.  The spokesman went out of the gate and, seeing his horse over on the other side of the enclosure, slung his rifle across his back and started for his mount.  He had gone about half way when the stranger behind the corner of the fence suddenly galloped out and in a flash literally swung the man clear from the ground up across the pommel of his saddle, where we saw him tie the mouth of the semi-strangled Chinese with a cloth and dash off with him toward the west away from the town.\\n\\n\\\"Who do you suppose he is?\\\" I asked of my friend, who answered up at once:  \\\"It must be Tushegoun Lama. . . .\\\"\\n\\nHis whole appearance did strongly remind me of this mysterious Lama avenger and his manner of addressing himself to his enemy was a strict replica of that of Tushegoun.  Late in the night we learned that some time after their orator had gone to seek the Commissioner's cooperation in their venture, his head had been flung over the fence into the midst of the waiting audience and that eight gamins had disappeared on their way from the hushun to the town without leaving trace or trail.  This event terrorized the Chinese mob and calmed their heated spirits.\\n\\nThe next day we received very unexpected aid.  A young Mongol galloped in from Urga, his overcoat torn, his hair all dishevelled and fallen to his shoulders and a revolver prominent beneath his girdle.  Proceeding directly to the market where the Mongols are always gathered, without leaving his saddle he cried out:\\n\\n\\\"Urga is captured by our Mongols and Chiang Chun Baron Ungern! Bogdo Hutuktu is once more our Khan!  Mongols, kill the Chinese and pillage their shops!  Our patience is exhausted!\\\"\\n\\nThrough the crowd rose the roar of excitement.  The rider was surrounded with a mob of insistent questioners.  The old Mongol Sait, Chultun Beyli, who had been dismissed by the Chinese, was at once informed of this news and asked to have the messenger brought to him.  After questioning the man he arrested him for inciting the people to riot, but he refused to turn him over to the Chinese authorities.  I was personally with the Sait at the time and heard his decision in the matter.  When the Chinese Commissioner, Wang Tsao-tsun, threatened the Sait for disobedience to his authority, the old man simply fingered his rosary and said:\\n\\n\\\"I believe the story of this Mongol in its every word and I apprehend that you and I shall soon have to reverse our relationship.\\\"\\n\\nI felt that Wang Tsao-tsun also accepted the correctness of the Mongol's story, because he did not insist further.  From this moment the Chinese disappeared from the streets of Uliassutai as though they never had been, and synchronously the patrols of the Russian officers and of our foreign colony took their places.  The panic among the Chinese was heightened by the receipt of a letter containing the news that the Mongols and Altai Tartars under the leadership of the Tartar officer Kaigorodoff pursued the Chinese who were making off with their booty from the sack of Kobdo and overtook and annihilated them on the borders of Sinkiang.  Another part of the letter told how General Bakitch and the six thousand men who had been interned with him by the Chinese authorities on the River Amyl had received arms and started to join with Ataman Annenkoff, who had been interned in Kuldja, with the ultimate intention of linking up with Baron Ungern.  This rumour proved to be wrong because neither Bakitch nor Annenkoff entertained this intention, because Annenkoff had been transported by the Chinese into the Depths of Turkestan.  However, the news produced veritable stupefaction among the Chinese.\\n\\nJust at this time there arrived at the house of the Bolshevist Russian colonist Bourdukoff three Bolshevik agents from Irkutsk named Saltikoff, Freimann and Novak, who started an agitation among the Chinese authorities to get them to disarm the Russian officers and hand them over to the Reds.  They persuaded the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to petition the Irkutsk Soviet to send a detachment of Reds to Uliassutai for the protection of the Chinese against the White detachments.  Freimann brought with him communistic pamphlets in Mongolian and instructions to begin the reconstruction of the telegraph line to Irkutsk.  Bourdukoff also received some messages from the Bolsheviki.  This quartette developed their policy very successfully and soon saw Wang Tsao-tsun fall in with their schemes.  Once more the days of expecting a pogrom in Uliassutai returned to us.  The Russian officers anticipated attempts to arrest them.  The representative of one of the American firms went with me to the Commissioner for a parley.  We pointed out to him the illegality of his acts, inasmuch as he was not authorized by his Government to treat with the Bolsheviki when the Soviet Government had not been recognized by Peking.  Wang Tsao-tsun and his advisor Fu Hsiang were palpably confused at finding we knew of his secret meetings with the Bolshevik agents.  He assured us that his guard was sufficient to prevent any such pogrom.  It was quite true that his guard was very capable, as it consisted of well trained and disciplined soldiers under the command of a serious- minded and well educated officer; but, what could eighty soldiers do against a mob of three thousand coolies, one thousand armed merchants and two hundred gamins?  We strongly registered our apprehensions and urged him to avoid any bloodshed, pointing out that the foreign and Russian population were determined to defend themselves to the last moment.  Wang at once ordered the establishment of strong guards on the streets and thus made a very interesting picture with all the Russian, foreign and Chinese patrols moving up and down throughout the whole town.  Then we did not know there were three hundred more sentinels on duty, the men of Tushegoun Lama hidden nearby in the mountains.\\n\\nOnce more the picture changed very sharply and suddenly.  The Mongolian Sait received news through the Lamas of the nearest monastery that Colonel Kazagrandi, after fighting with the Chinese irregulars, had captured Van Kure and had formed there Russian- Mongolian brigades of cavalry, mobilizing the Mongols by the order of the Living Buddha and the Russians by order of Baron Ungern.  A few hours later it became known that in the large monastery of Dzain the Chinese soldiers had killed the Russian Captain Barsky and as a result some of the troops of Kazagrandi attacked and swept the Chinese out of the place.  At the taking of Van Kure the Russians arrested a Korean Communist who was on his way from Moscow with gold and propaganda to work in Korea and America.  Colonel Kazagrandi sent this Korean with his freight of gold to Baron Ungern.  After receiving this news the chief of the Russian detachment in Uliassutai arrested all the Bolsheviki agents and passed judgment upon them and upon the murderers of the Bobroffs. Kanine, Madame Pouzikoff and Freimann were shot.  Regarding Saltikoff and Novak some doubt sprang up and, moreover, Saltikoff escaped and hid, while Novak, under advice from Lieutenant Colonel Michailoff, left for the west.  The chief of the Russian detachment gave out orders for the mobilization of the Russian colonists and openly took Uliassutai under his protection with the tacit agreement of the Mongolian authorities.  The Mongol Sait, Chultun Beyli, convened a council of the neighboring Mongolian Princes, the soul of which was the noted Mongolian patriot, Hun Jap Lama.  The Princes quickly formulated their demands upon the Chinese for the complete evacuation of the territory subject to the Sait Chultun Beyli.  Out of it grew parleys, threats and friction between the various Chinese and Mongolian elements.  Wang Tsao-tsun proposed his scheme of settlement, which some of the Mongolian Princes accepted; but Jap Lama at the decisive moment threw the Chinese document to the ground, drew his knife and swore that he would die by his own hand rather than set it as a seal upon this treacherous agreement.  As a result the Chinese proposals were rejected and the antagonists began to prepare themselves for the struggle.  All the armed Mongols were summoned from Jassaktu Khan, Sain-Noion Khan and the dominion of Jahantsi Lama.  The Chinese authorities placed their four machine guns and prepared to defend the fortress. Continuous deliberations were held by both the Chinese and Mongols. Finally, our old acquaintance Tzeren came to me as one of the unconcerned foreigners and handed to me the joint requests of Wang Tsao-tsun and Chultun Beyli to try to pacify the two elements and to work out a fair agreement between them.  Similar requests were handed to the representative of an American firm.  The following evening we held the first meeting of the arbitrators and the Chinese and Mongolian representatives.  It was passionate and stormy, so that we foreigners lost all hope of the success of our mission.  However, at midnight when the speakers were tired, we secured agreement on two points: the Mongols announced that they did not want to make war and that they desired to settle this matter in such a way as to retain the friendship of the great Chinese people; while the Chinese Commissioner acknowledged that China had violated the treaties by which full independence had been legally granted to Mongolia.\\n\\nThese two points formed for us the groundwork of the next meeting and gave us the starting points for urging reconciliation.  The deliberations continued for three days and finally turned so that we foreigners could propose our suggestions for an agreement.  Its chief provisions were that the Chinese authorities should surrender administrative powers, return the arms to the Mongolians, disarm the two hundred gamins and leave the country; and that the Mongols on their side should give free and honorable passage of their country to the Commissioner with his armed guard of eighty men. This Chinese-Mongolian Treaty of Uliassutai was signed and sealed by the Chinese Commissioners, Wang Tsao-tsun and Fu Hsiang, by both Mongolian Saits, by Hun Jap Lama and other Princes, as well as by the Russian and Chinese Presidents of the Chambers of Commerce and by us foreign arbitrators.  The Chinese officials and convoy began at once to pack up their belongings and prepare for departure.  The Chinese merchants remained in Uliassutai because Sait Chultun Beyli, now having full authority and power, guaranteed their safety.  The day of departure for the expedition of Wang Tsao-tsun arrived.  The camels with their packs already filled the yamen court-yard and the men only awaited the arrival of their horses from the plains.  Suddenly the news spread everywhere that the herd of horses had been stolen during the night and run off toward the south.  Of two soldiers that had been sent out to follow the tracks of the herd only one came back with the news that the other had been killed.  Astonishment spread over the whole town while among the Chinese it turned to open panic.  It perceptibly increased when some Mongols from a distant ourton to the east came in and announced that in various places along the post road to Urga they had discovered the bodies of sixteen of the soldiers whom Wang Tsao-tsun had sent out with letters for Urga.  The mystery of these events will soon be explained.\\n\\nThe chief of the Russian detachment received a letter from a Cossack Colonel, V. N. Domojiroff, containing the order to disarm immediately the Chinese garrison, to arrest all Chinese officials for transport to Baron Ungern at Urga, to take control of Uliassutai, by force if necessary, and to join forces with his detachment.  At the very same time a messenger from the Narabanchi Hutuktu galloped in with a letter to the effect that a Russian detachment under the leadership of Hun Boldon and Colonel Domojiroff from Urga had pillaged some Chinese firms and killed the merchants, had come to the Monastery and demanded horses, food and shelter.  The Hutuktu asked for help because the ferocious conqueror of Kobdo, Hun Boldon, could very easily pillage the unprotected isolated monastery.  We strongly urged Colonel Michailoff not to violate the sealed treaty and discountenance all the foreigners and Russians who had taken part in making it, for this would but be to imitate the Bolshevik principle of making deceit the leading rule in all acts of state.  This touched Michailoff and he answered Domojiroff that Uliassutai was already in his hands without a fight; that over the building of the former Russian Consulate the tri-color flag of Russia was flying; the gamins had been disarmed but that the other orders could not be carried out, because their execution would violate the Chinese- Mongolian treaty just signed in Uliassutai.\\n\\nDaily several envoys traveled from Narabanchi Hutuktu to Uliassutai.  The news became more and more disquieting.  The Hutuktu reported that Hun Boldon was mobilizing the Mongolian beggars and horse stealers, arming and training them; that the soldiers were taking the sheep of the monastery; that the \\\"Noyon\\\" Domojiroff was always drunk; and that the protests of the Hutuktu were answered with jeers and scolding.  The messengers gave very indefinite information regarding the strength of the detachment, some placing it at about thirty while others stated that Domojiroff said he had eight hundred in all.  We could not understand it at all and soon the messengers ceased coming.  All the letters of the Sait remained unanswered and the envoys did not return.  There seemed to be no doubt that the men had been killed or captured.\\n\\nPrince Chultun Beyli determined to go himself.  He took with him the Russian and Chinese Presidents of the Chambers of Commerce and two Mongolian officers.  Three days elapsed without receiving any news from him whatever.  The Mongols began to get worried.  Then the Chinese Commissioner and Hun Jap Lama addressed a request to the foreigner group to send some one to Narabanchi, in order to try to resolve the controversy there and to persuade Domojiroff to recognize the treaty and not permit the \\\"great insult of violation\\\" of a covenant between the two great peoples.  Our group asked me once more to accomplish this mission pro bono publico.  I had assigned me as interpreter a fine young Russian colonist, the nephew of the murdered Bobroff, a splendid rider as well as a cool, brave man.  Lt.-Colonel Michailoff gave me one of his officers to accompany me.  Supplied with an express tzara for the post horses and guides, we traveled rapidly over the way which was now familiar to me to find my old friend, Jelib Djamsrap Huktuktu of Narabanchi. Although there was deep snow in some places, we made from one hundred to one hundred and fifteen miles per day.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI\\n\\nTHE BAND OF WHITE HUNGHUTZES\\n\\nWe arrived at Narabanchi late at night on the third day out.  As we were approaching, we noticed several riders who, as soon as they had seen us, galloped quickly back to the monastery.  For some time we looked for the camp of the Russian detachment without finding it.  The Mongols led us into the monastery, where the Hutuktu immediately received me.  In his yurta sat Chultun Beyli.  There he presented me with hatyks and said to me:  \\\"The very God has sent you here to us in this difficult moment.\\\"\\n\\nIt seems Domojiroff had arrested both the Presidents of the Chambers of Commerce and had threatened to shoot Prince Chultun. Both Domojiroff and Hun Boldon had no documents legalizing their activities.  Chultun Beyli was preparing to fight with them.\\n\\nI asked them to take me to Domojiroff.  Through the dark I saw four big yurtas and two Mongol sentinels with Russian rifles.  We entered the Russian \\\"Noyon's\\\" tent.  A very strange picture was presented to our eyes.  In the middle of the yurta the brazier was burning.  In the usual place for the altar stood a throne, on which the tall, thin, grey-haired Colonel Domojiroff was seated.  He was only in his undergarments and stockings, was evidently a little drunk and was telling stories.  Around the brazier lay twelve young men in various picturesque poses.  My officer companion reported to Domojiroff about the events in Uliassutai and during the conversation I asked Domojiroff where his detachment was encamped. He laughed and answered, with a sweep of his hand:  \\\"This is my detachment.\\\"  I pointed out to him that the form of his orders to us in Uliassutai had led us to believe that he must have a large company with him.  Then I informed him that Lt.-Colonel Michailoff was preparing to cross swords with the Bolshevik force approaching Uliassutai.\\n\\n\\\"What?\\\" he exclaimed with fear and confusion, \\\"the Reds?\\\"\\n\\nWe spent the night in his yurta and, when I was ready to lie down, my officer whispered to me:\\n\\n\\\"Be sure to keep your revolver handy,\\\" to which I laughed and said:\\n\\n\\\"But we are in the center of a White detachment and therefore in perfect safety!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Uh-huh!\\\" answered my officer and finished the response with one eye closed.\\n\\nThe next day I invited Domojiroff to walk with me over the plain, when I talked very frankly with him about what had been happening. He and Hun Boldon had received orders from Baron Ungern simply to get into touch with General Bakitch, but instead they began pillaging Chinese firms along the route and he had made up his mind to become a great conqueror.  On the way he had run across some of the officers who deserted Colonel Kazagrandi and formed his present band.  I succeeded in persuading Domojiroff to arrange matters peacefully with Chultun Beyli and not to violate the treaty.  He immediately went ahead to the monastery.  As I returned, I met a tall Mongol with a ferocious face, dressed in a blue silk outercoat--it was Hun Boldon.  He introduced himself and spoke with me in Russian.  I had only time to take off my coat in the tent of Domojiroff when a Mongol came running to invite me to the yurta of Hun Boldon.  The Prince lived just beside me in a splendid blue yurta.  Knowing the Mongolian custom, I jumped into the saddle and rode the ten paces to his door.  Hun Boldon received me with coldness and pride.\\n\\n\\\"Who is he?\\\" he inquired of the interpreter, pointing to me with his finger.\\n\\nI understood his desire to offend me and I answered in the same manner, thrusting out my finger toward him and turning to the interpreter with the same question in a slightly more unpleasant tone:\\n\\n\\\"Who is he?  High Prince and warrior or shepherd and brute?\\\"\\n\\nBoldon at once became confused and, with trembling voice and agitation in his whole manner, blurted out to me that he would not allow me to interfere in his affairs and would shoot every man who dared to run counter to his orders.  He pounded on the low table with his fist and then rose up and drew his revolver.  But I was much traveled among the nomads and had studied them thoroughly-- Princes, Lamas, shepherds and brigands.  I grasped my whip and, striking it on the table with all my strength, I said to the interpreter:\\n\\n\\\"Tell him that he has the honor to speak with neither Mongol nor Russian but with a foreigner, a citizen of a great and free state. Tell him he must first learn to be a man and then he can visit me and we can talk together.\\\"\\n\\nI turned and went out.  Ten minutes later Hun Boldon entered my yurta and offered his apologies.  I persuaded him to parley with Chultun Beyli and not to offend the free Mongol people with his activities.  That very night all was arranged.  Hun Boldon dismissed his Mongols and left for Kobdo, while Domojiroff with his band started for Jassaktu Khan to arrange for the mobilization of the Mongols there.  With the consent of Chultun Beyli he wrote to Wang Tsao-tsun a demand to disarm his guard, as all of the Chinese troops in Urga had been so treated; but this letter arrived after Wang had bought camels to replace the stolen horses and was on his way to the border.  Later Lt.-Colonel Michailoff sent a detachment of fifty men under the command of Lieutenant Strigine to overhaul Wang and receive their arms.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVII\\n\\nMYSTERY IN A SMALL TEMPLE\\n\\nPrince Chultun Beyli and I were ready to leave the Narabanchi Kure. While the Hutuktu was holding service for the Sait in the Temple of Blessing, I wandered around through the narrow alleyways between the walls of the houses of the various grades of Lama Gelongs, Getuls, Chaidje and Rabdjampa; of schools where the learned doctors of theology or Maramba taught together with the doctors of medicine or Ta Lama; of the residences for students called Bandi; of stores, archives and libraries.  When I returned to the yurta of the Hutuktu, he was inside.  He presented me with a large hatyk and proposed a walk around the monastery.  His face wore a preoccupied expression from which I gathered that he had something he wished to discuss with me.  As we went out of the yurta, the liberated President of the Russian Chamber of Commerce and a Russian officer joined us.  The Hutuktu led us to a small building just back of a bright yellow stone wall.\\n\\n\\\"In that building once stopped the Dalai Lama and Bogdo Khan and we always paint the buildings yellow where these holy persons have lived.  Enter!\\\"\\n\\nThe interior of the building was arranged with splendor.  On the ground floor was the dining-room, furnished with richly carved, heavy blackwood Chinese tables and cabinets filled with porcelains and bronze.  Above were two rooms, the first a bed-room hung with heavy yellow silk curtains; a large Chinese lantern richly set with colored stones hung by a thin bronze chain from the carved wooden ceiling beam.  Here stood a large square bed covered with silken pillows, mattresses and blankets.  The frame work of the bed was also of the Chinese blackwood and carried, especially on the posts that held the roof-like canopy, finely executed carvings with the chief motive the conventional dragon devouring the sun.  By the side stood a chest of drawers completely covered with carvings setting forth religious pictures.  Four comfortable easy chairs completed the furniture, save for the low oriental throne which stood on a dais at the end of the room.\",\"timestamp\":1640140203,\"title\":\"\\nIn Khathyl we found a panic.
