"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"A summary of where Impermanent Digital has been and where it is going\\n\\n![Sour Afterlife / Layers of Fire Evolution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SiuFZFOm8pyHCIzeUHyMU.jpg?height=1543&width=3086)\\n\\n## An Impermanent Overview\\n\\nHeaded by Glassface, Impermanet Digital is a decision based art-first AI-assisted NFT Collection. Glassface utilizes the AI suite created by WolfBear studio in order to craft environments that reflect culture and the world we live in.\\n\\nLife has an end. We are not permanent. Until now, this has been false in NFTs. Impermanent Digital is a four series project exploring growth, impermanence, and the stories we tell ourselves to become ever closer to meaning. Our tools are transformation through time, creative collaboration, and exploration of story mediums of yesteryear.\\n\\n## Stage One Success\\n\\nUpon creating the deflationary model for Impermanent Digital we knew to expect the unexpected. To anticipate everything and nothing. Where we are today, we never could have predicted in September when ID began. So, where are we?\\n\\n### IDs Burned into the Afterlife: 45\\n\\n### IDs Evolved: 1200+\\n\\nWhile the art tells a transformative story and serves as a reminder that there is an end, the numbers also have a story to tell. A story of decisions. A story littered with questions. Do I love the art as it is? If I cross over, will I miss my original ID? What is next? Ultimately, only you can answer these questions, only you can stomach possible regrets and when you do, our artistic journey rolls on. Such is life.\\n\\n## Stage Two Decisions\\n\\nWhile there were over 2,000 hard decisions already made, we roll on. The second decision stage is starting on ***December 10th, 2021.*** For everyone who made decisions during stage one, the process will be largely the same. Anyone new to decision making, who owns an ID that is eligible for burning or evolving, will just need to head to the [ID burn/evolve tool](https://mint.impermanent.digital/) on or after ***December 10th, 2021***  to participate.\\n\\n**Just as a refresher:** All Lifecycle 2 IDs that decide to burn into the Afterlife Collection will be whitelisted for Series 2 (3333) and Series 3 (2222). Keep in mind, Lifecycle 3 ID owners who would like to join the Afterlife Collection in Stage 3 must be sure to evolve during Stage 2, as well.\\n\\n## The New Year\\n\\nWhile we do have a decision timeline available to view on [our website](https://impermanent.digital/), it’s of course good to get things out in more than one place. Series 2 is coming sooner than many members probably think. And Series 2 likely isn’t even the next Impermanent series on the docket. We’ll work with the ID community to build the next stage of the Dream**.** Stay tuned.\\n\\n![dijiact x ID x Masamune Shirow](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/06Dw13Wpa5c0fy4PvHQYf.png?height=1568&width=1184)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638564447,\"title\":\"We Are Here: The Future\"},\"digest\":\"7mefzm9wr5nPZyhU9xMg7OL-pmgByTIpF6N0aN2me5I\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x93a0AA2CEd962A4BBBC8FA37b0b8d8885c595417\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"S9qCGZGY6qtwMrYINvagx7DXiBFzosiVeWKcTR2E1V8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QaFwd-VoDTZImFuh_sCM5dGDd-V1JFAMm0hYJfSGf38\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"0rx-eTgo1htaY1SqdgntT8t6kcXNv14N09IlfftYL9gIiGEe6sCSkDRVdaMim1NN3IXOSiVfVVyKWD_NjaHlbQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa7074775f113dc563dcf965dd6091f6a22fbcb5eca62020741c5315c35d205500bf4471b8220228482948fc17d80ea71a0a1f6f382d9e19d04e78cced0a0ba661c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"S9qCGZGY6qtwMrYINvagx7DXiBFzosiVeWKcTR2E1V8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QaFwd-VoDTZImFuh_sCM5dGDd-V1JFAMm0hYJfSGf38\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"GSDydhzS_yxpK3c2GRE8ckTjgx0MMkRujZFSpVXwRWk\"}"
