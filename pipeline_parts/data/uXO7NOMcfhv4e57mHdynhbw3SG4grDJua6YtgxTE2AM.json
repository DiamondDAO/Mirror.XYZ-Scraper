"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"ESSER HIPPIAS\\n\\nby\\n\\nPlato (see Appendix I above)\\n\\nTranslated by Benjamin Jowett.\\n\\nPERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:  Eudicus, Socrates, Hippias.\\n\\nEUDICUS:  Why are you silent, Socrates, after the magnificent display which Hippias has been making?  Why do you not either refute his words, if he seems to you to have been wrong in any point, or join with us in commending him?  There is the more reason why you should speak, because we are now alone, and the audience is confined to those who may fairly claim to take part in a philosophical discussion.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  I should greatly like, Eudicus, to ask Hippias the meaning of what he was saying just now about Homer.  I have heard your father, Apemantus, declare that the Iliad of Homer is a finer poem than the Odyssey in the same degree that Achilles was a better man than Odysseus; Odysseus, he would say, is the central figure of the one poem and Achilles of the other.  Now, I should like to know, if Hippias has no objection to tell me, what he thinks about these two heroes, and which of them he maintains to be the better; he has already told us in the course of his exhibition many things of various kinds about Homer and divers other poets.\\n\\nEUDICUS:  I am sure that Hippias will be delighted to answer anything which you would like to ask; tell me, Hippias, if Socrates asks you a question, will you answer him?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Indeed, Eudicus, I should be strangely inconsistent if I refused to answer Socrates, when at each Olympic festival, as I went up from my house at Elis to the temple of Olympia, where all the Hellenes were assembled, I continually professed my willingness to perform any of the exhibitions which I had prepared, and to answer any questions which any one had to ask.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Truly, Hippias, you are to be congratulated, if at every Olympic festival you have such an encouraging opinion of your own wisdom when you go up to the temple.  I doubt whether any muscular hero would be so fearless and confident in offering his body to the combat at Olympia, as you are in offering your mind.\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  And with good reason, Socrates; for since the day when I first entered the lists at Olympia I have never found any man who was my superior in anything.  (Compare Gorgias.)\\n\\nSOCRATES:  What an ornament, Hippias, will the reputation of your wisdom be to the city of Elis and to your parents!  But to return:  what say you of Odysseus and Achilles?  Which is the better of the two? and in what particular does either surpass the other?  For when you were exhibiting and there was company in the room, though I could not follow you, I did not like to ask what you meant, because a crowd of people were present, and I was afraid that the question might interrupt your exhibition.  But now that there are not so many of us, and my friend Eudicus bids me ask, I wish you would tell me what you were saying about these two heroes, so that I may clearly understand; how did you distinguish them?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  I shall have much pleasure, Socrates, in explaining to you more clearly than I could in public my views about these and also about other heroes.  I say that Homer intended Achilles to be the bravest of the men who went to Troy, Nestor the wisest, and Odysseus the wiliest.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  O rare Hippias, will you be so good as not to laugh, if I find a difficulty in following you, and repeat my questions several times over?  Please to answer me kindly and gently.\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  I should be greatly ashamed of myself, Socrates, if I, who teach others and take money of them, could not, when I was asked by you, answer in a civil and agreeable manner.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Thank you:  the fact is, that I seemed to understand what you meant when you said that the poet intended Achilles to be the bravest of men, and also that he intended Nestor to be the wisest; but when you said that he meant Odysseus to be the wiliest, I must confess that I could not understand what you were saying.  Will you tell me, and then I shall perhaps understand you better; has not Homer made Achilles wily?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Certainly not, Socrates; he is the most straight-forward of mankind, and when Homer introduces them talking with one another in the passage called the Prayers, Achilles is supposed by the poet to say to Odysseus:--\\n\\n'Son of Laertes, sprung from heaven, crafty Odysseus, I will speak out plainly the word which I intend to carry out in act, and which will, I believe, be accomplished.  For I hate him like the gates of death who thinks one thing and says another.  But I will speak that which shall be accomplished.'\\n\\nNow, in these verses he clearly indicates the character of the two men; he shows Achilles to be true and simple, and Odysseus to be wily and false; for he supposes Achilles to be addressing Odysseus in these lines.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Now, Hippias, I think that I understand your meaning; when you say that Odysseus is wily, you clearly mean that he is false?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Exactly so, Socrates; it is the character of Odysseus, as he is represented by Homer in many passages both of the Iliad and Odyssey.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And Homer must be presumed to have meant that the true man is not the same as the false?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Of course, Socrates.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And is that your own opinion, Hippias?\\n\\nHIPPIAS:  Certainly; how can I have any other?\",\"timestamp\":1635906452,\"title\":\"The Lesser Hippias, though inferior to the other dialogues, may be reasonably believed to have been written by Plato,\"},\"digest\":\"OBIVnHHlx3FKx-Q-wWwd0gPpt2fiPrubiiKn-DjmG18\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x47CC9063B147f6D9fF7b366328DcF5A2D6F08265\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7t_CAHd9RLrUZLVy8ehLYNpwC6TEgOPYnd56ph9kn50\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_sXGTug9UPEoW1Q_5qNwBHKVs_ZEz0oi5W4t2cswJLw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"aTIhL-tHMsaqvus1y7FVIS1pgVlIOsR3wdwPa_cPGLIA2UxuY-kMdSw1XP6e_3nibY6gi81dRafWVTL_Nqojhg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x6a3779f98be504d2441d17c46a18a6bfc090026647705ae825a54a1014d34e9b5e232506192fbc1453ebc95fbcf11ec951eb713aac384dedcc6ed71723a75f891c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7t_CAHd9RLrUZLVy8ehLYNpwC6TEgOPYnd56ph9kn50\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_sXGTug9UPEoW1Q_5qNwBHKVs_ZEz0oi5W4t2cswJLw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"OBIVnHHlx3FKx-Q-wWwd0gPpt2fiPrubiiKn-DjmG18\"}"
