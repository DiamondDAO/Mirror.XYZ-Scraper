"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"was heard at the door.  \\\"Who's there?\\\"  asked Michael. A man outside replied, \\\"A benighted traveller overt aken by the storm\\\" He proceeded to implore help, and begged for God's sake that he might have shelter for the night.  Naesmyth, in the full belief that the traveller's tale was true, unbolted and unbarred the door, when in rushed Rob Roy and his desperate gang.  The men, with the dirks of the Macgregors at their throats, begged hard for their lives.  This was granted on condition that they should instantly depart, and take an oath that they should never venture within the Highland border again.\\n\\nMichael Naesmyth and his men had no alternative but to submit, and they at once left the bothy with such scanty clothing as the Macgregors would allow them to carry away.  They were marched under an armed escort through the snowstorm to the Highland border, and were there left with the murderous threat that, if they ever returned to the fort, they would meet with certain death.\\n\\nAnother attempt was made to build the fort at Inversnaid.  But Rob Roy again surprised the small party of soldiers who were in charge. They were disarmed and sent about their business.  Finally, the fort was rebuilt, and placed under the command of Captain (afterwards General) Wolfe.  When peace fell upon the Highlands and Rob Roy's country became the scene of picnics, the fort was abandoned and allowed to go to ruin.\\n\\nPoor Michael never recovered from the cold which he caught during his forced retreat from Inversnaid.  The effects of this, together with the loss and distress of mind which he experienced from the Government's refusal to pay for his work--notwithstanding their promise to protect him and his workmen from the Highland freebooters--so preyed upon his mind that he was never again able to devote himself to business. One evening, whilst sitting at his fireside with his grandchild on his knee, a death-like faintness came over him; he set the child down carefully by the side of his chair, and then fell forward dead on his hearthstone.\\n\\nThus ended the life of Michael Naesmyth in 1705, at the age of fifty-three.  He was buried by the side of his ancestors in the old family tomb in the Greyfriars Churchyard.\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\] The Naesmyth Tomb in Greyfriars Churchyard\\n\\nThis old tomb, dated 1614, though much defaced, is one of the most remarkable of the many which surround the walls of that ancient and memorable burying-place.\\n\\nGreyfriars Churchyard is one of the most interesting places in Edinburgh.  The National Covenant was signed there by the Protestant nobles and gentry of Scotland in 1638.  The prisoners taken at the battle of Bothwell Brig were shut up there in 1679, and, after enduring great privations, a portion of the survivors were sent off to Barbadoes.  When I first saw the tombstone, an ash tree was growing out of the top of the main body of it, though that has since been removed. In growing, the roots had pushed out the centre stone, which has not been replaced.  The tablet over it contains the arms of the family, the broken hammer-shafts, and the motto \\\"Non arte sed marte.\\\"  There are the remains of a very impressive figure, apparently rising from her cerements.  The body and extremities remain, but the head has been broken away.  There is also a remarkable motto on the tablet above the tombstone--\\\"Ars mihi vim contra Fortunce; which I take to be, \\\"Art is my strength in contending against Fortune,\\\"--a motto which is appropriate to my ancestors as well as to myself.\\n\\nThe business was afterwards carried on by Michael's son, my great-grandfather.  He was twenty-seven years old at the time of his father's death, and lived to the age of seventy-three.  He was a man of much ability and of large experience.\\n\\nOne of his great advantages in carrying on his business was the support of a staff of able and trustworthy foremen and workmen.  The times were very different then from what they are now.  Masters and men lived together in mutual harmony.  There was a kind of loyal family attachment among them, which extended through many generations. Workmen had neither the desire nor the means to shift about from place to place.  On the contrary, they settled down with their wives and families in houses of their own, close to the workshops of their employers.  Work was found for them in the dull seasons when trade was slack, and in summer they sometimes removed to jobs at a distance from headquarters.  Much of this feeling of attachment and loyalty between workmen and their employers has now expired.  Men rapidly remove from place to place.  Character is of little consequence.  The mutual feeling of goodwill and zealous attention to work seems to have passed away.\\n\\nMy grandfather, Michael Naesmyth, succeeded to the business in 1751. He more than maintained the reputation of his predecessors. The collection of first-class works on architecture which he possessed, such as the folio editions of Vitruvius and Palladio, which were at that time both rare and dear, showed the regard he had for impressing into his designs the best standards of taste.  The buildings he designed and erected for the Scotch nobility and gentry were well arranged, carefully executed, and thoroughly substantial.  He was also a large builder in Edinburgh.  Amongst the houses he erected in the Old Town were the principal number of those in George Square.  In one of these, No. 25, Sir Walter Scott spent his boyhood and youth. They still exist, and exhibit the care which he took in the elegance and substantiality of his works.\\n\\nI remember my father pointing out to me the extreme care and attention with which he finished his buildings.  He inserted small fragments of basalt into the mortar of the external joints of the stones, at close and regular distances, in order to protect the mortar from the adverse action of the weather.  And to this day they give proof of their efficiency.  The basalt protects the joints, and at the same time gives a neat and pleasing effect to what would otherwise have been merely the monotonous line of mason-work.\\n\\nA great change was about to take place in the residences of the principal people of Edinburgh.  The cry was for more light and more air. The extension of the city to the south and west was not sufficient. There was a great plateau of ground on the north side of the city, beyond the North Loch.  But it was very difficult to reach; being alike steep on both sides of the Loch.  At length, in 1767, an Act was obtained to extend the royalty of the city over the northern fields, and powers were obtained to erect a bridge to connect them with the Old Town.\\n\\nThe magistrates had the greatest difficulty in inducing the inhabitants to build dwellings on the northern side of the city.  A premium was offered to the person who should build the first house; and #20 was awarded to Mr. John Young on account of a mansion erected by him close to George Street.  Exemption from burghal taxes was also granted to a gentleman who built the first house in Princes Street.  My grandfather built the first house in the south-west corner of St. Andrew Square, for the occupation of David Hume the historian, as well as the two most important houses in the centre of the north side of the same square. One of these last was occupied by the venerable Dr. Hamilton, a very conspicuous character in Edinburgh.  He continued to wear the cocked hat, the powdered pigtail, tights, and large shoe buckles, for about sixty years after this costume had become obsolete.  All these houses are still in perfect condition, after resisting the ordinary tear and wear of upwards of a hundred and ten northern winters.  The opposition to building houses across the North Loch soon ceased; and the New Town arose, growing from day to day, until Edinburgh became one of the most handsome and picturesque cities in Europe.\\n\\nThere is one other thing that I must again refer to the highly-finished character of my grandfather's work.  Nothing merely moderate would do. The work must be of the very best.  He took special pride in the sound quality of the woodwork and its careful workmanship.  He chose the best Dantzic timber because of its being of purer grain and freer from knots than other wood.  In those days the lower part of the walls of the apartments were wainscoted--that is, covered by timber framed in large panels.  They were from three to four feet wide, and from six to eight feet high.  To fit these in properly required the most careful joiner-work.\\n\\nIt was always a holiday treat to my father, when a boy, to be permitted to go down to Leith to see the ships discharge their cargoes of timber. My grandfather had a Wood-yard at Leith, where the timber selected by him was piled up to he seasoned and shrunk, before being worked into its appropriate uses.  He was particularly careful in his selection of boards or stripes for floors, which must be perfectly level, so as to avoid the destruction of the carpets placed over them.  The hanging of his doors was a matter that he took great pride in--so as to prevent any uneasy action in opening or closing.  His own chamber doors were so well hung that they were capable of being opened and closed by the slight puff of a hand-bellows.\\n\\nThe excellence of my grandfather's workmanship was a thing that my own father always impressed upon me when a boy.  It stimulated in me the desire to aim at excellence in everything that I undertook; and in all practical matters to arrive at the highest degree of good workmanship. I believe that these early lessons had a great influence upon my future career.\\n\\nI have little to record of my grandmother.  From all accounts she was everything that a wife and mother should be.  My father often referred to her as an example of the affection and love of a wife to her husband, and of a mother to her children.  The only relic I possess of her handiwork is a sampler, dated 1743, the needlework of which is so delicate and neat, that to me it seems to excel everything of the kind that I have seen.\\n\\nI am fain to think that her delicate manipulation in some respects descended to her grandchildren, as all of them have been more or less distinguished for the delicate use of their fingers--which has so much to do with the effective transmission of the artistic faculty into visible forms.  The power of transmitting to paper or canvas the artistic conceptions of the brain through the fingers, and out at the end of the needle, the pencil, the pen, the brush, or even the modelling tool or chisel, is that which, in practical fact, constitutes the true artist.\\n\\nThis may appear a digression; though I cannot look at my grandmother's sampler without thinking that she had much to do with originating the Naesmyth love of the Fine Arts, and their hereditary adroitness in the practice of landscape and portrait painting, and other branches of the profession.\\n\\nMy grandfather died in 1803, at the age of eighty-four, and was buried by his father's side in the Naesmyth ancestral tomb in Greyfriars Churchyard.  His wife, Mary Anderson, who died before him, was buried in the same place.\\n\\nMichael Naesmyth left two sons--Michael and Alexander.  The eldest was born in 1754.  It was intended that he should have succeeded to the business; and, indeed, as soon as he reached manhood he was his father's right-hand man.  He was a skilful workman, especially in the finer parts of joiner-work.  He was also an excellent accountant and bookkeeper.  But having acquired a taste for reading books about voyages and travels, of which his father's library was well supplied, his mind became disturbed, and he determined to see something of the world.  He was encouraged by one of his old companions, who had been to sea, and realised some substantial results by his voyages to foreign parts. Accordingly Michael, notwithstanding the earnest remonstrances of his father, accompanied his friend on the next occasion when he went to sea.\\n\\nAfter several voyages to the West Indies and other parts of the world, which both gratified and stimulated his natural taste for adventures, and also proved financially successful, his trading ventures at last met with a sad reverse, and he resolved to abandon commerce, and enter the service of the Royal Navy.  He was made purser, and in this position he entered upon a new series of adventures.  He was present at many naval engagements.  But he lost neither life nor limb.  At last he was pensioned, and became a resident at Greenwich Hospital. He furnished his apartments with all manner of curiosities, such as his roving naval life had enabled him to collect.  His original skill as a worker in wood came to life again.  The taste of the workman and the handiness of the seaman enabled him to furnish his rooms at the Hospital in a most quaint and amusing manner.\\n\\nMy father had a most affectionate regard for Michael, and usually spent some days with him when he had occasion to visit London.  One bright summer day they went to have a stroll together on Blackheath; and while my uncle was enjoying a nap on a grassy knoll, my father made a sketch of him, which I still preserve.  Being of a most cheerful disposition, and having a great knack of detailing the incidents of his adventurous life, he became a great favourite with the resident officers of the Hospital; and was always regarded by them as real good company. He ended his days there in peace and comfort, in 1819, at the age of sixty-four.\\n\\nCHAPTER 2.   Alexander Nasmyth\\n\\nMy father, Alexander Nasmyth, was the second son of Michael Nasmyth. He was born in his father's house in the Grassmarket on the 9th of September 1758.  The Grassmarket was then a lively place.  On certain days of the week it was busy with sheep and cattle fairs.  It was the centre of Edinburgh traffic.  Most of the inns were situated there, or in the street leading up to the Greyfriars Church gate.\\n\\nThe view from my grandfather's house was very grand.  Standing up, right opposite, was the steep Castle rock, with its crown buildings and circular battery towering high overhead.  They seemed almost to hang over the verge of the rock.  The houses on the opposite side of the Grassmarket were crowded under the esplanade of the Castle Hill.\\n\\nThere was an inn opposite the house where my father was born, from which the first coach started from Edinburgh to Newcastle.  The public notice stated that \\\"The Coach would set out from the Grass Market ilka Tuesday at Twa o'clock in the day, GOD WULLIN', but whether or no on Wednesday.\\\"  The \\\"whether or no\\\" was meant, I presume, as a precaution to passengers, in case all the places on the coach might be taken, or not, on Wednesday,\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  Plan of the Grassmarket\\n\\nThe Grassmarket was also the place for public executions.  The gibbet stone was at the east end of the Market.  It consisted of a mass of solid sandstone, with a quadrangular hole in the middle, which served as a socket for the gallows.  Most of the Covenanters who were executed for conscience' sake in the reigns of Charles II. and James II. breathed their last at this spot.  The Porteous mob, in 1736, had its culmination here.  When Captain Porteous was dragged out of the Tolbooth in the High Street and hurried down the West Bow, the gallows was not in its place; but the leaders of the mob hanged him from a dyer's pole, nearly opposite the gallows stone, on the south side of the street, not far from my grandfather's door\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... See Heart of Midlothian  ...\\\\]\\n\\nI have not much to say about my father's education.  For the most part, he was his own schoolmaster.  I have heard him say that his mother taught him his A B C; and that he afterwards learned to read at Mammy Smith's.  This old lady kept a school for boys and girls at the top of a house in the Grassmarket.  There my father was taught to rear his Bible, and to repeat his Carritch.\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... The Shorter Catechism.  ...\\\\]\\n\\nAs it was only the bigger boys who could read the Bible, the strongest of them consummated the feat by climbing up the Castle rock, and reaching what they called \\\"The Bibler's Seat.\\\"  It must have been a break-neck adventure to get up to the place.  The seat was almost immediately under the window of the room in which James VI was born. My father often pointed it out to me as one of the most dangerous bits of climbing in which he had been engaged in his younger years.\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  The Bibler's seat\\n\\nThe annexed illustration is from his own slight sepia drawing; the Bibler's Seat is marked + Not so daring, but much more mischievous, was a trick which he played with some of his companions on the tops of the houses on the north side of the Grassmarket.  The boys took a barrel to the Castlehill, filled it with small stones, and then shot it down towards the roofs of the houses in the Grassmarket.  The barrel leapt from rock to rock, burst, and scattered a shower of stones far and wide.  The fun was to see the \\\"boddies\\\" look out of their garret windows with their lighted lamps or candles, peer into the dark, and try to see what was the cause of the mischief.\\n\\nSir David Baird, the hero of Seringapatam, played a trick of the same kind before he went to India.\\n\\nAmong my father's favourite companions were the two sons of Dr. John Erskine, minister of Old Greyfriars, in conjunction with the equally celebrated Dr. Robertson.  Dr. Erskine\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... Dr. Erskine is well described by Scott in Guy Mannering, on the occasion when Pleydell and Mannering went to hear him preach a famous sermon.  ...\\\\] was a man of great influence in his day, well known for his literary and theological works, as well as for his piety and practical benevolence.  On one occasion, when my father was at play with his sons, one of them threw a stone, which smashed a neighbour's window. A servant of the house ran out, and seeing the culprit, called out, \\\"Very wee!, Maister Erskine, I'll tell yeer faither wha broke the windae!\\\"  On which the boy, to throw her off the scent, said to his brother loudly, \\\"Eh, keist! she thinks we're the boddy Erskine's sons.\\\"\\n\\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/655](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/655)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639288261,\"title\":\"\\nWinter set in with its usual force in those northern regions.
