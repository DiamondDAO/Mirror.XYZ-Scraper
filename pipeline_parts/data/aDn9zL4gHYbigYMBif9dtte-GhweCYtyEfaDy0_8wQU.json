"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Each subreddit that participates in the program will be able to create “Special Memberships,” which users can purchase with their points. These memberships unlock features like badges, GIFs and animated emojis.\\n\\nThe program will also introduce a “weighted polls” feature, which will give a larger voice to users who have more Community Points, and therefore are active contributors in the subreddit.\\n\\nThe new [website](https://www.reddit.com/community-points/documentation/introduction) explains: “Community Points are a measure of reputation in your community. In the subreddit, they are displayed next to usernames, so the biggest contributors stand out from the crowd.”\\n\\nTokens will be stored on-chain in their personal “Vault,” where they can view, send and use their community points within the Reddit app. Because the points are on the blockchain, users can take their “reputation” and embed it anywhere on the internet.\\n\\n***Related: [Reddit to reportedly tokenize karma points and onboard 500M new users](https://cointelegraph.com/news/reddit-to-reportedly-tokenize-karma-points-and-onboard-500m-new-users)***\\n\\nReddit held a [“Scaling Bake-Off” competition](https://cointelegraph.com/news/here-are-four-ethereum-scaling-pitches-submitted-to-reddits-competition) to choose an Ethereum scaling solution for the program in Aug. 2020.
