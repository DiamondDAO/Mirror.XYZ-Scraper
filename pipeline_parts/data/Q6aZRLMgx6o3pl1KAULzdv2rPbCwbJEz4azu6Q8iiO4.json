Irreplaceable today, replaced tomorrow. Need filled, next desire.**\\n\\nIn high school, you started a tech club with your best friend.\\n\\nThe school had the latest tech. You made a deal to get more access in exchange for solving problems. It was not the same fun other kids had.\\n\\nYour best friend died in an accident, and you asked someone else in the club to help you work on something new. New best friend. You and your new friend made a new deal with another company for a new need.\\n\\nYour friend shows you the future on the cover of a magazine. A funny box but it’s serious business.\\n\\nThat is the beginning of the future, a new desire for a few today, tomorrow another need for many.\\n\\n**You both leave college, and the Northeast behind, and head Southwest to your one customer, the maker of the box. It was hard to use, you said you could make it easier.**\\n\\nYou convinced the customer that they needed what only you could give them. Your story was that you were irreplaceable, and that made you valuable.\\n\\n**You didn’t have anything except for the story. 8 weeks later you delivered on your promise.**\\n\\nThe first office was in a strip mall. You hired your friends from the high school club. A few years later you replaced your first customer.\\n\\nYou all packed up for the Northwest. There were new boxes, new desires, and new needs and wants. New tomorrows. New deals. Next.\\n\\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/5QTxFnGygVM4jFQiBovmRo?si=7630e4f89a9447c2](https://open.spotify.com/track/5QTxFnGygVM4jFQiBovmRo?si=7630e4f89a9447c2)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T5_JCvl6375PvmVZziVfX.png?height=1612&width=1201)\\n\\n8\\\\.2.2 Your Early Desires Will Change\\n\\n2776 Mars, The Collar\\n\\n**When near everything is** possible and replaceable, **near limitless**, what remains must be the irreplaceable, the limited, and near impossible. **As soon as someone has the few it’s coveted by many. Desires chase limits.**\\n\\nThey didn’t call it an empire but that’s what it was.\\n\\nOn holidays, state functions, and the most humble family gatherings, a phrase from the Middle Kingdom of Old Earth, “10,000 Years”, was the usual toast. After the days of exploration became history, and the worlds of the System were tamed, a golden age of began. “10,000 Years!”\\n\\nIt was the beginning of the end.\\n\\nPoliticians, potentates, and pop-stars coveted what was scarce, the “thrones” of power. **Desire broke the center of the dream of “10,000 years”.** A great decentralization began. The System’s unified government fractured into dozens of spheres, all under the shadow of the largest 3 societies.\\n\\nThe Stewards of Earth, the oldest society of “Mother Earth”, who lived in the past.\\n\\nThe Seekers of the Jovian System, the youngest society, descended from Spacers.\\n\\nThe Sentinels of Mars, from humanity’s first wave of exploration, which kept one eye on the future, and the other on the traditions of the past - the ‘middle child’ of the System.\\n\\nTo dampen the threat of civil war, a pact was made. Leadership would be rotated, in theory, every 10 years. It would be decided not by votes but by competition. Peaceful games to quiet rivalries every decade worked for a long time. Something changed.\\n\\nI, John Cadmus, a university dropout, was going to join “The High Laboratories” of Mars.\\n\\nI was going to be trained for a competition to decide which of the three largest tribes of mankind would lead for the next decade.\\n\\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/40riOy7x9W7GXjyGp4pjAv?si=98d72be703914131](https://open.spotify.com/track/40riOy7x9W7GXjyGp4pjAv?si=98d72be703914131)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2dMGxpJOJi2-yyhj0deq6.png?height=1612&width=1201)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1642281265,\"title\":\"1976: 8.2 Your Early Desires Will Change\"},\"digest\":\"nFL_bPsig62edrneb1SgeohLbADZh4mLMKRhSjCvTB4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zPVtMyaQpDsDDVMjJesiMZMonuGdwDy-z4GiCoW285I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Sj1MexBfn8IhGL2V2t3MueP6MdvJoUFmyRgdO4ow8wQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"6gSGp3-dSXAgGi5GmfmIlO3-0ssyg3R_6I1vW8_gV_iL-Y9lf18SbZqblRQFxguWCtQDGHTCq1lqmxxAPcMBWw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x939c3e74a74214d6af1d91162bfa0388ffcf1810af9855b8880f77fac5246e92763b9303b41ee3fbd48236f8d0f8e555ab6e872cb7d0c6983323d6d9cc5c151c1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zPVtMyaQpDsDDVMjJesiMZMonuGdwDy-z4GiCoW285I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Sj1MexBfn8IhGL2V2t3MueP6MdvJoUFmyRgdO4ow8wQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"C9730dVLw4brY5erjPMzRmgKW00gka-qJRvQEx_5M_4\"}"
