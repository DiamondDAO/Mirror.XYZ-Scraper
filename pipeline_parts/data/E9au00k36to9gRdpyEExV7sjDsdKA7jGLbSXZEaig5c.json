"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Oh! see--a lady with two blues! Come and look at her.\\\"\\n\\nBefore they had taken five steps, Zoe stopped short and said, \\\"It is Fanny Dover, I declare. She has not seen us yet. She is short-sighted. Come here.\\\" And the impetuous maid dragged him off behind a tuft of foliage.\\n\\nWhen she had got him there she said hotly that it was too bad.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, is it?\\\" said he, very calmly. \\\"What?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, don't you see what she has done? You, so sensible, to be so slow about women's ways; and you are always pretending to know them. Why, she has gone and bought that costume with the money you gave her to play with.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sensible girl!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dishonest girl, *I* call her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There you go to your big words. No, no. A little money was given her for a bad purpose. She has used it for a frivolous one. That is 'a step in the right direction'--jargon of the day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But to receive money for one purpose, and apply it to another, is--what do you call it--*chose?--de'tournement des fonds*--what is the English word? I've been abroad till I've forgotten English. Oh, I know--embezzlement.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, that is a big word for a small transaction; you have not dug in the mine of the vernacular for nothing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Harrington, if you don't mind, I do; so please come. I'll talk to her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Stop a moment,\\\" said Vizard, very gravely. \\\"You will not say one word to her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And why not, pray?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because it would be unworthy of us, and cruel to her; barbarously cruel. What! call her to account before that old woman and me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why not? She is flaunting her blues before you two, and plenty more.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Feminine logic, Zoe. The point is this--she is poor. You must know that. This comes of poverty and love of dress; not of dishonesty and love of dress; and just ask yourself, is there a creature that ought to be pitied more and handled more delicately than a *poor lady?* Why, you would make her writhe with shame and distress! Well, I do think there is not a single wild animal so cruel to another wild animal as a woman is to a woman. You are cruel to one another by instinct. But I appeal to your reason--if you have any.\\\"\\n\\nZoe's eyes filled. \\\"You are right,\\\" said she, humbly. \\\"Thank you for thinking for me. I will not say a word to her before *you.\\\"*\\n\\n\\\"That is a good girl. But, come now, why say a word at all?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, it is no use your demanding impossibilities, dear. I could no more help speaking to her than I could fly; and don't go fancying she will care a pin what I say, if I don't say it before *a gentleman.\\\"*\\n\\nHaving given him this piece of information, she left her ambush, and proceeded to meet the all-unconscious blue girl; but, even as they went, Vizard returned to his normal condition, and doled out, rather indolently, that they were out on pleasure, and might possibly miss the object of the excursion if they were to encourage a habit of getting into rages about nothing.\\n\\nZoe was better than her word. She met Fanny with open admiration: to be sure, she knew that apathy, or even tranquillity, on first meeting the blues, would be instantly set down to envy.\\n\\n\\\"And where did you get it, dear?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"At quite a small shop.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"French?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no; I think she was an Austrian. This is not a French mixture: loud, discordant colors, that is the French taste.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Here is heresy,\\\" said Vizard. \\\"Why, I thought the French beat the world in dress.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, dear,\\\" said Zoe, \\\"in form and pattern. But Fanny is right; they make mistakes in color. They are terribly afraid of scarlet; but they are afraid of nothing else: and many of their mixtures are as discordant to the eye as Wagner's music to the ear. Now, after all, scarlet is the king of colors; and there is no harm in King Scarlet, if you treat him with respect and put a modest subject next to him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Gypsy locks, for instance,\\\" suggested Fanny, slyly.\\n\\nMiss Maitland owned herself puzzled. \\\"In my day,\\\" said she, \\\"no one ever thought of putting blue upon blue; but really, somehow, it looks well.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"May I tell you why, aunt?--because the dress-maker had a real eye, and has chosen the right tints of blue. It is all nonsense about one color not going with another. Nature defies that; and how? by choosing the very tints of each color that will go together. The sweetest room I ever saw was painted by a great artist; and, do you know, he had colored the ceiling blue and the walls green: and I assure you the effect was heavenly: but, then, he had chosen the exact tints of green and blue that would go together. The draperies were between crimson and maroon. But there's another thing in Fanny's dress; it is velvet. Now, blue velvet is blue to the mind; but it is not blue to the eye. You try and paint blue velvet; you will be surprised how much white you must lay on. The high lights of all velvets are white. This white helps to blend the two tints of blue.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This is very instructive,\\\" said Vizard. \\\"I was not aware I had a sister, youthful, but profound. Let us go in and dine.\\\"\\n\\nFanny demurred. She said she believed Miss Maitland wished to take one turn round the grounds first.\\n\\nMiss Maitland stared, but assented in a mechanical way; and they commenced their promenade.\\n\\nZoe hung back and beckoned her brother. \\\"Miss Maitland!\\\" said she, with such an air. *\\\"She* wants to show her blues to all the world and his wife.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very natural,\\\" said Vizard. \\\"So would you, if you were in a scarlet gown, with a crimson cloak.\\\"\\n\\nZoe laughed heartily at this, and forgave Fanny her new dress: but she had a worse bone than that to pick with her.\\n\\nIt was a short but agreeable promenade to Zoe, for now they were alone, her brother, instead of sneering, complimented her.\\n\\n\\\"Never you mind my impertinence,\\\" said he; \\\"the truth is, I am proud of you. You are an observer.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Me? Oh--in color.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Never mind: an observer is an observer; and genuine observation is not so common. Men see and hear with their prejudices and not their senses. Now we are going to those gaming-tables. At first, of course, you will play; but, as soon as ever you are cleaned out, observe! Let nothing escape that woman's eye of yours: and so we'll get something for our money.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Harrington,\\\" said the girl proudly, \\\"I will be all eye and ear.\\\"\\n\\nSoon after this they went in to dinner. Zoe cast her eyes round for Severne, and was manifestly disappointed at his not meeting them even there.\\n\\nAs for Fanny, she had attracted wonderful attention in the garden, and was elated; her conscience did not prick her in the least, for such a trifle as *de'tournement des fonds;* and public admiration did not improve her: she was sprightly and talkative as usual; but now she was also a trifle brazen, and pert all round.\\n\\nAnd so the dinner passed, and they proceeded to the gaming-tables.\\n\\nMiss Maitland and Zoe led. Fanny and Harrington followed: for Miss Dover, elated by the blues--though, by-the-by, one hears of them as depressing--and encouraged by admiration and Chevet's violet-perfumed St. Peray, took Harrington's arm, really as if it belonged to her.\\n\\nThey went into the library first, and, after a careless inspection, came to the great attraction of the place. They entered one of the gambling-rooms.\\n\\nThe first impression was disappointing. There were two very long tables, rounded off at the ends: one for *trente et quarante* and one for *roulette.* At each table were seated a number of persons, and others standing behind them. Among the persons seated was the dealer, or, in roulette, the spinner. This official sat in the center, flanked on each side by croupiers with rakes; but at each end of the table there was also a croupier with his rake.\\n\\nThe rest were players or lookers-on; most of whom, by well-known gradations of curiosity and weakness, to describe which minutely would be to write a little comedy that others have already written, were drawn into playing at last. So fidgets the moth about the candle before he makes up what, no doubt, the poor little soul calls his mind.\\n\\nOur little party stopped first at *trente et quarante,* and Zoe commenced her observations. Instead of the wild excitement she had heard of, there was a subdued air, a forced quiet, especially among the seated players. A stern etiquette presided, and the gamblers shrouded themselves in well-bred stoicism--losing without open distress or ire, winning without open exultation. The old hands, especially, began play with a padlock on the tongue and a mask upon the face. There are masks, however, that do not hide the eye; and Miss Vizard caught some flashes that escaped the masks even then at the commencement of the play. Still, external stoicism prevailed, on the whole, and had a fixed example in the *tailleur* and the croupiers. Playing many hours every day in the year but Good-Friday, and always with other people's money, these men had parted with passion, and almost with sensation; they had become skillful automata, chanting a stave, and raking up or scattering hay-cocks of gold, which to them were counters.\\n\\nIt was with the monotonous voice of an automaton they intoned:\\n\\n\\\"Faites le jeu, messieu, messieu.\\\"\\n\\nThen, after a pause of ten seconds:\\n\\n\\\"Le jeu est fait, messien.\\\"\\n\\nThen, after two seconds:\\n\\n\\\"Rien ne va plus.\\\"\\n\\nThen mumble--mumble--mumble.\\n\\nThen, \\\"La' Rouge perd et couleur,\\\" or whatever might be the result.\\n\\nThen the croupiers first raked in the players' losses with vast expedition; next, the croupiers in charge of the funds chucked the precise amount of the winnings on to each stake with unerring dexterity and the indifference of machines; and the chant recommenced, \\\"Faites le jeu, messieu.\\\"\\n\\nPause, ten seconds.\\n\\n\\\"Le jeu est fait, messieu.\\n\\nPause, two seconds.\\n\\n\\\"Rien ne va plus.\\\"\\n\\nThe *tailleur* dealt, and the croupier intoned, \\\"La'! Rouge gagne et couleur perd:\\\" the mechanical raking and dexterous chucking followed.\\n\\nThis, with a low buzzing, and the deadened jingle of gold upon green cloth, and the light grating of the croupiers' rakes, was the first impression upon Zoe's senses; but the mere game did not monopolize her attention many seconds. There were other things better worth noting: the great varieties of human type that a single passion had brought together in a small German town. Her ear was regaled with such a polyglot murmur as she had read of in Genesis, but had never witnessed before.\\n\\nHere were the sharp Tuscan and the mellow Roman; the sibilation of England, the brogue of Ireland, the shibboleth of the Minories, the twang of certain American States, the guttural expectoration of Germany, the nasal emphasis of France, and even the modulated Hindoostanee, and the sonorous Spanish, all mingling.\\n\\nThe types of face were as various as the tongues.\\n\\nHere were the green-eyed Tartar, the black-eyed Italian, and the gray-eyed Saxon; faces all cheek-bones, and faces no cheek-bones; the red Arabian, the fair Dane, and the dark Hindoo.\\n\\nHer woman's eye seized another phenomenon--the hands. Not nations only, but varieties of the animal kingdom were represented. Here were the white hands of fair women, and the red paws of obese shop-keepers, and the yellow, bird-like claws of old withered gamesters, all stretched out, side by side, in strange contrast, to place the stakes or scratch in the winnings; and often the winners put their palms or paws on their heap of gold, just as a dog does on a bone when other dogs are nigh.\\n\\nBut what Zoe's eye rested on longest were the costume and deportment of the ladies. A few were in good taste; others aimed at a greater variety of beautiful colors than the fair have, up to this date, succeeded in combining, without inflicting more pain on the beholders than a beneficent Creator--so far as we can judge by his own system of color--intended the cultivated eye to suffer. Example--as the old writers used to say--one lady fired the air in primrose satin, with red-velvet trimming. This mild mixture re-appeared on her head in a primrose hat with a red feather. A gold chain, so big that it would have done for a felon instead of a fool, encircled her neck, and was weighted with innumerable lockets, which in size and inventive taste resembled a poached egg, and betrayed the insular goldsmith. A train three yards long completed this gorgeous figure. She had commenced life a shrimp-girl, and pushed a dredge before her, instead of pulling a silken besom after her. Another stately queen (with an \\\"a\\\") heated the atmosphere with a burnous of that color the French call *flamme d'enfer,* and cooled it with a green bonnet. A third appeared to have been struck with the beauty of a painter's palette, and the skill with which its colors mix before the brush spoils them. Green body, violet skirts, rose-colored trimmings, purple sleeves, light green boots, lavender gloves. A shawl all gauze and gold, flounced like a petticoat; a bonnet so small, and red feather so enormous and all-predominant, that a peacock seemed to be sitting on a hedge sparrow's nest.\\n\\nZoe suspected these polychromatic ladies at a glance, and observed their manners, in a mistrustful spirit, carefully. She was little surprised, though a good deal shocked, to find that some of them seemed familiar, and almost jocular, with the croupiers; and that, although they did not talk loud, being kept in order by the general etiquette, they rustled and fidgeted and played in a devil-may-care sort of manner. This was in great measure accounted for by the circumstance that they were losing other people's money: at all events, they often turned their heads over their shoulders, and applied for fresh funds to their male companions.\\n\\nZoe blushed at all this, and said to Vizard, \\\"I should like to see the other rooms.\\\" She whispered to Miss Maitland, \\\"Surely they are not very select in this one.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lead on,\\\" said Vizard; \\\"that is the way.\\\"\\n\\nFanny had not parted with his arm all this time. As they followed the others, he said, \\\"But she will find it is all the same thing.\\\"\\n\\nFanny laughed in his face. \\\"Don't you *see?* C'est la chasse au Severne qui commence.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"En voil'a un se'v'ere,\\\" replied he.\\n\\nShe was mute. She had not learned that sort of French in her finishing-school. I forgive it.\\n\\nThe next room was the same thing over again.\\n\\nZoe stood a moment and drank everything in, then turned to Vizard, blushed, and said, \\\"May we play a little now?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, of course.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Fanny!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No; you begin, dear. We will stand by and wish you success.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are a coward,\\\" said Zoe, loftily; and went to the table with more changes of color than veteran lancers betray in charging infantry. It was the *roulette* table she chose. That seems a law of her sex. The true solution is not so profound as some that have been offered. It is this: *trente et quarante* is not only unintelligible, but uninteresting. At *roulette* there is a pictorial object and dramatic incident; the board, the turning of the *moulinet,* and the swift revolutions of an ivory ball, its lowered speed, its irregular bounds, and its final settlement in one of the many holes, numbered and colored. Here the female understanding sees something it can grasp, and, above all, the female eye catches something pictorial and amusing outside the loss or gain; and so she goes, by her nature, to *roulette,* which is a greater swindle than the other.\\n\\nZoe staked five pounds on No. 21, for an excellent reason; she was in her twenty-first year. The ball was so illogical as to go into No. 3, and she lost. She stood by her number and lost again. She lost thirteen times in succession.\\n\\nThe fourteenth time the ball rolled into 21, and the croupier handed her thirty-five times her stake, and a lot more for color.\\n\\nHer eye flashed, and her cheek flushed, and I suppose she was tempted to bet more heavily, for she said, \\\"No. That will never happen to me again, I know;\\\" and she rose, the richer by several napoleons, and said, \\\"Now let us go to another.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Humph!\\\" said Vizard. \\\"What an extraordinary girl! She will give the devil more trouble than most of you. Here's precocious prudence.\\\"\\n\\nFanny laughed in his face. \\\"C'est la chasse qui recommence,\\\" said she.\\n\\nI ought to explain that when she was in England she did not interlard her discourse with French scraps. She was not so ill-bred. But abroad she had got into a way of it, through being often compelled to speak French.\\n\\nVizard appreciated the sagacity of the remark, but he did not like the lady any the better for it. He meditated in silence. He remembered that, when they were in the garden. Zoe had hung behind, and interpreted Fanny ill-naturedly; and here was Fanny at the same game, literally backbiting, or back-nibbling, at all events. Said he to himself, \\\"And these two are friends! female friends.\\\" And he nursed his misogyny in silence.\\n\\nThey came into a very noble room, the largest of all, with enormous mirrors down to the ground, and a ceiling blazing with gold, and the air glittering with lusters. Two very large tables, and a distinguished company at each, especially at the *trente et quarante.*\\n\\nBefore our little party had taken six steps into the room, Zoe stood like a pointer; and Fanny backed.\\n\\nShould these terms seem disrespectful, let Fanny bear the blame. It is her application of the word \\\"chasse\\\" that drew down the simile.\\n\\nYes, there sat Ned Severne, talking familiarly to Joseph Ashmead, and preparing to \\\"put the pot on,\\\" as he called it.\\n\\nNow Zoe was so far gone that the very sight of Severne was a balsam to her. She had a little bone to pick with him; and when he was out of sight, the bone seemed pretty large. But when she saw his adorable face, unconscious, as it seemed, of wrong, the bone faded and the face shone.\\n\\nHer own face cleared at the sight of him: she turned back to Fanny and Vizard, arch and smiling, and put her finger to her mouth, as much as to say, \\\"Let us have some fun. We have caught our truant: let us watch him, unseen, a little, before we burst on him.\\\"\\n\\nVizard enjoyed this, and encouraged her with a nod.\\n\\nThe consequence was that Zoe dropped Miss Maitland's arm, who took that opportunity to turn up her nose, and began to creep up like a young cat after a bird; taking a step, and then pausing; then another step, and a long pause; and still with her eye fixed on Severne. He did not see her, nor her companions, partly because they were not in front of him, but approaching at a sharp angle, and also because he was just then beginning to bet heavily on his system. By this means, two progressive events went on contemporaneously: the arch but cat-like advance of Zoe, with pauses, and the betting of Severne, in which he gave himself the benefit of his system.\\n\\n*Noir* having been the last to win, he went against the alternation and put fifty pounds on *noir.* Red won. Then, true to his system, he doubled on the winning color. One hundred pounds on red. Black won. He doubled on black, and red won; and there were four hundred pounds of his five hundred gone in five minutes.\\n\\nOn this proof that the likeliest thing to happen--viz., alternation of the color--does *sometime* happen, Severne lost heart.\\n\\nHe turned to Ashmead, with all the superstition of a gambler, \\\"For God's sake, bet for me!\\\" said he. He clutched his own hair convulsively, in a struggle with his mania, and prevailed so far as to thrust fifty pounds into his own pocket, to live on, and gave Ashmead five tens.\\n\\n\\\"Well, but,\\\" said Ashmead, \\\"you must tell me what to do.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1637668853,\"title\":\"\\nZoe blushed, but would not hear--\\\"And it is so good of you to make a friend of me, and talk sense\"},\"digest\":\"fqTc7CClzr2EgYAVqlwxceo7RQhuzdXRpZK68oxUhzA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x51D393CD2fE363A89232ff9D8Ac75A13bD6a52e7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1CaR6TxmLdiv-p5EY_0MrAfSZIRLj9Ees7-QKldqGYM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"bcMzvjnPM189ObhrAPnuP93zHv1XLAXRwvsKu-uJo6E\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"5ZIjB46PD_DHYeb3OYoj3bXkJ51EbI-ZgnVzacQdVvQ-yy6MC00zukBoIWfuBfO9meIkaBpWXpVFpIogC1DWLQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4b4746f1a4a2f1a93364f9f994251ab727ecde1d4353edf5b9ec582ccf7659563f9288d82e1ce6fa2c6b8ad6fa484faaf6cbdd172e2492afb94d684e8ede4fd41b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1CaR6TxmLdiv-p5EY_0MrAfSZIRLj9Ees7-QKldqGYM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"bcMzvjnPM189ObhrAPnuP93zHv1XLAXRwvsKu-uJo6E\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"fqTc7CClzr2EgYAVqlwxceo7RQhuzdXRpZK68oxUhzA\"}"
