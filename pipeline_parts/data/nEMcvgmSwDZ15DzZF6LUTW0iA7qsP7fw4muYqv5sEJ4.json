"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"there was left in this room only a few old red cushions, and the Wainwrights were camping upon the floor. Marjory was enwrapped in Coleman's macintosh, and while the professor and his wife maintained some low talk of the recent incident she in silence had turned her cheek into the yellow velvet collar of the coat. She felt something against her bosom, and putting her hand carefully into the top pocket of the coat she found three cigars. These she took in the darkness and laid aside, telling herself to remember their position in the morning. She had no doubt that Coleman: would rejoice over them, before he could get back to, Athens where there were other good cigars.\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII.\\n\\nTHE ladies of the Wainwright party had not complained at all when deprived of even such civilised advantages as a shelter and a knife and fork and soap and water, but Mrs. Wainwright complained bitterly amid the half-civilisation of Arta. She could see here no excuse for the absence of several hundred things which she had always regarded as essential to life. She began at 8.30 A. M. to make both the professor and Marjory woeful with an endless dissertation upon the beds in the hotel at Athens. Of course she had not regarded them at the time as being exceptional beds \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* that was quite true, \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* but then one really never knew what one was really missing until one really missed it \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* She would never have thought that she would come to consider those Athenian beds as excellent \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* but experience is a great teacher \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* makes- one reflect upon the people who year in and year out have no beds at all, poor things. \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* Well, it made one glad if one did have a good bed, even if it was at the time on the other side of the world. If she ever reached it she did not know what could ever induce her to leave it again. \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* She would never be induced---\\n\\n\\\"'Induced!'\\\" snarled the professor. The word represented to him a practiced feminine misusage of truth, and at such his white warlock always arose. \\\"\\\" Induced!' Out of four American women I have seen lately, you seem to be the only one who would say that you had endured this thing because you had been 'induced' by others to come over here. How absurd!\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Wainwright fixed her husband with a steely eye. She saw opportunity for a shattering retort. \\\" You don't mean, Harrison, to include Marjory and I in the same breath with those two women? \\\"\\n\\nThe professor saw no danger ahead for himself. He merely answered: \\\" I had no thought either way. It did not seem important.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Well, it is important,\\\" snapped Mrs. Wainwright.\\n\\n\\\" Do you know that you are speaking in the same breath of Marjory and Nora Black, the actress? \\\"\\n\\n\\\" No,\\\" said the professor. \\\" Is that so ? \\\" He was astonished, but he was not aghast at all. \\\"Do you mean to say that is Nora Black, the comic opera star ? \\\"\\n\\n\\\" That's exactly who she is,\\\" said Mrs. Wainwright, dramatically. \\\" And I consider that-I consider that Rufus Coleman has done no less than-misled us.\\\"\\n\\nThis last declaration seemed to have no effect upon the professor's pure astonishment, but Marjory looked at her mother suddenly. However, she said no word, exhibiting again that strange and, inscrutable countenance which masked even the tiniest of her maidenly emotions.\\n\\nMrs. Wainwright was triumphant, and she immediately set about celebrating her victory. \\\" Men never see those things,\\\" she said to her husband. \\\" Men never see those things. You would have gone on forever without finding out that your-your- hospitality was, being abused by that Rufus Coleman.\\\"\\n\\nThe professor woke up.\\\" Hospitality ?\\\" he said, indignantly. \\\" Hospitality ? I have not had any hospitality to be abused. Why don't you talk sense? It is not that, but-it might-\\\" He hesitated and then spoke slowly. \\\" It might be very awkward. Of course one never knows anything definite about such people, but I suppose \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* Anyhow, it was strange in Coleman to allow her to meet us. \\\"\\n\\n\\\"It Was all a pre-arranged plan,\\\" announced the  triumphant Mrs. Wainwright. \\\" She came here on putpose  to meet Rufus Coleman, and he knew it, and I should not wonder if they had not the exact spot picked out where  they were going to meet.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can hardly believe that,\\\" said the professor, in distress.  \\\"I can, hardly believe that. It does, not seem to me that  Coleman--\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Oh yes. Your dear Rufus Coleman,\\\" cried Mrs. Wainwright. \\\" You think he is very fine now. But  I can remember when you didn't think---\\\"\\n\\nAnd the parents turned together an abashed look at their daughter. The professor actually flushed with shame. It seemed to him that he had just committed an atrocity upon the heart of his child. The instinct of each of them was to go to her and console her in their arms. She noted it immediately, and seemed to fear it. She spoke in a clear and even voice.  \\\" I don't think, father, that you should distress me by supposing that I am concerned at all if Mr. Coleman cares to get Nora Black over here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Not at all,\\\" stuttered the professor. \\\" I---\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Wainwright's consternation turned suddenly to, anger. \\\" He is a scapegrace. A rascal. A-- a--\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Oh,\\\" said Marjory, coolly, \\\" I don't see why it isn't his own affair. He didn't really present her to you, mother, you remember? She seemed quite to force her way at first, and then you-you did the rest. It should be very easy to avoid her, now that we are out of the wilderness. And then it becomes a private matter of Mr. Coleman's. For my part, I rather liked her. I don't see such a dreadful calamity.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marjory!\\\" screamed her mother. \\\"How dreadful. Liked her! Don't let me hear you say such shocking things.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" I fail to see anything shocking,\\\" answered Marjory, stolidly.\\n\\nThe professor was looking helplessly from his     daughter to his wife, and from his wife to his daughter, like a man who was convinced that his troubles would never end. This new catastrophe created a different kind of difficulty, but he considered that the difficulties were as robust as had been the preceding ones. He put on his hat and went out of the room. He felt an impossibility of saying anything to  Coleman, but he felt that he must look upon him. He must look upon this man and try to know from his manner the measure of guilt. And incidentally he longed for the machinery of a finished society which prevents its parts from clashing, prevents it with its great series of I law upon law, easily operative but  relentless. Here he felt as a man flung into the jungle with his wife and daughter, where they could become the victims of any sort of savagery. His thought referred once more to what he considered the invaluable services of Coleman, and as he observed them in conjunction with the present accusation, he was simply dazed. It was then possible that one man could play two such divergent parts. He had not learned this at Washurst. But no; the world was not such a bed of putrefaction. He would not believe it; he would not believe it.\\n\\nAfter adventures which require great nervous en. durance, it is only upon the second or third night that the common man sleeps hard. The students had expected to slumber like dogs on the first night after their trials. but none slept long, And few slept.\\n\\nColeman was the first man to arise. When he left the room the students were just beginning to blink. He took his dragoman among the shops and he bought there all the little odds and ends which might go to make up the best breakfast in Arta. If he had had news of certain talk he probably would not have been buying breakfast for eleven people. Instead, he would have been buying breakfast for one. During his absence the students arose and performed their frugal toilets. Considerable attention was paid to Coke by the others. \\\" He made a monkey of you,\\\" said Peter Tounley with unction. \\\" He twisted you until you looked like a wet, grey rag. You had  better leave this wise guy alone.\\\"\\n\\nIt was not the night nor was it meditation that had taught Coke anything, but he seemed to have learned something from the mere lapse of time. In appearance he was subdued, but he managed to make a temporary jauntiness as he said : \\\" Oh, I don't know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Well, you ought to know,\\\" said he who was called Billie. \\\"You ought to know. You made an egregious snark of yourself. Indeed, you sometimes resembled a boojum. Anyhow, you were a plain chump. You exploded your face about something of which you knew nothing, and I'm damned if I believe you'd make even a good retriever.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You're a half-bred water-spaniel,\\\" blurted Peter Tounley. \\\"And,\\\" he added, musingly, \\\"that is a pretty low animal.\\\"\\n\\nCoke was argumentative. \\\"Why am I? \\\" he asked, turning his head from side to side. \\\" I don't see where I was so wrong.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Oh, dances, balloons, picnics, parades and ascensions,\\\" they retorted, profanely. \\\" You swam voluntarily into water that was too deep for you. Swim out. Get dry. Here's a towel.\\\"\\n\\nCoke, smitten in the face with a wet cloth rolled into a ball, grabbed it and flung it futilely at a well-dodging companion \\\" No,\\\" he cried, \\\" I don't see it. Now look here. I don't see why we shouldn't all resent this Nora Black business.\\\"\\n\\nOne student said: \\\"Well, what's the matter with Nora B lack, anyhow ?\\\"\\n\\nAnother student said \\\"I don't see how you've been issued any license to say things about Nora Black.\\\"\\n\\nAnother student said dubiously: \\\" Well, he knows her well.\\\"\\n\\nAnd then three or four spoke at once. \\\" He was very badly rattled when she appeared upon the scene.\\\"\\n\\nPeter Tounley asked: \\\"Well, which of you people know anything wrong about Nora Black? \\\"\\n\\nThere was a pause, and then Coke said: \\\" Oh, of course-I don't know-but-\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1638928721,\"title\":\"The earlier artillery battles had frightened most of the furniture out of the houses \"},\"digest\":\"Vnr6yIJ4g0DMD0h5KwDI6uCQqb-QsmifuBCoDH_HQ5M\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xebb47BcE22955a8570D5570840798eda13Ec89EB\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3QxX69fXnK_12BalMsmWOC8eHovN7SVRVMGIozI9IiM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZFqQgNDDcQhzOGEBtaZS5SDjBr2W85kIcqoOPaRjsuo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"XwiKnQ_O27RfhAdLyEjLsjLoSRHQN1PjZkHq7QsiE2076tcb4VUZHaD07lbIx2nQKN3C8W1vGV8oKyVlvtc8OQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x6d9f75b03b1962c45dc681937fc0254eba84fe8256ca9c3a77ad7aa9af3f40be3ec8c3b1dce444933e73cfeab3b10243d1fa34de445766675fc2f40e28a89a471c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3QxX69fXnK_12BalMsmWOC8eHovN7SVRVMGIozI9IiM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZFqQgNDDcQhzOGEBtaZS5SDjBr2W85kIcqoOPaRjsuo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Vnr6yIJ4g0DMD0h5KwDI6uCQqb-QsmifuBCoDH_HQ5M\"}"
