"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I started NFTs about 4 months ago. My sibling kept sending me youtube links to a tutorial on OpenSea minting. It was unfamiliar and looked costly but I was intrigued. \\n\\nAfter a few more of these video suggestions, my sibling had succeeded in convincing me to try it out. He said, ‘you’re artistic, this could be the next big thing’. So I got a Meta Mask wallet, paid the $60 gas fee (at the time it was required to begin minting) and minted my first NFT sometime later. But my first major revelation with NFTs was on Wax Mainnet, in a little place called Atomic Hub (a market for Wax mainnet NFTs).\\n\\nIt was clumsy and strange doing the first mint but shortly afterwards, I somehow ended up in Telegram groups with amazing, varied people from all over the world. Some from the UK, some from Europe and a handful from the United States.\\n\\nAfter a few weeks, I was playing crypto games on my phone, on my browser and constantly checking the price of the latest new packs, land sales and Alien Worlds tools. It was an exciting and new time. I talked people’s ears off irl. \\n\\nAs the dust settles, you get into patterns and the pattern with NFTs is this:\\n\\nWake up, check news, crypto prices and Bitcoin price. \\n\\nRead all your messages on Discord and Telegram.\\n\\nCheck commissions, vote, any earnings?\\n\\nThen you move on to looking at Twitter for any new crypto, nft collection or free giveaways. Others in my circle are hardcore grinders, meaning they go into discord chats of new nft brands with very few members and grind in the chat by talking for hours until they are approved for an early ‘pre sale minting’ or a whitelist status on their Solana or ETH address.\\n\\nBy getting in early, these guys sometimes land great profits before the public sale / public mint goes live.\\n\\nBut I usually don’t participate as I have a more laid back approach. I mainly read news, look for new things everywhere I can and mine steadily whatever game I happen to be playing these days.\\n\\nIn today’s early crypto days, I mine in Alien Worlds, play Splinterlands, and hope and pray I can get Aavegotchi lands before its too late. I move along when a game is dead but some games have an enduring fan base like Alien Worlds, so I am stubborn like that.\\n\\nHere goes nothing! Thanks to Mirror folkz for setting up a wonderful DAO to try out.\\n\\nnft dude\",\"timestamp\":1636494851,\"title\":\"Begin: diary of a nft dude\"},\"digest\":\"ZSexOTztvKpsXuxpepLI3G4wFX53MvsDTDDD02Roys4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xE8A9a94a452C29abd9D0733B713CAd43528e8802\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZxxagJYlLlhzXrpa7sLnnc7fG6fuyfRIZxaFnHNr-zc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zYo_5m3kDuMRVubzQRFlRpAYVGiT0ekbz9JmhRhC7Eo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"xvd86UBJSrDmMbfacBUT6HTrFl5t9RWc7GiNtV4imZT4yySZDIoCtibhF8fISZcOEsqadX5hjJeWMa-rDLDEtA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x76bde98bb20c2c1af676f089d01b98b4d3bd6b003da63c5b148ff61ed5b647ad562f7f194c7f479dad708db873d5bb040c3e9b1e7a19a7700148b74dc2e1d25d1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZxxagJYlLlhzXrpa7sLnnc7fG6fuyfRIZxaFnHNr-zc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zYo_5m3kDuMRVubzQRFlRpAYVGiT0ekbz9JmhRhC7Eo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ZSexOTztvKpsXuxpepLI3G4wFX53MvsDTDDD02Roys4\"}"
