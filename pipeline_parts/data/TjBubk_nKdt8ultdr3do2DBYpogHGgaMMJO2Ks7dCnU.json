"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Bored Ape Yacht Club's disinterested-looking ape NFTs have a rabid following. Here’s why these surging Ethereum NFTs are in such high demand.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MytskwK7hYm3szfeRpy1S.png?height=787&width=1400)\\n\\n#### In brief\\n\\n* Bored Ape Yacht Club is a popular series of NFT profile pictures minted on the Ethereum blockchain.\\n* They typically sell for many thousands of dollars, and some are even owned and used by pro athletes and other celebrities.\\n\\nNFT avatars [blew up in 2021](https://decrypt.co/79340/nft-sales-record-ethereum-one-validating-day), commanding up to millions of dollars apiece for individual images that could be collected and used on social media, and driving billions of dollars’ worth of collective trading volume in the process.\\n\\n[CryptoPunks](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-are-cryptopunks-ethereum-nft-avatars) are the OG [Ethereum](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-ethereum-quickly-explained-four-minute-guide) NFTs, having been created back in 2017—well before anyone outside of crypto die-hards knew or cared about provably scarce digital collectibles. But among the more recent crop of projects inspired by CryptoPunks, there’s none larger than Bored Ape Yacht Club.\\n\\nBored Ape NFTs have now generated more than $750 million worth of trading volume, including subsequent variant sets, per data from [CryptoSlam](https://cryptoslam.io/). And they are increasingly the Twitter NFT avatar of choice for athletes, musicians, and more. Buying a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT grants access to the titular “club” of sorts, and membership has benefits.\\n\\nThinking about “aping in” and buying one? Here’s what you need to know about the Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, and Bored Ape Kennel Club, and how to buy them.\\n\\n## What is the Bored Ape Yacht Club?\\n\\nDeveloped by Yuga Labs, the Bored Ape Yacht Club is a collection of 10,000 profile pictures minted as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. An [NFT](https://decrypt.co/resources/non-fungible-tokens-nfts-explained-guide-learn-blockchain), or non-fungible token, acts like a deed of ownership for a digital item, allowing buyers to prove that they own the one-and-only version of that image. In this case, buyers own an illustration of a disinterested-looking ape with randomly-generated traits and accessories. No two images are exactly alike.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/TheSandboxGame/status/1435346830641045505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1435346830641045505%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F86146%2Fbiggest-nft-marketplace-challengers-opensea](https://twitter.com/TheSandboxGame/status/1435346830641045505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1435346830641045505%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F86146%2Fbiggest-nft-marketplace-challengers-opensea)\\n\\nThe Bored Ape Yacht Club is not alone on that front, as there are many other popular NFT avatar collections that have sprung up of late—including [Pudgy Penguins](https://decrypt.co/78418/pudgy-penguins-ethereum-nft-craze-takes-flight) and 0N1 Force. But the Bored Apes have found an avid base of collectors, plus there are perks.\\n\\n#### Did you know?\\n\\nAs of publishing, the record sale for a single Bored Ape NFT is [740 ETH](https://cryptoslam.io/bored-ape-yacht-club/mint/3749), or just over $2.9 million, in September 2021. It was [purchased by the developer](https://decrypt.co/80497/why-ethereum-game-sandbox-buying-nfts-bored-ape) of the upcoming Ethereum game, The Sandbox.\\n\\n## What’s so special about them?\\n\\nAs the name suggests, the Bored Ape Yacht Club is billed as an exclusive society or social organization, and owning one of the coveted NFTs unlocks that membership. It earns users access to an exclusive Discord server, for example, where fellow owners—[including celebrities](https://decrypt.co/79676/nba-star-stephen-curry-buys-ethereum-bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-for-180k)—hang out and chat. And Apes tend to flock together on social media, where the increasingly familiar avatars have united a digital brotherhood of sorts.\\n\\nPerhaps more importantly, owning a Bored Ape NFT earns you access to *additional* NFT collectibles, which can then be resold for potentially considerable amounts of cash. Yuga Labs first offered free Bored Ape Kennel Club dog NFTs to Bored Ape owners, and then later released free “mutant serum” NFTs that generated a [Mutant Ape Yacht Club](https://decrypt.co/79718/bored-ape-yacht-club-sells-96-million-of-nfts-in-hour-for-mutant-apes-launch) image. It’s almost like paying a one-time fee for an ongoing subscription plan for NFTs and perks.\\n\\n## How to buy Bored Apes\\n\\nBored Ape Yacht Club NFTs are available through secondary markets, most notably [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). To purchase a [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub), [Bored Ape Kennel Club](https://opensea.io/collection/bored-ape-kennel-club), or [Mutant Ape Yacht Club](https://opensea.io/collection/mutant-ape-yacht-club) NFT on OpenSea, simply visit the project page for each to view the entire collection.\\n\\nSome may be listed for sale at a fixed price, while others can be listed for auction. You will need an Ethereum [wallet](https://decrypt.co/?post_type=post&p=5702), such as [MetaMask](https://decrypt.co/50431/metamask-crypto-wallet-review), to purchase an NFT on the site, as well as enough ETH to cover both the purchase price and Ethereum gas transaction fee.\\n\\n#### Did you know?\\n\\nA Sotheby’s auction in September 2021 [sold a lot of 101 Bored Ape NFTs](https://decrypt.co/80578/sothebys-bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-auction-yields-24-million) for nearly $24.4 million, beating the top-end estimate of $18 million.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/BoredApeYC/status/1435976278797164551?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1435976278797164551%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F86146%2Fbiggest-nft-marketplace-challengers-opensea](https://twitter.com/BoredApeYC/status/1435976278797164551?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1435976278797164551%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F86146%2Fbiggest-nft-marketplace-challengers-opensea)\\n\\n## The future\\n\\nIn terms of trading volume, the Bored Ape Yacht Club is the second-most-popular profile picture NFT collection behind CryptoPunks at the time of publication—and they’ve only been around since April 2021.\\n\\nGradually, we’ve seen more and more prominent people using Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs as their social media avatars. Three-time NBA champion Stephen Curry [bought one for $180,000](https://decrypt.co/79676/nba-star-stephen-curry-buys-ethereum-bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-for-180k) worth of Ethereum in August 2021, joining [a list of athlete owners](https://decrypt.co/79953/nba-nfl-mlb-stars-ethereum-nft-bored-ape-yacht-club-cryptopunks) that includes fellow NBA stars Josh Hart and Tyrese Haliburton, as well as NFL players Dez Bryant and Von Miller. Musicians like The Chainsmokers, Waka Flocka Flame, and Jermaine Dupri also own Apes.\\n\\nEven Arizona Iced Tea bought a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT and used it in marketing materials. However, [Yuga Labs told ](https://decrypt.co/79231/arizona-iced-tea-bored-ape-nft-brand-use-inappropriate)*[Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/79231/arizona-iced-tea-bored-ape-nft-brand-use-inappropriate)* that while the drink brand can use the image of the NFT it owns, its usage of the official Bored Apes branding was “inappropriate.”\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/DrinkAriZona/status/1428805448031948800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1428805448031948800%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F86146%2Fbiggest-nft-marketplace-challengers-opensea](https://twitter.com/DrinkAriZona/status/1428805448031948800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1428805448031948800%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F86146%2Fbiggest-nft-marketplace-challengers-opensea)\\n\\nIn addition to giving existing Bored Ape owners a “mutant serum” to mint a free Mutant Ape NFT, Yuga Labs also released 10,000 new Mutant Apes that anyone could purchase for 3 ETH. The entire set [sold out within an hour](https://decrypt.co/79718/bored-ape-yacht-club-sells-96-million-of-nfts-in-hour-for-mutant-apes-launch) in late August 2021, generating $96 million in the process.\\n\\nAt this point, the big question is: how many more NFTs will Bored Ape owners get, what other perks could come, and what will Yuga Labs do next? We’ve seen Larva Labs [sign with a Hollywood talent agency](https://decrypt.co/79895/cryptopunks-go-hollywood-larva-labs-signs-talent-agency-uta) to bring CryptoPunks and Meebits to TV, movies, and more.
