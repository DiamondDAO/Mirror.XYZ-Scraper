"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Background:**\\n\\nAs someone who has long been a fan of video games & an economics enthusiast, the intersection of game monetisation has been fascinating for me.\\n\\n### Creating skins for different characters (similar to dota and league of legends)\\n\\n**Description:** Creating different tiers of character skins, ones that are simply cosmetic changes, to ones that have different skillshot animations / effects.\\n\\n* Just Cosmetic Change -\\n* Skillset Based - Examples being Sova's ulti being a different color and different animation.\\n* Customizable cosmetics - Similar to the chromas offered in League of Legends, customizable cosmetics is a branch of cosmetic changes which have additional settings / configurations that can be changed between games.\\n\\n**Target Audience:** Players who like main-ing one character and have an affinity towards their skillset. They play this game competitively (definition of this is solo queing for several hours a week).\\n\\n**Pros:**\\n\\n* An extension of customization in the game. Allows people to show their personality / who they are even more.\\n* A new revenue stream to leverage from existing user base\\n\\n**Cons:**\\n\\n* Can make the game confusing for new players (who is this)\\n* If not implemented properly, could make the game feel overwhelming (too many animations detract from core gameplay)\\n* Not all heroes can have skillsets that can change without severely impacting core gameplay.\\n\\nPotential Price - **Same pricing as gun skins 875 - 3500VP (\\\\~7.5 - 32 USD)**\\n\\n### Subscription for a set of skins\\n\\nDescription - This is giving players access to a set of skins on a monthly basis that they can use but they don't own. Different tiers can be created based on what effects they have and how expensive the original skins are.\\n\\nTarget Audience - Price conscious customers who still want to access to cool skins. More likely to get bored and likes change.\\n\\n**Pros**\\n\\n* Completely different revenue stream and audience to monetize from\\n* It's a try before you buy program - can get people to convert to buying the real thing if they really enjoy that skin\\n\\n**Cons**\\n\\n* Can be seen as a product that cannibalises existing and more lucrative revenue streams\\n\\n**Potential Price - 1500VP (\\\\~15USD)**\\n\\n### Pay to play better systems\\n\\n**Description** -\\n\\nSimilar to DotaPlus, LeapFrog or some of the pre-mature analytics services out there for Valorant, these systems will augment the stats and datapoints that Valorant records to give players a better understanding of how to get better. *I can make a more detailed post about this if there's interest.* But because of the lack of public APIs, there is a unique value proposition for a service that Valorant provides vs one that is third party.\\n\\n**Target Audience** -\\n\\nPlayers who like getting better. This is less about what skill level they are (although there will be a correlation with people who will want these services and people who are in plat / diamond is my hypothesis) I think this again can be based on their tendency to solo que.\\n\\n**Pros**\\n\\n* Again, a completely different revenue stream that Valorant can capitalise on.\\n* This can be a great retention feature, as it gives intent on people who want to get better\\n* Creates a way for UGC to be showcased and create an avenue to outsource acquisition & retention efforts.\\n\\n**Cons**\\n\\n* Can be seen as a pay to win feature for Valorant.\\n\\n**Potential Price - 500 VP (\\\\~$5 USD)**\\n\\n### Professional Analytics & Analysis Capability\\n\\n**Description -**\\n\\nAs Valorant becomes more competitive, professional teams will look for an edge using analytics (prime examples being [basketball](https://notboring.substack.com/p/trust-the-process), & [baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film))). In the same vein, there is a lot of untapped data that professionals can take advantage of to improve gameplay. Examples including:\\n\\n* Where do professionals lose duels (one on one fights) & what variables are highly correlated (verticality, distance, gun usage, what stage of the round)\\n* How do the handle certain situations (retaking a site vs attacking a site), and how do they compare vs other professional teams\\n* What rounds are they expected to win (and lose) and vice versa\\n\\nAs professional teams start hiring data-centric analysts, it is safe to assume a new set of capabilities are necessary to empower their day to day activities.\\n\\n**Target Audience** -\\n\\nProfessional organizations who are competing in tier 1 competitions.\\n\\n**Potential Price - $4000 a month (1 person's monthly salary)**\\n\\n### Creating new game types\\n\\n**Description -**\\n\\nThis looks to the meteoritic rise of AutoChess as inspiration, and looks to transforms Valorant from a game into an universe. If you look at one of the overwhelming trends of online games, it can be seen as the new local playground, where people and friends just wanna hang out. This revenue strategy looks to capitalize on this, and create avenues for people to hang out and have casual fun that doesn't just focus on 5 on 5 gameplay.\\n\\n**Examples**\\n\\n* Capture the Flag\\n* BunnyHopping Challenges (but for certain heroes)\\n* FallGuys like obstacle challenges\\n\\n**Target Audience** -\\n\\nCasual gamers who want to find a game to chill out and play with friends.\\n\\n**Pros**\\n\\n* Completely different base to acquire potential players from. Ability to convert them into playing the core game can also be very high dependent on the new game types\\n\\n**Cons**\\n\\n* Obviously very different in terms of roadmap, and will need a huge initial investment of resources to get up and running.\\n\\n**Potential Price - Free or Paid depending on game type.**\",\"timestamp\":1639902064,\"title\":\"Valorant Monetisation Strategy\"},\"digest\":\"EXSdOmeDNMpFu03hNCquiRYOxuV6oDC1eFsnbba1asY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x37f9d93881F7B4c7c566d62D45F0a156bdb2e2c8\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0YbJC4f41EVP5oDdSoEM9weEdMCp7-STMx37fP6ieZw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"r38u-rR6I80eUO5MGRRiaEmp6JO_XTEpqz00pXgzytw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"gaxUuu9_Azze-pJFQmBnR6u-bL6RXBld369b6RIgg0NmQo68casZ-szzM2JWaZyjtzjKAqKqw-_LtYZiCIV7kA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x49a7b73d0b9c2378ef2bfd557a5226c3ffe3dd7f097339510f25212170f02ece31aac35d9af90f2cfea6ef6793143f3154aea8c21b7f8ccc911d2491d94abd031c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0YbJC4f41EVP5oDdSoEM9weEdMCp7-STMx37fP6ieZw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"r38u-rR6I80eUO5MGRRiaEmp6JO_XTEpqz00pXgzytw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"EXSdOmeDNMpFu03hNCquiRYOxuV6oDC1eFsnbba1asY\"}"
