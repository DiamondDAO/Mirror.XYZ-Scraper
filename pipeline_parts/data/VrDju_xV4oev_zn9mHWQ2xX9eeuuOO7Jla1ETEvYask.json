"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Web3.0 is just a concept word created by people in the industry. The most common explanation is that the information in the website can directly interact with other website-related information, and can integrate and use the information of multiple websites at the same time through a third-party information platform; Users have their own data on the Internet and can use them on different websites; it is completely web-based, and the system functions that can only be realized by complex system programs can be realized with a browser; user data is audited and synchronized with network data.\\n\\nMany people say when someone mentions web2.0, there will be web3.0. But they don't know what web3.0 is, when it will be implemented, how it will be implemented, and what are the characteristics of web3.0. Let me briefly explain my understanding of 3.0. If the essence of web1.0 is an alliance, then the essence of web2.0 is interaction. It allows netizens to participate more in the creation, dissemination, and sharing of information products, and this process Is valuable. The disadvantage of web2.0 is that it does not reflect the value of netizens' labor, so 2.0 is very fragile and lacks commercial value. Web2.0 is fragile, and pure 2.0 will encounter major challenges in business models, and it needs to be combined with specific industries to obtain great commercial value and commercial success. Web3.0 is an Internet method developed on the basis of web2.0 that can better reflect the labor value of netizens and achieve a balanced distribution of value.\\n\\nIn general, web3.0 is more than just technological innovation. Instead, it uses a unified communication protocol to provide users with more personalized customization of Internet information through a more concise way of technical integration. It will be a key step in the development of the Internet from technological innovation to user concept innovation.\\n\\nAlthough web2.0 is only a transitional product of the development stage of the Internet, it is precise because of the emergence of 2.0 that people can participate more in the creation of the Internet, especially in the creation of content. At this point, web2.0 Is revolutionary. People will get more honor and recognition, including wealth and status in this creative labor. It is precisely because more people have participated invaluable creative labor that \\\"requiring the redistribution of Internet value\\\" will be an inevitable trend, which will inevitably lead to the emergence of a new generation of the Internet, which is web3.0.\\n\\nThe technology of the Internet is changing with each passing day, and the Internet continues to penetrate into people's lives. Web3.0 will be a form of the Internet that will completely change people's lives. Web3.0 enables all online citizens to no longer be restricted by the accumulation of existing resources, and have a more equal opportunity to obtain wealth and reputation. Where will web3.0 start? In fact, there is already web3.0, but it hasn't got enough understanding yet. That is the field of e-commerce and online games. Whether it is B2C or C2C, netizens use the platform provided by the Internet to conduct transactions. In this process, they work through the Internet and gain wealth. Online games use points. Role players can gain reputation and wealth through looting the city, constantly practicing, and spending a lot of time there, and this wealth can be exchanged in reality in a certain way, just like the so-called life. Like a game, the Internet will make people’s lives more like games. Current forums also provide points, but due to lack of personality, this will not become mainstream in the future. The most representative blog has done very little in points, and labor value is not reflected. Because of this, a good blogger will start anew. In order to get more, this is pursuing a more balanced distribution method. When the 2.0 participants have enough power and chips, they will demand a fairer and more reasonable distribution method for them. When the blogger's personal strength is not enough, he can fight for his own interests through joint means.\\n\\nThree prerequisites for the arrival of web3.0: 1. The blogging technology is represented by the improvement and development of Internet application technology centered on the interaction and individual experience of netizens. 2. The popularity and prevalence of virtual currency and the exchange of virtual currency have become a reality. 3. Everyone's recognition of online wealth and solutions for online financial security. Like web2.0, web3.0 is still not a technological innovation, but an ideological innovation, which in turn guides the development and application of technology. After web3.0, a new kingdom will be born. This kingdom is no longer divided by regions and boundaries, but a kingdom gathered and managed by interests, languages, themes, occupations, and professions. At that time, it can be said that \\\"the emperor will take turns to do it and come to my house next year.\\\" You have the opportunity to create a new Internet kingdom and become a king. You may also become president in the democratic election of the Internet kingdom. At that time, you will have Cyber ​​citizens in every corner of the earth.\\n\\nIn fact, when it comes to this, many people should have seen that there is no such thing as 2.0 or 3.0, because you can’t define exactly what kind of application it is, nor can you define when it starts and when it ends. It is just a trend in the development of the Internet itself.\\n\\nThe 3.0 I want to say is the framework of future Internet applications that I can currently imagine. a. The information in the website can be directly interacted with and updated with other website information, and the information on multiple websites can be integrated and used at the same time through a third-party information platform; b. Users have their own data on the Internet and can use it on different websites; c. It is completely web-based, and the functions that are only available in complex system programs can be realized with a browser It can be said that Web3.0 is three-wide + three-cross (wide-area, wide-ranging, wide-ranging, cross-regional, cross-language, and cross-industry) In reality, every industry is developing in continuous subdivision and improvement. For example, the construction industry and the financial industry have been clearly divided and are still being refined. This is established in the development process of hundreds of thousands of years. Got up. The Internet has only developed in just a dozen years. For a field that can cover almost all traditional industries, the current level of Internet application segmentation is far from enough. As stated in software engineering, the standards and specifications of software development are still very simple, and the degree of reuse of development methods and modules is far from enough. The same is true for the Internet. The segmentation, completeness, and reuse of various applications are far from enough. So I think that the future development direction of Internet applications must be towards more segmented, more professional, and more compatible. Content management will have professional content management providers, comments will have professional comments service providers; plug-ins will have similar RSS uniform standards, but also appear as Feedburner, google reader widget subscriptions, and hosting platform such platforms. The blog will evolve into a personal center. All content in the personal center has only one domain name and one page, and all the remaining services are provided by professional service providers. Users only need to add the applications they need to their pages in the form of widgets. You can enjoy a variety of comprehensive services. But it will not be a centralized personal homepage like google ig and Netvibes, because they have no personalities and are not flexible enough. It will not be a blog platform like Sohu, because various services are not provided by one company. BSP may return to the most original personal homepage service, providing a second-level domain name and a static space. Then the main question is: Who provides the account number? OpenID will definitely become the backbone of web3.0, organically linking various platforms. No matter where you go, you always use the same account, and the content is linked everywhere. The id service itself needs to be linked to credit. This is a bridge that must be established between virtual and reality. Credit services in the existing community are established by certain technical means, which are very laborious and cannot communicate with people in reality. To establish a complete and effective relationship with credit, it is not difficult for us to think that it is the bank that directly controls the most reliable credit. Therefore, in the future, the provision of OpenID or Internet identity services will be a service established by the bank, and it is likely to become a certain business of the bank. Under this model, Internet services have been the same as the traditional service industry, providing professional services and charging fees, and the profit model of the Internet will also change accordingly.\",\"timestamp\":1640274695,\"title\":\"web3.0\"},\"digest\":\"AVH4QUDqNm6_Bs-ycUNWryqFH3BlhFYZ5yiRmrP6X2M\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x96bAd0e62A0a98dE7a434A4da51F14f727b53e59\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-PTNtmRm94cWlYmsoYUCPhoSHcmcDn5YLAs5ibRl7pI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DBSc5K3DGZ15rH6ZHE9edUamcEyiJDc9CIVAjIYwAbM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"oQ5VTpDyYhRNjzvv9rpSim2kgOjDABDrizL9dEW7Svv1Xe5KtyrxzOjFrbdH1ivBKCOTv2Er0hltofwkW51lYg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0f8a1cffbe31bd203601668be8f3426bfccba47b3228c647fb434c6a2ccd3b9a3e555ca4d4dc34851ff8ffa9f0256fb7fa9e3c09ab4d5ce42aafce0a402941821c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-PTNtmRm94cWlYmsoYUCPhoSHcmcDn5YLAs5ibRl7pI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DBSc5K3DGZ15rH6ZHE9edUamcEyiJDc9CIVAjIYwAbM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"AVH4QUDqNm6_Bs-ycUNWryqFH3BlhFYZ5yiRmrP6X2M\"}"
