"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"As Justin Drake said in the must-read trilogy published on Bankless, economic security can be quantified, but it is more difficult than it seems at first glance. We can define economic security as the cost of attacking the network. As far as the workload proof network is concerned, economic security is the cost required to obtain 51% of the computing power. These computing power can be obtained by renting and acquiring ASICs. We can estimate the cost of the attack based on the price of the leased computing power and multiplying it by 51% of the computing power. Although this is only a hypothetical estimate, according to crypto51.app data, Ethereum currently ranks first in economic security, Bitcoin is second, and other networks are far behind. Of course, it is impractical to obtain 51% of the computing power, and the actual cost is difficult to calculate. As far as the proof of rights is concerned, due to the many differences between the consensus mechanisms, the calculation will be very complicated.\",\"timestamp\":1634225905,\"title\":\"The economic security of tokens\"},\"digest\":\"STJSu63s-7Tzah6_AU4P0m-JolFFQoGNSmN35F-Nfjk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xbbC0be95C26bdf7218012eF929EF529E362FfE91\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"31o9pAhu1r0HMpLnS17z-fkv-2kRtsgvWIKe4EWzQpk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KdcfLGecBGQyuciwADxuyvgIEOnmUD4OaCWs222GDrQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"FYBD2rrTa50wTONMrBc6nPVbReG4oKSwoy5EaH_3oLDejn2O3GRvBxKeFoWRwnpH7ib1UyPILrKoX6fOUKdBNA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xec29ffcfa40570f63933f616020ee00d775e636f836b8de16998d7ffdcbee6ec383a6afe85812ef36adb289654780338846a434a15cad86d2cb7a32c44abfcf11b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"31o9pAhu1r0HMpLnS17z-fkv-2kRtsgvWIKe4EWzQpk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KdcfLGecBGQyuciwADxuyvgIEOnmUD4OaCWs222GDrQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"STJSu63s-7Tzah6_AU4P0m-JolFFQoGNSmN35F-Nfjk\"}"
