"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"As 2021 comes to a close, I wanted to share my experience joining a crypto start-up âœ¨\\n\\n**January 2021:** I receive an email from my now boss, Demo Skalkotos, who I met during his time at Ledger to apply to work for his sales team. I interview and Blockdaemon feels like a perfect match.\\n\\n**March 2021:** I join Blockdaemon's \\\\~30-person team as the first sales hire under Demo. At the time, Blockdaemon had raised $5.5M since inception in 2017 through multiple seed and venture rounds. I get to know the OG team, new teammates, and immerse myself in learning Blockdaemon's value to the crypto industry. On the **personal side** - I almost place an offer an a house in Dallas during a brutal seller's market. I have a change of heart and decide to to leave Texas after 7 years and move to LA.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2169qQpEzzWPeM2KgqViu.jpeg?height=935&width=1524)\\n\\n**June 2021:** Blockdaemon announces its $28 million Series A. I attend my first in-person crypto conference for Bitcoin Miami and meet many familiar faces from Zoom in-person. Over the next few months, more and more talented & passionate people join our weekly team call. I buy a ton of $SOL and $ETH.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ls--nhJ6-kIjAO6uFgJ-z.jpeg?height=687&width=916)\\n\\n**September 2021:** While attending the Messari Mainnet conference with my team in NYC, Blockdaemon announces its $155M Series B. I walk through Times Square and see our logo flashing on the big screens as I head to Blockdaemon's reception to meet with clients. It hits me again that I am part of growing a special team and still feel that wave of gratitude every day.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XgYAaLeZxWJnI9HmZVNnz.jpeg?height=793&width=1170)\\n\\n**November 2021:** I travel to Lisbon for Breakpoint Solana. Quickly I realize how many good friends I have made in the crypto space from different companies where we have one important thing in common: **we love crypto and we want to change the world**. I find myself incapable of starting the day without tweeting \\\"GM\\\" and end every conversation with \\\"WAGMI.\\\" I also buy more $SOL ðŸ˜…\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GH3bT4BKZ-ZiMxK9cSiP0.jpeg?height=1149&width=1728)\\n\\nUpon return to the US, I learn Blockdaemon has secured an office space in Venice where a large number of Daemons reside from several different teams. Sales and product convene to break the new HQ in and I feel extremely lucky for my change of heart back in March to move west.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oUUaYJd6ModUVw_vyLI-R.jpeg?height=1389&width=1986)\\n\\n**December 2021:** Blockdaemon's team has grown to **nearly 180 people.** The entire team is invited to attend the first ever company off-site in Miami. I meet excited, talented, kind, and smart people from all over the US, Europe, and Asia. We gather in beautiful South Beach to learn from each core team what we are building for the crypto industry and our mission to **enable any company to be a crypto company**. Our marketing team showers us with the ultimate swag, including a surprise gift of custom Air Pod Pros left in our rooms while we attend a reception on the final night.\\n\\n \\n It has been an incredible 9 months and every Daemon is more excited by the day to grow and build out Blockdaemon's products and services to help our existing and future clients. Coming from big tech, it's an unbelievable change to feel the collective genuine desire to help this company grow and succeed.\\n\\nHope everyone had a healthy, safe, and happy 2021 and is as excited as I am for what is to come in 2022! ðŸš€\",\"timestamp\":1640803160,\"title\":\"2021 in-review: joining a crypto start-up\"},\"digest\":\"SG8P_jhwA1lAkRxeziK-f_xawV92M4pSjCh5Phw2QIg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x922b65F0CfB2525ABDe2dfE8f5E488EB6e54893F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fe4BTpM_PPcVz4HDQWPKV-yVVpqu2uqru25mnQb9olk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"prrpi3RBfdTws1IWypU3P_7JBPZcVhQdLzPj69v3Ais\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"pZXHit-6sa2HCq1Znv24y4EoDtJg3xmr5wvZWCgAhmdf3LCtB7LEdKJTgY4vvZR82CFCCYQnHALEnats7Z5Bwg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xffd2f4020aba9bbfecc06b63c618c61c6d5ebd1acda5a2bee37c5437d7f7a7b911d8776b63fc274eef8849f283341b3c78a356ef26e19315403b9e7a8bc6e8c11c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fe4BTpM_PPcVz4HDQWPKV-yVVpqu2uqru25mnQb9olk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"prrpi3RBfdTws1IWypU3P_7JBPZcVhQdLzPj69v3Ais\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"SG8P_jhwA1lAkRxeziK-f_xawV92M4pSjCh5Phw2QIg\"}"
