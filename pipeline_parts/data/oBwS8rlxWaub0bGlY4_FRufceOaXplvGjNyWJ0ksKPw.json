"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Amid all the noise and confusion of the last few minutes, Rose had stood ever in the same attitude, with that strangely fixed expression never altering on her face but once. When her husband made his way to the side of the table and stood there prominently alone, her lips trembled a little, and a faint shade of color passed swiftly over her cheeks. Even that slight change had vanished now--she was paler, stiller, more widely altered from her former self than ever, as she faced the president and said these words:\\n\\n\\\"I wish to follow my brother's example and make my confession, as he has made his. I would rather he had spoken for me; but he is too generous to say any words except such as he thinks may save me from sharing his punishment. I refuse to be saved, unless he is saved with me. Where he goes when he leaves this place, I will go; what he suffers, I will suffer; if he is to die, I believe God will grant me the strength to die resignedly with him!\\\"\\n\\nShe paused for a moment, and half turned toward Trudaine--then checked herself instantly and went on: \\\"This is what I now wish to say, as to my share in the offense charged against my brother. Some time ago, he told me one day that he had seen my husband's mother in Paris, disguised as a poor woman; that he had spoken to her, and forced her to acknowledge herself. Up to this time we had all felt certain that she had left France, because she held old-fashioned opinions which it is dangerous for people to hold now--had left France before we came to Paris. She told my brother that she had indeed gone (with an old, tried servant of the family to help and protect her) as far as Marseilles; and that, finding unforeseen difficulty there in getting further, she had taken it as a warning from Providence not to desert her son, of whom she was very passionately fond, and from whom she had been most unwilling to depart. Instead of waiting in exile for quieter times, she determined to go and hide herself in Paris, knowing her son was going there too. She assumed the name of her old and faithful servant, who declined to the last to leave her unprotected; and she proposed to live in the strictest secrecy and retirement, watching, unknown, the career of her son, and ready at a moment's notice to disclose herself to him, when the settlement of pubic affairs might reunite her safely to her beloved child. My brother thought this plan full of danger, both for herself, for her son, and for the honest old man who was risking his head for his mistress's sake. I thought so too; and in an evil hour I said to Louis: 'Will you try in secret to get my husband's mother away, and see that her faithful servant makes her really leave France this time?' I wrongly asked my brother to do this for a selfish reason of my own--a reason connected with my married life, which has not been a happy one. I had not succeeded in gaining my husband's affection, and was not treated kindly by him. My brother--who has always loved me far more dearly, I am afraid, than I have ever deserved--my brother increased his kindness to me, seeing me treated unkindly by my husband. This made ill-blood between them. My thought, when I asked my brother to do for me what I have said, was, that if we two in secret saved my husband's mother, without danger to him, from imperiling herself and her son, we should, when the time came for speaking of what we ha d done, appear to my husband in a new and better light. I should have shown how well I deserved his love, and Louis would have shown how well he deserved his brother-in-law's gratitude; and so we should have made home happy at last, and all three have lived together affectionately. This was my thought; and when I told it to my brother, and asked him if there would be much risk, out of his kindness and indulgence toward me, he said 'No.' He had so used me to accept sacrifices for my happiness that I let him endanger himself to help me in my little household plan. I repent this bitterly now; I ask his pardon with my whole heart. If he is acquitted, I will try to show myself worthier of his love. If he is found guilty, I, too, will go to the scaffold, and die with my brother, who risked his life for my sake.\\\"\\n\\nShe ceased as quietly as she had begun, and turned once more to her brother.\\n\\nAs she looked away from the court and looked at him, a few tears came into her eyes, and something of the old softness of form and gentleness of expression seemed to return to her face. He let her take his hand, but he seemed purposely to avoid meeting the anxious gaze she fixed on him. His head sunk on his breast; he drew his breath heavily, his countenance darkened and grew distorted, as if he were suffering some sharp pang of physical pain. He bent down a little, and, leaning his elbow on the rail before him, covered his face with his hand; and so quelled the rising agony, so forced back the scalding tears to his heart. The audience had heard Rose in silence, and they preserved the same tranquillity when she had done. This was a rare tribute to a prisoner from the people of the Reign of Terror.\\n\\nThe president looked round at his colleagues, and shook his head suspiciously.\\n\\n\\\"This statement of the female prisoner's complicates the matter very seriously,\\\" said he. \\\"Is there anybody in court,\\\" he added, looking at the persons behind his chair, \\\"who knows where the mother of Superintendent Danville and the servant are now?\\\"\\n\\nLomaque came forward at the appeal, and placed himself by the table.\\n\\n\\\"Why, citizen agent!\\\" continued the president, looking hard at him, \\\"are you overcome by the heat, too?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The fit seemed to take him, citizen president, when the female prisoner had made an end of her statement,\\\" exclaimed Magloire, pressing forward officiously.\\n\\nLomaque gave his subordinate a look which sent the man back directly to the shelter of the official group; then said, in lower tones than were customary with him:\\n\\n\\\"I have received information relative to the mother of Superintendent Danville and the servant, and am ready to answer any questions that may be put to me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where are they now?\\\" asked the president.\\n\\n\\\"She and the servant are known to have crossed the frontier, and are supposed to be on their way to Cologne. But, since they have entered Germany, their whereabouts is necessarily a matter of uncertainty to the republican authorities.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have you any information relative to the conduct of the old servant while he was in Paris?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have information enough to prove that he was not an object for political suspicion. He seems to have been simply animated by servile zeal for the woman's interests; to have performed for her all the menial offices of a servant in private; and to have misled the neighbors by affected equality with her in public.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have you any reason to believe that Superintendent Danville was privy to his mother's first attempt at escaping from France?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I infer it from what the female prisoner has said, and for other reasons which it would be irregular to detail before the tribunal. The proofs can no doubt be obtained if I am allowed time to communicate with the authorities at Lyons and Marseilles.\\\"\\n\\nAt this moment Danville re-entered the court; and, advancing to the table, placed himself close by the chief agent's side. They looked each other steadily in the face for an instant.\\n\\n\\\"He has recovered from the shock of Trudaine's answer,\\\" thought Lomaque, retiring. \\\"His hand trembles, his face is pale, but I can see regained self-possession in his eye, and I dread the consequences already.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Citizen president,\\\" began Danville, \\\"I demand to know if anything has transpired affecting my honor and patriotism in my absence?\\\"\\n\\nHe spoke apparently with the most perfect calmness, but he looked nobody in the face. His eyes were fixed steadily on the green baize of the table beneath him.\\n\\n\\\"The female prisoner has made a statement, referring principally to herself and her brother,\\\" answered the president, \\\"but incidentally mentioning a previous attempt on your mother's part to break existing laws by emigrating from France. This portion of the confession contains in it some elements of suspicion which seriously affect you--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They shall be suspicions no longer--at my own peril I will change them to certainties!\\\" exclaimed Danville, extending his arm theatrically, and looking up for the first time. \\\"Citizen president, I avow it with the fearless frankness of a good patriot; I was privy to my mother's first attempt at escaping from France.\\\"\\n\\nHisses and cries of execration followed this confession. He winced under them at first; but recovered his self-possession before silence was restored.\\n\\n\\\"Citizens, you have heard the confession of my fault,\\\" he resumed, turning with desperate assurance toward the audience; \\\"now hear the atonement I have made for it at the altar of my country.\\\"\\n\\nHe waited at the end of that sentence, until the secretary to the tribunal had done writing it down in the report book of the court.\\n\\n\\\"Transcribe faithfully to the letter!\\\" cried Danville, pointing solemnly to the open page of the volume. \\\"Life and death hang on my words.\\\"\\n\\nThe secretary took a fresh dip of ink, and nodded to show that he was ready. Danville went on:\\n\\n\\\"In these times of glory and trial for France,\\\" he proceeded, pitching his voice to a tone of deep emotion, \\\"what are all good citizens most sacredly bound to do? To immolate their dearest private affections and interests before their public duties! On the first attempt of my mother to violate the laws against emigration, by escaping from France, I failed in making the heroic sacrifice which inexorable patriotism demanded of me. My situation was more terrible than the situation of Brutus sitting in judgment on his own sons. I had not the Roman fortitude to rise equal to it. I erred, citizens--erred as Coriolanus did, when his august mother pleaded with him for the safety of Rome! For that error I deserved to he purged out of the republican community; but I escaped my merited punishment--nay, I even rose to the honor of holding an office under the Government. Time passed; and again my mother attempted an escape from France. Again, inevitable fate brought my civic virtue to the test. How did I meet this second supremest trial? By an atonement for past weakness, terrible as the trial itself. Citizens, you will shudder; but you will applaud while you tremble. Citizens, look! and while you look, remember well the evidence given at the opening of this case. Yonder stands the enemy of his country, who intrigued to help my mother to escape; here stands the patriot son, whose voice was the first, the only voice, to denounce him for the crime!\\\" As he spoke, he pointed to Trudaine, then struck himself on the breast, then folded his arms, and looked sternly at the benches occupied by the spectators.\\n\\n\\\"Do you assert,\\\" exclaimed the president, \\\"that at the time when you denounced Trudaine, you knew him to be intriguing to aid your mother's escape?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I assert it,\\\" answered Danville.\\n\\nThe pen which the president held dropped from his hand at that reply; his colleagues started, and looked at each other in blank silence.\\n\\nA murmur of \\\"Monster! monster!\\\" began with the prisoners on the platform, and spread instantly to the audience, who echoed and echoed it again; the fiercest woman-republican on the benches joined cause at last with the haughtiest woman-aristocrat on the platform. Even in that sphere of direst discords, in that age of sharpest enmities, the one touch of Nature preserved its old eternal  virtue, and roused the mo ther-instinct which makes the whole world kin.\\n\\nOf the few persons in the court who at once foresaw the effect of Danville's answer on the proceedings of the tribunal, Lomaque was one. His sallow face whitened as he looked toward the prisoners' platform.\\n\\n\\\"They are lost,\\\" he murmured to himself, moving out of the group in which he had hitherto stood. \\\"Lost! The lie which has saved that villain's head leaves them without the shadow of a hope. No need to stop for the sentence--Danville's infamous presence of mind has given them up to the guillotine!\\\" Pronouncing these words, he went out hurriedly by a door near the platform, which led to the prisoners' waiting-room.\\n\\nRose's head sank again on her brother's shoulder. She shuddered, and leaned back faintly on the arm which he extended to support her. One of the female prisoners tried to help Trudaine in speaking consolingly to her; but the consummation of her husband's perfidy seemed to have paralyzed her at heart. She murmured once in her brother's ear, \\\"Louis! I am resigned to die--nothing but death is left for me after the degradation of having loved that man.\\\" She said those words and closed her eyes wearily, and spoke no more.\\n\\n\\\"One other question, and you may retire,\\\" resumed the president, addressing Danville. \\\"Were you cognizant of your wife's connection with her brother's conspiracy?\\\"\\n\\nDanville reflected for a moment, remembered that there were witnesses in court who could speak to his language and behavior on the evening of his wife's arrest, and resolved this time to tell the truth.\\n\\n\\\"I was not aware of it,\\\" he answered. \\\"Testimony in my favor can be called which will prove that when my wife's complicity was discovered I was absent from Paris.\\\"\\n\\nHeartlessly self-possessed as he was, the public reception of his last reply had shaken his nerve. He now spoke in low tones, turning his back on the spectators, and fixing his eyes again on the green baize of the table at which he stood.\\n\\n\\\"Prisoners, have you any objection to make, any evidence to call, invalidating the statement by which Citizen Danville has cleared himself of suspicion?\\\" inquired the president.\\n\\n\\\"He has cleared himself by the most execrable of all falsehoods,\\\" answered Trudaine. \\\"If his mother could be traced and brought here, her testimony would prove it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Can you produce any other evidence in support of your allegation?\\\" asked the president\\n\\n\\\"I cannot.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Citizen Superintendent Danville, you are at liberty to retire. Your statement will be laid before the authority to whom you are officially responsible. Either you merit a civic crown for more than Roman virtue, or--\\\" Having got thus far, the president stopped abruptly, as if unwilling to commit himself too soon to an opinion, and merely repeated, \\\"You may retire.\\\"\\n\\nDanville left the court immediately, going out again by the public door. He was followed by murmurs from the women's benches, which soon ceased, however, when the president was observed to close his note-book, and turn round toward his colleagues. \\\"The sentence!\\\" was the general whisper now. \\\"Hush, hush--the sentence!\\\"\\n\\nAfter a consultation of a few minutes with the persons behind him, the president rose, and spoke the momentous words:\\n\\n\\\"Louis Trudaine and Rose Danville, the revolutionary tribunal, having heard the charge against you, and having weighed the value of what you have said in answer to it, decides that you are both guilty, and condemns you to the penalty of death.\\\"\\n\\nHaving delivered the sentence in those terms, he sat down again, and placed a mark against the two first condemned names on the list of prisoners. Immediately afterward the next case was called on, and the curiosity of the audience was stimulated by a new trial.\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\nTHE waiting-room of the revolutionary tribunal was a grim, bare place, with a dirty stone floor, and benches running round the walls. The windows  were high and barred; and at the outer door, leading into the street, two sentinels kept watch. On entering this comfortless retreat from the court, Lomaque found it perfectly empty. Solitude was just then welcome to him. He remained in the waiting-room, walking slowly from end to end over the filthy pavement, talking eagerly and incessantly to himself.\\n\\nAfter a while, the door communicating with the tribunal opened, and the humpbacked jailer made his appearance, leading in Trudaine and Rose.\\n\\n\\\"You will have to wait here,\\\" said the little man, \\\"till the rest of them have been tried and sentenced; and then you will all go back to prison in a lump. Ha, citizen,\\\" he continued, observing Lomaque at the other end of the hall, and bustling up to him. \\\"Here still, eh? If you were going to stop much longer, I should ask a favor of you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am in no hurry,\\\" said Lomaque, with a glance at the two prisoners.\\n\\n\\\"Good!\\\" cried the humpback, drawing his hand across his mouth; \\\"I am parched with thirst, and dying to moisten my throat at the wine-shop over the way. Just mind that man and woman while I'm gone, will you? It's the merest form--there's a guard outside, the windows are barred, the tribunal is within hail. Do you mind obliging me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"On the contrary, I am glad of the opportunity.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's a good fellow--and, remember, if I am asked for, you must say I was obliged to quit the court for a few minutes, and left you in charge.\\\"\\n\\nWith these words, the humpbacked jailer ran off to the wineshop.\\n\\nHe had scarcely disappeared before Trudaine crossed the room, and caught Lomaque by the arm.\\n\\n\\\"Save her,\\\" he whispered; \\\"there is an opportunity--save her!\\\" His face was flushed--his eyes wandered--his breath on the chief agent's cheek, while he spoke, felt scorching hot. \\\"Save her!\\\" he repeated, shaking Lomaque by the arm, and dragging him toward the door. \\\"Remember all you owe to my father--remember our talk on that bench by the river--remember what you said to me yourself on the night of the arrest--don't wait to think--save her, and leave me without a word! If I die alone, I can die as a man should; if she goes to the scaffold by my side, my heart will fail me--I shall die the death of a coward! I have lived for her life--let me die for it, and I die happy!\\\"\\n\\nHe tried to say more, but the violence of his agitation forbade it. He could only shake the arm he held again and again, and point to the bench on which Rose sat--her head sunk on her bosom, her hands crossed listlessly on her lap.\\n\\n\\\"There are two armed sentinels outside--the windows are barred--you are without weapons--and even if you had them, there is a guard-house within hail on one side of you, and the tribunal on the other. Escape from this room is impossible,\\\" answered Lomaque.\\n\\n\\\"Impossible!\\\" repeated the other, furiously. \\\"You traitor! you coward! can you look at her sitting there helpless, her very life ebbing away already with every minute that passes, and tell me coolly that escape is impossible?\\\"\\n\\nIn the frenzy of his grief and despair, he lifted his disengaged hand threateningly while he spoke. Lomaque caught him by the wrist, and drew him toward a window open at the top.\\n\\n\\\"You are not in your right senses,\\\" said the chief agent, firmly; \\\"anxiety and apprehension on your sister's account have shaken your mind. Try to compose yourself, and listen to me. I have something important to say--\\\" (Trudaine looked at him incredulously.) \\\"Important,\\\" continued Lomaque, \\\"as affecting your sister's interests at this terrible crisis.\\\"\\n\\nThat last appeal had an instantaneous effect. Trudaine's outstretched hand dropped to his side, and a sudden change passed over his expression.\\n\\n\\\"Give me a moment,\\\" he said, faintly; and turning away, leaned against the wall and pressed his burning forehead on the chill, damp stone. He did not raise his head again till he had mastered himself, and could say quietly, \\\"Speak; I am fit to hear you, and sufficiently in my senses to ask your forgiveness for what I said just now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"When I left the tribunal and entered this room,\\\" Lomaque began in a whisper, \\\"there was no thought in my mind that could be turned to good account, either for your sister or for you. I was fit for nothing but to deplore the failure of the confession which I came to St. L azare to suggest to you as your best plan of defense. Since then, an idea has struck me, which may be useful--an idea so desperate, so uncertain--involving a proposal so absolutely dependent, as to its successful execution, on the merest chance, that I refuse to confide it to you except on one condition.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mention the condition! I submit to it before hand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Give me your word of honor that you will not mention what I am about to say to your sister until I grant you permission to speak. Promise me that when you see her shrinking before the terrors of death to-night, you will have self-restraint enough to abstain from breathing a word of hope to her. I ask this, because there are ten--twenty--fifty chances to one that there *is* no hope.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have no choice but to promise,\\\" answered Trudaine.\\n\\nLomaque produced his pocket-book and pencil before he spoke again.\\n\\n\\\"I will enter into particulars as soon as I have asked a strange question of you,\\\" he said. \\\"You have been a great experimenter in chemistry in your time--is your mind calm enough, at such a trying moment as this, to answer a question which is connected with chemistry in a very humble way? You seem astonished. Let me put the question at once. Is there any liquid or powder, or combination of more than one ingredient known, which will remove writing from paper, and leave no stain behind?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certainly! But is that all the question? Is there no greater difficulty?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"None. Write the prescription, whatever it may be, on that leaf,\\\" said the other, giving him the pocket-book. \\\"Write it down, with plain directions for use.\\\" Trudaine obeyed. \\\"This is the first step,\\\" continued Lomaque, putting the book in his pocket, \\\"toward the accomplishment of my purpose--my uncertain purpose, remember! Now, listen; I am going to put my own head in danger for the chance of saving yours and your sister's by tampering with the death-list. Don't interrupt me! If I can save one, I can save the other. Not a word about gratitude! Wait till you know the extent of your obligation. I tell you plainly, at the outset, there is a motive of despair, as well as a motive of pity, at the bottom of the action in which I am now about to engage. Silence! I insist on it. Our time is short; it is for me to speak, and for you to listen. The president of the tribunal has put the deathmark against your names on the prison list of today. That list, when the trials are over and it is marked to the end, will be called in this room before you are taken to St. Lazare. It will then be sent to Robespierre, who will keep it, having a copy made of it the moment it is delivered, for circulation among his colleagues--St. Just, and the rest. It is my business to make a duplicate of this copy in the first instance. The duplicate will be compared with the original, and possibly with the copy, too, either by Robespierre himself, or by some one in whom he can place implicit trust, and will then be sent to St. Lazare without passing through my hands again. It will be read in public the moment it is received, at the grating of the prison, and will afterward be kept by the jailer, who will refer to it, as he goes round in the evening with a piece of chalk, to mark the cell doors of the prisoners destined for the guillotine to-morrow. That duty happens, to-day, to fall to the hunchback whom you saw speaking to me. He is a confirmed drinker, and I mean to tempt him with such wine as he rarely tastes. If--after the reading of the list in public, and before the marking of the cell doors--I can get him to sit down to the bottle, I will answer for making him drunk, for getting the list out of his pocket, and for wiping your names out of it with the prescription you have just written for me. I shall write all the names, one under another, just irregularly enough in my duplicate to prevent the interval left by the erasure from being easily observed. If I succeed in this, your door will not be marked, and your names will not be called tomorrow morning when the tumbrils come for the guillotine. In the present confusion of prisoners pouring in every day for trial, and prisoners pouring out every day for execution, you will have the best possible chance of security against awkward inquiries, if you play your cards properly, for a good fortnight or ten days at least. In that time--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well! well!\\\" cried Trudaine, eagerly.\\n\\nLomaque looked toward the tribunal door, and lowered his voice to a fainter whisper before he continued, \\\"In that time Robespierre's own head may fall into the sack! France is beginning to sicken under the Reign of Terror. Frenchmen of the Moderate faction, who have lain hidden for months in cellars and lofts, are beginning to steal out and deliberate by twos and threes together, under cover of the night. Robespierre has not ventured for weeks past to face the Convention Committee. He only speaks among his own friends at the Jacobins. There are rumors of a terrible discovery made by Carnot, of a desperate resolution taken by Tallien. Men watching behind the scenes see that the last days of the Terror are at hand. If Robespierre is beaten in the approaching struggle, you are saved--for the new reign must be a Reign of Mercy. If he conquers, I have only put off the date of your death and your sister's, and have laid my own neck under the axe. Those are your chances--this is all I can do.\\\"\\n\\nHe paused, and Trudaine again endeavored to speak such words as might show that he was not unworthy of the deadly risk which Lomaque was prepared to encounter. But once more the chief agent peremptorily and irritably interposed:\\n\\n\\\"I tell you, for the third time,\\\" he said, \\\"I will listen to no expressions of gratitude from you till I know when I deserve them. It is true that I recollect your father's timely kindness to me--true that I have not forgotten what passed, five years since at your house by the river-side. I remember everything, down to what you would consider the veriest trifle--that cup of coffee, for instance, which your sister kept hot for me. I told you then that you would think better of me some day. I know that you do now. But this is not all. You want to glorify me to my face for risking my life for you. I won't hear you, because my risk is of the paltriest kind. I am weary of my life. I can't look back to it with pleasure. I am too old to look forward to what is left of it with hope. There was something in that night at your house before the wedding--something in what you said, in what your sister did--which altered me. I have had my days of gloom and self-reproach, from time to time, since then. I have sickened at my slavery, and subjection, and duplicity, and cringing, first under one master then under another. I have longed to look back at my life, and comfort myself with the sight of some good action, just as a frugal man comforts himself with the sight of his little savings laid by in an old drawer. I can't do this, and I want to do it. The want takes me like a fit, at uncertain intervals--suddenly, under the most incomprehensible influences. A glance up at the blue sky--starlight over the houses of this great city, when I look out at the night from my garret window--a child's voice coming suddenly, I don't know where from--the piping of my neighbor's linnet in his little cage--now one trifling thing, now another--wakes up that want in me in a moment. Rascal as I am, those few simple words your sister spoke to the judge went through and through me like a knife. Strange, in a man like me, isn't it? I am amazed at it myself. *My* life? Bah! I've let it out for hire to be kicked about by rascals from one dirty place to another, like a football! It's my whim to give it a last kick myself, and throw it away decently before it lodges on the dunghill forever. Your sister kept a good cup of coffee hot for me, and I give her a bad life in return for the compliment. You want to thank me for it? What folly! Thank me when I have done something useful. Don't thank me for that!\\\"\\n\\nHe snapped his fingers contemptuously as he spoke, and walked away to the outer door to receive the jailer, who returned at that moment.\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" inquired the hunchback, \\\"has anybody asked for me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" answered Lomaque; \\\"not a soul has entered the room. What sort of wine did you get?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So-so! Good at a pinch, friend--good at a pinch.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah! you should go to my shop and try a certain cask, filled with a particular vintage.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What shop? Which vintage?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can't stop to tell you now; but we shall most likely meet again today. I expect to be at the prison this afternoon. Shall I ask for you? Good! I won't forget!\\\" With those farewell words he went out, and never so much as looked back at the prisoners before he closed the door.\\n\\nTrudaine returned to his sister, fearful lest his face should betray what had passed during the extraordinary interview between Lomaque and himself. But, whatever change there might be in his expression, Rose did not seem to notice it. She was still strangely inattentive to all outward things. That spirit of resignation, which is the courage of women in all great emergencies, seemed now to be the one animating spirit that fed the flame of life within her.\\n\\nWhen her brother sat down by her, she only took his hand gently and said: \\\"Let us stop together like this, Louis, till the time comes. I am not afraid of it, for I have nothing but you to make me love life, and you, too, are going to die. Do you remember the time when I used to grieve that I had never had a child to be some comfort to me? I was thinking, a moment ago, how terrible it would have been now, if my wish had been granted. It is a blessing for me, in this great misery, that I am childless. Let us talk of old days, Louis, as long as we can--not of my husband; or my marriage--only of the old times, before I was a burden and a trouble to you.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\nTHE day wore on. By ones and twos and threes at a time, the condemned prisoners came from the tribunal, and collected in the waiting-room. At two o'clock all was ready for the calling over of the death-list. It was read and verified by an officer of the court; and then the jailer took his prisoners back to St. Lazare.\\n\\nEvening came. The prisoners' meal had been served; the duplicate of the death-list had been read in public at the grate; the cell doors were all locked. From the day of their arrest, Rose and her brother, partly through the influence of a bribe, partly through Lomaque's intercession, had been confined together in one cell; and together they now awaited  the dread event of the morrow.\\n\\nTo Rose that event was death--death, to the thought of which, at least, she was now resigned. To Trudaine the fast-nearing future was darkening hour by hour, with the uncertainty which is worse than death; with the faint, fearful, unpartaken suspense, which keeps the mind ever on the rack, and wears away the heart slowly. Through the long unsolaced agony of that dreadful night, but one relief came to him. The tension of every nerve, the crushing weight of the one fatal oppression that clung to every thought, relaxed a little when Rose's bodily powers began to sink under her mental exhaustion--when her sad, dying talk of the happy times that were passed ceased softly, and she laid her head on his shoulder, and let the angel of slumber take her yet for a little while, even though she lay already under the shadow of the angel of death.\\n\\nThe morning came, and the hot summer sunrise. What life was left in the terrorstruck city awoke for the day faintly; and still the suspense of the long night remained unlightened. It was drawing near the hour when the tumbrils were to come for the victims doomed on the day before. Trudaine's ear could detect even the faintest sound in the echoing prison region outside his cell. Soon, listening near the door, he heard voices disputing on the other side of it. Suddenly, the bolts were drawn back, the key turned in the lock, and he found himself standing face to face with the hunchback and one of the subordinate attendants on the prisoners.\\n\\n\\\"Look!\\\" muttered this last man sulkily, \\\"there they are, safe in their cell, just as I said; but I tell you again they are not down in the list. What do you mean by bullying me about not chalking their door, last night, along with the rest? Catch me doing your work for you again, when you're too drunk to do it yourself!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hold your tongue, and let me have another look at the list!\\\" returned the hunchback, turning away from the cell door, and snatching a slip of paper from the other's hand. \\\"The devil take me if I can make head or tail of it!\\\" he exclaimed, scratching his head, after a careful examination of the list. \\\"I could swear that I read over their names at the grate yesterday afternoon with my own lips; and yet, look as long as I may, I certainly can't find them written down here. Give us a pinch, friend. Am I awake, or dreaming? drunk or sober this morning?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sober, I hope,\\\" said a quiet voice at his elbow. \\\"I have just looked in to see how you are after yesterday.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How I am, Citizen Lomaque? Petrified with astonishment. You yourself took charge of that man and woman for me, in the waiting-room, yesterday morning; and as for myself, I could swear to having read their names at the grate yesterday afternoon. Yet this morning here are no such things as these said names to be found in the list! What do you think of that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And what do you think,\\\" interrupted the aggrieved subordinate, \\\"of his having the impudence to bully me for being careless in chalking the doors, when he was too drunk to do it himself? too drunk to know his right hand from his left! If I wasn't the best-natured man in the world, I should report him to the head jailer.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Quite right of you to excuse him, and quite wrong of him to bully you,\\\" said Lomaque, persuasively. \\\"Take my advice,\\\" he continued, confidentially, to the hunchback, \\\"and don't trust too implicitly to that slippery memory of yours, after our little drinking bout yesterday. You could not really have read their names at the grate, you know, or of course they would be down on the list. As for the waiting-room at the tribunal, a word in your ear: chief agents of police know strange secrets. The president of the court condemns and pardons in public; but there is somebody else, with the power of ten thousand presidents, who now and then condemns and pardons in private. You can guess who. I say no more, except that I recommend you to keep your head on your shoulders, by troubling it about nothing but the list there in your hand. Stick to that literally, and nobody can blame you. Make a fuss about mysteries that don't concern you, and--\\\"\\n\\nLomaque stopped, and holding his hand edgewise, let it drop significantly over the hunchback's head. That action and the hints which preceded it seemed to bewilder the little man more than ever. He stared perplexedly at Lomaque; uttered a word or two of rough apology to his subordinate, and rolling his misshapen head portentously, walked away with the death-list crumpled up nervously in his hand.\\n\\n\\\"I should like to have a sight of them, and see if they really are the same man and woman whom I looked after yesterday morning in the waiting-room,\\\" said Lomaque, putting his hand on the cell door, just as the deputy-jailer was about to close it again.\\n\\n\\\"Look in, by all means,\\\" said the man. \\\"No doubt you will find that drunken booby as wrong in what he told you about them as he is about everything else.\\\"\\n\\nLomaque made use of the privilege granted to him immediately. He saw Trudaine sitting with his sister in the corner of the cell furthest from the door, evidently for the purpose of preventing her from overhearing the conversation outside. There was an unsettled look, however, in her eyes, a slowly-heightening color in her cheeks, which showed her to be at least vaguely aware that something unusual had been taking place in the corridor.\",\"timestamp\":1639129191,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"I wish to follow my brother's example and make my confession, as he has made his.
