He’s been a fellow at Stanford’s Legal Design Lab, worked with the Public Policy Team for the Andean Region at Facebook, the international arbitration group of Skadden Arps in London and a Legal Officer at the World Trade Organization. He is currently a partner at the law firm TFDC Abogados in Colombia. This is a shortened and adapted version of [this piece](https://blog.kleros.io/interview-with-jose-torres-on-legal-design/)*.\\n\\nThe user interface of traditional legal systems was built in the 18th Century and is full of jargon, much of which comes from French (*force majeure*) and Latin (*mens rea*).\\n\\nIt shouldn’t come as a surprise, then, that it takes several years in law school to learn how to master the court system.\\n\\nIn recent years, a new discipline called *legal design* was born. It seeks to apply concepts from the startup and design thinking fields into the legal industry to make it more user friendly and foster access to justice.\\n\\n**Tell us about your experience at Stanford and the type of legal research that is being conducted there…**\\n\\nStanford has two centers on legal innovation — the first one is [CodeX](https://law.stanford.edu/codex-the-stanford-center-for-legal-informatics/), a joint venture between School of Engineering and the School of Law. In that center, they do research on the application of technology in the practice of law. For example, how you can use technology to automate legal reasoning, how to make better research and enhance legal capabilities.\\n\\nThe other center (where I was a fellow) is called the [Legal Design Lab](http://www.legaltechdesign.com/), a joint venture between Stanford’s Hasso Platner School of Design (the D School, as it is commonly known) and the Law School.\\n\\nIts goal is to embed design thinking into law and to reimagine how legal services can be provided. It seeks to instill an innovation and creativity mindset into the students and to do research into a variety of areas. One of them is access to justice, the other being how to create innovative legal organizations in law firms and legal departments and also how you can innovate government services in general.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*bf-JgGXW_ed8SSM9dnp7Uw.jpeg)\\n\\n**Why have we not seen much innovation in legal services in the past years compared to other sectors of the economy?**\\n\\nYou are completely right, we have just started to see innovation in law in the past ten years or so. There are a couple of reasons.\\n\\nThe first is that, in general, lawyers are conservative and have been educated to become risk averse. Lawyers are educated to caution clients against legal risks. And this ends up being translated into everything we do as lawyers, so we just become risk averse in this way.\\n\\nThe fact that law has been a regulated profession has inhibited innovation significantly, because regulation has protected the profession from competition. It has prevented other disciplines entering into legal practice or legal services.\\n\\nLaw has also been very insulated as a profession, even though in legal doctrine we might have areas such as law and economics or law and sociology. In general, even though we studied the substance of the law, we haven’t studied very deeply how to become better lawyers and how to provide a better service.\\n\\nIf you look at other industries, usually companies have a percentage of their revenue dedicated to R&D and innovation. That has not been the case in legal services at all.\\n\\n**In the past years, we have seen some emerging innovation in the legal field, like RocketLawyer or LegalZoom and others applying AI. What has sparked innovation in this traditionally conservative industry?**\\n\\nThe fact that the industry has never faced competition from startups has been viewed as a huge opportunity — the legal market is quite big in the US and worldwide. Some individuals have just decided to go straight on and challenge the profession, which is the case of [LegalZoom](https://www.legalzoom.com/) and [RocketLawyer](https://www.rocketlawyer.com/), for example.\\n\\nThe general driver in the last ten years has been that the citizens in general have become very displeased with the profession and there is a worldwide crisis in access to justice. In whichever country you go, courts just don’t work. That’s irrespective of whether you are a developed or a developing country, rich or poor, large or small. Legal services have become more complex and more expensive, contrary to other areas of the economy.\\n\\nThe way legal services are developing has caused the people to cry out and demand that lawyers get out of the way and bring in different professions that can add a lot of value, because lawyers have a limited skillset. We already know what that skillset can do — it has not led us to create good courts. This discomfort has just caused other areas of the economy to jump in.\\n\\nIn some countries, innovation in law is also viewed as a factor of the competitiveness of the economy. In the case of the UK, for instance, the legal system has historically been very attractive to business. To the extent that it got slower, that had a huge impact on the economy and made the UK legal system less attractive for business.\\n\\nThat area of seeing the law as a competitive advantage for a country has moved forward countries like Canada, the UK and Singapore to really become more innovative, so they continue to be attractive economies for business.\\n\\n![José Torres.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*NwgOlv6E4Ti8Hh2dym4Mug.jpeg)\\n\\n**Tell us a little bit about legal design: how does this process work from start to the creation of a product?**\\n\\nLegal design a combination of design driven innovation applied to different areas of the law. You can apply the design process to law firms, to government services and to legal departments. There is a certain fetishism around which is “the right” design process to follow, but in general, what human-centered design strives for is to make sure that the user is put at the center of the service or the product and make sure that whatever it is that you are designing is usable and engaging from a user perspective.\\n\\nThis is a very new concept in the law. Law has been produced historically by lawyers for lawyers, without keeping the citizens in mind. If you go through any piece of legislation, they are drafted to be complex, not for us as regular citizens to understand.\\n\\nBy putting the user first, legal design seeks to produce regulation, contracts, legal pieces of information in a manner that anyone can understand, which is the whole purpose of a democracy.\\n\\nAnother big area of the design process is just making sure that you are synthesizing information with different research methods, doing tons of prototyping and conducting experiments to figure out really quickly what works and what does not.\\n\\nIf you think about the courts, for instance, we have run very few experiments, so no one knows what a 21st century court should look like. If you look at the area of design, we have run loads of experiments with software, with hardware, even with furniture — you can have a million different types of chairs for different types of services.\\n\\nA court has historically been viewed as a physical place that you have to attend. If you apply creativity to this and start reframing what a court might be, you can come up with different types of courts.\\n\\nIn my research at Stanford, I designed a court for low claim labour disputes in Colombia only using text.\\n\\nAnother area that has been growing significantly has been visualising and simplifying legal information.\\n\\nA key example is privacy policies. No one reads privacy policies online. If you reimagine what a privacy policy is and stop thinking about it as a legal document, but instead you start thinking of a privacy policy as a core part of the user experience in a service, that changes dramatically how you design a privacy policy and how you show it to a user. With a good privacy policy, you want to make sure that the user actually trusts your product and that the communication is transparent.\\n\\nAnother core idea in design is just having a bias toward action and building to learn. In law, usually, we like to reflect and think a lot, but there is not a bias towards action.\\n\\nWe like to write a lot, but we don’t like building and creating stuff. Just the fact of creating different types of artifacts, they can be digital or paper-based, physical or online, just building to learn how a system might work better is also a core area where design can bring a lot of value to the law.\",\"timestamp\":1638648447,\"title\":\"Legal Design and the Challenges of Innovation in Law\"},\"digest\":\"QcOUcj1OWi833aP1BKrkDQ2grsHSuonfXSI0N7kSFSs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xf12C67e80E309eaC0c4dc18Fb26e68F9672297E9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Zg-I0SPSkiTe6sEEOTDDZe4X52HL6LwzseCXhdv-iDw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xnlFE2vUY44I5iO7xlx2cCRWNkK2NHc5Ckpqeir1HgA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"I_TLkCRND8qW2o0Vgln0bYQSpQnv0N4UV-S-clcIrZXrsrPzg8AVk75sNwaDuB6PC5n_TNHKY5q5XotK9MBwcA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xbb67824a5cdd413a3900f8d913a162ca89ff55c3f83d74e39c738ba7412fc78570a0731025b91c70a242fe7fd50e085455303a3c5c7222d8b6f59d71dbdf1bce1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Zg-I0SPSkiTe6sEEOTDDZe4X52HL6LwzseCXhdv-iDw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xnlFE2vUY44I5iO7xlx2cCRWNkK2NHc5Ckpqeir1HgA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"QcOUcj1OWi833aP1BKrkDQ2grsHSuonfXSI0N7kSFSs\"}"
