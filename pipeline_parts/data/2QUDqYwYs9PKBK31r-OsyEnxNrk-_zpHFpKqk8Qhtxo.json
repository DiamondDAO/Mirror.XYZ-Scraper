"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"![_Screenshot of early PartyDAO designs_](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s%2Ffby1akx828fucri%2Fimage_kyy0ijac9l.png)\\n\\nThere was a livestreamed collaborative design session for [PartyDAO](https://party.mirror.xyz/) on Monday, which was a lot of fun to watch. There is a [public Figma board](https://www.figma.com/file/129WL3Stz1PKSMblzG0ton/PartyDAO?node-id=0%3A1) you can dig through.\\n\\nThe group is building PartyBid, a new app for collectively bidding on NFTs, a la [PleasrDAO](https://decrypt.co/66933/why-this-dao-bought-snowden-nft). It has been amazing watching this team assemble and start building over the last few weeks, and I believe it is a repeatable model we will see more and more often.\\n\\nTheir speed and quality has been comparable to a tight-knit, VC-backed startup, but it is definitively not that. The project started when Denis Nazarov posted an idea on Twitter: \\\"wouldn't it be cool if you could deploy an automatic DAO to bid on an NFT auction?\\\"[\\\\[1\\\\]]() A group of people spontaneously organized, raised money from whoever would contribute[\\\\[2\\\\]](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) , and are now bringing open-source software to life. It's only been a month since that first tweet, and folks are now getting paid to build fully independent, open-source software. \\n\\nI believe PartyDAO is a sneak preview of what many startups will look like in the future. \\nSpontaneously organized, cooperatively-owned, and funded by community tokens and crowdfunding. \\n\\nUnlike most DAOs, which generally just collect and distribute money, PartyDAO is actively building and shipping software. Unlike most small open-source projects, they have a budget and a path for future funding.\\n\\nThey are open-source not necessarily because of their belief in contributing to the public good, but because it is also an excellent marketing and recruitment strategy. They are cooperatively-organized not just because it is more fair and inclusive, but because it is less work, and everyone understands the benefits of skin in the game. The morally superior path provides practical benefits.\\n\\nBuilding stuff is fun, and building stuff with friends is even better. Geting paid to build stuff with friends, all open-source, no bosses, plus you've got a legitimate ownership stake in what you're building? That's another level.\\n\\n_For more background on PartyDAO, check out [my previous post](https://jamiedubs.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-partydao/)_\\n\\n_Thanks to [Diana Kimball](https://twitter.com/dianakimball) and [Chris Kurdziel](https://twitter.com/ckurdziel) for feedback on this post_\",\"timestamp\":1622738109,\"title\":\"PartyDAO is what startups will look like in the future\",\"publication\":\"jamiew\"},\"digest\":\"Vc1CdP0uXzuoZRPk-whtM_S_8F51WSS87_JEXYM90pU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD9C4475E2dd89a9a0aD0C1E9a1e1bb28Df7BA298\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BsaRBms0yNjZrySsOfdig-aWgKQW52YVmP87yW63Egc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"cKKQid3FzwxAGQ1JFNgEngme87cVa4iD4G9Gw7jFKlk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"5RFPRCcc4nYVa7Z-THGHwj6YjshyIFOw9Kswjr3clVrQ3gsIpJku0UvuclZlJsfvZsRn0QsY2mbY-LfMeyr6kw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa547afda17d2674874b1b6aa791c177c5c200e30a28a6ec47c84107a72ec3937475ee63b0d7ff8d5ed1991d389f748f5f47bb4bd008587926641a753f70bb9a21c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on jamiew.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BsaRBms0yNjZrySsOfdig-aWgKQW52YVmP87yW63Egc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"cKKQid3FzwxAGQ1JFNgEngme87cVa4iD4G9Gw7jFKlk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Vc1CdP0uXzuoZRPk-whtM_S_8F51WSS87_JEXYM90pU\"}"
