"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Yes, if he went away early, and was out of humor too, such must be the case.... He's been so long in love, and I'm very sorry for him.'\\n`So that's it!... I should imagine, though, she might reckon on a better match,' said Vronsky, setting his chest straight and walking about again, `though I don't know him, of course,' he added. `Yes, that is a hateful position! That's why most fellows prefer to have to do with the Claras. If you don't succeed with them it only proves that you've not enough cash, but in this case one's dignity is in the balance. But here's the train.'   The engine had already whistled in the distance. A few instants later the platform began to shake, and, with puffs of steam hanging low in the air from the frost, the engine rolled up, with the rod of the middle wheel rhythmically moving up and down, and the bowed, muffled figure of the engine driver covered with hoarfrost. Behind the tender, setting the platform more and more slowly and more powerfully shaking, came the luggage van with a dog whining in it. At last the passenger carriages rolled in, quivering before coming to a standstill.   A smart guard jumped out, giving a whistle, and after him one by one the impatient passengers began to get down: an officer of the guards, holding himself erect, and looking severely about him; a nimble young merchant with a bag, smiling gaily; a peasant with a sack over his shoulder.   Vronsky, standing beside Oblonsky, watched the carriages and the passengers, totally oblivious of his mother. What he had just heard about Kitty excited and delighted him. Unconsciously he straightened his chest, and his eyes flashed. He felt himself a conqueror.   `Countess Vronskaia is in that compartment,' said the smart guard, going up to Vronsky.\\nThe guard's words roused him, and forced him to think of his mother and his approaching meeting with her. He did not in his heart respect his mother, and, without acknowledging it to himself, he did not love her, though in accordance with the ideas of the set in which he lived, and with his own upbringing, he could not have conceived of any behavior to his mother not in the highest degree respectful and obedient, and the more externally obedient and respectful, the less in his heart he respected and loved her.\\n\\nChapter 18\\nVronsky followed the guard to the carriage, and at the door of the compartment he stopped short to make room for a lady who was getting out.\\nWith the habitual feeling of a man of the world, from one glance at this lady's appearance Vronsky classified her as belonging to the best society. He begged pardon, and was getting into the carriage, but felt he must glance at her once more; not because she was very beautiful, not because of that elegance and modest grace which were apparent in her whole figure, but because in the expression of her charming face, as she passed close by him, there was something peculiarly caressing and soft. As he looked round, she too turned her head. Her shining gray eyes, that looked dark because of her thick lashes, rested with friendly attention on his face, as though she were recognizing him, and then promptly turned away to the passing crowd, as though seeking someone. In that brief look Vronsky had time to notice the suppressed animation which played over her face, and flitted between the brilliant eyes and the faint smile that curved her red lips. It was as though her nature were so brimming over with something that, against her will, it showed itself now in the flash of her eyes, and now in her smile. Deliberately she shrouded the light in her eyes, but it shone against her will in her faintly perceptible smile.\\nVronsky stepped into the carriage. His mother, a dried-up old lady with black eyes and ringlets, screwed up her eyes, scanning her son, and smiled slightly with her thin lips. Getting up from the seat and handing her maid a handbag, she gave her little wrinkled hand to her son to kiss, and lifting his head from her hand, kissed him on the cheek.\\n`You got my telegram? Quite well? Thank God.'   `You had a good journey?' said her son, sitting down beside her, and involuntarily listening to a woman's voice outside the door. He knew it was the voice of the lady he had met at the door.\\n`All the same I don't agree with you,' said the lady's voice.   `It's the Peterburg view, madame.'\\n`Not Peterburg, but simply feminine,' she responded.   `Well, well, allow me to kiss your hand.'\\n`Good-by, Ivan Petrovich. And would you see if my brother is here, and send him to me?' said the lady in the doorway, and stepped back again into the compartment.   `Well, have you found your brother?' said Countess Vronskaia, addressing the lady.\\nVronsky understood now that this was Madame Karenina.\\n`Your brother is here,' he said, standing up. `Excuse me, I did not know you, and, indeed, our acquaintance was so slight,' said Vronsky bowing, `that no doubt you do not remember me.'   `Oh, no,' said she, `I should have known you because your mother and I have been talking, I think, of nothing but you all the way.' As she spoke she let the animation that would insist on coming out show itself in her smile. `And still no sign of my brother.'\\n`Do call him, Aliosha,' said the old countess.   Vronsky stepped out onto the platform and shouted: `Oblonsky! Here!'\\nMadame Karenina, however, did not wait for her brother, but catching sight of him she stepped out with her light, resolute step. And as soon as her brother had reached her, with a gesture that struck Vronsky by its decision and its grace, she flung her left arm around his neck, drew him rapidly to her, and kissed him warmly. Vronsky looked on, never taking his eyes from her, and smiled, he could not have said why. But recollecting that his mother was waiting for him, he went back again into the carriage.\\n`She's very sweet, isn't she?' said the Countess of Madame Karenina. `Her husband put her with me, and I was delighted to have her. We've been talking all the way. And so you, I hear... vous filez le parfait amour. Tant mieux, mon cher, tant mieux.'\\n`I don't know what you are referring to, maman,' he answered coldly. `Come, maman, let us go.'\\nMadame Karenina entered the carriage again to say good-by to the Countess.\\n`Well, Countess, you have met your son, and I my brother,' she said gaily. `And all my stories are exhausted; I should have nothing more to tell you.'\\n`Oh, no,' said the Countess, taking her hand. `I could go all around the world with you and never be dull. You are one of those delightful women in whose company it's sweet either to be silent or to chat. Now please don't fret over your son; you can't expect never to be parted.'\\nMadame Karenina stood quite still, holding herself very erect, and her eyes were smiling.\\n`Anna Arkadyevna,' the Countess said in explanation to her son, `has a little son eight years old, I believe, and she has never been parted from him before, and she keeps fretting over leaving him.'\\n`Yes, the Countess and I have been talking all the time, I of my son and she of hers,' said Madame Karenina, and again a smile lighted up her face - a caressing smile intended for him.   `I am afraid that you must have been dreadfully bored,' he said, promptly catching the ball of coquetry she had flung him. But apparently she did not care to pursue the conversation in that strain, and she turned to the old Countess.\\n`Thank you so much. The time has passed so quickly. Good-by, Countess.'   `Good-by, my love,' answered the Countess. `Let me kiss your pretty face. I speak plainly, at my age, and I tell you simply that I've lost my heart to you.'   Stereotyped as the phrase was, Madame Karenina obviously believed it and was delighted by it. She flushed, bent down slightly, and put her cheek to the Countes'ss lips, drew herself up again, and, with the same smile fluttering between her lips and her eyes, she gave her hand to Vronsky. He pressed the little hand she gave him, and was delighted, as though at something special, by the energetic squeeze with which she freely and vigorously shook his hand. She went out with the rapid step which bore her rather fully developed figure with such strange lightness.   `Very charming,' said the Countess.\\nThat was precisely what her son was thinking. His eyes followed her till her graceful figure was out of sight, and then the smile remained on his face. He saw out of the window how she went up to her brother, put her arm in his, and began telling him something animatedly - obviously something that had nothing to do with him, Vronsky, and at that he felt annoyed.\\n`Well, maman, are you perfectly well?' he repeated, turning to his mother.   `Everything has been delightful. Alexandre has been very good, and Marie has grown very pretty. She's very interesting.'\\nAnd she began telling him again of what interested her most - the christening of her grandson, for which she had been staying in Peterburg, and the special favor shown her elder son by the Czar.\\n`Here's Lavrentii,' said Vronsky, looking out of the window; `now we can go, if you like.'\\nThe old butler who had traveled with the Countess came to the carriage to announce that everything was ready, and the Countess got up to go.\\n`Come; there's not such a crowd now,' said Vronsky.   The maid took a handbag and the lap dog, the butler and a porter the other baggage. Vronsky gave his mother his arm; but just as they were getting out of the carriage several men ran suddenly by with panic-stricken faces. The stationmaster, too, ran by in his extraordinarily colored cap. Obviously something unusual had happened. The crowd was running to the tail end of the train.   `What?... What?... Where?... Flung himself!... Crushed!...' was heard among the crowd.\\nStepan Arkadyevich, with his sister on his arm, turned back. They too looked scared, and stopped at the carriage door to avoid the crowd.\\nThe ladies got in, while Vronsky and Stepan Arkadyevich followed the crowd to find out details of the disaster.\\nA watchman, either drunk or too much muffled up in the bitter frost, had not heard the train moving back, and had been crushed.\\nBefore Vronsky and Oblonsky came back the ladies heard the facts from the butler.\\nOblonsky and Vronsky had both seen the mutilated corpse. Oblonsky was evidently distressed. He frowned and seemed ready to cry.\\n`Ah, how awful! Ah, Anna, if you had seen it! Ah, how awful!' he kept repeating.   Vronsky did not speak; his handsome face was serious, but perfectly calm.   `Ah, if you had seen it, Countess,' said Stepan Arkadyevich. `And his wife was there.... It was awful to see her!... She flung herself on the body. They say he was the only support of an immense family. How awful!'   `Couldn't one do anything for her?' said Madame Karenina in an agitated whisper.\\nVronsky glanced at her, and immediately got out of the carriage.\\n`I'll be back directly, maman,' he remarked, turning round in the doorway.   When he came back a few minutes later, Stepan Arkadyevich was already in conversation with the Countess about a new singer, while she was impatiently looking toward the door, waiting for her son.   `Now let us be off,' said Vronsky, coming in.\\nThey went out together. Vronsky was in front with his mother. Behind walked Madame Karenina with her brother. Just as they were going out of the station the stationmaster overtook Vronsky.\\n`You gave my assistant two hundred roubles. Would you kindly explain for whose benefit you intend them?'   `For the widow,' said Vronsky, shrugging his shoulders. `I should have thought there was no need to ask.'   `You gave that?' cried Oblonsky behind, and, pressing his sister's hand, he added: `Most charming, most charming! Isn't he a fine fellow? Good-by, Countess.'   And he and his sister stood still, looking for her maid.   When they went out the Vronsky's carriage had already driven away. People coming in were still talking of what had happened.   `What a horrible death!' said a gentleman, passing by. `They say he was cut in two.'   `On the contrary, I think it's the easiest - instantaneous,' observed another.\\n`How is it they don't take proper precautions?' a third was saying.   Madame Karenina seated herself in the carriage, and Stepan Arkadyevich saw with surprise that her lips were quivering, and that she was with difficulty restraining her tears.   `What is it, Anna?' he asked, when they had driven a few hundred sagenes.\\n`It's an omen of evil,' she said.   `What nonsense!' said Stepan Arkadyevich. `You've come, that's the chief thing. You can't conceive how I'm resting my hopes on you.'   `Have you known Vronsky long? she asked.\\n`Yes. You know we're hoping he will marry Kitty.'   `Yes?' said Anna softly. `Come now, let us talk of you,' she added, tossing her head, as though she would physically shake off something superfluous oppressing her. `Let us talk of your affairs. I got your letter, and here I am.'\\n`Yes, all my hopes are in you,' said Stepan Arkadyevich.   `Well, tell me all about it.'\\nAnd Stepan Arkadyevich began his story.\\nOn reaching home Oblonsky helped his sister out, sighed, pressed her hand, and set off to his office.\\nChapter 19\\nWhen Anna entered the tiny drawing room, she found Dolly sitting there with a white-headed plump little boy, already resembling his father; she was listening to a lesson in French reading. As the boy read, he kept twisting and trying to tear off a button that was nearly off his jacket. His mother had several times taken his hand from it, but the plump little hand went back to the button again. His mother pulled the button off and put it in her pocket.\\n`Keep your hands still, Grisha,' she said, and she took up her work, a coverlet she had long been making. She always set to work on it at depressed moments, and now she knitted at it nervously, twitching her fingers and counting the stitches. Though she had sent word the day before to her husband that it was nothing to her whether his sister came or not, she had made everything ready for her arrival, and was expecting her sister-in-law with agitation.   Dolly was crushed by her sorrow, utterly swallowed up by it. Still she did not forget that Anna, her sister-in-law, was the wife of one of the most important personages in Peterburg, and was a Peterburg grande dame. And, thanks to this circumstance, she did not carry out her threat to her husband - that is to say, she had not forgotten that her sister-in-law was coming. `And, after all, Anna is in no wise to blame,' thought Dolly. `I know nothing save the very best about her, and I have seen nothing but kindness and affection from her toward myself.' It was true that as far as she could recall her impressions at Peterburg at the Karenin's, she did not like their household itself; there was something artificial about the whole arrangement of their family life. `But why should I not receive her? If only she doesn't take it into her head to console me!' thought Dolly. `All consolations and exhortations and Christian forgiveness - I have thought all this over a thousand times, and it's all no use.'   All these days Dolly had been alone with her children. She did not want to talk of her sorrow, but with that sorrow in her heart she could not talk of outside matters.   She knew that in one way or another she would tell Anna everything, and she was alternately glad at the thought of speaking freely, and angry at the necessity of speaking of her humiliation with her, his sister, and of hearing her ready-made phrases of exhortation and consolation.   She had been on the lookout for her, glancing at her watch every minute, and, as often happens, let slip that precise minute when her visitor arrived, so that she did not hear the bell.   Catching the sound of skirts and of light steps at the door, she looked round, and her careworn face unconsciously expressed not gladness, but wonder. She got up and embraced her sister-in-law.   `What, here already?' she said as she kissed her.\\n`Dolly, how glad I am to see you!'   `I am glad, too,' said Dolly, faintly smiling, and trying by the expression of Anna's face to find out whether she knew. `Most likely she knows,' she thought, noticing the sympathy in Anna's face. `Well, come along, I'll take you to your room,' she went on, trying to defer as long as possible the time of explanation.\\n`Is this Grisha? Heavens, how he's grown!' said Anna; and kissing him, never taking her eyes off Dolly, she stood still and flushed. `No, please, let us stay here.'\\nShe took off her shawl and her hat, and catching it in a lock of her black hair, which was a mass of curls, she tossed her head and shook her hair down.\\n`You are radiant with health and happiness!' said Dolly, almost with envy.   `I?... Yes,' said Anna. `Merciful heavens, Tania! You're the same age as my Seriozha,' she added, addressing the little girl as she ran in. She took her in her arms and kissed her. `Delightful child, delightful! Show me them all.'\\nShe mentioned them, not only remembering the names, but the years, months, characters, illnesses of all the children, and Dolly could not but appreciate that.\\n`Very well, we will go to them,' she said. `It's a pity Vassia's asleep.'\\nAfter seeing the children, they sat down, alone now, in the drawing room, to coffee. Anna took the tray, and then pushed it away from her.\\n`Dolly,' she said, `he has told me.'\\nDolly looked coldly at Anna; she was waiting now for hypocritically sympathetic phrases, but Anna said nothing of the sort.\\n`Dolly, darling,' she said, `I don't want to intercede for him, nor to try to comfort you - that's impossible. But, my dearest, I'm simply sorry, sorry from my heart for you!'\\nUnder the thick lashes of her shining eyes tears suddenly glittered. She moved nearer to her sister-in-law and took her hand in her own, vigorous and little. Dolly did not shrink away, but her face did not lose its frigid expression. She said:\\n`To comfort me is impossible. Everything's lost after what has happened, everything's over!'   And directly she had said this, her face suddenly softened. Anna lifted the wasted, thin hand of Dolly, kissed it and said:   `But, Dolly, what's to be done, what's to be done? How is it best to act in this awful position - that's what you must think of.'\\n`All's over, and there's nothing more,' said Dolly. `And the worst of it all is, you see, that I can't cast him off: there are the children - my hands are tied. And I can't live with him! It's a torture for me to see him.'\\n`Dolly, darling, he has spoken to me, but I want to hear it from you: tell me all about it.'   Dolly looked at her inquiringly.   Sympathy and love unfeigned were apparent on Anna's face.   `Very well,' she suddenly said. `But I will begin at the beginning. You know how I was married. With the education maman gave us I was more than innocent - I was foolish. I knew nothing. They say, I know, men tell their wives of their former lives, but Stiva' - she corrected herself - `Stepan Arkadyevich told me nothing. You'll hardly believe it, but till now I imagined that I was the only woman he had known. So I lived eight years. You must understand that I was not only far from suspecting infidelity, but I regarded it as impossible, and then - try to imagine it - with such conceptions to find out suddenly all the horror, all the loathsomeness... You must try and understand me. To be fully convinced of one's happiness, and all at once...' continued Dolly, holding back her sobs, `To get a letter... His letter to his mistress, a governess in my employ. No, it's too awful!' She hastily pulled out her handkerchief and hid her face in it. `I can understand if it were passion,' she went on, after a brief silence, `but to deceive me deliberately, slyly... And with whom?... To go on being my husband while he and she... It's awful! You can't understand...'   `Oh, yes, I understand! I understand! Dolly, dearest, I do understand,' said Anna, pressing her hand.\\n`And do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position? Dolly resumed. `Not in the slightest! He's happy and contented.'\\n`Oh, no!' Anna interposed quickly. `He's to be pitied, he's weighed down by remorse...'\\n`Is he capable of remorse?' Dolly interrupted, gazing intently into her sister-in-law's face.   `Yes. I know him. I could not look at him without feeling sorry for him. We both know him. He's good-natured, but he's proud, and now he's so humiliated. What touched me most...' (And here Anna guessed what would touch Dolly most.) `He's tortured by two things: that he's ashamed for the children's sake, and that, loving you - yes, yes, loving you beyond everything on earth,' she hurriedly interrupted Dolly, who would have rejoined - `he has hurt you, pierced you to the heart. \\\\`\\\\`No, no, she cannot forgive me,'' he keeps on saying.'\\nDolly looked pensively past her sister-in-law as she listened to her words.\\n`Yes, I can see that his position is awful; it's worse for the guilty than the innocent,' she said, `if he feels that all the misery comes from his fault. But how am I to forgive him, how am I to be his wife again after her? For me to live with him now would be torture, just because I love my past love for him...'\\nAnd sobs cut short her words.\\nBut as though of set design, each time she was softened she began to speak again of what exasperated her.\\n`She's young, you see, she's pretty,' she went on. `Do you know, Anna, my youth and my beauty are gone, taken by whom? By him and his children. I have worked for him, and all I had has gone in his service, and now of course any fresh, vulgar creature has more charm for him. No doubt they talked of me together, or, worse still, they were silent about me.... Do you understand?'\\nAgain her eyes glowed with hatred.\\n`And after that he will tell me... What! Am I to believe him? Never! No, everything is over, everything that once constituted my comfort, the reward of my work and of my sufferings... Would you believe it? I was teaching Grisha just now: once this was a joy to me, now it is a torture. What have I to strive and toil for? Why to have children? What's so awful is that all at once my heart's turned, and instead of love and tenderness, I have nothing but hatred for him; yes, hatred. I could kill him and...'   `Darling Dolly, I understand, but don't torture yourself You are so insulted, so excited, that you look at many things mistakenly.'\\nDolly grew calmer, and for two minutes both were silent.\\n`What's to be done? Think for me, Anna, help me. I have thought over everything, and I see nothing.'   Anna could not find anything, but her heart echoed instantly to each word, to each change of expression on her sister-in-law's face.   `One thing I would say,' began Anna. `I am his sister, I know his character, that faculty of forgetting everything, everything' (she waved her hand before her forehead), `that faculty for being completely carried away, but for completely repenting, too. He cannot believe it, he cannot comprehend now, how he could have acted as he did.'\\n`No; he understands, and understood!' Dolly broke in. `But I... You are forgetting me... Does that make it easier for me?'\\n`Wait a minute. When he told me, I will own I did not realize all the horror of your position. I saw nothing but him, and that the family was broken up. I felt sorry for him, but after talking to you, I see it, as a woman, quite differently. I see your agony, and I can't tell you how sorry I am for you! But, Dolly, darling, while I fully realize your sufferings, there is one thing I don't know; I don't know... I don't know how much love there is still in your heart for him. That you know - whether there is enough for you to be able to forgive him. If there is - forgive him!'   `No,' Dolly was beginning, but Anna cut her short, kissing her hand once more.\\n`I know more of the world than you do,' she said. I know how men like Stiva look at it. You speak of his talking of you with her. That never happened. Such men are unfaithful, but their own home and wife are sacred to them. Somehow or other these women are still looked on with contempt by them, and do not touch on their feeling for their family. They draw a sort of line that can't be crossed between them and their families. I don't understand it, but it is so.'   `Yes, but he has kissed her...'\\n`Dolly, hush, darling. I saw Stiva when he was in love with you. I remember the time when he came to me and cried, talking of you, and of what a poetry and loftiness you were for him, and I know that the longer he has lived with you the loftier you have been in his eyes. You know we have sometimes laughed at him for putting in at every word: `Dolly's a marvelous woman.' have always been a divinity for him, and you are that still, and this has not been a passion of the heart...\\n`But if it be repeated?'   `It cannot be, as I understand it...\\n`Yes, but could you forgive it?'   `I don't know, I can't judge... No, I can judge,' said Anna, thinking a moment; and grasping the position in her thought and weighing it in her inner balance, she added: `Yes, I can, I can, I can. Yes, I could forgive. I could not be the same, no; but I could forgive, and forgive as though it had never been, never been at all....'   `Oh, of course,' Dolly interposed quickly, as though saying what she had more than once thought, `else it would not be forgiveness. If one forgives, it must be completely, completely. Come, let us go; I'll take you to your room,' she said, getting up, and on the way she embraced Anna. `My dear, how glad I am you came. It has made things better, ever so much better.'\\n\\nChapter 20\\nThe whole of that day Anna spent at home - that is, at the Oblonsky's, and received no one, though some of her acquaintances had already heard of her arrival, and came to call the same day. Anna spent the whole morning with Dolly and the children. She merely sent a brief note to her brother to tell him that he must not fail to dine at home. `Come, God is merciful,' she wrote.   Oblonsky did dine at home: the conversation was general, and his wife, speaking to him, addressed him as `Stiva,' as she had not done for some time past. In the relations of husband and wife the same estrangement still remained, but there was no talk of separation, and Stepan Arkadyevich saw the possibility of explanation and reconciliation.\\nImmediately after dinner Kitty came in. She knew Anna Arkadyevna, but only very slightly, and she came now to her sister's with some trepidation, at the prospect of meeting this fashionable Peterburg lady, of whom everyone spoke so highly. But she made a favorable impression on Anna Arkadyevna - she perceived that at once. Anna was unmistakably admiring her loveliness and her youth: before Kitty knew where she was she found herself not merely under Anna's sway, but in love with her, as young girls do fall in love with older and married women. Anna did not resemble a fashionable lady, or the mother of a boy eight years old. In the elasticity of her movements, the freshness and the animation which persisted in her face and broke out in her smile and her glance, she would rather have passed for a girl of twenty, had it not been for a serious and, at times, a mournful look in her eyes, which struck and attracted Kitty. Kitty felt that Anna was perfectly simple and was concealing nothing, but that she had another higher world of interests, complex and poetic, which were inaccessible to Kitty.\\nAfter dinner, when Dolly withdrew to her own room, Anna rose quickly and went up to her brother, who was just lighting a cigar.\\n`Stiva,' she said to him, winking gaily, making the sign of the cross over him, and glancing toward the door, `go, and God help you.\\nHe tossed away his cigar, having understood her, and departed through the doorway.\\nWhen Stepan Arkadyevich had disappeared, she went back to the sofa where she had been sitting, surrounded by the children. Either because the children saw that their mother was fond of this aunt, or that they themselves sensed a special charm in her, the two elder ones, and the younger following their lead, as children so often do, had clung about their new aunt since before dinner, and would not leave her side. And it had become a sort of game among them to sit as close as possible to their aunt, to touch her, hold her little hand, kiss it, play with her ring, or even touch the flounce of her skirt.\\n`Come, come, as we were sitting before,' said Anna Arkadyevna, sitting down in her place.   And again Grisha poked his little face under her arm, and nestled with his head on her gown, beaming with pride and happiness.   `And when is your next ball?' she asked Kitty.\\n`Next week - and a splendid ball. One of those balls where one always enjoys oneself.'   `Why, are there balls where one always enjoys oneself?' Anna said, with tender irony.\\n`It's strange, but there are. At the Bobrishchev's one always enjoys oneself, and at the Nikitin's too, while at the Mezhkov's it's always dull. Haven't you noticed it?'   `No, my dear, for me there are no balls now where one enjoys oneself,' said Anna, and Kitty detected in her eyes that peculiar world which was not revealed to her. `For me there are some which are less dull and tiresome than others.'   `How can you be dull at a ball?'\\n`Why should not I be dull at a ball?' inquired Anna.   Kitty perceived that Anna knew what answer would follow.   `Because you always look the loveliest of all.'\\nAnna had the faculty of blushing. She blushed, and said:\\n`In the first place it's never so; and secondly, if it were, what difference would it make to me?'   `Are you coming to this ball? asked Kitty.\\n`I imagine it won't be possible to avoid going. Here, take it,' she said to Tania, who was pulling the loosely fitting ring off her white, slender-tipped finger.   `I shall be so glad if you go. I should so like to see you at a ball.'\\n`Anyway, if I do go, I shall comfort myself with the thought that it's a pleasure to you.... Grisha, don't pull my hair. It's untidy enough without that,' she said, putting up a straying lock, which Grisha had been playing with.   `I imagine you at the ball in lilac.'\\n`And why in lilac, precisely?' asked Anna, smiling. `Now, children, run along, run along. Do you hear? Miss Hoole is calling you to tea,' she said tearing the children from her, and sending them off to the dining room.\\n`I know why you press me to come to the ball. You expect a great deal of this ball, and you want everyone to be there and take part in it.'   `How do you know? Yes!'\\n`Oh! What a happy time you are at,' pursued Anna. `I remember, and I know this blue haze, like the mist on the mountains in Switzerland. This mist, which covers everything in that blissful time when childhood is just ending, and out of that vast circle, happy and gay, there is a path growing narrower and narrower, and it is delightful and alarming to enter the ballroom, bright and splendid as it is.... Who has not been through it?'\\nKitty smiled without speaking. `But how did she go through it? How I should like to know all her love story!' thought Kitty, recalling the unromantic appearance of Alexei Alexandrovich, her husband.   `I know something. Stiva told me, and I congratulate you. I liked him so much,' Anna continued. `I met Vronsky at the railway station.'   `Oh, was he there?' asked Kitty, blushing. `What was it Stiva told you?'   `Stiva blabbed about it all. And I should be so glad. I traveled yesterday with Vronsky's mother,' she went on; `and his mother talked without a pause of him; he's her favorite. I know mothers are partial, but...'   `What did his mother tell you?'\\n`Oh, a great deal! And although I know that he's her favorite, one can still see how chivalrous he is.... Well, for instance, she told me that he had wanted to give up all his property to his brother; that he had done something extraordinary when he was quite a child - saved a woman from the water. He's a hero, in fact,' said Anna, smiling and recollecting the two hundred roubles he had given at the station.   But she did not tell Kitty about the two hundred roubles. For some reason it was disagreeable to her to think of it.
