"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Platon took her iris and coupled it with her reading her statement of reconciliation to create a unique NFT. The auction ran for seven days in September but, owing to the aforementioned vagaries of this world, this NFT did not sell. It’s not stopping Platon, though. He has many more irises and causes to celebrate and he’s planning multiple iris NFT drops in the future.\\n\\n#### The trouble with Harvey\\n\\nAt the core of these drops is a story. Each iris tells a story. Each story asks a question.\\n\\nIncluded in the first drop was filmmaker Harvey Weinstein, prior to the **#**MeToo movement.\\n\\n“At the time the portrait was themed ‘bad boy Hollywood’. Now we know him to be a modern-day monster.\\n\\n> *“What if I took away 90%, 95% of the picture. Just reduced it to the eye, the window to the soul, and even further reduced it to the iris. What can we see then? Can we even judge?”*\\n\\nWhich brings us to the title of the drop – “Eye Love You, Eye Hate You II.”\\n\\n“The eye is the most intimate part of the body; when we are in love, we look deeply into our partner’s eyes,” says Platon.\\n\\n“If I strip away everything except the iris – can we love, can we hate? And if all our irises are indistinguishable, then who can judge?”\\n\\n \",\"timestamp\":1639040579,\"title\":\"Platon took her iris and coupled it with her reading her statement \"},\"digest\":\"mE4GZDKrDhEx_I9N52_R9l78CbNXOljRDP0UPrnJMyY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x02F705F080473Deb3fD3feDad4dff30C55F24fcA\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0VQsP8hbezfIjiKr__ZnkTKRVifU_oDvvcSVvAsMyoQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JybJLPQN9z99A5fioZUFziJEuakdLsOtgZfMArjhuJs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"RJ0DkhWvAHl2mYEZ9VP2LZUNbIxyxACknazAfdjwiuJsH8BjmbTipoIXDABIbjG6XodtCsE5cLI4O0P0YZsizg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4057ab2494c493e90dd79c5317139513d111dbf8b3752948521a4bed64729f8e7210422904f1e66420c88b047ad8ecac502461561e0c7f60730760ffcbd0dba31c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0VQsP8hbezfIjiKr__ZnkTKRVifU_oDvvcSVvAsMyoQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JybJLPQN9z99A5fioZUFziJEuakdLsOtgZfMArjhuJs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"mE4GZDKrDhEx_I9N52_R9l78CbNXOljRDP0UPrnJMyY\"}"
