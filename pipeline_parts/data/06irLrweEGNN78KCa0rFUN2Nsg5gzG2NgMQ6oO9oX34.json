"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"If you read my first post, there are some changes ahead.\\n\\nBasically, [Shiny Object Social Club](https://shinyobjects.gg/) announced some things a few days after I published it that really hit on the “let’s sort through this web3 information overload and incentivize people to find and curate it”.\\n\\nThey’re the reason I got into this space, their community is great, and I’d encourage anyone who vibed with the goals of that first post to join that group. It’s gonna make it.\\n\\n### Where does that leave Blergs?\\n\\nI’ve followed a quite a few NFT launches over the last few months, to try to learn what makes some work and others fail. Some have made it big, some have never sold out, some have pumped and then dumped, and some have grown slowly over time, after finding the right vibe and community.\\n\\nA few that I’ve followed started from relatively unknown teams started with a low-volume Genesis run. Something to test the waters. Chubbicorns, Stimaes, Galactic Apes, all did early runs of art in a low volume with utility coming later.\\n\\nThey were able to find the right group of people who weren’t all looking to flip and bail, and could weather the storm of instability that seems to follow anything in the web3 space. They also found early adopters who helped improve the project and give feedback without 15,000 “wen lambo” screaming Discord users muddying the water.\\n\\n**Phase 1 Blergs will take the Genesis approach.**\\n\\nOn that note, if you’re reading this hoping to ride the Blergs hype train to 100x… I don’t think this is the project for you. I started making this and will continue to make this about learning and building and sharing what I’ve learned. I want to make the later stages of this project open to people who are just getting into the space, and that means that I don’t want it to be cost prohibitive.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, I don’t want cost to be any barrier. More on that later.\\n\\nI started all of this to learn about the space, and have some fun. So far, that’s exactly what I’ve done. But now let’s talk about what Blergs is going to be, or at least what the plans are for now. Yes, this is kindof a roadmap, but more-so, it’s the distillation of a dozen different Discord chats and threads I’ve been having over the last few weeks. It’s my goal, but goals change with new information and learning. If they do, I’ll share updates.\\n\\nSo. Here we go.\\n\\n## Phase 1 - The Blerginning\\n\\nThe Blerginning will be a small run of 400 PFPs, hand picked by yours truly. 50 of those Blerginners will have extra unique properties and traits and will play a role in the later phases of the project. Holding a Blerginners will grant free minting to all future Blergs projects and exclusive airdrops to holders.\\n\\nMint price for the Blerginners project will be .1 ETH\\n\\nThe goal of Phase 1 is to:\\n\\n* Validate that people like the art, get a core group to participate and grow the idea.\\n* Fund the ability to launch Phase 2, since a larger effort will be needed to make it happen. I want to be able to have bounties for developers to help build, or be able to have resources to help with community management.\\n* Make sure that we can launch properly, test out the tech to make it happen, and get the experience needed to navigate in more complex waters.\\n\\nLaunch date is TBD. This post will update when it’s announced.\\n\\n[Register here](https://www.premint.xyz/the-blerginning/)\\n\\n## Phase 2 - 1 Wallet = 1 Blerg\\n\\nAfter phase 1, Blergs will be all about Traits. There will not be another randomized drop of PFPs like there was with Genesis. \\n\\nInstead, the next mint for this project will be a mint of packs of traits, so that Blergs can be made, interchanged, swapped, and created.\\n\\nThe chain, method, number of traits, packs, etc will all be defined later, but here’s how it will work.\",\"timestamp\":1638239264,\"title\":\"1 Wallet = 1 Blerg\"},\"digest\":\"4IQKDlt1XH8zJK1-4sVZy9w1YRwaTRH_bNBG1m4pgog\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6D8Df15FD3dC3505a4010CaC6937De159d68081C\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"vT_uN69kjZLlvs5-tpL1spLQBtGaH5Rd8gVMHrFn2Sk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"C1kE2S8CqcBJlA0LJhPkri4D61sWR0SYYVmOk53QTuw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"0Ga19SRvv35T__pUZ83lz_mcdRuMUvcp12867nZihO9xFaoSJQH2wTxBwhY2oPtnflN3mfFnv2NXk1m_YezujA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2cf2a9638f1f8159d89a25fe4925178cb8d1370278da4fe827afb7ba2f960b1318efdaf899cfda3a9a60661b81f18ecabc6fd8d87da5df6472e7cfe4d5079f401b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"vT_uN69kjZLlvs5-tpL1spLQBtGaH5Rd8gVMHrFn2Sk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"C1kE2S8CqcBJlA0LJhPkri4D61sWR0SYYVmOk53QTuw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"KKj99vLd0uQ6NLamk83khF_Obtb9mGNHZGHpaNz8q7M\"}"
