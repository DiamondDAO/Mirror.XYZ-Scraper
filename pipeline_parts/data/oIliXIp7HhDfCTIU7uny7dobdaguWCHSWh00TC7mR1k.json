"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"why am i writing a blog? good question, i’ve wanted to ever since getting into blockchain but have never set out the time or thought i have the knowledge to add value to the space. since january of this year (2021) i have been pretty much obsessed, following the crypto space full-time learning everything i can about decentralized networks, and trying to think through ideas i think would be valuable in a digitally self-sovereign world. this arguably unhealthy spree has come out of the last year i spent locked up in my London room “studying” architecture during the recent lockdown. between smoking weed, doing calisthenics, and jerking off my in-person life has been remarkably unimpressive, but in terms of personal discovery, and mental mining i think i will look back on it as a big turning point. but anyway who cares, the cool part is is that since I have successfully cut off pretty much any “normie” relationships I had to begin with, I now am able to spent most of my time feeding off crypto twitter and learning code in hopes of helping build a crypto first world with true freedoms and opportunities like I imagined could exist when i first discovered the space.\\n\\nif you somehow end up reading this thank you and good luck. i would say it will be a jumble of my current thoughts around crypto and the potential i can’t unsee in it. i hope this will be the first of my many blog post and something i can build on as i explore the field further. part of the inspiration for this blog is the fact that i am publishing it on a collection of protocols i personally can own a part of and contribute towards building. this aspect alone is significant enough in my mind that it justifies putting something into the space and digitally owning it myself. things i hope to write about in my future posts are the coming “information age” and my other extreme, independently minted conclusions on life, incentivization mechanisms, evolution of trust, and human trust structures. since i haven’t found adequate interest from an in-person human i figure here would be a good place to start dumping those abstractions.\",\"timestamp\":1635433797,\"title\":\"why mirror\"},\"digest\":\"l58-RLDeftEuwKf1_NFvH1IGdskQiuD-3i4BbhFYqr4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xB789adBb6143038c5048fBF4F410c7E69C6Fced6\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"O1lwSfVXxBdE2P8gpKWP4w96LMkBWt1_maRVckskQ30\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"5MlT-XPm3EM7R5fDKwaqmlkKrskcnoSdkIfbKkTED8Y\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"9T7VGQVj-VEzo_OSDN5eY8_kT6WjQu2Q2l0xnDpkkxhAuFRqjppyAkn7DbG_-5pzh8-5xHi1cTD-2bcoQ84GrQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8953c8675d0ff48af55e0b0e3461ffdf223802ae400b2023d29e1316bf59b2aa0d10646203ad3270f5c7b2f66a80e4ec6cb683b074810b245dbc5418fc897b5a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"O1lwSfVXxBdE2P8gpKWP4w96LMkBWt1_maRVckskQ30\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"5MlT-XPm3EM7R5fDKwaqmlkKrskcnoSdkIfbKkTED8Y\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"RyR95wEYNZbiYTzKAs3DuWqRR7TA76CesyRyMabFU0o\"}"
