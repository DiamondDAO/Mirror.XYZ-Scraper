"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"would ever take him for anything but a diminutive thrush; or, studying him from some distance through the opera-glasses as he runs in and out of the little waves along the brook or river shore, would not name him a baby sandpiper? The rather unsteady motion of his legs, balancing of the tail, and sudden jerking of the head suggest an aquatic bird rather than a bird of the woods. But to really know either man or beast, you must follow him to his home, and if you have pluck enough to brave the swamp and the almost impenetrable tangle of undergrowth where the water thrush chooses to nest, there \\\"In the swamp in secluded recesses, a shy and hidden bird is warbling a song;\\\" and this warbled song that Walt Whitman so adored gives you your first clue to the proper classification of the bird. It has nothing in common with the serene, hymn-like voices of the true thrushes; the bird has no flute-like notes, but an emphatic smacking or chucking kind of warble. For a few days only is this song heard about the gardens and roadsides of our country places. Like the Louisiana water thrush, this bird never ventures near the homes of men after the spring and autumn migrations, but, on the contrary, goes as far away from them as possible, preferably to some mountain region, beside a cool and dashing brook, where a party of adventurous young climbers from a summer hotel or the lonely trout fisherman may startle it from its mossy nest on the ground.\\n\\nFLICKER (Colaptes auratus) Woodpecker family\\n\\nCalled also: GOLDEN-WINGED WOODPECKER; CLAPE; PIGEON WOODPECKER;   YELLOWHAMMER; HIGH HOLE OR HIGH-HOLDER; YARUP; WAKE-UP;   YELLOW-SHAFTED WOODPECKER\\n\\nLength -- 12 to 13 inches. About one-fourth as large again as the   robin. Male and Female -- Head and neck bluish gray, with a red crescent   across back of neck and a black crescent on breast. Male has   black cheek-patches, that are wanting in female. Golden brown   shading into brownish-gray, and barred with black above.   Underneath whitish, tinged with light chocolate and thickly   spotted with black. Wing linings, shafts of wing, and tail   quills bright yellow. Above tail white, conspicuous when the   bird flies. Range -- United States, east of Rockies; Alaska and British   America, south of Hudson Bay. Occasional on Pacific slope. Migrations -- Most commonly seen from April to October. Usually   Resident.\\n\\nIf we were to follow the list of thirty-six aliases by which this largest and commonest of our woodpeckers is known throughout its wide range, we should find all its peculiarities of color, flight, noises, and habits indicated in its popular names. It cannot but attract attention wherever seen, with its beautiful plumage, conspicuously yellow if its outstretched wings are looked at from below, conspicuously brown and white if seen upon the ground. At a distance it suggests the meadowlark. Both birds wear black, crescent breast decorations, and the flicker also has the habit of feeding upon the ground, especially in autumn, a characteristic not shared by its relations.\\n\\nEarly in the spring this bird of many names and many voices makes itself known by a long, strong, sonorous call, a sort of proclamation that differs from its song proper, which Audubon. calls \\\"a prolonged jovial laugh\\\" (described by Mrs. Wright as \\\"Wick, wick, wick, wick!\\\") and differs also from its rapidly repeated, mellow, and most musical cub, cub, cub, cub, cub, uttered during the nesting season.\\n\\nIts nasal kee-yer, vigorously called out in the autumn, is less characteristic, however, than the sound it makes while associating with its fellows on the feeding ground -- a sound that Mr. Frank M. Chapman says can be closely imitated by the swishing of a willow wand.\\n\\nA very ardent and ridiculous-looking lover is this bird, as, with tail stiffly spread, he sidles up to his desired mate and bows and bobs before her, then retreats and advances, bowing and bobbing again, very often with a rival lover beside him (whom he generously tolerates) trying to outdo him in grace and general attractiveness. Not the least of the bird's qualities that must commend themselves to the bride is his unfailing good nature, genial alike in the home and in the field.\\n\\nThe \\\"high-holders\\\" have the peculiar and silly habit of boring out a number of superfluous holes for nests high up in the trees, in buildings, or hollow wooden columns, only one of which they intend to use. Six white eggs is the proper number for a household, but Dr. Coues says the female that has been robbed keeps on laying three or even four sets of eggs without interruption.\\n\\nMEADOWLARK (Sturnella magna) Blackbird family\\n\\nCalled also: FIELD LARK; OLDFIELD LARK; \\\\[EASTERN MEADOWLARK, AOU   1998\\\\]\\n\\nLength -- 10 to 11 inches. A trifle larger than the robin. Male -- Upper parts brown, varied with chestnut, deep brown, and   black. Crown streaked with brown and black, and with a   cream-colored streak through the centre. Dark-brown line   apparently running through the eye; another line over eye,   yellow. Throat and chin yellow; a large conspicuous black   crescent on breast. Underneath yellow, shading into buffy   brown, spotted or streaked with very dark brown, Outer tail   feathers chiefly white, conspicuous in flight. Long, strong   legs and claws, adapted for walking. Less black in winter   plumage, which is more grayish brown. Female -- Paler than male. Range -- North America, from Newfoundland to the Gulf of Mexico,   and westward to the plains, where the Western meadowlark takes   its place. Winters from Massachusetts and Illinois southward. Migrations -- April. Late October. Usually a resident, a few   remaining through the winter.\\n\\nIn the same meadows with the red-winged blackbirds, birds of another feather, but of the same family, nevertheless, may be found flocking together, hunting for worms and larvae, building their nests, and rearing their young very near each other with the truly social instinct of all their kin.\\n\\nThe meadowlarks, which are really not larks at all, but the blackbirds' and orioles' cousins, are so protected by the coloring of the feathers on their backs, like that of the grass and stubble they live among, that ten blackbirds are noticed for every meadowlark although the latter is very common. Not until you flush a flock of them as you walk along the roadside or through the meadows and you note the white tail feathers and the black crescents on the yellow breasts of the large brown birds that rise towards the tree-tops with whirring sound and a flight suggesting the quail's, do you suspect there are any birds among the tall grasses.\\n\\nTheir clear and piercing whistle, \\\"Spring o' the y-e-a-r, Spring o' the year!\\\" rings out from the trees with varying intonation and accent, but always sweet and inspiriting. To the bird's high vantage ground you may not follow, for no longer having the protection of the high grass, it has become wary and flies away as you approach, calling out peent-peent and nervously flitting its tail (again showing the white feather), when it rests a moment on the pasture fence-rail.\\n\\nIt is like looking for a needle in a haystack to try to find a meadowlark's nest, an unpretentious structure of dried grasses partly arched over and hidden in a clump of high timothy, flat upon the ground. But what havoc snakes and field-mice play with the white-speckled eggs and helpless fledglings! The care of rearing two or three broods in a season and the change of plumage to duller winter tints seem to exhaust the high spirits of the sweet whistler. For a time he is silent, but partly regains his vocal powers in the autumn, when, with large flocks of his own kind, he resorts to marshy feeding grounds. In the winter he chooses for companions the horned larks, that walk along the shore, or the snow buntings and sparrows of the inland pastures, and will even include the denizens of the barn-yard when hunger drives him close to the haunts of men.\\n\\nThe Western Meadowlark or Prairie Lark (Sturnella magna neglecta), which many ornithologists consider a different species from the foregoing \\\\[as does AOU 1998\\\\], is distinguished chiefly by its lighter, more grayish-brown plumage, by its yellow cheeks, and more especially by its richer, fuller song. In his \\\"Birds of Manitoba\\\" Mr. Ernest E. Thompson says of this meadowlark: \\\"In richness of voice and modulation it equals or excels both wood thrush and nightingale, and in the beauty of its articulation it has no superior in the whole world of feathered choristers with which I am acquainted.\\\"\\n\\nHORNED LARK (Otocoris alpestris) Lark family\\n\\nCalled also: SHORE LARK\\n\\nLength -- 7.5 to 8 inches. About one-fifth smaller than the   robin. Male -- Upper parts dull brown, streaked with lighter on edges   and tinged with pink or vinaceous; darkest on back of head   neck, shoulders, and nearest the tail. A few erectile feathers   on either side of the head form slight tufts or horns that are   wanting in female. A black mark from the base of the bill   passes below the eye and ends in a horn-shaped curve on cheeks,   which are yellow. Throat clear yellow. Breast has crescent   shaped black patch. Underneath soiled white, with dusky spots   on lower breast. Tail black, the outer feathers margined with   white, noticed in flight. Female -- Has yellow eye-stripe; less prominent markings,   especially on head, and is a trifle smaller. Range -- Northeastern parts of North America, and in winter from   Ohio and eastern United States as far south as North Carolina. Migrations -- October and November. March. Winter resident\\n\\nFar away to the north in Greenland and Labrador this true lark, the most beautiful of its genus, makes its summer home. There it is a conspicuously handsome bird with its pinkish-gray and chocolate feathers, that have greatly faded into dull browns when we see them in the late autumn. In the far north only does it sing, and, according to Audubon, the charming song is flung to the breeze while the bird soars like a skylark. In the United States we hear only its call-note.\\n\\nGreat flocks come down the Atlantic coast in October and November, and separate into smaller bands that take up their residence in sandy stretches and open tracts near the sea or wherever the food supply looks promising, and there the larks stay until all the seeds, buds of bushes, berries, larvae, and insects in their chosen territory are exhausted. They are ever conspicuously ground birds, walkers, and when disturbed at their dinner, prefer to squat on the earth rather than expose themselves by flight. Sometimes they run nimbly over the frozen ground to escape an intruder, but flying they reserve as a last resort. When the visitor has passed they quickly return to their dinner. If they were content to eat less ravenously and remain slender, fewer victims might be slaughtered annually to tickle the palates of the epicure. It is a mystery what they find to fatten upon when snow covers the frozen ground. Even in the severe midwinter storms they will not seek the protection of the woods, but always prefer sandy dunes with their scrubby undergrowth or open meadow lands. Occasionally a small flock wanders toward the farms to pick up seeds that are blown from the hayricks or scattered about the barn-yard by overfed domestic fowls.\\n\\nThe Prairie Horned Lark (Otocoris alpestris praticola) is similar to the preceding, but a trifle smaller and paler, with a white instead of a yellow streak above the eye, the throat yellowish or entirely white instead of sulphur-yellow, and other minor differences. It has a far more southerly range, confined to northern portions of the United States from the Mississippi eastward. Once a distinctly prairie bird, it now roams wherever large stretches of open country that suit its purposes are cleared in the East, and remains resident. This species also sings in midair on the wing, but its song is a crude, half-inarticulate affair, barely audible from a height of two hundred feet.\\n\\nAMERICAN PIPIT (Anthus pensilvanicus) Wagtail family\\n\\nCalled also: TITLARK; BROWN OR RED LARK\\n\\nLength -- 6.38 to 7 inches. About the size of a sparrow. Male and Female -- Upper parts brown; wings and tail dark   olive-brown; the wing coverts tipped with buff or whitish, and   ends of outer tail feathers white, conspicuous in flight. White   or yellowish eye-ring, and line above the eye. Underneath light   buff brown, with spots on breast and sides, the under parts   being washed with brown of various shades. Feet brown. Hind   toe-nail as long as or longer than the toe. Range -- North America at large. Winters south of Virginia to   Mexico and beyond. Migrations -- April. October or November. Common in the United   States, chiefly during the migrations.\\n\\nThe color of this bird varies slightly with age and sex, the under parts ranging from white through pale rosy brown to a reddish tinge; but at any season, and under all circumstances, the pipit is a distinctly brown bird, resembling the water thrushes not in plumage only, but in the comical tail waggings and jerkings that alone are sufficient to identify it. However the books may tell us the bird is a wagtail, it certainly possesses two strong characteristics of true larks: it is a walker, delighting in walking or running, never hopping over the ground, and it has the angelic habit of singing as it flies.\\n\\nDuring the migrations the pipits are abundant in salt marshes or open stretches of country inland, that, with lark-like preference, they choose for feeding grounds. When flushed, all the flock rise together with uncertain flight, hovering and wheeling about the place, calling down dee-dee, dee-dee above your head until you have passed on your way, then promptly returning to the spot from whence they were disturbed. Along the roadsides and pastures, where two or three birds are frequently seen together, they are too often mistaken for the vesper sparrows because of their similar size and coloring, but their easy, graceful walk should distinguish them at once from the hopping sparrow. They often run to get ahead of some one in the lane, but rarely fly if they can help it, and then scarcely higher than a fence-rail. Early in summer they are off for the mountains in the north. Labrador is their chosen nesting ground, and they are said to place their grassy nest, lined with lichens or moss, flat upon the ground -- still another lark trait. Their eggs are chocolate-brown scratched with black.\\n\\nWHIPPOORWILL (Antrostomus vociferus) Goatsucker family\\n\\n\\\\[Called also: WHIP-POOR-WILL, AOU 1998\\\\]\\n\\nLength -- 9 to 10 inches. About the size of the robin. Apparently   much larger, because of its long wings and wide wingspread. Male -- A long-winged bird, mottled all over with reddish brown,   grayish black, and dusky white; numerous bristles fringing the   large mouth. A narrow white band across the upper breast. Tail   quills on the end and under side white. Female -- Similar to male, except that the tail is dusky in color   where that of the male is white. Band on breast buff instead of   white. Range -- United States, to the plains. Not common near the sea. Migrations -- Late April to middle of September. Summer resident.\\n\\nThe whippoorwill, because of its nocturnal habits and plaintive note, is invested with a reputation for occult power which inspires a chilling awe among superstitious people, and leads them insanely to attribute to it an evil influence; but it is a harmless, useful night prowler, flying low and catching enormous numbers of hurtful insects, always the winged varieties, in its peculiar fly-trap mouth.\\n\\nIt loves the rocky, solitary woods, where it sleeps all day; but it is seldom seen, even after painstaking search, because of its dull, mottled markings conforming so nearly to rocks and dry leaves, and because of its unusual habit of stretching itself length-wise on a tree branch or ledge, where it is easily confounded with a patch of lichen, and thus overlooked. If by accident one happens upon a sleeping bird, it suddenly rouses and flies away, making no more sound than a passing butterfly -- a curious and uncanny silence that is quite remarkable. When the sun goes down and as the gloaming deepens, the bird's activity increases, and it begins its nightly duties, emitting from time to time, like a sentry on his post or a watchman of the night, the doleful call which has given the bird its common name. It\\n\\n```\\n \\\"Mourns unseen, and ceaseless sings       Ever a note of wail and woe,\\\"\\n```\\n\\nthat our Dutch ancestors interpreted as \\\"Quote-kerr-kee,\\\" and so called it. They had a tradition that no frost ever appeared after the bird had been heard calling in the spring, and that it wisely left for warmer skies before frost came in the autumn. Prudent bird, never caught napping!\\n\\nIt is erratic in its choice of habitations, even when rock and solitude seem suited to its taste. Very rarely is this odd bird found close to the seashore, and in the Hudson River valley it keeps a half mile or more back from the river.\\n\\nThe eggs, generally two in number, are creamy white, dashed with dark and olive spots, and laid on the ground on dry leaves, or in a little hollow in rock or stump -- never in a nest built with loving care. But in extenuation of such carelessness it may be said that, if disturbed or threatened, the mother shows no lack of maternal instinct, and removes her young, carrying them in her beak as a cat conveys her kittens to secure shelter.\\n\\nNIGHTHAWK (Chordeiles virginianus) Goatsucker family\\n\\nCalled also: NIGHTJAR; BULL-BAT; MOSQUITO HAWK; WILL-O'-THE-WISP;   PISK; PIRAMIDIG; LONGWINGED GOATSUCKER; \\\\[COMMON NIGHTHAWK, AOU   1998\\\\]\\n\\nLength -- 9 to 10 inches. About the same length as the robin, but   apparently much longer because of its very wide wing-spread. Male and Female -- Mottled blackish brown and rufous above, with   a multitude of cream-yellow spots and dashes. Lighter below,   with waving bars of brown on breast and underneath. White mark   on throat, like an imperfect horseshoe; also a band of white   across tail of male bird. These latter markings are wanting in   female. Heavy wings, which are partly mottled, are brown on   shoulders and tips, and longer than tail. They have large white   spots, conspicuous in flight, one of their distinguishing marks    from the whippoorwill. Head large and depressed, with large   eyes and ear-openings. Very small bill. Range -- From Mexico to arctic islands. Migrations -- May. October. Common summer resident.\\n\\nThe nighthawk's misleading name could not well imply more that the bird is not: it is not nocturnal in its habits, neither is it a hawk, for if it were, no account of it would be given in this book, which distinctly excludes birds of prey. Stories of its chicken-stealing prove to be ignorant rather than malicious slanders. Any one disliking the name, however, surely cannot complain of a limited choice of other names by which, in different sections of the country, it is quite as commonly known.\\n\\nToo often it is mistaken for the whippoorwill. The night hawk does not have the weird and woful cry of that more dismal bird, but gives instead a harsh, whistling note while on the wing, followed by a vibrating, booming, whirring sound that Nuttall likens to \\\"the rapid turning of a spinning wheel, or a strong blowing into the bung-hole of an empty hogshead.\\\" This peculiar sound is responsible for the name nightjar, frequently given to this curious bird. It is said to be made as the bird drops suddenly through the air, creating a sort of stringed instrument of its outstretched wings and tail. When these wings are spread, their large white spots running through the feathers to the under side should be noted to further distinguish the nighthawk from the whippoorwill, which has none, but which it otherwise closely resembles. This booming sound, coming from such a height that the bird itself is often unseen, was said by the Indians to be made by the shad spirits to warn the scholes of shad about to ascend the rivers to spawn in the spring, of their impending fate.\\n\\nThe flight of the nighthawk is free and graceful in the extreme. Soaring through space without any apparent motion of its wings, suddenly it darts with amazing swiftness like an erratic bat after the fly, mosquito, beetle, or moth that falls within the range of its truly hawk-like eye.\\n\\nUsually the nighthawks hunt in little companies in the most sociable fashion. Late in the summer they seem to be almost gregarious. They fly in the early morning or late afternoon with beak wide open, hawking for insects, but except when the moon is full they are not known to go a-hunting after sunset. During the heat of the day and at night they rest on limbs of trees, fence-rails, stone walls, lichen-covered rocks or old logs -- wherever Nature has provided suitable mimicry of their plumage to help conceal them.\\n\\nWith this object in mind, they quite as often choose a hollow surface of rock in some waste pasture or the open ground on which to deposit the two speckled-gray eggs that sixteen days later will give birth to their family. But in August, when family cares have ended for the season, it is curious to find this bird of the thickly wooded country readily adapting itself to city life, resting on Mansard roofs, darting into the streets from the housetops, and wheeling about the electric lights, making a hearty supper of the little, winged insects they attract.\\n\\nBLACK-BILLED CUCKOO (Coccyzus erythrophthalmus) Cuckoo family\\n\\nCalled also: RAIN CROW\\n\\nLength -- 11 to 12 inches. About one-fifth larger than the robin. Male -- Grayish brown above, with bronze tint in feathers.   Underneath grayish white; bill, which is long as head and   black, arched and acute. Skin about the eye bright red. Tail   long, and with spots on tips of quills that are small and   inconspicuous. Female -- Has obscure dusky bars on the tail. Range -- Labrador to Panama; westward to Rocky Mountains. Migration -- May. September. Summer resident.\\n\\n```\\n \\\"O cuckoo! shalt I call thee bird?       Or but a wandering voice?\\\"\\n```\\n\\nFrom the tangled shrubbery on the hillside back of Dove Cottage, Keswick, where Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy listened for the coming of this \\\"darling of the spring\\\"; in the willows overhanging Shakespeare's Avon; from the favorite haunts of Chaucer and Spenser, where\\n\\n```\\n \\\"Runneth meade and springeth blede,\\\"\\n```\\n\\nwe hear the cuckoo calling; but how many on this side of the Atlantic are familiar with its American counterpart? Here, too, the cuckoo delights in running water and damp, cloudy weather like that of an English spring; it haunts the willows by our river-sides, where as yet no \\\"immortal bard\\\" arises to give it fame. It \\\"loud sings\\\" in our shrubbery, too. Indeed, if we cannot study our bird afield, the next best place to become acquainted with it is in the pages of the English poets. But due allowance must be made for differences of temperament. Our cuckoo is scarcely a \\\"merry harbinger\\\"; his talents, such as they are, certainly are not musical. However, the guttural cluck is not discordant, and the black-billed species, at least, has a soft, mellow voice that seems to indicate an embryonic songster.\\n\\n\\\"K-k-k-k, kow-kow-ow-kow-ow!\\\" is a familiar sound in many localities, but the large. slim,, pigeon-shaped, brownish-olive bird that makes it, securely hidden in the low trees and shrubs that are its haunts, is not often personally known. Catching a glimpse only of the grayish-white under parts from where we stand looking up into the tree at it, it is quite impossible to tell the bird from the yellow-billed species. When, as it flies about, we are able to note the red circles about its eyes, its black bill, and the absence of black tail feathers, with their white \\\"thumb-nail\\\" spots, and see no bright cinnamon feathers on the wings (the yellow-billed specie's distinguishing marks), we can at last claim acquaintance with the black-billed cuckoo. Our two common cuckoos are so nearly alike that they are constantly confused in the popular mind and very often in the writings of ornithologists. At first glance the birds look alike. Their haunts are almost identical; their habits are the same; and, as they usually keep well out of sight, it is not surprising if confusion arise.\\n\\nNeither cuckoo knows how to build a proper home; a bunch of sticks dropped carelessly into the bush, where the hapless babies that emerge from the greenish eggs will not have far to fall when they tumble out of bed, as they must inevitably do, may by courtesy only be called a nest. The cuckoo is said to suck the eggs of other birds; but, surely, such vice is only the rarest dissipation. Insects of many kinds and \\\"tent caterpillars\\\" chiefly are their chosen food.\\n\\nYELLOW-BILLED CUCKOO (Coccyzus americanus) Cuckoo family\\n\\nCalled also: RAIN CROW\\n\\nLength -- 11 to 12 inches. About one-fifth longer than the robin. Male and Female -- Grayish brown above, with bronze tint in   feathers. Underneath grayish white. Bill, which is as tong as   head, arched, acute, and more robust than the black-billed   species, and with lower mandible yellow. Wings washed with   bright cinnamon-brown. Tail has outer quills black,   conspicuously marked with white thumb-nail spots. Female larger. Range -- North America, from Mexico to Labrador. Most common in temperate climates. Rare on Pacific slope. Migrations -- Late April. September. Summer resident.\\n\\n\\\"Kak, k-kuh, k-kuk, k-kuk!\\\" like an exaggerated tree-toad's rattle, is a sound that, when first heard, makes you rush out of doors instantly to \\\"name\\\" the bird. Look for him in the depths of the tall shrubbery or low trees, near running water, if there is any in the neighborhood, and if you are more fortunate than most people, you will presently become acquainted with the yellow-billed cuckoo. When seen perching at a little distance, his large, slim body, grayish brown, with olive tints above and whitish below, can scarcely be distinguished from that of the black-billed species. It is not until you get close enough to note the yellow bill, reddish-brown wings, and black tail feathers with their white \\\"thumb-nail\\\" marks, that you know which cuckoo you are watching. In repose the bird looks dazed or stupid, but as it darts about among the trees after insects, noiselessly slipping to another one that promises better results, and hopping along the limbs after performing a series of beautiful evolutions among the branches as it hunts for its favorite \\\"tent caterpillars,\\\" it appears what it really is: an unusually active, graceful, intelligent bird.\\n\\nA solitary wanderer, nevertheless one cuckoo in an apple orchard is worth a hundred robins in ridding it of caterpillars and inch-worms, for it delights in killing many more of these than it can possibly eat. In the autumn it varies its diet with minute fresh-water shellfish from the swamp and lake. Mulberries, that look so like caterpillars the bird possibly likes them on that account, it devours wholesale.\\n\\nFamily cares rest lightly on the cuckoos. The nest of both species is a ramshackle affair -- a mere bundle of twigs and sticks without a rim to keep the eggs from rolling from the bush, where they rest, to the ground. Unlike their European relative, they have the decency to rear their own young and not impose this heavy task on others; but the cuckoos on both sides of the Atlantic are most erratic and irregular in their nesting habits. The overworked mother-bird often lays an egg while brooding over its nearly hatched companion, and the two or three half-grown fledglings already in the nest may roll the large greenish eggs out upon the ground, while both parents are off searching for food to quiet their noisy clamorings. Such distracting mismanagement in the nursery is enough to make a homeless wanderer of any father. It is the mother-bird that tumbles to the ground at your approach from sheer fright; feigns lameness, trails her wings as she tries to entice you away from the nest. The male bird shows far less concern; a no more devoted father, we fear, than he is a lover. It is said he changes his mate every year.\\n\\nAltogether, the cuckoo is a very different sort of bird from what our fancy pictured. The little Swiss creatures of wood that fly out of the doors of clocks and call out the bed-hour to sleepy children, are chiefly responsible for the false impressions of our mature years. The American bird does not repeat its name, and its harsh, grating \\\"kuk, kuk,\\\" does not remotely suggest the sweet voice of its European relative.\\n\\nBANK SWALLOW (Clivicola riparia) Swallow family\\n\\nCalled also: SAND MARTIN; SAND SWALLOW\\n\\nLength -- 5 to 5.5 inches. About an inch shorter than the English   sparrow, but apparently much larger because of its wide   wing-spread. Male and Female -- Grayish brown or clay-colored above. Upper   wings and tail darkest. Below, white, with brownish band   across chest. Tail, which is rounded and more nearly square   than the other swallows, is obscurely edged with white. Range -- Throughout North America south of Hudson Bay. Migrations -- April. October. Summer resident.\\n\\nWhere a brook cuts its way through a sand bank to reach the sea is an ideal nesting ground for a colony of sand martins. The face of the high bank shows a number of clean, round holes indiscriminately bored into the sand, as if the place had just received a cannonading; but instead of war an atmosphere of peace pervades the place in midsummer, when you are most likely to visit it. Now that the young ones have flown from their nests that your arm can barely reach through the tunnelled sand or clay, there can be little harm in examining the feathers dropped from gulls, ducks, and other water-birds with which the grassy home is lined.\\n\\nThe bank swallow's nest, like the kingfisher's, which it resembles, is his home as well. There he rests when tired of flying about in pursuit of insect food. Perhaps a bird that has been resting in one of the tunnels, startled by your innocent housebreaking, will fly out across your face, near enough for you to see how unlike the other swallows he is: smaller, plainer, and with none of their glinting steel-blues and buffs about him. With strong, swift flight he rejoins his fellows, wheeling, skimming, darting through the air above you, and uttering his characteristic \\\"giggling twitter,\\\" that is one of the cheeriest noises heard along the beach. In early October vast numbers of these swallows may be seen in loose flocks along the Jersey coast, slowly making their way South. Clouds of them miles in extent are recorded.\\n\\nClosely associated with the sand martin is the Rough-winged Swallow (Stelgidopteryx serripennis), not to be distinguished from its companion on the wing, but easily recognized by its dull-gray throat and the absence of the brown breast-band when seen at close range.\\n\\nCEDAR BIRD (Ampelis cedrorum) Waxwing family\\n\\nCalled also: CEDAR WAXWING \\\\[AOU 1998\\\\]; CHERRY-BIRD; CANADA ROBIN; RECOLLET\\n\\nLength -- 7 to 8 inches. About one-fifth smaller than the robin. Male -- Upper parts rich grayish brown, with plum-colored tints   showing through the brown on crest, throat, breast, wings, and   tail. A velvety-black line on forehead runs through the eye and   back of crest. Chin black; crest conspicuous; breast lighter   than the back, and shading into yellow underneath. Wings have   quill-shafts of secondaries elongated, and with brilliant   vermilion tips like drops of sealing-wax, rarely seen on tail   quills, which have yellow bands across the end. Female -- With duller plumage, smaller crest, and narrower    tail-band. Range -- North America, from northern British provinces to   Central America in winter. Migrations -- A roving resident, without fixed seasons for   migrating.\\n\\nAs the cedar birds travel about in great flocks that quickly exhaust their special food in a neighborhood, they necessarily lead a nomadic life -- here to-day, gone to-morrow -- and, like the Arabs, they \\\"silently steal away.\\\" It is surprising how very little noise so great a company of these birds make at any time. That is because they are singularly gentle and refined; soft of voice, as they are of color, their plumage suggesting a fine Japanese water-color painting on silk, with its beautiful sheen and exquisitely blended tints.\\n\\nOne listens in vain for a song; only a lisping \\\"Twee-twee-ze,\\\" or \\\"a dreary whisper,\\\" as Minot calls their low-toned communications with each other, reaches our ears from their high perches in the cedar trees, where they sit, almost motionless hours at a time, digesting the enormous quantities of juniper and whortleberries, wild cherries, worms, and insects upon which they have gormandized.\\n\\nNuttall gives the cedar birds credit for excessive politeness to each other. He says he has often seen them passing a worm from one to another down a whole row of beaks and back again before it was finally eaten.\\n\\nWhen nesting time arrives -- that is to say, towards the end of the summer -- they give up their gregarious habits and live in pairs, billing and kissing like turtle-doves in the orchard or wild crabtrees, where a flat, bulky nest is rather carelessly built of twigs, grasses, feathers, strings -- any odds and ends that may be lying about. The eggs are usually four, white tinged with purple and spotted with black.\\n\\nApparently they have no moulting season; their plumage is always the same, beautifully neat and full-feathered. Nothing ever hurries or flusters them, their greatest concern apparently being, when they alight, to settle themselves comfortably between their over-polite friends, who are never guilty of jolting or crowding. Few birds care to take life so easily, not to say indolently.\\n\\nAmong the French Canadians they are called Recollet, from the color of their crest resembling the hood of the religious order of that name. Every region the birds pass through, local names appear to be applied to them, a few of the most common of which are given above.\\n\\nOf the three waxwings known to scientists, two are found in America, and the third in Japan,\\n\\nBROWN CREEPER (Certhia familiaris americana) Creeper family\\n\\nLength -- 5 to 5.75 inches. A little smaller than the English   sparrow. Male and Female -- Brown above, varied with ashy-gray stripes and   small, lozenge-shaped gray mottles. Color lightest on head,   increasing in shade to reddish brown near tail. Tail paler   brown and long; wings brown and barred with whitish. Beneath   grayish white. Slender, curving bill. Range -- United States and Canada, east of Rocky Mountains. Migrations -- April. September. Winter resident\\n\\nThis little brown wood sprite, the very embodiment of virtuous diligence, is never found far from the nuthatches, titmice, and kinglets, though not strictly in their company, for he is a rather solitary bird. Possibly he repels them by being too exasperatingly conscientious.\\n\\nBeginning at the bottom of a rough-barked tree (for a smooth bark conceals no larvae, the creeper silently climbs upward in a sort of spiral, now lost to sight on the opposite side of the tree, then reappearing just where he is expected to, flitting back a foot or two, perhaps, lest he overlooked a single spider egg, but never by any chance leaving a tree until conscience approves of his thoroughness. And yet with all this painstaking workman's care, it takes him just about fifty seconds to finish a tree. Then off he flits to the base of another, to repeat the spiral process. Only rarely does he adopt the woodpecker process of partly flitting, partly rocking his way with the help of his tail straight up one side of the tree.\\n\\nYet this little bird is not altogether the soulless drudge he appears. In the midst of his work, uncheered by summer sunshine, and clinging with numb toes to the tree-trunk some bitter cold day, he still finds some tender emotion within him to voice in a \\\"wild, sweet song\\\" that is positively enchanting at such a time. But it is not often this song is heard south of his nesting grounds.\\n\\nThe brown creeper's plumage is one of Nature's most successful feats of mimicry -- an exact counterfeit in feathers of the brown-gray bark on which the bird lives. And the protective coloring is carried out in the nest carefully tucked under a piece of loosened bark in the very heart of the tree.\\n\\nPINE SISKIN (Spinus pinus) Finch family\\n\\nCalled also: PINE FINCH; PINE LINNET\\n\\nLength -- 4.75 to 5 inches. Over an inch smaller than the English   sparrow. Male and Female -- Olive-brown and gray above, much streaked and   striped with very dark brown everywhere. Darkest on head and   back. Lower back, base of tail, and wing feathers pale   sulphur-yellow. Under parts very light buff brown, heavily   streaked. Range -- North America generally. Most common in north latitudes.   Winters south to the Gulf of Mexico. Migrations -- Erratic winter visitor from October to April.   Uncommon in summer.\\n\\nA small grayish-brown brindle bird, relieved with touches of yellow on its back, wings, and tail, may be seen some winter morning roving on the lawn from one evergreen tree to another, clinging to the pine cones and peering attentively between the scales before extracting the kernels. It utters a call-note so like the English sparrow's that you are surprised when you look up into the tree to find it comes from a stranger. The pine siskin is an erratic visitor, and there is always the charm of the unexpected about its coming near our houses that heightens our enjoyment of its brief stay.\\n\\nAs it flies downward from the top of the spruce tree to feed upon the brown seeds still clinging to the pigweed and goldenrod stalks sticking out above the snow by the roadside, it dips and floats through the air like its charming little cousin, the goldfinch. They have several characteristics in common besides their flight and their fondness for thistles. Far at the north, where the pine siskin nests in the top of the evergreens, his sweet-warbled  love-song is said to be like that of our \\\"wild canary's,\\\" only with a suggestion of fretfulness in the tone.\",\"timestamp\":1641275107,\"title\":\"\\nAccording to the books we have before us, a warbler; but who, to look at his speckled throat and breast\"},\"digest\":\"jjI_isan5oz-x7lkcyywKcWhEN3GnuQ2PYeQq5932v4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x19BebfD5a2946bC50A2CeA661e77fFC2F12C9549\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hCR4EYQcwS-Qi243m0BzMBcVlAu0IQmGdSQXlg-iqpc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ozgvJaL0gnZc6kFSyiYvmnjPi6ixgh5Z6a8pGkkpj5w\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"4T3g8stzUkaI6gtcsmNGiB993GMCP5SbuQIKq2l-4UdeDzztzVA71oEisyynPcEjJC0MRwCAZajJ3EL_nsdH-A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4deca71e6d56cd25af52c7dbc88b9aa927ebcd9949a5dc5fc9a54d05d174de4b0c9c51cb6772980ba3968402abb1fe3456c28df6f774ac59196d3ff7726d221b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hCR4EYQcwS-Qi243m0BzMBcVlAu0IQmGdSQXlg-iqpc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ozgvJaL0gnZc6kFSyiYvmnjPi6ixgh5Z6a8pGkkpj5w\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jjI_isan5oz-x7lkcyywKcWhEN3GnuQ2PYeQq5932v4\"}"
