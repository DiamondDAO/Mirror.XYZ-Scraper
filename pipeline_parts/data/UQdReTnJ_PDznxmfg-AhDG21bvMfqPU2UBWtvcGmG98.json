"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Bitcoin (BTC) is holding support above its 100-day moving average, which is currently at $53,700. The cryptocurrency was trading around $57,000 at press time and could see further upside toward the $60,000 resistance level over the short term.\\n\\nThe relative strength index ([RSI](https://cmtassociation.org/kb/relative-strength-index-rsi/)) on the daily chart is almost oversold, similar to what occurred in late-July and September, which preceded near-50% price rallies. Still, buyers will need to break above the $60,000-$65,000 resistance zone in order to yield upside price targets.\\n\\nPrice momentum is slowing on the daily chart, although initial signs of downside exhaustion could stabilize the intermediate-term uptrend from July. Volatility will likely return into the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, which could lead to sharp price movements over the weekend.\",\"timestamp\":1637806148,\"title\":\"Bitcoin Held Support at $53K, Faces Initial Resistance Around $60K\"},\"digest\":\"Mt-O9izDk_0RNhPu_KGvu2TSk0J2IS_fsmm6dLbQYOI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x08DB79911BB3215CA7406e2B4Df23348Ea33915A\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZNjsXsEtWufGxIMQnAIvuGQ9g0jMRGybUfwZzFWMC2k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gLfMsVveVwPlGzXO6qO-pHOI4w6n0nuBihs4SyGtZ_0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"jDEviQnzZvX7lsbtmqWHhcCRU1aTdBHwFaoBc0xE2w157vxckHNXXZhTLM7iV0dk1Fjkofz-NT89FRFljOkIow\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xde33e28cbe182f3a118d24afe1c92c41148efa2da570c470677d4f8aebd0772d19b03972e4577b9c327c1f16f4a8892bff1161c4e6c2e0c7c5b3f8d436a35d951c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZNjsXsEtWufGxIMQnAIvuGQ9g0jMRGybUfwZzFWMC2k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gLfMsVveVwPlGzXO6qO-pHOI4w6n0nuBihs4SyGtZ_0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Mt-O9izDk_0RNhPu_KGvu2TSk0J2IS_fsmm6dLbQYOI\"}"
