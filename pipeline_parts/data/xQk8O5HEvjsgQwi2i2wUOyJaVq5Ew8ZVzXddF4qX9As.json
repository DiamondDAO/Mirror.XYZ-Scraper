"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The goal of this blog is one degree of separation.  Every topic and piece will be one degree separated from any other if not explicitly referencing the other.  All ideas are the formation of some generic building blocks and everything is connected.  Through this blog, I will post random ideas, thoughts, and mental models.  My goal is to keep everything short and succinct.  Each post will tackle 1 main idea although I may go off on tangents.  Ideas may be inherited from past pieces or expanded on in future pieces.  I might go back and edit old post or post updates if I think I am wrong as well.  One degree of separation is the key as there is more benefit to connected ideas than solitary ones.  We live in a complex system where everything is interconnected whether you can see that or not, so approaching this as a great web of interconnected ideas will be more applicable and all posts will layer past ideas onto each other as we go from basic mental models to more complex organizations and ideas. \\n\\nThese ideas are a summation of everything that has happened to me up until this point, and I am not going to explicitly reference sources and quote scientific facts often.  The goal is not to spread misinformation or ideas highly unlikely to be true, but to make claims based on available information and common sense without the need to unequivocally prove a statement.  Some may consider this unscientific, which it is, but there is a lot of science that people spend years studying only to produce a common-sense answer or worse a wrong one.  Here we will skip that process and just toss ideas out there which are not 100% correct, but hopefully a working picture.  Additionally, a lot of scientific paradigms through the ages ie all the ones not currently accepted have taken lifetimes of study just to be partly or wholly wrong, so were really just throwing shit at the wall as a species in a lot of places.  We write long white papers in order to justify that we are not, but given our track record we have to assume we are.  We will have to balance accepted paradigms with novel and unproven ideas and discern where the bullshit is and where the truth may lie.  Importantly each post is just my idea at one point in time which could change with further contemplation or more information.  If there are stronger arguments for the opposite ideas then the ideas will be forced to change.\\n\\nI am doing this to express my ideas to myself and hopefully get some engagement, so we can adjust our thinking toward a better truth.  In formulating these posts, I get to chew on ideas more and express them to myself first then put them out as v1 drafts to be further engaged with and updated.  The mission is to deepen understanding of interesting topics for anyone who engages.  I am not a professional nor very good writer.  This is meant to be a candid conversation with all who engage.  The goal is to form a small and dynamic community that not only engage with posts, but also creates content and encourages the creation and promotion of ideas from the community.  However, if it’s just me yelling in the abyss, even fucking better. \\n\\nTo quote the great poet Sturgill Simpson, “There's a gateway in our mind that leads somewhere out there far beyond this plane.   Where reptile aliens made of light cut you open and pull out all your pain.” This is the stupidest and most profound thought and that will be a goal here; thought provoking ideas that push the boundaries of sensibility.  My view is that progress happens from the craziest people willing to take the biggest risks with their ideas.  Most of these people are deemed unfit for society in one way or another, but throughout history these crazy people have challenged the status quo and this has resulted in immense progress and a lot of garbage too to be fair.  This will be a place where serious ideas are taken seriously in the most candid and lighthearted way possible and crazy is not encouraged but needed.  If we are to make any serious progress, we’re going to have to entertain all 3 standard deviation ideas with open arms and an open mind.  We are all just 5 year olds with respect to a novel idea and acting 10x older is not gonna make us any smarter.  We need to crouch down and meet those ideas at their level, not taking them or ourselves too seriously, nurturing them as they become more mature versions of their original selves.  The goal here is to learn and grow.  We are all just kids in adults’ clothes, so we’re going to bring that curious attitude to different concepts and dissect them.  There are no wrong answers and all ideas are encouraged in good faith.  We are constantly learning and growing.  We can be very wrong for a very long time but the second we reverse a 20 year belief to become right based on a different and more nuanced version of the arguments on both sides is the time we ascend to another plane of intelligence.  Hold ideas lightly and expect to be wrong, but have measured conviction based on your knowledge of the facts and earn the right to hold complex viewpoints. \\n\",\"timestamp\":1638482315,\"title\":\"The Mission Statement and Goal\"},\"digest\":\"FucDQtP35cllo9QP1Rt2uIkUtcfKZDRzW8C-OOBQFUs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9fA5F0553864C1789362DCE77F4B7e8Fa5631953\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bKV3wxUBlh1g1HpUy0vc-YUWCI-V4RN8aMpDCmqPQPk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KrAuUcPMducWZsrjog1nDks5de1kYx7rJoEYhevG08I\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"PaDzpv822pb2EoV6mWv4xXpdibNQB9nRNFKa4c108UY4eItydL3aBFKtxtU8syWUysk5jheS0E1AhXyVtYhSmw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb22d5d7bfee8b22ebc14b89bd606f1b119c36a3dd0c2bc3f7ae288b55551ab3642162eb3c3765f43d75f90089b1ccbcc7986b64e0a107d4519362d885da1a6901b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bKV3wxUBlh1g1HpUy0vc-YUWCI-V4RN8aMpDCmqPQPk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KrAuUcPMducWZsrjog1nDks5de1kYx7rJoEYhevG08I\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"FucDQtP35cllo9QP1Rt2uIkUtcfKZDRzW8C-OOBQFUs\"}"
