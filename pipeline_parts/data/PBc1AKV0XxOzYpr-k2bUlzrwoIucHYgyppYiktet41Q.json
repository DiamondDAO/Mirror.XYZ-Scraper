Today, in the rapid development of the blockchain, we have seen that there are many outstanding developers in this industry with stories of mismatched resources or funding.*\\n\\n*These founders require trusted partners, mentors and capital at an early stage and IOSG. IOSG aims to be this trusted partner for founders & developers and bridge the gap.*\\n\\nIn efforts to do that, today we launch the IOSG Kickstarter Program. The program will provide mentorship & capital to early stage developers in the Web 3.0 ecosystem.We have joined forces with **DeFi Alliance, NEAR, Synthetix, 1inch Network, imToken, DODO, OWC, Celer Network, ECN, ChainSafe, OpenDeFi, Impossible Finance, DAOSquare, EEA,Oasis Labs, Avalanche, Longhash Ventures, Flux, Commonwealth Labs, and other projects and organizations**, to provide comprehensive support for outstanding early-stage development entrepreneurs. This includes technology development, product building, community building, talent introduction, etc. **Teams that pass the Kickstarter screening will receive $10,000 to $100,000 in funding support!**\\n\\n**Your Vision, Our Mission!**\\n\\nWhat differentiates YC from other incubators & accelerators is the quality of their mentors who are all ex-founders and understand what it takes to build successful companies. Similarly, with our experienced group of partners and mentors, we hope to achieve the following with the program:\\n\\n1. **Help potential developers and projects** create products and truly focus on adding value to the Web3.0 ecosystem & its users.\\n2. **Foster multi-chain ecosystem** and incubating projects on different public chains.\\n3. **Educate and promote** the use of Web3.0 applications.\\n\\n**üëá If you are üëá**\\n\\nBlockchain developer or early-stage project with ambitious vision and innovative ideas to build something that will benefit the blockchain space\\n\\n**Please click [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-NXcdnnPi3Plh40ha6rosin5ZmYcH1uudzJOZwJtw42Z3LQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to apply!**\\n\\n**About the program**\\n\\nThe Kickstarter Program is an initiative to provide mentorship and capital support to early stage developers in the Web3.0 ecosystem.
