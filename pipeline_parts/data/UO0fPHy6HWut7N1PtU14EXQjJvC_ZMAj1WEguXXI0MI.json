"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"● Few currency holding addresses, concentrated currency holdings, mainly large accounts\\n\\n● The number of transfers is small, and the amount of a single transfer is very high\\n\\n● The amount of funds is concentrated in Ethereum, but users and behaviors are more active on Fantom and Arbitrum\\n\\nCombined with Curve's MIM data, we will find that Curve is currently the main destination for MIM stablecoins. About 45% of MIM on Ethereum is market-making on Curve, and about 38% of MIM on Arbitrum is market-making on Curve.\\n\\nUnlike other stablecoins that interact with various DeFi protocols mainly in the relationship between asset deposits and market making, Abracadabra has a deeper integration with several major DeFi protocols in terms of product mechanism and asset portfolio. For example, it uses a large number of Yearn interest-bearing assets as The collateral uses Sushi’s Kashi lending engine, directly integrates the cross-chain bridge Anyswap, and also supports the interest-bearing assets of Curve’s market making and pledge service platform Convex as collateral, and so on.\\n\\nIn addition to these large-scale mainstream DeFi, the assets it supports are the tokenization protocol of future earnings, Alchemix's token ALUSD, and Fantom's token FTM.\\n\\nIncorporating interest-bearing assets, other DeFi protocol tokens, and new public chain tokens into the scope of collateral, on the one hand, can bring accurate DeFi projects and users of the new public chain to Abracadabra, and support the rapid growth of its business; on the other hand, it also Amplifying its risks, especially at the smart contract level, the integration of a large number of external DeFi protocols not only increases the complexity of the DeFi Lego portfolio, but the security risks of these external protocols will also penetrate into the Abracadabra system.\\n\\nIt is worth mentioning that Abracadabra has received strong support from AC-related projects, such as Curve (Yearn holds a large amount of veCRV and has a great say in the distribution of CRV liquidity incentives), Fantom, and so on.\",\"timestamp\":1634579687,\"title\":\"What are the characteristics of MIM?\"},\"digest\":\"p_DbT44QPOGO0JeSnJnjaYqgRtnwN10fgCO8s8o5Hpc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x98830d669aE53c947eA158A34e77FeE0CC4C3f01\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MtHLj3wpgeBQ6MVBGTyZ6cuk2BG4LqTkoJJjq0lyu7M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YHBO0rSmFtr13_KOuwIiAMRDw3uYsY8VBSnKQkAaJ_Y\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"4Dn9mYkKoTlwMHGnDjwToUy5OFItHfSUekwrl4F917219vh9cC7Oh4bO27kEBZkvkUDQV8ggNpzYJkfl6o9OqQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb0c9a171eb6a88bc16c044bf4977fe71cc01893dc2b39f40761d53182d51d21e7be52b0fdae821f45249a828865fcb6b2246ef6ad286282c63a2bdb783309b4b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MtHLj3wpgeBQ6MVBGTyZ6cuk2BG4LqTkoJJjq0lyu7M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YHBO0rSmFtr13_KOuwIiAMRDw3uYsY8VBSnKQkAaJ_Y\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"p_DbT44QPOGO0JeSnJnjaYqgRtnwN10fgCO8s8o5Hpc\"}"
