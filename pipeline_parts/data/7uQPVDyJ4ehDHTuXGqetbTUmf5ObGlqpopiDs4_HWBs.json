"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Asuncion on October 10, 1609, and arrived in February, 1610, on the banks of the river Paranapane.\\\\*\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Paranapane = the White Parana, or, according to others,   the Parana without fish. --\\n\\nThere they met the Indians amongst whom Fields and Ortega had begun to labour, and there they founded the Reduction\\\\* of Loreto, the first permanent establishment instituted by the Jesuits amongst the Guaranis.  Thus, in the woods of Paraguay, upon a tributary of the Parana but little known even to-day, did the Society of Jesus lay the first foundation of their famous missions. But little more than fifty years from the foundation of their Order, thus had they penetrated to what was then, and is perchance to-day, after their missions all are ruined, one of the remotest corners of the world.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Reduction (\\\\`reduccion') was the Spanish name for a missionary establishment. --\\n\\nThere they built up the system with which their name is linked for ever -- the system which for two hundred years was able to hold together wandering Indian tribes, restless as Arabs, suspicious above every other race of men -- and which to-day has disappeared, leaving nothing of a like nature in all the world.\\n\\nChapter II\\n\\nEarly days of the missions -- New settlements founded --   Relations of Jesuits with Indians and Spanish colonists --   Destruction of missions by the Mamelucos -- Father Maceta --   Padre Antonio Ruiz de Montoya -- His work and influence --   Retreat of the Jesuits down the Parana\\n\\nIt does not seem doubtful but that the work done by Fathers Ortega and Filds\\\\* had borne some fruit.  Perhaps not quite after the fashion that the Jesuits believed; but when Maceta and Cataldino arrived at Guayra and founded the Reduction of Loreto, their success at first was of a nature that almost justified the epithet \\\\`miraculous', an epithet which indeed all men apply to any enterprise of theirs which meets success.  Almost from the first inception of the missions, the Jesuits found themselves in the strange position of, though being hated by the Spanish settlers, yet recurred to as mediators when any of the wild tribes proved too powerful for the Spanish arms.  Thus, far from cities, far from even such elementary civilization as Paraguay should show, almost upon the edge of the great cataract of the Parana, the Jesuits founded their first reduction; to which the Indians flocked in such numbers that a second was soon necessary, to which they gave the name of San Ignacio, in memory of the founder of their rule.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Some of the Spanish writers refer to Filds as Padre Tom Filds.   His real name was Fields, and he was a Scotchman. --\\n\\nFor the first few years all went well with the Jesuits.  The Indians, happy to escape the persecutions of the Spaniards on the one hand, and the incursions of the Paulistas\\\\* on the other, flocked to the reductions, mission after mission was soon formed, and the wild Indians gathered up into townships and taught the arts of peace. But though the Guaranis at first entered into the Jesuit reductions as a refuge against their persecutors, the Portuguese and Spaniards, soon, as was only natural to men accustomed to a wild forest life, they found the Jesuit discipline too irksome, and often fled back to the woods.  Then the poor priest, left without his flock, had to take up the trail of the flying neophytes, follow them to the recesses of the forests, and persuade them to come back.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* The Paulistas were the inhabitants of the Portuguese (now Brazilian)   town of Sao Paulo.  Azara, who hated the Jesuits (his brother,   Don Nicolas de Azara, having been concerned in their expulsion),   says that fear of the Paulistas contributed to the success of the Jesuits   with the Indians.  Dean Funes (\\\\`Historia del Paraguay', etc.)   says just as reasonably that it was fear of the Spanish settlers. --\\n\\nAs a means to secure the confidence of the Indians, the Jesuits found themselves obliged to communicate as rarely as possible with the Spanish settlements.  Thus, from the first the policy of isolation, which was one of the chief charges brought against the Order in later years, was of necessity begun.\\\\*  Voltaire, no lover of religious Orders, says of the Jesuits:\\\\*\\\\*  \\\\`When in 1768 the missions of Paraguay left the hands of the Jesuits, they had arrived at perhaps the highest degree of civilization to which it is possible to conduct a young people, and certainly at a far superior state than that which existed in the rest of the new hemisphere. The laws were respected there, morals were pure, a happy brotherhood united every heart, all the useful arts were in a flourishing state, and even some of the more agreeable sciences; plenty was universal.'\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* There was, however, a royal Order (`cedula real') which applied   to all America, which especially prohibited Spaniards from living   in the Indian towns, and, moreover, provided that even for purposes of trade   no Spaniard should remain for more than three days in an Indian town. ** `Histoire Politique et Philosophique des Indes', vol. i., p. 289    (Gene\\\\\\\\ve, 1780). --\\n\\nIt is, however, to be remembered that Voltaire wrote as a philosopher, and not as an economist, and that his statement most probably would be traversed by those who see advancement rather in material improvement than in moral happiness, for without doubt, in Lima and in Mexico upon the whole, society must have made amongst the Spanish and Spanish-descended citizens greater advances than in the Jesuit reductions of Paraguay.  In some respects their almost inaccessible situation close to the cataract of the Parana was favourable to the early Jesuits, and in quick succession the villages of Loreto, San Francisco Xavier, San Jose, San Ignacio, San Pedro, and others of less importance, were founded, containing in all about forty thousand souls.\\\\*\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Cretineau Joly, \\\\`Histoire Religieuse, Politique et Litte/raire   de la Compagnie de Je/sus', vol. iii., cap. v., p. 322 (Paris, 1846). --\\n\\nSo in the Jesuit reductions of the province of Guayra was first begun the system of treating the Indians kindly, and standing between them and the Spanish settlers, which made the Company of Jesus so hated afterwards in Paraguay. Little by little their influence grew, so that when, in 1614, Padre Antonio Ruiz de Montoya arrived, he found that there were already one hundred and nineteen Jesuits in Guayra and in Paraguay. Of all the Jesuits who, during the long period of their labours, appeared in Paraguay, he was the most remarkable; one of the most learned men of the age in which he lived, he yet united in himself the qualities of a man of action to those of scholar and of missionary. Without his presence most likely not a tenth part of the Indians would have escaped after the destruction of the missions of Guayra in 1630 and 1631 at the hands of the half-civilized hordes known as Paulistas or Mamalucos, who from the city of San Paulo carried fire and sword amongst the Guaranis.\\n\\nIt is easy to understand that the Spanish colonists, who had looked on all the Indians as slaves, were rendered furious by the advent of the Jesuits, who treated them as men.\\n\\nTo-day the European colonist in Africa labours less to enslave than to exterminate the natives; but if a body of clergy of any sect having the abnegation and disregard of consequences of the Jesuits of old should arise, fancy the fury that would be evoked if they insisted that it were as truly murder to slay a black man as it is to kill a man whose skin is white.  Most fortunately, our clergy of to-day, especially those of the various churches militant in Uganda, think otherwise, and hold that Christ was the first inventor of the \\\\`colour-line'.\\n\\nAt the first settlement of South America great semi-feudal fiefs called `encomiendas' were granted to the conquerors.  One of the conditions of their tenure was that the `encomenderos' (the owners of the fiefs) `should see to the religious education of the Indians'. Much the same kind of thing as to enjoin kindness and Christian forbearance upon the directors of a modern Chartered Company.  But, in addition to the `encomiendas', two other systems were in vogue called `yanaconas' and `mitayos', which were in fact designed to reduce the Indians to the condition of mere slaves.\\n\\nHerrera\\\\* says that the \\\\`\\\"yanaconas\\\" were men destined from birth to perpetual slavery and captivity, and in their clothing, treatment, and the conditions of their toil, were differently treated from free men.'\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* \\\\`Historia General de los hechos de los Castellanos   en las Islas y tierra firme del Mar Oceano', decad. v., lib. iv., cap. xl. --\\n\\nIn Paraguay these `yanaconas' were known as `Indios Originarios', and generally were descendants of Indians conquered in war; they, too, were in a condition of serfdom.  They lived in the house of the `encomendero', and could not be sold, and the `encomendero' was (in theory) obliged not only to feed and clothe them, but to instruct them in religious truths. In order to see that these conditions were duly carried out, visitors were sent each year to hear what mutually the \\\\`encomenderos' and the Indians had to say.\\n\\nHerrera*1* describes the Indians under the `mitayo' system by the name of `mitayos tindarunas', explaining that the word `tindaruna' signifies `forced labour'.  The chiefs had to provide a certain number of them every year to work in mines and manufactories, and so well was the labour in the mines known to be fatal, that the Indians upon being drawn for service disposed of all their property, and not infrequently divorced their wives.  The \\\\`mitayos' were at the beginning Indians who had not fought against the Spaniards, but had submitted to their rule.  They were grouped in townships composed of portions of a tribe under a chief to whom the Spaniards gave the position of Alcalde.  In the towns thus formed only the men between eighteen and fifty were liable to be drawn for service in the mines; originally their term of service was for only two months in the year, and for the remaining ten months they were in theory as free as were the Spanish settlers.  By 1612 the abuses of their system had so diminished the number of the Indians that Don Francisco de Alfaro was named by the Spanish Government to report upon it, and to reform abuses where he found it possible.  His report declared that the Guaranis and Guaycurus should not be made slaves of, and it abolished in their favour the forced labour which they had previously endured.  The European settlers in Asuncion thought that this was owing to the influence of the Jesuits, and therefore they expelled them from the town.  Recalled to Santiago, they founded there a college, and those who remained in Paraguay pushed on the mission-work.  Brabo*2* points out that the first twenty reductions founded by the Company of Jesus were settled in the first twenty years from their first appearance in the land,*3* and that from the foundation of the Mission of St. George (the last established of the first twenty towns) to that of San Joaquim, in the wild forests of the Taruma, they employed a hundred and twelve years. In the interval they chiefly occupied themselves in the consolidation of their first settlements, and in various unsuccessful attempts to institute similar reductions amongst the Indians of the Chaco across the Paraguay.\\n\\n\\\\-- *1* `Historia General de los hechos de los Castellanos en     las Islas y tierra firme del Mar Oceano', decad. v., lib. x., cap. lxxx. *2* `Inventarios de los bienes hallados a/ la Expulsion de los Jesuitas'     (Madrid, 1872). *3* The Franciscans had already five or six settlements. --\\n\\nBut whilst the Jesuits were settling their reductions in the province of Guayra and those upon the Parana and Uruguay, a nest of hawks looked at their neophytes as pigeons ready fattening for their use.  Almost eight hundred miles away, at the city of San Paulo de Piritinanga, in Brazil, a strange society had come into existence by degrees.  Peopled at first by Portuguese and Dutch adventurers and malefactors, it had become a nest of pirates and a home for all the desperadoes of Brazil and Paraguay. This engaging population, being in want of wives whereby to propagate their virtues, took to themselves Indians and negresses, and bred a race worse ten times than were themselves, as often happens both in the cases of Mulattos and Mestizos in America. Under the name of Mamelucos\\\\* (given to them no one knows why) they soon became the terror of the land.  Equally at home on horseback, in canoes upon the rivers, or in schooners on the sea, excellent marksmen and courageous fighters, they subsisted chiefly by procuring Indians as slaves for the plantations in Brazil. In a short time they exhausted all the Indians near San Paulo, and were forced to search far in the depths of the unknown interior. Little by little, following the course of the great rivers in their canoes, they reached the Jesuit settlements upon the upper waters of the Parana, where they burned the towns and the churches, made captives of the converts, and killed the priests.  Montoya relates that a Jesuit, having clasped an Indian in his arms to save him, was deluged with his blood, a Mameluco having crept up behind him and plunged his lance into the Indian behind the Jesuit's back.  The Mameluco, on being, as Montoya says, `reprehended' by the Jesuit, dogmatically remarked, `I shall be saved in spite of God, for to be saved a man has only to believe,'\\\\*\\\\* a remark which showed him clearly an honest opponent of the Jesuits, as they insisted greatly on the doctrine of good works.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* The word in Brazil is used to designate a half-breed, but the etymology   seems unknown. \\\\*\\\\* `Me he de salvar a pesar de Dios, porque para salvarse el hombre    no ha menester mas que creer' (Ruiz Montoya, `Conquista Espiritual').    Montoya adds with a touch of humour quite in Cervantes' vein:    \\\\`Este, sabe ya por experiencia la falsedad de su doctrina,    porque le mataron de tres balazos, sin confesion.' --\\n\\nRuiz Montoya and others tell us that the plan of action of the Paulistas was either to attack the Jesuit reductions on Sunday, when the sheep were gathered in the fold listening to Mass, surround the church, murder the priest, and carry off the neophytes as slaves; or else, disguised as Jesuits, enter a mission, gain the confidence of the Indians, and then communicate with their soldiers, who were waiting in the woods. But not content with this, it seems, so often did they practise singing Mass to pass as Jesuits, that on returning to San Paulo, in their orgies, their great diversion was to masquerade as priests.  So that the rascals not only profited by their villainy, but extracted much amusement from their wicked deeds.\\\\*  This, in Montoya's opinion, was even more damnable than the actual crime.  And so no doubt it was, and we in England, by having made our vice as dull as virtue is in other lands, have gone some way towards morality, for vice and virtue, both deprived of humour, become not so far separated as some virtuous dull folk may think.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* The Mamelucos sometimes pushed their forays right through Paraguay   into the district of the Moxos, and Padre Patricio Fernandez,   in his curious \\\\`Relacion de los Indios Chiquitos' (Madrid, 1726),   relates their adventures in that far-distant district,   and the conflicts which the Indians, led by their priests and helped   by the Spanish settlers, sustained. --\\n\\nQuite naturally, these redoubtable land and river pirates saw in the Jesuit reductions upon the Paranapane, and generally throughout the district of Guayra, merely an opportunity of capturing more Indians than usual at a haul.  In 1629 they first appeared before the Mission of San Antonio and destroyed it utterly, burning the church and houses, and driving off the Indians to sell as slaves. San Miguel and Jesus-Maria shortly suffered the same fate.  In Concepcion Padre Salazar was regularly besieged, and he and all the people reduced to eating dogs, cats, rats, mice, and even snakes.  At the last moment, when about to surrender, Father Cataldino, hastily arming some Indians with any rude weapons at his command, marched on the place and raised the siege. A worthy member of the Church militant this exploring, fighting, intrepid Italian priest, and one the Company of Jesus should honour, for to him, perhaps as much as to any of these first explorers of the Upper Parana, is credit due.\\n\\nBut still the Mamelucos ran their course, destroying town after town, so that in the short space of a year (1630-31) they destroyed partially the reductions of San Francisco Xavier, San Jose, San Pedro, and La Concepcion; and the two first founded, San Ignacio and Loreto, were ruined utterly.  The wretched Indians, to whom by law the Jesuits were forbidden to serve out firearms, stood no chance against the well-trained Paulistas, with their horses, guns, and bloodhounds, assisted as they were by troops of savage Indians who discharged poisoned arrows from blowpipes and from bows.  Small wonder that, as Montoya, Charlevoix, Lahier,*1* and Filiberto Monero*2* all agree, despair took hold of them, so that in many instances they cursed the Jesuits and fled back to the woods.  When one reflects that many of the Indian tribes looked upon baptism as a poison,*3* it is not strange that they should have associated effect with cause, and set down all their sufferings to the influence of the malignant rite to which the Jesuits had subjected them.  The isolated Jesuits ran considerable risk from their own sheep, and Padre Mola, after the ruin of San Antonio, was suspected by them of being in league with the Paulistas, and had to flee for safety to another town; and as a touch of comedy is seldom wanting to make things bitterer to those in misfortune, a troop of savage Indians, having arrived to attack the Reduction of San Antonio, and finding it already burning, instantly thought poor Padre Mola had been the instigator, and, starting on his trail, almost surprised him before he reached a refuge from their patriotic rage.\\n\\n\\\\-- *1* Lahier (Francisci) S. I., `Annae Paraguarie, Annor. 1635, et duor. sequ.' *2* `Relazioni della Provincia del Paraguai'. *3* Brabo. --\\n\\nThus in the greater world reformers of all sorts have not infrequently in times of scarcity and danger been taken by their proteges for the authors of their trials and stoned, whilst the smug Government which caused the ruin, well bolstered up in the affection of its `taxables', chuckled, serenely confident in the unending folly of mankind. Most certainly the Jesuits struggled to do their duty to their neophytes in what they thought they saw was right.  On foot and unattended Fathers Maceta and Mansilla followed the fifteen thousand captives to Brazil, confessing those who fell upon the road before they died, and instant in supplication to the Paulistas for the prisoners' release. Father Maceta especially behaved heroically, carrying the chains of those who could hardly drag themselves along, himself half dead with hunger and his constant toil.  Especially he strove to effect the release of a captive chief called Guiravera, who had been one of his bitterest enemies, and strove so hard that a Paulista captain, either touched by his zeal or wearied with his pleading, released the chief, his wife and family, and six of the Indians of his tribe. The chief returned to become the Jesuits' best friend, and the two priests on foot followed the captives' train. What they endured on foot without provisions, tortured by insects, and in danger from wild beasts, as well as constant perils from the Paulistas, who now and then pricked them with lances or fired pistols over their heads to frighten them away, none but those who have journeyed in the forests of that forgotten corner of the world can estimate. I see them in their torn and sun-browned cassocks struggling through the `esteros'*1* in water to the knees, falling and rising oft, after the fashion of the supposititious Christian on life's way; pushing along through forest paths across which darted humming-birds, now coming on a dying man and kneeling by his side, now gathering the berries of the guavirami*2* to eat upon the road, and then again catching sight of a jaguar as it slunk beside the trail, and all the time convinced that all their efforts, like the efforts of most of those who strive, would be in vain.  So stumbling through the woods, crossing the rivers on inflated ox-skins, baked by the sun upon the open plains, at length the Jesuits reached San Paulo, where they had a college, and without resting set at once to work. In season (and what in cases of the kind is ten times more important), out of season, they besought, pleaded, and preached, and finding as little grace from the Paulista chiefs as a transgressor against some fiery dogma would find from a sour-faced North British dogmatist, they started for Rio de Janeiro to see the Council-General of Brazil. There they were told that the right person to address was the Captain-General of the colony, who had his residence in Bahia, five or six hundred miles away.  Not the least daunted, they set out, and found Don Diego Luis Oliveira more or less friendly, but as usual fearful of giving offence to those who had a vested interest in the trade. Then the two Jesuits, hearing that another invasion of the Paulistas was expected in Guayra, started back on their long journey through the woods, over the plains, across the mountain ranges, and through the dank \\\\`esteros' which lay between them and their missions on the Parana.  The Captain-General seems to have been roused to a sense of the position by their words, for on his annual visitation at San Paulo he spoke in public to the colonists against their slave raids, when a shot fired from the meeting ended his speech.*3*  The inhabitants then signified to him that, sooner than give up what seemed to them a justifiable and honest means of life, they would be debaptized. How they proposed to debaptize themselves is not related, but perhaps after the fashion of the Guaranis -- by sand, hot water, and scraping with a shell; though why the tongue should be thus scarified seems doubtful, for no sect of Christians that is known exacts that people at that sacrament should put out their tongues, and even baptism does little or nothing to increase the power of scandal inherent both in those who have been and those who never were baptized.\\n\\n\\\\-- *1* An \\\\`estero' is a tract of country covered by water     to the depth of two or three feet.  The bottom is usually hard,     but it is full of holes and hummocks.  High pampa grass and reeds     not infrequently obscure the view, and clouds of insects     make life miserable.  If the tract extends to more than a day's journey,     the night passed on a dry hummock, holding one's horse and listening     without a fire to the wild beasts, is likely to remain     present to one in after-life, especially if alone; the only things     that seem to link one to humanity are one's horse and the familiar stars.     Perhaps that is why Capella has always seemed to me in some sort     my own property. *2* This curious berry, about the size of a large damson,     grows on a little shrub in sandy and rocky soils.     It has a thick yellow rind and several large seeds,     and the property of being icy cold in the hottest weather --     a true traveller's joy.  Dr. de Bourgade de la Dardye,     in his excellent book on Paraguay (the English edition     published in London in 1892), thinks it is either a eugenia or a myrtus. *3* Charlevoix, vol. i., liv. vii., p. 384. --\\n\\nAbout this time (1630) the poor Jesuits were much tormented by the return to paganism of their Indians, and most especially by a hideous dwarf who set himself up as a god, and found a host of worshippers.  Good Father Charlevoix thinks that \\\\`ce petit-monstre',\\\\* despairing of being thought a man, had no resource but to give out he was a god, and remarks that, as even more hideous gods have been adored, it is not surprising that the Indians took him at his word. When stripped of the somewhat strange phraseology of the simple Jesuit, there is nothing really shocking in the incident.  People in general, in making gods, endue them with their own least admirable attributes, and logically these poor Indians but followed out the general scheme.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Ibid., liv. vii., p. 359. --\\n\\nBut in the midst of heresies and dwarf-gods, with the Paulistas almost always in the field, a man arose who was to lead the Jesuits and their neophytes out of Guayra and settle them securely below the cataract in the Misiones of Paraguay. Born probably late in the sixteenth century in Spain, Antonio Ruiz de Montoya was amongst the first of the Jesuit Fathers who came to Paraguay.  In 1612 we find him recently arrived from Spain;*1* sent up to the province of Guayra to the assistance of Fathers Maceta and Cataldino.  For thirty years,*2* as he himself informs us in his book, he remained in Paraguay, and in his own pathetic words he tells us how most of his life was spent.  `I have lived,' he says, `all through the period of thirty years in Paraguay, as in the desert searching for wild beasts -- that is, for savage Indians -- crossing wild countries, traversing mountain chains, in order to find Indians and bring them to the true sheepfold of the Holy Church and to the service of His Majesty.*3*  With my companions I established thirteen reductions or townships in the wilds, and this I did with great anxiety, in hunger, nakedness, and frequent peril of my life. And all these years I passed far from my brother Spaniards have made me almost a rustic and ignorant of the polished language of the Court.' Travelling as he did continually, few knew the country from Guayra to Yapeyu*4* so well as he; he tells us that for \\\\`all travelling equipment' he took a hammock, and a little mandioca flour, that he usually travelled on foot with either sandals or bare feet, and that for eight or nine years he never once tasted bread.\\n\\n\\\\-- *1* Charlevoix, `Histoire du Paraguay', vol. lvi., p. 285. *2* `Conquista Espiritual del Paraguay', Ruiz de Montoya,     introductory chapter. *3* This may either mean to the service of God or to the service of the King     (Philip III.), for in the time of Montoya \\\\`Majesty' was used in addressing     both the King of Spain and the King of Heaven. *4* Yapeyu, or Reyes, was the southernmost of the Jesuit reductions.     It was situated upon the Uruguay in what is now     the Argentine province of Entre Rios. --\\n\\nAbout the year 1611-12 we find him charged with a mission to the Provincial at Asuncion to disabuse him of a report which had been carried there that the Jesuits of Guayra were garnering in no fruit from all their labours in the wilds. The rumour had been so much repeated that the superiors in Asuncion were on the point of calling back the missionaries and giving up all hope. Montoya, accompanied by six Indians, set out upon the journey, which by land to-day is enough to appal the boldest traveller. Walking along, he found himself about the middle of his way alone, his Indians having loitered in the rear.  Night caught him in the forests, and a storm came on.  He passed the night at the foot of a large tree, hungry and wet, and, waking in the morning, found himself so crippled with arthritic pains as to be obliged to continue his journey on his hands and knees.  Alone and helpless, he dragged himself to a place called Maracayu, and, failing to obtain a canoe, went on another league, and there lay down to die, his leg being swelled enormously with the rheumatic pains.  Then, as he says himself, he prayed to San Ignacio, telling him that from a sentiment of obedience he had set out upon the journey through the waste.  Nothing could have been better, for the saint (who must have seen him all the time), flattered, perhaps, that his own chief virtue had been the cause of so much pain, promptly healed him and restored his leg to its usual size, and Montoya went on his way rejoicing to Asuncion.  The Provincial heard and was disabused, but was unable to send a single man to help, and poor Montoya set off again back to Guayra alone, having gained nothing but his sufferings on the road.\\n\\nAgain, in 1614, we find him in Asuncion combating calumnies spread by the Spanish settlers against the Jesuits. In the same year (as he informs us\\\\*) he was witness in the Reduction of Loreto of a strange circumstance. `An Indian,' he says, `of intelligence and pious conduct called me to administer the last Sacraments, and to confess him before he died, and this I did.  As there seemed little hope of his recovery, and pressing business called me away, I quitted him after having given orders for his burial.  He died in a short time -- at least, all those who were with him had no doubt of this; on my return I found the man whom I had charged to stay beside the Indian till his death preparing for his funeral.  Toward mid-day they came to tell me that the dead man had come to life, and wished to speak to me.  I ran there, and found him with a cheerful face in the middle of a crowd of Indians. I asked him what had happened since I last saw him, and he answered me that the instant that I quitted him his soul had taken its departure from his body; then, at a point which he thought near to his hammock, a devil had appeared, who said to him, \\\"You are my prey,\\\" and that he answered it could not be, for he had confessed himself to the best of his ability, and had received the holy Viaticum before his death; that the devil had sustained that his confession had been incomplete, and that he had forgotten to confess that twice he had been drunk, to which he answered that it was an oversight, and he hoped that God would not remember it.  Then, on the devil sustaining that he had committed a sacrilege, St. Peter had appeared, followed by angels, and driven off the fiend.  I asked him how he had known St. Peter, and he replied by describing him, though he had never seen an image of the saint.  \\\"The saint,\\\" he said, \\\"covered me with his mantle, and I felt myself instantly carried through the air.  First I perceived a lovely landscape, and further on a great city, from which a shining light appeared.  Then the Apostle and the angels stopped, and the first said to me, \\\\`This is the city of the Lord; we live here with Him, but the time of your entry is not yet. It is written that your soul shall once more join your body, and in three days you must appear in church.'  Then all was dark, and in an instant I woke up alive and well.\\\"\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* \\\\`Conquista Espiritual', p. 22. --\\n\\n`I,' says Montoya, `understood by the last words of St. Peter that the man had to die in three days, and I asked what he thought himself. \\\"I think,\\\" said he, \\\"that next Sunday they will carry my body to the church, and I am certain that I only returned to life in order to exhort my relatives and my friends to listen to your instructions.\\\" . . . When Sunday came he made his general confession,\\\\* admitted the two sins the devil had reproached him with, exhorted all to live a Christian life, and a few moments afterwards quietly gave up the ghost.'\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* This time, it is to be hoped, without omissions. --\\n\\nThis is the sole occasion on which Padre Ruiz Montoya even remotely touches the field of miracles, as he in general relies upon himself, his knowledge of the world, and on his patience, which must have been almost North British in its quality, if he acted up to his own favourite maxim of \\\\`by returning thanks for injuries is how wise men conduct their business.'\\\\*\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* \\\\`Dando gracias por agravios negocian los hombres sabios.' --\\n\\nIn 1623 we find him praying Father Cataldino to let him accompany the expedition to Itiranbaru, a mountain wooded to the summit, in which lived several wild tribes.  There he so worked upon the Indians as to establish them in a reduction under the title of St. Francis Xavier,\\\\* and left the mountain, which had been a haunt of savages, as Padre del Techo says in his curious work on Paraguay, \\\\`all at the service of the Lord.'\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* Soon afterwards ruined by the Paulistas. --\\n\\nIn 1623, whilst preaching, he was suddenly assailed by hostile Indians, and seven of his Indians pierced with arrows at his feet. Undoubtedly, he must have been killed had not an Indian taken his hat and cloak, and run into the middle of the enemy to distract the fire.  In the confusion both the heroic Indian and Montoya managed to escape, the latter getting into a canoe which, fortunately, was ready at the river-side.  But in the midst of all his occupations he had time to study natural history in the spirit of the time, as the following description clearly shows:  `Amongst the other rarities of the land is an amphibious animal. . . .  It is like a sheep, with but the difference that its teeth and nails are like a tiger's, which animal it equals in ferocity.  The Indians never look on it without terror, and when it sallies from the marshes where it lives (which it does ordinarily in troops), they have no other chance of escape but to climb up a tree, and even then sometimes are not in safety, for this terrible creature sometimes uproots the tree, or sometimes stays on guard until the Indian falls into its jaws.'  Thus far Montoya; but Charlevoix informs us that, `en langue Guaranie', it is known as the `ao', and rather tamely adds, `When one of these animals is slain, the people make a jacket of its skin.'\\n\\nAgain, Montoya tells us of the horse on which the venerable Padre Roque used to ride, which, when he died, refused all food, and wept perpetually, two streams of water running from its eyes.  It never allowed an Indian to mount it after its master's death, and finally expired, close to his grave, of grief.  A kindly, scholarly, intrepid priest, well skilled in knowledge of the world, and not without some tincture of studies in science, as the above-related anecdotes reveal to us.  No doubt the Indians loved him far and wide, and his superiors stood in some little awe of him, as those in office often do of their subordinates when they show that capacity for action which is a sure bar to advancement either in Church or State.\\n\\nIn 1627 Montoya was made head of the missions in Guayra, which opened up to him the opportunity of showing what kind of man he was. In this year the Spaniards of Villa Rica, the nearest town in Paraguay to the reductions in Guayra, sent out an expedition to chastize some Indians who had insulted a chief called Tayaoba, whom Montoya had baptized. This was the pretext for the expedition, but Montoya knew well that the real object was to hunt for slaves.  He brought before the Governor the edict of the King of Spain forbidding any war to be made upon the Indians without sufficient cause.  All was in vain, and the expedition left Villa Rica and plunged into the wilds.  Montoya, sore against the Governor's desire, went with the expedition, taking with him Padre Salazar and some well-armed Indians.  It was lucky for the Spaniards that he was there, for on the second day a flight of arrows burst from a wood and wounded many of them.  The captain of the expedition ordered a retreat, which, situated as they were, exposed on all sides to the fire of an enemy whom they could not see, must have proved fatal. Montoya counselled throwing up earthworks before some huts which stood upon the edge of the woods in which the Indians were; this done, he sent a messenger to Villa Rica for reinforcements. Even behind the earthworks the Spaniards were hard pressed; no one could show himself without being pierced by an arrow. The number of the Indians daily increased, till on the third day they numbered about four thousand, and seemed likely to advance upon the huts. The Spanish captain ordered a rally, and the neophytes wished to decamp, taking Montoya with them, and then gain the shelter of the woods. This he would not allow, and, charging with the soldiers, put the Indians to flight.  The Spaniards, far from being grateful for their lives, seeing their hopes of making prisoners had vanished, wished to lay hands upon the Indians whom Montoya had brought, and who had fought beside them in the recent fray.  Hearing that in the morning the Spanish soldiers would attack his neophytes, Montoya sent them off by night, and in the morning, when the Spanish captain found him and the other priest alone, he said, `Thinking you had no other use for the Indians, I advised them to return.'  The captain had the grace to say nothing but, `Then, you gave them good advice, my father.' The two priests waited patiently till the soldiers had retired, and then sent for their Indians and quietly went home.  Thus it appears that at necessity Padre Montoya was a true son of San Ignacio.\\n\\nIn 1628 Montoya seems to have met for the first time Padre Diaz Tano, who afterwards was his companion both in the retreat from Guayra down the Parana and in his mission to the King.  No matter whether a man make his career with Indians in the wilds of Paraguay or amongst the so-called reasoning people in more sophisticated lands, if he once show himself superior to the ordinary run of men, there is something of an invidious character certain to be attributed to him by those who think that genius is the worst attribute that man can have. This, Montoya did not escape from amongst the Spaniards, but the Indians, at least, were less envious, being perhaps less educated, for they believed that the soul of one of their `caciques',* known in his life as Quaratici, had entered into him.  The rumour reached at last a chief called Guiravera, known to the Spaniards as the `Exterminator' from his cruelty, who, hearing that the soul of his late rival had entered into Montoya, came to see him at the head of a large retinue of people of his tribe. Montoya and Maceta were at Villa Rica, and on the chief's approach they happened to be seated in the plaza of the town.  As he approached them, followed by his men, and with a threatening air, they remained seated, merely motioning him to take a seat upon a bench.  This he did, after making one of his men cover the seat with a tiger-skin and stand behind on guard. What passed between them, most unluckily, Montoya has not set down. What he has told us only makes us wish for more, for it appears that after the usual salutations Guiravera refused to speak, and getting up walked about the town, silently looking at everything. But, as it ever happens, even Montoya was no exception to the general run of history-writers, who usually are occupied alone with facts which seem to them important at the time, forgetting that posterity (for whom they write) can judge of the result as well as they themselves, but thirst for details to complete the chain betwixt them and their predecessors.  One thing is set down \\\\`in extenso' -- not by Montoya, but by another Jesuit -- that is, the sermon which Montoya preached to bring the chief into the fold. Considered as a sermon it does not seem out of the common way, and judged by its results was futile at the time, for the chief answered coldly that he would think the matter over, and then retired into the woods.  But the seed thus sown in Villa Rica was to bear fruit, for in a year the chief, either tired of his ancestral gods or having pondered on the sermon, came into the fold and was baptized as Paul.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* \\\\`Cacique' = chief. --\\n\\nAn irruption*1* of the Mamelucos called Father Montoya from baptizing Indians and recovering their souls to the more prosaic, if as useful, task of saving their bodies, which he did at the immediate peril of his own.  The Mamelucos had appeared (1628) before the Reduction of Encarnacion, and many of the Indians had already taken refuge in the woods.  Those who remained were like a flock of sheep without a shepherd, and knew not what to do.  Padre Montoya hastened to the spot, and called on every Christian to take up arms. Under the circumstances he undoubtedly was right; still, in reading history one is puzzled to observe how often and in how many different countries Christians have to resort to arms.  But before proceeding to extremities, Montoya sent out Fathers Mendoza and Domenecchi with some of the principal inhabitants of the reduction to parley with the Mamelucos, who, under their celebrated leader Antonio Raposo, were encamped outside the place.  Upon arriving within range of the Paulista camp they were greeted with a shower of balls and arrows, which killed several of the Indians and wounded Father Mendoza in the foot.  But when, in spite of his wound, the Jesuit advanced towards the camp and insisted on speaking with the leader, the Mamelucos were so struck with his courage that they gave up to him several of the Indians whom they had taken prisoners upon the previous day.  Next day Father Montoya, encouraged by the unhoped-for success of Father Mendoza, went out himself, and, facing the Paulistas, somewhat imprudently threatened them with the wrath of Heaven and the King if they did not retire. The wrath of Heaven is often somewhat capricious in its action, and the King of Spain, although as wrathful as he had been an Emperor, was too far away to inspire much terror in his subjects on the Parana. So that the Paulista treated the wrath of both their Majesties as qualities which he could well neglect, and for sole answer ordered his men to march upon the town.  But, whether owing to their hard hearts having been touched by the good Father's eloquence, or the fact that the neophytes were under arms, when the Paulistas arrived close to the town they altered their intentions and filed off into the woods.  Profiting by the respite from hostilities, Montoya, in conjunction with Padre Diaz Tano and a Father bearing the somewhat curious name of Padre Justo Vansurk Mansilla,*2* devoted all his attention for the time to the Mission of Santa Maria la Mayor, which was the most flourishing of all the missions of the time, and which to-day still shows the greatest remnants of the Jesuits' work, both in regard to architecture and the remains of Indian population still settled on the old mission lands.  But even there the Jesuits did not escape without their trials, for it appears*3* that a quantity of new proselytes arrived with women, whom the good Fathers stigmatized as \\\\`concubines', and whom the ignorant Indians in the innocence of their hearts looked on as wives.  The order being given to dismiss these concubines (or wives), a few submitted; but the rest, leaving the mission, started cultivating a tract of land in the vicinity.\\n\\n\\\\-- *1* These raids were known as `malocas'. *2* In Paraguay it was not unusual for foreign Jesuits     to hispaniolize their names; thus, Smith became Esmid.     But it was more usual to add a Spanish name, as appears     to have been the case with P. Vansurk Mansilla.  Father Manuel Querini,     in his report to the King of Spain in 1750, mentions the names of Boxer,     Keiner, and Limp, with many other French, English, and German names,     amongst those of priests at the various missions. *3* Montoya, `Conquista Espiritual'.  Also Charlevoix. --\\n\\nThen the good Fathers, with Montoya at their head, hit on a stroke of genius. Taking the opportunity when the seceding Indians were away gathering their crops, they set fire to their houses and carried off the children and the women,\\\\* back to the mission.  The recalcitrants appeared next day at Santa Maria la Mayor, and were received again into the bosom of the Church.  Heresy, also, now and then made its appearance, for two rascals, having built two temples upon two hills, transported to them the skeletons of two magicians long since dead, and the fickle people left the churches empty, and went to worship at the magicians' shrines.  But in this season of sorrow and of care, and whilst the churches in the Mission of Encarnacion were left deserted, Montoya once again showed his determination, and put things right. Not being able to cope alone with the heathen, Father Diaz Tano went to Guayra, and induced Montoya (still the superior of the reductions in that province) to give his aid.  He came, and, having armed some of the faithful, at dead of night attacked the temples and razed them to the ground.\\n\\n\\\\-- \\\\* It is certain that the Guaranis, like many other Indians,   were polygamists, and Xarque, in his `Vida Apostolica   del P. Joseph Cataldino', thus explains the matter:   `El tener tanto numero de concubinas, no solamente lo ocasiona   su natural lascivo, sino tambien, el vicio de la embriaguez,   pues teniendo tantas criadas tenian con mas abundancia su cerveza y vino.'   Thus Xarque seems to agree with the late Miss Mary Kingsley,   who in one of her books (though she says nothing about   the \\\\`natural lascivo' of the negroes of the West Coast of Africa)   seems to attribute the polygamy of the negroes to the difficulty   a man experiences, in the countries in which she travelled,   in getting his food prepared by one wife. --\\n\\nIn 1631 Montoya and others came in the forests of Guayra upon the wild Caaguas.  These they strove hard to civilize, but, after labouring long, with all their eloquence were able to induce only eighteen to return with them to the Encarnacion. It was \\\\`with difficulty that they were able to give them a sufficient knowledge of the mysteries of our faith to be able to bestow the rite of baptism.'  It may be that the Caaguas, not having much to occupy their minds, approached the mysteries of our faith in more receptive attitudes than is attained by those whose minds are full. But, anyhow, Montoya, with true prudence, deferred their baptism till just before their death, for a few months of life outside the forests proved fatal to them all.  Faith is a wondrous thing, and able to move most things, even common-sense.  One wonders, though, why, when the Jesuits learned from experience that the poor Indians invariably died when exposed to the burning sun upon the plains, they continued in their fatal efforts to inflict baptism on the unoffending people of the woods.  If it were necessary, it surely might have taken place in their own homes, and the patients then might have been left to chance, to see how the reception of the holy rite acted upon their lives.\\n\\nIn 1631 the Mamelucos broke into the province of Guayra. All was confusion, and Montoya sent Father Diaz Tano to Asuncion to beg the Governor, Don Luis de Cespedes, to send them help. He answered that he could do nothing, and thus by leaving the whole territory of Guayra without defence lost a rich province to the Crown of Spain.  Though at the time (1631) Portugal and Spain were united, yet in the Indies their subjects were at war, and though in Europe Spain was the stronger of the two, in America the Portuguese conquered about that time rich provinces, which to-day form part of the quondam Empire of Brazil.\",\"timestamp\":1637495584,\"title\":\"Fathers Simon Maceta and Jose Cataldino (both Italians) left Asuncion on October \"},\"digest\":\"PaL63WSUF4ybwVOCieLsfZFEVuM8qGsQq-N6xPHCWd0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x994E4477C12eEdA205e5484164bDb84f9649036F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ukxWc_9SAv1d3R67CdJ98uB-rcn3cpUZTwoLcZnDBfc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"efyoTJ0Z6_576UgheYPM8CkTd4nrqC2Dd08kBicx-8c\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"9UTnp3-gLo30a3lPvARNxSTA4_U4gu7-oL5ep1xnJLN-L1tWxCenVwjs-4O0ThNxZVGXWjZ05fXBNjdIodDyAw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x89ac05b4a41b198ac4f1329e2d8f7555d9136a08a317c1909cc6f0d750dea911231083ae9baada93307fd3ae5a8cbda6a9c5f05311d43a87aa6c5c2193d33c071b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ukxWc_9SAv1d3R67CdJ98uB-rcn3cpUZTwoLcZnDBfc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"efyoTJ0Z6_576UgheYPM8CkTd4nrqC2Dd08kBicx-8c\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"PaL63WSUF4ybwVOCieLsfZFEVuM8qGsQq-N6xPHCWd0\"}"
