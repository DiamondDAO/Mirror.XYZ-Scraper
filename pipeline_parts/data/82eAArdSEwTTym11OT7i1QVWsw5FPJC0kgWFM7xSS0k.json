We believed in ourselves after our performances in previous matches and training sessions. Instead of putting too much pressure on ourselves, we remained positive.\\n\\n\\\"We've had many hard matches this season, so we've become experienced in dealing with tough situations. As long as there's still a chance in a match, we remain very calm. Our coach also helps us to quickly adjust our mindset and tactics.\\n\\n\\\"Many fans and our families made videos to support us before the final, which helped boost our confidence. We were both excited and nervous ... Our mentality was extremely good during matches, especially when we faced tough situations.
