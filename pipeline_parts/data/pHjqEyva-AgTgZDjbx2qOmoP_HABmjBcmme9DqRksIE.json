They are perhaps the most dangerous of our discoveries and technologies, a magic that must be respected and used very carefully.\\n\\nWe have a problem of language(s) more than anything else, and this problem can lead the unwary down conceptual dead-ends. The necessary limits of any language to encapsulate all of the characteristics of the thing being described and that thing’s interconnectedness with all other things. To wit, we cannot reduce the infinite to the finite and expect to maintain full fidelity.\\n\\n**“None of this cares for us. / Nothing shows why / At this unique distance from isolation / It becomes still more difficult to find / Words at once true and kind,/ Or not untrue and not unkind.”**\\n\\n(*Philip Larkin*)[\\\\[2\\\\]](#_ftn2)\\n\\nLanguage, like logic, has its own incompleteness problem; that is why some aspects of the recent Western tradition of the analytic philosophy of language have been damaging to philosophy and ethics.[\\\\[3\\\\]](#_ftn3) This analytic philosophy has, in some respects, represented a regression to a time before the understanding of Buddha thousands of years ago.\\n\\n**“Pratītyasamutpāda … a theory about how we gain correct and incorrect knowledge about being, becoming, existence and reality. The ‘dependent origination’ doctrine … ‘*highlights the Buddhist notion that all apparently substantial entities within the world are in fact wrongly perceived. We live under the illusion that terms such as I, self, mountain, tree, etc. denote permanent and stable things…*’ There is nothing permanent … no unique individual self in the nature of becoming and existence ([anatta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta)), because everything is a result of ‘*dependent origination*’ … there is fundamental emptiness in all phenomena and experiences.”**\\n\\n[\\\\[4\\\\]](#_ftn4)\\n\\nUnder the correct approach, we realise that the use of language presupposes or assumes so many different things about the world that is not contained within the word or even the language.\\n\\nThe concept of a ‘table’ presupposes legs (though of course not all things with legs are tables) and chairs and ultimately everything that is not table (that is everything else). It brings association with ‘wood’ and carpentry. This in turn brings craft, trees, clouds, earth and weather. Bringing water cycles and molecules (oxygen and hydrogen) which brings stars, energy, entropy and gravity. And so on, indefinitely.\\n\\nThe word ‘table’ needs the concept ‘table’ and both concept and word need an intelligent life-form to arise from the clay by billions of years of evolution to talk about such things. That is to say language can be useful, but it can not be ‘true’ in its deepest sense — it can only try to approach truth.\\n\\n**“Without philosophy thoughts are… cloudy and indistinct: its task is to make them clear and to give them sharp boundaries.”**\\n\\n(*Ludwig Wittgenstein*)[\\\\[5\\\\]](#_ftn5)\\n\\nWords are more or less useful tools — language gives us an illusion of representation of some aspect of reality. The better the language the better the approximation but we should not mistake it for the ‘unspeakable’ reality (and which is always changing quicker than our perception) — to the extent we do make that mistake we actually move further away from approximating the ineffable.\\n\\nOur use of language must start with our understanding of its risks of delusion and confusion — appreciation of its irreducible limitations. Our problems with language and our wider issues with ‘beliefs’ are often a collective mental illness.\\n\\n**“A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness.”**\\n\\n(*Alfred Korzybski*)[\\\\[6\\\\]](#_ftn6)\\n\\nNo reader would think that their given name contains within it all that is unique about their genes (code), life experience, cultural interests, family history, desires, suffering and hopes. A human name is not an example of successful algorithmic compression of that human — it is an extraordinary abstraction much like categorisations of humans by colour, class, race and gender.\\n\\n*So why would we expect a word or even our entire language to be able to adequately describe billions of life-forms, the meaning or nature of life and the wisdom required to try to make sense of the interconnectedness of it all?*[\\\\[7\\\\]](#_ftn7)\\n\\n![Peter Pink-Howitt, “the craft in a man’s hand and the wisdom in a tree’s root: they all arise together”, algo-art, 2021 CE](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*1JENNWEAlM7HnVSxKGwwsA.jpeg)\\n\\n**“‘It is no secret. All power is one in source and end, I think. Years and distances, stars and candles, water and wind and wizardry, the craft in a man’s hand and the wisdom in a tree’s root: they all arise together. My name, and yours, and the true name of the sun, or a spring of water, or an unborn child, all are syllables of the great word that is very slowly spoken by the shining of the stars. There is no other power. No other name.’ Staying his knife on the carved wood, Murre asked, ‘What of death?’ The girl listened, her shining black head bent down. ‘For a word to be spoken,’ Ged answered slowly, ‘there must be silence. Before, and after.’”**\\n\\n(*Ursula Le Guin*)[\\\\[8\\\\]](#_ftn8)\\n\\nIn more mathematical language, ‘tables’ are a discrete set of objects that have a certain form and purpose; all other objects that do not have the same are outside of that set. Interestingly, the property of ‘tableness’ is very hard to define for algorithms. Young humans seem to intuit ‘tableness’ without having to see a near-infinite variety of tables first. This is the opposite of how computer programs learn ‘tableness’. Plato’s theory of perfect or ideal forms is relevant here.\\n\\n**“In the allegory, Socrates describes a group of people who have lived chained to the wall of a cave all their lives, facing a blank wall. The people watch shadows projected on the wall from objects passing in front of a fire behind them and give names to these shadows. The shadows are the prisoners’ reality but are not accurate representations of the real world. Three higher levels exist: the natural sciences; mathematics, geometry, and deductive logic; and the theory of forms.”**\\n\\n[\\\\[9\\\\]](#_ftn9)\\n\\n![Peter Pink-Howitt, ‘shadows by fire’, algo-art, 2021 CE](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*l4bgYgDJFhbdDnHXHWRiUw.jpeg)\\n\\nHumans appear to be able to perceive the concept of an idealised abstract quality that real objects are a projection, reflection or manifestation of. In a sense, the word and concept or quality of ‘tableness’ is like a geometric object that exists in a different dimension or plane; our abstraction algorithm allows us to intuit tableness when presented with a new manifestation.\\n\\nOur ability to believe in abstracts is both a blessing and a curse. It can be very useful; however, we are not always able to separate the reality from the potentially useful abstractions (religion, race, country, money).\\n\\nThis gives rise to many horrifying actions against others, continuing delusions of free will and a dangerous misunderstanding of our specialness — all of which help us think that we are somehow absolute and separate to (not interdependent with) other life-forms and somehow, uniquely, not subject to Earth’s capacity to support complex, large life-forms like us.\\n\\nHumans need to learn to distinguish concepts, abstractions and beliefs from the inexpressibly infinite nature of the universe. We need to come back down to Earth and understand our rightful place in it — not above it.\\n\\n![Raphael, from “The School of Athens”, 1511 CE, Wikipedia, public domain.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*As_V1mBSuWJPyUVxwaqKVw.jpeg)\\n\\n**“Socrates explains how the philosopher is like a prisoner who is freed from the cave and comes to understand that the shadows on the wall are not reality at all. A philosopher aims to understand and perceive the higher levels of reality. However, the other inmates of the cave do not even desire to leave their prison, for they know no better life …[\\\\[10\\\\]](#_ftn10) For that reason, the world of the forms is the real world, like [sunlight](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Allegory_of_the_cave), while the sensible world is only imperfectly or partially real, like [shadows](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Allegory_of_the_cave).”**[\\\\[11\\\\]](#_ftn11)\\n\\nAristotle disagreed with Plato, focusing instead on the specific features of nature and natural ‘real’ objects,[\\\\[12\\\\]](#_ftn12) that is, concrete particulars. Aristotle was therefore an early empiricist who perceived ‘tableness’ or ‘treeness’ as something that is a part of each actual object.\\n\\nThat is, each particular tree or table is not an imperfect projection of an ideal form. Each actual table or tree is just one of all of the objects (past, present and future) within the total set of almost-infinite actual tables or trees. All real tables or trees can be described as being within that ‘abstract’ set, but the abstraction is one of usefulness, not truth.\\n\\n**“I’ve seen Plato’s cups and table, but not his cupness and tableness.”**\\n\\n(*Diogenes of Sinope*)[\\\\[13\\\\]](#_ftn13)\\n\\nBenedictus Spinoza takes the concept of individual material forms versus the energy from which forms arise to a higher level in his *Ethics*.[\\\\[14\\\\]](#_ftn14) Individual bodies having the same essential attributes (what they exist as) are not separate but are all part of one substance. He calls each individual manifestation a ‘mode’ of that unitary substance, having a difference in extension (physical configuration) only.\\n\\nEach individual body has an essence which is its inertia to destruction of its parts, its persistence of shape or form over time that requires energy to maintain or dissipate — for example, ‘tableness’ or ‘animalness’. For Spinoza, the ultimate reality (being God or the nature of things) is not material; it has no physical location within space-time.\\n\\nIn respect of the difference between things and the ideas of things (such as a ‘table’ and ‘tableness’), Spinoza contends that these have different chains of causation (parallel streams) in thought or conception and in extension, but they are really just different attributes manifesting the same immaterial reality.\\n\\nSpinoza, following a long tradition going back to Aristotle, also believed that space is not an independent substance or field (i.e., a physical container for bodies), but that it is part of the extension of things (the space can only be defined in respect of the bodies within it).\\n\\nSpinoza’s greatest claim, and one that people most resist, for obvious reasons, is that there is no such thing as free will — that even if everything is not pre-determinable, it is causally necessary. This is a fundamental problem of morality and an open issue in physics.\\n\\nIt is yet another of life’s great examples of the hypocrisy of religions that Spinoza was cast out of Christian and Judaic religious communities as being an atheist.\\n\\nHe is one of the purer theorists about the nature of body, energy, matter and truth — a philosopher who sought to demonstrate that all life-forms are just manifestations of one body, and that the one body is that of God or nature.[\\\\[15\\\\]](#_ftn15) In doing so, Spinoza obviously pointed out the absurdity of the practice of religions in Europe, which were based primarily on unquestioning subservience and superstition as well as manufacturing and keeping influence, money and power — and not the underlying oneness of all life and the beauty of the concept of nature and God.\\n\\n**“For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body — Jews or Greeks, slaves or free — and all were made to drink of one Spirit. For the body does not consist of one member but of many … And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body … If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell? … As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.”**\\n\\n(*St. Paul the Apostle*)[\\\\[16\\\\]](#_ftn16)\\n\\nSpinoza was demonised and hounded for pointing out what is common between us all and in making clear the blatant corruption of his time. He is a *Homo sapiens* to be honoured and remembered. Thankfully, God blessed Spinoza in his apparent ability to take hardships well. His belief in necessity (including of suffering), that God was in everything and in the lack of free will must have helped greatly.\\n\\n**“Only by breaking free of this superstition \\\\[theological doctrine\\\\] will we be able to seek true understanding of the universe, thereby gaining true insight into God … He requires us to recognise no difference between God and nature, and to understand all things as part of God … his work \\\\[was\\\\] banned for over a hundred years after it was written.”**\\n\\n(*Beth Lord*)[\\\\[17\\\\]](#_ftn17)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nLanguage is a communal tool that suffers from very significant compression and loss of fidelity in its use to express the ineffable, giving rise to many of the problems we face when seeking to get at the root of matters.[\\\\[18\\\\]](#_ftn18)\\n\\nLanguage requires significant ‘unpacking’ and interpretation at the receiving end of any communication and great care by the sender — given all that is not said but that it is necessarily implied in each word or concept.\\n\\n**“Words strain, / Crack and sometimes break, under the burden, / Under the tension, slip, slide, perish,/ Will not stay still.”**\\n\\nT. S. Eliot [\\\\[19\\\\]](#_ftn19)\\n\\nOne of the reasons van Gogh features so heavily in this book is that he represents one of those very rare souls: able to extend the boundaries of the language of painting (colour, texture and form) in an attempt to represent nature that we can see and what we can (sometimes) feel but cannot see.\\n\\nAs an extraordinarily compassionate artist, van Gogh had no desire to render a simplistic, lower-dimensional picture of a tree which we could better see with our own eyes. He was trying to help us glimpse at the much richer life-force that animates the tree and all other life-forms — the invisible energy and visible form combined. His brush strokes, so rich and heavy, magically conjuring the hidden life-force into being.\\n\\nVan Gogh learned the language of trees and it is without words.\\n\\n![Vincent Van Gogh, “The Mulberry Tree”, 1889 CE, Wikipedia, public domain.\\\\[20\\\\]](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*yItB8A5zmp1gZD69nCVsAA.jpeg)\\n\\nIt takes a kind of ‘magic’ to do this. For this reason, great artists, scientists and holy people seem like beings from outer space[\\\\[21\\\\]](#_ftn21) or the future. In the modern world we have lost sight of the meaning of the word technology (from Greek *techne*, “art, skill, cunning of hand”, and *logos*, “to speak of”), assuming that it can only apply to things like computers, machines and industrial inventions.\\n\\nTechnology is much broader than this. It is the systematic practice (application) of arts, crafts and knowledge — science in its broadest sense.\\n\\n**“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”**\\n\\n(*Arthur C.

We have forgotten to respect, maintain and seek to evolve our technology of the mind. In many ways, we have gone backwards.\\n\\nWe cannot compress the universe’s infinite nature[\\\\[25\\\\]](#_ftn25) into finite dimensional space (words, numbers or pictures) without losing much of the meaning of what we are trying to express — or risking confusion between the expression and the thing it is trying to express.\\n\\n**“It’s like a finger pointing away to the moon. Don’t concentrate on the finger or you will miss all that heavenly glory.”**\\n\\n(*Bruce Lee*)[\\\\[26\\\\]](#_ftn26)\\n\\nThe cultural technology used by humans (but which they did not invent) that gets closest to expressing the truly ineffable is music. Mathematicians may make a similar claim.\\n\\nPerhaps it is the underlying abstract mathematical nature of harmonies, the precise interrelations between frequencies (the logic of music) coupled with the emotion of the sounds created by such imperfect vessels (animals and their instruments used to make sounds). Perhaps it is also the lack of a specific compression (encoding) and interpretation (decoding) process.\\n\\n![Peter Pink-Howitt \\\\[27\\\\]](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\\\*Vr13gyBySfocNr6rkhJ3GQ.png?&size=medium)\\n\\nMusic allows for lossless communication[\\\\[28\\\\]](#_ftn28) between composer, lyricist and listener — albeit music and maths are still just a more or less useful finite reduction or representation of the ultimately infinitely unsayable.
