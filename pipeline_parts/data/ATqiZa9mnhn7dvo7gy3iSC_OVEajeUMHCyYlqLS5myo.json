"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Business elites must not only have strong market ability, but also be able to deal with the cronies around the boss! Let me tell you two historical stories. Heroes are born in troubled times, and if they want to make contributions to protect the country and the people, they have to use the rules of troubled times.\\n\\nAs a capable person, if he only manages his own business and does not manage the cronies around his boss, the outcome will not be great.\\n\\nLi Mu, Zhao Zhiliang is also general. Strike the Xiongnu in the north, fight against the Qin in the west. Li Mu did not embezzle soldiers, nor searched the people. Even the salaries and goods granted to him by King Zhao were distributed to his subordinates. Kill a few cows a day, have a meal with the soldiers, share the joys and sorrows, without any official pretensions.\\n\\nLi Mu never indulged in Zhao Wang's cronies, and Zhao Wang's cronies spread rumors, saying that Li Mu was going to betray the state of Zhao. King Zhao secretly arranged a trap to kill Li Mu, Qin general Wang Jian took the opportunity to attack Zhao, defeated the Zhao army, and captured Handan, captured King Zhao and his cronies, and the State of Zhao was destroyed.\\n\\n164 Entrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs\\n\\nLi Mu, the unbeaten star of his life, died in the hands of the emperor and ministers of the State of Zhao, whom he vowed to defend to the death. His innocence was killed, and his descendants all sighed, so that Ma Qian of the Taishi Company righteously scolded King Zhao for \\\"his mother is also a prostitute.\\\" \\\"It means that Zhao Wang's mother is a prostitute.\\n\\nQi Jiguang, a famous anti-Japanese general in the Ming Dynasty, was much smarter. Qi Jiguang once used a lot of money to buy a beautiful woman called \\\"Dian Jin Ji\\\" as a gift, and sent his younger brother to give it to him.\\n\\nTo the important ministers in the DPRK. In \\\"Book of Zhang Juzheng\\\", the various precious gifts that Qi Jiguang sent to the door are recorded one by one. The richness of the gifts is amazing.\\n\\nBut in any case, Qi Jiguang will always be a hero in my mind. I like his bravery, his extraordinary victory, his perseverance, and his celebrity, so he can live to be more than 60 years old in that era.\",\"timestamp\":1634798613,\"title\":\"Business elites need not only strong market capabilities\"},\"digest\":\"ZQeVOeB9YDWPP9rvYCa-lE0xIsnpPsnRjrGyLHlnK7w\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"37D2I2_JL9RU9VDLxpH-LIPBFUdbghH4V-VYD_tWWWaThNofofLAQg4Af72WR87Mef44GqqY-C_UFpDPK1ozMg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ZQeVOeB9YDWPP9rvYCa-lE0xIsnpPsnRjrGyLHlnK7w\"}"
