"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"First: Grayscale continues to increase its holdings of FIL, and currently Grayscale increases its total holdings of Grayscale Funds by 29.792 billion;\\nSecond: FIL consensus has exceeded 50 times that of BTC that year, and there must be better development in the future.\\nThird: IPFS is the first and only project in the blockchain industry to implement distributed storage, and FIL is its only official incentive currency.\\nFourth: The distributed storage market is a global rigid demand. People in any corner of the world are creating new data every day. When there is data, storage is required. Storage is rigid demand. The volume of this rigid demand market is already trillions, FIL The market will be all walks of life around the world, because all industries need high-quality and low-cost storage costs.\\nFifth: FIL's storage algorithm has a destruction mechanism, its circulation will decrease, and the value of FIL will only get higher and higher. Coupled with Filecoin's high-quality mechanism, everyone can deploy Filecoin storage servers.\\n\\nSince Filecoin requires pledged coins, pledged coins account for most of the investment in Filecoin servers and will be returned after expiration. The most important thing is that gas has dropped significantly. Therefore, the actual input cost is very low, coupled with policy support, global storage needs , Expectations of future prospects, therefore, there will be a demand for pledged coins in the market, which is far greater than the release of produced coins, and supply exceeds demand, which will push up the price of coins. Nowadays, driven by the country's “new infrastructure”, huge dividends of the times will be created.\\n\\nAs a leader in distributed storage technology, IPFS is the foundation of Web3.0. FIL has received strong support from relevant departments and is committed to the development of distributed storage technology. With the deployment of IPFS distributed storage by major Internet giants, the value of IPFS in the future is beyond doubt. With the gradual growth, stability and security of the Filecoin network, more and more traditional storage services will be transformed into low-cost, safer and more efficient decentralized distributed storage (IPFS) in the future Internet industry.\\n\\nAs an important infrastructure of Web3.0, distributed storage and decentralized cloud computing will accelerate the digital transformation process of related industries, build new business scenarios, and promote profound changes in the economy and society. From the perspective of the entire distributed storage track, Filecoin has a first-mover advantage. In the process of steady progress in ecological construction, more and more organizations and institutions are accessing its network. If the later development is smooth, Filecoin is expected to achieve a larger scale of application landing.\\n\\nIn the future, after the commercial application of Filecoin is launched, users who need to store data must first purchase FIL to pay for the storage and traffic costs of using the Filecoin system. FIL in circulation flows from node participants to users, and then from users to node participants, reflecting the circulation value of FIL. Now that FIL is still in the dividend phase, it is a good time to take advantage of the fact that the currency price has not yet exploded, the packaging cost is low, and the future growth is considerable!\",\"timestamp\":1634581730,\"title\":\"Will FIL go up?\"},\"digest\":\"Egs1xoL7ozX1mRLNlOcf91CV_JJX-NRIt5LtjmU7c-s\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0DEA89a6C9c14aBFc0f3d048E29084c0b9841B73\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rl_IUQIwglkCjseoszPJm8UOYWs8ZV6qkqB7hTxlZt0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"tGlwGIOL0xYRdqzD2qErzSHiEXuEil-lE9nNDd7Vz-0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Ytn1GqTGvuKI4nELHBMO5esfcS0c1JmbL3iAZNACWdwdxLwTxOsjQL-IjTg7y2LgGkLutcneida9qAKWqWE8Dw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x818d0ded58d1e7a5c9ab8774fc5f1e28b097aba4a36362b02d21d8f150b3c7760d19333b3c54158bfd5d76f32aa4be589eb71dd8770373dcb1e7691c86f39e7f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rl_IUQIwglkCjseoszPJm8UOYWs8ZV6qkqB7hTxlZt0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"tGlwGIOL0xYRdqzD2qErzSHiEXuEil-lE9nNDd7Vz-0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Egs1xoL7ozX1mRLNlOcf91CV_JJX-NRIt5LtjmU7c-s\"}"
