"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"hat he and I became dependent upon each other in many ways. \\\"Events, into which I shall not go, had made his life very difficult and complicated.  And he who had given so much friendship to so many people needed a little friendship in return, and perhaps, too, he needed for a time to live in a house whose master and mistress loved each other, and where there were children.  Before he came that first year our house had no name.  Now it is called \\\\`Let's Pretend.'\\n\\n\\\"Now the chimney in the living-room draws, but in those first days of the built-over house it didn't.  At least, it didn't draw all the time, but we pretended that it did, and with much pretense came faith.  From the fireplace that smoked to the serious things of life we extended our pretendings, until real troubles went down before them--down and out.\\n\\n\\\"It was one of Aiken's very best winters, and the earliest spring I ever lived anywhere.  R. H. D. came shortly after Christmas.  The spiraeas were in bloom, and the monthly roses; you could always find a sweet violet or two somewhere in the yard; here and there splotches of deep pink against gray cabin walls proved that precocious peach-trees were in bloom.  It never rained.  At night it was cold enough for fires.  In the middle of the day it was hot.  The wind never blew, and every morning we had a four for tennis and every afternoon we rode in the woods.  And every night we sat in front of the fire (that didn't smoke because of pretending) and talked until the next morning.\\n\\n\\\"He was one of those rarely gifted men who find their chiefest pleasure not in looking backward or forward, but in what is going on at the moment.  Weeks did not have to pass before it was forced upon his knowledge that Tuesday, the fourteenth (let us say), had been a good Tuesday.  He knew it the moment he waked at 7 A. M., and perceived the Tuesday sunshine making patterns of bright light upon the floor.  The sunshine rejoiced him and the knowledge that even before breakfast there was vouchsafed to him a whole hour of life.  That day began with attentions to his physical well-being.  There were exercises conducted with great vigor and rejoicing, followed by a tub, artesian cold, and a loud and joyous singing of ballads.\\n\\n\\\"The singing over, silence reigned.  But if you had listened at his door you must have heard a pen going, swiftly and boldly.  He was hard at work, doing unto others what others had done unto him.  You were a stranger to him; some magazine had accepted a story that you had written and published it.  R. H. D. had found something to like and admire in that story (very little perhaps), and it was his duty and pleasure to tell you so.  If he had liked the story very much he would send you instead of a note a telegram.  Or it might be that you had drawn a picture, or, as a cub reporter, had shown golden promise in a half column of unsigned print, R. H. D. would find you out, and find time to praise you and help you.  So it was that when he emerged from his room at sharp eight o'clock, he was wide-awake and happy and hungry, and whistled and double-shuffled with his feet, out of excessive energy, and carried in his hands a whole sheaf of notes and letters and telegrams.\\n\\n\\\"Breakfast with him was not the usual American breakfast, a sullen, dyspeptic gathering of persons who only the night before had rejoiced in each other's society.  With him it was the time when the mind is, or ought to be, at its best, the body at its freshest and hungriest.  Discussions of the latest plays and novels, the doings and undoings of statesmen, laughter and sentiment--to him, at breakfast, these things were as important as sausages and thick cream.\\n\\n\\\"Breakfast over, there was no dawdling and putting off of the day's work (else how, at eleven sharp, could tennis be played with a free conscience?).  Loving, as he did, everything connected with a newspaper, he would now pass by those on the hall-table with never so much as a wistful glance, and hurry to his workroom.\\n\\n\\\"He wrote sitting down.  He wrote standing up.  And, almost you may say, he wrote walking up and down.  Some people, accustomed to the delicious ease and clarity of his style, imagine that he wrote very easily.  He did and he didn't.  Letters, easy, clear, to the point, and gorgeously human, flowed from him without let or hindrance.  That masterpiece of corresponding, the German March through Brussels, was probably written almost as fast as he could talk (next to Phillips Brooks, he was the fastest talker I ever heard), but when it came to fiction he had no facility at all.  Perhaps I should say that he held in contempt any facility that he may have had.  It was owing to his incomparable energy and Joblike patience that he ever gave us any fiction at all.  Every phrase in his fiction was, of all the myriad phrases he could think of, the fittest in his relentless judgment to survive.  Phrases, paragraphs, pages, whole stories even, were written over and over again.  He worked upon a principle of elimination.  If he wished to describe an automobile turning in at a gate, he made first a long and elaborate description from which there  was omitted no detail, which the most observant pair of eyes  in Christendom had ever noted with reference to just such  a turning.  Thereupon he would begin a process of omitting one by one those details which he had been at such pains to recall; and after each omission he would ask himself, \\\\`Does the picture remain?'  If it did not, he restored the detail which he had just omitted, and experimented with the sacrifice of some other, and so on, and so on, until after Herculean labor there remained for the reader one of those swiftly flashed ice-clear pictures (complete in every detail) with which his tales and romances are so delightfully and continuously adorned.\\n\\n\\\"But it is quarter to eleven, and this being a time of holiday, R. H. D. emerges from his workroom happy to think that he has placed one hundred and seven words between himself and the wolf who hangs about every writer's door.  He isn't satisfied with those hundred and seven words.  He never was in the least satisfied with anything that he wrote, but he has searched his mind and his conscience and he believes that under the circumstances they are the very best that he can do.  Anyway, they can stand in their present order until--after lunch.\\n\\n\\\"A sign of his youth was the fact that to the day of his death he had denied himself the luxury and slothfulness of habits.  I have never seen him smoke automatically as most men do.  He had too much respect for his own powers of enjoyment and for the sensibilities, perhaps, of the best Havana tobacco.  At a time of his own deliberate choosing, often after many hours of hankering and renunciation, he smoked his cigar.  He smoked it with delight, with a sense of being rewarded, and he used all the smoke there was in it.\\n\\n\\\"He dearly loved the best food, the best champagne, and the best Scotch whiskey.  But these things were friends to him, and not enemies.  He had toward food and drink the continental attitude; namely, that quality is far more important than quantity; and he got his exhilaration from the fact that he was drinking champagne and not from the champagne.  Perhaps I shall do well to say that on questions of right and wrong he had a will of iron.  All his life he moved resolutely in whichever direction his conscience pointed; and although that ever present and never obtrusive conscience of his made mistakes of judgment now and then, as must all consciences, I think it can never once have tricked him into any action that was impure or unclean.  Some critics maintain that the heroes and heroines of his books are impossibly pure and innocent young people.  R. H. D. never called upon his characters for any trait of virtue, or renunciation, or self-mastery of which his own life could not furnish examples.\\\"\\n\\nIn June of 1912 Richard reported the Republican convention at Chicago.  Shortly after this, on July 8, he married at Greenwich, Connecticut, Miss Elizabeth Genevieve McEvoy, known on the stage as Bessie McCoy, with whom he had first become acquainted in 1908 after the estrangement from his wife.\\n\\nRichard and his wife made their home at Crossroads, where he devoted most of his working hours to the writing of short stories.  In August of that year my brother, accompanied by his wife, returned to Chicago to report the Progressive convention.  During the year 1913 he wrote and produced the farce \\\"Who's Who,\\\" of which William Collier was the star, and in the fall of the same year spent a month in Cuba, with Augustus Thomas, where they produced a film version of \\\"Soldiers of Fortune.\\\" In referring to this trip, Thomas wrote at the time of Richard's death:\\n\\n\\\"In 1914 a motion-picture company arranged to make a feature film of the play, and Dick and I went with their outfit to Santiago de Cuba, where, twenty years earlier, he had found the inspiration for his story and out of which city and its environs he had fashioned his supposititious republic of Olancho.  On that trip he was the idol of the company.  With the men in the smoking-room of the steamer there were the numberless playful stories, in the rough, of the experiences on all five continents and seven seas that were the backgrounds of his published tales.\\n\\n\\\"At Santiago, if an official was to be persuaded to consent to some unprecedented seizure of the streets, or a diplomat invoked for the assistance of the Army or the Navy, it was the experience and good judgment of Dick Davis that controlled the task.  In the field there were his helpful suggestions of work and make up to the actors, and on the boat and train and in hotel and camp the lady members met in him an easy courtesy and understanding at once fraternal and impersonal.\\n\\n\\\"The element that he could not put into the account and which is particularly pertinent to this page, is the author of \\\\`Soldiers of Fortune' as he revealed himself to me both with intention and unconsciously in the presence of the familiar scenes.\\n\\n\\\"For three weeks, with the exception of one or two occasions when some local dignitary captured the revisiting lion, he and I spent our evenings together at a cafe table overlooking \\\\`The Great Square,' which he sketches so deftly in its atmosphere when Clay and the Langhams and Stuart dine there.  At one end of the plaza the President's band was playing native waltzes that came throbbing through the trees and beating softly above the rustling skirts and clinking spurs of the senoritas and officers sweeping by in two opposite circles around the edges of the tessellated pavements.  Above the palms around the square arose the dim, white facade of the Cathedral, with the bronze statue of Anduella the liberator of Olancho, who answered with his upraised arm and cocked hat the cheers of an imaginary populace.\\n\\n\\\"Twenty years had gone by since Dick had received the impression that wrote those lines, and now sometimes after dinner half a long cigar would burn out as he mused over the picture and the dreams that had gone between.  From one long silence he said:  \\\\`I think I'll come back here this winter and bring Mrs. Davis with me--stay a couple of months.'  What a fine compliment to a wife to have the thought of her and that plan emerge from that deep and romantic background.\\n\\n\\\"The picture people began their film with a showing of the `mountains which jutted out into the ocean and suggested roughly the five knuckles of a giant's hand clenched and lying flat upon the surface of the water.'  That formation of the sea wall is just outside of Santiago.  `The waves tunnelled their way easily enough until they ran up against those five mountains and then they had to fall back.' How natural for one of us to be unimpressed by such a feature of the landscape and yet how characteristic of Dick Davis to see the elemental fight that it recorded and get the hint for the whole of the engineering struggle that is so much of his book.\\n\\n\\\"We went over those mountains together, where two decades before he had planted his banner of romance.  We visited the mines and the railroads and everywhere found some superintendent or foreman or engineer who remembered Davis.  He had guessed at nothing.  Everywhere he had overlaid the facts with adventure and with beauty, but he had been on sure footing all the time.  His prototype of MacWilliams was dead.  Together we visited the wooden cross with which the miners had marked his grave.\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX VERA CRUZ AND THE GREAT WAR\\n\\nLate in April, 1914, when war between the United States and Mexico seemed inevitable Richard once more left the peace and content of Crossroads and started for Vera Cruz, arriving there on April 29.  He had arranged to act as correspondent for a syndicate of newspapers, and as he had for long been opposed to the administration's policy of \\\"watchful waiting\\\" was greatly disappointed on his arrival at the border to learn of the President's plan of mediation.  He wrote to his wife:\\n\\nCRUZ, April 24, 1914. DEAREST ONE:\\n\\nWe left today at 5.30.  It was a splendid scene, except for the children crying, and the wives of the officers and enlisted men trying not to cry.  I got a stateroom to myself.  With the electric fan on and the airport open, it is about as cool as a blast furnace.  But I was given a seat on the left of General Funston, who is commanding this brigade, and the other officers at the table are all good fellows.  As long as I was going, I certainly had luck in getting away as sharply as I did.  One day's delay would have made me miss this transport, which will be the first to land troops.\\n\\nApril 25th.\\n\\nA dreadnaught joined us today, the Louisiana.  I wirelessed the Admiral asking permission to send a press despatch via his battleship, and he was polite in reply, but firm.  He said \\\"No.\\\"  There are four transports and three torpedo boats and the battleship.  We go very slowly, because we must keep up with one of the troop ships with broken engines.  At night it is very pretty seeing the ships in line, and the torpedo boats winking their signals at each other.  I am writing all the time or reading up things about the army I forget and getting the new dope.  Also I am brushing up my Spanish.  Jack London is on board, and three other correspondents, two of whom I have met on other trips, and one \\\"cub\\\" correspondent.  He was sitting beside London and me busily turning out copy, and I asked him what he found to write about.  He said, \\\"Well, maybe I see things you fellows don't see.\\\"  What he meant was that what was old to us was new to him, but he got guyed unmercifully.\\n\\nApril 27, 1914.\\n\\nThe censor reads all I write, and so do some half-dozen Mexican cable clerks and 60 (sixty) correspondents.  So when I cable \\\"love,\\\" it MEANS devotion, adoration, and worship; loyalty, fidelity and truth, wanting you, needing you, unhappy for you.  It means ALL that.\\n\\nRICHARD.\\n\\nVERA CRUZ, April 30, 1914.\\n\\nThis heat--humid and moist--would sweat water out of a chilled steel safe; so imagine what it does to me with all the awful winter's accumulation of fat.  I hate to say it, but I LIKE these Mexicans--much better than Cubans, or Central Americans.  They are human, kindly; it is only the politicians and bandits like Villa who give them a bad name.  But, though they ought to hate us, whenever I stop to ask my way they invite me to come in and have \\\"coffee\\\" and say, \\\"My house is yours, senor,\\\" which certainly is kind after people have taken your town away from you and given you another flag and knocked your head off if you did not salute it.  I now have a fine room.  The Navy moved out today and I got the room of the paymaster.  It faces the plaza and the cathedral.  I burned a candle there today for our soon meeting.  The priests all had run away, so I had to hunt up the candle, and pay the money into the box marked for that purpose, but the Lord does not run away, and He will see we soon meet.\\n\\nMay 2nd.\\n\\nYesterday I went out on the train that brings in refugees and saw the Mexicans.  They had on three thousand cartridges, much hair, hats as high as church steeples, and lots of dirt.  The Selig Moving Picture folks took many pictures of us and several \\\"stills,\\\" in which the war correspondent was shown giving cigarettes to the brigands.  Also, I had a wonderful bath in the ocean off the aviation camp.  I borrowed a suit from one of the aviators, and splashed and swam around for an hour.  My! it was good.  It reminded me of my dear Bessie, because the last time I was in the ocean was with her.\\n\\nMaybe you know what is going on, but we do not.  So I just hustle around all day trying to find news as I did when I was a reporter.  It is hot enough here even for me, and I have lost about eight pounds of that fat I laid in during our North Pole winter!\\n\\nVFRA CRUZ-May 8, 1914.\\n\\nDEAR CHAS.:\\n\\nToday, when Wilson ordered Huerta not to blockade Tampico which was an insult to Mediators and the act of a bully and a coward, AND a declaration of war, we all got on our ponies to \\\"advance.\\\"  Then came word Huerta would not blockade.  It is like living in a mad house.  We all are hoping mediators refuse to continue negotiations.  If they have self respect that is what they will do.  Tonight if Wilson and Huerta ran for President, Huerta would get all our votes.  He may be an uneducated Indian, but at least he is a man.  However, that makes no never mind so far as to my getting back.  The reason I cannot return is because I have \\\"credentials.\\\"  It is not that they want ME here, but they want my credentials here.  The administration is using, as I see it, the privilege of having a correspondent at the front as a club.  It says until war is declared it won't issue any more.  So those syndicates who have no correspondent and the papers forming them, are afraid to attack or to criticise the administration for fear they will be blacklisted.  And those who have a correspondent with his three thousand dollar signed and sealed pass in his pocket aren't taking any chance on losing him.  So, I see before me an endless existence in Vera Cruz.\\n\\nRICHARD.\\n\\nOn May 7 Richard started for Mexico City where, if possible, he intended to interview Huerta.  At Pasco de Macho he was arrested, but afterward was allowed to proceed to Mexico City.  Here he was again arrested, and without being allowed to interview Huerta was sent back the day after his arrival to Vera Cruz.\\n\\nOf this Vera Cruz experience John N. Wheeler, a friend of Richard's and the manager of the syndicate which sent him to Mexico, wrote the following after my brother's death:\\n\\n\\\"Richard Harding Davis went to Vera Cruz for a newspaper syndicate, and after the first sharp engagement in the Mexican seaport there was nothing for the correspondent to do but kill time on that barren, low lying strip of Gulf coast, hemmed in on all sides by Mexicans and the sea, and time is hard to kill there.  Yet there was a story to be got, but it required nerve to go after it.\\n\\n\\\"In Mexico City was Gen. Huerta, the dictator of Mexico.  If a newspaper could get an interview with him it would be a \\\\`scoop,' but the work was inclined to be dangerous for the interviewer, since Americans were being murdered rather profusely in Mexico at the time in spite of the astute assurances of Mr. Bryan, and no matter how substantial his references the correspondent was likely to meet some temperamental and touchy soldier with a loaded rifle who would shoot first and afterward carry his papers to some one who could read them.\\n\\n\\\"One of the newspapers taking the stories by Mr. Davis from the syndicate had a staff man at Vera Cruz as well, and thought to `scoop' the country by sending this representative to see Huerta, in this way `beating' even the other subscribers to the Davis service.  An interview in Mexico City was consequently arranged and the staff man was cabled and asked to make the trip.  He promptly cabled his refusal, this young man preferring to take no such chances.  It was then suggested that Mr. Davis should attempt it.  By pulling some wires at Washington it was arranged, through the Brazilian and English Ambassadors at the Mexican capital, for\\n\\nMr. Davis to interview President Huerta, with safe conduct (this being about as safe as nonskid tires) to Mexico City.  Mr. Davis was asked if he would make the trip.  In less than two hours back came this laconic cable:\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Leaving Mexico City to-morrow afternoon at 3 o'clock.'\\n\\n\\\"That was Richard Harding Davis--no hesitancy, no vacillation.  He was always willing to go, to take any chance, to endure discomfort and all if he had a fighting opportunity to get the news.  The public now knows that Davis was arrested on this trip, that Huerta refused to make good on the interview, and that it was only through the good efforts of the British Ambassador at the Mexican capital he was released.  But Davis went.\\n\\n\\\"There was an echo of this journey to the Mexican capital several months later after the conflict in Europe had been raging for a few weeks.  Lord Kitchener announced at one stage of the proceedings he would permit a single correspondent, selected and indorsed by the United States Government, to accompany the British army to the front.  Of course, all the swarm of American correspondents in London at the time were eager for the desirable indorsement.  Mr. Davis cabled back the conditions of his acceptance.  Immediately Secretary of State Bryan was called in Washington on the long-distance telephone.\\n\\n\\\"`Lord Kitchener has announced,' the Secretary of State was told, `that he will accept one correspondent with the British troops in the field, if he is indorsed by the United States Government.  Richard Harding Davis, who is in London, represents a string of the strongest newspapers in the United States for this syndicate, and we desire the indorsement of the State Department so he can obtain this appointment.'\\n\\n\\\"`Mr.  Davis made us some trouble when he was in Mexico,' answered Mr. Bryan.  `He proceeded to the Mexican capital without our consent and I will have to consider the matter very carefully before indorsing him.  His Mexican escapade caused us some diplomatic efforts and embarrassment.'  (What the Secretary of State did to bring about Mr. Davis's release on the occasion of his Mexican arrest is still a secret of the Department.)\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Bryan did not indorse Mr. Davis finally, which was well, since Lord Kitchener of Khartum kept the selected list of correspondents loafing around London on one pretext or another so long they all became disgusted and went without an official pass from \\\\`K. of K.'  As soon as Mr. Davis was told he would not be appointed he proceeded to Belgium and returned some of the most thrilling stories written on this conflict at great personal risk.\\\"\\n\\nMay 13, 1914. MY DEAREST ONE:\\n\\nDO NOT BLAME me for this long delay in writing.  God knows I wanted every day to \\\"talk\\\" to you.  But we were on the \\\"suspect\\\" list, and to make even a note was risky.  The way I did it was to exclaim over the beauty of some flower or tree, and then ask the Mexican nearest me to write the name of it HIMSELF in MY notebook.  Then I would say, \\\"In English that would be----\\\" and I would pretend to write beside it the English equivalent, but really would write the word that was the key to what I wished to remember.  So, you see, a letter at that rate of progress was impossible.  It was a case of \\\"Can't get away to cable you today; police won't let me!\\\"  However, we are all safe at home again.  As a matter of fact, I had a most exciting time, and am dying to tell you the \\\"insie\\\" story.  But the one I sent the papers must serve.  I promised myself I would give the FIRST soldier, marine and sailor I met on returning a cigar, and the first sailor was the CHAPLAIN OF THE FLEET, Father Reany.  But he took the cigar and gave me his blessing.  I am now burning candles to St. Rita.  What worried me the MOST was how worried YOU would be; and I begged Palmer not to send the story of our first arrest.  But other people told of it, and he had to forward it.  You certainly made the wires BURN! and had the army guessing.  One officer said to me, \\\"I'm awfully sorry to see you back.  If you'd only have stayed in jail another day your wife would have had us all on our way to Mexico.\\\"  And the censor said, \\\"My God! I'm glad you're safe!  Your wife has MADE OUR LIVES HELL!\\\"  And quite right, too, bless you!  None of us knows anything, but it looks to me that NOTHING will induce Wilson to go to war.  But the Mexicans think we ARE at war, and act accordingly.  They may bring on a conflict.  That is why I am making ready in case we advance and that is why I cabled today for the rest of my kit.  I have a fine little pony, and a little messenger boy who speaks Spanish, to look after the horse, and me.\\n\\nAnd now, as to your LETTERS, they came to-day, five of them, COUNT 'EM, and the pictures did make me laugh.  I showed those of the soldier commandeering the vegetables to Funston and he laughed.  And, I did love the flowers you sent no matter HOW homesick they made me!  (Oh).  I do not want a camera.\\n\\nI have one, and those fancy cameras I don't understand.\\n\\n[ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/33](ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/33)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639126684,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"It was in our little house at Aiken, in South Carolina, that he was with us most and we learned to know him best\"},\"digest\":\"z9X1249WmxQ7Xnx3hN0bZOhN5-MUCWXA32Z2BW3hVXw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6961235d2e95818F7a1E230634bC24de80Bd6f6a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0Yn-ZRbzDn7Xn6Rf0cPcqjj7eEiUFKpDAG1m0ctzW2E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"53rNAtzceMHntVtDoiV_ZDK8oEOj262IhL5mlgvYWp4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ZTUhteP0gMOTCqDg_6PQSolpPkWydoHcuoiAP_v6d7-6HuozY9recVHmi1HeMQ3HzAIztnhsCfSDNqVuk3_uxw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb4976a16ad9f8d3b5e8295574cacf98e4697636ac773549563e0b0b44a6efe9f5fecae2f08530689b7bdf2a00599f0c8895a1c8fb4e177b71d9cd46a0ee2d4ca1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0Yn-ZRbzDn7Xn6Rf0cPcqjj7eEiUFKpDAG1m0ctzW2E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"53rNAtzceMHntVtDoiV_ZDK8oEOj262IhL5mlgvYWp4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"z9X1249WmxQ7Xnx3hN0bZOhN5-MUCWXA32Z2BW3hVXw\"}"
