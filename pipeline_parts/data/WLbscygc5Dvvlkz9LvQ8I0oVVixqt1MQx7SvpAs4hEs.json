"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"***According to the companies involved in the transaction, SoftBank Group Corp. (9984.TO) will invest US$150 million in a Korean Yuan universe platform. The platform has accumulated a large number of young female users by selling high-end fashion products with 3D images.***\\n\\nAccording to a report from the Wall Street Journal on December 1, South Korea’s Yuan universe platform Zepeto has received a US$150 million investment from Japan’s SoftBank Group. This investment by SoftBank is part of the B round of financing, bringing the value of Zepeto, the meta universe platform, to more than $1 billion, making it one of the most important unicorns in the meta universe field.\\n\\nZepeto, a subsidiary of aver Corp., is Asia's most popular meta-universe platform, with approximately 2 million daily active users. Users access the platform through a mobile application. Users scan photos, build their own digital avatars, and then wander around in the virtual world. Users can use voice chat and roam in virtual spaces, such as in haunted houses, school classrooms or garden wedding scenes.\\n\\nEven by the standards of the nascent meta-universe, Zepeto is niche. Roblox Corp., which runs one of the most popular meta-universe platforms, said that as of the third quarter, its platform had more than 47 million daily active users. But about 70% of Zepeto's users are women, between the ages of 13 and 24-this kind of user structure is rare in the meta-universe domain dominated by older male players.\\n\\nZepeto's success story also attracted high-end fashion brands such as Ralph Lauren, Gucci and Dior. These three high-end fashion series all released virtual clothing series on Zepeto, and Gucci even launched a virtual item promotion space there. In addition, some celebrities are also using South Korea's Meta universe platform. For example, American singer and actor Selena Gomez and popular K-pop girl group Blackpink sell exclusive merchandise and organize fan meetings on Zepeto.\\n\\nZepeto's rapid development is closely related to the current meta-universe wave sweeping the world. Although the Metaverse is still in its early stage of development, South Korea has disclosed its ambitions to deploy the Metaverse. In the future, Seoul may become the first metropolis to enter the Metaverse. Starting from 2022, it will invest 3.31 million U.S. dollars (approximately 3.9 billion won) to build a meta-universe city and provide various public services and cultural activities in meta-universe.\\n\\nIn South Korea, not only the industry is vigorously exploring the field of meta-universe, but also funds are very favoring this sector. Fans of meta-universe concept stocks have discovered that South Korea is the preferred Asian market for betting on this technology because it has a large number of tradable products and stocks to choose from. In October alone, South Korea launched four new ETFs focusing on Metaverse, namely KB, Samsung, Mirae Asset and NH-Amundi, the four major asset management companies in South Korea.\",\"timestamp\":1639645164,\"title\":\"Selling \\\"Gucci and Dior\\\" in Meta Universe, SoftBank is betting on digital fashion merchandise platform\"},\"digest\":\"s8qJy8Kudg7n9oATVOG-HgOPViG18wW6n9xxH3Ce0-M\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd7b8763300ac94B0BDb90C9D0aDffcb636f632A8\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BbhlbNcEWsfikoik9f4Slwl8UXz0R7fHcgbBNmhD5rc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"UShsGPfWeAhonXIQKoz1IV7ewP9uHcsQifVkUtY7NrI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"PPDzzxw4saOMaoC_PtkV_g_7jeC3obX4CPtyTwmbAWpWuQnvNYm4K53We-io6CmRytrkHQjQsWVvcGyDcNnDOQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xbc20a9d2e55db0a0f018b646559315e995b93596742241a4ee080e0b8edbcbd80ec8358af3f63de41ac7d88b0b6cb69bb4008d07ebb9a4b728e72cc283ed3ab31c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BbhlbNcEWsfikoik9f4Slwl8UXz0R7fHcgbBNmhD5rc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"UShsGPfWeAhonXIQKoz1IV7ewP9uHcsQifVkUtY7NrI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"s8qJy8Kudg7n9oATVOG-HgOPViG18wW6n9xxH3Ce0-M\"}"
