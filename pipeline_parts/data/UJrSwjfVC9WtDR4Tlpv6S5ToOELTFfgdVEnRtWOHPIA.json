"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## What Are Operations?\\n\\nI specialize in operations. I’ve done that for over a decade. I’ve worked in transportation, marketing, tech, startups, and crypto. Though it took me ten years, I finally know how to explain what I do:\\n\\n* I create the conditions that allow organizations to scale\\n* I build systems and processes to maximize efficiency\\n* I solve new problems when the solution isn’t clear\\n\\nMakes sense, right? To drastically oversimplify; engineers build, designers design, and marketers sell.\\n\\n> Operations solve the problems that don’t fit neatly into any established category.\\n\\nHow do we structure our teams, organization, and products? Is there a better way to do what we do? How do we respond when a global pandemic threatens the very existence of our industry? Ops answers those questions.\\n\\nThat’s what I do now. But what’s next?\\n\\n## Enter DAOs\\n\\nAccording to those involved in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DOAs), the future of all work lies within. Conversations with anyone in Web3 elicit grandiose statements. Those in DAOs take it a step further.\\n\\nProclamations fly: “Every company should be a DAO.” “DAOs are simply a better way of doing business.” “Internet > Web2 > Crypto > NFTs >DAOs.” They don’t think they’re right. They *know it.* All the while, their eyes glow increasingly bright in a glistening shade of Ethereum blue.\\n\\nI’m actively looking for what’s next. I’m bored. Typical startups and tech just aren’t for me anymore. I want to be on the bleeding edge of technology and society. Clearly, it’s Web3 that’s pushing that edge. Duh. But I don’t yet know enough about DAOs.\\n\\n> If half of what’s said about DAOs is true, you’d be insane to ignore this.\\n\\nOver, the past couple of weeks, I’ve gone deep. Here’s what I’ve found intriguing so far:\\n\\n### DAOs are early\\n\\nWhile they’ve existed for a few years, the consensus says they’re just getting started. Many more will be created. You can create your own. Think you’ve missed the boat? You haven’t\\n\\n### DAOs can do anything\\n\\nIf multiple people are interacting on the internet for any purpose, it can be a DAO. They define the structure by which these interactions take place. Investing, collecting, creating… anything can be structured through a DAO.\\n\\n### DAOs have problems\\n\\nAnd problems have solutions. It doesn’t take much time in Discord servers to realize that every DAO has opportunities for greater efficiency. Some exist across all DAOs while some are specific to a few. Some of the problems I’ve found interesting include:\\n\\n* How do you compensate/reward members?\\n* How do you structure the organization?\\n* How do you avoid burnout?\\n* How do you create incentives that balance early involvement and ongoing contribution?\\n* How do you involve talented members that don’t naturally raise their hands?\\n* How do you create an environment that allows all members to thrive?\\n\\nMaybe this is where Operations can help!\\n\\n### No one knows how to do this\\n\\nIncredible things happen every day across the DAO landscape. But the field is new. There is an inherent opportunity to contribute.\\n\\n## Why I Wrote This, And Why You Might Read It\\n\\nI’m curious and I want to know more. More about DAOs, DAO ops, and how to contribute to these organizations.\\n\\nThe process of moving to a new tech startup is straightforward. Going from tech operations to DAO operations isn’t. I’m writing this to synthesize my research on DAOs. I hope that documenting this journey can help others who’d also like to know more. And I hope to answer the question; WTF is DAO operations?\\n\\n> If anything I said is wrong, or interesting, if you’re thinking about the same things, if there are topics you think I should research, or if you just want to chat, I’m always open.\",\"timestamp\":1633904743,\"title\":\"Ups and DAOs - WTF is DAO Operations? \"},\"digest\":\"fJIRFKemOKMdsKhjffF7WqVdk01IkHtPvU6UmMQzlDY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD691521C81153C681A1421C1767A6d01B6b47859\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"74GRJpmQeBGXV662OG6JdDX4zO_AphPnM06TIeTqQuE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QTzZbQbSfkwEe93HX1lqdKJQrQRBQNuLrULlk54Kwhc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"1bdFC8JzJe2KlS7ir80OhX77hJNL65qDHEmQFz982-7ziMYD4aUUHUcUGFRce4eWC9XEKSuUpDWtCY8CYwqczw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9155706a7c91b42f1c05b3417cd2cc1ff4a7befe116b1c249c01e79ae707059b67de32d9e0970c39ac24216ecaed42adad0672096aa839d56e6ae9696255b9321c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"74GRJpmQeBGXV662OG6JdDX4zO_AphPnM06TIeTqQuE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QTzZbQbSfkwEe93HX1lqdKJQrQRBQNuLrULlk54Kwhc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"PXcQPwWWwzJXEPfDfZGOsGYaTbe5aQUpVXdweFQ3Bkg\"}"
