"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Mark Zuckerberg’s landmark speech on Metaverse is a watershed moment for the industry as a whole. And he is not wrong. The future is metaverse. But it will be a decentralized one.\\n\\nOvernight, Decentraland and Sandbox became household names. I get the vision and all that, but a metaverse future still feels distant until I come across Wilder World. It makes many mainstream projects look like child’s play.\\n\\nOn its website, it says that “Wilder World is an immersive 5D Metaverse built on Ethereum, Unreal Engine and ZERO”. Led by renowned 3D artist Frank Wilder, Wilder World aims to build a virtual world by the creators for the creators.\\n\\n**Key Partners**\\n\\n**Epic Game Unreal Engine**\\n\\nIf you are unfamiliar with Unreal Engine and its amazing power, I highly recommend you watch this [tech demo](https://youtu.be/qC5KtatMcUw) that unveils Unreal Engine 5. As the game engine behind one of the most successful Web2 games in the world (namely Fortnite), it is capable of creating high-detailed virtual world leveraging the world’s largest photogrammetry library (thanks to its acquisition of Quixel).\\n\\n**Zero Network**\\n\\nZero is a peer-to-peer social network and operating system that represents the next frontier of decentralized technology → large-scale on-chain coordination aka DAO. It is a platform that can power different DAOs running on it.\\n\\nZero Governance: Infinity is Zero’s reserve currency. It is used to fund Zero projects. Trinity, its governance system oversees the management of Infinity, its reserve token. Zero Network is a DAO itself which is comprised of all community members (the DAO), run by the Guild (main builders), and supported by the council (elected public servants, my understanding is community leads?).\\n\\nUnits within Zero network: A world is a private and secure zero network. A number of worlds form a galaxy. A number of galaxies form a universe. Wilder World is one of the first universes built on Zero network.\\n\\n**Influencers all around**\\n\\nThe most successful projects are the ones adept at influencer marketing. The Wilder World team truly excels at it. So far it has attracted heavyweight influencers across different verticals such as Sports (NBA star Michael Carter-Williams) and Art (3D Artist + Skateboarder Chad Knight), to name a few.\\n\\n**Key innovations**\\n\\n**A photo-realistic metaverse** - When top 3D artists meet the most powerful game engine in the world, you can expect sparkles. Take a look at the sneak peeks, and tell me you don’t love the look of these!\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/realfrankwilder/status/1476790235316908032?s=20](https://twitter.com/realfrankwilder/status/1476790235316908032?s=20)\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/WilderGobey/status/1478307787360854018?s=20](https://twitter.com/WilderGobey/status/1478307787360854018?s=20)\\n\\n**Ubiquitous liquidity** - Anyone who has experienced the NFT market understands that illiquidity can be detrimental to NFT value. In an attempt to provide ubiquitous liquidity to its community, Wilder World has introduced a community token $LOOT that acts as the go-between for any assets its members what to trade. It is an exchange token that functions as an automated on-chain market maker which creates liquidity without the need for market depth or order books. It is one key innovation made possible by Zero network. For more information on the exchange token, you can read [here](https://res.cloudinary.com/fact0ry/image/upload/v1602993979/ZER0_WHITEPAPER_-_v0.8_-_Official_wkjgwe.pdf).\\n\\n**Fractionable NFT trading** - Similar to what partybid.app and fractional.art try to achieve, Wilder World enables fractionable NFT ownership and trading in a simpler and more elegant way.\\n\\n**NFT staking** - Stake your Wheels, Cribs, and/or Kicks to earn revenue in the chosen industry.\\n\\n**Tokenomics**\\nBoth Wilder World and its operation platform Zero network adopt a due-token system. So in total, the ecosystem is powered by four tokens that are interconnected.\\n\\n$Wild token\\n$Wild is the governance token of Wilder World Dao. $Wild is used to incentivize and rewards creators in the ecosystem. $Wild controls $LOOT reserve.\\n\\n$LOOT token\\n$LOOT is the utility token that powers the ecosystem. It is also the connection between Wilder World and Zero. $LOOT is a “dynamic“ token. What it means is that, it is a token without fixed supply and utilize an on-chain market maker to facilitate liquidity between any two tokens, irrespective of a token’s trading volume. While this is an ambitious innovation, there are not enough activities to evaluate how successful it is.\\n\\n![(source: https://zine.wilderworld.com/welcome-to-wilder-world/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nvmD-VwLOOzQGTlih5bH0.png?height=215&width=468)\\n\\n$Zero token\\n$Zero is the governance token of Zero network. $Zero was first launched on 12 December 2021 via a novel Quantum Dex Offering (QDO) event. $Zero was distributed among holders of $Wild token at the event. $Zero will be rewarded to citizens of existing universe every time a new universe goes live on Zero.\\n\\n$Infinity token\\n$Infinity is Zero network’s utility token. Members can use Infinity to buy and sell hosting power on the platform.\\n\\n**Key Tractions\\nMay 2021** - $Wild token launch\\n**Jul 2021** - Announcement of DCG investment in Wilder World\\n**Sept 2021** - Wilder World launches Wilder.Guild, a DAO built by artists for artists\\n**Nov 2021** -  Wilder World launches new NFT categories (Cribs, Craft, Wheel Tier C)\\n**Dec 2021** - $Wild staking goes live\\n**Jan 2022** - New Kicks drop\\n\\n**Token Performance**\\nIt has been a $wild ride. The token price went up from $0.048 to above $8 in a matter of months. It has since retreated to $2.2 - $2.5 range, forming a buying opportunity.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/X0eeqfD2YIW3yneR8maVT.png?height=900&width=1440)\\n\\n**In Summary**\\n\\n* We can all agree that we are heading towards a Metaverse future.\\n* From a technology perspective, Wilder World has the perfect blend of the best of Web2 and Web3.\\n* From a talent perspective, it is run by an incredibly creative team backed by smart crypto investors.\\n* While the fundamentals are strong, the token price has retreated significantly due to the sluggish macro environment thus forming a buying opportunity.\",\"timestamp\":1642366038,\"title\":\"It is time to get $wild\"},\"digest\":\"z43B551XVb0HK3AnWkV6P_9ywEeED5Yrh4JjDe5WUf0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x10d8Fc9954244947B4D47A53c189f1260F3B6D72\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1TgrOzNNd8RKSlYb5g3pB86is8B02HCfzJzARv9CM1g\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NQMOjNe798s2vYWtXKKzuq_B-F4NswIuf9J551mPznU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"WK7P6UjGVA4syean-2WhfUXLWUPDrM67JSllsWjbYZJC0RVNSYEfkmYOxKUUOdgRBN3ZWBGano1vijqy1ol9Fg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5c7b3267ef05525b4e520e35c1cc04debfd174603bce6285cc7f1ca888df38591cdd6c164e58b4c089c4326a1604fed04f8ab7925f6fe39b7b258051c0332dd01c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1TgrOzNNd8RKSlYb5g3pB86is8B02HCfzJzARv9CM1g\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NQMOjNe798s2vYWtXKKzuq_B-F4NswIuf9J551mPznU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"j9XNvffP2XrSUjN12nvTznnNKVaamaG782rC941kQzI\"}"
