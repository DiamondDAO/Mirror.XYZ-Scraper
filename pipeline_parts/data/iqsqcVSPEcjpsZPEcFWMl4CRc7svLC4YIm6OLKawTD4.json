"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"threw a thin cloak over her, and ran down to the edge of the sea, where Gaspare was waiting with the boat. Hermione did not bathe. It did not suit her now. And Gaspare was Vere's invariable companion. He had superintended her bathing when she was little. He had taught her to swim. And with no one else would he ever trust his Padroncina when she gave herself to the sea. Sometimes he would row her out to a reef of rocks in the open water not too many yards from the island, and she would dive from them. Sometimes, if it was very hot, he would take her to the Grotto of Virgil. Sometimes they went far out to sea, and then, like her father in the Ionian Sea before the Casa delle Sirene, Vere would swim away and imagine that this was her mode of travel, that she was journeying alone to some distant land, or that she had been taken by the sea forever.\\n\\nBut very soon she would be sure to hear the soft splash of oars following her, and, looking back, would see the large, attentive eyes of the faithful Gaspare cautiously watching her dark head. Then she would lift up one hand, and call to him to go, and say she did not want him, that she wished to be alone, smiling and yet imperious. He only followed quietly and inflexibly. She would dive. She would swim under water. She would swim her fastest, as if really anxious to escape him. It was a game between them now. But always he was there, intent upon her safety.\\n\\nVere did not know the memories within Gaspare that made him such a guardian to the child of the Padrone he had loved; but she loved him secretly for his watchfulness, even though now and then she longed to be quite alone with the sea. And this she never was when bathing, for Hermione had exacted a promise from her not to go to bathe without Gaspare. In former days Vere had once or twice begun to protest against this prohibition, but something in her mother's eyes had stopped her. And she had remembered:\\n\\n\\\"Father was drowned in the sea.\\\"\\n\\nThen, understanding something of what was in her mother's heart, she threw eager arms about her, and anxiously promised to be good.\\n\\nOne afternoon of the summer, towards the middle of June, she prolonged her bathe in the Grotto of Virgil until Gaspare used his authority, and insisted on her coming out of the water.\\n\\n\\\"One minute more, Gaspare! Only another minute!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ma Signorina!\\\"\\n\\nShe dived. She came up.\\n\\n\\\"Ma veramente Signorina!\\\"\\n\\nShe dived again.\\n\\nGaspare waited. He was standing up in the boat with the oars in his hands, ready to make a dash at his Padroncina directly she reappeared, but she was wily, and came up behind the boat with a shrill cry that startled him. He looked round reproachfully over his shoulder.\\n\\n\\\"Signorina,\\\" he said, turning the boat round, \\\"you are like a wicked baby to-day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What is it, Gaspare?\\\" she asked, this time letting him come towards her.\\n\\n\\\"I say that you are like a wicked baby. And only the other day I was saying to the Signora--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What were you saying?\\\"\\n\\nShe swam to the boat and got in.\\n\\n\\\"What?\\\" she repeated, sitting down on the gunwale, while he began to row towards the islet.\\n\\n\\\"I was saying that you are nearly a woman now.\\\"\\n\\nVere seemed extraordinarily thin and young as she sat there in her dripping bathing-dress, with her small, bare feet distilling drops into the bottom of the boat, and her two hands, looking drowned, holding lightly to the wood on each side of her. Even Gaspare, as he spoke, was struck by this, and by the intensely youthful expression in the eyes that now regarded him curiously.\\n\\n\\\"Really, Gaspare?\\\"\\n\\nVere asked the question quite seriously.\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signorina.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A woman!\\\"\\n\\nShe looked down, as if considering herself. Her wet face had become thoughtful, and for a moment she said nothing.\\n\\n\\\"And what did mother say?\\\" she asked, looking up again. \\\"But I know. I am sure she laughed at you.\\\"\\n\\nGaspare looked rather offended. His expressive face, which always showed what he was feeling, became almost stern, and he began to row faster than before.\\n\\n\\\"Why should the Signora laugh? Am I an imbecile, Signorina?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You?\\\"\\n\\nShe hastened to correct the impression she had made.\\n\\n\\\"Why, Gaspare, you are our Providence!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Va bene, but--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I only meant that I am sure Madre wouldn't agree with you. She thinks me quite a child. I know that.\\\"\\n\\nShe spoke with conviction, nodding her head.\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps the Signora does not see.\\\"\\n\\nVere smiled.\\n\\n\\\"Gaspare, I believe you are horribly sharp,\\\" she said. \\\"I often think you notice everything. You are birbante, I am half afraid of you.\\\"\\n\\nGaspare smiled, too. He had quite recovered his good humor. It pleased him mightily to fancy he had seen what the Padrona had not seen.\\n\\n\\\"I am a man, Signorina,\\\" he observed, quietly. \\\"And I do not speak till I know. Why should I? And I was at your baptism. When we came back to the house I put five lire on the bed to bring you luck, although you were not a Catholic. But it is just the same. Your Saint will take care of you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, but if I am almost a woman--what then, Gaspare?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Signorina?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mustn't I play about any more? Mustn't I do just what I feel inclined to, as I did in the grotto just now?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Three is no harm in that, Signorina. I was only joking then. But--\\\"\\n\\nHe hesitated, looking at her firmly with his unfaltering gaze.\\n\\n\\\"But what? I believe you want to scold me about something. I am sure you do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, Signorina, never! But women cannot talk to everybody, as children can. Nobody thinks anything of what children say. People only laugh and say 'Ecco, it's a baby talking.' But when we are older it is all different. People pay attention to us. We are of more importance then.\\\"\\n\\nHe did not mention Ruffo. He was too delicate to do that, for instinctively he understood how childish his Padroncina still was. And, at that moment, Vere did not think of Ruffo. She wondered a little what Gaspare was thinking. That there was some special thought behind his words, prompting them, she knew. But she did not ask him what it was, for already they were at the islet, and she must run in, and put on her clothes. Gaspare put her cloak carefully over her shoulders, and she hurried lightly up the steps and into her room. Her mother was not in the house. She had gone to Naples that day to see some poor people in whom she was interested. So Vere was alone. She took off her bathing-dress, and began to put on her things rather slowly. Her whole body was deliciously lulled by its long contact with the sea. She felt gloriously calm and gloriously healthy just then, but her mind was working vigorously though quietly.\\n\\nA woman! The word sounded a little solemn and heavy, and, somehow, dreadfully respectable. And she thought of her recent behavior in the Grotto, and laughed aloud. She was so very slim, too. The word woman suggested to her some one more bulky than she was. But all that was absurd, of course. She was thinking very frivolously to-day.\\n\\nShe put on her dress and fastened it. At the age of sixteen she had put up her hair, but now it was still wet, and she had left it streaming over her shoulders. In a moment she was going out onto the cliff to let the sun dry it thoroughly. The sun was so much better than any towel. With her hair down she really looked like a child, whatever Gaspare thought. She said that to herself, standing for a moment before the glass. Vere was almost as divinely free from self- consciousness as her father had been. But the conversation in the boat had made her think of herself very seriously, and now she considered herself, not without keen interest.\\n\\n\\\"I am certainly not a wicked baby,\\\" she said to herself. \\\"But I don't think I look at all like a woman.\\\"\\n\\nHer dark eyes met the eyes in the glass and smiled.\\n\\n\\\"And yet I shall be seventeen quite soon. What can have made Gaspare talk like that to Madre? I wonder what he said exactly. And then that about 'women cannot talk to everybody as children can.' Now what--?\\\"\\n\\nRuffo came into her mind.\\n\\n\\\"Ah!\\\" she said, aloud.\\n\\nThe figure in the glass made a little gesture. It threw up its hand.\\n\\n\\\"That's it! That's it! Gaspare thinks--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Signorina! Signorina!\\\"\\n\\nGaspare's voice was speaking outside the door. And now there came a firm knock. Vere turned round, rather startled. She had been very much absorbed by her colloquy.\\n\\n\\\"What is it, Gaspare?\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1637313664,\"title\":\"\\nEvery day, and sometimes twice a day, she put on her bathing-dress in the Casa del Mare, \"},\"digest\":\"U2FcgxicXtXHZCQzvxhHgYgfmRG9hKiXGtVKn9TM1FU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x104C9415d8cF60006fA1f2ecb12Aa1B60108c24D\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qlb5fsFEkDXn4E8GphYz2Sj6llZUZrzqLZCfYjMhfBA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"OBbp_W8jwDgsXgYhAxlgEDr8or2QH7MM-MZY3J9ydjs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"jAec0CjBHiPmmR0TrvJuju6q9weV5eTrCcTQZFsNMiWEGT1yV1ROQg03gMMy10crf_qjPAH1Dg8DLrNcEQVStw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1ace40199c7db00ed121f02af61231db4238ac44f2e6096b36c8d2b437c7d431754629dd7689fe8c01e7b4ac423824ca2cd57803059cbfeb92c83735d200f0711b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qlb5fsFEkDXn4E8GphYz2Sj6llZUZrzqLZCfYjMhfBA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"OBbp_W8jwDgsXgYhAxlgEDr8or2QH7MM-MZY3J9ydjs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"U2FcgxicXtXHZCQzvxhHgYgfmRG9hKiXGtVKn9TM1FU\"}"
