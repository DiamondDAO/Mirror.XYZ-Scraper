"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Since the outbreak of the epidemic, I have written several articles related to the United States. I didn’t plan to write them today. However, I have been chatting on Weibo these two days. After thinking about some things, I should quickly add one.\\n\\nThis article attempts to explain:\\n\\n1. How does a bottom-up country like the United States achieve anti-intellectual and constant innovation at the grassroots level at the same time?\\n2. Why does the elite like the United States;\\n3. Saying that the United States is bottom-up all day long, what exactly is bottom-up?\\n4. What can we do.\\n\\n1\\n\\nAmerica in a mess\\n\\nIf you look at the entire history of the United States, you will find that this country has never had any great plans. It is to take one step at a time, and then continue to rely on technological breakthroughs made by the top elites to continue their lives.\\n\\nOf course, the absence of a grand plan does not mean that there is no plan. It is just that there are very few more than five years. Generally, the leadership will be changed at least eight years, and the strategy will also be changed. Kissinger specifically said about this. At the time, it was Nixon, an anti-communist, who thought about the big issue of uniting with China to restrict the Soviet Union, and finally discussed it in a small circle. Kissinger seized the opportunity to come to China to fix it.\\n\\nIn more detail, the plans in American history are basically \\\"stressful\\\". In order to face the Great Depression, there was the Roosevelt New Deal; in order to defeat the Nazis, there was the \\\"Manhattan Project\\\"; in order to resist the red tide of the Soviet Union, The Marshall Plan began; the Soviet Union shot satellites into the sky, and the United States began to engage in a space program; in order to deal with the epidemic, a series of botched performances by President Chuan.\\n\\nIn fact, their laws are not understood from the beginning, they are constantly evolving, and they are constantly being fine-tuned. For example, when we watch American TV series, the red necks’ favorite \\\"defend the rights granted by the Second Amendment to the Constitution\\\" is what they said. The U.S. Constitution did not make it clear about guns at first, and later added a new article, which became the \\\"gifted gun rights.\\\" The same is true for other legal provisions. The law has been constantly amended, and there are affirmative acts such as interracial marriage and homosexuality, which are sometimes supplemented, and sometimes they simply overthrow themselves.\\n\\nIn addition, the advantage of the United States is that its environment is really good, and it is indeed much more peaceful. Some time ago, looking at our country’s early years, it was quite sad. There was the Soviet Union in the north, the United States at sea, and India in Tibet. Taiwan was planning a counterattack to the mainland, and it was full of clouds in all directions.\\n\\nmy country’s economic development is often disrupted by the threat of war. From 1965 to 1975, nearly half of the construction funds in the past decade were used to dig holes in the mountains. Many industrial facilities were moved to the mountains, and in caves, tens of thousands of people often hollowed out a mountain. At that time, because big cities could be subject to nuclear bombing by the US and the Soviet Union at any time, they had to hide. This matter was also called \\\"big third-line construction.\\\" It was not until after Nixon's visit to China that several strategists gathered together to discuss a result, \\\"There will be no world war in twenty years\\\", and neither did the Soviet Union in the later period, so that our country lifted the threat and started economically with peace of mind.\\n\\nIn fact, the initial stage of reform in our country should be traced back to the time when Chairman Mao was still there. For example, in 1972, it planned to spend 4.3 billion US dollars to import industrial equipment from the United States, Germany and Japan. It's very big, because afterwards, a full meal is related to chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The key to this plan is to solve this kind of people's livelihood problems.\\n\\nCompared with us, the United States is indeed peaceful, but it's not completely nothing. We now see the United States chaotically. In fact, throughout the history of the United States, it has always been like this, with small chaos constantly and less chaos.\\n\\nAt the time of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the U.S. wanted to get rid of the “british traitors” and hang a large number of British relatives in the name of shooting counter-revolutionaries. Many people went to Canada and formed the current English-speaking Canada. Later, the United States chased after Canada and fought several times, but failed to fight, and was counterattacked back. The White House was burned into the Black House and had to be repainted. There are still many places in the White House that are still black.\\n\\nLater, the north-south conflict became the mainstream. The two sides couldn't hold back and fought. The northern industrialists and the southern agricultural punks had a passionate collision. The south lost and the manor was shoveled. Together, they began to engage in industry and infrastructure construction. With the rapid development of the heavy industry, the dispute between the North and the South has finally settled.\\n\\nThen there was a big industrialization, and super industrial capitalists began to rise. After the Civil War, the United States developed extremely fast and ushered in the era of Morgan Carnegie. The big capitalists attacked the workers, and the workers also set up labor unions to fight against them. Bloody conflict.\\n\\nSome people on the Internet say that the emergence of the Soviet Union has brought vacations and benefits to American workers. In fact, it is not all. A series of benefits such as the eight-hour work system were obtained by American workers themselves. At that time, there was no Soviet Union. The contradiction between labor and management continued until the 1960s. After that, I won’t mention it, because the United States was so powerful that it could transfer the contradiction to East Asia, and give the East Asians their dirty work. They implemented the labor law and their lives gradually improved. Workers There will be no trouble.\\n\\nThen began the black movement led by Martin Luther King, the anti-Vietnam War, noisy, and then the oil crisis, the trauma of the Vietnam War, the disintegration of the Bretton Woods system and so on. You can see some of these things in \\\"Forrest Gump\\\". At that time, the United States could not be seen. It was a mess. The people didn’t believe in the government. The presidents broke out scandals one after another. France took a few brothers to create the United States in Europe. The credit of the U.S. dollar didn’t work anymore. It felt like it was about to die .\\n\\nThe Soviet Union has always felt that the United States is almost over, but it has overlooked one point. The vitality of the United States is no longer \\\"tidy\\\". Its advantage is chaos. It is a bit like India. It's not like a normal country. It's just that many people didn't pay attention. Their social conflicts were offset by the riots among the people, and they were similar to the British Empire.\\n\\nIt really doesn't work. The two-party system they have adopted is essentially to quickly \\\"change dynasties.\\\" If you are not satisfied with the Democratic Party, you will change to the Republican Party next time. To a certain extent, you can alleviate some dissatisfaction, even though they are similar.\\n\\nMoreover, American society is not like us, where everyone listens to the government, but Fei Xiaotong's \\\"bundles of firewood\\\". What do you mean? He said that the Western pattern is like a bundle of firewood that is clearly tied together. People usually belong to a group of several people and have good self-management qualities.\\n\\nEveryone should feel this when watching American TV series. The people in Yellowstone, Montana, don’t bother the government for anything. They solve the problems within their gang. Brooklyn, New York has been controlled by the underworld for many years, and the government cannot find black hands. Evidence that the party godfather has done bad things can't arrest people. The godfather has always been the emperor of the local area.\\n\\nBut this is not important. What's important is that their intellectuals are also highly autonomous. They take care of themselves. The government has very little intervention in the academic world and is relatively free. This makes the intellectuals much more comfortable inside.\\n\\nWhy did the Soviet Union become exhausted after the US-Soviet struggle for hegemony? On the one hand, the planned economy itself has the problem of contraction. On the other hand, the Soviet government has over-handled the disputes in academia. In extreme cases, the Soviet Union sent scientists to labor camps in Siberia. This is not funny. Although they did not do so later, the Soviet intellectual class had always had great opinions on the Soviet Union and kept fleeing throughout the Cold War.\\n\\nThis also gave the United States an opportunity. The American class began to absorb talents from all over the world since the First World War. The Second World War reached its peak, and it reached its peak after the end of the Cold War. The founder of Google was a Soviet government official and ran to the United States. After that, our country also ran away, and the intellectuals in the Middle East also fled on a large scale. Don’t underestimate the Middle East. Jobs’ father is a Syrian, and Taleb is also a Syrian. Perhaps the biggest contribution to the United States of the Middle East is not oil, but the entire middle class there.\\n\\nI understand this is why the United States is keen to mess up the world one by one. If the mess is up, the local middle class will have to flee. The elites in these countries are gone, and it will take decades to wait for the civil unrest to subside. Slowly cultivate.\\n\\nForget who said that China has never really engaged in a planned economy, because the planned economy requires a large number of mathematicians and intellectuals to compile tables to calculate supply and demand. China originally had less literacy, and a lot of them ran away in the latter part of the War of Liberation. It is precisely because I have never figured it out, the reform and opening up went very smoothly, because the influence of the planned economy is not so great, but Eastern European countries have not been very good.\\n\\nDon’t misunderstand one thing. The core of the planned economy is “commands”, but it requires a lot of form processing during the execution stage.\\n\\nAt the beginning of 1951, the Central Finance Committee produced various statistical reports with the help of Soviet experts. However, with the current business capabilities of the statisticians of the basic-level institutions, the reporting tasks were difficult to complete, and even if they were barely reported, the accuracy could not meet the standard. Reluctantly, the report has to be simplified again and again. There is a shortage of statisticians, so that a large number of workers have to be transferred from the workers, and even some cooks are flooded into the statistic team. The level of the compiled table can be imagined. To put it bluntly, I haven't figured it out too much. It is precisely because of the need for mathematics at the time and the whole society loves mathematics. Masters like Hua Luogeng and Chen Jingrun were born. Now I don't hear of people of this level. Instead, Chern's apprentice Qiu Chengtong is now the dean of the Harvard Mathematics Institute.\\n\\nThe \\\"highly autonomous intellectual group\\\" and the huge capital market of the United States have continuously bred new technologies. The intellectuals provide intelligence, and the capital market gives money. The US-Soviet hegemony seems to be the collapse of the Soviet Union's finances, and the essence is still American venture capital. Ben and the intellectuals started the computer revolution together. The Soviet Union fell behind a generation in science and technology, labor productivity was not high, and the population was small (the population of the United States had to be added to Western Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan), and the GDP naturally couldn’t keep up. , The finances also collapsed, coupled with internal conflicts, and soon the Soviet Union was completely over.\\n\\nI think some people on the Internet are too obsessed with the matter of their 800,000 deaths. This matter is a major issue in other countries. The United States does not matter. Forty thousand people are killed by guns every year. Forty thousand people died for nothing. A weird thing, how do you expect them to feel? As mentioned above, in the United States, the death of a person is a matter of the community, not the state.\\n\\nIt should be noted that their real core parts, knowledge groups and capital markets, have basically not lost much in the epidemic, and they are still attracting talents from all over the world during the epidemic prevention and control period. U.S. stocks continue to rise. Of course, it is related to the release of water. One reason is that they attracted funds from other countries and went to the United States to take over.\\n\\nIn addition, it should be noted that many of the top talents in our country have been attracted. For example, in the field of artificial intelligence in the United States, the proportion of Chinese is very high. That Li Feifei, now an artificial intelligence champion, I heard her lecture a few years ago.\\n\\nSome of these people return to the United States after returning to their country. They are not unpatriotic, but the intellectual class in the United States is autonomous. There is often a leader in our country who takes care of it. This kind of thing does not matter to ordinary office workers, but top scientists do not. The law accepts laymen’s leaders and experts. I have recruited several Ph.Ds in the United States over the years. Their first problem is that their supervisors cannot be of administrative background, they must be of technical background, otherwise they will not come back, and they have to interview their supervisors.\\n\\nMany people can’t understand this, but the fact is that top talents treat “freedom” and “atmosphere” much more importantly than ordinary people. This is why talents all over the world like to go to the United States. On the one hand, they can provide money. , On the other hand can provide atmosphere.\\n\\n2\\n\\nbottom up\\n\\nSo how did their capital market turn?\\n\\nThis means that the United States is a bottom-up country, that is, the top does not care about the bottom, and the bottom does not count on the top. Bundles of firewood are the responsibility of the community itself. Different communities are different in nature. The United States Their anti-intellectual and messy nature is largely related to their characteristics. The question is, how can such a country be so technologically strong? Leading the technological revolution time and time again?\\n\\nBecause things like innovation happen to be \\\"bottom-up\\\", what does this mean?\\n\\nFor example, everyone knows a problem. Now the whole world is waiting for technological breakthroughs, but the problem is that we don’t know which innovation will change the world in the future or how to do it.\\n\\nThe solution given by countries like the United States is: fooling around.\\n\\nYes, it's just fooling around. It's similar to ants going out to find food. It depends on a large group of ants running around. Whoever encounters it, go back and inform the house, and everyone should go together.\\n\\nMost of the time, the country has no plan what to do, and of course it cannot plan. Most of the breakthroughs made by mankind are not planned from now on. The steam engine was not built by the British government. The train was also developed in coal mines. The Internet was built by the US military, but I didn’t expect it to be used as it is now. The top minds think that the world only needs eight. Taiwan, a computer with a thousand times the computing power of Apollo's moon landing plan, no one dares to think about it.\\n\\nThe logic in the U.S. is to let every organization and individual in the market think about how to play. If you want to understand, go to build a prototype or start a business plan to collect money from capitalists. If you continue to do it, if there are results, someone will naturally give you additional money. After this iteration, the scammers will slowly get out of the game, and the truly powerful ones will gradually become bigger and bigger.\\n\\nOf course, it’s not all starting from the basics. For example, many technologies of the US military are directly transferred to civilian use. Who can be richer than the enemy's country, only then has the Moore's law we know, computers are getting smaller and cheaper, and countless companies fight for Wintel in the end.\\n\\nThe same is true for mobile phones. The gadgets made by the military were thrown on the market. Whoever can sell them can establish a dynasty. The era of Nokia and Motorola has come, but they were both overturned by Apple in the end. Yes, of course, Apple will not continue to grow. The company is similar to people. Some have a short lifespan and some have a long lifespan, but they will not continue to grow. Sooner or later, Apple will be killed by a completely unimaginable company. .\\n\\nIn addition, the United States spends a lot of money on universities every year. After the results are developed, the professor may go out to start a business and become a billionaire. Don't you say that this is not a \\\"loss of state-owned assets\\\"? It is true, but the scientific and technological status of the United States is indeed achieved in this way. The profound interaction between universities, research institutes, enterprises and the capital market has led to today's technological strength.\\n\\nCountless minds, countless companies and organizations are gradually eliminated in this race, and one or two are left in the end. They may be Google, Microsoft, Tesla, or something else soon. Something that appears.\\n\\nThis model has a characteristic. It is a large ecosystem, with various creatures growing inside, looking messy, but if it changes, there will always be some that can adapt, a bit like a meteorite falling to the earth, annihilating the dinosaurs, and the rise of mammals. Up. Our society also has this problem. No one knows what will happen in the future. The best way is to maintain a large enough sample library, even if everything happens, there are plans.\\n\\nThis is bottom-up.\\n\\nBut it’s not to say that the country is useless. Great innovations are generally found in big countries.\",\"timestamp\":1641284813,\"title\":\"Understand how technology in the United States develops, and then understand what we should do next\"},\"digest\":\"jINtWTwaMsIIb2lut1BdipTFCqiwJd6vKlWcDRi6qW8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xB01e4F6042590061C511d422B1f8E38302778b4d\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NhCitM6_wbzj1nCtvHYIddprZ6aF-2rsK2dfP6dw54I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1ce2X8ErfjDO_z6kBK4trDkYsNsCDvtgzrCw9Q3m95U\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"U33lNri9NwJiTxq79VD51lNTSkVslgmm21m0vlN87UvZ3hnotb6WvJ3bqacBB7rZdtLeBrf7n1wsC9N_wwSZ3g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc1d9012ced1906b790f91a4425986e43eb093ee8f1c9880e542c561dcddc7069421ecd33f841741854bdb0d0fb168216ccf3878786e0b38f80c4199b97eec1471b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NhCitM6_wbzj1nCtvHYIddprZ6aF-2rsK2dfP6dw54I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1ce2X8ErfjDO_z6kBK4trDkYsNsCDvtgzrCw9Q3m95U\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jINtWTwaMsIIb2lut1BdipTFCqiwJd6vKlWcDRi6qW8\"}"
