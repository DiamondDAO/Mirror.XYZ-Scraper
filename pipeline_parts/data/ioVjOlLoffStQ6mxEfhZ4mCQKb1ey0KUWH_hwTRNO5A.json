"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"LUNA, the native token of decentralized payments network Terra, bumped to over $100 in European hours on Friday to lead a “[Santa rally](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/23/first-mover-asia-santa-claus-rally-sends-bitcoin-north-of-50k/)” in crypto markets.\\n\\nTraders took advance of Thursday’s 10% decline to $85 to bring LUNA back to its previous high of $96 in early Asian hours. Then an [announcement](https://twitter.com/binance/status/1474198309749157891) by crypto exchange Binance that it will list UST, a [stablecoin ](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-stablecoin/)issued on the Terra network, pushed LUNA above $100. The price met resistance at that level and was down 5 cents at press time.\\n\\n*LUNA tokens have seen a month-long uptrend. (TradingView)*\\n\\nRising prices caused the total value locked (TVL) in [decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/) protocols on Terra to cross the $21 billion mark, [data](https://defillama.com/chain/Terra) from analytics tool DeFi Llama showed, making it the largest DeFi ecosystem after Ethereum. The figure has grown by almost $3 billion from Wednesday’s $18 billion level.\\n\\nOf the total, over $9 billion is locked on Anchor, a stablecoin-based yield-generating application. For TerraSwap, a decentralized exchange built with Terra smart contracts, TVL jumped 81% to over $2 billion compared to last week.\\n\\n*Top DeFi protocols on Terra by TVL. (DeFI Llama)*\\n\\nDeFi protocols rely on smart contracts instead of middlemen to provide financial services such as lending, borrowing, and trading.\\n\\nThe value is split among 13 protocols, or over $1.6 billion per protocol on average. That compares with $73 million per protocol on Binance Smart Chain, the third-largest DeFi ecosystem, which has $17 billion locked on 232 protocols.\\n\\nSome say applications like Anchor add to Terra’s allure for investors.\\n\\n“A 20% APY \\\\[annual percentage yield\\\\] on UST deposits through the Anchor Protocol is very appealing because capital flows from price-volatile assets to more risk-averse yield-bearing positions,” Marvin Steinberg, the founder of investment firm Steinberg Invest, said in a Telegram message with CoinDesk.\\n\\nLUNA’s price increase is part of a broader multimonth rally, one buoyed by November′s changes to its token mechanisms – such as a [”burn” feature](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/10/terra-passes-highly-anticipated-proposal-to-burn-nearly-89m-luna/) that periodically decreases supply – and increased activity on DeFi applications built on Terra. That’s propelled LUNA to become the ninth-largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of $36 billion.\",\"timestamp\":1640538406,\"title\":\"DeFi Value on Terra Surges to Record $21B as LUNA Tops $100\"},\"digest\":\"QojmDWOJGfBE_POgsa9SGB0VFipKfaR24zUPl3hC02g\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x52CEb287BEb81D61eDf413A8B3007b611E8917EA\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nQHBCPz2qtQmD3hGG3pD7NQfk4uG98r8LsuH3JMki2U\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"9ulaFHYEDsyrV15agdBQIBay7L_1kSeJhy4ULZBktmg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"iiQTj3lNDokG_Ggo0kbo4pBn9iixAbrsLuaEgFyaFVTE3PpvO65anmktid8SY6_ZiF6D23ffFjDIZpW1TebK0w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf8bca24910c14c75c0a522e4d8225f56f598a50cdb280a5e6fe4f1609a4e7a85794ed8f37bfb0ccc05332c67a7935abe384f063ec897dc916a9519babeb7e3df1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nQHBCPz2qtQmD3hGG3pD7NQfk4uG98r8LsuH3JMki2U\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"9ulaFHYEDsyrV15agdBQIBay7L_1kSeJhy4ULZBktmg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"QojmDWOJGfBE_POgsa9SGB0VFipKfaR24zUPl3hC02g\"}"
