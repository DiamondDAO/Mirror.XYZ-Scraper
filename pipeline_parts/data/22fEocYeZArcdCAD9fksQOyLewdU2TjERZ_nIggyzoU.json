It is a black and white photograph on a miniature set with the figure surrounded by golf balls. The figure was created by Alberto out of bent wire. It is the epitome of surrealism due to its playful juxtaposition of 3D and 2D.”\\n\\nSeries: Abstract Series of Color Photographs, Photomontage, Mixed Media Collages, Gel Series Circa 1970s-2002\\n\\nMedium: Scanned from Film - .JPEG; Film Format: 120 film\\n\\n### Contract with direct provenance \\n\\n“Golf Balls” was created together with [Manifold](https://www.manifold.xyz) with direct provenance to the Alberto Rizzo estate.

By the mid 1960’s he switched careers and began making a name for himself in the world for photography, creating iconic and groundbreaking covers for Harper’s Bazaar and Vogue, which continued throughout the 70’s. During this time he was a regular at Andy Warhol’s factory, taking inspiration from the many artists who were also part of one of the most creative think tanks of the 20th century.\\n\\nLike his counterparts, Rizzo spent most of his evenings at Studio 54 and used his days to evolve as a world-renowned artist. Throughout his long–spanning 40 year career, Alberto understood when to move in a new direction and in the eighties he dedicated his time to his fine art projects: the Gel Series, the Paper Cut Out Series, the Shadow Series, and his Abstract Expressionism Series. His work on these collections continued until the end of his life and led to shows at various galleries and institutions around the world. As Alberto reflected on his artistic journey later in life, he began repurposing some of the work from his 40-year career. These experiments with abstract expressionism involved drawing over his existing art and overlaying it onto other abstract photos.\\n\\nNot afraid to incorporate technology in his work, Rizzo also began integrating the use of digital art with the Gel Series and creating abstractions through pixelation. The release that Alberto’s mind experienced as an artist towards the end of his life with these series gives us a glimpse into the extent of his creative and artistic freedom.\\n\\nTo date, his work has been accepted into the Guggenheim Museum, Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Victoria & Albert Museum, Carla Sozzani Gallery and the J. Paul Getty Museum. Alberto remained a prolific and ever-evolving artist until his death from Leukemia in 2004, leaving an undeniable mark in the world of art and photography.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zsvVAziFtbmSfMUBVgO04.png?height=2208&width=1242)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637859409,\"title\":\"Accelerating the future of Web3 talent with Alberto Rizzo\",\"publication\":\"beetsdao\"},\"digest\":\"hu5x2wOlGWxyl6uChNOXcW_7hz_fo1po7cw-Fhkw3Og\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5875B4aAadF66d86161e6fe828729FBE1F067519\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"u63SrguJCMbGsTP-CkTCyONjluGQDSLLOBTfWcH1rH0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"7u1QkpcjO8Y8hcXjowVGcqTiZvwX3LEyu6Z2XxF1wng\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"UUrWJxUrXsf2oDyqpcXyrkggUlMdofMUmTrK4hNMC243zXExyA24YdvxU9xn-fkKX8SuXmEZPKGMUo_SA-Xh9Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x307c1ec5425bb8a156bbacddc7af6756ca3a234391d5570f5c4833632af6d6214a1a127cf024ebebd757039927cfadea60a79d32c384f01bf3049aa15d7cf6111b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"u63SrguJCMbGsTP-CkTCyONjluGQDSLLOBTfWcH1rH0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"7u1QkpcjO8Y8hcXjowVGcqTiZvwX3LEyu6Z2XxF1wng\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rW1eR13YDj3xIc9uhP-hxf6MkZ2hsExMSkU8NbwY9EE\"}"
