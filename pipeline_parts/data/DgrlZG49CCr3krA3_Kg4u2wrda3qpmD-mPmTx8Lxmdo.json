"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Life feels so long.\\n\\nTypically it’s the other way around. Typically people are always talking about how short life is, the brevity of our time here on Earth, how we should savor and make the most of every moment we’ve got because we’ve got so few.\\n\\nMaybe it’s because people are romantic and so we only hear the quotes and mantras that make life into this magical thing. Maybe it’s because these are the things people say on their death beds, and the words from those that have reached the end carry more weight.\\n\\nBut for me, right now, and fairly often over the past six months, life has felt like a slog. Often I think about what I’m to do with these next sixty or so years of life.\\n\\nThe problem isn’t that there’s nothing to do, it’s that I’ve lost desire to do anything in particular. The problem might really be that there’s too much to do.\\n\\nNowadays we have so much exposure to things that it makes them feel meaningless.\\n\\nFor the first time in history, I, some random eighteen-year-old, have the opportunity to do a million different things. I have access to enough information to gain serious expertise in pretty much any field of my choosing. I have access to communication with a plethora of people who’ve done amazing things, who’ve often made it public exactly how they ended up doing said amazing things. If I wanted, with time and effort, there is nothing holding me back from being like these people in my own right. On one hand, that’s a tremendous privilege.\\n\\nBut on the other hand, I see all of these people and think to myself, *who cares?*\\n\\nOnce again balance is key. Exposure to these figures and opportunities is probably really motivating the first couple of times, but after a while, it’s just more and more sets of names, faces, and achievements. Now you’ve got this disproportionately large sample of rows in a dataset, and the human stories that once compelled you have lost meaning in their abundance.\\n\\nAnd then what are you left with? Now you’re back full circle: unmotivated, uninspired, having achieved nothing. Might as well knock this shitty feeling with some mindless consumption, right? I’ve spent enough time building up and tearing down my willingness to direct my effort in my life, I should probably spare the little I have left and coast the rest of these sixty years, right?\",\"timestamp\":1639126968,\"title\":\"Too much inspiration\"},\"digest\":\"e80S-liNHwd_U2qq2I4ErvrU47Lscv2xod9TkeZ-3Jw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xbf8C1FA8a20f8983675677c0a1818c25da85209F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"lOKyE9S_NXoGUw_y82ISriv75Td0YxVJsNXie2BEACg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"b7pxzTj97dKExHgCsgWejjh8_gjehPacfyP8PMLt8CU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"SbIcJbYnkkVDWLDisX8hmiT-YbD-RdlqZjTNmChf7wPUyNFhw--6habTZi5dlMRhGbbQT4LHrDknsfjezym-9g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x201b42d00c5317124bfc64a5c1992efeeeafebeab71a697991b524090b2d22486ad6d49131c8fe6803335a15f408648f17b037a50852a5f5eec94f60735af6bc1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"lOKyE9S_NXoGUw_y82ISriv75Td0YxVJsNXie2BEACg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"b7pxzTj97dKExHgCsgWejjh8_gjehPacfyP8PMLt8CU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"e80S-liNHwd_U2qq2I4ErvrU47Lscv2xod9TkeZ-3Jw\"}"
