On the Surface world of SNW, players can not only socialize, combats, and even cooperate as a unit, but utilize the communities as camps to establish alliances and launch wars.\\n\\n* A-NFTs from other metaverses will be awarded with unique community icons;\\n* The Power Symbol, namely the Amethyst Palace, will announce the Ranking List 24/7 to show the competitiveness of each individuals and major camps;\\n* Camps will have their own irreplaceable lands, fragmented into plots, on this SNW continent.\\n\\nUnderground world (PVE): the underground world of SNW is an abyss constructed by multi-layered dungeon worlds. Each layer habitats different monsters and races. Players can engage in the PVE exploration to claim rewards.
