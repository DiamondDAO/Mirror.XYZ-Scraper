"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Although non-fungible token (NFT) transactions have risen and made headlines, they are just a gimmick for most people outside the crypto world. The meta universe will change this.\\n\\nThere is always a turning point when new technology suddenly turns from a puzzling fringe interest into a part of life. This point usually comes from the combined effect of many driving factors, and now we are experiencing what happens when two such trends reach a turning point at the same time.\\n\\nMark Zuckerberg's decision to change Facebook's name to Meta was enough to make Metaverse headlines around the world, even though the concept has been around for at least 30 years. It is the sudden appearance of the meta universe that provides the escape speed for the restoration of the image of NFT as a speculative encryption gimmick.\\n\\nMajor companies such as Morgan Stanley are now predicting the future of NFTs, and the “digital luxury goods” industry predicts that by 2030, the value of Meta Universe will reach US$50 billion. The next phase of the NFT cycle has already begun.\\n\\n## Not just virtual\\n\\nMetaverse is generally considered virtual reality and augmented reality, but it is not that simple, although VR/AR adds the expected immersive experience. Metaverse can also be considered from the perspective of games, such as \\\"Number One Player\\\", but it is not limited to this. However, both provide clues as to what it will be.\\n\\nQuoting Zuckerberg’s point of view, work on the meta-universe has tended towards the “embodied internet”: an interconnected virtual experience network that combines digital and reality to provide new work, entertainment, social interaction and creation. Way. It can be seen as an extension of the home office experience spawned by the new crown epidemic-but now it is in a 3D virtual space, whether you access it through a helmet or an ordinary 2D screen. A remote meeting does not mean that a large number of people are discussing across the wall; on the contrary, you can share a virtual space with a group of virtual characters. This is important because having a real sense of presence allows for more subtle and natural interactions.\\n\\nOf course, Facebook saw this opportunity early and has good reasons to continue to promote it. The company's Oculus Quest helmet sold out for most of 2020, adding a huge boost to the VR market, mainly due to its ease of use. The speed at which this device gains traction highlights consumers’ new interest in 3D experiences: In the past 18 months, people who want to get rid of blockades have creatively designed games as places for social interaction, whether it’s in \\\"Animal Crossing\\\" 'S wedding is still a work conference in \\\"Red Dead Redemption\\\".\\n\\nThere is no clearer indication of how the game will lay the foundation for a broader experience in the future. Another company that has been following Metaverse for some time is Epic Games, which is the studio behind the gaming giant \\\"Fortnite\\\" (Fortnite). A full year before the blockade, it hosted an electronic music producer Marshmello’s Virtual concert. Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic, put all his bets on Metaverse, providing various services including Unreal Engine design tools for free. What is the purpose? Push development in the direction he wants to see-a direction with fewer obstacles, more interoperability, and more data sharing. Less centralized; less harmful.\\n\\n## Metaphysics...plus the help of blockchain\\n\\nOf course, a decentralized structure is not potentially necessary, but it meets the ideal goal considered by many meta-universe advocates: Sweeney describes it as an “open framework in which everyone can control their own existence. Bound\\\".\\n\\nIn order to create a veritable meta-universe, rather than an independent 3D space collection, the platform needs to be interoperable and seamless. Payment must be safe, frictionless and instant, and no matter where you are in the meta universe, you must be able to retain and use the created assets (such as your custom avatar). Until recently, to participate in the digital world, you had to leave a series of breadcrumbs for the gatekeeper (game creator, etc.) to recognize you. When individuals use blockchain to track their accounts, assets, and transactions, it adds a huge potential for users to choose how they behave, what they own, and decide what to trade.\\n\\nVenture capitalist and influential metaverse commentator Matthew Ball believes that blockchain is one of the \\\"core promoters\\\" of metaverse. He defines another key factor of the meta universe as \\\"the individual's sense of existence, and...the continuity of data.\\\" The longer you \\\"live\\\" online, the more important your personal \\\"skin\\\" is. Even the most basic pixel art is closely tied to personal identity, as people ’s enthusiasm for CryptoPunks shows, its owners often say that they feel closely connected to their punk.\\n\\nIn fact, whether through randomly generated or carefully designed features, NFT makes people more likely to express their personalities online. The virtual clothing and accessories that users choose in the virtual world will help make everyone feel real about their online identity and deepen their participation. Fashion and art are important parts of self-expression in the real world; why should the online world be different?\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, digital fashion is booming, and it has new growth opportunities in NFT. Design companies and celebrities are selling skins, clothing, hairstyles, and pets as NFTs; \\\"release NFT\\\" is as hot as releasing an unexpected album. In fact, musicians and athletes are accepting the possibility of earning royalties when selling NFT assets, hoping to create a new property right system that is not restricted by the practices of traditional brokers.\\n\\nAs digital property rights become legalized and blockchain becomes more secure, NFT may become a more important bargaining chip. For example, imagine a team negotiates with Disney about the use of its role. Sound far-fetched? Sotheby’s recently saw a DAO (including 17,000 donors) bid for a rare copy of the U.S. Constitution to more than $43 million. Although they did not win the copy this time, it is clear that the shared ownership promoted by the NFT will become a real economic force.\\n\\n## Inject capital for the future\\n\\nWhat does all this mean for capitalism, innovation and creativity? What does it mean for the business model and our life experience?\\n\\nFrom games to ticketing, from software subscriptions to healthcare, the series of revenue sources provided by Metaverse have the potential to change the technological paradigm and keep it away from advertising and big data, as well as all the privacy and security nightmares they bring. This is certainly not inevitable, but at least it is a possibility.\\n\\nThe more open and accessible the platform, the stronger this narrative will become. Connected platforms attract more users; then, seamless and interoperable payment and asset mechanisms increase the motivation for design and transactions—recycling revenue throughout the system and increase the potential for parallel economic order.\\n\\nMajor game companies are already making their meta-universe development tools widely available, with a clear goal to encourage interoperability, which will lead to wider adoption. These companies believe that open metaverse is the best for business. This is certainly the best way to create a thriving online economy-in this economy, users are motivated to participate and create value, which will bring benefits to platform developers and user creators.\\n\\nThis time, technology, philosophy, and economic cases may all point in the same direction: the ability to use blockchain technology to move towards a distributed meta-universe in which online citizens can finally escape the walled garden of Web 2.0 and benefit from their contributions. get the benefit. In this exciting new world, NFT will bridge the gap between reality and virtuality. From identity to business, tangible ownership will make all the difference. This is a new reality.\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1639481149,\"title\":\"Viewpoint: Metaverse will bring unlimited development to NFT\"},\"digest\":\"wTv58rMGvsADt-13qWXWCBfZZdRRzzTwn7tuEWrxI_M\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xB515a297CE50D21e4Ef0e017Cf41495356af28f4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"WCFY6vk2eyYuc1C7ctj3vRBp3PUAWF7YL9djXuEDd70\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"51oLkZyg6KV4eRwSo0F41-8MLqtVkpRGdOvMi9XdZPQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Z1AkeHC0AveOZKwbkCx6K0AwksA8Ph4FbqgNPM2RXUOByB8r38cgm3-ForMlKehQm8qvpVUMAmH4qjcnNIOO6g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x340e9b80606de51eff653972a0b526d371abf4c8df06a932c49c11272647258b195fdb5e68fdf9e02f4270859bf230c4bf11457468ed6fda356c77da40a1c6841c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"WCFY6vk2eyYuc1C7ctj3vRBp3PUAWF7YL9djXuEDd70\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"51oLkZyg6KV4eRwSo0F41-8MLqtVkpRGdOvMi9XdZPQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wTv58rMGvsADt-13qWXWCBfZZdRRzzTwn7tuEWrxI_M\"}"
