"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Platform differs from other DAWs because it expands upon current workstation familiarities to make them more social and connected. Using Blockchain technology anyone with an account on-chain can claim an address, anything they make, instruments and songs they acquire, are all stored with that address and are accessible from anywhere via a connected device. Although other tools work in a similar fashion, none allow for universal access through link and id sharing, nor provide a way to give access to VSTs in a web3 based app.\\n\\nThe goal of this project is to decentralize the music industry and create user owned ecosystems in which music (in all forms - full tracks, sessions, stems, VSTs) can be shared, sold, bought, and played with an interface that is accessible from anywhere at any time.\\n\\n![Non-Fungible Devices](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YgMP43hNgAQrtHyJQeea3.png?height=2112&width=2187)\\n\\n![FIle Explorer](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/u8XcEWdVV71cgju7CmNI9.png?height=3072&width=5349)\\n\\n**OBSTACLES**\\n\\nLow to no cost blockchain transaction fees due to volume of Non fungible token creation\\nInterface for user searchable data\\nBackground method of tracking likes and popularity of files + display in categorized lists\\nGive users the option to set NFTs as public/opensource and private/closed\\nBackground method to snapshot session data + mint as smart contract with user adjustable visibility\\nEnable users to share smart contract sessions\\nNon fungible Virtual Instrument creation and/or partnership with VST creators + software instrument companies\\nBackground method to categorize and display wallet contents (VST, songs, sessions)\\nMethod of connecting/scanning local hardware for VST\\nMethod of “playing” audio files on the blockchain\\n\\n**POSSIBILTIES**\\n\\nCreation of a decentralized music and content industry from creator based work\\nElimination of Hardware requirements\\nInstant access from anywhere at anytime\\nPartnership with other Digital Audio Workstations, Software instruments\\nverifiable user submission and collection of items\\nuser ran record labels and collectives\\nPartnership with record labels for a+r and submission\\nPartnership with social media or metaverse application to share/display tracks that are on-chain\\n\\nMORE INFO: WDYSWYEC.COM/PLATFORM-APP-DETAIL\\n\\n[https://www.wdyswyec.com/platform-app-detail](https://www.wdyswyec.com/platform-app-detail)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1642280641,\"title\":\"Open-source Ideas: PLATFRM\"},\"digest\":\"55Y-F5aIRwHVAte6Nzcpo9jtFMG91TsWIHRTe_2i92Q\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2bFA74Fd69756749d2Cad661F7486DBa3B1Fb124\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"v7dklCYVNENJPaBU5fjuGLdz9MZaT_n9Di8bKQNKVC8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0SntdNo0d8Hhp7-uOjKxtzTtGqz5EvyxERpcgJPkDAA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ppGcDfVMNHnbbDlLdpC4tUPOm8wMWl3pVLMrvFdcDeE6XfkITWyKKZ4bkL0fJQr9chcgQAmz8oNpQPBd6ACXVA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xedf4a055755db8e69e00f4f71bfb68b1340ae0c4a71c0e539c0968aac65944d756dc2dd1ba17b7fd2d7f8c8fd3188295b75dac9071664d403cbe65ad7d4a605600\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"v7dklCYVNENJPaBU5fjuGLdz9MZaT_n9Di8bKQNKVC8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0SntdNo0d8Hhp7-uOjKxtzTtGqz5EvyxERpcgJPkDAA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Tmj-hb12kG4HW4ADA53JKGolLVFKnuzlnJGn6YO39eI\"}"
