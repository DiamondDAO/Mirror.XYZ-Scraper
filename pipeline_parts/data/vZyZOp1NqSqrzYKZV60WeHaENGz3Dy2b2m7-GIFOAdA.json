Benefitting the most from this were virtual landowners, with property prices rising steadily. But shouldn’t land in the metaverse be free?\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-jM8H-iM3B89R6TQNYOrd.jfif?height=444&width=679)\\n\\n2/ Based on a clash of approaches, virtual land ownership can be conceptualized from two different angles and framed in terms of the varying phenomena it constitutes, leading to the formulation of two distinct models.\\n\\n3/ The scarce land model So far, the prevailing approach toward virtual land ownership, among the current batch of established virtual world projects, seems to be to auction off or sell land plots at a predetermined price and to limit the overall quantity of land plots.\\n\\n4/ Proponents of this approach take up the stance that virtual land should be a scarce resource. However, this might be the result of reasoning by analogy, as it transfers a phenomenon from the offline world to the digital realm.\\n\\n5/ Furthermore, it also tends to incentivize rent-seeking behavior, which might translate to wealthy land barons amassing large areas of land, thereby monopolizing the market.\\n\\n6/ The unlimited land model Challenging the notion of the scarce land paradigm, projects, such as Nifty Island, pioneered a novel approach, which does not restrict the quantity of land plots but instead gives one to every user for free.\\n\\n7/ Instead of functioning as mere investments, virtual land plots are intended to serve as an altered version of social media profiles. In addition, land size could be expandable by staking native fungible or non-fungible tokens.\\n\\n8/ The key difference is that, with the top-down approach (scarce land), content is fabricated mostly by landowners, which is then intended to be consumed by everyone else. With the bottom-up approach (unlimited land), content is organically created and coonsumed by every user.\\n\\n9/ If you’d like to get a more detailed analysis of the current state of the NFT market, check out this week's \\n\\n[@TheBlockRes](https://twitter.com/TheBlockRes)\\n\\n NFT series, which explores the most interesting insights in NFTs, blockchain gaming, and virtual worlds.\",\"timestamp\":1639182327,\"title\":\"关于元宇宙的资料收集\"},\"digest\":\"9JzI9z6Lf2nxR9WO6SkESsfurgwpdUlPymSFqCnliVs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd8E93E06a84581c10DC1F9F60ec91f0F38994f1b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"QI6AEQmMTQfjSGfICSTDzyzHi2fFSZEVQl5xDdyUjuQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"cx4_OFyWRB6ofDaBGbzstNiXj3ZieBTewbJBPZlnLSA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"iP1l-Jr37y7jOrOSQYkKoSTvdLifVgorUPZkP-8OejmkvJtTH34D-WOrzw1PD2OG_Gvv_0IZpeuRVS9thNKdcg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x46e79a1d8c9bd4f68144a4b30c8aabc0e99d4cfe31dee72dd1716e21d717849d41cf04e033550e416342870715e1c4130057b6031bb26899d09a94d4820c15411b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"QI6AEQmMTQfjSGfICSTDzyzHi2fFSZEVQl5xDdyUjuQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"cx4_OFyWRB6ofDaBGbzstNiXj3ZieBTewbJBPZlnLSA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"EecqmXMyzGlL2vXbgkqnlqORVl-L8YG5Kg2UKA0zFwQ\"}"
