"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"> To live together in the world means essentially that a world of things is between those who have it in common, as a table is located between those who sit around it.\\nâ€“ Hannah Arendt, 1958\\n\\n![Engraving depicting the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

We govern, share, and maintain them as a society. While imperfect in how they are built or administered, these objects draw us together in dialogue, debate, and common concern (Honig, 2017). More than mere things, natural landscapes and built environments are cultural touchpoints. They involve us in care for the public good.\\n\\n![Roman aqueduct of Pont du Gard, now recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Clean air is an example of a naturally occurring public good, while the electric grid is a public good created by people. What are the public goods of today's industrial-knowledge society? Open source code, which supports millions of companies and independent developers, is often thought of this way. The cypherpunks considered privacy itself as a kind of public good. It seems only natural that online media archives and open digital infrastructure should qualify as well.\\n\\nMore recently, Vitalik Buterin and others in the cryptocurrency community have taken up the rhetoric of blockchain mechanisms as public goods. To be sure, crypto protocols are among the most compelling novel institutional forms. Their unique capabilities derive from their \\\"public\\\" qualities: unrestricted membership and participation, open APIs, transparent allocation of resources and power. But at the same time many of their characteristics contradict claims of public accessibility. Can crypto protocols be considered public goods if ownership is concentrated in the hands of a few whales? Colloquially, these market primitives are sometimes described as \\\"public infrastructure,\\\" but if blockchains serve a \\\"public\\\" today, it is primarily one of decentralized finance. Fundamentally, these tokenholders share only one common object of concern: price.\\n\\nSo while crypto protocols may qualify as public goods in the economic sense, where in these conversations is discussion of what's good for the public? Some of the crypto community's stated ambitions are to solve mass coordination problems, build post-national forms of sovereignty, and level the global playing field. But to create a majestic and egalitarian society requires a more expansive vision of public goods than what can be imagined with economics alone.\\n\\n![Ancient Ruins Used as Public Baths, Hubert Robert (1798)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/81fd1a35-4953-49c1-b54c-3ec794ec8db4.jpeg?height=853&width=1247)\\n\\nThe public bath houses of the Romans, accessible to both rich and poor, were the cornerstone of both the city's public health and its rich cultural life. At its peak, the Library of Alexandria held hundreds of thousands of texts, among the largest stores of public knowledge in the ancient world. Although exclusionary in many respects, these wonders are precursors to the public goods we know today. They point towards an ideal of openness and universality. As builders of a new digital society, we must be equipped with an even more inclusive and visionary concept of what \\\"public\\\" and \\\"good\\\" can mean. As protocol treasuries transition to community stewardship of public works, it's time to imagine how crypto protocols might uniquely conceive of public goods.\",\"timestamp\":1625538661,\"title\":\"Positive Sum Worlds: Remaking Public Goods\",\"publication\":\"jktest\"},\"digest\":\"6ASug24o1JEfrZZ3o0CEOlcsEoddg28rScykFGdzFhM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x841fF85B6873d7bfB712C8f7A347C774355b6EC3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_JMJMNe46c7MX6HPmzMgPEcSqvtL4e1Pzgn7haFrotk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"SoFwdXGixpIoUQoNoP-vOkAPxehb_a9uKHbXN21Q7SE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"1pFJmzcfwccZSBAaXjLcLYQ8FXZk586unONRPhX9dVQ9hsQCUH-om811KuZUCr4VTcHRM6UunDHUt6RkBHnRIQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x14c44ee34767047489370a52971282132b843d8f2c0fedcb5fd5ddce9c680250588ff9791a65ec8a471946de09058365d4fc8d3054254607ee0d72c4b335112b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on jktest.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_JMJMNe46c7MX6HPmzMgPEcSqvtL4e1Pzgn7haFrotk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"SoFwdXGixpIoUQoNoP-vOkAPxehb_a9uKHbXN21Q7SE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"OfKqtsM6xujpWVqZDTe0Z9ePMJpfYpAQ5Bx46dSYVyU\"}"
