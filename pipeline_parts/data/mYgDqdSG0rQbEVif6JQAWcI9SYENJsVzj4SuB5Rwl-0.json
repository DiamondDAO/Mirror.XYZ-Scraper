And while it's important to make the most of your resources, sometimes you might be overlooking some great options.\\n\\nHere's an honest review of some underutilized resources for small business owners from a serial marketer. So whether you're looking for ways to save money or get more exposure for your business, hopefully this will help your SMB marketing team.\\n\\n## Short Messaging Service (SMS), aka sending text messages\\n\\nLet me introduce you to a friend's company, **[Alabaster Co](https://www.alabasterco.com/)**. They do the best SMS marketing that small businesses can emulate. **Go text (833) 217-3448.**\\n\\nThe truth is sending a newsletter or an email is not enough anymore to acquire, and continue to chat, with customers.\\n\\nWhile it's true that email and social media are still the most popular ways to communicate with customers, **SMS allows customers to interact on the app they use the most** — text messages.\\n\\nAlabaster has a mix of reminders on the last day shipping to get something by Christmas (VERY smart!), information about new launches, just a thank you note, and sales/codes reminders.\\n\\nRealize what SMS marketing allows is to grab the attention where people have attention. Just think of **your mindset when you hear an email notification vs. a text...**\\n\\n## Search Engine Optimization (SEO), and why local SEO is a powerful tool\\n\\n![Photo by Souvik Banerjee on Unsplash](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/q11mEyE5ONhKGvwjiLlrn.jpg?height=4000&width=6000)\\n\\nWhile I'm not an SEO marketer by trade, this is one of the **most underutilized tool a local small business can use**.\\n\\nThe difference in searching Chinese food restaurants in Anaheim (a city in California) vs. Chinese food restaurants is night and day. On top of that, if you're optimizing for a local area, Google indexes you in a different category.\\n\\nThis is similar to SMS being an app consumers use the most — and with a positive sentiment. **Behavior, and attention, of searching where or what to eat** is done on apps like Yelp and Google searches — and then seeing the food and ambiance pics on Instagram location tags.\\n\\nIt's not just keywords, but there are content you can add to add value:\\n\\n* Why Chinese takeout is still the most affordable dinner option.\\n* 3 Chinese food traditions in Anaheim that you didn't know about\\n* Hey, Anaheim! We're open for Christmas for the 15th straight year.\\n\\n**Understand the behavior, and provide convenience.** I'll keep saying this as an SMB's marketing team needs to strategize its marketing plans around this strategy.\\n\\n## Paid Social Media, but (almost) anywhere else than Facebook Ads\\n\\nDon't be confused — I do think Facebook ads is still the most underutilized medium for small businesses, but I rarely see a **smarter ecomm or branding strategy** from more efficent platforms like Snapchat.\\n\\nFor example, do you know you can set up your company's filter at a specific location? Imagine you put into that filter \\\"Bring this picture in and you'll get 15% off a purchase of more than $100.\\\"\\n\\nAds you see on IG stories exist on Snap ads, and it's at a significantly cheaper CPM. While there's less people watching, there's also a huge segment of people not watching your ads on Instagram.\\n\\nThat being said, I think **Twitter ads and LinkedIn ads are very expensive for SMBs**. There's ways to buy YouTube efficiently, but content production and bidding strategies are too complex.\\n\\nBut, Snapchat — and Pinterest to a degree — are underutilized and can capture a huge segment of a target market that your competitors aren't focusing on.\\n\\n![Photo by Soheb Zaidi on Unsplash](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CG858Iugyl9K9yvIMhfoz.jpg?height=2912&width=5184)\\n\\n## Thinking of making this into a series...\\n\\nFunny enough, if I wanted to be more SEO optimized, this article would've been 2,000 words, 15 headings, at least 57 paragraphs and has \\\\~10 images.\\n\\nThis is also to make a point of following best practices vs. creating value. I believe if I put everything on a list, no one would take an action on any of this. But, since I kept it simple with three, someone will at least research one of these.\\n\\nSo, in contradiction, of not doing something that's underutilized and not taking that opportunity, I'm instead choosing value.\\n\\nPlease think about all tools as a small business in this framework. Don't do what's best for you; do what's best for your target audience — and be OK with your decision.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n*Tony Lee (aka [@sheckii](https://www.twitter.com/sheckii)) is a digital advertising entrepreneur who worked on brands like 20th Century Fox, Sam’s Club, ABC Entertainment, Nintendo, Starz, sweetgreen, outdoor voices, First Republic Bank, Kane’s Furniture and more.
