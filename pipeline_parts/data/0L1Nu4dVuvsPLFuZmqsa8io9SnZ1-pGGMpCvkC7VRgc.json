"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"i missed yesterday. but we have some doozies (french?) today. do we like these being very informal? what more stuff do you want to see? any favourites from this week (spelling?) I’m thinking about adding in the u to favourites from now on. and colour. and velour. [yossou n’dour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youssou_N%27Dour). parkour. this whole thing be as/more useful as a word association exercise. Assouciation? If anyone knows computers and can scrub all of these from the internet, starting to think about that…(ed: the irony of reposting this on Mirror…)\\n\\n1. here’s an artist in Korea that suspends some kind of chemical in water and it dances to the music they play: <https://www.instagram.com/p/CUWSJMAv_4r/?utm_medium=share_sheet>. Reminds me of fern gully or the truly terrifying vhs [from my youth ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Nemo:_Adventures_in_Slumberland). I love it and want one.\\n2. Interesting thread about Netflix, and how they engineer the thumbnails of each show to make you more likely to click faster. Crazy example: the star of Queen’s Gambit (chess show), had been in Peaky Blinders years before as a relatively minor character. So once Queen’s Gambit became a hit, they changed the thumbnail on Peaky Blinders to have her face on it, even though it’d take you like a full season or more before you would even see her on it.\\n\\n   <https://twitter.com/trungtphan/status/1445768087832182796?s=11>\\n3. I’m reading David Goggin’s book about being hardcore and running ultramarathons and doing hard physical stuff (massive simplification). Once I finish it i’ll decide if it’s worth linking in here, but one thing it did is send me down an insane rabbit hole of stories/characters. Turns out once you’re in the military, there are increasing series of intense groups to apply to until you reach the top of the top most secretive elite groups in the Army ([Delta Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Delta_Force_members)), Navy (DEVGRU), and sometimes CIA ([Special Activities Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Activities_Center)). If you look at their wikipedia pages, you see a list of “notable alumni”, and their stories are bonkers:\\n   * [Moe Berg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moe_Berg): 15-seasons in major league baseball, then a spy in WWII. Should be a movie. (Turns out a movie was made about him with Quesadillettante favorite Paul Rudd, anyone see it? Rotten Tomatoes says…not good….<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Catcher_Was_a_Spy_(film)>)\\n   * [George Bacon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bacon_(CIA_officer)): After a certain amount of wild stuff in life, should people consider toning it down? George Bacon did not remotely tone it down.\",\"timestamp\":1633723369,\"title\":\"friday i'm a link\"},\"digest\":\"464uSKCltJj65Tm3KMOcJ9D-U_yocA2YvpMQpNZsMUY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x87E386cEdb82CF8F080b3505ADaE1eF699e65057\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ExhLEetYB62ONMhhGsLDMOkVgieibIEQ1zzMO0fIGP4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"i1C56p50NVLlfSHayWOYk3l3HApWXQUOdftAYuPgEZE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"h9wo21fYKF7ZlOZwq4gxaVh4vyJkA3SSJlgjN5G914E6ZBPhq7Rag--XmpUbBFyuAgEd7DI9JqG19wOoJMQNBA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x26aeec6d2ea406e2652d3d2d441ce25dd0ac27358128359190aefe52ad7428cf62fc7ab05017a59832484f7604d0bd8f12993174b42fd6f1e1be707aebc9c27b1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ExhLEetYB62ONMhhGsLDMOkVgieibIEQ1zzMO0fIGP4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"i1C56p50NVLlfSHayWOYk3l3HApWXQUOdftAYuPgEZE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"464uSKCltJj65Tm3KMOcJ9D-U_yocA2YvpMQpNZsMUY\"}"
