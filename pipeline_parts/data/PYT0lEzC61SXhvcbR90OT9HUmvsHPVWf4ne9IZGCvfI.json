"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"With a combination of blockchain and the metasurverse, virtual items can be traded outside the virtual world -- a virtual reality space based on interactions and economic activity between users. Virtual reality can become a virtual world through blockchain-based unforgeable tokens (NFT). NFT assigns each token a unique code on a blockchain-based basis, and then it becomes like a collectible, unique in the world, unique and scarce. These tokens are typically issued on blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Solana or EOS. In the old virtual world, operators owned everything, such as equipment items in traditional online games. Now, in the metasverse, NFT allows users to take full ownership of objects in both the virtual and real worlds. NFT enables users to prove ownership of their assets and trade them in communities both inside and outside the virtual world. Users can also monetize their digital assets by, for example, exchanging NFT for other cryptocurrencies on digital asset exchanges. Incorporating NFT into a game or meta-universe property project can also maximize interoperability with different virtual worlds. Maximize interoperability Decentraland, Axie Infinity, The Sandbox and Earth 2 is a prominent example of how virtual worlds can be built and extended by combining metasexes with blockchain-based NFT. They extend the virtual world to the outside world by transforming characters, collected items, and virtual lands into NFT. Decentraland has developed a virtual world where gamers can earn money by combining their virtual real estate with the platform's cryptocurrency. Users can use their MANA tokens to buy and sell all areas within Decentraland except public squares and roads. MANA can be traded on other external cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Coinbase. One of the most famous virtual real estate districts in VR is Genesis City, built on an area the size of Washington, D.C. Landowners within Decentraland are using MANA to create a platform for various businesses within the game, such as Vegas City, a gambling area where digital assets can be traded, and VR shopping. As of November 19, the most valuable virtual real estate transaction recorded on NonFungible is listed as 1,295,000 MANA (approximately $4.2 million). The Sandbox, a metadata gaming platform, allows users to create games and items directly within The platform, which they can then buy and sell. Users can also buy virtual real estate named \\\"LAND \\\"with the platform's token SAND. Axie Infinity is perhaps the most famous example of creating an in-game economy project. Here, players can buy monsters called \\\"Axie \\\"and breed them to make better Axie.Players start the game by purchasing 3 Axie. They can then use the SLP and AXS tokens they earn in the game to breed Axie. The new Axie bred in the process can be sold in the in-game market. As more and more new players join the platform, the opportunities for existing players to make money will continue to increase, since new players will have to buy Axie for the first time. Players can also generate capital gains by trading SLP and AXS tokens. \\\"Axie Infinity has established itself as the leading PlayToEarn (P2E) game with a global audience focused on the Philippines and South America.\\\" Experts predict that if all virtual and intangible assets are represented as NFT in the metasomes, the digital economy of the metasomes will reach a new level. Combining these two concepts will increase the incentive for users to trade virtual assets in various games and worlds. For example, users can sell virtual real estate on Decentraland and use the proceeds to purchase skins in Fortnite. According to Forbes, creating a true yuan world requires a transparent, traceable and interactive way of trading. Blockchains and cryptocurrencies are seen as one of the means to that end. As Forbes said: \\\"Clearly, the metasomes are still an emerging and rapidly evolving field, but the underlying fact is that in order to facilitate and realize a fully functioning metasomes, blockchain and cryptocurrency assets will need to play a prominent role in implementing this idea in the future.\\\" CoinDesk, a US specialist cryptocurrency media outlet, has a similar view: \\\"While no one can predict exactly what the metasurverse will look like, or when it will arrive in its final form, the importance of cryptocurrencies to its development is certain. As we look at the evolution of technologies like virtual reality and the way current industry leaders like Facebook are participating, advances in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies will play an equally important role in shaping the future of the metasurverse.\\\" Arthur Madrid, CEO and co-founder of The Sandbox, believes that with NFT, The metaverse is about to really take off. I think people are really blown away by the amount of money players spend on digital assets. Hundreds, thousands, even millions of dollars are spent on digital assets. I think making these assets NFT, building an NFT economy, will add a new layer to the existing digital economy.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1641298105,\"title\":\"When the metasverse meets the
