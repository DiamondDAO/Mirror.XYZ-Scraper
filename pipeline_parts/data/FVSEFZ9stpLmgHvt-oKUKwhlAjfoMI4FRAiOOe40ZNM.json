"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"There are many ways to do this:\\n\\nFirst, keep the overhead within a certain limit-put the ease of node operation above scalability.\\nAn efficient client that can better synchronize and store data.\\nCryptographic solutions such as statelessness and state validity.\\nCurrently, Bitcoin is still the easiest mainstream network to verify-anyone can run a Bitcoin node on a laptop. In contrast, Ethereum's threshold is much higher, although certain smart hardware configurations can be supported (mainly solid state drives are required). The user self-verification culture has not died out. Statelessness and state validity are the current two major tasks, which can effectively reduce the difficulty of running Ethereum nodes. In the short term, after the merger of Eth1 and Eth2, we will get an efficient light client. I only know these two projects that focus on security and decentralization.\\n\\nI will explain why this is so important later. You know, if a network cannot allow users to run their own nodes, the network cannot be called a license-free network. You are just replacing the government and bankers with a limited set of validators.\",\"timestamp\":1634225546,\"title\":\"What is the user verification culture\"},\"digest\":\"d2poEuhJch1IBLE3a-MbAACq3Gfbo9OUMijbTCXg3ik\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x83B2eC5c916f535819C2Dd3b058027C702d765Ac\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"SKrwwZKsJvkurbo930WwUfAM7nBfOs0nRZonqvv7oCE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YohuLJw4hXavueAjLT9lneLmeyPMKaLxsTwTz7Ltlfo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"qeVoWMeAiUw7KAVgEaXtzqsXrGMzxgwkRMTofCCAA_P69QCxhuoZasrkCZk3ZsBKiQZhzvSm_ZvFi7n4sgQqvQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x40218bb4258f1a3c13670d71c09001a83a0e818b71183e2b9edc3237d8dc9d7c4c9e01f0aa491feab588e4d66caccff44b3785b438dbe81c87111b27b07bc7f71b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"SKrwwZKsJvkurbo930WwUfAM7nBfOs0nRZonqvv7oCE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YohuLJw4hXavueAjLT9lneLmeyPMKaLxsTwTz7Ltlfo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"d2poEuhJch1IBLE3a-MbAACq3Gfbo9OUMijbTCXg3ik\"}"
