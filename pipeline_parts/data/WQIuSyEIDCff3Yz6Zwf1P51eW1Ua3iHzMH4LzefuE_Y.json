"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## First, let’s have a bit of DeFi history.\\n\\n***To be honest, I’m always wondering about new usecases for web3 and improvements that can be made on current DeFi, and I know many of you think the same.***\\n\\n***Why not have a quick talk about that?*** *(grab a coffee)*\\n\\nDespite being such a young industry, decentralized finance has quickly seen a lighting growth as real crypto enthusiasts found a way to truly live the world they’ve dreamed of, a decentralized universe where basically no banker could tell you to f-word off because you did not have the “*financial stability*” required to take a student loan, while monitoring and judging all your financial activity.\\n\\nAll of that, through **Ethereum**.\\n\\nNevertheless, as the network grew, more people onboarded, thus slowing the whole UX + making it more expensive, due to technical limitations (block-size, block-time etc…).\\n\\nAltough being negative for the users (in appearance), it was the condition to make Ethereum a truly secured and decentralized network, where pretty much anyone could participate and help it run with basic hardware and an internet connection.\\n\\n> *“To maximize the number of users who can run a node, we'll focus on regular consumer hardware.*\\n\\n*See “[The Limits to Blockchain Scalability](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html)” by Vitalik.*\\n\\nNowadays, users are offered multiple solutions to access DeFi services at way cheaper fees than on Ethereum, with faster transaction time. But at what cost?\\n\\nOther layer 1 solutions (especially PoS ones) rather bet on UX than decentralization and security, to not give any name. Moreover, most of them had their initial token distribution process aimed towards quick financing thus allowing insiders, VCs and other billion dollar worth companys/individuals to benefit from it way more than the average crypto user.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-Wx7s2yjWE5bwX1G6eIR6.png?height=720&width=1280)\\n\\nThis article is not about other L1s so I’ll try to be short, but please refer to the following documents and writings to know more about that specific debate which has set heat on CT (Crypto Twitter) and the whole “cryptosphere”.\\n\\n* ***[Different token distributions accross L1 projects](https://twitter.com/RyanWatkins_/status/1394283802009145348)***\\n* **[What does increased insider ownership in Public blockchains mean?](https://medium.com/open-source-x/what-does-increased-insider-ownership-in-public-blockchains-mean-97f8e9e50368)**\\n* ***Zhu Su’s famous “[Ethereum has abandonned its users](https://twitter.com/zhusu/status/1462216210116853762)” thread***\\n* ***[ETH vs DOT](https://academy.shrimpy.io/post/comparing-ethereum-vs-polkadot-blockchains)***\\n* ***[PoW vs. PoS](https://101blockchains.com/pow-vs-pos-a-comparison/)***\\n* ***Vitalik’s “[Endgame](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html)”***\\n* ***And many more, DYOR ;) …***\\n\\nNevertheless, this has not stopped people from using Ethereum. [Scaling](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/) solutions have been made (ex: [Layer 2 Rollups](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups/)). In late 2021, anyone can hop on a layer 2 and take profit from Ethereum security while paying significantly less on gas.\\n\\nAnyway, I think you got the point from here.\\n\\nNow, what if I told you could swap with zero fees on Ethereum? Without any slippage or price impact?\\n\\n## Introducing Kromatika, or what I see as “The most innovative solution against Ethereum swap fees”.\\n\\n### 1 - Uniswap v3\\n\\nBasically Kromatika does the same thing as Uniswap.\",\"timestamp\":1639607513,\"title\":\"What if you could swap for 0 fees on Ethereum?\"},\"digest\":\"gziK5J7VHSoYvqPoAQVpam94H0ww58oY5Px2ue0so08\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5feFDb8E576BDA70f63E8e8EdaAc7426C67C6B5a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ct5ohl38rNZBhwExogvAm6vISn7z0q64dzFQpcYgi48\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KyuvECTAC6fQ7dHMnvm5NmoOF4XZ6sw5kzYIRAs0oDw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"BLSGp0OEzdZ7poqpOoTXuEGvOrFzqxsFa3yLNLRLzyMO2fA4I6qc4RTn0hgaZZqxn-VCqs3m-pDRga6WartV0A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe48f00617b34aabbb8a78910a904a562c574a5acdf826862c58df4581c7998a7325710213a25ad920be2c4fbf1418fff3d46d4a1c4e140a68e6ecf096e1744ab1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ct5ohl38rNZBhwExogvAm6vISn7z0q64dzFQpcYgi48\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KyuvECTAC6fQ7dHMnvm5NmoOF4XZ6sw5kzYIRAs0oDw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"gziK5J7VHSoYvqPoAQVpam94H0ww58oY5Px2ue0so08\"}"
