"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1. Get on Discord now.  DAOs are all about building community.  Unlike Web2 projects, in Web3 always be building…community.  Our biggest mistake was not starting to build the community on Day 1.  We tried to have all the answers before launching which ended up costing us lots of wasted time.  Web 3 tip: you don’t need a great big strategy.  Identify the problem and spawn a community.  Get people at the ground level engaged in solving the problem with you.\\n2. Onboarding in DAOs is difficult.  You’re going to get lots of people who are curious about Web3.  That doesn’t mean they are necessarily interested in working on the DAO.  It can be difficult to filter out the signal from the noise.  In your Discord onboarding, it’s important to keep new members focused on the prize.  Much like you create an activation event in Web2 projects, you need to decide what will give new members that ‘aha’ moment as they learn about your project and get them there as quickly as possible.  We leveraged a first-quest challenge, where new members had to fill out a form that was aligned with the work we would be doing in the mission.  At first, we didn’t let anyone pass into the main channel until they filled out this form.  This hurt our conversion, but definitely helped us filter out the signal from the noise.  In our most recent iteration, we’ve added an intro channel where new members can intro themselves and ask for a guest pass to check out the vibe of the community.  This works better from a conversion perspective and time will tell if it’s better in engaging new members.\\n3. Be crypto native or 100% on chain.  Boris Wertz at Version One saved us a ton of headache with this advice.  What does being crypto native mean?  Well it means your product/business/mission needs to fully live within the Crypto world.  No off-ramps to Web2.  No last mile problem.  To Boris, we’re still in 1995-97 Internet.  In that era, you saw Google, eBay, Facebook build the initial plumbing of the internet before you saw Airbnb, Uber show up to the scene.  I’ve found this to be extremely valuable advice.\\n4. Funding in Web3 is very different from the Web2 game.  We started off with building a traditional investor deck and spent a lot of effort in the early days on making it look pretty.  You’ll notice a pattern of being stuck in Web2 thinking and realizing that the entire startup stack for Web3 is different, including how you fund it.  We realized once again, that if we were a Web3 company, we should be fully crypto native.  In Web3, leverage native-crypto crowdfunding sites like Mirror and Gitcoin which is doing some amazing things with it’s quadratic matching grants.  \\n5. Governance Governance Governance.  When you’re building a decentralized organization, you spend a lot more time thinking about governance in the early days.  How do we seed ideas from the community?  How do we decide what ideas to action?  It’s important to set a framework for how ideas come into the funnel and get all the way to becoming funded and actioned.  We used a simple Google Doc for our proposal template.  It contained the basics on structure, voting, timelines and funding in it.  We then used a sesh bot to coordinate a vote in the community for any proposals that were ready to vote on.  Later on, we worked with DAO tools like DAOHaus, but found the overall UX to be slower than what we needed and ended up abandoning it.  If I was to do this over, I would stick with a basic stack of Discord for community, Google Docs for proposals, Sesh.bot for voting and a Gnosis safe for storing and releasing funds from treasury.\\n6. Incentive Design - or everyone’s favourite question: What do I get out of this?  This one is tricky in Web3.  Web2 peeps rightfully value their time and expect to be paid for working on something.  In Web3, there’s a very loose relationship between all the work you’re doing and your end reward.  It’s one thing to form a founding team and expect people to put in sweat equity.  It’s another when you’re building a community on the fly and expecting people to prioritize their valuable time there and not have any clarity on what they’re getting.  On top of that, you have to be very careful about infringing on the ever changing landscape of securities law.  Specifically, if you associate a financial value to anything you’re doing in the early days, then you can be flagged as a security.  \",\"timestamp\":1639168731,\"title\":\"Lessons from launching a DAO\"},\"digest\":\"pitUV8vwQldRI0Qu99nrQihXuxmzz9rvkiT7YtwUwXY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x03798c0d62e6a0b0548114Fb6241EfA07ca4122d\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"TynWLg0R0osDs247hDqV_R07JK_INWfFlYxlG1DKgDI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"pVF48Go9KIQCLCTGH3S_Q6skN-0muPnBs0_eFch7y5I\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"sScA4PXpnQCLpfbC6kx9Fq_eaNBFeIE3GdYvcZ6akKHTg5ynY0c5sW_Evq3ZmCjbnzqWClfqV9SP_ibfmkpSYw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xcb190c13965f62b391b739dc9085c5bbb63fb46df5a5f48b588d7b359e43fbc13fb821f1989a029126177cc1e173472b478d20c270c2f842342fc0fcde8218391b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"TynWLg0R0osDs247hDqV_R07JK_INWfFlYxlG1DKgDI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"pVF48Go9KIQCLCTGH3S_Q6skN-0muPnBs0_eFch7y5I\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"pitUV8vwQldRI0Qu99nrQihXuxmzz9rvkiT7YtwUwXY\"}"
