"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Emily Dickinson suffered two great casualties of the heart—first Susan, then Kate. **On the latter:** \\n  \\n “I never lost as much but twice,” she would write. “Twice have I stood a beggar / Before the door of God!” \\n  \\n \\\"Why did you enter, sister, since you must depart? Had not its heart been torn enough but you must send your shred?\\\" \\n  \\n Maria brings the details out nicely: \\\"She dealt her pretty words like Blades— How glittering they shone— And every One unbared a Nerve Or wantoned with a Bone\\\" \\n  \\n The mystery behind \\\"Master\\\" was explored in the novel. Maria's supposition is that Emily's cryptic missives have more in common with Margaret Fuller’s letter to Beethoven than with the impassioned love letters Dickinson wrote to the living. Just like Whitman. “I read his writings reverently, and address’d him in print as ‘Master,’ and for a month or so thought of him as such,” Whitman recalled of his hero, then added the observation that “most young people of eager minds pass through this stage of exercise.” **For Master, Emily wrote:** \\n  \\n \\\"a love so big it scares her, rushing among her small heart—pushing aside the blood and leaving her faint (all) and white in the gust’s arm.” \\n  \\n **But the real poems were Susan and Emily, the others mere prose.** Maria notes in delight that Emily wasn't above sending fart jokes to her beloved just as she wasn't below writing on the solar eclipse. \\\"Every poet has trembled on the verge of science\\\". And what unbridled candor Emily had for Susan: \\n  \\n \\\"have only mourned for you; now I begin to hope for you.\\\" \\n  \\n “With the exception of Shakespeare, you have told me of more knowledge than any one living—To say that sincerely is strange praise.” \\n  \\n \\\"and the great world grows wider…every day you stay away—I\\\" \\n  \\n \\\"I sigh for you again; little sigh, and vain sigh, which will not bring you home.\\\" \\n  \\n \\\"In a Life that has stopped guessing, you and I should not feel at home,” \\n  \\n \\\"What can I do towards you?—dearer you cannot be, for I love you so already, that it almost breaks my heart—perhaps I can love you anew, every day of my life\\\" \\n  \\n \\\"A “little path just wide enough for two who love” \\n  \\n \\\"Would nestle close to your warm heart….Is there any room there for me, or shall I wander away all homeless and alone?\\\" \\n  \\n Susan, whose feelings for Emily, were less symmetrical than the Emily's parted hair in her daguerreotype. The star Emily choose out of all the others in the sky, her \\\"only woman in the world\\\". In the last quarter of her life, Emily wrote at her miniature desk, received visitors as a disembodied presence conversing with them through the parlor door, and rarely left her bedroom—not even for her mother’s funeral. But from the chamber of her seclusion, she kept on reaching for Susan. \\n  \\n Sue who, as Maria pointed out, perhaps wasn't constitutionally able to match Emily's unslakable intensity, and ended up marrying Emily's brother, remaining at least a shore Emily could return to again and again. Susan ultimately had her practicality returned for infidelity. Austin, a lawyer Maria described as someone who held a disdain for laughter even on Sundays, awakened in the October of his life to find that his self was not a static monolith after all. He wrote to his mistress, Mabel, abloom with exultation and disrobed of inhibition: \\n  \\n \\\"And yet, my darling, my darling you have given me in these weeks more than all life before—incomparably more.\\\" \\n  \\n Mabel transposed a cosmetic zest for life onto Austin, casting their love as part miracle and part inevitability, governed by the same forces that govern the universe: I love you. I love you! Why should I! and why shouldn’t I! Who made & who rules the human heart! Where is the wrong in preferring sunshine to shadow! \\n  \\n And it is Mabel, we should perhaps thank, the one Emily sent wine and verses from the bedroom above Beethoven, who typed up hundreds of poems over which she held no copyright. \\n  \\n Susan's name was cut out and gender changed to make Emily's poetry more palatable to the readers of those inhospitable times. Is that why Emily frequently addressed herself as a male, signing letters to her cousins as “Brother Emily,” calling herself a “boy,” “prince,” “earl,” or “duke” in various poems, in one of which she unsexed herself in a violent transfiguration: \\\"Amputate my freckled Bosom! Make me bearded like a Man!\\\"? \\n  \\n She was ahead of her times, and possibly even ours. \\n  \\n The other thing that stood out was **Emily's integrity to her work**. Maria mentioned that Dickinson was proud to be a poet, proud of her verse—so proud she bound her poems with a darning needle, shared them readily in letters to friends, tied them to loaves of bread she baked for ill neighbors, and was only half facetious when she envisioned that they “Will entertain the Centuries When I, am long ago, An Island in dishonored Grass— / Whom none but Daisies, know—” \\n  \\n Emily's editor remarked at the self-possession with which she had upheld her peculiar style and resisted his edits over the decades: “After all, when a thought takes one’s breath away, a lesson on grammar seems an impertinence.” \\n  \\n We know her **thoughts on fame.** “If fame belonged to me,” she had told Higginson at the outset of their correspondence, “I could not escape her.” She was certainly ambivalent about fame—“a fickle food / Upon a shifting plate,” she called it in one poem. In another, she wrote: Fame is a bee. It has a song— It has a sting— Ah, too, it has a wing. \\n  \\n The poems had suffered the very fate Dickinson had feared, Maria states, and fiercely resisted in her lifetime—her dashes had been shorn, her unconventional yet intentional capitalizations bulldozed, her deliberately untitled verses given toothless titles. The editors had even fiddled with some of the language to rein in the choreographed startlement of her off-rhymes. And yet beneath the surface mutilations pulsed an irrepressible might that gripped literature by the cerebellum and shook out a new species of poetic consciousness. \\n  \\n In the midst of the chapters, **some writing advise is found as well:** “there is no severer test of literary training than in the power to prune out your most cherished sentence, when you find that the sacrifice will help the symmetry or vigor of the whole”; don’t show off your erudition but showcase its fruits; and remember that “a phrase may outweigh a library.” \\n  \\n \\\"accumulated volumes have labored in vain to utter: there may be years of crowded passion in a word\\\" \\n  \\n \\\"If by the training of a lifetime one could succeed in producing one continuous page of perfect cadence, it would be a life well spent, and such a literary artist would fall short of Nature’s standard in quantity only, not in quality.\\\" \\n  \\n \\\"If I read a book which makes my whole body so cold no fire ever can warm me,” Emily said, “I know that is poetry. If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry.” \\n  \\n And here's a little something on **Emily's genius:** \\\"quick as the electric spark of her intuitions and analyses, she seized the kernel instantly, almost impatient of the fewest words by which she must make her revelation.” \\n\\nConstraints bring out creativity. Emily wrote 1700 poems on a 17 inches desk.\",\"timestamp\":1639115975,\"title\":\"Book Snippet: Figuring (Maria Popova; Emily Dickinson)\"},\"digest\":\"tzmHbP_z0UhOWEC2I7W5aRKWWMbJ1Pm3j1aUwuqTpHk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x23860B3E7000fa31B3081592Bd54434e789E2365\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wqjRmf4wq4AHoyKBHMumkrTIHTi9dbC6XMSwnEl4BQg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Yvs2QX2QJ4l8nURmbiK-59ydPIHYaAhxLR5HBP5Nvno\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"OLOGMmH9VkQkT2ogDgLWruhqnn-JuD7csClt6PvfJElnVpAXupt-sLx_yzyo-4-a3RT77BLcvLMqQ2xfO2xWJw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x32b2557184a4d32c18b9b17dd878c6165dddc2ff635cdf97b9ac56b87b021db768a14c865555bbca4451140e99856e935679ef1fb3c279bfada35ebb1c5da5eb1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wqjRmf4wq4AHoyKBHMumkrTIHTi9dbC6XMSwnEl4BQg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Yvs2QX2QJ4l8nURmbiK-59ydPIHYaAhxLR5HBP5Nvno\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rk18b6FVIvo4UsCBOKncVbOOoFcs6doZX8050S_Rsio\"}"
