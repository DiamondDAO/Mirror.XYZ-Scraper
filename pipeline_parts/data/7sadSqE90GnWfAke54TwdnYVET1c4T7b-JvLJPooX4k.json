Olympus V2 is a massive step forward for the protocol.\\n\\nIf you want to do a quick read about what OlympusDAO is and what features are coming in Olympus V2. I would recommend reading this thread ðŸ˜ƒ.\\n\\n## Before How, let see why?\\n\\n* Olympus V2 brings a more on-chain governance-based structure to Olympus. It is crucial for the future operations of the protocol, and the roadmap it has set itself to.\\n* No wait time for the purchased bond to complete vesting. V2 auto stakes bonds on purchase so that users can earn staking rewards until the vesting period is done.\\n* Lots more features are coming for bonding. like being able to hold bonds as NFTs (could enable a secondary bond market), Newer term periods for bonding (fixed-term & fixed-expiration).\\n* The transition from sOHM (v1) to gOHM (v2) enables the purchase of multiple bonds at once, instead of one at a time limitation with V1.\\n\\n## How to migrate?\\n\\n* Once V2 is live, the [Olympus front-end](https://www.olympusdao.finance/) will update to allow users to migrate all V1 assets to gOHM.\\n* Users have to approve the contract once for each V1 token they own (OHM, sOHM, wsOHM) and finally approve one more time for the actual migration of assets to V2.\\n* Once the user initiates migration to V2, then all tokens must be migrated. any partial migration is not allowed. And after migration to V2 is done, the assets canâ€™t be rolled back to V1.\\n\\n## Useful information for the upgrade to V2\\n\\n* wsOHM V1 will be replaced by gOHM (same, but built with a focus on governance), OHM & sOHM will have V2 counterparts. For V2, the ticker remains the same, just update the V2 token contract in the wallet for the assets to properly reflect.\\n* While migrating OHM V1 & sOHM V1 it will be converted to gOHM. the gOHM token balance received will differ but its **$USD value will remain the same.**\\n* If you are migrating 50 OHM, 50 sOHM you will receive 10 gOHM totally given that the [current index](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/basics/basics#how-do-i-track-my-rebase-rewards) is 10. Whereas migrating 50 wsOHM will give 50 gOHM as it's a non-index-based token. (note that after migration the $USD value will remain the same even though the token value is reduced)\\n* gOHM will still earn rebase rewards even though its quantity doesn't change after rebasing like sOHM. It is because it is tied to the [current index](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/basics/basics#how-do-i-track-my-rebase-rewards). *(gOHM price = OHM price \\\\* current index)*\\n* All V2-related contracts are live, and some of them are still under the audit process. Once all the audits are done they will be updated [here](https://olympusdao.medium.com/).\\n\\n## What if I donâ€™t migrate?\\n\\n* Users will have 2 months' time to migrate to V2 after the update goes live, Partial liquidity will remain in V1 to ease the process for users to migrate to V2 once they are able.\\n* But, once the V2 update goes live some pools and partners will only accept V2 assets live gOHM, and all V2 feature like the auto-staked bond is exclusive. To be able to use those features, the user has to update to V2.\\n\\n> For more updates on Olympus v2 do not miss out on the Migration AMA event.\\n>\\n> FOHMO4 date: Dec 12\\n>\\n> Event Overview: Learn about the Olympus ecosystem, alpha leaks, industry speakers, v2 migration\",\"timestamp\":1640776556,\"title\":\"OlympusV2 â€” How & Why to migrate? - Dee - Medium\"},\"digest\":\"swUkx9dzPCMBaXK0aslIOH34xNcehrEXFezj6cSfFMs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7c0E52f0e1168086c5Ee02e0fE84a3885e7b6774\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kiRWm6w1kDbNcIlGZhF3MYcfUx03buAH4GuB7MgWlR4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"c3MgsBT2AYM7mBXoVjBknDqrIBomlvnaeDMbBCtvfdU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"f7oj8MOCFJuOfQ9bdgU-CcBOLEKyyx0jx3KkKJhM3epwilrJcvdVXstz1A-8yOzG7WjrAwu2LFpA3Lbo3nTzqg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x80d9e088dec998a7e58b3210ecda4c268153f50ba905aca32178b819692c07de32894785c242448dcb92aaec2f4dc7f3110df05b1c05f8e39ad67672ca04d7991b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kiRWm6w1kDbNcIlGZhF3MYcfUx03buAH4GuB7MgWlR4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"c3MgsBT2AYM7mBXoVjBknDqrIBomlvnaeDMbBCtvfdU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"swUkx9dzPCMBaXK0aslIOH34xNcehrEXFezj6cSfFMs\"}"
