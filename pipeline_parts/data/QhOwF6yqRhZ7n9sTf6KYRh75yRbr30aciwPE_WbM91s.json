"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The construction of Web2.0 was driven by the capital, and the capital is also richly rewarded. They want to extend the logic of investment and profit to the Era of Web3.0. However, such profit expectation conflicts with the inherent nature of Web3.0, where everything, including identity, data and wealth, is generated and controlled by users themselves. It is hard to imagine capital allowing all this. Of course capital still has its uses,  but it must first fit into the vision of decentralization, so we can expect the battle for control to be protracted, and the people will be the winners,it's technically understandable.\\n\\nThis is not to say that web3.0 is incompatible with capitalism. It is definitely not. Web3.0 is a beautiful flower bred by capitalism,it is an ode to capitalism. What is incompatible with web3.0 is capital institutionalism. We must distinguish between capitalist institutionalism and capitalism.\",\"timestamp\":1640505106,\"title\":\"Crypto populism will win the future\"},\"digest\":\"OV310gVip3fzrloVnly_NWaVn1l5Zdo9KHK2X5Uy3jY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x684f658FF0006d40cEB7657eDc9a469f1ad029D6\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4SQjaevrGBMcLrDV9bKIrpqfpiFeiKd4eygd6j2dQGg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"aDHbPv-9bd_Rh0iNAZedUox3kjyYm_wNoFfQaRh0Rp0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ORBk11I4XITF1EA5efP7v7h1Sxal6CbsNyCt9t3nooRbwHI4DGhs_shI-DPFmuoUUZVTsLd9HZUjuxX-XEyOUQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa1a0e6ecf7a15cecf009129561cd5be07df021e2e43c37610cd5da59a0dcf97007d11b36c3a2345b50471362874c84df7f614e90635644479b5fa6cb5fc4d9c11c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4SQjaevrGBMcLrDV9bKIrpqfpiFeiKd4eygd6j2dQGg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"aDHbPv-9bd_Rh0iNAZedUox3kjyYm_wNoFfQaRh0Rp0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"OV310gVip3fzrloVnly_NWaVn1l5Zdo9KHK2X5Uy3jY\"}"
