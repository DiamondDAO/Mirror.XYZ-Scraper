A count of at least five although the devastation left in their wake could have been the work of a hundred. Possibly a variety of pixie or aos sí although I have not made visual contact.\\n\\nI know I was supposed to take a proper holiday to recover from the `[redacted]` Sasquatch incident. And I was. I promise I was. I’m at my uncle’s on the coast and we planned to spend a leisurely afternoon helping his new lady friend unpack a crate of family heirlooms sent from Trethevy, England following the death of her cousin.\\n\\nBut when we arrived the poor woman was outside in her slippers, braced against the front door. She said that when she opened the crate there were bats inside the grandfather clock. Hair had been yanked from her scalp.\\n\\nThe `[redacted]` Inn sits right on the beach. She pointed to the low tide line. Evidently several cryptids escaped and sought shelter in the roots of the petrified forest. Minuscule humanoid footprints with six toes were visible in the sand. When we went back inside, the foyer mirror had been shattered, wallpaper raked from the walls as if with claws, and the laces were gone from a dozen shoes on the shelf by the door.\\n\\nI do not know what they intend to do with those laces, or if all of these creatures have escaped the inn. But they are violent and unpredictable. Events like this in a small seaside town will not go unnoticed. The population here is elderly and vulnerable.\\n\\nIt looks like this vacation has turned into an assignment. `[redacted]` needs to get down here. Tell them that yes, we are chasing fairies and they need to pack more than an umbrella for the rain.\\n\\nIt still rains in the winter here, at least.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EKn0fshQS47mx_I6agXlg.png?height=69&width=1300)\\n\\n`[end of transmission]`\\n\\n> [THE AGENCY](https://discord.gg/mU3aRrU7b5)\\n> `twitter` [@cryptozagency](https://twitter.com/cryptozagency)\",\"timestamp\":1639954233,\"title\":\"Field Report: tiny winged humanoids reported in US—Aos Sí crossing the Atlantic?\",\"publication\":\"crypto-z\"},\"digest\":\"gIP8fXB9YIBKwWAV03Tk11ZAp5jMKGe34-38HNx-Y-0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xdc2ad7A70B8BC6cC4D974D69F973df5fcc215144\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"A-KIIRcCD5dt2LTB1EO4CNylFCoiUbgTskS5i8kZGQA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"n8XwRfkgUjf_uns2a09VWJBcsecTRSchvHuK4S6nmC8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"1jhCnHG05RA9ypP-U-PE8GUrvDHY-b9OTE1eA6QGS-pgeq_BGCfcBUZ15ynYGqpBFJOR4i-BRuehuUQ5MlcA8g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa361f180ee60ef6eeaea7923d9045c1b3794f3a5652a1d6f749c2a6ce74deba526888b5de571cc225a3c2ae0d1782b8ddb272ed5b5716af152ad2171a4b4f7221c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on crypto-z.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"A-KIIRcCD5dt2LTB1EO4CNylFCoiUbgTskS5i8kZGQA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"n8XwRfkgUjf_uns2a09VWJBcsecTRSchvHuK4S6nmC8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"9XUjMMrNAAvkRYc3HucvjHxE9nFmw7qFZSvqP0qN0pk\"}"
