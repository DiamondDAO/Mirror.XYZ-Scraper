Investors use specific metrics to determine which startup to invest their resources in to increase future value. This article sheds light on the metrics that matter to investors and the difference between vanity and actionable metrics. It concludes with notable metrics validations that indicate that your startup is experiencing healthy growth.\\n\\n## Must-Have Metrics for Your Investors\\n\\nYour startup’s investor trades their funds for some ownership in your startup for future profit and value. Before proceeding to invest funds in a startup, investors need to get complete details of specific metrics. These metrics are essential to determine the future valuation and growth projection of any startup.\\n\\nThe first indicator an investment looks at is how profitable a startup is in its business. An investor will want to know how you are solving the customer’s problem and if your startup is worthy of the financial commitment. In addition, some Key Performance Indicators (KPI) are helpful for financial analytics purposes for calculating a startup’s profitability.\\n\\nHowever, there is no right way to be entirely sure which startup will scale and reach its potential and not rise. One go-to strategy for identifying startups and businesses that will become profitable in the end is via financial ratios. Using this strategy provides analysis for identifying stocks with little value but can become more valuable in the future.\\n\\nFor investors to use financial ratios to calculate profitability analysis, the KPIs below are must-have indicators that evaluate and share actionable information about your startup.\\n\\n### 1. Sales Revenue\\n\\nRevenue from sales is probably one of the most important metrics that an investor is interested in seeing. This metric indicates how the solution and service offering is performing in the marketplace. The evaluation of the startup’s sales highlights the success of the product or services of the startup. This metric is helpful to plot and monitor the growth and performance of the startup.\\nCalculating the revenue from sales is as easy as subtracting the cost of returned products or undelivered goods from overall sales income.\\n\\n###  2. Gross Margin\\n\\nThis measures how much of the revenue from sales goes towards profits and other associated costs. Gross margin indicates how profitable the startup is declaring to its investors and how much it’s reinvesting within itself. This metric also highlights the possibility of startup profitability from selling its products or services. It highlights how efficient the startup’s production processes are and what its current pricing power dictates. If a startup has a high gross margin, it is retaining a high percentage of its sales revenue. It is vice versa if it has a low margin.\\n\\n### 3. Net Profit Margin\\n\\nPredicting the long-term growth of a startup is possible via the net profit margin metric. This metric is vital to investors as it points out an organization’s ability to generate profit after removing all the associating expenses from the revenue. This figure is a percentage expression of profit generation for every $1 in sales. The larger the net profit margin, the more profit is kept.\\n\\n### 4. Operating Profit\\n\\nOperating profit is another important metric that indicates whether a recent trend is continuing or not. Operating profit means the remaining profit when the operational cost is subtracted from the gross profit, which helps gauge the efficiency of a startup in producing its goods or services and the cost requirements. Security analysts use this metric to determine future figures and the valuation of a company.\\n\\n### 5. Retention Rate\\n\\nThe retention rate of a startup speaks volumes to its investors. Their active users are significant for repeat purchases and revenue generation. Asides from that, organic marketing via customer retention is seamless. This is because happy customers tend to recommend and advertise the company’s products or services that they are comfortable using. This results in more repeat purchases and more sales.\\n\\n### 6. Customer Acquisition Cost\\n\\nMarketing and strategic advertisement to create awareness towards the services of the company cost money. Businesses take some measures and strategic initiatives to acquire new customers. The targeting of the customer base they desire is the customer acquisition cost. The figure for the customer acquisition cost shows how much your startup is spending on its marketing to gain new customers during that period.\\n\\n### 7. Customer Lifetime Value\\n\\nThe Customer Lifetime Value indicates the customer’s revenue for a startup when they remain a returning buyer. This mainly applies to startups using a subscription or membership model for their solution. If your startup uses a subscription product, calculating the lifetime value of your customer is an essential metric for your investors to see. This metric helps investors understand how much a lifetime value is worth, how much needs to go into customer acquisition, and your startup’s profitability projection.\\n\\n### 8. Churn Rate\\n\\nIt is a standard expectation to expect some of your startup’s customers to drop off at some point. The rate at which your startup’s paying customer drops off is your churn rate. This metric helps investors understand how your startup retains its paying customer. This figure should be as low as possible.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAs a startup, deadlines for achieving set metrics are essential for investors to consider. Startups’ vision and mission statements help them understand the purpose and what they are trying to achieve. Those deadlines tell the story of how productive a startup is, how the business is meeting expectations, the number of milestones, and the potential of the company to scale.\\n\\nKeeping your investors and major stakeholders informed about your metrics progress is a crucial communication skill that we at [Fundrs.VC](https://www.fundrs.vc/?utm_campaign=digest&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) value the most.
