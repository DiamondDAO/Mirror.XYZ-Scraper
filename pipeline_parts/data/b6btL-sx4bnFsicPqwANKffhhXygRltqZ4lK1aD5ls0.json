"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"in which he spent six hours on six days of the week in arranging the indexes of a voluminous library of manuscript letter-books. It was rarely indeed that he was disturbed by the presence of any visitor. When, therefore, his door was opened by one of the messengers, and he was informed that Lady Albury desired to see him, he was for the moment a good deal disturbed. No option, however, was given to him as to refusing admission to Lady Albury. She was in the room before the messenger had completed his announcement, and had seated herself in one of the two spare chairs which the room afforded as soon as the door was closed. \\\"Mr Dosett,\\\" she said, \\\"I have taken the great liberty of calling to say a few words about your niece, Miss Ayala Dormer.\\\"\\n\\nWhen the lady was first announced, Mr Dosett, in his confusion, had failed to connect the name which he had heard with that of the lady who had invited Ayala to her house. But now he recognised it, and knew who it was that had come to him. \\\"You were kind enough\\\", he said, \\\"to invite my little girl to your house some weeks ago.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And now I have come to invite her again.\\\"\\n\\nMr Dosett was now more disturbed than ever. With what words was he to refuse the request which this kind but very grand lady was about to make? How could he explain to her all those details as to his own poverty, and as to Ayala's fate in having to share that poverty with him? How could he explain the unfitness of Ayala's temporary sojourn with people so wealthy and luxurious? And yet were he to yield in the least how could he face his wife on his return home to the Crescent? \\\"You are very kind, Lady Albury,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"We particularly wish to have her about the end of the first week in November,\\\" said the lady. \\\"Her friend Nina Baldoni will be there, and one or two others whom she knows. We shall try to be a little gay for a week or two.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have no doubt it would be gay, and we at home are very dull.\\\" \\\"Do you not think a little gaiety good for young people?\\\" said her ladyship, using the very argument which poor Mr Dosett had so often attempted to employ on Ayala's behalf.\\n\\n\\\"Yes; a little gaiety,\\\" he said, as though deprecating the excessive amount of hilarity which he imagined to prevail at Stalham.\\n\\n\\\"Of course you do,\\\" said Lady Albury. \\\"Poor little girl! I have heard so much about her, and of all your goodness to her. Mrs Dosett, I know, is another mother to her; but still a little country air could not but be beneficial. Do say that she shall come to us, Mr Dosett.\\\"\\n\\nThen Mr Dosett felt that, disagreeable as it was, he must preach the sermon which his wife had preached to him, and he did preach it. He spoke timidly of his own poverty, and the need which there was that Ayala should share it. He spoke a word of the danger which might come from luxury, and of the discontent which would be felt when the girl returned to her own home. Something he added of the propriety of like living with like, and ended by praying that Ayala might be excused. The words came from him with none of that energy which his wife would have used -- were uttered in a low melancholy drone; but still they were words hard to answer, and called upon Lady Albury for all her ingenuity in finding an argument against them.\\n\\nBut Lady Albury was strong-minded, and did find an argument. \\\"You mustn't be angry with me,\\\" she said, \\\"if I don't quite agree with you. Of course you wish to do the best you can for this dear child.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Indeed I do, Lady Albury.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How is anything then to be done for her if she remains shut up in your house? You do not, if I understand, see much company yourselves.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"None at all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You won't be angry with me for my impertinence in alluding to it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not in the least. It is the fact that we live altogether to ourselves.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And the happiest kind of life too for married people,\\\" said Lady Albury, who was accustomed to fill her house in the country with a constant succession of visitors, and to have engagements for every night of the week in town. \\\"But for young people it is not quite so good. How is a young lady to get herself settled in life?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Settled?\\\" asked Mr Dosett, vaguely.\\n\\n\\\"Married,\\\" suggested Lady Albury, more plainly. Mr Dosett shook his head. No idea on the subject had ever flashed across his mind. To provide bread and meat, a bed and clothes, for his sister's child he had felt to be a duty -- but not a husband. Husbands came, or did not -- as the heavens might be propitious. That Ayala should go to Stalham for the sake of finding a husband was certainly beyond the extent of his providing care. \\\"In fact how is a girl to have a chance at all unless she is allowed to see someone? Of course I don't say this with reference to our house. There will be no young men there, or anything of that kind. But, taking a broad view, unless you let a girl like that have what chances come in her way how is she to get on? I think you have hardly a right to do it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We have done it for the best.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am sure of that, Mr Dosett. And I hope you will tell Mrs Dosett, with my compliments, how thoroughly I appreciate her goodness. I should have called upon her instead of coming here, only that I cannot very well get into that part of the town.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will tell her what you are good enough to say.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Poor Ayala! I am afraid that her other aunt, Aunt Tringle, was not as good to her as your wife. I have heard about how all that occurred in Rome. She was very much admired there. I am told that she is perfectly lovely.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Pretty well.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A sort of beauty that we hardly ever see now -- and very, very clever.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ayala is clever, I think.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She ought to have her chance. She ought indeed. I don't think you quite do your duty by such a girl as that unless you let her have a chance. She is sure to get to know people, and to be asked from one house to another. I speak plainly, for I really think you ought to let her come.\\\"\\n\\nAll this sank deeply into the heart of Uncle Reginald. Whether it was for good or evil it seemed to him at the moment to be unanswerable. If there was a chance of any good thing for Ayala, surely it could not be his duty to bar her from that chance. A whole vista of new views in reference to the treatment of young ladies was opened to him by the words of his visitor. Ayala certainly was pretty. Certainly she was clever. A husband with an income would certainly be a good thing. Embryo husbands with incomes do occasionally fall in love with pretty girls. But how can any pretty girl be fallen in love with unless someone be permitted to see her? At Kingsbury Crescent there was not a man to be seen from one end of the year to another. It occurred to him now, for the first time, that Ayala by her present life was shut out from any chance of marriage. It was manifestly true that he had no right to seclude her in that fashion. At last he made a promise, rashly, as he felt at the very moment of making it, that he would ask his wife to allow Ayala to go to Stalham. Lady Albury of course accepted this as an undertaking that Ayala should come, and went away triumphant.\\n\\nMr Dosett walked home across the parks with a troubled mind, thinking much of all that had passed between him and the lady of fashion. It was with great difficulty that he could quite make up his mind which was right -- the lady of fashion or his wife. If Ayala was to live always as they lived at Kingsbury Crescent, if it should in process of time be her fate to marry some man in the same class as themselves, if continued care as to small pecuniary needs was to be her future lot, then certainly her comfort would only be disturbed by such a visit as that now proposed. And was it not probable that such would be the destiny in store for her? Mr Dosett knew the world well enough to be aware that all pretty girls such as Ayala cannot find rich husbands merely by exhibiting their prettiness. Kingsbury Crescent, unalloyed by the dangers of Stalham, would certainly be the most secure. But then he had been told that Ayala now had special chances offered to her, and that he had no right to rob her of those chances. He felt this the more strongly, because she was not his daughter -- only his niece. With a daughter he and his wife might have used their own judgment without check. But now he had been told that he had no right to rob Ayala of her chances, and he felt that he had not the right. By the time that he reached Kingsbury Crescent he had, with many misgivings, decided in favour of Stalham.\\n\\nIt was now some weeks since the first invitation had been refused, and during those weeks life had not been pleasant at the Crescent. Ayala moped and pined as though some great misfortune had fallen upon her. When she had first come to the Crescent she had borne herself bravely, as a man bears a trouble when he is conscious that he has brought it on himself by his own act, and is proud of the act which has done it. But when that excitement has gone, and the trouble still remains, the pride wears off, and the man is simply alive to his suffering. So it had been with Ayala. Then had come the visit to Brook Street. When, soon after that, she was invited to Stalham, it seemed as though a new world was being opened to her. There came a moment when she could again rejoice that she had quarrelled with her Aunt Emmeline. This new world would be a much better world than the Tringle world. Then had come the great blow, and it had seemed to her as though there was nothing but Kingsbury Crescent before her for the rest of her wretched life.\\n\\nThere was not a detail of all this hidden from the eyes of Aunt Margaret. Stalham had decided that Aunt Margaret was ugly and uninteresting. Stalham, according to its own views, was right. Nevertheless the lady in Kingsbury Crescent had both eyes to see and a heart to feel. She was hot of temper, but she was forgiving. She liked her own way, but she was affectionate. She considered it right to teach her niece the unsavoury mysteries of economy, but she was aware that such mysteries must be distasteful to one brought up as Ayala. Even when she had been loudest in denouncing Ayala's mutiny, her heart had melted in ruth because Ayala had been so unhappy. She, too, had questioned herself again and again as to the justness of her decision. Was she entitled to rob Ayala of her chances? In her frequent discussions with her husband she still persisted in declaring that Kingsbury Crescent was safe, and that Stalham would be dangerous. But, nevertheless, in her own bosom she had misgivings. As she saw the poor girl mope and weary through one day after another, she could not but have misgivings.\\n\\n\\\"I have had that Lady Albury with me at the office today, and have almost promised that Ayala shall go to her on the 8th of November.\\\" It was thus that Mr Dosett rushed at once into his difficulty as soon as he found himself upstairs with his wife. \\\"You have?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, my dear, I almost did. She said a great deal, and I could not but agree with much of it. Ayala ought to have her chances.\\\" \\\"What chances?\\\" demanded Mrs Dosett, who did not at all like the expression.\\n\\n\\\"Well; seeing people. She never sees anybody here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nobody is better than some people,\\\" said Mrs Dosett, meaning to be severe on Lady Albury's probable guests.\\n\\n\\\"But if a girl sees nobody,\\\" said Mr Dosett, \\\"she can have no -- no -- no chances.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She has the chance of wholesome victuals,\\\" said Mrs Dosett, \\\"and I don't know what other chances you or I can give her.\\\" \\\"She might see -- a young man.\\\" This Mr Dosett said very timidly. \\\"A young fiddlestick! A young man! Young men should be waited for till they come naturally, and never thought about if they don't come at all. I hate this looking after young men. If there wasn't a young man for the next dozen years we should do better -- so as just to get out of the way of thinking about them for a time.\\\" This was Mrs Dosett's philosophy; but in spite of her philosophy she did yield, and on that night it was decided that Ayala after all was to be allowed to go to Stalham.\\n\\nTo Mr Dosett was deputed the agreeable task of telling Ayala on the next evening what was to befall her. If anything agreeable was to be done in that sombre house it was always deputed to the master.\\n\\n\\\"What!\\\" said Ayala, jumping from her chair.\\n\\n\\\"On the eighth of November,\\\" said Mr Dosett.\\n\\n\\\"To Stalham?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lady Albury was with me yesterday at the office, and your aunt has consented.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Uncle Reginald!\\\" said Ayala, falling on her knees, and hiding her face on his lap. Heaven had been once more opened to her. \\\"I'll never forget it,\\\" said Ayala, when she went to thank her aunt -- \\\"never.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I only hope it may not do you a mischief.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And I beg your pardon, Aunt Margaret, because I was -- I was -- because I was -- \\\" She could not find the word which would express her own delinquency, without admitting more than she intended to admit -- \\\"too self-asserting, considering that I am only a young girl.\\\" That would have been her meaning could she have found appropriate words.\\n\\n\\\"We need not go back to that now,\\\" said Aunt Margaret.\\n\\nCHAPTER 23 STALHAM PARK\\n\\nOn the day fixed Ayala went down to Stalham. A few days before she started there came to her a letter, or rather an envelope, from her uncle Sir Thomas, enclosing a cheque for L#20. The Tringle women had heard that Ayala had been asked to Stalham, and had mentioned the visit disparagingly before Sir Thomas. \\\"I think it very wrong of my poor brother,\\\" said Lady Tringle. \\\"She can't have a shilling even to get herself gloves.\\\" This had an effect which had not been intended, and Sir Thomas sent the cheque for L#20. Then Ayala felt not only that the heavens were opened to her but that the sweetest zephyrs were blowing her upon her course. Thoughts as to gloves had disturbed her, and as to some shoes which were wanting, and especially as to a pretty hat for winter wear. Now she could get hat, and shoes and gloves, and pay her fare, and go down to Stalham with money in her pocket. Before going she wrote a very pretty note to her Uncle Tom.\\n\\nOn her arrival she was made much of by everyone. Lady Albury called her the caged bird, and congratulated her on her escape from the bars. Sir Harry asked her whether she could ride to hounds. Nina gave her a thousand kisses. But perhaps her greatest delight was in finding that Jonathan Stubbs was at Albury. She had become so intimate with the Colonel that she regarded him quite like an old friend; and when a girl has a male friend, though he may be much less loved, or not loved at all, he is always more pleasant, or at any rate more piquant, than a female friend. As for love with Colonel Stubbs that was quite out of the question. She was sure that he would never fall in love with herself. His manner to her was altogether unlike that of a lover. A lover would be smooth, soft, poetic, and flattering. He was always a little rough to her -- sometimes almost scolding her. But then he scolded her as she liked to be scolded -- with a dash of fun and a greatly predominating admixture of good nature. He was like a bear -- but a bear who would always behave himself pleasantly. She was delighted when Colonel Stubbs congratulated her on her escape from Kingsbury Crescent, and felt that he was justified by his intimacy when he called Mrs Dosett a mollified she-Cerberus.\\n\\n\\\"Are you going to make one of my team?\\\" said the Colonel to her on the morning after her arrival. It was a non-hunting morning, and the gentlemen were vacant about the house till they went out for a little shooting later in the day.\\n\\n\\\"What team?\\\" said Ayala, feeling that she had suddenly received a check to her happiness. She knew that the Colonel was alluding to those hunting joys which were to be prepared for Nina, and which were far beyond her own reach. That question of riding gear is terrible to young ladies who are not properly supplied. Even had time admitted she would not have dared to use her uncle's money for such a purpose, in the hope that a horse might be lent to her. She had told herself that it was out of the question, and had declared to herself that she was too thankful for her visit to allow any regret on such a matter to cross her mind. But when the Colonel spoke of his team there was something of a pang. How she would have liked to be one of such a team!\\n\\n\\\"My pony team. I mean to drive two. You mustn't think that I am taking a liberty when I say that they are to be called Nina and Ayala.\\\"\\n\\nThere was no liberty at all. Had he called her simply Ayala she would have felt it to be no more than pleasant friendship, coming from him. He was so big, and so red, and so ugly, and so friendly! Why should he not call her Ayala? But as to that team -- it could not be. \\\"If it's riding,\\\" she said demurely, \\\"I can't be one of the ponies.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is riding -- of course. Now the Marchesa is not here, we mean to call it hunting in a mild way.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can't,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"But you've got to do it, Miss Dormer.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I haven't got anything to do it with. Of course, I don't mind telling you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are to ride the sweetest little horse that ever was foaled -- just bigger than a pony. It belongs to Sir Harry's sister who is away, and we've settled it all. There never was a safer little beast, and he can climb through a fence without letting you know that it's there.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I mean -- clothes,\\\" said Ayala. Then she whispered, \\\"I haven't got a habit, or anything else anybody ought to have.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah,\\\" said the Colonel; \\\"I don't know anything about that. I should say that Nina must have managed that. The horse department was left to me, and I have done my part. You will find that you will have to go out next Tuesday and Friday. The hounds will be here on Tuesday, and they will be at Rufford on Friday. Rufford is only nine miles from here, and it's all settled.\\\"\\n\\nBefore the day was over the difficulty had vanished. Miss Albury's horse was not only called into requisition but Miss Albury's habit also. Ayala had a little black hat of her own, which Lady Albury assured her would do excellently well for the hunting field. There was some fitting and some trying on, and perhaps a few moments of preliminary despair; but on the Tuesday morning she rode away from the hall door at eleven o'clock mounted on Sprite, as the little horse was called, and felt herself from head to foot to be one of Colonel Stubbs's team. When at Glenbogie she had ridden a little, and again in Italy, and being fearless by nature, had no trepidation to impair the fulness of her delight. Hunting from home coverts rarely exacts much jumping from ladies. The woods are big, and the gates are numerous. It is when the far-away homes of wild foxes are drawn -- those secluded brakes and gorses where the noble animal is wont to live at a distance from carriage-roads and other weak refuges of civilisation -- that the riding capacities of ladies must be equal to those of their husbands and brothers. This present moment was an occasion for great delight -- at least, so it was found by both Nina and Ayala. But it was not an opportunity for great glory. Till it was time for lunch one fox after another ran about the big woods of Albury in a fashion that seemed perfect to the two girls, but which nearly broke the heart of old Tony, who was still huntsman to the Ufford and Rufford United Hunt. \\\"Darm their nasty ways,\\\" said Tony to Mr Larry Twentyman, who was one of the popular habitues of the hunt; \\\"they runs one a top of another's brushes, till there ain't a 'ound living knows t'other from which. There's always a many on 'em at Albury, but I never knew an Albury fox worth his grub yet.\\\" But there was galloping along roads and through gates, and long strings of horsemen followed each other up and down the rides, and an easy coming back to the places from which they started, which made the girls think that the whole thing was divine. Once or twice there was a little bank, and once or twice a little ditch -- just sufficient to make Ayala feel that no possible fence would be a difficulty to Sprite. She soon learnt that mode of governing her body which leaping requires, and when she was brought into lunch at about two she was sure that she could do anything which the art of hunting required. But at lunch an edict went forth as to the two girls, against further hunting for that day. Nina strove to rebel, and Ayala attempted to be eloquent by a supplicating glance at the Colonel. But they were told that as the horses would be wanted again on Friday they had done enough. In truth, Tony had already trotted off with the hounds to Pringle's Gorse, a distance of five miles, and the gentlemen who had lingered over their lunch had to follow him at their best pace. \\\"Pringle's Gorse is not just the place for young ladies,\\\" Sir Harry said, and so the matter had been decided against Nina and Ayala.\\n\\nAt about six Sir Harry, Colonel Stubbs, and the other gentlemen returned, declaring that nothing quicker than their run from Pringle's Gorse had ever been known in that country. \\\"About six miles straight on end in forty minutes,\\\" said the Colonel, \\\"and then a kill in the open.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He was laid up under a bank,\\\" said young Gosling.\\n\\n\\\"He was so beat that he couldn't carry on a field farther,\\\" said Captain Batsby, who was staying in the house.\\n\\n\\\"I call that the open,\\\" said Stubbs.\\n\\n\\\"I always think I kill a fox in the open\\\", said Sir Harry, \\\"when the hounds run into him, because he cannot run another yard with the country there before him.\\\" Then there was a long discussion, as they stood drinking tea before the fire, as to what \\\"the open\\\" meant, from which they went to other hunting matters. To all this Ayala listened with attentive ears, and was aware that she had spent a great day. Oh, what a difference was there between Stalham and Kingsbury Crescent!\\n\\nThe next two days were almost equally full of delight. She was taken into the stables to see her horse, and as she patted his glossy coat she felt that she loved Sprite with all her heart. Oh, what a world of joy was this -- how infinitely superior even to Queen's Gate and Glenbogie! The gaudy magnificence of the Tringles had been altogether unlike the luxurious comfort of Stalham, where everybody was at his ease, where everybody was good-natured, where everybody seemed to acknowledge that pleasure was the one object of life! On the evening before the Friday she was taken out to dinner by Captain Batsby. She was not sure that she liked Captain Batsby, who made little complimentary speeches to her. But her neighbour on the other side was Colonel Stubbs, and she was quite sure that she liked Colonel Stubbs. \\\"I know you'll go like a bird tomorrow,\\\" said Captain Batsby. \\\"I shouldn't like that, because there would be no jumping,\\\" said Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"But you'd be such a beautiful bird.\\\" The Captain, as he drawled out his words, made an eye at her, and she was sure that she did not like the Captain.\\n\\n\\\"At what time are we to start tomorrow?\\\" she said, turning to the Colonel.\\n\\n\\\"Ten, sharp. Mind you're ready. Sir Harry takes us on the drag, and wouldn't wait for Venus, though she wanted five minutes more for her back hair.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't suppose she ever wants any time for her back hair. I wouldn't if I were a goddess.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then you'd be a very untidy goddess, that's all. I wonder whether you are untidy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well -- yes -- sometimes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hate untidy girls.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thank you, Colonel Stubbs.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What I like is a nice prim little woman, who never had a pin in the wrong place in her life. Her cuffs and collars are always as stiff as steel, and she never rubs the sleeves of her dresses by leaning about, like some young ladies.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's what I do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My young woman never sits down lest she should crease her dress. My young woman never lets her ribbons get tangled. My young woman can dress upon forty pounds a year, and always look as though she came out of a band-box.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't believe you've got a young woman, Colonel Stubbs.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well; no; I haven't -- except in my imagination.\\\"\\n\\nIf so, he too must have his Angel of Light! \\\"Do     you ever dream about her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh dear, yes. I dream that she does scold so awfully when I have her to myself. In my dreams, you know, I'm married to her, and she always wants me to eat hashed mutton. Now, if there is one thing that makes me more sick than another it is hashed mutton. Of course I shall marry her in some of my waking moments, and then I shall have to eat hashed mutton for ever.\\\"\\n\\nThen Captain Batsby put in another word. \\\"I should so like to be allowed to give you a lead tomorrow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, thank you -- but I'd rather not have it,\\\" said Ayala, who was altogether in the dark, thinking that \\\"a lead\\\" might be some present which she would not wish to accept from Captain Batsby. \\\"I mean that I should like to show you a line if we get a run.\\\" \\\"What is a line?\\\" asked Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"A line? Why a line is just a lead -- keep your eye on me and I'll take the fences where you can follow without coming to grief.\\\" \\\"Oh,\\\" said Ayala, \\\"that's a lead, is it? Colonel Stubbs is going to give my friend and me a lead, as long as we stay here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No man ever ought to coach more than one lady at once,\\\" said the Captain, showing his erudition. \\\"You're sure to come on top of one another if there are two.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But Colonel Stubbs is especially told by the Marchesa to look after both of us,\\\" said Ayala almost angrily. Then she turned her shoulder to him, and was soon intent upon further instructions from the Colonel.\\n\\nThe following morning was fine, and all the ladies in the house were packed on to the top of Sir Harry's drag. The Colonel sat behind Sir Harry on the plea that he was wanted to take care of the two girls. Captain Batsby and three other gentlemen were put inside, where they consoled themselves with unlimited tobacco. In this way they were driven to a spot called Rufford Cross Roads, where they found Tony Tappett sitting perfectly quiescent on his old mare, while the hounds were seated around him on the grassy sides of the roads. With him was talking a stout, almost middle-aged gentleman, in a scarlet coat, and natty pink top boots, who was the owner of all the country around. This was Lord Rufford, who a few years since was known as one of the hardest riders in those parts; but he had degenerated into matrimony, was now the happy father of half a dozen babies, and was hardly ever seen to jump over a fence. But he still came out when the meets were not too distant, and carefully performed that first duty of an English country gentleman -- the preservation of foxes. Though he did not ride much, no one liked a little hunting gossip better than Lord Rufford. It was, however, observed that even in regard to hunting he was apt to quote the authority of his wife.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes, my Lord,\\\" said Tony, \\\"there'll sure to be a fox at Dillsborough. But we'll find one afore we get to Rufford, my Lord.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lady Rufford says there hasn't been a fox seen in the home woods this week.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Her ladyship will be sure to know,\\\" said Tony.\\n\\n\\\"Do you remember that fence where poor Major Caneback got his fall six years ago?\\\" asked the Lord.\\n\\n\\\"Seven years next Christmas, my Lord,\\\" said Tony. \\\"He never put a leg across a saddle again, poor fellow! I remember him well, my Lord; a man who could 'andle a 'orse wonderful, though he didn't know 'ow to ride to 'ounds; not according to my idea. To get your animal to carry you through, never mind 'ow long the thing is; that's my idea of riding to 'ounds, my Lord. The major was for always making a 'orse jump over everything. I never wants 'em to jump over nothing I can't help -- I don't, my Lord.\\\" \\\"That's just what her ladyship is always saying to me,\\\" said Lord Rufford, \\\"and I do pretty much what her ladyship tells me.\\\" On this occasion Lady Rufford had been quite right about the home covers. No doubt she generally was right in any assertion she made as to her husband's affairs. After drawing them Tony trotted on towards Dillsborough, running his hounds through a few little springs, which lay near his way. As they went Colonel Stubbs rode between the two girls. \\\"Whenever I see Rufford,\\\" said the Colonel, \\\"he does me a world of good.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What good can a fat man like that do you?\\\" said Nina.\\n\\n\\\"He is a continual sermon against marriage. If I could see Rufford once a week I know that I should be safe.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He seems to me to be a very comfortable old gentleman,\\\" said Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"Old! Seven years ago he was acknowledged to be the one undisputed paragon of a young man in this county. No one else dreamed of looking at a young lady if he chose to turn his eyes in that direction. He was handsome as Apollo -- \\\"\\n\\n\\\"He an Apollo!\\\" said Nina.\\n\\n\\\"The best Apollo there then was in these parts, and every one knew that he had forty thousand a year to spend. Now he is supposed to be the best hand in the house at rocking the cradle.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you mean to say that he nurses the babies?\\\" asked Ayala. \\\"He looks as if he did at any rate. He never goes ten miles away from his door without having Lady Rufford with him, and is always tucked up at night just at half past ten by her ladyship's own maid. Ten years ago he would generally have been found at midnight with cards in his hand and a cigar in his mouth. Now he is allowed two cigarettes a day. Well, Mr Twentyman, how are you getting on?\\\" This he said to a good-looking better sort of farmer, who came up, riding a remarkably strong horse, and dressed in pink and white cords.\\n\\n\\\"Thank ye, Colonel, pretty well, considering how hard the times are. A man who owns a few acres and tries to farm them must be on the road to ruin nowadays. That's what I'm always telling my wife, so that she may know what she has got to expect.\\\" Mr Twentyman had been married just twelve months.\\n\\n\\\"She isn't much frightened, I daresay,\\\" said the Colonel.\\n\\n\\\"She's young, you see,\\\" continued the farmer, \\\"and hasn't settled herself down yet to the sorrows of life.\\\" This was that Mr Lawrence Twentyman who married Kate Masters, the youngest daughter of old Masters, the attorney at Dillsborough, and sister of Mrs Morton, wife of the squire of Bragton. \\\"By the holy,\\\" said Twentyman suddenly, \\\"the hounds have put a fox out of that little spinney.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER 24 RUFFORD CROSS-ROADS\\n\\nAyala, who had been listening attentively to the conversation of Mr Twentyman, and been feeling that she was being initiated every moment into a new phase of life -- who had been endeavouring to make some connection in her mind between the new charms of the world around her and that world of her dreams that was ever present to her, and had as yet simply determined that neither could Lord Rufford or Mr Twentyman have ever been an Angel of Light -- at once straightened herself in her saddle, and prepared herself for the doing of something memorable. It was evident to her that Mr Twentyman considered that the moment for action had come. He did not gallop off wildly, as did four or five others, but stood still for a moment looking intently at a few hounds who, with their tails feathering in the air and with their noses down, seemed at the same time to be irresolute and determined, knowing that the scent was there but not yet quite fixed as to its line. \\\"Half a moment, Colonel,\\\" he said, standing up in his stirrups, with his left hand raised, while his right held his reins and his whip close down on his horse's neck. \\\"Half a moment!\\\" He only whispered, and then shook his head angrily, as he heard the ill-timed shouting of one or two men who had already reached the other side of the little skirting of trees. \\\"I wish Fred Botsey's tongue were tied to his teeth,\\\" he said, still whispering. \\\"Now, Colonel, they have it. There's a little lane to the right, and a gate. After that the country's open, and there's nothing which the ladies' nags can't do. I know the country so well, you'd perhaps better come with me for a bit.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He knows all about it,\\\" said the Colonel to Ayala. \\\"Do as he tells you.\\\"\\n\\nAyala and Nina both were quick enough to obey. Twentyman dashed along the lane, while the girls followed him with the Colonel after them. When they were at the hunting gate already spoken of, old Tony Tappett was with them, trotting, impatient to get to the hounds, courteously giving place to the ladies -- whom, however, in his heart, he wished at home in bed -- and then thrusting himself through the gate in front of the Colonel. \\\"D --  their pigheaded folly,\\\" he said, as he came up to his friend Twentyman -- \\\"they knows no more about it than if they'd just come from behind a counter -- 'olloaing, 'olloaing, 'olloaing -- as if 'olloaing'd make a fox break! 'Owsomever 'e's off now, and they've got Cranbury Brook between them and his line!\\\" This he said in a squeaking little voice, intended to be jocose and satirical, shaking his head as he rode. This last idea seemed to give him great consolation.\\n\\nIt was the consideration, deep and well-founded, as to the Cranbury which had induced Larry Twentyman to pause on the road when he had paused, and then to make for the lane and the gate. The direction had hardly seemed to be that of the hounds, but Larry knew the spinney, knew the brook -- knew the fox, perhaps -- and was aware of the spot at which the brute would cross the water if he did cross it. The brute did cross the water, and therefore there was Cranbury Brook between many of the forward riders and his line.\\n\\nSir Harry was then with them, and two or three other farmers. But Larry had a lead, and the two girls were with him. Tony Tappett, though he had got up to his hounds, did not endeavour to ride straight to them as did Larry Twentyman. He was old and unambitious, very anxious to know where his hounds were, so that he might be with them should they want the assistance of his voice and counsel, anxious to be near enough to take their fox from them should they run into him, but taking no glory in jumping over a fence if he could avoid it, creeping about here and there, knowing from experience nearly every turn in the animal's mind, aware of every impediment which would delay him, riding fast only when the impediments were far between, taking no amusement to himself out of the riding, but with his heart cruelly, bloodily, ruthlessly set upon killing the animal before him. To kill his fox he would imperil his neck, but for the glory of riding he would not soil his boots if he could help it. After the girls came the Colonel, somewhat shorn of his honour in that he was no longer giving them a lead, but doing his best to maintain the pace, which Twentyman was making very good. \\\"Now, young ladies,\\\" said Twentyman, \\\"give them their heads, and let them do it just as they please -- alongside of each other, and not too near to me.\\\" It was a brook -- a confluent of Cranbury Brook, and was wide enough to require a good deal of jumping. It may be supposed that the two young ladies did not understand much of the instructions given to them. To hold their breath and be brave was the only idea present to them. The rest must come from instinct and chance. The other side of the brook was heaven -- this would be purgatory. Larry, fearing perhaps that the order as to their not being too near might not be obeyed, added a little to his own pace so as to be clear of them. Nevertheless they were only a few strides behind, and had Larry's horse missed his footing there would have been a mess. As it was they took the brook side by side close to each other, and landed full of delight and glory on the opposite bank. \\\"Bravo! young ladies,\\\" shouted Twentyman. \\\"Oh, Nina, that is divine,\\\" said Ayala. Nina was a little too much out of breath for answering, but simply threw up her eyes to Heaven and made a flourish with her whip, intended to be expressive of her perfect joy.\\n\\nAway went Larry and away went the girls with him quite unconscious that the Colonel's horse had balked the brook and then jumped into it -- quite unconscious that Sir Harry, seeing the Colonel's catastrophe, had followed Tony a quarter of a mile up the brook to a ford. Even in the soft bosoms of young ladies \\\"the devil take the hindmost\\\" will be the motto most appropriate for hunting. Larry Twentyman, of whom they had never heard before, was now the god of their idolatry. Where Larry Twentyman might go it was manifestly their duty to follow, even though they should never see the poor Colonel again. They recked nothing of the fox or of the hounds or of the master or even of the huntsman. They had a man before them to show them the way, and as long as they could keep him in sight each was determined to be at any rate as good as the other. To give Larry his due it must be acknowledged that he was thoroughly thoughtful of them. At every fence encountered he studied the spot at which they would be least likely to fall. He had to remember, also, that there were two of them together, and that he had made himself in a way responsible for the safety of both. All this he did, and did well, because he knew his business. With the exception of the waterjump, the country over which they passed was not difficult. For a time there was a run of gates, each of which their guide was able to open for them, and as they came near to Dillsborough Wood there were gaps in most of the fences; but it seemed to the girls that they had galloped over monstrous hedges and leapt over walls which it would almost take a strong man to climb. The brook, however -- the river as it seemed to them -- had been the crowning glory. Ayala was sure that that brook would never be forgotten by her. Even the Angel of Light was hardly more heavenly than the brook.\\n\\nThat the fox was running for Dillsborough Wood was a fact well known both to Tony Tappett and Mr Larry Twentyman. A fox crossing the brook from the Rufford side would be sure to run to Dillsborough Wood. When Larry, with the two girls, were just about to enter the ride, there was old Tony standing up on his horse at the corner, looking into the covert. And now also a crowd of horsemen came rushing up, who had made their way along the road,and had passed up to the wood through Mr Twentyman's farmyard,; for, as it happened, here it was that Mr Twentyman lived and farmed his own land. Then came Sir Harry, Colonel Stubbs, and some others who had followed the line throughout -- the Colonel with his boots full of water, as he had been forced to get off his horse in the bed of the brook. Sir Harry, himself, was not in the best of humours -- as will sometimes be the case with masters when they fail to see the cream of a run. \\\"I never saw such riding in my life,\\\" said Sir Harry, as though some great sin had been committed by those to whom he was addressing himself. Larry turned round, and winked at the two girls, knowing that, if sin had been committed, they three were the sinners. The girls understood nothing about it, but still thought that Larry Twentyman was divine.\\n\\nWhile they were standing about on the rides, Tony was still at his work. The riding was over, but the fox had to be killed, and Dillsborough Wood was a covert in which a fox will often require a large amount of killing. No happier home for the vulpine deity exists among the shires of England! There are earths there deep, capacious, full of nurseries; but these, on the present occasion, were debarred from the poor stranger by the wicked ingenuity of man. But there were deep dells, in which the brambles and bracken were so thick that no hound careful of his snout would penetrate them. The undergrowth of the wood was so interwoven that no huntsman could see through its depths. There were dark nooks so impervious that any fox ignorant of the theory of his own scent must have wondered why a hound should have been induced to creep into spaces so narrow. From one side to another of the wood the hunted brute would traverse, and always seem to have at last succeeded in putting his persecutors at fault. So it was on this occasion. The run, while it lasted, had occupied, perhaps, three-quarters of an hour, and during a time equally long poor old Tony was to be seen scurrying from one side of the wood to another, and was to be heard loudly swearing at his attendant whips because the hounds did not follow his footsteps as quickly as his soul desired.\\n\\n\\\"I never mean to put on a pair of top-boots again, as long as I live,\\\" said the Colonel. At this time a little knot of horsemen was stationed in a knoll in the centre of the wood, waiting till they should hear the fatal whoop. Among them were Nina, Ayala, the Colonel, Larry Twentyman, and Captain Batsby.\\n\\n\\\"Give up top-boots?\\\" said Larry. \\\"You don't mean to say you'll ride in black!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Top-boots, black boots, spurs, breeches, and red coat, I renounce them all from this moment. If ever I'm seen in a hunting field again it will be in a pair of trousers with overalls.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Now, you're joking, Colonel,\\\" said Larry.\\n\\n\\\"Why won't you wear a red coat any more?\\\" said Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"Because I'm disgraced for ever. I came out to coach two young women, and give them a lead, and all I've done was to tumble into a brook, while a better man has taken my charge away from me.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1639990953,\"title\":\"\\nMr Dosett was dignified at his office with the use of a room to himself, a small room looking out upon the river\"},\"digest\":\"cb0BQeJzRZ2aVaabnG6wLfyYPYs2hQHidNl5mG2KIkk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6e15513EBD81b8159946378511dF1E78276e74F2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PCVV8XY9cUKbyfW2qCOzx3erw5hWnl-057zNMQn0NxY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"m7ue15iKLkWX1ag--nkWe6OQUdXMhIySOoGexLRd2X4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"rk8gYU3_i93T0e3KCxTRhRHhEHAqjgDDqlaY3vhRknaTsxmaB95d0W5IaMUM-8GgMGd8qw3Wopxi1FTUxWGC_Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xadb32d4131c80798b3f228d982c000d96453a2d347bf06745cefc46907cf8dcb660509f10f613b4e073b0abeb1c84a70b4c4223290b680e0812f3633e71666811b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PCVV8XY9cUKbyfW2qCOzx3erw5hWnl-057zNMQn0NxY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"m7ue15iKLkWX1ag--nkWe6OQUdXMhIySOoGexLRd2X4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"cb0BQeJzRZ2aVaabnG6wLfyYPYs2hQHidNl5mG2KIkk\"}"
