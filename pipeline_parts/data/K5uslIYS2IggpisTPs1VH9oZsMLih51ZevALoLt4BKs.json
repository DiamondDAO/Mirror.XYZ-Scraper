"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"feeling that held him inactive, the feeling that it was not for him to approach Hermione--that others might draw near to her, but that he dared not. The sensation distressed and almost humiliated him. it came upon him like a punishment for sin, and as a man accepts a punishment which he is conscious of deserving Artois accepted it.\\n\\nSo now he waited alone on the crest of the island, looking towards the Casa del Mare.\\n\\nWhat would be the result of this strange and daring embassy?\\n\\nHe was not long to be in doubt.\\n\\n\\\"Signore! Signore!\\\"\\n\\nGaspare's voice was calling him from somewhere in the darkness.\\n\\n\\\"Signore.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am coming.\\\"\\n\\nThere had been a thrill of emotion in the appeal sent out to him. He hurried towards the house. He crossed the bridge. When he was on it he heard the splash of oars below him in the Pool, but he took no heed of it. What were the fishermen to him to-night? Before the house door he met Gaspare and Ruffo.\\n\\n\\\"What is it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Signora is not in her room, Signore.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not--? How do you know? Is the door open?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signore. The Signora has gone! And the /fattura della morte/ has gone.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The /fattura della morte/ has gone!\\\" repeated Ruffo.\\n\\nThe repetition of the words struck a chill to the heart of Artois. Again he was beset by superstition. He caught it from these children of the South, who stared at him now with their grave and cloudy eyes.\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps one of the servants--\\\" he began.\\n\\n\\\"No, Signore. I have asked them. And they would not dare to touch it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Signorina?\\\"\\n\\nHe shook his head.\\n\\n\\\"She is in the garden. She has been there all the time. She does not know\\\"--he lowered his voice almost to a whisper--\\\"she does not know about the Signora and the /fattura della morte/.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We must not let her know--\\\"\\n\\nHe stopped. Suddenly his ears seemed full of the sound of splashing oars in water. Yet he heard nothing.\\n\\n\\\"Gaspare,\\\" he said quickly, \\\"have you looked everywhere for the Signora?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have looked in the house, Signore. I have been on the terrace and to the Signorina in the garden. Then I came to tell you. I thought you should know about the Signora and the /fattura della morte/.\\\"\\n\\nArtois felt that it was this fact of the disappearance of the death- charm which for the moment paralyzed Gaspare's activities. What stirring of ancient superstition was in the Sicilian's heart he did not know, but he knew that now his own time of action was come. No longer could he delegate to others the necessary deed. And with this knowledge his nature seemed to change. An ardor that was almost vehement with youth, and that was hard-fibred with manly strength and resolution, woke up in him.\\n\\nAgain his ears were full of the sound of oars in water.\\n\\n\\\"Ruffo,\\\" he said, \\\"will you obey me?\\\"\\n\\nHe laid his hand on the boy's shoulder.\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signore.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Go into the garden. Stay with the Signorina till I come.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signore.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If it is a long time, if the Signorina is afraid, if she wants to do anything, you are to say that Don Emilio said she was not to be afraid, and that she was to wait.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signore.\\\"\\n\\nThe boy paused, looking steadily at Artois, then, seeing that he had finished, turned away and went softly into the house.\\n\\n\\\"Gaspare, come with me.\\\"\\n\\nGaspare said nothing, but followed him down to the foot of the cliff. One of the island boats was gone. When Gaspare saw that he ran to pull in the other. He held out his arm to help Artois into the boat, then took the oars, standing up and looking before him into the night.\\n\\n\\\"Row towards the village, Gaspare.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signore.\\\"\\n\\nAt that moment Gaspare understood much of what was in Artois's mind. He relied upon Artois. He trusted him--and this fact, of Gaspare's trust and reliance upon him, added now to that feeling of ardor that had risen up in Artois, gave him courage, helped to banish completely that punishing sensation which had condemned him to keep away from Hermione as one unworthy to approach her, to touch even the hem of her grief.\\n\\nNo need to tell Gaspare to row quickly. With all his strength he forced the boat along through the calm sea.\\n\\n\\\"Keep near the shore, Gaspare!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signore.\\\"\\n\\nOnly the first quarter of the young moon was visible in the sky. It cast but a thin and distant glint of silver upon the waters. By the near shore the dimness of this hour was unbroken by any light, unstirred by any sound except the withdrawn and surreptitious murmur of the sea. The humped shapes of the low yellow rocks showed themselves faintly like shapes of beasts asleep. In the distance, lifted above the sea, two or three flames shone faintly. They were shed by lamps or candles set in the windows of the fishermen's cottages in the village.\\n\\nHad Hermione gone to the village?\\n\\nShe might have left the island with some definite purpose, or moved by a blind impulse to get away, and be alone. Artois could not tell. But she had taken the /fattura della morte/.\\n\\nHe wondered whether she knew its meaning, with what sinister intention it had been made. Something in the little worthless thing must have attracted her, have fascinated her, or she would not have taken it. In her distress of mind, in her desire for solitude, she would have hastened away and left it lying where it was.\\n\\nPerhaps she had a purpose in leaving the island with the /fattura della morte/.\\n\\nHer taking of it began to seem to Artois, as it had evidently seemed to Gaspare, a fact of profound significance. His imagination, working with an almost diseased rapidity and excitement, brought before him a series of scenes in which the death-charm figured as symbol. In one of these there were two women--Hermione and Maddalena.\\n\\nHermione might have set out on some wild quest to Mergellina. He remembered the face at the window, and knew that to-night everything was possible.\\n\\n\\\"Row quickly, Gaspare!\\\"\\n\\nGaspare bent almost furiously to the oars. Then sharply he turned his head.\\n\\n\\\"What is it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can see the boat! I can see the Signora!\\\"\\n\\nThe words struggled out on a long breath that made his broad chest heave. Instinctively Artois put his hands on the gunwale of the boat on either side of him, moving as if to stand up.\\n\\n\\\"Take care, Signore!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'd forgotten--\\\" He leaned forward, searching the night. \\\"Where is the Signora?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There--in front! She is rowing to the village. No, she has turned.\\\"\\n\\nHe stopped rowing.\\n\\n\\\"The Signora has seen, or she has heard, and she is going in to shore.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But there are only the rocks.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Signora is going in to the Palazzo of the Spirits.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Palazzo of the Spirits?\\\" Artois repeated.\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signore.\\\"\\n\\nGaspare turned and looked again into the darkness.\\n\\n\\\"I cannot see the Signora any more.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Follow the Signora, Gaspare. If she has gone to the Palazzo of the Spirits row in there.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signore.\\\"\\n\\nHe drew the oars again strongly through the water.\\n\\nArtois remembered a blinding storm that had crashed over a mountain village in Sicily long ago, a flash of lightning which had revealed to him the gaunt portal of a palace that seemed abandoned, a strip of black cloth, the words \\\"/Lutto in famiglia/.\\\" They had seemed to him prophetic words.\\n\\nAnd now--?\\n\\nIn the darkness he saw another darkness, the strange and broken outline of the ruined palace by the sea, once perhaps, the summer home of some wealthy Roman, now a mere shell visited in the lonely hours by the insatiate waves. Were Hermione and he to meet here? To-day he had thought of his friend as a spirit that had been long in prison. Now he came to the Palace of the Spirits to face her truth with his. The Palace of the Spirits! The name suggested the very nakedness of truth. Well, let it be so, let the truth stand there naked. Again, mingling with a certain awe, there rose up in him a strong ardor, a courage that was vehement, that longed at last to act. And it seemed to him suddenly that for many years, through all the years that divided Hermione and him from the Sicilian life, they had been held in leash, waiting for the moment of this encounter. Now the leash slackened. They were being freed. And for what?\\n\\nGaspare plunged his right oar into the sea alone. The boat swung round obediently, heading for the shore.\\n\\nOne of the faint lights that gleamed in the village was extinguished.\\n\\n\\\"Signore, the Signora has left the boat!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Madonna! She has let it go! She has left it to the sea!\\\"\\n\\nHe backed water. A moment later the little boat in which Vere loved to go out alone grated against theirs.\\n\\n\\\"Madonna! To leave the boat like that!\\\" exclaimed Gaspare, bending to catch the tow-rope. \\\"The Signora is not safe to-night. The Signora's saint will not look on her to-night.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Put me ashore, Gaspare.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signore.\\\"\\n\\nThe boat passed before the fa?ade of the palace.\\n\\nArtois knew the palace well by day. This was the first time he had come to it by night. In daylight it was a small and picturesque ruin washed by the laughing sea, lonely but scarcely sad. Leaping from its dark and crumbling walls the fisher-boys often plunged into the depths below; or they lay upon the broad sills of the gaping window-spaces to dry themselves in the sun. Men came with rods and lines to fish from its deserted apartments, through which, when rough weather was at hand, the screaming sea-birds flew. The waves played frivolously enough in its recesses. And their voices were heard against the slimy and defiant stones calling to teach other merrily, as perhaps once the voices of revellers long dead called in the happy hours of a vanished villeggiatura.\\n\\nBut the night wrought on it, in it, and about it change. Its solitude then became desolation, the darkness of its stones a blackness that was tragic, its ruin more than a suggestion, the decisive picture of despair.\\n\\nAt its base was a line of half-discovered window-spaces, the lower parts of which had become long since the prey of the waves. Above it were more window-spaces, fully visible, and flanking a high doorway, once, no doubt, connected with a staircase, but now giving upon mid- air. Formerly there had been another floor, but this had fallen into decay and disappeared, with the exception of one small and narrow chamber situated immediately over the doorway. Isolated, for there was no means of approach to it, this chamber had something of the aspect of a low and sombre tower sluggishly lifting itself towards the sky. The palace was set upon rock and flanked by rocks. Round about it grass grew to the base of a high cliff at perhaps two hundred yards distance from it. And here and there grass and tufts of rank herbage pushed in its crevices, proclaiming the triumph of time to exulting winds and waters.\\n\\nAs Gaspare rowed in cautiously and gently to this deserted place, to which from the land no road, no footpath led, he stared at the darkness of the palace with superstitious awe, then at the small, familiar boat, which followed in their wake because he held the tow- rope.\\n\\n\\\"Signore,\\\" he said, \\\"I am afraid!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You--Gaspare!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am afraid for the Signora. Why should she come here all alone with the /fattura della morte/? I am afraid for the Signora.\\\"\\n\\nThe boat touched the edge of the rock to the right of the palace.\\n\\n\\\"And where has the Signora gone, Signore? I cannot see her, and I cannot hear her.\\\"\\n\\nHe lifted up his hand. They listened. But they heard only the sucking murmur of the sea against the rocks perforated with little holes, and in distant, abandoned chambers of the palace.\\n\\n\\\"Where has the Signora gone?\\\" Gaspare repeated, in a whisper.\\n\\n\\\"I will find the Signora,\\\" said Artois.\\n\\nHe got up. Gaspare held his arm to assist him to the shore.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1637315601,\"title\":\"\\nArtois did not go with them.
