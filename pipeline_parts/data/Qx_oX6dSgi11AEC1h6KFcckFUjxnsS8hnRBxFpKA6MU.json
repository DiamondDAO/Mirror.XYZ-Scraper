"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## If you had to make money by gambling, what game would you choose to play?\\n\\nI’ve been spending a bit of time thinking about this question recently, after a coin flip “double or nothing” crypto game garnered some traction and made its way across my twitter feed. How can you impose a framework to determine your best odds of making money in games where the odds are stacked against you? Is a table game with a skill component most beneficial? Would you be best served by trying your luck with a 50/50 coin flip, or something in-between? This [coin flip game](https://degencoinflip.com) remained on my mind for the past week, as there are now thousands of people playing, **yet the expected value of each bet made in this game is lower than the worst games in Vegas** (or any casino for that matter).\\n\\nThis made me ask myself, why are people playing this game? I believe the answer is two-part:\\n\\n1. The existing crypto-native gambling sites are **bad.**\\n2. People don’t understand the math behind many gambling games.\\n\\nAs we wrap up 2021, the US gambling market is estimated to collect [$262 Billion in revenue](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-gambling-market-to-reach-876-billion-by-2026-301305923.html) - with forward looking annual growth rates north of 4% (the Online segment of the market has an annual compound growth rate greater than 17%). Outside of the U.S. there is little data to accurately estimate the market size (especially in online gambling), however suffice to say the total market globally is **at least 2-3x** the size of the U.S.\\n\\n## In such a big market, why are existing solutions bad?\\n\\nIn my opinion, physical gambling actually does a good job servicing user needs. As traditional gambling migrated online, there was little innovation in how gambling can (and should) work. This is especially prevalent in the crypto space, with each new online casino somehow [looking more](https://www.bitstarz.com/) like a [copy-paste](https://7bitcasino.com/) than the [last](https://www.mbitcasino.com/). \\n\\n![An example of the homepage on www.bitstarz.com.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LCaBhndy3CkoOhEqwEuoS.png?height=653&width=1471)\\n\\nThe most striking thing about this is that **across “different” online casino’s there are** **mostly the same games.** Most major online casino’s utilize software from one of the [several](https://www.softgamings.com/igaming-solutions-and-platforms/bitcoin-casino/) [turnkey](https://www.softswiss.com/knowledge-base/bitcoin-casino-software/) [crypto](https://2wpower.com/en/bitcoin-casino-software) [casino](https://www.bestbitcoincasino.com/software/playtech/) [software](https://www.softswiss.com/crypto-casino-solution/) [providers](https://www.gammastack.com/crypto-online-casino-software-development/). The problem with this is that every existing crypto-native casino has tried to do the same thing: “create a traditional casino, but with bitcoin”. They are completely missing the opportunity to apply blockchain technology to marry decentralization and trustless validation with online gambling.\\n\\n## What could applying blockchain to a casino mean?\\n\\nFor starters, it would mean you would know the exact odds of each game, enabling **guaranteed fairness**. That uncomfortable feeling that you’re potentially getting ripped off when online gambling vanishes. Currently this is accomplished by casinos going through a registration process, part of which requires an audit to ensure relative fairness in their games. This transparency aside, the most exciting application is that blockchain enables distribution of casino profits amongst decentralized owner/users of the casino. To understand how this would work, it’s important to understand the two primary ways casino’s make money. In a game that is not against the house (think a table game like poker) there is a certain amount of every pot that gets “raked” by the casino (typically this is anywhere from 2.5%-10% of the pot). The second way casinos make money is through games with a negative expected value. Simply put this means that if you play the game for an infinitely long period of time, courtesy of the law of large numbers, you will end up with $0. This is accomplished with a bit of mathematical engineering to construct a game where your $1 bet will return $0.80-$0.99 on average.\\n\\n## Finally, on to the sexiest part of gambling… The Math.\\n\\nTo illustrate a simple example of a slot machine you might see in Vegas: if you have a slot machine with three reels, you take the sum of the number of potential outcomes on each reel, and multiply them together.\\n\\n![A stock three reel slot machine.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DEBNnjrfZFEbHJu61bHLt.jpg?height=360&width=640)\\n\\nTo illustrate an example, if a three reel slot machine’s first reel has four possible outcomes, the second has five possible outcomes, and the third has three possible outcomes you would have (4 x 5 x 3) = 60 total possible combinations. The casino will then decide which combinations will pay out money to the player, and adds the total value of those payouts together. For example, if we return 1x the player’s bet for 8 different combinations (1 x 8/60), 3x the bet for 1 combination *(3* x 1/60), 17.5x the bet for 1 combination (17.5 x 1/60), and 30x the bet for 1 combination (30 x 1/60) our game would have a (1 x 8/60) + (3 x 1/60) + (15 x 1/60) + (30 x 1/60) = 97.50% payout percentage. On average, we would expect a $1 bet to yield a $0.975 return.\\n\\n## So what game should I play if I needed to make money?\\n\\nBack to our original question. The obvious answer you probably already knew (which isn’t financial advice, but I mean c’mon it probably should be): you lose money in the long run gambling in any non-skill based capacity. The subsequent answer is also not financial advice, but speaking academically the correct answer is a table stakes game (poker or blackjack) as it is possible to have a statistical edge when played correctly. If you are constrained to online gambling with no skill prerequisite, the uninitiated may think that our previous example of a double or nothing coin flip provides a better expected return with an expected payout of (1/2 x 0) + (1/2 x 2) = 1.00 (on a $1 bet).\\n\\n**However:** when we look under the hood, the lovely team at “Degen Coin Flip” has a 3.5% rake on every win, meaning that expected value of that coin flip is actually (1/2 x 0) + (1/2 x 2) - 0.035 = 0.965… **The moral of this story is, maybe you’re better off just playing the slots.**\",\"timestamp\":1640308262,\"title\":\"Crypto Casinos and The \\\"Surprising\\\" Math Behind Gambling\"},\"digest\":\"0PKffo2H8KBWSSKT7okVaaKpXgVGvReY0xRmBsuYRYk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xaea01704d80288FA97B0de0bc0758d5D2B0b81E1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"htRwUAf8C92SQFrqDSAk4tiBFLJWLxB9RYe9c5cH0Og\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zj7DgXS6-8qVvTZ0PrjFPFlMpHIcefRnAeShoa1odxo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"2uMgKnjA9Z_p4eokKScst-CuaWxaU4QrVKpe1_Ffn-eOemciYUL7XUyEpJgyk69skLyAVyNpe-m2boq18TwGUg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x7c58b64c3240bf2788f064b921500d4dd2db3010796102315b2525e8a88fbf315a69948aab763ff468a5c75affe69ab240b65f135ef6fed8cbfa74c5ca7fc8841b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"htRwUAf8C92SQFrqDSAk4tiBFLJWLxB9RYe9c5cH0Og\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zj7DgXS6-8qVvTZ0PrjFPFlMpHIcefRnAeShoa1odxo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"077H0upGKziCjAWQO9Xj9fx0X82gKNkH-NKrMFbRzFM\"}"
