"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Hey hey ya‚Äôll üëã**\\n\\nQuite excited to have landed here! over past \\\\~3 years I have been developing a project I hope can provide value to the maker space. Currently operating on $USD, I‚Äôm interested in the opportunity to transition to a decentralized ecosystem and build my first web3 application!\\n\\n**The Idea üß†**\\n\\nA few close friends and I have started building a community over at [Oneaday.io]() with the hopes of creating a sustainable space for artists, designers, makers, and collectors to share and support work, **sustainably**.\\n\\n![One A Day Environment](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XttzZh395GxsZpl4v7-xF.png?height=747&width=1440)\\n\\nThe platform currently operates on $USD, with a monthly subscription required to post & ‚Äúlike‚Äù (show support) to the creator. When ‚Äúliking‚Äù a post you instantly donate half of your daily subscription cost to the content creator.\\n\\nThe platform imposes a limit on digital releases and consumption, restricted by time. These simple set of restrictions are meant to encourage both the creation & supporting of work, in an environment that puts value back in ‚Äúauthenticity‚Äù.\\n\\n**The Future** ü§ñ\\n\\nAs I started researching opportunities to transition from an USD/centralized platform to Blockchain/NFT(s), I was lucky enough to chat through the current state of the space with [damjanski](), who recommended [this podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2L177EyYdrB3bBy3BSUEXL?si=8024e0c03a9f4bf3), featuring both Graeme of [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) & Elpizo Choi of [Foundation](https://foundation.app/). Both talking about their technology focusing in on split contracts.\\n\\nAfter many ‚Äúah ha!‚Äù moments through the discussion, I have landed here in the hopes of leveraging Mirror to facilitate split contracts between creators & supporters on One A Day, transitioning to a decentralized ecosystem!\\n\\n**About Me ü§ì**\\n\\nMy name is [Laith Azzam](https://laith.wtf/), and I‚Äôm a product thinking designer & developer, with a ‚ù§Ô∏è for building usable experiences. I live my days focusing on creating ecosystems and environments that facilitate ‚Äúgood‚Äù, while allowing artists, creators, and makers the opportunity to launch products expressing individual ideas & passions.\\n\\nI have experience in both startup and enterprise environments, with an understanding of the role both scales can play throughout our existence. I‚Äôve developed software solutions for a variety of industries; Education, entertainment, fintech, healthcare, as well as politics - providing relief for under represented organizations and human rights movements during trying times.\\n\\nI‚Äôve been trained in the Arts, receiving a BFA from The Academy of Art University in San Francisco with a focus on Web Design & New Media. I‚Äôve been grinding my teeth on code for as long as I can remember, creating automation and experiences for gaming, video production, and music as life-long hobbies and passion projects.\\n\\nI am currently working full-time [@YML](https://yml.co/) with an insanely skilled group of individuals, recently putting brain power internally into ideas to leverage NFTs and create ecosystems that ultimately play a beneficial role in modern society üôè\\n\\n**Get In Touch üí¨**\\n\\nWhile I am excited by the idea, I have zero experience executing on web3 / blockchain technologies. I‚Äôm very interested in getting in touch with other makers who see value in this community, and would like to talk through all aspects of the space - both theoretical ideas for the future as well as getting our hands dirty bringing platforms to life! ü§ó\\n\\n**All the best,**\\n\\\\-Laith (JankyBoss#6774)\",\"timestamp\":1636352830,\"title\":\"OAD.Day.1\"},\"digest\":\"WmymVt1Nhw9vI9MJyLZxIeUe_NG0av2m6Syz6BEnl6g\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6DC1841c7C3ac3E8f37FE578FA7a77351F9BdE29\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"r_aM6L9RNMWc0NwKf7gsObU1izxJj3Yd-QMetzzhkmk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Y5mf0mutkmFNIMhtAp68FlTKuILdUKMNcTL54kE8VRU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"H_xYcqvocfXIbQPIwctpUNG3yVJa7P3GzdeoyFiiGE1xx7CDQjqtS7srHqNaon0zsSt6E-HDdbjzo-Lq4HXBqA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8bb7d6053e74f1e10856b80ecfdde686878154f982e5e139e220b43c0141ecc03621f6ea304250533265c0808f4d6e27b11c9241d71b92862e421bcbb9c702e61c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"r_aM6L9RNMWc0NwKf7gsObU1izxJj3Yd-QMetzzhkmk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Y5mf0mutkmFNIMhtAp68FlTKuILdUKMNcTL54kE8VRU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"DBE_YDLxNhUZG5t0UZ2g8g4kisiUMFDmwmdj2UuueFg\"}"
