"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*NOTE: Original piece published on 20 Nov 2021 by myself in Chinese, this is the English version to demonstrate my analytic skills and language skills.*\\n\\n[https://tonysays.substack.com/p/klimadao](https://tonysays.substack.com/p/klimadao)\\n\\n## Intro\\n\\nIn the past month, you may have heard of OlympusDAO (OHM), and if you follow OHM, you may have also heard of KlimaDAO. A protocol established in June this year utilising the same (3,3) mechanism as OHM, accumulating Base Carbon Tonnes (BCT) through bonding and staking. There are many article detailing OHM’s innovative Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) mechanism so I won’t be discussing that in this piece, rather I assume you have a basic understand of it.\\n\\nI’d like to talk about carbon offset trading and the carbon market, and the most important question I have regarding KilmaDAO - whether it collateralized backing asst  Base Carbon Tone (BCT) has any value accruing.\\n\\n## Carbon Market\\n\\nOne must understand the carbon market to understand BCT, as this is the market that would determine its intrinsic value via buy and sell.\\n\\nCarbon trading is simply the trading of carbon emission in terms of CO2/tonne as a commodity via the carbon market, which can be categorized into two: the Compliance Carbon Market and the Voluntary Carbon Market.\\n\\nThe **Compliance Carbon Market (CCM)** is established based on Kyoto Protocol back in 1997, aimed at limiting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from industrialized countries to curb Global Warming. In 2005, Kyoto Protocol came into effect which makes the first time in our history to limit GHG via legislation and regulation by either reducing carbon emission or carbon offsets. The goal is to halve carbon emission in major industrial countries by more than 80% by 2050. Under the agreement, each participating country will meet this goal by setting emission reduction targets and tracking annual carbon emission.\\n\\nDeveloping countries like China and India are not mandated to participate the Kyoto Protocol due their relatively small carbon emission during the industrial era (1881 - 1935). Due to strategic deployment, China adopted *[Measures for the Administration of Carbon Emissions Trading (Trial Implementation)](http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/zhengceku/2021-01/06/content_5577360.htm)*[ Memorandum](http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/zhengceku/2021-01/06/content_5577360.htm) in December 2020 to ensure compliance with global sentiments. The memorandum allows state departments to allocate carbon credits to Key Emitting Entities (26,000 tons of carbon emissions per year and above), while permitting and encouraging these carbon credits to be traded in the carbon emission trading platform. The basic idea is that if an Key Emitting Entity exceeds its annual carbon emission quota (carbon credit), additional carbon credits will have to be purchased from others with unused carbon credit, and compensate for its over-emissions.\\n\\n![CCM Illustration](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DRmjVz4_d_C9yXtmno683.png?height=2290&width=4070)\\n\\nThe largest carbon emitter United State among developed industrial countries, refused the sign the Kyoto Protocol in 2001 under the Bush administration. And to date, carbon emission control and trading rely only on individual states legislation and policies. e.g. the [Carbon Emissions Regulatory Program](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/compliance-offset-program) led by the California government in 2013 and the Regional Carbon Emissions Initiative launched by eleven northeastern states in 2005, other states have not passed legislation to encourage carbon trading markets.\\n\\n![CCM in USA only in highlighted states](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Mf-2GISNS5AoXhnkXO-_v.png?height=394&width=789)\\n\\nIn general, regulated Compliance Carbon Market lacks coherence and couldn’t establish deep roots in any counties due to the fact that, most countries have not signed up to Kyoto Protocol and are still weighting in positions.\\n\\nThe **Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM)** on the other hand, is a market in which companies, individuals and organizations that are not bound by Kyoto Protocol, voluntarily purchase carbon emission offset to offset/ reduce their carbon footprint, in order to mitigate the global warming own up to its social responsibilities. The following conversation will be mostly concerning this market.\\n\\n![VCM Illustration](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tdz1zlFG6F_P_j4voGAND.png?height=2262&width=3630)\\n\\nAs of August 2021, VCM total trading volume exceed $785M in 2021 (circa. 239 million tons of CO2) with a historical total of $6.7B. [According to McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/a-blueprint-for-scaling-voluntary-carbon-markets-to-meet-the-climate-challenge#:\\\\~:text=annual%20global%20demand%20for%20carbon%20credits%20could%20reach%20up%20to%201.5%20to%202.0%20gigatons%20of%20carbon%20dioxide%20(gtco2)%20by%202030%20and%20up%20to%207%20to%2013%20gtco2%20by%202050%20(exhibit%202).%20), demand for carbon offsets is expected to reach 1.5-2 gigatons in 2030 and soar to 7-13 gigatons by 2030, roughly doubling demand every 10 years; and due to various constraints, carbon offset production is expected to fall short of purchases in the medium term, in another word demand will outstripe supply.\\n\\n![VCM Market Size](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/raaJ-ctydlZyXeH8fQ-YI.png?height=496&width=996)\\n\\n**Main participants in the VCM are:**\\n\\n1. Project developers - Represent upstream participants who invest capital to build emission reduction projects that generates carbon offsets. These projects need to be certified via recognized voluntary emission reduction standards, such as Verra's Verified Carbon Standard, to calculate the intended tonnage of carbon emission reducts and be certified for sale.\\n2. Downstream buyers - These are mainly the private companies mentioned earlier, who have the willingness and financial resources to purchase carbon offsets to meet the company's carbon neutral plan, to fulfill their social responsibility and to be accountable to investors and regulators.\\n3. Wholesalers and intermediaries - Each represents a different set of market participants. Wholesalers buy and package large quantities of carbon emissions and sell them to downstream sellers or intermediaries for a profit, while intermediaries sell them at a markup by distributing them to retail buyers.\\n\\nIt’s worth noting that sale price per ton is not the same for every carbon reduction projects, they can be further categorized and prices based on country of origin, type of projects, certification standard, and certification time. As you can see from the chart below, the price of carbon offsets are not equal across continents, this is a unique aspect of carbon ffset pricing.\\n\\n![Average price of carbon offset](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6YdnwN84SwjYn3cWHJ3UB.png?height=426&width=876)\\n\\n**There are generally three types of carbon reduction project:**\\n\\n1. **Emission Avoidance Projects** - aimed at avoiding carbon dioxide emissions altogether. This includes project that most of us are familiar with: Wind, hydro and solar power projects, as well as carbon reductions from conservation projects such as Reduced Deforestation and Prevention of Forest Degradation (REDD+) under the [UN REDD+ framework](https://www.fao.org/redd/zh/). For example, Verra-certified forest conservation projects are certified under this mechanism, which calculates the amount of carbon emissions that can be absorbed by an area of forest, if left unlogged and retained as is, to certify the projected carbon reductions/ offsets.\\n2. **Emission Reduction Projects -** where it’s not possible to completely avoid carbon emissions, take measurements to reduce energy consumption to achieve emission reduction. An example of this is [The Cookstove Project](https://cookstoveproject.org/). In today’s world, underdeveloped communities still rely on cutting down trees to collect firewood to fulfil basic need i.e. boiling water and cooking. The Cookstove Project come to these communities and build free cookstoves to improve the efficiency of firewood burning, thus reducing the amount of firewood consumed for cooking, and reducing the quantity and cycle of logging, thereby reducing emissions.\\n3. **Emission Removal Projects** - including reforestation and afforestation, and [carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS)](https://www.iea.org/fuels-and-technologies/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage), directly remove CO2 from the atmosphere.These high-tech projects require large start-up and operating capital and long payback periods, so they are mostly large-scale government led projects.\\n\\n## Verra Verification Standards\\n\\nAs one of the certification standards for the Voluntary Carbon Market, Verra is a US based non-for-profit organization that developed the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), a certification standard to approve and certify greenhouse gas emission reduction project. Proposed GHG reduction project needs to complete the follower steps to obtain certificated VCUs (Verra Carbon Units). Note at this stage, VCUs is the only asset which can be used to mint BCTs.\\n\\n![The VCS Project Cycle: Step by Step](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hRquDNWNKSckXTN7wNQVN.png?height=188&width=775)\\n\\nNow we have roughly covered how the current carbon market works. We can expect that VCM will only grow bigger in terms of demand and trade; carbon reduction has to go though Verra or other certification standards to obtain certified carbon emission reduction ( Carbon Offset), which then can be bought by individuals, companies and organizations in need of such offsets. Carbon offsets can be awarded from three types of projects (avoidance, reduction and removal), and other informations such as countries of origin and year of certification etc will have an impact on the price of carbon offsets. These information is critical to help understanding and analysing BCT/ KlimaDAO.\\n\\n## The Origin of KlimaDAO\\n\\nIf we understands that the backing asset behind OlympusDAO ([OHM](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/olympus)) is DAI, the same minting mechanism also applies to KilmaDAO,  new KilmaDAO ([KLIMA](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/klima-dao)) mint would be backed by Base Carbon Tonne (BCT), a unit based on carbon emission reduction tonnage. Every KilmaDAO ([KLIMA](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/klima-dao)) will and must be backed by a BCT, this is the fundamental logic behind its intrinsic value.\\n\\nBCT is made up of TCO2 tokens ( ERC-721 token) that was minted via uploading Verra VCUs to [Toucan Protoco](https://toucan.earth/)l on Polygon, the [TCO2 token](https://docs.toucan.earth/protocol/bridge/tco2-toucan-carbon-tokens) is then further fractionalised and deposited into Toucan’s Carbon Pool that holds a basket of different TCO2 tokens. (If we recall that every VCUs are priced differently, so is TCO2 as they merely represent the VCUs on-chain via Toucan. ) Toucan’s Carbon Pool will mix all TCO2s deposited and minted a fungible ERC-20 token called Base Carbon Tonne ([BCT](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/toucan-protocol-base-carbon-tonne)).\\n\\nTo understand what KilmaDAO aim to achieve, we can read below abstract from KlimaDAO [official Medium page](https://klimadao.medium.com/klima-dao-as-a-liquidity-engine-3a806ce5d3d5):\\n\\n![KlimaDAO Mission Statement](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zVdTiHK8tQfkvU8oq107z.png?height=276&width=697)\\n\\nThis is quite a radical but refreshing idea. It reminds of of the book *Homo Dues* *by Yuval Noah Harari,* Yuval mentioned that the limitation of tribal thinking makes it difficult for humans to think and make sense of the issues facing all of us, one of such issue is global warming and its profound impact to our future. There has also been a recent proposal on MakerDAO forum on the same topic, the author pointed out that climate related issue at its core, is a result of us (humans) chasing short-term gain over long term interest of humanity. And to [address this core issue](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-case-for-clean-money/10684#:\\\\~:text=%20only%20one%20option%20that%20can%20rise%20to%20meet%20this%20existential%20risk.%20we%20must%20harness%20the%20most%20powerful%20and%20ancient%20tool%20of%20our%20species%3A%20the%20power%20of%20money.), it is suggested that a problem (climate issue) created by money needs to be resolved by money as well.\\n\\nKilmaDAO’s approach is rather straightforward, buying up all the carbon offsets in VCM to 1) encourage more carbon emission reduction projects based on higher demand and higher profit, and 2) force carbon emission companies to find other ways to reduce or avoid emissions in order to save money, given that KilmaDAO buys up the supply and drive carbon offset price up.\\n\\nI do think KlimaDAO earned its right to test the market in such way, and I’m not here to question how realistic is their goal and whether their approach is the best solutions. The idea of buying up all carbon offsets in the market to drive a fundamental shift of market sentiments toward carbon emission may be naive and imperfect, however, I believe at least some real money will go towards actually reducing carbon emission, just like every other charity project (from what I heard, 70% fund goes to the fundraising team and less than 30% went to the people in need, but I could be wrong though this topics deserves another piece in itself) .\\n\\nSo what are we doing when we buy KilmaDAO? Was this an action of investing or charity donation? This is up to each individual to decide, **I’m here to answer my own question - whether KilmaDAO would qualify for an good investment, and to answer this question I must understand if BCT holds value to the market.**\\n\\n## BCT Valuation\\n\\nAn an unofficial on-chain version of Verra’s VCUs via Toucan Protocol, BCT is valuable if someone is willing to purchase it for meeting their carbon emission reduction target (as previously mentioned, the VCM market will continue to grow so demand will unlikely fall short), then BCT has perceived value and in terms, KilmaDAO as a “black hole“ accumulating BCT is stacking value for its own token KLIMA.\\n\\nAt this stage, BCT can only be minted by depositing VCUs to Toucan’s Carbon Pool and VCUs are only applicable to the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM), we can conclude that the Compliance Carbon Market (CCM) participants has no inventive or obligation to purchase them.\\n\\nSo the potential customer of BCT is essentially limited to companies, organizations and individuals participating in the VCM. **Will they buy BCT for their carbon neutral mission?**\\n\\nLet’s take a look at Microsoft’s [carbon removal purchase](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4MDlc) and the logic and criteria behinds its purchase for an answer to our question. Microsoft is relevant here as it was [penalised back in 2014](http://www.tanpaifang.com/tanjiaoyianli/2014/0707/34827.html) for over-emission in China and released [carbon negative plan](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/) in early 2020, which was well celebrated. With $161B reported revenue in 2021, Microsoft is strategically place and financially equipped to really shake up the VCM in its lukewarm state, therefore this is a perfect case study.\\n\\nIn 2021, Microsoft purchased in total 1.3M cubic tonne of carbon offsets/ reduction that are generated solely from Emission Removal Projects, bypassing emission reduction and avoidance project all together. The reason being:\\n\\n> We could no longer rely as heavily on carbon registries to validate project quality, because their standards were designed almost exclusively to measure and verify the claims of projects that avoid or reduce emissions, and we experienced a lack of consistency in how the standards address key criteria.\\n>\\n> ```\\n>                                                                                             - Abstract from report\\n> ```\\n\\nMicrosoft has also categorized projects based on their lifespan, and noted that most carbon offsets purchased to date was short-term projects (project lifespan < 100 years) , in the future procurement will be focused on long term projects (project lifespan > 1000 years).\\n\\nBased on the certification standards, I make a quick chart to visualised what Microsoft had purchased. We can observe that 60% procured carbon offset came through [American Carbon Registry (ACR)](http://www.offsetguide.org/understanding-carbon-offsets/carbon-offset-programs/voluntary-offset-programs/american-carbon-registry/) Standards, next big chunk (23%) is offsets with no certification and VCS (Standards behinds VCUs) makes up 8%. ACR is another VCM certification standards that evaluates mostly US domestic project, where Verra contains mostly project originated in South East Asia and South America.\\n\\n![Carbon Offsets allocation based on certification standards](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gRCwyyobxf_YEq1KaltCd.png?height=482&width=929)\\n\\nBelow is what I gathered:\\n\\n1. When purchasing carbon offsets, Microsoft takes a systematic approach with detailed evaluation criteria (as one can expect), and evaluate procurement on base by case basis.\\n\\n   Firstly, the quality issue behind various VCM certification standards was highlighted from the very beginning. These certification standards are designed and managed by various entities, e.g. ACR and Verra are most well-known. But their assessment process varies and some projects were certified purely on the basis of **“ projected carbon emission reduction** “. [The Guardian reported](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/04/carbon-offsets-used-by-major-airlines-based-on-flawed-system-warn-experts) specifically on this matter, where they tracked 10 Verra certified projects and found that these projects were all certified using different methods (really should be the same methods) and questioned manipulation of data to achieve end result.\\n2. Microsoft clearly defined its future procurement will be targeting long-term projects (project lifespan > 1000 years), due to constraint today most  carbon offsets procured to date came from short-term projects (project lifespan < 100 years), i.e. afforestation, reforestation, and forest protection projects.\\n\\n   **Long term projects** are carbon removal projects that utilising scientific and technological methods to remove carbon in the atmosphere, non-labour intensive methods such as [carbon capture and storage (BECCS)](https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/resources/what-is-carbon-capture-and-storage/) and [Biochar etc](https://www.wakefieldbiochar.com/science-of-biochar/). However, these technologies are not mature enough as of now and the cost is extremely high and the effectiveness remains a mystery. Additionally there are no certification standards applicable for them. Microsoft had only purchased 6000 cubic tonnes from this category (4% of total)\\n\\n   The reason behind avoiding **short-term projects** in the future is the challenge facing  maintenance and the fact that, certification process is high subjective. Take an example of forest protection project with average 10-30 years project lifespan, there need to be as dedicated project team to carry our various maintenance tasks, and if for some reason they couldn’t continue or change their plan to purchase other interest, it is really hard to prolong these project and the legitimacy of the carbon offsets produced will be in doubt.\\n\\n   In addition, after examining Verra’s documents I discovered that there is a long of “wiggle room” to gain certification. Firstly, Any project can start applying for Verra certification since launch and claim maximum of 10 years worth of projected carbon offsets and start trading on Verra Register. And after 10 years, no re-assessment is required to claim for another 10 years worth for a maximum of 30 years to claim since project inception.  What needs to be stressed here is: no re-assessment required to obtain new projected carbon offsets. Essentially the older the project, the harder it is to ensure authenticity of the offsets. This is also the reason behind Toucan Protocol does not accept carbon offsets prior to 2008 on-chain.\\n\\n   Secondly, Verra projects are indeed subject to human influence when it comes to certification. Verra non-for-profit organization only provides the certification criteria (VCS) and the certifier of a given project is done by a team of third party consultants, who is engaged and hired by the project owner. Yes, the certifier (Party B) is hired by the project (Party A), which is a huge Red Flag and conflict of interest. The certifier is supposed to monitor whether the certified carbon reduction project meets the standards set by Verra without taking a position, but in reality he is paid by the project and has other future business tied to his “performance” today. I find it hard to believe that any certifier would put up any \\\"roadblocks\\\" in getting a project certified under these circumstances.\\n3. Lastely, I guess Microsoft bought 60% of its carbon emissions from ACR, and most of its N/A (no certification standards) projects based US, with some geopolitical considerations. As a listed US company, it is wise to pick US based projects when there is really no great options in the market. The pressure of public opinion and regulation from within the United States will be most relevant to Microsoft. In the rising era of Political Correctness (PC), any climate related negative exposure will have a real impact on their share price and public image. This is fundamental behind Microsoft’ carbon removal purchase and therefore, US domestic projects will remain top of the list in the near future.\\n\\n![We all love PC principal ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z7uRmwoDspa3ivhxp9kIZ.png?height=600&width=600)\\n\\nNow let’s take a look at BCT and how it might fit into Microsoft’s procurement criteria? **The short answer is it does NOT fit in** and I’ll address this point by point.\\n\\n1. **No.** BCT can only be generated via VCS at this stage, which makes up 8% of the prochase. This portion is further reduced as Microsoft purchased offsets from Emission Removal Projects exclusively, which means applicable BCT is reduced as well. As mentioned before, BCT is a fungible token without specific project detail and attributes in it, and only represent a base tonnage of Toucan’s Carbon Pool containing carbon offsets from projects of varying quality,  one cannot buy them on case on case basis.\\n2. **No.** The problem remains a Verra related problem. Verra certified projects are mostly short term and are flawed in the eyes of Microsoft. This is reflected by the percentage of projects with no certification (23%) weights in higher than Verra certified projects (7%)😓.\\n3. **No.** Most Verra projects originated from South East Asia (China, India, Indonesia) and South America ( Brasil, Peru) , and has minimum exposure to US domestic projects. This is possibly due to the fact that there are many certification standards within US so the choices are plentiful, and many projects likely have off market buyer so there is no need for a public sale for its carbon offsets.\\n\\n![Verra Project Origin](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3aJZf1MR9rTgd2CQ1ALAq.png?height=321&width=1100&&size=large)\\n\\n**Couple more points I’d like to add:**\\n\\nVerra has stated on its website that the carbon offsets listed in Verra Registry **[“Cannot be transferred to other database or trade as paper certificates“](https://verra.org/project/vcs-program/registry-system/verified-carbon-units-vcus/#:\\\\~:text=vcus%20cannot%20be%20transferred%20to%20other%20databases%20or%20traded%20as%20paper%20certificates.%20),** which means its “on-chain equivalent” BCT is not guaranteed or recognized by Verra. Please do note this with caution when buying BCT to offset carbon emission.\\n\\nAlso at this stage, BCTs can only be minted via depositing VCUs, but BCTs cannot be redeemed for VCUs in reserve, this feature is still being developed by Toucan Protocol. Even if we assume that BCTs can be used to redeem VCUs in the future, there exist a possibility of exploits when we know older carbon offsets are questionable, hence less valuable; a speculators can buy these older, unwanted carbon offsets from VCM and deposit into Toucan’s Carbon Pool and use the minted BCT to redeem “fresh” VCUs that are less than 2 years old and profit from this. This is worrying because the Carbon Pool/ BCT will be striped of fresh and valuable VCUs and hold a bag of older, unwanted, “expired” VCUs.\\n\\nWe take another step back to say, Toucan/ BCT can fix this by changing its mechanism. But the VCUs are not perpetual in nature and are prone to expiry due to the concept of [Vintage Year](https://secondnature.org/climate-action-guidance/purchasing-carbon-offsets-faqs/#:\\\\~:text=standards%20mentioned%20above.-,what%20does%20vintage%20year%20mean%3F,-The%20vintage%20year). So that in essence, KlimaDAO is purchasing and hoarding an expiring, depreciating asset as its backing asset, and mint KLIMA on 1:1 ratio, I can only conclude this plan is questionable at the very least.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nIn summary at this stage, the value and legitimacy of BCT and the future of KlimaDAO is closely correlated, when the question and concerns I have on BCT, I am in the view that KilmaDAO is in the same dilemma. KilmaDAO at its current state, is at best a Proof of Concept and need to withstand the test of time to see how the future will playout. \\n\\n## Three Suggestions for KilmaDAO\\n\\n1. Allow other form of carbon offsets to mint KLIMA, and leverage its trading volume to engage the VCM participants, incl. certifier, clients regulatory bodies. \\n2. Work with Toucan and improve Carton Pool minting mechanism, perhaps auto-burn the older and soon-to-expired VCUs in the pool. This way BCT will be baked with fresher VCUs and temporarily alleviate deflation rate. \\n3. Invest in real carbon reduction projects in a open book maner to control the quality of its carbon offsets.\\n\\nThank you for reading my thoughts to the end :)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### You can also check out below protocols that are on the same mission to revolutionise the VCM.\\n\\n* [Regen Network](https://www.regen.network/)\\n* [Changeblock](https://twitter.com/Changeblock_io)\\n\\n### Extended reading \\n\\n1.
