"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"> On Monday, January 10th, the Radicle community [voted to fund the first wave of the Radicle Grants Program](https://sybil.org/#/proposals/radicle/5). With six months and a $1M budget, the Radicle Grants Program will fund contributions that improve the Radicle ecosystem, and in turn, improve tooling for decentralized, open-source collaboration.\\n\\nWith these Treasury-funded community grants, we believe we are planting the first seeds of will grow to become a new model for funding open source. The aim is to directly support open source initiatives that help grow the Radicle product, the Radicle community, and the greater FOSS and Web3 community at large.\\n\\nIn essence: funding open source to grow open source ðŸ’«\\n\\n## The Committee\\n\\nThe Grants program will be managed by a committee made up of Radicle community members:\\n\\n* *Grants Lead:* [Bordumb](https://twitter.com/bordumbb) (Radicle Community)\\n* [Abbey Titcomb](https://twitter.com/abbey_titcomb) (Core Team)\\n* [Kei Kreutler](https://twitter.com/keikreutler) (Ecosystem)\\n* [Nader Dabit](https://twitter.com/dabit3) (Ecosystem)\\n* [Nassar Hayat](https://twitter.com/nassarhayat) (Core Team)\\n* [Reverie](https://twitter.com/hi_reverie) (comprised of [Derek Hsue](https://twitter.com/derek_hsue) and [Larry Sukernik](https://twitter.com/lsukernik) from the Radicle Community)\\n\\nThis group will act as signers of the [Radicle Grant Program's multi-sig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x394B920c5d39E0Ca40fCa2871569B6B90D750c7c/balances), which will ultimately fund projects. All Radicle Grants operations & budgets will be publicly managed and hosted on Radicle via the [grants.radicle.eth](https://app.radicle.network/orgs/grants.radicle.eth) org. The repositories are also [mirrored on GitHub](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants).\\n\\n## What is the scope of these grants?\\n\\nWe are open to funding anything that improves the Radicle ecosystem or the greater FOSS and Web3 community at large. Generally speaking, we have two categories of grants to do so:\\n\\n### ðŸŒ± Seed Grants\\n\\nSeed grants are meant for smaller contributions, both in terms of complexity and cost. These grants are for individuals or small teams looking for less than **$50,000** in funding.\\n\\nApplications for seed grants are reviewed by the grants committee on a rolling basis. If accepted, applications are then published publicly in our repositories.\\n\\n### ðŸŒ² Tree Grants\\n\\nTree grants are meant for larger teams, companies, or foundations working on a contribution larger in scope and complexity. They can provide funding from **$50,000 - $500,000**.\\n\\nApplications for tree grants are reviewed and discussed by the grants committee and community at large on a rolling basis. They may take more time to review.\\n\\n## How do I apply for a grant?\\n\\nThere are two ways to apply for a Seed or Tree grant:\\n\\n### ðŸŽ¨ Freeform\\n\\nSubmit an application for any work you think deserves funding, whether it's a contribution to Radicle, FOSS, or Web3 in general.\\n\\n* Copy and fill out our handy markdown template [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/main/grants/applications/template.md).\\n* Create a new post in the [grants category](https://radicle.community/c/grants/24) of [radicle.community](https://radicle.community/).\\n\\n### ðŸ’Œ Request for Proposals (RFP)\\n\\nSubmit an application towards an existing request for proposals, most likely posted by us on [Discourse forum](https://radicle.community/c/grants/24). RFPs describe work that the Radicle core team & community would like to see developed and/or prioritized!\\n\\n* If we've posted an RFP, just drop a reply on Discourse with some details on why you'd be a good fit. You can see some of the [details we're looking for here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/main/grants/applications/template.md).\\n\\n> If you don't want to work on a grant, but have an idea, feel free to create an [RFP using our template](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/blob/main/rfps/template.md) and post it on the [grants category](https://radicle.community/c/grants/24) of [radicle.community](https://radicle.community/).\\n\\n### Which application is right for me?\\n\\nðŸŒ± If your project is smaller in scope, has a shorter timeline, and/or can be clearly defined by a set of deliverables, a **Seed Grant** is probably best. It's a faster process.\\n\\nðŸŒ² If your project is larger in scope & timeline, features more complex technical work, and/or requires longer-term collaboration, we recommend a **Tree Grant**. Tree Grants are also best fit for partnership proposals.\\n\\n### What happens after I apply?\\n\\nIf applying for a Seed Grant, your application will be reviewed by the [Grants Committee](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants#team) on a rolling basis. You should receive a response within a week.\\n\\nFor Tree Grants, once your application is published via [radicle.community](https://radicle.community/c/grants/24), the application will remain open for public discussion. Unless further discussion is warranted, you should receive a response within two weeks.\\n\\nAfter an application is submitted and reviewed, the committee will vote to approve funding. Once approved, you will receive a first payment (40%) to kickoff the grant work. Upon completion, you will receive the remaining 60%.\\n\\n## Where can I find more info?\\n\\nIf you have any questions, feel free to reach out on the Grant's #general space on [Radicle's Discord](https://discord.gg/fUK5BGtyTR). Or contact the grants lead at [bordumbb@gmail.com](mailto:bordumbb@gmail.com).\\n\\nYou can find more information in the [Radicle Grants workspace](https://forest-text-046.notion.site/Radicle-Grants-cf58bc44342d4e2f84605a701f41a137).
