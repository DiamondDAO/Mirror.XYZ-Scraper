"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Sometime last year I decided to start giving a meaningful amount of my income to charity. It has been one of the simplest and most freeing changes I've made to my life. I hope others will consider it.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, it's not that deep. I believe a few things at a conceptual level:\\n- Life outcomes are mostly based on luck\\n- I'm luckier than most\\n- I think the lucky among us should [shoulder some responsibility](https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/veil-of-ignorance) for the less lucky\\nI also believe at a practical level:\\n- Society fails to care for the unlucky\\n- [Everything is commensurable](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/19/nobody-is-perfect-everything-is-commensurable/) and the best way for me to help the unlucky is to give money\\n\\nSo when Alex asked me if I'd [join the #CryptoGivingPledge](https://twitter.com/TheGivingBlock/status/1394321834326249478) I agreed. \\n\\nGiving is a simple and effective way to establish a baseline for helping your fellow man. Perhaps there's a non-monetary way I can move the needle that dwarfs the impact of financial gifts but I don't know what that is yet. Until then, giving is a wonderful placeholder that brings me joy. I hope you will consider it. \\n\\n[NFT](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/35855)\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1621271149,\"title\":\"On giving\",\"publication\":\"tony\"},\"digest\":\"5EqFEYCIBmpwlw15SLHNGZ01WXXbVEA5YzK7pPaFB44\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9b217B4B9533bb2c78504cDcCAdf5739cFa27E86\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"oSyS2svh0AjDjhAyc5mhToNajAfTNDECOVDz84ZPdHw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Sm9z1RqWOGXw9Ae2d5788o9tMA9Dzq3PUv3rTH6xcLE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"nnb9a2vsGW1BOn4YvcI62oOOuOosngyZgI2VgjlOrh5W4ABW4dsPRkZ6JSgSMwOuhc2CinpoO63fFMgEPP_daQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9aeb6b1ca34f7ae2b879f5204e2ae8b0e67643834c7da7119bff119c30889f7f715e8be00feabf816b933378e127512ff187d0846e5a2ab856a0f5af8b6298a01b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on tony.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"oSyS2svh0AjDjhAyc5mhToNajAfTNDECOVDz84ZPdHw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Sm9z1RqWOGXw9Ae2d5788o9tMA9Dzq3PUv3rTH6xcLE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"5EqFEYCIBmpwlw15SLHNGZ01WXXbVEA5YzK7pPaFB44\"}"
