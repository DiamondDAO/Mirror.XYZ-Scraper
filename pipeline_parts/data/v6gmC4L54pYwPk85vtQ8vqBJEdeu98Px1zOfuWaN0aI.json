Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is used to mimic a site’s predevelopment hydrology by minimizing disturbed areas and impervious cover and then infiltrating, filtering, storing,\\nevaporating, and detaining storm water runoff close to its source. LID practices include measures such as preserving undeveloped open space, rain gardens, green roofs, porous\\npavement, bio-retention basin and vegetative swales. LID has a number of advantages over conventional stormwater management practices. LID can reduce or eliminate the need for larger detention ponds and flood controls. It also reduces pollutant loading to receiving waters as well as stream bank erosion associated with peak flows. LID also can provide a visual amenity in developments and allow more flexible site layouts. Finally, LID can cost less than conventional techniques.\\nThe results of our project show that LID can restore predevelopment site hydrology, but the amount of LID required is substantial. However, the cost review shows that the extra LID expense could be recovered in certain locations through development of the detention pond land which is no longer needed.\\n\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n\\nChapter No.\\nChapter Title\\nPage No.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\n9-18\\n1\\\\.1\\nWhat is LID ?\\n9\\n1\\\\.2\\nTypes of LID Controls\\n10-14\\n1\\\\.2.1\\nPervious Pavements\\n10\\n1\\\\.2.2\\nVegetative Swales\\n11\\n1\\\\.2.3\\nRain Gardens\\n12\\n1\\\\.2.4\\nBio-Retention Basins\\n13\\n1\\\\.2.5\\nGreen Roofs\\n14\\n1\\\\.3\\nWhat is SWMM ?\\n15-17\\n1\\\\.4\\nNeed of Study\\n18\\n2\\nObjectives\\n19\\n3\\nLiterature Review\\n20-23\\n3\\\\.1\\nLow Impact Development\\n20\\n3\\\\.2\\nPervious Pavement\\n21\\n3\\\\.3\\nUrban Flooding\\n22\\n3\\\\.4\\nStorm Water Management Model\\n23\\n4\\nStudy Area\\n24-25\\n5\\nRanfall Studies for Study Area\\n26-28\\n6\\nMethodology\\n29-37\\nChapter No.\\nChapter Title\\nPage No.\\n6\\\\.1\\nData Collection\\n30\\n6\\\\.2\\nData Simulation and Analysis\\n30-32\\n6\\\\.3\\nPervious Pavement Design\\n33-37\\n7\\nSimulation Results\\n38\\n8\\nCalculations\\n39-40\\n9\\nValidation\\n41-42\\n10\\nConclusions\\n43\\n11\\nReferences\\n44-45\\n\\nLIST OF FIGURES\\n\\nFigure No.\\nName of Figure\\nPage No.\\n1\\\\.\\nPervious Pavement\\n10\\n2\\\\.\\nVegetative Swale\\n11\\n3\\\\.\\nRain Garden\\n12\\n4\\\\.\\nBio-Retention Basin\\n13\\n5\\\\.\\nGreen Roof\\n14\\n6\\\\.\\nSWMM Window-1\\n17\\n7\\\\.\\nSWMM Window-2\\n17\\n8\\\\.\\nStudy Area\\n25\\n9\\\\.\\nSWMM Rainfall Analysis Window\\n26\\n10\\\\.\\nSummary Result Window-1\\n31\\n11\\\\.\\nWater Elevation Profile-1\\n31\\n12\\\\.\\nSummary Result Window-2\\n32\\n13\\\\.\\nWater Elevation Profile-2\\n32\\n14\\\\.\\nPervious Pavement\\n33\\n15\\\\.\\nPervious Pavement Layers\\n34\\n16\\\\.\\nSubcatchment Flow Diagram\\n41\\n17\\\\.\\nSubcatchment Flow Chart\\n41\\n\\nLIST OF TABLES\\n\\nTable No.\\nName of Table\\nPage No.\\n1\\\\.\\nStandard Specifications for Pavement Design\\n37\\n2\\\\.\\nSimulation Results\\n38\\n3\\\\.\\nSubcatchment Flow Distribution\\n42\\n\\nChapter 1 : INTRODUCTION\\nWhat is Low Impact Development (LID) ?\\nThe term Low Impact Development (LID) refers to systems and practices that use  natural processes that result in the infiltration, evapotranspiration or use of stormwater in order to protect water quality and associated aquatic habitat.\\nLID is an approach to land development (or re-development) that works with nature to manage stormwater as close to its source as possible. LID employs principles such as preserving and recreating natural landscape features, minimizing effective imperviousness to create functional and appealing site drainage that treat stormwater as a resource rather than a waste product.\\nThere are many practices that have been used to adhere to these principles such as bioretention facilities, rain gardens, vegetated rooftops, rain barrels and permeable pavements. Low Impact Development or LID practices manage stormwater by minimizing impervious cover and by using natural or man-made systems to filter and recharge stormwater into the ground. Roads, parking lots, and other types of impervious cover are the most significant contributors to stormwater runoff. There is a direct relationship between the amount of impervious cover and the biological and physical condition of downstream receiving waters.\\nThe goal of LID is to reduce runoff and to mimic a site’s predevelopment hydrology by minimizing disturbed areas and impervious cover and then infiltrating, filtering, storing, evaporating, and detaining stormwater runoff close to its source. LID practices include measures such as preserving undeveloped open space, rain gardens, green roofs, pervious pavement, and biofiltration.\\n\\nTypes of LID Controls\\n1\\\\.2.1  Pervious Pavements\\nPervious Pavements are alternative paving surfaces that allows storm water Run-off to filter through voids in the pavement surface into a under-laying stone reservoirs, where it is temporarily stored and/or infiltrated. The plastic pervious concrete mixture is stiff compared to traditional concrete. Slumps, when measured, are generally less than ¾ inches (20 mm), although slumps as high as 2 inches (50 mm) have been used. When placed and compacted, the aggregates are tightly adhered to one another and exhibit the characteristic open matrix.\\n\\nFigure 1\\n\\n1\\\\.2.2  Vegetative Swales\\nVegetated swales are broad, shallow channels designed to convey and infiltrate stormwater runoff. The swales are vegetated along the bottom and sides of the channel, with side vegetation at a height greater than the maximum design stormwater volume. The design of swales seeks to reduce stormwater volume through infiltration, improve water quality through infiltration and vegetative filtering, and reduce runoff velocity by increasing flow path lengths and channel roughness.\\nDesigned to manage runoff primarily by reducing its velocity for increased treatment efficiency by a downstream practice, vegetated surfaces provide water quality pretreatment through filtering, biological uptake mechanisms, and subsoil cation exchange capacity.\\n\\nFigure 2\\n\\n1\\\\.2.3  Rain Gardens\\nA rain garden is a garden of native shrubs, perennials, and flowers planted in a small depression, which is generally formed on a natural slope. It is designed to temporarily hold and soak in rain water runoff that flows from roofs, driveways, patios or lawns. Rain gardens are effective in removing up to 90% of nutrients and chemicals and up to 80% of sediments from the rainwater runoff. Compared to a conventional lawn, rain gardens allow for 30% more water to soak into the ground.\\nA rain garden is not a water garden. Nor is it a pond or a wetland. Conversely, a rain garden is dry most of the time. It typically holds water only during and following a rainfall event. Because rain gardens will drain within 12-48 hours, they prevent the breeding of mosquitoes.\\n\\nFigure 3\\n\\n1\\\\.2.4  Bio-Retention Basins\\nBioretention basins are landscaped depressions or shallow basins used to slow and treat on-site stormwater runoff. Stormwater is directed to the basin and then percolates through the system where it is treated by a number of physical, chemical and biological processes. The slowed, cleaned water is allowed to infiltrate native soils or directed to nearby stormwater drains or receiving waters.\\nBioretention is the process in which contaminants and sedimentation are removed from stormwater runoff. Stormwater is collected into the treatment area which consists of a grass buffer strip, sand bed, ponding area, organic layer or mulch layer, planting soil, and plants. Runoff passes first over or through a sand bed, which slows the runoff's velocity, distributes it evenly along the length of the ponding area, which consists of a surface organic layer and/or groundcover and the underlying planting soil.\\n\\nFigure 4\\n\\n1\\\\.2.5  Green Roofs\\nA green roof or living roof is a roof of a building that is partially or completely covered with vegetation and a growing medium, planted over a waterproofing membrane. It may also include additional layers such as a root barrier and drainage and irrigation systems. Container gardens on roofs, where plants are maintained in pots, are not generally considered to be true green roofs, although this is debated. Rooftop ponds are another form of green roofs which are used to treat greywater. Vegetation, soil, drainage layer, roof barrier and irrigation system constitute green roof.\\nGreen roofs serve several purposes for a building, such as absorbing rainwater, providing insulation, creating a habitat for wildlife, increasing benevolence and decreasing stress of the people around the roof by providing a more aesthetically pleasing landscape, and helping to lower urban air temperatures and mitigate the heat island effect.\\n\\nFigure 5\\n1\\\\.3  What is Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) ?\\nEPA's Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is used throughout the world for planning, analysis, and design related to stormwater runoff, combined and sanitary sewers, and other drainage systems in urban areas. There are many applications for drainage systems in non-urban areas as well.\\nSWMM is a dynamic hydrology-hydraulic water quality simulation model. It is used for single event or long-term (continuous) simulation of runoff quantity and quality from primarily urban areas. The runoff component operates on a collection of sub-catchment areas that receive precipitation and generate runoff and pollutant loads. The routing portion transports this runoff through a system of pipes, channels, storage/treatment devices, pumps, and regulators.\\nSWMM tracks the quantity and quality of runoff made within each sub-catchment. It tracks the flow rate, flow depth, and quality of water in each pipe and channel during a simulation period made up of multiple time steps. SWMM 5 has recently been extended to model the hydrologic performance of specific types of low impact development (LID) controls.\\nSWMM accounts for various hydrologic processes that produce runoff from urban areas. These include:\\nTime-varying rainfall\\nEvaporation of standing surface water\\nSnow accumulation and melting\\nRainfall interception from depression storage\\nInfiltration of rainfall into unsaturated soil layers\\nPercolation of infiltrated water into groundwater layers\\nInterflow between groundwater and the drainage system\\nNonlinear reservoir routing of overland flow\\nCapture and retention of rainfall/runoff with various types of low impact development (LID) practices.\\nSWMM also contains a flexible set of hydraulic modeling capabilities used to route runoff and external inflows through the drainage system network of pipes, channels, storage/treatment units and diversion structures. These include the ability to:\\nHandle networks of unlimited size·\\nUse a wide variety of standard closed and open conduit shapes as well as natural channels·\\nModel special elements such as storage/treatment units, flow dividers, pumps, weirs, and orifices·\\nApply external flows and water quality inputs from surface runoff, groundwater interflow, rainfall-dependent infiltration/inflow, dry weather sanitary flow, and user-defined inflows\\nUtilize either kinematic wave or full dynamic wave flow routing methods·\\nModel various flow regimes, such as backwater, surcharging, reverse flow, and surface ponding·\\nApply user-defined dynamic control rules to simulate the operation of pumps, orifice openings, and weir crest levels.\\n\\nFigure 6\\n\\nFigure 7\\n1\\\\.4  Need of Study\\nThe recent shift of focus toward water quality management does not lessen the importance of flood control. For the last 40 years the primary purpose of stormwater management programs was to avoid flooding while providing quick and efficient drainage for all storms except the largest most infrequent events.\\nToday’s drainage designs still require water quantity control to address flooding concerns. Matching modeled pre and post development peak flow rates has been the most common management measure to date.\\nWater quality management represents a broadening of the overall objectives of drainage design and is in line with the objectives of the very first Clean Water Act in 1972. Treating for water quality is most effective when starting at the source of the stormwater and implementing techniques that promote intercepting, infiltrating, filtering and evaporating to the maximum extent practicable.\\nOfficials found that the traditional practices such as detention ponds and retention basins were not cost-effective and the results did not meet water quality goal. A concept that began in Prince George's County, Maryland in 1990, LID began as an alternative to traditional stormwater best management practices (BMPs) installed at construction projects.\\n\\nChapter 2 : OBJECTIVES\\nConserve natural areas wherever possible.\\nMinimize the development impact on hydrology.\\nMaintain runoff rate and duration from the site (don’t let the water leave the site).\\nScatter integrated management practices (IMPs) throughout your site – IMPs are decentralized, microscale controls that infiltrate, store, evaporate, and/or detain runoff close to the source.\\nPrevents flooding.\\nRainwater Harvesting.\\nMaintains drinking water supplies & instream flows.\\nReduces maintenance costs.\\nLess need for storage & conveyance.\\nCost effective urban retrofit.\\nImplement pollution prevention, proper maintenance and public education programs.\\n\\nChapter 3 : LITERATURE REVIEW\\n3\\\\.1  Low Impact Development\\nLaurent M Ahiablame, Bernard A. Engel and Indrajeet Chaubey (June 2012) says that Low impact development (LID) is a land development strategy for managing stormwater at the source with decentralized micro-scale control measures. Since the emergence of LID practices, they have been successfully used to manage stormwater runoff, improve water quality, and protect the environment. However, discussions still surround the effectiveness of many of these practices, resulting in a reluctance to widely adopt them. This paper highlights evidence in the literature regarding the beneficial uses of LID practice. Finally, the paper suggests directions for future research opportunities.\\nEdwin Chiang and Neil Weinstein (May 2015)  says that eliminating or substantially reducing pollutant loads are the regulatory focus of many stormwater permits in estuary or coastal areas where installations are located. The volume of stormwater that is generated from naval installations, as well as the resultant pollutant load, is also of increasing concern. This is because of the significant discharge fees for impervious areas that are being charged by municipalities and states to fund their compliance programs. Strategies and technologies that can reduce pollutant loads and the volume of runoff, or discharge of stormwater, will be critical to compliance strategies and to reduce operational costs at installations.\\nEd MacMullan and Sarah Reich (November 2007) has concluded that Low-impact development (LID) methods can cost less to install, have lower operations and maintenance (O&M) costs, and provide more cost-effective stormwater management and water-quality services than conventional stormwater controls. LID also provides ecosystem services and associated economic benefits that conventional stormwater controls do not.\\n\\n3\\\\.2  Pervious Pavement\\nE. Gomez Ullate, J.R. Bayon, S. Coupe and D. Castro- Fresno (August 2010) told about an experimental pervious pavement parking area has been constructed in the north of Spain (Santander), with the aim of harvesting good quality rainwater. They gave confirmation in pervious laboratory experiments that geotextile influenced on water storage. The evaporation rates within the pervious pavement was not significant. Temperature was the most closely correlated factor.\\nBenjamin O. Brattebo, Derek B. Boath (November 2003) examined the long term effectiveness of permeable pavement as an alternative to traditional impervious asphalt pavement. After evaluating available pavement, they concluded that all rainwater infiltrated through the permeable pavements with almost surface runoff. The infiltrated water had significantly lower level of copper & zinc.\\nJ.D. Balades, M. Legret and H. Madiac (February 2000) had done lot of tests on permeable pavement demonstrate the rate at which clogging occurs. They said that in the first year there is a little change in underseepage rate but thereafter decline is rapid, reaching 50% of the original rate after 2 or 3 years. Method of preventive maintenance, such as suction, need to be used in order to avoid the use of even more costly methods, such as high pressure water jet.\\n\\n3\\\\.3  Urban Flooding\\nOle Mark and Slobodan Djardjevie (September 2004) said about modelling approaches and principles for analysis of urban flooding. Modelling approach is generic in the sense that it handles both urban flooding with and without flood water entry into houses. They showed how urban flooding cn be simulated by one-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling incorporating the interaction between the buried pipe system, the streets with open channel flow and the areas flooded with stagnant water.\\nTheo  G. Schmitt and Narman Ettrich (December 2004) outlined the regulatory background of European standard EN 752 defining flood frequency as the one hydraulic performance criterion. They gave special consideration to the interaction between surface and sewer flow routing procedure for surface flow and pipe flow phenomenon of urban flooding caused by surcharged sewer systems in urban drainage system leading to the necessity of dual drainage modelling.\\nS. Yu Schreider, D.I. Smith and A.J. Jakeman (October 2000) estimated the damage of flood events caused by increase of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. They presented it in two parts (1) the modelling of flood frequency and magnitude under global warming and associated rainfall intensities. (2) The use of green house flood data to assess changes in the vulnerability of flood prone urban areas, expressing these in terms of direct losses.\\n\\n3\\\\.4  Storm Water Management Model (SWMM)\\nM.L. Waikar and Undegaonkar Namita (January 2015) applied the US EPA SWMM model and GIS to an urban catchment in SGGSIE&T campus and used Rational Method for comparison. The total runoff from whole catchment by SWMM is 2.177 m3/sec whereas by Rational Method is 1.109 m3/sec. Results of simulation show that SWMM gives relatively excess runoff values as compared to Rational Method. The application of SWMM achieves catchment responses to peak flow and runoff volume, which are the two most essential catchment responses in urban drainage planning.\\nMatthew McCutcheon and Derek Wride (July 2013) says that LID controls are an important addition to SWMM, given the increasing interest in use of green infrastructure to reduce urban runoff. Many public and private entities are considering green infrastructure in future developments or as remediation techniques for stormwater problems. The application of green infrastructure and LID continues to grow worldwide. SWMM’s LID controls are a useful tool for analyzing the impacts of green infrastructure on stormwater and sanitary collection systems.\\nS.H. Lai, A. Ab. Ghani, N.A. Zakaria, C.S. Leow, C.K. Chang and M.F. Yusuf (December 2000) produced a new urban drainage manual emphasized on the use of Best Management Practices (BMPs) and used SWMM to overcome frequent occurrences of flash flood in some major areas of Malaysia. They concluded that the proposed channel improvement works and design is able to cater for the flooding problem in the study area successfully.  These results further emphasized that the BMPs and design criteria suggested in SWMM are able to solve the urban stormwater problems in terms of quantity and quality control, and it should be recommended for practical application throughout a developing country like Malaysia.\\n\\nChapter 4 : STUDY AREA\\nKanjhawala basin which is a sub-basin of the Najafgarh main basin is situated on the North Western part of the Union Territory of Delhi.  This basin is bounded by Alipur basin on its east, Najafgarh sub-basin on its South, and Haryana State on its North & West sides.  It is having its boundary with M.C.D. and D.D.A also on its South-East sides.  A general feature plan & a contour plan of the basin are enclosed as Drawings K-I & K-II.  The N.H.No.10 viz. Rohtak Road runs through this block from East to West direction.  The broad-gauge Railway line towards Rohtak also runs parallel to the main Rohtak road. It has got a common border with Rohtak district of Haryana State for about 20 miles length.\\n\\nThe total area of the sub-basin is approximately 83.50 sq. miles.  It is generally slopping towards South.  The maximum & minimum contours are R.L. 724 (ft.) and R.L. 687 (ft.) respectively. The whole area is rural except a small part on the South East corner (about 5.20 sq. miles) which is covered by the Master Plan boundary of Delhi. Eight Nos. irrigation channels coming from Haryana State to Irrigate the area of this block. There are three main storm water drains and 24 tributaries already existing in the basin which are described in detail in the chapter on the Existing Drainage system and their remodeling.\\n\\n```\\nTopographically Kanjhawala basin is a flat area.  It contains approximately 46 villages with a population of nearly 1.05 lacs.  The drainage zone consists of 53 villages within the Union Territory of Delhi.  The present population as per 1971 census is enclosed as Drawing K-III.\\n```\\n\\nThe sub-soil water in this basin generally varies between 1 foot to 25 feet below the ground level.  Two plans showing the minimum and the maximum water tables are enclosed as Drawing K-IV & K-V. Part of this basin, particularly on the southern side suffers from water scarcity during dry weather. The drainage zone of Kanjhawala basin is very extensive.  In addition to its own catchments, it receives discharges from part of Haryana State and Alipur basin, through west Jua drain & Nangloi drain respectively.\\n\\nFigure 8\\n\\nThis is the satellite image of our study area in Rohini Sector-9\\n\\nChapter 5 : RAINFALL STUDIES FOR STUDY AREA\\nThe Kanjhawala basin which falls under the category of rural areas of U.T. of Delhi covers an area of about 215 Sq. Km. Out of this total area, approximately 15 Sq. Km. is semi-urban.  The network of rain gauges within Delhi Territory was limited to only two stations i.e. Palam and Safdarjung for which long term rainfall records are available.  The storm rainfall analysis was carried out by the Reddy Committee during 1958 when it was found that the rainfall in Delhi Territory is quite erratic and existing stations are considered inadequate for detailed analysis of the rainfall for the different Blocks.  It was then recommended by the Reddy Committee that the network of rain gauges in the Delhi Territory should be suitably strengthened.  Accordingly, in consultation with IMD,14 self recording rain gauges have been installed throughout the Delhi Territory during 1973.  Besides, there are existing rain gauge stations in adjoining states viz. U.P. and Haryana.  Rainfall data from the relevant rain gauge stations for this basin for the year 1973 to 1975 are enclosed as Drawing K-IV.\\n\\nFigure 9\\n\\nThe growth centers are at present having some sort of drainage arrangement which is very inadequate.  No plan exists showing the details of the drainage.  This must be properly surveyed and completed drainage plan with L-Sections of the drains should be submitted to the Delhi Administration, Flood Control Wing for approval.  Here also the drains must be terminated at sump wells through which irrigation in the fields will be done. The drains must be well planned keeping in view the future increase in population, increase in the paved areas and increase in the industrial waste.  All drains must be covered. The construction of buildings in low lying areas should be dismantled either by the Administration /local bodies or by the owners themselves. If at all, buildings are to be constructed at low areas, the plinth must be above the expected flood level.  All roads should also be above such flood levels. Any construction of road must have a provision of covered drainage system by its side. Persons misusing the drains or responsible for their checking shall be punished under law.  Local bodies must employ sanitary Personnel to   clean out the drains and regularly spread DDT etc.  in them Cattle must not be allowed to squat on the road and cause nuisance and block the drainage system.  Prizes may be awarded to the villages keeping their sanitary conditions above average.\\n\\nThe drains in the rural area are being looked after by the FCD, Delhi Administration, Delhi.  It has been observed during inspection that annual maintenance of a number of drains has been neglected altogether.  In some cases no regular banks are there where as at certain places cart tracks are crossing the drains, thus obstructing the natural flow.\\n\\nThere is a lot of weed growth in certain reaches of the drains and more over sections of the drains are not uniform.  Farmers are using the bed of the drain for cultivation purposes at a number of places. Such practices are to be checked completely and constant vigil by the field staff of the FCD is required to stop any unauthorized blocking of the drain any time during the year.  The blockings are sometimes due to crossing of irrigation channels, which is to be totally discouraged.  Crossing if any, shall be with pipes allowing proper water way for the drain to pass unobstructed.  The field staff of FCD of Delhi Administration has to submit a report of all the obstructions created along the drainage channels every fortnight and these are to be cleared before the next three days positively.  Before the start of monsoon, silt clearance of the drains must be taken  up every year and sections to be restored to designed sizes.  Cultivators blocking the drains or cultivating in the beds of the drains, shall be legally punished.  Sectional Officer allowing such practices are to be dismissed.  Villagers causing blockage to drains shall be punished under law.  Relevant acts shall be made known to the villagers for strict compliance. It is also observed that the irrigation channels in the Kanjhawla block oncoming from Haryana State often overflow near their tailends in the monsoon season, there being no surplus sing arrangement.  This inundates the neighboring low lying areas.\\n\\nSome of the branch drains Mungeshpur drain in Kanjhawala Block viz. West Jua drain, Thana Khurd drain & Mandrola drain have their origin in Haryana State and they carry considerable discharge into Delhi.  With the construction of diversion drain No.8 part of the catchment of the West Jua drain and  Thana Khurd drains have been diverted into it but still the present sections of the above drains are not sufficient to carry the entire discharge. Moreover, the annual maintenance of the above drains is also neglected.  With the result, during heavy rains, low lying areas of the basin adjacent to Haryana State get flooded by over flowing of said drains or by way of seepage through breached banks.  Haryana Govt. should therefore be asked for remodeling the sections of drains carrying discharge into Delhi and to provide proper banks to the above drains in the areas near\\n\\nThe border and also to provide adequate out falling arrangements. In order to relieve the drainage problems enumerated in the foregoing paragraphs, the proposed alignments of all the existing rains, including additional sub-drains wherever required, are marked in the plan enclosed as Drawing K-II.\\nChapter 6 : METHODOLOGY\\n\\n6\\\\.1  Data Collection\\nCatchment and Conduit data was collected from Drainage Master Plan for NCT of Delhi. This data is collected to identify the maximum flooding zone in the catchment area.\\nRainfall Data of Delhi was collected from Indian Meteorological Department. This data is used to simulate the rainfall and flooding conditions in catchment area using SWMM software.\\nSatellite Image was collected from Google Earth. This data is used to identify and visualize the study area.\\n\\n6\\\\.2  Data Simulation\\nWith help of SWMM we have simulated the real world rainfall situation and processed many days of data in a very short time frame with help of previously available data. The span of rainfall data was 4 years which is from 2007-2010.\\n\\n6\\\\.2.1  Analyzing the Simulation Results\\nAfter analyzing the simulation results we have chosen the maximum flooding zone which has the total flood volume as 4.417x10^6 litres.\\nThe cause of this much amount of  flood volume at a single junction is because of the whole subcatchment discharge at a single junction or node.\\nAccording to maximum flooding zone, we choose our study area i.e; near Japanese Park in Rohini, Sector-9, Delhi.\\nAfter which we designed permeable pavements in our study area.\\n\\n6\\\\.2.2  Analysis of Results Before Applying Pervious Pavements\\nFirst we simulated the whole scenario, the simulator took few minutes to simulate the data. After that we opened the summary results and sorted data in decreasing order according to node flooding and chosen the maximum folding node which is J_10533 with 4.417×10 ^6 litres. Before applying pavements the original imperviousness of catchment was 81.4 % and total flood volume was 4.417x10^6 litres.\\n\\nFigure 10\\n\\nFigure 11\\n\\n6\\\\.2.3  Analysis of Results After Applying Permeable Pavements\\n\\nAfter applying pavements the varied  imperviousness of catchment was 75% and the total flood volume became 3.671x10^6 litres.\\nBecause of which the flooding volume is decreased by 0.746x10^6 litres and imperviousness reduced by 6.4 % .\\n\\nFigure 12\\nFigure 13\\n\\n6\\\\.2.4 Analysis of Results after Applying Permeable Pavements\\n\\nAgain, we simulated the model by reducing the imperviousness to 70 % .\\nBecause of which the flooding volume became 3.060x10^6 litres and is decreased by 1.357x10^6 litres as compared to the original data.\\n\\nFigure 14\\n\\nFigure 15\\n6\\\\.3  Pervious Pavement Design\\n\\nPervious Pavements are alternative paving surfaces that allows storm water Run-off to filter through voids in the pavement surface into a under-laying stone reservoirs, where it is temporarily stored and/or infiltrated. The plastic pervious concrete mixture is stiff compared to traditional concrete. Slumps, when measured, are generally less than ¾ inches (20 mm), although slumps as high as 2 inches (50 mm) have been used. When placed and compacted, the aggregates are tightly adhered to one another and exhibit the characteristic open matrix.\\nConcrete working time is typically reduced for pervious concrete mixtures. Usually, one hour between mixing and placing is all that is recommended. However, this can be controlled using retarders and hydration stabilizers that extend the working time by as much as 1.5 hours, depending on the dosage.\\n\\nFigure 14\\n\\n6\\\\.3.1\\tLayers of a pervious pavement\\n\\nFigure 15\\n\\nA = Surface Layer\\nB = Pavement Layer\\nC = Storage Layer\\nD = Soil Layer\\n\\nDesign Consideration Factors\\n(A)  Surface Layer\\nStorage Depth : When confining walls or berms are present this is the maximum\\t depth to which water can pond above the surface of the unit before overflow occurs.\\nVegetation Volume Fraction : The fraction of the volume within the surface storage depth filled with vegetation. This is the volume occupied by stems and leaves, not their surface area coverage.\\nSurface Roughness : Manning's n for overland flow over surface soil cover, pavement, roof surface or a vegetative swale.\\nSurface Slope : Slope of a roof surface, pavement surface or vegetative swale.\\n(B)  Pavement Layer\\nThickness : The thickness of the pavement layer.\\nVoid Ratio : The volume of void space relative to the volume of solids in the pavement for continuous systems or for  the fill material used in modular systems.\\nPermeability : Permeability of the concrete or asphalt used in continuous systems or hydraulic conductivity of the fill material (gravel or sand) used in modular systems.\\nClogging Factor : Number of pavement layer void volumes of runoff treated it takes to completely clog the pavement.  Clogging progressively reduces the pavement's permeability in direct proportion to the cumulative volume of runoff treated.\\n(C)  Storage LayerThickness : This is the thickness of a gravel layer or the height of a rain barrel.\\nVoid Ratio : The volume of void space relative to the volume of solids in the layer.\\nSeepage Rate : The rate at which water seeps into the native soil below the layer. This would typically be the Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity of the surrounding subcatchment.\\nStandard Specifications\\n\\nSurface Layer\\nPavement Layer\\nStorage Layer\\nStorage Layer (0 mm)\\nThickness (100-150 mm)\\nThickness (150-450 mm)\\nVegetation Volume Fraction (0%)\\nVoid Ratio (0.12-0.21)\\nVoid Ratio (0.5-0.75)\\n\\nSurface Roughness (0.012-0.02)\\nPermeability\\n(2000-2540 mm/hr)\\nSeepage Rate (5-12 mm)\\nSurface Slope (2-3%)\\nClogging Factor (0)\\nClogging Factor (0)\\n\\nTable 1\\n\\nThese are some standard specifications of Low Impact Development system.\\n\\nChapter 7: SIMULATION RESULTS\\nSTATUS\\n\\nIMPERVIOUSNESS\\n\\nFLOOD VOLUME (LITRES)\\n\\nREDUCTION IN FLOOD VOLUME\\n\\n## BEFORE APPLYING LID CONTROL\\n81\\\\.4 %\\n4\\\\.417x10^6\\n\\nAFTER APPLYING LID CONTROL\\n75 %\\n3\\\\.671x10^6\\n0\\\\.746x10^6\\nAFTER APPLYING LID CONTROL\\n70 %\\n3\\\\.060x10^6\\n1\\\\.357x10^6\\n\\nTable 2\\n\\nChapter 8 : CALCULATIONS\\n\\n8\\\\.1  Mass Balance in Junction J1\\n\\nInflow From Drain D1 (Q1) = 0.336x10^6 ltrs\\nInflow From Drain D2 (Q2) = 0.224x10^6 ltrs\\nRunoff From Pavement P1 (Q3) = 0.112x10^6 ltrs\\nFlow In Drain D3 (Q4) = 0.667x10^6 ltrs\\n\\nMass Balance Equation :-\\nQ1+Q2+Q3 = Q4\\n\\\\[0.336x10^6+ 0.224x10^6+ 0.112x10^6 = 0.672x10^6 ltrs\\\\]\\n\\nPercentage Error :-\\n\\\\[(0.672x10^6 – 0.667x10^6)/0.672x10^6\\\\]x100% = 0.74 %\\n\\n8\\\\.2  Mass Balance in Junction J2\\n\\nInflow From Drain D4 (Q1) = 0.348x10^6 ltrs\\nInflow From Drain D5 (Q2) = 0.232x10^6 ltrs\\nRunoff From Pavement P2 (Q3) = 0.1044x10^6 ltrs\\nFlow In Drain D6 (Q4) = 0.678x10^6 ltrs\\n\\nMass Balance Equation :-\\nQ1+Q2+Q3 = Q4\\n\\\\[0.348x10^6+ 0.232x10^6+ 0.1044x10^6 = 0.6844x10^6 ltrs\\\\]\\n\\nPercentage Error :-\\n\\\\[(0.6844x10^6 – 0.678x10^6)/0.6844x10^6\\\\]x100% = 0.93 %\\n\\n8\\\\.1  Mass Balance in Junction J3\\n\\nInflow From Drain D7 (Q1) = 0.21x10^6 ltrs\\nInflow From Drain D8 (Q2) = 0.14x10^6 ltrs\\nRunoff From Pavement P3 (Q3) = 0.105x10^6 ltrs\\nFlow In Drain D9 (Q4) = 0.453x10^6 ltrs\\n\\nMass Balance Equation :-\\nQ1+Q2+Q3 = Q4\\n\\\\[0.21x10^6+ 0.14x10^6+ 0.105x10^6 = 0.455x10^6 ltrs\\\\]\\n\\nPercentage Error :-\\n\\\\[(0.455x10^6 – 0.453x10^6)/0.455x10^6\\\\]x100% = 0.44 %\\n\\nResults table:-\\n\\nChapter 9 : VALIDATION\\n\\nWe obtained results of total inflow and outflow at each pavement through SWMM.\\nVerified the results obtained by SWMM using theoretical concepts (Mass Balance Equation).\\nFigure 16\\n\\nFigure 17\\nChapter 10: Conclusions\\n\\nThe project has a totals subcatchment study area of  81.9 Hectares . We have chosen a total area of pervious pavements as 0.24 Hectares. Then we have applied the LID with help of SWMM software and ran the simulation of real situations, which gave us the results as:-\\nTotal Flood Managed by Pervious Pavements = 2.8702x10^6 Litres\\n\\nAverage Efficiency of Pervious Pavements = 83.19 %\\n\\nTotal Reduction in Flood Volume = 1.357x10^6 Litres\\n\\nTherefore we have concluded that using pervious pavement as a form of\\nLow Impact Development can be very useful and effective for the rain water harvesting, ground water recharging and control flooding in certain regions with less permeability and rough geographical conditions. These features of pervious pavement system makes it more efficient and cost effective than the conventional techniques with less installation and low maintenance cost.\\n\\nChapter 11 : REFERENCES\\n\\nMatthew McCutcheon and Derek Wride (2013)\\n“Shades of Green : Using SWMM LID Controls to Simulate Green Infrastructure”\\nJournal of water management modelling R246-15 doi 10.14796/JWMM R246-15\\n@CHI2013 ISSN:2292-6062 ISBN:978-0-9808853-8-5\\n\\nWilliam James (1993), Director, School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Guelph, Canada\\n“Introduction to the SWMM Environment”\\nNIG 2WI@CHI2013 ISSN:2292-6062 ISBN:978-0-9808853-8-5\\n\\nML Waikar and Undegaonkar Namita U (2005), Department of Civil Engineering, Shri GGS Institute of Engineering and technology, Nanded (M.S.), India\\n“Urban Flood Modelling by using EPA SWMM 5”\\n@SRTM University’s Research Journal of Science, Vol. 34, No. 2, pp. 256-273\\n\\nMichael E.
