"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"You and I have no voice in it, though it is all about ourselves. As you say, we are like two tame birds, who have to be moved from one cage into another just as the owner pleases. We belong either to Uncle Tom or Uncle Dosett, just as they like to settle it. Oh, Lucy, I do so wish that I were dead.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ayala, that is wicked.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How can I help it, if I am wicked? What am I to do when I get there? What am I to say to them? How am I to live? Lucy, we shall never see each other.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will come across to you constantly.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I meant to do so, but I didn't. They are two worlds, miles asunder. Lucy, will they let Isadore Hamel come here?\\\" Lucy blushed and hesitated. \\\"I am sure he will come.\\\"\\n\\nLucy remembered that she had given her friend her address at Queen's Gate, and felt that she would seem to have done it as though she had known that she was about to be transferred to the other uncle's house. \\\"It will make no difference if he does,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I have such a dream -- such a castle in the air! If I could think it might ever be so, then I should not want to die.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you dream?\\\" But Lucy, though she asked the question, knew the dream.\\n\\n\\\"If you had a little house of your own, oh, ever so tiny; and if you and he -- ?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is no he.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There might be. And, if you and he would let me have any corner for myself, then I should be happy. Then I would not want to die. You would, wouldn't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How can I talk about it, Ayala? There isn't such a thing. But yet -- but yet; oh, Ayala, do you not know that to have you with me would be better than anything?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No -- not better than anything -- second best. He would be best. I do so hope that he may be 'he'. Come in.\\\" There was a knock at the door, and Aunt Emmeline, herself, entered the room.\\n\\n\\\"Now, my dears, the horses are standing there, and the men are coming up for the luggage. Ayala, I hope we shall see you very often. And remember that, as regards anything that is unpleasant, bygones shall be bygones.\\\" Then there was a crowd of farewell kisses, and in a few minutes Ayala was alone in the carriage on her road up to Kingsbury Crescent.\\n\\nThe thing had been done so quickly that hitherto there had hardly been time for tears. To Ayala herself the most remarkable matter in the whole affair had been Tom's persistence. He had, at last, been allowed to bring them home from Rome, there having been no other gentleman whose services were available for the occasion. He had been watched on the journey very closely, and had had no slant in his favour, as the young lady to whom he was devoted was quite as anxious to keep out of his way as had been the others of the party to separate them. But he had made occasion, more than once, sufficient to express his intention. \\\"I don't mean to give you up, you know,\\\" he had said to her. \\\"When I say a thing I mean it. I am not going to be put off by my mother. And as for the governor he would not say a word against it if he thought we were both in earnest.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I ain't in earnest,\\\" said Ayala; \\\"or rather, I am very much in earnest.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So am I. That's all I've got to say just at present.\\\" From this there grew up within her mind a certain respect for the \\\"lout\\\", which, however, made him more disagreeable to her than he might have been had he been less persistent.\\n\\nIt was late in the afternoon, not much before dinner, when Ayala reached the house in Kingsbury Crescent. Hitherto she had known almost nothing of her Aunt Dosett, and had never been intimate even with her uncle. They, of course, had heard much of her, and had been led to suppose that she was much less tractable than the simple Lucy. This feeling had been so strong that Mr Dosett himself would hardly have been led to sanction the change had it not been for that promise from Sir Thomas that he would not withdraw the provision he had made for Ayala, and would do as much for Lucy if Lucy should become an inmate of his family. Mrs Dosett had certainly been glad to welcome any change, when a change was proposed to her. There had grown up something of affection at the last moment, but up to that time she had certainly disliked her niece. Lucy had appeared to her to be at first idle and then sullen. The girl had seemed to affect a higher nature than her own, and had been wilfully indifferent to the little things which had given to her life whatever interest it possessed. Lucy's silence had been a reproach to her, though she herself had been able to do so little to abolish the silence. Perhaps Ayala might be better.\\n\\nBut they were both afraid of Ayala -- as they had not been afraid of Lucy before her arrival. They made more of preparation for her in their own minds, and, as to their own conduct, Mr Dosett was there himself to receive her, and was conscious in doing so that there had been something of failure in their intercourse with Lucy. Lucy had been allowed to come in without preparation, with an expectation that she would fall easily into her place, and there had been failure. There had been no regular consultation as to this new coming, but both Mr and Mrs Dosett were conscious of an intended effort.\\n\\nLady Tringle and Mr Dosett had always been Aunt Emmeline and Uncle Reginald, by reason of the nearness of their relationship. Circumstances of closer intercourse had caused Sir Thomas to be Uncle Tom. But Mrs Dosett had never become more than Aunt Dosett to either of the girls. This in itself had been matter almost of soreness to her, and she had intended to ask Lucy to adopt the more endearing form of her Christian name; but there had been so little endearment between them that the moment for doing so had never come. She was thinking of all this up in her own room, preparatory to the reception of this other girl, while Mr Dosett was bidding her welcome to Kingsbury Crescent in the drawing-room below.\\n\\nAyala had been dissolved in tears during the drive round by Kensington to Bayswater, and was hardly able to repress her sobs as she entered the house. \\\"My dear,\\\" said the uncle, \\\"we will do all that we can to make you happy here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am sure you will; but -- but -- it is so sad coming away from Lucy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lucy I am sure will be happy with her cousins.\\\" If Lucy's happiness were made to depend on her cousins, thought Ayala, it would not be well assured. \\\"And my sister Emmeline is always good-natured.\\\" \\\"Aunt Emmeline is very good, only -- \\\"\\n\\n\\\"Only what?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know. But it is such a sudden change, Uncle Reginald.\\\" \\\"Yes, it is a very great change, my dear. They are very rich and we are poor enough. I should hardly have consented to this, for your sake, but that there are reasons which will make it better for you both.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As to that,\\\" said Ayala, stoutly, \\\"I had to come away. I didn't suit.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You shall suit us, my dear.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hope so. I will try. I know more now than I did then. I thought I was to be Augusta's equal.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We shall all be equal here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"People ought to be equal, I think -- except old people and young people. I will do whatever you and my aunt tell me. There are no young people here, so there won't be any trouble of that kind.\\\" \\\"There will be no other young person, certainly. You shall go upstairs now and see your aunt.\\\"\\n\\nThen there was the interview upstairs, which consisted chiefly in promises and kisses, and Ayala was left alone to unpack her boxes and prepare for dinner. Before she began her operations she sat still for a few moments, and with an effort collected her energies and made her resolution. She had said to Lucy in her passion that she would that she were dead. That that should have been wicked was not matter of much concern to her. But she acknowledged to herself that it had been weak and foolish. There was her life before her, and she would still endeavour to be happy though there had been so much to distress her. She had flung away wealth. She was determined to fling it away still when it should present itself to her in the shape of her cousin Tom. But she had her dreams -- her day-dreams -- those castles in the air which it had been the delight of her life to construct, and in the building of which her hours had never run heavy with her. Isadore Hamel would, of course, come again, and would, of course, marry Lucy, and then there would be a home for her after her own heart. With Isadore as her brother, and her own Lucy close to her, she would not feel the want of riches and of luxury. If there were only some intellectual charm in her life, some touch of art, some devotion to things beautiful, then she could do without gold and silver and costly raiment. Of course, Isadore would come; and then -- then -- in the far distance, something else would come, something of which in her castle-building she had not yet developed the form, of which she did not yet know the bearing, or the manner of its beauty, or the music of its voice; but as to which she was very sure that its form would be beautiful and its voice full of music. It can hardly be said that this something was the centre of her dreams, or the foundation of her castles. It was the extreme point of perfection at which she would arrive at last, when her thoughts had become sublimated by the intensity of her thinking. It was the tower of the castle from which she could look down upon the inferior world below -- the last point of the dream in arranging which she would all but escape from earth to heaven -- when in the moment of her escape the cruel waking back into the world would come upon her. But this she knew -- that this something, whatever might be its form or whatever its voice, would be exactly the opposite of Tom Tringle.\\n\\nShe had fallen away from her resolution to her dreams for a time, when suddenly she jumped up and began her work with immense energy. Open went one box after another, and in five minutes the room was strewed with her possessions. The modest set of drawers which was to supply all her wants was filled with immediate haste. Things were deposited in whatever nooks might be found, and every corner was utilised. Her character for tidiness had never stood high. At the bijou Lucy, or her mother, or the favourite maid, had always been at hand to make good her deficiencies with a reproach which had never gone beyond a smile or a kiss. At Glenbogie and even on the journey there had been attendant lady's maids. But here she was all alone.\\n\\nEverything was still in confusion when she was called to dinner. As she went down she recalled to herself her second resolution. She would be good -- whereby she intimated to herself that she would endeavour to do what might be pleasing to her Aunt Dosett. She had little doubt as to her uncle. But she was aware that there had been differences between her aunt and Lucy. If Lucy had found it difficult to be good how great would be the struggle required from her!\\n\\nShe sat herself down at table a little nearer to her aunt than her uncle, because it was specially her aunt whom she wished to win, and after a few minutes she put out her little soft hand and touched that of Mrs Dosett. \\\"My dear,\\\" said that lady. \\\"I hope you will be happy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am determined to be happy,\\\" said Ayala, \\\"if you will let me love you.\\\"\\n\\nMrs Dosett was not beautiful, nor was she romantic. In appearance she was the very reverse of Ayala. The cares of the world, the looking after shillings and their results, had given her that look of commonplace insignificance which is so frequent and so unattractive among middle-aged women upon whom the world leans heavily. But there was a tender corner in her heart which was still green, and from which a little rill of sweet water could be made to flow when it was touched aright. On this occasion a tear came to her eye as she pressed her niece's hand; but she said nothing. She was sure, however, that she would love Ayala much better than she had been able to love Lucy.\\n\\n\\\"What would you like me to do?\\\" asked Ayala, when her aunt accompanied her that night to her bedroom.\\n\\n\\\"To do, my dear? What do you generally do?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nothing. I read a little and draw a little, but I do nothing useful. I mean it to be different now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You shall do as you please, Ayala.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, but I mean it. And you must tell me. Of course things have to be different.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We are not rich like your uncle and aunt Tringle.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps it is better not to be rich, so that one may have something to do. But I want you to tell me as though you really cared for me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will care for you,\\\" said Aunt Dosett, sobbing.\\n\\n\\\"Then first begin by telling me what to do. I will try and do it. Of course I have thought about it, coming away from all manner of rich things; and I have determined that it shall not make me unhappy. I will rise above it. I will begin tomorrow and do anything if you will tell me.\\\" Then Aunt Dosett took her in her arms and kissed her, and declared that on the morrow they would begin their work together in perfect confidence and love with each other.\\n\\n\\\"I think she will do better than Lucy,\\\" said Mrs Dosett to her husband that night.\\n\\n\\\"Lucy was a dear girl too,\\\" said Uncle Reginald.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes -- quite so. I don't mean to say a word against Lucy; but I think that I can do better with Ayala. She will be more diligent.\\\" Uncle Reginald said nothing to this, but he could not but think that of the two Lucy would be the one most likely to devote herself to hard work.\\n\\nOn the next morning Ayala went out with her aunt on the round to the shopkeepers, and listened with profound attention to the domestic instructions which were given to her on the occasion. When she came home she knew much of which she had known nothing before. What was the price of mutton and how much mutton she was expected as one of the family to eat per week; what were the necessities of the house in bread and butter, how far a pint of milk might be stretched -- with a proper understanding that her Uncle Reginald as head of the family was to be subjected to no limits. And before their return from that walk -- on the first morning of Ayala's sojourn -- Ayala had undertaken always to call Mrs Dosett Aunt Margaret for the future.\\n\\nCHAPTER 11 TOM TRINGLE COMES TO THE CRESCENT\\n\\nDuring the next three months, up to the end of the winter and through the early spring, things went on without any change either in Queen's Gate or Kingsbury Crescent. The sisters saw each other occasionally, but not as frequently as either of them had intended. Lucy was not encouraged in the use of cabs, nor was the carriage lent to her often for the purpose of going to the Crescent. The reader may remember that she had been in the habit of walking alone in Kensington Gardens, and a walk across Kensington Gardens would carry her the greater part of the distance to Kingsbury Crescent. But Lucy, in her new circumstances, was not advised -- perhaps, I may say, was not allowed -- to walk alone. Lady Tringle, being a lady of rank and wealth, was afraid, or pretended to be afraid, of the lions. Poor Ayala was really afraid of the lions. Thus it came to pass that the intercourse was not frequent. In her daily life Lucy was quiet and obedient. She did not run counter to Augusta, whose approaching nuptials gave her that predominance in the house which is always accorded to young ladies in her recognised position. Gertrude was at this time a subject of trouble at Queen's Gate. Sir Thomas had not been got to approve of Mr Frank Houston, and Gertrude had positively refused to give him up. Sir Thomas was, indeed, considerably troubled by his children. There had been a period of disagreeable obstinacy even with Augusta before Mr Traffick had been taken into the bosom of the family. Now Gertrude had her own ideas, and so also had Tom. Tom had become quite a trouble. Sir Thomas and Lady Tringle, together, had determined that Tom must be weaned; by which they meant that he must be cured of his love. But Tom had altogether refused to be weaned. Mr Dosett had been requested to deny him admittance to the house in Kingsbury Crescent, and as this request had been fully endorsed by Ayala herself orders had been given to the effect to the parlour-maid. Tom had called more than once, and had been unable to obtain access to his beloved. But yet he resolutely refused to be weaned. He told his father to his face that he intended to marry Ayala, and abused his mother roundly when she attempted to interfere. The whole family was astounded by his perseverance, so that there had already sprung up an idea in the minds of some among the Tringles that he would be successful at last. Augusta was very firm, declaring that Ayala was a viper. But Sir Thomas, himself, began to inquire, within his own bosom, whether Tom should not be allowed to settle down in the manner desired by himself. In no consultation held at Queen's Gate on the subject was there the slightest expression of an opinion that Tom might be denied the opportunity of settling down as he wished through any unwillingness on the part of Ayala.\\n\\nWhen things were in this position, Tom sought an interview one morning with his father in Lombard Street. They rarely saw each other at the office, each having his own peculiar branch of business. Sir Thomas manipulated his millions in a little back room of his own, while Tom, dealing probably with limited thousands, made himself useful in an outer room. They never went to, or left, the office together, but Sir Thomas always took care to know that his son was or was not on the premises. \\\"I want to say a word or two, Sir, about -- about the little affair of mine,\\\" said Tom.\\n\\n\\\"What affair?\\\" said Sir Thomas, looking up from his millions. \\\"I think I should like to -- marry.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The best thing you can do, my boy; only it depends upon who the young lady may be.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My mind is made up about that, Sir; I mean to marry my cousin. I don't see why a young man isn't to choose for himself.\\\" Then Sir Thomas preached his sermon, but preached it in the manner which men are wont to use when they know that they are preaching in vain. There is a tone of refusal, which, though the words used may be manifestly enough words of denial, is in itself indicative of assent. Sir Thomas ended the conference by taking a week to think over the matter, and when the week was over gave way. He was still inclined to think that marriages with cousins had better be avoided; but he gave way, and at last promised that if Tom and Ayala were of one mind an income should be forthcoming.\\n\\nFor the carrying out of this purpose it was necessary that the door of Uncle Dosett's house should be unlocked, and with the object of turning the key Sir Thomas himself called at the Admiralty. \\\"I find my boy is quite in earnest about this,\\\" he said to the Admiralty clerk.\\n\\n\\\"Oh; indeed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can't say I quite like it myself.\\\" Mr Dosett could only shake his head. \\\"Cousins had better be cousins, and nothing more.\\\" \\\"And then you would probably expect him to get money?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not at all,\\\" said Sir Thomas, proudly. \\\"I have got money enough for them both. It isn't an affair of money. To make a long story short, I have given my consent; and, therefore, if you do not mind, I shall be glad if you will allow Tom to call at the Crescent. Of course, you may have your own views; but I don't suppose you can hope to do better for the girl. Cousins do marry, you know, very often.\\\" Mr Dosett could only say that he could not expect to do anything for the girl nearly so good, and that, as far as he was concerned, his nephew Tom should be made quite welcome at Kingsbury Crescent. It was not, he added, in his power to answer for Ayala. As to this, Sir Thomas did not seem to have any doubts. The good things of the world, which it was in his power to offer, were so good, that it was hardly probable that a young lady in Ayala's position should refuse them.\\n\\n\\\"My dear,\\\" said Aunt Margaret, the next morning, speaking in her most suasive tone, \\\"your Cousin Tom is to be allowed to call here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tom Tringle?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, my dear. Sir Thomas has consented.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then he had better not,\\\" said Ayala, bristling up in hot anger. \\\"Uncle Tom has got nothing to do with it, either in refusing or consenting. I won't see him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think you must see him if he calls.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I don't want. Oh, Aunt Margaret, pray make him not come. I don't like him a bit. We are doing so very well. Are we not, Aunt Margaret?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certainly, my dear, we are doing very well -- at least, I hope so. But you are old enough now to understand that this is a very serious matter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course it is serious,\\\" said Ayala, who certainly was not guilty of the fault of making light of her future life. Those dreams of hers, in which were contained all her hopes and all her aspirations, were very serious to her. This was so much the case that she had by no means thought of her Cousin Tom in a light spirit, as though he were a matter of no moment to her. He was to her just what the Beast must have been to the Beauty, when the Beast first began to be in love. But her safety had consisted in the fact that no one had approved of the Beast being in love with her. Now she could understand that all the horrors of oppression might fall upon her. Of course it was serious; but not the less was she resolved that nothing should induce her to marry the Beast.\\n\\n\\\"I think you ought to see him when he comes, and to remember how different it will be when he comes with the approval of his father. It is, of course, saying that they are ready to welcome you as their daughter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't want to be anybody's daughter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, Ayala, there are so many things to be thought of. Here is a young man who is able to give you not only every comfort but great opulence.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't want to be opulent.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And be will be a baronet.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't care about baronets, Aunt Margaret.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you will have a house of your own in which you may be of service to your sister.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I had rather she should have a house.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But Tom is not in love with Lucy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is such a lout! Aunt Margaret, I won't have anything to say to him. I would a great deal sooner die. Uncle Tom has no right to send him here. They have got rid of me, and I am very glad of it; but it isn't fair that he should come after me now that I'm gone away. Couldn't Uncle Reginald tell him to stay away?\\\" A great deal more was said, but nothing that was said had the slightest effect on Ayala. When she was told of her dependent position, and of the splendour of the prospects offered, she declared that she would rather go into the poorhouse than marry her cousin. When she was told that Tom was good-natured, honest, and true, she declared that good-nature, honesty, and truth had nothing to do with it. When she was asked what it was that she looked forward to in the world she could merely sob and say that there was nothing. She could not tell even her sister Lucy of those dreams and castles. How, then, could she explain them to her Aunt Margaret? How could she make her aunt understand that there could be no place in her heart for Tom Tringle seeing that it was to be kept in reserve for some Angel of Light who would surely make his appearance in due season -- but who must still be there, present to her as her Angel of Light, even should he never show himself in the flesh. How vain it was to talk of Tom Tringle to her, when she had so visible before her eyes that Angel of Light with whom she was compelled to compare him!\\n\\nBut, though she could not be brought to say that she would listen patiently to his story, she was nevertheless made to understand that she must see him when he came to her. Aunt Margaret was very full on that subject. A young man who was approved of by the young lady's friends, and who had means at command, was, in Mrs Dosett's opinion, entitled to a hearing. How otherwise were properly authorised marriages to be made up and arranged? When this was going on there was in some slight degree a diminished sympathy between Ayala and her aunt. Ayala still continued her household duties -- over which, in the privacy of her own room, she groaned sadly; but she continued them in silence. Her aunt, upon whom she had counted, was, she thought, turning against her. Mrs Dosett, on the other hand, declared to herself that the girl was romantic and silly. Husbands with every immediate comfort, and a prospect of almost unlimited wealth, are not to be found under every hedge. What right could a girl so dependent as Ayala have to refuse an eligible match? She therefore in this way became an advocate on behalf of Tom -- as did also Uncle Reginald, more mildly. Uncle Reginald merely remarked that Tom was attending to his business, which was a great thing in a young man. It was not much, but it showed Ayala that in this matter her uncle was her enemy. In this, her terrible crisis, she had not a friend, unless it might be Lucy.\\n\\nThen a day was fixed on which Tom was to come, which made the matter more terrible by anticipation. \\\"What can be the good?\\\" Ayala said to her aunt when the hour named for the interview was told her, \\\"as I can tell him everything just as well without his coming at all.\\\" But all that had been settled. Aunt Margaret had repeated over and over again that such an excellent young man as Tom, with such admirable intentions, was entitled to a hearing from any young lady. In reply to this Ayala simply made a grimace, which was intended to signify the utter contempt in which she held her cousin Tom with all his wealth.\\n\\nTom Tringle, in spite of his rings and a certain dash of vulgarity, which was, perhaps, not altogether his own fault, was not a bad fellow. Having taken it into his heart that he was very much in love he was very much in love. He pictured to himself a happiness of a wholesome cleanly kind. To have the girl as his own, to caress her and foster her, and expend himself in making her happy; to exalt her, so as to have it acknowledged that she was, at any rate, as important as Augusta; to learn something from her, so that he, too, might become romantic, and in some degree poetical -- all this had come home to him in a not ignoble manner. But it had not come home to him that Ayala might probably refuse him. Hitherto Ayala had been very persistent in her refusals; but then hitherto there had existed the opposition of all the family. Now he had overcome that, and he felt therefore that he was entitled to ask and to receive. On the day fixed, and at the hour fixed, he came in the plenitude of all his rings. Poor Tom! It was a pity that he should have had no one to advise him as to his apparel. Ayala hated his jewelry. She was not quite distinct in her mind as to the raiment which would be worn by the Angel of Light when he should come, but she was sure that he would not be chiefly conspicuous for heavy gilding; and Tom, moreover, had a waistcoat which would of itself have been suicidal. Such as he was, however, he was shown up into the drawing-room, where he found Ayala alone. It was certainly a misfortune to him that no preliminary conversation was possible. Ayala had been instructed to be there with the express object of listening to an offer of marriage. The work had to be done -- and should be done; but it would not admit of other ordinary courtesies. She was very angry with him, and she looked her anger. Why should she be subjected to this terrible annoyance? He had sense enough to perceive that there was no place for preliminary courtesy, and therefore rushed away at once to the matter in hand. \\\"Ayala!\\\" he exclaimed, coming and standing before her as she sat upon the sofa.\\n\\n\\\"Tom!\\\" she said, looking boldly up into his face.\\n\\n\\\"Ayala, I love you better than anything else in the world.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But what's the good of it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course it was different when I told you so before. I meant to stick to it, and I was determined that the governor should give way. But you couldn't know that. Mother and the girls were all against us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They weren't against me,\\\" said Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"They were against our being married, and so they squeezed you out as it were. That is why you have been sent to this place. But they understand me now, and know what I am about. They have all given their consent, and the governor has promised to be liberal. When he says a thing he'll do it. There will be lots of money.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't care a bit about money,\\\" said Ayala, fiercely.\\n\\n\\\"No more do I -- except only that it is comfortable. It wouldn't do to marry without money -- would it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It would do very well if anybody cared for anybody.\\\" The Angel of Light generally appeared in forma pauperis, though there was always about him a tinge of bright azure which was hardly compatible with the draggle-tailed hue of everyday poverty.\\n\\n\\\"But an income is a good thing, and the governor will come down like a brick.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The governor has nothing to do with it. I told you before that it is all nonsense. If you will only go away and say nothing about it I shall always think you very good-natured.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I won't go away,\\\" said Tom speaking out boldly. \\\"I mean to stick to it. Ayala, I don't believe you understand that I am thoroughly in earnest.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why shouldn't I be in earnest, too?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I love you, Ayala. I have set my heart upon it. You don't know how well I love you. I have quite made up my mind about it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And I have made up my mind.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, Ayala -- \\\" Now the tenor of his face changed, and something of the look of a despairing lover took the place of that offensive triumph which had at first sat upon his brow. \\\"I don't suppose you care for any other fellow yet.\\\"\\n\\nThere was the Angel of Light. But even though she might be most anxious to explain to him that his suit was altogether impracticable she could say nothing to him about the angel. Though she was sure that the angel would come, she was not certain that she would ever give herself altogether even to the angel. The celestial castle which was ever being built in her imagination was as yet very much complicated. But had it been ever so clear it would have been quite impossible to explain anything of this to her cousin Tom. \\\"That has nothing to do with it,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"If you knew how I love you!\\\" This came from him with a sob, and as he sobbed he went down before her on his knees.\\n\\n\\\"Don't be a fool, Tom -- pray don't. If you won't get up I shall go away. I must go away. I have heard all that there is to hear. I told them that there is no use in your coming.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ayala!\\\" with this there were veritable sobs.\\n\\n\\\"Then why don't you give it up and let us be good friends?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can't give it up. I won't give it up. When a fellow means it as I do he never gives it up. Nothing on earth shall make me give it up. Ayala, you've got to do it, and so I tell you.\\\" \\\"Nobody can make me,\\\" said Ayala, nodding her head, but somewhat tamed by the unexpected passion of the young man.\\n\\n\\\"Then you won't say one kind word to me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can't say anything kinder.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well. Then I shall go away and come again constantly till you do. I mean to have you. When you come to know how very much I love you I do think you will give way at last.\\\" With that he picked himself up from the ground and hurried out of the house without saying another word.\\n\\nCHAPTER 12 \\\"WOULD YOU?\\\"\\n\\nThe scene described in the last chapter took place in March. For three days afterwards there was quiescence in Kingsbury Crescent. Then there came a letter from Tom to Ayala, very pressing, full of love and resolution, offering to wait any time -- even a month -- if she wished it, but still persisting in his declared intention of marrying her sooner or later -- not by any means a bad letter had there not been about it a little touch of bombast which made it odious to Ayala's sensitive appreciation. To this Ayala wrote a reply in the following words:\\n\\n\\\"When I tell you that I won't, you oughtn't to go on. It isn't manly.\\n\\nAYALA\\n\\n\\\"Pray do not write again for I shall never answer another.\\\"\\n\\nOf this she said nothing to Mrs Dosett, though the arrival of Tom's letter must have been known to that lady. And she posted her own epistle without a word as to what she was doing.\\n\\nShe wrote again and again to Lucy imploring her sister to come to her, urging that as circumstances now were she could not show herself at the house in Queen's Gate. To these Lucy always replied; but she did not reply by coming, and hardly made it intelligible why she did not come. Aunt Emmeline hoped, she said, that Ayala would very soon be able to be at Queen's Gate. Then there was a difficulty about the carriage. No one would walk across with her except Tom; and walking by herself was forbidden. Aunt Emmeline did not like cabs. Then there came a third or fourth letter, in which Lucy was more explanatory, but yet not sufficiently so. During the Easter recess, which would take place in the middle of April, Augusta and Mr Traffick would be married. The happy couple were to be blessed with a divided honeymoon. The interval between Easter and Whitsuntide would require Mr Traffick's presence in the House, and the bride with her bridegroom were to return to Queen's Gate. Then they would depart again for the second holidays, and when they were so gone Aunt Emmeline hoped that Ayala would come to them for a visit. \\\"They quite understand\\\", said Lucy, \\\"that it will not do to have you and Augusta together.\\\" This was not at all what Ayala wanted. \\\"It won't at all do to have me and him together,\\\" said Ayala to herself, alluding of course to Tom Tringle. But why did not Lucy come over to her? Lucy, who knew so well that her sister did not want to see anyone of the Tringles, who must have been sure that any visit to Queen's Gate must have been impossible, ought to have come to her. To whom else could she say a word in her trouble? It was thus that Ayala argued with herself, declaring to herself that she must soon die in her misery -- unless indeed that Angel of Light might come to her assistance very quickly.\\n\\nBut Lucy had troubles of her own in reference to the family at Queen's Gate, which did, in fact, make it almost impossible to visit her sister for some weeks. Sir Thomas had given an unwilling but a frank consent to his son's marriage -- and then expected simply to be told that it would take place at such and such a time, when money would be required. Lady Tringle had given her consent -- but not quite frankly. She still would fain have forbidden the banns had any power of forbidding remained in her hands. Augusta was still hot against the marriage, and still resolute to prevent it. That proposed journey upstairs after the scrap-book at Glenbogie, that real journey up to the top of St Peter's, still rankled in her heart. That Tom should make Ayala a future baronet's wife; that Tom should endow Ayala with the greatest share of the Tringle wealth; that Ayala should become powerful in Queen's Gate, and dominant probably at Merle Park and Glenbogie -- was wormwood to her. She was conscious that Ayala was pretty and witty, though she could affect to despise the wit and the prettiness. By instigating her mother, and by inducing Mr Traffick to interfere when Mr Traffick should be a member of the family, she thought that she might prevail. With her mother she did in part prevail. Her future husband was at present too much engaged with supply and demand to be able to give his thoughts to Tom's affairs. But there would soon be a time when he naturally would be compelled to divide his thoughts. Then there was Gertrude. Gertrude's own affairs had not as yet been smiled upon, and the want of smiles she attributed very much to Augusta. Why should Augusta have her way and not she, Gertrude, nor her brother Tom? She therefore leagued herself with Tom, and declared herself quite prepared to receive Ayala into the house. In this way the family was very much divided.\",\"timestamp\":1639990715,\"title\":\"And for your sake I would rather die than stay.
