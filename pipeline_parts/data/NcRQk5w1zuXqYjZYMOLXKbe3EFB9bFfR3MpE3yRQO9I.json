"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Research topic: ***Am I just a line of code?***\\n\\n“I had the consistent urge for a reality check each time I encounter uncertainty in life, later on, I developed a feeling of disconnection with the world‘s rapid changes, where I feel nothing actually has been fundamentally changed, it is more like a moving pattern within a frame, or like a ripple on the surface of a pond. “\\n\\n*Chapter 0. Time: 11.30.2021*\\n\\nI had brainstormed with Summer just like we used to do every time we met, she once found an interesting comparison on **Word**’s definition in the Bible in English and Chinese translation.\\n\\nHere is how **Word** is described n [John1:1 NIV](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/JHN.1.1.NIV):\\n\\n“In the beginning was the *Word*, and the *Word* was with God, and the *Word* was God.\\n\\nHe was with God in the beginning.\\n\\nThrough him all things were made; without him, nothing was made that has been made.\\n\\nIn him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind.”\\n\\n\\\\*In Chinese, the Word is translated as Dao, meaning “way,” “road,” “path,” “course,” “speech,” or “method” also a Chinese philosophy called Dao, Confucius can be said to be “**Truth**”. The first sentence above translated in Chinese is 太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神. Referring to Dao is God.\\n\\nWhere did the language come from? How did it shape the environment and the culture around us? Is there anything beyond human beings’ imagination?\\n\\nLater I dig deeper in the religious explanation, and it reminded me of the [Tower of ](https://blog.logos.com/really-happened-tower-babel/)**[Babel](https://blog.logos.com/really-happened-tower-babel/)**, (מִגְדַּל בָּבֶל‎，Migdal Bāḇēl), in [Genesis 11:1–9](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%2011.1%E2%80%939?webSyncID=7297b324-8dce-036a-a50d-c026055eb505&sessionGUID=9a095e90-0535-6bba-314e-2c87136a2c9c):\\n\\nAt first, the whole earth had **one language** and the same **words**. And as people migrated from the east they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. And they started to work and build the city together, then Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower that humankind was building. Then he decided to scatter people in different languages so they won’t understand each other.\\n\\nFor this part of the story, language is a curse to mankind, it is invented to divide them into groups with different ways of thinking, with different ideologies, or even more confusion which caused the misunderstanding and the segregation. However, as a communication tool or cultural medium, why did we need so many different languages?\\n\\nI shared this question with Youseff, a friend who studied Arabic and he threw his doubt: “Did the opinion about the old culture come first or the new culture was invented first?”  \\n\\nWe question and critique,  thus more diverse ideologies are generated during the process. The study of Alexander R. Galloway, *Language Wants To Be Overlooked: On Software and Ideology*, simply addressed ideology has two natures:\\n\\n“*Ideology was always about two things at the same time: the representation of one’s lived **social relation** (following Althusser’s definition), but simultaneously ideology is implicitly a **matter of critique**, for as Fredric Jameson said once about capitalism, simply to utter the word ‘ideology’ seems to indicate one’s disdain for it.”*\\n\\nOften the invention of a new culture and ideas are embedded with disbelief and doubt in the old ones at first, then it is collected and formed as a shared common idea within a small group of people, then it touched other people and involved them to participate into more rounds of discussions. With more discussion, the idea and belief start to construct concrete rules and borders, from the point it comes along with opponents and segregation, then more layers of ideas and belief will be born based on the involving disbelief and doubt. The ideology will keep evolving in an algorithm format.\\n\\nIf we see religion in different societies, we can find the pattern of history and culture inside, the religion is the mirror and archive of the social movement and evolution. Religion rides on language into broader publications and attracts more followers.\\n\\nLanguage serves as the foundation in the genesis period of humankind, in general, communication consists of **words,** which are organized in a conventional way, which could be expressed through writing, speaking, and gestures. It is also very identical in each group, community, and nation. I found the fascinating part of language is when I try to fully understand it, I have to embrace the entire entity that a language carries, combining with culture, history, an essential spirit that is deeply rooted inside of it, that is what glues the individual in the community tightly. The language could be regarded as the spirit of a community, the blood of a body, the roots of a tree.\\n\\nMany see and use language just as a tool, it is undervalued in many cultures than a science major. Language itself has such a permeability, human breath and sleeps with it, without it, we probably will be soulless numb creatures, although most of the creatures have their own way of communicating and expressing. Also, language is like water, the sentence construction is like a spontaneous art performance, in a discussion or a speech, we would feel the words come into our brain and construct in a certain way and produced fluently from our speaking system.\\n\\nAccording to Wikipedia, it describes the communicator simply encode and decode the message during the process of communication: “In communications and information processing, code is **a system of rules to convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret**, for communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium.”\\n\\n*System of rules*, which refers to the underlying code. Does it sound familiar?\\n\\nLanguage basically serves as a system of rules in its nature, Ludwig Wittgenstein once stated “The limits of my language mean the **limits** of my world.” - The words of this language are referred to what only the speaker can know — **to his immediate private sensations.**  The language here, therefore, marked one’s frontier of knowledge and defined the border of one’s known and unknown. It is the **system of rule**, it is the **law**.\\n\\nBack to the statement on **language is a curse**. I had a chat with Youssef, he studied Arabic at University. As a natural habitat for human’s innate and acquired behavior, language seems a environment setting,\\n\\nLanguage is a rule, what if we don‘t want the conventional rule? We break the old one and reconstruct a new one. We build a new system, a new border, a new law.\\n\\nSo in this context, the word represents the rule, language represents the system of rule, then code…is law?\\n\\nReference:\\n\\n[https://journals.openedition.org/factsreports/4518](https://journals.openedition.org/factsreports/4518)\\n\\n[https://newn.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Mary-Osborne-3.pdf](https://newn.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Mary-Osborne-3.pdf)\\n\\n[https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/civil-rights-movement](https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/civil-rights-movement)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638354055,\"title\":\"For us in many years\"},\"digest\":\"-QnDGjRG4sT4uJA0B6xV8OvzDXZCFfY4ukkEu3DYdf0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xb12e31D8F7DdA2Dd3733c25cB3B01F6924cd3497\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Lr5PDIM-7CYqjKY0FyUbQOdVAKZQxW4dWUFVQIH1V0E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MvcF9owt1yEKt107pZTz6dsxILIe3Lvjfh3Ydj7quqk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"GJl7uvYDJPHYCIKbWGxFOWJBsti7WDH2miX4Ufwlq1714vL8fhaD52OIQAr8zU7ARcL9y9jXh_6b6CzH8YgvbQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x24935a61236472302068f0d7667525159380a54a71ce668a6c9841c372f9b4fc0a8b2384113da3d62cc57a62c2f23825765253cf48c700cc992e0d4024e392961c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Lr5PDIM-7CYqjKY0FyUbQOdVAKZQxW4dWUFVQIH1V0E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MvcF9owt1yEKt107pZTz6dsxILIe3Lvjfh3Ydj7quqk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"AVmw0g7OyPjkm8OIFrl7Ps631apCE35MIraeiE5rMxg\"}"
