"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"mother, who lived even more penuriously than Desroches. Moreau could\\n\\nnot make himself familiar with Oscar as Godeschal could; and perhaps\\n\\nthat sincere friend to young Husson was behind Godeschal in these\\n\\nefforts to initiate the poor youth safely into the mysteries of life.\\n\\nOscar, grown prudent, had come, through contact with others, to see\\n\\nthe extent and the character of the fault he had committed on that\\n\\nluckless journey; but the volume of his repressed fancies and the\\n\\nfollies of youth might still get the better of him. Nevertheless, the\\n\\nmore knowledge he could get of the world and its laws, the better his\\n\\nmind would form itself, and, provided Godeschal never lost sight of\\n\\nhim, Moreau flattered himself that between them they could bring the\\n\\nson of Madame Clapart through in safety.\\n\\n\\\"How is he getting on?\\\" asked the land-agent of Godeschal on his\\n\\nreturn from one of his journeys which had kept him some months out of\\n\\nParis.\\n\\n\\\"Always too much vanity,\\\" replied Godeschal. \\\"You give him fine\\n\\nclothes and fine linen, he wears the shirt-fronts of a stockbroker,\\n\\nand so my dainty coxcomb spends his Sundays in the Tuileries, looking\\n\\nout for adventures. What else can you expect? That's youth. He\\n\\ntorments me to present him to my sister, where he would see a pretty\\n\\nsort of society!--actresses, ballet-dancers, elegant young fops,\\n\\nspendthrifts who are wasting their fortunes! His mind, I'm afraid, is\\n\\nnot fitted for law. He can talk well, though; and if we could make him\\n\\na barrister he might plead cases that were carefully prepared for\\n\\nhim.\\\"\\n\\nIn the month of November, 1825, soon after Oscar Husson had taken\\n\\npossession of his new clerkship, and at the moment when he was about\\n\\nto pass his examination for the licentiate's degree, a new clerk\\n\\narrived to take the place made vacant by Oscar's promotion.\\n\\nThis fourth clerk, named Frederic Marest, intended to enter the\\n\\nmagistracy, and was now in his third year at the law school. He was a\\n\\nfine young man of twenty-three, enriched to the amount of some twelve\\n\\nthousand francs a year by the death of a bachelor uncle, and the son\\n\\nof Madame Marest, widow of the wealthy wood-merchant. This future\\n\\nmagistrate, actuated by a laudable desire to understand his vocation\\n\\nin its smallest details, had put himself in Desroches' office for the\\n\\npurpose of studying legal procedure, and of training himself to take a\\n\\nplace as head-clerk in two years. He hoped to do his \\\"stage\\\" (the\\n\\nperiod between the admission as licentiate and the call to the bar) in\\n\\nParis, in order to be fully prepared for the functions of a post which\\n\\nwould surely not be refused to a rich young man. To see himself, by\\n\\nthe time he was thirty, \\\"procureur du roi\\\" in any court, no matter\\n\\nwhere, was his sole ambition. Though Frederic Marest was cousin-german\\n\\nto Georges Marest, the latter not having told his surname in\\n\\nPierrotin's coucou, Oscar Husson did not connect the present Marest\\n\\nwith the grandson of Czerni-Georges.\\n\\n\\\"Messieurs,\\\" said Godeschal at breakfast time, addressing all the\\n\\nclerks, \\\"I announce to you the arrival of a new jurisconsult; and as\\n\\nhe is rich, rishissime, we will make him, I hope, pay a glorious\\n\\nentrance-fee.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Forward, the book!\\\" cried Oscar, nodding to the youngest clerk, \\\"and\\n\\npray let us be serious.\\\"\\n\\nThe youngest clerk climbed like a squirrel along the shelves which\\n\\nlined the room, until he could reach a register placed on the top\\n\\nshelf, where a thick layer of dust had settled on it.\\n\\n\\\"It is getting colored,\\\" said the little clerk, exhibiting the volume.\\n\\nWe must explain the perennial joke of this book, then much in vogue in\\n\\nlegal offices. In a clerical life where work is the rule, amusement is\\n\\nall the more treasured because it is rare; but, above all, a hoax or a\\n\\npractical joke is enjoyed with delight. This fancy or custom does, to\\n\\na certain extent, explain Georges Marest's behavior in the coucou. The\\n\\ngravest and most gloomy clerk is possessed, at times, with a craving\\n\\nfor fun and quizzing. The instinct with which a set of young clerks\\n\\nwill seize and develop a hoax or a practical joke is really\\n\\nmarvellous. The denizens of a studio and of a lawyer's office are, in\\n\\nthis line, superior to comedians.\\n\\nIn buying a practice without clients, Desroches began, as it were, a\\n\\nnew dynasty. This circumstance made a break in the usages relative to\\n\\nthe reception of new-comers. Moreover, Desroches having taken an\\n\\noffice where legal documents had never yet been scribbled, had bought\\n\\nnew tables, and white boxes edged with blue, also new. His staff was\\n\\nmade up of clerks coming from other officers, without mutual ties, and\\n\\nsurprised, as one may say, to find themselves together. Godeschal, who\\n\\nhad served his apprenticeship under Maitre Derville, was not the sort\\n\\nof clerk to allow the precious tradition of the \\\"welcome\\\" to be lost.\\n\\nThis \\\"welcome\\\" is a breakfast which every neophyte must give to the\\n\\n\\\"ancients\\\" of the office into which he enters.\\n\\nNow, about the time when Oscar came to the office, during the first\\n\\nsix months of Desroches' installation, on a winter evening when the\\n\\nwork had been got through more quickly than usual, and the clerks were\\n\\nwarming themselves before the fire preparatory to departure, it came\\n\\ninto Godeschal's head to construct and compose a Register\\n\\n\\\"architriclino-basochien,\\\" of the utmost antiquity, saved from the\\n\\nfires of the Revolution, and derived through the procureur of the\\n\\nChatelet-Bordin, the immediate predecessor of Sauvaguest, the\\n\\nattorney, from whom Desroches had bought his practice. The work, which\\n\\nwas highly approved by the other clerks, was begun by a search through\\n\\nall the dealers in old paper for a register, made of paper with the\\n\\nmark of the eighteenth century, duly bound in parchment, on which\\n\\nshould be the stamp of an order in council. Having found such a volume\\n\\nit was left about in the dust, on the stove, on the ground, in the\\n\\nkitchen, and even in what the clerks called the \\\"chamber of\\n\\ndeliberations\\\"; and thus it obtained a mouldiness to delight an\\n\\nantiquary, cracks of aged dilapidation, and broken corners that looked\\n\\nas though the rats had gnawed them; also, the gilt edges were\\n\\ntarnished with surprising perfection. As soon as the book was duly\\n\\nprepared, the entries were made. The following extracts will show to\\n\\nthe most obtuse mind the purpose to which the office of Maitre\\n\\nDesroches devoted this register, the first sixty pages of which were\\n\\nfilled with reports of fictitious cases. On the first page appeared as\\n\\nfollows, in the legal spelling of the eighteenth century:--\\n\\nIn the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, so be it.
