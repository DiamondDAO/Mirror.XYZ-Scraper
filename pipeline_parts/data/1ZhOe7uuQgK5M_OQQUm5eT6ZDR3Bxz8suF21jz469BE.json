"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I was thinking lately on ‚Äúreflecting‚Äù on how this year went. I realized that a ton of shit happened this year lmao. thought about writing a short summary on the stuff that happened this year. so, here it is. keep calm, enjoy your falafel and read, maybe:)\\n\\n## first side project ever.\\n\\nAt the beginning of 2021, I found out and joined a magical place called twitter where cool people build dope stuff. after seeing that I was inspired to start smthn on my own (I‚Äôve been tinkering around with code a bit for about a year then).\\n\\ntl;dr. I started to work on a side project, I started working on a newsletter called curiousfounders. ngl, it was extemely bad and cringe. still, I learned a ton of new and cool stuff I didn‚Äôt knew before.\\n\\nafter working on that for a couple of months, I paused working on curiousfounders for some time and started building a startup called [@saywasp](https://tom-grigory.super.site/previous-products/wasp). I was working on this with a couple of frens, was pretty fun in the initial stage, but shit got toxic really quick. learned a lotta stuff about building a prod, working with a team and a lil bit about marketing.\\n\\nafter that I went on a break and came back with a fresh mind. shut down wasp and curiousfounders because I wasn‚Äôt learning anthing anymore from em. wrote a detailed thread on that you can find it [here](https://twitter.com/tomgrigory/status/1434172782628065281).\\n\\n## turning over a leaf and a new start\\n\\nafter working on wasp, I realized that one of my weaknesses was code. so I went all in on relearning it. this period was like hitting refresh for me.\\n\\n* built a couple of mini side projects: [ship.css,](http://shipcss.tomgrigory.com/) [resume buildr](https://tom-grigory.super.site/actively-working-on/rsum-buildr), [jenny](https://tom-grigory.super.site/actively-working-on/jenny-project).\\n* shipped a rad [twitter scheduling tool](https://twitter.com/usedivehq).\\n* explored unity a bit.\\n* worked at [@movingplatform](https://twitter.com/movingplatform), [@usedishhq](https://twitter.com/usedishhq)\\n* got really exited about the web3 stuff and started playing around with it.\\n* gave a small talk [@tinkerhub](https://instagram.com/tinkerhub) on web3 and NFTs. it went pretty well:)\\n* also attend [@NFTkochi](https://twitter.com/NFTkochi) and met a lotta cool ppl\\n\\n![this is me at Tinkerhub's Tinkerday event attempting my first ever ‚Äútalk‚Äù irl.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ruVhMjnzyTjHHc7wncoZn.jpg?height=949&width=1265)\\n\\n### going all in on web 3 and what‚Äôs next.\\n\\nafter exploring stuff in general, I‚Äôm going all into web3 now.\\n\\nmain stuff im working on rn\\n\\n* a solana project in the solana NFT space([@0xtbd6969](https://twitter.com/0xtbd6969) üëÄ). backed by [@superteamDAO](https://superteamDAO).\\n* a dope pfp nft project on solana. sneak peeks and trailer dropping in a couple of weeks (having exams next weekü•≤)\\n* emoji.bio(just a placeholder name tho) - turn ugly wallet address into cute emojis. working on this with [@mudrankgupta](https://twitter.com/@mudrankgupta).\\n* became a part of the dope core team [@hyperscalefund](https://twitter.com/hyperscalefund).\\n* [@blockspaceDAO](https://twitter.com/blockspaceDAO) - an IRL+ URL community for onboarding more indian devs into web3. jamming on this rn with a couple of cool frens([@allen.codes](https://www.instagram.com/allen.codes/), [@donkorah](https://www.instagram.com/don_k_jacob/)). got a ton of dope stuff planned, more sooon:)\\n\\nsome fun experiments and projects in between.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nin short, 2021 was soo damn cool. met a ton of dope ppl, built a lotta cool stuff and had so much fun! hmu on twitter if you would like to talk about web3, nfts or anything. dms open:)\\n\\n**For the love of BUIDLing, wagmi ‚ù§Ô∏è**\",\"timestamp\":1640946951,\"title\":\"2021 wrapped ‚ú®\"},\"digest\":\"MFZ1kuGMSeNY6y463KQfo2FK6rtwJBfEbwjn0rK1ABk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xe7345E6546FAdF08a647015457dcDc982C62BfDc\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"dbr3az7SHq0gsyYRgouzTBEs7GAwdWwU8bF5euA8z0E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xY2-LEdi43deUPWyGVl-_42UKC5PdJJ1GodgKeDCH4o\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"uT9YGoSXra6lA1Y2I_REBIQi50DmDCkUgD7csGINfMzyz_2l9a1gNZWo2DBYQ16r_XvC_F3yzd8PYmzdI8HuNQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xcf26d64744ad27dce4322adf9d12edd3f92fa7cd8c64b7826783aebc36e7b2f530c8bdb09604011fdee9c832d807c80c8acb1455412bc0f0b9a6041bcb2aea581c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"dbr3az7SHq0gsyYRgouzTBEs7GAwdWwU8bF5euA8z0E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xY2-LEdi43deUPWyGVl-_42UKC5PdJJ1GodgKeDCH4o\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"BxmpO05bGHL4WR-AQZOtQHut5V-S9Rzu7lbzEXtPxMU\"}"
