"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"xDai is a cryptocurrency that is pegged to the US Dollar, has super low transaction fees (up to 500 transactions for $.01 xDai), and fast transaction times. The xDai chain is a stable payments EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchain designed for fast and inexpensive transactions.\\n\\n## Why use the xDAI network?\\n\\nxDai exists to support stable payments and digital cash transactions. Whereas Ethereum transaction costs are unpredictable, subject to congestion, and require several tokens (for example Dai + Eth for gas), xDai transactions are fast, very inexpensive, and require a single token (xDai).\\n\\n[https://bridge.xdaichain.com/](https://bridge.xdaichain.com/)\\n\\n## How to Bridge Funds to xDAI\\n\\n1. Go to <https://bridge.xdaichain.com/>. \\n2. Connect your web3 wallet ([MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)) to the Ethereum Mainnet. Once connected, you will see your address populated in the header, and your Dai and xDai balance displayed on the page.\\n3. Enter the amount of Dai you would like to transfer to xDai, and click the Transfer button.\\n4. The web3 wallet window will open with transaction details. Default gas price is fine, if you would like a faster transaction you can increase it. \\n5. Click Submit or Confirm (depending on wallet) to process the transaction.\\n6. Wait for the transaction confirmation (time depends on gas price and network throughput). The transaction is considered finalized after 8 blocks. To check on a pending transaction, click on the transaction in the UI.\\n7. Once the initial transaction is successful, you will see consecutive Transfer Pending notifications.\\n8. Click on View on BlockScout to see details about the transaction. If you scroll down you will see the address (your address where the xDAI was sent), value (amount sent in wei), and transactionHash, which will match the hash from the initial transaction.\",\"timestamp\":1631751462,\"title\":\"Tutorial: Setting up / Bridging Funds on xDai\",\"publication\":\"rabbithole\"},\"digest\":\"AshYSNTFY3DmX9PsTZmJnE_rfh34gznaohVk34KIECA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x57eFCc7607CD2da49D73E8F9C88ed114CbdC5CF7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"d3wVJCQzBAxYOHRzvyaYpdiz6QHOaoHUogMV2goILyI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0MYTtGMLsr5WbwWe__iLASAJhL3sC3AgAIYs9y_LUJo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"mhkDMq1meOFkz64gdKgVGQB1ObHcGxK-UY8K6XV_zmpDahqYlo_Vq9K_lpvWrZlxinv8hY6v9Yv2nNtNXAiPyQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd4e418f9371974babf92101a5a359e6797bd9c8e755fbd5e378836a9b6c2534a56cc025d9f893c535aee3cb5c3dae0746d2868dc23a2f66aebe4a4860c63f1401b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on rabbithole.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"d3wVJCQzBAxYOHRzvyaYpdiz6QHOaoHUogMV2goILyI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0MYTtGMLsr5WbwWe__iLASAJhL3sC3AgAIYs9y_LUJo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Oxs8NXUGG2Gz4FsNmh509tBj5LEzJNvpt_IAYOFRVmg\"}"
