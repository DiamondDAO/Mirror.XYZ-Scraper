So you gave up my niece?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh dear yes, altogether. She didn't come to Merle Park, you know. How was I to say anything to her when you didn't have her there?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why didn't you go away then, instead of remaining under a false pretence? Or why, at any rate, didn't you tell me the truth?\\\" \\\"And what would you have me to do now?\\\" asked Captain Batsby. \\\"Go to the d -- \\\" said Sir Thomas, as he left the room, and went to his daughter's chamber.\\n\\nGertrude had heard that her father was in the house, and endeavoured to hurry herself into her clothes while the interview was going on between him and her father. But she was not yet perfectly arrayed when her father burst into her room. \\\"Oh, papa,\\\" she said, going down on her knees, \\\"you do mean to forgive us?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I mean to do nothing of the kind. I mean to carry you home and have you locked up.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But we may be married!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not with my leave. Why didn't you come and ask if you wanted to get yourselves married? Why didn't you tell me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We were ashamed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What has become of Mr Houston, whom you loved so dearly?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, papa!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And the Captain was so much attached to Ayala!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, papa!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Get up, you stupid girl. Why is it that my children are so much more foolish than other people's? I don't suppose you care for the man in the least.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do, I do. I love him with all my heart.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And as for him -- how can he care for you when it is but the other day he was in love with your cousin?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, papa!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What he wants is my money, of course.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He has got plenty of money, papa.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can understand him, fool as he is. There is something for him to get. He won't get it, but he might think it possible. As for you, I cannot understand you at all. What do you expect? It can't be for love of a hatchet-faced fellow like that, whom you had never seen a fortnight ago.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is more than a month ago, papa.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Frank Houston was, at any rate, a manly-looking fellow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He was a scoundrel,\\\" said Gertrude, now standing up for the first time.\\n\\n\\\"A good-looking fellow was Frank Houston; that at least may be said for him,\\\" continued the father, determined to exasperate his daughter to the utmost. \\\"I had half a mind to give way about him, because he was a manly, outspoken fellow, though he was such an idle dog. If you'd gone off with him, I could have understood it -- and perhaps forgiven it,\\\" he added.\\n\\n\\\"He was a scoundrel!\\\" screamed Gertrude, remembering her ineffectual attempts to make her former lover perform this same journey. \\\"But this fellow! I cannot bring myself to believe that you really care for him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He has a good income of his own, while Houston was little better than a beggar.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm glad of that,\\\" said Sir Thomas, \\\"because there will be something for you to live upon. I can assure you that Captain Batsby will never get a shilling of my money. Now, you had better finish dressing yourself, and come down and eat your dinner with me if you've got any appetite. You will have to go back to Dover by the boat tonight.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"May Ben dine with us?\\\" asked Gertrude, timidly. \\\"Ben may go to the d -- . At any rate he had better not show himself to me again,\\\" said Sir Thomas.\\n\\nThe lovers, however, did get an opportunity of exchanging a few words, during which it was settled between them that as the young lady must undoubtedly obey her father's behests, and return to Dover that night, it would be well for Captain Batsby to remain behind at Ostend. Indeed, he spoke of making a little tour as far as Brussels, in order that he might throw off the melancholy feelings which had been engendered. \\\"You will come to me again, Ben,\\\" she said. Upon this he looked very grave. \\\"You do not mean to say that after all this you will desert me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He has insulted me so horribly!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What does that signify? Of course he is angry. If you could only hear how he has insulted me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He says that you were in love with somebody else not a month since.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So were you, Ben, for the matter of that.\\\" He did, however, before they parted, make her a solemn promise that their engagement should remain an established fact, in spite both of father and mother.\\n\\nGertrude, who had now recovered the effects of her seasickness -- which, however, she would have to encounter again so very quickly -- contrived to eat a hearty dinner with her father. There, however, arose a little trouble. How should she contrive to pack up the clothes which she had brought with her, and which had till lately been mixed with the Captain's garments? She did, however, at last succeed in persuading the chamber-maid to furnish her with a carpet-bag, with which in her custody she arrived safely on the following day at Merle Park.\\n\\nCHAPTER 49 THE NEW FROCK\\n\\nAyala's arrival at Stalham was full of delight to her. There was Nina with all her new-fledged hopes and her perfect assurance in the absolute superiority of Lord George Bideford to any other man either alive or dead. Ayala was quite willing to allow this assurance to pass current, as her Angel of Light was as yet neither alive nor dead. But she was quite certain -- wholly certain -- that when the Angel should come forth he would be superior to Lord George. The first outpourings of all this took place in the carriage as Nina and Ayala were driven from the station to the house, while the Colonel went home alone in a dog-cart. It had been arranged that nothing should be said to Ayala about the Colonel, and in the carriage the Colonel's name was not mentioned. But when they were all in the hall at Stalham, taking off their cloaks and depositing their wraps, standing in front of the large fire, Colonel Stubbs was there. Lady Albury was present also, welcoming her guests, and Sir Harry, who had already come home from hunting, with one or two other men in red coats and top breeches, and a small bevy of ladies who were staying in the house. Lady Albury was anxious to know how her friend had sped with Ayala, but at such a moment no question could be asked. But Ayala's spirits were so high that Lady Albury was at a loss to understand whether the whole thing had been settled by Jonathan with success -- or whether, on the other hand, Ayala was so happy because she had not been troubled by a word of love.\\n\\n\\\"He has behaved so badly, Lady Albury,\\\" said Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"What -- Stubbs?\\\" asked Sir Harry, not quite understanding all the ins and outs of the matter.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Sir Harry. There was an old lady and an old gentleman. They were very funny and he would laugh at them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I deny it,\\\" said the Colonel.\\n\\n\\\"Why shouldn't he laugh at them if they were funny?\\\" asked Lady Albury.\\n\\n\\\"He knew it would make me laugh out loud. I couldn't help myself, but he could be as grave as a judge all the time. So he went on till the old woman scolded me dreadfully.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But the old man took your part,\\\" said the Colonel.\\n\\n\\\"Yes -- he did. He said that I was ornamental.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A decent and truth-speaking old gentleman,\\\" said one of the sportsmen in top boots.\\n\\n\\\"Quite so -- but then the old lady said that I was perverse, and Colonel Stubbs took her part. If you had been there, Lady Albury, you would have thought that he had been in earnest.\\\" \\\"So I was,\\\" said the Colonel.\\n\\nAll this was very pleasant to Ayala. It was a return to the old joyousness when she had first discovered the delight of having such a friend as Colonel Stubbs. Had he flattered her, paid her compliments, been soft and delicate to her -- as a lover might have been -- she would have been troubled in spirit and heavy at heart. But now it seemed as though all that love-making had been an episode which had passed away, and that the old pleasant friendship still remained. As yet, while they were standing there in the hall, there had come no moment for her to feel whether there was anything to regret in this. But certainly there had been comfort in it. She had been able to appear before all her Stalham friends, in the presence even of the man himself, without any of that consciousness which would have oppressed her had he come there simply as her acknowledged lover, and had she come there conscious before all the guests that it was so.\\n\\nThen they sat for a while drinking tea and eating buttered toast in the drawing-room. A supply of buttered toast fully to gratify the wants of three or four men just home from hunting has never yet been created by the resources of any establishment. But the greater marvel is that the buttered toast has never the slightest effect on the dinner which is to follow in an hour or two. During this period the conversation turned chiefly upon hunting -- which is of all subjects the most imperious. It never occurs to a hunting man to suppose that either a lady, or a bishop, or a political economist, can be indifferent to hunting. There is something beyond millinery -- beyond the interests of the church -- beyond the price of wheat -- in that great question whether the hounds did or did not change their fox in Gobblegoose Wood. On the present occasion Sir Harry was quite sure that the hounds did carry their fox through Gobblegoose Wood, whereas Captain Glomax, who had formerly been master of the pack which now obeyed Sir Harry, was perfectly certain that they had got upon another animal, who went away from Gobblegoose as fresh as paint. He pretended even to ridicule Sir Harry for supposing that any fox could have run at that pace up Buddlecombe Hill who had travelled all the way from Stickborough Gorse. To this Sir Harry replied resentfully that the Captain did not know what were the running powers of a dog-fox in March. Then he told various stories of what had been done in this way at this special period of the year. Glomax, however, declared that he knew as much of a fox as any man in England, and that he would eat both the foxes, and the wood, and Sir Harry, and, finally, himself, if the animal which had run up Buddlecombe Hill was the same which they brought with them from Stickborough Gorse into Gobblegoose Wood. So the battle raged, and the ladies no doubt were much interested -- as would have been the bishop had he been there, or the political economist. After this Ayala was taken up into her room, and left to sit there by herself for a while till Lady Albury should send her maid. \\\"My dear,\\\" said Lady Albury, \\\"there is something on the bed which I expect you to wear tonight. I shall be broken-hearted if it doesn't fit you. The frock is a present from Sir Harry; the scarf comes from me. Don't say a word about it. Sir Harry always likes to make presents to young ladies.\\\" Then she hurried out of the room while Ayala was still thanking her. Lady Albury had at first intended to say something about the Colonel as they were sitting together over Ayala's fire, but she had made up her mind against this as soon as she saw their manner towards each other on entering the house. If Ayala had accepted him at a word as they were travelling together, then there would be need of no further interference in the matter. But if not, it would be better that she should hold her peace for the present. Ayala's first instinct was to look at the finery which had been provided for her. It was a light grey silk, almost pearl colour, as to which she thought she had never seen anything so lovely before. She measured the waist with her eye, and knew at once that it would fit her. She threw the gauzy scarf over her shoulders and turned herself round before the large mirror which stood near the fireplace. \\\"Dear Lady Albury!\\\" she exclaimed; \\\"dear Lady Albury!\\\" It was impossible that she should have understood that Lady Albury's affection had been shown to Jonathan Stubbs much rather than to her when those presents were prepared.\\n\\nShe got rid of her travelling dress and her boots, and let down her hair, and seated herself before the fire that she might think of it all in her solitude. Was she or was she not glad -- glad in sober earnest, glad now the moment of her mirth had passed by, the mirth which had made her return to Stalham so easy for her -- was she or was she not glad that this change had come upon the Colonel, this return to his old ways? She had got her friend again, but she had lost her lover. She did not want the lover. She was sure of that. She was still sure that if a lover would come to her who would be in truth acceptable -- such a lover as would enable her to give herself up to him altogether, and submit herself to him as her lord and master -- he must be something different from Jonathan Stubbs. That had been the theory of her life for many months past, a theory on which she had resolved to rely with all her might from the moment in which this man had spoken to her of his love. Would she give way and render up herself and all her dreams simply because the man was one to be liked? She had declared to herself again and again that it should not be so. There should come the Angel of Light or there should come no lover for her. On that very morning as she was packing up her boxes at Kingsbury Crescent she had arranged the words in which, should he speak to her on the subject in the railway train, she would make him understand that it could never be. Surely he would understand if she told him so simply, with a little prayer that his suit might not be repeated. His suit had not been repeated. Nothing apparently had been further from his intention. He had been droll, pleasant, friendly -- just like his old dear self. For in truth the pleasantness and the novelty of his friendship had made him dear to her. He had gone back of his own accord to the old ways, without any little prayer from her. Now was she contented? As the question would thrust itself upon her in opposition to her own will, driving out the thoughts which she would fain have welcomed, she gazed listlessly at the fire. If it were so, then for what purpose, then for what reason, had Lady Albury procured for her the pale grey pearl-coloured dress?\\n\\nAnd why were all these grand people at Stalham so good to her -- to her, a poor little girl, whose ordinary life was devoted to the mending of linen and to the furtherance of economy in the use of pounds of butter and legs of mutton? Why was she taken out of her own sphere and petted in this new luxurious world? She had a knowledge belonging to her -- if not quite what we may call common sense -- which told her that there must be some cause. Of some intellectual capacity, some appreciation of things and words which were divine in their beauty, she was half conscious. It could not be, she felt, that without some such capacity she should have imaged to herself that Angel of Light. But not for such capacity as that had she been made welcome at Stalham. As for her prettiness, her beauty of face and form, she thought about them not at all -- almost not at all. In appearing in that pale-pearl silk, with that gauzy scarf upon her shoulders, she would take pride. Not to be shamed among other girls by the poorness of her apparel was a pride to her. Perhaps to excel some others by the prettiness of her apparel might be a pride to her. But of feminine beauty, as a great gift bestowed upon her, she thought not at all. She would look in the mirror for the effect of the scarf, but not for the effect of the neck and shoulders beneath it. Could she have looked in any mirror for the effect of the dreams she had thus dreamed -- ah! that would have been the mirror in which she would have loved yet feared to look!\\n\\nWhy was Lady Albury so kind to her? Perhaps Lady Albury did not know that Colonel Stubbs had changed his mind. She would know it very soon, and then, maybe, everything would be changed. As she thought of this she longed to put the pearl silk dress aside, and not to wear it as yet -- to put it aside so that it might never be worn by her if circumstances should so require. It was to be hoped that the man had changed his mind -- and to be hoped that Lady Albury would know that he had done so. Then she would soon see whether there was a change. Could she not give a reason why she should not wear the dress this night? As she sat gazing at the fire a tear ran down her cheek. Was it for the dress she would not wear, or for the lover whom she would not love?\\n\\nThe question as to the dress was settled for her very soon. Lady Albury's maid came into the room -- not a chit of a girl without a thought of her own except as to her own grandness in being two steps higher than the kitchen-maid -- but a well-grown, buxom, powerful woman, who had no idea of letting such a young lady as Ayala do anything in the matter of dress but what she told her. When Ayala suggested something as to the next evening in reference to the pale-pearl silk the buxom powerful woman pooh-poohed her down in a moment. What -- after Sir Harry had taken so much trouble about having it made; having actually inquired about it with his own mouth. \\\"Tonight, Miss; you must wear it tonight! My lady would be quite angry!\\\" \\\"My lady not know what you wear! My lady knows what all the ladies wear -- morning, noon, and night.\\\" That little plan of letting the dress lie by till she should know how she should be received after Colonel Stubbs's change of mind had been declared, fell to the ground altogether under the hands of the buxom powerful woman.\\n\\nWhen she went into the drawing-room some of the guests were assembled. Sir Harry and Lady Albury were there, and so was Colonel Stubbs. As she walked in Sir Harry was standing well in front of the fire, in advance of the rug, so as to be almost in the middle of the room. Captain Glomax was there also, and the discussion about the foxes was going on. It had occurred to Ayala that as the dress was a present from Sir Harry she must thank him. So she walked up to him and made a little curtsey just before him. \\\"Am I nice, Sir Harry?\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Upon my word\\\", said Sir Harry, \\\"that is the best spent ten-pound note I ever laid out in my life.\\\" Then he took her by the hand and gently turned her round, so as to look at her and her dress. \\\"I don't know whether I am nice, but you are,\\\" she said, curtseying again. Everybody felt that she had had quite a little triumph as she subsided into a seat close by Lady Albury, who called her. As she seated herself she caught the Colonel's eye, who was looking at her. She fancied that there was a tear in it. Then he turned himself and looked away into the fire.\\n\\n\\\"You have won his heart for ever,\\\" said Lady Albury.\\n\\n\\\"Whose heart?\\\" asked Ayala, in her confusion.\\n\\n\\\"Sir Harry's heart. As for the other, cela va sans dire. You must go on wearing it every night for a week or Sir Harry will want to know why you have left it off. If the woman had made it on you it couldn't have fitted better. Baker' -- Baker was the buxom female -- \\\"said that she knew it was right.You did that very prettily to Sir Harry. Now go up and ask Colonel Stubbs what he thinks of it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Indeed, I won't,\\\" said Ayala. Lady Albury, a few minutes afterwards, when she saw Ayala walking away towards the drawing-room leaning on the Colonel's arm, acknowledged to herself that she did at last understand it. The Colonel had been able to see it all, even without the dress, and she confessed in her mind that the Colonel had eyes with which to see, and ears with which to hear, and a judgment with which to appreciate. \\\"Don't you think that girl very lovely?\\\" she said to Lord Rufford, on whose arm she was leaning.\\n\\n\\\"Something almost more than lovely,\\\" said Lord Rufford, with unwonted enthusiasm.\\n\\nIt was acknowledged now by everybody. \\\"Is it true about Colonel Stubbs and Miss Dormer?\\\" whispered Lady Rufford to her hostess in the drawing-room.\\n\\n\\\"Upon my word, I never inquire into those things,\\\" said Lady Albury. \\\"I suppose he does admire her. Everybody must admire her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh yes;\\\" said Lady Rufford. \\\"She is certainly very pretty. Who is she, Lady Albury?\\\" Lady Rufford had been a Miss Penge, and the Penges were supposed to be direct descendants from Boadicea. \\\"She is Miss Ayala Dormer. Her father was an artist, and her mother was a very handsome woman. When a girl is as beautiful as Miss Dormer, and as clever, it doesn't much signify who she is.\\\" Then the direct descendant from Boadicea withdrew holding an opinion much at variance with that expressed by her hostess. \\\"Who is that young lady who sat next to you?\\\" asked Captain Glomax of Colonel Stubbs, after the ladies had gone.\\n\\n\\\"She is a Miss Ayala Dormer.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did I not see her out hunting with you once or twice early in the season?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You saw her out hunting, no doubt, and I was there. I did not specially bring her. She was staying here, and rode one of Albury's horses.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Take her top and bottom, and all round,\\\" said Captain Glomax, \\\"she is the prettiest little thing I've seen for many a day. When she curtseyed to Sir Harry in the drawing-room I almost thought that I should like to be a marrying man myself.\\\" Stubbs did not carry on the conversation, having felt displeased rather than otherwise by the admiration expressed.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't quite understand before\\\", said Sir Harry to his wife that night, \\\"what it was that made Jonathan so furious about that girl; but I think I see it now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Fine feathers make fine birds,\\\" said his wife, laughing.\\n\\n\\\"Feathers ever so fine,\\\" said Sir Harry, \\\"don't make well-bred birds.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To tell the truth,\\\" said Lady Albury, \\\"I think we shall all have to own that Jonathan has been right.\\\"\\n\\nThis took place upstairs, but before they left the drawing-room Lady Albury whispered a few words to her young friend. \\\"We have had a terrible trouble about you, Ayala.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A trouble about me, Lady Albury? I should be so sorry.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is not exactly your fault -- but we haven't at all known what to do with that unfortunate man.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What man?\\\" asked Ayala, forgetful at the moment of all men except Colonel Stubbs.\\n\\n\\\"You naughty girl! Don't you know that my brother-in-law is broken-hearted about you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Captain Batsby!\\\" whispered Ayala, in her faintest voice.\\n\\n\\\"Yes; Captain Batsby. A Captain has as much right to be considered as a Colonel in such a matter as this.\\\" Here Ayala frowned, but said nothing. \\\"Of course, I can't help it, who may break his heart, but poor Ben is always supposed to be at Stalham just at this time of the year, and now I have been obliged to tell him one fib upon another to keep him away. When he comes to know it all, what on earth will he say to me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am sure it has not been my fault,\\\" said Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"That's what young ladies always say when gentlemen break their hearts.\\\"\\n\\nWhen Ayala was again in her room, and had got rid of the buxom female who came to assist her in taking off her new finery, she was aware of having passed the evening triumphantly. She was conscious of admiration. She knew that Sir Harry had been pleased by her appearance. She was sure that Lady Albury was satisfied with her, and she had seen something in the Colonel's glance that made her feel that he had not been indifferent. But in their conversation at the dinner table he had said nothing which any other man might not have said, if any other man could have made himself as agreeable. Those hunting days were all again described with their various incidents, with the great triumph over the brook, and Twentyman's wife and baby, and fat Lord Rufford, who was at the moment sitting there opposite to them; and the ball in London, with the lady who was thrown out of the window; and the old gentleman and the old lady of today who had been so peculiar in their remarks. There had been nothing else in their conversation, and it surely was not possible that a man who intended to put himself forward as a lover should have talked in such fashion as that! But then there were other things which occurred to her. Why had there been that tear in his eye? And that \\\"cela va sans dire\\\" which had come from Lady Albury in her railing mood -- what had that meant? Lady Albury, when she said that, could not have known that the Colonel had changed his purpose.\\n\\nBut, after all, what is a dress, let it be ever so pretty? The Angel of Light would not care for her dress, let her wear what she might. Were he to seek her because of her dress, he would not be the Angel of Light of whom she had dreamed. It was not by any dress that she could prevail over him. She did rejoice because of her little triumph -- but she knew that she rejoiced because she was not an Angel of Light herself. Her only chance lay in this, that the angels of yore did come down from heaven to ask for love and worship from the daughters of men.\\n\\nAs she went to bed, she determined that she would still be true to her dream. Not because folk admired a new frock would she be ready to give herself to a man who was only a man -- a man of the earth really; who had about him no more than a few of the real attributes of an Angel of Light.\\n\\nCHAPTER 50 GOBBLEGOOSE WOOD ON SUNDAY\\n\\nThe next two days were not quite so triumphant to Ayala as had been the evening of her arrival.\\n\\nThere was hunting on both of those days, the gentlemen having gone on the Friday away out of Sir Harry's country to the Brake hounds. Ayala and the Colonel had arrived on the Thursday. Ayala had not expected to be asked to hunt again -- had not even thought about it. It had been arranged before on Nina's account, and Nina now was not to hunt any more. Lord George did not altogether approve of it, and Nina was quite in accord with Lord George -- though she had held up her whip and shaken it in triumph when she jumped over the Cranbury Brook. And the horse which Ayala had ridden was no longer in the stables. \\\"My dear, I am so sorry; but I'm afraid we can't mount you,\\\" Lady Albury said. In answer to this Ayala declared that she had not thought of it for a moment. But yet the days seemed to be dull with her. Lady Rufford was -- well -- perhaps a little patronising to her, and patronage such as that was not at all to Ayala's taste. \\\"Lady Albury seems to be quite a kind friend to you,\\\" Lady Rufford said. Nothing could be more true. The idea implied was true also -- the idea that such a one as Ayala was much in luck's way to find such a friend as Lady Albury. It was true no doubt; but, nevertheless, it was ungracious, and had to be resented. \\\"A very kind friend, indeed. Some people only make friends of those who are as grand as themselves.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am sure we should be very glad to see you at Rufford if you remain long in the country,\\\" said Lady Rufford, a little time afterwards. But even in this there was not a touch of that cordiality which might have won Ayala's heart. \\\"I am not at all likely to stay,\\\" said Ayala. \\\"I live with my uncle and aunt at Notting Hill, and I very rarely go away from home.\\\" Lady Rufford, however, did not quite understand it. It had been whispered to her that morning that Ayala was certainly going to marry Colonel Stubbs; and, if so, why should she not come to Rufford?\\n\\nOn that day, the Friday, she was taken in to dinner by Captain Glomax. \\\"I remember quite as if it were yesterday,\\\" said the Captain. \\\"It was the day we rode the Cranbury Brook.\\\"\\n\\nAyala looked up into his face, also remembering everything as well as it were yesterday. \\\"Mr Twentyman rode over it,\\\" she said, \\\"and Colonel Stubbs rode into it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes; Stubbs got a ducking; so he did.\\\" The Captain had not got a ducking, but then he had gone round by the road. \\\"It was a good run that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I thought so.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We haven't been lucky since Sir Harry has had the hounds somehow. There doesn't seem to be the dash about 'em there used to be when I was here. I had them before Sir Harry, you know.\\\" All this was nearly in a whisper.\\n\\n\\\"Were you Master?\\\" asked Ayala, with a tone of surprise which was not altogether pleasing to the Captain.\\n\\n\\\"Indeed I was, but the fag of it was too great, and the thanks too small, so I gave it up. They used to get four days a week out of me.\\\" During the two years that the Captain had had the hounds, there had been, no doubt, two or three weeks in which he had hunted four days.\\n\\nAyala liked hunting, but she did not care much for Captain Glomax, who, having seen her once or twice on horseback, would talk to her about nothing else. A little away on the other side of the table Nina was sitting next to Colonel Stubbs, and she could hear their voices and almost their words. Nina and Jonathan were first cousins, and, of course, could be happy together without giving her any cause for jealousy -- but she almost envied Nina. Yet she had hoped that it might not fall to her lot to be taken out again that evening by the Colonel. Hitherto she had not even spoken to him during the day. They had started to the meet very early, and the gentlemen had almost finished their breakfast before she had come down. If there had been any fault it was her fault, but yet she almost felt that there was something of a disruption between them. It was so evident to her that he was perfectly happy whilst he was talking to Nina.\\n\\nAfter dinner it seemed to be very late before the men came into the drawing-room, and then they were still engaged upon that weary talk about hunting, till Lady Rufford, in order to put a stop to it, offered to sing. \\\"I always do\\\", she said, \\\"if Rufford ventures to name a fox in the drawing-room after dinner.\\\" She did sing, and Ayala thought that the singing was more weary than the talk about hunting.\\n\\nWhile this was going on, the Colonel had got himself shut up in a corner of the room. Lady Albury had first taken him there, and afterwards he had been hemmed in when Lady Rufford sat down to the piano. Ayala had hardly ventured even to glance at him, but yet she knew all that he did, and heard almost every word that he spoke. The words were not many, but still when he did speak his voice was cheerful. Nina now and again had run up to him, and Lady Rufford had asked him some questions about the music. But why didn't he come and speak to her? thought Ayala. Though all that nonsense about love was over, still he ought not to have allowed a day to pass at Stalham without speaking to her. He was the oldest friend there in that house except Nina. It was indeed no more than nine months since she had first seen him, but still it seemed to her that he was an old friend. She did feel, as she endeavoured to answer the questions that Lord Rufford was asking her, that Jonathan Stubbs was treating her unkindly.\\n\\nThen came the moment in which Lady Albury marshalled her guests out of the room towards their chambers. \\\"Have you found yourself dull without the hunting?\\\" the Colonel said to Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"Oh dear no; I must have a dull time if I do, seeing that I have only hunted three days in my life.\\\" There was something in the tone of her voice which, as she herself was aware, almost expressed dissatisfaction. And yet not for worlds would she have shown herself to be dissatisfied with him could she have helped it. \\\"I thought that perhaps you might have regretted the little pony,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Because a thing has been very pleasant, it should not be regretted because it cannot be had always.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To me a thing may become so pleasant, that unless I can have it always my life must be one long regret.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The pony is not quite like that,\\\" said Ayala, smiling as she followed the other ladies out of the room.\\n\\nOn the next morning the meet was nearer, and some of the ladies were taken there in an open carriage. Lady Rufford went, and Mrs Gosling, and Nina and Ayala. \\\"Of course there is a place for you,\\\" Lady Albury had said to her. \\\"Had I wanted to go I would have made Sir Harry send the drag; but I've got to stop at home and see that the buttered toast is ready by the time the gentlemen all come back.\\\" The morning was almost warm, so that the sportsmen were saying evil things of violets and primroses, as is the wont of sportsmen on such occasions, and at the meet the ladies got out of the carriage and walked about among the hounds, making civil speeches to old Tony. \\\"No, my lady,\\\" said Tony, \\\"I don't like these sunshiny mornings at all; there ain't no kind of scent, and I goes riding about these big woods, up and down, till my shirt is as wet on my back with the sweat as though I'd been pulled through the river.\\\" Then Lady Rufford walked away and did not ask Tony any more questions.\\n\\nAyala was patting one of the hounds when the Colonel, who had given his horse to a groom, came and joined her. \\\"If you don't regret that pony,\\\" said he, \\\"somebody else does.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do regret him in one way, of course. I did like it very much; but I don't think it nice, when much has been done for me, to say that I want to have more done.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course I knew what you meant.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps you would go and tell Sir Harry and then he would think me very ungrateful.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ayala,\\\" he said, \\\"I will never say anything of you that will make anybody think evil of you. But, between ourselves, as Sir Harry is not here, I suppose I may confess that I regret the pony.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should like it, of course,\\\" whispered Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"And so should I -- so much! I suppose all these men here would think me an ass if they knew how little I care about the day's work -- whether we find, or whether we run, or whether we kill -- just because the pony is not here. If the pony were here I should have that feeling of expectation of joy, which is so common to girls when some much-thought-of ball or promised pleasure is just before them.\\\" Then Tony went off with his hounds, and Jonathan, mounting his horse, followed with the ruck.\\n\\nAyala knew very well what the pony meant, as spoken of by the Colonel. When he declared that he regretted the pony, it was because the pony might have carried herself. He had meant her to understand that the much-thought-of ball or promised pleasure would have been the delight of again riding with herself. And then he had again called her Ayala. She could remember well every occasion on which he had addressed her by her Christian name. It had been but seldom. Once, however, it had occurred in the full flow of their early intimacy, before that love-making had been begun. It had struck her as being almost wrong, but still as very pleasant. If it might be made right by some feeling of brotherly friendship, how pleasant would it be! And now she would like it again, if only it might be taken as a sign of friendship rather than of love. It never occurred to her to be angry as she would have been angry with any other man. How she would have looked at Captain Batsby had he dared to call her Ayala! Colonel Stubbs should call her Ayala as long as he pleased -- if it were done only in friendship.\\n\\nAfter that they were driven about for a while, seeing what Tony did with the hounds, as tidings came to them now and again that one fox had broken this way and another had gone the other. But Ayala, through it all, could not interest herself about the foxes. She was thinking only of Jonathan Stubbs. She knew that she was pleased because he had spoken to her, and had said kind, pleasant words to her. She knew that she had been displeased while he had sat apart from her, talking to others. But yet she could not explain to herself why she had been either pleased or displeased. She feared that there was more than friendship -- than mere friendship, in that declaration of his that he did in truth regret the pony. His voice had been, oh, so sweet as he had said it! Something told her that men do not speak in mere friendship after that fashion. Not even in the softness of friendship between a man and a woman will the man's voice become as musical as that! Young as she was, child as she was, there was an instinct in her breast which declared to her that it was so. But then, if it were so, was not everything again wrong with her? If it were so, then must that condition of things be coming back which it had been, and still was, her firm resolve to avoid. And yet, as the carriage was being driven about, and as the frequent exclamations came that the fox had traversed this way or that, her pride was gratified and she was happy.\\n\\n\\\"What was Colonel Stubbs saying to you?\\\" asked Nina, when they were at home at the house after lunch.\\n\\n\\\"He was talking about the dear pony which I used to ride.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"About nothing else?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No -- about nothing else.\\\" This Ayala said with a short, dry manner of utterance which she would assume when she was determined not to have a subject carried on.\\n\\n\\\"Ayala, why do you not tell me everything? I told you everything as soon as it happened.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nothing has happened.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know he asked you,\\\" said Nina.\\n\\n\\\"And I answered him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is that to be everything?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes -- that is to be everything,\\\" said Ayala, with a short, dry manner of utterance. It was so plain, that even Nina could not pursue the subject.\\n\\nThere was nothing done on that day in the way of sport. Glomax\\n\\nthought that Tony had been idle, and had made a holiday of the day from the first. But Sir Harry declared that there had not been a yard of scent. The buttered toast, however, was eaten, and the regular sporting conversation was carried on. Ayala, however, was not there to hear it. Ayala was in her own room dreaming.\\n\\nShe was taken in to dinner by a curate in the neighbourhood -- to whom she endeavoured to make herself very pleasant, while the Colonel sat at her other side. The curate had a good deal to say as to lawn tennis. If the weather remained as it was, it was thought that they could all play lawn tennis on the Tuesday -- when there would be no hunting. The curate was a pleasant young fellow, and Ayala devoted herself to him and to their joint hopes for next Tuesday. Colonel Stubbs never once attempted to interfere with the curate's opportunity. There was Lady Rufford on the other side of him, and to Lady Rufford he said all that he did say during dinner. At one period of the repast she was more than generally lively, because she felt herself called upon to warn her husband that an attack of the gout was imminent, and would be certainly produced instantaneously if he could not deny himself the delight of a certain dish which was going the round of the table. His lordship smiled and denied himself -- thinking, as he did so, whether another wife, plus the gout, would or would not have been better for him. All this either amused Colonel Stubbs sufficiently, or else made him so thoughtful, that he made no attempt to interfere with the curate. In the evening there was again music -- which resulted in a declaration made upstairs by Sir Harry to his wife that that wife of Rufford's was a confounded bore. \\\"We all knew that, my dear, as soon as he married her,\\\" said Lady Albury.\\n\\n\\\"Why did he marry a bore?\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1639991544,\"title\":\"When I found how very superior a person your daughter was!\\\" \\\"It isn't a month since she was engaged to somebody else\"},\"digest\":\"cToGpVO3LzFD-B_yfosnTY6SfUwpzlmGgmie44BjAhE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD2dD0Fd14351C19d159B581881AE68fAD5390A5a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"APKhb5sXpAUjD9s5c35b08dBMkzt1qDmqF5Cv611lHc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"00US9jEBNyuCJm9neJGaQx0popTAxMPJq2iC-uipkrY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"9KDSC9HM3jyujwKHTGNd2h8tVoNoBq2eNTU9XUsPeGslCzxWxVR0rdC883GgvkEg6_G-gW0lkrkghM81haQT_A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xcf874bf433587681afacb463c630cad9164a498701ea930ea2ea15069d61e728051621d6830ad4327a76614d3168325265ccd9218f452fdd95482e474ebe0e8a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"APKhb5sXpAUjD9s5c35b08dBMkzt1qDmqF5Cv611lHc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"00US9jEBNyuCJm9neJGaQx0popTAxMPJq2iC-uipkrY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"cToGpVO3LzFD-B_yfosnTY6SfUwpzlmGgmie44BjAhE\"}"
