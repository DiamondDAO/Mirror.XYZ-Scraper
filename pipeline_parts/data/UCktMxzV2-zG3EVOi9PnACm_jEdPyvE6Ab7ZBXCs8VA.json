"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"On the first day of 2020, shops were forced to close, and many businesses in Shandong jointly reported Meituan.\\n\\nRecently, it was reported that the number of Meituan's daily users reached 69.8586 million. Meanwhile, media reported that the growth rate of active users in 2019 will be more than 50%, almost three times that of Meituan.\\n\\nThe takeout market at the beginning of the year is full of smoke.\\n\\n1. Behind the traffic\\n\\nIn the eyes of ordinary netizens, these platform operation indicators of daily active users and active user growth may be some data. However, for enterprises, they can be an important \\\"factor\\\" that can affect the stock market, or an important tool that can create data prosperity, affect the upstream and downstream of the industrial chain. It can form a competitive advantage.\\n\\nAfter understanding the important value of the platform's business indicators of daily active users and active user growth to the platform side, then let's take a look at the current takeout market.\\n\\nAs always, the beginning of the year is the time for many takeout businesses and platforms to renew their contracts. There are some considerations for takeout businesses and platform renewal, such as commission ratio, order profit, new user growth, platform subsidy, platform friendliness, etc. New takeout merchants will be influenced by old takeout merchants, and most of them will act together according to the choice of the olds.\\n\\nTherefore, the essence of the platform's emphasis on its own traffic advantage is to use traffic to influence the judgment of merchants and increase bargaining chips. In this way, some merchants may accept the unreasonable cooperation conditions of the platforms.\\n\\n1. Meituan's DAU\\n\\nAlthough a publicity stunt of Meituan's DAU can improve its attention, it is not easy for Meituan to grasp businesses' heart.\\n\\nFor Meituan merchants, 2019 is a pretty tough time. At the beginning of 2019, CCTV economic news channel economic information broadcast reported that many businesses had withdrew from Meituan. According to CCTV economic news, the real reason for the withdrawal of businesses is the rising commission. When the businesses first cooperated with Meituan, the commission was 15%, later it adjusted to 18%, and 22%. That is to say, every 100 yuan sold requires 22 yuan for the platform. The high commission gives the businesses a lot of pressure. Some reported that in some parts of the country, the number of commission by Meituan has even reached 26%.\\n\\nSince listing, whether it can make profits has become the primary task of Meituan. However, the \\\"high differential fine\\\" exposed in the \\\"delivery man stabbed a supermarket employee\\\" incident also reflects Meituan's desire for profit. The main way to realize the profit of Meituan's takeout business lies in commission from the merchants.\\n\\nAccording to the third quarter of 2019 financial report released by Meituan, the catering takeout business amounted to 15.576 billion yuan, with a daily catering takeout revenue of nearly 200 million yuan.\\n\\nIf Meituan wants to keep its leading position in the takeout market, it needs to do the two things. First, it needs to improve its revenue, which can prove its business profitability to the market. Second, it needs to attract more merchants to sign an \\\"exclusive\\\" contract, so as to build its own barrier.\\n\\nAccording to the reports, on the first day of 2020, several merchants in Zhangqiu University Town, Zhangqiu District, Jinan City, Shandong Province jointly disclosed that Meituan took advantage of its market advantages, forced merchants to sign an \\\"exclusive\\\" contract. And it did not allow other takeout platforms to enter this market. So it took some measures to stop other platforms' entry such as reducing the scope of distribution, closing stores, the expiration and downline of store contracts. In the end, their shop was forced to close on the first day of 2020 because they did not agree with the exclusive request of Meituan.\\n\\nSince the beginning of 2019, many merchants have begun to escape from Meituan. After a year, this situation seems to be increasing. Also from the third quarter financial report, Meituan's business growth rate is 0 compared with its second quarter. The number of businesses has stagnated and may even decline.\\n\\nIt has become a top priority for Meituan to continuously improve the commission and maintain the cooperative relationship with merchants. At this time, it can be regarded as another marketing method of Meituan.\\n\\n1. Is Meituan at a loss?\\n\\nTraffic is the only reason for merchants to cooperate with Meituan at present. But the merchants are more and more resistant to Meituan because of the rising commission and unreasonable terms. Many merchants are trying to get rid of Meituan's control and cooperate with [Ele.me](http://Ele.me).\\n\\nToday, the traffic era is already out of date for local life service market. While pursuing orders, businesses also hope to reduce costs, increase efficiency and direct business decisions through digital transformation.\\n\\nAs for digital transformation of empowering businesses, Meituan's disadvantage is very obvious. Its weakness lies in its main business is too dependent on food and beverage takeout. Accordingly, its digital transformation also has limitations. It should know that the local life service market is far larger than the food takeout market.\\n\\nIn addition to traffic, Meituan is still at an early stage in digital capabilities such as operation, finance, marketing, etc. The digital tools available to merchants are only limited to the primary services such as checkout counter and takeout service. Therefore, those factors also cause that many dining magnates to be unable to launch the deep cooperation with it. Luckin Coffee is a typical example.\\n\\nAccording to Jiemian's report, as of May 2019, after five months of cooperation with Meituan, Luckin Coffee only got 500 orders through Meituan app in one month. As we have seen, the cooperation has a poor effect.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Starbucks has opened its takeout business to more than 2000 stores in 35 cities across the country one year after cooperation with Meituan's competitors [Ele.me](http://Ele.me). According to the Q3 financial report of Starbucks in 2019, takeout sales in China have accounted for 6% of the total sales, while the number of stores has increased by 16%.\\n\\nNot only Starbucks, according to the reports, KFC, McDonald's, Burger King, Haidilao Hotpot and other big catering giants have launched in-depth cooperation with [Ele.me](http://Ele.me). However, in the Hypermarket field, the top brands have joined the [Ele.me](http://Ele.me) camp. In the past two years of integrating into Alibaba's ecosystem, [Ele.me](http://Ele.me) has integrated the service capabilities of local living merchants with Alibaba's economy. It also built a set of merchant digital solutions from payment, big data, marketing, operation and other dimensions.\\n\\nTherefore, it is the source of Meituan's anxiety. In the face of the fierce digital competition stage, Meituan actually knows its own shortcomings, and also understands that the gap cannot be measured by a day or a month. The traffic advantage has become the most important chip of Meituan. And at the same time, [Ele.me](http://Ele.me) is entering the super platform of Alibaba. So Meituan's traffic advantage will no longer be prominent.\\n\\nIn the new year, the competition in the takeout market will continue. After the changes in recent years, businesses have gradually awakened from the pursuit of traffic. They gradually attach importance to the incubation and cultivation ability of the platform. The unequal cooperation between the platform and the merchants formed by traffic advantage will become history.\\n\\nXiaojing believes that Meituan should concentrate on how to change its service and improve the merchants' favor. Blindly pursuing traffic will only make merchants far away.\\n\\nThis is an article from Sohu, translated by Chris Yuan.\",\"timestamp\":1641525340,\"title\":\"Meituanâ€™s traffic advantage is out of date in 2020, what should it do?\"},\"digest\":\"EiRxHBrKBMps61oNJrAOhoNq7twZtxBicc45RxIQNdc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x021D29dC0d2DfC3137253fCb9fE56c6BD1d8a225\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JYZDbC55KuWwe2OC6cJhOu8Ak4BlV06YqJ3cLf4IXA8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"EISdO5a5-8cZsq1MjXo7j4mPetZnqTIVk8VXgO6YY2w\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"IRZG5wobRHcZBInw53w-GtRznADVLKDm7muRO5adX2ByG27jzsUbRtYLwm0nN8H2G30ilikNy7Wui5jlMyph9g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8a5e280c109f2e0b82e94a5ebd8036a14a846924a0ed240d64d91c5724ca6e080811f2c079b4bc53a0fdad0c4e0905ac6a7dbad2e4da00a9f4619a04abb15f4b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JYZDbC55KuWwe2OC6cJhOu8Ak4BlV06YqJ3cLf4IXA8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"EISdO5a5-8cZsq1MjXo7j4mPetZnqTIVk8VXgO6YY2w\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"EiRxHBrKBMps61oNJrAOhoNq7twZtxBicc45RxIQNdc\"}"
