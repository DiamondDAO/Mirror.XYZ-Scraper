I know it can seem unfair when you feel like you've put in all the effort in the world and not getting the reward you want. But sometimes you also have to know how to take a step back and be patient\\n\\n*Itâ€™s neither a race or a marathon*\\n\\nIf you get stuck on getting a role, move on and come back later. You might have a great idea while you sleep to get the part. In other cases, the situation will resolve itself without you having to act.\\n\\n**Appreciate the road traveled**\\n\\nDo not stay all day in front of the computer (even if on concave is great). will get some fresh air and sun at least once a day. Try to have regular physical activity: dopamine is good for your morale. `#The-Wellness` center is full of ideas if you don't know where to start.\\n\\nIn addition, other minors are there to support you and help you progress. We are not in a system of competition but of **co-optation**. On Concave we encourage mutual aid and that's great. You just have to see what we managed to accomplish in such a short time.\\n\\n*Be an actor in the Concave project*\\n\\nIf you find that too much is being asked of you, don't hesitate to say hello. There will always be someone to take over on a task that you cannot complete. **WAGMI** !!!\\n\\nLikewise, if you have a family emergency or other emergency, do not blame your minor brothers and sisters.\\n\\nDon't compare yourself to the others who look super strong with their 500 roles. But don't hesitate to take inspiration from them if you think they've created something interesting. If so, **you'll learn a lot of things while having fun**!\\n\\n**Take care of yourself above all**\\n\\nNot easy to follow when you are on a discord of more than 30,000 people that is evolving at high speed. There are people from all over the world who publish at all hours of the day.\\n\\nGo to what makes you feel good, what brings you joy first. Are you passionate about music? Have fun making your most beautiful pieces for concave. Do you like making others laugh with your jokes? Give us some hilarious memes about your day on concave.\\n\\n*Show a good spirit*\\n\\nIgnore the trolls and heated debates. They will waste your time and the moderators are there to keep an eye on the grain. Better show them the right attitude to adopt by having **exemplary behavior**.\\n\\nDo not hesitate to switch to the `#COMMUNITY-HUB` discussion channels where the atmosphere is relaxed. And of course come see us on the `#French-chat` we are here to help you! Believe me you are going to have a great time and have a good laugh.\\n\\n** \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n **\",\"timestamp\":1638646409,\"title\":\"Take care of yourself on Concave\"},\"digest\":\"EYB7SsMdN2eRMvAQ9zkonc3pwiW0Ycf1ZtnZQJ0OJFM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x737254A9C2c1143c9417eA7899a31fB477FEE92a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NqmzooJsQi4PoVvibMbBceDq7YzuAe5Mf2eqLnwbf90\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"BKccONdNfkOOX6l-pKDC0zk4HJzOecpCV5GIfhT-gL0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"oKzOuKSTCuQGar4H_DuMBsQfv4e4BSwoSTq9V0GymUqKlGz55aJJpsIqCz9Zdnb65u0LV-5fik6-DbSLRPcJAg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd2c6571b3233ff33e1bdab8cfc14da69b2296aa6fd1082f27059e5c440e80d4e282cf8cbeb030a16b31ef768777a7d1adfcd72bd38c39ce4e8a239477a9794e31c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NqmzooJsQi4PoVvibMbBceDq7YzuAe5Mf2eqLnwbf90\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"BKccONdNfkOOX6l-pKDC0zk4HJzOecpCV5GIfhT-gL0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"EYB7SsMdN2eRMvAQ9zkonc3pwiW0Ycf1ZtnZQJ0OJFM\"}"
