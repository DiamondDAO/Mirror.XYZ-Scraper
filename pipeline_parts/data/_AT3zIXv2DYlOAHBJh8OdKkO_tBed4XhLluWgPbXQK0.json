We have improved the product, added new integrations, scaled our team with great talents, and grown the community tremendously. Our mission is more ambitious than ever: we want to become the default tool for data collection and computation for all Web3 projects.\\n\\nTo achieve this ambitious goal, we are proud to announce that we have closed our second fundraising, led by [Permanent Ventures](http://permanent.ventures/) and [Hypersphere Ventures](https://www.hypersphere.ventures/), as well as outstanding crypto funds and networks such as [Volt Capital](https://www.volt.capital/), [Mechanism Capital](https://www.mechanism.capital/), [Coinbase Ventures](https://ventures.coinbase.com/), [Distributed Global](http://www.distributedglobal.com/), [4SV](https://www.4sv.io/), [Compute Ventures](https://compute.ventures/), [Zee Prime](https://zeeprime.capital/), [CMS Holding](http://cmsholdings.io/), [Ternary Capital](https://www.ternary.capital/), [Flori Ventures](https://www.floriventures.com/) ([Celo](https://celo.org/)’s venture arm), [Mina Foundation](https://minaprotocol.com/), [Octopus Network](https://oct.network/), [Composable Finance](https://www.composable.finance/) and a group of notable angel investors including [Justin Kan](https://twitter.com/justinkan) (founder of Twitch), [Robin Chan](https://twitter.com/robinchan), [Santiago Roel Santos](https://twitter.com/santiagoroel), [John Scianna](https://twitter.com/john_scianna) from [Nifty’s](https://niftys.com/), Ganesh and Erik from [Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/) and Alex Shevchenko from [Aurora](https://aurora.dev/). In addition, we received a grant from the [Moonbeam Foundation](https://moonbeam.foundation/).\\n\\nThe whole team is more focused than ever on making this project a success.\\n\\n## What is coming up next?\\n\\n## Additional Integrations & Features\\n\\nIn the coming months, we plan to iterate over the protocol to improve KYVE. We recently launched a private ambassador/beta-tester program to get better feedback from the community and deliver the features it needs. As we want to become the default tool for data collection and computation, we hope to convince more and more web3 projects to integrate with us.\\n\\n## Incentivized Testnet\\n\\nWe have been improving our website and protocol for the last months, which will be released soon. After the release, we aim to kick off an incentivized testnet, gather more feedback from the community, and reward the members who have helped us since day one.\\n\\n## Recruiting\\n\\nWe’re looking for new talents to help us scale and iterate on KYVE. We are looking to hire a marketing/growth manager, a software engineer, a solidity developer, and a technical support manager for the following months. More info will follow soon.\\n\\nLastly, we want to thank again the unique investors that believed in our project since day one. Their help is not just about funds but also assisting us in our journey through the crypto world. We would also like to thank the incredible community following us, supporting us at this very early stage of the project. We cannot thank you enough and cannot wait for you to see what comes next.\\n\\n## **About Us**\\n\\n[KYVE](https://www.kyve.network/) is a next-generation protocol that enables data providers to store and reliably verify their data streams seamlessly. KYVE’s decentralized archival framework standardizes, validates, and permanently stores data streams. By leveraging Arweave, the solution ensures these resources' scalability, immutability, and availability over time. By recently migrating from SmartWeave to Moonbeam smart contracts, KYVE is now EVM compatible.\\n\\n[Website](https://kyve.network/) I [Medium](https://blog.kyve.network/) I [Mirror](https://kyve.mirror.xyz/) I [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KYVEnetwork) I [Discord](https://discord.gg/E73KZwaa4S) I [Telegram](https://t.me/kyvenet) I [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kyve)\\n\",\"timestamp\":1635345762,\"title\":\"Announcing Our Second Funding Round Featuring Hypersphere, Coinbase Ventures, and Others\"},\"digest\":\"AbpvLs3h-xDC2che2IFLdeLX_FEX7cOvsv_jsx3b8zY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa3b0B3EaA0eb40f74976F6aF0b0b2AD1F6Db1771\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3POYF1xJQ4MBMnSVa6Ta1G4ZT_hmOgY1HYPjo2oBJkU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"LN5DgJikcfH6oa58-EAJDvYZ1WFVNUaaXBqAsEAX_Lw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Ok8PpdRlyFR82yO2XhsXqTM__UkJTZpLvsQT7GCNfCJHDSQIhWZqulq3gWqLGayDEGK7pNvg6AR-CQqH3I-b4g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf39d0d04973b10e352bc65f34be138ee110324e0e81ded38ffce983a75911f4a3567c298007a65628d83add71b4cf99f27aa7864bc4934bc33f6f63ddd427be91c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3POYF1xJQ4MBMnSVa6Ta1G4ZT_hmOgY1HYPjo2oBJkU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"LN5DgJikcfH6oa58-EAJDvYZ1WFVNUaaXBqAsEAX_Lw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"AbpvLs3h-xDC2che2IFLdeLX_FEX7cOvsv_jsx3b8zY\"}"
