"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Recent coverage of the technology industry** as a whole has not been positive. Earlier this week Congress held hearings with a Facebook whistleblower, and on Friday Bloomberg reported the Biden admin is considering executive orders around cryptocurrency regulation. While there‚Äôs widespread agreement among the tech and crypto industries (and even bipartisan congressional support) that regulation of some kind is needed, the ‚Äúfixes‚Äù proposed seem misdirected and the rhetoric far from supportive.\\n\\nLegislators seem unwilling to understand cryptocurrency for anything more than strictly the tools of hackers demanding Bitcoin as ransom, or somehow better accommodating drug traffickers and money launderers. Just like any industry crypto has seen its fair share of bad actors‚Ä¶ but the ever growing number of users of these products (and the communities growing around them) are asking to do so within a fair legal framework and these ‚Äúnational security‚Äù questions are a distraction from the real issues they face.\\n\\n**Hearing from the people who are** doing this work themselves would be helpful. But this is a space where the level of anonymity users attain is almost a competition, with some widely ‚Äúknown‚Äù users existing strictly as a wallet address or Twitter handle. The experience of my family is one I‚Äôll freely share, but it‚Äôs just one among the many.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/myaLkm-neiQwsGvXrc8Ox.jpg?height=409&width=610)\\n\\n**Prior to the pandemic I had a position** working for the company that (among other things) prints the yellow pages nationwide ‚Äî yes, people still use them! This job was the ‚Äúcareer-type role‚Äù that I was *finally* able to land! The timing was perfect; it was 2016, my wife Courtney and I already had a 1 year old son (Kai), and we‚Äôd welcome number two (Eisley) later that same year. Courtney was able to be a stay-at-home mom, and in a couple short years we were able to buy our first home. \\n So many saw their lives upended last year and March 25th is when the situation changed for us too. The looming pandemic and office shutdowns led the company I worked for to completely do away with my department, and with it my job. We found ourselves jobless, with no income, at the very beginning of the Covid shutdowns and like so many others, not sure where to turn.\\n\\n**Cryptocurrency & decentralized blockchain technology** was an interest of mine for the last couple years that I viewed as just a hobby. The tech interested me and the tokens made me a little money on the side, but not being a developer or knowing how to code, I didn‚Äôt imagine myself getting anymore involved than that. While working virtually was quickly becoming the norm, I was spending more time than ever on this crypto ‚Äúhobby‚Äù of mine. The crypto projects I played with in my spare time while employed were now becoming my primary concerns, supplanting for the 40+ hours a week I used to spend in an Overland Park office building. **The question soon became clear: can someone like myself make a ‚Äú*job*‚Äù out of this ‚Äú*work*‚Äù I was doing??** \\n Saying my wife was skeptical is putting it nice. She had reasons for doubt though; the plan involved a job that didn‚Äôt yet exist in an industry known for its extreme volatility for ‚Äúcompanies‚Äù without benefits packages or even an HR department. As a husband, father, provider that was a scary proposition. I was confident in my knowledge of the industry and the relationships I‚Äôd made would allow me to find a lane in this new space so I took the plunge!\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n**What I found was a community of people** who subscribe to the belief that the *decentralization of institutions can be a solution to many of society‚Äôs inequities.* Whether that‚Äôs through freer access to financial products, or a digital artist minting her creation into a token, the common thread is complete transparency and accessibility. That‚Äôs what ‚Äòdecentralized blockchain technology‚Äô means to me‚Ä¶ removing barriers through blockchain verification.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5kCwHMqoJGA1N_cSJPOWW.jpeg?height=845&width=987)\\n\\nAnd that‚Äôs about where we start losing people. It‚Äôs not an easy subject to understand from the beginning, but the currency/token aspect really gets people running for the doors! It‚Äôs important for outsiders to see past the bytes & blocks, and to understand that these tools being used are **just like new technologies of the past:** developers are finding new ways to implement them, nefarious actors are taking advantage of the lax in regulation, and legislators are having trouble keeping up. Mix in a populace widely unaware of the space with people getting *fabulously wealthy* and one quickly understands how we make for an easy punching bag.\\n\\n**For my family and myself**, the blockchain industry has presented a new and different opportunity. The flexibility it‚Äôs given me has led me to interests I never even considered in my wheelhouse ‚Äî this article being a prime example! Financially we‚Äôre doing as well, if not better, than our highest earning year pre-pandemic. The downfalls are what makes the need for regulation clearest: income reporting/verification doesn‚Äôt exist, the tokens we hold could lose (or gain.. üöÄüåï) a considerable amount of their value on a daily basis, and the social safety nets in place for workers are largely unavailable since only WY even recognizes DAOs as a legal entity. So it would seem that well over a decade into this new technology, we‚Äôve still got a ways to go.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nVisit @blakeburrito on Twitter or at blakeburrito.xyz to connect.\",\"timestamp\":1634602714,\"title\":\"Cryptocurrency & The Blockchain‚õìIndustry‚Äôs Impact On One American Household\"},\"digest\":\"V_KclL3jYlec1hjqH1E0gsXTdig1SFsG_LzGaAOIvag\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6E9A88971e957Abb41bAe4E2677caE258F0c1e76\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"V3mvl5X0Jn8anXFzUZtX_oqPLnW2B2FlaigS7uysvNQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"RbrONbT4-J8lv5Bxf7BF3XrrHI0vNv5q48uMuSSL5EQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"PZ3HrVfENMOwzKk86EB9Zd16sKFManrDNYsRVczew4F3yvVuxp8qvche64WVGP5lgcbOL7J6IRdNO9asGp9Nig\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xca20e494fa2eaf63ebd9845375af5c9e179d36bfa2516c4a2784a51447a67f8d205f5e96c636fa2235f8ef795b5ff9554e0192aa5eabe0ecd5558eeb2ff43a5a1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"V3mvl5X0Jn8anXFzUZtX_oqPLnW2B2FlaigS7uysvNQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"RbrONbT4-J8lv5Bxf7BF3XrrHI0vNv5q48uMuSSL5EQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"V_KclL3jYlec1hjqH1E0gsXTdig1SFsG_LzGaAOIvag\"}"
