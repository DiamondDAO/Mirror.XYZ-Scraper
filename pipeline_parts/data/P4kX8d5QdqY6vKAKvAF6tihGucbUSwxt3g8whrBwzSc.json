"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Chaumette, as you see, was refined, artistic;--the torture of the fallen Queen's heart meant more to him than a blow of the guillotine on her neck.\\n\\nNo wonder, therefore, that it was Procureur Chaumette who first discovered exactly what type of new religion Paris wanted just now.\\n\\n\\\"Let us have a Goddess of Reason,\\\" he said, \\\"typified if you will by the most beautiful woman in Paris. Let us have a feast of the Goddess of Reason, let there be a pyre of all the gew-gaws which for centuries have been flaunted by overbearing priests before the eyes of starving multitudes, let the People rejoice and dance around that funeral pile, and above it all let the new Goddess tower smiling and triumphant. The Goddess of Reason! the only deity our new and regenerate France shall acknowledge throughout the centuries which are to come!\\\"\\n\\nLoud applause greeted the impassioned speech.\\n\\n\\\"A new goddess, by all means!\\\" shouted the grave gentlemen of the National Assembly, \\\"the Goddess of Reason!\\\"\\n\\nThey were all eager that the People should have this toy; something to play with and to tease, round which to dance the mad Carmagnole and sing the ever-recurring \\\"Ca ira.\\\"\\n\\nSomething to distract the minds of the populace from the consequences of its own deeds, and the helplessness of its legislators.\\n\\nProcureur Chaumette enlarged upon his original idea; like a true artist who sees the broad effect of a picture at a glance and then fills in the minute details, he was already busy elaborating his scheme.\\n\\n\\\"The goddess must be beautiful ... not too young ... Reason can only go hand in hand with the riper age of second youth ... she must be decked out in classical draperies, severe yet suggestive ... she must be rouged and painted ... for she is a mere idol ... easily to be appeased with incense, music and laughter.\\\"\\n\\nHe was getting deeply interested in his subject, seeking minutiae of detail, with which to render his theme more and more attractive.\\n\\nBut patience was never the characteristic of the Revolutionary Government of France. The National Assembly soon tired of Chaumette's dithyrambic utterances. Up aloft on the Mountain, Danton was yawning like a gigantic leopard.\\n\\nSoon Henriot was on his feet. He had a far finer scheme than that of the Procureur to place before his colleagues. A grand National fete, semi-religious in character, but of the new religion which destroyed and desecrated and never knelt in worship.\\n\\nCitizen Chaumette's Goddess of Reason by all means--Henriot conceded that the idea was a good one--but the goddess merely as a figure-head: around her a procession of unfrocked and apostate priests, typifying the destruction of ancient hierarchy, mules carrying loads of sacred vessels, the spoils of ten thousand churches of France, and ballet girls in bacchanalian robes, dancing the Carmagnole around the new deity.\\n\\nPublic Prosecutor Foucquier Tinville thought all these schemes very tame. Why should the People of France be led to think that the era of a new religion would mean an era of milk and water, of pageants and of fireworks? Let every man, woman, and child know that this was an era of blood and again of blood.\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\" he exclaimed in passionate accents, \\\"would that all the traitors in France had but one head, that it might be cut off with one blow of the guillotine!\\\"\\n\\nHe approved of the National fete, but he desired an apotheosis of the guillotine; he undertook to find ten thousand traitors to be beheaded on one grand and glorious day: ten thousand heads to adorn the Place de la Revolution on a great, never-to-be-forgotten evening, after the guillotine had accomplished this record work.\\n\\nBut Collot d'Herbois would also have his say. Collot lately hailed from the South, with a reputation for ferocity unparalleled throughout the whole of this horrible decade. He would not be outdone by Tinville's bloodthirsty schemes.\\n\\nHe was the inventor of the \\\"Noyades,\\\" which had been so successful at Lyons and Marseilles. \\\"Why not give the inhabitants of Paris one of these exhilarating spectacles?\\\" he asked with a coarse, brutal laugh.\\n\\nThen he explained his invention, of which he was inordinately proud. Some two or three hundred traitors, men, women, and children, tied securely together with ropes in great, human bundles and thrown upon a barge in the middle of the river: the barge with a hole in her bottom! not too large! only sufficient to cause her to sink slowly, very slowly, in sight of the crowd of delighted spectators.\\n\\nThe cries of the women and children, and even of the men, as they felt the waters rising and gradually enveloping them, as they felt themselves powerless even for a fruitless struggle, had proved most exhilarating, so Citizen Collot declared, to the hearts of the true patriots of Lyons.\",\"timestamp\":1636532134,\"title\":\"Chaumette, as you see\"},\"digest\":\"AJNcSrp3l4lItlOrzHoq-Hdg0Soo0z43KHnQ4O_uur0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xb58Fb3bc38b2ACb99CcfBc6A4e3223f798F927DE\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JuGy4Uh6GlvW-RLUBKftDN9Skeps30sBqLrkE2EyI0Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"M0OcZAIUCIQkH8xE0PTHTeEAnmxtEIpKKhgxhGY8B_A\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"QiWM8xgMHdeWv2J__xLLQrsg27hLqfeZhLRkjIvPVP893seBvNV-67h3PIHKGpF1ksufT6lDHmI_V5sCHEhliA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9214f3729524f94e2062f5790faa8a88affb02b5555289c1d85d10ba9215c49f0f1bc19745328a9bc96df3b4e76dd730606799ba743dfa63473ee4b9af5789281c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JuGy4Uh6GlvW-RLUBKftDN9Skeps30sBqLrkE2EyI0Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"M0OcZAIUCIQkH8xE0PTHTeEAnmxtEIpKKhgxhGY8B_A\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"AJNcSrp3l4lItlOrzHoq-Hdg0Soo0z43KHnQ4O_uur0\"}"
