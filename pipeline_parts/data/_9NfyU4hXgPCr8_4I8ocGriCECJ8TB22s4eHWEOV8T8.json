We oblige crypto asset service providers to consistently identify the beneficial owners,” the agreement adds.\\n\\nThe document states the European Union supervisory authority should “not only take care of the traditional financial sector but also prevent the misuse of crypto values for money laundering and terrorist financing.”\\n\\nThe formation of the coalition reportedly took two months of negotiations following the German federal election on Sept. 26, and it marks the end of Angela Merkel’s 16-year reign as Chancellor, who is retiring and will be replaced by the SDP’s Olaf Scholz.\\n\\n### Crypto progressing across the EU\\n\\nElsewhere on the continent, the European Council, which guides the EU’s political agenda, [adopted two proposals](https://cointelegraph.com/news/european-council-approves-two-digital-asset-proposals) named the “Regulation on Markets in Crypto Assets” (MiCA) [framework](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0593&from=EN) and the “Digital Operational Resilience Act.”\\n\\nMiCA in particular — initially drafted by the [European Commission](https://cointelegraph.com/news/european-commission-adopts-digital-finance-package-for-crypto-and-blockchain) in September 2020 — [aims](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/11/24/digital-finance-package-council-reaches-agreement-on-mica-and-dora/?utm_source=dsms-auto&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Digital+finance+package%3a+Council+reaches+agreement+on+MiCA+and+DORA) to create a “regulatory framework for the crypto-assets market that supports innovation and draws on the potential of crypto-assets.” While it still needs to be ratified by the European Parliament, if enacted, it will subject crypto asset issuers to more stringent requirements, but [nonfungible tokens](https://cointelegraph.com/news/collins-dictionary-announce-nft-as-word-of-2021) and utility tokens will fall outside the scope of the regulation.\\n\\n***Related: [EU central banks working on DLT-based asset settlement](https://cointelegraph.com/news/eu-central-banks-work-on-dlt-based-asset-settlement)***\\n\\nIn a comprehensive [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r218s7/the_most_important_piece_of_regulation_on/) from Reddit user u/BelgianPolitics in the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit on Friday, the progressive regulatory proposal was labeled as the “most important one to date for the entire crypto industry.”\\n\\nThe Reddit user’s analysis has almost 900 comments at the time of writing and provides a detailed rundown of the proposed laws in MiCA. The author emphasized the significance of the proposals:\\n\\n> “These rules will have to be followed by every entity operating in the European Union. However, because of the ‘Brussels Effect,’ there is a very good chance these rules will become international standards in the end. While everyone is focused on the US and China, the EU is casually leading the way.”\",\"timestamp\":1639473282,\"title\":\"New German government cites crypto in coalition agreement\"},\"digest\":\"_LxuyLhbcGVqVnc39EPN009MD0kkZ_TrKAA-1I9IA8k\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xba279bB017282CFEdcb1615edd26e6A0b48c7776\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3PQ97WSo4vegH5HCNCLs9nj9cb7txGBvWcLItUd3E6A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gFL9rFmCyKmB9EgW2ip1T9awVIVrZx7kJNACfaSQ2rs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"NVV_sjB8oa8LVkG32JuMbDEenVNBPrzR1huQV2xS8DTGqLz37WoIJJtWc1Npdu22hM69PsprFw3xRuoPcO63cg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa4745181d19818b4c30a865aabae95b4bab1a845ba226f47b8fa2cfc9a12a58e6a4c55fa4a32264dd60f86104be49df845afa7bd4391c6189270ce3318f8c5d81c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3PQ97WSo4vegH5HCNCLs9nj9cb7txGBvWcLItUd3E6A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gFL9rFmCyKmB9EgW2ip1T9awVIVrZx7kJNACfaSQ2rs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"_LxuyLhbcGVqVnc39EPN009MD0kkZ_TrKAA-1I9IA8k\"}"
