"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*The following poem is a philosophical pondering of the “birth” of the universe, a contemplation that asks how something can come from nothing and imagines how perhaps everything around us is simply a manifestation of nothingness.*\\n\\n*You’ll first come across the poem in audiovisual form—narrated, musicalized, and animated—then the poem in written form, the poem’s illustration from the illustrated poetry book, and finally an additional pondering related to the poem.*\\n\\n# AUDIOVISUAL POEM:\\n\\n[https://youtu.be/UqF36UOUjUE](https://youtu.be/UqF36UOUjUE)\\n\\n# WRITTEN POEM:\\n\\nIn the beginning, there was Zero,\\nAnd Zero was all there was;\\nZero never did much,\\nFor nothing never does.\\nBut then one fateful moment\\nZero had a thought;\\nZero started thinking\\nOf all that it was not.\\nThen Zero started visualizing\\nAll that it could be,\\nAnd soon it came to realize\\nIt could be anything.\\nZero could potentially be\\n2 plus 8 plus 3,\\nAs long as it was sure to add\\nNegative 13.\\nIt could be 30 divided by 5\\nThen multiplied by 9,\\nIf it also negatively added\\n12 times 4.5.\\nIt could even be i times pi\\nThen e to the power of that;\\nAs long as 1 was added too,\\nZero was still intact.\\nBut these kinds of equations\\nNeeded some chronology;\\nCalculations require time,\\nSo time came into being.\\nNow Zero could express itself\\nWith separate entities,\\nA daunting infinite amount\\nOf possibilities.\\nBut then an unexpected thing\\nSoon began to occur;\\nThese new and separate entities\\nStarted to observe.\\nFirst they became aware of themselves,\\nThen they looked out far,\\nAnd then they all began to notice\\nOther equation parts.\\n9 saw 30 divided by 5;\\n3 noticed 4.5.\\ne discovered 8 plus 3;\\n1 saw i times pi.\\nThey observed each other curiously\\nAnd tried to do the math.\\nWhat did these random numbers mean?\\nThey craved to understand.\\nOnly Zero knows the answer\\nTo the equation in its head:\\nIt always has and always will be\\nZero in the end!\\n\\n# POEM ILLUSTRATION:\\n\\n![The Zero Universe](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mjCHivY3BnJGtKgPaNWUV.png?height=2382&width=2382)\\n\\n# EXTENDED PONDERING:\\n\\nI remember being a young teenager, about 13 or so, and hearing about the law of conversation of matter, which states that matter cannot be created or destroyed, a thought that piqued my curiosity.\\n\\nIn those days, as in the present days, my brother and I loved talking about our thoughts and theories about the planets, the stars, the world, the universe. I’m pretty sure it was on a Friday while going out to eat at Burger King with our mom (Friday was our day to go out somewhere to eat and talk about all kinds of things) that I told my brother my newest “theory”. It seemed logical to me: if matter cannot be created or destroyed, then either all matter in the universe has always been here, or everything in the universe all adds up to nothing.\\n\\nI remember thinking that perhaps every bit of matter or piece of information that was “created” had an opposite bit of matter or piece of information that canceled it out, thus allowing the universe to remain in its state of “nothingness”. I remember thinking that perhaps the universe, with all of its eternal time, had, at some point, grown bored and then curious, and then began to be creative and *create* different ways of expressing itself.\\n\\nPerhaps we are all just different expressions of nothing, each one of us a beautiful passing thought.\",\"timestamp\":1641481792,\"title\":\"Poem: The Zero Universe\"},\"digest\":\"U_HvZGfPUkMZI_gip_kCCMYwrpVPMyupEhp0wriTryE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7E8B8Ce5640575C49E821c672216501B60a72914\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uc2GuLu3smzvRhDyoITy4hapuNog0O2vgHlczD884ts\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"5oog5plFYfP6gs95aQee8wkZuX_geoImjw4mKeEfrl0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"dC7dox0jfFuSZsNMnGR3kjL9g9_mseHyoIHssIeHn1AeRLQ51JbQFjhwM62q5SLy7URdB1ZBzymHoTY8fhvoxA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x6ceaac35e6c6f296f7c49102dd7eeac07293837489c4f48febe868e59ec11ea55baf11a7f79599ec589bd923729126e9d557741e770ab730cefff29c5b3ca5e91c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uc2GuLu3smzvRhDyoITy4hapuNog0O2vgHlczD884ts\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"5oog5plFYfP6gs95aQee8wkZuX_geoImjw4mKeEfrl0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"y98ttD2DcF7Gi958QiPmoHk45Jhz1quEOy81f7mHyHY\"}"
