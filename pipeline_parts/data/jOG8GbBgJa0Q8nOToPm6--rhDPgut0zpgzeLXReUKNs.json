"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Those of us who are bosses should pay special attention to that leadership and leadership are two different things. The power of a leader comes from his position and position in the company. The power of leadership comes from his knowledge, being a person, and real skill!\\n\\nLeaders are often appointed. And leadership is earned by your own ability. For example, if you want to become a general manager, then you must first have the ability of a general manager. If you don't have the ability of a general manager, even if you are appointed as a general manager, it will not last long. The longer you stay in this position, it will be a disaster for yourself and the company.\\n\\nTell everyone about two kinds of animals. One is the wild goose, which is often said on the Internet, and it will be in S after a while.\\n\\nType, the flying animals in the sky that line up into Type B for a while, but their real situation is not arranged in Type S or Type B, but a herringbone. When the wild goose is flying. There is a big goose inside, called the leader goose. One is the flock, and there is a strong leader in the flock.\\n\\nIf you are just a sheep, you may be called the so-called leader, but in fact you can't really lead a group of sheep. Only shepherds have this ability.\\n\\nWe should be the leader geese, not the leader. According to our usual thinking, the leader geese is the leader of this group of geese, and it leads everyone in flight. However, this is not the case. The geese take off together. The takeoff positions are front and back. The big geese have a good perception of the resistance to the air and their own physical fitness. Therefore, once a certain pattern is formed, one The wild goose flies in the front, and will follow immediately behind.\\n\\nThey will adjust themselves to minimize air resistance during flight, and then gradually\\n\\n168 Entrepreneur Business School Serving entrepreneurs\\n\\nArranged in the shape of \\\"people\\\". During the flight, the big geese in the back are less labor-saving. First, the position where it is located has low air resistance, and second, there is a backflow that will push it. These factors seem very small, but for long-distance wild geese, it is very important to save any physical strength, because they still have a long way to fly.\\n\\nThe lead goose was born accidentally, and when it took off, it flew to the front. It's not to fix a single goose. The lead goose is not a fixed appointment, it is the head goose, leading everyone to fly. It flies to one\\n\\nAt a certain level, if you feel that you are exhausted, you will automatically slow down, and the wild goose behind will replace it and become the new leader. Simply put, that is leadership, ability is the first, and the second is the position of leadership.\\n\\nThat is, you can fly in front because you have this ability, so you become the lead goose. When you are incapable, take the initiative to retreat. The position of the lead geese is not lifelong, it is determined by its own ability.\\n\\nBut the leader is not. Leaders are generally appointed. The difference between the leader and the leader geese is that, first of all,\\n\\nThe wild goose is very sensitive to its own physical ability, but the leader does not have this sensitivity. Then, there is no information communication between the flocks, but when the geese fly by, we can always hear the sound of the geese calling, which is actually sending a communication signal. This is a kind of information communication, which can keep everyone in a more consistent pace, and even includes information such as: I can't do it anymore, I want to move to the front or the back now. It is a good information communication system in the Goose Array.\\n\\nBut in the flock, whoever is the leader is big and strong, whoever is the boss. Once you are the leader, you will always be the leader. Even if the ability declines, everyone gets used to it. It is a lifelong system. In the end, when the leader was unable to lead everyone in the right direction, he was still the leader. There is a herd effect in economics, namely\\n\\nEntrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs 169\\n\\nWhere a sheep goes, the others will follow, which may lead to the wrong path. So there are sheepdogs on top of the flock, and they need them to help the shepherd get the flock on the right path. Therefore, the leader has no leadership, and the leader first has leadership before becoming a leader.\\n\\nIf we regard a team as a biological group, some organizations are a flock of sheep, and some organizations are a flock of geese.\\n\\nOur bosses have to build a team like a wild goose, choose the leader, choose the lead geese, not the leader.\\n\\nThe reason why you can be the lead goose is that you are the most capable at that moment, and you are most willing to rush to the front. Faced with the greatest air pressure and resistance, you are willing to take the responsibility, so you let you be the lead goose.\\n\\nAnd you have to have a sense of direction at the same time. Running around like a flock of sheep is definitely not enough. Therefore, a sense of direction, one's ability, and ability are necessary qualities to be a leader.\\n\\nIn modern society, competition is fierce. My team must let the capable and best performers assume the leadership. Only when we have leadership, can we have a leadership position. If I can't do it myself, I will dismiss class immediately. Let the person with the most ability and the best performance to direct the entire organization. No one is the leader now and will be the leader for the rest of his life. Adjust immediately according to the actual situation. Such an organization has wisdom.\",\"timestamp\":1634798868,\"title\":\"What is a smart organization\"},\"digest\":\"cXuD9QYfPRt2FYfpPt9VilyIHAbSskQVnBumWRe8R_E\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"67zPz7c3h2P6_WKVnMeeYERuzUcsQE_T3PSJ3AiNHGgRMO4rCn-MIFsnLdSlTs_lD6AWhQnydiD7DrEw3IvvRg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"cXuD9QYfPRt2FYfpPt9VilyIHAbSskQVnBumWRe8R_E\"}"
