"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"It took about two decades for this style of Korean fried chicken to make its way into the American foodie scene. The chicken is deep fried twice to make the exterior extra crispy and to lock moisture in. The gochujang sauce is a hot, honey, spicy mix...and well, it's just fabulous. You'll have the family completely raving!\\n\\n[ \\n ](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/diana71/)Directions\\n\\nInstructions Checklist\\n\\n* Step 1\\n\\n  Whisk milk and egg together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined and smooth.
