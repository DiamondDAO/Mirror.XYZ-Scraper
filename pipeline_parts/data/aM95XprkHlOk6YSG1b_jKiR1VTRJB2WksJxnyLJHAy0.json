After working as an assistant manager and front-end delivery driver for 80+ hours in multiple deliveries for close to 2 years, I learnt all the ins-and-outs of running a delivery. Here’s some of the brands I worked with and sample design-work.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xIP1yxtU6kyBDp5K1dE83.png?height=563&width=1002)\\n\\nIn 2017, a couple friends and I, received $100K from an investor to start our own delivery with a fully functional recording studio. After taking a minimum salary and equity in the company, we built everything from scratch. From taking calls, running deliveries, creating automation, improving marketing, meeting with vendors, to even sweeping the floor. I was so driven that I even went out of my way to contract and build a basic de-centralized cannabis Point of Sales and Inventory-Tracking platform. I was hungry, I skipped birthday, family vacations, and holidays in dreams of a brighter future.\\n\\nThat’s when I learned the value of a contract and putting personal physical and mental health first. Although I put in more work than was asked, my business partners assumed because they were “older” they knew how to run businesses. I learned that while I was putting my blood, sweat, and tears and doing most of the front-end work, these same partners were cutting corners by sourcing moldy, pesticide and insect-filled medicine. Around then, there was a split in the business and the partners diverged into two different brands.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/spopFuRLaaqUsdZj6NrI-.png?height=559&width=1000)\\n\\nWith promises of change, I funneled all my time into these deliveries. It was then I offered the idea of “tokenizing” our communities, establishing our online presence, and releasing our studio-produced content on the blockchain. But I was seeing too far into the future, and was labeled “crazy” by my partners for even bringing up such an idea. By the end of the run, one of the businesses dissolved and the other turned into a MLM recruiting tool targeting underprivileged youth with promises of fast cash, at which point I stepped out. \\n\\nDisheartened with the trajectory of the businesses I had help start and put years into I saw how they turned to a profit-over-people model and how it overall affected the business. I took a break and headed to Toronto in search of further spiritual training in Tao Field Healing, learning from pioneers in new modalities of healing, including the ex-President of Simmens. Soon after I was called to get initiated in kriya yog, or alchemical breathwork. It’s here where I went from just helping creatives, to being a Creator. As a perfectionist, doubt crippled me for years but I realized you gotta T.R.A.P. or Take Risks And Prosper. It’s here where I recorded my first song and fourth NFT, “Way 2 Long”, now on Audius: \\n\\n[https://audius.co/8gratitude8/way-2-long](https://audius.co/8gratitude8/way-2-long)\\n\\nWhen I got back to the Bay, I turned toward consulting in the cannabis space and our team was working with some of the biggest brands in the industry. From graphic design, sales & marketing, metrics & business strategy, we handled it all. I created @510consciousconsulting as a way to channel everything I learned into the alternative medicine industry into one business. \\n\\n![Uncle Mac's : Undeniably Authentic](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UZvpjrR20z53myU6mOTsm.png?height=563&width=1000)\\n\\nAs we worked with various brands in different states, working directly with multi-million dollar operations, craft extractors & processors, as well as industry-awarded deliveries and dispensaries, I came to realize the barriers to entry when it came to small growers and BIPOC individuals who wanted to join the recreational industry. \\n\\n![Flower Wheel Nursery](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vmf5eTfa4pBb3di2G17Ps.png?height=560&width=1001)\\n\\nAs more legislation passed, it started drove out those that care for the plant and started putting profit over people. The need for proper community healing encouraged me to continue my spiritual training and create the my 5th NFT, T.A.O.

One of our tenets at 5-Dee is to remove the barriers and gatekeepers to allow entry for BIPOC individuals while maximizing overall efficiency of the supply chain and DeFi protocols.

The pre-seed will go towards acquiring and renovating a fully-integrated living-soil farm and nursery. Sitting on 70+ acres of land in pristine Mendocino County (pictured above), the brand already has statewide distribution and award-winning industry products. With complete vertical integration to industry onboarding, we aim to create de-centralized frameworks for the cannabis supply chain as well as DeFi commerce platforms. $HASH, onboarding the future of cannabis and psychedelic culture.\\n\\n![$HASH DAO](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cImJhnkLfuVkzTFSQGq7P.png?height=558&width=997)\\n\\nA Creator Economy Part 1 : [CLICK HERE](https://mirror.xyz/0x954fA8cfb797a26D4878ee212004889a2C9D7624/kbnIJkzs4DpyVqzwojPkohLEChydOo_h9ZfLRvAwEH8)\",\"timestamp\":1639709283,\"title\":\"CREATOR ECONOMY PT. 2\"},\"digest\":\"dFcPptT-qPOJ0839bu2JAKqK81MuWMPtnRrZ01dK37U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x954fA8cfb797a26D4878ee212004889a2C9D7624\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nGUrGqyRBdkXupj02ZcDifbw5IEXnn3HGH739q00ae8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"A5F9bdA6pEa1yXZlJaS0VO3lHx9lMC0WNk9unIKCU_Q\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"_ceai2TjkJZ1iDkNb3zZWyBluhLeKH79_6dqZ1tgY2vrZsc22DwEh3m5BItzW5ALZiJ0MmZxtyvZdPsEIgjxfw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1e9cd028c65cb989e107871eb1ef168e8f61757a297a3a0c7675d16bd31ffd477b9a9ea8d6bab8a2dccf300a29e4df2f8680450921b3b21453bbb4cc8f48171f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nGUrGqyRBdkXupj02ZcDifbw5IEXnn3HGH739q00ae8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"A5F9bdA6pEa1yXZlJaS0VO3lHx9lMC0WNk9unIKCU_Q\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"dFcPptT-qPOJ0839bu2JAKqK81MuWMPtnRrZ01dK37U\"}"
