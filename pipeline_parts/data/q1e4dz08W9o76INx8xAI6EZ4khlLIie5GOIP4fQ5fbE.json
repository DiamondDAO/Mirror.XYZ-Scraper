"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Author: @dawnx666 Translation: @C_Chyn\\n\\nRecently, **Facebook** officially changed its name to “Meta,” signaling its strategic entry into metaverse. In September, **Tencent** registered the metaverse-related trademarks, such as “King of Metaverse” and “QQ Metaverse” (Honor of Kings and QQ are Tencent’s popular mobile game and instant messaging app, respectively). Also in September, Hu Houkun, Rotating Chairman of Huawei, said at a forum that “Metaverse represents the humanity’s expectation for further integration between the virtual world and the physical world.” These are only some examples of many actions taken by industry leaders, bringing much attention to the concept of “Metaverse”.\\n\\n**Why has Metaverse received so much attention lately?**\\n\\nFrom the perspective of technology, blockchain brought enforceable property rights to all digital assets. From the perspective of the development of internet, **3D and multimedia have always been the general trend**: from text messages to images and then to videos and live streaming, internet has kept moving towards liveliness. **Metaverse combines both perspectives: building upon the technology of blockchain, it fits the general trend towards richness in contents**. Furthermore, Metaverse platforms such as Cryptovoxels are composed of special NFTs, each able to hold even more smaller NFTs, creating an ecology far surpassing any other NFTs.\\n\\n**Which business models can we expect in Metaverse?**\\n\\n**1.Sales of NFT artworks**\\n\\nCurrently, galleries are the most common business model in Metaverse. This probably results from the innate connection between NFTs and arts, according to my observation and discussion with industry insiders across the world. Many of the first active members in Metaverse are artists or members of art industry. Examples from CryptoVoxels includes the Pure Gold Gallery by Jiaying Liu, Panda Gallery by Ting Song, BCA gallery, and dogesoundclub from Korean community. **These groups brought about galleries, the earliest and most popular business model in Metaverse**.\\n\\n![https://www.cryptovoxels.com/play?coords=W@291E,369N](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PvRsLKR_XTT_cT4GgtM2h.png?height=802&width=845)\\n\\n![https://www.cryptovoxels.com/play?coords=NW@569W,205N,12.5F](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TH2-otl1M0tE7ekpM8DGp.png?height=816&width=1400)\\n\\n![https://www.cryptovoxels.com/play?coords=S@122E,432N,5.5F](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cVOcW2bQ8iMWe_gMelBxe.png?height=793&width=1400)\\n\\n![https://www.cryptovoxels.com/play?coords=E@795E,230S,9F](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PGIPwoL013Jp1YQ06G_-O.png?height=997&width=1400)\\n\\n**2.Sales of Vox**\\n\\nUnlike the physical world, Metaverse is made from other materials. For example, CryptoVoxels, including all buildings and wearables within, is completely composed of voxels, digital values on a 3D grid. Thus, the use of vox is indispensable in CryptoVoxels, serving functions from building decoration or personal display. To meet this demand, **we now have multiple vox shops, with Vox Walk as the business model’s prime example**.\\n\\n![https://www.cryptovoxels.com/play?coords=W@6483W,116S](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/STVDeW11NWZ6mjD42W96s.png?height=732&width=1400)\\n\\n**3.Construction**\\n\\nSome landowners have multiple parcels but limited time and energy for construction. Other landowners are organizations inclined to hire professional team to construct their HQ for branding purposes. **Demands such as these led to third-party construction services for Metaverse, such as MetaEstate and Voxel Architects.** The top four buildings with the most numbers cumulative visitors on the CryptoVoxels’ main island Origin City — SpaceAge, StoneAge, GlassAge, and Welcome — are all built by Voxel Architects. MetaEstate has also built famously exquisite buildings such as the HQ for MetaChi, Creation Fashion Hub, and Haolinju Restaurant.\\n\\n![https://www.k1ic.com/cv-en.html](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ms9gqvKtjmSCRK6wA-u_r.png?height=516&width=1400)\\n\\n![https://www.cryptovoxels.com/play?coords=W@639W,276N,18.5F](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ze7nSbgnMRNPabSHYymV0.png?height=715&width=1400)\\n\\n \\n\\n**4.Advertising**\\n\\n**Some landowners have multiple parcels but limited time and energy for construction**.

Data analysis by [CV Analytics](https://www.k1ic.com/cvb-zh.html) showed that many landowners hold multiple parcels. We also know that some parcel owners intend to invest for long-term instead of constructing. Therefore, a natural market exists for landowners to rent their spare parcels to others with ideas for construction or operations.\\n\\n![https://www.k1ic.com/cv-en.html](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/69JcoC_u-QDBnQ3nmmJrb.png?height=1558&width=1400)\\n\\n**6.Immersion**\\n\\n**Immersion is the experience where people are so focused on the designed environment that they forget about reality**. At Universal Studio in Beijing, what appears as physical experience are actually spiritual immersion, turning moving chairs into soaring with Harry Potter, jumping across skyscrapers with Transformers, fidgeting around with Minions. **I think Metaverse is a natural place for immersive experiences, based on specialized building design and 3D gadgets**.\\n\\n**7.Games**\\n\\n**The virtual nature of games makes them easily integrated into Metaverse.** For example, The Sandbox is a community-driven blockchain game platform, where creators can turn voxel assets and in-game equipment into NFTs on blockchain. Also, games can certainly be a part of other metaverse platforms. **Through such on-chain games, players can invest in NFTs and enjoy the game at the same time, because the in-game items themselves are NFTs**.\\n\\n![https://www.sandbox.game/en/map/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jxwU0bCMTMVBjK0jB0W9z.png?height=438&width=846)\\n\\n![https://www.cryptovoxels.com/spaces/d0a82c2b-e9cd-4c24-93a5-a9d106b4cdfe](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dIHUAWII3AUeSMYK7zH0J.png?height=538&width=1400)\\n\\n**8.Sales of Clothing**\\n\\n**There are aspects where Metaverse will never replace the physical world, such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation, our basic physical needs**. Specifically, online sales of clothing is moving towards 3D, from 2D graphical introduction to live-streamed try-on. However, watching someone else trying the clothes is not the same as trying it yourself. **With a 3D scanner, it is possible to fit a 3D virtual version of the cloth on the 3D virtual version of yourself**.\\n\\n![https://www.cryptovoxels.com/play?coords=W@810E,81N](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/N5Kw77sgFB2aTDF4YS38o.png?height=594&width=1400)\\n\\n![https://www.cryptovoxels.com/play?coords=W@810E,81N](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ogs7fSVcuGwrhcr--7b9O.png?height=679&width=1346)\\n\\n \\n\\n**9.Online KTV (Karaoke)**\\n\\nKTV, to those who enjoy it, is a way to socialize. However, people faraway from each other can hardly meet for KTV in the physical world. Such restrictions don’t exist in Metaverse. **When it’s available, would you be interested in meeting people all around the world on Metaverse for Karaoke**?\\n\\n**10.Data Service**\\n\\n**Data is everywhere — Metaverse is no exception**. Platforms want visitor data to each parcel. Prospective buyers want historical data for parcels on sale. Prospective sellers want market data to set their asking price. Visitors want to know where to go. The support of data is necessary for each of the above. **Professional data analytics provider might become an important business**.\\n\\n![https://www.k1ic.com/cvb-zh.html](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q8l3rtqk3Uql-YrOuf2Ke.png?height=1634&width=1300)\\n\\n**In the near future, we might have a slew of new jobs**: Metaverse architects, Metaverse building designers, Metaverse construction trainers, Metaverse game planners, Metaverse building operation specialists, and so on. **There will probably be successful business models other than the ten I listed**.\\n\\nSo, what will the future of Metaverse look like? A 3D “Twitter” integrating social networking and advertising? A theme park with one immersive program after another? An online marketplace with 3D clothes fitting and try-ons? A KTV for international Karaoke? **Of course, just like none of Facebook, Google, Amazon can represent the internet by itself, it must the connections and interactions between multiple metaverse platforms that creates the real Metaverse**.\\n\\nNotes: All discussion about Metaverse in this post refers on Metaverse on blockchain because I believe this is the only real metaverse. Additionally, I want to thank Andrew Stenwold for inspiration.\",\"timestamp\":1636595991,\"title\":\"Ten Business Models in Metaverse\"},\"digest\":\"MNyH7hMfyU5B_tZoohTLg6YLIRva4la3-RcqKzOxp5c\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0F9539188aFb2e4DEaE2Bac9Ef1F0193Bb0dedE7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"51-HdtLh42bh_JAci7tXWPNhetY14PBsrc2HZ1jiANo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"sGCNSJRdejdoJjwjUz1GAAitgZxcvxx_E1i83inF91Q\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"fFuB5CdLfywszAzDRV3z2rdq31Z2LTlyJlZoqbdP1joAkvoiqePoHDjjXVP4z19tNiy6Ha-rH03xWRGtb-1n2w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf61dcc3c57801b61c043c0d339a25c10ebf52af2b23893651b3d3f8d97c01c355b5a4c769c847cff4dbec86cb97e25c30af378ce5284e97365d5329995a8a94f1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"51-HdtLh42bh_JAci7tXWPNhetY14PBsrc2HZ1jiANo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"sGCNSJRdejdoJjwjUz1GAAitgZxcvxx_E1i83inF91Q\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Eqbvzz0HDhyhwgI3BF02NQob4e7dJ_4ZVfDb_L5_PxE\"}"
