"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"In this year's NFT and metaverse concept boom, Animoca Brands is one of the biggest winners, with The Sandbox being one of the hottest NFT projects at the moment, in addition to being an early investor in star projects such as Axie Infinity developer Sky Mavis, Decentraland, Dapper Labs and others. The Sandbox is one of the hottest NFT projects today, in addition to being an early investor in star projects such as Sky Mavis, Decentraland and Dapper Labs, Axie Infinity developers, and currently investing in over 150 NFT/metaverse projects.\\n\\nIn fact, Animoca Brands was a traditional handheld game development company until 2 years ago, and was delisted from the Australian Stock Exchange for various reasons. Today, the project has reached $670 million in revenue in the first 3 quarters alone, making it a unicorn company in the NFT track.\\n\\nWith the explosion of the chain tour and meta-universe track in the second half of this year, Animoca Brands, a unicorn in this field that has been laid out for a long time, surfaced.\\n\\nFounded in 2014 and headquartered in Hong Kong, Animoca Brands is the developer of chain games such as The Sandbox, a sandbox game, and F1 Delta Time, a Formula 1 racing class. In addition to product development, Animoca Brands is also an early investor in Axie Infinity developer Sky Mavis, Decentraland, Dapper Labs and other NFT star projects, with a cumulative investment in over 150 NFT/metaverse projects.\\n\\nFor most people, Animoca Brands is more like a head player in the crypto industry that came out of nowhere. So, how did it make its fortune and where is it headed?\\n\\n**I. Back from the dead**\\n\\nThe company, co-founded by tech entrepreneur Yat Siu in 2014, was a not-so-well-known developer and publisher of handheld games until its move into blockchain in late 2017, and its business scope even involved e-books at one point.\\n\\nAnimoca Brands was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (\\\"ASX\\\") in January 2015, but has had a long history of mediocre performance and has repeatedly raised capital to supplement its cash flow. According to Crunchbase data, Animoca Brands raised a total of nine rounds of post-IPO financing from 2015 to 2019, amounting to a cumulative $34.3 million, to advance various mobile games, e-books, VR, chain tours and other businesses, but it had little success at that time.\\n\\nAs of the fourth quarter of 2017, its quarterly operating cash flow has been negative. Data show that the company's share price fell by more than 95% in August '17 from its previous high of A$0.20 to below A$0.01 at one point.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fRpBVIzgUl465USU1CEfi.jpg?height=715&width=1080)\\n\\nIn the second half of 2017, under pressure from ASX inquiries into its performance, Animoca Brands undertook three reforms to streamline costs and boost revenue: restructuring directors' pay, selling off non-core assets, and laying off staff, including a 50% pay cut for all executives. During the year, the company sold 318 of its 524 handheld games - most of which were casual games - for a total of $8 million, and reduced its workforce from more than 110 to less than 70.\\n\\nBy early November this year, the company had 527 employees worldwide and had become an NFT track giant. What happened in between?\\n\\nThe change began in early 2018, when Animoca Brands Executive Chairman and co-founder Yat Siu told Chain Catcher that Animoca Brands acquired a game company that had been involved in the development of Cryptokitties, the incipient blockchain game that was hot at the time.\\n\\n\\\"This was our first involvement with blockchain gaming and NFT. we immediately realized the power and benefits in between and how NFT would revolutionize the existing gaming industry by providing digital property rights to players,\\\" Yat Siu said. since then, Animoca Brands has been focusing on NFT-based games.\\n\\nIn January 2018, Animoca Brands signed a one-year licensing and distribution agreement with Axiom Zen, the development team of Cryptokitties. animoca Brands has the right to distribute Cryptokitties exclusively in China, with a 30% share of net revenue.\\n\\nIn August of the same year, Animoca Brands acquired Pixowl, the developer of UGC (user-generated content) game platform The Sandbox, which had more than 1 million monthly active users at the time, according to an announcement from Animoca Brands. In addition, Pixowl has plans to launch a blockchain version of the game.\\n\\n\\\"We acquired Pixowl and Sandbox for less than $5 million, which proved to be a very successful investment,\\\" Yat Siu said to Chain Catcher.\\n\\nThe Sandbox is currently one of the most successful projects under Animoca Brands. As of December 21, The Sandbox token SAND has a total market cap of $4.7 billion in circulation, ranking 37th in the Coinmarketcap market ranking, while the diluted market cap reaches $15.3 billion. Meanwhile, The Sandbox's virtual land trading volume is high, with Republic Realm breaking the virtual land sales price record with a $4.3 million purchase on Nov. 30.\\n\\nYat Siu told Chain Catcher that there were a number of opportunities for this acquisition in '18, including the fact that one of Pixowl's backers, Martin Varsavsky, is a close entrepreneurial friend of Yat Siu, that Pixowl has built up a reputation for brand IP, etc., \\\"but most importantly, Pixowl and its founders have deep insight into blockchain and NFT.\\\" Yat Siu believes that these elements will enable the team to gain a leading position in both blockchain and traditional gaming.\\n\\nSubsequently, in October and November, Animoca Brands invested in Decentraland and Dapper Labs, respectively. in January '18, Animoca Brands partnered again with the WAX blockchain to introduce user-generated items to its game The Sandbox on the WAX platform, while the two sides swapped interests, exchanging $250,000 worth of the company's stock for 250,000 worth of the company's stock in exchange for WAX tokens.\\n\\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2018, Animoca Brands' revenue continued to be primarily supported by revenue from traditional handheld game sales, with cryptocurrency-related investments generating only a million dollar loss.\\n\\nIn November 2019, Animoca Brands completed another significant investment, leading a $1.465 million funding round in Axie Infinity developer Sky Mavis for $420,000 - Axie Infinity had by then emerged at the top of the chain game revenue The company also raised $1.465 million through partnerships and acquisitions. At the same time, it also acquired the IP rights of Formula 1, MLB, Bundesliga and other sports through cooperation and acquisition, accumulating resources for blockchain games and NFT development in the direction of sports IP.\\n\\nJust at this time, ASX halfway through the inquiry letter and delisting warning.\\n\\nAccording to Animoca Brands' subsequent disclosure, ASX alleged three issues with the company: internal governance issues, significant involvement in cryptocurrency-related activities, and trading irregularities. The company did not back down from the accusations regarding its involvement in crypto activities, while in response to the internal governance issues, Animoca Brands acknowledged alleged irregular practices in its operations, but did not release details.\\n\\nIn March 2020, the ASX formally removed Animoca Brands from its listing list, citing \\\"a lack of adequate resources, systems and controls to meet its obligations under the Listing Rules\\\". At that time, the company had a total market capitalization of $124 million.\\n\\nIn fact, the impact of the delisting was more reputational than beneficial - its stock price had rarely risen significantly in the five years of the public offering. Instead, the delisting gives Animoca Brands the room to flex its muscles and move into the deeper waters of the NFT space without being caught up in concerns about violating public company rules.\\n\\nIn 2020, Animoca Brands focused more on the development and expansion of its own assets: The Sandbox publicly launched its SAND token and went live on Coinan, its F1 Delta Time game launched its token REVV, while ecological activities such as NFT pledge mining and NFT auctions also went live from time to time.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Animoca Brands has acquired at least 9 crypto companies in recent years, including NFT marketplace QUIDD, sports NFT ecosystem Olympo, prediction market project Prosper, indie game developer Blowfish Studios, NFT solution provider Bondly, etc.\\n\\nCurrently, at least eight of Animoca Brands' subsidiaries have issued tokens, but with the exception of The Sandbox, which was acquired, the other projects have been mediocre in terms of market impact and token prices. Next, Animoca Brands plans to launch the 3A-rated chain game Phantom Galaxies next year, and to partner with the well-known NFT project Bored Ape Yacht Club to launch a new game in the second quarter of next year.\\n\\n**Second, more like a16z in the NFT space than a game developer**\\n\\nWhile Animoca Brands spent its first three years in the crypto scene expanding its network of resources and building internally like any newbie in transition, recently the company has been reaching out more into the crypto industry through wide-ranging investments to build a massive ecosystem around NFT and the metaverse.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uGZevbUyk2_VmOEryHxs5.jpg?height=289&width=1080)\\n\\nThe pace of Animoca Brands' investments has increased significantly heading into 2021. As of December 24, Animoca Brands has made a total of at least 81 crypto-related public investments, including well-known projects such as Yield Guild Games, Bloktopia, GuildFi, ConsenSys, DeHorizon and others. In addition the number of investments made in the fourth quarter of this year accounted for 51% of the year, with over 36% of the projects led.\\n\\nIn December, Animoca Brands also launched a $200 million chain tour investment fund jointly with BSC, and the frequency of investment will probably continue to be fast-paced in the future. Currently, the company's website shows that it has invested in over 150 NFT/meta-universe projects in total.\\n\\nYat Siu told Chain Catcher that he believes that in the blockchain space, projects related to the meta-universe are more likely to drive adoption by mainstream groups. And \\\"NFT represents the best opportunity to achieve an open meta-universe,\\\" Yat Siu stated.\\n\\nThe size of Animoca Brands investments and the number of lead investments grew significantly in 2021, with an average of one investment made every six days. This is not unrelated to Animoca's own revenue boost and large funding rounds.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2n8DSLteXoGeYRfWCkp1o.jpg?height=839&width=1080)\\n\\nAccording to Animoca Brands' earnings report released in early December, Animoca Brands' total revenue from January to September this year was $670 million, of which revenue from investments and digital asset gains accounted for 79%, or about $529.6 million. As of the end of November, the company held digital assets with a reserve value of approximately $15.87 billion, including $112.1 million in mainstream tokens such as BTC, ETH and USDC, and $456.3 million in third-party liquid assets such as AXS and FLOW, in addition to mostly eco-currency assets such as SAND.\\n\\nIn addition, Animoca Brands also received several rounds of large capital injections in May, July and October this year respectively, with star capitals in crypto and traditional fields including Coinbase Ventures, Samsung Ventures, Sequoia China, Blue Pool and others extending olive branches, and even attracting the participation of venture capital institutions under 3A gaming giant Ubisoft, with the latest round valued at $2.2 billion.\\n\\nIn a March conversation piece on the Animoca Brands blog about \\\"Why Invest in Yield Guild Games,\\\" Yat Siu attributed the company's investment spree to an \\\"ecosystem argument. This logic means that Animoca Brands invests in the builders of the NFT ecosystem, even if the other party is a competitor, and ultimately Animoca Brands, as a chain player and producer of NFT, will again \\\"benefit from the ecosystem.\\n\\n\\\"We believe that true digital ownership (virtual property rights) is the cornerstone that underpins the entire open virtual world: ownership of digital assets allows control over them, which leads to economic freedom, which unlocks economic opportunity, which leads to GameFi opportunities and opens the way for a more equitable society. \\\" Animoca Brands said on its official website.\\n\\nIn its external claims, Yat Siu's investment choices are usually 'values' oriented, and Yat Siu told Chain Catcher that Animoca Brands prioritizes investing in projects that develop an 'open meta-universe' rather than teams that create boundaries and divides like Apple and Google.\\n\\nIn an interview with Decrypt, Yat Siu said he sees a confrontation coming between the open, decentralized digital world and the tech giants, such as the Web 2.0 social media giant Facebook, which used its name change in late October as an opportunity to portray to the public the virtual extended kingdom it is trying to build.\\n\\nYat Siu sees Facebook, Tencent and other tech giants that usually have a monopoly on data ownership as the real \\\"threat\\\" as opposed to policy regulation. And Animoca Brands' arguably 'eager' investment is to make that former open meta-universe happen sooner.\\n\\nIn fact, Animoca Brands' investment style is very reminiscent of a16z, with the same high-flying and high-frequency investments, weaving a huge network of resources and connections within the crypto ecosystem, with these headline VCs currently pushing behind many emerging crypto projects.\\n\\nHowever, this style of investment is also drawing some criticism, such as the Twitter founder's recent tweet that Web3 is not actually owned by users, but by VCs and their LPs (limited partners), and that Web3 is ultimately a centralized entity with a different label, even alluding to the fact that a16z controls the Web3 concept.\\n\\nIn his opinion, the VCs actually control a large share of the Web3 project's tokens and reap huge profits, far from their vision and contrary to the spirit of Bitcoin, which should be used to fund truly free and open source software.\\n\\nThe above comments have raised many opposing views in the crypto industry, but they have certainly brought more thoughtful perspectives on how VCs can maintain a balance between institutional and public interests, something that a16z, Animoca Brands and even other VCs may need to revisit in light of the huge controversy.\",\"timestamp\":1640591786,\"title\":\"How did Animoca Brands go from being forced to delist to becoming a big winner in the crypto market?\"},\"digest\":\"_Ps4wfq2qvIlfDCLWWa7qmtBP7OtWba5Ih7B3JZEljM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x71213a9C9504E406d3242436A4bf69c6bfE74461\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"OzT3daqIw2s53pAcFiJEUykKIMNxUbpHj2uAmh3TLrk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"IA5LmKA6TMHkvuvDRAjWg6KZZv_Ap-4E73Bar7RhJ2g\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"lLCgGsPZYDxygSiedboU16KbM0bBWtj00GSqVKUaMTIT_DQb0rsQxG01-s9ClEF6iFmI_rv2WzbL58hIpK86xw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x09d429f19f77adc88b548773ca76cad9265ffae9a03726091ab384d40a6330cf652d12390d5279f105b0636a01839a3efeb78f137b4303daf9684e3dee4b431c1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"OzT3daqIw2s53pAcFiJEUykKIMNxUbpHj2uAmh3TLrk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"IA5LmKA6TMHkvuvDRAjWg6KZZv_Ap-4E73Bar7RhJ2g\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"_Ps4wfq2qvIlfDCLWWa7qmtBP7OtWba5Ih7B3JZEljM\"}"
