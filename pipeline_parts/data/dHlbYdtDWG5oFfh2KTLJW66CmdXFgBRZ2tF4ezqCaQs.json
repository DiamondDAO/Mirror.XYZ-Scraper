"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*The Web3 Delta series examines vital differences between Web2 and Web3.*\\n\\nWhen I launched web2.0 products, my first task was to find users. Web3 turns this upside down. Now, I have access to every user even before building anything. Each user is a wallet on the blockchain.\\n\\nLet's explore what this means, how this works, and how to navigate cryptocurrency through wallets.\\n\\n# What is a Wallet\\n\\nA wallet holds the keypairs that allow us to send and receive cryptocurrency. Keys are a list of numbers and letters between 0 and 9 and A to F. This system is called **hexadecimal**, or hex, because there are 16 different options: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f.\\n\\nThere are two keys in each wallet: a public key and a private key. The public key is available to anyone and represents the 'user.' A private key is longer than the public key, and you generally have to do some work to see it. You never share this, and you rarely even look at it.\\n\\nYou can use a public key to sign up for new token airdrops or certain discord groups. We will discuss this in more detail below.\\n\\nPublic keys are the new email addresses.\\n\\nHere is an example of one of mine: 0x30e5Dc795dBf1F26D5b205C593A3108fc8f6BA8 that I copied from my browser based [metamask](https://metamask.io/) wallet.\\n\\n# Finding the others\\n\\nWe surfed the web in web2.0 — we went from link to link, from URL to URL. The foundational nature of the URL was not initially evident. Google capitalized on this with their [page rank algorithm](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs54n/handouts/24-GooglePageRankAlgorithm.pdf), which led to their search engine's success.\\n\\nWe now surf wallets via blockchain explorers.\\n\\nSocial tokens are a type of cryptocurrency that focuses on building communities for token holders. For example, we can go to Forefront Market and look at the top social tokens. I may own Pounds or Bitcoin, but I use these instruments to buy things or accumulate wealth. Their main utility is not in building interpersonal relationships with other Pound or Bitcoin users. I do not think of myself as part of a bitcoin community or Pound user community.\\n\\nHere is an example of the social token $RAC, issued by the Grammy-award-winning musician.\\n\\nI can see the top holders on the right — their public key identifies them.\\n\\n# Webpage vs. Wallet\\n\\nI am going to click on one of the top owners, the one with the pink unicorn: 0xf744417d0a5fd18b5b18726ce1b48f931dfa32ea.\\n\\nNow I am at an [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf744417d0a5fd18b5b18726ce1b48f931dfa32ea) page. Etherscan is another blockchain explorer that provides detailed information on wallet activity.\\n\\nI can see the history of transactions. I can see the first transaction was from georgio.eth. I can see that all these transactions happened on Uniswap.\\n\\nWhen I click on the ERC20 tab, I get a more granular view of all the transactions.\\n\\nI have the transaction in the first column, the date in the second, the sender's wallet in the 3rd and the receiver's wallet in the fourth. And finally, I have the token in the last column. Here it is mostly the $RAC token and [wrapped eth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52LOwqnRRrk). Wrapped Ethereum (wEth) allows Ethereum to transact with different tokens and cryptocurrencies. Users may not always be aware this is happening, and that is ok. But the transparency of web3 allows us to peek under the hood.\\n\\nAs you see, some addresses are names, and some are hexadecimal strings. The name is an ens domain. It is similar to a webpage domain name. Anyone can go and buy an [ens name](https://ens.domains/) for their wallet. Then, that name will appear in transactions instead of the hexadecimal public key.\\n\\nEns names make it easier to read a list of transactions. Here I see rvboss.eth. It is the only address that is not hexadecimal or an exchange.\\n\\nI click on rvboss.eth. That brings me to a new Etherscan page with all of rvboss. eth's transactions. There is a new tab here for Erc721, in addition to Erc20. Erc721 is the Ethereum protocol for NFTs. When I see that tab, it means the user has some NFTs.\\n\\nThen, we go to an NFT blockchain explorer, like [Opensea](https://opensea.io/), and enter the user's public key into the search bar. When I do this, the rvboss account pops up, and I can select it to browse the NFT collection.\\n\\n# A Good Neighbor\\n\\nBlockchain lets us transfer assets, but we still want to know what those assets are and the users. If I know someone's address, I can send them tokens and NFTs. However, that does not mean I should. If I receive a token from someone I don't know or don't share community with, it is like receiving spam. There is also the danger of receiving [scam](https://www.morganlinton.com/found-a-random-nft-in-your-wallet-interacting-with-it-could-be-a-big-mistake/) tokens that access your entire wallet.\\n\\nCommunity in web3 allows us to connect with one another beyond buying and selling. Platforms like discord, signal, and jitsi enable token holders to communicate with one another. Future leaders of web3 companies will be community organizers, not software developers.\\n\\n# What Next?\\n\\nIn web3, users and wallets are the connective tissue, not web pages, and links.\\n\\nWe can use explorers like [Etherscan](http://etherscan.io/), [Forefront](http://etherscan.io/), and [Opensea](https://opensea.io/) to understand users and token communities. What sorts of dApps, decentralized applications, can we build to navigate this space? A web3.0 organization could create something elegant and automated. Web2.0 companies like Amazon or Salesforce appear unbeatable, but there will be a new web3.0 centric salesforce that complements our web3.0 wallet-centric universe.\\n\\nThank you for reading. These are concepts that I am developing, and I welcome thoughts and comments.\",\"timestamp\":1642165035,\"title\":\"Web3 Deltas: Users and Wallets\"},\"digest\":\"Lpm2zYoDROUGRw-jQHcVQqi2dUr0SvoQOGT_984y2mU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xF88593a3b58B069bCcE2b50cC502C9BF8Ba5b248\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7bkiuxZkYF9aaLWFgRC6U4PmaUPNJ8_1ilh3i3FGwjM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"O9Xu6kPMTcNCBB5vKswJUc4CkMeRX2fmGSgzpXMz-_8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Td64BalcHQtHtiOKWwZqt9ewMmFAHTUMua6QtOG1sI7bjH24mt7lCBr4K5v89VW0Wl1YaguvnSqRS217Y3Pz0A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9143c82900ecb92fa6ca37ded95b41b399f96d7751cbd0ee8566ee21ff8a52836d44229ddccdf8fc27af08e66c0257286cef49977b723e7ab71650be32d5657c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7bkiuxZkYF9aaLWFgRC6U4PmaUPNJ8_1ilh3i3FGwjM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"O9Xu6kPMTcNCBB5vKswJUc4CkMeRX2fmGSgzpXMz-_8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Lpm2zYoDROUGRw-jQHcVQqi2dUr0SvoQOGT_984y2mU\"}"
