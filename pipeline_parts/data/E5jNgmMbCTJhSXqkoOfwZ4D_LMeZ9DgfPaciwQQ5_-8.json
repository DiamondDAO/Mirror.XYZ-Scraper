This development involves a continuous synthesis of coordination and conflict.\\n\\nMulticellular life arises significantly due to the benefits of coordination between single-celled organisms (whether of the same or different species).[\\\\[2\\\\]](#_ftn2)\\n\\nAll living cells are either prokaryotic (single cell) or eukaryotic (multi-cellular). Animals, plants, and fungi evolved from single cell bacteria that competed, acquired, and coordinated with each other to gain function as more complex life-forms. It is also undoubtedly the case that many complex multicellular life-forms derive great benefits from distinct individual life-forms grouping together.\\n\\nIn addition to cooperative behavior, much of human civilisation appears to be driven equally, or more, as a result of conflict between coordinated groups (and in respect of our technological development, all the more so). Whether this conflict is cross-species or intra-species, the result is that — in a real way — we are, to a large extent, products of a ‘kill or be killed’ competitive environment.\\n\\n#### “Beneath our superficial differences we are all of us walking communities of bacteria. The world shimmers, a pointillist landscape made of tiny living beings.”\\n\\n(*Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan*)\\\\[3\\\\]\\n\\n![‘a pointillist landscape made of tiny living beings’, algo-art by Peter Pink-Howitt 2021 CE](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*9i9zUDRTd4dH4NiFey-Krg.jpeg)\\n\\nPerhaps this coordination-competition process could be compared in its working to the processes involved in natural selection, with the underlying driving force being more cooperative. Fitness for life within the environment largely arises from the extent to which any particular cooperative structure or behaviour is beneficial within the competitive landscape.\\n\\n#### “Life resembles a fractal…The ‘fractals’ of life are cells, arrangements of cells, many-celled organisms, communities of organisms, and ecosystems of communities. Repeated millions of times over thousands of millions of years, the processes of life have led to the wonderful three-dimensional patterns seen in organisms, hives, cities and planetary life as a whole.”\\n\\n(*Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan*)\\\\[4\\\\]\\n\\nThe results of the forces of cooperation and conflict appear to be satisfactorily described by evolutionary theory. This universal dynamic between cooperation and conflict means that we must look more carefully at behavioural theories which take account of these forces. This requires us to consider game theory when seeking to develop any ethical framework.\\n\\nFailure of any ethical theory to take account of the sometimes super-aggressive nature of nature could be fatal — logically and literally. These tensions are embodied in the hawk-dove dichotomy found within social groups, when there is the potential for cooperation or conflict and the stakes are high. The dichotomy merely reflects the careful balance that is needed between the two necessary forces of cooperation and conflict.\\n\\nThe risk of failure of theories that cannot take account of extreme risks can be seen particularly in those ethical theories that work very well (or best) when the equilibrium between cooperation and conflict is more carefully balanced (e.g., the non-violent resistance of Martin Luther King, Jr. or Gandhi), but which may break down under extreme stress when the equilibrium resolves into a kill-or-be-killed dynamic (the appeasement of Nazi Germany; ‘dark forest’ conjectures).\\n\\n## 3.1. Negative Capability in Evolution\\n\\n![Werner Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle states that the position and the momentum of an object cannot both be measured exactly simultaneously, even in theory. The greater the degree of accuracy in measuring where something ‘is’, the less that can be known about where it is ‘going’ and vice versa.](https://miro.medium.com/max/860/1\\\\*VONLN0kE_pqnJM21jig9Lw.png)\\n\\n#### “Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself, (I am large, I contain multitudes.)”\\n\\n(*Walt Whitman*)\\\\[5\\\\]\\n\\nOne of the great difficulties we face in seeking a universal basis for an ethics between diverse life-forms is the need to manage the tension between:\\n\\n(i) the desire to seek and codify action-governing rules (or normative values) into communicable laws — the positive approach; and\\n\\n(ii) the requirement of the wise to always leave room for flexibility, adaptability, humility and a degree of irreducible uncertainty — Keats called this ‘negative capability’.\\n\\n#### “I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts”\\n\\n(*John Keats*)\\\\[6\\\\]\\n\\nTo the benefit of biological life-forms on Earth, nature has synthesised the above dialectic tension neatly — primarily by way of two main interacting forces:\\n\\n(i) mutation or compound changes in inherited traits (biological natural law); and\\n\\n(ii) natural selection (adaptative success driven by the application of the natural law to ever-changing circumstances).\\n\\nGiven the right conditions, the operation of this mindless process of variation, fitness and luck with the addition of algorithmic efficiency has given rise to all the wonderful rich diversity of life-forms we see around us (including ourselves). Evolution is therefore a very intelligent strategy that has apparently occurred in the absence of conscious wisdom (though the debate about the ultimate origins or originator of life continues).\\n\\n#### “Life is like stepping onto a boat which is about to sail out to sea and sink.”\\n\\n(*Shunryū Suzuki*)\\\\[7\\\\]\\n\\nIn effect, Darwin and others discovered that negative capability is a foundation of evolutionary ‘fitness’ in a changing world full of uncertainty (entropy) — for places and times when the circumstances and requirements for success can never be entirely predetermined and death is inevitable.\\n\\nEvolutionary theory shows that nature has done an extraordinary thing by being ready for an uncertain future by way of imperfect replication, genetic[\\\\[8\\\\]](#_ftn8) variance (freedom of action) and redundancy. There is something admirable and humbling about this successful natural logic that has been in play for billions of years.\\n\\nGiven the indisputable success of the evolutionary strategy,[\\\\[9\\\\]](#_ftn9) one would expect that any efforts to successfully code for non-human artificial intelligence (AI) would require much greater use of randomness/entropic and diversity algorithms to interact with positive task-focused algorithms (with all the dangers that arise from the same).\\n\\nInteresting newer theories of evolution also point to the more fundamental relationship of life with entropy and energy, which will be explored later in this book.\\n\\n![‘Time - destroyer of all’, algo-art by Peter Pink-Howitt 2021 CE](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*7L0YqFJoVo8xFLk1Xoqdtw.jpeg)\\n\\nNone of us know what the future holds. Extinction for most life-forms could be heading Earth’s way at any time (whether by aggressive aliens, dumb rocks or simply chance’s strange arithmetic). Our decisions and our laws must also reflect the essential uncertainty of life within the universe and the sheer improbability of being right each time.\\n\\nOur treatment of other life-forms must also reflect our absolute lack of knowledge about what code or logic will prove to have value in different unforeseeable conditions over deep time.\\n\\n#### “I am time, the destroyer of all”\\n\\n(*Bhagavad Gita*)\\\\[10\\\\]\\n\\n![Hilma af Klint, “Group X, №1, Altarpiece”, 1907 CE, Wikipedia.org public domain. Courtesy The Hilma af Klint Foundation, Stockholm. \\\\[9\\\\]](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QXwKZolx3TQOP-BrAAUw1.jpeg?height=3500&width=2670&)\\n\\nOur consideration of AI (and other life-forms) must also have in mind that in very challenging circumstances these life-forms (as potential extremophiles) may be the only things that would allow life from Earth to continue its extraordinary experiment with energy and entropy. One can easily imagine circumstances where accumulated codes and cultures can only survive in another format carried by a being that is much more suited to the digital realm and the extreme conditions of space (AI as Ark,[\\\\[11\\\\]](#_ftn11) if you like).\\n\\nAny deeper ethics or laws that we wish to discover or create should try to follow a similar approach to nature’s use of negative capability. We must distinguish between the verifiable foundation for laws and the appropriate understanding and application of the laws (the principles), given the need for those laws to apply to new information and changing conditions. We must always leave room for uncertainty, humility and mystery in the face of complexity, chance, hubris and hidden information.\\n\\n#### “Try and penetrate with our limited means the secrets of nature and you will find that, behind all the discernible laws and connections, there remains something subtle, intangible and inexplicable. Veneration for this force beyond anything that we can comprehend is my religion. To that extent I am, in fact, religious.”\\n\\n(*Albert Einstein*)\\\\[12\\\\]\\n\\n![Kano Eino, “Birds and Flowers of Spring and Summer”, 1600s CE, Wikipedia.org, public domain.\\\\[13\\\\]](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D_U5kwhbjhoh-3VLeuDra.jpeg?height=1139&width=2560&&&&&size=large)\\n\\n## 3.2. Optimality and Game Theory\\n\\n#### “Malaclypse: ‘Everyone is hurting each other, the planet is rampant with injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own people, mothers imprison sons, children perish while brothers war.’\\n\\n#### Goddess: ‘What is the matter with that, if it’s what you want to do?’\\n\\n#### Malaclypse: ‘But nobody wants it! Everybody hates it!’\\n\\n#### Goddess: ‘Oh. Well, then stop.’”\\n\\n\\\\[14\\\\]\\n\\nThe economic system of human interactions is at root amoral and heartless. It has no independent consciousness. This is why slavery is so persistent, notwithstanding the human horror of it all. Like science, economics and trade require ethics to moderate them. In addition, a purely individual-centric approach (whether ethical, capitalist or otherwise) to resource allocation will always lead to suboptimal outcomes when considering the aggregate impact on all humans and other life-forms.\\n\\n#### “However, when the strategies are formed from an observer’s angle whose main motive is to wish for the best outcome for every player; that is, when strategies are formed from a socially balanced viewpoint, then the outcome is known as a Pareto optimal outcome.”\\n\\n[\\\\[15\\\\]](#_ftn15) \\n\\nWith limited resources, we must coordinate and agree how to secure more Pareto-optimal[\\\\[16\\\\]](#_ftn16) outcomes in cases where inequality is permitted as being equitable and useful freedom of action. Given the absence of a blank slate and the likelihood of pre-existing power asymmetries, an ethical framework must foster outcomes that lead to a higher aggregate payoff for the sum of all affected life-forms — though it may lead to a reduction in benefit for one or more life-forms (utility-optimal outcomes).\\n\\nUtility-optimal solutions are potential solutions to our ‘dark forest’ nightmares and ‘prisoner’s dilemma’ sub-optimal outcomes (individual dominant strategies that often benefit the most self-centred and aggressive amongst us). The main question is whether we can identify a scientific foundation that incorporates the value of as wide and diverse a range of life-forms as possible to be part of our ethical assessment of relevant action and outcomes.\\n\\nThis is an entirely self-protecting but not self-centred pursuit.\\n\\n#### “If you do good, you do good for your own selves, and if you do evil (you do it) against yourselves.”\\n\\n[\\\\[17\\\\]](#_ftn17) \\n\\nAs I write this, I am inclined to see the long-standing schism between philosophy and hard science as unbridgeable, and yet we must endeavour. The effort alone has some utility.\\n\\n#### “May we with all beings realize the emptiness of the three wheels, giver, receiver, and gift.”\\n\\n(*a Zen grace*)\\n\\n![Hasegawa Tōhaku,\\\\* “Pine Trees”, \\\\*1539–1610 CE, Wikipedia.org, public domain.\\\\[18\\\\] ](https://miro.medium.com/max/5118/1\\\\*8a2uA-Efwgu24b1Y7dXn0Q.jpeg?&&&&&&size=large)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n[\\\\[1\\\\]](#_ftnref1) Edwin Muir, “[The child dying](https://allpoetry.com/The-Child-Dying)”, from\\\\* Selected Poems\\\\*, 1965 CE.
