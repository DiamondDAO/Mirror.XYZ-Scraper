S. Eliot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._S._Eliot). Eliot's work fundamentally changed literary thinking and *Selected Essays* provides both an overview and an in-depth examination of his theory.[\\\\[1\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selected_Essays,_1917-1932#cite_note-BRags-1) It was published in 1932 by his employers, [Faber & Faber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faber_%26_Faber), costing 12/6 (*2009: £32*).[\\\\[2\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selected_Essays,_1917-1932#cite_note-2)\\n\\nIn addition to his poetry, by 1932, Eliot was already accepted as one of English Literature's most important critics. In this position he was instrumental in the reviving interest in the long‐neglected Jacobean playwrights.[\\\\[3\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selected_Essays,_1917-1932#cite_note-OCAT-3) *A Dialogue on Dramatic Poetry* was originally an addendum to Eliot's preface to Dryden's *[Essay of Dramatick Poesie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essay_of_Dramatick_Poesie)* (1928 reprint).[\\\\[4\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selected_Essays,_1917-1932#cite_note-Baden-4) Further essays include *The Metaphysical Poets (1921)* in which Eliot argued that a \\\"[dissociation of sensibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_of_sensibility)\\\" set in... due to the influence of ... [Milton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton) and [Dryden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dryden).[\\\\[5\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selected_Essays,_1917-1932#cite_note-ODQ-5) Furthermore the modern poet ‘must be difficult’... ‘to force, to dislocate if necessary, language into his meaning’.[\\\\[6\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selected_Essays,_1917-1932#cite_note-6) *Philip Massinger (1920)* contains his [aphorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphorism) \\\"Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal\\\".[\\\\[5\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selected_Essays,_1917-1932#cite_note-ODQ-5)\\n\\nEliot converted to the [Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England) and some of the essays expressed the form and discipline he felt necessary for fulfillment in his own life.[\\\\[7\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selected_Essays,_1917-1932#cite_note-7) *For Lancelot Andrewes (1926)*, examines [Andrewes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancelot_Andrewes), a 17th-century Anglican bishop whose Eliot considers an important figure in history of the church, distinguished for the quality of his thoughts and prose.[\\\\[8\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selected_Essays,_1917-1932#cite_note-Lance-8) In *The Humanism of Irving Babbitt (1927)*, Eliot posits that [Babbitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Babbitt)'s faith in civilization must have a discipline derived from dogmatic religious authority.[\\\\[8\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selected_Essays,_1917-1932#cite_note-Lance-8)\\n\\nIn 1951 Eliot republished the book as *Selected Essays*, with a new preface and 5 additional essays (listed below). These were all written within 3 years of the original 1932 publication. Eliot notes several essays not collected in this edition but declares *Selected Essays* to already be 'bulky enough'.\",\"timestamp\":1641632628,\"title\":\"Selected Essays, 1917-1932\"},\"digest\":\"WHlB_G0ZusNw7XUVX9UV0OWLwwF1OE5m7Zzexq2SBrs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x94544E7A620E8c6FE80F0436C5586CBDEc3e0de0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4VBj-DrBYqbONuuT_v7ZDnVHoPA9jutGR0MNhta1a7Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QqTx5YvVzpXH_J8yTGdsSVBwblEv8Yi6przvjbofxcs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"RQvZPW-U4dmtX75Z46OTJh-c7YplxneKVZE8vIFudfNphChYFwWUT2vEnU9rY4fL_Ttebuamtm8iSqaCEerCYQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x3d6b6f7ce2c9a20155477f13048b1b3acc99f7cabfaf78d7d01097bf3739d60f399509de7779066ad7e92ec16c39e14a54edd5acb56548d52a34be1ce54356ec1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4VBj-DrBYqbONuuT_v7ZDnVHoPA9jutGR0MNhta1a7Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QqTx5YvVzpXH_J8yTGdsSVBwblEv8Yi6przvjbofxcs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"WHlB_G0ZusNw7XUVX9UV0OWLwwF1OE5m7Zzexq2SBrs\"}"
