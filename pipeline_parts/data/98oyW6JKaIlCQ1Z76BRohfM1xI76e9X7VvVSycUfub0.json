"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"In Class IX you have learnt about various elements. You have seen\\nthat elements can be classified as metals or non-metals on the basis of\\ntheir properties.\\nn Think of some uses of metals and non-metals in your daily life.\\nn What properties did you think of while categorising elements\\nas metals or non-metals?\\nn How are these properties related to the uses of these elements?\\nLet us look at some of these properties in detail.\\n3\\\\.1 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES\\n3\\\\.1.1 Metals\\nThe easiest way to start grouping substances is by comparing their\\nphysical properties. Let us study this with the help of the following\\nactivities. For performing Activities 3.1 to 3.6, collect the samples of\\nfollowing metals â€“ iron, copper, aluminium, magnesium, sodium, lead,\\nzinc and any other metal that is easily available.\\nActivity 3.1\\nn Take samples of iron, copper, aluminium and magnesium. Note\\nthe appearance of each sample.\\nn Clean the surface of each sample by rubbing them with sand paper\\nand note their appearance again.\\nMetals, in their pure state, have a shining surface. This property is\\ncalled metallic lustre.\\nActivity 3.2\\nn Take small pieces of iron, copper, aluminium, and magnesium.\\nTry to cut these metals with a sharp knife and note your\\nobservations.\\nn Hold a piece of sodium metal with a pair of tongs.\\nCAUTION: Always handle sodium metal with care.
