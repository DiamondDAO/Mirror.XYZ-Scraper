"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The area of present-day Morocco has been inhabited since at least [Paleolithic times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic), beginning sometime between 190,000 and 90,000 BC.[\\\\[23\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco#cite_note-27) A recent publication has suggested that there is evidence for even earlier human habitation of the area: *[Homo sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens)* fossils that had been discovered in the late 2000s near the [Atlantic coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean) in [Jebel Irhoud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jebel_Irhoud) were recently dated to roughly 315,000 years ago.[\\\\[24\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco#cite_note-28) During the [Upper Paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Paleolithic), the [Maghreb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghreb) was more fertile than it is today, resembling a [savanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna), in contrast to its modern arid landscape.[\\\\[25\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco#cite_note-29) Twenty-two thousand years ago, the pre-existing [Aterian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aterian) culture was succeeded by the [Iberomaurusian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberomaurusian) culture, which shared similarities with Iberian cultures. Skeletal similarities have been suggested between the human remains found at [Iberomaurusian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberomaurusian) \\\"[Mechta-Afalou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechta-Afalou)\\\" burial sites and European [Cro-Magnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cro-Magnon) remains. The Iberomaurusian culture was succeeded by the [Beaker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaker_culture) in Morocco.\\n\\n[Mitochondrial DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA) studies have discovered a close ancestral link between [Berbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers) and the [Saami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sami_people) of Scandinavia. This evidence supports the theory that some of the peoples who had been living in the [Franco-Cantabrian refuge area of southwestern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Cantabrian_region) during the late-glacial period migrated to northern Europe, contributing to its repopulation after the last [ice age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age).[\\\\[26\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco#cite_note-30)\\n\\nIn the early part of the [Classical Antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Antiquity) period, Northwest Africa and Morocco were slowly drawn into the wider emerging [Mediterranean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean) world by the [Phoenicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicians), who established trading colonies and settlements there, the most substantial of which were [Chellah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chellah), [Lixus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lixus_(ancient_city)), and [Mogador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogador).[\\\\[27\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco#cite_note-31) Mogador was established as a Phoenician colony as early as the 6th century BC.[\\\\[28\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco#cite_note-32)\\\\[*[page needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources)*\\\\]\\n\\nRoman ruins of [Volubilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volubilis).\\n\\nMorocco later became a realm of the Northwest African civilisation of [ancient Carthage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Carthage), and part of the Carthaginian empire. The earliest known independent Moroccan state was the [Berber kingdom of Mauretania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauretania), under King [Baga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baga_(king)).[\\\\[29\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco#cite_note-33) This ancient kingdom (not to be confused with the modern state of [Mauritania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritania)) flourished around 225 BC or earlier.\\n\\n[Mauretania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauretania) became a [client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_state) kingdom of the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire) in 33 BC. Emperor [Claudius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius) annexed Mauretania directly in 44 AD, making it a [Roman province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_province) ruled by an imperial [governor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor) (either a *procurator Augusti*, or a *legatus Augusti pro praetore*).\\n\\nDuring the so-called \\\"[crisis of the 3rd century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_3rd_century),\\\" parts of Mauretania were reconquered by Berber tribes. As a result, by the late 3rd century, direct Roman rule had become confined to a few coastal cities, such as Septum ([Ceuta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceuta)) in [Mauretania Tingitana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauretania_Tingitana) and [Cherchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherchell) in [Mauretania Caesariensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauretania_Caesariensis). When, in 429 AD, the area was devastated by the [Vandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandals), the Roman Empire lost its remaining possessions in Mauretania, and local [Mauro-Roman kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauro-Roman_kingdom) assumed control of them. In the 530s, the [Eastern Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire), under Byzantine control, re-established direct imperial rule of Septum and [Tingi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tingi), fortified Tingis, and erected a church.\",\"timestamp\":1635436670,\"title\":\"Prehistory and antiquity\"},\"digest\":\"pVJ9n4vCwHanvwnSypuJHD_ggCdtTGxTV6tKjZYjxV4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x81f45C6B0c5b36Efc321d9511ff84DfE6263D3B7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"R98-AwUOKTJ5Unp-LVkNoWKWK1Vvf3w42WEZ6FUwcXQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xqr8eSd4MVsattN6ztm3DHC0P6TlMjSqlJRPYUiDXjE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"QXr542ucBwBwpwejR-w2aWzZHt4s37QmgRcoi78B97qTVGbbvOhR49h03I-bkRF5MURqXvJkQPb51cSSV3F6Jw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xbee0a82ccd46908adf9371866dac936e11209d0b76b9af06a0dcac4453dda99757dd180f00894b7c911d342b24ff9de30f7ade678224651d9a07cf50df11f4821c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"R98-AwUOKTJ5Unp-LVkNoWKWK1Vvf3w42WEZ6FUwcXQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xqr8eSd4MVsattN6ztm3DHC0P6TlMjSqlJRPYUiDXjE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"pVJ9n4vCwHanvwnSypuJHD_ggCdtTGxTV6tKjZYjxV4\"}"
