"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Hello everyone, I am flames.\\n\\nThe blockchain industry is developing rapidly, and many public chains have also emerged in the crypto world. Due to their own characteristics and advantages, these public chains have attracted a group of users belonging to their own platforms and applications deployed on their chains. However, people in the blockchain involoving different activities are not limited to only one chain, but participate in projects and build ecosystems on multiple public chains. When exploring the world of blockchain, people always feel cross-chain experience is very annoying because we cannot participate in the project of chain B on the Dapp deployed on chain A. In order to move our assets to another chain, we may have to use Anyswap, Polygon Bridges, Fantom Anyswap Bridge or other DAPPs to complete cross-chain asset transfer. At the same time, we will also find that some project parties will redeploy a dapp on another chain in order to replicate their successful business model.  In the end, the inconvenience of cross-chain experience is attributed to the inability to \\\"communicate\\\" between chains, and Axelar is a decentralized network built for cross-chain communication to solve this problem.\\n\\n![Axelar Network](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3RZAfErTVWK6sYOpLdqk4.png?height=411&width=1038)\\n\\n### Axelar Network Introduction\\n\\nAxelar Network is a decentralized network built to support cross-chain communication of heterogeneous blockchains. Axelar consists of protocol suites, tools and APIs. Network validators provide support for the decentralized network, and participants can use the Axelar network to realize cross-chain communication.\\n\\n![Complex Mechanisms](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tmQwyJz1Jj90B1XxqOovH.png?height=650&width=650)\\n\\nThe Axelar network adopts an instant finality Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPOS) consensus mechanism, that Axelar blockchain works in a partially synchronous setting and thus requires the fault tolerance is smaller than 1/3, which is similar with the consensus mechanism of Cosmos Hub. The threshold signature scheme adopts distributed n-party protocols T.Keygen, T.Sign to ensure the security and robustness. More details can be found in the whitepaper.\\n\\nHere we mainly explain the core protocols that Axelar relies on for cross-chain communication, Cross-Chain Gateway Protocol (CGP) and Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CTP), which can help us understand the working principles of Axelar Network.\\n\\n**Cross-Chain Gateway Protocol (CGP)：**\\n\\nThis protocol is analogous to Border Gateway Protocol on the Internet. The main working principle is that this protocol can exchange information between different public chains, including asset transfer and state synchronization. After receiving the request, each validator must run the node software of the public chains that need to be interacted with, and the consensus is formed in the Axelar Network, and then the asset or information is passed to another chain. In this process, public chain developers can also easily make cross-chain requests without make any changes to themselves.\\n\\n![CGP Operating Principle](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nBW50Cp0X5byua3Hmzfoy.png?height=772&width=1144)\\n\\n**Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CTP)：**\\n\\nCTP is an application-level protocol that makes it easy for applications to leverage cross-chain features. The main working principle is that when the user needs to interact between the two public chains, such as deposits, withdrawals and account interoperation, etc., after the user submits the request, the public chain A generates instructions, which are converted into instructions based on the Axelar Network CTP protocol by calling the cross-link port (API), and then connect and transmit to the public chain B, if the public chain B can receive instructions based on the CTP protocol, it means that the user can make cross-chain requests and complete the service. Developers can also make some cross-chain state synchronization updates.\\n\\n### Comparison\\n\\nCosmos and Polkadot are also able to conduct cross-chain communication, but there are differences between them, and they are also quite different from Axelar Network.\\n\\nCosmos uses a bridge-hub model that connects Tendermint chains. The system can have multiple hubs (the primary being the \\\"Cosmos Hub\\\"), but each hub connects a group of exterior chains, called \\\"zones\\\". Each zone is responsible for securing the chain with a sufficiently staked and decentralized validator set. Zones send messages and tokens to each other via the hub using a protocol called Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC). As zones do not share state, a re-organization of one zone would not re-organize other zones, meaning each message is trust-bound by the recipient's trust in the security of the sender.\\n\\n![Cosmos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GY3YTJFWWjyjXMc6YRTDd.png?height=512&width=1440)\\n\\nThe cross-chain communication of Polkadot is achieved through the Cross-Chain-Message-Passing protocol (XCMP).Its relay chain is similar to the Cosmos Hub and the parachains on Polkadot are like the zones connecting to the Cosmos Hub. It should be noted that the security of parachains on Polkadot relies on the relay chain. All validators in Polkadot are on the Relay Chain, while parachains have collators, who construct and propose parachain blocks to validators. By the way, parachains has to rewards contributors who stake their DOT on the crowloans to win the slot, and the release of the slots are decided by the community of Polkadot.\\n\\n![Polkadot](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kHg5XI9H4T6c6LScnIkRJ.png?height=1072&width=2048)\\n\\nXCMP is a protocol for communication among homogeneous parachains under Polkadot’s consensus. And IBC is a standard for communication among Cosmos SDK chains  (different trust models). Compared with Axelar Network, IBC protocol and XCMP protocol only support cross-chain communication of homogeneous chains, and since Cosmos Hub and the relay chain of Polkadot do not support EVM natively, their zones or parachains may have to support EVM compatibility by extending themselves , and there is currently no feasible way to realize their cross-chain communication with Ethereum.\\n\\n**Features**\\n\\nAxelar Network will bring a big difference to the blockchain world. First, blockchain builders can easily connect to other networks through Axelar Network. Second, the developers of dapps can deploy contracts on a chain, and they can use the CTP API to interact with other chains and hence can enjoy the ecosystem benefits of other public chains. Finally, for users, people can realize cross-chain asset transfer and cross-chain application interaction in a wallet or a dapp.\\n\\n### Team & Backers\\n\\nThe co-founders of Axelar Network's team, Sergey Gorbunov and Georgios Vlachos, both from MIT, are also founding team members at Algorand. In addition, there are several well-known developers and PhDs with many years of experience to build this project.\\n\\nExcellent projects are bound to win the favor of investors.
