"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"FROM my father I received the best inheritance, namely a \\\"good\\n\\ntemper.\\\" \\\"And who was my father?\\\" That has nothing to do with the good\\n\\ntemper; but I will say he was lively, good-looking round, and fat;\\n\\nhe was both in appearance and character a complete contradiction to\\n\\nhis profession. \\\"And pray what was his profession and his standing\\n\\nin respectable society?\\\" Well, perhaps, if in the beginning of a\\n\\nbook these were written and printed, many, when they read it, would\\n\\nlay the book down and say, \\\"It seems to me a very miserable title, I\\n\\ndon't like things of this sort.\\\" And yet my father was not a\\n\\nskin-dresser nor an executioner; on the contrary, his employment\\n\\nplaced him at the head of the grandest people of the town, and it\\n\\nwas his place by right. He had to precede the bishop, and even the\\n\\nprinces of the blood; he always went first,- he was a hearse driver!\\n\\nThere, now, the truth is out. And I will own, that when people saw\\n\\nmy father perched up in front of the omnibus of death, dressed in\\n\\nhis long, wide, black cloak, and his black-edged, three-cornered hat\\n\\non his head, and then glanced at his round, jocund face, round as\\n\\nthe sun, they could not think much of sorrow or the grave. That face\\n\\nsaid, \\\"It is nothing, it will all end better than people think.\\\" So\\n\\nI have inherited from him, not only my good temper, but a habit of\\n\\ngoing often to the churchyard, which is good, when done in a proper\\n\\nhumor; and then also I take in the Intelligencer, just as he used to\\n\\ndo.\\n\\n```\\nI am not very young, I have neither wife nor children, nor a\\n```\\n\\nlibrary, but, as I said, I read the Intelligencer, which is enough for\\n\\nme; it is to me a delightful paper, and so it was to my father. It\\n\\nis of great use, for it contains all that a man requires to know;\\n\\nthe names of the preachers at the church, and the new books which\\n\\nare published; where houses, servants, clothes, and provisions may\\n\\nbe obtained. And then what a number of subscriptions to charities, and\\n\\nwhat innocent verses! Persons seeking interviews and engagements,\\n\\nall so plainly and naturally stated. Certainly, a man who takes in the\\n\\nIntelligencer may live merrily and be buried contentedly, and by the\\n\\nend of his life will have such a capital stock of paper that he can\\n\\nlie on a soft bed of it, unless he prefers wood shavings for his\\n\\nresting-place. The newspaper and the churchyard were always exciting\\n\\nobjects to me. My walks to the latter were like bathing-places to my\\n\\ngood humor. Every one can read the newspaper for himself, but come\\n\\nwith me to the churchyard while the sun shines and the trees are\\n\\ngreen, and let us wander among the graves. Each of them is like a\\n\\nclosed book, with the back uppermost, on which we can read the title\\n\\nof what the book contains, but nothing more. I had a great deal of\\n\\ninformation from my father, and I have noticed a great deal myself.\\n\\nI keep it in my diary, in which I write for my own use and pleasure\\n\\na history of all who lie here, and a few more beside.\\n\\n```\\nNow we are in the churchyard. Here, behind the white iron\\n```\\n\\nrailings, once a rose-tree grew; it is gone now, but a little bit of\\n\\nevergreen, from a neighboring grave, stretches out its green tendrils,\\n\\nand makes some appearance; there rests a very unhappy man, and yet\\n\\nwhile he lived he might be said to occupy a very good position. He had\\n\\nenough to live upon, and something to spare; but owing to his\\n\\nrefined tastes the least thing in the world annoyed him. If he went to\\n\\na theatre of an evening, instead of enjoying himself he would be quite\\n\\nannoyed if the machinist had put too strong a light into one side of\\n\\nthe moon, or if the representations of the sky hung over the scenes\\n\\nwhen they ought to have hung behind them; or if a palm-tree was\\n\\nintroduced into a scene representing the Zoological Gardens of Berlin,\\n\\nor a cactus in a view of Tyrol, or a beech-tree in the north of\\n\\nNorway. As if these things were of any consequence! Why did he not\\n\\nleave them alone? Who would trouble themselves about such trifles?\\n\\nespecially at a comedy, where every one is expected to be amused. Then\\n\\nsometimes the public applauded too much, or too little, to please him.\\n\\n\\\"They are like wet wood,\\\" he would say, looking round to see what sort\\n\\nof people were present, \\\"this evening; nothing fires them.\\\" Then he\\n\\nwould vex and fret himself because they did not laugh at the right\\n\\ntime, or because they laughed in the wrong places; and so he fretted\\n\\nand worried himself till at last the unhappy man fretted himself\\n\\ninto the grave.\\n\\n```\\nHere rests a happy man, that is to say, a man of high birth and\\n```\\n\\nposition, which was very lucky for him, otherwise he would have been\\n\\nscarcely worth notice. It is beautiful to observe how wisely nature\\n\\norders these things. He walked about in a coat embroidered all over,\\n\\nand in the drawing-rooms of society looked just like one of those rich\\n\\npearl-embroidered bell-pulls, which are only made for show; and behind\\n\\nthem always hangs a good thick cord for use. This man also had a\\n\\nstout, useful substitute behind him, who did duty for him, and\\n\\nperformed all his dirty work. And there are still, even now, these\\n\\nserviceable cords behind other embroidered bell-ropes. It is all so\\n\\nwisely arranged, that a man may well be in a good humor.\\n\\n```\\nHere rests,- ah, it makes one feel mournful to think of him!-\\n```\\n\\nbut here rests a man who, during sixty-seven years, was never\\n\\nremembered to have said a good thing; he lived only in the hope of\\n\\nhaving a good idea. At last he felt convinced, in his own mind, that\\n\\nhe really had one, and was so delighted that he positively died of joy\\n\\nat the thought of having at last caught an idea. Nobody got anything\\n\\nby it; indeed, no one even heard what the good thing was. Now I can\\n\\nimagine that this same idea may prevent him from resting quietly in\\n\\nhis grave; for suppose that to produce a good effect, it is\\n\\nnecessary to bring out his new idea at breakfast, and that he can only\\n\\nmake his appearance on earth at midnight, as ghosts are believed\\n\\ngenerally to do; why then this good idea would not suit the hour,\\n\\nand the man would have to carry it down again with him into the grave-\\n\\nthat must be a troubled grave.\\n\\n```\\nThe woman who lies here was so remarkably stingy, that during\\n```\\n\\nher life she would get up in the night and mew, that her neighbors\\n\\nmight think she kept a cat. What a miser she was!\\n\\n```\\nHere rests a young lady, of a good family, who would always make\\n```\\n\\nher voice heard in society, and when she sang \\\"Mi manca la voce,\\\"\\\\*\\n\\nit was the only true thing she ever said in her life.\\n\\n```\\n* \\\"I want a voice,\\\" or, \\\"I have no voice.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHere lies a maiden of another description. She was engaged to be\\n```\\n\\nmarried,- but, her story is one of every-day life; we will leave her\\n\\nto rest in the grave.\\n\\n```\\nHere rests a widow, who, with music in her tongue, carried gall in\\n```\\n\\nher heart. She used to go round among the families near, and search\\n\\nout their faults, upon which she preyed with all the envy and malice\\n\\nof her nature. This is a family grave. The members of this family held\\n\\nso firmly together in their opinions, that they would believe in no\\n\\nother. If the newspapers, or even the whole world, said of a certain\\n\\nsubject, \\\"It is so-and-so;\\\" and a little schoolboy declared he had\\n\\nlearned quite differently, they would take his assertion as the only\\n\\ntrue one, because he belonged to the family. And it is well known that\\n\\nif the yard-cock belonging to this family happened to crow at\\n\\nmidnight, they would declare it was morning, although the watchman and\\n\\nall the clocks in the town were proclaiming the hour of twelve at\\n\\nnight.\\n\\n```\\nThe great poet Goethe concludes his Faust with the words, \\\"may\\n```\\n\\nbe continued;\\\" so might our wanderings in the churchyard be continued.\\n\\nI come here often, and if any of my friends, or those who are not my\\n\\nfriends, are too much for me, I go out and choose a plot of ground\\n\\nin which to bury him or her. Then I bury them, as it were; there\\n\\nthey lie, dead and powerless, till they come back new and better\\n\\ncharacters. Their lives and their deeds, looked at after my own\\n\\nfashion, I write down in my diary, as every one ought to do. Then,\\n\\nif any of our friends act absurdly, no one need to be vexed about\\n\\nit. Let them bury the offenders out of sight, and keep their good\\n\\ntemper. They can also read the Intelligencer, which is a paper written\\n\\nby the people, with their hands guided. When the time comes for the\\n\\nhistory of my life, to be bound by the grave, then they will write\\n\\nupon it as my epitaph-\\n\\n```\\n             \\\"The man with a cheerful temper.\\\"\\n```\\n\\nAnd this is my story.\\n\\n```\\n                        THE END\\n```\\n\\n.\",\"timestamp\":1636103949,\"title\":\"FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN\"},\"digest\":\"XdlDtO5XhABNXcozbxpDqQqZ7MP-KOHcOPv_fb61XOE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xCfc76E86305228994324774C3Bdc98272a4700f3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qgJXaobCsZpA0i-upGQaj3gjL91tTTP-motwkFutDQM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8TEt536i5bY4a0INOQuJ0zlqZuERdwK5vTw75PG_mV4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"WVk8vdBiDoNn2etrCvWNlW9wxCWeGDKsTNW-zBbcwpD3DAjIt7Y8ZlxVDp4R4Jv9jjRRB6yUKdboU9tTR0IfCw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8b427cfc4c59f023444a70c7fd15a153cbe245a93544e0538591918a0d1c8ccf0c3c46669f14f00d6425a05f4bcb31c443969ab239f90a64618c9487618812b91b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qgJXaobCsZpA0i-upGQaj3gjL91tTTP-motwkFutDQM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8TEt536i5bY4a0INOQuJ0zlqZuERdwK5vTw75PG_mV4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"XdlDtO5XhABNXcozbxpDqQqZ7MP-KOHcOPv_fb61XOE\"}"
