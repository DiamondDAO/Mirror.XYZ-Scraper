A few were positioned where I would be if I had to grab someone with something I wanted.\\n\\n\\\"They're coming, their leader is the one we want to talk to.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Jacob, my family back home...\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I messaged my friends last night, from the secure room, when we found out what info was in the package. I sent it on the diplomatic message packet. I got a ping back not long after. Your grandfather, your family will be safe.\\\"\\\"\\n\\nShe nodded.\\n\\n\\\"We're going to breathe, think, and move slow now, so that we can go fast when we have to. Let's go back to that place we went to yesterday. Our faces will be remembered by the service staff.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So glad to have you back, we trust you enjoyed your first day here, table for two, perhaps the same as yesterday with a view? By the outside tables?\\n\\n\\\"Thank you, could we have a table for three please. Someone will be joining us.\\\"\\n\\nWe ordered more of that spring water we liked. We waited.

I got up and pulled a chair for her.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you. I guessed you had made us” said the crew’s leader.\\n\\nI poured a glass of spring water for our \\\"guest\\\".“A toast.
