"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The blogger-friendly motto has always been, \\\"Work from anywhere.\\\" And these days, it's easier than it's ever been to do so. With just a mobile phone in your hands, blogging has become much easier than ever. This flexibility to work anywhere and anytime you want is exactly the kind of lifestyle I dream of a time ago.\\n\\nHowever, the flip side of having the freedom to work anywhere and anytime is — well — there is no such thing as time or place as it pertains to work. And as a writer, this means that no matter where you are or what you're doing, you must always be prepared to write. If not, you risk losing those good ideas and subjects that you come across only occasionally.\\n\\nMy life as a blogger is filled with a lot of work and a little bit of play. Imagine a life where you spend a considerable amount of time sitting around a pool table, drinking coffee, sometimes watching movies, and writing about whatever comes to mind. That's my life. Plus, I have the freedom to work from anywhere there's an available WiFi connection. Thus, my work office is everywhere from the café down the street to a pool hall or my barbershop. Like I am typing this sitting beside the driver in a car.\\n\\nOf course, this is a bit easier said than done. Especially when you consider the many things that I'm constantly juggling. There is my day job, my family, my friends, my blog, my freelance writing gigs. And the list goes on. I still try to be as productive as possible no matter where I am or what I'm doing, but this is rarely an easy task (though I’m getting better at it).\\n\\nI wake up every morning at 5 am, roll out of bed, do my regular 30 minutes prayers and devotion, and turn on my mobile phone. I sit down with a cup of coffee and get to work. I work from my mobile phone because that's typically where I'll be when I get an idea for a blog post. More often than not, I'm at home on the couch when this happens. And on days when I don't have a blog post in mind, I’ll usually check my email and see if something is interesting going on in the world or my inbox that I can comment on.\\n\\nI discovered that the best thing to do is to \\\"live like a writer.\\\" That means, make your living space and your workspace as similar as possible (not an easy feat if you live in a studio apartment and work from a laptop).\\n\\nThis means — for me — there is no wall between where I sleep and where I blog. I also prefer to work out of my pajamas instead of having a predetermined outfit that is appropriate for work. This way, as I write, I can simply go about my business as if I'm not working. Since the atmosphere is less rigid, it makes it easier for me to write without feeling as if I'm stuck in a cubicle somewhere. It makes the working process much more organic and natural and it has definitely enhanced my productivity and effectiveness as a blogger.\\n\\nThere are some definite perks to working for myself. I can wake up whenever I want, choose my clothes, work wherever I want, and even eat whatever I want. When I feel like working out, I can simply go to the local football playground and kill a few hours watching local games. This is also helpful to get back your mojo for writing the next story. But as with any job, it can also be a bit stressful at times.\\n\\nBut the biggest difference between my life as a blogger and a typical 9-5 is that, as a blogger, there is no wall between where I sleep and where I blog. In fact, it’s sometimes hard to differentiate one from the other. Working from home is great in that sense because my schedule is entirely my own. Since there isn’t a cube farm to worry about, I can simply go about my business as if I'm not working.\\n\\nSurprisingly, blogging has more in common with acting than writing. Because I am a lover of language and words, I'd like to think that writing comes naturally to me, and it does. But it's not that easy. The one thing that most people don't know is that I'm a huge introvert. It's something that I've struggled with for years, so when I decided to start blogging, I was skeptical. But when I went all in to it, it eventually became so much more than just a hobby or part-time job. Blogging is now my full-time job.\\n\\nBlogging has impacted my life in so many more ways than I could ever imagine. From the time I started blogging, I've been able to focus on my personal growth and develop my personal life, relationship, and financial life. At first scrutiny, it may seem like I'm still in diapers, and it's true. However, as I continue to blog, gain more experience, continue my relationship with fellow bloggers, and gain confidence in the ways I expand my potentials, then slowly but surely I have gained maturity in the way I now work.\\n\\nMy personal life and relationship have much been impacted since I started blogging. This is because I do not only write, I read more than I write, interesting articles about life, relationship, and finance are all over the places for all to read. I now live a peaceful and relaxing life away from the usual bubble and bustle life. My love life has improved much tremendously because the more I write the more I want to be more of what I wrote.\\n\\nI couldn't be more satisfied in any area of my life with blogging than my financial life. The impact of cryptocurrency and BCH, in particular, is so huge for me, enabling me to plant seeds that would grow up to become financial trees for me and my family to safely rest under its fruitful shield.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nI've learned a lot about myself through blogging and as a result, feel more confident about my future and career, especially if I can continue with this growth. As you grow, you also become more independent and can now do things on your own, instead of relying on a man to provide you with financial advice. And because of the many things that I learn and the different areas that you can too, this allows me the ability to get the most out for myself and my family.\\n\\nThrough blogging, I am able and willing to do more, not just write but share, grow and learn in a way that is far more beneficial for my health, happiness, and relationships with others. From my experience, blogging has been scrutiny, as well as criticism, in regards to my behavior, relationships, actions, thoughts, and emotions. In turn, it has taught me a lot of things about myself, about relationships, and about life itself. Blogging has allowed me more freedom in relationships as a man, being able more fully to express myself. It has also given me the freedom to be able to fully express emotions and feelings that in turn allowed my relationships to grow in strength and peace.\\n\\nFinancial freedom is something I have always wanted to have as I continue to work on building my finances and learning to manage them better. These financial aspects have allowed for me to not have to worry about money as much as before and this has allowed things to happen in life that I have also learned about a whole new world through blogging.\",\"timestamp\":1635167190,\"title\":\"My life as a blogger\"},\"digest\":\"54EtCIPwzPU2Jq_xp0AaEEWUBdi0wJJjTwMGXRNp_0s\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xc0Adae24dF3De996E2EABB775A965e145D57D77B\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qfBQiGcrKiHH90tMO2G6uVwsF_KIJcQVaI508JNp0s8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FCwniM5kDCUpc2xNmQzSHVLgBUsUAFeEkv8F1harnvs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"qo7Q_vbBFsFG566LTI9N-c8n1mrfnBoo2sizUlYx6Ssa7jKsiSvAU5NbN2FSpm8IWDBdruZSntq3fHJ-6wDeXQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x3ab0878481974b96443cc3dc2c1602f74991f8aae423f7e27ff63d6ad6b488916d756b22daf5620db792f1c2a5e855d58bdaf15afdcc22e7351e678ab70d08f51b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qfBQiGcrKiHH90tMO2G6uVwsF_KIJcQVaI508JNp0s8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FCwniM5kDCUpc2xNmQzSHVLgBUsUAFeEkv8F1harnvs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"54EtCIPwzPU2Jq_xp0AaEEWUBdi0wJJjTwMGXRNp_0s\"}"
