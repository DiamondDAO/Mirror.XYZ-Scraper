It works because it mirrors the way I think, allows me to make connections, both random and specific, and doesn’t require me to have all my ideas complete.\\n\\nBefore Obsidian, my writing was hit and miss due to:\\n\\n• the blank page\\n\\n• lack of inspiration\\n\\n• the need to finish\\n\\n## Obsidian gave me the tools to create a workflow\\n\\nWriting from scratch is hard. But that’s how I had always done it. Obsidian is also my repository for ideas and inspiration. Writing with abundance (David Perell) showed me how to use my reading to develop my own ideas. That changed everything. And with Obsidian Publish I can share my notes!\\n\\n## It’s like your own personal Wiki\\n\\nYears ago when I first started writing I needed Obsidian, or, at least, Zettelkasten.\\n\\nI wish I’d cultivated my journaling habit at an earlier age. All those missing years! I’m in awe of anyone who has documented their life in notebooks. Obsidian’s Daily Notes let you do just that.\\n\\nMy favourite element though — links, backlinks and the graph. I don’t have to think logically, just throw everything in, add links or tags and Obsidian does the rest.\\n\\nSince Obsidian:\\n\\n• Book outlining is easy\\n\\n• Finding references is a cinch\\n\\n• Nothing is forgotten\\n\\n• I’m writing in public\\n\\nObsidian lit a fire beneath me from day one. It’s not gone out. It’s made writing easier but, best of all, I’m publishing more. And that’s the goal.\",\"timestamp\":1635959426,\"title\":\"why Obsidian is so great for writing - Nicola Fisher - Medium\"},\"digest\":\"AFsXWWiVltU2wAhxQ5Sv08eey8OJ15DZBNGaxhbu3pM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5AEa3458326d5B7ea7B07cC679935d430398C209\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Vc_D0bAVf1-_b6FQFY0b3qUr2lf-FwvfdRHXMmEPJrM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qBBHbyBkZNJJYOdAfGihxAa3dcGUsIaTSgvYcYaMTS8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"AokjOitWEjWWnXmRTuGWCAG8HiXapKSQknkVAWT1g2nWqSjgjOuhngIrHKfhIYtwfARHynhvO2p1rZW86kNqCw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb193e10f6fc9346a41003f7ab529f596300043fcafaabfccf170a2cf56dcab813d12eda7413a3c08038a42be4fd2f8000bfb61648ec841c6903ac3390b55d4121c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Vc_D0bAVf1-_b6FQFY0b3qUr2lf-FwvfdRHXMmEPJrM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qBBHbyBkZNJJYOdAfGihxAa3dcGUsIaTSgvYcYaMTS8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"AFsXWWiVltU2wAhxQ5Sv08eey8OJ15DZBNGaxhbu3pM\"}"
