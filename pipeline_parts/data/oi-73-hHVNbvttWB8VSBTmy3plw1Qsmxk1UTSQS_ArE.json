Before deciding to take  filmmaking serious, I had a pile of songs I’d been debating on releasing but the time never felt right. With the rise of web3 and NFTs I’ve seen just how impactful these tools and technology can be for the artists, designers & thinkers of our time.\\n\\n![](https://worlds-friend.ghost.io/content/images/2021/10/IMG_6251.JPG)\\n\\nA quote from [Dom Kennedy](https://twitter.com/DOPEITSDOM) always stuck with me, he said\\n\\n> “my plan wasn’t to become a rapper but a businessman- I wanted my own label but how could I convince a rapper to sign to me if I hadn’t even proved myself capable of taking care of talent and executing on a vision”\\n\\nI recently tweeted about a web3 protocol that I want to introduce for IRL P2P sharing of intellectual property in physical form. I know that may sound like a lot but simply put, *I want to create the CD/DVD/CASSETTE TAPE/ETC. of NFTS, Digital Collectibles and Media.*\\n\\n![](https://worlds-friend.ghost.io/content/images/2021/10/IMG_6457.jpg)\\n\\nJust a small list of use cases foreseeable\\n\\nAt first I thought I needed to find the perfect artist to roll this protocol out with, but that would be moving too fast. First things first, I have to put some [skin in the game](https://g.co/kgs/WVFYAR). Sure, I will make some money but not without a couple of hiccups due to the learning curve. Which is even more reason why I believe I should be the guinea pig. What’s most important is curating this space where early adopters and fans can onboard onto web3 and get familiar with the space while also earning royalties on secondhand sales.\\n\\n![](https://worlds-friend.ghost.io/content/images/2021/10/IMG_6398.JPG)\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\nIf this inspired you in anyway all I ask is that you join my email list ***(just press subscribe at bottom of screen!)*** or discord server to stay connected.\\n\\nIn the discord, I plan to host regularly scheduled discussions around the “Public Goods Protocol” in order to improve its processes, packaging/design, UI/UX, different use cases, while also strategizing on ways to put our ownership to use, and finally I want to give all artists a platform for distributing physical (digital) goods.\\n\\nIf you want to learn more about Web3 and the blockchain I will leave some helpful links below for you to do your own research.\\n\\n[DAO Landscapes](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw)\\n\\n[DAO Creator Resources](https://kinjal.mirror.xyz/eD3-Sgv2h50j-kwjHQCOnwqMKqSLTfnrqrtNypU-P5k)\\n\\n[The Cooperation Economy](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-cooperation-economy-)\\n\\n![](https://worlds-friend.ghost.io/content/images/2021/10/worlds-friend-twitter--2.gif)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1635357642,\"title\":\"Public Goods Protocol by world’s friend\"},\"digest\":\"gOJgnc4W2uEbtb-OFxTcI-cgMlpIgLTpysTlkc4C97Y\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xF491eDDB9BC1b240bf3503C09e8eEA1F5bCeDd2e\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"lEd697dKOvimAvjROBuAOysJ_7lj_rARmgN0yLYxciQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZiHHjQSt5MXFAATuCydsPhs2kgDTFLtevaDjzG7vBEE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"GTwHtSvsVL6q-DjAmGx8S5U1m3Utibk4M5QXS6kcazLNM31-TGs84d7fWbOYdnX6kp7VOduH768uj3eiY10C1g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb0d12831a48e5448b871e90d19f362f181534812ee7102f6a34e9e7a8e31bb7e417759a5c5e019e857647eefccc5efddc7495655612dbf219dbfe67ca12fd0b81b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"lEd697dKOvimAvjROBuAOysJ_7lj_rARmgN0yLYxciQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZiHHjQSt5MXFAATuCydsPhs2kgDTFLtevaDjzG7vBEE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"gOJgnc4W2uEbtb-OFxTcI-cgMlpIgLTpysTlkc4C97Y\"}"
