Check it out at [http://partybid.app](http://partybid.app) and see our [Github](https://github.com/PartyDAO/partybid) for the contracts deployed to Ethereum mainnet. Start a party on any [Foundation](https://foundation.app/) or [Zora](https://zora.co/) auction or join one of the launch parties:\\n- [Party of the Living Dead](https://www.partybid.app/party/0x2912F57F93dD69FBbF477B616D6f8C34C49bb282) Party by [Andy Chorlian](https://twitter.com/andy8052) bidding for a [zombie punk](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/2066).\\n- [BlitSquad](https://www.partybid.app/party/0x3b2185065f8e8db96F1294B2EF43F2D485E684E4) Party by [Variant](https://twitter.com/variantfund) targeting a [Blitmap](https://twitter.com/blitmap) collection.\\n- [VV-Multiplayer](https://www.partybid.app/party/0xf64863E64e0364A6eeF4F224551A5F949db41e2c) by [Visualize Value](https://twitter.com/visualizevalue) going for [Renaissance](https://foundation.app/0xc8f8e2f59dd95ff67c3d39109eca2e2a017d4c8a/fnd-68518).\\n\\nPartyBid is a product that lets groups of people combine their capital and bid on NFT auctions together. Anyone can create or join a PartyBid, contribute ETH, and place bids as part of a collective. DAOâ€™s are an emerging model for combining capital and coordinating action. The goal of PartyBid is to lower the barrier for this kind of coordination. For a fuller description of the productâ€™s features and mechanics, please see our [about page](https://www.partybid.app/about).  We would like to note that V1 is a new protocol and product, we cannot guarantee all bugs have been found and resolved.\\n\\nThe journey to V1 was born and evolved online. NFT auctions have found traction as a new way for creators to monetize their work, bringing a wave of creative talent into crypto. But the traditional auction model rewards only one winner, favoring whales over the community of supporters that contribute and add value to an NFT project. PartyBid is a response to this. It began with [a single tweet](https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1383238473767813125?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1383238473767813125%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd.mirror.xyz%2FFLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) from Denis Nazarov. As the idea spread online, Anish Agnihotri [created an MVP](https://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri/status/1384372491053846531?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1384372491053846531%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd.mirror.xyz%2FFLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4), deployed it and won an auction. True to the internet-native roots of the project, [a DAO was formed](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) with the mission to get PartyBid production-ready and into the world.\\n\\nPartyDAO is a fully decentralized organization whose goal is to build and ship multiplayer software in crypto. We hope it offers a new standard for bootstrapping crypto products in addition to the progressive decentralization model. To ship this V1, PartyDAO assembled a squad of talented contributors across engineering, product, design, smart contract development, security and go-to-market. Weâ€™re excited to have PartyBid in the wild and to see people win with their friends.\\n\\nA special shout out to the people who contributed their hard work and unique skills to PartyDAO to make V1 come to life:\\n- [John Palmer](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer) as project lead.\\n- [Anna Carroll](https://twitter.com/annascarroll) as smart contract lead.\\n- [Callil Capuozzo](https://twitter.com/_callil) as design lead.\\n- [Anish Agnihotri](https://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri) as front end lead.\\n- [Danny Aranda](https://twitter.com/daranda) as go-to-market lead.\\n- [Steve Klebanoff](https://twitter.com/steveklbnf), [Graeme Boy](https://twitter.com/strangechances), [Arpit Agarwal](https://twitter.com/atvanguard) as smart contract advisors.\\n- [Alex Towle](https://twitter.com/jalex_towle) and [Bug0tree](https://twitter.com/bug0tree) as security advisors.\\n- [Kiran](https://twitter.com/neuroswish) as testing lead and design contributor\\n- [Lily Nguyen](https://twitter.com/lily___digital), [Breck](https://twitter.com/brxckinridge), [Ethan Daya](https://twitter.com/ethandaya) and the whole [p0pb0ttl3z](https://twitter.com/p0pb0ttl3z) crew for testing PartyBid in prod to win [FWBâ€™s first NFT](https://gallery.fwb.help/fwb-paris). \\n- [Andy Chorlian](https://twitter.com/andy8052) and the [Fractional](https://fractional.art/) team for collaboration on the fractionalization contracts.\\n- â€‹â€‹[Elpizo Choi](https://twitter.com/elpizoch), [Kyt Janae](https://twitter.com/kyttenjanae) and the rest of the team at Foundation.\\n- [Jacob Horne](https://twitter.com/js_horne), [Tyson Battistella](https://twitter.com/tbtstl?lang=en), [Iain Nash](https://twitter.com/isiain), [Dain Kim](https://twitter.com/Dblodorn), [Yana Sosnovskaya](https://twitter.com/YanaSosna), [LatashÃ¡ Alcindor](https://twitter.com/CallMeLatasha) and the rest of the team at Zora.\\n\\nAnd a big thank you to all members of PartyDAO and its extended community that made this possible, including but not limited to [Denis Nazarov](https://twitter.com/Iiterature), [Jack Butcher](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher), [Jon Itzler](https://twitter.com/jonitzler), [Julia Lipton](https://twitter.com/JuliaLipton), [Li Jin](https://twitter.com/ljin18), [Michael Galpert](https://twitter.com/msg), [Graphix Slayer](https://twitter.com/GraphixSlayer), and [Will Papper](https://twitter.com/WillPapper).\\n\\nTo get involved and stay up to date:\\n- Join the PartyDAO [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/GpYuTsr2dA)\\n- Follow PartyDAO on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/prtyDAO)\\n- Check out the contracts on [Github](https://github.com/PartyDAO/partybid)\\n\\nTeam PartyDAO ðŸ¥³\",\"timestamp\":1628102964,\"title\":\"PartyBid is Live!\",\"publication\":\"party\"},\"digest\":\"saJSzUTi-pkC_Soxxo5SuIVyAm05orTrgZhE0aHa2fc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xAed58605cF7d6A9396f7c0539D51df6763808208\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"aqC9OO7Dn4ikATtaLssR-w8GECCQ5LuppS68qk2qGQ4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"XzbQlTnCkFDegsLjk8ygXd5wGUolKemH-6EmWsZKTD8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"hYvT3lDEYoM0cAwGA54N9EJBA6XhsFXrzg4SNtuj7APVX2he0Trmg7-_Z_l1XV6P8BnXjRZYXqlFbSKdX_cQSQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd278b13b32c1e9690f77a9a1016a69606c1e5322e725797249ce42b26e1028654f2467a8f7161ba5ae4e9ab5314b01add99a51c22cbb4ecf001e34d21fd670671c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on party.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"aqC9OO7Dn4ikATtaLssR-w8GECCQ5LuppS68qk2qGQ4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"XzbQlTnCkFDegsLjk8ygXd5wGUolKemH-6EmWsZKTD8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"saJSzUTi-pkC_Soxxo5SuIVyAm05orTrgZhE0aHa2fc\"}"
