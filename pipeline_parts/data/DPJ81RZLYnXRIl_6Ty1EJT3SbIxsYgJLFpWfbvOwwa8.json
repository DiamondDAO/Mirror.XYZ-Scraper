"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Chile may be the next Latin American country to embrace [Bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/?post_type=post&p=5736) and other cryptocurrencies in one form or another.\\n\\nLawmakers in the country are currently working towards legislation that would legalize the use of [Bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-four-minute-instant-guide-explainer) as a means of payment, and the Chilean government is already warming up to the idea of developing its own central bank digital currency. Will it be enough to change the country's financial landscape? In early November, Congressman Karim Bianchi [introduced a proposal](http://www.senado.cl/appsenado/templates/tramitacion/index.php?boletin_ini=14708-03) that seeks to recognize and regulate the use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as legal means of payment in the country. If passed, the law could provide the legal basis for further regulatory developments, such as banks offering crypto custody services.\\n\\nLast week, the Congress passed Bianchi's initiative for discussion under the Commission of Economy and Development. The legislation is quite concise. With just four articles, it is essentially aimed at regulating Bitcoin as a means of payment that is \\\"valid in any transaction and in any capacity that private natural or legal persons require to carry out.\\\"\\n\\nIn addition to recognizing Bitcoin as a valid means of payment, the proposed law states that the exchange rate for a Bitcoin will be determined by free-market mechanisms and that prices may be expressed in Bitcoin in the country, though it will be mandatory to represent them in Chilean pesos as well. \",\"timestamp\":1638510785,\"title\":\"'Digital Peso': What You Need to Know\"},\"digest\":\"VvJXLDqt7x45qYy4WYCmS16zI8eznP5WkUliF0IMYjA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xB52bA587b8B27AC3F9b842dd2075aec1A150e1A7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"znIDozOiUMjwvgvJDdJpDec9EN2eFwsuzSXzZxCbddg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4zYsSNKhScLqO9hkbk2IlmNOYqZhgZqr0cCy-zlFhOc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"sVrgrIrkbJV0MYBAeOTlOcDFVty65hQMeKCnrLir3Rzqiv1BtO_lVjcwhVlKB7T-ZsQCXnLxS7GdH_w1nYeC8w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0d2bb97fec6baa9786eb7ff2bc530430c68a19b997a9a16f9c95d247c17951c154d312d633126fcc91df7753bd03941081c817495bd624b86fa1fcfc49c9aae31c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"znIDozOiUMjwvgvJDdJpDec9EN2eFwsuzSXzZxCbddg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4zYsSNKhScLqO9hkbk2IlmNOYqZhgZqr0cCy-zlFhOc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"VvJXLDqt7x45qYy4WYCmS16zI8eznP5WkUliF0IMYjA\"}"
