"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"These I cast and bored, and mounted on their appropriate gun-carriages.  They proved very effective, especially in the loudness of the report when fired.  I also converted large cellar-keys into a sort of hand-cannon.  A touch-hole was bored into the barrel of the key, with a sliding brass collar that allowed the key-guns to be loaded and primed and ready for firing.  The principal occasion on which the brass cannon and hand-guns were used was on the 4th of June--King George the Thirds birthday.  This was always celebrated with exuberant and noisy loyalty.  The guns of the Castle were fired at noon, and the number of shots corresponded with the number of years that the king had reigned.  The grand old Castle was enveloped in smoke, and the discharges reverberated along the streets and among the surrounding hills.  Everything was in holiday order. The coaches were hung with garlands, the shops were ornamented, the troops were reviewed on Bruntsfield Links, and the citizens drank the king's health at the Gross, throwing the glasses over their shoulders.  The boys fired off gunpowder, or threw squibs or crackers from morning till night.  It was one of the greatest schoolboy events of the year.  My little brass cannon and hand-guns were very busy during that day.  They were fired until they became quite hot. These were the pre-lucifer days.  The fire to light the powder at the touch-hole was obtained by the use of a flint, a steel, and a tinder-box. The flint was struck sharply on the steel; a spark of fire fell into  the tinderbox, and the match of hemp string, soaked in saltpetre,  was readily lit, and fired off the little guns.\\n\\nI carried on quite a trade in forging beautiful little steels. I forged them out of old files, which proved excellent material for the purpose.  I filed them up into neat and correct forms, and then hardened and tempered them, secundum artem, at the little furnace stove in my father's workroom, where of course there were also a suitable anvil, hammer, and tongs.  I often made potent use of these steels in escaping from the ordeal of some severe task imposed upon me at school. The schoolmaster often deputed his authority to the monitors to hear us say our lessons.  But when I slyly exhibited a beautiful steel the monitor could not maintain his grim sense of duty, and he often let me escape the ordeal of repeating some passage from a Latin school-book by obtaining possession of the article.  I thus bought myself off. This system of bribery and corruption was no doubt shockingly improper, but as I was not naturally endowed with the taste for learning Latin and Greek, I continued my little diplomatic tricks until I left school.\\n\\nAs I have said, I did not learn much at the High School.  My mind was never opened up by what was taught me there.  It was a mere matter of rote and cram.  I learnt by heart a number of Latin rules and phrases, but what I learnt soon slipped from my memory.  My young mind was tormented by the tasks set before me.  At the same time my hungry mind thirsted for knowledge of another kind.\\n\\nThere was one thing, however, that I did learn at the High School. That was the blessings and advantages of friendship.  There were several of my schoolfellows of a like disposition with myself, with whom I formed attachments which ended only with life.  I may mention two of them in particular--Jemmy Patterson and Tom Smith.  The former was the son of one of the largest iron founders in Edinburgh. He was kind, good, and intelligent.  He and I were great cronies.  He took me to his father's workshops.  Nothing could have been more agreeable to my tastes. For there I saw how iron castings were made. Mill-work and steam-engines were repaired there, and I could see the way in which power was produced and communicated.  To me it was a most instructive school of practical mechanics.  Although I was only about thirteen at the time, I used to \\\"lend a hand,\\\" in which hearty zeal made up for want of strength.  I look back to these days, especially to the Saturday afternoons spent in the workshops of this admirably conducted iron foundry, as a most important part of my education as a mechanical engineer.  I did not read about such things; for words were of little use.  But I saw and handled, and thus all the ideas in connection with them became permanently rooted in my mind.\\n\\nEach department of the iron foundry was superintended by an able and intelligent man, who was distinguished not only by his ability but for his steadiness and sobriety.  The men were for the most part promoted to their fore-manship from the ranks, and had been brought up in the workshop from their boyhood.  They possessed a strong individuality of character, and served their employer faithfully and loyally.  One of these excellent men, with whom I was frequently brought into contact, was William Watson.  He took special charge of all that related to the construction and repairs of steam-engines, water-wheels, and mill-work generally.  He was a skilful designer and draughtsman, and an excellent pattern maker.  His designs were drawn in a bold and distinct style, on large deal boards, and were passed into the hands of the mechanics to be translated by them into actual work.  It was no small privilege to me to stand by, and now and then hold the end of the long straight edge, or by some humble but zealous genuine help of mine contribute to the progress of these substantial and most effective mechanical drawings.  Watson explained to me, in the most common-sense manner, his reasons for the various forms, arrangements, and proportions of the details of his designs.  He was an enthusiast on the subject of Euclid; and to see the beautiful problems applied by him in working out his excellent drawings was to me a lesson beyond all price.\\n\\nWatson was effectively assisted by his two sons, who carried out their father's designs in constructing the wood patterns after which the foundry-men or moulders reproduced their forms in cast iron, while the smiths by their craft realised the wrought-iron portions. Those sons of Mr. Watson were of that special class of workmen called millwrights-- a class now almost extinct, though many of the best known engineers originally belonged to them.  They could work with equal effectiveness in wood or iron.\\n\\nAnother foreman in Mr. Patterson's foundry was called Lewis.  He had special charge of the iron castings designed for architectural and ornamental purposes.  He was a man of great taste and artistic feeling, and I was able even at that time to appreciate the beauty of his designs.  One of the most original characters about the foundry, however, was Johnie Syme.  He took charge of the old Boulton and Watt steam-engine, which gave motion to the machinery of the works. It also produced the blast for the Cupolas, in which the pig and cast iron scrap was daily melted and cast into the various objects produced in the foundry.  Johnie was a complete incarnation of technical knowledge.  He was the Jack-of-all-trades of the establishment; and the standing counsel in every out-of-the-way case of managing and overcoming mechanical difficulties.  He was the superintendent of the boring machines.  In those days the boring of a steam-engine cylinder was considered high art in excelsis!  Patterson's firm was celebrated for the accuracy of its boring.\\n\\nI owe Johnie Syme a special debt of gratitude, as it was he who first initiated me into that most important of all technical processes in practical mechanism--the art of hardening and temperinq steel. It is, perhaps, not saying too much to assert that the successful practice of the mechanical arts, by means of which man rises from the savage to the civilised state, is due to that wonderful change. Man began with wood, and stone, and bone; he proceeded to bronze and iron; but it was only by means of hardened steel that he could accomplish anything in arms, in agriculture, or in architecture. The instant hardening which occurs on plunging a red-hot piece of steel into cold water may well be described as mysterious.  Even in these days, when science has defined the causes of so many phenomena, the reason of steel becoming hard on suddenly cooling it down from a red-heat, is a fact that no one has yet explained.  The steel may be tempered by modifying the degree of heat to which it is afterwards subjected.  It may thus be toughened by slightly reheating the hardened steel; the resoftening course is indicated by certain prismatic tints, which appear in a peculiar order of succession on its surface. The skilful artisan thus knows by experience the exact point at which it is necessary again to plunge it into cold water in order to secure the requisite combination of toughness and hardness to the steel required for his purposes.\\n\\nIn all these matters, my early instructor, Johnie Syme, gave me such information as proved of the greatest use to me in the after progress of my mechanical career.  Johnie Syme was also the very incarnation of quaint sly humour; and when communicating some of his most valued arcana of practical mechanical knowledge he always reminded me of some of Ostade's Dutchmen, by an almost indescribable sly humorous twinkle of the eye, which in that droll way stamped his information on my memory.\\n\\nTom Smith was another of my attached cronies.  Our friendship began at the High School in 1818.  Our similarity of disposition bound us together.  Smith was the son of an enterprising general merchant at Leith.  His father had a special genius for practical chemistry. He had established an extensive colour manufactory at Portobello, near Edinburgh, where he produced white lead, red lead, and a great variety of colours--in the preparation of which he required a thorough knowledge of chemistry.Tom Smith inherited his father's tastes, and admitted me to share in his experiments, which were carried on in a chemical laboratory situated behind his father's house at the bottom of Leith Walk.\\n\\nWe had a special means of communication.  When anything particular was going on at the laboratory, Tom hoisted a white flag on the top of a high pole in his father's garden.  Though I was more than a mile apart, I kept a look-out in the direction of the laboratory with a spy-glass. My father's house was at the top of Leith Walk, and Smith's house was at the bottom of it.  When the flag was hoisted I could clearly see the invitation to me to \\\"come down.\\\"  I was only too glad to run down the Walk and join my chum, and take part with him in some interesting chemical process.  Mr. Smith, the father, made me heartily welcome. He was pleased to see his son so much attached to me, and he perhaps believed that I was worthy of his friendship.  We took zealous part in all the chemical proceedings, and in that way Tom was fitting himself for the business of his life.\\n\\nMr. Smith was a most genial tempered man.  He was shrewd and quick-witted, like a native of York, as he was.  I received the greatest kindness from him as well as from his family.  His house was like a museum.  It was full of cabinets, in which were placed choice and interesting objects in natural history, geology, mineralogy, and metallurgy.  All were represented.  Many of these specimens had been brought to him from abroad by his ship captains who transported his colour manufactures and other commodities to foreign parts.\\n\\nMy friend Tom Smith and I made it a rule--and in this we were encouraged by his father--that, so far as was possible, we ourselves should actually make the acids and other substances used in our experiments.  We were not to buy them ready made, as this would have taken the zest out of our enjoyment.  We should have lost the pleasure and instruction of producing them by aid of our own wits and energies. To encounter and overcome a difficulty is the most interesting of all things.  Hence, though often baffled, we eventually produced perfect specimens of nitrous, nitric, and muriatic acids.  We distilled alcohol from duly fermented sugar and water, and rectified the resultant spirit from fusel oil by passing the alcoholic vapour through animal charcoal before it entered the worm of the still.  We converted part of the alcohol into sulphuric ether.  We produced phosphorus from bones, and elaborated many of the mysteries of chemistry.\\n\\nThe amount of practical information which we obtained by this system of making our own chemical agents was such as to reward us, in many respects, for the labour we underwent.  To outsiders it might appear a very troublesome and roundabout way of getting at the finally desired result.  But I feel certain that there is no better method of rooting chemical or any other instruction, deeply in our minds.  Indeed, I regret that the same system is not pursued by young men of the present day.  They are seldom, if ever, called upon to exert their own wits and industry to obtain the requisites for their instruction.  A great deal is now said about \\\"technical education\\\"; but how little there is of technical handiness or head work!  Everything is bought ready made to their hands; and hence there is no call for individual ingenuity.\\n\\nI often observe, in shop-windows, every detail of model ships and model steam-engines, supplied ready made for those who are \\\"said to be\\\" of an ingenious and mechanical turn.  Thus the vital uses of resourcefulness are done away with, and a sham exhibition of mechanical genius is paraded before you by the young impostors--the result, for the most part, of too free a supply of pocket money.  I have known too many instances of parents, led by such false evidence of constructive skill, apprenticing their sons to some engineering firm; and, after paying vast sums, finding out that the pretender comes out of the engineering shop with no other practical accomplishment than that of cigar-smoking!\\n\\nThe truth is that the eyes and the fingers--the bare fingers--are the two principal inlets to sound practical instruction.  They are the chief sources of trustworthy knowledge as to all the materials and operations which the engineer has to deal with, No book knowledge can avail for that purpose.  The nature and properties of the materials must come in through the finger ends.  Hence, I have no faith in young engineers who are addicted to wearing gloves.  Gloves, especially kid gloves, are perfect non-conductors of technical knowledge. This has really more to do with the efficiency of young aspirants for engineering success than most people are aware of!\\n\\nCHAPTER 6.   Mechanical Beginnings.\\n\\nI left the High School at the end of 1820.  I carried with me a small amount of Latin, and no Greek.  I do not think I was much the better for my small acquaintance with the dead languages.  I wanted something more living and quickening.  I continued my studies at private classes. Arithmetic and geometry were my favourite branches.The three first books of Euclid were to me a new intellectual life.  They brought out my power of reasoning.  They trained me mentally.  They enabled me to arrive at correct conclusions, and to acquire a knowledge of absolute truths.  It is because of this that I have ever since held the beautifully perfect method of reasoning, as exhibited in the exact method of arriving at Q.E.D., to be one of the most satisfactory efforts and exercises of the human intellect.\\n\\nBesides visiting and taking part in the works at Patterson's foundry, and joining in the chemical experiments at Smith's laboratory, my father gave me every opportunity for practising the art of drawing. He taught me to sketch with exactness every object, whether natural or artificial, so as to enable the hand to accurately reproduce what the eye had seen.  In order to acquire this almost invaluable art, which can serve so many valuable purposes in life, he was careful to educate my eye, so that I might perceive the relative proportions of the objects placed before me.  He would throw down at random a number of bricks, or pieces of wood representing them, and set me to copy their forms, their proportions, their lights and shadows respectively.\\n\\nI have often heard him say that any one who could make a correct drawing in regard to outline, and also indicate by a few effective touches the variation of lights and shadows of such a group of model object's, might not despair of making a good and correct sketch of the exterior of York Minster!\\n\\nMy father was an enthusiast in praise of this graphic language, and I have followed his example.  In fact, it formed a principal part of my own education.  It gave me the power of recording observations with a few graphic strokes of the pencil, which far surpassed in expression any number of mere words.  This graphic eloquence is one of the highest gifts in conveying clear and correct ideas as to the forms of objects--whether they be those of a simple and familiar kind, or of some form of mechanical construction, or of the details of fine building, or the characteristic features of a wide-stretching landscape.  This accomplishment of accurate drawing, which I achieved for the most part in my father's work-room, served me many a good turn in future years with reference to the engineering work which became the business of my life.\\n\\nI was constantly busy.  Mind, hands, and body were kept in a state of delightful and instructive activity.  When not drawing, I occupied myself in my father's workshop at the lathe, the furnace, or the bench. I gradually became initiated into every variety of mechanical and chemical manipulation.  I made my own tools and constructed my chemical apparatus, as far as lay in my power.  With respect to the latter, I constructed a very handy and effective blowpipe apparatus, consisting of a small air force-pump, connected with a cylindrical vessel of tin plate.  By means of an occasional use of the handy pump, it yielded such a fine steady blowpipe blast, as enabled me to bend glass tubes and blow bulbs for thermometers, to analyse metals or mineral substances, or to do any other work for which intense heat was necessary. My natural aptitude for manipulation, whether in mechanical or chemical operations, proved very serviceable to myself as well as to others; and (as will be shown hereafter) it gained for me the friendship of many distinguished scientific men.\\n\\nBut I did not devote myself altogether to experiments.  Exercise is as necessary for the body as the mind.  Without full health a man cannot enjoy comfort, nor can he possess endurance.  I therefore took plenty of exercise out of doors.  I accompanied my father in his walks round Edinburgh.  My intellect was kept alive during these delightful excursions.  For sometimes my father was accompanied by brother-artists, whose conversation is always so attractive; and sometimes by scientific men, such as Sir James Hall, Professor Leslie, Dr. Brewster, and others. Whatever may have been my opportunities for education so-called, nothing could have better served the purpose of real education (the evolution of the mental faculties) than the opportunities I enjoyed while accompanying and listening to the conversation of men distinguished for their originality of thought and their high intellectual capacity.  This was a mental culture of the best kind.\\n\\nThe volcanic origin of the beautiful scenery round Edinburgh was often the subject of their conversation.  Probably few visitors are aware that all those remarkable eminences, which give to the city and its surroundings so peculiar and romantic an aspect, are the results of the operation, during inconceivably remote ages, of volcanic force penetrating the earth's crust by disruptive power, and pouring forth streams of molten lava, now shrunk and cooled into volcanic rock. The observant eye, opened by the light of Science, can see unmistakable evidences of a condition of things which were in action at periods so remote as, in comparison, to shrink up the oldest of human records into events of yesterday.\",\"timestamp\":1639288648,\"title\":\"\\nAnother article for which I became equally famous was the manufacture of small brass cannon.\"},\"digest\":\"I1NohS4Cit3t8AZcdX-4cCznX3eElfksWoimMcRj6As\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x667E6054E728f4dC76df3f0F3c9c6bf23c751e8a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RBAvhhVteWjtlh_DeHY1st9dEW73VrUARSqQvFvRZAw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"nUTpM5wdzQYeCJIM1k8L6VfJ5q0FXyHHmXPkumYteBI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Ko4yQK1egPYshtow6Jxp7GXrTNHXAy88SrS9yj1cx8kPyW5SXrYVDAXJWe7sZAVoD3BY4oPGwwT144ohMCgVTg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xee639ee169bb017135bced43f62c772735fbc8582cd1496631a0061bf99d614a029f7c229113b1e05f264c81e0c27bf74a528d9e930897259129ac137930d0541c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RBAvhhVteWjtlh_DeHY1st9dEW73VrUARSqQvFvRZAw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"nUTpM5wdzQYeCJIM1k8L6VfJ5q0FXyHHmXPkumYteBI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"I1NohS4Cit3t8AZcdX-4cCznX3eElfksWoimMcRj6As\"}"
