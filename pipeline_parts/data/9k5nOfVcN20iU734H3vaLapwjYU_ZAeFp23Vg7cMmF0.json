"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1995 Japan\\n\\nWhen a story’s simulation of the future is better than reality, it lives rent-free in our imaginations - right into the future.  \\n  \\n  In 1995, an animated film was released that is cult classic.  \\n  \\n \\\"Ghost In The Shell\\\", an adaptation of a 1989 “manga” hit, has been hailed by film fans and historians. It was a box office failure.\\n\\nThe title, refers to \\\"Ghosts\\\", consciousness stored in computer minds with cyborg bodies, \\\"Shells\\\".  \\n  \\n On one level, it's a police story.\\n\\nIn 2029 Japan, “Major Motoko Kusanagi” is a government agent is chasing a hacker, 'The Pupper Master'. \\n\\nThe Major is also a cyborg, a human with a machine body. The \\\"Puppet Master\\\" is an A.I. made by another agency. After journeying through different networks, the A.I. became self-aware, and a threat to its creators.  \\n  \\n On a deeper layer, the film was an exploration by a director who believed a film \\\"about the influence and power of computers... was more effectively conveyed through animation\\\".\\n\\nThe film was made with both traditional 'cel' film animation and CGI. The movie's futuristic city was based on 20th century Hong Kong - a city that is a hybrid between the past and the future.\\n\\nA sound studio used various sources, including spatializers to evoke the feel of electronic brain conversations, Japanese pop, Bulgarian harmonies with folk singers, and a theme from U2 and Brian Eno.\\n\\nSome of the story was borrowed in \\\"The Matrix\\\" trilogy, and James Cameron credited the film as one of his inspirations for \\\"Avatar\\\".\\n\\nDespite the bad box office, there was a sequel in 2004, soundtracks, books and an animated series. The director released a second version in 2008.  \\n  \\n Followups made more money than the original film.\\n\\nThere was a 2021 IMAX restoration, 26 years after the debut.  \\n  \\n When the film came out, the Internet was still new, robots couldn't walk upright yet, and 'A.I.' was in its infancy. \\n \\n\\n**2877 EARTH, THE NECKLACE, MARS CONSULATE**\\n\\nI got out of the floater, and walked into the consulate. \\n\\nI went back to the secure room, and opened the vault, and put the package on the table. The table lit up.\\n\\n**\\\"ROOM, connect to device.\\\"**\\n\\\"Accessing. Prompt. Negotiation. Connected.\\\" said the ROOM.\\nThe room was bathed in the data from the device.\\n\\n**\\\"ROOM, I want to clip a portion of the data. Some of it can be redacted to look like it was official. The recipient will be users for local grey market co-operatives or collectives. I want them to have something not available in local 'chains. Since these are grey market, it has be something they would want but it can't be of strategic value to us.\\\"**\\n\\n\\\"Reviewing files. It will take some time, Commander, to create simulated files.\\\"\\n**\\\"ROOM, begin creating simulations.\\\"**\\n\\nI went to another table in the room and made a late meal. A few hours passed.\\n\\\"Commander, there is someone here for you.\\\"\\n\\n**\\\"If it's the Inspector who dropped me off earlier, then tell security to let him in.\\\"**\\n\\n\\\"Commander, it's not the Inspector.\\\"\\n\\nI put down my tea, and waved on a view at the security desk.  \\n  \\n It was the leader of that crew I fought with at \\\"the Depot\\\" restaurant. She had an arm in a sling but she standing. The rest of her crew might be at the hospital or worse but there she was, waiting for me at the ground floor, right by security.\\n\\n**\\\"ROOM, continue running simulations. Seal this room after I leave, no comes in.\\\"**\\n\\nA meeting with someone from this \\\"crew\\\" was happening earlier than expected.\\n\\n[https://audius.co/bluescreen/01-ghost-in-the-shell-radio-edit-241230](https://audius.co/bluescreen/01-ghost-in-the-shell-radio-edit-241230)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EIJQK1liZC4G1YC9FXNFo.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9H5KLSdTXcMcG07CvZ4PN.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1635906337,\"title\":\"1999 7.25 When a Simulation Is Better Than Reality\"},\"digest\":\"OmjzZ6Zfn2PE1Ed6cKuGynaoQ6gZAnVNjq4ZBTO6g0k\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cp69EkVmGPN56udTPoj_01QpW6eGaXZ1zbeS531jad8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zYwhIf2jaKC_Er3nNncHMRuE7eXBXlkdLz-3zM8ikGE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"77Jb_ednVbcVgo2PyA8iJn8H2N1FiCPGHuxuDlARFtmTj_qaqA38RpE3EcKteiEdGRPJWdexkI0e7j4icc8dRw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe4c1bcaa88b6fe2c67d195f4a76d1a91640647a2c63ec8f8083673f941e8ee412d804077222237104c51130677298bdcb163cbc3b2eb0bb6193f6b825a8e06141c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cp69EkVmGPN56udTPoj_01QpW6eGaXZ1zbeS531jad8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zYwhIf2jaKC_Er3nNncHMRuE7eXBXlkdLz-3zM8ikGE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"OmjzZ6Zfn2PE1Ed6cKuGynaoQ6gZAnVNjq4ZBTO6g0k\"}"
