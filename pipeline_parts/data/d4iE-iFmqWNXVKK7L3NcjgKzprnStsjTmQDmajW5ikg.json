"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Timing is everything. In web3, this is especially true. The space’s rapid innovation consistently unlocks new opportunities. In the case of [NFT DevCon](https://twitter.com/NFTDevCon), it’s all the new functionality of NFT’s, specifically NFT DAO’s used by projects like [Dope Wars](https://dopewars.gg).\\n\\nAs the name suggests, NFT Devcon is a developer conference. Nothing particularly innovative about that. What is new is that this event will be owned and organized by its attendees and sponsors together.\\n\\n### Event organizing carries a lot of risks\\n\\nThe timeline of event organization goes like this:\\n\\n* Pay deposits to reserve:\\n  * Space/AV/Food/Entertainment/Swag\\n* Recruit Speakers\\n* Attract Attendees/Sponsors\\n\\nAs an event organizer, you are on the hook for all the hard costs of the event from the beginning. Especially for new events, over 50% of sponsors and attendees tend to register at the last minute. There isn’t just financial risk, there is also content risk.\\n\\nBecause you need content to attract attendees, it’s on the organizers to determine who the speakers will be. This means that you don’t get any feedback on the event program until the day of the show. Not exactly the “talk to customers” ethos that is so often championed at tech events.\\n\\n### NFT DAO’s were built to organize events\\n\\nThe best developer conferences are for open source projects. Organizing teams who are part of the community and doing it to promote the health of the project. Where they fall down however is in the organizational structure.\\n\\nThis is where NFT DAO’s come in. Organizations that are purpose-built for group decision-making. Beyond decision making, things like treasury and proposals map very well to the needs of a conference organizer.\\n\\n### There’s a need for an NFT developer conference\\n\\nNFTs are big enough that many web3 developers have made it their niche. The current NFT conferences are more focused on the business and opportunity of the space, not the code.\\n\\nIn conversations I’ve had with friends in the space there is a real appetite for hands-on NFT developer events. With my experience organizing developer conferences and love of web3, I felt like this was my chance to add value in a big way. So here we are.\\n\\n### How’s it going to work?\\n\\nIn a future article, I’ll walk through how this is all going to work. For now, suffice it to say that all tickets are NFTs. The sooner you buy your ticket the more input you have. And if you have an NFT from the first year you’re whitelisted to buy tickets first for the next year. \\n\\nLuckily people like [Dennison Bertram](https://twitter.com/dennisonbertram) of [Tally](https://withtally.com/), [Alex Masmej](https://twitter.com/AlexMasmej) of [Showtime](https://showtime.io/), and [Eric Arsenault](https://twitter.com/eric_rsno) of [Rarible DAO](https://rarible.org/) have already signed on to help! We’re on the lookout for more early speakers, sponsors and organizers. \\n\\nIf you’re interested in being part of this event please reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NFTDevCon).\",\"timestamp\":1637891438,\"title\":\"NFT DevCon: The developer conference run by a DAO\"},\"digest\":\"6i2GOBo3l8S3iRPcu7gug2ZAzdo3LczL-9kGkVLEGgU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2271fe6D76ab94352eF826d97445048Bd8C4d45F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PMp8O2_akzmx_A4O7GNxYT_w0Rm9ggrsoFvxbiWOkDM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8zL8_Z-YBWKTmEMT7uLxFl_gegFwwVwJgZ5Wtb3Tlxs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"wnYkLscPKFm1hgCazS5e_IkLBWjG6tAfJBH5LB-q2t3wXAaijXqyaqe9DmnKf1FuRMHnC1sPuxT_0NvcWrVRVg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb49603e2865862d0e9b3876e4d199d81c9688062658fdaf11b8c8af03a3240de3bff1d26308591c937bb2efbb41e89ff58ac9ba15b2a88c2123e0ffdf8d487f61b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PMp8O2_akzmx_A4O7GNxYT_w0Rm9ggrsoFvxbiWOkDM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8zL8_Z-YBWKTmEMT7uLxFl_gegFwwVwJgZ5Wtb3Tlxs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"20fLLk-5yEzXrXQDkzyakzy6e2SGlhTV4vfNF86-xQA\"}"
