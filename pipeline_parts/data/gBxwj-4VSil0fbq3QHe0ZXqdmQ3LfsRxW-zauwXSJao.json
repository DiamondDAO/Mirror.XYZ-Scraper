"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I’ve been spending some time playing with [this dataset](https://blocks.flashbots.net/). I made [an initial tweet](https://twitter.com/totlsota/status/1477357014451986435) about it the other day. The dataset contains historical [Flashbots](https://docs.flashbots.net/) transactions which found their way into blocks.\\n\\n*If you don’t know what Flashbots is, or MEV is, you will already be confused. Other people have done a much better job than I will describing these things. Google now…*\\n\\n**A disclaimer**. I’m still very much exploring this dataset and may have made some wrong assumptions/ conclusions. Please [message me](https://twitter.com/totlsota) if you find something errant.\\n\\n### Aggregate Numbers and Assumptions:\\n\\n* The total dataset has 984,381 entries/blocks with individual 5,412,236 transactions.\\n* This exploration uses only recent blocks since block # = [13602434](https://etherscan.io/block/13602434) (Nov-12-2021 04:44:10 PM +UTC). There are 978,354 transactions in this subset.\\n* There are a few types of “bundles”. I’ve focussed on the “flashbots” bundles. Here are the counts in the whole dataset.\\n\\n```\\nbundle_type\\nflashbots       3834935\\nminer_payout     818034\\nrogue            759103\\nunknown             164\\n```\\n\\n* Addresses for routers like Uniswap, Sushiswap, etc are excluded.\\n* This analysis focusses in on what I’ve decided is the #1 Flashbots bot. What is this “#1” based on?\\n\\n### #1  Flashbots Contract\\n\\nAs % of total transactions in the analysis period, the #1 contract is \\\\~11% of the dataset (72,480 transactions for this one contract).\\n\\n![% of transactions by address](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1iH1MJq0oNj430VjSjUwt.png?height=746&width=1224)\\n\\n### How about the EOAs calling this contract?\\n\\nThere appear to be 210 EOAs that invoke this contract. Many of these EOAs generate a large number of transactions:\\n\\n![# of transactions by EOA for #1 contract](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0NpKVR1JzHlDSTq5OTnbW.png?height=1382&width=1186)\\n\\n### What else can we find that these EOAs touch?\\n\\nWe can see what else those EOAs are sending to. First we find that there is another top Flashbots contract in this EOA web. I had labelled this other contract “#25” by my ranking. Also note that **[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9799b475dec92bd99bbdd943013325c36157f383) has this contract tagged as \\\"Fund\\\" and labelled “Fund: 0x979...383”.**\\n\\n![Etherscan view of this contract (with my own label too).](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-WWv1qX3_IhdmroXeXVZL.png?height=628&width=2806)\\n\\nWhat if you search for transactions to accounts that are *not* between this web of affiliated EOAs, and not to the 2 bot contracts, what do you find? There are only 13 addresses that remain and a few are interesting.\\n\\n* [Another EOA](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72bb8C608c4ea4a887266985e680A04c056f5B2A) that triggers that bot #25 above. This EOA is also interesting because it has inbound transfers from another account I’ve tagged based on data in this dataset. I’d labelled [this other account](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9787ffbd8ac920317ba43333913419f14489aa5f) in the From column as “*fbots top 20 EOA feeder account*”.\\n\\n![Another EOA triggering another bot and inbound from a feeder account](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/w5DgmXt1YgnMWpqzIixG1.png?height=276&width=2726)\\n\\n* Squaring the circle, you can see this account transfer into [another account](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe03eebaf8f5b1a723cec689323c303ad9918061d), which feeds … our #1 MEV bot.\\n\\n![Feeder account, #1 MEV bot](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZJMOhTcpkGLOqAKrWTHA-.png?height=500&width=2722)\\n\\n* Another [EOA](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf06443E71c4778Fe8813a6bb9E036d8d10f4adeE) triggers a [top 50 MEV bot](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfa103c21ea2df71dfb92b0652f8b1d795e51cdef) (again, ranking based on this dataset). That makes 3 bots. This one ranks #15 in the recent period FWIW.\\n* [This related account](https://etherscan.io/address/0xae63A56FC374cF1eF8E32052804cDBf78E52D7F0) appears to be the transfer account to Avalanche Bridge (again my labels visible).\\n\\n![Transfers to Avalanche Bridge](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ig0ZsioDnrK5FwfJ9vBJf.png?height=792&width=2722)\\n\\n## Conclusions\\n\\n* *Maybe all this is nonsense and I’m finding noise.*\\n* We know it is likely “A fund” involved.\\n* This looks like a proper trading firm with requisite complexity and scale.\\n* I find the openness of the data fun and inspiring. Quite a contrast to tradfi!\\n* If I had to guess, I’d say this web was Alameda Research or Wintermute. It could be someone else of course.\",\"timestamp\":1641145321,\"title\":\"Flashbots #1 MEV bot breakdown\"},\"digest\":\"RxaPI3a7zlwC2Quuk0nmMOBvNHOPbHfcZ8Y12EWW64k\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x10D2e3d5D76154C985eD15241BC885E284c88829\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"u3ct1sfCw0e1cckK0QhpCZAlKXrVUiD9a83y4o4y_7M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KjnP_XOAwSKou9ygZf_XkM5eP0_BHriVd1fmSzqKnzY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"9zVMeCJ3ngRtxJoKLlCYFBpYWRIuSQ3zgOqWIjBMkxc1x1YF9tXkvROFwT-mtlD6WHEE3r064cZZXu5lYoC4UA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9a53260ca7d5c171516285c4f0eb605e7fa7d06ceb32e5b0d721fb365c0d02ae142dc3f71cb99df5d442141687640a3f9df4d14166c8b24abb6101eaa5efe4b71c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"u3ct1sfCw0e1cckK0QhpCZAlKXrVUiD9a83y4o4y_7M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KjnP_XOAwSKou9ygZf_XkM5eP0_BHriVd1fmSzqKnzY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"hyu-U2Q4qp0hTxnjYdW1sACynZRS1uHOBVQ4CY-uEoc\"}"
