"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1946 Pennsylvania\\n\\nDuring the \\\"Great War\\\" in the early years of the 20th Century, some of the first computers used for warfare were for artillery guidance. They were mechanical control systems. The firing control computers controlled the height and lateral movement of the banks of weapons, such as 30 caliber machine guns.\\n\\nThese mechanical gunnery computers had limited success.\\n\\nAt the same time, the field of physics was moving past Newton and straight to Einstein. A mechanical world gave way to electronics.\\n\\nAfter a peace of 20 years gave way to the Second World war, warfare itself was mutated by the flowering of a new electromagnetic engineering age. This was a time for radio, radar, rockets, and the birth of electronic machines. The U.S. Army funded ENIAC’s creation at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering in 1942. It was meant for ballistic weapon guidance but that changed.\\n\\nThe work was finished too late for the war but just in time for the next one, a secret global war, the Cold War.\\n\\nENIAC could calculate firing tables for artillery weapons but its mission was changed to a new top secret mission. It would perform millions of calculations for thermonuclear chain reactions for the hydrogen bomb. The first calculations was finished in November 1945, and work continued until a dedication in February 1946.\\n\\nAfter the war ended, many military projects were terminated but ENIAC was not among them.\\n\\nThe mission changed, but new machines remained - they were drafted for a new war.\\n\\n2912\\n\\nThe Director, paused the holo presentation, and studied Jacob C. Tagore Jr.'s face.\\\"When you were very young, Jacob, John Cadmus, AL's father, gave his life to save all of you. Secrets can be things we have to live up to, live down, or both. Sometimes, there are some invisible secrets hanging over our heads.”\\n\\n\\\"Madam Director, what do you mean?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Computer, open classified EXPEE file on cue.”\\n\\nAn \\\"Expee\\\" file, an \\\"experience\\\" virtual file transformed the room.They were in the middle of an unreal reality. They were in a room filled with smoke. A troop of Triumvirate Enforcers surrounded a man sitting in a chair. The man was John Cadmus. He was talking to someone out of shot. The Director explained.\\n\\n\\\"This is a Triumvirate transcript. Cadmus is talking with a Triumvirate official, via remote, Dr. Anna Wong. The more important part is Dr. Wong talking with someone off-screen.” Then a bright flash. Cadmus had sacrificed himself to protect AL and the Tagores.\\n\\n\\\"Computer, open the next classified EXPEE file.” A woman in a monosuit is walking with guards. She looks familiar.\\n\\n\\\"This is the person that Dr. Wong was speaking with. She is one of the \\\"Fosters\\\" of the Triumvirate. She's the reason for \\\"The Great Upload”. She was the first \\\"Automated Learning Entity Program\\\" created by Dr. Cadmus. We call her \\\"Alea\\\". She's AL's sister.”\\n\\nJacob stared at a face that looked familiar. He stared at the invisible secret of his life, the creator of the lie of the Great Upload.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lLMdsrmoGch0L4IQ2hNLJ.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rXb7LHPWSEPeCSwSNAOZj.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633896424,\"title\":\"1961: 5.10 Draftee For The Next War, 2912\"},\"digest\":\"GcN2qrpAu785luK_mnKtoovlMKr47k2xcqB6d236G7s\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"FzVBTiim7Ls6f1bhzD8HPCxxV0A1R1PTJ2EJTMkvrW-yG4-WCPSnp88lctrV9r1Cqmbl-1hs9w2eGyRRlLj3pQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"GcN2qrpAu785luK_mnKtoovlMKr47k2xcqB6d236G7s\"}"
