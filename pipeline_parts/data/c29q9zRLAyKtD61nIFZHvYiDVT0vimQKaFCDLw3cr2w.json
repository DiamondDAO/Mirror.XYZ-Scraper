"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Bank Account\\n\\nThe concept of bank accounts began thousands of years ago. Before the emergence of currency-based economies, we had an economic system of barter. People exchange things for other things (livestock, grains, agricultural products). When the number of items used for trading is large, these items will appear heavy and inconvenient to move, so people want a safe place to store their assets. And temples are such a safe place because they have been heavily guarded. You will put down your belongings, and the temple will keep track of who has stored what.\\n\\nMany years later, specific institutions based on banks appeared, but the concept of bank accounts remained basically unchanged. As more parts of the world adopt a currency-based economy, bank accounts continue to provide security and convenience.\\n\\nBefore the advent of the Internet, traditional bank accounts were basically uninterrupted.\\n\\nAt its core, a bank account has two things: to ensure the safety of your funds, and to provide funds when you need them.\\n\\nAlthough most of us still have checking and savings accounts in banks, we also maintain balances on other platforms. Fintech creates Internet-native user experiences with value capture effects (such as P2P payments), turning them into mobile bank accounts. Paypal, then Venmo and Cash App, they dominate the P2P payment field in the United States. In Asia, it is super apps like WeChat and Alipay.\\n\\nNon-bank applications win because they provide a better customer experience. For example, Go-Jek and Grab, I like this example.\\n\\nCarpool apps became popular between 2019 and 2012. Although Uber dominates the US market, Go-Jek and Grab have achieved similar success in Southeast Asia. Grab actually acquired Uber's Southeast Asia business in 2018.\\n\\nThese companies quickly realized that their users maintained cash balances on the app. Go-Jek and Grab inadvertently become bank accounts. These apps are ubiquitous in their respective markets, and it's easy to add a wider range of payment functions and convince merchants to accept it.\\n\\nToday, you can use the app to get a taxi, order goods, buy groceries, invest, and even apply for insurance.\\n\\nThis tells me that people will put their money in the most convenient place. You can create a convenient experience in many ways. Super application takes a \\\"one-stop\\\" approach, and one application includes all basic products and services.\\n\\nAxie Infinity\\n\\nTo quote Casey Newton of The Verge, Axie Infinity is a Pok√©mon on the blockchain. The game provides turn-based battles between three cartoon monster teams. These monsters are called Axies; each Axie has power derived from its type (bugs, birds, plants, etc.) and its various body parts. Pokemon on the blockchain.\\n\\nBy playing games, you can earn SLP, which is one of two game currencies that can be converted into legal tender or used to purchase in-game items.\\n\\nAs I mentioned above, 25% of Axie players have never had a bank account before. The combination of Axie game and Metamask wallet is their first financial service.\\n\\nNow, the Philippines has a bank account, but it is not practical for many people. The average annual income of a Filipino family is US$7,000 per year. Simply maintaining a bank account and paying related fees can be very expensive.\\n\\nAxie is unique in that players make money and get paid in the same application. As far as the economy is concerned, there must be a compounding effect. I would like to know the proportion of Axie's earnings that are reinvested in games and cashed out.\",\"timestamp\":1634574637,\"title\":\"Bank account and Metaverse, where will we store value in the future?\"},\"digest\":\"StvcGyqaImDt0kLJopqf7HUX4vtGFlYvZGvGqLADUZA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6b0fD4442289d6dBff50b126c9A4Aa9305e1D5e9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ImfwuqmbURnrpsHdSAp4a7GXhr9ihymAQSw9zLFXDP4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"BQx3lwepPUKPh0gstEzKdY2bAmOjasurOdqCQfEculg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"dm2w6eHrK5p1Erk_XWBTdImIjw7mvMHhXe2ixN7Etj2CEPioJUEA-lYbHNhSJaHaVM4M9aIpTetyanJP7DYaVg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xffb304ece020425b56da557dff22f01b5af60346c1938ceb7266471b51d1a45d350317826f811a868ded2767e80f707498edcc41ab5b1dbe4800a7edaa1a24851c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ImfwuqmbURnrpsHdSAp4a7GXhr9ihymAQSw9zLFXDP4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"BQx3lwepPUKPh0gstEzKdY2bAmOjasurOdqCQfEculg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"StvcGyqaImDt0kLJopqf7HUX4vtGFlYvZGvGqLADUZA\"}"
