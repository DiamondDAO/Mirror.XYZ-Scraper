"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**A 3 part Odyssey into the mind, heart and soul of California Singer / Rapper, Songwriter & Record Producer, James Kaye (me).** \\n\\nA follow up project to my breakthrough *Coconut EP,* the 28 song playlist will be released in 3 parts under Longhaul Music Group and in conjunction with new Music-Tech company *Signed 2 The Fans.* \\n\\nThrough the highs, lows and seemingly endless longhaul nights during the global pandemic, these songs tell a story of love, lust, heartbreak, some self-destruction, and much self reflection. \\n\\nThe theme of the drunken sailor is really the inner dialogue of a soul torn between settling down, or setting sail once again on a search for fame, fortune, and a deeper meaning of life no matter who’s heart I’m breaking in the process… Even if it’s my own. And for a rolling stone like me, sometimes a few cold drinks is the only way to smooth the ride. \\n\\nThe project roll-out is set to begin with the first 7 songs releasing on 2/22 as the *Low Tides EP,* with the remaining two installments of songs shortly there after. \\n\\n**The project will drop alongside unique collector’s items, merchandise, limited edition NFT’s, and options for discounts, special access to events, unreleased content, and a private chat server.** \\n\\nInstead of signing to a record label or distributor to raise money to support the campaign, I’m planning on signing a new kind of record deal with the people who matter most, my fans. \\n\\n*Signed 2 The Fans* is a new music tech company that will allow fans to donate money on the blockchain to projects, in exchange for a variety of perks including music royalties and more, through the use of smart contracts. \\n\\nI believes this project will be the one of the first of many “fan owned” albums for years to come, and all the exciting new possibilities of Web 3 and Music NFT’s make it that much more intriguing. \\n\\nMoving forward, every supporter of the project will be entered into a private discord chat, become part of the Signed 2 The Fans DAO, and receive a certain amount of $2THEFANS tokens. \\n\\nAs Signed 2 The Fans continues to grow and help more artists, the idea is that these tokens ultimately gain some type of liquidity and be worth money, and you’ll be able to use them to invest in other projects, hold and accrue value, or sell off as you wish. \\n\\nIf you aren’t interested in creating a digital wallet and using crypto to be a part of the raise, we’re going to be looking to partner with Cashapp where you can send capital directly using our special link, and then receive information on how to access your perks. \\n\\nWe know that a lot of people may not be fully aware of how Cryptocurrency, the Blockchain, and Creator DAOs work yet, and that’s ok, we are definitely still learning as we go. \\n\\nPart of this project is to convert more people from Web 2 (the internet as we know it) into the new and exciting world of Web 3 and where the internet is heading with blockchain.\\n\\nWe’re all in this together, and look forward to helping more independent artists, with an emphasis on rappers, singers and producers, starting with my own Low Tides, High Tides, and The Legend of a Drunken Sailor. \\n\\nFor more information on Signed 2 The Fans or to get on board with my campaign early, visit the discord here: <https://discord.gg/W3vCMEJy> , or follow me on Twitter / IG @mrjameskaye. \\n\\nLove, and thank you for reading my first ever Mirror article! \\n\\nSmooth Sailin’… \\n\\n\\\\-James\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1641688984,\"title\":\"Low Tides, High Tides and The Legend of a Drunken Sailor. \"},\"digest\":\"KA1f7Onfg8-t0n9kvkfCftFpL02cq_Ya-OeoIK4Ww2M\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8384Ddd39B89f2FB05B8cE8489339FCe6434E101\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JvF5UaS0sxwpvR1ZTMV9RMZCQvH3KA6OHDYwChQzpNA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"q4TL6a_JrUku-OrgC6OZ2ignqdhSYvHJQwWcgIL-MOs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"EDCUoRBUnM1Wta4yyQggc6G80jhzhNCYA5MkVoGx8Vv0_60Co-JK_gk17Bo-CBUdyzm1JHlrkRIlHvPjrVJTRg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0628e2928c216fc49438a7b04fb8e2dc31cdb2cf45a5f999075cc06d184176653899adfbf6b326d649cee5f05c9158f7affd9bfb5c29a6ad63438c303128b3cc1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JvF5UaS0sxwpvR1ZTMV9RMZCQvH3KA6OHDYwChQzpNA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"q4TL6a_JrUku-OrgC6OZ2ignqdhSYvHJQwWcgIL-MOs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"KA1f7Onfg8-t0n9kvkfCftFpL02cq_Ya-OeoIK4Ww2M\"}"
