"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\\--I mean, the town of Berlin itself,--only the finest streets, palaces, and squares of Copenhagen would bear a comparison with it.\\n\\nI spent but a few days here, and had therefore scarcely time to see the most remarkable and interesting sights.\\n\\nThe splendid royal palace, the extensive buildings for the picture- gallery and museums, the great dome--all these are situated very near each other.\\n\\nThe Dome church is large and regularly built; a chapel, surrounded by an iron enclosure, stands at each side of the entrance.  Several kings are buried here, and antiquated sarcophagi cover their remains, known as the kings' graves.  Near them stands a fine cast- iron monument, beneath which Count Brandenburg lies.\\n\\nThe Catholic church is built in the style of the Rotunda in Rome; but, unlike it, the light falls from windows made around the walls, and not from above.  Beautiful statues and a simple but tasteful altar are the only ornaments of this church.  The portico is ornamented by beautiful reliefs.\\n\\nThe Werder church is a modern erection, built in the Gothic style, and its turrets are ornamented by beautiful bronze reliefs.  The walls inside are inlaid with coloured wood up to the galleries, where they terminate in Gothic scroll-work.  The organ has a full, clear tone; in front of it stands a painting which, at first sight, resembles a scene from heathen mythology more than a sacred subject. A number of cupids soar among wreaths of flowers, and surround three beautiful female figures.\\n\\nThe mint and the architectural college stand near this church.  The former is covered with fine sculptures; the latter is square, of a brick-red colour, without any architectural embellishment, and perfectly resembling an unusually large private house.  The ground- floor is turned into fine shops.\\n\\nNear the palace lies the Opera Square, in which stand the celebrated opera-house, the arsenal, the university, the library, the academy, the guardhouse, and several royal palaces.  Three statues ornament the square:  those of General Count Bulov, General Count Scharnhorst, and General Prince Blucher.  They are all three beautifully sculptured, but the drapery did not please me; it consisted of the long military cloth cloak, which, opening in front, afforded a glimpse of the splendid uniforms.\\n\\nThe arsenal is one of the finest buildings in Berlin, and forms a square; at the time of my stay some repairs were being made, so that it was closed.  I had to be content with glimpses through the windows of the first floor, which showed me immense saloons filled by tremendous cannons, ranged in rows.\\n\\nThe guardhouse is contiguous, and resembles a pretty temple, with its portico of columns.\\n\\nThe opera-house forms a long detached square.  It would have a much better effect if the entrances were not so wretched.  The one at the grand portal looks like a narrow, miserable church-door, low and gloomy.  The other entrances are worse still, and one would not suppose that they could lead to such a splendid interior, whose appointments are indescribably luxurious and commodious.  The pit is filled by rows of comfortably-cushioned chairs with cushioned backs, numbered, but not barred.  The boxes are divided by very low partitions, so that the aristocratic world seems to sit on a tribune.  The seats in the pit and the first and second tiers are covered with dark-red silk damask; the royal box is a splendid saloon, the floor of which is covered with the finest carpets. Beautiful oil-paintings, in tasteful gold frames, ornament the plafond; but the magnificent chandelier is the greatest curiosity. It looks so massively worked in bronze, that it is painful to see the heavy mass hang so loosely over the heads of the spectators. But it is only a delusion; for it is made of paste-board, and bronzed over.  Innumerable lamps light the place; but one thing which I miss in such elegant modern theatres is a clock, which has a place in nearly every Italian theatre.\\n\\nThe other buildings on this square are also distinguished for their size and the beauty of their architecture.\\n\\nAn unusually broad stone bridge, with a finely-made iron balustrade, is built over a little arm of the Spree, and unites the square of the opera with that on which the palace stands.\\n\\nThe royal museum is one of the finest architectural piles, and its high portal is covered with beautiful frescoes.  The picture-gallery contains many chefs-d'oeuvre; and I regretted that I had not more time to examine it and the hall of antiquities, having only three hours for the two.\\n\\nFrom the academy runs a long street lined with lime-trees, and which is therefore called Under-the-limes (unter den Linden).  This alley forms a cheerful walk to the Brandenburg-gate, beyond which the pleasure-gardens are situated.  The longest and finest streets which run into the lime-alley are the Friedrichs Street and the Wilhelms Street.  The Leipziger Street also belongs to the finest, but does not run into this promenade.\\n\\nThe Gens-d'arme Square is distinguished by the French and German churches, at least by their exterior,--by their high domes, columns, and porticoes.  The interiors are small and insignificant.  On this square stands also the royal theatre, a tasteful pile of great beauty, with many pillars, and statues of muses and deities.\\n\\nI ascended the tower on which the telegraph works, on account of the view over the town and the flat neighbourhood.  A very civil official was polite enough to explain the signs of the telegraph to me, and to permit me to look at the other telegraphs through his telescope.\\n\\nThe Konigstadt, situated on the opposite shore of the Spree, not far from the royal palace, contains nothing remarkable.  Its chief street, the Konigsstrasse, is long, but narrow and dirty.  Indeed it forms a great contrast to the town of Berlin in every thing; the streets are narrow, short, and winding.  The post-office and the theatres are the most remarkable buildings.\\n\\nThe luxury displayed in the shop-windows is very great.  Many a mirror and many a plate-glass window reminded me of Hamburgh's splendour, which surpasses that of Berlin considerably.\\n\\nThere are not many excursions round Berlin, as the country is flat and sandy.  The most interesting are to the pleasure-gardens, Charlottenburg, and, since the opening of the railway, to Potsdam.\\n\\nThe park or pleasure-garden is outside the Brandenburg-gate; it is divided into several parts, one of which reminded me of our fine Prater in Vienna.  The beautiful alleys were filled with carriages, riders, and pedestrians; pretty coffee-houses enlivened the woody portions, and merry children gambolled on the green lawns.  I felt so much reminded of my beloved Prater, that I expected every moment to see a well-known face, or receive a friendly greeting.  Kroll's Casino, sometimes called the Winter-garden, is built on this side of the park.  I do not know how to describe this building; it is quite a fairy palace.  All the splendour which fancy can invent in furniture, gilding, painting, or tapestry, is here united in the splendid halls, saloons, temples, galleries, and boxes.  The dining- room, which will dine 1800 persons, is not lighted by windows, but by a glass roof vaulted over it.  Rows of pillars support the galleries, or separate the larger and smaller saloons.  In the niches, and in the corners, round the pillars, abound fragrant flowers, and plants in chaste vases or pots, which transform this place into a magical garden in winter.  Concerts and reunions take place here every Sunday, and the press of visitors is extraordinary, although smoking is prohibited.  This place will accommodate 5000 persons.\\n\\nThat side of the park which lies in the direction of the Potsdam- gate resembles an ornamental garden, with its well-kept alleys, flower-beds, terraces, islets, and gold-fish ponds.  A handsome monument to the memory of Queen Louise is erected on the Louise island here.\\n\\nOn this side, the coffee-house Odeon is the best, but cannot be compared to Kroll's casino.  Here also are rows of very elegant country-houses, most of which are built in the Italian style.\\n\\nCHARLOTTENBURG \\\\*\\\\*\\\\* DP PROOFED AND CORRECTED TO HERE \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nThis place is about half an hour's distance from the Brandenburg- gate, where the omnibuses that depart every minute are stationed. The road leads through the park, beyond which lies a pretty village, and adjoining it is the royal country-palace of Charlottenburg.  The palace is built in two stories, of which the upper one is very low, and is probably only used for the domestics.  The palace is more broad than deep; the roof is terrace-shaped, and in its centre rises a pretty dome.  The garden is simple, and not very large, but contains a considerable orangery.  In a dark grove stands a little building, the mausoleum in which the image of Queen Louise has been excellently executed by the famed artist Rauch.  Here also rest the ashes of the late king.  There is also an island with statues in the midst of a large pond, on which some swans float proudly.  It is a pity that dirt does not stick to these white-feathered animals, else they would soon be black swans; for the pond or river surrounding the island is one of the dirtiest ditches I have ever seen.\\n\\nFatigue would be very intolerable in this park, for there are very few benches, but an immense quantity of gnats.\\n\\nPOTSDAM.\\n\\nThe distance from Berlin to Potsdam is eighteen miles, which is passed by the railroad in three-quarters of an hour.  The railway is very conveniently arranged; the carriages are marked with the names of the station, and the traveller enters the carriage on which the place of his destination is marked.  Thus, the passengers are never annoyed by the entrance or exit of passengers, as all occupying the same carriage descend at the same time.\\n\\nThe road is very uninteresting; but this is compensated for by Potsdam itself, for which a day is scarcely sufficient.\\n\\nImmediately in front of the town flows the river Havel, crossed by a long, beautiful bridge, whose pillars are of stone, and the rest of the bridge of iron.  The large royal palace lies on the opposite shore, and is surrounded by a garden.  The garden is not very extensive, but large enough for the town, and is open to the public. The palace is built in a splendid style, but is unfortunately quite useless, as the court has beautiful summer-palaces in the neighbourhood of Potsdam, and spends the winter in Berlin.\\n\\nThe castle square is not very good; it is neither large nor regular, and not even level.  On it stands the large church, which is not yet completed, but promises to be a fine structure.  The town is tolerably large, and has many fine houses.  The streets, especially the Nauner Street, are wide and long, but badly paved; the stones are laid with the pointed side upwards, and for foot-passengers there is a stone pavement two feet broad on one side of the street only.  The promenade of the townspeople is called Am Kanal (beside the canal), and is a fine square, through which the canal flows, and is ornamented with trees.\\n\\nOf the royal pleasure-palaces I visited that of Sans Souci first. It is surrounded by a pretty park, and lies on a hill, which is divided into six terraces.  Large conservatories stand on each side of these; and in front of them are long alleys of orange and lemon- trees.\\n\\nThe palace has only a ground floor, and is surrounded by arbours, trees, and vines, so that it is almost concealed from view.  I could not inspect the interior, as the royal family was living there.\\n\\nA side-path leads from here to the Ruinenberg, on which the ruins of a larger and a smaller temple, raised by the hand of art, are tastefully disposed.  The top of the hill is taken up by a reservoir of water.  From this point one can see the back of the palace of Sans Souci, and the so-called new palace, separated from the former by a small park, and distant only about a quarter of an hour.\\n\\nThe new palace, built by Frederick the Great, is as splendid as one can imagine.  It forms a lengthened square, with arabesques and flat columns, and has a flat roof, which is surrounded by a stone balustrade, and ornamented by statues.\\n\\nThe apartments are high and large, and splendidly painted, tapestried, and furnished.  Oil-paintings, many of them very good, cover the walls.  One might fill a volume with the description of all the wonders of this place, which is, however, not inhabited.\\n\\nBehind the palace, and separated from it by a large court, are two beautiful little palaces, connected by a crescent-shaped hall of pillars; broad stone steps lead to the balconies surrounding the first story of the edifices.  They are used as barracks, and are, as such, the most beautiful I have ever seen.\\n\\nFrom here a pleasant walk leads to the lovely palace of Charlottenburg.  Coming from the large new palace it seemed too small for the dwelling even of the crown-prince.  I should have taken it for a splendid pavilion attached to the new palace, to which the royal family sometimes walked, and perhaps remained there to take refreshment.  But when I had inspected it more closely, and seen all the comfortable little rooms, furnished with such tasteful luxury, I felt that the crown-prince could not have made a better choice.\\n\\nBeautiful fountains play on the terraces; the walls of the corridors and anterooms are covered with splendid frescoes, in imitation of those found in Pompeii.  The rooms abound in excellent engravings, paintings, and other works of art; and the greatest taste and splendour is displayed even in the minor arrangements.\\n\\nA pretty Chinese chiosque, filled with good statues, which have been unfortunately much damaged and broken, stands near the palace.\\n\\nThese three beautiful royal residences are situated in parks, which are so united that they seem only as one.  The parks are filled with fine trees, and verdant fields crossed by well-kept paths and drives; but I saw very few flower-beds in them.\\n\\nWhen I had contemplated every thing at leisure, I returned to the palace of Sans Souci, to see the beautiful fountains, which play twice a week, on Tuesday and Friday, from noon till evening.  The columns projected from the basin in front of the castle are so voluminous, and rise with such force, that I gazed in amazement at the artifice.  It is real pleasure to be near the basin when the sun shines in its full splendour, forming the most beautiful rainbows in the falling shower of drops.  Equally beautiful is a fountain rising from a high vase, enwreathed by living flowers, and falling over it, so that it forms a quick, brisk fountain, transparent, and pure as the finest crystal.  The lid of the vase, also enwreathed with growing flowers, rises above the fountain.  The Neptune's grotto is of no great beauty; the water falls from an urn placed over it, and forms little waterfalls as it flows over nautilus-shells.\\n\\nThe marble palace lies on the other side of Potsdam, and is half an hour's distance from these palaces; but I had time enough to visit it.\\n\\nEntering the park belonging to this palace, a row of neat peasants' cottages is seen on the left; they are all alike, but separated by fruit, flower, or kitchen-gardens.  The palace lies at the extreme end of the park, on a pretty lake formed by the river Havel.  It certainly has some right to the name of marble palace; but it seems presumption to call it so when compared to the marble palaces of Venice, or the marble mosques of Constantinople.\\n\\nThe walls of the building are of brick left in its natural colour. The lower and upper frame-work, the window-sashes, and the portals, are all of marble.  The palace is partly surrounded by a gallery supported on marble columns.  The stairs are of fine white marble, and many of the apartments are laid with this mineral.  The interior is not nearly so luxurious as the other palaces.\\n\\nThis was the last of the sights I saw in Potsdam or the environs of Berlin; for I continued my journey to Vienna on the following day.\\n\\nBefore quitting Berlin, I must mention an arrangement which is particularly convenient for strangers--namely, the fares for hackney-carriages. One need ask no questions, but merely enter the carriage, tell the coachman where to drive, and pay him six-pence. This moderate fare is for the whole town, which is somewhat extensive.  At all the railway stations there are numbers of these vehicles, which will drive to any hotel, however far it may be from the station, for the same moderate fare.  If only all cab-drivers were so accommodating!\\n\\nOctober 1st.\\n\\nThe railway goes through Leipzic to Dresden, where I took the mail- coach for Prague at eight o'clock the same evening, and arrived there in eighteen hours.\\n\\nAs it was night when we passed, we did not enjoy the beautiful views of the Nollendorf mountain.  In the morning we passed two handsome monuments, one of them, a pyramid fifty-four feet high, to the memory of Count Colloredo, the other to the memory of the Russian troops who had fallen here; both have been erected since the wars of Napoleon.\\n\\nOn we went through charming districts to the famed bathing-place Teplitz, which is surrounded by the most beautiful scenery; and can bear comparison with the finest bathing-places of the world.\\n\\nFurther on we passed a solitary basaltic rock, Boren, which deserves attention for its beauty and as a natural curiosity.  We unfortunately hurried past it, as we wished to reach Prague before six o'clock, so that we might not miss the train to Vienna.\\n\\nMy readers may imagine our disappointment on arriving at the gates of Prague, when our passports were taken from us and not returned. In vain we referred to the vise of the boundary-town Peterswalde; in vain we spoke of our haste.  The answer always was, \\\"That is nothing to us; you can have your papers back to-morrow at the police- office.\\\"  Thus we were put off, and lost twenty-four hours.\\n\\nI must mention a little joke I had on the ride from Dresden to Prague.  Two gentlemen and a lady beside myself occupied the mail- coach; the lady happened to have read my diary of Palestine, and asked me, when she heard my name, if I were that traveller.  When I had acknowledged I was that same person, our conversation turned on that and on my present journey.  One of the gentlemen, Herr Katze, was very intelligent, and conversed in a most interesting manner on countries, nationalities, and scientific subjects.  The other gentleman was probably equally well informed, but he made less use of his acquirements.  Herr Katze remained in Teplitz, and the other gentleman proceeded with us to Vienna.  Before arriving at our destination, he asked me if Herr Katze had not requested me to mention his name in my next book, and added, that if I would promise to do the same, he would tell me his name.  I could not refrain from smiling, but assured him that Herr Katze had not thought of such a thing, and begged him not to communicate his name to me, so that he might see that we females were not so curious as we are said to be. But the poor man could not refrain from giving me his name--Nicholas B.--before we parted.  I do not insert it for two reasons:  first, because I did not promise to name him; and secondly, because I do not think it would do him any service.\\n\\nThe railway from Prague to Vienna goes over Olmutz, and makes such a considerable round, that the distance is now nearly 320 miles, and the arrangements on the railway are very imperfect.\\n\\nThere were no hotels erected on the road, and we had to be content with fruit, beer, bread, and butter, &c. the whole time.  And these provisions were not easily obtained, as we could not venture to leave the carriages.  The conductor called out at every station that we should go on directly, although the train frequently stood upwards of half an hour; but as we did not know that before, we were obliged to remain on our seats.  The conductors were not of the most amiable character, which may perhaps be ascribed to the climate; for when we approached the boundary of the Austrian states at Peterswalde, the inspector received us very gruffly.  We wished him good evening twice, but he took no notice of it, and demanded our papers in a loud and peremptory tone; he probably thought us as deaf as we thought him.  At Ganserndorf, twenty-five miles from Vienna, they took our papers from us in a very uncivil, uncourteous manner.\\n\\nOn the 4th of October, 1845, after an absence of six months, I arrived again in sight of the dear Stephen's steeple, as most of my countrywomen would say.\\n\\nI had suffered many hardships; but my love of travelling would not have been abated, nor would my courage have failed me, had they been ten times greater.  I had been amply compensated for all.  I had seen things which never occur in our common life, and had met with people as they are rarely met with--in their natural state.  And I brought back with me the recollections of my travels, which will always remain, and which will afford me renewed pleasure for years.\\n\\nAnd now I take leave of my dear readers, requesting them to accept with indulgence my descriptions, which are always true, though they may not be amusing.  If I have, as I can scarcely hope, afforded them some amusement, I trust they will in return grant me a small corner in their memories.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I beg to add an Appendix, which may not be uninteresting to many of my readers, namely:\\n\\n1. A document which I procured in Reikjavik, giving the salaries of the royal Danish officials, and the sources from whence they are paid.\\n2.
