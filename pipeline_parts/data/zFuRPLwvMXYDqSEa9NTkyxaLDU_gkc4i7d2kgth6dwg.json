Do you need another newsletter? Probably not. Buttttt, if you're interested in¬†music, interesting articles, worthwhile tweets, all things design, photography, crypto updates, NFTs, recipes, sports, and anything else that I dig, then maybe you'll enjoy this. Each week I'll share five of my favorite things I found üîé. I plan to end each newsletter with something I'm currently working on, or maybe just a picture of a basketball hoop, or perhaps even a journal entry. No fluff. No ads. I hope you enjoy it.¬†\\n\\nLet's dive in ‚¨áÔ∏è\\n\\n#### Listen üéß\\n\\nI‚Äôm always looking for new music to listen to while designing, and I recently came across [Chris Luno on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChrisLuno/featured). This is one of my favorite mixes, but all of his stuff is great. He also has an extensive [playlist on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5j6C9B81t4HOlM950r10Cw?si=95843b455b334f67) that‚Äôs worth a listen (21 hours ü§Ø).\\n\\n#### Look üëÄ\\n\\nThis past year I‚Äôve taken a deep dive into NFTs, and I'm eager to see how things shape up in 2022. I‚Äôve been collecting PFPs, art, music, exclusive passes, and a few other types of NFTs over the past year. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll end up linking to many of them throughout this year. I wanted to call out one that hasn‚Äôt launched yet. This collection is supposed to drop early this year, the art is dope, but the overall vibe and playfulness are stellar. ThDiscordrd is approaching 150k members already, so good luck getting on the whitelist!

My family and I like to start from the beginning, which is 2010 (the first year they did it), and watch all the way through until we get to the current year. I‚Äôll link to 2021 below, but if you want to watch them all, [here is the entire collection](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL590L5WQmH8fmto8QIHxA9oU7PLVa3ntk) (2010 - 2021).\\n\\n*Warning: Grab tissues!*\\n\\n#### Try üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\\n\\nThis past year I started using [my mind](https://mymind.com/) to collect things on the internet. It‚Äôs simple, intuitive, and, dare I say it‚Äôs fun to use. My favorite two uses cases have been:\\n\\n1.  Saving images ‚Üí When you save just an image (see below), it pulls the color palette and puts it to the left of the image (how sweet is that?)\\n\\n    [![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb380dfa4-c92c-4f4a-9f20-a734f49664c2\\\\_2796x1408.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb380dfa4-c92c-4f4a-9f20-a734f49664c2\\\\_2796x1408.png)\\n\\n2.  Saving text or quotes, ‚Üí I read an article the other day and enjoyed this quote, so all you have to do is highlight the words you want to keep, right-click and save. The service will strip out everything else and save the highlighted quote for you üôå\\n\\n    [![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66fdb954-aa1e-4023-9e45-8086385d7124\\\\_1324x564.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66fdb954-aa1e-4023-9e45-8086385d7124\\\\_1324x564.png)\\n\\n#### From Me üéí\\n\\nOne of my goals this year is to create more than I consume, which means less IG and more design. Less Twitter, more Procreate. Less Discord, more photography.\\n\\nFor this week, I chose a recent photo I took, very fitting for Moonlights number one üôå\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b270fd-55c1-4bf8-a021-9a5df2dfad42\\\\_6000x4000.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b270fd-55c1-4bf8-a021-9a5df2dfad42\\\\_6000x4000.jpeg)\\n\\nhoopin‚Äô under moonlight\\n\\nThanks for stopping by, see you next week.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1641542844,\"title\":\"Moonlights #1\"},\"digest\":\"jWpVjED1KKGxYTZwsmZ5aQWA12J27RtOvdwGCDU7uB4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xA647a51A1AF1cCaE559f3ea0ADdBF2a42285A3b1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"h4g0GixjnBY4SLAG07RQIVS1XRv1O4ecDk7e4D5Ewn8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ll-yoqCZp3uo5388A4RZQmK37F6gdeiv5A9cdC7M6Kg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"OOUOEaX-pJhBnodZK8XvTNt1ksNN_ksiw7tvJylrmcaX8s66Dio4YHvNZWE-dF5C72CCpi-frV9wYzGiMV1nCg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa24f5ed41226bd59fa81349337c8c3bfd17c646f0f71cc3c3451de40597d3575463903e290df1dce7c240fd099d8e3bc50b75b6ded1505737cdf25a85adb466b1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"h4g0GixjnBY4SLAG07RQIVS1XRv1O4ecDk7e4D5Ewn8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ll-yoqCZp3uo5388A4RZQmK37F6gdeiv5A9cdC7M6Kg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jWpVjED1KKGxYTZwsmZ5aQWA12J27RtOvdwGCDU7uB4\"}"
