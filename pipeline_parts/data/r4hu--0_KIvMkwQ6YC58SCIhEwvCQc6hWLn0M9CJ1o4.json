"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### 17 November 2021\\n\\nI wrote the following post on 7 November 2021 and shared it on Instagram. On 12 November, I lost a friend to suicide. I found out the news on the 13th which coincided with my birthday. I‚Äôve decided these thoughts needed to be shared as I believe my reading about my experiences may help someone out there learn something about themselves.\\n\\nTherapy has saved my mental and physical health. If you‚Äôre thinking about finding treatment, you probably should seek it - and you won‚Äôt regret it.\\n\\nLife is a roller coaster. You can‚Äôt a predict shit.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 7 November 2021\\n\\nI started going to therapy in February 2020 after my friend Mike passed from a fentanyl overdose. It was the last straw for my stability after losing Ryan to his own hand in 2016 and and Bijan at the hands of the two police in 2017.\\n\\nI needed to talk to someone, because I couldn't handle these tragedies alone and it was too much to put on my friends, family and partner any longer. I had let my life spiral out of control, literally, from 2016 until I moved home in 2019. I had made progress by moving home, but that was not enough. I stopped going to this therapist at the end of November 2020.\\n\\nI thought I was 'better', but as it turns out you can never escape death and tragedy, it is just a part of our mortality and something that comes along with life.\\n\\nJared passed away in December from a fentanyl overdose and I had learned to process loss a bit better at this point...or so I thought. March rolled around and I got some really tragic news about a friend who I worked with and again - I needed help.\\n\\nI started seeing a new therapist in May 2021 as I was also about to graduate and that fact alone was stressing me out. I *needed* help again. Now, I don't think I'm going to stop. These therapists are really the only doctor that I have gone to since going to college in 2013.\\n\\n**We need to normalize Mental-Health Care as Health Care.**\\n\\nWe need to de-stigmatize talking to an unbiased person about our problems. From my experiences, I think it's most helpful thing you could do if you're struggling. Why? Because sometimes someone who doesn't know you at all will be able to tell what you need to know better than you, your friends, or family.\\n\\nTherapy helped me learn to take control of my own actions, so that I could handle this roller coaster that is life just a little bit better. It helped me begin to reconnect with friends and family. It has also helped me *stay* clean for almost 25 months now. \\n\\nIf you think you should get help, please do. If you're curious, hit me up.\\n\\n‚ô•Ô∏è Josh\",\"timestamp\":1637208695,\"title\":\"üß† Therapy & Mental Health\"},\"digest\":\"gOIvBzBkt5pHL5DxPJTWkIKKXAUmfOAAQS0kZcoWj6Q\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x186Ea56F0a40c5593A697B3E804968b8C5920Ff3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"557rnSLP4pc0WumAVq_iAMEAeMdxTKqzTjImnd2bhws\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Kqiwe5KKCOh2eKA_szp9x9kbC4-SPTk24FcivSQTNus\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"nJBR0KD5R_qBmbL8zxvbRzMK49NVr26WK9hG8dZppEB-n7tPUEn_VfQT88xm6MxT4Gz2RBixvxsZJCzf-3jFZw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xcc0904d769a42549dccd89ff81422cf5bd434fe59a8346fd8e1a1af23befab4c56e44303fbbd964815fa8b8706f39202fc48a4d7e20aa5b2220d9cec226078091b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"557rnSLP4pc0WumAVq_iAMEAeMdxTKqzTjImnd2bhws\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Kqiwe5KKCOh2eKA_szp9x9kbC4-SPTk24FcivSQTNus\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"gOIvBzBkt5pHL5DxPJTWkIKKXAUmfOAAQS0kZcoWj6Q\"}"
