This year, we will be hosting Demo Day in the [Cryptovoxels Metaverse](https://bit.ly/LHXMetaverse), in collaboration with [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/).\\n\\n\\\"Our move from [real-world Demo Days](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGi5rSYpKqxbb--NQ771DnZq9kbrMhFa2) to the Metaverse represents the Web 3-native approach that we've taken with our accelerator program this year,\\\" our Program Lead [Stefano Bury](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=0xbury) explains. \\\"As we go beyond a broad program covering business strategy, fundraising, and marketing in the past, towards a crypto-native, tailored program focused on Web 3 topics such as tokenomics this time around, we thought that hosting our Demo Day in the Metaverse would encapsulate that Web 3 approach.\\\"\\n\\nLongHashX is our 7th accelerator cohort. We had previously partnered with ecosystems such as Polkadot, Filecoin, and Algorand to grow more than 40 projects, which have raised more than $100m in the past 3 years.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JrMFwZXpNXks5sv0BA5wh.png?height=1080&width=1920)\\n\\nLongHashX is segmented into 2 tracks: the DeFi track enabled by [Asia DeFi Network](https://asiadefi.network/) and the Filecoin Frontier Accelerator track partnered with [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/).\\n\\n**DeFi Track, enabled by [Asia DeFi Network](https://asiadefi.network/):**\\n\\nThe Asia DeFi Network track is composed of 5 projects.\\n\\n* [Manta Network](https://manta.network/): The privacy layer on Polkadot\\n* [ApeBoard](https://apeboard.finance/dashboard): A cross-chain DeFi dashboard\\n* [Nibbl](https://www.noncefinance.com/): An NFT fractionalization protocol that offers guaranteed liquidity and an easy buyout process\\n* [Smart Token Labs](https://smarttokenlabs.com/): Enhances utility and value of NFTs with a suite of tools (including attestation and merging of derivatives)\\n* [GoodGhosting](https://goodghosting.com/#/pools): Gamified habit-forming DeFi applications which reward saving\\n\\n**Filecoin Frontier Accelerator Track, partnered with Protocol Labs**\\n\\nThe Filecoin Frontier Accelerator Track is composed of 4 projects:\\n\\n* [Grape Protocol](http://grapes.network): A tooling stack for communities to create decentralized social networks on Solana\\n* [Lit Protocol](http://litprotocol.com/): Tooling dApp developers, DAOs, and Web 2 companies through a decentralized access control network that links off-chain content/experiences to on-chain conditions (wallet holdings & history)\\n* [Matters Lab](https://matters.news/about): A Web 3 social media platform where users can collaboratively create and monetize digital assets, while controlling their own data\\n* [Lighthouse](http://lighthouse.ninja/): A permanent file storage protocol built on Filecoin that allows the ability to pay once and store forever\\n\\n![Our parcel of land on CryptoVoxels (a work in progress for Jan 17th/18th)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6H4r2ZIFQid9QtyRJoIlK.png?height=1212&width=2698)\\n\\n**Stand a chance to win 1 of 12 NFTs**\\n\\nTo reward attendees of the first-ever Demo Day in the Metaverse, we will reward attendees with a portion of a 1/1 NFT fractionalized by [Nibbl](https://www.noncefinance.com/).\\n\\nAttendees will also enter a raffle to win 12 exclusive NFTs.
