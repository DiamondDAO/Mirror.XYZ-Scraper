For early protocols, the most important and most difficult problem to solve is **generating liquidity for your token**. If market participants (primarily whales) cannot easily move in and out of your token with low slippage...your odds of success are low.\\n\\nThe undisputed **king of DeFi liquidity is Curve**. Curve is the largest DeFi protocol in the market with over $22 billion in TVL across 7 chains. If you want liquidity for your token (especially stables) - having a relevant pool on Curve is important.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tSnxlmj4w33z7vJ2WcxlJ.png?height=799&width=1540)\\n\\nBut what drives liquidity on Curve? **Liquidity Incentives** - users want to provide liquidity to the pools with the best returns. Who controls how incentives are distributed on Curve? **Owners of [$CRV](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CRV&src=cashtag_click).**\\n\\nSo what is happening? Other **DeFi apps, whales, and protocols** are accumulating as much [$CRV](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CRV&src=cashtag_click) as possible to be able to **control the vote** on **which pools should receive liquidity incentives.**\\n\\nHow big has this game become? Well... The third biggest DeFi protocol in the market by TVL is literally a project with the sole focus of accumulating as much [$CRV](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CRV&src=cashtag_click) as possible to control the vote. Convex now owns \\\\~51% of the circulating supply of [$CRV](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CRV&src=cashtag_click).\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d81t_EyjiueB7ilPUjkpU.png?height=719&width=1526)\\n\\nSo what happens now? Early stage tokens who need liquidity **\\\"bribe\\\" the Convex** Community to vote with their [$CRV](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CRV&src=cashtag_click) to direct liquidity incentives to their pool. **If successful -> higher APY for your pool -> more liquidity -> increased likelihood of success for your token.**\\n\\nAnd who is bribing? All relevant projects, especially stablecoins, who understand the importance of having liquid pools on Ethereum. Notably [$SPELL](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SPELL&src=cashtag_click) for [$MIM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MIM&src=cashtag_click), [$LUNA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LUNA&src=cashtag_click) for [$UST](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24UST&src=cashtag_click), and [$FRAX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FRAX&src=cashtag_click) are paying millions of dollars for votes.\\n\\nWhere do we go from here?\\n\\nMy general thought is the Curve War only intensifies as we move into a **multi-chain future.**\\n\\n1. **Curve is going multi-chain -> more reason for wars.**\\n2. Tokens non-native to Ethereum still desire liquidity on Ethereum.\\n\\n   And who else is relevant in The Curve Wars?\\n   1. $BTRFLY @redactedcartel \\n   * an $OHM fork creating a blackhole for accumulating $CRV and $CVX to compete in the War.\\n   1. $YFI\\n      @iearnfinance\\n   * with a new tokenomics model, stakers will receive more control in directing incentives.\",\"timestamp\":1641475235,\"title\":\"The Curve War\"},\"digest\":\"gjc13SJY-C0scshA3Jo1rxpRrXpBSkcssCJA6PzjMy0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd8E93E06a84581c10DC1F9F60ec91f0F38994f1b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"a_dLERd4Cdhgh6ry9Yrs5OcBF3DZRTMLU7lo2MyzU9U\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MrUMilaNceSEdYCTf-Dl1YVGchaRIPZPad-TuPvv354\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"uMNfZFrLQhT5Weg5KyeON5et78H4qLJdtuagAutvMI_MW7FJn9ylvF8IEG6MVvUVaapnJ7ESZWhNwqwJcU1Arw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x08a7d98f6049e83344439b1e6456022e902321dd36a860487d9259b6b59ae18e5371ddb10a61a785172c817e9acf134fe8046ce86d14e87ad0ce4dc0b4b331751b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"a_dLERd4Cdhgh6ry9Yrs5OcBF3DZRTMLU7lo2MyzU9U\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MrUMilaNceSEdYCTf-Dl1YVGchaRIPZPad-TuPvv354\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"gjc13SJY-C0scshA3Jo1rxpRrXpBSkcssCJA6PzjMy0\"}"
