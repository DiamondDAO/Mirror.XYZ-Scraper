"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Hello frens! I’m Josh.\\n\\nI’m a 30 year old chef, dad, and web developer who was born & raised in Florida. I’m currently studying Javascript & Solidity using resources like freeCodeCamp, buildspace, & youtube videos from awesome developers like Nader Dabit & Austin Griffith.\\n\\n### What have I been working on?\\n\\nLately, when I’m not at work or spending time with my kids, I’ve been:\\n\\n* working on my [personal site](https://joshmccoy.dev) (*which seems to be a constant work-in-progress*), utilizing Wordpress & Elementor, and trying to build out my portfolio\\n* streaming co-learning Javascript on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX7mTRL9WJUjOLE6PC2UmxQ) & [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/joshmccoydev)\\n* [earning](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x3cd266509d127d0eac42f4474f57d0526804b44e/962) [NFTs](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x3cd266509d127d0eac42f4474f57d0526804b44e/1056) for completing buildspace projects\\n* launching my own [NFT project](https://solvibes.xyz) ([twitter](https://twitter.com/solvibesxyz)) benefitting mental health charities, on Solana, using Metaplex Candy Machine (back-end finished this past week, front-end being finished now)\\n* helping build a [DAO](https://wellnessdao.xyz) ([twitter](https://twitter.com/wellnes_DAO)) focused on normalizing mental health care and providing resources as a public good alongside my friend Josh C. Stein([twitter](https://twitter.com/joshcstein)).\\n* participating in [Talent Protocol’s](https://www.talentprotocol.com/) closed beta as one of the first 20 talents to create their social token & have supporters earn rewards simply for supporting my growth as a creator/developer\\n\\n### What are my goals?\\n\\nI am trying to transition from my career as a chef at a steakhouse to a career in web3 by the time I turn 31 in February *(I’ve set up a* [Mirror crowdfund](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/crowdfunds/0x2a27a06cC65189B89Bc0C8e6f2c4BC38d0A112f9) *to aid in this transition incase anyone would like to invest in my career and be rewarded with a 15% share of my next 4 years income <3)*.\\n\\n[crowdfund://0x2a27a06cC65189B89Bc0C8e6f2c4BC38d0A112f9?features=overview,backers](crowdfund://0x2a27a06cC65189B89Bc0C8e6f2c4BC38d0A112f9?features=overview,backers)\\n\\nMy goal is to take on an entry-level or junior front-end role, in order to gain the opportunity to learn more about back-end in the future, and ultimately become a full-time full-stack developer. In the meantime I am taking in as much as I can learn in the web3 development space & passing that information on in the form of co-learning streams, blog posts, twitter threads & building out an introductory documentation, using Notion, to help onboard people to each aspect of the web3 space safely & easily.\\n\\n### What’s next?\\n\\nI’ve got a lot on my plate with what I am trying to learn and build, along with my full-time job, but I plan on setting a streaming schedule I can stick to and remaining transparent with what I’m studying & building in public. To keep up with my day-to-day *(even if only to post “gm” in the chat)* you can join my community [Discord](https://discord.gg/6fM5X6TbHV) where I will drop notifications when I go live, build good habits with my frens & keep each other accountable, and just talk shop about anything web development/web3/crypto.\\n\\n### Want to connect?\\n\\nI would love to discuss & potentially collaborate on any projects, job opportunities, or just to have a chat.
