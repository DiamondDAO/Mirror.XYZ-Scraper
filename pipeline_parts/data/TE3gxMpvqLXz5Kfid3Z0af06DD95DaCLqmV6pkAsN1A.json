It features an 8-bit aesthetic that shares similarities to retro side-scrolling games, such as Ninja Gaiden, Snatcher, Shadowrun, and Flashback.\\n\\nPresented in nostalgia-inducing 16 bit, this drop is my homage to the classic Sega and Nintendo games from the 80s and 90s that I played a lot growing up. In other words, the narrative is presented like texts (dialogues/monologues) in cutscenes under the artwork — the same way pretty much every gamer in the world remembers the old platform/RPG games from the last decades.\\n\\n![Cyber City start screen](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G3hIqPi9KM58uQ2zZhBYi.gif?height=1080&width=1080)\\n\\n**The synopsis of the story:**\\n\\nPlanning to conquer Cyber City, an alien race called the Egg Robots sends their heaviest weapons to the city, controlling most of the buildings and destroying the defenses.\\n\\nPart of the Robots' plan is to spread an uncontrollable virus to wipe out a third of the population of the helpless city. People go into hiding without knowing that unlikely heroes are on their way to counterattack the invaders.\\n\\nA young boy named Marvin, who can be reckless sometimes. A Clone Cop, who is emotionally remote. Two different heroes — an odd couple that must join forces to form a resistance. Together, they must fight against the Egg Robots to protect Cyber City and its pacific and open-minded citizens.\\n\\n***Cyber City Stories* is available now only on Rarible.**\\n\\n[ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/6.660341732787832e+23](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/6.660341732787832e+23)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1641299483,\"title\":\"Cyber City Stories - Part One\"},\"digest\":\"wFjJAwyO4uZ6MzA1qSbPfYvBT6Wle9NzxMBBdmY8FXc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x16bD150e1fb6E973b06B465d8dc853b8cb69A975\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"yo6vslcjSTKd7AwYhbgYXPrsvILSuibTwwTyvrRryIM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"y3RvN4cYFc3nQz_4_GoIuEXDEvJF0t87rmMcEbbI0K0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"x4G180OpvayOoqilroSoPsSYPbHdXD8tbSknQZ24jXHHtXwqwCb1CKpdqJ0VQSUJiD_Wqx_PyV2SxPmjEGLN1Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb73b9d44381c6ca3f4e17d0c5fecfefe5107094a08f31b3e2bcf450e26302fcb79d16061ccf9d62ae884927a21eb65713f41f45effeac6c08fe5294b4ae9962b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"yo6vslcjSTKd7AwYhbgYXPrsvILSuibTwwTyvrRryIM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"y3RvN4cYFc3nQz_4_GoIuEXDEvJF0t87rmMcEbbI0K0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"eLKSoJCwhrwTW6SkvKfzmBJ2Da2OnQzJ4-IS2ND0O9E\"}"
