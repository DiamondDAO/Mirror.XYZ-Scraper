"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Labor vs. Capital\\n\\nIn 1817, the English economist David Ricardo presented his labor theory of value:\\n\\n> The value of a commodity, or the quantity of any other commodity for which it will exchange, depends on the relative quantity of labour which is necessary for its production.\\n\\nIn other words, the value of an object comes from the amount of labor that went into producing it. In some cases, this insight seems pretty obvious and easy to accept. Take art, for example: an oil painting created over several years, by a skilled painter who has spent years mastering the craft of oil painting, should naturally be worth more than a doodle made by an untrained five-year-old. Other cases are more complicated. Consider ‘Orange Marilyn,’ an Andy Warhol silkscreen painting that (reportedly) sold for over $200 million in a private sale in 2018, making it one of the most expensive artworks every sold. Because the work was produced by imprinting an existing photograph, the amount of labor that went into producing it was undoubtedly much less than your average Renaissance or Impressionist painting. You could argue that additional labor indirectly contributed to this painting’s value: say, Marilyn Monroe’s acting career, Andy Warhol’s work as a cultural influencer and public figure. But even so, it’s harder to explain why this painting had so much ‘value’ based on labor alone.\\n\\n![Orange Marilyn](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZPXiTKOsSGI4800XDnnJJ.jpeg?height=385&width=684)\\n\\nWith all due to respect to Mr. Ricardo, you and I both know that the modern economy isn’t just about exchanging labor for value. There’s another significant input that tends to swallow labor whole: capital. Take sharing economy services like ride-sharing, for example. Because the companies behind them (Uber, Lyft, etc.) are highly capitalized, they can afford to charge lower prices, even if it means losing money on each ride. The platform’s growing user base creates network effects, economies of scale, and (possibly) an oligopoly or even monopoly on the market for its service. A lot of value gets created, and it goes to the company’s investors: a reward for providing capital. As we all know, there’s a lot more money in providing capital than in providing labor: capital just has a certain gravity, pulling in exponentially compounding value as it deployed. Labor doesn’t seem to have that property. And that’s one of the fundamental issues with capitalism: capital accumulates, labor doesn’t, and the result is inequality.\\n\\n## Digital Work\\n\\nBut what about *digital* labor? To be clear, I’m not talking about work in the real world that is mediated by a digital platform (i.e. driving for a ride-sharing company). I’m talking about about work *within a digital world*. Here’s an example: the video game Runescape. There’s a great *Planet Money* episode about gold farmers, players who created Runescape accounts solely to accumulate Runescape gold. Interestingly, the in-game gold can be sold for real US dollars to other Runescape players who want to avoid having to spend a bunch of time grinding for gold. For players living in Venezuela, where the national currency has experienced extreme instability in the past, gold farming in Runescape was actually a more stable source of income than working a job in the ‘real world’ with wages in the local currency.\\n\\n![Killing Green Dragons](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zB4bI28XmApjky7hiqEtM.png?height=725&width=1178)\\n\\nGold farming is an interesting example, because it’s a repetitive task: if you spend all of your in-game time killing dragons, you’ll accumulate gold at a linear rate.  Add it all up, and you have a system that actually *does* seem to conform to a labor theory of value: time spent ‘working’ on killing dragons can be directly converted to gold. Now, most likely capital *eventually* plays a role (the more gold a farmer accumulates, the better weapons and equipment they can buy, the more they’ll level up, and the easier it will be to kill dragons faster and faster). But at least for a brief moment in time, the combination of a low barrier to entry (Runescape is an old game and can run on just about any computer), and very specific economic conditions created a kind of digital work where labor and value were correlated quite powerfully, and could be exchanged one for the other without the distortions of capital. The point is: digital worlds are a kind of Wild West, where the rules of late-stage capitalism don’t yet apply, and society has a window of opportunity to write new rules.\\n\\nOkay, that’s fine, but it doesn’t change the fundamental disparity between capital, which is accumulative, and labor, which isn’t. However, based on the building blocks that currently exist in the crypto-economy, I think that there’s the intriguing potential for a new kind of incentive mechanism that *does* change this balance. Fair warning: here’s where things get sort of techno-Utopian/Crypto-Bro-y. But bear with me.\\n\\n## Crypto-Economics\\n\\nLet’s start with an example: CryptoKitties. CryptoKitties is a game where players can buy, breed, and sell virtual cats. Like Runescape, it’s a game where players can spend time playing the game, then exchange the output of that play time (digital cats) for real money (the Ethereum cryptocurrency). Silly as it might sound, there’s a lot of money in this game; these cats can trade for thousands, even millions of dollars, depending on their attributes. Unlike Runescape, though, the game is built on a blockchain. What this means is that the underlying *data* for the game—the cats, the currency—is all stored in a public, decentralized database, rather than being controlled by the game makers. In theory, this means that the players aren’t actually tied to the CryptoKitties platform at all. If the company that makes the game disappears, or stops working on the game, the cats will still be there. If they wanted to, the players could even pick up their cats and take them to a different game. And that’s where things get interesting.\\n\\n![Felis Proudpants, CryptoKitty #1782422](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tx6Vvm204_ran0ZsnPhOP.png?height=1302&width=1573)\\n\\nSo, going back to the title of the article: can cryptocurrencies fix capitalism? An optimistic answer goes like this: blockchain-based digital platforms enable \\n\\n as a new platform is bootstrapping itself in the blockchain/Web3 world, it can introduce a token and pay it out to contributors to the platform. These tokens have a utility within the platform, but they also represent *ownership*, perhaps coming with some kind of governance power or wealth derived from the growth of the platform. The optimistic vision is that as the platform grows, the *contributors* accrue value: in essence, exchanging labor for actual equity. Labor, not just capital, can be used to purchase ownership. Those Runescape gold minders would gradually become not just participants, but owners of the game. That’s the rosy picture, at least.\\n\\nWill it work? I think that this all comes down to the following question: do cryptocurrencies and crypto tokens actually represent a *stake* in the underlying system? There’s no defined answer; it all depends on how an individual token is designed. In some cases, tokens are backed by an underlying asset (i.e. a share in a liquidity pool containing ETH). In others, tokens have utility that could more or less be defined as ownership, but don’t necessarily provide the guarantees that say, owning stock in a centralized company would. So, will a market for such tokens actually treat the tokens as an *asset*, representing ownership? What does it actually mean to *own* a decentralized protocol, anyway?\\n\\nIn a world of rapidly increasing economic inequality, my hope is that Web3 is a countervailing force that distributes ownership in digital platforms more equally. Perhaps the decentralized ethos and in-built economic incentives of the blockchain will deliver this optimistic future. But Web3 will be built by software developers, and therein lies risk: perhaps high educational barriers to entry, combined with greed, will ultimately cause the decentralized web to be built with the same accumulative model of Web2. We’ll just have to wait and find out.\",\"timestamp\":1634573390,\"title\":\"Can Cryptocurrency Fix Capitalism?\"},\"digest\":\"bJNq8V-7Hp6aq_GNCFJTs3Xql7SP7Oo6MYHXQe7lwiQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd2E7dacEdf5e8d88E69080232fE7927619010aA1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NekFyInm7zSr2w5bFQfZtgXIhNjJPng3V0N6D7XIL9k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4uYW06UOaHIpOT83GhC_gbdxKzDg4dPGmIxTBRBvuSY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"K9UK5GUIbola0cbF61fQKhqYPalx3FPmEESv2-7jLuGIEWfc6jCpsp7SXyg0tI_W10yLZtf8AvsXjW5v4Wgf_g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb43fae97c3c73fe9b70b7761d0b33f62b1ddebb5ca83cec52b8e24dbbe9696592a742e68149f537aa4923abfeedfc335f958bfd07cca736f4265b8ee0ec7689c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NekFyInm7zSr2w5bFQfZtgXIhNjJPng3V0N6D7XIL9k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4uYW06UOaHIpOT83GhC_gbdxKzDg4dPGmIxTBRBvuSY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"8ykp-6kHWJzsH0CNcyrpkA530s92J0s5LAeJMvwaCww\"}"
