"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"We all wish to get into the amazing world of defi and earn some of those sweet passive yields from our assets. But in reality, the learning curve is quite complex in defi and any mistake could come with a huge cost.\\n\\nOn a deeper glace, defi is not as passive as most ***#degens*** claim it to be. For day-to-day people, it's not a cakewalk to check all the liquidity pools, staked and leveraged assets, and actively manage their positions.\\n\\nIf only there is a way for people to buy once and not have to maintain their positions on Defi protocols while earning the rewards…\\n\\n## What if I tell you such Dapp already exists?\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/760/1\\\\*u3SNiCTkZfwnZQmYJhsSxg.gif)\\n\\ncredits: [gifer.com](https://gifer.com/)\\n\\n## Yes, It is xToken!\\n\\nxToken products are simple “set it & forget it” type wrapped ERC-20 tokens that make defi simple. They allow users to mint wrapped versions of popular defi protocols that make it easy for the users to easily manage their staking, governance, leverage & liquidity pool positions in those protocols.\\n\\n## “ERC-20? What about the ETH GAS fee?”, you may ask.\\n\\nBut, [xToken Team](https://medium.com/u/e67ad38859aa?source=post_page-----7e993ffa197f-----------------------------------) got you covered there too. No more, we need to pay those mammoth of a gas fee ⛽️ as xToken is live on Arbitrum L2. Now we can earn those easy defi yields while paying a very little gas fee. Let's see more about that process.\\n\\n## Bridging assets to Arbitrum\\n\\nTo buy xToken products in Arbitrum, we need our assets in the Arbitrum chain. There is two way to bridge our assets to the Arbitum chain.\\n\\nI would suggest you bridge sufficient **ETH** & **USDC** as per need.\\n\\n> ***Note***\\\\*: If you haven't added Arbitrum to your wallet until now, Visit ***[chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/)*** ➡️ connect your wallet & search for Arbitrum ➡️ select “**Arbitrum one**” network & click “**add to wallet**”.\\\\*\\n\\n## Option 1: Using Arbitrum Bridge\\n\\n* \\\\*\\\\*visit 🔗 \\\\*\\\\*[bridge.arbitrum.io](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/)\\n* connect your wallet & switch to Ethereum mainnet\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*0y7UFKB-BucMD2K1GbIw1Q.png)\\n\\nNote that the demo screens are taken in testnet, mainnet should show as Arbitrum One bridge.\\n\\n* Select the token and enter the amount you wish to bridge to Arbitrum, click deposit & approve the transaction.\\n* Wait for \\\\~10 mins for the bridged assets to reflect on the Arbitrum chain.\\n\\n## Option 2: Using Hop Protocol\\n\\n* [Hop Protocol](https://medium.com/u/54bb04284e4d?source=post_page-----7e993ffa197f-----------------------------------) is a hassle-free way to bridge assets across multiple networks. Kind of a one-stop solution for your bridging needs.\\n* \\\\*\\\\*visit 🔗 \\\\*\\\\*[app.hop.exchange](https://app.hop.exchange/)\\n* Select the token to send (ETH or USDC)\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*R0l2bLGTvHhwPIT5YeoTHA.png)\\n\\n* Select Mainnet in the “from” tab & Arbitrum in the “To” tab, Enter the amount of tokens to be bridged.\\n* Review the Estimation & click approve ➡️ send.\\n\\nNow that you’ve bridged the required assets to Arbitrum, let go purchase some xToken Products.\\n\\n## xToken Products\\n\\nWhile xToken in the Ethereum network has a wide variety of products available for various strategies, in arbitrum there are only a few. let’s explore them.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*Jo0nkumSpPQCIl8u17boiw.png)\\n\\n## **Leverage products: xETH3x & xBTC3x**\\n\\nThese are ERC-20 tokens that approximate the performance of \\\\*\\\\*3x longed position on ETH & BTC \\\\*\\\\*respectively. This requires no active participation from the user to manage the leverage ratio and will be maintained at 3x, it is a set-and-forget token.\\n\\nUsers can mint these tokens with ETH/WBTC and cash out anytime by burning these tokens to ETH/WBTC (given that redemption liquidity is available)\\n\\nxToken charges a fee of 0.4% for mint & burn of xETH3x and 0.75% for xBTC3x.\\n\\n## Liquidity Provision Products: xU3LPa & xU3LPb\\n\\nThese are ERC-20 tokens that act as a fungible wrapper for **uniswap V3 LPs**. xU3LPa is for the USDC-DAI pair & xU3LPb is for the USDC-USDT pair. This requires no active participation from the user. LP trading fees are reinvested automatically into pools (auto compounding).\\n\\nHolders can mint & redeem this with/to any of the underlying assets at any time, given that buffer liquidity is available.\\n\\nxToken charges a fee of 0.1% on mint & burn of these tokens.\\n\\n## What is that? You say “I’m sold on xToken products”? Wait let me shill it a bit more!\\n\\n## Free to mint GM/GA/GN/WAGMI NFTs for xToken Arbitrum users\\n\\nYep, you read that right.
