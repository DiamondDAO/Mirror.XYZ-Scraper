"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The Jessie had gone ashore half-way between the village and Neal Island.  It was not till nightfall that two of the crew arrived, reporting the drowning of Captain Oleson and of the one remaining boy.  As for the Jessie, from what they told him Sheldon could not but conclude that she was a total loss.  Further to hearten him, he was taken by a shivering fit.  In half an hour he was burning up.  And he knew that at least another day must pass before he could undertake even the smallest dose of quinine.  He crawled under a heap of blankets, and a little later found himself laughing aloud.  He had surely reached the limit of disaster. Barring earthquake or tidal-wave, the worst had already befallen him.  The Flibberty-Gibbet was certainly safe in Mboli Pass.  Since nothing worse could happen, things simply had to mend.  So it was, shivering under his blankets, that he laughed, until the house- boys, with heads together, marvelled at the devils that were in him.\\n\\nCHAPTER IV--JOAN LACKLAND\\n\\nBy the second day of the northwester, Sheldon was in collapse from his fever.  It had taken an unfair advantage of his weak state, and though it was only ordinary malarial fever, in forty-eight hours it had run him as low as ten days of fever would have done when he was in condition.  But the dysentery had been swept away from Berande. A score of convalescents lingered in the hospital, but they were improving hourly.  There had been but one more death--that of the man whose brother had wailed over him instead of brushing the flies away.\\n\\nOn the morning of the fourth day of his fever, Sheldon lay on the veranda, gazing dimly out over the raging ocean.  The wind was falling, but a mighty sea was still thundering in on Berande beach, the flying spray reaching in as far as the flagstaff mounds, the foaming wash creaming against the gate-posts.  He had taken thirty grains of quinine, and the drug was buzzing in his ears like a nest of hornets, making his hands and knees tremble, and causing a sickening palpitation of the stomach.  Once, opening his eyes, he saw what he took to be an hallucination.  Not far out, and coming in across the Jessie's anchorage, he saw a whale-boat's nose thrust skyward on a smoky crest and disappear naturally, as an actual whale-boat's nose should disappear, as it slid down the back of the sea.  He knew that no whale-boat should be out there, and he was quite certain no men in the Solomons were mad enough to be abroad in such a storm.\\n\\nBut the hallucination persisted.  A minute later, chancing to open his eyes, he saw the whale-boat, full length, and saw right into it as it rose on the face of a wave.  He saw six sweeps at work, and in the stern, clearly outlined against the overhanging wall of white, a man who stood erect, gigantic, swaying with his weight on the steering-sweep.  This he saw, and an eighth man who crouched in the bow and gazed shoreward.  But what startled Sheldon was the sight of a woman in the stern-sheets, between the stroke-oar and the steersman.  A woman she was, for a braid of her hair was flying, and she was just in the act of recapturing it and stowing it away beneath a hat that for all the world was like his own \\\"Baden-Powell.\\\"\\n\\nThe boat disappeared behind the wave, and rose into view on the face of the following one.  Again he looked into it.  The men were dark-skinned, and larger than Solomon Islanders, but the woman, he could plainly see, was white.  Who she was, and what she was doing there, were thoughts that drifted vaguely through his consciousness.  He was too sick to be vitally interested, and, besides, he had a half feeling that it was all a dream; but he noted that the men were resting on their sweeps, while the woman and the steersman were intently watching the run of seas behind them.\\n\\n\\\"Good boatmen,\\\" was Sheldon's verdict, as he saw the boat leap forward on the face of a huge breaker, the sweeps plying swiftly to keep her on that front of the moving mountain of water that raced madly for the shore.  It was well done.  Part full of water, the boat was flung upon the beach, the men springing out and dragging its nose to the gate-posts.  Sheldon had called vainly to the house-boys, who, at the moment, were dosing the remaining patients in the hospital.  He knew he was unable to rise up and go down the path to meet the newcomers, so he lay back in the steamer-chair, and watched for ages while they cared for the boat.  The woman stood to one side, her hand resting on the gate.  Occasionally surges of sea water washed over her feet, which he could see were encased in rubber sea-boots.  She scrutinized the house sharply, and for some time she gazed at him steadily.  At last, speaking to two of the men, who turned and followed her, she started up the path.\\n\\nSheldon attempted to rise, got half up out of his chair, and fell back helplessly.  He was surprised at the size of the men, who loomed like giants behind her.  Both were six-footers, and they were heavy in proportion.  He had never seen islanders like them. They were not black like the Solomon Islanders, but light brown; and their features were larger, more regular, and even handsome.\\n\\nThe woman--or girl, rather, he decided--walked along the veranda toward him.  The two men waited at the head of the steps, watching curiously.  The girl was angry; he could see that.  Her gray eyes were flashing, and her lips were quivering.  That she had a temper, was his thought.  But the eyes were striking.  He decided that they were not gray after all, or, at least, not all gray.  They were large and wide apart, and they looked at him from under level brows.  Her face was cameo-like, so clear cut was it.  There were other striking things about her--the cowboy Stetson hat, the heavy braids of brown hair, and the long-barrelled 38 Colt's revolver that hung in its holster on her hip.\\n\\n\\\"Pretty hospitality, I must say,\\\" was her greeting, \\\"letting strangers sink or swim in your front yard.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I--I beg your pardon,\\\" he stammered, by a supreme effort dragging himself to his feet.\\n\\nHis legs wobbled under him, and with a suffocating sensation he began sinking to the floor.  He was aware of a feeble gratification as he saw solicitude leap into her eyes; then blackness smote him, and at the moment of smiting him his thought was that at last, and for the first time in his life, he had fainted.\\n\\nThe ringing of the big bell aroused him.  He opened his eyes and found that he was on the couch indoors.  A glance at the clock told him that it was six, and from the direction the sun's rays streamed into the room he knew that it was morning.  At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.  Then on the wall he saw a Stetson hat hanging, and beneath it a full cartridge-belt and a long-barrelled 38 Colt's revolver.  The slender girth of the belt told its feminine story, and he remembered the whale-boat of the day before and the gray eyes that flashed beneath the level brows.  She it must have been who had just rung the bell.  The cares of the plantation rushed upon him, and he sat up in bed, clutching at the wall for support as the mosquito screen lurched dizzily around him.  He was still sitting there, holding on, with eyes closed, striving to master his giddiness, when he heard her voice.\\n\\n\\\"You'll lie right down again, sir,\\\" she said.\\n\\nIt was sharply imperative, a voice used to command.  At the same time one hand pressed him back toward the pillow while the other caught him from behind and eased him down.\\n\\n\\\"You've been unconscious for twenty-four hours now,\\\" she went on, \\\"and I have taken charge.  When I say the word you'll get up, and not until then.  Now, what medicine do you take?--quinine?  Here are ten grains.  That's right.  You'll make a good patient.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My dear madame,\\\" he began.\\n\\n\\\"You musn't speak,\\\" she interrupted, \\\"that is, in protest. Otherwise, you can talk.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But the plantation--\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1638930203,\"title\":\"By eleven a messenger arrived from Balesuna village, dispatched by Seelee\"},\"digest\":\"iDwraf4j0yBNK349IJ0eYUyULavs4tEkw41B5TmqXZA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6e5524266431C8A2Cd3e28b5B838834791C3533a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"k0hpjHc3nS70kfKVonqFBjl91jLccf5rKm2gr7wXh9M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"RsEG2Krxe0LbI2fJV9T5qQ_6uWBmEZF1MPL7yNlwtcg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ZOibn28Qy7fdWP-5GBPfCsTX9XUFSdkWJbpk8lXN5KCKy7BwFy1fXPita5wB4B48tkn6t-1G2f1hfPFZYvAhrA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa631c11039b17f872ac4e442a87baef38f9abe2434d8a1fd817635749af763e859521d53abbbac017b28c88a71e449b4e6ccb05d988358157c47aa4fbaf723391c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"k0hpjHc3nS70kfKVonqFBjl91jLccf5rKm2gr7wXh9M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"RsEG2Krxe0LbI2fJV9T5qQ_6uWBmEZF1MPL7yNlwtcg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"iDwraf4j0yBNK349IJ0eYUyULavs4tEkw41B5TmqXZA\"}"
