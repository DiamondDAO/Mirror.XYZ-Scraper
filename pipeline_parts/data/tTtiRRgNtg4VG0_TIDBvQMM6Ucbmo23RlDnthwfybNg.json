There's monsieur,\\\"\\n\\nhe said, motioning to the Comte de Serizy. \\\"I'll bet whatever you\\n\\nlike--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Betting whatever you like means, in France, betting nothing at all,\\\"\\n\\nsaid Mistigris's master.\\n\\n\\\"I'll bet whatever you like,\\\" repeated Georges, incisively, \\\"that\\n\\nmonsieur here is covered with stars.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said the count, laughing, \\\"I have the grand cross of the\\n\\nLegion of honor, that of Saint Andrew of Russia, that of the Prussian\\n\\nEagle, that of the Annunciation of Sardinia, and the Golden Fleece.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Beg pardon,\\\" said Mistigris, \\\"are they all in the coucou?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hey! that brick-colored old fellow goes it strong!\\\" whispered Georges\\n\\nto Oscar. \\\"What was I saying?--oh! I know. I don't deny that I adore\\n\\nthe Emperor--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I served under him,\\\" said the count.\\n\\n\\\"What a man he was, wasn't he?\\\" cried Georges.\\n\\n\\\"A man to whom I owe many obligations,\\\" replied the count, with a\\n\\nsilly expression that was admirably assumed.\\n\\n\\\"For all those crosses?\\\" inquired Mistigris.\\n\\n\\\"And what quantities of snuff he took!\\\" continued Monsieur de Serizy.\\n\\n\\\"He carried it loose in his pockets,\\\" said Georges.\\n\\n\\\"So I've been told,\\\" remarked Pere Leger with an incredulous look.\\n\\n\\\"Worse than that; he chewed and smoked,\\\" continued Georges. \\\"I saw him\\n\\nsmoking, in a queer way, too, at Waterloo, when Marshal Soult took him\\n\\nround the waist and flung him into his carriage, just as he had seized\\n\\na musket and was going to charge the English--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You were at Waterloo!\\\" cried Oscar, his eyes stretching wide open.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, young man, I did the campaign of 1815. I was a captain at Mont-\\n\\nSaint-Jean, and I retired to the Loire, after we were all disbanded.\\n\\nFaith! I was disgusted with France; I couldn't stand it. In fact, I\\n\\nshould certainly have got myself arrested; so off I went, with two or\\n\\nthree dashing fellows,--Selves, Besson, and others, who are now in\\n\\nEgypt,--and we entered the service of pacha Mohammed; a queer sort of\\n\\nfellow he was, too! Once a tobacco merchant in the bazaars, he is now\\n\\non the high-road to be a sovereign prince. You've all seen him in that\\n\\npicture by Horace Vernet,--'The Massacre of the Mameluks.' What a\\n\\nhandsome fellow he was! But I wouldn't give up the religion of my\\n\\nfathers and embrace Islamism; all the more because the abjuration\\n\\nrequired a surgical operation which I hadn't any fancy for. Besides,\\n\\nnobody respects a renegade. Now if they had offered me a hundred\\n\\nthousand francs a year, perhaps--and yet, no! The pacha did give me a\\n\\nthousand talari as a present.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How much is that?\\\" asked Oscar, who was listening to Georges with all\\n\\nhis ears.\\n\\n\\\"Oh! not much. A talaro is, as you might say, a five-franc piece. But\\n\\nfaith! I got no compensation for the vices I contracted in that God-\\n\\nforsaken country, if country it is. I can't live now without smoking a\\n\\nnarghile twice a-day, and that's very costly.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How did you find Egypt?\\\" asked the count.\\n\\n\\\"Egypt? Oh! Egypt is all sand,\\\" replied Georges, by no means taken\\n\\naback. \\\"There's nothing green but the valley of the Nile. Draw a green\\n\\nline down a sheet of yellow paper, and you have Egypt. But those\\n\\nEgyptians--fellahs they are called--have an immense advantage over us.\\n\\nThere are no gendarmes in that country. You may go from end to end of\\n\\nEgypt, and you won't see one.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I suppose there are a good many Egyptians,\\\" said Mistigris.\\n\\n\\\"Not as many as you think for,\\\" replied Georges. \\\"There are many more\\n\\nAbyssinians, and Giaours, and Vechabites, Bedouins, and Cophs. But all\\n\\nthat kind of animal is very uninteresting, and I was glad enough to\\n\\nembark on a Genoese polacca which was loading for the Ionian Islands\\n\\nwith gunpowder and munitions for Ali de Tebelen. You know, don't you,\\n\\nthat the British sell powder and munitions of war to all the world,--\\n\\nTurks, Greeks, and the devil, too, if the devil has money? From Zante\\n\\nwe were to skirt the coasts of Greece and tack about, on and off. Now\\n\\nit happens that my name of Georges is famous in that country. I am,\\n\\nsuch as you see me, the grandson of the famous Czerni-Georges who made\\n\\nwar upon the Porte, and, instead of crushing it, as he meant to do,\\n\\ngot crushed himself. His son took refuge in the house of the French\\n\\nconsul at Smyrna, and he afterwards died in Paris, leaving my mother\\n\\npregnant with me, his seventh child. Our property was all stolen by\\n\\nfriends of my grandfather; in fact, we were ruined. My mother, who\\n\\nlived on her diamonds, which she sold one by one, married, in 1799, my\\n\\nstep-father, Monsieur Yung, a purveyor. But my mother is dead, and I\\n\\nhave quarrelled with my step-father, who, between ourselves, is a\\n\\nblackguard; he is still alive, but I never see him. That's why, in\\n\\ndespair, left all to myself, I went off to the wars as a private in\\n\\n1. Well, to go back to the time I returned to Greece; you wouldn't\\n\\nbelieve with what joy old Ali Tebelen received the grandson of Czerni-\\n\\nGeorges. Here, of course, I call myself simply Georges. The pacha gave\\n\\nme a harem--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have had a harem?\\\" said Oscar.\\n\\n\\\"Were you a pacha with MANY tails?\\\" asked Mistigris.\\n\\n\\\"How is it that you don't know,\\\" replied Georges, \\\"that only the\\n\\nSultan makes pachas, and that my friend Tebelen (for we were as\\n\\nfriendly as Bourbons) was in rebellion against the Padishah! You know,\\n\\nor you don't know, that the true title of the Grand Seignior is\\n\\nPadishah, and not Sultan or Grand Turk. You needn't think that a harem\\n\\nis much of a thing; you might as well have a herd of goats. The women\\n\\nare horribly stupid down there; I much prefer the grisettes of the\\n\\nChaumieres at Mont-Parnasse.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They are nearer, at any rate,\\\" said the count.\\n\\n\\\"The women of the harem couldn't speak a word of French, and that\\n\\nlanguage is indispensable for talking. Ali gave me five legitimate\\n\\nwives and ten slaves; that's equivalent to having none at all at\\n\\nJanina. In the East, you must know, it is thought very bad style to\\n\\nhave wives and women. They have them, just as we have Voltaire and\\n\\nRousseau; but who ever opens his Voltaire or his Rousseau? Nobody.\\n\\nBut, for all that, the highest style is to be jealous. They sew a\\n\\nwoman up in a sack and fling her into the water on the slightest\\n\\nsuspicion,--that's according to their Code.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did you fling any in?\\\" asked the farmer.\\n\\n\\\"I, a Frenchman! for shame! I loved them.\\\"\\n\\nWhereupon Georges twirled and twisted his moustache with a dreamy air.\\n\\nThey were now entering Saint-Denis, and Pierrotin presently drew up\\n\\nbefore the door of a tavern where were sold the famous cheese-cakes of\\n\\nthat place. All the travellers got out. Puzzled by the apparent truth\\n\\nmingled with Georges' inventions, the count returned to the coucou\\n\\nwhen the others had entered the house, and looked beneath the cushion\\n\\nfor the portfolio which Pierrotin told him that enigmatical youth had\\n\\nplaced there. On it he read the words in gilt letters: \\\"Maitre\\n\\nCrottat, notary.\\\" The count at once opened it, and fearing, with some\\n\\nreason, that Pere Leger might be seized with the same curiosity, he\\n\\ntook out the deed of sale for the farm at Moulineaux, put it into his\\n\\ncoat pocket, and entered the inn to keep an eye on the travellers.\\n\\n\\\"This Georges is neither more nor less than Crottat's second clerk,\\\"\\n\\nthought he. \\\"I shall pay my compliments to his master, whose business\\n\\nit was to send me his head-clerk.\\\"\\n\\nFrom the respectful glances of Pere Leger and Oscar, Georges perceived\\n\\nthat he had made for himself two fervent admirers. Accordingly, he now\\n\\nposed as a great personage; paid for their cheese-cakes, and ordered\\n\\nfor each a glass of Alicante. He offered the same to Mistigris and his\\n\\nmaster, who refused with smiles; but the friend of Ali Tebelen\\n\\nprofited by the occasion to ask the pair their names.\\n\\n\\\"Oh! monsieur,\\\" said Mistigris' master, \\\"I am not blessed, like you,\\n\\nwith an illustrious name; and I have not returned from Asia--\\\"\\n\\nAt this moment the count, hastening into the huge inn-kitchen lest his\\n\\nabsence should excite inquiry, entered the place in time to hear the\\n\\nconclusion of the young man's speech.\\n\\n\\\"--I am only a poor painter lately returned from Rome, where I went at\\n\\nthe cost of the government, after winning the 'grand prix' five years\\n\\nago. My name is Schinner.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hey! bourgeois, may I offer you a glass of Alicante and some cheese-\\n\\ncakes?\\\" said Georges to the count.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you,\\\" replied the latter. \\\"I never leave home without taking my\\n\\ncup of coffee and cream.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't you eat anything between meals? How bourgeois, Marais, Place\\n\\nRoyale, that is!\\\" cried Georges. \\\"When he 'blagued' just now about his\\n\\ncrosses, I thought there was something in him,\\\" whispered the Eastern\\n\\nhero to the painter. \\\"However, we'll set him going on his decorations,\\n\\nthe old tallow-chandler! Come, my lad,\\\" he added, calling to Oscar,\\n\\n\\\"drink me down the glass poured out for the chandler; that will start\\n\\nyour moustache.\\\"\\n\\nOscar, anxious to play the man, swallowed the second glass of wine,\\n\\nand ate three more cheese-cakes.\\n\\n\\\"Good wine, that!\\\" said Pere Leger, smacking his lips.\\n\\n\\\"It is all the better,\\\" said Georges, \\\"because it comes from Bercy.\\n\\nI've been to Alicante myself, and I know that this wine no more\\n\\nresembles what is made there than my arm is like a windmill. Our made-\\n\\nup wines are a great deal better than the natural ones in their own\\n\\ncountry. Come, Pierrotin, take a glass! It is a great pity your horses\\n\\ncan't take one, too; we might go faster.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Forward, march!\\\" cried Pierrotin, amid a mighty cracking of whips,\\n\\nafter the travellers were again boxed up.\\n\\nIt was now eleven o'clock. The weather, which had been cloudy,\\n\\ncleared; the breeze swept off the mists, and the blue of the sky\\n\\nappeared in spots; so that when the coucou trundled along the narrow\\n\\nstrip of road from Saint-Denis to Pierrefitte, the sun had fairly\\n\\ndrunk up the last floating vapors of the diaphanous veil which swathed\\n\\nthe scenery of that famous region.\\n\\n\\\"Well, now, tell us why you left your friend the pacha,\\\" said Pere\\n\\nLeger, addressing Georges.\\n\\n\\\"He was a very singular scamp,\\\" replied Georges, with an air that hid\\n\\na multitude of mysteries. \\\"He put me in command of his cavalry,--so\\n\\nfar, so good--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah! that's why he wears spurs,\\\" thought poor Oscar.\\n\\n\\\"At that time Ali Tebelen wanted to rid himself of Chosrew pacha,\\n\\nanother queer chap! You call him, here, Chaureff; but the name is\\n\\npronounced, in Turkish, Cosserew. You must have read in the newspapers\\n\\nhow old Ali drubbed Chosrew, and soundly, too, faith! Well, if it\\n\\nhadn't been for me, Ali Tebelen himself would have bit the dust two\\n\\ndays earlier. I was at the right wing, and I saw Chosrew, an old sly-\\n\\nboots, thinking to force our centre,--ranks closed, stiff, swift, fine\\n\\nmovement a la Murat. Good! I take my time; then I charge, double-\\n\\nquick, and cut his line in two,--you understand? Ha! ha! after the\\n\\naffair was over, Ali kissed me--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do they do that in the East?\\\" asked the count, in a joking way.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, monsieur,\\\" said the painter, \\\"that's done all the world over.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"After that,\\\" continued Georges, \\\"Ali gave me yataghans, and carbines,\\n\\nand scimetars, and what-not. But when we got back to his capital he\\n\\nmade me propositions, wanted me to drown a wife, and make a slave of\\n\\nmyself,--Orientals are so queer! But I thought I'd had enough of it;\\n\\nfor, after all, you know, Ali was a rebel against the Porte. So I\\n\\nconcluded I had better get off while I could. But I'll do Monsieur\\n\\nTebelen the justice to say that he loaded me with presents,--diamonds,\\n\\nten thousand talari, one thousand gold coins, a beautiful Greek girl\\n\\nfor groom, a little Circassian for a mistress, and an Arab horse! Yes,\\n\\nAli Tebelen, pacha of Janina, is too little known; he needs an\\n\\nhistorian. It is only in the East one meets with such iron souls, who\\n\\ncan nurse a vengeance twenty years and accomplish it some fine\\n\\nmorning. He had the most magnificent white beard that was ever seen,\\n\\nand a hard, stern face--\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1637316136,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"The cross of 'ceux-ci'? No, thank you!
