"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## 9.1. Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota (the Three Domains of All Life on Earth)\\n\\nLife-forms on Earth are currently divided into three main domains. Animals and plants are in the more recent ‘eukaryotic’ domain[\\\\[1\\\\]](#_ftn1) that arose approximately 2 billion years ago. However, at the base of all life’s experiments on Earth are simple bacteria[\\\\[2\\\\]](#_ftn2) and archaea.[\\\\[3\\\\]](#_ftn3) They have both been present for over 3 billion years[\\\\[4\\\\]](#_ftn4) — since nearly the beginning of the Earth — and they have shown a propensity for survival in the harshest conditions that are possible here. Having begun in an oxygen-poor environment, they have flourished through fire and ice (see the ‘Snowball Earth’ hypothesis[\\\\[5\\\\]](#_ftn5)), apocalyptic asteroidal destruction and massive volcanic eruptions.\\n\\nIf we are to understand and praise life, we must start with these simple beginnings, where we will find the common ancestor of all life-forms on Earth.\\n\\n**“Torrential rains fell for perhaps a hundred thousand years without cease, creating hot, shallow oceans. Submerged plate boundaries, rich in chemicals and energy, steadily vented hydrogen-rich gases into the seas. Water hitting the boiling lava in rifts and volcanoes evaporated, condensed, and rained down again … The waters rounded off the mountains as they were created, washing minerals and salts into the oceans and land pools … Lightning struck. The sun continued to beam heat and ultraviolet light into the earth’s thickening atmosphere, as the fast-spinning planet spun in cycles of five-hour days and five-hour nights. The moon too had condensed from the sun’s nebula. Our faithful natural satellite … from the beginning pulled rhythmically on the great bodies of water, creating tides. It is from this Archean Aeon, from 3,900 to 2,500 million years ago, that we have found the first traces of life.”**\\n\\nLynn Margulis, *Microcosmos*, 1986 CE [\\\\[7\\\\]](#_ftn7)\\n\\n![“Yellowstone Park”, pxhere.com, public domain.

They used to be classified as a type of bacteria. They are specialists at surviving on a wide variety of energy sources, including hydrogen, metals, ammonia and sugar.\\n\\nAs extremophiles archaea can survive deep underwater, where there is no sunlight, living on toxic thermal vents and also in highly acidic lakes.[\\\\[8\\\\]](#_ftn8)\\n\\nAnimals rely upon archaea and bacteria for their digestion and archaea appear to be much more symbiotic than parasitic in their relationships with other life-forms. Like the lowly earthworm, they are a little-considered but absolutely key element to all life on Earth. They would appear to be the best adapted of all life-forms to life on other planets.\\n\\nBacteria are a crucial element for all more complex life-forms on Earth, needed for so many aspects of the food, life and death cycles. They have the ability to synthesise Vitamin B12, necessary for DNA creation, and are crucial for the synthesis of myelin, which is necessary for any animal with a nervous system. Like archaea, they play a key role in the digestive processes of all complex life-forms.\\n\\nUnlike archaea,[\\\\[9\\\\]](#_ftn9) bacteria are capable of being highly pathogenic. Many of the deadliest diseases are a product of bacterial infection, including cholera, bubonic plague, syphilis, tuberculosis, pneumonia and *Escherischia coli* infection (commonly known as ‘e. coli’). These dangerous and often deadly bacterial infections are to be distinguished from viruses, including the new coronavirus variant COVID-19 which locked down much of the planet (for humans) in 2020.\\n\\n![NIAID, “Bacteria”, National Geographic Encyclopedia, public domain: “As humans continue to use antibiotics to fight bacterial infections, bacteria are evolving to fight back, like these methicillin-resistant \\\\*Staphylococcus aureus \\\\*bacteria (yellow), which have evolved a resistance to antibiotics and are seen here fighting with a human white blood cell (red).” \\\\[10\\\\]](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\\\*xgNAmAz0fblTCRkjaiF-sg.jpeg?size=medium)\\n\\nAfter bacteria, the base layer of life-forms (and the fuel for complex multicellular eukaryotic life-forms) are found in the plant and fungal kingdoms. In addition to providing the fuel for other life-forms, these organisms also assisted bacteria in creating the current oxygen-rich biosphere so necessary for animal life. The algae ancestors of plants and fungi[\\\\[11\\\\]](#_ftn11) started to diverge from other life-forms anywhere from around 1.5 to 2.5 billion years ago. However, it was around 450–500 million years ago that both began to colonise the land in great numbers and to increase in complexity and diversity.[\\\\[12\\\\]](#_ftn12)\\n\\n## 9.2.

The oldest living non-clonal tree is ‘Methusalah’,[\\\\[19\\\\]](#_ftn19) a bristlecone pine in California estimated to be around 4,000 years old, and the oldest living clonal tree is Pando, a quaking aspen in Utah estimated to be anywhere between 14,000 and 80,000 years old.\\n\\n“Pando ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) for ‘I spread’), also known as the trembling giant, is a [clonal colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonal_colony) of an individual male [quaking aspen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populus_tremuloides) (*Populus tremuloides*) determined to be a single living organism by identical [genetic markers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker) and assumed to have one massive underground [root system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root) … Pando occupies 43.6 hectares (108 acres) and is estimated to weigh collectively 6,000,000 kilograms (6,600 short tons), making it the [heaviest known organism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_organisms). The root system of Pando is estimated to be several thousand years old, placing Pando among the [oldest known living organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest-living_organisms).”[\\\\[20\\\\]](#_ftn20)\\n\\nGrasses (Poaceae) and grassland are are estimated to have evolved anywhere from 130 to 180 million years ago. They provide approximately 50% of all the energy content for human consumption, given the prevalence of rice, wheat and maize as dietary staples (and not to forget their importance for making beer). Grasslands (including savannah and prairie) are estimated to form around 40% of all the land area of Earth.[\\\\[22\\\\]](#_ftn22)\\n\\n![“Eurasian steppe belt”, public domain (the Great Steppe is highlighted in turquoise, stretching from Bulgaria to Manchuria), 2009 CE, public domain](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\\\*3OqDFar8CuOFfnTJbiuTQA.jpeg?size=medium)\\n\\n![“Grasslands”, pxhere.com, public domain.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*IYfQ77I5NmruQjTqWqFabg.jpeg)\\n\\n**“Much later, those delicate and fragrant beings we call flowers would come to play an essential part in the evolution of consciousness of another species. Humans would increasingly be drawn to and fascinated by them. As the consciousness of human beings developed, flowers were most likely the first thing they came to value that had no utilitarian purpose for them, that is to say, was not linked in some way to survival … Flowers, more fleeting, more ethereal, and more delicate than the plants out of which they emerged, would become like messengers from another realm, like a bridge between the world of physical forms and the formless.”**\\n\\n(*Eckhart Tolle*)[\\\\[23\\\\]](#_ftn23)\\n\\nFlowering plants evolved anywhere from 250 to 130 million year ago (a relatively long time after land plants had successfully evolved).[\\\\[24\\\\]](#_ftn24) With their riotous diversity of colour and odour, flowers helped evolve parts of our — mostly green-and-blue — planet into seasonally ambrosial and kaleidoscopic landscapes, as if the artist in nature was finally given full expression to paint life with a richer palette.[\\\\[25\\\\]](#_ftn25)\\n\\n![“Honeysuckle”; pxhere.com, public domain](https://miro.medium.com/max/2666/1\\\\*A_xmqBhX294cXy8biCE6dA.jpeg)\\n\\n![\\\"Marigold\\\", pxhere.com, public domain](https://miro.medium.com/max/2992/1\\\\*httKXg8ExpKdWhVvbFZ0sw.jpeg)\\n\\n![\\\"Sunflower\\\", pxhere.com, public domain  \\\\[26\\\\]](https://miro.medium.com/max/6528/1\\\\*K11trXyzPm3MikZcsDFPLQ.jpeg)\\n\\n## 9.3. Insects\\n\\nInsects appear to be the most successful animals by number, with estimates of between 6 and 10 million different species.[\\\\[27\\\\]](#_ftn27) The evolution of wings, common to most insects and perhaps a fortunate byproduct of features used to regulate temperature (known as exaptation), made a huge difference to their success. By number, ants are particularly successful, with an estimated 10,000 trillion (1 x 1016) ants on Earth.[\\\\[28\\\\]](#_ftn28)\\n\\n**“The most plausible explanation now seems to be that protowings served to absorb heat from sunlight to help the insect maintain the higher body temperature required for a high level of physical activity. That theory was first proposed in 1978 by M. M. Douglas.”[\\\\[29\\\\]](#_ftn29)**\\n\\nInsects,[\\\\[30\\\\]](#_ftn30) plants, flowers and trees have been joined together for hundreds of millions of years in an evolutionary dance of predation and cross-pollination powered by accident and reward. The importance of insects to all other animals that rely on fruit and vegetation, including humans, cannot be overstated. We undervalue these beautiful, busy workers at our peril. As with spiders, we all too often fear insects — their forms give rise to our most vivid fantasies of terrifying human-devouring monsters. Insects also display extreme survival and progeneration techniques that challenge the most hardened naturalist.[\\\\[31\\\\]](#_ftn31)\\n\\n**“But I own that I cannot see, as plainly as others do, & as I sh’d wish to do, evidence of design & beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent & omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidæ with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars, or that a cat should play with mice. Not believing this, I see no necessity in the belief that the eye was expressly designed. On the other hand I cannot anyhow be contented to view this wonderful universe & especially the nature of man, & to conclude that everything is the result of brute force. I am inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance … I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton — Let each man hope & believe what he can.”**\\n\\n(*Charles Darwin*)[\\\\[32\\\\]](#_ftn32)\\n\\nEven if we are not frightened of them, we are also often quick to kill insects for entirely cosmetic reasons. For example, ants are rarely a genuine nuisance in our homes and yet they are killed for the audacity of seeking to clean the crumbs from below our tables.\\n\\nSome of our fear is based on sound reason; mosquitos are the deadliest animal in the world to humans,[\\\\[33\\\\]](#_ftn33) more so than other humans. However, when comparing across all species, humans soundly beat mosquitoes as the deadliest animal of all. Other animals’ deadliness is measured in the number of organisms they kill, while humans’ unparalleled threat can be measured by the number of entire species whose extinction they cause.\\n\\nInsects are so important for the health of the ecosystem, perpetuating the right conditions for all complex life-forms, including the human animal. They are also beautiful in their variety, colour and form. They are awe-inspiring in their success at survival in extreme conditions and against the odds.\\n\\n![“Praying mantis”, pxhere.com, public domain.\\\\[34\\\\]](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k4F49vcR7gWzPU70NkEXu.png?height=1659&width=2400&size=medium)\\n\\n![“Green dilemma orchid bee”; “Leaf beetle”; “Fire ant (worker)”; “Japanese rhinoceros beetle”; “Odanata”; “Hoverfly”, all pxhere.com, public domain.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Mdb_fAqB2wkI_HTHek_1N.png?height=1754&width=1624&size=medium)\\n\\n![JJ Harrison, “Calliphora Portrait”, Wikipedia, 2009 CE, CC BY-SA 3.0. \\\\[35\\\\]](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jA0DX79Lu81i6_11Fh4Lr.png?height=1928&width=1294)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n## 9.4.
