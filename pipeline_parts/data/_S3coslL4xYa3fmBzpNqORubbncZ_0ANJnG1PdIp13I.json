"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"This is a summary of Dr. Mortensen’s **outstanding** playlist on how to practice the piano. If you’re interested in learning how to really play the piano, I suggest checking it out (and really, anything Dr. Mortensen has to say on music making):\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXq89uljqC0&list=PLpyMjpj5yGK3k_YKRKVJU_mSZMzPh7aFf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXq89uljqC0&list=PLpyMjpj5yGK3k_YKRKVJU_mSZMzPh7aFf)\\n\\nThis post is simply a summary on the path he lays out, since I intend to apply it on my personal piano practice from now on. While Dr. Mortensen is a college professor, what I find especially appealing about his advice is that you can easily “scale it down” to more beginner stages or simple pieces. The core of it will remain the same. What is more, I find this advice transferable to almost anything you endeavour to learn.\\n\\n### The artistic vision comes first\\n\\nBefore you sit down to learn a piece at the piano, you need to know how the piece is supposed to sound. The list below lays out a natural order to achieve this.\\n\\n 1. Listen to as many recordings as you can, and steal everything.\\n 2. Listen to other music by the same composer.\\n 3. Listen to other music from the same style and time in history.\\n 4. Learn to **play the tune alone** with one hand.\\n 5. Learn to **sing the tune**.\\n 6. Sing the tune while you **accompany with block chords** (“fakebook it”).\\n 7. **Transpose the tune** to many keys.\\n 8. Study the **phrase structure** (identify how the tune decomposes into smaller bits with a clear beginning and end).\\n 9. Learn **the form** (identify how the whole piece decomposes into big parts A-B-A, A-B-A-C-A, sonata form, etc).\\n10. At every bar, **know what key and chord you’re in**.\\n11. **Conduct your piece away from the piano** (imagine you’re a conductor and there’s an orchestra full of perfect instrumentalists that can read your mind, how would you tell them to play each part?).\\n\\n### Problem solving\\n\\nOnce you have the artistic vision, it’s time to make it happen. Note most of us (especially amateurs) skip all of the above and try to get the whole down at once mechanically. We don’t even get to solve any problems because we don’t really know what we’re trying to play!\\n\\n### Go slowly\\n\\n1. Practice with metronome, the slowest you can. Aim at perfection at that speed: dynamics, nuance, expression, articulation, voicing.\\n2. Only repeat what you got perfect (kind of puzzle, isn’t it?).\\n\\n### Divide and conquer\\n\\n1. Divide the piece in playable vs. unplayable passages. Playable means that at a slow enough tempo you don’t have issues playing it. Unplayable means that no matter how slow you take it, you can’t play it.\\n2. Problem-solve the unplayable parts (more on this below).\\n3. Once all the parts are playable, put the piece together. Note this means playing it at a tempo that you can play it from beginning to end.\\n\\n### Problems of information and motion\\n\\n1. First solve information problems: you don’t know what’s going on. You don’t know the pattern. Many times things that look daunting on the score when you read them note by note, are textures that become easy to understand once you figure out what the composer is trying to achieve musically. Throw all the music theory you can at it, get the general idea.\\n2. Then solve motion problems: you understand what’s going on, but can’t get it to sound like your artistic vision. The problem to solve is “how do I **move** to play this?”\\n\\n### Beauty and comfort\\n\\nMake sure everything you do feels comfortable and beautiful to you. If a part doesn’t, it’s time to problem solve.\\n\\n### The feedback loop\\n\\n1. Listen to yourself.\\n2. Write down everything you don’t like about your interpretation.\\n3. Play what you want to hear.\\n4. Record yourself.\\n5. Have friends and family listen and give you honest feedback.\\n\\n### The 4 memories\\n\\nTo be really confident that you can play a piece, you need to combine intellectual, aural and motor memories of the piece. Each of them has strengths and weaknesses so they can’t stand alone.\\n\\n1. **Intellectual:** you analyze the piece, then you know what is going on regardless of what your hands are doing.\\n2. **Aural:** you can listen to the piece in your mind.\\n3. **Motor:** your muscles execute the right movements subconsciously.\\n4. **Visual:** you remember how the score and/or your hands look at every point of the performance.\",\"timestamp\":1640110242,\"title\":\"Notes on Dr. Mortensen's \\\"How to practice\\\" the piano\"},\"digest\":\"VCdGeB3FYFWj7PaQLEsqhuoAQ5E44GYofmifG_j0tMY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x89D94DA1c6a8564f66e414A8C1C323F96c685006\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7kQjisskDwF4H3f5I_cAISu12CZAezMQDOgzRWgiYg0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FaVbvn5ZFWvrLhwE_xbJtFi_YGmhvEukh9DOxSVfo4o\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"R5vEkE_5x1tAGWKgGp-bk58u1dX6yvq3QUT-fFo3C6xThstfqYQ8vSSJXBPorXDF3sNHJiJBEAkik-9lmbM6kg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xec90077aee3ebf126f784506d469b7734517be20944586638734b5f1ccf7ee4b6f573483ff10b4df74056fae01dd0583b14dd9e05069186dcf51296b862714c81b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7kQjisskDwF4H3f5I_cAISu12CZAezMQDOgzRWgiYg0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FaVbvn5ZFWvrLhwE_xbJtFi_YGmhvEukh9DOxSVfo4o\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"sfaDJA15IUXvqlg8GxUrtfnMzsw5tvtquORODrvG4sA\"}"
