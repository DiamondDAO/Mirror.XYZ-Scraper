We‚Äôll miss the paperclip punk but are excited to welcome @jgcfyi to PaperclipDAO! üñá**\\n\\nMitchell Chan's Digital Zone of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility (IKB) is a 2017 NFT project that would be mindblowing even if it was released today. It can be thought of as a digital homage to a famous conceptual artwork by Yves Klein. Homage is artistic tradition---[Van Gogh‚Äôs beloved tributes to Hiroshige‚Äôs work](https://twitter.com/michikokakutani/status/789622118455644160) were a way to honor and celebrate the connection he saw between Japanese art and Impressionism. Chan saw the striking connection between Yves Klein and NFTs and created IKB.\\n\\nIKB draws on an exhibition by Yves Klein in 1958, in which patrons paid in pure gold to view empty spaces (*Zones*) that Yves imbued with the sensibility (but not the physical appearance) of the color blue. That an artist can ‚Äúimbue‚Äù a space with their art was a radical concept in 1958, **but here in 2021‚Äôs NFT Summer we are happy to let artists imbue even a digital space with value.**\\\\[1\\\\] Digital Zones understood and predicted this in 2017 and it took the rest of us four years to get it.\\n\\n![IKB was playing with this idea before ERC-721 even existed.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b1a37edf-e6b8-41b8-8827-e327b909b51d.png?height=842&width=1058)\\n\\nIn Klein‚Äôs 1958 exhibition, a collector who wished to purchase a *Zone* had to pay in solid gold. They were then issued a paper receipt to serve as proof of transaction. Klein also designed a ritual meant to empower the purchaser to obtain the true immaterial sense of the artwork, enabling the sensibility of the artwork to become part of the owner in a spiritual sense. During this ritual, the purchaser would burn this receipt and Klein would throw half the gold into the River Seine. There are three documented instances of this ritual being performed.\\n\\nThe 101 IKBs represent a fascinating extension of Klein‚Äôs ritual on-chain (**including a smart contract function that will reproduce the effects of the ritual‚Ä¶**) across 7 series, minted starting in 2017. There‚Äôs much more to this project than we can cover here--for instance, IKB‚Äôs contract is a very early instance of a bonding curve. But you can learn more about this fascinating series by reading the [Blue Paper](https://github.com/mitchellfchan/IKB/blob/master/Digital-Zones-Of-Immaterial-Pictorial-Sensibility-Blue-Paper.pdf) or watching this [short video series](https://editorial.superrare.com/2021/03/10/63-years-ago-a-non-fungible-token-was-an-art-world-sensation-4-years-ago-it-went-on-chain/).\\n\\n![The color of the each IKB wrapper (right) uniquely corresponds to a color on the horizon along the north coast of Prince Edward Island, three hours before civil twilight.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1164708a-346e-41f0-9c7c-d5972d475075.png?height=740&width=1473)\\n\\nNeedless to say, we were floored to receive an offer for an IKB, a historic NFT and trade for Paperclip.\\n\\n### The ones that got away: Round 3 Edition\\n\\nWe received many other notable offers, and as in previous rounds, we were sad to part with all the NFTs that we couldn‚Äôt accept.
