"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Hello person. Welcome to Season 1.\\n\\nI’m Yung.Raj & I make beats of various styles & genres.\\n\\nEver since my debut EP ‘Laced Loops’ back in 2018, I’ve been wondering how to go about making an LP (full length album) of all original music. Through a series of various events, I find myself in the middle of it already.\\n\\nI’ve been heavily inspired by legends like J Dilla, Madlib, Knxwledge (to name a few) because of the fearless & prolific attitude they carry with their beats.\\n\\nOver the last 4 years, I’ve released over 170+ beats/trax/songs\\n\\n***Think of these beats as timestamps, one for each day, I feel that songs/jams/beats/trax whatever you wanna call them, are timestamps of reality in the sense that they represent to the artist how they were feeling at the time and where they were***\\n\\nIt seems as if they were all part of my training to reach this day!\\n\\nIt all began on Jan 1, 2022 when I found myself sitting in my studio with a fractured elbow (my dominant hand to make things worse) but when I tried creating a piece on Ableton, my right hand came in clutch & I ended up with something I felt comfortable sharing, creating a Timestamp in the process. Making lots of beats is not something that’s new to me & I decided I’m not gonna let my injury get in the way of what I want to do. Jan 15th marked the end of Side A, Side B starts today (Jan 16) and will contain tracks from last year that were Catalog-only releases until today.\\n\\n[https://beta.catalog.works/spaces/5d0fa7bc-659c-4814-97f5-49dc9d8c13b7](https://beta.catalog.works/spaces/5d0fa7bc-659c-4814-97f5-49dc9d8c13b7)\\n\\nSeason 1 (January 2022) is gonna have 26 timestamps in total.\\n\\nAll the minting costs gas & all the media requires data storage & backup. If you can afford to chuck a little something to help cover the above costs it would be highly appreciated. In return for the support (by collecting the edition below) you get :\\n\\n* Free Downloads to HQ .wavs from my self-released discography\\n* Bonus Artwork Airdrops soon after Season 1 ends\\n* Access to collectors-only discord with the aforementioned airdrop\\n\\n**TL;DR**\\n\\n**We’re in the middle of my first full length album & it’s being shared with you everyday, song after song until we reach the end (Jan 26, 2022)**\\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n*If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading!
