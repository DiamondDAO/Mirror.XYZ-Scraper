"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"Am I to understand that you wish your child to leave your roof during this inclement weather in her present delicate condition?\\\" \\\"Are you in a delicate condition?\\\" asked Sir Thomas. To this Mr Traffick could condescend to make no reply. \\\"Because, if not, you, at any rate, had better go -- unless you find the weather too inclement.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course I shall go,\\\" said Mr Traffick. \\\"No consideration on earth shall induce me to eat another meal under your roof until you have thought good to have expressed regret for what you have said.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then it is very long before I shall have to give you another meal.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And now what shall I say to Captain Batsby?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tell him from me,\\\" said Sir Thomas, \\\"that he cannot possibly set about his work more injudiciously than by making you his ambassador.\\\" Then Mr Traffick took his departure.\\n\\nIt may be as well to state here that Mr Traffick kept his threat religiously -- at any rate, to the end of the Session. He did not eat another meal during that period under his father-in-law's roof. But he slept there for the next two or three days until he had suited himself with lodgings in the neighbourhood of the House. In doing this, however, he contrived to get in and out without encountering Sir Thomas. His wife in her delicate condition -- and because of the inclemency of the weather -- awaited the occurrence at Queen's Gate.\\n\\nCHAPTER 59 TREGOTHNAN\\n\\nThe writer, in giving a correct chronicle of the doings of the Tringle family at this time, has to acknowledge that Gertrude, during the prolonged absence of Captain Batsby at Brussels -- an absence that was cruelly prolonged for more than a week -- did make another little effort in another direction. Her father, in his rough way, had expressed an opinion that she had changed very much for the worse in transferring her affections from Mr Houston to Captain Batsby, and had almost gone so far as to declare that had she been persistent with her Houston the money difficulty might have been overcome. This was imprudent -- unless, indeed, he was desirous of bringing back Mr Houston into the bosom of the Tringles. It instigated Gertrude to another attempt -- which, however, she did not make till Captain Batsby had been away from her for at least four days without writing a letter. Then it occurred to her that if she had a preference it certainly was for Frank Houston. No doubt the general desirability of marriage was her chief actuating motive. Will the world of British young ladies be much scandalised if I say that such is often an actuating motive? They would be justly scandalised if I pretended that many of its members were capable of the speedy transitions which Miss Tringle was strong enough to endure; but transitions do take place, and I claim, on behalf of my young lady, that she should be regarded as more strong-minded and more determined than the general crowd of young ladies. She had thought herself to be off with the old love before she was on with the new. Then the \\\"new\\\" had gone away to Brussels -- or heaven only knows where -- and there seemed to be an opportunity of renewing matters with the \\\"old\\\". Having perceived the desirability of matrimony, she simply carried out her purpose with a determined will. It was with a determined will, but perhaps with deficient judgment, that she had written as follows:\\n\\n\\\"Papa has altered his mind altogether. He speaks of you in the highest terms, and says that had you persevered he would have yielded about the money. Do try him again. When hearts have been united it is terrible that they should be dragged asunder.\\\" Mr Traffick had been quite right in telling his father-in-law that \\\"the thing had been talked about everywhere.\\\" The thing talked about had been Gertrude's elopement. The daughter of a baronet and a millionaire cannot go off with the half-brother of another baronet and escape that penalty. The journey to Ostend was in everybody's mouth, and had surprised Frank Houston the more because of the recent termination of his own little affair with the lady. That he should already have re-accommodated himself with Imogene was intelligible to him, and seemed to admit of valid excuse before any jury of matrons. It was an old affair, and the love -- real, true love -- was already existing. He, at any rate, was going back to the better course -- as the jury of matrons would have admitted. But Gertrude's new affair had had to be arranged from the beginning, and shocked him by its celerity. \\\"Already!\\\" he had said to himself -- \\\"gone off with another man already?\\\" He felt himself to have been wounded in a tender part, and was conscious of a feeling that he should like to injure the successful lover -- blackball him at a club, or do him some other mortal mischief. When, therefore, he received from the young lady the little billet above given, he was much surprised. Could it be a hoax? It was certainly the young lady's handwriting. Was he to be enticed once again into Lombard Street, in order that the clerks might set upon him in a body and maltreat him? Was he to be decoyed into Queen's Gate, and made a sacrifice of by the united force of the housemaids? Not understanding the celerity of the young lady, he could hardly believe the billet. When he received the note of which we have here spoken two months had elapsed since he had seen Imogene and had declared to her his intention of facing the difficulties of matrimony in conjunction with herself as soon as she would be ready to undergo the ceremony with him. The reader will remember that her brother, Mudbury Docimer, had written to him with great severity, abusing both him and Imogene for the folly of their intention. And Houston, as he thought of their intention, thought to himself that perhaps they were foolish. The poverty, and the cradles, and the cabbages, were in themselves evils.\\n\\nBut still he encouraged himself to think that there might be an evil worse even than folly. After that scene with Imogene, in which she had offered to sacrifice herself altogether, and to be bound to him, even though they should never be married, on condition that he should take to himself no other wife, he had quite resolved that it behoved him not to be exceeded by her in generosity. He had stoutly repudiated her offer, which he had called a damnable compact. And then there had been a delightful scene between them, in which it had been agreed that they should face the cradles and the cabbages with bold faces. Since that he had never allowed himself to fluctuate in his purpose. Had Sir Thomas come to him with Gertrude in one hand and the much-desired L#120,000 in the other, he would have repudiated the lot of them. He declared to himself with stern resolution that he had altogether washed his hands from dirt of that kind. Cabbages and cradles for ever was the unpronounced cry of triumph with which he buoyed up his courage. He set himself to work earnestly, if not altogether steadfastly, to alter the whole tenor of his life. The champagne and the woodcocks -- or whatever might be the special delicacies of the season -- he did avoid. For some few days he absolutely dined upon a cut of mutton at an eating-house, and as he came forth from the unsavoury doors of the establishment regarded himself as a hero. Cabbages and cradles for ever! he would say to himself, as he went away to drink a cup of tea with an old maiden aunt, who was no less surprised than gratified by his new virtue. Therefore, when it had at last absolutely come home to him that the last little note had in truth been written by Gertrude with no object of revenge, but with the intention of once more alluring him into the wealth of Lombard Street, he simply put it into his breastcoat-pocket, and left it there unanswered. Mudbury Docimer did not satisfy himself with writing the very uncourteous letter which the reader has seen, but proceeded to do his utmost to prevent the threatened marriage. \\\"She is old enough to look after herself,\\\" he had said, as though all her future actions must be governed by her own will. But within ten days of the writing of that letter he had found it expedient to go down into the country, and to take his sister with him. As the head of the Docimer family he possessed a small country house almost in the extremity of Cornwall; and thither he went. It was a fraternal effort made altogether on his sister's behalf, and was so far successful that Imogene was obliged to accompany him. It was all very well for her to feel that as she was of age she could do as she pleased. But a young lady is constrained by the exigencies of society to live with somebody. She cannot take a lodging by herself, as her brother may do. Therefore, when Mudbury Docimer went down to Cornwall, Imogene was obliged to accompany him.\\n\\n\\\"Is this intended for banishment?\\\" she said to him when they had been about a week in the country.\\n\\n\\\"What do you call banishment? You used to like the country in the spring.\\\" It was now the middle of April.\\n\\n\\\"So I do, and in summer also. But I like nothing under constraint.\\\" \\\"I am sorry that circumstances should make it imperative upon me to remain here just at present.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why cannot you tell the truth, Mudbury?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have I told you any falsehood?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why do you not say outright that I have been brought down here to be out of Frank Houston's way?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because Frank Houston is a name which I do not wish to mention to you again -- at any rate for some time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What would you do it he were to show himself here?\\\" she asked. \\\"Tell him at once that he was not welcome. In other words, I would not have him here. It is very improbable I should think that he would come without a direct invitation from me. That invitation he will never have until I feel satisfied that you and he have changed your mind again, and that you mean to stick to it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do not think we shall do that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then he shall not come down here; nor, as far as I am able to arrange it, shall you go up to London.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then I am a prisoner?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You may put it as you please,\\\" said her brother. \\\"I have no power of detaining you. Whatever influence I have I think it right to use. I am altogether opposed to this marriage, believing it to be an absurd infatuation. I think that he is of the same opinion.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No!\\\" said she, indignantly.\\n\\n\\\"That I believe to be his feeling,\\\" he continued, taking no notice of her assertion. \\\"He is as perfectly aware as I am that you two are not adapted to live happily together on an income of a few hundreds a year. Some time ago it was agreed between you that it was so. You both were quite of one mind, and I was given to understand that the engagement was at an end. It was so much at an end that he made an arrangement for marrying another woman. But your feelings are stronger than his, and you allowed them to get the better of you. Then you enticed him back from the purpose on which you had both decided.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Enticed!\\\" said she. \\\"I did nothing of the kind!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Would he have changed his mind if you had not enticed him?\\\" \\\"I did nothing of the kind. I offered to remain just as we are.\\\" \\\"That is all very well. Of course he could not accept such an offer. Thinking as I do, it is my duty to keep you apart as long as I can. If you contrive to marry him in opposition to my efforts, the misery of both of you must be on your head. I tell you fairly that I do not believe he wishes anything of the kind.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am quite sure he does,\\\" said Imogene.\\n\\n\\\"Very well. Do you leave him alone; stay down here, and see what will come of it. I quite agree that such a banishment, as you call it, is not a happy prospect for you -- but it is happier than that of a marriage with Frank Houston. Give that up, and then you can go back to London and begin the world again.\\\"\\n\\nBegin the world again! She knew what that meant. She was to throw herself into the market, and look for such other husband as Providence might send her. She had tried that before, and had convinced herself that Providence could never send her any that could be acceptable. The one man had taken possession of her, and there never could be a second. She had not known her own strength -- or her own weakness as the case might be -- when she had agreed to surrender the man she loved because there had been an alteration in their prospects of an income. She had struggled with herself, had attempted to amuse herself with the world, had told herself that somebody would come who would banish that image from her thoughts and heart. She had bade herself to submit to the separation for his welfare. Then she had endeavoured to quiet herself by declaring to herself that the man was no hero -- was unworthy of so much thinking. But it had all been of no avail. Gertrude Tringle had been a festering sore to her. Frank, whether a hero or only a commonplace man, was -- as she owned to herself -- hero enough for her. Then came the opening for a renewal of the engagement. Frank had been candid with her, and had told her everything. The Tringle money would not be forthcoming on his behalf. Then -- not resolving to entice him back again -- she had done so. The word was odious to her, and was rejected with disdain when used against her by her brother -- but, when alone, she acknowledged to herself that it was true. She had enticed her lover back again -- to his great detriment. Yes; she certainly had enticed him back. She certainly was about to sacrifice him because of her love. \\\"If I could only die, and there be an end of it!\\\" she exclaimed to herself.\\n\\nThough Tregothnan Hall, as the Docimers' house was called, was not open to Frank Houston, there was the post running always. He had written to her half a dozen times since she had been in Cornwall, and had always spoken of their engagement as an affair at last irrevocably fixed. She, too, had written little notes, tender and loving, but still tinged by that tone of despondency which had become common to her. \\\"As for naming a day,\\\" she said once, \\\"suppose we fix the first of January, ten years hence. Mudbury's opposition will be worn out by old age, and you will have become thoroughly sick of the pleasures of London.\\\" But joined to this there would be a few jokes and then some little word of warmest, most enduring, most trusting love. \\\"Don't believe me if I say that I am not happy in knowing that I am altogether your own.\\\" Then there would come a simple \\\"I\\\" as a signature, and after that some further badinage respecting her \\\"Cerberus\\\", as she called her brother.\\n\\nBut after that word, that odious word, \\\"enticed,\\\" there went another letter up to London of altogether another nature.\\n\\nI have changed my mind again \\\\[she said\\\\] and have become aware that, though I should die in doing it -- though we should both die if it were possible -- there should be an end of everything between you and me. Yes, Frank; there! I send you back your troth, and demand my own in return. After all why should not one die -- hang oneself if it be necessary? To be self-denying is all that is necessary -- at any rate to a woman. Hanging or lying down and dying, or lingering on and saying one's prayers and knitting stockings, is altogether immaterial. I have sometimes thought Mudbury to be brutal to me, but I have never known him to be untrue -- or even, as I believe, mistaken. He sees clearly and knows what will happen. He tells me that I have enticed you back. I am not true as he is. So I threw him back the word in his teeth -- though its truth at the moment was going like a dagger through my heart. I know myself to have been selfish, unfeeling, unfeminine, when I induced you to surrender yourself to a mode of life which will make you miserable. I have sometimes been proud of myself because I have loved you so truly; but now I hate myself and despise myself because I have been incapable of the first effort which love should make. Love should at any rate be unselfish.\\n\\nHe tells me that you will be miserable and that the misery will be on my head -- and I believe him. There shall be an end of it. I want no promise from you. There may, perhaps, be a time in which Imogene Docimer as a sturdy old maid shall be respected and serene of mind. As a wife who had enticed her husband to his misery she would be respected neither by him nor by herself -- and as for serenity it would be quite out of the question. I have been unfortunate. That is all -- but not half so unfortunate as others that I see around me.\\n\\nPray, pray, PRAY, take this as final, and thus save me from renewed trouble and renewed agony.\\n\\nNow I am yours truly, never again will I be affectionate to anyone with true feminine love,\\n\\nIMOGENE DOCIMER\\n\\nHouston when he received the above letter of course had no alternative but to declare that it could not possibly be regarded as having any avail. And indeed he had heart enough in his bosom to be warmed to something like true heat by such words as these. The cabbages and cradles ran up in his estimation. The small house at Pau, which in some of his more despondent moments had assumed an unqualified appearance of domestic discomfort, was now ornamented and accoutred till it seemed to be a little paradise. The very cabbages blossomed into roses, and the little babies in the cradles produced a throb of paternal triumph in his heart. If she were woman enough to propose to herself such an agony of devotion, could he not be man enough to demand from her a devotion of a different kind? As to Mudbury Docimer's truth, he believed in it not at all, but was quite convinced of the man's brutality. Yes; she should hang herself -- but it should be round his neck. The serenity should be displayed by her not as an aunt but as a wife and mother. As for enticing, did he not now -- just in this moment of his manly triumph -- acknowledge to himself that she had enticed him to his happiness, to his glory, to his welfare? In this frame of mind he wrote his answer as follows:\\n\\nMY DEAREST,\\n\\nYou have no power of changing your mind again. There must be some limit to vacillations, and that has been reached. Something must be fixed at last. Something has been fixed at last, and I most certainly shall not consent to any further unfixing. What right has Mudbury to pretend to know my feelings? or, for the matter of that, what right have you to accept his description of them? I tell you now that I place my entire happiness in the hope of making you my wife. I call upon you to ignore all the selfish declarations as to my own ideas which I have made in times past. The only right which you could now possibly have to separate yourself from me would come from your having ceased to love me. You do not pretend to say that such is the case; and therefore, with considerable indignation, but still very civilly, I desire that Mudbury with his hardhearted counsels may go to the  --\\n\\nEnticed! Of course you have enticed me. I suppose that women do as a rule entice men, either to their advantage or disadvantage. I will leave it to you to say whether you believe that such enticement, if it be allowed its full scope, will lead to one or the other as far as I am concerned. I never was so happy as when I felt that you had enticed me back to the hopes of former days.\\n\\nNow I am yours, as always, and most affectionately,\\n\\nFRANK HOUSTON\\n\\n\\\"I shall expect the same word back from you by return of post scored under as eagerly as those futile 'prays'.\\\"\\n\\nImogene when she received this was greatly disturbed -- not knowing how to carry herself in her great resolve -- or whether indeed that resolve must not be again abandoned. She had determined, should her lover's answer be as she had certainly intended it to be when she wrote her letter, to go at once to her brother and to declare to him that the danger was at an end, and that he might return to London without any fear of a relapse on her part. But she could not do so with such a reply as that she now held in her pocket. If that reply could, in very truth, be true, then there must be another revulsion, another change of purpose, another yielding to absolute joy. If it could be the case that Frank Houston no longer feared the dangers that he had feared before, if he had in truth reconciled himself to a state of things which he had once described as simple poverty, if he really placed his happiness on the continuation of his love, then -- then, why should she make the sacrifice? Why should she place such implicit confidence in her brother's infallibility against error, seeing that by doing so she would certainly shipwreck her own happiness -- and his too, if his words were to be trusted?\\n\\nHe called upon her to write to him again by return of post. She was to write to him and unsay those prayers, and comfort him with a repetition of that dear word which she had declared that she would never use again with all its true meaning. That was his express order to her. Should she obey it, or should she not obey it? Should she vacillate again, or should she leave his last letter unanswered with stern obduracy? She acknowledged to herself that it was a dear letter, deserving the best treatment at her hands, giving her lover credit, probably, for more true honesty than he deserved. What was the best treatment? Her brother had plainly shown his conviction that the best treatment would be to leave him without meddling with him any further. Her sister-in-law, though milder in her language, was, she feared, of the same opinion. Would it not be better for him not to be meddled with? Ought not that to be her judgment, looking at the matter all round? She did not at any rate obey him at all points, for she left his letter in her pocket for three or four days, while she considered the matter backwards and forwards.\\n\\nCHAPTER 60 AUNT ROSINA\\n\\nDuring this period of heroism it had been necessary to Houston to have some confidential friend to whom from time to time he could speak of his purpose. He could not go on eating slices of boiled mutton at eating-houses, and drinking driblets of bad wine out of little decanters no bigger than the bottles in a cruet stand, without having someone to encourage him in his efforts. It was a hard apprenticeship, and, coming as it did rather late in life for such a beginning, and after much luxurious indulgence, required some sympathy and consolation. There were Tom Shuttlecock and Lord John Battledore at the club. Lord John was the man as to whose expulsion because of his contumacious language so much had been said, but who lived through that and various other dangers. These had been his special friends, and to them he had confided everything in regard to the Tringle marriage.\\n\\nShuttlecock had ridiculed the very idea of love, and had told him that everything else was to be thrown to the dogs in pursuit of a good income. Battledore had reminded him that there was \\\"a deuced deal of cut-and-come-again in a hundred and twenty thousand pounds.\\\" They had been friends, not always altogether after his own heart, but friends who had served his purpose when he was making his raid upon Lombard Street. But they were not men to whom he could descant on the wholesomeness of cabbages as an article of daily food, or who would sympathise with the struggling joys of an embryo father. To their thinking, women were occasionally very convenient as being the depositaries of some of the accruing wealth of the world. Frank had been quite worthy of their friendship as having \\\"spotted\\\" and nearly \\\"run down\\\" for himself a well-laden city heiress. But now Tom Shuttlecock and Lord John Battledore were distasteful to him -- as would he be to them. But he found the confidential friend in his maiden aunt.\\n\\nMiss Houston was an old lady -- older than her time, as are some people -- who lived alone in a small house in Green Street. She was particular in calling it Green Street, Hyde Park. She was very anxious to have it known that she never occupied it during the months of August, September, and October -- though it was often the case with her that she did not in truth expatriate herself for more than six weeks. She was careful to have a fashionable seat in a fashionable church. She dearly loved to see her name in the papers when she was happy enough to be invited to a house whose entertainments were chronicled. There were a thousand little tricks -- I will not be harsh enough to call them unworthy -- by which she served Mammon. But she did not limit her service to the evil spirit. When in her place in church she sincerely said her prayers. When in London, or out of it, she gave a modicum of her slender income to the poor. And, though she liked to see her name in the papers as one of the fashionable world, she was a great deal too proud of the blood of the Houstons to toady anyone or to ask for any favour. She was a neat, clean, nice-looking old lady, who understood that if economies were to be made in eating and drinking they should be effected at her own table and not at that of the servants who waited upon her. This was the confidential friend whom Frank trusted in his new career. It must be explained that Aunt Rosina, as Miss Houston was called, had been well acquainted with her nephew's earlier engagement, and had approved of Imogene as his future wife. Then had come the unexpected collapse in the uncle's affairs, by which Aunt Rosina as well as others in the family had suffered -- and Frank, much to his aunt's displeasure, had allowed himself to be separated from the lady of his love on account of his comparative poverty. She had heard of Gertrude Tringle and all her money, but from a high standing of birth and social belongings had despised all the Tringles and all their money. To her, as a maiden lady, truth in love was everything. To her, as a well-born lady, good blood was everything. Therefore, though there had been no quarrel between her and Frank, there had been a cessation of sympathetic interest, and he had been thrown into the hands of the Battledores and Shuttlecocks. Now again the old sympathies were revived, and Frank found it convenient to drink tea with his aunt when other engagements allowed it.\\n\\n\\\"I call that an infernal interference,\\\" he said to his aunt, showing her Imogene's letters.\\n\\n\\\"My dear Frank, you need not curse and swear,\\\" said the old lady. \\\"Infernal is not cursing nor yet swearing.\\\" Then Miss Houston, having liberated her mind by her remonstrance, proceeded to read the letter. \\\"I call that abominable,\\\" said Frank, alluding of course to the allusions made in the letter to Mudbury Docimer. \\\"It is a beautiful letter -- just what I should have expected from Imogene. My dear, I will tell you what I propose. Remain as you are both of you for five years.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Five years. That's sheer nonsense.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Five years, my dear, will run by like a dream. Five years to look back upon is as nothing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But these five years are five years to be looked forward to. It is out of the question.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you say that you could not live as a married man.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Live! I suppose we could live.\\\" Then he thought of the cabbages and the cottage at Pau. \\\"There would be seven hundred a year, I suppose.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Couldn't you do something, Frank?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What, to earn money? No; I don't think I could. If I attempted to break stones I shouldn't break enough to pay for the hammers.\\\" \\\"Couldn't you write a book?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That would be worse than the stones. I sometimes thought I could paint a picture -- but, if I did, nobody would buy it. As to making money that is hopeless. I could save some, by leaving off gloves and allowing myself only three clean shirts a-week.\\\" \\\"That would be dreadful, Frank.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It would be dreadful, but it is quite clear that I must do something. An effort has to be made.\\\" This he said with a voice the tone of which was almost heroic. Then they discussed the matter at great length, in doing which Aunt Rosina thoroughly encouraged him in his heroism. That idea of remaining unmarried for another short period of five years was allowed to go by the board, and when they parted on that night it was understood that steps were to be taken to bring about a marriage as speedily as possible. \\\"Perhaps I can do a little to help,\\\" said Aunt Bosina, in a faint whisper as Frank left the room.\\n\\nFrank Houston, when he showed Imogene's letter to his aunt, had already answered it. Then he waited a day or two, not very patiently, for a further rejoinder from Imogene -- in which she of course was to unsay all that she had said before. But when, after four or five days, no rejoinder had come, and his fervour had been increased by his expectation, then he told his aunt that he should immediately take some serious step. The more ardent he was the better his aunt loved him. Could he have gone down and carried off his bride, and married her at once, in total disregard of the usual wedding cake and St George's, Hanover Square ceremonies to which the Houston family had always been accustomed, she could have found it in her heart to forgive him. \\\"Do not be rash, Frank,\\\" she said. He merely shook his head, and as he again left her declared that he was not going to be driven this way or that by such a fellow as Mudbury Docimer.\\n\\n\\\"As I live, there's Frank coming through the gate.\\\" This was said by Imogene to her sister-in-law, as they were walking up and down the road which led from the lodge to the Tregothnan house. The two ladies were at that moment discussing Imogene's affairs. No rejoinder had as yet been made to Frank's last letter, which, to Imogene's feeling, was the most charming epistle which had ever come from the hands of a true lover. There had been passion and sincerity in every word of it -- even when he had been a little too strong in his language as he denounced the hardhearted counsels of her brother. But yet she had not responded to all this sincerity, nor had she as yet withdrawn the resolution which she had herself declared. Mrs Docimer was of opinion that that resolution should not be withdrawn, and had striven to explain that the circumstances were now the same as when, after full consideration, they had determined that the engagement should come to an end. At this very moment she was speaking words of wisdom to this effect and as she did so Frank appeared, walking up from the gate.\\n\\n\\\"What will Mudbury say?\\\" was Mrs Docimer's first ejaculation. But Imogene, before she had considered how this danger might be encountered, rushed forward and gave herself up -- I fear we must confess -- into the arms of her lover. After that it was felt at once that she had withdrawn all her last resolution and had vacillated again. There was no ground left even for an argument now that she had submitted herself to be embraced. Frank's words of affection need not here be repeated, but they were of a nature to leave no doubt on the minds of either of the ladies. Mudbury had declared that he would not receive Houston in his house as his sister's lover, and had expressed his opinion that even Houston would not have the face to show his face there. But Houston had come, and something must be done with him. It was soon ascertained that he had walked over from Penzance, which was but two miles off, and had left his portmanteau behind him. \\\"I wouldn't bring anything,\\\" said he. \\\"Mudbury would find it easier to maltreat my things than myself. It would look so foolish to tell the man with a fly to carry them back at once. Is he in the house?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is about the place,\\\" said Mrs Docimer, almost trembling. \\\"Is he very fierce against me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He thinks it had better be all over.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am of a different way of thinking, you see. I cannot acknowledge that he has any right to dictate to Imogene.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nor can I,\\\" said Imogene.\\n\\n\\\"Of course he can turn me out.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If he does I shall go with you,\\\" said Imogene.\\n\\n\\\"We have made up our minds to it,\\\" said Frank, \\\"and he had better let us do as we please. He can make himself disagreeable, of course; but he has got no power to prevent us.\\\" Now they had reached the house, and Frank was of course allowed to enter. Had he not entered neither would Imogene, who was so much taken by this further instance of her lover's ardour that she was determined now to be led by him in everything. His explanation of that word \\\"enticed\\\" had been so thoroughly satisfactory to her that she was no longer in the least angry with herself because she had enticed him. She had quite come to see that it is the duty of a young woman to entice a young man.\\n\\nFrank and Imogene were soon left alone, not from any kindness of feeling on the part of Mrs Docimer, but because the wife felt it necessary to find her husband. \\\"Oh, Mudbury, who do you think has come? He is here!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Houston?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes; Frank Houston!,\\n\\n\\\"In the house?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is in the house. But he hasn't brought anything. He doesn't mean to stay.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What does that matter? He shall not be asked even to dine here.\\\" \\\"If he is turned out she will go with him! If she says so she will do it. You cannot prevent her. That's what would come of it if she were to insist on going up to London with him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is a scoundrel!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, Mudbury -- not a scoundrel. You cannot call him a scoundrel. There is something firm about him isn't there?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To come to my house when I told him not?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But he does really love her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Bother!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"At any rate there they are in the breakfast-parlour, and something must be done. I couldn't tell him not to come in. And she wouldn't have come without him. There will be enough for them to live upon. Don't you think you'd better?\\\" Docimer, as he returned to the house, declared that he \\\"did not think he'd better\\\". But he had to confess to himself that, whether it were better or whether it were worse, he could do very little to prevent it. The greeting of the two men was anything but pleasant. \\\"What I have got to say I would rather say outside,\\\" said Docimer. \\\"Certainly,\\\" said Frank. \\\"I suppose I'm to be allowed to return?\\\" \\\"If he does not,\\\" -- said Imogene, who at her brother's request had left the room, but still stood at the open door -- \\\"if he does not I shall go to him in Penzance. You will hardly attempt to keep me a prisoner.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who says that he is not to return? I think that you are two idiots, but I am quite aware that I cannot prevent you from being married if you are both determined.\\\" Then he led the way out through the hall, and Frank followed him. \\\"I cannot understand that any man should be so fickle,\\\" he said, when they were both out on the walk together.\\n\\n\\\"Constant, I should suppose you mean.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I said fickle, and I meant it. It was at your own suggestion that you and Imogene were to be separated.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No doubt; it was at my suggestion, and with her consent. But you see that we have changed our minds.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And will change them again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We are steady enough in our purpose now, at any rate. You hear what she says. If I came down here to persuade her to alter her purpose -- to talk her into doing something of which you disapproved, and as to which she agreed with you -- then you might do something by quarrelling with me. But what's the use of it, when she and I are of one mind? You know that you cannot talk her over.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where do you mean to live?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll tell you all about that if you'll allow me to send into Penzance for my things. I cannot discuss matters with you if you proclaim yourself to be my enemy. You say we are both idiots.\\\" \\\"I do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well. Then you had better put up with two idiots. You can't cure their idiocy. Nor have you any authority to prevent them from exhibiting it.\\\" The argument was efficacious though the idiocy was acknowledged. The portmanteau was sent for, and before the evening was over Frank had again been received at Tregothnan as Imogene's accepted lover.\\n\\nThen Frank had his story to tell and his new proposition to make. Aunt Rosina had offered to join her means with his. The house in Green Street, no doubt, was small, but room it was thought could be made, at any rate till the necessity had come for various cribs and various cradles. \\\"I cannot imagine that you will endure to live with Aunt Rosina,\\\" said the brother.\\n\\n\\\"Why on earth should I object to Aunt Rosina?\\\" said Imogene. \\\"She and I have always been friends.\\\" In her present mood she would hardly have objected to live with any old woman, however objectionable. \\\"And we shall be able to have a small cottage somewhere,\\\" said Frank. \\\"She will keep the house in London, and we shall keep the cottage.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And what on earth will you do with yourself?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have thought of that too,\\\" said Frank. \\\"I shall take to painting pictures in earnest -- portraits probably. I don't see why I shouldn't do as well as anybody else.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That head of yours of old Mrs Jones\\\", said Imogene \\\"was a great deal better than dozens of things one sees every year in the Academy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Bother!\\\" exclaimed Docimer.\\n\\n\\\"I don't see why he should not succeed, if he really will work hard,\\\" said Mrs Docimer.\",\"timestamp\":1639991737,\"title\":\"\\\"Heavens and earth!\\\" ejaculated Sir Thomas. \"},\"digest\":\"bAeds25gCj1IT3xK-tG1-z1kTA988a8miMRrBQBm3Fg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x64C49f050417521e14CDAd1447c72F8234716Cd7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"w6MeX9qxrPu1BRcX6UNEjhti-0kkFpcNUCcvEYJ9tYA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ipQTLBBpXdunHnfgKpK6Rypt0z65mE3yHEHYdiT_Qmg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"D1kkqW54oxar6GsfV4mwuwiq7osRLfhJfP7E2gZlWK3L55lS1Zapdbt9gxqt_LzC3fdoO9cahesbBEpyACYXDA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9f68f25775bcc75c6ab2c514b5ee560aeb42fa02ffceebe258d19736a2772b4c68a00baa9fda1dc1a8e9185ad2b314a29db92566914c1023f19d7c65634f01d71b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"w6MeX9qxrPu1BRcX6UNEjhti-0kkFpcNUCcvEYJ9tYA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ipQTLBBpXdunHnfgKpK6Rypt0z65mE3yHEHYdiT_Qmg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"bAeds25gCj1IT3xK-tG1-z1kTA988a8miMRrBQBm3Fg\"}"
