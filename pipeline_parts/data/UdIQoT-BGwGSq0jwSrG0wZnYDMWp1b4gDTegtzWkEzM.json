"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"This image below is the Clockless Clock maze, the result of several weeks of collaborative work by maze designer Daniel Schmidt and me in 2019, and based on ideas I’d been working on since 2017. It is the anchor graphic for my *Clockless Clock* book project, and the basis for some ideas for games and virtual worlds Dan and I have been exploring since 2019. \\n\\nThe maze is fully playable, though fairly difficult to solve. The nominal goal is to complete a circuit, starting and ending at the point marked start, without falling into the void at the center. Unlike most mazes, this one has arrow markers indicating one-way paths, since it represents the one-way flow of time. If you want to try solving it on paper, you might want to print off a large-format version. Besides being playable as a maze, it is also intended as a sort of mandala, to introspect on Life, the Universe, and Everything, and as a canvas to help map out and think through difficult life challenges. Read on for more about all that.\\n\\n![Clockless Clock, by Venkatesh Rao and Daniel Schmidt, 3000 × 3262 PNG, \\\\~4.3MB](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PphjiLu-zQgHPXoyrearq.png?height=3262&width=3000)\\n\\nThe conceit of this maze is that it represents the *sturm und drang* of life itself. version of the Game of Life board game. The experience of navigating it is meant to evoke varied subjective experiences of time. The crow, rat, and goat represent objective, subjective, and eternal-cyclic aspects of time; what the Greeks called *chronos,* *kairos,* and *aion.*\\n\\nThe maze is based on a simpler diagram called the goat-crow-rat diagram I made up in 2017 to map out some philosophical ideas I’ve been exploring for several years now. The idea was to represent the fractal core of life scripts and personal evolution in terms of both inner and outer journeys. The diagram represents the journey in terms of 3 liminal passages, associated with private, public, and frontier psyches and circumstances, and symbolized by a rat, goat, and crow respectively. The core of the triangle formed by the vertices represents the void. The exterior of the triangle represents the outer world. Each edge represents a particular temporality\\n\\nIn a series of 3 articles on ribbonfarm ([Thingness and Thereness](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/06/06/thingness-and-thereness/), [Been There, Done That](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/06/27/been-there-done-that/), [Make Your Own Rules](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2018/02/15/make-your-own-rules/)) I worked out an increasingly refined and nerdy pop-metaphysics of Life, the Universe, and Everything based on the diagram. I found that I could locate almost anything I was thinking about on it, and it turned into my go-to diagramming aid for thinking about complex and messy things. \\n\\nCurrently, I’m thinking through various speculative ideas for fun ways to use maze in more complex ways, such as a board game (this would make for a more philosophical and complex adult version of the classic Game of Life board game), or a virtual world.\",\"timestamp\":1637179664,\"title\":\"The Clockless Clock Maze\"},\"digest\":\"z1e1TaSUydY8ypqVJHvrDhz8N9cN-YaFg23-o5hDgxA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2503b70933119084C26Df4C8d3E96d282de10743\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"lSZfG6i9BrAVYLkukBnRqjsMX3dO3RqSveREh5Xe8MQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"fRrf-JjZezYszuUAQVJNIoqMAV6w08ofNRL1vvGZcMA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"cn6AK3Wa4faOeJmjR3XGOCcDN4rKWD_jptDWxlbOXBSmqWeBENsuayBYVG3FdTh440mga53E8Lr01UtGbrJ9oA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x85854ac1939462ed73187cd8136381b6f2b25a0a752408ec3c15e5e10ad155277e9edc26da771302ea88dc190661d51678e0eafc3a74b7274c8e7aa60e9b21c01c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"lSZfG6i9BrAVYLkukBnRqjsMX3dO3RqSveREh5Xe8MQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"fRrf-JjZezYszuUAQVJNIoqMAV6w08ofNRL1vvGZcMA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"r27i3cvmd29FwmlEcvp6BDo_Jl6NPzdmdL2DRHjc_TE\"}"
