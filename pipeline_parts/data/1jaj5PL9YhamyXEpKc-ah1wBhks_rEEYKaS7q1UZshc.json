"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"For cells, protein degradation has many uses, including removing the N-terminal signal peptide of secreted proteins, cutting precursor proteins to produce \\\"mature\\\" proteins, and so on. Non-transmembrane proteins that are not needed or damaged by cells are generally degraded by the proteasome, while transmembrane proteins of eukaryotes are transported through endosomes to lysosomes (animal cells) or vacuoles (yeast) for degradation. \\\\[10\\\\] The amino acid molecules produced by degradation can be used to synthesize new proteins. Some proteins can undergo self-degradation. In addition, a large number of proteases (especially in lysosomes) present in cells can degrade foreign proteins, which is also a mechanism for cells to protect themselves.\\n\\nÂ \\n\\nIn biological experiments, protein degradation analysis is often performed; for example, in proteomics, specific proteins are degraded by proteases, and the degradation products are analyzed by mass spectrometry to obtain the sequence information and modification of the corresponding protein; in addition, biochemistry In experiments, Edman degradation method is often used to analyze the amino acid sequence of proteins.\",\"timestamp\":1635392062,\"title\":\"cells\"},\"digest\":\"hsUT5YpbEO7f9EamjSHq9xh4wigVokBrQA2vKUfmePI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9D87519c273dc64295230AD7D3219D611aB07F60\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MHKTC-3UOTZnhuHLKp47UaSeL0Tvi2XnoUVibp5c1KQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TY_NxNDcfnETO2lfUzceaFnmIGbUKHCDrUgRt8t7HDk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"EbVHkuEY0CCTM8ZKD-DFPlFK3JYI3XEzyeV9gpLhd68d7BpoOld3v-AsLi9_nI7MzFziHoSmMLpARUojwf3OIw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0193e3b6af3394e2e682394598c6891dbc014738ae14414c76c7e6801de86edc1d226a38cd1da839ba68540f08f05a48452ca3f5aa8467483424ed49a5a2308b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MHKTC-3UOTZnhuHLKp47UaSeL0Tvi2XnoUVibp5c1KQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TY_NxNDcfnETO2lfUzceaFnmIGbUKHCDrUgRt8t7HDk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"hsUT5YpbEO7f9EamjSHq9xh4wigVokBrQA2vKUfmePI\"}"
