"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**CT Markets Pro User: There were congestion issues with Stacks. Has that been resolved?**\\n\\n**MC:** For the most part â€” the main bottleneck that was noticed was the popularity of some NFTs and the architecture of the stacks-blockchain-API. Since then, the architecture has changed a bit, so many read-only API nodes can be brought up during higher traffic events, as we noticed in the past. The API write node is still a 1:1 ratio to a Stacks node running in follower mode since any particular blockchain node can be slightly ahead/behind other nodes at any given moment, making load balancing very difficult. In addition, an upgrade to the chain is expected to go live around December 8th that will provide a 2-10x increase in capacity. There are additional exciting future scalability and speed solutions now being [explored](https://stacks.org/scaling-stacks) that should give developers several different options as they build.\",\"timestamp\":1639127927,\"title\":\"Photo provided to China Daily\"},\"digest\":\"B3aQBR8PrIzl6fMepXc8KOe_yTvS9FJ5aAp0vzFzdsQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x1782c973a496C4AC4e21FcF154e58DD9e60Ad4aA\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zMpQ2kJf6yRYj-M2nIILSFaOyZz_Rlq1lu0UfgPOUYM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4awyX8RcJCZxN4u7QwzP2i7vz4dZyajGt9qBCo7b2lA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"nHxJPcriG2UGuJ1IRrwIr3vHMSK9D5KNujGzRKvIHoZ8z7k7iEhlj8BMu9rw3VwxrRUqooUadjQZbpSngKvkpg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4fb2e6307fec68f593c58320b387ec9eb867a24d68c70cd70e0d99814c6600dc2422c67525c16bd6d5483a015e04337aa5c7f52ba10a612426fadabd4929a2ed1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zMpQ2kJf6yRYj-M2nIILSFaOyZz_Rlq1lu0UfgPOUYM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4awyX8RcJCZxN4u7QwzP2i7vz4dZyajGt9qBCo7b2lA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"B3aQBR8PrIzl6fMepXc8KOe_yTvS9FJ5aAp0vzFzdsQ\"}"
