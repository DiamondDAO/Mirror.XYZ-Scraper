Hope you are as stoked as us for another issue of our weekly newsletter, the Concave Echo!\\n\\nThe Concave Echo is a weekly newsletter where we recap the most recent developments in Concave, while highlighting some of the amazing contributions from the community. Now without further ado, let us get started!\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n* Concave Culture Code\\n* Landing Page Alpha\\n* Concave x Redacted Event\\n* Team Interview with Wookie\\n* Miner of the Week\\n* Concave NFTs of the week\\n* Other Community Contributions\\n\\n## Concave Culture Code\\n\\nWhile the community has created many written works over the month, miners wanted to create a final document that would represent the essence of the Concave community. What started as a task for the community has become the centerpiece to show what Concave is all about. The Concave Culture Code is the culmination of all the passion and dedication that our miners have shown. It shows the expectations of the community, and the core values that every single miner should hold in their hearts. You can see this historic document right here.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*Nue890LDiNiG2IjtfLL-JA.png)\\n\\n## Landing Page Alpha\\n\\nTo celebrate the festive spirit this week, we wanted to drop some sweet alpha for the readers who take the time to reach the newsletter. For today, we have something special for you, a sneak peek into the new landing page for Concave. The team designers have been hard at work getting the landing page ready, and the result is pretty stunning. This is just the start, and we hope to have more website previews for miners in the coming weeks. You can explore the new landing page [here](https://concave.lol/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=landing_page_teaser).\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*eKeqFxEWMY3-yyGhEeUYEg.png)\\n\\n## **Concave x Redacted Gather Town Event**\\n\\nOn December 26th, Concave had a collaborative event with Redacted Cartel, an amazing project that uses Olympus Mechanics to accumulate as much Curve liquidity as possible to vote on Curve gauges. The event happened on Gather Town, where there was a live reading of the Concave Culture Code, a sick DJ session at the beach, and [Station Zero](https://twitter.com/Station0x) early access codes that you could redeem to play on Fantom. Over 200 people showed up at the event to vibe with each other and have a good time. We plan to host more events on Gather Town in the future so don’t miss out!\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*IWbDNOcPbp1SZZjV4-js5g.png)\\n\\nLive Reading of the Concave Culture Code by Jman\\n\\n## Team Interview with Wookie\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/430/1\\\\*f8HM85bcaL30yh6wPt423A.png)\\n\\nA strong community needs a strong core, and the mining core has been busy at work getting Concave to be a powerhouse in the DeFi space. We wanted to drop by and have a short interview with Wookie, one of the core miners for Concave.\\n\\n**What is your background?**\\n\\nI am on my path. I listen to both my heart and my mind. I am a man who follows his internal tuning fork and inner discernment in all things that I do, privately and professionally. Professionally I’ve done a lot of things from Emergency Medicine, to Corporate IT to Leading Soldiers. I’m an experienced Scrum Master, Release Train Engineer, Senior Enterprise Agile Coach and spent more than a decade in the Army as an Enlisted Soldier and Officer.\\n\\n**How did you learn about Concave?**\\n\\nI stumbled into a Discord conversation about it with friends, and found myself in the center of something awesome. The rest is history.\\n\\n**What are your personal hobbies?**\\n\\nI spend a lot of time in nature. The more time my bare feet can spend on the Earth, the better. I love hiking, spending time at the ocean and bonfires with friends- I spend more time staring up at luminaries in our night sky than I’d like to admit. I spend less time gaming than I used to, but I’m still a classic RPG player- I grew up on the Final Fantasy series (I mean 1–3 and of course 7). My wife and I run a small farm as our home, this is crucial in staying connected with the land. Sometimes I make my own homemade edibles with home harvested and boiled maple syrup.\\n\\n**How do you envision Concave in the future?**\\n\\nI envision Concave as a Tribe of Tribes, built around a set of protocols that will help all Tribe members gain and maintain their financial sovereignty. I look around and see a lot of people lost in or fighting the past. I see us actively manifesting the future.\\n\\n**What is a goal that you would like to achieve?**\\n\\nFostering the opening aperture of human consciousness.\\n\\n## Concave NFTs of the week\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/756/1\\\\*whS5awiN8TAzWyF5vINO-Q.gif)\\n\\nImage Credit to Rukka\\n\\nThe Concave community has created some sweet NFTs for miners this week. We had two projects release this week, Sync X Colors and the Snowcave Collection. The NFT collections are created by community members who joined together to make these projects possible. Once the collection is made, the community lets the Concave team handle the release in exchange for a portion of the funds that are sent to the Concave treasury. This collaboration signifies the core tenet of Concave, Coopetition. Here is a graphic showcase of each of these amazing projects. You can find more information on these projects [here](https://discord.com/channels/910961041003913216/918146982957170708/918147865417748530).\\n\\nSync x Colors also took the time to host an AMA article on their experiences working with Concave on this collaborative project. You can give it a read [here](https://medium.com/@syncxcolors/sync-x-colors-the-ama-4cdfcadfdcab).\\n\\nThese will be the last Concave NFT projects that are being released for the foreseeable future. We had fun bringing these NFT collections on board and hope you had fun looking at the amazing collections that our community has produced.\\n\\n## Miner of the Week\\n\\nThis week’s miner of the week is Tana! Tana has been an amazing member in the community and does a lot of work mediating for other miners, as well as helping to organize the Echo team. We wanted to learn more about Tana and talk to him about what he is working on with the Concave community.\\n\\nTana is currently working for a big pharmaceutical company as a system administrator for their Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). For this, he is doing template creation and administration as well as 1st level support for the system. With the still ongoing pandemic, Tana transitioned into 90% for working at home, which enables him to be here for Concave right when he starts his shift at 6am.\\n\\nTana has been into crypto since 2017 and tried to launch his own product with friends. With a small ETH mining farm at home, he tries to generate funds for his Degen DeFi plays, which we all love. For Tana’s hobbies, he is a huge gamer ever since he played on the Nintendo from his dad back in the 90’s, but researching and studying crypto overtook this passion almost completely. You keep on learning and collecting knowledge, and you indeed find yourself knowing that you only know so little. Other then that, he tries to be active in sports and walk his beloved dog as often as possible.\\n\\nIn regard to Concave, Tana sleeps early at 10pm, and his Concave essentials are checking back in the Mod and Operator chat right away at 6am to see if there is any crucial information being shared. After that, he takes the first gulps of his energy drink. After that, he replies back to any DMs accumulated over the night and work on all reports, tickets and bug reports.\\n\\nTana takes his work in Concave very seriously tries to resolve any issues so other Super mods and Core members can work on pushing Concave to the point where we all want it to be. Last but not least, Tana checks all channels that he is “co-moderating” (German-op, ECHO) and when he finds some free time he goes out and explore the cave even further. Currently, Tana is trying to understand the myths about poetry and mysticism and try to be available as much as possible for all of you!\\n\\n*Note: This section was adapted from Tana’s own written words.*\\n\\n## Other Community Contributions\\n\\nThe Community Contribution section is a place where we celebrate some of the amazing work of our mining community. Here are some of the brilliant projects that our community has created this past week.\\n\\n## The Wellness Center\\n\\nOur fellow miners are always looking out for each other; in the Wellness Center, you can find quality advice from miners who want to uplift other community members. One piece of good advice comes from\\\\*\\\\* \\\\*\\\\*rvtk, who wrote about what they do to keep their body strong and healthy. You can read their full response [here](https://discord.com/channels/910961041003913216/915491491277832212/924836123279237180).\\n\\n*“Sport and diet are key elements that will allow you to improve your performance at many levels. Here is how I think this can impact you.*\\n\\n*Here’s a list of things I’ve implemented/am trying to implement in my life*\\n\\n* *replace junk food with fruits and vegetables (2 cheatmeals/week)*\\n* *try to be consistent at all levels*\\n* *drink mostly water and reduce/eliminate alcohol and caffeine consumption*\\n* *eat a variety of foods and not the same thing every time*\\n* *practice moderate physical activity and get some fresh air every day (walk)*\\n* *do a sport session at least 5x a week and follow a program*\\n* *get at least 7 hours of sleep per night*\\n* *establish plans and goals”*\\n\\n## **The Arts**\\n\\nWe have some amazing artists in our community, and one channel that these miners can show off in is the The Arts. For this week, one image that really impressed us was this digital art created by JungleTrout. This image showcases the Concave logo in the depths of a dimly lit cave. The artwork looks amazing, and it reminds us of the mysterious feeling that every miner gets when they first enter the Concave.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*d6JHNugsSSzQN6UrY5-zlg.png)\\n\\n**That’s all for this week miners — we hope you enjoyed this week’s issue of the Concave Lens and look forward to bringing you the next one.**\\n\\n**WAGMI**\\n\\nMake sure to follow us on our socials!\\n\\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ConcaveFi) | [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Concavefi/) | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWbz_2ZUQoehm4llGbk9CtA) | [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/concavefi)\",\"timestamp\":1640646980,\"title\":\"Echo Concave #4 - Tygodnik Concave Finance\"},\"digest\":\"IEz7J20gyTkPd7TnikF-wg30gGWgYOtXz5CUA5I_t8A\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2C949fE13E8381E1b93CFA54f6C1F138FfBe8a36\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-VjpiEDMx-gD5OW6sPTSugYx2gZQt6W9yn87iyTNnjA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"U-pceebuI_KDSIOdWk8J_iibMHsDOgMbSfJRmqlbdaU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Zss1b6fTJafKcHoq5WNXQXq7msJC4yt3m_9DuZYAi_UUrrcrpUTDLE0S5nvTTO4PcO7UsLzGZ_dsu6AVlRTJwg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf3b7ef866bad082f3494e38ae40e5a71845e0884b4e2d96d1782a14375e0190c4ed12081f8a5d3c6e6d116451f6a7a09bd865a536a43d6c6bed6da25d884ef021c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-VjpiEDMx-gD5OW6sPTSugYx2gZQt6W9yn87iyTNnjA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"U-pceebuI_KDSIOdWk8J_iibMHsDOgMbSfJRmqlbdaU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"F8-pFYf7-YdOjjQFdKc4v2obt3IfnrS3erYE4-ltli0\"}"
