"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Hey everyone👋\\n\\nHope you all are learning new things everyday.\\n\\nToday we will try to know about our utopian vision about metaverse.\\n\\n> This is the Oasis. It's a place where the limits of reality are your own imagination. You can do anything, go anywhere. People come to The Oasis for all the things they can do, but they stay because of all the things they can be. Tall, beautiful, scary, a different sex, a different species, live-action cartoon. It’s your call.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RlMLmUraRtgJQjizMZwww.png?height=267&width=189)\\n\\nThis quote from the movie “Ready player one” excites most of us about the metaverse. It tells us that that metaverse is a place where you can be anything, do anything and no one will judge you.\\n\\nOf course it will be very exciting to climb Mt. Everest with your friends while sitting on your couch. One can visit Taj Mahal while being in Melbourne. One can visit Disney Land while being in North Korea(hope this is possible).\\n\\nThe limitation of metaverse is our imagination.\\n\\nBut\\n\\n“People come to The Oasis for all the things they can do, but they stay because of all the things **they can be**. **Tall, beautiful, scary, a different sex, a different species, live-action cartoon.”**\\n\\nWhy do we want to be someone else. Of course we all are moving towards pseudonymous society but why should we alter ourselves.\\n\\nWhy one wants to be tall? What is the definition of beautiful?\\n\\nOf course we have violence , discrimination, gender inequality and 99 other problems in real life. But should we escape from it? Should we all adapt metaverse and run away from the rea life problems instead of solving it.\\n\\nIf a person is being discriminated in real life by someone , he should fight for it rather than running away. If a person is insecure about being judged he should work on it rather than thinking that no one will judge him in the metaverse.\\n\\nIf problems exist in real life we have to solve it in real life.\\n\\nAn what is the definition of beautiful?\\n\\nDoes having a 6 ft. 2’’ height makes someone kind or having a fair skin makes someone confident? Does muscular body enhances someone’s character or having scar-free face enhances beauty?\\n\\nIn Ready Player One, a boy met a girl in the metaverse and fall in love with her digital avatar. Once they met in real life and the boy got to know that the girl had scar on her face.\\n\\n![Pin on Cinematic Details](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43f332f9-c916-4eb2-9bb7-c50765d5256c_2560x1600.jpeg)\\n\\n> But the boy still loved her. **This is Love💖with no conditions applied**.\\n\\nWe should embrace what’s real and should not fall for the trap of what’s not.\\n\\nOf course metaverse will be a lot of fun but it should not come at the expense of reality. Metaverse should be seen as an immersive online place and not as an alternate to reality.\\n\\nThank you for reading.\\n\\n[Join](https://twitter.com/alwaysbuzzboy) me on Twitter.\\n\\nPlease support me.\\n\\nMy eth address : 0xaef4842A2C6f44ed2D8C4BFf94451126D79A065E\",\"timestamp\":1642271329,\"title\":\"To whom are we lying about metaverse?\"},\"digest\":\"enXbdq72RekSUrQXjVc0Uh-v2POUSjkE-EzddJwneJ8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xaef4842A2C6f44ed2D8C4BFf94451126D79A065E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7iCk2Qf_0NXU2ZM3KFUoeGBv5CL-CNgWnFvTu2WtppU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0-WALfCP3BSw7PuJtgYkl80NnMpaA8WLmjaOPU0_kis\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"MRAhugHqutgnAHX-7NGZzjocefFnF6hUHlgww_tzWqz31J27w-2_j_9d33wdyqAqHSf0riXZ522C9zOsWBwruA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd68f95f7150f22cc4e62e2077f65c65a5e7cb4fbd48dbd62d0599be6696520c83081bdfccc7d98f8fe0ee7ce1af37c8b0d242fed051085485130d4b6359bd6761b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7iCk2Qf_0NXU2ZM3KFUoeGBv5CL-CNgWnFvTu2WtppU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0-WALfCP3BSw7PuJtgYkl80NnMpaA8WLmjaOPU0_kis\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"enXbdq72RekSUrQXjVc0Uh-v2POUSjkE-EzddJwneJ8\"}"
