The blurring of the line between \\\"core\\\" and \\\"community\\\" has occasionally led to misunderstandings over the core team's priorities versus the community's desires. Relatedly, the lack of clear expectation-setting and role definition has led to labor and compensation issues for community members. How can PT preserve all the good will it has cultivated as it scales?\\n\\n如何补偿社区？\\n\\n> A key topic of debate within PoolTogether (and the broader Web3 space) is the question of how to compensate community labor *fairly*.\\n\\n### 1: Collab.land and Coordinape: Bias, gaming and capture in tipping practices\\n\\na \\\"tipping culture in \\\\[the PoolTogether\\\\] Discord.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, there are three key inefficiencies that currently prevent [Collab.Land](http://collab.land/) and Coordinape from facilitating fair compensation: **visibility bias**, **tip gaming** and <mark>tip capture</mark>.\\n\\n#### **Visibility bias: highly visible contributors tend to be tipped better**\\n\\n不是以工作的价值，而是在社区中的可见性来获得价值。\\n\\n#### **Tip Gaming: anyone can learn to game tipping practices by spending enough time in the Discord**\\n\\nIn online communities, when \\\"rewarded activities are imperfect proxies for the behaviors that the community really wants to encourage,\\\" members may be tempted to game the rewards system by taking actions that are \\\"**rewarded but not actually valuable**\\\" (Kraut et al. 2012, p.53).\\n\\n#### **Tip Capture: early contributors tend to \\\"whale\\\" tips, while newer contributors may be compensated less**\\n\\n> Members who develop a reputation for making high-visibility contributions are more likely to be tipped, even after their activity and contributions decreases.\\n\\n### 2: PoolGrants: The perils of a 'state your terms' approach\\n\\n#### Only a limited range of projects are actually suited to funding via grants\\n\\n> Grants are appropriate compensation models for projects that are concrete, time-limited and/or once-off initiatives.\\n\\n具体、时间有限、一次性的项目；经常性的工作，可能不适合\\n\\n> \\\"I don't know if I'd ever be able to truly feel comfortable in a setting where I'm required to consistently reapply for my job.\\\"\\n\\n> This may become increasingly problematic, as these are precisely the kinds of tasks required for maintenance of a protocol and its community.\\n\\n#### Compensation through grants programs depends on the contributor's ability to demand payment\\n\\n> A further issue arises out of the way that the task of defining appropriate compensation is outsourced to community members, who may lack the knowledge and resources to fairly price their own labor.\\n\\n为自己的工作（公正）定价，也是很困难的一件事情；此外通过提案的方式 ask for money 也不是所有人习惯的事情\\n\\n> By contrast, contributors who are more comfortable with and confident in asking for (larger sums) of money are more likely to receive adequate compensation and benefit from grants programs more broadly.\\n\\n#### The necessary conditions for proactive, successful grant projects are not well understood\\n\\n> A broader challenge faced by PoolGrants programs is the difficulty of harnessing community members' sense of initiative and facilitating proactive contributions in a systematic manner.\\n\\n对 Grant 的标准和过程没有明确的理解，不知道成功的项目要有哪些特质\\n\\n> Interviewees described successful grant-funded projects as something of a black box — while the outcome was met with excitement, the underlying process was taken as solely dependent on contributors’ skillset and sense of initiative\\n\\n> This was seen in the \\\"microgrants\\\" initiative that was developed in an attempt to bridge the gap between the grants program and smaller, non-typical community member contributions.\\n> Microgrants were intended to encourage short-term, smaller contributions with a budget under $1000USD, such as promoting PoolTogether on social media channels.\\n\\n微型项目资助\\n\\n> However, as interviewees noted, microgrants did not take off within the community and failed to \\\"generate \\\\[the\\\\] creative ideas\\\" among community members that its initiators had hoped for.\\n\\n### 3: Ops Teams: A skilled labor shortage inside PoolTogether?\\n\\n#### PoolTogether doesn't (yet) attract experienced developers to its community\\n\\n吸引不到足够多的人\\n\\nPoolTogether 是为小白提供的论坛，但是它的复杂架构需要有经验的人。\\n\\nparadox：维护工作应当逐渐移交给社区用户，但是用户都是小白\\n\\n> I feel there is a lack of skill sets in the community. I would love our community's users to be developers and more professional.\\n\\n#### Knowledge asymmetries between the core team and technical contributors are difficult to bridge\\n\\n#### Unclear expectations around decision-making powers can frustrate technical contributors\\n\\n> For example, a core team member's decision to change the quorum from 4/6 to 2/6 for the multisig managed by the Ethereum ops team, ops team members expressed confusion as to why this was permitted to happen without their knowledge.\\n\\n> On the other hand, ops team members may also desire a certain level of agency and responsibility in decisions within the domain of operations, which might in turn inspire greater commitment, engagement and better performance in their roles.\\n\\n技术团队在治理过程中的位置？\\n\\n### 4: The HR SubDAO: Applying lessons in Human Resources from PoolGrants\\n\\n如何管理人力？to offer genuine job security and financial stability\\n\\n![The HR Subdao](https://otherinter.net/PoolTogether/pt-subdao.png)\\n\\nAs one interviewee put it:\\n\\n> Coordinape is an amazing long term solution, but I can't show that to my landlord \\\\[as income\\\\]… If DAOS are the new companies then they should be able to employ people properly.\\n\\nDAO 美好，但是 landlord 不管这些\\n\\n#### Differing perspectives on compensation could make it difficult to reach consensus around the HR subDAO's design\\n\\n> what types of contributions deserve compensation, and how they should be compensated\\n\\n标准问题\\n\\n> I think there are very different viewpoints. Everyone agrees that contribution needs to be rewarded, and there are so many opportunities out there and some people really need the money and if there are no incentives they can easily contribute somewhere else. The data viewpoint, and this is the view that I share in part, is that without contribution there can't be any reward. What I like to see is people do something without permission and then if the community loves it then it will be taken care of. There will be a reward if you contribute. There isn't a need to beg for a salary.\\n\\n**There isn't a need to beg for a salary.**\\n\\n> As with PoolGrants, contributions that are proactive and initiative-taking seem to be valued more, while formalized work agreements are seen as more troublesome:\\n\\n> The risk if you have someone on payroll is that they start to become lazy.\\n\\n怕人变懒\\n\\n> the ways to value technical or \\\"hard\\\" labor vs social, interpersonal, affective or \\\"soft\\\" labor\\n> Should the community managers get paid? Of course. Should they be getting paid more than the developers? No, they shouldn't get paid as much. They are valuable but there wouldn't be a community without the protocol itself.\\n\\n管理人员和开发者的收益差异？\\n\\n#### High transparency, combined with a lack of HR structures, can undermine employees' sense of job security and workplace trust\\n\\n> When accepting a position of employment, DAO contributors must also come to terms with the fact that their activities and performance can be scrutinized by fellow community members.\\n\\n是否所有人都习惯这种透明性？\\n\\n> Additionally, as was the case within PoolGrants, the lack of formal mediation and conflict resolution process, such as those developed for traditional HR contexts, may leave employees feeling vulnerable, attacked and overexposed.\\n\\n#### The HR subDAO is a time-sensitive project as DAOs increasingly compete for human capital\\n\\n> A week or two ago he started a job at \\\\[another protocol\\\\]. That's kind of a lost opportunity, PoolTogether should have hired him instead… because he's more involved in PoolTogether. \\\\[But the other protocol\\\\] went to him and made a big offer he couldn't say no to.\\n\\n被别的协议竞价抢走了\\n\\n### 如何构建社区多样性\\n\\n> While most crypto protocols understand the need for a broad base of holders and participants, referring to all these users as one \\\"community\\\" can be misleading.\\n\\n> From this perspective, said one contributor, \\\"community is great, but they are armchair critics and meme creators.\\\" PoolTogether Inc are the \\\"adults in the room,\\\" and community members are \\\"casuals\\\" who lack relevant professional skillsets and or technical competency.\\n\\n社区很好，但是他们并不一定在做重要的事情；此外，社区内的 skillset 有差异\\n\\n另外偏重技术能力的补偿，可能导致社区 manager 不被重视，从而被其他协议搞走\\n\\n> Beyond this, PoolTogether Inc has not defined quality standards or success metrics for contribution types.\\n\\n对贡献的完成质量标准没有定义\\n\\n> we propose that PoolTogether needs three distinct community constituencies to grow adoption: believers, governance practitioners, and developers. In order to perform their best, each contributor type needs a different labor model.\\n\\n不同的工作采用不同的评估模型\\n\\n1. Believers\\n\\n* contributors who generate goodwill and maintain a welcoming, positive environment.\\n* 通过 peer-to-peer 的 tip 文化\\n\\n1. Governance practitioners\\n\\n* 持治理代币的人\\n* tokenholders and users with an entrepreneurial mindset and enough technical literacy to see strategic opportunities for treasury deployment or tokenomic improvements\\n* Governance proposals by small-time tokenholders are often unhelpful, underdefined, or otherwise lack credibility.\\n* In some cases, proposals seemed to be tolerated by the core team rather than supported enthusiastically. While the proposal passed, the initiative failed to gain traction, due to the lack of social support by the core team. 容忍社区的提案，但是也不一定有后续吸引力。\\n* 有能力的人和去中心化治理之间的冲突\\n* 要有好的补偿，吸引有能力的人；考虑 VC 的人；要培训\\n\\n1. Developers\\n\\n* 采用这个协议做自己事情的人（新前端、应用等）\\n* 从 yield farm 转向激励 app 开发者\\n* Of the three community constituencies, app developers are the most amenable to a form of automated incentives. 开发者最喜欢自动化激励\\n* 如果能激励增长协议采用的扩展，Such a major upgrade to PoolTogether's incentive structure would require thoughtful tokenomic design. 需要精心设计\\n\\n社区的重要性，crypto 是一场社会现象和金融现象\\nCrypto is as much a social phenomenon as a financial one, and the vitality of this \\\"community\\\" is central to the success of any protocol.\\n\\n不同的人对社区的结构有不同的想象。\\n\\nPoolTogether and others are in the process of finding the “babies” that got thrown out with the bathwater. They're learning from experience why older org structures were devised in the first place.\\n意识到传统 org 存在的原因。\\n\\nPoolTogether and others are in the process of finding the “babies” that got thrown out with the bathwater. They're learning from experience why older org structures were devised in the first place.\\n\\nSometimes it's difficult to tell what function a particular system was serving until after it gets removed. In its absence, you can better understand its purpose. To fill the void, you re-invent the wheel — and that's not always a bad thing. You learn how (and why) it was originally designed. You make improvements. You translate the old designs into the language of the new technics that surround you in the present.\\n\\n重新创造填补虚空\\n\\nTheir problems are good ones to have:\\n\\n* how to compensate high-quality contributions,\\n* how to incentivize even more integrations,\\n* how to maintain a wholesome atmosphere in the face of rapid growth,\\n* how to make sense of the many different constituencies that exist within the community.\",\"timestamp\":1639820831,\"title\":\"Reading Report about PoolTogether\"},\"digest\":\"9Jwk0oJX_lpUYrtNeX0n9e_vNNu8JZGEllQIQeeilXQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8F347581DF09aF22e462DEb4DEdb0aA51F532931\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"XUB9oJkMwjMepRMVEYZT08QO_efYsixl4NerfmciVEg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"WkDgWC_JOq3rqxwhSQ5hZ4LHDnV5qiyf-5cewVRHM1E\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"QRNq9WnpovZUXzpAz7Fl_n82WRwAq9ylfVQNCJvFQfNEo6dK7nWAqzRqcHCZqy6rnP5MMtDUY36lXwSPmZd_ww\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x48ef10c3f05250f2561b97198d77695feb8cf3556aaa59b9898d74c32b7a2c404bc3c40afd3c10146f3c2eadc928c66878c1d66253c382f1041961a73195d50c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"XUB9oJkMwjMepRMVEYZT08QO_efYsixl4NerfmciVEg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"WkDgWC_JOq3rqxwhSQ5hZ4LHDnV5qiyf-5cewVRHM1E\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"9Jwk0oJX_lpUYrtNeX0n9e_vNNu8JZGEllQIQeeilXQ\"}"
