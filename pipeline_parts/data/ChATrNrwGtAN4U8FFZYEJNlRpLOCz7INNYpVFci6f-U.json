"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Today, January 1st, 2022, we are announcing ArtDAO.\\n\\n2021 was a crazy year. NFTs (non-fungible tokens) have been rapidly sweeping the worlds of digital art and collectibles. More than $22 billion in NFT was traded on all NFT platforms, which made 2021 a phenomenal start for digital creators. NFTs are not fads. They have, as we all can see, revolutionized the art world. Artist Rafaël Rozendaal tweeted: “In 22 years of making art online, I’ve never had such networked experiences like nft drops”. Many digital artists have been experiencing dramatic career changes, new feelings of making art and money. We strongly believe this is only the beginning and that NFTs will play an essential role in the future of digital art.\\n\\nAs we’re excited about exploring the unknowns in NFTs and making waves in art history, we came up with the idea of building an experimental project: Meta.Art, an Ethereum-based gallery. We want it to be a decentralized gallery run by a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) from the start because we believe in the group’s strength as a collection of the world’s most creative individuals. So here comes ArtDAO.\\n\\n### A community that connects art enthusiasts all around the world.\\n\\nLet’s take a peek back in time and we can find that the world is accelerating its evolution. Just a few decades ago, most people still worked in factories. However, the majority of today’s youth work indoors and in front of computers. We used to shop in brick-and-mortar stores, but we have become extremely reliant on online purchasing in recent years. Since the invention of the computer, our lives are increasingly becoming digitized. We can see that the digitalized world will be an indispensable part of our lives. Artists will also be an important part of this new industry.\\n\\nThe global population of digital artists has increased a lot. Meanwhile, there are more and more NFT art collectors. ArtDAO aims to be a DAO that connects art enthusiasts all around the world. Meanwhile, we believe ArtDAO is an effective way to work with like-minded folks around the globe. We will share Meta.Art Gallery’s interests together and make it a better place for us together.\\n\\n### To explore the possibilities of the on-chain gallery.\\n\\nProbably no gallery has been run by a group of art enthusiasts from throughout the world ever since. By promoting democratic governance and broad cooperation, we hope to assist usher in a new era of digital art’s revival through the use of blockchain technology. Members will be able to express their own opinions and work collaboratively to explore and experiment with Meta.Art’s potentials.\\n\\nWe believe that on-chain galleries will evolve into something different than traditional galleries, enabling digital artists to create and continue to make significant contributions to art history, while also making art much more accessible to the general public.\\n\\n### The Meta.Art Membership NFT.\\n\\nThe Meta.Art Membership NFT is a key to the ArtDAO community. While designing our product, we have kept in mind that innovation is critical, which resulted in this version of Meta.Art’s membership NFT. To us, a blockchain-based membership card should be more than just a digital counterpart of the old membership card. It should embody the blockchain ethos, as Meta.Art is an on-chain gallery.\\n\\nAs a result, we’re making each Meta.Art membership NFT completely unique based on the blockchain transaction hash. The hashes are significant because they represent the transaction executed when you mint the NFT. However, the hashes themselves, 66-character codes, are monotonous and uninteresting, but we visualize them as a rainbow of colors, which means we want to brighten up the world of art.\\n\\nThese are the broad strokes, but there are many more details to share and discuss.
