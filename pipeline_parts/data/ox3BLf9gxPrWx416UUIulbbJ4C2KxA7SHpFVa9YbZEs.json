"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*Hi there! [CyberConnect](https://cyberconnect.me/) is a decentralized protocol for constructing blockchain address-based social graphs. We democratize social connections and make social graphs self-sovereign, portable, composable, blockchain-agnostic, and contextually meaningful. If you like what we are building, make sure to play around our [site](https://cyberconnect.me/), subscribe to this newsletter, check out our [Mirror](https://cyberconnect.fyi/mirror), and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CyberConnectHQ).*\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nMerry Christmas from the HQ, people!\\n\\nIt's that time of the year again: chilly wind and mulled wine, sparkling lights and wool socks, letters and songs, and we turn heart and soul to the dearest ones in life. Well, tbh it never feels like winter here at the HQ - the hustle never stops, and things move fast.\\n\\nBut we just would like to take the chance, and pause for a bit, to reflect on how far we've come together, with you, our fellow dwellers, builders, partners, and backers. And we decided to start sharing with you, on a biweekly basis, our results, sparks of ideas, conversations in the loop, and all the community initiatives you could be part of.\\n\\nThis is our first entry.\\n\\nWe've covered great distances since summer!\\n\\n* We launched the world's first decentralized social graph protocol, effectively creating a universal data layer for any dApp to plug in social functions. Check out the *[webapp](https://app.cyberconnect.me/)*.\\n* We welcomed 57,000 Web3 dwellers onto our self-sovereign social graph network, making more than 530,000 portable connections. The protocol has got 7M API calls. All within less than a month since initial launch.\\n* We now have a vibrant community: 5,554 “Web3 Dwellers” in our Discord community and 10.7k followers on Twitter, all with organic growth. Pretty incredible given how early we still are. Numerous community events were launched, and we’re about to kick off many more to celebrate the milestones with our community.\\n* We partnered with great projects at the core of Web3: zkLink, Treasureland, TheConvoSpace, POAP, Unlock, Project Galaxy, Roci Finance, Huddln, with plenty more cool ones in the pipeline.\\n* We closed our seed round funding of $10M, backed by an incredible group of crypto visionaries, Web3 native investors, and fellow founders. *[Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/124510/web3-social-infrastructure-startup-cyberconnect-raises-10-million-in-seed-funding)*\\n* We grew our team to a focused and mighty 20, distributed all across the globe and concerted by a shared vision for a user-centric Web3, and we are still actively looking for great minds to *[join us](https://cyberconnect.fyi/careers)*.\\n\\nWe are *really* proud of how far we’ve come and can't stop marveling at the energy and synergy from our extended CyberConnect family. We are grateful for that. And now, we are more than ready, indeed hyped, to get back to work and build with our partners to deliver truly Web3 social experiences.\\n\\nThis is the daybreak for Web3. We are just setting off.\\n\\nOld walls receding, wind in the sail, great horizon awaits.\\n\\nIt’s our greatest privilege to have you on the journey.\\n\\nBelow are the updates from recent weeks just in case you missed anything. And before we forget, have a great holiday and a happy new year!
