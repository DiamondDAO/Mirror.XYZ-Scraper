Unwilling to give money to outstanding employees is the biggest waste of company profits. because of him\\n\\nEntrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs 179\\n\\nWe will not try our best. Slaves donâ€™t need money, but slaves are the least efficient. The slave owner found that not giving money was the least efficient. So let the slaves become free farmers, and then pay them according to their labor.\\n\\n1. Cherish the best talents. A mediocre person can recognize who is a good person, but they will hate the good person, and eventually let the good person leave or ruin. Excellent talents generally have personalities and are difficult to get along with, but the boss must learn to look at the results. As long as there is performance, we must cherish them so that they will make money for us.\\n2. Don't waste time for problematic employees. Some bosses like to educate those problematic employees, and even naively think that they have the ability to change these employees. In fact, it is very difficult for an adult to be changed. His parents and teachers have not changed him, let alone you? Ten years of trees and a hundred years of trees can grow people. Boss should spend time and energy on those outstanding employees to make them better and create more performance. The profit of the enterprise comes from only 20% of outstanding employees.

Set high standards for employees. Don't be afraid that they won't reach it. Give them a goal, let them climb, get the best of it, and get it. Choose the middle, get the bottom.\\n\\nIf they do well and meet high standards, reward them immediately. Many veterans say they have good leadership when their performance is good. When performance is poor, the employees are blamed for their incompetence. This is a very stupid character, don't take credit for subordinates.\\n\\nBut you can't let your employees just lie on the transcript when they have scores. You have to continue to encourage them to achieve higher performance.\",\"timestamp\":1634800532,\"title\":\"How to treat employees\"},\"digest\":\"DZRlz7EivSjE3FgerRKe9DvFI-MvtMPyKdbgZTpFoPo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Kqwju0M8jt9BHGl8A6yFpJ_dHe1xhEGqbmWRD_jUBFimRMw4N6chzWSa5BaJf3lHwGQ3tQM3x-aFrrkpkSqlww\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"DZRlz7EivSjE3FgerRKe9DvFI-MvtMPyKdbgZTpFoPo\"}"
