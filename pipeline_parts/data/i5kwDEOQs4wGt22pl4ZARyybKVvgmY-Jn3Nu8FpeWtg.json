"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"[Wolf Game](https://wolf.game/) is crazy interesting because it combines NFTs, DeFi, staking, and game theory. When they first launched there was an exploit in the contract that caused them to pause minting and ultimately migrate to a clean contract without exploits. \\n\\nWhen this happened the Shepherd was transparent, paused the current contract, and communicated to the community effectively. \\n\\n[https://twitter.com/wolfdotgame/status/1462665060908736515?](https://twitter.com/wolfdotgame/status/1462665060908736515?)\\n\\nAfter several people in the discord recommended creating a bounty program for the community to find and submit bugs/vulnerabilities in the contract, the Shepherd introduced a bug bounty program.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/wolfdotgame/status/1464410849263513602](https://twitter.com/wolfdotgame/status/1464410849263513602)\\n\\nSince now there’s a new contract and new game mechanics, the Shepherd quickly reintroduced a plan for how the game was going to work and what was going to happen with $wool. \\n\\n[https://twitter.com/wolfdotgame/status/1463735240418115588](https://twitter.com/wolfdotgame/status/1463735240418115588)\\n\\nThe Shepherd also began working with auditors and publicly announced working with [Mueller Berndt](https://twitter.com/muellerberndt), also known as The Herdsman, who is an award-winning independent security researcher.  \\n\\n[https://twitter.com/wolfdotgame/status/1464098347048914945?](https://twitter.com/wolfdotgame/status/1464098347048914945?)\\n\\nAll of this is transparency helps me gain conviction around Wolf Game. When you combine that with the innovation that happening with the game, the speed in which they’re shipping code, and the people that are publicly supporting the game, I am very woolish on Wolf Game.\\n\\nP.S. Someone from the community named [Skarly Warly](https://twitter.com/SkarlyWarly) created this [really cool dashboard](https://wolfgame.live/) that tracks the floor price of wolves, sheep, land, farmers, and wool pouches. \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AT47S0vAdL0bw5lheq86h.png?height=1924&width=3046)\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1641075793,\"title\":\"Here's Why I'm Bullish On Wolf Game\"},\"digest\":\"jFB865ACT0nfH3fYhrHWo8SvZJZlAWzzdYIKMTyYfvE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7D2f3759C6F870E8bBDaB368A7d7e158e41761EA\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2abRzDwMgcub2a5Sm1Z2TgttamN7--fesHhOxXmpQYo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"leT-4dGnMso01m8IHauQSWst8jVYPsZE70-nwu1YEhM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"dR3sMYTcjiZRTsc3E9F3W_DHC6x55_pDewYsCyQHnATGGNVegBdACgAOqHhg0PD_ZEHi6IlnnPGjgiUdBoTjxw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xfa951e462369c70bfd6a553547e466c627b3d34881dd00f4fb037570698202774b5d6a1d2563aa52851034df7430fdbb452ddc01d5781366d278d85e222543551c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2abRzDwMgcub2a5Sm1Z2TgttamN7--fesHhOxXmpQYo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"leT-4dGnMso01m8IHauQSWst8jVYPsZE70-nwu1YEhM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jFB865ACT0nfH3fYhrHWo8SvZJZlAWzzdYIKMTyYfvE\"}"
