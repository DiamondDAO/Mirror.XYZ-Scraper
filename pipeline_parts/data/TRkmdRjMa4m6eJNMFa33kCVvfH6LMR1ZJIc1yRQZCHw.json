"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"Marjory,\\\" he breathed, passionately, \\\" don't treat me so. Don't treat me-\\\"\\n\\nShe wrenched her hand from him in regal indignation. \\\" One or two rings make it uncomfortable for the hand that is grasped by an angry gentleman.\\\" She held her fingers and gazed as if she expected to find them mere debris. \\\" I am sorry that you are not interested in the students rolling that man in the snow. It is the greatest scene our quiet life can afford.\\\"\\n\\nHe was regarding her as a judge faces a lying culprit. \\\" I know,\\\" he said, after a pause. \\\" Somebody has been telling you some stories. You have been hearing something about me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Some stories ? \\\" she enquired. \\\" Some stories about you? What do you mean? Do you mean that I remember stories I may happen to hear about people? \\\"\\n\\nThere was another pause and then Coleman's face flared red. He beat his hand violently upon a table. \\\" Good God, Marjory! Don't make a fool of me. Don't make this kind of a fool of me, at any rate. Tell me what you mean. Explain-\\\"\\n\\nShe laughed at him. \\\" Explain? Really, your vocabulary is getting extensive, but it is dreadfully awkward to ask people to explain when there is nothing to explain.\\\"\\n\\nHe glanced at her, \\\" I know as well as you do that your father is taking you to Greece in order to get rid of me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" And do people have to go to Greece in order to get rid of you? \\\" she asked, civilly. \\\" I think you are getting excited.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Marjory,\\\" he began, stormily. She raised her hand. \\\" Hush,\\\" she said, \\\"there is somebody coming.\\\" A bell had rung. A maid entered the room. \\\" Mr. Coke,\\\" she said. Marjory nodded. In the interval of waiting, Coleman gave the girl a glance that mingled despair with rage and pride. Then Coke burst with half-tamed rapture into the room. \\\" Oh, Miss Wainwright,\\\" he almost shouted, \\\" I can't tell you how glad I am. I just heard to-day you were going. Imagine it. It will be more--oh, how are you Coleman, how are you \\\" \\\"\\n\\nMarjory welcomed the new-comer with a cordiality that might not have thrilled Coleman with pleasure. They took chairs that formed a triangle and one side of it vibrated with talk. Coke and Marjory engaged in a tumultuous conversation concerning the prospective trip to Greece. The Sunday editor, as remote as if the apex of his angle was the top of a hill, could only study the girl's clear profile. The youthful voices of the two others rang like bells. He did not scowl at Coke; he merely looked at him as if be gently disdained his mental calibre. In fact all the talk seemed to tire him; it was childish; as for him, he apparently found this babble almost insupportable.\\n\\n\\\" And, just think of the camel rides we'll have,\\\" cried Coke.\\n\\n\\\" Camel rides,\\\" repeated Coleman, dejectedly. \\\" My dear Coke.\\\"\\n\\nFinally he arose like an old man climbing from a sick bed. \\\"Well, I am afraid I must go, Miss Wainwright.\\\" Then he said affectionately to Coke: \\\" Good-bye, old boy. I hope you will have a good time.\\\"\\n\\nMarjory walked with him to the door. He shook her hand in a friendly fashion. \\\" Good-bye, Marjory,' he said. \\\" Perhaps it may happen that I shan't see you again before you start for Greece and so I had best bid you God-speed---or whatever the term is now. You will have a charming time; Greece must be a delightful place. Really, I envy you, Marjory. And now my dear child \\\"-his voice grew brotherly, filled with the patronage of generous fraternal love, \\\" although I may never see you again let me wish you fifty as happy years as this last one has been for me.\\\" He smiled frankly into her eyes; then dropping her hand, he went away.\\n\\nCoke renewed his tempest of talk as Marjory turned toward him. But after a series of splendid eruptions, whose red fire illumined all of ancient and modem Greece, he too went away.\\n\\nThe professor was in his. library apparently absorbed in a book when a tottering pale-faced woman appeared to him and, in her course toward a couch in a corner of the room, described almost a semi-circle. She flung herself face downward. A thick strand of hair swept over her shoulder. \\\" Oh, my heart is broken! My heart is broken! \\\"\\n\\nThe professor arose, grizzled and thrice-old with pain. He went to the couch, but he found himself a handless, fetless man. \\\" My poor child,\\\" he said. \\\" My poor child.\\\" He remained listening stupidly to her convulsive sobbing. A ghastly kind of solemnity came upon the room.\\n\\nSuddenly the girl lifted herself and swept the strand of hair away from her face. She looked at the professor with the wide- open dilated eyes of one who still sleeps. \\\" Father,\\\" she said in a hollow voice, \\\" he don't love me. He don't love me. He don't love me. at all. You were right, father.\\\" She began to laugh.\\n\\n\\\"Marjory,\\\" said the professor, trembling. \\\"Be quiet, child. Be quiet.\\\"\\n\\n[ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/122](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/122)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638785998,\"title\":\"He reached for her hand and grasped it vise-like\"},\"digest\":\"kVcN5IQSiayWGJZb0BlBaZEUZ3CkR59DimA9ycmcLU4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6A321BD15f7B900C7F8Dd29Ce6ed73fa0E7D220F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fl-wCOu91N5YGqQaGjwczKEKde9wmqCpiEg4Wj4UhbQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"nUIkZwMkFd2w0gpjOuksiGC2dDrEQF-DuV6-u_aJ9jE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"RFgHxApE12AMcZKavIK620tSCsJR3Nyo3hMrH-9vCXlhX4UBb1vogyO_TAlAKtjpyoUYkqXvkx1hE4IWloPxLg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe13f28e5feb5aef335884b4fe870e5ae93d21cd7a3369e68eaf30e05c21c5e9b021ebcb4d9dd4c49bb0cf7dce523f25764688791f38bd1c5ae4e626685cf6e131b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fl-wCOu91N5YGqQaGjwczKEKde9wmqCpiEg4Wj4UhbQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"nUIkZwMkFd2w0gpjOuksiGC2dDrEQF-DuV6-u_aJ9jE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"kVcN5IQSiayWGJZb0BlBaZEUZ3CkR59DimA9ycmcLU4\"}"
