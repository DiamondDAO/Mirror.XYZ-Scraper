They are an indispensable part of our workforce. There is no doubt that many construction projects would be lack of manpower without them. In addition, a large number of migrant workers stimulate the consumption of food and daily items. All these are positive aspects of migrant workers in cities. \\n \\n\\nHowever, as a popular saying goes, “Everything has two sides”. The same is the case with migrant workers. First, they have trouble getting their children into child care centers and schools because they are unregistered residents in the city. Second, most of the migrant workers swarm into big cities just to make money. Being not well-educated and incompetent, they are a potentialthreat to the peace and stability of the society. \\n \\n\\nIn my opinion, in the appraisal of migrant workers, it is one-sided to affirm everything or to negate everything. We should appreciate the great contribution made by them, and at the same time pay enough attention to the problems caused by them.\",\"timestamp\":1641024294,\"title\":\"The Role of Migrant Workers\"},\"digest\":\"zGAlODQwKZsKut4b6l2X2dLXfNqoK2YNGNzsp9cnNmw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x669af564bE007873120FFbd1B38a4adB415B2cE1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jxpYKPeY_JR4Mw9wC29B0s_XbNTWbr2mzMOcfPFBvU4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Q4sWqaV8GeD6eZl8fMWoSeP5weOPFjj1vRIfdq9OmL8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"sSpmIAbVK_PZ2Q0KTt_qv886CkJRMAzx3b-bYzC7RSy92F01kIklrOJUHcCj88FnDpfzQo_ZwM0OQF-Im52dNQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9332ed061c9a122747bea280a268d87e156ac016bfcf65edda7a1749c895ce1f2df8023517c843e46d4c190a681f10c6e8f6ed7318769dcb779a63babd8e4a501c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jxpYKPeY_JR4Mw9wC29B0s_XbNTWbr2mzMOcfPFBvU4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Q4sWqaV8GeD6eZl8fMWoSeP5weOPFjj1vRIfdq9OmL8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"zGAlODQwKZsKut4b6l2X2dLXfNqoK2YNGNzsp9cnNmw\"}"
