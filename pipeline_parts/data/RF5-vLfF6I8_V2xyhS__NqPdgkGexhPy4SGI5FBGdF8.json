"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The Carnivore Diet is a way of eating consisting of entirely meat and excludes all other foods.\\n\\nIt’s been indicated to aid in weight loss, mental issues and reduced heart disease risk among a myriad of other health issues.\\n\\nThis article will be going over what exactly is going on within the Carnivore Diet, debunking common myths, modern/ancient history of the diet, my theory on why America does not want you to know about it and also why in my subjective view it’s the most optimal diet for a human being.\\n\\n### What’s going on in your body while doing the Carnivore Diet?\\n\\nWhen you start doing the Carnivore Diet your body will begin depleting Its glycogen stores. This process takes 3-4 days in which your body will enter a natural metabolic state known as Ketosis. This state is characterized by an elevated amount of ketones in the blood and urine serving as a fuel source. It provides energy to your brain and central nervous system. The body is burning stored fats for energy instead of carbohydrates. It’s also key to note that the depletion of carbs will often be followed by an excretion of water weight as for every gram of glycogen there is [3 grams](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25911631/) of water. Your body will then also be in the initial stages of body recomposition.\\n\\nSome would say that ketosis is an alternate fuel source and response to low glucose.  I would argue that ketosis is the body’s natural condition. When fasting for 12-16 hours ketones are reported at a lower level of \\\\~.05mM and those levels increase to 1 - 2mM after 48 hours. Meat does not have any carbs so while eating on the Carnivore Diet your ketone levels will be at constantly elevated levels. It’s not viable to achieve the state of ketosis on a typical diet which has an average intake of 225-325 grams of carbohydrates a day.\\n\\n## Benefits of the Carnivore Diet over a normal diet.\\n\\n![Are vegetables required to be healthy?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5YMWUyIfcj8cOhhwU2d23.jpeg?height=1500&width=3000)\\n\\n**The Carnivore Diet** has several advantages over a typical diet, this may range from a High Carbohydrate to Low-Fat diet, Vegan to Plant-based diet or the common Standard American Diet also known as SAD.\\n\\nPeople on the Carnivore Diet typically report weight loss, an increased level of mental clarity and remission of prior health issues.\\n\\nThis is due to a variety of factors. We have already established that there is a natural biological function known as ketosis actively at work within your body. Another factor that separates this diet from the others is that there is zero sugar/carbohydrates/plants.\\n\\n**Lets take a look at this [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5912158/) for a little context on carbohydrates**\\n\\n`“Three lines of evidence support the concept of food addiction: (1) behavioral responses to certain foods are similar compared to substances of abuse; (2) food intake regulation and addiction rely on similar neurobiological circuits; (3) individuals suffering from obesity or addiction show similar neurochemical- and brain activation patterns.”`\\n\\n`“High glycemic index carbohydrates elicit a rapid shift in blood glucose and insulin levels, akin to the pharmacokinetics of addictive substances. Akin to drugs of abuse, glucose and insulin signals in the mesolimbic system to modify dopamine concentration. Sugar elicits addiction-like craving and self-reported problem foods are rich in high glycemic index carbohydrates. These properties make high glycemic index carbohydrates plausible triggers for food addiction.“`\\n\\n`“Food addiction is a plausible etiological factor contributing to the heterogeneous condition and phenotype of obesity. In at least a subset of vulnerable individuals, high glycemic index carbohydrates trigger addiction-like neurochemical and behavioral responses.”`\\n\\nWhat we know of carbs generally is that they are “sweet” and from this study we can see that there is a connection similar to drugs of abuse with consumption of high glycemic carbohydrates. They trigger addiction-like responses in relation to people’s behavior and mental state.\\n\\nIn my opinion people are facing a losing battle trying to lose weight because at any given moment they can be prey to these high glycemic carbs which cause powerful spikes in blood sugar leading to further cravings.\\n\\n**Lets take a look at another [study](https://aces.illinois.edu/news/carbohydrates-and-cancer-study-shows-research-limited-post-diagnosis-nutrition)**\\n\\n`“In this study, intakes of carbohydrate and fat were independently associated with cancer outcomes. Looking across both phases (pre- and post-treatment), higher intakes of carbohydrate, total sugar, glycemic load, and simple carbohydrate foods were variably associated with greater recurrence and mortality, whereas post-treatment medium fat intake was associated with lower recurrence and mortality. These observations suggest that both restriction of dietary carbohydrate and a moderate increase in dietary fat may have independent effects, and suggest that overall macronutrient composition, rather than foods or macronutrients individually, may be relevant in determining cancer outcomes. The theoretical basis through which alteration in dietary carbohydrate or fat intake could affect cancer-related outcomes has been reviewed.6, 9 In general, higher dietary carbohydrate could provide the glucose necessary to support metabolism of cancer cells, which are obligately glycolytic. Higher carbohydrate intake also stimulates insulin secretion, which not only accelerates glucose uptake by cancer cells, but also stimulates mitogenesis. Higher fat intake could impair metabolism of cancer cells, which cannot use fat as a fuel, and would increase production of ketones, which appear to interfere with cancer cell glycolysis”`\\n\\nThis study points in the direction of high carbohydrate intake leaning towards being a catalyst for an uncontrollable disease also known as cancer. While on the other hand the production of ketones as a result of higher fat intake was shown to impair cancer cells. This seems pretty damning but I’ll let you take a look at the [study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.31413) from The *International Journal of Cancer* yourself. Another [study](https://academic.oup.com/jncics/article/3/2/pkz034/5492023) found that colon and rectal cancers had the highest number of diet-related cases at 38.3% while it’s been [estimated](https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/107/4/djv044/894954) that diet accounts for 35% of cancer overall.\\n\\nI would say some markers for general health would include not being overweight/obese, exercising, eating around your TDEE, not suffering from persistent health issues and a good degree of mental health as well. It doesn’t seem effective to me to simply reduce calories through CICO which is what’s commonly done on a normal diet to lose weight. You are at risk from suffering severe mental issues never-mind the [cardiovascular](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24493081/) issues added sugar is linked to. The Carnivore Diet meanwhile has demonstrated signs of promoting mental clarity all across the board while allowing people to eat until comfortably satiated which is often as a result less eating overall. There is also evidence to suggest that it has pushed diseases into remission through the state of [ketosis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31399389/) evidenced to a degree through the keto diet (which is just the restriction of carbs at 20 grams or less).\\n\\n`“The ketogenic diet probably creates an unfavorable metabolic environment for cancer cells and thus can be regarded as a promising adjuvant as a patient-specific multifactorial therapy. The majority of preclinical and several clinical studies argue for the use of the ketogenic diet in combination with standard therapies based on its potential to enhance the antitumor effects of classic chemo- and radiotherapy, its overall good safety and tolerability and increase in quality of life. However, to further elucidate the mechanisms of the ketogenic diet as a therapy and evaluate its application in clinical practice, more molecular studies as well as uniformly controlled clinical trials are needed.”`\\n\\nA vegan diet puts you at risk for deficiencies as there is no B12 in plants while a normal diet often requires extra supplementing to fulfill nutritional needs. The Carnivore Diet in comparison allows you to obtain all essential nutrients from eating just meat.\\n\\nThere was a great chart on reddit by the user [Qondrar_The_Redeemer](https://www.reddit.com/user/Qondrar_The_Redeemer/) which I will link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/zerocarb/comments/8ms8f1/the_bioavailability_and_absorption_of_nutrients/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) showing the shocking difference of bioavailability (how much your body can absorb from consuming it) of plant foods compared to meat. Meat has by far a staggeringly higher amount of absorption of nutrients juxtaposed to plants.\\n\\n### Common myths surrounding the Carnivore Diet.\\n\\n![A diet of just meat has to be unhealthy...right?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ySyp4f--Ltg3hyc75m76-.jpeg?height=3128&width=3284)\\n\\n1. **Your brain needs glucose to function.**\\n\\n   This is false as we have already explored above that Ketosis is a natural biological function where ketone bodies are in flux throughout your blood and fueling your brain for energy.\\n2. **The Carnivore Diet is restrictive.**\\n\\n   This is true and false depending upon your perspective. The mindset of many Carnivores tend to view food in a new light, food as fuel, something to eat and move on while not becoming a highlight of the day but a mere component we enjoy. The standard American diet has a variety of foods that is true, it is also true that the Carnivore Diet has a variety of meats. Me and other Carnivore’s tastebuds changed when transitioning to this diet and there is a lack of cravings for carbohydrates almost a complete mental disconnect due to its absence. I wouldn’t say that the Carnivore Diet is restrictive, I would just say it is merely simple and fulfilling.\\n3. **What about Vitamin C?**\\n\\n   There is a reduced need of Vitamin C for people on the Carnivore Diet. This is due to several factors one being that Vitamin C is required to extract energy from carbohydrates so henceforth the more carbs you are consuming the more Vitamin C you will need. Carnivores do not consume carbs so we don’t have that requirement. Vitamin C is also utilized to synthesize collagen which fresh meat contains plenty of. There is in-fact Vitamin C in meat as well although it’s a low amount meat is highly bioavailable so there’s a reduced need for it on the Carnivore Diet as well as an uncertainty if Carnivores even need it at all.\\n4. **You’re going to die from heart disease in the long-term.**\\n\\n   This is outright false. There has not been a *single* study correlating any harm to just a diet of fresh meat and water. There has been links with heart disease in studies in which the participants were eating a high amount of carbs along with processed meats (like bacon or sausage which has sugar, celery powder, spices, additives, preservatives, artificial ingredients etc.). I have provided thorough research studies relating to the Carnivore Diet at the bottom section of this article.\\n5. **Wait! I know you need fiber right? Where are you getting your Fiber?**\\n\\n   Fiber is not an essential nutrient it is indigestible and only important on a heavy-carb diet to slow the absorption of carbs you are filling your body with. This [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3435786/) actually shows that patients suffering from constipation who removed or reduced fiber had significant improvement in symptoms while those who continued a high fiber diet had no change in their condition.\\n\\n   `“Idiopathic constipation and its associated symptoms can be effectively reduced by stopping or even lowering the intake of dietary fiber.”`\\n\\n   The issue with the current landscape of nutrition is that it’s all based on the Standard American Diet which is unfortunately very sad (no pun intended).\\n\\n### What can I eat on the Carnivore Diet and is it affordable?\\n\\nFoods in which you can eat include beef, lamb, chicken, pork, turkey, organ meats, salmon, sardines, fish and any other meat.\\n\\nI would recommend eating ruminant animals which include cattle, lamb, sheep, moose, elk, bison, deer or any other ruminant. The reason I advise you to eat these animals is because ruminant’s digestive system are optimized at processing the beneficial components of plants and discarding the lesser elements. They are also much more satiating. The PUFA’s in pork and chicken and some other non-ruminants are also substantially high as they are fed poor grains which they can not process which leads to their fat quality being lower. In my personal experience I’ve never felt the same satiation eating chicken, pork or any other non-ruminant in comparison to ruminants especially beef.\\n\\nThe Carnivore Diet is very affordable, my standard daily meal is a pound of 70/30 ground beef along with a frozen beef burger. This is unbelievably highly satiating cooked in a skillet with all the fat crisping up into the beef MHMMM. I order all my meat online personally as to avoid meat sold in stores which usually has additives, preservatives, possible allergens, meat processed on shared equipment or artificial ingredients which will detract from your Carnivore experience. Ground beef usually ranges from 4.99$ to 7.99$. My order’s online averages at around 200$ a month. I also buy a box of Walmart’s 8LB 32 count 100% pure beef frozen burgers for 20$. (frozen burgers sold in stores are pretty much the only meat you can count on to not have anything added and are often in the range of 10$ to 30$).\\n\\nYou are going to want to eat high fat meats for optimal satiety. Meat which has a higher fat to protein ratio is ideal. I would recommend all of the following meats from 70/30-80/20 ground beef, ribeye steak (often a bit expensive I have it every once in a while), and frenched lamb rib rack (also often quite a bit expensive) just to name a few. This way of eating is rather simple and doesn’t require you to eat a ribeye steak everyday. I eat 70/30 ground beef everyday as it’s highly satiating and outright delicious.\\n\\nI excluded things like dairy because they are a byproduct of animals and they tend to be sources of inflammation due to their lactose content. Eggs tend to be inflammatory as well. This includes things like ghee and butter which have traces of lactose, cheese which has traces of lactose not to mention food colorings etc.\\n\\nIt is my belief that the intake of these inflammatory foods could cause possible reactions within your body and affect your progress so my advice would be to abstain from them completely initially consuming just fresh meat and water and then reintroduce them if you are curious.\\n\\n## My theory on why America doesn’t want you to know about the Carnivore Diet\\n\\n![Doctor's aren't even taught nutrition...where do their motives really lie in regards to you the patient? ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dAlPKkQy6c31o-zziPAuO.jpeg?height=3376&width=6000)\\n\\nThe answer to why America isn’t going to push any plan towards further research for the Carnivore Diet is for one simple reason: **money.** The television industry is currently populated with frequent fast food commercials advertising food full of heavily processed high sugar foods. A medical student spends less then [one percent](https://chlpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Doctoring-Our-Diet_-September-2019-V2.pdf) of his lecture hours on even standard nutrition and you have to ask the question, why is that? This is because there is no **money** in medical professionals advocating for people to eat less carbs or sugar. It would cripple their entire “prescribe medicine to resolve your self inflicted issues model”. Their job is to diagnose you and run you into the ground with bills for unnecessary prescriptions and surgeries for the most part. The fast food industry raked in [revenue](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/fast-food-restaurants-united-states/) of $278.6 billion in 2021 while [healthcare costs](https://chlpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Doctoring-Our-Diet_-September-2019-V2.pdf) for obesity exceeded 200$ billion with diagnosed diabetes healthcare costs fairing no better at 300$ billion. This sounds like a “fine” business model to me.\\n\\nThe year 1980 is the year in which the food pyramid was pushed onto the population. Here is a picture of that food pyramid,\\n\\n![6-11 servings of carbs really? That is a staggering amount of sugar for one to be consuming!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ahopkxnz_cngFIGsMj-Rr.png?height=477&width=610)\\n\\nThis chart is just saddening and reflective of the fact that America has failed the people tremendously. In the 1960s and 1970s the obesity rate was [constant](https://lanekenworthy.net/2012/05/31/why-the-surge-in-obesity/) at 15% since this time starting in the 1980s it has more than doubled by reaching 35% in 2008 in adults. Adults weren’t the only one paying the cost but it was the children too as the obesity rate rose as well among [them](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6001a15.htm) from 5% to 17%. The latest rates we have for obesity is 2017-2018 sitting at 42.4% with 73.6% currently being [overweight.](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html) The problem is only getting worse and how are we going to resolve it? Maybe the FDA has learned from the past and can actually recommend us some good advice let’s take a look at what they suggest on Twitter,\\n\\n![Oh wow Pizza in chocolate! That's definitely beneficial to a productive society and resolving our obesity and overweight epidemic, High Glycemic Carbs Yay!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fReZwOaOcCCWell00a-MC.png?height=1600&width=1184)\\n\\nIt gets worse guess what they suggested doing under this post?\\n\\n![Who cares about eating healthy am I right..? Just take the vaccine and all will be well!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7mSIZzWa8UVJ0c19miavh.png?height=628&width=1200)\\n\\nNow I’ll be fair here and say *ok,* I don’t mind them advocating for individuals to get vaccinated that’s your choice and I’d like to believe it’s in the best interest of the society but it’s the flat-out hypocrisy that should disturb anyone. Throughout this pandemic the  data has consistently shown that there was a connection with being overweight or obese increasing your risk for contracting severe COVID-19 and dying from this virus. Now there’s the following [study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.24.465626v1.full) which was published by Stanford University October 25th finding that it can directly infect fat cells! There was another [study](https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131%2821%2900428-9) published in *Cell Metabolism* in September that stumbled upon similar findings. It’s time for America to wake up and it starts with a proper sustainable diet, right at home!\\n\\n### Studies and History of the Carnivore Diet\\n\\n![Just sit on calmly by the fire and eat meat. Mhmm.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DGaIUenuyFsC898Tgl-Ko.jpeg?height=2880&width=5120)\\n\\nThe overall research studies in relation to the Carnivore Diet has been lacking and the community still seems quite small. I suspect this is due to a myriad of reasons like social pressures, misinformation, lack of willpower and incorrect application. There are however some critical studies I’ve gathered (one as recent as 2021!) and the results are encouraging. Here are some studies that stand out (note I didn’t include any keto studies as to not mix results and to conflate ideally what I’m recommending which is strictly the Carnivore Diet of fresh meat and water. Also further note that even in some of these studies participants were still potentially eating sources of carbs/plants but it was minimized to the greatest degree we’ve seen on recorded data far.).\\n\\n**This study from 2021 reflected several positive health benefits in people eating on the Carnivore Diet** .\\n\\n`“Contrary to common expectations, adults consuming a carnivore diet experienced few adverse effects and instead reported health benefits and high satisfaction. Cardiovascular disease risk factors were variably affected. The generalizability of these findings and the long-term effects of this dietary pattern require further study.”`\\n\\nLennerz, B.

The long-term survival of this patient, now at 80 months, could be due in part to a therapeutic metabolic synergy between KMT and the IDH1 mutation that simultaneously target the glycolysis and glutaminolysis pathways that are essential for GBM growth. Further studies are needed to determine if this non-toxic therapeutic strategy could be effective in providing long-term management for other GBM patients with or without IDH mutations.”`\\n\\nSeyfried, T.

The general mental health stability effect of the diet that the data has shown evidence for, will do wonders in leading us towards a more productive society. If you’re not ready to hop right into the Carnivore Diet I truly understand but I would hope individuals could at least be more mindful in what they eat, remove more high glycemic carbs and opt for a better relationship with food and life in general.\\n\\nNow last but not least I’ll leave you guys with this historical anecdote from the Mongols who in my view had a good grasp on the concept of quality nutrition which they used to their advantage ages ago.\\n\\n\\\"The Chinese noted with surprise and disgust the ability of the Mongol warrior to survive on little food and water for long periods; according to one, the entire army could camp without a single puff of smoke since they needed no fires to cook. Compared to the Jurched soldiers, the Mongols were much healthier and stronger. The Mongols consumed a steady diet of meat, milk, yogurt, and other dairy products, and they fought men who lived on gruel made from various grains. The grain diet of the peasant warriors stunted their bones, rotted their teeth, and left them weak and prone to disease. In contrast, the poorest Mongol soldier ate mostly protein, thereby giving him strong teeth and bones.\\\"\\n\\n\\\\-- Jack Weatherford, Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World\\n\\n![Ride on Mongols, Ride on!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KE0QpzE6uq8S-wEiweKoI.jpeg?height=5592&width=7526)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1640374763,\"title\":\"Why America doesn't want you to know about the Carnivore Diet.\"},\"digest\":\"j_jtdzYnTYo2TN_Qt3Vbyk7mWvq7xmR_nMBaTgQGWe4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x32fC951CE03681345C0975dE970Bc8cFc65c8bB1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"dvqt3e8JD49zzocIJaVV2o0iONdO5dLvKPAsvPQqJg0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_RXn1ybzqCGo-FlpyuyulBDViyZ0GfiErueb5vOclIg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"0fJMWz2g9ORYQ1dU0Mo4FG-TRaRxFAqKw4q8Ee3ATllxcn5AprAfl5-W5SHIMu0x-HzHuMQu54bNz4LiRX8YCw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x99141d5c1bdc42b5bf439bae8285521a090c2c0eb4a91c3a969d9c07bfbbed172d6c70741039e0b93a20a927379166e2750b8e956f7040d7e3480b049efaeaea1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"dvqt3e8JD49zzocIJaVV2o0iONdO5dLvKPAsvPQqJg0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_RXn1ybzqCGo-FlpyuyulBDViyZ0GfiErueb5vOclIg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"bpyd6QzTfroACVGDpbu-t_GQibtOdg0ae1klmragjQY\"}"
