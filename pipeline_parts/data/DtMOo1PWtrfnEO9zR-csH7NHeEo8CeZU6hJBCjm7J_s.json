"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Being part of a new world requires you to follow a set of procedures, understand the culture of the location and assimilate the ideas of the place. This weekend I wanted to be part of the NTF world. It is amazing to learn what is involved, discover the hidden cost of being part of a new venture and learn every step that I need to get through the field to reach my goal of getting my first NTF.\\n\\nThe approach that I used this time is a little bit different from how most people will do it, but the experience was so unique that it is worth sharing.\\n\\nI have been learning about this new world in the last month. Several friends have been providing me with their advice. Someone has provided very good advice and I am learning a lot, other has been very good to confuse me, increase my level of ignorance and always convince me that digital money is not for me and make me consider quitting.\\n\\nLucky for me, I got invited to participate in Crypto Lucha Club, getting in the online community using the link <https://discord.gg/CpU3htrDth>. Then I found that this is a new community where I can get access to an exclusive collection of 6969 Luchadores NTF´s.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XYzh3POzmLV8yDWq_9Ml-.png?height=596&width=757)\\n\\nYou can learn online a lot about the subject with good onboarding material that allows you to make your journey as easy as possible. The community is brand new, therefore my participation allows me to identify new material needed to guide me through the community, in such a way that I felt part of the building team.\\n\\nFor the regular user of any full blown apps that had been developed and tested. Getting involved in an early stage community implies that you are helping to debug and develop the experience. A situation that is very valuable for me is learning much more than the traditional tutorial that you execute as an automaton, without need to learn in depth.\\n\\nOnce I got engaged with the goal of the community around the access to get access to an exclusive collection. I ask what was the next step in the community. The goal for the weekend was to invite the first 200 members to participate in Crypto Luchas Club. A goal that may look simple when you run communities of thousands or hundred of thousand of people, but in this case the community was starting from some twenty participants.\\n\\nHow you invite people to learn about something that is relatively new as the NTF concept, to collect some digital images and learn how to do the handling of digital currency. Then you need to onboard people to learn about digital currency, wallets, some new ways to exchange currency and buy your first NTF using this new way of doing business.\\n\\nThen a roadmap needs to be developed and a set of steps need to be executed to achieve the goal of getting my first NTF.\\n\\nI started by registering in the community, validating my email address and activating the access to the community. Then I need to get my digital wallet for the Solana currency. In this case, the suggested wallet is the [Phantom Wallet](https://phantom.app/), an extension for the Google browser, that allows you to manage digital currencies and NTFs.\\n\\nThe next step is to get 0.10 of Solana, the easy way is to find a person in the community willing to make a donation to you. Otherwise you need to get into an exchange that allows you to buy some solanas,  like <https://www.coinbase.com/>.\\n\\nThen the way to find your first NTF is visiting sites like <https://magiceden.io/> where you can find NTFs from 0.10 Solana.\\n\\nEnjoy the exploration, get your first NTF and manage to sell it at a higher price. This is the experience of buying some art, hold it for a while and then selling it for a profit.\\n\\nI wish you a great experience and explore how to sell and buy NTFs. With some time you will be able to make some money while you explore this new world.\\n\\nMy personal experience to learn about Crypto Luchas Club was to discover how I can get NTFs. My next step is to learn how to create my own NTFs and share my digital assets to expand knowledge and experience to build communities.\\n\\nThanks to Felipe Servin, Adrian Puente and Angel Abrego for the feedback and comment provided to the original draft of this publication.\\n\\nReach out to jzavala on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mel_being).\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1641918473,\"title\":\"How to be part of a NTF world\"},\"digest\":\"pp-u4YrqbgS0zeC187jOAEKC2EzGvIEuHUye82IwIoo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3Eab59e123aa57c0F8e22CDe6F94942A481563e4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"YttucaTUUcd8AUhakPC7PTttPY8rGox2PY28S7DBLM8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"hBbYgtzxpqxSqUUDxac0t8lpn7OMrWoLOgz-oXT4M_s\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"_nXpuEm86CV416nNuRyWniNAEV9GjyBdS8viTe4FdqnS2LY0DbMyRyGkqc6EKlLu9baKsLGAD3J26ob8RVzP5g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x246f308f4e669cd0d2bdee0d5c97328491a04bdf3a700bc2c0862cbb03d8e32365e15e49f6420762b605439444f15af7a02dcc26a5d9f3603babcbb3a4f877b91b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"YttucaTUUcd8AUhakPC7PTttPY8rGox2PY28S7DBLM8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"hBbYgtzxpqxSqUUDxac0t8lpn7OMrWoLOgz-oXT4M_s\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"JzCVvGGY1ZKratDX8j_OUrKflVrNr4fekELa13VILx4\"}"
