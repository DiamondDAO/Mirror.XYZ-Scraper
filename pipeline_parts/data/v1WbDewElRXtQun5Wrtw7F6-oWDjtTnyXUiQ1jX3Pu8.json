"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Author**: Pablo (pekshowman#0123), 0xAA (0xAA#2040), Matter (MatterTurbulent#5161)\\n\\n**Good day, PEOPLE,**\\n\\nAs many of you may be aware, the People DAO is on track to establish a fully functional Treasury and improve our governance structure, one of the important tools we identified is Gnosis Safe Multisig. As the name implies, the Multisig is designed to safeguard our common assets by implementing a multi-signer/holder system, therefore reducing the risk of treasury integrity issues.\\n\\nTo meet this end, we are going to elect 9 (NINE) Multisig Signers through a democratic process starting on this Discord server, here are the criterion:\\n\\n1. A Multisig Signer shall be able to comprehend and use the basic functions in the Gnosis Safe Multisig to sign and approve transactions.\\n2. A Multisig Signer shall be able to dedicate a reasonable amount of time to fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the role, these mainly include: participating in necessary meetings, verifying and signing transactions based on democratic resolutions of People DAO.\\n3. A Multisig Signer shall exercise due diligence to safeguard his/her own key through any reasonable means. Although the Multisig is designed to protect assets even in case of compromises on parts of the signers, each signer still needs to act responsibly.\\n4. Outside Candidates (those not originally from the People DAO) who are People Token holders are welcomed, provided they act in good faith and are able to fulfill the above-mentioned requirements.\\n5. Each final multisig signer will get 1,000 $PEOPLE per month to compensate for their effort.\\n6. The term of multisig signers is 1 Year. We will re-elect multisig signers in 2023.01.01. New multisig signers can be added to existing ones through proposal and voting on snapshot anytime.\\n\\n### Election Method and Timeline:\\n\\nhe Election will start from our Discord server by SELF NOMINATION in Multisig-Election Channel, then DAO members may select candidates by REACTING WITH EMOJI ‚Äúraised_hands‚Äùüôå , finally, 30 shortlisted candidates based on the collected emojis will be put to a final SNAPSHOT VOTE, the TOP 9 Candidates will be our Multisig Signers.\\n\\nJan 10 2022 \\\\~ Jan 15 2022: Self Nomination and Emoji reaction collections. Ôºàdeadline UTC 23:59, Jan 15 2022)\\nJan 16: Statistics on shortlisted candidates and BOT eradication.\\nJan 17 2022 \\\\~ Jan 22 2022: SNAPSHOT voting period (deadline UTC 23:59, Jan 22 2022)\\nJan 22\\\\~: 9 Multisig signers elected.\\n\\n### Rules:\\n\\n1. Prospective Candidates self-nominate by posting a concise self-introduction and reasons to join the race.\\n2. DAO members should vote honestly and for the benefit of the DAO.\\n3. Please be fair, do not use BOTs and hire outside influences to rig this fair election. The DAO will conduct an audit to filter bots and invalid votes, results will be posted for everyone.\\n4. By joining the Election, you agree to the all terms above.\\n\\nThank you for your participation in the People DAO, a bold and bright journey lies before us!\\n\\n## Introduction to our candidates (ordered by the number of votes they received)\\n\\nWe suggest candidates answer the following questions when introducing themselves:\\n\\n1. `What should we call you?`\\n2. `Where are you coming from?`\\n3. `How are you related to $PEOPLE and PeopleDAO?`\\n4. `Why are you participating PeopleDAO multisig election?`\\n5. `Do you want to verify your identity?`\\n6. `Do you know how to use the Gnosis Safe wallet?`\\n7. `Do you have enough time devoted to PeopleDAO and how can we reach you when a transaction needs to be signed?`\\n\\n### 1 0xAA#2040\\n\\n1. 0xAA\\n2. Beijing, China\\n3. I am a donator to ConstitutionDAO and witnessed the failed auction and the original team departed. I think people are not over yet, and became a core contribution to PeopleDAO. I have contributed in hosting of weekly twitter space, managing the discord community and Twitter account @The_PeopleDAO, official website, several PeopleDAO Improvement Proposal, and AMA in Binance and OKEx communities.\\n4. I believe $PEOPLE is the most decentralized, fair-launched, and historical-significant token in the blockchain history. PeopleDAO is a meta DAO built upon $PEOPLE. Multisig wallet is important for PeopleDAO and I want to be part of the multisig holders and serve the PeopleDAO.\\n5. Yes, I can verify my identity. Actually I had a video AMA in Binance Live and Youtube channel. So I‚Äôm fully doxed.\\n6. Yes, I know how to use Gnosis Safe and wrote a tutorial on it.\\n7. I am a PhD candidate for now, and plan to spend plenty of time spent in PeopleDAO. I can be reached via discord, telegram, wechat, and email.\\n\\n### 2 MatterTurbulent#5161\\n\\n1. Matter\\n2. Boston, United States\\n3. I contributed to Constitution DAO and later joined the flurry of conversation following the failed auction. I've been a core contributor to People DAO since almost the beginning, helping run the Discord and remaining an active voice in the consensus process. I've worked on projects including the Founding Voter POAP, forthcoming website, and DAO role selection.\\n4. This DAO is cutting edge because it seeks to advance Web3 but also pioneer the metaDAO model. The governance token is unusual, a meme coin with an extremely fair launch and no one controlling its smart contract. Additionally, we are a multinational DAO and well-positioned to help make Web3 accessible to people across countries and languages. Lastly, over the past month and a half I've found new friendships and colleagues. I'm committed to giving back because I appreciate how the community tipped me and continues to give me the gift of their attention.\\n\\nTLDR; I'm drawn to innovation, promoting accessibility, and I feel a part of this community.\\n\\n1. I'll verify my identity through a trusted third party but not to the general community. My day job is in US municipal government. Right now I'm not interested in blurring the boundaries between my two public lives, IRL and Web3.\\n2. I've done a pilot Gnosis Safe wallet, navigating the interface and adding my wallet, but I haven't signed anything yet.\\n3. I work full-time and will be doing two college courses and then graduating this spring. But I've managed to be a daily contributor and active member despite these obligations over the past months. I can be reached via Twitter, Telegram, and Discord.\\n\\n### 3 PandaDAO#1430\\n\\n1. Hello, I'm Arthur.\\n\\n2,3,4) Im from China, and my major is cybersecurity and big data analysis, and I know some simple Python. Of course, I am also very good at server environment construction, including CDN building, server optimization, etc. Before I worked for some cyber intelligence agencies, then I became a media practitioner and blockchain tech researcher. Stayed in the U.S. for 3 years, South Korea for more than half a year, and currently in China.  All in all,  cyber security, data analysis and media are what I am the  best.  Growing with PeopleDAO is gonna be great for me.\\n\\n1. It's OK to verify my identity\\n2. Yes\\\\~\\n3. I quit my job, and all in DAO all the time\\n\\n### 4 greenside.eth#8817\\n\\nHello PeopleDAO, my name is Nick, but Greenside is fine. I am an original contributor to ConstitutionDAO and I currently serve as PeopleDAO's design team lead. Previously I have helped bring PeopleDAO POAPs to life. I hope to bring future value to PeopleDAO by creating NFTs and collectibles of many types. I am coming to you from the beautiful mountains of New Mexico, USA. I am running for two reasons. The first is ensure multisig holders are DAO contributors. The second is that I am privileged enough to have the time to devote to the role. If PeopleDAO finds a verification service, I will be happy to verify my identity. The responsibility of a keyholder is serious and I will use all possible security measures available to keep funds safe. I have prepared by demoing Gnosis Safe and reading their documentation. Please join me in supporting my fellow candidates who have shown great contribution in these early days.\\n\\n### 5 pekshowman#0123\\n\\n1. I am Pablo, you may also call me Showman123, I‚Äôm an attorney licensed in IL, United States. I worked as government prosecutor for a major municipality and as an energy project associate in the past. I now run a small business and occasionally conduct policy research for friend‚Äôs firm.\\n   I enjoy exploring all things novel and fun.\\n2. I was born in Beijing, currently based in Tokyo, Japan. I split my time between Tokyo and Chicago. (Yes, even in pandemic)\\n3. I was a donor to the then Constitution DAO, I found the idea of pooling group efforts to preserve a piece of iconic history groundbreaking. I was originally attracted to this effort for the sake of the actual Constitution, I wanted to be part of the journey. The design and distribution of $PEOPLE is one of the fairest things in crypto and in real life, if not the most. There are numerous forks since the dissolution of CDAO, People DAO is the one that stood out and carried on the wider mission: from the People, for the People.\\n4. I love the fact that PDAO is inclusive and supportive regardless of your background. I‚Äôve been involved in the drafting of our proposed mini DAO constitution (PIP3) and this election rules, I‚Äôd be happy to contribute to the non-coding aspects whenever possible. A multifaceted DAO brings endless possibilities.\\n5. I agree to fully verify my identity through any trusted THIRD PARTY service, crypto world is a wild place, I intend to maintain the boundary between my IRL and the general community for the time being.\\n6. Yes, I understand how to use Gnosis Safe and have read the official documents.\\n7. I will make time to perform all necessary tasks to sign and approve transactions.\\n\\n### 6 OKEX\\n\\n1. What should we call you?\\n   OKEx\\n2. Where are you coming from?\\n   I am from Seychelles.\\n3. How are you related to $PEOPLE and PeopleDAO?\\n   OKEx has been following $PEOPLE from the very beginning when ConsititutionDAO was created.  We listed $PEOPLE  as the first crypto exchange, and even owned more than 40% $PEOPLE total supply at peak level.  Meanwhile, when we learned $PEOPLE holders would build PeopleDAO, we took part in many PeopleDAO events and weekly meetings to see all the $PEOPLE related development: team building,goal discussion, treasury management, cross-chain execution etc. We are deeply involved with $PEOPLE and PeopleDAO.\\n4. Why are you participating PeopleDAO multisig election?\\n   Contribution. We understand that it is no easy to build a meta DAO and we do believe PeopleDAO has the ability and courage to make this great journey, so we hope to be a part of it - like what a brick does to the Chinese Great Wall.  Being a PeopleDAO multisigner, OKEx can continue to serve the $PEOPLE holders as we always do.\\n5. Do you want to verify your identity?\\n   No problem.\\n6. Do you know how to use the Gnosis Safe wallet?\\n   Definitely.\\n7. Do you have enough time devoted to PeopleDAO and how can we reach you when a transaction needs to be signed?\\n   Undoubtedly.  We will always be there 7/24 for PeopleDAO and can be reached any time when a transaction needs to be signed. This week we just did an open AMA with PeopleDAO to introduce it to our users. We will continue to devote our time and resources to help grow $PEOPLE and PeopleDAO.\\n\\n### 7 BruceAU#6229\\n\\n1. What should we call you?\\n   Bruce. I‚Äôm a lawyer qualified and practicing law in two jurisdictions: Australia and China.\\n2. Where are you coming from?\\n   Most of time I base in Sydney Australia.\\n3. How are you related to $PEOPLE and PeopleDAO?\\n   Some friends talked about $PEOPLE and DAO via Wechat group. I was immediately attracted by its concept. It is a wonderful social experiment: although it is about money/investment, it is definitely beyond money! Based on the concept of DAO, amazing things maybe happened and could be happened here!\\n4. Why are you participating PeopleDAO multisig election?\\n   People and DAO have nature connection. Many communities, such as Dayu Community,  develop rapidly, which are putting the DAO concept into practice and make it brighter and brighter, even they do NOT call themselves DAOs. As a member of Dayu Community, I participate in this election, which, in some sense, could make PeopleDAO be the DAO of every DAO community.\\n   BTW, now I'm trying to amend the mini DAO constitution (PIP3) drafted by PabloPena and MatterTurburrent.\\n5. Do you want to verify your identity?\\n   Yes. As I have already done at the beginning.\\n6. Do you know how to use the Gnosis Safe wallet?\\n   Not yet. But I don‚Äôt think it will be a problem. Too many new things appear in the Blockchain Area, just to be modest and keep learning, then problems will be solved.\\n7. Do you have enough time devoted to PeopleDAO and how can we reach you when a transaction needs to be signed?\\n\\n   I'm good at time management and I will save my time in advance for the possible transaction(s).\\n\\n### 8 Ran#1354\\n\\n1. What should we call you?\\n   Ran\\n2. Where are you coming from?\\n   Beijing, China\\n3. How are you related to $PEOPLE and PeopleDAO?\\n   PEOPLE was the first cryptocurrency I ever bought. I think I was lucky. Although I didn't participate in the donation, my buy-in was also relatively early. For me personally, PEOPLE is also monumental, symbolizing the beginning of my devotion to cryptocurrency for the next decade. I am very confident in PEOPLE and I am a diamond hand.  I am a backend tech lead working in Top5 internet company in China, I think I have a relatively strong learning ability, mathematical and logical ability.\\n4.

My participation in the election is to gain firsthand experience of DAO governance and I wish to contribute to the space and believe PeopleDAO will be worth my time and holds invaluable insights for myself.
