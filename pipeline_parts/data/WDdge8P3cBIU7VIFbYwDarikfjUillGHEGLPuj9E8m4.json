We will establish a Discord channel for holders to swap slots based on their time preferences.**\\n* **Regardless of the time of your minting slot, we strongly encourage you to be present for the Friday and Sunday dinners.**\\n\\n### \\n\\n**AARON PENNE**: RITUALS enables collectors to connect with their artwork in a meaningful way at the moment of its creation. Each output of this project gives a distinct window into the same parametric universe, a reminder that each of us are unique while fundamentally the same. The visuals and music are carefully constructed to weave an infinitely shifting experience, permanently etched into the blockchain.\\n\\n**BORETA**:  I have been creating generative ambient music for psychedelic therapy and meditation over the last few years. Aaron’s visual world enchanted me immediately. Just like the music; it’s calm, expansive, and immersive. There is an ineffable overlap in our creative worlds. I have been touring around the world playing live music for over a decade, and I have great reverence for the power of ritual to something larger than ourselves.\\n\\n**SCHEDULE**:\\n\\n* ***Before***:  Friday, Sep 24, 4pm PT: Prior to minting, we will host a late afternoon meal on the Windward Ave patio for the 200 holders of GTRV.  Everybody will have a name tag that displays which slot they will be minting (ie #1 is Friday 6pm… #100 Saturday 3am… #200 Sunday 7:45pm, etc…). Food by Travis Lett (Gjusta, Gjelina, MTN), music by Carlos Niño.\\n* ***During***: Friday, Sep 24, 5p - Sunday, Sep 26, 7pm PT Continuous series of 200, 15-minute live minting experiences.  During each session, visitors will have an intimate, meditative opportunity to relax, set their intention and generate a unique audio / visual experience that is revealed to them in the gallery, and which they will collect an ArtBlocks NFT in their ETH wallet. There will be tea and fruit available for visitors in the gallery, and light food and drinks for visitors and their guests on the patio.\\n* ***After***: Sunday, Sep 26, 7pm PT Upon the final mint, we will reconvene on the Windward patio, having all experienced RITUALS in the gallery, and all of us  changed somehow by it.  We will also experience the 800 online RITUALS being minted in real time by others online across the world. Food by Travis Lett (Gjusta, Gjelina, MTN), music by Carlos Niño.\\n\\n*Note on Group Rituals:  for groups of four who wish to pool 4 GTRV and share their Ritual experiences over the course of an hour, we will help you pool your minting slots, and the four NFTs that you each generate, into a single contract that is fractionalized four ways ([along lines of PartyBid](https://www.partybid.app/about)).*\",\"timestamp\":1630191100,\"title\":\"RITUALS\",\"publication\":\"brightmoments\"},\"digest\":\"_ombi4oh30WBoVDY3h5KIApLOY-OaruC5F79P4FWM9c\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x467aadC88d99B4E978A8d3d4f0A9017DCAECaAbF\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"F_PqZwkzDGin0fIYdwWDRQC1F48KraCEnyC8JKQyldw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"unMNQQvdQH0eMrN_6auQOBFOp_2IM7wEUnhyJblXJPM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"TQUrflEqasvBtlXCdg4geG9hXUUhHzi1iE2plr-HxlHh8-u1aVQO6ei7G_4sbiab0zxYtpJ9rKy-TaJQkKxbkw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1105fecca7c9d1227ca89eaa04304bd52b8a6fda12151e07ff440846d1344a8a5b7a2c62ed4843d5ad9ee53a9218f0f029bb926fa5a49ae12de7c10564ec5b191c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on brightmoments.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"F_PqZwkzDGin0fIYdwWDRQC1F48KraCEnyC8JKQyldw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"unMNQQvdQH0eMrN_6auQOBFOp_2IM7wEUnhyJblXJPM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"G13gPtKyusEoZi02vYw2-71iIuHG7O4ieNxQMntDrG4\"}"
