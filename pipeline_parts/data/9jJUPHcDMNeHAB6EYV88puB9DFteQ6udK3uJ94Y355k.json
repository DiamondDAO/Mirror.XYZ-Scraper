"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"With a ring on your finger you could have pawned for ten guineas!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Pawn my ring! My father gave it me.\\\" She kissed it tenderly, yet, to Vizard, half defiantly.\\n\\n\\\"Pawning is not selling, goose!\\\" said he, getting angry.\\n\\n\\\"But I must have parted with it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you preferred to *starve?\\\"*\\n\\n\\\"I preferred to starve,\\\" said she, steadily.\\n\\nHe looked at her. Her eyes faced his. He muttered something, and walked away, three steps to hide unreasonable sympathy. He came back with a grand display of cheerfulness. \\\"Your mother will be here next month,\\\" said he, \\\"with money in both pockets. Meantime I wish you would let me have a finger in the pie--or, rather my sister. She is warm-hearted and enthusiastic; she shall call on you, if you will permit it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is she like you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not a bit. We are by different mothers. Hers was a Greek, and she is a beautiful, dark girl.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I admire beauty; but is she like you-- in--in--disposition?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lord! no; very superior. Not abominably clever like you, but absurdly good. You shall judge for yourself. Oblige me with your address.\\\"\\n\\nThe doctress wrote her address with a resigned air, as one who had found somebody she had to obey; and, as soon as he had got it, Vizard gave her a sort of nervous shake of the hand, and seemed almost in a hurry to get away from her. But this was his way.\\n\\nShe would have been amazed if she had seen his change of manner the moment he got among his own people.\\n\\nHe burst in on them, crying, \\\"There--the prayers of this congregation are requested for Harrington Vizard, saddled with a virago.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Saddled with a virago!\\\" screamed Fanny.\\n\\n\\\"Saddled with a--!\\\" sighed Zoe, faintly.\\n\\n\\\"Saddled with a virago FOR LIFE!\\\" shouted Vizard, with a loud defiance that seemed needless, since nobody was objecting violently to his being saddled.\\n\\n\\\"Look here!\\\" said he, descending all of a sudden to a meek, injured air, which, however, did not last very long, \\\"I was in the garden of Leicester Square, and a young lady turned faint. I observed it, and, instead of taking the hint and cutting, I offered assistance--off my guard, as usual. She declined. I persisted; proposed a glass of wine, or spirit. She declined, but at last let out she was starving.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\" cried Zoe.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Zoe--starving. A woman more learned, more scientific, more eloquent, more offensive to a fellow's vanity, than I ever saw, or even read of--a woman of *genius,* starving, like a genius and a ninny, with a ring on her finger worth thirty guineas. But my learned goose would not raise money on that, because it was her father's, and he is dead.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Poor thing!\\\" said Zoe, and her eyes glistened directly.\\n\\n\\\"It *is* hard, Zoe, isn't it? She is a physician--an able physician; has studied at Zurich and at Edinburgh, and in France, and has a French diploma; but must not practice in England, because we are behind the Continent in laws and civilization--so *she* says, confound her impudence, and my folly for becoming a woman's echo! But if I were to tell you her whole story, your blood would boil at the trickery, and dishonesty, and oppression of the trades-union which has driven this gifted creature to a foreign school for education; and, now that a foreign nation admits her ability and crowns her with honor, still she must not practice in this country, because she is a woman, and we are a nation of half-civilized men. That is *her* chat, you understand, not mine. We are not obliged to swallow all that; but, turn it how you will, here are learning, genius, and virtue starving. We must get her to accept a little money; that means, in her case, a little fire and food. Zoe, shall that woman go to bed hungry to-night?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, never!\\\" said Zoe, warmly. \\\"'Let me think. Offer her a *loan.\\\"*\\n\\n\\\"Well done; that is a good idea. Will *you* undertake it? She will be far more likely to accept. She is a bit of a prude and all, is my virago.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, dear, she will. Order the carriage. She shall not go to bed hungry-- nobody shall that you are interested in.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, after dinner will do.\\\"\\n\\nDinner was ordered immediately, and the brougham an hour after.\\n\\nAt dinner, Vizard gave them all the outline of the Edinburgh struggle, and the pros and cons; during which narrative his female hearers might have been observed to get cooler and cooler, till they reached the zero of perfect apathy. They listened in dead silence; but when Harrington had done, Fanny said aside to Zoe, \\\"It is all her own fault. What business have women to set up for doctors?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course not,\\\" said Zoe; \\\"only we must not say so. He indulges *us* in our whims.\\\"\\n\\nWarm partisan of immortal justice, when it was lucky enough to be backed by her affections, Miss Vizard rose directly after dinner, and, with a fine imitation of ardor, said she could lose no more time--she must go and put on her bonnet. \\\"You will come with me, Fanny?\\\"\\n\\nWhen I was a girl, or a boy--I forget which, it is so long ago--a young lady thus invited by an affectionate friend used to do one of two things; nine times out of ten she sacrificed her inclination, and went; the tenth, she would make sweet, engaging excuses, and beg off. But the girls of this day have invented \\\"silent volition.\\\" When you ask them to do anything they don't quite like, they look you in the face, bland but full, and neither speak nor move. Miss Dover was a proficient in this graceful form of refusal by dead silence, and resistance by placid inertia. She just looked like the full moon in Zoe's face, and never budged. Zoe, being also a girl of the day, needed no interpretation. \\\"Oh, very well,\\\" said she, \\\"disobliging thing!\\\"--with perfect good humor, mind you.\\n\\nVizard, however, was not pleased.\\n\\n\\\"You go with her, Ned,\\\" said he. \\\"Miss Dover prefers to stay and smoke a cigar with me.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Dover's face reddened, but she never budged. And it ended in Zoe taking Severne with her to call on Rhoda Gale.\\n\\nRhoda Gale stayed in the garden till sunset, and then went to her lodgings slowly, for they had no attraction--a dark room; no supper; a hard landlady, half disposed to turn her out.\\n\\nDr. Rhoda Gale never reflected much in the streets; they were to her a field of minute observation; but, when she got home she sat down and thought over what she had been saying and doing, and puzzled over the character of the man who had relieved her hunger and elicited her autobiography. She passed him in review; settled in her mind that he was a strong character; a manly man, who did not waste words; wondered a little at the way he had made her do whatever he pleased; blushed a little at the thought of having been so communicative; yet admired the man for having drawn her out so; and wondered whether she should see him again. She hoped she should. But she did not feel sure.\\n\\nShe sat half an hour thus--with one knee raised a little, and her hands interlaced--by a fire-place with a burned-out coal in it; and by-and-by she felt hungry again. But she had no food, and no money.\\n\\nShe looked hard at her ring, and profited a little by contact with the sturdy good sense of Vizard.\\n\\nShe said to herself, \\\"Men understand one another. I believe father would be angry with me for not.\\\"\\n\\nThen she looked tenderly and wistfully at the ring, and kissed it, and murmured, \\\"Not to-night.\\\" You see she hoped she might have a letter in the morning, and so respite her ring.\\n\\nThen she made light of it, and said to herself, \\\"No matter; 'qui dort, dine.' \\\"\\n\\nBut as it was early for bed, and she could not be long idle, sipping no knowledge, she took up the last good German work that she had bought when she had money, and proceeded to read. She had no candle, but she had a lucifer-match or two, and an old newspaper. With this she made long spills, and lighted one, and read two pages by that paper torch, and lighted another before it was out, and then another, and so on in succession, fighting for knowledge against poverty, as she had fought for it against perfidy.\\n\\nWhile she was thus absorbed, a carriage drew up at the door. She took no notice of that; but presently there was a rustling of silk on the stairs, and two voices, and then a tap at the door. \\\"Come in,\\\" said she; and Zoe entered just as the last spill burned out.\\n\\nRhoda Gale rose in a dark room; but a gas-light over the way just showed her figure. \\\"Miss Gale?\\\" said Zoe, timidly.\\n\\n\\\"I am Miss Gale,\\\" said Rhoda, quietly, but firmly.\\n\\n\\\"I am Miss Vizard--the gentleman's sister that you met in Leicester Square to-day;\\\" and she took a cautious step toward her.\\n\\nRhoda's cheeks burned.\\n\\n\\\"Miss Vizard,\\\" she said, \\\"excuse my receiving you so; but you may have heard I am very poor. My last candle is gone. But perhaps the landlady would lend me one. I don't know. She is very disobliging, and very cruel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then she shall not have the honor of lending you a candle,\\\" said Zoe, with one of her gushes. \\\"Now, to tell the truth,\\\" said she, altering to the cheerful, \\\"I'm rather glad. I would rather talk to you in the dark for a little, just at first. May I?\\\" By this time she had gradually crept up to Rhoda.\\n\\n\\\"I am afraid you *must,\\\"* said Rhoda. \\\"But at least I can offer you a seat.\\\"\\n\\nZoe sat down, and there was an awkward silence.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, dear,\\\" said Zoe; \\\"I don't know how to begin. I wish you would give me your hand, as I can't see your face.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"With all my heart: there.\\\"\\n\\n(Almost in a whisper) \\\"He has told me.\\\"\\n\\nRhoda put the other hand to her face, though it was so dark.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Miss Gale, how *could* you? Only think! Suppose you had killed yourself, or made yourself very ill. Your mother would have come directly and found you so; and only think how unhappy you would have made her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Can I have forgotten my mother?\\\" asked Rhoda of herself, but aloud.\\n\\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/332](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/332)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637669751,\"title\":\"She handed me a few shillings, by way of balance.
