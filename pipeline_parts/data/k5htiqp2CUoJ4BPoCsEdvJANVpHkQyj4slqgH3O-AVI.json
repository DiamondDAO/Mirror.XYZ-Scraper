"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"We briefly explore some of the core components of a cryptocurrency network\\n\\n## Identity and transactions\\n\\nThere is no registration gate keeper who will approve your application before you can join the network. It is a global and permissionless network. Anyone can join and participate.\\n\\n**How do I join?** You can have one identity, or several identities. You can generate a new identity locally on your computer without the assistance of anyone else. Your pseudonymous identity relies on public-key cryptography.\\n\\n* **Private key (d).** You can generate a cryptographic random number.\\n* **Public key (P).** Your public key which can be shared with others and acts as your identity.\\n\\nAs the name suggests, the private key should be kept private and the public key can be shared with others. The relationship is a very simple formula:\\n\\n`dG = P (ignoring the modulo operations)`\\n\\nThe security relies on something called the [discrete log problem](https://Discrete_logarithm).\\n\\n* Given only P and G, it is computationally infeasible to compute d.\\n\\nThis is why it is safe to share the public key P and you can compute as many public keys (identities) as you want on the network.\\n\\n**Why do we use the name *Bitcoin Address* or *Ethereum Account*?** In both cases, they are really just public keys that have been transformed via a cryptographic hash function.\\n\\n> We will use public key / address / account interchangeably throughout the course.\\n\\n**Why do we need public and private keys? What is their significance?** Thanks to public key cryptography, you can perform digital signatures.\\n\\nsuch that anyone can verify the public key who signed it\\n\\n**OK. I have an identity, but how do I interact with the network?** Letâ€™s assume you already have a positive balance on the network.\\n\\n## Gossip protocol and leader election\\n\\nLongest and heaviest chain (eventual consistency)\\n\\n* **Identity and transactions.** How do I join the network?\\n* **Gossip protocol.**  How do others discover my transaction?\\n* **Leader election.** Who has the authority to update the global and replicated database?\\n* **Eventual consistency.** Why transactions can be confirmed, reversed, and re-confirmed.\\n\\nAs we will see, the combination of distributed system engineering, cryptography, and financial incentives allow for a global and rule-based network to thrive. It is permissionless for anyone to participate in the network\",\"timestamp\":1640961110,\"title\":\"How does everything tie together?\"},\"digest\":\"iwMGWMNYmdd-4M95rDiFcX0IkyUCme97fEKgVrfI1tU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HD9RP6Vu2qScyERjXSOXQVQIRxmBCXvIAKLRex0PqNM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mgbP3VVpw2XM19i2UeOg22K4TCs_hU0YEjYwwG9rQpE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"vwBLEq-qa8CJ-s1FlHt9y4UJOC2pvBvcg3eHMMKtWMvZP13fwxHl7jSA1prxQ5QvrZNbxp8YQYcMoZ604_sNBQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x51f23e6c7715863a212b539ae5cdb285e7af2673df5ad9dc1ff9fa48271b4c5342c2c42bd697bd611940d1c1a87a0a10a964957b02004d8de9ccf9e794fba8131b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HD9RP6Vu2qScyERjXSOXQVQIRxmBCXvIAKLRex0PqNM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mgbP3VVpw2XM19i2UeOg22K4TCs_hU0YEjYwwG9rQpE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"iwMGWMNYmdd-4M95rDiFcX0IkyUCme97fEKgVrfI1tU\"}"
