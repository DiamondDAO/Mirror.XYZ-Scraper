People in power can also pay platforms to remove content that are against them.\\n\\nThrough NFTs, we are able to preserve history in a way that no one can alter what has been published. We can also trace who made which kind of media because these kinds of records come with the NFT. If ever these posters are downloaded and altered, there is a record showing that I am the person who made the original poster.\\n\\n### You may see the NFTs on OpenSea\\n\\n34,000 people tortured\\n\\n[https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x8a13628dd5d600ca1e8bf9dbc685b735f615cb90/2802](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x8a13628dd5d600ca1e8bf9dbc685b735f615cb90/2802)\\n\\n70,000 people arrested\\n\\n[https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x8a13628dd5d600ca1e8bf9dbc685b735f615cb90/2941](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x8a13628dd5d600ca1e8bf9dbc685b735f615cb90/2941)\\n\\n3,240 people killed\\n\\n[https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x8a13628dd5d600ca1e8bf9dbc685b735f615cb90/3216](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x8a13628dd5d600ca1e8bf9dbc685b735f615cb90/3216)\\n\\n*The NFTs are also visible on my [Showtime profile](https://tryshowtime.com/gianferrer).*\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n24/25 editions are now on sale on OpenSea through the Polygon network, where minting and buying NFTs are made even more accessible (with gas fees going around $0.0001).\\n\\n1/25 is kept with me to ensure that even if the 24 editions are *burned*, there is still one that will live on.\\n\\nWhile these are being sold, there are no financial gains to be expected here for anyone who buys the NFTs. This project was made to be a way to preserve history (minting the NFT), and to spread it around the internet (hence, the editions). A 15% Creator Share was also set in case any of the editions are resold.\\n\\nI expect buyers to be guardians of our history.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nSome resources for you to **#NeverForget**\\n\\n* [Martial Law Museum](https://martiallawmuseum.ph/)\\n* [Fast Facts](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1167808/fast-facts-the-marcos-martial-law-regime) - Philippine Daily Inquirer\\n* [Childrenâ€™s books](https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/books-and-art/these-childrens-books-depict-the-realities-of-martial-law-a1628-20170924) - Esquire\\n* [Movies and documentaries](https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/list-films-about-martial-law-human-rights-abuses) - Rappler\\n\\n*Note: These NFTs and this post are NOT in partnership with any institutions.*\",\"timestamp\":1632398652,\"title\":\"NFTs as a way to combat historical revisionism\",\"publication\":\"gianferrer\"},\"digest\":\"0DRBj8soqH3gjlno3hUaB-ovNAHg0ws2wA-AEoAEy7Q\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2bD5d2e3d5852AD9960638083cb7c9F493E7A597\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"P_DwdgSfsOMtg8DdHcSH5htY4tyEco-gIE1kTRPhZjQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"lYlKLJSs6UVQiJPBE7nm_cO-7QLhNSGWtGTY7_m81RI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"W8mBo0q8Yzf3yWH8N5hhz5ryFJtJ9A7xiUYatSo9tn8cLJns2hovs2xPwm0AzjUdDuIl6tVEh1AevWBG9H5lmQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe97bb86cbfddc1fea67b5bedb54f98d32b12c8615c47dca22b1d18770e57d2cb6878bfa2ea871755c09458c6ca0181c26c21a514f0fbf077f8956dd0010080151b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on gianferrer.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"P_DwdgSfsOMtg8DdHcSH5htY4tyEco-gIE1kTRPhZjQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"lYlKLJSs6UVQiJPBE7nm_cO-7QLhNSGWtGTY7_m81RI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jX5eg-xjdLVotVLalwyqSH7mVsktwcIpQOpYC1GlFsU\"}"
