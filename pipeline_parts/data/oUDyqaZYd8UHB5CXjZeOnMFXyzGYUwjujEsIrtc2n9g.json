"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Greetings and welcome to A Small Field of Vision #1.\\n\\nThere are few different topics as polarising as crypto-talk these days.\\n\\nAlthough Internet has always been a confirmation bias cesspool brewing simultaneously in multiple echo chambers, crypto talk lately has been more divisive than a Russian State broadcaster!. On one side the universally hated crypto-chad-bros WAGMI each other at the back everyday while loudly proclaiming the end of **states, banks** *or* any societal institution that ***genuinely needs to change*** and on the other side mid wit “[right click savers](https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dgzed/what-the-hell-is-right-clicker-mentality)” tend to minimise all technological changes and future capabilities to self-servingly proclaim ***everything is a scam***.\\n\\nThe truth -as always- lies somewhere in between.\\n\\n> Whenever a new technology bubble emerges, the end result is always name-calling. A bifurcation of belief usually occurs as people are dazzled by the latest shiny object. For the zealots, incentivized to see the bubble grow ever larger, they will call the uninitiated “normies, haters, skeptics, losers, closed-minded” etc. For those who are too late to the trend to achieve the truly ridiculous returns of early adopters, the next most financially lucrative option is to do as Michael Jordan did, and join the dunk industry. “Bernie Madoff! Tulip bulb 2.0! Pyramid scheme! Charlatans!” \\\\[[NFT Projects are just MLMs for Tech Elites](https://every.to/napkin-math/nft-projects-are-just-mlms-for-tech-elites?utm_source=pocket_mylist&vero_conv=XPFxn8fcdsW9ME5tXy3mfTOPRlzecd8-x8Ctt_kLWF0GK0mIj7JVNrCLq4D4BBRad55dCpIBHS0Bu34RNUTV0rVZKabnpaYFvA%3D%3D)\\\\]\\n\\nFirst, ***to declare my position:***\\n\\nI have been a Bitcoin and Ethereum holder since 2013 and 2017 respectively and have been inspecting every shiny new protocol since the start of the pandemic.\\n\\nThis sporadic newsletter will include notes from my readings while trying to map this new frontier and hopefully these fragmented notes will turn into a coherent narrative by the end. The idea is to shine a light on intellectually stimulating cases without preaching to the choir. And the aim is to ***not*** have lambo talk, the hot new NFT PFP, million% APY Ponzis.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nTremendous amount of brain power is spent on R&D lately and developments have been converging at light speed.\\n\\n[Work on web3](https://www.exponentialview.co/is-three-the-magic-number/), [interoperability](https://ff.mirror.xyz/3FKwvkwAPltEdhe4pWnL8RX7TNruwNNZcFAqNn92tUs), [composability](https://twitter.com/0xJim/status/1470091328188928001), restoration of the open internet, the idea of [DAOs (Decentralised Autonomous Organisations) as a new form of human collaboration](https://twitter.com/theryanking/status/1461499776919392258), NFTs as a built-in authentication layer to artistic endeavour etc. are rousing ideals and with nonstop tech research by devs (Ethereum as a [data availability engine](https://trentv.medium.com/transcript-scalable-blockchains-as-data-layers-vitalik-buterin-11aa18b37e07), [zero knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof), [sharding](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html) etc.) I believe many of these will come to fruition quicker than naysayers can realise.\\n\\nYet back in the beginning of the 2000’s a similar techno-optimistic narrative called the web2.0 was subverted by corpos in the blink of an eye; giving us, post-truth, anti-vaxxers, super low attention spans and the total loss of consensus on reality. All emerging from web2.0’s brave ideals for democracy, open internet and social media. We’ve witnessed first hand how these ideals can be subjugated and corrupted by corpos/states/big money or unintended consequences occur.

I think the World Wide Web was the real rupture — “Where … is the money?”—which Web 2.0 smoothed over and Web3 now attempts to seal totally.\\n\\nWe are seeing examples of how cryptocurrencies might indeed be the missing [native economic layer](https://www.exponentialview.co/is-three-the-magic-number/) of the internet in art & gaming (play 2 earn) communities, finally decoupling monetary compensation from ads which frankly was never the best solution to a digital world, and in turn has completely failed us.\\n\\nCritics aren’t fazed however, because this financialization can turn society into “[a reflexive ADHD over-financialized dystopia with even more wealth concentration and a bunch of dopamine chasing plebs](https://mobile.twitter.com/poordart/status/1450742921838280710)” - human click farmers with nothing better to do in a ruined world with jobs overtaken by AI and robots, living on some kind of subsistence mode in a virtual world - just as many sci-fi works have predicted.\\n\\nThis polarisation is fueling a partisanship among users and talking heads on both ends sure know how to create fanatics out of normies.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nSo as to start some kind of healthy discussion, I'll start with a quick recap of both the criticism and the changes on the past year.\\n\\n*The community is diversifying:* It is true that the crypto space has been a subset of the broader tech space in general, and is dominated by the [white male lambo boys](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fLJvPOvibcCUpJ9ES44_cdoX5Hb7LpDaloGWz5FbUEM/edit#slide=id.ged448f070e_4_374).

This is exciting to the point of mania-inducing, which is what makes it feel simultaneously hopeful and dangerous. It’s also what creates a financial bubble, which for the obvious reasons is dramatically exacerbated in the case of NFTs. \\\\[[Using the technology as a tool](https://usually.mirror.xyz/mEoh4x8-1kDTsca-IhRIR9vygFI_vnNy0NHWTzYGF6U)\\\\]\\n\\nIssues of collective ownership and the importance of being able to [reap the fruits of one’s creative labor are taking the front seat](https://www.vice.com/en/article/dypzbq/surprise-the-future-of-media-involves-a-crypto-based-popularity-contest-mirror), and finally even [crypto peeps are now coming to terms](https://twitter.com/bigdsenpai/status/1466674364842221570) with the fact that, the summer where everyone made copycat animal profile pictures were [cash grabs](https://twitter.com/dcfgod/status/1466677493004320770) and has taken its toll on NFTs.\\n\\n> It is important to note here that we think that NFTs as a technology hold incredible promise to help more evenly distribute financial outcomes to community users, not just community organizers.

Yet notable intellectual publications like [Archdaily](https://www.archdaily.com/968905/architecting-the-metaverse) and [Jacobin](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/09/facebook-zuckerberg-metaverse-stephenson-big-tech) are some of the institutions that seriously begin to ponder about the future of metaverses.\\n\\n> If the Metaverse can’t be separated from real life, then the Metaverse *is* real life, to the point where the term “Metaverse” itself eventually fades away and the constructed reality is rendered invisible. Consider how capitalism became something like the West’s version of Windows, an operating system quietly running in the background in the neoliberal era.
