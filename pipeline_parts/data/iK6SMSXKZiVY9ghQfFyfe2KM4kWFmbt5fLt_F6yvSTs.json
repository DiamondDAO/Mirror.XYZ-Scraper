If you see this screen, you will be able to buy the $TICKET tokens once the whitelist round starts.\\n\\n1. If your USDC balance is below 50, you will not be able to buy $TICKET as the minimum allocation per wallet is $50 USDC ‚Äî hence the screen will look like this:\\n2. If you see something like this, unfortunately, you are not eligible for the whitelist ‚Äî sorry.\\n3. Once the whitelist round starts, you should be able to see the screen below. If your address is whitelisted you can/should buy $TICKET tokens before anyone else.\\n   Make sure you have enough USDC in your Solana based wallet to make the transaction. The maximum allocation per wallet is capped at $1,000 USDC. There are a total of 1,000,000,000 TICKET tokens available (12,5% of the supply) for this round priced at $0.00125 USDC per TICKET.\\n   Airdrop Factor\\n   Our team reserved 100,000,000 tokens for the ones who will buy from the whitelist round. To make it fair and more fun, we simply formulated an equation.\\n   Let‚Äôs say you have $50 USDC.\\n   \\\\*If you select 25% of your balance;\\n   You will have 12.5/0.00125 = 10,000 tokens and\\n   10,000 x 0.25 x 0.0125 = 31.25 tokens will be airdropped\\n   and avg price will be 12.5/10,031.25 = 0.00124\\n   \\\\*If you select 50% of your balance;\\n   You will have 25/0.00125 = 20,000 tokens and\\n   20,000 x 0.5 x 0.025 = 250 tokens will be airdropped\\n   and avg price will be 25/20,250 = 0.00123\\n   \\\\*If you select 75% of your balance;\\n   You will have 37.5/0.00125 = 30,000 tokens and\\n   30,000 x 0.75 x 0.050 = 1,125 tokens will be airdropped\\n   and avg price will be 37.5/31,125 = 0.00120\\n   \\\\*If you select 100% of your balance;\\n   You will have 50/0.00125 = 40,000 tokens and\\n   40,000 x 1 x 0.075 = 3,000 tokens will be airdropped\\n   and avg price will be 50/43,000 = 0.00116\\n   The more you buy the better average price you get!\\n4. Select the % or just enter the amount (in USDC) for the number of $TICKET tokens you would like to buy.\\n5. Click on ‚ÄòBuy Ticket & Claim Airdrop‚Äô, approve the transaction in your wallet and you should see a screen like this:\\n6. You won‚Äôt be able to buy any more tokens if you have hit the maximum cap ($1,000 USDC worth of $TICKET tokens per wallet)\\n7. If you want to invest more than $1,000 please follow our social media channels for DEX and CEX listings.\\n   LP Staking & TICKET NFT\\n   As we mentioned at the beginning, $TICKET is built for you to get access to upcoming Tokens & NFTs before everyone else, hence, keeping your purchased TICKETs would be a better option rather than selling.\\n   We have aligned projects to announce after the whitelist round and they all look promising. Whilst you are waiting for the upcoming projects why don‚Äôt you;\\n   Hold and wait for staking options and\\n   Guarantee Allocation to save your seat\\n   TICKET NFT will be the very first ‚Äúutility-nft‚Äù that will give you guarantee allocation for the upcoming Token & NFT project launches. Make sure you have one of them.\\n\\nFinal Remarks\\nAs one of our whitelisted users pointed out, ‚Äú$TICKET is the Community First Launchpad‚Äù and we have been spreading it out ever since.\\nWe are here and dedicated to address the promising projects for our community and the ecosystem. As a go-to platform, we will help crypto enthusiasts to invest in a diversified approach in order to secure their future.\",\"timestamp\":1639971227,\"title\":\"It is time for the $TICKET IDO!\"},\"digest\":\"pCyoh0GAAq5RZOw7soRsObwH7divng8TTGqpY2SsDSE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3292ec720bc15450d6845b3093769D192065B9B5\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"E4tf8k58MSMQIJ5GjL0g3ZjqLABNvKJPOQo5IBEWq_0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JhPDI4nvd1DQiKEW0HxyU0n9TbTFE-Xrx6CZZfQYReE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ZjTd_CBVxCYYo6hVtBQ99MXGDuSWru-1rG6cMU_kra0H1jLFeEpepSoSBm0k5yUYkAd4HwRYY0Ti0TsPxrbK6g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x768db03d3dc7a47bce699c8ca6ff624d7238a57f1d99d66ad7055a3b2dc5d7cc7c33c2e7dbee4465267c41c7399acb42d98ed90634a534831e0ffe3b34eedb0e1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"E4tf8k58MSMQIJ5GjL0g3ZjqLABNvKJPOQo5IBEWq_0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JhPDI4nvd1DQiKEW0HxyU0n9TbTFE-Xrx6CZZfQYReE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"pCyoh0GAAq5RZOw7soRsObwH7divng8TTGqpY2SsDSE\"}"
