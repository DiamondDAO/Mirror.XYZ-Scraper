"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I’ve been increasingly fascinated by DAOs. I understood the concept a long time ago, but never really spent time thinking about the opportunities DAOs present.\\n\\nAnd as DAOs are playing an increasingly bigger part in the crypto industry, I wanted to write a short intro of DAOs to whoever might be reading this.\\n\\nTo start off, we should understand what a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) is.\\n\\nI found the best definition of a DAO from an article written by Brian Fakhoury at [Underscore blog](https://underscore.vc/blog/the-future-is-dao-a-primer-on-daos-and-their-explosive-growth/):\\n\\n*In summary: a DAO is created by a group of crypto wallets controlled by individuals and other organizations that executes all its movements through code, making it possible to manage assets and votes safely without the need for underlying legal or traditional banking setups. Membership in a DAO can be extremely fluid compared to what traditional organizations can achieve, and DAOs have been used to manage assets, build protocols, vote on community matters, and create niche factions for interests like digital art collecting.*\\n\\nWe can look at almost any group of people as an organization. There are formal and informal organizations, and depending on the nature of the group, some sort of governance is needed to organize the activities of the group.\\n\\nTraditionally, if you want to have any sort of governance for your organization, you’ll probably set up some sort of legal entity (a foundation, NGO, LLC, etc).\\n\\nAnd if you try to give voting rights and governance power to everybody in the group, it’s likely going to be an annoying (and lengthy) legal process to get everything sorted.\\n\\nNot to mention that some people contribute a lot more, but may still have just one vote within the legacy organization structure, like everyone else, including the ones who do not contribute at all.\\n\\nCreating a DAO is (and will be) easier, faster, cheaper, and more transparent than creating any kind of organization in our current legal framework. However, it is a general understanding (at the moment), that if there is no legal formation behind a DAO, it will be considered to be a general partnership (i.e all partners have full liability for the actions of the DAO).\\n\\nThe hope is that lawmakers will catch up with these internet-native organizations, and provide a better legal framework than the existing ones. [Wyoming is a good example of trying to do that.](https://www.coindesk.com/dao-wyoming-law-legal-decentralization)\\n\\nMost major DeFi projects have DAOs by now - Uniswap, Sushiswap, Maker, Synthetix, etc. Being able to be part of the governance (and earn fees doing that) is not a small feat when considering which projects to invest in. A **well-functioning** DAO provides (to some extent) certainty, that the project is managed in the best interest of the protocol and the community (token holders).\\n\\nBefore we look into the example of Index Coop, which seems to be one of the best-managed DAOs in existence, let’s recap why DAOs are good for:\\n\\n**Managing capital:**\\n\\n*   Funding projects that add value to the protocol & network (grants)\\n*   Rewarding contributions (pre-determined parameters, voting, etc)\\n*   Distributing capital (staking rewards, treasury, etc)\\n\\n**Coordinating community: **\\n\\n*   The importance and voice of the community is growing increasingly important ([read the Sushiswap funding thread here](https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushi-phantom-troupe-strategic-raise/4554)) in making strategic decisions\\n*   Helps to unite and inspire the community to work together for the common goal (with the power to participate in the governance, and not only to voice an opinion)\\n\\n## A good DAO example - Index Coop\\n\\nIndex Coop is a project that creates ETFs on the blockchain. The best-known indices they have are The Defi Pulse Index, Flexible Leverage Index, and the Metaverse Index.\\n\\nWhat makes Index Coop interesting is how they’ve structured the work. It’s possible for anyone who wants to contribute to fill out their onboarding form (and do the following orientation call) and work for Index.\\n\\nThere’s a slide deck that will give you a pretty good overview of Index Coop:\\n\\nGoing forward, Index Coop gives you different options to contribute depending on your time availability and life situation.\\n\\nIndex Coop has laid out the structure of the DAO on this slide, which is pretty amazing:\\n\\nAn overview of the working groups:\\n\\nIndex has managed to create clear guidelines and responsibilities in a decentralized organization. It’s not common with DAOs, as things can get chaotic pretty quickly.\\n\\nAlmost all projects try to create a non-hierarchical DAO structure, but a well-planned hierarchy is needed for the DAO to function. It’s just human nature.\\n\\nAs I’ve got plenty more to cover in this post, and considering Substack’s limitations, I recommend you to read the [DeFi Weekly breakdown of the Index Coop DAO. ](https://defiweekly.substack.com/p/understanding-index-coop-pt-1)I’ve used most of the examples here from their post.\\n\\n## How to create a DAO?\\n\\nI’ve never created a DAO myself, but after spending some time on research and observation, I’ll try to conclude my thoughts below.\\n\\nIt’s not easy to build an engaged community. It’s the trickiest part of creating a DAO. Before you start, you need to understand what would bring different people together to contribute to a common cause.\\n\\nAs a result, the first step would be writing down some questions that you need to understand and answer.\\n\\n*   Is there a big enough issue that’s not getting attention?\\n*   Do you have a special approach, knowledge and skill to solve this issue?\\n*   Who are your competitors and is there something they’re not getting right?\\n*   Are there more people who’re trying to solve this problem?\\n*   What kind of incentives would you need to bring these people together?\\n\\nI would say that if there’s a big enough problem that’s not being addressed, and you have like-minded people who’re interested in solving the problem together with you, it’s half of the battle.\\n\\nOnce you have the theoretical part done, it’s time to get technical. And luckily, by now, there is a number of tools that you can use to create a DAO.\\n\\nIt will be too much to write how-to’s for each tool and they have done it already far better than I ever could. Hence, I am choosing the path of least resistance without deep-diving into each solution.\\n\\nIn no particular order:\\n\\n1.  [xDAO](https://app.xdao.app/)\\n2.  [DAOstack](https://daostack.io/)\\n3.  [Aragon](https://aragon.org/)\\n4.  [DAOhaus](https://daohaus.club/)\\n5.  [Squads](https://www.buildyoursquad.xyz/) (built on Solana, beta)\\n\\n## Issuing Your Token\\n\\nOne of the critical questions you may still have is issuing the token for your DAO. Any mission needs funds to have a chance of success.\\n\\nTo raise funds, you need to set up the treasury infrastructure, the so-called bank account for collecting and storing tokens. After that, you need to distribute the DAO token (crowdfunding campaign) to the members of the DAO.\\n\\nThere are a variety of treasury platforms available. One popular option is [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/). They provide the necessary multi-signature feature (so no distribution is done by only one person holding the keys) for the distribution of funds, as well as the ability to store different tokens (for example, your DAO token and ETH).\\n\\nOnce you’re ready to raise funds, you need to make some key decisions about the token supply.\\n\\n1.  What will be the initial token supply?\\n2.  Is the supply fixed?\\n3.  The anchor exchange rate with ETH (f.e. 10000 $DAO per 1 ETH)\\n4.  How much of the supply will go to the treasury?\\n\\nPlatforms usually provide default settings for crowdfunding which will simplify the process quite a bit if you’re not completely sure that you’re not doing some monumental screw-up with the token issuance.\\n\\nHowever, it would be a lot better to consult with someone who understands the ins and outs of tokenomics before issuing your tokens.\\n\\nGoing forward, let’s say you’ve decided on the treasury allocation. What will be the purpose of the funds in the treasury? For example:\\n\\n*   Reward people who contribute to the DAO\\n*   Future crowdfunding campaigns\\n*   Airdrop to early contributors\\n*   Provide liquidity if needed (via Uniswap, etc)\\n*   Fund internal value-add projects\\n\\nWhile the above is important, the most challenging part for your crowdfunding campaign will be marketing and getting momentum.\\n\\nAttention is the new gold, as they say.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nSome VCs believe that DAOs present a trillion-dollar opportunity. Maybe. But even without adding a monetary label, it’s not hard to understand how big of a change DAOs can make to how businesses, capital, political organizations, and online communities are created and managed.\\n\\nIf the internet levelled the playing field, then DAOs will take it a big step further.\\n\\nEveryone is now able to participate in ownership and governance structures.\\n\\nAnd as it so often is in this space, the opportunities are endless.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1634718261,\"title\":\"A Look Into DAOs\"},\"digest\":\"GwkOoADo-axhMtDEkFRD4RLMIvXY0ch0m7HBcd84PvQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8129c94d2F2b18Fa4b63bD0A3B64EdE4823374AE\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"CfwhCWvLf6r3o-T8lSlWPgFNwjkeqx1Q8_8LBD8HDSM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mi_EEz8yDefnq47XV3y4da44gdicmMtifUegyvBTAcA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"uMqAEVCQsonwOlouO9rKYD1fbV95pwxxVdCG_xL2Vlh3Rr4tWwGQBzfzHruCoXBcyeXSQeQ3gUec4f9IDQtVSA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb79ad41dc3d2ca8708ade4b632076b5310bf520f33eeea9fe14c5f1ba5f877282276d403094aa1152a03df909daeed61011d1d7c934d3cf7d2e8daa8d89ccdbc1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"CfwhCWvLf6r3o-T8lSlWPgFNwjkeqx1Q8_8LBD8HDSM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mi_EEz8yDefnq47XV3y4da44gdicmMtifUegyvBTAcA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"GwkOoADo-axhMtDEkFRD4RLMIvXY0ch0m7HBcd84PvQ\"}"
