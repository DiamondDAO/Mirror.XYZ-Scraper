When we make assumptions, we state them. Otherwise, we presume that the future could unfold in many directions.\\n\\nWe methodically piece together plausible scenarios, step by step, using systems theory and applied mathematics. We compile our findings in detailed reports, and release them for small sums. We like to explore questions that have not been asked, including questions that are controversial, heterodox, or untoward:\\n\\n- How can we design a feasible incentive structure for carbon sequestration that reduces moral hazard?\\n- What might graph theory tell us about behavior on an entirely unindexed internet?\\n- Is the term “Blackrock Communism” the most accurate descriptor for America’s political economy?\\n\\n\\n\\nFeedback from our supporters is vital to the process. We imagine this as a new forum for future thought – research for the hive. Supporters can steer our inquiry by providing comments, asking questions, and creating financial incentives for us to explore topics that are valuable for the community. \\n\\nAt certain intervals we will publish print editions of the entire body of research. These will also include previously unreleased material. All supporters will receive a print edition, regardless of the size of their contribution.\\n\\nIf you're into Cope straight away, please support the first issue of our service. We've set a goal in anticipation of ongoing engagement with the distributed community of supporters. For more details about the material, methods, and schedule keep reading below.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Cope #01](crowdfund://0x16333436511b5c8c60B251311e325B20F106293E?network=homestead)\\n\\nFor the first issue, we’re working directly from our immediate interest. The first report describes a DAO-based software stack for collective ownership of architecture. It outlines a sequence of scenarios in which programmable money, fractional ownership, and distributed governance radically reconfigure how the built environment is constructed and managed. The second report explores an anticipated issue of memory in digital mind engineering, introducing mathematical models to pose questions and offer solutions. Abstracts can be found below.\\n\\nWe’re sending 4% [Splits](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/splits) to those who laid the groundwork for our concepts, including [Kei Kreutler](https://www.ourmachine.net/), [Jesse Walden](https://variant.fund/), and [Kristoffer Josefsson](https://foam.space/).\\n\\nWe like Mirror, because we see crowdfunding as an opportunity for young professional researchers to break from think tanks, universities, and strategy firms. We take the future too seriously to agree to institutional constraints. By establishing regular feedback with a distributed set of supporters who find our reports valuable, we can create systematic studies of future outcomes – and pathways toward them – without having to trudge through byzantine protocols, semantic ciphers of clients, institutional politics, and arbitrary funding cycles. By lifting legacy constraints, we can speak frankly about the future. We can say what needs to be said. \\n\\n\\n## *Cope #01 – Two Reports*\\n\\n## **The BauDAO – An OS for Urban Ownership** \\n-Pierce Myers\\n\\n\\nThe BauDAO is a collective-oriented, DAO-based software stack that restructures the paradigm of architectural funding, construction and ownership: A Building Information Modeling (BIM) system wrapped in a DAO governance system that leverages the affordances of programmable money. This report outlines a sequence of BauDAO phases that begins with a collectively crowdfunded building project and moves towards a novel vision for an urban operating system. The BauDAO paradigm includes many novel software mechanisms that: \\n\\n- Reduce the organizational complexity of fractional ownership of various urban assets. \\n- Enable multi-tier governance protocols for determining and modifying ‘program’.\\n- Sharply decrease capital barriers to ownership status by several orders of magnitude via smart contract crowdfunding mechanisms. \\n\\nEventually, the BauDAO becomes an Operating System which is applicable to the breadth of architectural typologies, including residential buildings, creative collectives, schools, and co-ops. Lastly, we argue that architects are uniquely positioned to redefine these socio-economic parameters of ownership and governance (Form follows Finance) by removing parasitic developers and the rentier system. As opposed to commodity service providers, architects become fractional owners of built works alongside the distributed communities that own their architecture.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/53418ecd-a4fe-407b-9081-49a311772a5b.jpg?height=2700&width=2700)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## **The Problem of Memory in Digital Minds** \\n-James Douglas Boyd\\n\\nDigital minds will differ from human ones in that they will be both intelligent agents and products of the engineering designs of others. It may not always be easy for a digital mind to differentiate the aspects of its intelligence that are autonomous and those that are features of others’ designs. Memory is one such aspect. We consider an experiment that a digital mind can conduct and two measures that it can estimate for choosing among hypotheses regarding the origins of its memories.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e42a92f8-2e95-463b-b022-d32d4726fbba.png?height=1084&width=2388)\\n\\n\\n\\n### *Going Forward*\\nAs Cope grows, the issues will include more reports from a diversity of future thinkers. The content will become multimedia, and Splits will be automatically sent to thinkers or creators who inspire our work. In the coming weeks, we will introduce feedback mechanisms supported by platforms such as Google Forms, Gather, and Twitch. \\n\\nOur output is high-volume and our turn-arounds are prompt. Successfully crowdfunded reports are released within two weeks, often sooner.\\n\\n\\n\\n### **Thanks,** \\n### **-Cope**\\n\\n\\n\\nPierce Myers [(ig)](https://www.instagram.com/piercze/?hl=en) [(tw)](https://twitter.com/piercze) \\nImage: Ivan Turukano [(vk)](vk.com/turukhano) [(ig)](https://www.instagram.com/turukhano.photo/?hl=en)\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1620240916,\"title\":\"Cope Launch\",\"publication\":\"cope\"},\"digest\":\"V37ryZcDM7taHX1D9whzBbj8eHWbKZriL8lj35ELI2g\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5E692Fe3d06414D75380604BA202c7d5ed94f219\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Oz2K-eXkzku1h-Ri9Wf8OSWPKtz1FcKcNbn0e8M_afY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZXx-8CaEz_Jsj7XVkH5YRuc6xqV0P5fbo4Bi_GKC3jA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"3Xc6w8uWoIQZGupZYiK4o0u5txwc4tv2EkK69J2MuLliyeOIsZLkZ9qjbEmL7Qc8_oOA58wiVIjd6oDOC2WExA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5e43d388301d7d0435ef971ebbefd3dfd85cf3ec5ce452a38fd00a889b1b25195a462e09ad3298e3d3ca70d4288fafac5f22605a9a01a87efa2424b5a017c0631b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on cope.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Oz2K-eXkzku1h-Ri9Wf8OSWPKtz1FcKcNbn0e8M_afY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZXx-8CaEz_Jsj7XVkH5YRuc6xqV0P5fbo4Bi_GKC3jA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"GTSLTwaY78d11sLiWJHaiYR39UOeya4F9x58mHPVVWQ\"}"
