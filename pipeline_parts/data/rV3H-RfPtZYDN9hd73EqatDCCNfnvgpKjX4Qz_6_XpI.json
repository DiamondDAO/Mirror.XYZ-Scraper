It should be noted that Goldfinch borrowers are only institutions, individuals are not allowed to apply for loans on Goldfinch .\\n\\nAnyone can become a Liquidity Provider and backers on the platform, where backers need to have some financial knowledge and an understanding of the lending process. If you don't have this knowledge, please don't worry, the Goldfinch community is currently holding a community learning course for 5 consecutive sessions, which you can participate in and will be rewarded with points that can be redeemed for Goldfinch's platform token (GFI) in the future.\\n\\n## The token reward details of this event\\n\\n* Up to 3% of GFI tokens will be allocated across all iterations of the program\\n* The amount of individual rewards is based on quality and depth of participation\\n* Tokens will likely be granted at the time of GFI launch (Metamask addresses will be collected later for this)\\n* Tokens will be subject to a 2-year lock up starting from launch, with a 1/24 of tokens unlocked monthly. US participants may be subject to a 1 year cliff.\\n* While tokens are locked, Backers can still use them for utility purposes in the protocol including staking and governance votes.\\n\\nIf you would like to participate, please join the official Discord by clicking [here](https://discord.gg/goldfinch).\\n\\n## How to use the platform\\n\\n1\\\\.First, log in to [the official website](https://app.goldfinch.finance/earn)：, as shown in the picture.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fT-QlFCw50PMzPRca-7M4.png?height=677&width=1884)\\n\\n2\\\\.Click  \\\"Connect Metamask\\\"，Connecting to an ETH wallet。\\n\\n3\\\\.Click on the location marked in the picture.\\n\\n4\\\\.Verify address.Click on the location marked in the picture.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LzFvRP7ldgrBNYjFoOMdS.png?height=617&width=1884)\\n\\n5\\\\.Different classification options were chosen depending on the international context, with “Non-U.S. Individuals” used as an example here.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/htWC0Bu5Q1kk-cJ1QOXVy.png?height=617&width=1884)\\n\\n6\\\\.Fill in your email account and Discord account, where Discord account is not required.
