In many ways, DeFi is just a digital version of what a traditional bank does. In traditional banks you deposit US Dollars, the bank pools it together with 100,000 other people who deposit US Dollars, they loan out this big pool of money, and charge interest to make money. In \\\"DeFi\\\", everything is digital, so it goes much faster and is much more efficient. That's probably why you've seen crypto banks giving you 8% APY vs. traditional banks that give you 0.05% APY on savings accounts.\\n\\nSo now that we've established what new DeFi protocols need to work - money in the bank - they are faced with a \\\"cold-start\\\" problem - how do you get people to use your product/protocol at the beginning when no one else is?\\n\\nWell, you can offer tokens. For example, I could start a new DeFi protocol called \\\"DAVECOIN\\\" and say \\\"For every day you leave your (crypto) money in my treasury, I will give you one $DAVECOIN. And every day after that I will increase your reward by 1%, with an APY of 100000%, leaving you with a bajillion $DAVECOIN in like 6 months if you leave your money with us! And the price of $DAVECOIN could go up a lot! You never know!\\\"\\n\\nThis is known as \\\"Yield Farming\\\". It solves the problem of getting a ton of money in a new protocol *very *quickly - some projects raised literally billions of dollars in weeks.\\n\\nBut what happens after a few weeks or months when the treasury is full, and the APY drops to 1%? The people providing the liquidity pack up their liquidity and move to the next protocol.\\n\\nThis is where the key innovation of Olympus DAO comes in to play - **instead of borrowing (or renting) the liquidity, they *******buy*********** it from you (over the course of several days so as not to make the market go up or down very quickly). In turn, you get the Olympus DAO token - $OHM - at a discount.******\\n\\nBy *owning* the liquidity, Olympus doesn't have to worry about people packing up and leaving - they've already bought it from you. And it's working insanely well - they have over half a billion dollars in their treasury.\\n\\n![image](https://vibecap.co/\\\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsuper-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com%2F255e40c6-d154-4deb-aff8-62a4787b3c91%2Fimages%2Fa30c5b2e-0331-4c45-a049-dfd6a3690915.png\\\\&w=1920\\\\&q=80)\\n\\nAnd because their treasury keeps growing larger and larger, they can afford to keep creating new OHM tokens and give them to people who hold OHM tokens. This is called **Staking**, and each 8 hours your staked OHM compounds! Your reward varies, but the current APY is \\\\~**8000%.**\\n\\n![image](https://vibecap.co/\\\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsuper-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com%2F255e40c6-d154-4deb-aff8-62a4787b3c91%2Fimages%2Faed023dd-b44b-4c71-9491-8c90554c4570.png\\\\&w=1920\\\\&q=80)\\n\\nEach OHM token currently goes for \\\\~$1000/token.\\n\\nKlima DAO is a [fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_\\\\(software_development\\\\)#:\\\\~:text=In%20software%20engineering%2C%20a%20project,and%20separate%20piece%20of%20software.\\\\&text=However%2C%20licensed%20forks%20of%20proprietary,\\\\(e.g.%20Unix\\\\)%20also%20happen.) (copy and paste of code, with a few things changed) of Olympus DAO. Instead of trying to accumulate crypto assets in their treasury, **they are trying to accumulate carbon credits in their treasury.**\\n\\nThis has been incredibly successful so far, and they have bought **5% of the world's carbon credits in under a month.**\\n\\n**They also offer current APYs of 34,380.48%.**\\n\\n![image](https://vibecap.co/\\\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsuper-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com%2F255e40c6-d154-4deb-aff8-62a4787b3c91%2Fimages%2F86db42d1-aafd-49bf-bab7-6cc960d78975.png\\\\&w=1920\\\\&q=80)\\n\\nüí°\\n\\n**If you're interested in investing in either of these protocols and want to hop on a call to walk through how to do it, lmk, I'm happy to!
