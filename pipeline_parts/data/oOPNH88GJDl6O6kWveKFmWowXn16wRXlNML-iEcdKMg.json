"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Chapter 01 Fugai Apartment\\n\\nAn old woman whose husband’s family name is Fuguet and her maiden name is Gong Fleng has opened a accommodating apartment in Paris for 40 years. It is located on the Saint-Genevière Street between the Latin Quarter and Saint-Marceau. superior. This boarding dormitory, which everyone calls the Fugai family, recruits all men, women and children, and has never been attacked by a short period of time for weathering problems, but there has never been a girl boarding in 30 years; and the family has to provide poor living expenses for Qu. , So that a young man can live here. Having said that, in 1819, just as the tragedy began, there was indeed a poor girl living in the apartment. Although the word \\\"mixed drama\\\" has been used in recent sentimental and painful literature so lavishly and distortedly that no one believes it; I have to use it here. It is not on the real Yuyi that there is any drama in this story; but after the completion of my book, some people in and outside the capital may shed a few tears. It is really doubtful whether anyone understands this work outside of Paris; there are many textual researches and local sceneries in the book, which can only be understood by those with money between Montmartre Hill and Monroe Heights. In this famous basin, the lime on the wall is always peeling off, and the gutter is full of pitch-black mud; there is so much suffering, empty joy, and so busy, somehow it takes a major accident to make a sensation there. However, there are also some fragmentary pains, because sin and virtue are mixed together to become great and solemn, so that selfish people also have to settle for a certain degree and give birth to a little sympathy; but their feelings are only a momentary thing. Like a beautiful fruit swallowed in a hurry. Civilization is like a big car, like the god car in India, ① encountering a heart that is not easy to be crushed, after a little delay, it immediately crushed it, and then moved on with great strength. You readers are probably the same: Snow White held the book in his hand, buried it in the soft easy chair, and thought: Maybe this novel can make me entertain. After reading Old Man Gao’s secret history of pain, you still have a good appetite for dinner, and put your indifference to the author’s responsibility, saying that the author is exaggerated and the pupils are too much. As everyone knows, this tragedy is neither a fabricated nor a novel. Everything is true and true, ②It is so true that everyone can find the elements of the play in himself or in his heart. \\n 　　------------------------------------------------ \\n 　　①In India, every year on the anniversary of the god Vichnou, the gods are paraded in the car. Good men and women go crazy, even clinging to the car or under the wheel, thinking that this is the case for the next life to be born in a higher class (CaSte). \\n 　　②The original text is in English All is true, and it is in italics. Shakespeare’s tragedy \\\"Henry VIII\\\" was originally called \\\"All is true\\\", and Balzac probably borrowed this sentence. \\n 　　③A real Parisian is a person who lives on the right bank of the Seine. The location of the apartment is the left bank. Lost so often means that the people on the right bank occasionally wander to the left bank. \\n 　　The apartment faces the street on the side and a small garden in front. The house forms a right angle with the Saint-Geneva Restoration. Between the front of the house and the small garden, there is a small gravel road with a slight depression in the middle, about two meters wide; there is a parallel sand paved path in front, with bushes, oleanders and pomegranate trees on both sides, planted in blue Inside a large pottery pot with two colors of white. There is a small door on the side of the small road near the street with a sign nailed on it, which reads: Fugai Dormitory; there is a line below: The restaurant serves meals and meals, all male and female guests are welcome. There was a piercing doorbell on the gate facing the street. During the day, when you look at the gate, you can see a shrine that imitates cyan marble painted on the wall at the other end of the path, which is probably the work of a painter in this area. Inside the shrine is painted a god of love: a mottled glaze, generally like to symbolize a sign that connoisseurs may recognize as a love disease, which can be cured in the neighboring neighborhood. ①The vague inscription on the seat of the idol reminds me of the age of the statue. In 1777, Foulde returned to the era of great popularity in Paris. Those two inscriptions are: ② It is now, was once, or will be in the future. \\n 　　When it gets dark, the gate is replaced with a panel gate. The width of the small garden is exactly equal to the length of the front of the house. On both sides of the garden, there is a wall facing the street on one side, and a wall separating it from the neighbors on the other; the large ivy vines cover the boundary wall, which is particularly quiet and eye-catching in the city of Paris. Fruit trees and vines are nailed to the walls everywhere, and the thin and dusty fruits have become the object of Mrs. Fugai's year-on-year worries, and are also materials for chatting with the tenants. There is a narrow walkway along the two walls on the side, and the shadow of the linden tree is all over the walkway. Even though Mrs. Fugai was from Gong Fuleng, Bodhi Tree Sanyu always said bad words, and it was useless for the tenants to correct her with grammar. Between the two aisles, artichokes were planted on a large square of ground, with fruit trees trimmed into a cone on the left and right, surrounded by fungus baskets, celery, and sauerkraut. There is a green lacquered round table under the shade of the linden tree and a few stools around it. On a summer day, customers who usually have money to drink coffee come here to taste coffee when it is hot enough to incubate chickens. \\n 　　The material used for the four-story house plus the attic is coarse sandstone. The yellow color of the powder makes almost all the houses in Paris unsightly. There are five windows open on each floor, all of which are small pieces of glass; the shades of thin wooden slats are different in height. There are two windows on the side of the house, and the two downstairs are equipped with milled gratings and barbed wire. Behind the main house is a twenty-foot-wide yard: pigs, ducks, and rabbits, mixed together in a friendly manner; there is a shed with a pile of firewood on the bottom of the yard. There is a day cooler between the shed and the back window of the kitchen, underneath it drips dirty water from the sink. By the way, there is a small door on Weixin Street in Geneva. When the cook had to wash the yard in order to avoid the plague, she would hit this door and sweep the garbage into the street. \\n 　　The allocation of houses was meant to open an apartment. In the first room on the ground floor, there are two windows facing the street for light, and a long floor-to-ceiling window leads to the garden. The side of the living room leads to the dining room. Between the dining room and the kitchen is a stairway. The steps of the stairs are made of wooden boards and colorful floor tiles. At a glance, the view of the chamber is no longer bleak: a few sofas and chairs, and the horsehair on the bread is covered with stripes that dim and glow. In the center is a round table with black ground and white stripes on the marble surface. On the table is a set of small white magnetic wine glasses. Most of the gold thread has been peeled off. This kind of wine glasses can still be seen everywhere. The floor in the room is very bad, the surrounding wallboards are only half a person high, and the rest are covered with oiled decals. The main scenes of \\\"Danlan Marge\\\" are painted, and some famous characters are colored in color. On the wall between the two windows with milled silk screens, there is a picture of Gary Posseau's feast in honor of Reese's son. ④ This painting has always been used as an introduction to jokes for young tenants since the forty high school, making fun of them because of their poverty and having to make fun of their meals, indicating that their identity is much higher than their situation. On the stone mantelpiece are two bottles of old paper flowers hidden under a glass cover, and a vulgar half-blue marble pendulum clock is placed in the middle. The interior of the fireplace is very clean. It can be seen that, except for major accidents, a fire is rare. \\n 　　----------------------------------------------- \\n 　　① refers to nearby The Gaposan Hospital in the city of Saint-Abeys. \\n 　　②Furde's inscription for the statue of Eros in the Meizhong Palace Garden. \\n 　　③ \\\"Dan Lan Ma Ge\\\" is a masterpiece of Fanailong in the seventeenth century. \\n 　　④ It is the plot in \\\"Danlan Marge\\\". \\n 　　There is an indescribable ambiguity in this room, which should be called the smell of an apartment. It is an occlusive, moldy, and sour smell, which makes people chills, sucking the greasy greasy in the nose, looking straight into the clothes; it is the smell of the dining room that has just eaten, wine, dishes and bowls. The smell, the smell of the almshouse. The peculiar smell of the guests of all ages, and the disgusting component of the smell of their colds, if it can be analyzed, perhaps this smell can be described. On the other hand, although this cellar is disgusting to you, compared with the dining room next door, you still think the cellar is very decent and fragrant, just like the upper room of the ladies. \\n 　　The dining room is fully equipped with protective walls, the color of the lacquer is no longer distinguishable, only the oil stains painted strange shapes. On a few sticky food utensils cabinets lay dimly cracked water bottles, engraved metal cushions, and piles of Dunai kiln blue-rimmed thick magnetic basins. There is a small cupboard in the corner of the house, which is divided into many numbered grids to store rice towels full of stains and wine marks for caters. Here are the family fears that cannot be destroyed. They have nowhere to be placed and thrown here, just like the remains of civilization left in the sick house. You can see a barometer, a priest appears when it rains; there are also some disgusting engravings with black painted gold frames; a shell clock inlaid with copper for a day; a green stove; a few dusty lamps A light-receiving lamp mixed with oil; a long table covered with varnished cloth, thick enough for a mischievous hospital interns to mark their names with their fingers; a few chairs with broken legs and arms; a few poor pieces The grass braids of the small foot blankets are always scattered and never separated; there are also some tattered foot stoves with broken holes, scattered hinges, and the wooden seat black like charcoal. These families are afraid of old, cracked, rot, shaking, moth-eaten, incomplete, old and weak, and dying. If detailed descriptions, they will inevitably be long and hinder readers' interest in this book. People who are not impatient can forgive them. The red floor tiles are filled with high and low grooves because of scrubbing or coloring. In short, here is a school of poverty without poetry, the kind of poverty that must be compared, concentrated, and riddled with holes; even if there is no mud, there are stains; even if there are no holes, there will be no barriers to the building, but It's about to collapse and decay, turning into rubbish. \\n 　　The most glorious time in this room was around 7 in the morning. Mrs. Fugai’s cat appeared before the owner. It jumped onto the food cupboard and sniffed several jars of milk covered with saucers. Do its morning class. Soon the widow appeared, with a circle of crooked wigs exposed under the cap made of net yarn, lazily wearing soft shoes with a sad face. Her haggard and fleshy face, a parrot-like nose, round hands, a chubby figure like a church rat, and plump, plump cheeks and plump breasts, everything is so shabby. And squatting secretly in the adventurer's dining room to reconcile. She smelled the warm smell of the room and didn't feel uncomfortable at all. Her face was as fresh as the first frost in autumn, with wrinkles all around her eyes, and her expression could change from a smile like a dancing girl to a raised eyebrow like a creditor, and her face straightened. In short, her whole character is sufficient to explain the content of the apartment, just as the apartment can imply her character. The head jailer is indispensable in a prison. The bloodless obesity of this little woman is the result of this life, as if infectious diseases are the product of the hospital atmosphere. A petticoat made of wool is exposed under the skirt. The skirt is changed from old clothes, with cotton wool coming out of the cracked fabric. These clothes are the epitome of the guest room, dining room, and small garden, and they also reveal the contents of the kitchen. Streamlined products with tenants. As soon as she came out, the stage was complete. Mrs. Fuguay, who is about fifty years old, is like all women who have gone through sorrow. Listless eyes, hypocritical spirits, a matchmaker who will pretend to be angry in order to rip off, and she also deliberately seeks bargains by unscrupulous means, if there is any George or Bischgru in the world that can betray, she is determined to betray. ②The tenants said that she was a good person in her bones. They heard her coughing and humming like them, and they believed she was really poor. She never mentioned what kind of person Mr. Fugue was like. How did he lose his furniture? She replied that she had suffered bad luck. He treated her badly, leaving her with a pair of eyes so that she could cry. This house was easy to live, and she also gave her the right not to sympathize with other people's disasters, because she said that she had suffered everything. \\n 　　------------------------------------------------ \\n 　　①Church The mouse used to be a common saying, referring to people who are overly honest; Gubalzac’s intention to compare animals with humans is particularly prominent in this book, so it is translated literally. \\n 　　②George and Piccolo were both figures of the French Revolution and were executed for conspiracy to overthrow Napoleon. \\n 　　Hearing the hasty feet of the hostess, Sylvie, the fat cook, hurriedly prepared the guests' lunch. Normally, guests who send meals usually only include a dinner of 30 francs a month. \\n 　　At the beginning of this story, there were seven boarding guests. On the second floor are the two best rooms in the whole house. Mrs. Fugue lived in a small one, and the other house lived with his ancient wife. Her dead husband worked as a quartermaster in the Republican government. She was in the same position as a young girl, Victoria: Miss Dolly Teyfan, who treated Mrs. Gu as a mother. The board and lodging expenses of these two women's cellars are 1,800 francs per year. In the two suites on the third floor, there lived an old man named Biala, and a man in his forties with wigs and black temples. He claimed to be a retired businessman named Mr. Vautrin. There are four rooms on the fourth floor: an old girl, Miss Mixuno, lived in one room; they used to trade thick and thin noodles and starch, and everyone called the old man Gao, and lived in another room; the other two rooms are ready to be rented to migratory birds①, Xiang Gao The old man and Miss Mischino were like poor students who could only pay forty-five francs a month for board and lodging; but Mrs. Fuguet was reluctant to recruit such people unless they had no alternative, because they ate too much bread. \\n 　　At that time, in one of the two rooms, there lived a young man, Eugene Te, who had come to Paris from the countryside of Angola to study law. Rastignac. His hometown with a large population saves on food and waste, and saves him 1,200 francs a year in living expenses. He is the kind of young man who has to work hard because of the cold family background. He has understood the expectations of his parents since he was a child. He has a wonderful future there, considers the influence of his studies, and caters to the future trends of the society with his subjects. No problem, this authenticity is entirely attributable to his keen mind, to his ability... Without his interesting observations and his pervasive ability in the Parisian social scene, our story would lack true color. ; No problem, this authenticity is entirely attributable to his keen mind, to his desire to explore the secret of a tragedy; and this tragedy is unanimously secretive by the person who caused it and the person who suffered it. \\n 　　On the top of the four-story building, there is a loft for drying clothes, and there are two bedrooms for Christophe, the handman who does rough work, and Sylvie, the fat cook. \\n 　　In addition to the seven boarding guests, Mrs. Uga said that there are always eight law or medical college students in the off-season, as well as two or three regular guests in the nearby quarters, and they will include a dinner. The dining room can accommodate ten or twenty people, with eighteen people sitting at dinner; there are only seven guests for lunch, and the scene of a group table is quite family-like. Each occupant went downstairs with soft shoes, and had no scruples about the demeanor of the clothes and the accident overnight. These seven guests are like the children whom Mrs. Fouquet particularly loves. According to the amount of board and lodging expenses, she sets a measure of care and respect for others, just like an astronomer. This group of people who met by the water had the same plan in their hearts. The two tenants on the three-story building only paid seventy-two francs a month. These cheap prices (except for the room and meals of the ancient wife), can only be found in the city of St. Marseille, between the obstetric hospital and the refugees' training center. This proves that those houses are under the oppression of poverty, both openly and secretly, so the tragic scene inside this house is still exposed in the shabby clothes of the households. The men wore inexplicable color coats, like the boots thrown in the streets of high-class residential areas, the torn shirts, and the nameless clothes. The women wore old-fashioned, dyed and faded clothing; they wore old mended laces, shiny gloves, always dark yellow collars, and scarves with divergent latitude and longitude. Although the clothes are like this, the people are almost all born very strong, resisting the storms of the passing world; cold and ruthless faces, as if worn out and no longer in circulation of silver coins, fuzzy; dry mouth with a sharp pair teeth. When you see them, you will experience the dramas that have been performed and are being performed. They are not performed in front of the footlights and sets, but some lively, or silent, cold, and heart-warming. Stirring, continuous drama. \\n 　　----------------------------------------------- \\n 　　① means short Passersby of the period. This phrase is another example of the author comparing animals to humans. \\n 　　The old girl Mixuno wore a greasy green silk dress over her tired eyes, and the copper wire on her head was even surprised by the god of mercy. There was only a handful of bones left in his body, and the shawls like tears fell on Yanzi, as if draped over a pair of dead bones. She must have come here too handsomely at the beginning, but how could she be so stunned now? For nonsense? Is there anything sad? Overly greedy? Do you talk too much about love? Have you ever been in the pollen business? Or just a prostitute? Was she being punished by passers-by when she was old because she was too arrogant and extravagant when she was young? The pale eyes make people feel cold, and Yu's deflated face is a bit fierce. The sharp sound is like a temporary cicada screaming in the jungle in winter. She claimed to have served an elderly man suffering from cystitis, and was left aside by her children as having no money. The old man gave her a life annuity of one thousand francs, and his successors have often argued with her about this and talked ill of her. Although her face has been devastated by lust, there are still some traces of whiteness and delicateness between her skin, which shows that there is still a little residual beauty on her body. \\n 　　Mr. Poale is almost a machine. He walked on the path of the botanical garden like a gray shadow: wearing a soft old peaked cap, holding a cane feebly, the ivory ball handle has turned yellow; the faded coat cannot cover the empty leggings, only the clothes Pulled to and fro; blue socks, two legs shaking as if drunk; a white vest with meninges exposed on the upper body, a roving neckline like withered grass, and an awkward tie wrapped around a turkey neck , Tangled up in a mess. Seeing his appearance, everyone thought to himself, does this ghost belong to the same violent and presumptuous self-cultivation as the brothers strolling on the streets of Italy? What kind of work made him shrunk like this? What kind of passion turned his face full of small balls into a black pig liver color? The face is drawn into a comic, it doesn't seem to be real. What errand has he been? I can’t say that I have ever customized the staff of the Ministry of Justice and have handled the bills sent by the executioners-the black veil used to carry out the criminal offense, the chaff under the punishment platform, the rope hanging the measuring knife on the torture frame, etc. bill. Maybe he worked as a cashier at a slaughterhouse, or as a deputy inspector of the Department of Health. In short, this gang is like a donkey in a big social mill, who has been a puppet and never knows who is in the line. It also seems to be the axis of how many public disasters or scandals; in a word, he is the axis of how many public disasters or scandals we have met. After all, these people are also indispensable. These beautiful people in Paris don't know these faces that have been grind to death by mental or physical pain. Paris is really an ocean, and it is impossible to measure the depth of the ocean without dropping the sea hammer. No matter how much effort it takes to search and describe, no matter how many and enthusiastic ocean explorers are, they will always find a virgin land, a new cave, or a few flowers, a few pearls, some monsters, some unheard of, writers. Unexpectedly to visit. Fugai Apartment is one of these strange magic caves. \\n 　　Among them, two faces are in striking contrast with most of the tenants and the main food. Although Miss Victory Teifan was pale and sickly, she looked like a girl who caused bloody tuberculosis; although she was often melancholy, cramped, shabby and delicate appearance, she couldn't get out of this picture. The basic tone-pain; but her face is not that of an elderly person, and her movements and voice are light and lively. This unfortunate young man seemed to be a newly transplanted shrub, which was dying due to unfavorable water and soil. The reddish face in yellow, the gray hair, and the excessively slender waist are quite the touches that modern poets have found on medieval statuettes. The gray and black eyes show her Christian gentleness and tolerance. The simple and economical attire outlines the figure of the young man. Her beauty is due to the coincidence of the fifth house limbs. As long as she is happy, she may be very moving; a woman needs happiness to be poetic, just as well-dressed can she look beautiful. If the joy of the prom stains this pale face with some pink tones, if the exquisite life makes the already slightly sunken cheeks plump and flushed, if love restores the melancholy eyes, Wei Dolly can meet the most beautiful girls. She only lacks the things that teach women to rejuvenate: clothes and love letters. Her story is enough to write a book. Her father thought he had a reason to deny his biological daughter, so he would not let her stay with him, but he only gave six hundred francs a year and changed the nature of his property so that it could be passed on to his son. Victory's mother died in the house of his distant relative, Gu's wife in misery and despair; Gu's wife raised the orphans as if they were their own daughters. The widow of the military supply officer of the Republican government unfortunately has nothing except her husband’s advance annuity and public pension. She may have left this inexperienced and wealthy young girl at the mercy of society. The kind-hearted wife takes Victory to Mass every week, and once every half a month, she goes to a thousand regrets, so that she can be at least a Yucheng girl in the future. This method is really good. With religious enthusiasm, this abandoned girl can also have a way out in the future. She loves her father, and every year she goes home to convey her mother's grievances towards her father when she is dying; every year her father keeps the door behind her. Only her brother can mediate, and his brother has not visited her once in four years, nor has he helped her. She begged God to open her father's eyes, make her brother soft, and pray for them without resentment. The old wife and Mrs. Fugai only hate that there are too few curses in the dictionary to describe this barbaric behavior. When they cursed the millionaire who made bad money, Victory always said something soft, like a wounded wild pigeon, still screaming love. \\n 　　-------------------------------------------- \\n 　　① According to French criminal law, where When the Nilun criminal is taken to the execution ground, he must be covered with black veil for identification. The chaff under the execution stage is ready to absorb the blood of the corpse. \\n 　　Eugene Te Rastignac has a purely southern face: self-skin, black hair, and blue eyes. His demeanor, behavior, and posture all show that he is a child of everyone, and his childhood education only allows him to have elegant habits. Although the dress is simple, he wears the old clothes of the next year every day, and sometimes he can dress up and take to the streets in a graceful manner. Usually he only wears an old coat and a thick vest; the crappy old black tie is so-so, just like a normal college student; the pants are similar to the tops, and the boots have been replaced with leather. \\n 　　Between the two young men and the rest of the tenants, the forty-and-a-half, with stained sideburns, Vautrin, happened to be a middle man. When people see him, they will yell a good fellow! He has broad shoulders, well-developed chest, bulging muscles, and Fang Fang's hands are very thick, with clusters of thick tea-red hairs growing in his fingers. A wrinkled face before his age seems to be a sign of a cold personality; but his soft and affectionate attitude is not like a cold person. His low-mid-pitched voice just matched his jovial temper, which is definitely not annoying. He is very attentive, always smiling. When the lock key was broken, he immediately removed it, repaired it when he was extremely skilled, oiled it, grind it for a while, assembled it, and said: \\\"I understand this set.\\\" And he knew everything: sailboats, oceans, France, foreign countries, business, people, current affairs, laws, hotels, prisons. If someone complained too much, he immediately leaned in to help. He lent money to Mrs. Fuguet and some tenants several times; but the beneficiaries did not dare to rely on his debt, because despite his easy-going appearance, he had a deep and determined look that made people afraid. Looking at the salivating power frame, you can know the degree of his calm mind: if you want to solve any embarrassing situation, you must kill people without blinking. Like a harsh judge, his eyes seem to be able to see through all problems, all hearts, and all feelings. His daily life is to go out after lunch, come back for dinner, spend the whole evening outside, come back around midnight, and open the door with the treasure key given to him by Mrs. Fugue. He is the only one who enjoys the preferential treatment of Babao Key. He treated the widow no matter how well, he called her mother, next to her waist,-it's a pity that this kind of flattery is not enough for the other party. The old mother thought it was easy, but she didn't know that only Vautrin had such long arms to reach her thick waist. Another characteristic of him is that he drinks a glass of Gloria after a meal, and spends fifteen francs a month very generously. Those young people who are completely involved in the whirlpool of life in Paris have nothing to see, and those old people are indifferent to everything that has nothing to do with them, but even people who are not as superficial as them will not notice Volta. The cold looks suspicious. He can know or guess the things of others; no one can see through his mind or business. Although he regards his affectionate attitude and cheerful temperament as a wall between him and others, the character he reveals from time to time is quite terrifying. He often complains that can be compared with Yu Fanna. He loves to ridicule the law, lashes at the upper-class society, and attacks its contradictions. It seems that he holds hatred for the society and hides some secrets in his heart. \\n 　　Miss Taiyifan's secret glances and private thoughts were inseparable from the middle-aged man and the college student. One is energetic, and the other is beautiful. She is attracted by them inadvertently. But none of the two seemed to think of her. Although the heavens are impermanent, she may have changed and become a wealthy dowry. Moreover, those people are unwilling to judge whether the misery others claim to be true or false. In addition to being indifferent, they are also wary of others because of their different circumstances. They know that there is no power to relieve the pain of others, and they usually sigh too much, and they have already said all the words of comfort to each other. Like the old couple, there is nothing to talk about. Their relationship is only a mechanical life, which means that there is no oiled gear to push each other there. They can meet a blind man on the road and walk past without looking back, or they can listen indifferently to other people's sufferings, and even regard death as a solution to a tragic situation. The result of suffering is that everyone feels the most painful. The suffering is cold. The happiest of these sad people is still Mrs. Fuguei, who superbly controls this private almshouse. Only Mrs. Fuguet thought that the small garden was a smiling forest; in fact, the silence and cold, dryness and dampness made the garden as wide as a prairie without weirs. Only for her, this yellow, gloomy, patina-scented room full of accounts is full of joy. These cells belong to her. She feeds those prisoners who have worked hard for life, and they respect her authority. At the price she ordered, where can these poor bugs find adequate and hygienic meals in Paris, and rooms that can at least be kept clean even if they can’t be arranged elegantly? Even if she did something extremely unfair, people could only endure it and didn't dare to complain. \\n 　　---------------------------------------------- \\n 　　①State-owned alcohol Coffee or black tea. \\n 　　②A Latin poet who was famous for his satire in the first century AD. \\n 　　The members of the entire society certainly have everything in such a group, but they are specific and trivial. Just like in a school or a social field, among the eighteen guests at the dinner table, there is a poor person who is blinded by the eye. He always gives people a punching bag. Eugene. special. Rastignac lived until the beginning of the second year, and found that in this environment where he had to live for the last two years, the most eye-catching thing was the punching bag, the old man Golio, who was in the noodle business. If the painter deals with this object, he will definitely focus the light on his head like a historian. With half-hateful contempt, with contemptuous abuse, and a merciless attitude towards suffering, why was it added to one of the oldest tenants? Is there anything ridiculous or weird about him that is more difficult to forgive than vice? These problems involve many atrocities in society. Perhaps human nature likes to teach those who endure everything for humility, for cowardice, or for indifference, to endure everything. Don't we all like to sacrifice people or things to prove our strength? The youngest creature, the child, would ring someone's doorbell in the cold weather, or scribble his name on a brand new building with his toes. \\n 　　The sixty-nine-year-old old man Gao ended his business in 1813, and Jia came to Mrs. Fuguet. He lived in the suite of the ancient wife first, and paid 1,200 francs a year for board and lodging. The style seemed to be five louis or less. Mrs. Ugai received a compensation fee in advance and refurbished the three houses and added some minimum furniture, such as yellow curtains, wool suede easy chairs, a few plastic paintings, and even a country hotel. Paste wallpaper. Old man Gao was still honored as Mr. Gao Liao at that time. Perhaps the landlord looked at his indifferent lavishness and thought he was a fool who didn't know the market. When Gaulio moved in, the cages were full, the clothes inside and outside, and the linen of the bedding were very particular, indicating that the old Bao businessman would be very blessed. Eighteen No. 2 Dutch muslin shirts are too much to admire. The noodle dealer still buckles two diamond pins around the neck of the gauze, with a small chain in the middle, which makes the shirt material more delicate and clean. He usually wears a set of sapphire blue clothes, every day he changes into a snow-white gingham vest, with a big round belly underneath it moving, shaking a thick gold chain with pendants of various colors. The snuff box is also gold, and there is a small round box full of hair, as if he still has a romantic hug. Hearing that the landlord said that he was romantic, he immediately smiled, as if a little rich man heard the praise of his beloved. His cabinet (he pronounced the term goodbye like the poor) was filled with many household silverware. When the widow Fugai was helping him with the whole thing, her eyes brightened. What spoons, spoons, food, oil bottles, soup bowls, plates, gilded breakfast utensils, and the beauty and ugliness were quite heavy, and he was reluctant to let go. thing. These gifts reminded him of major events in family life. He grabbed a plate, kissed a small bowl with two pigeons on Yishang, and said to Mrs. Fugue: \\n 　　\\\"This is given to me by my wife on the first anniversary of our marriage. A kind woman has spent her savings when she was a girl. Oh, ma'am, you can dig the soil with your hands. I will never let go of these things. Thank God! I can always use this body to drink coffee every morning in my life; I don’t have to worry, it’s a long time to have ready-made meals.” Finally, Mrs. Fuguet’s pair of magpies also glimpsed a pile of public debt notes. A good man earns 8,000 to 10,000 francs a year. From that day on, the first grandmother of the Gong Flenng family, and Mrs. Fugai, who was forty-eight and only admitted to thirty-nine, had made up her mind. Although the inner corners of Golio's eyes were turned outwards, swollen and falling down, he often used his hands to wipe them, she thought this look was decent and flattering. His fleshy and protruding calves, like his square nose, suggest that he possesses some of the advantages that the widow of Fugue has valued; and the full moon-like, innocent and demented face also proves from the side. The ideal man in the widow of Fugai should be strong and strong, able to spend all his energy on affection. Every morning, the barber from Polytechnic School came to dust Gaulio's hair and comb it into a dove-wing style, leaving five sharp corners on his low forehead, which was very beautiful. Although a little morale, he dressed very neatly, and he always poured a lot of cigarettes. The air inhaled in his nostrils indicated that he never worried about the lack of Maguba in the cigarette pot. So on the day that Golio moved into Mrs. Fuguet’s house, when she went to bed at night, she figured out how to leave Fuguet’s tomb and go to Golio to regenerate; she put this idea on the flames of desire to barbecue, as if roasting one. The greased bamboo chicken. Dip again, sell the apartment, combine with this bourgeois essence, become a prominent wife in the district, collect donations for the poor, visit Asahi, Soasi, and Chantilly on Sundays; go to the theater as you like, sit down In the box, there is no need to wait for the tenant to get a few coupons from the writer in mid-July to give her; in short, she has the golden dream of ordinary Parisian citizens. She had forty thousand francs accumulated from steel and copper, and she never mentioned it to anyone. Of course, she felt that in terms of property, she was still an excellent target. \\\"As for other things, I'm afraid I won't be able to compare to this guy!\\\" Thinking of this, she turned over on the bed, as if she wanted to show a wonderful figure, so Fat Sylvie saw a sunken nest on the mattress every morning. \\n 　　--------------------------------------------- \\n 　　①Louis is an old French gold coin, ranging from twenty to twenty-four francs, which varies from time to time. \\n 　　②It is one of the most famous universities in France. \\n 　　③The most famous type of snuff at the time. \\n 　　④Xu Assi, So Assi and Chantilly are all places of interest in the suburbs of Paris. \\n 　　From this day, for about three months, the widow of Fuguei used Mr. Golio’s barber to put a little blood in her dress, and said that the people in the apartment were very decent, and she had to dress up to match them. . She thought of all kinds of things to adjust the tenants, and declared that from now on she would only entertain the most decent people in every respect. When encountering a stranger, she advertised that Mr. Gaulio, the most prestigious and prestigious business in Paris, had chosen her apartment in particular. She handed out flyers with a big book and special book: Fugai Dormitory, followed by: \\\"The oldest and most well-known catering apartment in the Latin Quarter. The scenery is beautiful and you can overlook the Gaobei Leng Basin (that is, it is to be overlooked on the fourth floor. ), the garden pavilion is elegant, and the linden trees are in the shade.\\\" In addition, it also mentioned that the environment is quiet and the air is fresh. \\n 　　This leaflet recruited the Countess de Lambémeny for her, 36 years old, her husband was a general who died on the battlefield; she was a widow of a martyred soldier, waiting for the public to settle her pension. Mrs. Fuguet made the food exquisitely, and the fire in the living room had been on for six months, and the promises on the flyers were strictly fulfilled, even at the expense of her. The countess called Mrs. Fouquet a dear friend, and said that she was going to introduce the Baroness T. Foumanlang and the widow of the Colonel Begallén, and her two friends here; they lived in a family in the Marais. In the dormitory, which is much more expensive than the Fugai apartment, the lease term is almost full. Once the various departments of the War Department completed the formalities, these wives were very rich. \\n 　　\\\"But,\\\" she said, \\\"the official business in the yamen never ends.\\\" The \\n 　　two widows went upstairs after supper together to chat in Mrs. Fuguet's room, drinking fruit wine and chewing the landlord's own candies for personal use. Mrs. Lambeméne strongly agreed with the landlord’s wife’s views on Golio, and she thought it was a good idea. It is said that she guessed what the landlord’s wife was thinking as soon as she walked in; she felt that Golio was a perfect man. \\n 　　\\\"Ah! Dear Mrs.\\\" said the widow of Fouquet, \\\"he has nothing wrong with him, and he is well maintained, and he can give a woman a lot of happiness.\\\" The \\n 　　countess was very enthusiastic about Mrs. Fouquet's attire. , Thinks that she can't match her ambitions yet. \\\"You have to be armed,\\\" she said. After careful calculations, the two widows went to the wooden corridor at Wangfu Market together and bought a hat decorated with feathers and a cap. The countess took her friend to the little Jenard's shop and picked up a dress and a shawl. Armed to buy all of them, after Zha Khan is set, the widow really looks like the sign of the simmering beef restaurant ③. She felt that she had changed a lot and added a lot of charm, and she was very grateful to the countess. Even though she was stingy by nature, she insisted that the countess accept a twenty francs hat; in fact, she planned to entrust her to explore Golio. , Brag about yourself. Mrs. Lambéméne was very willing to do this errand, and had a close conversation with the old noodle dealer, trying to win him over and seduce him for his own use; but all kinds of temptations, even if the other party did not understand the rejection, at least he was shy; His morals drove her away. \\n 　　\\\"My dear,\\\" she said to her friend, \\\"you can't squeeze anything out of this guy! His suspicious attitude is ridiculous; this is a miser, an idiot, an idiot, and only annoying.\\\" \\n 　　The meeting between Mr. Golio and Mrs. Lambemény made the countess even reluctant to live in the same house with him. She left the next day and forgot about the six months' board and lodging expenses, and the rags left behind were only worth five francs. Mrs. Fouquet desperately searched, but she couldn't find out something about special. News of the Countess Lambéne. She often mentions this insulting affair, complaining that she is too trusting of others, in fact, her suspicion is more serious than that of a cat; but like many people, she is always wary of close people and fooled by the first stranger. This weird and real phenomenon can easily find its root in a person's heart. Maybe some people can't get anything from the people who live together; after exposing the emptiness of their souls, they secretly feel that they are severely criticized by others; and those who can't get compliments, they just feel the need, or They try their best to show that they have the advantages they have never had before; therefore, they hope to win the respect or affection of strangers, regardless of whether they will fail in the future. There are even first-class people who are naturally snobbish and are absolutely inconvenient for friends or close people, because it is their duty and they are not paid; it is no better than serving strangers to satisfy their self-esteem; so they are separated from them in the emotional circle The closer they are, the less they love; the farther they are, the more diligent they are. Obviously Mrs. Fuguet had both of the above personalities, and in her bones they were all humble, hypocritical and nasty. \\n 　　\\\"If I were here,\\\" said Vautrin, \\\"you won't suffer this loss! I'll crack the cheek of the female liar and teach her to show off on the spot. I know that kind of face.\\\" \\n 　　--- ----------------------------------------- \\n 　　①From the seventeenth century, Marais The district is the high-class residential area of ​​Paris. \\n 　　②Before 1828, there was a corridor in Wangfu Market. It was all slab houses with small shops. The name of the corridor was Mulang. \\n 　　③The restaurant was open on Middle School Street at that time, and a cow was painted on the sign, wearing a hat and a quilt; there was a sock tree next to it, and a woman was sitting next to it. \\n 　　Like all people who are not broad-minded, Mrs. Fuguay can never stand outside the matter and inquire into the cause of it. She likes to push her mistakes on others. After that loss, she thought the honest noodle dealer was the culprit; and according to her own words, she died since then. When she admitted that all the provocations and scratching gestures were useless, she immediately guessed the reason, thinking that the tenant had something else like she said. It turns out that her beautiful and moving hope is just an empty dream, and nothing can be squeezed out of this guy, just as the countess said sharply,-she seems to be an expert. Mrs. Fuguet's degree of hostility since then, of course, far exceeds the degree of previous friendship. The reason for the hatred was not for her love, but for the shattering of hope. A person who climbs to the peak of feelings may take a break in the middle; if one looks down from the dangerous slope of resentment, it is rare to stay. However, Mr. Golio was her guest, and the widow had to sicken her injured self-esteem to prevent it from exploding. She hid her disappointed long sighs and kept her thoughts of revenge in her belly, as if the monk had been angry with the dean. Whenever a villain wants to vent his feelings, regardless of whether it is a good feeling or a bad feeling, he always plays small tricks constantly. Relying on the woman's cunning pig, the widow came up with many secret tricks to torture her enemy. She first canceled several small programs added in the apartment. \\n 　　\\\"There is no need for gherkins and catfish. They are all fools!\\\" She told Sylvie the morning when she restored the old chapter. \\n 　　However, Mr. Golio is self-reliant, just like ordinary people who make a family from nothing, the frugality of the early years has become a habit. Vegetarian soup, or broth, plus a plate of vegetables, has always been, and always should be, his most satisfying dinner. Therefore, it is extremely difficult for Fugai to be too big to torture her tenants. He has nothing to do with hobbies, so he tried to embarrass him. When encountering such an invulnerable person, she felt helpless and could only look down on him and infect other tenants with her hostility towards Golio; and they even helped her out for fun. \\n 　　At the end of the first year, the widow was very suspicious of him, and even felt kindly in her heart: this rich businessman with seven to eight thousand francs, the silverware and accessories are no less exquisite than the rich man’s outer room, why come here and only pay one Pen in the proportion of his property for board and lodging expenses? For most of this first year, Mr. Golio always had dinner out once or twice a week; afterwards, it was changed to twice a month without knowing it. Uncle Golio’s sweet dates matched the interests of Mrs. Fuguay too well; therefore, his habit of dining at home became more and more normal, and Mrs. Fuguay had to be angry. This change is believed to be due to the slow reduction of his property on the one hand, but also due to his deliberate embarrassment with the landlord. Among the villain's most despicable habits, there is one that thinks that others are just as stingy as them. Unfortunately, at the end of the second year, Mr. Gario actually confirmed his rumors and asked to be moved to the third floor, and the board and lodging expenses were reduced to 900 francs. He needs to spread the festival so much that there is not even a fire in the whole winter house. The widow Fugue asked him to pay first and then live, and Golio agreed, and she called him Old Man Gao from then on. \\n 　　There was a lot of discussion about the reason for his downgrade, but they couldn't figure it out! As the false countess said, Old Man Go is a guy deep in the city. Generally, people who are empty-headed and talk nonsense because they can only talk nonsense have their own logic, and think that there is no good thing for people who do not mention their personal affairs. In their eyes, such a decent rich businessman turned into a liar, and a romantic figure turned into an old bastard. Suddenly, according to Vautrin, who moved into the apartment in that era, Old Man Gao worked as an exchange. After sending out his money, he still made some small speculations on public debt. This sentence was used in Vautrin's mouth. It is a vivid financial term. Suddenly, he was a gambler at least, trying his luck every night and winning him ten francs. Suddenly, he was an undercover agent hired by the secret police; but Vautrin thought he was not cunning enough for the job. It’s also said that Old Man Gao is a miser who puts money in stamps, or he is someone who chased the lottery of the same number. In short, everyone regards him as a bad hobby, shameless, low-powered, and the most mysterious character that can be produced. But no matter how bad his behavior or bad habits are, the hostility towards him will not drive him out: he has never owed money for the house. What's more, he also has his usefulness. Everyone's happy or bad mood can be vented by him by joking or grunting. The opinion that seems to have been unanimously approved by everyone recently is that of Mrs. Fouquet. This is so well maintained, there is no problem at all, and it can give a woman many happy singers. According to her, it is really a weird lecher. The bad words of Widow Fagai are based on the following facts. \\n 　　The unlucky star countess lived in vain for half a year, and a few months after it fell off, before Mrs. Fuguay got up one morning, she heard the sound of silky clothes on the stairs, and a young woman slipped gently and skillfully into the high. In the Austrian room, the way to open the door seemed to have a secret signal again. Fat Sylvie immediately came up to report to the hostess that there was a girl who was not as pretty as a good family woman, dressed as a fairy, wearing a pair of dust-free thin-soled woolen boots, she kept going into the kitchen from the street like an eel. Ask where Mr. Golio's room is. Mrs. Fuguet took the cook to the door to eavesdrop on the door, and the gentle words caught in her ears; there was also a long time for the two to meet. Gorio sent the female guest out, and the fat Sylvie immediately grabbed the basket and pretended to be on the market to follow the lovers. \\n 　　She came back and said to the hostess: \\\"Madam, Mr. Gorlio-you have to pay a lot of money to support such a scene. You can't imagine that there is a beautiful carriage waiting on the corner of Hanging Street. I watched her go up. .\\\" \\n 　　--------------------------------------------- \\n 　　①Buy lottery tickets Every time I buy the same number to increase the cost, it’s called a lottery of the same number.\\\" At \\n 　　dinner, the cover was too big to pull the curtains to block out the dark sunlight shining on Golio’s eyes. ① \\n 　　\\\"Gao\\\" Mr. Leo, you are shining in the sun, and you are so beautiful,\\\" she said, alluding to his appearance in the morning. \\\"Scare! You have good eyesight, she is very beautiful. \\\" \\n 　　That's my daughter;\\\" he replied with the proud air, Fang Rong thought it was an old man deliberately choosing face. \\n 　　A month later, another female guest came to visit Mr. Golio. His daughter's first time. I came to wear the morning dress, this time after dinner, I dressed as if I was going out to socialize. The tenants were chatting in the cellar and caught a glimpse of a beautiful blond woman with a thin waist, very rich and graceful. It's impossible to be the daughter of Old Man Gao. \\n 　　\\\"Hey!\\\" There are two competing! \\\"The fat Sylvie said; she didn't recognize the same person at all. \\n 　　After a few days, another daughter, tall, strong, dark skin, black hair, with piercing eyes, ran to see Golio Mr. \\n 　　\\\"Oh! There are three! \\\"Sylvie said. \\n 　　The second daughter came in the morning for the first time . A few days later, she wore a dancing shirt at dusk and came by car. \\n 　　\\\"Oh! There are four! \\\"Mrs. Fuguet and Sylvie yelled together. They didn't see in this Mrs. Broad that she was dressed plainly last morning. \\n 　　At that time Golio paid 1,200 francs for board and lodging. Mrs. Fugue felt that it was common for a rich man to raise four or five mistresses, and it was also very clever to use his mistress as a daughter. He called them to the apartment, and she was not angry. But since those female faces explained the reason for Gorio's indifference to her, she asked him to be an old tomcat at the beginning of the second year. After he was downgraded to 900 francs, once she saw one of these female faces coming downstairs, and asked him viciously what he planned to use her apartment for. Old man Gao replied that this lady was his eldest daughter. \\n 　　\\\"Does your daughter have two or three dozen?\\\" Mrs. Fugue said sharply. \\n 　　\\\"I only have two,\\\" Old Man Gao replied in a very soft tone, just like a troubled person, who can bear all the grievances of poverty. \\n 　　At the end of his third year, Old Man Gao had to save money and moved to a four-story building. The monthly room cost was only forty-five francs. He gave up snuff, sent the barber, and stopped dusting powder on his head. It was the first time that Old Man Gao went downstairs without dusting powder. The landlord's wife was surprised and cried out; his hair was originally grayish-greenish pickled. His face was worn out by the secret worry day by day, and it seemed to be the most melancholy face at the dinner table. Now there is no doubt: Old Man Gao is an old pervert. Had it not been for the doctor's skill, his eyes would have been poor, because the drugs used to treat his disease had side effects. The ugly color of his hair is also due to his indulgence and the drugs that make him continue to indulge. The mental and physical condition of the poor creature made the nonsense seem conclusive. The beautiful bedding clothes were worn out, so he bought fourteen copper yards of cotton cloth instead. The diamond, the gold cigarette case, the gold chain, and the accessories are all gone. He took off the sapphire club and those gorgeous clothes, regardless of winter and summer, wearing only a maroon coat, woolen vest, and gray woolen trousers. He is getting thinner and thinner, his calf is falling; the face that was previously fat and contented is wrinkled for some reason; there are grooves in the forehead, and the gum bones protrude. In his fourth year living on the rue Saint-Genevière, he changed completely. At the age of sixty-two, the noodle dealer seemed to be under forty. He was a fat and fat little rich man who seemed to have come here not long ago. He was arrogant and arrogant. He taught passers-by a happy smile and a youthful smile; now suddenly he looks like The seventy old man, the dragon and the dragon clock, the broadcast swayed, his face was like ashes. The blue eyes that were so energetic at the beginning turned into a pale iron gray, turned pale, and the tears disappeared, and the red eyes seemed to be bleeding. Some people find him abominable, some people find him pathetic. Generally, young medical students noticed his drooping lips, measured the top of his face, and after teasing him again and again but couldn't find out anything, he said that he had caused a goiter. ②One \\n 　　evening, after dinner, Mrs. Fugue sarcastically said, \\\"Ah, hello! Are they not coming to see you, your daughters?\\\" He obviously doubted his fatherhood. When Old Man Gao heard it, his whole body trembled, as if giving the landlord a shot. \\n 　　\\\"Sometimes,\\\" he replied in a shaking voice. \\n 　　\\\"Oh! Sometimes you see them!\\\" college students like that shouted in unison, \\\"It's amazing, old man Gao!\\\" \\n 　　The old man did not hear the ridicule caused by his answer, and resumed his dazed air. People who just look at it superficially think he is very old. If you know him thoroughly, maybe everyone will think that his physical and mental exhaustion is a big mystery; but getting to know him is really not easy. It’s not difficult to find out if Gaulio has ever been in the noodle business, and how much property he has. The old people who carelessly pay attention to him never walk out of the neighborhoods in the area, and always hide in the apartment like oysters sticking to the rocks; as for others, living in Paris The peculiar temptation made them forget the poor old man they ridiculed as soon as they walked out of Saint-Genevière Street. The narrow-minded people and the indifferent young people agree that the kind of shame and stupidity of the old man Gao has nothing to say about possessions or skills. As for the mothers-in-law whom he called his daughters, everyone accepts Fugaida's opinion. An old woman like her who chews her tongue every night likes to guess everything, but she has a set of strict logic. She said: \\n 　　\\\"If Old Man Gao really has such a rich daughter, like those who came to see him Rong, he would never live on my fourth floor and only pay forty-five francs a month for room and meals, and he would never dress like a poor man... and go out into the street.\\\" \\n 　　-------- ------------------------------------- \\n 　　① The dinner mentioned in this book is about four in the afternoon Click around. The apartment only serves two meals a day. \\n 　　②Face angle is a physiological term. The horizontal line from the ear hole to the alveolar (the junction of the nostril and the lip) on the side, and the vertical line from the upper part of the eye socket (that is, the most protruding part of the forehead) to the alveolar on the front. The angle where the two lines meet is called the face angle. Humans have large facial angles, which are close to right angles; beasts have small facial angles, which are close to acute angles. The top of the facial angle refers to the upper part of the eye socket. The physiological phenomenon of goiter is often sudden eye bursts, and the mental phenomenon is dullness and mental decline. \\n 　　Nothing can overrule this conclusion. So by the end of November 1819, when this tragedy broke out, everyone in the apartment had a very positive opinion of the poor old man. He had never had any wives, sons or daughters; as a result of his obscenity, he turned into a snail, a human-shaped mollusk. According to a patron, a museum staff member said that he should be included in the Gas Getty class. Compared with Old Man Gao, Poale was like an eagle and looked like a gentleman. Poale can speak, theory, and answer; although his speech, theory, and answer are just repeating other people's words in different words; but after he participates in the conversation, he is alive and seems to be sentient; not more than old man Gao , According to the staff of the museum, always pointed to zero on the cold and heat table. \\n 　　Eugene Te Gistigne came back from the summer vacation, and he was in the same mood as a handsome and promising young man or someone who temporarily appeared superior because of a difficult family situation. In the first year of staying in Paris, law students did not have much homework for the primary diploma exam, so they could enjoy the prosperity of Paris. You need to know the drama of each theater, find the clues to the Paris maze, learn the rules, talk, add to the unique entertainment of the capital, travel around good and bad places, choose interesting courses, and learn the treasures of each museum ,...A college student never thinks that there is too much time. He would be fascinated by boring little things, and he thought it was great. He has his big people, such as some professors at the French Academy, people who get paid to attract the masses. He straightened his tie and scratched his head at the women in the lobby of the Comedy Opera House. After the same entry, he got rid of his shell, broadened his horizons, and finally realized how the social strata intertwined. On the day of the big sun, the chariots and horses converging on the Amano Avenue, he just knew how to appreciate it, and then he was jealous. \\n 　　Eugene received a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Laws, and during the summer when he returned to his hometown, he had already gone through these studies unknowingly. The image of childhood, the concept of inland people, has been completely wiped out. With a change of knowledge and ambition, he saw clearly the situation in his hometown. Father, mother, two brothers, two younger sisters, and an aunt who had no property but a pension, all lived in the small fields of the Rastignac family. The group that collects about three thousand francs a year is not sure about the money, because the market for grapes follows the ups and downs of the wine market, but he has to make up 1,200 francs every year. The scene of perennial embarrassment that the family has always concealed in order to love him; he compares the sister who he thought so beautiful when he was a child with the typical Parisian women he thought of as beautiful; the slender future of the big family that was on his shoulders; seeing The habit of frugality in which any trivial crop is cherished; the home-cooked beverage made from the residue from the press bed, in short, there is no need to enumerate many trivial matters here, which strengthened his desire for power and his desire to succeed. ten times. Like all ambitious people, he vowed to earn everything on his own. But his character is clearly the character of a southerner: he is indecisive when he is put into practice, and his idea is wavered, as if a young man is in the middle of the ocean, not knowing which way to go or what angle to connect the sail. First, he wanted to work hard, and then he felt the need to socialize and socialize. He realized that women had a great influence on social life, and suddenly wanted to join the society in order to conquer a few women who could be his backstage. A young man with enthusiasm for nurturing talent, coupled with Ni Fengliu's appearance, and the kind of masculine beauty that can easily teach women to be fascinated, is he still worried about finding such a woman? He kept turning these thoughts while walking in the field. He used to hang out with his sisters completely carefree, but now they think he has changed drastically. His first mother, Mrs. Massia, also visited the palace and met a group of leaders of the nobles. The ambitious young man suddenly remembered that in the memories his aunt often told him, there were many opportunities for him to show his prominence in society, which was at least as important as his achievements in law school; he questioned his aunt, who were still What kind of relatives are the people who can get a relationship? The old lady thought about the various branches of the genealogy, and thought that among all the selfish relatives, Viscount de Bousayone was probably the easiest to associate with. She wrote a letter in the old-school style to Eugene, saying that if she could get close to the viscountess, she would help him find other relatives. A few days after returning to Paris, Rastignac sent a letter from his aunt to Madame de Boussaion, who sent an invitation to the dance party the next day in lieu of a reply letter. \\n 　　The above is the general situation in the apartment at the end of November 1819. A few days later, Eugene attended Mrs. Bossaion’s ball and went home at about two in the morning. In order to make up for the lost time, the courageous college students danced and vowed to go back to drive the night train. He was going to stay up all night in this silent area for the first time. He thought he was energetic, but he was actually just the urge to see the luxurious scene. He did not dine at Mrs. Fuguet’s house that night. The people who lived together thought he was going to come back at dawn, as if he went to the Plato or Odion several times. The stockings were splashed with mud and the patent leather shoes were out of order. Home. Before closing the gate, Kristoff opened the door and looked into the street. Rastignac hurried back just then and went upstairs quietly, but Christophe, who followed him upstairs, made a lot of noise. Eugene entered the bedroom, unloaded, put on soft shoes, reported a torn coat, clicked on the source charcoal, and hurriedly prepared to work hard. Christopher's heavy feet were not over yet, and they overwhelmed the slight noise of the young man. \\n 　　Eugene didn't start studying, but thought for a while. He saw that the Viscountess de Bousayone was one of the ladies in charge, and her house was considered holy. The most pleasant place in the Germanic area ③. In terms of family and property, she was also a leader of aristocratic society. Relying on the power of Aunt Te Marcia, this poor student was actually given preferential treatment from the Bao House, but I don't know how effective this preferential treatment is. Being able to show up in those magnificent living rooms is equivalent to a certificate from a family of paper lovers. Once stepped into this place, which is harder to enter than any society, you can pass everywhere without any hindrance. The mane light and barium shadow in the event made his eyes dizzy; he and the Viscountess had only been cold for a few decades, and then among the Parisian goddesses who were vying to go to the party, they found a young man who taught young people to fall in love at first sight. woman. Anastasily. The Countess of Lechtoire was well-born and tall, and was known as one of the best-looking beauties in Paris. A pair of big black eyes, beautiful hands, a kind of foot, and passionate flames between her actions; such a woman, according to the Marquis de Longeiro, is a thoroughbred horse. The pungent breath did not affect her beauty; her waist was plump and round and not obese. Thoroughbred horses, noble beauties, these idioms have begun to replace the angels in the sky, the fairy-like faces, and the old myths about love that the new boy brothers have long spurned. In Rastignac's mind, Mrs. Anastazit Risteau is simply a charming woman. He thought of registering on her fan twice, and he had the opportunity to say to her during the first four-group dance: \\n 　　\\\"Where will I meet you in the future, madam?\\\" The enthusiasm between words is what women like most. \\n 　　\\\"Forest, comedy theater, my house, everywhere is fine;\\\" she replied. \\n 　　So this southern adventurer, within the range of possible contact in a four-group dance or waltz dance, tried his best to deal with this breathtaking countess. As soon as it was stated that he was the cousin of Mrs. Te Bossaão, the lady in his mind immediately invited him and said that he could go to her house to play at any time. The last time she smiled at him, he felt that the visit was indispensable. Among the guests were the famous and presumptuous men at the time, such as Morengu, Longgro, Maxine Tetrai, Te Marseille, Ajuda Bindo, and Wang Tenes, all pretentious. The generations of Xianhe I, they all hung out with the most elegant women, such as the Madame Blanco, the Duchess of Longe, the Countess of Tegan and the Countess of Roais, the Lady of Te Serizzi, and the Te Garyry. The Duchess of Arnault, the Countess of Fallo, the Lady of Te Lanti, the Marquis of Te Aegelemont, the Lady of Firmiani, the Marquis of Te Leistorman, the Marquis of Te Esbah, the Te. Duchess of Morfrey, Madame Grandian. On these occasions, young people's jokes made by Yan out of the world are the worst. Rastignac met not a man who mocked his ignorance, but the lover of the Duchess of Longe, special. The Marquis of Montréal, a child-like general, told him special. The Countess of Résto lived on Helte Street. \\n 　　---------------------------------------------- \\n 　　①Gasge Difan is a noun classified in natural history. \\n 　　②Pradou is the name of the ballroom. It is located opposite the Supreme Court. It was demolished in 1855. \\n 　　③The residential area of ​​the first-class nobles at that time. \\n 　　④At the time, it was customary for dance parties. When a man asked a woman to dance together, he had to make an appointment. The woman would register on a fan and take turns in turn. \\n 　　⑤Forest is the abbreviation for the suburb of Plogne Forest, a recreational attraction for the upper class in Paris. \\n 　　At a young age, eager to enter the upper class, and want to make a woman like a famine. Seeing that the high-ranking family has opened up two ways: in Saint. The Germanic region can step into the special. The house of the Viscountess Bousayão can be entered and exited at the house of the Countess of Trésto in the Tanga District! I saw a series of Paris salons at a glance. I thought I was quite handsome, enough to win the favor of a woman and get her help and shelter! He also thinks that he is ambitious, like a man who sells skills, walks on the rope peacefully, flies his thighs for a wonderful performance, and regards a charming woman as the best balance bar to support his center of gravity! With these thoughts in her mind, the woman seemed to stand tall by his charcoal fire, standing between the law and poverty; in this situation, who could not think about her own future like Eugene , Who can embellish the future without the illusion of success? He was thinking wildly, feeling that his future happiness would be pretty sure, and he even thought he was already beside Mrs. Terredo; unexpectedly, he suddenly sighed in the quiet night, and Eugene heard the sputum that he almost thought it was a patient. . He opened the door gently, walked into the tunnel, and caught a glimpse of a ray of light under the door of Old Man Gao; he was afraid that his neighbor might be sick, so he leaned into the keyhole and looked at him. Unexpectedly, what the old man did was very suspicious. Eugene felt that it should be for public safety. Take a look at the self-proclaimed noodle merchant's work in the middle of the night. It turned out that Old Man Gao put a table upside down, tied a gilded plate and something like a soup bowl to the crosspiece of the table, and used a thick rope to twist the crafted utensils, tightening his life. , It seems to be twisted into gold bars. The old man was silent, twisting the gold-plated silverware with the help of a rope with his bulging arms, like kneading flour. \\n 　　\\\"Yo! Good fellow!\\\" Rastignac thought privately, standing up for a while. \\\"Is he a booby or a stolen? Is he deliberately pretending to be crazy and acting like a beggar in order to cover people's eyes and ears?\\\". \\n 　　The college student put his eyes on the keyhole again, and saw Old Man Gao untie the rope, take the super silver block, and spread a blanket on the table, put the silver block on it and rolled it into a strip very neatly. When the note was about to be rolled, Eugena thought to himself: \\\"Is he as strong as the Polish king Augustus?\\\" \\n 　　Old man Gao looked at his work sadly, dropped a few tears, and blew out the candles. , Lay on the bed and sighed. \\n 　　Eugene paid privately: \\\"He is crazy.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Poor boy!\\\" Old Man Gao called out suddenly. \\n 　　Hearing this sentence, Rastignac thought it was better to keep quiet about this matter, and felt that he should not pretend to conclude that his neighbor was a bad person. He was about to return to the room when he heard an indescribable voice, probably a few people in cloth-soled shoes going up the stairs. Eugene listened closely, and indeed there were two people breathing differently. There was neither the door opening nor the sound of footsteps. Suddenly a gleam of light leaked from the room on the third floor. \\n 　　\\\"There are so many weird things in an apartment!\\\" He walked down a few levels while thinking, and there was a voice of foreign money. Suddenly, the light went out, and there was no sound of opening the door, but the breathing of two people was heard again. They went downstairs slowly, and their voices also lowered. \\n 　　\\\"Who is it?\\\" Mrs. Fugue asked, opening the bedroom window. \\n 　　\\\"It's me who came back, Mother Fugue,\\\" Futrulen replied loudly. \\n 　　\\\"It's weird!\\\" Eugene returned to the room and thought. \\\"Christopher obviously closed the door to the sun. I really had to stay up all night in Paris to figure out what was going on around him.\\\" \\n 　　These little things interrupted his fantasy about love, and he began to work hard. However, he was suspicious of Old Man Gao at first, and his mind was disturbed, and what was more disturbing was that the big face of Te Leiche appeared from time to time, like a messenger foretelling luck; as a result, he went to bed and fell asleep. Young people want to study hard at night, and nine out of ten nights are done in sleep. To stay up late, you must be over twenty years old. \\n 　　The next morning, Paris was thickly foggy, covering the city, and even the most punctual people got the time wrong. All the business appointments went wrong. It was 12 o'clock at noon, and everyone thought it was 8 o'clock. At half past nine, Mrs. Fuguet hadn't moved on the bed. Christopher and Fat Sylvie were also late and were drinking their coffee for a while, with a layer of cream that had been picked up from the tenant's milk. Sylvie put the milk on the fire and boiled it thoroughly, teaching Mrs. Fuguet that they could not see the traces of the oil. \\n 　　Christophe dipped the first piece of toast in the coffee and said, \\\"Hey, Sylvie, you know, Mr. Vautrin is a good man; two more guests came to see him last night. Madam must be suspicious. , Don’t mention a word of it.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Did he give you anything?\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Five francs, count as the reward for this month, meaning that I will not say anything.\\\" \\n 　　Sylvie replied: \\\"Except that he and Mrs. Gu were willing to spend money, all the others wanted to give it with their right hand in the New Year and take \\n 　　their left hand back!\\\" \\\"Humph! God knows what they gave!\\\" Christophe continued. \\\"At least a piece of foreign money, five francs! Old man Gao has been polishing his shoes for two years. Poalé's petty guy doesn't use shoe polish at all, probably he would rather swallow it in his belly rather than wear his torn boots. As for the thin college student, He only gave two francs. Two francs were not enough for me to buy shoe brushes, and he sold his old clothes when he came. It's really a worthless place!\\\" \\n 　　Sylvie drank coffee one hour and the other said, \\\"it has to be said. Come back, we are pretty good job in this area. Hey, Christophe, has anyone told you anything about Mr. Vautrin?\\\" \\n 　　------------- ------------------------------ \\n 　　①Heart Street, the upstart residential area at that time, was in this area. Second rotation. \\n 　　②Forest is the abbreviation of the suburbs of Plogne Forest, a recreational attraction for the upper class in Paris. \\n 　　\\\"Why not! A gentleman on the street said to me a few days ago: Is there a fat man with black temples in your place?-I replied: No, sir. He didn't dye his temples. He did. People who love to be happy don’t have this trouble. I told Mr. Vautrin, and he said; man, you dealt with it well! Let’s talk about it in the future. The most annoying is to let others know our shortcomings and marry Isn't it troublesome to get married?\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Someone also coaxed me at the vegetable market to know if I saw him wearing a shirt. Do you want to be funny or not!\\\" Sylvie suddenly turned his head and said, \\\"Yo! Hua Te Ge It's a \\n 　　quarter past nine in Racha , and no one has moved yet.\\\" \\\"Ah, hello! They are all out. The old lady and her little girl went to Saint at eight o'clock, and Dantian went to God. Old man Gao carried a small bag into the street. The college students did not come back after class at ten o’clock. I watched them go out while I was cleaning the stairs; I also hit Old Man Gao’s parcel, which was as hard as iron. This old man What the hell are you doing? Others are playing tricks on him, like a spinning top. People are nice and better than them. He doesn't give any money, but where I send letters to him, the wife gave him a lot of money and clothes. Also dressed beautifully.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Are they the daughters he was talking about, eh? There are a dozen of them, right?\\\" \\n 　　\\\"I've only been to two places, the two who have been here.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"The wife is up; she'll be yelling all at once. , I should go up. Watch out for the milk, Christopher, watch the cat.\\\" \\n 　　Sylvie walked into the mistress's room. \\n 　　\\\"What? Sylvie, it's a quarter to ten, you let me sleep like a dead person! It's never happened!\\\" \\n 　　\\\"It's thick fog, so thick that it can't be split with a knife.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"What about lunch? a? \\\"① \\n 　　\\\" vomit! those tenants are a ghost, a too long to get out of. \\\" \\\" \\n 　　speak clearly, Sylvia. It should be said that a too early. \\\" \\\" \\n 　　Oh! too, how you want me to say It’s okay. You have food at ten o’clock. Mischino and Poale have not moved. Only the two of them are at home, sleeping like pigs.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Sylvie, you put them together and talk about it.\\\" , It seems...\\\" \\n 　　\\\"What does it seem?\\\" Sylvie laughed loudly. \\\"Aren't two a pair?\\\" \\n 　　\\\"It's weird, Sylvie, last night Christophe closed the door to the sun, how can Mr. Vautrin come in?\\\" \\n 　　\\\"No, ma'am. He heard Mr. Vautrin come back? ., go on as you open the door ...... \\\"\\\" give me the short jacket, quickly go and get the rest of the meal lamb add some sweet potato;.. dessert with pears cooked, pick two mites ② of a \\\" \\n 　　too After a while, Mrs. Fuguet went downstairs, and her cat had just lifted the hood and licked the milk hurriedly. \\n 　　\\\"Mistigli!\\\" she yelled, and the cat ran away and came back to fight her legs. \\\"Okay, okay, you suck up, you old beast!\\\" \\n 　　She went on to \\n 　　say : \\\"Sylvie! Sylvie!\\\" \\\"Suck, hey, what's the matter, ma'am?\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Look, how much did the cat drunk? !\\\" \\n 　　\\\"It’s all bad Christophe. I told him to set the table. Where did he go? Don’t worry, ma’am; pour that milk into Old Man Go’s coffee. Let me flush some water, he doesn’t Will find out. He doesn't care about anything, he doesn't even know what to eat.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Where did he go, this monster?\\\" Mrs. Fugue asked with her plate. \\n 　　\\\"Who knows? \\n 　　I'm probably dealing with the devil.\\\" \\\"I slept too much,\\\" said Mrs. Yoga. \\n 　　\\\"But madam, you are as fresh as a rose...\\\" \\n 　　------------------------------------ ------- \\n 　　①At that time, lunch was eaten earlier than it is now, about eleven o’clock (see Piernan's \\\"Daily Life in France in the 1830s\\\"), but the habit of Ugai’s apartment is better than lunch. Generally earlier. \\n 　　②The so-called small coin is an old French copper coin whose value is equal to a quarter of a copper yu (Sou). \\n 　　When the doorbell rang, Vautrulen sang loudly, and walked into the living room: \\n 　　I have traveled all over the world for a long time, and \\n 　　people see me everywhere... \\n 　　\\\"Oh! Oh! Good morning, Mother Fuguay,\\\" he greeted the landlord again. Hug her affectionately. \\n 　　\\\"Hey, let go.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Why don't you talk about being presumptuous!\\\" he replied. \\\"Say, say I'm presumptuous! Oh, oh, let me set the table for you. Look how good I am!... \\n 　　Hook up with the brunette and blonde girl, \\n 　　love it for a while and sigh... \\n 　　\\\"I just saw a strange thing ..., it's all accidental...\\\" the \\n 　　widow said: \\\"What's the matter? \\\" \\n 　　Old man Gao was on Prince Street at 8:30, took a set of gilded tableware, walked into a silversmith's shop that bought old food utensils and epaulettes, and sold it for a good price. Thanks to the people who don't eat this kind of food, the slivers twisted out are very decent. \\\" \\n 　　\\\" Really? \\\" \\n 　　\\\"Of course it's true. I have a guy who went out and sent him back in the mail van. I saw Old Man Gao and wanted to see what was going on. He went back to Glen Street in this district and walked in and put the money. Gobsack’s family; you know Gobsack is a terrific villain, a guy who will dice his old man’s back! He’s really a Jew, Abib, Greek, Bohemian, huh, You don't want to grab his money, he puts all the foreign money in the bank.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"So what is the old man doing? \\n 　　\\\" , \\\"What is it for?\\\" Eat up! Vautrin replied. \\\"This idiot doesn't take advantage of bankruptcy to love those bitches...\\\" \\n 　　\\\"He's here!\\\" Sylvie cried. \\n 　　\\\"Christopher, come up,\\\" Old \\n 　　Man Go greeted the servant. Christophe followed Old Man Go upstairs and suddenly came down. \\n 　　\\\"Where are you going?\\\" Asked Mrs. Fuguet. \\n 　　\\\"Run for Mr. Golio. \\\"' \\n 　　\\\"What is it?\\\" Vautrin said, snatching r envelopes from Christophe, and said: Send Countess Anastazit Ristor. He returned the letter to Christophe and asked: \\\" Where to send it? \\\" \\n 　　\\\" Geert Street. He ordered that the countess must be met in person. \\\" \\n 　　What's in it?\\\" \\\"Vuteleng said, shining the letter in the light, \\\"Banknotes?\\\" no. \\\"He opened the envelope a bit: \\\"Oh, it's a loan for debt settlement.\\\" Hey! This old fairy is loyal! \\\"He stretched out his big hand and touched Christophe's hair, turning his body like a dice a few times, \\\"Go, bad stuff, you're good for a few more drinks.\\\" \\\" \\n 　　Knives, forks, cups and plates are already set. Sylvie is boiling milk. Mrs. Fuguet is setting up the stove, and Futlan is helping out, humming: \\n 　　I have ordered the world for a long time, and \\n 　　people see me everywhere... \\n 　　everything is ready Stopped, Mrs. Gu and Miss Taiyipan are back. \\n 　　\\\"Where have you been so early, beautiful lady?\\\" \\\"Mrs. Fuguet asked. \\n 　　\\\"We are praying in the church of Saint-Dante. Don't we go to Mr. Teifan's house today? The poor child is trembling like a leaf,\\\" said the ancient lady, sitting in front of the stove with her saddle at the door of the fire. Smoke came up. \\n 　　\\\"Come on to the fire, Victory,\\\" said Mrs. Fuguet. \\n 　　\\\"Miss,\\\" Vautrin offered her a chair, \\\"It's good to ask God to change your father's mind, but it's not enough. You have to have a friend to teach this ugly monster to wake up his head. I heard that this barbaric has something on hand. three million, but why would not give you a minute dowry. this years, a child beauty is indispensable dowry. \\\" \\\" \\n 　　poor child, \\\"Mrs. V Interface cover,\\\" you are not afraid of retribution that the devil I do? \\\" \\n 　　a With these words, Victory's eyes were wet; Mrs. Yogay saw Mrs. Gu wave his hand at her, and said nothing. \\n 　　The quartermaster’s widow continued: “As long as I can meet him, talk to him, and give him his wife’s suicide note, that’s all. I never dare to risk sending it from the post office; he recognizes my handwriting... …\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Oh! Those innocent women, suffering from disasters and bullying,\\\" Vautrin yelled, and suddenly stopped, and said, \\\"You are in this field now! Let me take care of this in a few days. Account, you are satisfied.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Oh, sir,\\\" Victory said, and gave Vautrin a timid and enthusiastic look. Vautrin was unmoved. \\\"If you have a way to see my father, please tell him that I value my father’s love and mother’s reputation as more valuable than all the treasures in the world. If you can persuade him to change his heart and stone, I want to Pray for you in front of God, I must be grateful...\\\" \\n 　　\\\"I have traveled all over the world for a long time...\\\" Vautrin sang in a sarcastic tone. \\n 　　At this moment Golio, Miss Mischino, Poale, all went downstairs, maybe they all smelled the gravy, which Sylvie made to pour the lamb overnight. The seven people living together were greeting each other, sitting around the table, the clock struck ten o'clock, and the footsteps of college students rang outside the door. \\n 　　\\\"Warm, all right, Mr. Eugene,\\\" Sylvie said. \\\"Today you can have dinner with everyone.\\\" The \\n 　　college student greeted the cohabitation and sat down beside Old Man Gao. \\n 　　\\\"I had an unexpected adventure today,\\\" he said, slicing some lamb and cutting a piece of bread-Mrs. Fuguet was there to estimate the size of the bread. \\n 　　\\\"Adventure!\\\" Poale shouted. \\n 　　\\\"Hey! What are you making a fuss about, old fool?\\\" Vautrin said to Poale. \\\"Is he not worthy of the old man?\\\" \\n 　　Miss Taiyifan gave the college student a timid look. \\n 　　Mrs. \\n 　　Fouquet said, \\\"Tell us about your adventures.\\\" \\\"Yesterday I went to the ball of the Viscountess de Bousayão. She was my cousin. There was a magnificent house, and every room was paved. Full of silk and satin. She held a grand dance party and made me happy like an emperor...\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Like a siskin,\\\" Vautrin interrupted him. \\n 　　\\\"Sir,\\\" Eugene asked 　　angrily , \\\"what do you mean?\\\" \\n 　　\\\"I said the cardinal, because the \\n cardinal is much happier than the emperor.\\\" Poalai said, \\\"Yes, I'd rather be a scholar. \\n 　　Carefree siskin , don’t be emperor, because...\\\" \\\"Anyway,\\\" the college student intercepted Poale’s words, \\\"I danced with the most beautiful lady in the ball, a charming countess, really , I’ve never seen a beauty like that. She has peach blossoms on her head, “The best flower balls on her breasts are all fragrant flowers; Ah Qing! I really want you to see it with your own eyes. A woman dances and dances.” It's hard to draw and describe. Oh! I saw this fairy-like countess walking down Glen Street at nine o'clock this morning. Oh! My heart is beating, I thought--\\\" \\n 　　\\\"I thought she Come here, eh?\\\" Futrulen took a deep look at the college student. \\\"Actually, she is looking for the old man Gobsack who put the stamp money. If you take it in the heart of a Parisian woman, you will see the creditor first, and then the lover. Your countess is called Anastazit. ·Resto, lives in Helte Street.\\\" Upon \\n 　　hearing the name, the college student stared at Vautrin. Old man Gao started his head abruptly and glanced at them both, his bright and anxious eyes made everyone look strange. \\\"Christopher is a step late, she's been there,\\\" Golio said to himself in annoyance. \\n 　　\\\"I guessed it,\\\" Futrulen bit Mrs. Fuguet's ear. \\n 　　The old man Gao Huli was eating silly, he didn't know what he was eating; he was silly and absent-minded to such an extent that he had never had it before. \\n 　　Eugene asked: \\\"Mr. Vautrin, who told you her name?\\\" \\n 　　Vautrin replied: \\\"Warm! Warm! Since Old \\n 　　Man Gao would know, why can't I know?\\\" \\\"What! Mr. Golio \\\"\\\" the college student cried. \\n 　　\\\"Really? Was she beautiful last night?\\\" the poor old man asked. \\n 　　\\\"Who?\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Mrs. Terredo.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Look how bright this old man's eyes are,\\\" said Fugueta to Futruen. \\n 　　\\\"Does he raise that woman?\\\" Miss Mixuno asked the college student in a low voice. \\n 　　\\\"Oh! Yes, she is so beautiful,\\\" Eugene replied to Old Man Gao, who looked at him enviously. \\\"If it weren't for Mrs. T. Bousayão, the fairy-like countess would be the queen of the audience; the young man’s eyes were only fixed on her, and I was already the twelfth place on her registration form. There has never been a four-group dance without her, and the narrator woman is angry. Yesterday she was indeed the most proud person. As the saying goes: the beauty of the world is nothing more than a giant ship with full sails, a galloping horse, and a beautiful woman dancing. That's not bad.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"In the high hall of the Jubilee Palace yesterday, and under the feet of the creditor this morning, this is the true nature of a Parisian woman,\\\" said Vautrin. \\\"If the husband can't afford them to squander, they will betray themselves. Or they will break their mother's belly and use it to show off. In short, they can do all kinds of weird things. Alas, some are, some are!\\\" \\n 　　Hearing what the college students said, Old Man Gao frowned, like a sunny sun, and immediately sank his face when he heard You Tuoleng's harsh comments. \\n 　　Mrs. Fugue said, \\\"You haven't said your adventure yet. Did you talk to her just now? Would she like to teach you the law?\\\" \\n 　　Eugene said: \\\"She didn't see me; but at nine o'clock, she ran into a beauty in Paris who was the most beautiful in Paris. Isn't it weird that she went home after dancing at two o'clock in the morning? Only in Paris. \\n 　　This is the weird thing.\\\" \\\"Scared! There are more weird things than this,\\\" Vautrin exclaimed. \\n 　　Miss Teifan didn't pay attention to what they were saying, only thinking about what she was going to try later. Mrs. Gu gave her a wink and taught her to change clothes. As soon as the two of them left, Old Man Gao also followed. \\n 　　\\\"Hey, did you see it?\\\" Mrs. Fuguet said to Futruen and the rest of the tenants. \\\"He obviously made those wives poor.\\\" The \\n 　　college student cried, \\\"I don't believe that the beautiful countess is the mistress of the old man Gao.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"We didn't want you to believe it,\\\" Vautrin stopped him. if. \\\"You are too young to be familiar with Paris. Slowly you will know that you have a so-called infatuated man...\\\" \\n 　　(Miss Mixuno listened to this sentence and looked at Vautrin with knowingly, imitation war horse heard it. Horn.) \\n 　　\\\"Hey! Hey!\\\" Futoleng stopped for a moment, and gave her a deep look, \\\"Have we never had a little infatuation?...\\\" \\n 　　(The old girl lowered her eyes, as if seeing a female monk. To the nude statue.) \\n 　　Vautrin said again: \\\"Furthermore, those people, as soon as they have an idea, they hold on to it. They only think that the water from the well is often stinky; in order to drink the stinky water, they are willing to betray their wives. , A child, or sell his soul to the devil. In some people, this well is a casino, an exchange, collecting ancient paintings, collecting insects, or music; in others, it may be a good job The woman of food. All the women in the world don’t care, they just want to satisfy their own wind and devil. Often the woman doesn’t love them at all, fierce and fierce, and teaches them to pay a high price for a little satisfaction. Alas. Alas! When those fools are not tired, they will send the last bed into the longevity treasury and exchange a few last money to honor her. Old man Gao is the class. The countess exploited him because he didn’t. This is called high society! The poor old man only thinks of her. As soon as you see it with your own eyes, he is a stupid beast. When he mentions his door, his eyes are bright, like Diamond diamonds. The secret is easy to guess. This morning he sent the gilded plates into the silversmith's shop, and I watched him go up to the old man Gobsack’s house on Glen Street. Look at his text again. Back here, he teaches Klee Stoff sent a letter to Mrs. Terrestau, and we all saw the address on the envelope, which contained a loan for debt settlement. If the countess had also been to the money-lending house, it was obvious that the situation was urgent. Old man Gao is very generous to pay her debts. We don’t need much association, let’s see clearly. Tell you, young college students, when your countess laughs and dances, scratches her head and poses, spreading her peach blossoms, pointy When Bao's fingers were holding the corners of the skirt, \\\"She is like the saying goes, with her big feet in her little shoes, thinking about her or her lover's, and the loan ticket that can't be paid by the due date.\\\" \\n 　　Eugene Exclaimed: \\\"If you say that, I have to make things clear. Tomorrow I will go to Mrs. \\n 　　Te Restau 's house.\\\" \\\"Yes,\\\" Poale said. Mrs. Resto’s house.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Maybe you will meet Old Man Gao and let his love go there to collect the accounts!\\\" \\n 　　Eugene said in disgust: \\\"Why your Paris is actually a garbage pit.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"And it's a weird garbage pit,\\\" Vautrin continued. \\\"Anyone who is covered in mud and sitting in the car is a gentleman, and everyone who is covered in mud and walking with two legs is a villain. Pickpocketing anything, you can take it to the court square for an exhibition, everyone Look at you as a trick. If you steal a million, you will be said to be a great virtue in the social field. You spend 30 million to raise the military police and judicial personnel to maintain this kind of morality. It is wonderful!\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Why, \\\"Mrs. Fuguet interrupted, \\\"Old \\n 　　Man Gou melted his gilded tableware?\\\" \\\" Are there two pigeons on the lid?\\\" Eugene asked. \\n 　　\\\"Yes.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Probably it was his beloved thing,\\\" Eugene said. \\\"He cried when he destroyed the bowl and plate. I saw it accidentally.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"That was what he thought of it. Life is average,\\\" the widow replied. \\n 　　\\\"Do you see how infatuated this guy is?\\\" Futoleng cried, \\\"That woman is so obsessed that his heart is itchy.\\\" The \\n 　　college student went upstairs, and Futoleng went out. After a while, Mrs. Gu and Victory got into the carriage that Sylvie had called. Poale assisted Miss Mischino and went to the botanical garden to spend the two most comfortable hours of the day. \\n 　　\\\"Oh! It doesn't look like they are married?\\\" Fatty Sylvie said. \\\"Today they are going out together for the first time. Both of them have dry ears, and they will burst into sparks when they touch each other, like flint and steel.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Miss Mixuno really needs to be careful of her shawl,\\\" Mrs. Fuguet smiled, \\\"Otherwise it will burn like moxa.\\\" At \\n 　　four o'clock, Golio came back and saw Victory with red eyes under the two smoky oil lamps. Fugueta listened to them as they went to see Mr. Taiyfan's fruitless situation during the day. Because he was entangled with his daughter and this old lady, he finally agreed to meet him so that he could make it clear to them. \\n 　　\\\"Good wife,\\\" Mrs. Gu said to Mrs. Fuguet, \\\"Do you want it? He didn't even teach Victory to sit, and let her stand there from start to finish. To me, he didn't get angry, but it was cold. Said coldly to me, I don’t have to go to his door anymore; I said that the lady (not to mention his daughter) is more troublesome with him, (it is troublesome once a year, this devil!) The more annoying him; and Vidor Li's mother was not married at the beginning, so she couldn't ask for anything; anyway, many cruel words made the poor girl cry like tears. She threw herself at her father's feet and bravely said that her hard work was only for her mother. She was willing to obey her father’s will and did not dare to complain at all, but begged him to read the deceased mother’s will. So she submitted the letter and said the most gentle and sincere words in the world. I don’t know where she learned it, it must be God’s enlightenment, because the poor child said so affectionately, everyone in my office cried out. How can I think of Lao Wujun hinged his nails, picked up the tearful letter of the poor Mrs. Teifan, and looked at the fireplace. Li Yi tossed and said: Okay! He wanted to help his daughter who was kneeling on the ground, and when he saw her holding his hand to kiss, he immediately retracted. You see how bad he is! His pussy son ran in and treated him. My sister ignored it.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Are they beasts?\\\" Golio interjected. \\n 　　\\\"Later,\\\" Mrs. Gu did not pay attention to Old Man Gao's sigh, \\\"The father and son nodded to me and left, saying that there was something important. This is how we visited today. At least, he met his daughter. I don't understand. How could he deny her, father and daughter look like two drops of water.\\\" The \\n 　　meal catering and boarding guests came one after another, greeted each other and said some silly nonsense. In some societies in Paris, this kind of nonsense, coupled with weird pronunciation and gestures, even if ridiculous, is mainly ridiculous. Such sayings are often changing, and the jokes used as the basis will not be heard in less than a month. Political incidents, criminal cases, minor incidents in the street, and actor's gag can all be used as materials for this kind of game, throwing thoughts and words around like badminton. A newly invented plaything called Diorama (diorama) takes the optical illusion one step further than the panorama; some studios use this to play haha, no matter what you say, Yuwei always adds a lama ( rama). There was a young painter who was making meals in Fugai's apartment and brought this joke. \\n 　　\\\"Ah, hello! Mr. Poale,\\\" said the steward of the museum, \\\"what's the matter with your healthy lama?\\\" Before he could answer, he said to Mrs. Gu and Victory, \\\"Ladies, you feel uncomfortable, isn't it? \\\" \\n 　　Is it going to start soon?\\\" Horace Pianxun asked. He is a medical student and a friend of Rastignac. \\\"My baby's stomach is about to fall to the bottom of my feet.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"It's so cold as Lama!\\\" Votrulen cried. \\\"Let's give in, old man Gao. Damn! Your feet have taken the fire door.\\\" \\n 　　Pi Anxun said: \\\"The famous Mr. Vautrin, why do you say that it is too cold? That's not right. It should be said that the lama is terribly cold.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"No,\\\" said the steward of the museum, \\\"it should be said that the lama is cold, which means that my feet are cold.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Ah! Ah! That's the case!\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Hey! Rastignac Your Excellency Marquis, the nonsense Doctor of Law is here,\\\" Pi Anzhou yelled while hugging Eugene's neck, teaching him to breathe, \\\"Oh! Hi! Everyone, oh! Enzyme!\\\" \\n 　　Mischino The young lady came in gently, nodded to everyone without saying a word, and sat next to the three wives. \\n 　　\\\"I shuddered as soon as I saw her, this old bat,\\\" Pi Anxun whispered to Vautrin, pointing to Mixuno. \\\"I studied Ying Er's osteophysical physiology, and found out that she has Judas's rebellious bones.\\\" \\n 　　-------------------------------- ----------------- \\n 　　① Ying Er (1758-1828), a German doctor, pioneered osteophysical studies. \\n 　　\\\"Does your husband know Judas?\\\" Vautrin asked. \\n 　　\\\"Who hasn't met Judas?\\\" Pi Anxun replied. \\\"I bet that this bloodless old girl is just like those long worms, and beams will bore them.\\\" Vautrin 　　took \\n 　　care of his temples and said, \\\"This is called, child, \\n that rose. Like all roses, it \\n 　　only bloomed one morning.\\\" \\n 　　Seeing Christophe respectfully carrying the soup bowl out, Poale shouted: \\n 　　\\\"Ah! Ah! The excellent lama soup is here.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"I'm sorry, sir,\\\" said Mrs. Fuguet , \\\"that's vegetable soup. \\\" \\n 　　All the young people laughed loudly. \\n 　　\\\"Lost, Poaléle!\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Poalélele has lost !\\\" \\\"Mother Fuguet scored \\n 　　two points,\\\" said Vautrelen . \\n 　　The steward of the museum asked: \\\"Did anyone notice the fog this morning?\\\" \\n 　　Pi Anxun said: \\\"It was a sizzling fog, a miserable fog, a green fog, a melancholy, stuffy, Golio-like fog. \\\" \\n 　　The fog of Lama \\n 　　Golio ,\\\" the painter said, \\\"because of the chaos, you can't see anything.\\\" \\\"Hey, Master Griot, I mentioned you.\\\" \\n 　　Old man Gao sat on the table sideways and approached. The door to serve dishes. He raised his head and put the bread under the napkin close to his nose to smell, \\\"That's an old business habit that he accidentally revealed. \\n 　　\\\"Yeah!\\\" Mrs. Fuguet took a sharp tone, her thick voice covered the spoons, plates, and the voice of conversation, \\\"Is it not good for bread?\\\" \\n 　　\\\"No, ma'am. That used mourning flour,\\\" First class stuff.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Why do you know?\\\" Eugene asked. \\\" \\n 　　By that kind of innocence, by that kind of ignorance.\\\" \\\" \\n 　　With the smell in your nose, since you smell it,\\\" said Mrs. Fuguet. \\\"You can save yourself to the extreme, and one day you can live on the smell of the kitchen alone.\\\" \\\"The \\n 　　museum manager said: \\\"Then you might as well get an invention license, it's better to make a fortune.\\\" \\\"The \\n 　　painter said: \\\"Leave him alone.\\\" He did it just to teach people to believe that he had done the noodle business. \\\" \\n 　　Then,\\\" the museum manager asked again, \\\"your nose is actually a decanter for extracting food essence.\\\" \\\" \\n 　　Steamed—what?\\\" \\\"Pi Anxun asked. \\n 　　\\\" 　　Steamed cake.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Steamer.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Steam.\\\" \\n \\\"Steamed fish.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Steamed buns.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Steamed eggplant.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Steamed cucumber.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Steamed cucumber lama.\\\" \\n 　　These eight answers came from all over the room, like With a burst of laughter, everyone couldn't talk to each other. Old Man Gao looked at the people more and more dumbfounded, as if he wanted to understand a foreign language. \\n 　　\\\"What are you steaming?\\\" he asked Futulan next to him. \\n 　　\\\"Steamed pig's feet, friend!\\\" Vautrin replied, while looking at Golio and patted him on the head, pressing down his hat and blindfolding him. \\n 　　The poor old man was stunned by the unexpected attack, and he remained motionless for a while. Christophe thought he had had the soup, and took his soup bowl. When Old Man Gao lifted his hat and took a spoon to look around, he bumped into the table, causing everyone to burst into laughter. \\n 　　\\\"Sir,\\\" said the old man, \\\"you are so wicked, if you dare to slap my hat again...\\\" \\n 　　\\\"So old man, how about it?\\\" Vautrin stopped him. \\n 　　\\\"Then, you will receive great retribution one day...\\\" \\n 　　\\\" Will you go to hell?\\\" the painter asked, \\\"Or into the dark room where the \\n 　　kid was bad?\\\" \\\"Hey, miss,\\\" Vautrin greeted Victoria. \\\"Why don't you eat? Dad still refuses to give in?\\\" \\n 　　\\\"It's a devil,\\\" Mrs. Gu said. \\n 　　\\\"He has to be reasonable,\\\" Vautrin said. \\n 　　\\\"But,\\\" Eugene, who was sitting very close to Pi Anxun, interrupted, \\\"Miss can file a complaint about eating, because she doesn't eat. Hi! Hi! Look at how old man Gao looked at Miss Victory. \\\"The \\n 　　old man forgot to eat, and just looked at the poor girl; there was real pain on her face, the pain of an abandoned filial daughter. \\n 　　\\\"Good friend,\\\" Eugene whispered to Pi Anzhou, \\\"we have misunderstood Old Man Gao. He is neither a fool nor a lifeless person. Try your osteophysical studies. Tell me your opinion again. Last night I saw him twisting a gilded plate, which was as light as wax; the air on his face at the moment indicated that he was quite emotional. I think his life is too mysterious and worth studying. Don't laugh, Pi Anxun, what I said is serious.\\\" \\n 　　\\\"Needless to say,\\\" Pi Anxun replied, \\\"From a medical point of view, this guy has a pattern; I can dissect him as long as he wants. \\\" \\n 　　No, as long as you measure his head.\\\" \\n \\n\\n　　\\\"Okay, I'm afraid his stupidity will be contagious.\\\" \\n \",\"timestamp\":1640520221,\"title\":\"Balzac \\\"Old Man Gao\\\"\\n\"},\"digest\":\"2kD-9xNt5uL-Gz6_nPq1EQB1mRWHIlKt7HiETNZvxU4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2e5Aa058479AB028392f897f54709171B5e38232\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"I2vPUIqaku6xx5-TPwn8eBXYjD9HJIk7T9dJzAT0cPA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"6zm--kD1KferSScdUVdVxeaPkBzJk-LMU0k8j6u3r8M\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"9xvOrlGLIKMRAFyI0zouWbzONG-T_vvL_zokwjFOskNZ9Ol8jo7gc04co8LRWx7nKZvAANB7sL-Ae3SKtHXrtQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x412e084e111839eca2167732f90fe6ea7b825e3a8189be7751f797e758a88d8f1e300cb230e746f8c81fde18cfe17e3795a8cc9e808ca6bdc9d6045534650a951c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"I2vPUIqaku6xx5-TPwn8eBXYjD9HJIk7T9dJzAT0cPA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"6zm--kD1KferSScdUVdVxeaPkBzJk-LMU0k8j6u3r8M\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"2kD-9xNt5uL-Gz6_nPq1EQB1mRWHIlKt7HiETNZvxU4\"}"
