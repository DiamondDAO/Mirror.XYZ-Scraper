NFT as such then become a concept of innovation whose purchase gives the customer insight into further details needed to develop an idea.\\n\\nWe will create events on Linkedin and other social platforms to attract professionals to become part of the team in this decentralized ecosystem to start presenting their ideas and making various proposals and to create an environment in which they will be able to do what they know best.\\n\\nIn the meantime, we will be performing with our work at the upcoming DFWNY and other digital fashion events to come.\\n\\nTogether textile engineers, composites engineers, technical materials professionals, textile designers, clothing designers, and other similar professionals and digital designers from GDN community will create together NFTs that will create attraction in public, designers, and the science world about our project.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bZFCyxbmznNHQO6Iir_sP.png?height=656&width=782)\\n\\nAfter the introduction to the fashion digital scene, we need to start to work on more usable projects in IRL for Unity SystemGraph uses a node-based approach to model the complex logic typically found in electrical and mechanical systems which can be used to test Intelligent clothing systems that we want to create.\\n\\nThe frst testing we expect to see in the spring of next year.\\n\\n![The figure above shows the temperature of the body and the garment (protective suit of category III) in the climate chamber under conditions T= 32° C, RH= 85%,,  v= 0,5 m/s](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1gzJX-ejNUrc6B_exUrsj.png?height=289&width=1019)\\n\\n From the picture above we see that more adequate solutions are needed when using these protective suits in various extreme conditions (working professionally with virus-infected patients or workers spraying fields with pesticides) and testing in Metaverse lab can greatly contribute to shortening this process of developing intelligent clothing products.\\n\\n![Random Variable digitals for testing](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jgnrtlcNNQwTH0bF1i2eg.png?height=256&width=665)\\n\\nThe figure above shows digital projects that have been created and need further digital testing in Metaverse Lab.\",\"timestamp\":1640087367,\"title\":\"Random Variable blueprint for R&D\"},\"digest\":\"nwWjWtP6Bmaj6hwhr4IMK9Q4aN3QrvsVRRQlpUDuTIw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x07d13646BC89BfF92631A38B839F803b152f606d\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GjFLoNNB0s6NIBfa5ghCs-kGrjDq2AGl0A_wRg1t7No\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gshqBJLJTCsliS0zJpeAZtqA7BEDiUjzpHHoy-vaEYs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"b9xrV2aHFmMmTh7gjhsX8cnXDPvHB3IL3HZzjhOfdIgpVUaSPF2kioOBlFW8fTcCFP87e2amqZZHPYhkhzaZRg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5533ba5da2f51d2fc6f2f66b030170cc46e98901cb11b9ae953f4644e7cba7ed55d70ad714faf6e41905ddfc9c206eac5d9a4cbe9d21e7a4017297dbd744a5691b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GjFLoNNB0s6NIBfa5ghCs-kGrjDq2AGl0A_wRg1t7No\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gshqBJLJTCsliS0zJpeAZtqA7BEDiUjzpHHoy-vaEYs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"nwWjWtP6Bmaj6hwhr4IMK9Q4aN3QrvsVRRQlpUDuTIw\"}"
