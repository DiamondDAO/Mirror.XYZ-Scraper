"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*Ted Lasso* star [Jason Sudeikis](https://deadline.com/tag/jason-sudeikis/) made his *[Saturday Night Live](https://deadline.com/tag/saturday-night-live/)* hosting debut last night, giving the show a “popular cast member returns” ratings bump.\\n\\nLast night’s telecast of *SNL* with host Sudeikis and musical guest Brandi Carlile drew a 3.7 household live + same day rating in the 41 metered local markets and 1.6 in 18-49 in the 22 markets with local people meters. \\n\\nThat was up from last week’s show, hosted by Rami Malek with musical guest Young Thug (3.4, 1.3). It tied in 18-49 and was off by a tenth in households from the highest-rated telecast so far this season, the Oct. 9 episode hosted by Kim Kardashian West with musical guest Halsey (3.8, 1.6).\\n\\n*SNL* is taking a week off, returning with an original on Nov. 6 hosted by *Succession*‘s Kieran Culkin. Ed Sheeran is currently scheduled as musical guest. Sheeran earlier today [announced](https://deadline.com/2021/10/ed-sheeran-covid-19-self-isolating-after-testing-positive-1234861450/) that he is self-isolating after testing positive for Covid-19. It is unclear yet whether that would impact his planned *SNL* performances.\\n\\nOn YouTube, besides  Sudeikis’ [monologue](https://deadline.com/2021/10/snl-jason-sudeikis-opening-monologue-1234861287/), the [Cold Open](https://deadline.com/2021/10/jason-sudeikis-returns-as-joe-biden-saturday-night-live-1234861335/) featuring Sudeikis as Joe Biden and two other skits in which he reprised fan-favorite characters, [The Devil](https://deadline.com/2021/10/snl-weekend-update-jason-sudeikis-the-devil-1234861289/) on Weekend Update and [What Up With That](https://deadline.com/2021/10/what-up-with-that-snl-jason-sudeikis-oscar-isaac-emily-ratajkowski-nicholas-braun-1234861374/), getting the most views so far are Weekend Update’s headline section, Parent-Teacher Conference and Science Room.\",\"timestamp\":1635157142,\"title\":\"Saturday Night Live’ Ratings Rise With Host Jason Sudeikis\"},\"digest\":\"YBVNO25o84DMozWY2s0nyAVbb44VZoM1D7HfaKQMPyE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xdAD957361768B35f30365E92A8C13e24b91Df004\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"De-UQBqF_6zmf-rtPQE94bq3hSKgXOGOqMn0zcBmwzI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zhJ7Mr-atUIjn9Pd3KQzcjHp4fSZ95GWFvRxjXa_fL4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"CZoOPku2JwSDBelSnncG_ttgslPqCUSeRGZcKI562fWhw3HKz6BB2PxfXg6IvJzFaELePJABfQU8VmLNxHCkeg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe0134f7f59b8e811d26e15651204f42667cfa6a8c7edcc19ce0efd2bd868563d721df2a9da57f79d1da8c99dcb4cc7f1f66dccde3a9ba230f1cdb91df8745bc21b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"De-UQBqF_6zmf-rtPQE94bq3hSKgXOGOqMn0zcBmwzI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zhJ7Mr-atUIjn9Pd3KQzcjHp4fSZ95GWFvRxjXa_fL4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"YBVNO25o84DMozWY2s0nyAVbb44VZoM1D7HfaKQMPyE\"}"
