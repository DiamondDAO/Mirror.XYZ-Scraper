"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Tulpins mentions a person who had a sponge shut up in his thoracic cavity for six weeks; it was then voided by the mouth, and the man recovered. Fabricius Hildanus relates a similar instance in which a sponge-tent was expelled by coughing. Arnot reports a case in which a piece of iron was found in a cyst in the thorax, where it had remained for fourteen years. Leach gives a case in which a bullet was impacted in the chest for forty-two years. Snyder speaks of a fragment of knife-blade which was lodged in the chest twelve years and finally coughed up.\\n\\nForeign Bodies in the Bronchi.--Walnut kernels, coins, seeds, beans, corks, and even sponges have been removed from the bronchi. In the presence of Sir Morrell Mackenzie, Johnston of Baltimore removed a toy locomotive from the subglottic cavity by tracheotomy and thyreotomy. The child had gone to sleep with the toy in his mouth and had subsequently swallowed it. Eldredge presented a hopeless consumptive, who as a child of five had swallowed an umbrella ferrule while whistling through it, and who expelled it in a fit of coughing twenty-three years after. Eve of Nashville mentions a boy who placed a fourpenny nail in a spool to make a whistle, and, by a violent inspiration, drew the nail deep into the left bronchus. It was removed by tracheotomy. Liston removed a large piece of bone from the right bronchus of a woman, and Houston tells of a case in which a molar tooth was lodged in a bronchus causing death on the eleventh day. Warren mentions spontaneous expulsion of a horse-shoe nail from the bronchus of a boy of two and one-half years. From Dublin, in 1844, Houston reports the case of a girl of sixteen who inhaled the wooden peg of a small fiddle and in a fit of coughing three months afterward expelled it from the lungs. In 1849 Solly communicated the case of a man who inhaled a pebble placed on his tongue to relieve thirst. On removal this pebble weighed 144 grains. Watson of Murfreesboro removed a portion of an umbrella rib from a trachea, but as he failed to locate or remove the ferrule, the case terminated fatally. Brigham mentions a child of five who was seized with a fit of coughing while she had a small brass nail in her mouth; pulmonary phthisis ensued, and in one year she died. At the postmortem examination the nail was found near the bifurcation of the right bronchus, and, although colored black, was not corroded.\\n\\nMarcacci reported an observation of the removal of a bean from the bronchus of a child of three and a half years. The child swallowed the bean while playing, immediately cried, and became hoarse. No one having noticed the accident, a diagnosis of croup was made and four leeches were applied to the neck. The dyspnea augmented during the night, and there was a whistling sound with each respiratory movement. On the next day the medical attendants suggested the possibility of a foreign body in the larynx. Tracheotomy was performed but the dyspnea continued, showing that the foreign body was lodged below the incision. The blood of one of the cut vessels entered the trachea and caused an extra paroxysm of dyspnea, but the clots of blood were removed by curved forceps. Marcacci fils practised suction, and placed the child on its head, but in vain. A feather was then introduced in the wound with the hope that it would clean the trachea and provoke respiration; when the feather was withdrawn the bean followed. The child was much asphyxiated, however, and five or six minutes elapsed before the first deep inspiration. The wound was closed, the child recovered its voice, and was well four days afterward. Annandale saw a little patient who had swallowed a bead of glass, which had lodged in the bronchus. He introduced the handle of a scalpel into the trachea, producing sufficient irritation to provoke a brusque expiration, and at the second attempt the foreign body was expelled. Hulke records the case of a woman, the victim of a peculiar accident happening during the performance of tracheotomy, for an affection of the larynx. The internal canule of the tracheotomy-tube fell into the right bronchus, but was removed by an ingenious instrument extemporaneously devised from silver wire. A few years ago in this country there was much public excitement and newspaper discussion over the daily reports which came from the bedside of a gentleman who had swallowed a cork, and which had become lodged in a bronchus. Tracheotomy was performed and a special corkscrew devised to extract it, but unfortunately the patient died of slow asphyxiation and exhaustion. Herrick mentions the case of a boy of fourteen months who swallowed a shawl-pin two inches long, which remained in the lungs four years, during which time there was a constant dry and spasmodic cough, and corresponding depression and emaciation. When it was ultimately coughed up it appeared in one large piece and several smaller ones, and was so corroded as to be very brittle. After dislodgment of the pin there was subsidence of the cough and rapid recovery.\\n\\nLapeyre mentions an elderly gentleman who received a sudden slap on the back while smoking a cigarette, causing him to start and take a very deep inspiration. The cigarette was drawn into the right bronchus, where it remained for two months without causing symptoms or revealing its presence. It then set up a circumscribed pneumonia and cardiac dropsy which continued two months longer, at which time, during a violent fit of coughing, the cigarette was expelled enveloped in a waxy, mucus-like matter. Louis relates the case of a man who carried a louis-d'or in his lung for six and a half years.\\n\\nThere is a case on record of a man who received a gunshot wound, the ball entering behind the left clavicle and passing downward and across to the right clavicle. Sometime afterward this patient expectorated two pieces of bone and a piece of gum blanket in which he was enveloped at the time of the injury. Carpenter describes a case of fatal pleuritis, apparently due to the presence of four artificial teeth which had been swallowed thirteen years before.\\n\\nCardiac Injuries.--For ages it has been the common opinion relative to injuries of the heart that they are necessarily fatal and that, as a rule, death immediately follows their reception. Notwithstanding this current belief a careful examination of the literature of medicine presents an astounding number of cases in which the heart has been positively wounded, and the patients have lived days, months, and even recovered; postmortem examination, by revealing the presence of cicatrices in the heart, confirming the original diagnosis. This question is one of great interest as, in recent years, there has been constant agitation of the possibility of surgical procedures in cardiac as well as cerebral injuries. Del Vecchio has reported a series of experiments on dogs with the conclusion that in case of wounds in human beings suture of the heart is a possible operation. In this connection he proposes the following operative procedure: Two longitudinal incisions to be made from the lower border of the 3d rib to the upper border of the 7th rib, one running along the inner margin of the sternum, the other about ten mm. inside the nipple-line. These incisions are joined by a horizontal cut made in the fourth intercostal space. The 4th, 5th, and 6th ribs and cartilages are divided and the outer cutaneous flaps turned up; pushing aside the pleura with the finger, expose the pericardium and incise it longitudinally; suture the heart-wound by interrupted sutures. Del Vecchio adds that Fischer has collected records of 376 cases of wounds of the heart with a mortality two to three minutes after the injury of 20 per cent. Death may occur from a few seconds to nine months after the accident. Keen and Da Costa quote Del Vecchio, and, in comment on his observations, remark that death in cases of wound of the heart is due to pressure of effused blood in the pericardial sac, and, because this pressure is itself a cheek to further hemorrhage, there seems, as far as hemorrhage is concerned, to be rather a question whether operative interference may not be itself more harmful than beneficial. It might be added that the shock to the cardiac action might be sufficient to check it, and at present we would have no sure means of starting pulsation if once stopped. In heart-injuries, paracentesis, followed, if necessary, by incision of the pericardium, is advised by some surgeons.\\n\\nRealizing the fatality of injuries of the heart, in consequence of which almost any chance by operation should be quickly seized by surgeons rather than trust the lives of patients to the infinitesimal chance of recovery, it would seem that the profession should carefully consider and discuss the feasibility of any procedure in this direction, no matter how hypothetic.\\n\\nHall states that his experience in the study of cardiac wounds, chiefly on game-animals, would lead him to the conclusion that transverse wounds the lower portions of the heart, giving rise to punctures rather than extensive lacerations, do not commonly cause cessation of life for a time varying from some considerable fraction of a minute to many minutes or even hours, and especially if the puncture be valvular in character, so as to prevent the loss of much blood. However, if the wound involve the base of the organ, with extensive laceration of the surrounding parts, death is practically instantaneous. It would seem that injury to the muscular walls of the heart is much less efficient in the production of immediate death than destruction of the cardiac nervous mechanism, serious irritation of the latter producing almost instantaneous death from shock. In addition, Hall cites several of the instances on which he based his conclusions. He mentions two wild geese which flew respectively 1/4 and 3/4 of a mile after having been shot through the heart, each with a pellet of BB shot, the base in each instance being uninjured; in several instances antelope and deer ran several rods after being shot with a rifle ball in a similar manner; on the other hand, death was practically instantaneous in several of these animals in which the base of the heart was extensively lacerated. Again, death may result instantaneously from wounds of the precordial region, or according to Erichsen, if held directly over the heart, from the discharge of a pistol containing powder alone, a result occasionally seen after a blow on the precordial region. It is well, however, to state that in times of excitement, one may receive an injury which will shortly prove fatal, and yet not be aware of the fact for some time, perhaps even for several minutes. It would appear that the nervous system is so highly tuned at such times, that it does not respond to reflex irritations as readily as in the absence of excitement.\\n\\nInstances of Survival after Cardiac Injuries.--We briefly cite the principal interesting instances of cardiac injuries in which death has been delayed for some time, or from which the patient ultimately recovered.\\n\\nPare relates the case of a soldier who received a blow from a halberd, penetrating the left ventricle, and who walked to the surgeon's tent to have his wound dressed and then to his own tent 260 yards away. Diemerbroeck mentions two instances of long survival after cardiac injuries, in one of which the patient ran 60 paces after receiving the wound, had complete composure of mind, and survived nine days. There is an instance in which a man ran 400 paces after penetration of the left ventricle, and lived for five hours. Morand gives an instance of survival for five days after wound of the right ventricle. Saucerotte speaks of survival for three days after injury to the heart.\\n\\nBabington speaks of a case of heart-injury, caused by transfixion by a bayonet, in which the patient survived nine hours. Other older cases are as follows: l'Ecluse, seven days; the Ephemerides, four and six days; Col de Vilars, twelve days; Marcucci, eighteen days; Bartholinus, five days; Durande, five days; Boyer, five days; Capelle, twenty six hours; Fahner, eleven days; Marigues, thirteen days; Morgagni, eight days; la Motte, twelve hours; Rhodius, Riedlin, two days; Saviard, eleven days; Sennert, three days; Triller, fourteen days; and Tulpius, two and fifteen days; and Zittman, eight days.\\n\\nThe Duc de Berri, heir to the French throne, who was assassinated in 1826, lived several hours with one of his ventricles opened. His surgeon, Dupuytren, was reprimanded for keeping the wound open with a probe introduced every two hours, but this procedure has its advocates at the present day. Randall mentions a gunshot wound of the right ventricle which did not cause death until the sixty-seventh day. Grant describes a wound in which a ball from a revolver entered a little to the right of the sternum, between the cartilages of the 5th and 6th ribs, and then entered the right ventricle about an inch from the apex. It emerged from the lower part, passed through the diaphragm, the cardiac end of the stomach, and lodged in the left kidney. The patient remained in a state of collapse fifteen hours after being shot, and with little or no nourishment lived twenty-six days. At the postmortem examination the wounds in the organs were found to be healed, but the cicatrices were quite evident. Bowling gives a case of gunshot wound of the shoulder in which death resulted eleven weeks after, the bullet being found in the left ventricle of the heart. Thompson has reported a bayonet wound of the heart, after the reception of which the patient lived four days. The bayonet entered the ventricle about 1 1/2 inches from the left apex, traversing the left wall obliquely, and making exit close to the septum ventriculorum. Roberts mentions a man who ran 60 yards and lived one hour after being shot through both lungs and the right auricle. Curran mentions the case of a soldier who, in 1809, was wounded by a bullet which entered his body to the left of the sternum, between the 2d and 3d ribs. He was insensible a half hour, and was carried aboard a fighting ship crowded with sailors. There was little hemorrhage from his wound, and he survived fourteen days. At the postmortem examination some interesting facts were revealed. It was found that the right ventricle was transversely opened for about an inch, the ball having penetrated its anterior surface, near the origin of the pulmonary artery. The ball was found loose in the pericardium, where it had fallen during the necropsy. There was a circular lacerated opening in the tricuspid valve, and the ball must have been in the right auricle during the fourteen days in which the man lived. Vite mentions an example of remarkable tenacity of life after reception of a cardiac wound, the subject living four days after a knife-wound penetrating the chest into the pericardial sac and passing through the left ventricle of the heart into the opposite wall. Boone speaks of a gunshot wound in which death was postponed until the thirteenth day. Bullock mentions a case of gunshot wound in which the ball was found lodged in the cavity of the ventricle four days and eighteen hours after infliction of the wound. Carnochan describes a penetrating wound of the heart in a subject in whom life had been protracted eleven days. After death the bullet was found buried and encysted in the heart. Holly reports a case of pistol-shot wound through the right ventricle, septum, and aorta, with the ball in the left ventricle. There was apparent recovery in fourteen days and sudden death on the fifty-fifth day.\\n\\nHamilton gives an instance of a shoemaker sixty-three years old who, while carrying a bundle, fell with rupture of the heart and lived several minutes. On postmortem examination an opening in the heart was found large enough to admit a blowpipe. Noble speaks of duration of life for five and a half days after rupture of the heart; and there are instances on record in which life has been prolonged for thirteen hours and for fifty-three hours after a similar injury. Glazebrook reports the case of a colored man of thirty, of powerful physique, who was admitted to the Freedmen's Hospital, Washington, D.C., at 12.30 A.M., on February 5, 1895. Upon examination by the surgeons, an incised wound was discovered one inch above the left nipple, 3 1/4 inches to the left of the median line, the incision being 2 1/4 inches in length and its direction parallel with the 3d rib. The man's general condition was fairly good, and the wound was examined. It was impossible to trace its depth further than the 3d rib, although probing was resorted to; it was therefore considered a simple wound, and dressed accordingly. Twelve hours later symptoms of internal hemorrhage were noticed, and at 8 A.M., February 6th, the man died after surviving his injury thirty-two hours. A necropsy was held three hours after death, and an oblique incision 3/4 inch in length was found through the cartilage-end of the 3d rib. A similar wound was next found in the pericardium, and upon examining the heart there was seen a clean, incised wound 1/2 inch in length, directly into the right ventricle, the endocardial wound being 3/8 inch long. Both the pericardium and left pleura were distended with fresh blood and large clots. Church reports a case of gunshot wound of the heart in a man of sixty-seven who survived three hours. The wound had been made by a pistol bullet (32 caliber), was situated 1 1/4 inches below the mammary line, and slightly to the left of the center of the sternum; through it considerable blood had escaped. The postmortem examination showed that the ball had pierced the sternum just above the xiphoid cartilage, and had entered the pericardium to the right and at the lower part. The sac was filled with blood, both fresh and clotted. There was a ragged wound in the anterior wall 1/2 inch in diameter. The wound of exit was 5/8 inch in diameter. After traversing the heart the ball had penetrated the diaphragm, wounded the omentum in several places, and become lodged under the skin posteriorly between the 9th and 10th ribs. Church adds that the \\\"Index Catalogue of the Surgeon-General's Library\\\" at Washington contains 22 cases of direct injury to the heart, all of which lived longer than his case: 17 lived over three days; eight lived over ten days; two lived over twenty-five days; one died on the fifty-fifth day, and there were three well-authenticated recoveries. Purple tabulates a list of 42 cases of heart-injury which survived from thirty minutes to seventy days.\\n\\nFourteen instances of gunshot wounds of the heart have been collected from U.S. Army reports, in all of which death followed very promptly, except in one instance in which the patient survived fifty hours. In another case the patient lived twenty-six hours after reception of the injury, the conical pistol-ball passing through the anterior margin of the right lobe of the lung into the pericardium, through the right auricle, and again entered the right pleural cavity, passing through the posterior margin of the lower lobe of the right lung; at the autopsy it was found in the right pleural cavity. The left lung and cavity were perfectly normal. The right lung was engorged and somewhat compressed by the blood in the pleural cavity. The pericardium was much distended and contained from six to eight ounces of partially coagulated blood. There was a fibrinous clot in the left ventricle.\\n\\nNonfatal Cardiac Injuries.--Wounds of the heart are not necessarily fatal. Of 401 cases of cardiac injury collected by Fischer there were as many as 50 recoveries, the diagnosis being confirmed in 33 instances by an autopsy in which there were found distinct signs of the cardiac injury. By a peculiar arrangement of the fibers of the heart, a wound transverse to one layer of fibers is in the direction of another layer, and to a certain extent, therefore, valvular in function; it is probably from this fact that punctured wounds of the heart are often attended with little or no bleeding.\\n\\nAmong the older writers, several instances of nonfatal injuries to the heart are recorded. Before the present century scientists had observed game-animals that had been wounded in the heart in the course of their lives, and after their ultimate death such direct evidence as the presence of a bullet or an arrow in their hearts was found. Rodericus a Veiga tells the story of a deer that was killed in hunting, and in whose heart was fixed a piece of arrow that appeared to have been there some time. Glandorp experimentally produced a nonfatal wound in the heart of a rabbit. Wounds of the heart, not lethal, have been reported by Benivenius, Marcellus Donatus, Schott, Stalpart van der Wiel, and Wolff. Ollenrot reports an additional instance of recovery from heart-injury, but in his case the wound was only superficial.\\n\\nThere is a recent case of a boy of fourteen, who was wounded in the heart by a pen-knife stab. The boy was discharged cured from the Middlesex Hospital, but three months after the reception of the injury he was taken ill and died. A postmortem examination showed that the right ventricle had been penetrated in a slanting direction; the cause of death was apoplexy, produced by the weakening and thinning of the heart's walls, the effect of the wound. Tillaux reports the case of a man of sixty-five, the victim of general paralysis, who passed into his chest a blade 16 cm. long and 2 mm. broad. The wound of puncture was 5 cm. below the nipple and 2 cm. to the outside. The left side of the chest was emphysematous and ecchymosed. The heart-sounds were regular, and the elevation of the skin by the blade coincided with the ventricular systole. The blade was removed on the following day, and the patient gradually improved. Some thirteen months after he had expectoration of blood and pus and soon died. At the necropsy it was seen that the wound had involved both lungs; the posterior wall of the ventricle and the inferior lobe of the right lung were traversed from before backward, and from left to right, but the ventricular cavity was not penetrated. Strange to say, the blade had passed between the vertebral column and the esophagus, and to the right of the aorta, but had wounded neither of these organs.\",\"timestamp\":1639718949,\"title\":\"\\nExtended tolerance of foreign bodies loose in the thoracic cavity has been noticed\"},\"digest\":\"7Dnw5-3J_x7pSrLpE-j0wHqLWgptUZprY4b2rvMpgfQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4FEa0511D28B2e43455B26d9Bb2E5c7B7044985a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"mKMnE8gC5sox13w-2tAauyJeB760n5sB3uWUTMGOYJw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"6Va056tlLxslTU7ru765TV43vT2eyebnWMd6IcgU2nw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"RPlGp0gUbodlav3Kw7rABIs2fXPwEvDCC3DcAa1Y_BeazyVCJxL5a5XG1YVoM9szwHjHfLHykuZ3g0aLemPxjA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x7140cd0abeb2ec37495c6befb72d415e817da15b69aebdbf2b0c4025f8d25d881e5021bb12219df98adbe25d73b60e8862a6a9dbcd1aabee8f31a25fec718cc41b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"mKMnE8gC5sox13w-2tAauyJeB760n5sB3uWUTMGOYJw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"6Va056tlLxslTU7ru765TV43vT2eyebnWMd6IcgU2nw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"7Dnw5-3J_x7pSrLpE-j0wHqLWgptUZprY4b2rvMpgfQ\"}"
