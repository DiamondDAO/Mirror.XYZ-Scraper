"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"One of the few transformative books in my life was *Discipline Equals Freedom* by Jocko Willink. Highly recommend reading it; in it he goes into depth on what it means to be disciplined, strategies for practicing discipline, and why you must be disciplined.\\n\\nToday I’ll be reflecting on how to *start* being disciplined, as it can be hard to jump straight into keeping a tight routine. For me there is a very difficult, but simple formula for starting discipline:\\n\\n1. When you go to bed, set goals for the next day\\n2. Go to bed early, so as to be awake and aware the next morning\\n3. Wake up early, and do nothing else until you have achieved your goals for the day\\n\\nGoals should be simple, with a defined start an end:\\n\\n* run a mile\\n* write the presentation for Monday, and pass it on for review\\n* fix issue #186 in the code\\n\\nOnce these goals have been achieved you are done for the day. You are satisfied. Everything else is bonus and you can get to bed early with a new set of goals for the next day. \\n\\nOften we are motivated towards the evening; many people will say “I code best at 2AM” or “I’m most productive after the sun sets”. It seems like this is the respectable thing, this is the hard thing; staying up all night to work is a sign of dedication.\\n\\nThis is, in fact, wrong. The hard thing is getting to bed on time, and the respectable thing is being productive during the day so you *can* get to bed on time. Setting goals in the evening when you’re motivated helps guide you in the morning, when you might not have it. \\n\\nAnd that’s the point. Anyone can achieve things when they are motivated. Only the disciplined can achieve things when they are not motivated. Getting in the habit of doing things solely because you set out to do them will enable you to achieve goals that are bigger than a day, bigger than a year even. \\n\\nBut start small and build. Showing up every day is key.\",\"timestamp\":1641795771,\"title\":\"Starting Discipline\"},\"digest\":\"HBIms5PdasEI5deTtq3I0wv3vSY_XnCMylK1PrfG8po\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xfB4A20f9c6D8562D1165e5f26F19a8E662046e4c\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"i5ouSQF9YR4EZro8e0b6VOScperAwuqPo9cWl1m_Xu8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"tzJCuPls9nVASZxzYXZSgSxvVSqHlIYneROzQMUn3Ig\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"J3IIL5y88Ie9tAkKURhR1LJXjAZ7_ZDBifoBkyVzgFOF0UfWuHaAAfXRYN7RvjBx1978VOgdzn7oBrsyKnWL_g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xac5a15088968f3f4b1a7c5046f87b517bfcf62f745293d2f6d34398b6d089b8952797522f11ab3916bcfcd6647c410fa6261b56ddf0aa059c7c816c99bdceceb1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"i5ouSQF9YR4EZro8e0b6VOScperAwuqPo9cWl1m_Xu8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"tzJCuPls9nVASZxzYXZSgSxvVSqHlIYneROzQMUn3Ig\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"HBIms5PdasEI5deTtq3I0wv3vSY_XnCMylK1PrfG8po\"}"
