Aspire to Inspire\\n 3. Don’t worry, just be.\\n 4. Compare yourself not to your end goal, but to who you were yesterday. Step by step, day by day (Key to sustainable growth: compare yourself not to your end dream, but to who you were yesterday. Deciding the small parts of today compared to yesterday will compound into the future.)\\n 5. The day you lose control over your morals, is the day when they will plunge you to death. Grasp your morals, and your life will remain intact.\\n 6. Excellence is not a destination, but a direction.\\n 7. The real secret to excellence is accepting someone may be more better, smarter, stronger - more excellent - than you in your craft. Focus on enjoying what you do, by understanding why you do it - the rest will follow.\\n 8. A man who thinks but does not try, or apply, is nothing. A man who succeeds, who enjoys fame, is something. But a man who fails and is ridiculed, yet marches on, opens up the chance to build the new standard\\n 9. A wise man is not wise for having a lot of knowledge (or being smart), but he is wise for knowing how to use that knowledge.\\n10. For the creator: imagine the possibilities.
