It seems the Supreme God has not blessed you.\\\"\\n\\nHymns in the temple roared, and the light from around the angel rained down on Rodriguez.The necromancer slapped his wand, and a pale flame burst from around him, forming a protective wall.Thousands of shrapids slammed against the walls of the flame, shaking it a little dimmer with each explosion.Within moments, the necromancer had taken the brunt of hundreds of light pellets, and the walls were crumbling.In that brief respite, Rodriguez's spell was done.As his fingers finished the last complex symbol, there was a bang, and his left hand turned to bone powder.\\n\\nA huge phalanc of magic emerged from the ground behind Weena, black flames shooting up into the sky.Out of the void above the phalanx, a huge bony dragon head protruded.Bone dragon dead stare at the light angel, the huge body slowly out of the void.Two thirds of the hall of the temple is occupied by the largest bony dinosaur ever seen.\\n\\nFully restored to her battle form as an angel of Light, Weena is not afraid of osteosaurs, the most powerful undead.But there was something indescribable about the osteosaurs.The average osteosaur was never this big, only about two thirds the size of this one at most. The skeleton was pale or dark gray, often covered with dust and cobwebs from years of sleep.At the moment this whole body is the skeleton of deep black, above emerge from time to time a few incantations.The uneasiness in wei na heart is more intense, as light angel, oneself should be able to deal with two skull dragon just to, why can be afraid of.\",\"timestamp\":1634808551,\"title\":\"n dead \"},\"digest\":\"nd0Z9sPtMSusaSnMi0DMBHggd5BKyojPOz0uqo1YdVI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x48a9D0791753D3d02F8c85D79f19203FaFB57d97\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"6XKUd6gGbnO0Boer0X53uYcsIfstAWFIQf0hIGJhJbA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"6XAW0EE9BIbFMY8YaSaqIQv87cYnughNOvQ8m4iLES0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"PUM4-uICiOMfcC2KOnPZwbIdAM-tI4_SuqLk9ktkuyCdqr1vOQrGHGnhkQwpJk_8B1sb-fJmMGGLrVwngA9_4g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x29e32f917304574ecfcaa471df7a6e0377d27bd074b5d9e8b1f1a75c988f07d3206d7ee3dab98e02731677cb4d1604924f447f037cd43bf1a011f4a757e27d561b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"6XKUd6gGbnO0Boer0X53uYcsIfstAWFIQf0hIGJhJbA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"6XAW0EE9BIbFMY8YaSaqIQv87cYnughNOvQ8m4iLES0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"nd0Z9sPtMSusaSnMi0DMBHggd5BKyojPOz0uqo1YdVI\"}"
