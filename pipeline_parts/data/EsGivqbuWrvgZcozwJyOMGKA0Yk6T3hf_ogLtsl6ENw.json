"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Purpose** \\n\\n vDAI (the virtual DAI) is a kind of synthetic asset that can only be generated by Premine or Wrapping. The purpose of vDAI is to provide sufficient liquidity for fair launch tokens by the Liquidity Injection process.\\n\\n**Premine** \\n\\n The premined vDAI is the initial supply of vDAI when its token contract is created. Once premined it transferred and locked into the Treasury.\\n\\n**Wrap/Unwrap** \\n\\n The real DAI can be wrapped into vDAI by anyone and vice versa. It works simple, just like WXDAI and WETH. Wrapped DAI is locked in the wrapper smart contract.\\n\\n**Treasury** \\n\\n The treasury is a smart contract controlling premined vDAI. The premined vDAIs will never be sold into the market or transferred to someone. The only purpose of the treasury is to grant vDAI for injecting liquidity.\\n\\n**Liquidity Injection** \\n\\n The liquidity injection is requesting vDAI from the treasury and pairing it with the other fair launch token to provide liquidity.\\n\\n**Pegged** \\n\\n All circulating vDAI are pegged into DAI and can exchange at a 1:1 rate through the wrapper.\\n\\n**Fair Launch Only** \\n\\n Because that vDAI are designed to pegged with DAI. The circulating amount of vDAI must be the same as the amount of wrapped DAI. It requires nobody is owning the pairing token, in case they can sell into vDAI once liquidity is added to create inconsistent balances. In other words, vDAI liquidity injection only can be applied to tokens that are Fair Launching.\\n\\n**Additional Security Attentions**\\n\\n It's vital to make sure no vDAI from LPs or Treasury can be taken. Thus the exchange for the protocol to inject liquidity must be permissionless and noncustodial. Uniswap and its forks are one of the ideals.\\n\\n**The Value** \\n\\n The value of vDAI is the same as DAI. Because although a massive amount of vDAI are premined or providing liquidity, they will never be moved or sold. The fair launch requirement is also the key to approaching this.\",\"timestamp\":1635698449,\"title\":\"vDAI - An approach to initial liquidity for Fair Launch tokens\"},\"digest\":\"eJsA_23D8X5siFc7C56hQVrW-x_ploV7WbovjYyCdA8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6544df975cF58A0b2C9a361a8db2e00D338e10c1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cVAKz1oZMGSg-cd2hD3smsf9NkRTBx5Y7HruAEbnF3Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JqMdFM5tzB9jgqAARMnOEgfqZjSWmMBgtumPNIP2q1U\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"UNT319AKESRMMykcpfdf3yR_aHdy1oJgKPfDUlweInWS2QMJ9LMkjh_RAYqqmVDmHdgShTsipAVINI2jIahVBA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc77bd34a607073f05a834c48fc62bfab2f55b523eb9fd4f66e83bbf9a2cca8625d6b344ef9af3406eac1691db0a3f9b3e3b28491c64b3bd65753d3e5a7ca2a381b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cVAKz1oZMGSg-cd2hD3smsf9NkRTBx5Y7HruAEbnF3Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JqMdFM5tzB9jgqAARMnOEgfqZjSWmMBgtumPNIP2q1U\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"eJsA_23D8X5siFc7C56hQVrW-x_ploV7WbovjYyCdA8\"}"
