Collaborators are a broad spectrum of the community that wish to participate in Mundo Lingo‚Äôs success, from regular attendees to Managers, Devs and even Venue Managers.\\n\\n## Who can be a Collaborator?\\n\\n**Anybody** - even if you don‚Äôt have a specific skill set to offer.Sometimes all a project needs is moral support from interested members. While some tasks require specific skills such as design, management or programming, others are very open such as voting, assistance answering questions in our groups, helping out at events, or small tasks like giving your feedback on a document.\\n\\n## How to become a Collaborator?\\n\\n**Join** - [Mundo Lingo Collaborators](https://t.me/+eKPDf_8pUUAzNWQ0) and follow the steps below.\\n\\n## üëã Introduce yourself\\n\\nThis is a **must**. Be noticed - Light up the sky üåü, don‚Äôt let anyone not-notice you arrived ‚ú®\\n\\n* Hash tag your skills (if any)- EG.\\\\* `#bizdev, #CSS, #illustration, #callhosting`\\n* Who are you?\\n* What are your passions, hobbies, interests?\\n* How did you get here?\\n* Why are you here?\\n* What are you interested in?\\n* Who are you interested in connecting with?\\n* What skills -if any- can you offer to other members?\\n\\n### Pro-Tips\\n\\n* It‚Äôs okay to observe the group, but try to make an intro within 5 days.\\n* Use a nice photo and a real name to get a warmer reception.\\n\\n## Types of Collaborators\\n\\n### Freshers and Lurkers\\n\\nFreshers are new kids on the block. Lurkers hang out not saying much and generally observing the group. Both are fine, try to participate however you can, vote and offer useful perspective occasionally when you can.\\n\\n### Residents\\n\\nResidents volunteer from time to time to help with crowd-tasking. For example, group admins, Ambassadors, or to help verify some venues. When you volunteer you‚Äôll be given a task that may take anything from 10 minutes to a couple of hours depending on various factors. These tasks may be random, or they can involve your special skill set.\\n\\n### High-Level Collabs AKA ‚ÄúLeads‚Äù\\n\\nFor Crowd-Tasking projects we have small specialised working groups. Each is headed by a **Lead** with a strong grasp of the tasks at hand.\\n\\n## Working Groups\\n\\nTo gain residency, members complete an online interview (links below). If you don‚Äôt see your skill set here, you can create a new group for it.\\n\\n* Web Development\\n* Design and Illustration\\n* Social Media Management\\n* [Online Assembly](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/YHiCb5_XaYGdpbRypQWQkl09ptcQ-gQ4z3xVB_ChbDc) - (Community Moderators)\\n* The Dark Room **\\\\[Link needed\\\\]**- (Photographers)\\n* The Venue Investigation Bureau - (Finding and/or verifying venues)\\n* [The Incubator](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/u9k391Q69s4h51bqyDa5GDeG7HurDVXaOuhFcHcb-Jc) (Where Event Managers are made)\\n\\n## More on IRL Collaborators\\n\\n### Managers\\n\\nThis is a high level of commitment role. More on that [here‚Ä¶](https://mirror.xyz/0x9aDe01ED938E536CfBD5eA5cC21b62Ba65Ce2da2/2BqZzS5xZgDQ-PX7vg7moqJUe1zJPvZHbq8SmFIAhIA)\\n\\n### Ambassadors\\n\\nThis requires physical presence in the events. Ambassadors arrive early to ensure the well-being of the public during the event\\n\\n### Photographers\\n\\nPhotographers are huge for us. We like to find photographers who are naturally talented and yet lacking experience especially indoor settings. We provide resources, guidance and a strong community to help photographer progress quickly.
