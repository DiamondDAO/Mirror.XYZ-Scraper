"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Think about the rise of Switzerland and Singapore, both of which provide rich people in other countries with services that their home country does not provide, such as reasonable tax avoidance and anonymity of assets. And now there are still a large number of governments with financial difficulties who want to go this way or save themselves or make a fortune. What a huge market for OTC and currency transactions in China, the annual income generated can be comparable to the GDP of many small countries. Once this market becomes vacant and it is not the turn of a small country, the asset oligarchs will pounce on like hungry wolves.\\n\\nWhy are you willing to let out such a big cake? On September 26, Huobi announced the gradual removal of mainland users. A similar article was posted 4 years ago. But the difference this time is that on October 2nd, Huobi again issued a document announcing the specific time for the closure of currency trading and OTC. Pictures of Huobi CEO's recognition in the WeChat group were also reported on the Internet.\\n\\nThis time the rapid retreat was brought up by Huobi.\\n\\nHuobi is China's largest encrypted deposit and withdrawal platform, and it has also played a role as a vane of domestic exchanges. His every move has more influence than the notices issued by various ministries and commissions. Today, when the crypto world is far more mature than before, why would Huobi retreat bravely because of the same pressure?\\n\\nThere are two main reasons: one is that there is enough money to make, and the risk-return is not proportional; the other is that the business is tired, tired, and want to retire.\\n\\nThis joint action only gave Huobi an opportunity to withdraw. In fact, Huobi executives have long wanted to break up. But there are so many supporters, large and retail investors, who used to want to do a big deal, but now it is too big to stop and it is even more difficult.\\n\\nWhen you don’t have a net worth, you need to take risks and take some risks. It’s acceptable to make a marginal shot in the gray area. But when the wealth gradually accumulates to the point where it can last for a few lifetimes, the aversion to risk will increase exponentially.\\n\\nTherefore, for the high-level members of Huobi, the policy risk a few years ago and the current policy risk are not a concept at all. When you have 100W, you want 100 million. When you have 1 billion, you just want stability and peace.\\n\\nCTO Zhu Jiawei withdrew a few months before posting, and has nothing to do with this wave of postings. Why didn't it be announced long ago? I'm afraid of the violent reaction and the trouble, so I have to stabilize the situation, it is easy to get off the ship. Li Lin also wanted to retire but did not dare to retire. After all, for a person with wealth and freedom, the most important thing is freedom and his family. Maybe he can go abroad to continue his business, but after all, he is of Chinese nationality and his family is not willing to leave China. It is not as comfortable to live in China as to go wherever he goes. Without the protection of Chinese policies, he will almost lose everything. This time the announcement of the ministries and commissions gave Huobi a perfect step, and no longer has to worry about it, and enjoy life freely.\\n\\nWithout these channels, where do users go? Huobi can't count on it anymore. After all, his life is pinched by China, and he doesn't want to move abroad on a large scale. Changpeng Zhao of Binance is of Canadian nationality. Most of his users are foreigners. He can accept it without China. There is no need to hit the gun now. It is estimated that it is because of this mentality that he will temporarily attack Chinese users. With the restriction, the RMB OTC will also be suspended.\\n\\nThe most fearless thing is OK, and OK’s announcement is the most vague: we ostensibly cut off from mainland China 4 years ago, and now everything remains the same. In fact, mainland users can still use it, but many people don't know if they are used to Huobi. OK, why are you so dare? The founder Xu Mingxing resigned in 2018, and the current CEO is JAY HAO, a Chinese American. The Americans operate a company registered in Central America in the United States. China is really out of reach. Their servers and offices are all abroad. China has always pursued a strategic policy of absolute respect for the territorial sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries.\",\"timestamp\":1634581371,\"title\":\"Where is the underlying logic of this round of user clearance?\"},\"digest\":\"zHmvpet6qBDHhMntXUPCDaQFfFskVp0xlngFmoZAb8Y\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x44b9f858175064a1e7202e209f5b67393c6bd552\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"yyXcGHA3jiNOcOPShHMCwuoPrPvLSf1UirzB_LsKNf4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qyK3ZCKWAMi33rVMroYdyfsYBL_swmIWo0Cs4tfvU70\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"624NM1HQBLn43Eac62FzuoaBPz3Ryci0kuJQayZjKiNDYgFJMnV_ry3uFuBRmIhpIqA1MMzxBo5F2Y_Y3bRgqw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x064ca92f78f0a34a04445aaf04780ce6258afaafa61b5a7c1141d7e092dd05c602f08f8d712eab1c053e12ff17e129133bc2bb52935436f0033ebbdb64a3b8571c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"yyXcGHA3jiNOcOPShHMCwuoPrPvLSf1UirzB_LsKNf4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qyK3ZCKWAMi33rVMroYdyfsYBL_swmIWo0Cs4tfvU70\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"zHmvpet6qBDHhMntXUPCDaQFfFskVp0xlngFmoZAb8Y\"}"
