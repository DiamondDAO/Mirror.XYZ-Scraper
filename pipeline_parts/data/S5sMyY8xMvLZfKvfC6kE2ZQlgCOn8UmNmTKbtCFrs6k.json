This is to ensure that you are verified as an active user while further preventing bots and fake users from draining the tokens from the Swash ecosystem, meaning those tokens are distributed fairly between real Swash members.\\n\\n‚ùó To withdraw your $SWASH earnings from the [app](https://swashapp.io/apps/extension), you need to meet the following two conditions:\\n\\n1.  You should have more than **10 SWASH** in your wallet\\n2.  You should have been using the new version of Swash for at least **one month**\\n\\nIf you try to withdraw before you meet these conditions, you will see an error message specifying the reason why you are unable to withdraw.\\n\\n## üí∞Balance\\n\\nYour earnings are divided into two:\\n\\n*SWASH Earnings* ‚Äî This is the total amount you‚Äôve earned for the value of your data by surfing the web.\\n\\n*SWASH Rewards* ‚Äî This is the total amount you have received in rewards from referrals, airdrops, and everything except earnings from your data.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1354/1\\\\*bkT0RkM1vu7wK-vLyLYmsw.png)\\n\\nPress ‚ÄòClaim‚Äô to add your referral bonus to your $SWASH earnings balance.\\n\\nBelow your balances, you can find your public wallet address. You can share this wallet address with others.\\n\\n## üí∏ How to withdraw\\n\\nWhen you withdraw your $SWASH, you can then stake it to earn more, or exchange it for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies through various exchanges.\\n\\nYou can withdraw your earnings using the **xDai** chain (recommended) or **Ethereum** mainnet.\\n\\n## xDai (recommended):\\n\\nUsing xDai is faster and Swash will cover the cost for you! üéâ\\n\\nSet up your wallet according to the following instructions to receive your earnings (it only takes a few minutes!):\\n\\n1.  [Connect your MetaMask to xDai](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/wallets/metamask/metamask-setup)\\n\\n2\\\\. Add $SWASH as a token in your MetaMask xDai wallet using the ‚ÄòImport Token‚Äô button. You can find the $SWASH Token Contract Address [here](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/tokens/0x84e2c67cbefae6b5148fca7d02b341b12ff4b5bb).\\n\\n3\\\\. Copy the Metamask xDai wallet address you just created and paste it in the ‚ÄòRecipient wallet address‚Äô box below and click ‚ÄòWithdraw‚Äô\\n\\n4\\\\. Withdrawal successful!\\n\\nüéâ Bonus: Once received, you can also put your $SWASH to work by trading or staking liquidity on the [SWASH/xDAI pool](https://info.honeyswap.org/pair/0x0110f008b8815cf00514d54ea11bfa8bb555c69b#/pair/0xfd8fe4c85e5c2e56207ffb50b0e9eb43116f282f) on [Honeyswap](https://app.honeyswap.org/#/swap) üêù\\n\\n**Understanding error messages**\\n\\nBlacklisting happens when people try to cheat referral programs or somehow generate fake data. If your behaviour is flagged, you will receive this error message when you try to withdraw.\\n\\nIf you are new to Swash and have been using it for less than one month, then you will receive an error message telling you the date from when you are able to withdraw.\\n\\nYou need at least 10 $SWASH to be able to withdraw. If your balance is too low, you will receive an error message.\\n\\n## Ethereum:\\n\\nIf you choose to withdraw using Ethereum:\\n\\n1.  Choose ‚ÄòMainnet‚Äô from the ‚ÄòWithdraw to‚Äô dropdown menu below\\n2.  Enter your Ethereum wallet address in the ‚ÄòRecipient wallet address‚Äô box below and click ‚ÄòWithdraw‚Äô. Exchange wallets are not currently supported\\n3.  A small box will appear telling you the amount needed in your wallet (in ETH) to cover the transaction fees or if your balance is enough for Swash to cover the transaction fee for you\\n4.  You will then be asked to confirm the transaction you want to make. When you click ‚ÄòConfirm‚Äô, the transaction will happen\\n\\nTransaction fees (or ‚Äò[gas fees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/)‚Äô) are the cost of energy needed to run a transaction on Ethereum. The cost will vary depending on the Ethereum network and the cost of the particular transaction in question.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637195625,\"title\":\"Everything you need to know about withdrawing your $SWASH\"},\"digest\":\"l9NQmx3AHrK02Kw6KzQaO26zUCHks0IJ6I5AvRfon48\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xA4Cc3fB0c8F0E1dbDFfFEcdf61103777bd219089\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RZgQ0XJZWOgcV06i77gk2LBW6M-ulKIHjFHwlz5Pwxs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ob1KqkZU4nnpxOYKNNEpoeFCiFVm96-FHSeIiVnpeGY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"z78YM0huLE8fbuk-Y_LbGjFr9HvD22nUh-FPN488V1p9ybvMoRPy5PJPmoChPZ2Iu4Py--jwDsDXQLhL2BOK1w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2bb40579ba9611a583808397a89c2dc96530512c2c2591625c877f78e686695f708551d995a14b8a224ddc8ab49447e824b88efe0b9b7fa98a4bc6f5f46e9f131c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RZgQ0XJZWOgcV06i77gk2LBW6M-ulKIHjFHwlz5Pwxs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ob1KqkZU4nnpxOYKNNEpoeFCiFVm96-FHSeIiVnpeGY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"l9NQmx3AHrK02Kw6KzQaO26zUCHks0IJ6I5AvRfon48\"}"
