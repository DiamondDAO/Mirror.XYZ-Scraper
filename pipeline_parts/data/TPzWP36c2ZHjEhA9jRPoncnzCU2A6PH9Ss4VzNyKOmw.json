"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"> **WIP Last Updated:** Nov 1, 2021.\\n>\\n> *Shout-out to [Art Coal](https://mirror.xyz/0x253B77d9100E39601Ee01b4e5567a5fc8E878A81/yvBxK-RqZu-Kc5nbkgXyDRQmajg71uXj0MEYAaRSnxc) for the idea to write this!!!*\\n\\nSoon I’ll be launching a crowdfunding campaign to create a DAO; though I need to make sure I have enough ETH for gas-fees before I do; and I would like to gauge and grow the interest in this project, before I launch it :)\\n\\nPlease share this page and give me your feedback via twitter **[@CultureClap](https://twitter.com/ArtCoal2) / [@DFLDAO](https://twitter.com/DFLDAO) or** join the Discord Server to further discuss: **[https://](https://discord.gg/bwMRRbs)[discord.gg/bwMRRbs](http://discord.gg/bwMRRbs)**\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lNZQXIPJ9hvQ1JaA0OFSB.jpg?height=1024&width=1536&&&&size=large)\\n\\nI’ve been searching for the (open-source) tools to build the community I knew was possible, and web3 is bringing these tools to life.\\n\\nNow, I’m seeking investment in my *laboratory*… presenting the ***DFLDAO:*** *DreamFreely Laboratory DAO*.\\n\\n## Basics\\n\\nProject Title: **DFLDAO**\\nToken: $ DFLD\\nMy Share: 90%\\nFunding Goals: 10 ETH\\nContribution Limit: 20 ETH\\n\\n## NFT Tiers\\n\\n1 ETH, Supply: 6, NFT:  $ Pass (image)\\n0\\\\.5 ETH, Supply: 8, NFT: x0 Pass (image)\\n0\\\\.25 ETH, Supply: 16, NFT: @ Pass (image)\\n\\nAll Mirror contributors will receive an exclusive audio NFT as well.\\n\\n## The Build\\n\\nWhile a few products already exist, and are in various phases of deployments, all aspects of DFLDAO are meant to be educational; to boot, the entire operation maintains transparent financials (using GNUCash.)\\n\\nThis being made more fantastic by zeroing-out the initial burn rate of the laboratory’s primary creator, me, Culture Clap; by purchasing a plot of land in Colombia upon which I can gather my own water, and grow my own food, while using renewable energy sources to power the laboratory.\\n\\nThis land itself will be *worked* *with* into a space for education, as a rural language academy in Latin America, and food forest.\\n\\n## Help is Needed\\n\\nI do have a small team around me, but our expertise is in the operation of our work; not in technology-at-large, business, finances or ***the legal and tax ramifications of operating an international company***.\\n\\nRaising through a Mirror crowdfund is the perfect way strengthen these weaknesses while providing recompense for the effort, access and insight. Tokens providing a mechanism for access, ownership and decision-making.\\n\\n## The Projects\\n\\nEverything is centered around an essence of learning. Our primary product is [idioke, a tool for improving pronunciation](https://www.idioke.com) in a target language. The hook being that users receive ***personalized daily feedback*** … all for $10 USD per month.\\n\\nThe next project is [Rebel Coding, a series of programs and tools](https://www.rebelcoding.com) designed to on-board those interested in computer programming through web development. Both of which feed into a third project located at [screamfreely.org](https://www.screamfreely.org).\\n\\nThis being an incredibly brief overview of the initial DFL ecosystem.\\n\\n## The Kicker\\n\\n***[idioke is the primary candidate for immediate web3 integration.](https://www.idioke.com)***\\n\\nidioke seeks submissions from users, and pays in a token that can be exchanged for fiat, but how, is the only question. Though here is where our work begins to truly bridge web3 technologies and their service to those in developing countries.\\n\\nFunctional, proof of concept, applications have been built, and are on the cusp of limited deployment to alpha-testers.\\n\\n## 90% Retained Ownership\\n\\nThis crowdfund is being conduct as part of a Friends & Family Pre-Seed round.\\n\\nOur primary product, idioke, is nearing product-market-fit. While the others follow-suit, and have existing minimum-testable-products ready for deployment. My current need is for advisors; relationships, I think, that are best incubated over asynchronous conversation.\\n\\nAnd that is **the primary aim of this crowdfund, to gain the oversight of those more informed on the business, technology, legal and financial ramifications of web3,** than I.\\n\\nMirror contributors therefore receive the largest percentage, and the first access to voting, vetting and verifying DFLDAO’s external behavior.\\n\\nOwnership, as a whole, will consist of four primary groups, myself, monthly supporters (Patreon & Ghost), GoFundMe contributors, and Mirror crowdfund contributors.\\n\\n* 90% Culture Clap / DreamFreely LLC\\n* 3% Monthly Contributors\\n* 7% Mirror Contributors\\n\\nTo the world, DreamFreely LLC will own the entirety of the operation for legal and tax purposes; digitally seven-percent of the governance tokens will be distributed to Mirror contributors. Another three-percent, will be held in waiting for monthly supporters to claim.\\n\\nGovernance token distribution will also correlate to dividend distribution as well. Monthly contributors are capped at 500. DreamFreely LLC will receive  the bulk of the initial revenues as we measure and improve operating costs.\\n\\nThankfully we are starting with products that are generating revenue from day 1; and so will never put ourselves in the position to be operating at a loss.\\n\\nNor is our objective to hoard revenues, but rather to play with revenues by reinvesting them to create as much positive opportunity for others as possible. While creating educational material others can use to do the same.\\n\\nNow the goal is to grow our intimate and engaged personal community, to focus on a few initial moving parts.\\n\\n1. Organizing Community Dialogue and Voting\\n2. Formalizing Benefit Tiers & Tokenomics\\n3. Verifying Primary Products & Payment Portals\\n\\n## About the NFT Passes\\n\\nThree tiers exist, the $ Pass, the x0 Pass and the @ Pass; each enables different levels of digital access, while forming the Council of Thirty. Each level being the next in the line of vetting ideas, efforts and positions.\\n\\n* Private Discord\\n* Exclusive Airdrops\\n* Community Cosmonauts\\n\\n**If all of the passes are purchased,** our Council of Thirty will be complete. This council joins the Council of Twenty, creating the Council of Fifty, who are responsible for testing all current and forthcoming products.\\n\\n### Council of Thirty (Co3)\\n\\nThe Co3 provides primarily Crypto, Business, Legal and Tax Council. We are navigating new terrain, and we want to explore, while fortifying our position as efficiently as possible along the way. Those of us nearer to web3 technologies are more informed on the possibilities; though I look to you all to help strengthen these weaknesses of mine.\\n\\n### Council of Twenty (Co2)\\n\\nThe Co2 represents monthly fiat supporters, and primarily provide interpersonal, Branding, Marketing, Outreach & Community Council.\\n\\n### Council of Fifty (Co5) & One-Hundred (Co1)\\n\\nThe Co5’s sole duty is to gather the Council of 100 (Co1), who are our initial beta-testers for new products and features. Co1 are initially pulled from the monthly supporting community, and others connected via mailing list and social media.\\n\\nThe council of 50 establishes benchmarks and milestones, which is the executive leaders’ responsibility to achieve, in collaboration with the Co5.\",\"timestamp\":1635794914,\"title\":\"Introducing DFLDAO\"},\"digest\":\"P-fade04YgWj3xtqlMbJwFLScO8IlMB-wbT5QO58scg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x37EDCc3A545F148706086d61507fC27e98990E3e\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"9-p-1DFDtJoPxSFITq3zO3uHs2p897-eVvkzfGvRtrk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2XL2ZkU6YRqfd4RZ4CAh9BF468lP2OopmUKuz7ZsWf4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"NNC3UIKUANO_NblKATn7L45Q3ZLvinqRDeY65Dw5DsWZIY0n4LcVGr229z3zQZDJ4Ugg5-e7LtbLBCnZbKoVkw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xbea48e6f967aa7f6e31ef6b42dea2a078c9b9488d727e90b91343c4c0f398c9b0eb2c1acaffda08430e430e2673504d1b78142727b922c205b0e380e83642e1d1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"9-p-1DFDtJoPxSFITq3zO3uHs2p897-eVvkzfGvRtrk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2XL2ZkU6YRqfd4RZ4CAh9BF468lP2OopmUKuz7ZsWf4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"CMabCrgBd76SHBbdPbai_wl7F7JTQXMNuJEI5hFrIYk\"}"
