"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"![A 17th century CE painting of¬†Daedalus¬†and Icarus by Jacob Peter Gowy](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lneRlRQyb_QzcjtS0wbF3.jpg?height=804&width=1920)\\n\\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen, take a seat and let me tell you the story of ***\\\"Fall in love\\\"*** inspired by a recent and important chapter of my life.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/imperfect_jpeg/status/1468872564000931840?s=20](https://twitter.com/imperfect_jpeg/status/1468872564000931840?s=20)\\n\\nOn December 9, 2021 I woke up and I asked myself, if I was lucky to still dream about her or not ? Because I think the hardest part is realizing once my eyes are open that she‚Äôs not really here.. Just like Icarus, in my life, I was lucky to have wax wings fed by love and the desire to reach the dream of freedom, but I failed and in my fall I lost much more than my wings and my dreams.\\n\\n## I - Introduction to my fourth painting, ‚ÄúFall in love‚Äù\\n\\nLet me introduce you ***Fall in love***, a painting inspired by Greek mythology with a touch of true history and poetry, realized by myself on December 17, 2021.\\n\\n![Fall in love, made by imperfect.jpeg](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5XmxBJ29PXu3PXMpQDKhK.jpg?height=5000&width=4000)\\n\\nThrough this painting, I try to immerse you into an illuminated scene with an angelic and heavenly atmosphere. Contrasted by an impression of danger, where we can easily distinguish two characters in bad posture,\\n\\n* An angel who seems to be falling\\n* And a woman who seems to be a prisoner\\n\\n## II - The story of piece\\n\\nThe myth of Icarus, is surely the story that best illustrates my worst flaw. Just like Icarus and his father who tried to escape from Crete with wings built from feathers and wax, I wanted to fly too high, dazzled by the vision of a better life by forgetting that I already had everything and that too was useless, I ignored the instructions and too close to the sun I fell from the sky straight into the ocean to reach Icarus at the bottom of the abyss.\\n\\nToday, perhaps, if instead of being blinded by the impossible, I would have focused on the possible, I might still have the woman of my life my side as I write these words.\\n\\nFrom these tragic stories was born the poem accompanying the work that we will see immediately.\\n\\n### Fall in love,\\n\\nI feel so much passion,\\nIt is stirring inside,\\nI opened my heart,\\nAnd closed off my mind,\\n\\nI followed the feeling,\\nThat showed me the way,\\nThrough the dark nights,\\nTo see the new days,\\n\\nI needed to find You,\\nI searched far and wide,\\nI'm grateful to have You,\\nAs a part of my life,\\n\\nYou make me so happy,\\nYou make me so sad,\\nYou make me so angry,\\nYou make me so mad,\\n\\nI wish I never found you,\\nI wish I never had,\\nI have fallen in love,\\nI have fallen so bad.\\n\\nWritten and painted by @imperfect.jpeg\\n\\n## III - The scene in 3 details\\n\\n### #1 - The fallen angel\\n\\n![The Fallen Angel](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vd21RY-G13jN3AM4y4Ul1.png?height=3000&width=3000)\\n\\nAmong all the characters of the painting, the one that we notice directly with its sharp wings, is the representation of Icarus, which illustrates the failure of a human short of his goal, without being able to touch his dream with these fingers. \\n\\nSurely cursed by the Divine, he is destined to return to Earth without his beloved.\\n\\n### #2 - The beloved prisoner\\n\\n![The beloved](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Jzy0yhueuU-j_KRoBrsFM.png?height=3000&width=3000)\\n\\nShowing an expression of panic in the face, we quickly understand the fear of the trapped character. Destined to be separated from Icarus, she has around her hands what appears to be cursed chains.\\n\\nWhat‚Äôs really happening to her ? How did she get here ? Who‚Äôs holding her back ? We hope she succeeds in freeing herself from her misfortune.\\n\\n### #3 - The guards of the gates\\n\\n![The Angel of Death](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Uus3-E5oKs_6BmjNPi61_.png?height=3000&width=3000)\\n\\nIf the atmosphere seems heavenly, the left side of the piece reveals a darker side. We see two angels in front of the right and left shoulder of a giant status that seems to hold a sword in these hands.\\n\\nIs it the sword that cut the wings of Icarus ? We will never know.\\n\\n## IV - The stages of creation\\n\\nBefore creating this piece I had the idea to make a painting in the style of Disney, but my love my for realism catch me. So I sliced the pear in half using a palette composed of pink, to stay in the romantic/fairy tale theme, and I created a realistic character (Icarus) and a character in the face of a Disney princess (The beloved) in the style of Imperfect üòâ.\\n\\n![#1 - Sketching](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xP3UUodERaX3PwTY7lMui.jpg?height=4000&width=4000)\\n\\n![#2 - Choice of Colour Palette](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zY7HnZeaRK9NuP3T_xdI6.jpg?height=4000&width=4000)\\n\\n![#3 - Foreground](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zvmv8IgLEB1h9e6iWRG6G.jpg?height=4000&width=4000)\\n\\n![#4 - Background](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CVLuKl2f70he0JoLqJh2i.jpg?height=4000&width=4000)\\n\\n![#5 - Details and Correction](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LBgECSiYGveg0DDS5iBYn.jpg?height=4000&width=4000)\\n\\n## V - A first auction for a last publication\\n\\n***Fall in love***, is now available on Foundation waiting for a first auction and a gallery where Icarus can rebuild these wings quietly.\\n\\nHoping you enjoyed my second Mirror and my last painting of the year, I thank in advance whoever will help me close this year in the best way. <3\\n\\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/119807](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/119807)\\n\\nI realize that my life is changing, in 1 month on Foundation, I managed to solve several financial problems. I rediscover myself as an artist and I see myself doing things that I would never have dared to do separately before, and it‚Äôs just an incredible feeling. A big thank you for reading so far, it is thanks to you that I am trying to build a different future for myself.
