"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia) is an [online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) [free content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content) [encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia) project helping create a world in which everyone can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. It is supported by the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikimedia_Foundation) and based on a model of [freely editable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Editing) content. The name \\\"Wikipedia\\\" is a [blending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) of the words *[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki)* (a technology for creating collaborative [websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website), from the [Hawaiian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_language) word *[wiki](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wiki#Hawaiian)*, meaning \\\"quick\\\") and *encyclopedia*. Wikipedia's articles provide links designed to guide the user to related pages with additional information.\\n\\nWikipedia is [written collaboratively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_writing) by largely anonymous [volunteers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_community). Anyone with [Internet access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access) can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles, except in [limited cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Protection_policy) where [editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editing) is restricted to prevent further disruption or vandalism.\\n\\nSince its creation on January 15, 2001, Wikipedia has grown into the world's [largest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Size_of_Wikipedia) reference [website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website), attracting [1.8 billion unique-device visitors monthly](https://stats.wikimedia.org/#/all-wikipedia-projects/reading/unique-devices) as of AugustÂ 2021. It currently has more than [fifty-seven million articles](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias#Grand_Total) in [more than 300 languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:SiteMatrix), including 6,401,360 articles in [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language) with 124,416 active contributors in the past month.\\n\\nThe fundamental principles by which Wikipedia operates are the [five pillars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars). The [Wikipedia community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_community) has developed many [policies and guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines) to improve the encyclopedia; however, it is not a requirement to be familiar with them before contributing.\\n\\n[Anyone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Who_writes_Wikipedia%3F) is allowed to add or [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Editing) words, references, images, and other media here. What is contributed is more important than who contributes it. To remain, the content must be free of [copyright restrictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyright_violations) and contentious material [about living people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons). It must fit within Wikipedia's [policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Editing_policy), including being [verifiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiable) against a published [reliable source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_source). Editors' [opinions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view) and beliefs and [unreviewed research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Original_research) will not remain. Contributions cannot damage Wikipedia because the software allows easy reversal of mistakes, and many experienced editors are [watching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Watchlist) to ensure that edits are improvements. Begin by simply clicking the Edit button at the top of any editable page!\\n\\nWikipedia is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources in important ways. It is continually created and updated, with articles on new events appearing within minutes, rather than months or years. Because everybody can help improve it, Wikipedia has become more comprehensive than any other encyclopedia. Besides quantity, its contributors work on improving quality, removing or repairing misinformation, and other errors. Over time, articles tend to become more comprehensive and balanced. However, because anyone can click \\\"edit\\\" at any time and add content, any article may contain undetected misinformation, errors, or [vandalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism). Readers who are aware of this can obtain valid information, avoid recently added misinformation (see *[Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Researching_with_Wikipedia)*), and fix the article.\",\"timestamp\":1635436132,\"title\":\"Wikipedia:About\"},\"digest\":\"U_r-fcDqoFALL9hjTJMIpjQNpHpHhXv0P24N19TLwHc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xF75B25663c9Df75D0c3718242A9f4FB42e130C7e\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2evYLkFKZAcNiOMoMXOPjpg9brj_FNZF9kIP_7oL8Fw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"tjyQagic6QRlo3sidTWMFJLHjc8VeHBxvVoL0XiAStc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"bkam6GUurK19s9eYkA3sb2XuJZ14eD6s6PE9bA94ot6NHfxHDNU_salpkQ9ZIT6bQ85VkpGxDN2INaWmeVJENQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x936a75917969ef76ba9e273d58a72168c97f95a7024eac469e339dbd5aee4ead6b3d44d9c881f5e84a2db478b9577fb90b6e4ef52eb911c93f59bb7ac0eb9af41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2evYLkFKZAcNiOMoMXOPjpg9brj_FNZF9kIP_7oL8Fw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"tjyQagic6QRlo3sidTWMFJLHjc8VeHBxvVoL0XiAStc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"U_r-fcDqoFALL9hjTJMIpjQNpHpHhXv0P24N19TLwHc\"}"
