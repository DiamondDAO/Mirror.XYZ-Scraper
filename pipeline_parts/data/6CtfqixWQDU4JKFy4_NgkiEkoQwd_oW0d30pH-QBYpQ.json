"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"   I am the wind， the gentle wind； I am the clouds， the slow， drifting clouds； I am the water， the silent water； I am the mountains， the boundless mountains…\\n\\n    If you so want， I will be the gentle wind that will wrap around your lonely spirit！ If you so desire， I will be the slow， drifting clouds that will unquestioningly be your support！ If you so wish， I will be that silent water， without a murmur， protecting you by your side. If you so will， I will love you unrelentingly， just like those boundless， unbroken mountain ranges and valleys！ But， I regret I am not the wind and not able to take care of you. I hate that I am not the clouds and not able to bring you warmth； I pity myself that I am not the water and not able to be so pure； I am angry that I am not the mountains and not able to have my love will be as immovable as I would like.\\n\\n    I can only be myself this time， my mortal， earthly self， my only self， the only self that I can ever hope to be. I thirst for love but I do not understand her deep mystery. I strive for transcendence but I would rather be silent and nameless. I want to be mature but I would rather remain innocent. I would like that she love me， but I do not know even if I truly love her！ Endless searching， thirsting， striving， pursuing-where are my goals？ Where is my future？\\n\\n    In this mundane world， I am one lonely speck； in this universe I am a powerless particle of dust. My love， thought beautiful， is nothing great in itself. And so， I ask only to live as well as I can. In truth， there is no need to live one‘s life basking in glory， rising above men—— so long as one’s life has some value， has some security… Fearless and capricious， love will cause me great pain. Youth， transient and inconstant， will bring me loneliness. Work， busy and mindless， will make me lost. I am just searching for and waiting for some of that which shines， that which is radiant in life…\",\"timestamp\":1639616493,\"title\":\"I am the wind\"},\"digest\":\"5-7fK9gTWLL9o9BN6nqSw93_k8FqyM5tTDZDqoayAdg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9976f1B6f081addDdB296Ae3384D7C68282Cb51c\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"12_fc9G7DnUbp4teo0eocDdexscmEZzws4Dxex3qLTE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QFkuddFBpAk7YJFAQLlE-7igwbNv-X9QPI9Kkf_-1yk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"LQTllfuChbUaSIFkNp6pUYLukjWuMFh1WYk-HEVejcof8Qxm2hFb82_WVfzuLzR9eNtBgyweEApLxHLT-bO7UA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x51f3e616ae4c7c381802f6ff3f0542d9861c32624b7992a49a5abe0a1f6af1663e1a819ce7741c6ab5aca18f61a77f9acbeec6f724b9053b088ce5fc2f91dc6c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"12_fc9G7DnUbp4teo0eocDdexscmEZzws4Dxex3qLTE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QFkuddFBpAk7YJFAQLlE-7igwbNv-X9QPI9Kkf_-1yk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"5-7fK9gTWLL9o9BN6nqSw93_k8FqyM5tTDZDqoayAdg\"}"
