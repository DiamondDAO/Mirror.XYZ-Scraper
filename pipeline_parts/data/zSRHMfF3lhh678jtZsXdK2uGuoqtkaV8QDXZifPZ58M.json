"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"struggle on, bearing patiently your cross on the way to your crown!  God bless you and prosper your undertakings.  I know the country theatres well enough to know how utterly alone you will be in such companies; but keep up a good heart; we have only to do well what is given us to do, to find heaven.\\n\\nI think if you have to wait for a while it will do you no harm.  You seem to me quite frantic for immediate work; but teach yourself quiet and repose in the time you are waiting.  With half your strength I could bear to wait and labour with myself to conquer fretting.  The greatest power in the world is shown in conquest over self.  More life will be worked out of you by fretting than all the stage-playing in the world.  God bless you, my poor child.  You have indeed troubles enough; but you have a strong and earnest spirit, and you have the true religion of labour in your heart.  Therefore I have no fears for you, let what will come.  Let me hear from you at your leisure, and be sure you have no warmer friend than I am and wish to be,...\\n\\nI was exceedingly pleased to hear such an account of your first appearance.  You were quite right in all that was done, and I am rejoiced at your success.  Go on; persevere.  You will be sure to do what is right, for your heart is in the right place, your head is sound, your reading has been good.  Your mind is so much better and stronger than any other person's whom I have known enter the profession, that your career is plain before you.\\n\\nBut I will advise you to remain in your own native town for a season, or at least the winter.  You say you are afraid of remaining among people who know you.  Don't have this feeling at all.  You will have to be more particular in what you do, and the very feeling that you cannot be indifferent to your audience will make you take more pains. Beside this, you will be at home, which is much better for a time; for then at first you do not have to contend with a strange home as well as with a strange profession.  I could talk to you a volume upon this matter, but it is difficult to write.  At all events I hope you will take my counsel and remain at home this winter.  It is the most wretched thing imaginable to go from home a novice into such a theatre as any of those in the principal towns.\\n\\nOnly go on and work hard, and you will be sure to make a good position.  With regard to your faults, what shall I say?  Why, that you will try hard to overcome them.  I don't think they would be perceived save by those who perhaps imagine that your attachment for me has induced you to join the profession.  I have no mannerisms, I hope; therefore any imitation of me can only be in the earnest desire to do what you can do, as well as you can.  Write to me often; ask of me what you will; my counsel is worth little, but you shall command it if you need it.\\n\\nTO A YOUNG MOTHER\\n\\n\\\\[FROM A LETTER\\\\]\\n\\n...  All that you say about your finding your own best expression in and through the little life which is confided to you is good and true, and I am so happy to see how you feel on the subject.  I think a mother who devotes herself to her child, in watching its culture and keeping it from baleful influences, is educating and cultivating herself at the same time.  No artist work is so high, so noble, so grand, so enduring, so important for all time, as the making of character in a child, You have your own work to do, the largest possible expression.  No statue, no painting, no acting, can reach it, and it embodies each and all the arts, Clay of God's fashioning is given into your hands to mould to perfectness.  Is this not something grand to think of?  No matter about yourself--only make yourself worthy of God's sacred trust, and you will be doing His work--and that is all that human beings ought to care to live for.  Am I right?\\n\\nEARLY GRIEFS.  ART HER ONLY SPOUSE\\n\\n\\\\[FROM A LETTER TO A FRIEND\\\\]\\n\\nThere was a time, in my life of girlhood, when I thought I had been called upon to bear the very hardest thing that can come to a Woman. A very short time served to show me, in the harder battle of life Which was before me, that this had been but a spring storm, which was simply to help me to a clearer, better, richer, and more productive summer.  If I had been spared this early trial, I should never have been so earnest and faithful in my art; I should have still been casting about for the \\\"counterpart,\\\" and not given my entire self to my work, wherein and alone I have reached any excellence I have ever attained, and through which alone I have received my reward.  God helped me in my art isolation, and rewarded me for recognising him and helping myself.  This passed on; and this happened at a period in my life when most women (or children, rather) are looking to but one end in life--an end no doubt wisest and best for the largest number, but which would not have been wisest and best for my work, and so for God's work, for I know he does not fail to set me his work to do, and helps me to do it, and helps others to help me.  (Do you see this tracing back, and then forward, to an eternity of good, and do you see how better and better one can become in recognising one's self as a minister of the Almighty to faithfully carry out our part of His great plan according to our strength and ability?)  0 believe we cannot live one moment for ourselves, one moment of selfish repining, and not be failing him at that moment, hiding the God-spark in us, letting the flesh conquer the spirit, the evil dominate the good.\\n\\nThen after this first spring storm and hurricane of young disappointment came a lull--during which I actively pursued what became a passion,--my art.  Then I lost my younger brother, upon whom I had begun to build most hopefully, as I had reason.  He was by far the cleverest of my mother's children.  He had been born into greater poverty than the others; he received his young impressions through a different atmosphere; he was keener, more artistic, more impulsive, more generous, more full of genius.  I lost him by a cruel accident, and again the world seem to liquefy beneath my feet, and the waters went over my soul.  It became necessary that I should suffer bodily to cure my heart-bleed.  I placed myself professionally where I found and knew all my mortifications in my profession, which seemed for the time to strew ashes over the loss of my child-brother (for he was my child, and loved me best in all the world), thus conquering my art, which, God knows, has never failed me--never failed to bring me rich reward--never failed to bring me comfort.  I conquered my grief and myself.  Labour saved me then and always, and so I proved the eternal goodness of God.  I digress too much; but you will see how, in looking back to my own early disappointments, I can recognise all the good which came out of them, and can ask you to lay away all repinings with our darling, and hope (as we must) in God's wisdom and goodness, and ask him to help us to a clearer vision and truer knowledge of his dealings with us; to teach us to believe that we are lifted up to him better through our losses than our gains.  May it not be that heaven is nearer, the passage from earth less hard, and life less seductive to us, in consequence of the painless passing of this cherub to its true home, lent us but for a moment, to show how pure must be our lives to fit us for such companionship?  And thus, although in one sense it would be well for us to put away the sadness of this thought if it would be likely to enervate us, in another sense, if we consider it rightly, if we look upon it worthily, we have an angel in God's house to help us to higher and purer thinkings, to nobler aspirations, to more sublime sacrifices than we have ever known before.\\n\\nFAREWELL TO NEW YORK\\n\\n\\\\[In 1874 Miss Cushman bade farewell to New York at Booth's Theatre, after a performance as Lady Macbeth.  William Cullen Bryant presented an ode in her honour.  In the course of her response Miss Cushman said:\\\\]\\n\\nBeggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks, but I thank you. Gentlemen, the heart has no speech; its only language is a tear or a pressure of the hand, and words very feebly convey or interpret its emotions.  Yet I would beg you to believe that in the three little words I now speak, 'I thank you,' there are heart depths which I should fail to express better, though I should use a thousand other words.  I thank you, gentlemen, for the great honour you have offered me.  I thank you, not only for myself, but for my whole profession, to which, through and by me, you have paid this very grateful compliment. If the few words I am about to say savour of egotism or vainglory, you will, I am sure, pardon me, inasmuch as I am here only to speak of myself.  You would seem to compliment me upon an honourable life.  As I look back upon that life, it seems to me that it would have been impossible for me to have led any other.  In this I have, perhaps, been mercifully helped more than are many of my more beautiful sisters in art.  I was, by a press of circumstances, thrown at an early age into a profession for which I had received no special education or training; but I had already, though so young, been brought face to face with necessity.  I found life sadly real and intensely earnest, and in my ignorance of other ways of study, I resolved to take therefrom my text and my watchword.  To be thoroughly in earnest, intensely in earnest in all my thoughts and in all my actions, whether in my profession or out of it, became my one single idea.  And I honestly believe herein lies the secret of my success in life.  I do not believe that any great success in any art can he achieved without it....\\n\\nCLARA MORRIS\\n\\n\\\\[Clara Morris, Mrs. Frederick C. Harriott, is a native of Toronto, Canada.

McClure Company, New York, by permission, has furnished this episode.--Ed.\\\\]\\n\\nSOME RECOLLECTIONS OF JOHN WILKES BOOTH\\n\\nIn glancing back over two crowded and busy seasons, one figure stands out with clearness and beauty.  In his case only (so far as my personal knowledge goes), there was nothing derogatory to dignity or to manhood in being called beautiful, for he was that bud of splendid promise blasted to the core, before its full triumphant blooming--known to the world as a madman and an assassin, but to the profession as \\\"that unhappy boy\\\"--John Wilkes Booth.\\n\\nHe was so young, so bright, so gay--so kind.  I could not have known him well; of course, too--there are two or three different people in every man's skin; yet when we remember that stars are not generally in the habit of showing their brightest, their best side to the company at rehearsal, we cannot help feeling both respect and liking for the one who does.\\n\\nThere are not many men who can receive a gash over the eye in a scene at night, without at least a momentary outburst of temper; but when the combat between Richard and Richmond was being rehearsed, Mr. Booth had again and again urged Mr. McCollom (that six-foot tall and handsome leading-man, who entrusted me with the care of his watch during such encounters) to come on hard! to come on hot! hot, old fellow! harder-faster!   He'd take the chance of a blow--if only they could make a hot fight of it!\\n\\nAnd Mr. McCollom, who was a cold man, at night became nervous in his effort to act like a fiery one--he forgot he had struck the full number of head blows, and when Booth was pantingly expecting  a thrust, McCollom, wielding his sword with both hands, brought it down with awful force fair across Booth's forehead; a cry of horror rose, for in one moment his face was masked in blood, one eyebrow was cleanly cut through--there came simultaneously one deep groan from Richard and the exclamation:  \\\"Oh, good God! good God!\\\" from Richmond, who stood shaking like a leaf and staring at his work.  Then Booth, flinging the blood from his eyes with his left hand, said as genially as man could speak: \\\" That's all right, old man! never mind me--only come on hard, for God's sake, and save the fight!\\\"\\n\\nWhich be resumed at once, and though he was perceptibly weakened, it required the sharp order of Mr. Ellsler, to \\\"ring the first curtain bell,\\\" to force him to bring the fight to a close a single blow shorter than usual.  Then there was a running to and fro, with ice and vinegar-paper and raw steak and raw oysters.  When the doctor had placed a few stitches where they were most required, he laughingly declared there was provision enough in the room to start a restaurant. Mr. McCollom came to try to apologise--to explain, but Booth would have none of it; be held out his hand, crying:  \\\"Why, old fellow, you look as if you had lost the blood.  Don't worry--now if my eye had gone, that would have been bad!\\\"  And so with light words he tried to set the unfortunate man at ease, and though he must have suffered much mortification as well as pain from the eye--that in spite of all endeavours would blacken--he never made a sign.\\n\\nHe was, like his great elder brother, rather lacking in height, but his head and throat, and the manner of their rising from his shoulders, were truly beautiful, His colouring was unusual--the ivory pallor of his skin, the inky blackness of his densely thick hair, the heavy lids of his glowing eyes were all Oriental, and they gave a touch of mystery to his face when it fell into gravity--but there was generally a flash of white teeth behind his silky moustache, and a laugh in his eyes.\\n\\nI played the Player-Queen to my great joy, and in the \\\"Marble Heart\\\" I was one of the group of three statues in the first act.  We were supposed to represent Lais, Aspasia, and Phryne, and when we read the cast I glanced at the other girls (we were not strikingly handsome) and remarked, gravely:  \\\"Well, it's a comfort to know that we look so like the three beautiful Grecians.\\\"\\n\\nA laugh at our backs brought us around suddenly to face Mr. Booth, who said to me:\\n\\n\\\"You satirical little wretch, how do you come to know these Grecian ladies?  Perhaps you have the advantage of them in being all beautiful within?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I wish it would strike outward then,\\\" I answered.  \\\"You know it's always best to have things come to the surface!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know some very precious things are hidden from common sight; and I know, too, you caught my meaning in the first place.  Good night!\\\" and he left us.\\n\\nWe had been told to descend to the stage at night with our white robes hanging free and straight, that Mr. Booth himself might drape them as we stood upon the pedestal.  It really is a charming picture--that of the statues in the first act.  Against a backing of black velvet the three white figures, carefully posed, strongly lighted, stand out so marble-like that when they slowly turn their faces and point to their chosen master, the effect is uncanny enough to chill the looker-on.\\n\\nWell, with white wigs, white tights, and white robes, and half strangled with the powder we had inhaled in our efforts to make our lips stay white, we cautiously descended the stairs  we dared not talk, we dared not blink our eyes, for fear of disturbing the coat of powder-we were lifted to the pedestal and took our places as we expected to stand.  Then Mr. Booth came--such a picture in his Greek garments as made even the men exclaim at him--and began to pose us. It happened one of us had very good limbs, one medium good, and the third had, apparently, walked on broom-sticks.  When Mr. Booth slightly raised the drapery of No. 3 his features gave a twist as though he had suddenly tasted lemon-juice, but quick as a flash he said:\\n\\n\\\"I believe I'11 advance you to the centre for the stately and wise Aspasia\\\"--the central figure wore her draperies hanging straight to her feet, hence the \\\"advance\\\" and consequent concealment of the unlovely limbs.  It was quickly and kindly done, for the girl was not only spared mortification, but in the word \\\"advance\\\" she saw a compliment and was happy accordingly.  Then my turn came.  My arms were placed about Aspasia, my head bent and turned and twisted--my upon my breast so that the forefinger touched my chin--I felt I was a personified simper; but I was silent and patient, until the arrangement of my draperies began--then I squirmed anxiously.\\n\\n\\\"Take care--take care!\\\" he cautioned.  \\\"You will sway the others if you move!\\\"  But in spite of the risk of my marble makeup I faintly groaned:  \\\"Oh dear! must it be like that?\\\"\\n\\nRegardless of the pins in the corner of his mouth he burst into laughter, and, taking a photograph from the bosom of his Greek shirt, he said:  \\\"I expected a protest from you, Miss, so I came prepared--don't move your head, but just look at this.\\\"\\n\\nHe held the picture of a group of statuary up to me.  \\\"This is you on the right.  It's not so dreadful; now, is it?\\\"  And I cautiously murmured: \\\"That if I wasn't any worse than that I wouldn't mind.\\\"\\n\\nAnd so we were all satisfied, and our statue scene was very successful.  Next morning I saw Mr. Booth come running out of the theatre on his way to the telegraph office at the corner, and right in the middle of the walk, staring about him, stood a child--a small roamer of the stony streets, who had evidently got far enough beyond his native ward to arouse misgivings as to his personal safety, and at the very moment he stopped to consider matters Mr. Booth dashed out of the stage-door and added to his bewilderment by capsizing him completely.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, good lord!  Baby, are you hurt?\\\" exclaimed Mr. Booth, pausing instantly to pick up the dirty, tousled small heap and stand it on its bandy legs again.\\n\\n\\\"Don't cry, little chap!\\\"  And the aforesaid little chap not only ceased to cry, but gave him a damp and grimy smile, at which the actor bent towards him quickly, but paused, took out his handkerchief, and first carefully wiping the dirty little nose and mouth, stooped and kissed him heartily, put some change in each freckled paw, and continued his run to the telegraph office.\\n\\nHe knew of no witness to the act.  To kiss a pretty, clean child under the approving eyes of mamma might mean nothing but politeness, but surely it required the prompting of a warm and tender heart to make a young and thoughtless man feel for and caress such a dirty, forlorn bit of babyhood as that.\\n\\nOf his work I suppose I was too young and too ignorant to judge correctly, but I remember well hearing the older members of the company express their opinions.  Mr. Ellsler, who had been on terms of friendship with the elder Booth, was delighted with the promise of his work.  He greatly admired Edwin's intellectual power, his artistic care; but \\\"John,\\\" he cried, \\\"has more of the old man's power in one performance than Edwin can show in a year.  He has the fire, the dash, the touch of strangeness.  He often produces unstudied effects at night.  I question him: 'Did you rehearse that business to-day, John?' He answers:\\n\\n'No; I didn't rehearse it, it just came to me in the scene and I couldn't help doing it, but it went all right didn't it?'  Full of impulse just now, like a colt, his heels are in the air nearly as often as his head, but wait a year or two till he gets used to the harness and quiets down a bit, and you will see as great an actor as America can produce!\\\"\\n\\nOne morning, going on the stage where a group were talking with John Wilkes, I beard him say: \\\"No; oh, no:  There's but one Hamlet to my mind--that's my brother Edwin.  You see, between ourselves, he is Hamlet--melancholy and all!\\\"\\n\\nTHE MURDER OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN\\n\\nThat was an awful time, when the dread news came to us.  We were in Columbus, Ohio.  We had been horrified by the great crime at Washington.  My room-mate and I had, from our small earnings, bought some black cotton at a tripled price, as all the black material in the city was not sufficient to meet the demand; and as we tacked it about our one window, a man passing told us the assassin had been discovered, and that he was the actor Booth.  Hattie laughed, so she nearly swallowed the tack that, girl-like, she held between her lips, and I after a laugh, told him it was a poor subject for a jest, and we went in.  There was no store in Columbus then where play-books were sold, and as Mr. Ellsler had a very large and complete stage library, he frequently lent his books to us, and we would hurriedly copy out our lines and return the book for his own use.  On that occasion he was going to study his part first and then leave the play with us as he passed, going home.  We heard his knock.  I was busy pressing a bit of stage finery.  Hattie opened the door, and then I heard her exclaiming: \\\"Why--why--what!\\\"  I turned quickly.  Mr. Ellsler was coming slowly into the room.  He is a very dark man, but be was perfectly livid then--his lips even were blanched to the whiteness of his cheeks.  His eyes were dreadful, they were so glassy and seemed so unseeing.  He was devoted to his children, and all I could think of as likely to bring such a look upon his face was disaster to one of them, and I cried, as I drew a chair to him:  \\\"What is it?  Oh, what has happened to them?\\\"\\n\\nHe sank down--he wiped his brow--he looked almost stupidly at me; then, very faintly, he said: \\\"You--haven't--heard--anything?\\\"\\n\\nLike a flash Hattie's eyes and mine met.  We thought of the supposed ill-timed jest of the stranger.  My lips moved wordlessly.  Hattie stammered: \\\"A man--he--lied though--said that Wilkes Booth--but he did lie--didn't he?\\\" and in the same faint voice Mr. Ellsler answered slowly:  \\\"No--no! he did not lie--it's true!\\\"\\n\\nDown fell our heads, and the waves of shame and sorrow seemed fairly to overwhelm us; and while our sobs filled the little room, Mr. Ellsler rose and laid two playbooks on the table.  Then, while standing there, staring into space, I heard his far, faint voice saying: \\\"So great--so good a man destroyed, and by the hand of that unhappy boy! my God! my God!\\\"  He wiped his brow again and slowly left the house, apparently unconscious of our presence.\\n\\nWhen we resumed our work--the theatre had closed because of the national calamity--many a painted cheek showed runnels made by bitter tears, and one old actress, with quivering lips, exclaimed:  \\\"One woe doth tread upon another's heels, so fast they follow!\\\" but with no thought of quoting, and God knows, the words expressed the situation perfectly.\\n\\nMrs. Ellsler, whom I never saw shed a tear for any sickness, sorrow, or trouble of her own, shed tears for the mad boy, who had suddenly become the assassin of God's anointed--the great, the blameless Lincoln.\\n\\nWe crept about, quietly.  Every one winced at the sound of the overture.  It was as if one dead lay within the walls--one who belonged to us.\\n\\nWhen the rumours about Booth being the murderer proved to be authentic, the police feared a possible outbreak of mob feeling, and a demonstration against the theatre building, or against the actors individually; but we had been a decent, law-abiding, well-behaved people--liked and respected--so we were not made to suffer for the awful act of one of our number.  Still, when the mass-meeting was held in front of the Capitol, there was much anxiety on the subject, and Mr. Ellsler urged all the company to keep away from it, lest their presence might arouse some ill-feeling.  The crowd was immense, the sun had gloomed over, and the Capitol building, draped in black, loomed up with stern severity and that massive dignity only attained by heavily columned buildings.  The people surged like waves about the speaker's stand, and the policemen glanced anxiously toward the not far away new theatre, and prayed that some bombastic, revengeful ruffian might not crop up from this mixed crowd of excited humanity to stir them to violence.\\n\\nThree speakers, however, in their addresses had confined themselves to eulogising the great dead.  In life Mr. Lincoln had been abused by many--in death he was worshipped by all; and these speakers found their words of love and sorrow eagerly listened to, and made no harsh allusions to the profession from which the assassin sprang.  And then an unknown man clambered up from the crowd to the portico platform and began to speak, without asking any one's permission.  He had a far-reaching voice--he had fire and go.\\n\\n\\\"Here's the fellow to look out for!\\\" said the policemen; and, sure enough, suddenly the dread word \\\"theatre\\\" was tossed into the air, and every one was still in a moment, waiting for--what?  I don't know what they hoped for--I do know what many feared; but this is what he said: \\\"Yes, look over at our theatre and think of the little body of men and women there, who are to-day sore-hearted and cast down; who feel that they are looked at askant, because one of their number has committed that hideous crime!  Think of what they have to bear of shame and horror, and spare them, too, a little pity!\\\"\\n\\nHe paused.  It had been a bold thing to do--to appeal for consideration for actors at such a time.  The crowd swayed for a moment to and fro, a curious growling came from it, and then all heads turned toward the theatre.  A faint cheer was given, and afterward there was not the slightest allusion made to us--and verily we were grateful.\\n\\nThat the homely, tender-hearted \\\"Father Abraham\\\"--rare combination of courage, justice, and humanity--died at an actor's hand will be a grief, a horror, and a shame to the profession forever; yet I cannot believe that John Wilkes Booth was \\\"the leader of a band of bloody conspirators.\\\"\\n\\nWho shall draw a line and say: here genius ends and madness begins? There was that touch of--strangeness.  In Edwin it was a profound melancholy; in John it was an exaggeration of spirit--almost a wildness.  There was the natural vanity of the actor, too, who craves a dramatic situation in real life.  There was his passionate love and sympathy for the South--why, he was \\\"easier to be played on than a pipe.\\\"\\n\\nUndoubtedly he conspired to kidnap the President--that would appeal to him; but after that I truly believe he was a tool--certainly he was no leader.  Those who led him knew his courage, his belief in Fate, his loyalty to his friends; and, because they knew these things, he drew the lot, as it was meant he should from the first.  Then, half mad, he accepted the part Fate cast him for--committed the monstrous crime, and paid the awful price.  And since\\n\\n```\\n God moves in a mysterious way      His wonders to perform,\\n```\\n\\nwe venture to pray for His mercy upon the guilty soul who may have repented and confessed his manifold sins and offences during those awful hours of suffering before the end came.\\n\\nAnd \\\"God shutteth not up His mercies forever in displeasure!\\\"  We can only shiver and turn our thoughts away from the bright light that went out in such utter darkness.  Poor, guilty, unhappy John Wilkes Booth!\\n\\nWHEN IN MY HUNT FOR A LEADING MAN FOR MR. DALY I FIRST SAW COGHLAN AND IRVING\\n\\n\\\\[From \\\"Life of a Star\\\" copyright by the S. S. McClure Company, New York, 1906.\\\\]\\n\\nWhen the late Mr. Augustin Daly bestowed even a modicum of his confidence, his friendship, upon man or woman, the person so honoured found the circulation of his blood well maintained by the frequent and generally unexpected demands for his presence, his unwavering attention, and sympathetic comprehension.  As with the royal invitation that is a command, only death positive or threatening could excuse non-attendance; and though his friendship was in truth a liberal education, the position of even the humblest confidant was no sinecure, for the plans he loved to describe and discuss were not confined to that day and season, but were long, daring looks ahead; great coups for the distant, unborn years.\\n\\nThe season had closed on Saturday.  Monday I was to sail for England, and early that morning the housemaid watched for the carriage.  My landlady was growing quivery about the chin, because I had to cross alone to join Mr. and Mrs. James Lewis, who had gone ahead, My mother was gay with a sort of crippled hilarity that deceived no one, as she prepared to go with me to say good bye at the dock, while little Ned, the son of the house, proudly gathered together rug, umbrella, hand-bag, books, etc., ready to go down with us and escort my mother back home--when a cab whirled to the door and stopped.\\n\\n\\\"Good heaven!\\\" I cried, \\\"what a blunder!  I ordered a carriage; we can't all crowd into that thing!\\\"\\n\\nThen a boy was before me, holding out one of those familiar summoning half-sheets, with a line or two of the jetty-black, impishly-tiny, Daly scrawls--and I read: \\\"Must see you one minute at office.  Cabby will race you down.  Have your carriage follow and pick you up here. Don't fail!  A. DALY.\\\"\\n\\nAh, well!  A. Daly--he who must be obeyed--had me in good training.  I flung one hand to the mistress, the other to the maid in farewell, pitched headlong into the cab, and went whirling down Sixth Avenue and across to the theatre stage-door, then upstairs to the morsel of space called by courtesy the private office.\\n\\nMr. Daly nonchalantly held out his band, looked me over, and said: \\\"That's a very pretty dress--becoming too--but is it not too easily soiled?  Salt water you know is--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" I broke in, \\\"it's for general street wear--my travelling will be done in nightdress, I fancy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, bad sailor, eh?\\\" he asked, as I stood trembling with impatience.\\n\\n\\\"The worst!  But you did not send for me to talk dress or about my sailing qualities?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My dear,\\\" he said suavely, \\\"your temper is positively rabid.\\\"  Then he glanced at the clock on his desk and his manner changed.
