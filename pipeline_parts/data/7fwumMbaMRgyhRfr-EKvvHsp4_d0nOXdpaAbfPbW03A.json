"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"Feet off the table-cloth!\\\" said the old goblin. They obeyed,\\n\\nbut not immediately. Then they tickled the ladies who waited at table,\\n\\nwith the fir-cones, which they carried in their pockets. They took off\\n\\ntheir boots, that they might be more at ease, and gave them to the\\n\\nladies to hold. But their father, the old goblin, was very\\n\\ndifferent; he talked pleasantly about the stately Norwegian rocks, and\\n\\ntold fine tales of the waterfalls which dashed over them with a\\n\\nclattering noise like thunder or the sound of an organ, spreading\\n\\ntheir white foam on every side. He told of the salmon that leaps in\\n\\nthe rushing waters, while the water-god plays on his golden harp. He\\n\\nspoke of the bright winter nights, when the sledge bells are\\n\\nringing, and the boys run with burning torches across the smooth\\n\\nice, which is so transparent that they can see the fishes dart forward\\n\\nbeneath their feet. He described everything so clearly, that those who\\n\\nlistened could see it all; they could see the saw-mills going, the\\n\\nmen-servants and the maidens singing songs, and dancing a rattling\\n\\ndance,- when all at once the old goblin gave the old elfin maiden a\\n\\nkiss, such a tremendous kiss, and yet they were almost strangers to\\n\\neach other.\\n\\n```\\nThen the elfin girls had to dance, first in the usual way, and\\n```\\n\\nthen with stamping feet, which they performed very well; then followed\\n\\nthe artistic and solo dance. Dear me, how they did throw their legs\\n\\nabout! No one could tell where the dance begun, or where it ended, nor\\n\\nindeed which were legs and which were arms, for they were all flying\\n\\nabout together, like the shavings in a saw-pit! And then they spun\\n\\nround so quickly that the death-horse and the grave-pig became sick\\n\\nand giddy, and were obliged to leave the table.\",\"timestamp\":1636531752,\"title\":\"Feet off the table-cloth\"},\"digest\":\"e7hlTxGFvfAE8pkRkAaGAxeSm2HOFOBzmITnWtm7txY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD6FFaeE2D21c98999e3c40052687ea652b1411a9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1ZNGbA8hw50NqTEH60pjWtttAxTmj-O0q7ZAWIpIk0I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Epibr8SDl9ci73c4unNeA-8NllUfAXuSKPWIm6Niu6Y\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"-0CdonfrbnopBNQgdxsjfLn5tgSQJq74FIQbolq4wEI-IfznxO038_Q4QKJxqvcztvXr5O-nAWI5I5XwZsmCqw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb13d364ecd5e04aa25ca6557de5d189f61a2cbb86427e42295a20a7b062a8d42191f967d5c21fc550f4cef070e74615201c656b41dc700c6e43dad71f764389b1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1ZNGbA8hw50NqTEH60pjWtttAxTmj-O0q7ZAWIpIk0I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Epibr8SDl9ci73c4unNeA-8NllUfAXuSKPWIm6Niu6Y\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"e7hlTxGFvfAE8pkRkAaGAxeSm2HOFOBzmITnWtm7txY\"}"
