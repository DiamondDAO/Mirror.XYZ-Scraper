"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"toward the adventurers from the United States in Central America.  The Vicksburg Convention adopted resolutions which were thinly veiled endorsements of southward expansion.  In the early autumn another Nicaraguan expedition was nipped in the bud by the vigilance of American naval forces.  Cobb, prime factor in the group of Southern moderates as well as Secretary of the Treasury, wrote to Buchanan expressing his satisfaction at the event, mentioning the work of his own department in bringing it about, and also alluding to his arrangments to prevent slave trading off the Florida coast.\\n\\nBut the spirit of doubt was strong even among the moderates. Douglas was the target.  Stephens gives a glimpse of it in a letter written during his last session in Congress.  \\\"Cobb called on me Saturday night,\\\" he writes.  \\\"He is exceedingly bitter against Douglas.  I joked him a good deal, and told him he had better not fight, or he would certainly be whipped; that is, in driving Douglas out of the Democratic party.  He said that if Douglas ever was restored to the confidence of the Democracy of Georgia, it would be over his dead body politically.  This shows his excitement, that is all.  I laughed at him, and told him he would run his feelings and his policy into the ground.\\\"  The anger of Cobb, who was himself a confessed candidate for the Democratic nomination, was imperiling the Democratic national machine which Toombs was still struggling so resolutely to hold together.  Indeed, as late as the autumn of 1859 the machine still held together.\\n\\nThen came the man of destiny, the bolt from the blue, the end of the chapter.  A marvelous fanatic--a sort of reincarnation of the grimmest of the Covenanters--by one daring act shattered the machine and made impossible any further coalition on the principle of \\\"nothing doing.\\\"  This man of destiny was John Brown, whose attack on Harper's Ferry took place October 16th, and whose execution by the authorities of Virginia on the charges of murder and treason occurred on the 2nd of December.\\n\\nThe incident filled the South with consternation.  The prompt condemnation of it by many Republican leaders did not offset, in the minds of Southerners, the fury of praise accorded by others. The South had a ghastly tradition derived chiefly from what is known as Nat Turner's Rebellion in Virginia, a tradition of the massacre of white women and children by negroes.  As Brown had set opt to rouse a slave rebellion, every Southerner familiar with his own traditions shuddered, identifying in imagination John Brown and Nat Turner.  Horror became rage when the Southerners heard of enthusiastic applause in Boston and of Emerson's description of Brown as \\\"that new saint\\\" who was to \\\"make the gallows glorious like the cross.\\\"  In the excitement produced by remarks such as this, justice was not done to Lincoln's censure.  In his speech at Cooper Institute in New York, in February, 1860, Lincoln had said: \\\"John Brown's effort...in its philosophy corresponds with the many attempts related in history at the assassination of kings and emperors.  An enthusiast broods over the oppression of a people, until he fancies himself commissioned by Heaven to liberate them. He ventures the attempt which ends in little else than in his own execution.\\\"  A few months afterwards, the Republican national convention condemned the act of Brown as \\\"among the gravest of crimes.\\\"\\n\\nAn immediate effect of the John Brown episode was a passionate outburst from all the radical press of the South in defense of slavery.  The followers of Yancey made the most of their opportunity.  The men who voted at Vicksburg to reopen the slave trade could find no words to measure their hatred of every one who, at this moment of crisis, would not declare slavery a blessing. Many of the men who opposed the slave traders also felt that, in the face of possible slave insurrection, the peril of their families was the one paramount consideration.  Nevertheless, it is easy for the special pleader to give a wrong impression of the sentiment of the time.  A grim desire for self-preservation took possession of the South, as well as a deadly fear of any person or any thing that tended directly or indirectly to incite the blacks to insurrection.  Northerners of abolitionist sympathies were warned to leave the country, and in some cases they were tarred and feathered.\\n\\nGreat anger was aroused by the detection of book-agents who were distributing a furious polemic against slavery, \\\"The Impending Crisis of the South: How to Meet It\\\", by Hinton Rowan Helper, a Southerner of inferior social position belonging to the class known as poor whites.  The book teemed with such sentences as this, addressing slaveholders: \\\"Do you aspire to become victims of white non-slave-holding vengeance by day and of barbarous massacres by the negroes at night?\\\"  It is scarcely strange, therefore, that in 1859 no Southerner would hear a good word of anyone caught distributing the book. And yet, in the midst of all this vehement exaltation of slavery, the fight to prevent a reopening of the slave trade went bravely on.  Stephens, writing to a friend who was correspondent for the \\\"Southern Confederacy\\\", in Atlanta, warned him in April, 1860, \\\"neither to advocate disunion or the opening of the slave trade. The people here at present I believe are as much opposed to it as they are at the North; and I believe the Northern people could be induced to open it sooner than the Southern people.\\\"\\n\\nThe winter of 1859-1860 witnessed a famous congressional battle over the speakership.  The new Congress which met in December contained 109 Republicans, 101 Democrats, and 27 Know-Nothings. The Republican candidate for speaker was John Sherman of Ohio.  As the first ballot showed that he could not command a majority, a Democrat from Missouri introduced this resolution \\\"Whereas certain members of this House, now in nomination for speaker, did endorse the book hereinafter mentioned, resolved, That the doctrines and sentiments of a certain book, called 'The Impending Crisis of the South: How to Meet It', are insurrectionary and hostile to the peace and tranquillity of the country, and that no member of this House, who has indorsed or recommended it, is fit to be speaker of the House.\\\"\\n\\nDuring two months there were strange scenes in the House, while the clerk acted as temporary speaker and furious diatribes were thundered back and forth across the aisle that separated Republicans from Democrats, with a passage of fisticuffs or even a drawn pistol to add variety to the scene.  The end of it all was a deal.  Pennington, of the \\\"People's Party\\\" of New Jersey, who had supported Sherman but had not endorsed Helper, was given the Republican support; a Know-Nothing was made sergeant-at-arms; and Know-Nothing votes added to the Republican votes made Pennington speaker.  In many Northern cities the news of his election was greeted with the great salute of a hundred guns, but at Richmond the papers came out in mourning type.\\n\\nTwo great figures now advanced to the center of the Congressional stage--Jefferson Davis, Senator from Mississippi, a lean eagle of a man with piercing blue eyes, and Judah P. Benjamin, Senator from Louisiana, whose perpetual smile cloaked an intellect that was nimble, keen, and ruthless.  Both men were destined to play leading roles in the lofty drama of revolution; each was to experience a tragic ending of his political hope, one in exile, the other in a solitary proscription amid the ruins of the society for which he had sacrified his all.  These men, though often spoken of as mere mouthpieces of Yancey, were in reality quite different from him both in temper and in point of view.\\n\\nDavis, who was destined eventually to become the target of Yancey's bitterest enmity, had refused ten years before to join in the secession movement which ignored Calhoun's doctrine that the South had become a social unit.  Though a believer in slavery under the conditions of the moment, Davis had none of the passion of the slave baron for slavery at all costs.  Furthermore, as events were destined to show in a startlingly dramatic way, he was careless of South Carolina's passion for state rights.  He was a practical politician, but not at all the old type of the party of political evasion, the type of Toombs.  No other man of the moment was on the whole so well able to combine the elements of Southern politics against those more negative elements of which Toombs was the symbol.  The history of the Confederacy shows that the combination which Davis now effected was not as thorough as he supposed it was.  But at the moment he appeared to succeed and seemed to give common purpose to the vast majority of the Southern people.  With his ally Benjamin, he struck at the Toombs policy of a National Democratic party.\\n\\nOn the day following the election of Pennington, Davis introduced in the Senate a series of resolutions which were to serve as the Southern ultimatum, and which demanded of Congress the protection of slavery against territorial legislatures.  This was but carrying to its logical conclusion that Dred Scott decision which Douglas and his followers proposed to accept.  If Congress could not restrict slavery in the territories, how could its creature, a territorial legislature do so?  And yet the Douglas men attempted to take away the power from Congress and to retain it for the territorial legislatures.  Senator Pugh of Ohio had already locked horns with Davis on this point, and had attempted to show that a territorial Legislature was independent of Congress. \\\"Then I would ask the Senator further,\\\" retorted the logical Davis, \\\"why it is he makes an appropriation to pay members of the territorial legislature; how it is that he invests the Governor with veto power over their acts; and how it is that he appoints judges to decide upon the validity of their acts.\\\"\\n\\nIn the Democratic convention which met at Charleston in April, 1860, the waning power of political evasion made its last real stand against the rising power of political positivism.  To accept Douglas and the idea that somehow territorial legislatures were free to do what Congress could not do, or to reject Douglas and endorse Davis's ultimatum--that in substance was the issue.  \\\"In this convention where there should be confidence and harmony,\\\" said the \\\"Charleston Mercury\\\", \\\"it is plain that men feel as if they were going into a battle.\\\"  In the committee on resolutions where the States were equally represented, the majority were anti-Douglas; they submitted a report affirming Davis's position that territorial legislatures had no right to prohibit slavery and that the Federal Government should protect slavery against them. The minority refused to go further than an approval of the Dred Scott case and a pledge to abide by all future decisions of the Supreme Court.  After both reports had been submitted, there followed the central event of the convention--the now famous speech by Yancey which repudiated political evasion from top to bottom, frankly defended slavery, and demanded either complete guarantees for its continued existence or, as an alternative, Southern independence.  Pugh instantly replied and summed up Yancey's speech as a demand upon Northern Democrats to say that slavery was right, and that it was their duty not only to let slavery alone but to aid in extending it.  \\\"Gentlemen of the South,\\\" he exclaimed, \\\"you mistake us--you mistake us--we will not do it.\\\"\\n\\nIn the full convention, where the representation of the States was not equal, the Douglas men, after hot debate, forced the adoption of the minority report.  Thereupon the Alabama delegation protested and formally withdrew from the convention, and other delegations followed.  There was wild excitement in Charleston, where that evening in the streets Yancey addressed crowds that cheered for a Southern republic.  The remaining history of the Democratic nominations is a matter of detail.  The Charleston convention adjourned without making nominations.  Each of its fragments reorganized as a separate convention, and ultimately two Democratic tickets were put into the field, with Breckinridge of Kentucky as the candidate on the Yancey ticket and Douglas on the other.\\n\\nWhile the Democrats were thus making history through their fateful break-up into separate parties, a considerable number of the so-called best people of the country determined that they had nowhere politically to lay their heads.  A few of the old Whigs were still unable to consort either with Republicans or with Democrats, old or new.  The Know-Nothings, likewise, though their number had been steadily melting away, had not entirely disappeared.  To unite these political remnants in any definite political whole seemed beyond human ingenuity.  A common sentiment, however, they did have--a real love of the Union and a real unhappiness, because its existence appeared to be threatened.  The outcome was that they organized the Constitutional Union Party, nominating for President John Bell of Tennessee, and for Vice President Edward Everett of Massachusetts.  Their platform was little more than a profession of love of the Union and a condemnation of sectional selfishness.\\n\\nThis Bell and Everett ticket has a deeper significance than has generally been admitted.  It reveals the fact that the sentiment of Union, in distinction from the belief in the Union, had become a real force in American life.  There could be no clearer testimony to the strength of this feeling than this spectacle of a great congregation of moderate people, unable to agree upon anything except this sentiment, stepping between the sectional parties like a resolute wayfarer going forward into darkness along a perilous strand between two raging seas.  That this feeling of Union was the same thing as the eager determination of the Republicans, in 1860, to control the Government is one of those historical fallacies that have had their day.  The Republican party became, in time and under stress of war, the refuge of this sentiment and proved sufficiently far-sighted to merge its identity temporarily in the composite Union party of 1864.  But in 1860 it was still a sectional party.  Among its leaders Lincoln was perhaps the only Unionist in the same sense as Bell and Everett.\\n\\nPerhaps the truest Unionists of the North, outside the Constitutional Union Party, in 1860, were those Democrats in the following of Douglas who, after fighting to the last ditch against both the sectional parties, were to accept, in 1861, the alternative of war rather than dissolution.  The course of Douglas himself, as we shall see hereafter, showed that in his mind there was a fixed limit of concession beyond which he could not go. When circumstances forced him to that limit, the sentiment of Union took control of him, swept aside his political jugglery, abolished his time-serving, and drove him into cooperation with his bitterest foes that the Union might be saved.  Nor was the pure sentiment of Union confined to the North and West.  Though undoubtedly the sentiment of locality was more powerful through the South, yet when the test came in the election of 1860, the leading candidate of the upper South, in Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee, was John Bell, the Constitutional Unionist.  In every Southern State this sentiment was able to command a considerable part of the vote.\\\\*\\n\\n\\\\*A possible exception was South Carolina.  As the presidential electors were appointed by the legislature, there is no certain record of minority sentiment.\\n\\nWidely different in temper were those stern and resolute men whose organization, in perfect fighting trim, faced eagerly the divided Democrats.  The Republicans had no division among themselves upon doctrine.  Such division as existed was due to the ordinary rivalry of political leaders.  In the opinion of all his enemies and of most Americans, Seward was the Republican man of the hour. During much of 1859 he had discreetly withdrawn from the country and had left to his partisans the conduct of his campaign, which seems to have been going well when he returned in the midst of the turmoil following the death of John Brown.  Nevertheless he was disturbed over his prospects, for he found that in many minds, both North and South, he was looked upon as the ultimate cause of all the turmoil.  His famous speech on the \\\"irrepressible conflict\\\" was everywhere quoted as an exultant prophecy of these terrible latter days.\\n\\nIt was long the custom to deny to Seward any good motive in a speech which he now delivered, just as it was to deny Webster any good motive for his famous 7th of March speech.  But such criticism is now less frequent than it used to be.  Both men were seeking the Presidency; both, we may fairly believe, were shocked by the turmoil of political currents; each tried oiling the waters, and in the attempt each ruined his candidacy.  Seward's speech in condemnation of John Brown in February, 1860, was an appeal to the conservative North against the radical North, and to many of his followers it seemed a change of front.  It certainly gained him no new friends and it lost him some old ones, so that his star as a presidential candidate began its decline.\\n\\nThe first ballot in the Republican convention surprised the country.  Of the votes, 233 were necessary for a choice.  Seward had only 173 1/2.  Next to him, with 102 votes, stood none of the leading candidates, but the comparatively obscure Lincoln.  A gap of more than 50 votes separated Lincoln from Cameron, Chase, and Bates.  On the second ballot Seward gained 11 votes, while Lincoln gained 79.  The enemies of Seward, finding it impossible to combine on any of the conspicuous candidates, were moving toward Lincoln, the man with fewest enemies.  The third ballot gave Lincoln the nomination.\\n\\nWe have seen that one of the basal questions of the time was which new political group should absorb the Whig remainder.  The Constitutional Union party aimed to accomplish this.  The Republicans sought to out-maneuver them.  They made their platform as temperate as they could and yet consistent with the maintenance of their opposition to Douglas and popular sovereignty; and they went no further in their anti-slavery demands than that the territories should be preserved for free labor.\\n\\nAnother basal question had been considered in the Republican platform.  Where would Northern capital stand in the reorganization of parties?  Was capital, like men, to become frankly sectional or would it remain impersonal, careless how nations rose or fell, so long as dividends continued?  To some extent capital had given an answer.  When, in the excitement following the John Brown incident, a Southern newspaper published a white list of New York merchants whose political views should commend them to Southerners, and a black list of those who were objectionable, many New Yorkers sought a place in the white list. Northern capital had done its part in financing the revived slave trade. August Belmont, the New York representative of the Rothschilds, was one of the close allies of Davis, Yancey, and Benjamin in their war upon Douglas.  In a word, a great portion of Northern capital had its heart where its investments were--in the South. But there was other capital which obeyed the same law, and which had investments in the North; and with this capital the Republicans had been trafficking.  They had succeeded in winning over the powerful manufacturing interests of Pennsylvania, the pivotal State that had elected Buchanan in 1856.\\n\\nThe steps by which the new party of enthusiasm made its deal with the body of capital which was not at one with Belmont and the Democrats are not essential to the present narrative.  Two facts suffice.  In 1857 a great collapse in American business--\\\"the panic of fifty-seven\\\"--led the commercial world to turn to the party in power for some scheme of redress.  But their very principles, among which was non-intervention in business, made the Democrats feeble doctors for such a need, and they evaded the situation.  The Republicans, with their insistence on positivism in government, had therefore an opportunity to make a new application of the doctrine of governmental aid to business.  In the spring of 1860, the Republican House of Representatives passed the Morrill tariff bill, consideration of which was postponed by the Democratic Senate.  But it served its purpose: it was a Republican manifesto.  The Republicans felt that this bill, together with their party platform, gave the necessary guarantee to the Pennsylvania manufacturers, and they therefore entered the campaign confident they would carry Pennsylvania nor was their confidence misplaced.\\n\\nThe campaign was characterized by three things: by an ominous quiet coupled with great intensity of feeling; by the organization of huge party societies in military form--\\\"Wide-awakes\\\" for Lincoln, numbering 400,000, and \\\"Minute Men\\\" for Breckenridge, with a membership chiefly Southern; and by the perfect frankness, in all parts of the South, of threats of secession in case the Republicans won.\\n\\nIn none of the States which eventually seceded were any votes cast for Lincoln, with the exception of a small number in Virginia.  In almost all the other Southern States and in the slave-holding border States, all the other candidates made respectable showings. In Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky, Bell led.  But everywhere else in the other slave-holding States Breckinridge led, excepting in Missouri where Douglas won by a few hundred.  Every free State except New Jersey went for Lincoln.  And yet he did not have a majority of the popular vote, which stood: Lincoln, 1,866,459; Douglas, 1,376,957; Breckinridge, 849,781; Bell, 588,879\\\\*.  The majority against Lincoln was nearly a million.  The distribution of the votes was such that Lincoln had in the Electoral College, 180 electors; Breckinridge, 72; Bell, 39; Douglas, 12.  In neither House of Congress did the Republicans have a majority.\\n\\n\\\\*The figures of the popular vote are variously given by different compilers.  These are taken from Stanwood, \\\"A History of the Presidency\\\".\\n\\nCHAPTER V. SECESSION\\n\\nIn tracing American history from 1854 to 1860 we cannot fail to observe that it reduces itself chiefly to a problem in that science which politicians understand so well--applied psychology. Definite types of men moulded by the conditions of those days are the determining factors--not the slavery question in itself; not, primarily, economic forces; not a theory of government, nor a clash of theories; not any one thing; but the fluid, changeful forces of human nature, battling with circumstances and expressing themselves in the fashion of men's minds.  To say this is to acknowledge the fatefulness of sheer feeling.  Davis described the situation exactly when he said, in 1860, \\\"A sectional hostility has been substituted for a general fraternity.\\\"  To his own question, \\\"Where is the remedy?\\\" he gave the answer, \\\"In the hearts of the people.\\\"  There, after all, is the conclusion of the whole matter.  The strife between North and South had ceased to be a thing of the head; it had become a thing of the heart.  Granted the emotions of 1860, the way in which our country staggered into war has all the terrible fascination of a tragedy on the theme of fate.\\n\\nThat a secession movement would begin somewhere in the South before the end of 1860 was a foregone conclusion.  South Carolina was the logical place, and in South Carolina the inevitable occurred.  The presidential election was quickly followed by an election of delegates, on the 6th of December, to consider in convention the relations of the State with the Union.  The arguments before the Convention were familiar and had been advocated since 1851.  The leaders of the disunionists were the same who had led the unsuccessful movement of ten years before. The central figure was Rhett, who never for a moment had wavered. Consumed his life long by the one idea of the independence of South Carolina, that stern enthusiast pressed on to a triumphant conclusion.  The powers which had defeated him in 1851 were now either silent or converted, so that there was practically no opposition.  In a burst of passionate zeal the independence of South Carolina was proclaimed on December 20, 1860, by an ordinance of secession.\\n\\nSimultaneously, by one of those dramatic coincidences which make history stranger than fiction, Lincoln took a step which supplemented this action and established its tragic significance. What that step was will appear in a moment.\\n\\nEven before the secession began, various types of men in politics had begun to do each after his kind.  Those whom destiny drove first into a corner were the lovers of political evasion.  The issue was forced upon them by the instantaneous demand of the people of South Carolina for possession of forts in Charleston Harbor which were controlled by the Federal Government. Anticipating such a demand, Major Robert Anderson, the commandant at Charleston, had written to Buchanan on the 23d of November that \\\"Fort Sumter and Castle Pinckney must be garrisoned immediately, if the Government determines to keep command of this harbor.\\\"\\n\\nIn the mind of every American of the party of political evasion, there now began a sad, internal conflict.  Every one of them had to choose among three courses: to shut his eyes and to continue to wail that the function of government is to do nothing; to make an end of political evasion and to come out frankly in approval of the Southern position; or to break with his own record, to emerge from his evasions on the opposite side, and to confess himself first and before all a supporter of the Union.  One or another of these three courses, sooner or later, every man of the President's following chose.  We shall see presently the relative strength of the three groups into which that following broke and what strange courses sometimes tragic, sometimes comic--two of the three pursued.  For the moment our concern is how the division manifested itself among the heads of the party at Washington.\\n\\nThe President took the first of the three courses.  He held it with the nervous clutch of a weak nature until overmastered by two grim men who gradually hypnotized his will.  The turning-point for Buchanan, and the last poor crisis in his inglorious career, came on Sunday, December 30th.  Before that day arrived, his vacillation had moved his friends to pity and his enemies to scorn. One of his best friends wrote privately, \\\"The President is pale with fear\\\"; and the hostile point of view found expression in such comments as this, \\\"Buchanan, it is said, divides his time between praying and crying.  Such a perfect imbecile never held office before.\\\"\\n\\nWith the question what to do about the forts hanging over his bewildered soul, Buchanan sent a message to Congress on December 4, 1860, in which he sought to defend the traditional evasive policy of his party.  He denied the constitutional right of secession, but he was also denied his own right to oppose such a course.  Seward was not unfair to the mental caliber of the message when he wrote to his wife that Buchanan showed \\\"conclusively that it is the duty of the President to execute the laws--unless somebody opposes him; and that no State has a right to go out of the Union unless it wants to.\\\"\\n\\nThis message of Buchanan's hastened the inevitable separation of the Democratic party into its elements.  The ablest Southern member of the Cabinet, Cobb, resigned.  He was too strong an intellect to continue the policy of \\\"nothing doing\\\" now that the crisis had come.  He was too devoted a Southerner to come out of political evasion except on one side.  On the day Cobb resigned the South Carolina Representatives called on Buchanan and asked him not to make any change in the disposition of troops at Charleston, and particularly not to strengthen Sumter, a fortress on an island in the midst of the harbor, without at least giving notice to the state authorities.  What was said in this interview was not put in writing but was remembered afterward in different ways with unfortunate consequences.\\n\\nEvery action of Buchanan in this fateful month continued the disintegration of his following.  Just as Cobb had to choose between his reasonings as a Democratic party man and his feelings as a Southerner, so the aged Cass, his Secretary of State, and an old personal friend, now felt constrained to choose between his Democratic reasoning and his Northern sympathies, and resigned from the Cabinet on the 11th of December.  Buchanan then turned instinctively to the strongest natures that remained among his close associates.  It is a compliment to the innate force of Jeremiah S. Black, the Attorney-General, that Buchanan advanced him to the post of Secretary of State and allowed him to name as his successor in the Attorney-Generalship Edwin M. Stanton.  Both were tried Democrats of the old style, \\\"let-'em-alone\\\" sort; and both had supported the President in his Kansas policy.  But each, like every other member of his party, was being forced by circumstances to make his choice among the three inevitable courses, and each chose the Northern side.  At once the question of the moment was whether the new Secretary of State and his powerful henchmen would hypnotize the President.\\n\\nFor a couple of weeks the issue hung in the balance.  Then there appeared at Washington commissioners from South Carolina \\\"empowered to treat...for the delivery of forts...and other real estate\\\" held by the Federal Government within their State.  On the day following their arrival, Buchanan was informed by telegraph that Anderson had dismantled Fort Moultrie on the north side of the harbor, had spiked its guns, and had removed its garrison to the island fortress, Sumter, which was supposed to be far more defensible.  At Charleston his action was interpreted as preparation for war; and all South Carolinians saw in it a violation of a pledge which they believed the President had given their congressmen, three weeks previous, in that talk which had not been written down. Greatly excited and fearful of designs against them, the South Carolina commissioners held two conferences with the President on the 27th and 28th of December.  They believed that he had broken his word, and they told him so.  Deeply agitated and refusing to admit that he had committed himself at the earlier conference, he said that Anderson had acted on his own responsibility, but he refused to order him back to the now ruined Fort Moultrie.  One remark which he let fall has been remembered as evidence of his querulous state of mind: \\\"You are pressing me too importunately\\\" exclaimed the unhappy President; \\\"you don't give me time to consider; you don't give me time to say my prayers; I always say my prayers when required to act upon any great state affair.\\\"  One remembers Hampden \\\"seeking the Lord\\\" about ship money, and one realizes that the same act may have a vastly different significance in different temperaments.\\n\\nBuchanan, however, was virtually ready to give way to the demand of the commissioners.  He drew up a paper to that effect and showed it to the Cabinet.  Then the turning-point came.  In a painful interview, Black, long one of his most trusted friends, told him of his intention to resign, and that Stanton would go with him and probably also the Postmaster-General, Holt.  The idea of losing the support of these strong personalities terrified Buchanan, who immediately fell into a panic.  Handing Black the paper he had drawn up, Buchanan begged him to retain office and to alter the paper as he saw fit.  To this Black agreed.  The demand for the surrender of the forts was refused; Anderson was not ordered back to Moultrie; and for the brief remainder of Buchanan's administration Black acted as prime minister.\\n\\nA very powerful section of the Northern democracy, well typified by their leaders at Washington, had thus emerged from political evasion on the Northern side.  These men, known afterwards as War Democrats, combined with the Republicans to form the composite Union party which supported Lincoln.  It is significant that Stanton eventually reappeared in the Cabinet as Lincoln's Secretary of War, and that along with him appeared another War Democrat, Gideon Welles, Lincoln's Secretary of the Navy.  With them, at last, Douglas, the greatest of all the old Democrats of the North, took his position.  What became of the other factions of the old Democratic party remains to be told.\\n\\nWhile Buchanan, early in the month, was weeping over the pitilessness of fate, more practical Northerners were grappling with the question of what was to be done about the situation.  In their thoughts they anticipated a later statesman and realized that they were confronted by a condition and not by a theory. Secession was at last a reality.  Which course should they take?\\n\\nWhat strikes us most forcibly, as we look back upon that day, is the widespread desire for peace.  The abolitionists form a conspicuous example.  Their watchword was \\\"Let the erring sisters go in peace.\\\"  Wendell Phillips, their most gifted orator, a master of spoken style at once simple and melodious, declaimed splendidly against war.  Garrison, in \\\"The Liberator\\\", followed his example.  Whittier put the same feeling into his verse:\\n\\nThey break the links of Union; shall we light The flames of hell to weld anew the chain On that red anvil where each blow is pain?\\n\\nHorace Greeley said in an editorial in the \\\"New York Tribune\\\": \\\"If the cotton states shall decide that they can do better out of the Union than in it, we shall insist on letting them go in peace. Whenever a considerable section of our Union shall deliberately resolve to go out, we shall resist all coercive measures designed to keep them in.  We hope never to live in a republic where one section is pinned to the residue by bayonets.\\\"\\n\\nThe Democrats naturally clung to their traditions, and, even when they went over, as Black and Stanton did, to the Anti-Southern group, they still hoped that war would not be the result.  Equally earnest against war were most of the Republicans, though a few, to be sure, were ready to swing the \\\"Northern hammer.\\\"  Summer prophesied that slavery would \\\"go down in blood.\\\"  But the bulk of the Republicans were for a sectional compromise, and among them there was general approbation of a scheme which contemplated reviving the line of the Missouri Compromise, and thus frankly admitting the existence of two distinct sections, and guaranteeing to each the security of its own institutions.  The greatest Republican boss of that day, Thurlow Weed, came out in defense of this plan.\\n\\nNo power was arrayed more zealously on the side of peace of any kind than the power of money.  It was estimated that two hundred millions of dollars were owed by Southerners to Northerners.  War, it was reasoned, would cause the cancellation of these obligations. To save their Southern accounts, the moneyed interests of the North joined the extremists of Abolition in pleading to let the erring sisters go in peace, if necessary, rather than provoke them to war and the confiscation of debts.  It was the dread of such an outcome--which finally happened and ruined many Northern firms--that caused the stock-market in New York to go up and down with feverish uncertainty.  Banks suspended payment in Washington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia.  The one important and all-engrossing thing in the mind's eye of all the financial world at this moment was that specter of unpaid Southern accounts.\\n\\nAt this juncture, Senator Crittenden of Kentucky submitted to the Senate a plan which has been known ever since as the Crittenden Compromise.  It was similar to Weed's plan, but it also provided that the division of the country on the Missouri Compromise line should be established by a constitutional amendment, which would thus forever solidify sectionalism.  Those elements of the population generally called the conservative and the responsible were delighted.  Edward Everett wrote to Crittenden, \\\"I saw with great satisfaction your patriotic movement, and I wish from the bottom of my heart it might succeed\\\"; and August Belmont in a letter to Crittenden spoke for the moneyed interest: \\\"I have yet to meet the first Union-loving man, in or out of politics, who does not approve your compromise proposition....\\\"\\n\\nThe Senate submitted the Compromise to a Committee of Thirteen. In this committee the Southern leaders, Toombs and Davis, were both willing to accept the Compromise, if a majority of the Republican members would agree.  Indeed, if the Republicans would agree to it, there seemed no reason why a new understanding between the sections might not be reached, and no reason why sectionalism, if accepted as the basis of the government, might not solve the immediate problem and thus avert war.\\n\\nIn this crisis all eyes were turned to Seward, that conspicuous Republican who was generally looked upon as the real head of his party.  And Seward, at that very moment, was debating whether to accept Lincoln's offer of the Secretaryship of State, for he considered it vital to have an understanding with Lincoln on the subject of the Compromise.  He talked the matter over with Weed, and they decided that Weed should go to Springfield and come to terms with Lincoln.  It was the interview between Weed and Lincoln held, it seems, on the very day on which the Ordinance of Secession was adopted--which gave to that day its double significance.\\n\\nLincoln refused point-blank to accept the compromise and he put his refusal in writing.  The historic meaning of his refusal, and the significance of his determination not to solve the problem of the hour by accepting a dual system of government based on frankly sectional assumptions, were probably, in a measure, lost on both Weed and Seward.  They had, however, no misunderstanding of its practical effect.  This crude Western lawyer had certain ideas from which he would not budge, and the party would have to go along with him.  Weed and Seward therefore promptly fell into line, and Seward accepted the Secretaryship and came out in opposition to the Compromise.  Other Republicans with whom Lincoln had communicated by letter made known his views, and Greeley announced them in The Tribune.  The outcome was the solid alignment of all the Republicans in Congress against the Compromise.  As a result, this last attempt to reunite the sections came to nothing.\\n\\nNot more than once or twice, if ever, in American history, has there been such an anxious New Year's Day as that which ushered in 1861.  A few days before, a Republican Congressman had written to one of his constituents: \\\"The heavens are indeed black and an awful storm is gathering...I see no way that either North or South can escape its fury.\\\"  Events were indeed moving fast toward disaster.  The garrison at Sumter was in need of supplies, and in the first week of the new year Buchanan attempted to relieve its wants.  But a merchant vessel, the Star of the West, by which supplies were sent, was fired upon by the South Carolina authorities as it approached the harbor and was compelled to turn back.  This incident caused the withdrawal from the Cabinet of the last opposition members--Thompson, of Mississippi, the Secretary of the Interior, and Thomas, of Maryland, the Secretary of the Treasury.  In the course of the month five Southern States followed South Carolina out of the Union, and their Senators and Representatives resigned from the Congress of the United States.\\n\\n[ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/121](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/121)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637674645,\"title\":\"\\nThe split between Southern moderates and Southern radicals was further indicated by their differing attitudes\"},\"digest\":\"oAQ92UTQ0_IccTvq7shFvMklPrByc5FXGoUvTkg3M4w\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6961235d2e95818F7a1E230634bC24de80Bd6f6a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0XBrQGgXzgOuFXO-Wz1IiVMW8dBL3HvHO2sXtN095Ro\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Qh_uXNaVRCu9p_3sBMG02f5hEh94xcPcjqa-k4q5lnI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"32WdCZsWUkfmA4B0MYe5sL4UqZLtIRsws8PZ1WeU5aP9qcWhUBRgscNFlGf-BwTUuA5hdbouuniABjMqx9gnRw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xeda1441d9c5afd37d76d04cf9868e51a634320f24719096a67867716193b75a651877db3fba99b61a5b863b33a3863b7df7deedf62cecdab06bfa70fa03c22461b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0XBrQGgXzgOuFXO-Wz1IiVMW8dBL3HvHO2sXtN095Ro\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Qh_uXNaVRCu9p_3sBMG02f5hEh94xcPcjqa-k4q5lnI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"oAQ92UTQ0_IccTvq7shFvMklPrByc5FXGoUvTkg3M4w\"}"
