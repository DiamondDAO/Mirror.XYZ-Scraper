"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"> *At DeFiance Capital, we invest in DeFi eating traditional finance. It was a no-brainer when we came across MeanFi and the brilliant team — Michel & Eydel — who had the exact vision of working on the problems we saw in TradFi. Mean Protocol is seeing explosive growth on Solana and DeFiance is proud to back the team in their quest to bring in the next Billion users into crypto.*\\n\\n— Arthur Cheong, Founding Partner at DeFiance Capital\\n\\n> *MeanFi has been building relentlessly and we are impressed by their team and product. We are excited to support them in their efforts to build a DeFi banking infrastructure that can serve as the financial equalizer for users worldwide.*\\n\\n— Kyle Davies, Co-Founder of Three Arrows Capital\\n\\n# A Shared Mean Vision\\n\\nThe new capital will help our recently formed Mean DAO expand our Money Streaming operations and partnerships across Solana and onto a multi-chain future.\\n\\nFrom [the very beginning](https://meandao.medium.com/the-mean-protocol-and-meanfi-1fdf625b700e), we set out to build the bridge between TradFi and DeFi to onboard the next One Billion users onto crypto. As part of this journey, we have created the tools to make assets more liquid, capital-efficient, and composable.\\n\\nHaving the strategic support of the most influential investors across crypto with Three Arrows and DeFiance, as well as one of the largest funds across traditional finance through SoftBank’s SB Opportunity Fund, means we’ll be able to accelerate how quickly we realize this vision together, for the community and the entire ecosystem.\\n\\n# The Future of DeFi\\n\\nWe first launched Mean Protocol as a set of rules and interoperable smart contracts to help application developers facilitate everyday banking workflows on their protocols and web3 apps. Our Money Streaming and DCA programs power most of the value that moves through the Mean Protocol with an unmatched level of automation in DeFi.\\n\\nThings like receiving your salary as a Money Stream, which at the same time accumulates interest-yielding value you can access on every passing second, are now possible because of Mean Protocol.\\n\\nCompleting composable workflows like “***Take 20% of my salary money stream, pipe it to a lending protocol, borrow 50% of it in USDC, swap it to SOL, and stake 100% of it***” are also now possible in completely automated ways thanks to Mean Protocol Money Streams.\\n\\nAny project, company, or product can leverage these on-chain smart contracts to supercharge their app and protocol interoperability and build better, more liquid, and more capital-efficient financial infrastructure for their users.\\n\\nWe also launched MeanFi, a self-custody, permissionless, and trustless bank powered by the Mean Protocol, bringing Crypto and DeFi to everyday banking. It is both the starting gate for TradFi retail banking users and investors into DeFi, as well as a showcase of the things you can build with Mean Protocol for other developers.\\n\\n# Mean Growth\\n\\nBecause of these fantastic launches, we’ve grown a lot since we started this journey, and we now serve more than 31k individual accounts with 1.8k daily active users running thousands of transactions every single day. We are a super-engaged DAO community with 19k members and a fierce army of 29k Twitter followers. To say we have experienced meteoric growth is an understatement of what has happened thus far.\\n\\n> *The vision of MeanFi to onboard the next billion users into the crypto economy by making DeFi extraordinarily user-friendly and effortless is filling a huge gap in the ecosystem. The Mean Protocol powers a great deal of DeFi automation with money streams that will change the way developers build the web3 future. We are super proud to support this team.*\\n\\n— Patrick Wu, Partner at SkyVision Capital\\n\\nMean DAO is a global organization with users, DAO members, and partners distributed across the world on every single continent. We’re delighted that we have backers from Asia, Europe, Australia, Latin America, and the United States to take part in the organization. This diversity guarantees that every region has proper representation in the DAO’s governance voting, reputation, and merit systems, with voting power that’s diverse, knowledgeable, and aware of the latest developments in every corner of the world.\\n\\nWe are here to build the decentralized products and blockchain infrastructure necessary to serve as the financial equalizer for people and businesses worldwide. And to that extent, we are just getting started.\\n\\n# Get Involved\\n\\nOver the next few weeks and months, we plan to highlight several of our advisors and investors and share who they are and how our relationship came to be with our community. We’ll also get their perspective and ours about the tangible value they bring to the table to accelerate our mission.\",\"timestamp\":1638457630,\"title\":\"What is Mean DAO？\"},\"digest\":\"Cx-Q5mZ9uCdWlu4aE-q0h2rRMRgIPjUUMwy8IcpqZUQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3aEf315B67C2e23Aae9E9c1174D05371E2c9b144\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"r8ZB8q_8zMaLZVzuRd6iFjYiftCxcmTFBruyJrZ-skI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"t0OQ8D7C-0dyL8LaNs89tptXoN-GBjqFsTH4y8PP6Vk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"41nL9tAVkqqAHgmFzZhes4dBRK-IEJfIIpD4pwFDvIccqIBaP4KDRhRgBZSI0kJKwgw7v2A8SFT_U9d1pwVq-g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1bfd7a65cdee387c189084b64b0f131e8364bafc7a5e0ac18ffa913f8a3da6e83e6d9c8c0887db788f51b146a605e365fa238ea56730bf64e181db46dd2158b81b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"r8ZB8q_8zMaLZVzuRd6iFjYiftCxcmTFBruyJrZ-skI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"t0OQ8D7C-0dyL8LaNs89tptXoN-GBjqFsTH4y8PP6Vk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Cx-Q5mZ9uCdWlu4aE-q0h2rRMRgIPjUUMwy8IcpqZUQ\"}"
