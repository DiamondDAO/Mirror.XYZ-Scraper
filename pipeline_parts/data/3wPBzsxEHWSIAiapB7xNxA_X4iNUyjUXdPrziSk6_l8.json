"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"One of my greatest realisations in life is that every single thing that happens isn’t happening to us, it’s happening for us.\\n\\n Life is a story, a journey, a series of experiences, and an adventure, I would say. We don’t get to choose our scars and they don’t define us either. They’re a part of us but aren’t all that we are. \\n\\n> *”A mind that is stretched by experiences can never go back to its dimensions ”.*\\n\\n> *Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.*\\n\\nNo one alive or dead, famous or mundane, goes through life unscarred or untouched by its experience. Shelled within, we all have parts of us that frighten, parts that we run from, and parts that we jail because we are too scared to let the world see. We’re afraid of letting our guard down, so we put up walls, stacking them up so high, hoping no one sees what is underneath the armour. We are constantly ignoring its existence and everything around us nurtures our ego creating the illusion that we have to be perfect. We focus on the wondrous beauty of the flower, yet forget the rough journey of the stem and root. We forbid ourselves vulnerability, allowing ourselves to be crippled by our fears and restrain the flow of authentic connections with others.\\n\\n \\n\\nThere is purpose in pain, meaning in the mess, and beauty in your brokenness. You are art, a mosaic, an array of splintered pieces put together to create a picture. Your picture. A work of art so powerful, unique, and briefly wonderful. It’s these so called broken pieces that no longer poke at one’s sides, but forcefully demand that we breathe, reflect, and grow. In doing so, we can free ourselves from the craving to have control over the things we can’t change and embrace our scars as a series of beauty marks. Let people discover all the parts of you, the dark, and the light, there is a revolution inside of you.\\n\\nUnmask yourself, my love.\\n\\nMake peace with yourself.\\n\\nFree your heart, mind, soul, and spirit. Embrace your scars.\\n\\n \\n \\n\\nYou were made whole to feel the full extent of emotions. Don’t live to grasp mere survival, but fully immerse yourself in the experience of your existence.\\n\\n \\n\\nLove from my pen\\n\\nINK\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1635203783,\"title\":\"MOSAIC\"},\"digest\":\"ghnGxYYOKnDwOTtp2FvpYaGdpVN71Gk1ViCYF34GCE8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4B802419F5C5a02FaC98D8bBF011124A72b0e60A\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hGBJQZpRCh5PKj6CxoknGPJ8kW8658e-FwCSpvmAV5U\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0v-20gBV9bBeqgcb66BYkmgHGKw2326Hf0hV1NpTlDw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"h5YDpMOW0Mvd5bySnWeSQtFtxSWjVsKOg1FvM1F_6nvwFbxU8GHSQfbR-D3I438GCSpcIocDlEQxfOfjPL-Geg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd45ae89e021912ad858f85624ed35e45ac4ac9b5dddd6fe159292f9139811a9002d78e0ab6b6ed44b3ee2935115ac897ae7350ecb937de0bbed4db09c5f808d61c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hGBJQZpRCh5PKj6CxoknGPJ8kW8658e-FwCSpvmAV5U\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0v-20gBV9bBeqgcb66BYkmgHGKw2326Hf0hV1NpTlDw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ghnGxYYOKnDwOTtp2FvpYaGdpVN71Gk1ViCYF34GCE8\"}"
