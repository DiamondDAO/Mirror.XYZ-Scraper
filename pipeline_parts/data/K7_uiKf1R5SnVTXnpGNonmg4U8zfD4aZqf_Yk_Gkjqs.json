"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"was \\\"doomed to perish as an abominable idoll;\\\"\\nand how the cross on the steeple nearly (but not quite) knocked out\\nthe brains of the Puritan who removed it.  The Puritans had their\\nway with the registers as well as with the eagle (\\\"the vowl,\\\" as the\\nold country people call it), and laymen took the place of parsons as\\nregistrars in 1653.  The books from 1653 to 1660, while this regime\\nlasted, \\\"were kept exceptionally well,\\\" new brooms sweeping clean.\\nThe books of the period contain fewer of the old Puritan Christian\\nnames than we might have expected.  We find, \\\"REPENTE Kytchens,\\\" so\\nstyled before the poor little thing had anything but original sin to\\nrepent of.  \\\"FAINT NOT Kennard\\\" is also registered, and \\\"FREEGIFT\\nMabbe.\\\"\\n\\nA novelty was introduced into registers in 1678.  The law required\\n(for purposes of protecting trade) that all the dead should be\\nburied in woollen winding-sheets.  The price of the wool was the\\nobolus paid to the Charon of the Revenue.  After March 25, 1667, no\\nperson was to be \\\"buried in any shirt, shift, or sheet other that\\nshould be made of woole only.\\\"  Thus when the children in a little\\nOxfordshire village lately beheld a ghost, \\\"dressed in a long narrow\\ngown of woollen, with bandages round the head and chin,\\\" it is clear\\nthat the ghost was much more than a hundred years old, for the act\\n\\\"had fallen into disuse long before it was repealed in 1814.\\\"  But\\nthis has little to do with parish registers.  The addition made to\\nthe duties of the keeper of the register in 1678 was this--he had to\\ntake and record the affidavit of a kinsman of the dead, to the\\neffect that the corpse was actually buried in woollen fabric.  The\\nupper classes, however, preferred to bury in linen, and to pay the\\nfine of 5L.  When Mistress Oldfield, the famous actress, was\\ninterred in 1730, her body was arrayed \\\"in a very fine Brussels lace\\nheaddress, a holland shift with a tucker and double ruffles of the\\nsame lace, and a pair of new kid gloves.\\\"\\n\\nIn 1694 an empty exchequer was replenished by a tax on marriages,\\nbirths, and burials, the very extortion which had been feared by the\\ninsurgents in the Pilgrimage of Grace.  The tax collectors had\\naccess without payment of fee to the registers.  The registration of\\nbirths was discontinued when the Taxation Acts expired.  An attempt\\nto introduce the registration of births was made in 1753, but\\nunsuccessfully.  The public had the old superstitious dread of\\nanything like a census.  Moreover, the custom was denounced as\\n\\\"French,\\\" and therefore abominable.  In the same way it was thought\\ntelling to call the cloture \\\"the French gag\\\" during some recent\\ndiscussions of parliamentary rules.  In 1783 the parish register was\\nagain made the instrument of taxation, and threepence was charged on\\nevery entry.  Thus \\\"the clergyman was placed in the invidious light\\nof a tax collector, and as the poor were often unable or unwilling\\nto pay the tax, the clergy had a direct inducement to retain their\\ngood-will by keeping the registers defective.\\\"\\n\\nIt is easy to imagine the indignation in Scotland when \\\"bang went\\nsaxpence\\\" every time a poor man had twins!  Of course the Scotch\\nrose up against this unparalleled extortion.  At last, in 1812,\\n\\\"Rose's Act\\\" was passed.  It is styled \\\"an Act for the better\\nregulating and preserving registers of births,\\\" but the registration\\nof births is altogether omitted from its provisions.  By a stroke of\\nthe wildest wit the penalty of transportation for fourteen years,\\nfor making a false entry, \\\"is to be divided equally between the\\ninformer and the poor of the parish.\\\"  A more casual Act has rarely\\nbeen drafted.\\n\\nWithout entering into the modern history of parish registers, we may\\nborrow a few of the ancient curiosities to be found therein, the\\nblunders and the waggeries of forgotten priests, and curates, and\\nparish clerks.  In quite recent times (1832) it was thought worth\\nwhile to record that Charity Morrell at her wedding had signed her\\nname in the register with her right foot, and that the ring had been\\nplaced on the fourth toe of her left foot; for poor Charity was born\\nwithout arms.  Sometimes the time of a birth was recorded with much\\nminuteness, that the astrologers might draw a more accurate\\nhoroscope.  Unlucky children, with no acknowledged fathers, were\\nentered in a variety of odd ways.  In Lambeth (1685), George\\nSpeedwell is put down as \\\"a merry begot;\\\" Anne Twine is \\\"filia\\nuniuscujusque.\\\"  At Croydon, a certain William is \\\"terraefilius\\\"\\n(1582), an autochthonous infant.  Among the queer names of\\nfoundlings are \\\"Nameless,\\\" \\\"Godsend,\\\" \\\"Subpoena,\\\" and \\\"Moyses and\\nAaron, two children found,\\\" not in the bulrushes, but \\\"in the\\nstreet.\\\"\\n\\nThe rule was to give the foundling for surname the name of the\\nparish, and from the Temple Church came no fewer than one hundred\\nand four foundlings named \\\"Temple,\\\" between 1728 and 1755.  These\\nTemples are the plebeian gens of the patrician house which claims\\ndescent from Godiva.  The use of surnames as Christian names is\\nlater than the Reformation, and is the result of a reaction against\\nthe exclusive use of saints' names from the calendar.  Another\\nexample of the same reaction is the use of Old Testament names, and\\n\\\"Ananias and Sapphira were favourite names with the Presbyterians.\\\"\\nIt is only fair to add that these names are no longer popular with\\nPresbyterians, at any rate in the Kirk of Scotland.  The old Puritan\\nargument was that you would hardly select the name of too notorious\\na scriptural sinner, \\\"as bearing testimony to the triumph of grace\\nover original sin.\\\"  But in America a clergyman has been known to\\ndecline to christen a child \\\"Pontius Pilate,\\\" and no wonder.\\n\\nEntries of burials in ancient times often contained some\\nbiographical information about the deceased.  But nothing could\\npossibly be vaguer than this:  \\\"1615, February 28, St. Martin's,\\nLudgate, was buried an anatomy from the College of Physicians.\\\"\\nMan, woman, or child, sinner or saint, we know not, only that \\\"an\\nanatomy\\\" found Christian burial in St. Martin's, Ludgate.  How much\\nmore full and characteristic is this, from St. Peter's-in-the-East,\\nOxford (1568):  'There was buried Alyce, the wiff of a naughty\\nfellow whose name is Matthew Manne.'  There is immortality for\\nMatthew Manne, and there is, in short-hand, the tragedy of \\\"Alyce\\nhis wiff.\\\"  The reader of this record knows more of Matthew than in\\ntwo hundred years any one is likely to know of us who moralise over\\nMatthew!  At Kyloe, in Northumberland, the intellectual defects of\\nHenry Watson have, like the naughtiness of Manne, secured him a\\nmeasure of fame. (1696.)  \\\"Henry was so great a fooll, that he never\\ncould put on his own close, nor never went a quarter of a mile off\\nthe house,\\\" as Voltaire's Memnon resolved never to do, and as Pascal\\npartly recommends.\\n\\nWhat had Mary Woodfield done to deserve the alias which the Croydon\\nregister gives her of \\\"Queen of Hell\\\"? (1788.)  Distinguished people\\nwere buried in effigy, in all the different churches with which they\\nwere connected, and each sham burial service was entered in the\\nparish registers, a snare and stumbling-block to the historian.\\nThis curious custom is very ancient.  Thus we read in the Odyssey\\nthat when Menelaus heard in Egypt of the death of Agamemnon he\\nreared for him a cenotaph, and piled an empty barrow \\\"that the fame\\nof the dead man might never be quenched.\\\"  Probably this old usage\\ngave rise to the claims of several Greek cities to possess the tomb\\nof this or that ancient hero.  A heroic tomb, as of Cassandra for\\nexample, several towns had to show, but which was the true grave,\\nwhich were the cenotaphs?  Queen Elizabeth was buried in all the\\nLondon churches, and poor Cassandra had her barrow in Argos,\\nMycenae, and Amyclae.\\n\\n\\\"A drynkyng for the soul\\\" of the dead, a \\\\[Greek text\\\\] or funeral\\nfeast, was as common in England before the Reformation as in ancient\\nGreece.  James Cooke, of Sporle, in Norfolk (1528), left six\\nshillings and eightpence to pay for this \\\"drynkyng for his soul;\\\"\\nand the funeral feast, which long survived in the distribution of\\nwine, wafers, and rosemary, still endures as a slight collation of\\nwine and cake in Scotland.  What a funeral could be, as late as\\n1731, Mr. Chester Waters proves by the bill for the burial of Andrew\\nCard, senior bencher of Gray's Inn.  The deceased was brave in a\\n\\\"superfine pinked shroud\\\" (cheap at 1L. 5S. 6D.), and there were\\neight large plate candle-sticks on stands round the dais, and\\nninety-six buckram escutcheons.  The pall-bearers wore Alamode\\nhatbands covered with frizances, and so did the divines who were\\npresent at the melancholy but gorgeous function.  A hundred men in\\nmourning carried a hundred white wax branch lights, and the gloves\\nof the porters in Gray's Inn were ash-coloured with black points.\\nYet the wine cost no more than 1L. 19S. 6D.; a \\\"deal of sack,\\\" by no\\nmeans \\\"intolerable.\\\"\\n\\nLeaving the funerals, we find that the parish register sometimes\\nrecords ancient and obsolete modes of death.  Thus, martyrs are\\nscarce now, but the register of All Saints', Derby, 1556, mentions\\n\\\"a poor blinde woman called Joan Waste, of this parish, a martyr,\\nburned in Windmill pit.\\\"  She was condemned by Ralph Baynes, Bishop\\nof Coventry and Lichfield.  In 1558, at Richmond, in Yorkshire, we\\nfind \\\"Richard Snell, b'rnt, bur. 9 Sept.\\\"  At Croydon, in 1585,\\nRoger Shepherd probably never expected to be eaten by a lioness.\\nRoger was not, like Wyllyam Barker, \\\"a common drunkard and\\nblasphemer,\\\" and we cannot regard the Croydon lioness, like the\\nNemean lion, as a miraculous monster sent against the county of\\nSurrey for the sins of the people.  The lioness \\\"was brought into\\nthe town to be seen of such as would give money to see her.  He\\\"\\n(Roger) \\\"was sore wounded in sundry places, and was buried the 26th\\nAug.\\\"\\n\\nIn 1590, the register of St. Oswald's, Durham, informs us that\\n\\\"Duke, Hyll, Hogge, and Holiday\\\" were hanged and burned for \\\"there\\nhorrible offences.\\\"  The arm of one of these horrible offenders was\\npreserved at St. Omer as the relic of a martyr, \\\"a most precious\\ntreasure,\\\" in 1686.  But no one knew whether the arm belonged\\noriginally to Holiday, Hyll, Duke, or Hogge.  The coals, when these\\nunfortunate men were burned, cost sixpence; the other items in the\\naccount of the abominable execution are, perhaps, too repulsive to\\nbe quoted.\\n\\nAccording to some critics of the British government, we do not treat\\nthe Egyptians well.  But our conduct towards the Fellahs has\\ncertainly improved since this entry was made in the register of St.\\nNicholas, Durham (1592, August 8th):  'Simson, Arington,\\nFeatherston, Fenwick, and Lancaster, WERE HANGED FOR BEING\\nEGYPTIANS.'  They were, in fact, gypsies, or had been consorting\\nwith gypsies, and they suffered under 5 Eliz. c. 20.  In 1783 this\\nstatute was abolished, and was even considered \\\"a law of excessive\\nseverity.\\\"  For even a hundred years ago \\\"the puling cant of sickly\\nhumanitarianism\\\" was making itself heard to the injury of our sturdy\\nold English legislation.  To be killed by a poet is now an unusual\\nfate, but the St. Leonard's, Shoreditch, register (1598) mentions\\nhow \\\"Gabriel Spencer, being slayne, was buried.\\\"  Gabriel was\\n\\\"slayne\\\" by Rare Ben Jonson, in Hoxton Fields.\\n\\nThe burning of witches is, naturally, not an uncommon item in parish\\nregisters, and is set forth in a bold, business-like manner.  On\\nAugust 21 (1650) fifteen women and one man were executed for the\\nimaginary crime of witchcraft.  \\\"A grave, for a witch, sixpence,\\\" is\\nan item in the municipal accounts.  And the grave was a cheap haven\\nfor the poor woman who had been committed to the tender mercies of a\\nScotch witch-trier.  Cetewayo's medicine-men, who \\\"smelt out\\\"\\nwitches, were only some two centuries in the rear of our\\ncivilisation.  Three hundred years ago Bishop Jewell, preaching\\nbefore Elizabeth, was quite of the mind of Cetewayo and Saul, as to\\nthe wickedness of suffering a witch to live.  As late as 1691, the\\nregister of Holy Island, Northumberland, mentions \\\"William Cleugh,\\nbewitched to death,\\\" and the superstition is almost as powerful as\\never among the rural people.  Between July 13 and July 24 (1699) the\\nwidow Comon, in Essex, was thrice swum for a witch.  She was not\\ndrowned, but survived her immersion for only five months.  A\\nsingular homicide is recorded at Newington Butts, 1689.  \\\"John Arris\\nand Derwick Farlin in one grave, being both Dutch soldiers; one\\nkilled the other drinking brandy.\\\"  But who slew the slayer?  The\\nregister is silent; but \\\"often eating a shoulder of mutton or a peck\\nof hasty pudding at a time caused the death of James Parsons,\\\" at\\nTeddington, in Middlesex, 1743.  Parsons had resisted the effects of\\nshoulders of mutton and hasty pudding till the age of thirty-six.\\n\\nAnd so the registers run on.  Sometimes they tell of the death of a\\nglutton, sometimes of a GRACE WYFE (grosse femme).  Now the bell\\ntolls for the decease of a duke, now of a \\\"dog-whipper.\\\"\\n\\\"Lutenists\\\" and \\\"Saltpetremen\\\"--the skeleton of the old German\\nallegory whispers to each and twitches him by the sleeve.  \\\"Ellis\\nThompson, insipiens,\\\" leaves Chester-le-Street, where he had gabbled\\nand scrabbled on the doors, and follows \\\"William, foole to my Lady\\nJerningham,\\\" and \\\"Edward Errington, the Towne's Fooll\\\" (Newcastle-\\non-Tyne) down the way to dusty death.  Edward Errington died \\\"of the\\npest,\\\" and another idiot took his place and office, for Newcastle\\nhad her regular town fools before she acquired her singularly\\nadvanced modern representatives.  The \\\"aquavity man\\\" dies (in\\nCripplegate), and the \\\"dumb-man who was a fortune-teller\\\" (Stepney,\\n1628), and the \\\"King's Falkner,\\\" and Mr. Gregory Isham, who combined\\nthe professions, not frequently united, of \\\"attorney and\\nhusbandman,\\\" in Barwell, Leicestershire (1655).  \\\"The lame chimney-\\nsweeper,\\\" and the \\\"King of the gypsies,\\\" and Alexander Willis, \\\"qui\\ncalographiam docuit,\\\" the linguist, and the Tom o' Bedlam, the\\ncomfit-maker, and the panyer-man, and the tack-maker, and the\\nsuicide, they all found death; or, if they sought him, the\\nchurchyard where they were \\\"hurled into a grave\\\" was interdicted,\\nand purified, after a fortnight, with \\\"frankincense and sweet\\nperfumes, and herbs.\\\"\\n\\nSometimes people died wholesale of pestilence, and the Longborough\\nregister mentions a fresh way of death, \\\"the swat called New\\nAcquaintance, alias Stoupe Knave, and know thy master.\\\"  Another\\nmalady was 'the posting swet, that posted from towne to towne\\nthrough England.'  The plague of 1591 was imported in bales of cloth\\nfrom the Levant, just as British commerce still patriotically tries\\nto introduce cholera in cargoes of Egyptian rags.  The register of\\nMalpas, in Cheshire (Aug. 24, 1625), has this strange story of the\\nplague:-\",\"timestamp\":1641284419,\"title\":\"\\nThe register of Maid's Moreton, Bucks, tells how the reading-desk \"},\"digest\":\"rjEY3cjRxkZklyzxYVAO3K_mpm9HuafPb0v7ERqw8SA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x12DAB7FFceEebeDFF34FE12b77b7a16997723371\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hPkjaTFch79YiXhH-XEjENtk-CwUUfgNgpYRgaknt5g\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FdjQueOq22qDSOBxALAMNKJFce-EV7DoH3HVyPOJ93Q\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"CsFVOd1_yLwMjYDHy3VVwTB7WcUEtHNR3jf1JUKy1WIIQ0jjaRQSd1bbI54B-CJP6aVY6w3JxfcfyONuwdEaFw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8c0f99254bc1c7bb98d5c83ab4d91037eae1ad6751c225c389572af88e0f050c500a754e5e7414648068584ccb728093cad801e73ef6e9f7d75cb78cd20e2ecc1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hPkjaTFch79YiXhH-XEjENtk-CwUUfgNgpYRgaknt5g\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FdjQueOq22qDSOBxALAMNKJFce-EV7DoH3HVyPOJ93Q\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rjEY3cjRxkZklyzxYVAO3K_mpm9HuafPb0v7ERqw8SA\"}"
