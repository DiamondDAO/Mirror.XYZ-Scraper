"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"During Apple’s October 2021 event, the company debuted its new [third-generation AirPods](https://www.ign.com/articles/apple-airpods-gen-3-up-for-preorder). These effectively replaced the mid-level “AirPods with wireless charging” model that was previously available. One detail that got less attention was that Apple also updated its premium wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro. And that new model, despite that it just came out, can already be gotten [on sale for $60 off](https://zdcs.link/X7GWx?_ga=668900025.1635905462). Not bad.\\n\\n## AirPods Pro (2021 Model)\\n\\nMAGSAFE CHARGING CASE\\n\\nNew Apple AirPods Pro\\n\\n24% off US$249.00\\n\\n0\\n\\nUS$189.99\\n\\n[See on Amazon](https://zdcs.link/X7GWx?_ga=668900025.1635905462)\\n\\nApple MagSafe Charger\\n\\n13% off US$39.00\\n\\n0\\n\\nUS$34.00\\n\\n[See on Amazon](https://zdcs.link/bl0Me?_ga=668900025.1635905462)\\n\\nNow, the reason the new AirPods Pro didn’t get a ton of press is because it’s a pretty minor upgrade, as these things go. The new AirPods Pro themselves remain unchanged. What got tweaked is the case they come in. The case now supports MagSafe charging.\\n\\nAirPods Pro have always supported wireless charging, but these incorporate Apple’s MagSafe technology. That means when you set them on a MagSafe charger, they stick to it and stay in place magnetically. This makes it easy to know when they’re in place to receive a wireless charge, and it makes them less likely to be bumped off the charger. You do need Apple’s MagSafe charger to take advantage of this new feature, however ([see it at Amazon](https://zdcs.link/bl0Me?_ga=668900025.1635905462)).\\n\\nAside from that, these are the same as the model they’re replacing. They’re still excellent wireless earbuds, though. They still have active noise canceling with a pass-through mode. They come with replaceable rubber tips you can swap out to find the right size for your ears. They also have touch controls built into their stems, and they pair seamlessly with your Apple products like iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\\n\\n[close dialog](javascript:void(0))\\n\\nLET US DO THE WORK FOR YOU.\\n\\nGet Daily Deals delivered directly to your inbox\\n\\nevery morning\\n\\nSign Me Up\\n\\nNo, thanks\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n*Chris Reed is a deals expert and commerce editor for IGN.
