Sometimes all a project needs is moral support. While some tasks require specific skills such as design, management or programming, others are very open such as voting, assistance answering questions in our groups, helping out at events, or small tasks like giving your feedback on a document.\\n\\n## Initiation\\n\\n**Join** - **[Mundo Lingo Collaborators](https://t.me/+eKPDf_8pUUAzNWQ0)** and follow the steps below.\\n\\n## ðŸ‘‹ Introduce yourself\\n\\nThis is a **must**. Be noticed - Light up the sky ðŸŒŸ, donâ€™t let anyone not-notice you arrived âœ¨\\n\\n* Hash tag your skills (if any)- EG.\\\\* `#bizdev, #CSS, #illustration, #callhosting`\\n* Who are you?\\n* What are your passions, hobbies, interests?\\n* How did you get here?\\n* Why are you here?\\n* What are you interested in?\\n* Who are you interested in connecting with?\\n* What skills -if any- can you offer to other members?\\n\\n### Pro-Tips\\n\\n* Itâ€™s okay to observe the group, but try to make an intro within 5 days.\\n* Use a nice photo and a real name to get a warmer reception.\\n* Respond to other peopleâ€™s intros! ðŸ‘‹\\n\\n## Attend a Scrum\\n\\nBefore getting into residency, why not join us on a general call? Youâ€™re not obligated to speak, you can just watch.\\n\\n## Know the Types of Collaborators\\n\\n### Freshers and Lurkers\\n\\n**Freshers** are new kids on the block. **Lurkers** hang out not saying much and generally observing the group. Both are fine, try to participate however you can, vote and offer useful perspective occasionally when you can.\\n\\n### Residents\\n\\nResidents have been accepted into a **remote or IRL team**. Volunteer from time to time to help with crowd-tasking. For example, group admins, Ambassadors, or to help verify some venues. When you volunteer youâ€™ll be given a task that may take anything from 10 minutes to a couple of hours depending on various factors. These tasks may be random, or they can involve your special skill set.\\n\\n### Leads\\n\\nFor Crowd-Tasking projects we have small specialised working groups. Each is headed by a **Lead** with a strong grasp of the tasks at hand.\\n\\n## Apply for Residency\\n\\nApply for residency (if you want to) according to your area of interest using the links below\\n\\n**Remote Teams**\\n\\n* **[Online Assembly](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/YHiCb5_XaYGdpbRypQWQkl09ptcQ-gQ4z3xVB_ChbDc)** - (Online Admins)\\n* **[The Dark Room](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/mMsMcopOXI0bNouEsFfzIW335FmcSaBZGPtNoeFuTJg)** - (Photographers)\\n* **Q-Branch** (Web Dev and Crypto)\\n* **Lingo Studio** - (Design and Illustration)\\n* **The News Room** - (Social Media)\\n* **Venue Investigation Bureau** - (Finding / verifying venues)\\n\\n**IRL Teams**\\n\\n* **[The Incubator](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/u9k391Q69s4h51bqyDa5GDeG7HurDVXaOuhFcHcb-Jc)** (Manager Academy)\\n* **[Embassies](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/GUZj246f3hBt927EWv_XtirgExr-3Xm97nI8nak8BY0)** (Local City Teams)\\n\\nMore on IRL Teams:\\n\\n### Managers\\n\\nThis is a high level of commitment role.
