"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Web 1 2 3\\n\\nWeb 1.0 was built on users consuming content. Web 2.0 saw massive value creation by opening up content production to individual internet users. This era is where we are now, as we see centralized entities (google, fb, apple) own the content that users are writing and reading. As Web 3.0 is in a period of experimentation and searching for market fit for its initial Decentralized Applications (dApps), we will see another era of immense value creation as users now OWN the data that they are writing and reading.\\n\\nDecentralizing content creation = value creation \\n Decentralizing ownership = value creation\\n\\nWeb3. The Web3 vision is about empowering consumers to control their own data, as opposed to the status quo in which tech giants, credit bureaus, advertisers, healthcare providers, etc. hoard consumer data. As this paradigm shifts, incumbents will lose their primary competitive advantage—their data monopolies and associated network effects—creating massive opportunities for new value creation.\\n\\n**Mainfraimes→PCs→Smartphones→Blockchain**\\n\\nAt each of these transitions we see something that is new but not as effective of current solutions. However, at each step there is a feature that is new or powerful enough to drive adoption over time. With Blockchain its trustlessness and decentralization, which is baked directly into the technology. True ownership is expressed on the blockchain because it is permissionless and infinitely programable, just as the web1.0 was (prior to big tech owning the infrastructure, the user data, the content, and the advertising)\\n\\n## Decentralization\\n\\nUnbundling data ownership and application logic.  The paradigmatic shift in Web3 is the unbundling of data and application logic. By unbundling what was previously bundled, data owners won’t need to trust application providers with their data. Cryptonetworks combine the best features of the first two internet eras: community-governed, decentralized networks with capabilities that will eventually exceed those of the most advanced centralized services.\\n\\n## Blockchain Stats\\n\\nThe global blockchain market should reach $56.7 billion by 2026 from $6.0 billion in 2021 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 56.9% for the forecast period of 2021 to 2026.

This explains why a whopping 62% of all blockchain storage makes provisions for mobile blockchain wallets.\\n\\nTx/Sec: SOL is at 50k/second, Bitcoin is at 4.6/sec, Ethereum is at 13/Sec. , Visa is at 1,700/sec, Polygon is at 65k/sec \\n \\n\\n## Governance/DAOs\\n\\nInformed communities are driving product initiatives and product innovation, a bottom up development as opposed to a top down.\\n\\nDiscord\\n\\nmAnual\\n\\nOrg\\n\\nVS\\n\\nDecentralized\\n\\nAutonomous\\n\\nOrganization\\n\\n[https://www.daomasters.xyz/](https://www.daomasters.xyz/)\\n\\nCryptonetworks use multiple mechanisms to ensure that they stay neutral as they grow, preventing the bait-and-switch of centralized platforms. First, the contract between cryptonetworks and their participants is enforced in open source code. Second, they are kept in check through mechanisms for [“voice” and “exit.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty) Participants are given voice through community governance, both “on chain” (via the protocol) and “off chain” (via the social structures around the protocol). Participants can exit either by leaving the network and selling their coins, or in the extreme case by forking the protocol.\\n\\nConsider the problem of network governance. Today, unaccountable groups of employees at large platforms decide how information gets ranked and filtered, which users get promoted and which get banned, and other important governance decisions. In cryptonetworks, these decisions are made by the community, using open and transparent mechanisms. As we know from the offline world, democratic systems aren’t perfect, but they are a lot better than the alternatives.\\n\\n## Composability / Interoperability\\n\\nAbility for information and value to be easily transmuted across different chains. As the vibrant community of dApps, layer 1s, layer 2s and use cases develop, there will be an increasing need for users to interact across dApps and chains. This need will inspire the push towards true interoperability and composability.\\n\\n[Composability](https://future.a16z.com/how-composability-unlocks-crypto-and-everything-else/) is **a system design principle that deals with the inter-relationships of components**. A highly composable system provides components that can be selected and assembled in various combinations to satisfy specific user requirements\\n\\n[Interoperability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability) refers to **the basic ability of different computerized products or systems to readily connect and exchange information with one another**, in either implementation or access, without restriction\\n\\nSources: [Multicoin Capital](https://multicoin.capital/2019/04/24/multicoin-investment-thesis/) & [A16Z](https://onezero.medium.com/why-decentralization-matters-5e3f79f7638e) & [The Block](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/1534/weaknesses-in-the-web-3-0-thesis) & [Ben Horrowitz](https://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1039272689381199874) & [AVC ](https://avc.com/2015/02/the-carlota-perez-framework/)& [Techjury](https://techjury.net/blog/blockchain-statistics/#gref) & [Web3 primer](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aIjYKKM64Eyp497-j6wkDjCsHBA3CbbWg25UQ9Why3g/mobilepresent?slide=id.p) & [TCIP and Blockchain](https://blockchain.works-hub.com/learn/Drawing-Parralels-between-TCP-IP-and-the-Blockchain)\",\"timestamp\":1637035108,\"title\":\"web3esis\"},\"digest\":\"zh5vSp1de5dSUqaJ9OZB3cKywibLzsyE-kVIbKGqTr4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x78320e6082f9E831DD3057272F553e143dFe5b9c\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qt7kQji0b5m6I1gtqXPqbyHjKKfP50u-n-oat-yhpcg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3U2UKoaNwrRDv4c3CUO7Xzpkxjk1Dg1l6VvQsVEar0w\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"yV0k88e7Z31kkk4MGgUJgqYxkppeY0UIwPWEIzxDCIRKDcUNZ2Nh_LIpgN3E1PQjNX989Nb_4a5XwzZPvsp40Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x26f7213a895b4f47db0040dde528a2c12ca18bbae8fbb6a187ff56390d25723f0d8b7bb97b306b4b55b786a1e6139b20f7d67986f391788c4ad8910e67eb74801b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qt7kQji0b5m6I1gtqXPqbyHjKKfP50u-n-oat-yhpcg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3U2UKoaNwrRDv4c3CUO7Xzpkxjk1Dg1l6VvQsVEar0w\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"zh5vSp1de5dSUqaJ9OZB3cKywibLzsyE-kVIbKGqTr4\"}"
