"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\n---\\n\\n**Without Apple, no Bank: Privacy as a tying sale**\\n\\nThere’s a kind of tying sale happening between user terms. And such a link might not be bad. What is bad, is that it not on the frontpage. You, me, the government, essential services, we do not notice. And, unironically, it is Meta’s Whatsapp that shows us the way. So what are we waiting for?\\n\\n**90% of a large number is a large number**\\n\\nElon Musk had taken it’s side, calling Apple out with it’s ‘de facto global tax on the internet’. Yes we are reminiscing about Apple v Epic. The lawsuit about the App Store, about the control over the app store. Which has it’s ups (reason #1 mentioned: ‘no’ malware) and it’s downs.\\n\\nA downside for Epic which had to pay a 30% fee on all it’s Fortnite transactions\\n\\n**No Apple No Bank**\\n\\nSuch control it not only relevant for Epic. In this time of on-line and mobile firsts, having your app is vital. It is becoming the only way of servicing your customer. Whether you are a gaming giant, or a financial services player. And then the narratives changes. Without adhering to Apple’s control, no bank, no insurer.\\n\\nMake no mistake, Epic vs Apple, is for every service player relevant\\n\\n**Privacy as a tying sale**\\n\\nIn this ever increasing climate of online / mobile first, a second effect of that control comes to the surface. To be a customer of that mobile first bank, you not only have to agree to the Bank’s condition, but also to Apple’s user terms. And here we have the start of a tying sale of privacy for an essential good\\n\\n**Which is a problem for essentials goods**\\n\\nSuch a tie in might not be so cumbersome for Fortnite, for that new Ikea AR app. One could go without. But it is different for essential financial services. Many countries have limitations on how a credit card can be tied to a consumable good (the credit card should be separately offered as well). So how should that app be downloaded without Apple or Google?\\n\\n**Let’s learn from Covid: tracing apps**\\n\\nA side effect of COVID is the collaboration of Apple and Google creating an COVID Bluetooth tracking API for use in COVID tracing apps. Kudos. Governments facilitated the creation of country based tracing apps, using this API. Which mitigated the concern of sceptics regarding: tracking where you went. But less we forget that the App itself was tied in to Apple’s and Google’s terms... So you still need to hand over your personal details.\\n\\n**So how should we prevent Privacy as a tying sale**\\n\\nGoogle itself shows us the way. In an effort what could be classified as more strict control on it’s plaly store, it’s taking over the signing of the app from the developer. But there is a major asterix on this one: it is offering the same functionality for ‘white label’ stores.\\n\\n**Who should use it**\\n\\nNow things should changes. This should not be limited to the Fdroid’s and Huawei’s of this world. To prevent privacy as a tie in sale, every app for services deemed fundamental in one’s life need to be offered in such a neutral store. For your new digital government log-in app, there should be a choise for usage with only 1 terms and conditions. And don’t forget your decentralized crypto wallet.\",\"timestamp\":1637793162,\"title\":\"No Apple, no Bank: Privacy as a tying sale\"},\"digest\":\"UAJYGZ9ejcYqK5cT-DlELG8iwsVKdIoNzjDAbuUFc9U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x27f2d517E911467C211421F62BCCc6EA91f2f260\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0yyhTAwgW4HlbXsOs0ku6VH8td0gpVwrR11zPle_lZQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NMM5x6SDf094u7ObURMhatgKYmSVDU09cNYTyN1pqr0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"p3o6MpcSxCC4RAWzwIlD9KkqZdrVlxVMSNnt2BaJ_ABavNMZsck8_DnnP_lHOhpKBL1V1l2nrtezZzO2V0Zj8Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x6194d4b22022322d99eb3b4cf4e7ccc8ade922ffe8b7f728e846d57f78a317f54481879b17102ca7b15259932fb832fa6badfa49b0cecc7c9973e0ae0011d7861c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0yyhTAwgW4HlbXsOs0ku6VH8td0gpVwrR11zPle_lZQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NMM5x6SDf094u7ObURMhatgKYmSVDU09cNYTyN1pqr0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"l8NiM2sNwqo1trZ2yiCavQFFF33khH6pepjeNlJGifo\"}"
