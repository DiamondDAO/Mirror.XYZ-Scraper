And since it covers different areas and has a wide audience base. Investors will want to learn about the basic concept and methodology of Richmond at least once. This is totally fine as proper research is essential before investing.\\n\\nRICHMINT DAO consists of various technical terms, methods, and processes that we need to know before understanding the working process. Thus let’s clear everything one by one.\\n\\n# ESG Compliance\\n\\nEnvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) compliance has become an increasingly complex and challenging regulatory environment for companies to navigate. With their focus on sustainability reporting and ESG metrics, approximately 25% of companies have shown significant improvement in their ESG performance.\\n\\nOne recent report said that applying the relevant materiality to these businesses reveals better scores on ESG metrics around emissions, renewable energy, the push toward diversity and inclusion, and key governance issues such as independence of audit committees and better board functioning.\\n\\n# Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)\\n\\nRichmint is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), and the meaning of DAO here is that it is an entity with no central leadership. Decisions are made from the bottom up, governed by a community organized around a specific set of rules that apply to the blockchain.\\n\\nDAOs are Internet-based organizations owned and managed by their members. They have built-in treasuries which can be accessed only after due approval of their members. Decisions will also be made through the resolutions on which the group votes during a certain period of time.\\n\\n# NFT Marketplace\\n\\nNFT Marketplace allows NFT trading in multiple virtual environments and marketplaces. It enables token holders to take advantage of sophisticated bidding, trading capabilities, collecting, and selling in the global market.\\n\\nNFT Marketplace will be a huge part of the RICHMINT DAO Project because it is for all ESG based businesses, and not only for the energy sector. Everything will be properly organized in the marketplace according to the sectors like pharma, health care, agriculture commodities, EV charging, etc. It will be like an eCommerce platform but built upon futuristic technologies, advanced features, and more payment options.\\n\\nNow let’s get back to the main topic which is the Working of RICHMINT DAO.\\n\\n# Working of RICHMINT DAO\\n\\nRICHMINT DAO is a revolutionary blockchain-based DAO platform that is building NFT marketplaces to help ESC compliant companies from various sectors, like pharma, health care, EV charging, construction, and agriculture, to achieve carbon neutrality.\\n\\nThe project will bring RE buyers and RE sellers from almost every field together in the marketplace to make RE trading secure and hassle-free. Thus, ESC compliant businesses can buy renewable energy and energy setup from the RE sellers easily. Which will help these businesses to reduce their carbon footprint and maintain good ESG scores and also help RE sellers with more business opportunities. \\n  \\n The project is not limited to trading, it will also ease the process of how the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) is executed between the parties. Each PPA in the ecosystem will be developed as an NFT, which will provide better liquidity and all these NFTs can be collateralized by adding a new DeFi layer for ESG projects.\\n\\nRichmint DAO also has a robust exchange, dual token system, and Richmint smart contracts presenting every green energy user with a more consumer-friendly ecosystem.
