Let me first explain a little about the mental model, then let’s go to the reasons why designers do not use the user mental model.\\n\\n> *“A mental model is an explanation of the way one thinks about how something works in the real world; It is a representation of the world around us, the relationships between its various parts, and one’s intuitive understanding of one’s actions and their consequences.” Wikipedia*\\n\\n![Mental model](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mK97XOOIdx8vGHxb7uqWM.jpeg?height=396&width=700)\\n\\nIn this definition, two points were identified:\\n\\n* Everyone’s mental model is related to himself. People have unique mental models that are generally shaped by education, experience, age, and culture.\\n* The mental model is the intuitive understanding of one’s actions. The model is not fixed and is based on belief, not reality. Users know about the system or think they know what to do, so they base their future actions on their predictions about the system.\\n\\n> *And Jacob Nelson says:\\n> Users spend most of their time on websites other than their own, so much of the mental models of users on your site will be influenced by information gathered from other sites.*\\n\\nWe became acquainted with the mental model and its weaknesses; Now let’s read the reasons I came up with:\\n\\n* The first and most important reason is that the mental model is not fixed and changes over time. You build a persona at the beginning of the project and continue with the same persona, but after a while, it must be reviewed and corrected if necessary.\\n* Even the user’s mental model is not in line with the company’s goals. Now a bomb explodes in your brain, how can that be? Innovation is formed right here! Designs products that are not based on the user’s mental model and the product is suitable to encourage people to change their mental model, but this method should be used when the new method is completely superior to the old method, and obviously with the new method The company succeeds.\\n* One of the big problems is the gap between the user’s mental model and the designer, designers know too much that they have amazing mental models and it has led them to believe that every feature is easy to understand. On the other hand, there is a lot of inertia in the mental models of users, which means that things that people know well are easier and better, but tend to cling to the previous solution. This alone may be unintentional for being conservative and not creating new styles of interaction. Resistance occurs a lot in the user’s mental model, users like to cling to the solution they are already advancing.\\n\\n  ## What is the solution to this problem?\\n\\n  One of the best ways to coordinate the mental model between the user and the designer is to **[Thinking Aloud Testing](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/thinking-aloud-the-1-usability-tool/#:\\\\~:text=Definition%3A%20In%20a%20thinking%20aloud,keep%20up%20a%20running%20monologue.)** and hard about testing the target user. When the user thinking aloud, he also expresses his beliefs and insights. Of course, there are more advanced methods, but for most design teams, a few sessions of thinking aloud are enough.\\n\\n  If the system cannot be changed or you are introducing a new interaction that you know the user may need to learn, include instructions, tutorials, and demos when starting the user interface. Of course, the theory that if a product needs guidance is doomed to failure can be ignored here.\\n\\n  If you change the way an existing product works, you can slow down the changes over time or warn them of future changes and let them decide when to switch, such as when a program is updated and the user is asked. Whether he wants to update or not.\\n\\n![Update Available popup](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YHoxqY1dVPHqkx1Y-Efyl.png?height=470&width=700)\\n\\nThe next solution is **[Skeuomorphism](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/skeuomorphism#:\\\\~:text=Skeuomorphism%20is%20a%20term%20most,user%20can%20interact%20with%20them.&text=Skeuomorphism%20represents%20affordances%20in%20digital%20user%20interfaces.)**, which means designing objects as they are in the real world, such as sound settings on a laptop that look like a real volume control device, or the famous example of a digital calculator button.\\n\\n![Sound settings on a laptop that resembles a real-world volume control device.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/riswxDt21kJ6juhB40lVG.jpeg?height=374&width=700)\\n\\nThe last reason why designers do not design based on the user’s mental model may be that they did not design enough personas for the product. When a product enters the market in MVP mode, many people will use it, which may not be considered as a target audience, which can be solved by testing and expanding.\\n\\nThank you for reading this article, leave me a comment and follow me on other social networks through **[this link](http://redl.ink/shimah.design).**\",\"timestamp\":1634290797,\"title\":\"Why don’t designers design based on the user’s mental model?\\n\"},\"digest\":\"sB4c7kqAjV2eOYvguqO_4f-XWYDYfbxcwHrtd-tWjtU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x037C6926568f61f4f1d90681aF477E66595CDd35\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"j4RFSPpODvEvKvWhSnmhsEefESkoeynJUoeGNm_Ob7Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4TQQ4jujhDDtARgd1ZIUIxpe--1RihuVrAnfHKZ5t4E\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"En7DdzJ1ZqnBm-_xhirVNUO1pABYriPYMp-hXyVOViOvHKCOdF8LU6_SYfZCIekgYJ-jWZ0MAv0paGfzeTjuKg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2f067aa7aaa6cc6a073da3b7b9b629baecd3d1ea412a66ecd1a8db8a422efdd11ef144b3078e4f2c3d69a38e76362b83270fe61d03b86ccb768e5d06b49e1e851b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"j4RFSPpODvEvKvWhSnmhsEefESkoeynJUoeGNm_Ob7Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4TQQ4jujhDDtARgd1ZIUIxpe--1RihuVrAnfHKZ5t4E\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"MI7pTTs4KWUok_quC8RgiZ3wJkwS2UwDRB3L7_aSbg8\"}"
