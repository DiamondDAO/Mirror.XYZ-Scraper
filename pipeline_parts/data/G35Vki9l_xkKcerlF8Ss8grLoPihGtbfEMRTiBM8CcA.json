Here’s what you need to know to stop worrying about gas and to start clearing 4 figs every time you mint and flip. `jk` I’m new too, but here’s what I’ve learned in 6 weeks of absolutely nailing it. `jk` I’ve made a profit (incl. gas fees) so I feel it’s a good start. `jk` haha no I have. Bought this bad boi for free and flipped it for 0.2ETH the next day.\\n\\nBuying **into**\\n\\nThere are five key areas to consider\\n\\n1. Create a fund\\n2. Source deals\\n3. Due diligence\\n4. Close the deal\\n5. Grow or sell\\n\\n## 0️⃣ Make sure you’re ready\\n\\n### Do you have background?\\n\\n* [MetaMask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfkqgXNPiHg&ab_channel=CoinBureau)\\n* [A beginner’s guide to NFTs](https://linda.mirror.xyz/df649d61efb92c910464a4e74ae213c4cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d) (by Linda Xia)\\n* Go read Zeneca_33, he’ll put you on the right path ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/Zeneca_33?s=20), [Substack](https://zeneca33.substack.com/))\\n\\n### Do you believe in the space?\\n\\nWhy NFTs are an interesting application of the blockchain, because:\\n\\n1. Creators (e.g. Emma) can rapidly get their art on a marketplace\\n2. Creators maintain control over the terms of sale without needing support in drafting contracts\\n3. Creators end up building a universal library of media, which —let’s call them technical creators— can build on top of e.g. a new Pinterest of all NFT art\\n\\n**Other interesting notes**\\n\\n* NFTs as property\\n  * Art for instance is great now but the collectibles are doing better. This will change as the digital world, in which the property can be displayed, grows.\\n* NFTs as golden ticket\\n  * NFTs and other tokens can be your entry to the community and can be traded for or rewarded with other real world value. Look at RAC.\\n  * Or vice versa. Enter the community to get tokens which enable you to buy the NFT when it *drops*.\\n* NFTs as gold Rolex\\n  * Your public key (identity) will always show against these items. Even having owned something is a licence to brag.\\n\\n## 1️⃣ Create a fund\\n\\nBefore you start you have to decide how much you want to invest.

You bleed: Gas will get you, even buying and transferring is expensive if you’re not prepared\\n3. Gas wars\\n4. Budget: you’d probably make the most buying blue chips but you can’t but don’t just let your fund deplete itself by jumping on a bunch of small projects, pick some big ‘uns and try grinding for real\\n\\n## 2️⃣ Source deals\\n\\n1. Start: find project, end: get to Discord\\n2. Twitter\\n   1. Great for joining early enough to get an OG role\\n   2.
