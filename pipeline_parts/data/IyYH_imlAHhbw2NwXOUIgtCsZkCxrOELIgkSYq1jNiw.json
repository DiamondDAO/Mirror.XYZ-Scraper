"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*From text to textiles, from stores to stories— every week we take a confidential behind the scenes look chronicling diverse experiences and accounts of some of the most pivotal, impactful and transformative narratives that make up the real fabric of fashion.*\\n\\n*These entries are included as material in web3 fashion manifesto and also open sourced under CC0 to the Meta Source Vaults.*\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Pressure. \\n\\n### Pushing down on me. Pressing down on me. \\n\\nProspecting drilling between the liquidity and lack of substance for some life giving thing— liquid gold, fresh water, magical capacity…\\n\\nKeep digging. Keep digging. \\n\\nThere’s a gold mine in the middle of the desert and you need to defend it. Start mining and processing the gold that you’ve found as fast as possible to create the defenses needed. \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8axle2Ykp3k4lfWdIJdOU.png?height=1280&width=960)\\n\\nJust keep working at the material at every pass. \\n\\nRun it through every transformation set possible, continuous multi-dimensional passes. An FFT?  \\n\\nIt’s somewhat uncanny. \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EV1pErdMy9nY9kG5dWLV9.png?height=1280&width=960)\\n\\nI don’t know yet, exactly. \\n\\nThe impact and quality is not carried by the words but rather by the infused drive, emotions and passions imbued into it. \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/P_JSX15AN1pK5ESkd9pD4.png?height=960&width=1280)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mPv8G81Vy_Et9B9OjCeV3.png?height=960&width=1280)\\n\\nThese days, I know it well. \\n\\nAnd these simps keep coming back. \\n\\nCould you really face up to a true and open free market with fierce competition?\\n\\n### High Yield Arbitrage. \\n\\n*If the secondary speculators remembered as merchants what kind of primary wealth they are best familiar with to create, they could use that skillful resource as a form of leverage with those that prefer to have closed markets, because those that sit on whatever commodities they were lucky enough to lock down always have a need to have access to all of the other commodities they didn’t frontrun so lucky.*\\n\\n### You make me bitter, yeah, you're making me mean. No I'm not a quitter, yeah, I'm one for the “team”.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Slq-qEMNlGRe_KZYlGjYX.png?height=1280&width=960)\\n\\n### Yo, quit playing with me. \\n\\nDamn, man. I can’t care less 'bout what you gotta say. Save that shit for some other day. \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PTNl83i-2E6dhMjoa8BZr.png?height=202&width=740)\\n\\nOut on the street corner again. Jumping subway gates. \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RJ3EC9-sCYGYOvHH9nGx4.png?height=1074&width=726)\\n\\n### Yeah it’s overwhelming, but what else can we do? \\n\\nAre you going to eat that? I just go where I go. \\n\\nA radical rebel.
