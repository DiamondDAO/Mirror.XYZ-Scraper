"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"For a kid that grew up on Hip Hop and street fashion, [Realy](https://twitter.com/RealyOfficial) is the first metaverse to put the things I love together, so I had to dig in to see what’s good. I got to meet with George, the co-founder, to learn about their team and roadmap. I want to share with the community why I think they are well positioned to build the coolest metaverse out there.\\n\\n![Virgil Ablo hugging Kanye West after his first runway as the new creative director of Louis Vuitton](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*2stFEQxdLDgQYb7a)\\n\\nIf you follow what’s going on in fashion, you know that after street fashion made its way to the top of high fashion, with black American designers like [Kanye](https://twitter.com/kanyewest) and [Virgil](https://twitter.com/virgilabloh), RIP, the newest wave is the Cyberpunk and Y2K aesthetics pioneered by independent designers, and a lot of these designers are coming from Asia\\n\\n![by Keiga](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*XYmrTMhgvJN8pH6nhm9OEw.png)\\n\\n![SCRY by Zixiong Wei](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*vcc_5J2hMew0eUNXdoCsZg.png)\\n\\nThese fly sneakers and jackets with lasers shooting out of them are not easily produced into actual clothing if you are an independent designer. How do these talented designers monetize their work and keep doing the things they love? Welcome to the [Metaverse](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Metaverse?src=hashtag_click).\\n\\n[Realy](https://twitter.com/RealyOfficial)’s long game is building is a place designers and brands can sell and market their virtual clothing.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*Ow9GNlpb5ACD8ef8MGsZig.png)\\n\\nI had doubts on why people would spend a lot of money on virtual clothing, too, then I saw League of Legends’ mobile version made 1.5 billion USD in 2021 selling characters and skins.\\n\\nThe team at [Realy](https://twitter.com/RealyOfficial) had experience managing [Innersect](http://www.innersect.net/#/), an annual pop culture event for fashion, art and tech in Shanghai, much like [ComplexCon](https://twitter.com/ComplexCon). The team has brand relationships to Revenge, [88rising](https://twitter.com/88rising), Daft Punk, etc.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*zSds-pW84C--Tb5U)\\n\\nXXXTENTACION wearing Revenge Hoodie\\n\\nRealy is working on a [virtual concert with KnowKnow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6L_IFWCjp4), aka the Chinese Biggie, who [broke out internationally with the group HigherBrothers in 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDrLlIj0qes). The concert is planed to happen in March 2022, in Realy’s Metaverse, KOOOLA.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*Ab_jdykdoK92ONxmcyRagg.png)\\n\\nI see [Realy](https://twitter.com/RealyOfficial) being a place where fashion brands, artists and designers can market themselves in ways they can’t do in the physical world\\n\\nNow, a lot of people are thinking: how far can they take this internationally, being a Chinese team. That’s a legit question, because not many people have seen Chinese cultural brands with international appeal, but I think that is changing on a macro level in global business, tech, fashion, entertainment.\\n\\nLike web3, street culture is a global culture, it was born from the black and latino kids in the US, but there wouldn’t be as big as it is today if it wasn’t adapted and loved by others, and there wouldn’t be a project like [Realy](https://twitter.com/RealyOfficial).\\n\\nThe demographic [Realy](https://twitter.com/RealyOfficial) is reaching expands outside of crypto, it’s the GenZs that are born in a much more global pop culture. They are the group that will be much more integrated in the metaverse.\",\"timestamp\":1641464899,\"title\":\"Realy, For the Metaverse-Native Generation\"},\"digest\":\"ZqJJBVJtJJzONjVDGvMNG3Gs02H_o80es5BGoiJ0QhI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xe22fc426B3e9703bf4576085e479F7FDF8C1A8Ba\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2PB77RPIYPCj5vZKb40YQjF3k_tjsIWtttG6Ava-W8k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FMXXlXHdIJRxA-kIpNB7Na0sJGq7w0jENg90b1nhFVw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"SAql_kcQokmvuRvcvkj4-elP0pLGiCixvZD1aYj-M2hCjHVSShnI2RQvnpjUn3XR0Iz35qsrF-enNOy4osfhAg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9dcfc38005b6440c8a0dfab0c6c3e4619d944d9f284b9f60b2a609bbd5c6ba1351364e9ddb88a77cc57c7be5d931f8ab6e34a74f5a5cecdae45473ca871b2e111c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2PB77RPIYPCj5vZKb40YQjF3k_tjsIWtttG6Ava-W8k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FMXXlXHdIJRxA-kIpNB7Na0sJGq7w0jENg90b1nhFVw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ZqJJBVJtJJzONjVDGvMNG3Gs02H_o80es5BGoiJ0QhI\"}"
