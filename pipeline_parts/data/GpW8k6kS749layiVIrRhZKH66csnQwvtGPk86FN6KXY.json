The two parties will jointly explore the possibilities of technology integrations, and work together to build a cross-chain DeFi ecosystem.\\n\\nHop is a scalable rollup-to-rollup general token bridge. It allows users to send tokens from one rollup to another almost immediately without having to wait for the rollup’s challenge period.\\n\\nWePiggy focuses on building an open-source, non-custodial crypto-asset lending market protocol that helps users realize asset appreciation and maximize utilization across many blockchain networks. On the premise of giving priority to funding security, WePiggy actively creates a more diverse lending market, optimizes the execution efficiency of smart contracts, and expands more dimensions of the business logic. Under the WePiggy multi-chain deployment plan, WePiggy is covering Ethereum, OKExChain, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Huobi Eco Chain, and innovative public and Layer-2 networks.\\n\\n## **WePiggy + Hop**\\n\\nHop’s token bridge technology can be integrated into WePiggy lending application, and this will help WePiggy’s users to fast transfer their tokens between different networks.\\n\\nWePiggy has first added an entrance in its application to give users an alternative solution for the cross-chain bridge.\\n\\nOn the basis of mutual benefit between the two communities, more cooperation will be carried out, including co-marketing campaigns, cross-chain liquidity building, cross-chain collateral repayment and user asset appreciation, etc.\\n\\n***“Hop enables users to transfer tokens between EVM-compatible scaling solutions, which is a very useful feature for most users. Through this cooperation, we can expand WePiggy’s influence to a larger user base and provide them with secure, powerful and user-friendly cross-chain DeFi applications.”***\\n\\n– Ron, Zheng, Founder and CEO of WePiggy\\n\\n***“We are happy to work with WePiggy as our first partner in the lending & borrowing sector and look forward to exploring options to make their multi-chain app experience smooth and seamless.”***\\n\\n– Chris Whinfrey, Founder of Hop\\n\\n## ***About WePiggy***\\n\\nWePiggy is an open-source, non-custodial, crypto asset lending market protocol. In WePiggy’s market, users can deposit their crypto assets to earn interest, or borrow other crypto assets by paying interest. WePiggy aims to spread the benefits of cryptocurrency’s freedom and transparency to the widest possible user community in a more friendly and simple way, as well as be a good partner for them in wealth management.\\n\\n**[Website](https://wepiggy.com/)**\\\\*\\\\* | **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/wepiggydotcom)** | **[Medium](https://wepiggy-com.medium.com/)** | **[Forum](https://gov.wepiggy.com/)** | **[Discord](https://discord.gg/pew9k58)** | **[Github](https://github.com/WePiggy)** | \\\\*\\\\***[Telegram](https://t.me/wepiggy)**\\n\\n## About Hop\\n\\nHop is a protocol for sending tokens across rollups and their shared layer-1 network in a quick and trustless manner. Rollups have the potential to scale the Ethereum network, but each rollup creates a siloed environment for its applications. Moving assets between rollups and the layer-1 network is slow and expensive, diminishing the savings users gain by using the rollup. The Hop protocol allows assets to be moved directly from rollup to rollup, providing cost savings and enabling cross-rollup composability of applications\\n\\n**[Website](https://hop.exchange/)** | **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/HopProtocol)**[ ](https://twitter.com/HopProtocol)|[ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/maticnetwork/)**[Discord](https://discord.gg/PwCF88emV4)** |[\\\\*\\\\* \\\\*\\\\*](https://t.me/maskbook_group)[\\\\*\\\\*Medium \\\\*\\\\*](https://medium.com/hop-protocol)| **[GitHub](https://github.com/hop-protocol)**\\\\*\\\\* \\\\*\\\\*| **[WhitePaper](https://hop.exchange/whitepaper.pdf)**\",\"timestamp\":1636681519,\"title\":\"WePiggy Partners with Hop to Build a Cross-Chain DeFi Ecosystem\"},\"digest\":\"z_etJMdsSe9-aqizthNrgHhYFRPdE6CgmKe16cZiavo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xf14a9FA917a5517867e4e0018f320c1F6BF6f182\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MOToXuaua0SJZ5_SQSsecHvAOLw5KxmLTKhH_Amk1Lw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eHu9Uej8BHwgyRn4jxCzG9EQ1R29cSjilBrFY8fm7pw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"oH3FWRuoYXZseF5OYdjdWSfL8gvaGIkTlHTzvnN0BnVdGuIoOg_Dv4FgX51v1q3L7h3Fckhk-StBln0RroRPYg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc82d064579e95fce57e72d8f3e37759f40fd261e5df790f87edb0ce708ab9b09088a8d04cbf29e5ca12f34f0b482a37f2f71c105a2ea08c50f6161ee26251fa01b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MOToXuaua0SJZ5_SQSsecHvAOLw5KxmLTKhH_Amk1Lw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eHu9Uej8BHwgyRn4jxCzG9EQ1R29cSjilBrFY8fm7pw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"z_etJMdsSe9-aqizthNrgHhYFRPdE6CgmKe16cZiavo\"}"
