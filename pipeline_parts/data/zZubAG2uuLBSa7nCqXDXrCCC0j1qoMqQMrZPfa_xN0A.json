"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"A FEW large lizards were running nimbly about in the clefts of\\n\\nan old tree; they could understand one another very well, for they\\n\\nspoke the lizard language.\\n\\n```\\n\\\"What a buzzing and a rumbling there is in the elfin hill,\\\" said\\n```\\n\\none of the lizards; \\\"I have not been able to close my eyes for two\\n\\nnights on account of the noise; I might just as well have had the\\n\\ntoothache, for that always keeps me awake.\\\"\\n\\n```\\n\\\"There is something going on within there,\\\" said the other lizard;\\n```\\n\\n\\\"they propped up the top of the hill with four red posts, till\\n\\ncock-crow this morning, so that it is thoroughly aired, and the\\n\\nelfin girls have learnt new dances; there is something.\\\"\\n\\n```\\n\\\"I spoke about it to an earth-worm of my acquaintance,\\\" said a\\n```\\n\\nthird lizard; \\\"the earth-worm had just come from the elfin hill, where\\n\\nhe has been groping about in the earth day and night. He has heard a\\n\\ngreat deal; although he cannot see, poor miserable creature, yet he\\n\\nunderstands very well how to wriggle and lurk about. They expect\\n\\nfriends in the elfin hill, grand company, too; but who they are the\\n\\nearth-worm would not say, or, perhaps, he really did not know. All the\\n\\nwill-o'-the-wisps are ordered to be there to hold a torch dance, as it\\n\\nis called. The silver and gold which is plentiful in the hill will\\n\\nbe polished and placed out in the moonlight.\\\"\\n\\n```\\n\\\"Who can the strangers be?\\\" asked the lizards; \\\"what can the\\n```\\n\\nmatter be? Hark, what a buzzing and humming there is!\\\"\\n\\n```\\nJust at this moment the elfin hill opened, and an old elfin\\n```\\n\\nmaiden, hollow behind, came tripping out; she was the old elf king's\\n\\nhousekeeper, and a distant relative of the family; therefore she\\n\\nwore an amber heart on the middle of her forehead. Her feet moved very\\n\\nfast, \\\"trip, trip;\\\" good gracious, how she could trip right down to\\n\\nthe sea to the night-raven.\\n\\n```\\n\\\"You are invited to the elf hill for this evening,\\\" said she; \\\"but\\n```\\n\\nwill you do me a great favor and undertake the invitations? you\\n\\nought to do something, for you have no housekeeping to attend to as\\n\\nI have. We are going to have some very grand people, conjurors, who\\n\\nhave always something to say; and therefore the old elf king wishes to\\n\\nmake a great display.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1636531642,\"title\":\"FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN THE ELFIN HILL\"},\"digest\":\"rQKuXjs9qWV3N457pqZK6QvTBcEueBZWak0o9qePsiw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD6FFaeE2D21c98999e3c40052687ea652b1411a9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1ZNGbA8hw50NqTEH60pjWtttAxTmj-O0q7ZAWIpIk0I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Epibr8SDl9ci73c4unNeA-8NllUfAXuSKPWIm6Niu6Y\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ZPzGsBhUmmheU7NynA0QUtLxRKIrwY8yT3m3nCHHvjErBRMtcUlUk8M4o2hVYx6UZXwFn_eB4gN3a9KSIpYfPg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb13d364ecd5e04aa25ca6557de5d189f61a2cbb86427e42295a20a7b062a8d42191f967d5c21fc550f4cef070e74615201c656b41dc700c6e43dad71f764389b1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1ZNGbA8hw50NqTEH60pjWtttAxTmj-O0q7ZAWIpIk0I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Epibr8SDl9ci73c4unNeA-8NllUfAXuSKPWIm6Niu6Y\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rQKuXjs9qWV3N457pqZK6QvTBcEueBZWak0o9qePsiw\"}"
