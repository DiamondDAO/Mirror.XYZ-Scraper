"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1991 Moscow\\n\\nIt was one of the final chapters in the USSR's history of targeting of U.S. facilities and staff. \\n\\nThe U.S. Ambassador's meeting with a KGB chief began with polite talk. His host gave him a file which confirmed decades of suspicion. The new U.S. embassy building in Moscow was filled with listening devices. The USSR admitted what was long denied, the building was a microphone.\\n\\nBoth the U.S. and USSR needed bigger office space by 1969. \\n\\nAfter much political and diplomatic hurdles were jumped, construction began in 1979. The USSR built in Washington D.C., and the U.S. built in Moscow - each side watched construction.\\n\\nDevices were mixed in the concrete, along with decoys. It was also in the steel parts, pieces of rebar were antennae for transmissions. The lights of a nearby house of worship would go on and off at irregular hours - nick-named the \\\"church of holy telemetry\\\".\\n\\nIt was hoped that by sharing the file, trust was earned in the era of \\\"glasnost\\\" - \\\"openness\\\". That was impossible in a long Cold War.\\n\\nIn 1946, U.S. Ambassador to the USSR received a gift from Russian children of the Great Seal of the U.S. carved in wood. \\n\\nFor years, it was on a wall of the Ambassador's private residence. It was later found to have a listening device. The caretaker of the residence always kept his basement office locked - it was the caretaker's base of operations for planting bugs throughout the house.\\n\\nNSA experts reported to POTUS 40, Reagan, that the new building was a honeycomb of \\\"bugs\\\". the U.S. embassy was a running joke known as \\\"the bug house\\\", and was less than two-thirds done.\\n\\nJust weeks at the Ambassador's meeting meeting with the KGB chief, the USSR collapsed.\\n\\n2912 Earth Orbit - The Necklace\\n\\nJacob C. Tagore, Jr. grew up as a descendant of the first Spacers. \\n\\nNothing prepared him for the opulence of \\\"The Necklace\\\" of Earth. He just took it all in, a glutton at a banquet of sights.\\n\\nThe view from \\\"Necklace\\\", the glittering, shimmering and shifting city orbiting Earth, was stunning. It was one of the wonders of the System. It was a display of the opulence of the \\\"Mother World\\\".\\n\\nIn the years after the Long War, the \\\"Necklace\\\", repurposed from generations of industry and war, became a showcase for Earth's prosperity. There were other sky-cities around the other worlds. When someone said \\\"The Necklace\\\", everyone knew it meant Earth's.\\n\\nThe diplomatic residences included palatial skybuoys which floated above the skies of Earth and trawled the great filaments and skyhooks suspended from the Necklace.\\n\\nSome staff were already headed down-planet. Jacob's combat and flight training prepared him for operating in a 1G “well”.\\n\\n\\\"Your quarters have been prepared, sir. This way please.” \\n\\nJacob followed the drone down the hall. \\n\\n\\\"Your calendar of appointments are ready, and begin next week. Until then, please enjoy the compliments of this skybuoy. Here are a list of sights and events.\\\"\\n\\nJacob began to read the and decipher the messages tucked within the tourist material and dry trade delegation documents. There was still time to enjoy some of the local culture. He had a premium invitation to an Expee created by a new hit sensation called Lenamay. \\n\\nThere was time for a little relaxation.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/L1BwrEhvoJvaAXxQ-zzVp.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CVf7TX5xg46XVYV0tzZfc.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633898229,\"title\":\"1961: 5.15 Secret In The Walls, 2912\"},\"digest\":\"w-8bC5vZHGvFVjU-hXjFEoXjcnCqhBAsaFFE__oCLkw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"5lt6na-YqZEcsavBcv1IWwQ3lbOK35RSoyHsSGhuYLvCuhZl6CQY5cVYnXjuqUqXzvLPDPv_7cpeG1rVdMBc_A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"w-8bC5vZHGvFVjU-hXjFEoXjcnCqhBAsaFFE__oCLkw\"}"
