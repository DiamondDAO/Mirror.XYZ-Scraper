They drip from moonlight and the edges of stars, sculpt each other from beeswax and jackal fangs, and sample strange delicacies from demon bazaars.\\n\\n**WITCHES** live in the in-between. In the space between eyelids, in the spines of books. WITCHES build treasures with toadstools, turmeric bricks, turpentine, twine. WITCHES are dangerous. They brush their hair with henna for luster and blood for shine.\\n\\n**WITCHES** own the Milky Way. They’re smart with the property market like that. They hold little rocks in the plushness of their hands and haggle them down to get a good deal. WITCHES know when things have value. They are collectors, curators, equal admirers of rubies and refuse. A WITCH is magic even in their speech, in their song, in the light beneath their feet. A WITCH would never lose their hat. A WITCH can never be caught.\\n\\n…\\n\\n**WITCHCRAFT** is about intuition. About listening to the quiet, about the freedom to choose and go where one wishes, about maintaining the balance of things.\\n\\nA **WITCH** does not grow in the way you expect; they only grow stranger.\\n\\nWhile no one may own a **WITCH**, anyone can become one. And when you’re a WITCH, you cannot be bound—may you be naked in your rites until the last of your oppressors are dead.\\n\\n(more to come)\\n\\n[https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1634794068,\"title\":\"intro - cryptocoven\"},\"digest\":\"ox6mls0ST2DtTQDNlJ6qw_B_NlLLmz-QN7tp-fVLhdE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xB72900a2e885dF6A2824969B6e40B969C8ae3CB7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"urxgZspfgqhis3e3rCamgACxToluIHumyDKS9nZwSyI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"IxTsNM_DzPHPF_4e7wqKfTldau0qAA_v2sPoIEyWdBQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"AhhgcWNqttJs5TEVJ4_2cRGiKLDYArzKWQ8lbQ3Siw8xpXYPTp0PbXbDlKLNKiiY0nbLgDiMasB6q9bUo2SokQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1ddb78be6e13ec5387caecde6e4c13aa82ccd34f8907a3233f8b11abaaa4ff7222b8d3bd9adcb863a4b49bdcdd9dc02d074182b1fbb83a35fcc617a5d79d21d11b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"urxgZspfgqhis3e3rCamgACxToluIHumyDKS9nZwSyI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"IxTsNM_DzPHPF_4e7wqKfTldau0qAA_v2sPoIEyWdBQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ymU6XYNaA7V0EX6DJkwI6YWDDCXnbFjx3kP9KhlkI_o\"}"
