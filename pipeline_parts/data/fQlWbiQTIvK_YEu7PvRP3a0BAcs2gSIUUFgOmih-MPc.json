"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"MANY, many years ago lived an emperor, who thought so much of\\n\\nnew clothes that he spent all his money in order to obtain them; his\\n\\nonly ambition was to be always well dressed. He did not care for his\\n\\nsoldiers, and the theatre did not amuse him; the only thing, in\\n\\nfact, he thought anything of was to drive out and show a new suit of\\n\\nclothes. He had a coat for every hour of the day; and as one would say\\n\\nof a king \\\"He is in his cabinet,\\\" so one could say of him, \\\"The\\n\\nemperor is in his dressing-room.\\\"\\n\\n```\\nThe great city where he resided was very gay; every day many\\n```\\n\\nstrangers from all parts of the globe arrived. One day two swindlers\\n\\ncame to this city; they made people believe that they were weavers,\\n\\nand declared they could manufacture the finest cloth to be imagined.\\n\\nTheir colours and patterns, they said, were not only exceptionally\\n\\nbeautiful, but the clothes made of their material possessed the\\n\\nwonderful quality of being invisible to any man who was unfit for\\n\\nhis office or unpardonably stupid.\\n\\n```\\n\\\"That must be wonderful cloth,\\\" thought the emperor. \\\"If I were to\\n```\\n\\nbe dressed in a suit made of this cloth I should be able to find out\\n\\nwhich men in my empire were unfit for their places, and I could\\n\\ndistinguish the clever from the stupid. I must have this cloth woven\\n\\nfor me without delay.\\\" And he gave a large sum of money to the\\n\\nswindlers, in advance, that they should set to work without any loss\\n\\nof time. They set up two looms, and pretended to be very hard at work,\\n\\nbut they did nothing whatever on the looms. They asked for the\\n\\nfinest silk and the most precious gold-cloth; all they got they did\\n\\naway with, and worked at the empty looms till late at night.\\n\\n```\\n\\\"I should very much like to know how they are getting on with\\n```\\n\\nthe cloth,\\\" thought the emperor. But he felt rather uneasy when he\\n\\nremembered that he who was not fit for his office could not see it.\\n\\nPersonally, he was of opinion that he had nothing to fear, yet he\\n\\nthought it advisable to send somebody else first to see how matters\\n\\nstood. Everybody in the town knew what a remarkable quality the\\n\\nstuff possessed, and all were anxious to see how bad or stupid their\\n\\nneighbours were.\\n\\n```\\n\\\"I shall send my honest old minister to the weavers,\\\" thought\\n```\\n\\nthe emperor. \\\"He can judge best how the stuff looks, for he is\\n\\nintelligent, and nobody understands his office better than he.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1636532276,\"title\":\"FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN\"},\"digest\":\"MG4fL8IY7Pbj2KScJBNYq7KsWf8F9fxfx4ppD1Mcu2E\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x118719A355F8Fe62814694d032B8397B01aa196f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"KmUeWvWjbNxG2Hot2yF81M1kUtz4RF6qjoGHYy_hHsY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"btQP876qjWba4SS6Lim9i7cmBCGbF2p-SMUIG8NlOY8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"xzzNwkbK-JKAImd9UT568Kv4sEaWq4E3lfczh1tIzGvDKo-wh57o1lsKbi6sEkQAhJN3na5qzJhNT-p1mtxSgg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa7d5edec689ee56e7441fe8d1d09f9534261fe49659ccb7d3978ff8ef625e80653e5965c4daf8c253314b0fb8178f4e49072d6f304b2d1a1e5bdae6d2d4e76201c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"KmUeWvWjbNxG2Hot2yF81M1kUtz4RF6qjoGHYy_hHsY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"btQP876qjWba4SS6Lim9i7cmBCGbF2p-SMUIG8NlOY8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"MG4fL8IY7Pbj2KScJBNYq7KsWf8F9fxfx4ppD1Mcu2E\"}"
