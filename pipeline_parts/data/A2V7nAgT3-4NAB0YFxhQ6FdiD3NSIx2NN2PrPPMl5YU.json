"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I've abandoned the industry where the enigma of individual gains is covered with layers of bullshit and deceit. These realities of state-wide production exclude the typical European unions' impact: producers constantly have to guess or ask each other personally for the average temperature in the room according to on-hands budget. As a result, the less you know how much money your close producer friend has, the better you sleep at night.\\n\\nBlockchain is different (duh). At first, you are just scared of this level of transparency. Then, you start to envy people. With each new turn on Etherscan, you stumble upon somebody incredibly wealthy, making all the right moves. Someday it may even be the same producer you used to talk to months ago on some production project. Now you know how wealthy he really is. *The only thing left for you to feel is the embarrassment: for not getting into web3 earlier, not investing enough of your own money, and making all these stupid decisions on useless gas-wasting swaps.* And don't let me start on a flopped NFT project, which roadmap looked \\\"promising.\\\"\\n\\nThis baffling thought – that you started losing without even entering correctly – is still poisoning my head. And to be honest, it speaks more about my psyche than about the objective reality. Five years inside an up-and-coming production company will make anybody care about cash flow a lot. Selective attention can be toxic. The most critical next step now is to stop being this affected by somebody's wealth. That's probably my personal wish for 2022: to just stop looking into other people's mouths and focus on your own value. No matter how small the resources are now, it's better to constantly remind yourself that you're not here for the cash flow only. Ironically, for the first time ever. This openness allows learning from other people and from their successes and strategies. If they are doing something right, you can too. **The web3 is the most phenomenal equalizer that we as humans have ever had.** That sounds like a huge advantage.\",\"timestamp\":1640097226,\"title\":\"21.12.21\"},\"digest\":\"Ozz_fLWwWW3u7lgqechhvNjSAXVYJ2tdRsdSfqF9hv0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xCfc4BF2ccD9bc5a3F91225c39c40Cdd57F041cf6\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"W6_ht8lcstIWkOLWSWf4nfER0q6qI3ErDV2QsXl-1kg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"iONp4WjvW0zBBAQU3moX9Jj5uf4M0Rc4-i2UmKY5VbI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"iEoUcBRivdYwQxAg7txcXZJSRbc2ZExg2dop7ztBxglDG4G5Qd_wneWJNOSuKTCt49q-LLt9_uGgvZOEHegAbw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x172975744f16fdfa83664f649e4e65cbf195e813508bc7f49538176a89b9dacc65499c425a01092ce9b142abd13f7f00b8faa3d9685a7ffbb0f31f33c3a8defa1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"W6_ht8lcstIWkOLWSWf4nfER0q6qI3ErDV2QsXl-1kg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"iONp4WjvW0zBBAQU3moX9Jj5uf4M0Rc4-i2UmKY5VbI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Ozz_fLWwWW3u7lgqechhvNjSAXVYJ2tdRsdSfqF9hv0\"}"
