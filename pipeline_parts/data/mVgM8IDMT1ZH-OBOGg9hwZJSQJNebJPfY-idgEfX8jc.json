"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"and Miss Laura said that some of them were noble people. \\\"Well,\\nI'm glad this particular nobleman has left us,\\\" said Mr. Wood, seating himself\\non one of the boxes, \\\"if nobleman he is. I should call him in plain English, a\\nscoundrel. Did Harry show you his note?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, uncle,\\\" said Miss Laura.\\n\\n\\\"Read it aloud,\\\" said Mr. Wood. \\\"I'd like to hear it again.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Laura read:\\n\\nJ. WOOD, Esq., Dear Sir: It is a matter of great regret to me that I am suddenly\\ncalled away from my place at Penhollow, and will therefore not be able to do\\nmyself the pleasure of calling on you and settling my little account. I sincere\\nhope that the possession of my live stock, which I make entirely over to you,\\nwill more than reimburse you for any trifling expense which you may have\\nincurred on my account. If it is any gratification to you to know that you have\\nrendered a slight assistance to the son of one of England's noblest noblemen,\\nyou have it. With expressions of the deepest respect, and hoping that my stock\\nmay be in good condition when you take possession,\\n\\nI am, dear sir, ever devotedly yours,\\n\\nHOWARD ALGERNON LEDUC BARRON.\\n\\nMiss Laura dropped the paper. \\\"Uncle, did he leave those animals to starve?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Didn't you notice,\\\" said Mr. Wood, grimly, \\\"that there wasn't a wisp of hay\\ninside that shanty, and that where the poor beasts were tied up the wood was\\nknawed and bitten by them in their torture for food? Wouldn't he have sent me\\nthat note, instead of leaving it here on the table, if he'd wanted me to know?\\nThe note isn't dated, but I judge he's been gone five or six days. He has had a\\nspite against me ever since I lent him that hundred dollars. I don't know why,\\nfor I've stood up for him when others would have run him out of the place. He\\nintended me to come here and find every animal lying dead. He even had a rope\\naround the pig's neck. Harry, my boy, let us go and look after them again. I\\nlove a dumb brute too well to let it suffer, but in this case I'd give two\\nhundred dollars more if I could make them live and have Barron know it.\\\"\\n\\nThey left the room, and Miss Laura sat turning the sheet of paper over and over,\\nwith a kind of horror in her face. It was a very dirty piece of paper, but by-\\nand-by she made a discovery. She took it in her hand and went out-doors. I am\\nsure that the poor horse lying on the grass knew her. He lifted his head, and\\nwhat a different expression he had now that his hunger had been partly\\nsatisfied. Miss Laura stroked and patted him, then she called to her cousin,\\n\\\"Harry, will you look at this?\\\"\\n\\nHe took the paper from her, and said: \\\"that is a crest shining through the\\ndifferent strata of dust and grime, probably that of his own family. We'll have\\nit cleaned, and it will enable us to track the villain. You want him punished,\\ndon't you?\\\" he said, with a little, sly laugh at Mist Laura.\\n\\nShe made a gesture in the direction of the suffering horse, and said, frankly,\\n\\\"Yes, I do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, my dear girl,\\\" he said, \\\"father and I are with you. If we can hunt Barron\\ndown, we'll do it.\\\" Then he muttered to himself as she turned away, \\\"She is a\\nreal Puritan, gentle, and sweet, and good, and yet severe. Rewards for the\\nvirtuous, punishments for the vicious,\\\" and he repeated some poetry:\\n\\n\\\"She was so charitable and so piteous,\\n\\nShe would weep if that she saw a mouseCaught in a trap, if it were dead or\\nbled.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Laura saw that Mr. Wood and Mr. Harry were doing all that could be done for\\nthe cow and horse, so she wandered down to a hollow at the back of the house,\\nwhere the Englishman had kept his pig. Just now, he looked more like a greyhound\\nthan a pig. His legs were so long, his nose so sharp, and hunger, instead of\\nmaking him stupid like the horse and cow, had made him more lively. I think he\\nhad probably not suffered so much as they had, or perhaps he had had a greater\\nstore of fat to nourish him. Mr. Harry said that if he had been a girl, he would\\nhave laughed and cried at the same time when he discovered that pig. He must\\nhave been asleep or exhausted when we arrived, for there was not a sound out of\\nhim, but shortly afterward he had set up a yelling that attracted Mr. Harry's\\nattention, and made him run down to him. Mr. Harry said he was raging around his\\npen, digging the ground with his snout, falling down and getting up again, and\\nby a miracle, escaping death by choking from the rope that was tied around his\\nneck.\\n\\nNow that his hunger had been satisfied, he was gazing contentedly at his little\\ntrough that was half full of good, sweet milk. Mr. Harry said that a starving\\nanimal, like a starving person, should only be fed a little at a time; but the\\nEnglishman's animals had always been fed poorly, and their stomachs had\\ncontracted so that they could not eat much at one time.\\n\\nMiss Laura got a stick and scratched poor piggy's back a little, and then she\\nwent back to the house. In a short time we went home with Mr. Wood. Mr. Harry\\nwas going to stay all night with the sick animals, and his mother would send him\\nthings to make him comfortable. She was better by the time we got home, and was\\nhorrified to hear the tale of Mr. Barron's neglect. Later in the evening, she\\nsent one of the men over with a whole box full of things for her darling boy,\\nand nice, hot tea, done up for him in a covered dish. When the man came home, he\\nsaid that Mr. Harry would not sleep in the Englishman's dirty house, but had\\nslung a hammock out under the trees. However, he would not be able to sleep\\nmuch, for he had his lantern by his side, all ready to jump up and attend to the\\nhorse and cow. It was a very lonely place for him out there in the woods, and\\nhis mother said that she would be glad when the sick animals could be driven to\\ntheir own farm.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVIII  THE END OF THE ENGLISHMAN\\n\\nIN a few days, thanks to Mr. Harry's constant care, the horse and cow were able\\nto walk. It was a mournful procession that came into the yard at Dingley Farm.\\nThe hollow-eyed horse, and lean cow, and funny, little thin pig, staggering\\nalong in such a shaky fashion. Their hoofs were diseased, and had partly rotted\\naway, so that they could not walk straight. Though it was only a mile or two\\nfrom Penhollow to Dingley Farm, they were tired out, and dropped down exhausted\\non their comfortable beds.\\n\\nMiss Laura was so delighted to think that they had all lived, that she did not\\nknow what to do. Her eyes were bright and shining, and she went from one to\\nanother with such a happy face. The queer little pig that Mr. Harry had\\nchristened \\\"Daddy Longlegs,\\\" had been washed, and he lay on his heap of straw in\\nthe corner of his neat little pen, and surveyed his clean trough and abundance\\nof food with the air of a prince. Why, he would be clean and dry here, and all\\nhis life he had been used to dirty, damp Penhollow, with the trees hanging over\\nhim, and his little feet in a mass of filth and dead leaves. Happy little pig!\\nHis ugly eyes seemed to blink and gleam with gratitude, and he knew Miss Laura\\nand Mr. Harry as well as I did.\\n\\nHis tiny tail was curled so tight that it was almost in a knot. Mr. Wood said\\nthat was a sign that he was healthy and happy: and that when poor Daddy was at\\nPenhollow he had noticed that his tail hung as limp and as loose as the tail of\\na rat. He came and leaned over the pen with Miss Laura, and had a little talk\\nwith her about pigs. He said they were by no means the stupid animals that some\\npeople considered them. He had had pigs that were as clever as dogs. One little\\nblack pig that he had once sold to a man away back in the country had found his\\nway home, through the woods, across the river, up hill and down dale, and he'd\\nbeen taken to the place with a bag over his head. Mr. Wood said that he kept\\nthat pig because he knew so much.\\n\\nHe said the most knowing pigs he ever saw were Canadian pigs. One time he was\\nhaving a trip on a sailing vessel, and it anchored in a long, narrow harbor in\\nCanada, where the tide came in with a front four or five feet high called the\\n\\\"bore.\\\" There was a village opposite the place where the ship was anchored, and\\nevery day at low tide, a number of pigs came down to look for shell-fish.\\nSometimes they went out for half a mile over the mud flats, but always a few\\nminutes before the tide came rushing in they turned and hurried to the shore.\\nTheir instincts warned them that if they stayed any longer they would be\\ndrowned.\\n\\nMr. Wood had a number of pigs, and after a while Daddy was put in with them, and\\na fine time he had of it making friends with the other little grunters. They\\nwere often let out in the pasture or orchard, and when they were there, I could\\nalways single out Daddy from among them, because he was the smartest. Though he\\nhad been brought up in such a miserable way, he soon learned to take very good\\ncare of himself at Dingley Farm, and it was amusing to see him when a storm was\\ncoming on, running about in a state of great excitement carrying little bundles\\nof straw in his mouth to make himself a bed. He was a white pig, and was always\\nkept very clean. Mr. Wood said that it is wrong to keep pigs dirty. They like to\\nbe clean as well as other animals, and if they were kept so, human beings would\\nnot get so many diseases from eating their flesh.\\n\\nThe cow, poor unhappy creature, never, as long as she lived on Dingley Farm,\\nlost a strange melancholy look from her eyes. I have heard it said that animals\\nforget past unhappiness, and perhaps some of them do. I know that I have never\\nforgotten my one miserable year with Jenkins, and I have been a sober,\\nthoughtful dog in consequence of it, and not playful like some dogs who have\\nnever known what it is to be really unhappy.\\n\\nIt always seemed to me that the Englishman's cow was thinking of her poor dead\\ncalf, starved to death by her cruel master. She got well herself, and came and\\nwent with the other cows, seemingly as happy as they, but often when I watched\\nher standing chewing her cud, and looking away in the distance, I could see a\\ndifference between her face and the faces of the cows that had always been happy\\non Dingley Farm. Even the farm hands called her \\\"Old Melancholy,\\\" and soon she\\ngot to be known by that name, or Mel, for short. Until she got well, she was put\\ninto the cow stable, where Mr. Wood's cows all stood at night upon raised\\nplatforms of earth covered over with straw litter, and she was tied with a Dutch\\nhalter, so that she could lie down and go to sleep when she wanted to. When she\\ngot well, she was put out to pasture with the other cows.\\n\\nThe horse they named \\\"Scrub,\\\" because he could never be, under any circumstance,\\nanything but a broken-down, plain-looking animal. He was put into the horse\\nstable in a stall next Fleetfoot, and as the partition was low, they could look\\nover at each other. In time, by dint of much doctoring, Scrub's hoofs became\\nclean and sound and he was able to do some work. Miss Laura petted him a great\\ndeal. She often took out apples to the stable, and Fleetfoot would throw up his\\nbeautiful head and look reproachfully over the partition at her, for she always\\nstayed longer with Scrub than with him, and Scrub always got the larger share of\\nwhatever good thing was going.\\n\\nPoor old Scrub! I think he loved Miss Laura. He was a stupid sort of a horse,\\nand always acted as if he was blind. He would run his nose up and down the front\\nof her dress, nip at the buttons, and be very happy if he could get a bit of her\\nwatch-chain between his strong teeth. If he was in the field he never seemed to\\nknow her till she was right under his pale-colored eyes. Then he would be\\ndelighted to see her. He was not blind, though, for Mr. Wood said he was not. He\\nsaid he had probably not been an over-bright horse to start with, and had been\\nmade more dull by cruel usage.\\n\\nAs for the Englishman, the master of these animals, a very strange thing\\nhappened to him. He came to a terrible end, but for a long time no one knew\\nanything about it. Mr. Wood and Mr. Harry were so very angry with him that they\\nsaid they would leave no stone unturned to have him punished, or at least to\\nhave it known what a villain he was. They sent the paper with the crest on it to\\nBoston. Some people there wrote to England, and found out that it was the crest\\nof a noble and highly esteemed family, and some earl was at the head of it. They\\nwere all honorable people in this family except one man, a nephew, not a son, of\\nthe late earl. He was the black sheep of them all. As a young man, he had led a\\nwild and wicked life, and had ended by forging the name of one of his friends,\\nso that he was obliged to leave England and take refuge in America. By the\\ndescription of this man, Mr. Wood knew that he must be Mr. Barron, so he wrote\\nto these English people, and told them what a wicked thing their relative had\\ndone in leaving his animals to starve. In a short time, he got an answer from\\nthem, which was, at the same time, very proud and very touching. It came from\\nMr. Barron's cousin, and he said quite frankly that he knew his relative was a\\nman of evil habits, but it seemed as if nothing could be done to reform him. His\\nfamily was accustomed to send a quarterly allowance to him, on condition that he\\nled a quiet life in some retired place, but their last remittance to him was\\nlying unclaimed in Boston, and they thought he must be dead. Could Mr. Wood tell\\nthem anything about him?\\n\\nMr. Wood looked very thoughtful when he got this letter, then he said, \\\"Harry,\\nhow long is it since Barron ran away?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"About eight weeks,\\\" said Mr. Harry.\\n\\n\\\"That's strange,\\\" said Mr. Wood. \\\"The money these English people sent him would\\nget to Boston just a few days after he left here. He is not the man to leave it\\nlong unclaimed. Something must have happened to him. Where do you suppose he\\nwould go from Penhollow?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have no idea, sir,\\\" said Mr. Harry.\\n\\n\\\"And how would he go?\\\" said Mr. Wood. \\\"He did not leave Riverdale Station,\\nbecause he would have been spotted by some of his creditors.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps he would cut through the woods to the Junction,\\\" said Mr. Harry.\\n\\n\\\"Just what he would do,\\\" said Mr. Wood, slapping his knee. \\\"I'll be driving over\\nthere to-morrow to see Thompson, and I'll make inquiries.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Harry spoke to his father the next night when he came home, and asked him if\\nhe had found out anything. \\\"Only this,\\\" said Mr. Wood. \\\"There's no one answering\\nto Barron's description who has left Riverdale Junction within a twelvemonth. He\\nmust have struck some other station. We'll let him go. The Lord looks out for\\nfellows like that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We will look out for him if he ever comes back to Riverdale,\\\" said Mr. Harry,\\nquietly. All through the village, and in the country it was known what a\\ndastardly trick the Englishman had played, and he would have been roughly\\nhandled if he had dared return.\\n\\nMonths passed away, and nothing was heard of him. Late in the autumn, after Miss\\nLaura and I had gone back to Fairport, Mrs. Wood wrote her about the end of the\\nEnglishman. Some Riverdale lads were beating about the woods, looking for lost\\ncattle, and in their wanderings came to an old stone quarry that had been\\ndisused for years. On one side there was a smooth wall of rock, many feet deep.\\nOn the other the ground and rock were broken away, and it was quite easy to get\\ninto it. They found that by some means or other, one of their cows had fallen\\ninto this deep pit, over the steep side of the quarry. Of course the poor\\ncreature was dead, but the boys, out of curiosity, resolved to go down and look\\nat her. They clambered down, found the cow, and, to their horror and amazement,\\ndiscovered near-by the skeleton of a man. There was a heavy walking-stick by his\\nside, which they recognized as one that the Englishman had carried.\\n\\nHe was a drinking man, and perhaps he had taken something that he thought would\\nstrengthen him for his morning's walk, but which had, on the contrary,\\nbewildered him, and made him lose his way and fall into the quarry. Or he might\\nhave started before daybreak, and in the darkness have slipped and fallen down\\nthis steep wall of rock. One leg was doubled under him, and if he had not been\\ninstantly killed by the fall, he must have been so disabled that he could not\\nmove. In that lonely place, he would call for help in vain, so he may have\\nperished by the terrible death of starvation the death he had thought to mete\\nout to his suffering animals.\\n\\nMrs. Wood said that there was never a sermon preached in Riverdale that had the\\neffect that the death of this wicked man had, and it reminded her of a verse in\\nthe Bible: \\\"He made a pit and he digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which\\nhe made.\\\" Mrs. Wood said that her husband had written about the finding of Mr.\\nBarron's body to his English relatives, and had received a letter from them in\\nwhich they seemed relieved to hear that he was dead. They thanked Mr. Wood for\\nhis plain speaking in telling them of their relative's misdeeds, and said that\\nfrom all they knew of Mr. Barron's past conduct, his influence would be for evil\\nand not for good, in any place that he choose to live in. They were having their\\nmoney sent from Boston to Mr. Wood, and they wished him to expend it in the way\\nhe thought best fitted to counteract the evil effects of their namesake's doings\\nin Riverdale.\\n\\nWhen this money came, it amounted to some hundreds of dollars. Mr. Wood would\\nhave nothing to do with it. He handed it over to the Band of Mercy, and they\\nformed what they called the \\\"Barron Fund,\\\" which they drew upon when they wanted\\nmoney for buying and circulating humane literature. Mrs. Wood said that the fund\\nwas being added to, and the children were sending all over the State leaflets\\nand little books which preached the gospel of kindness to God's lower creation.\\nA stranger picking one of them up, and seeing the name of the wicked Englishman\\nprinted on the title-page, would think that he was a friend and benefactor to\\nthe Riverdale people the very opposite of what he gloried in being.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIX  A TALK ABOUT SHEEP\\n\\nMISS LAURA was very much interested in the sheep on Dingley Farm. There was a\\nflock in the orchard near the house that she often went to see. She always\\ncarried roots and vegetables to them, turnips particularly, for they were very\\nfond of them; but they would not come to her to get them, for they did not know\\nher voice. They only lifted their heads and stared at her when she called them.\\nBut when they heard Mr. Wood's voice, they ran to the fence, bleating with\\npleasure, and trying to push their noses through to get the carrot or turnip, or\\nwhatever he was handing to them. He called them his little Southdowns, and he\\nsaid he loved his sheep, for they were the most gentle and inoffensive creature\\nthat he had on his farm.\\n\\nOne day when he came into the kitchen inquiring for salt, Miss Laura said: \\\"Is\\nit for the sheep?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" he replied; \\\"I am going up to the woods pasture to examine my\\nShropshires.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You would like to go too, Laura,\\\" said Mrs. Wood. \\\"Take your hands right away\\nfrom that cake. I'll finish frosting it for you. Run along and get your broad-\\nbrimmed hat. It's very hot.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Laura danced out into the hall and back again, and soon we were walking up,\\nback of the house, along a path that led us through the fields to the pasture.\\n\\\"What are you going to do, uncle?\\\" she said; \\\"and what are those funny things in\\nyour hands?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Toe-clippers,\\\" he replied; \\\"and I am going to examine the sheeps' hoofs. You\\nknow we've had warm, moist weather all through July, and I'm afraid of foot-rot.\\nThen they're sometimes troubled with overgrown hoofs.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you do if they get foot-rot?\\\" asked Miss Laura.\\n\\n\\\"I've various cures,\\\" he said. \\\"Paring and clipping, and dipping the hoof in\\nblue vitriol and vinegar, or rubbing it on, as the English shepherds do. It\\ndestroys the diseased part, but doesn't affect the sound.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do sheep have many diseases?\\\" asked Miss Laura. \\\"I know one of them myself that\\nis the scab.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A nasty thing that,\\\" said Mr. Wood, vigorously; \\\"and a man that builds up a\\nflock from a stockyard often finds it out to his cost.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What is it like?\\\" asked Miss Laura.\\n\\n\\\"The sheep get scabby from a microbe under the skin, which causes them to itch\\nfearfully, and they lose their wool.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And can't it be cured?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes! with time and attention. There are different remedies. I believe\\npetroleum is the best.\\\"\\n\\nBy this time we had got to a wide gate that opened into the pasture. As Mr. Wood\\nlet Miss Laura go through and then closed it behind her, he said, \\\"You are\\nlooking at that gate. You want to know why it is so long, don't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, uncle,\\\" she said; \\\"but I can't bear to ask so many questions.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ask as many as you like,\\\" he said, good-naturedly. \\\"I don't mind answering\\nthem. Have you ever seen sheep pass through a gate or door?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes, often.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And how do they act?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, so silly, uncle. They hang back, and one waits for another, and, finally,\\nthey all try to go at once.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Precisely; when one goes they all want to go, if it was to jump into a\\nbottomless pit. Many sheep are injured by overcrowding, so I have my gates and\\ndoors very wide. Now, let us call them up.\\\" There wasn't one in sight, but when\\nMr. Wood lifted up his voice and cried: \\\"Ca nan, nan, nan!\\\" black faces began to\\npeer out from among the bushes; and little black legs, carrying white bodies,\\ncame hurrying up the stony paths from the cooler parts of the pasture. Oh, how\\nglad they were to get the salt! Mr. Wood let Miss Laura spread it on some flat\\nrocks, then they sat down on a log under a tree and watched them eating it and\\nlicking the rocks when it was all gone. Miss Laura sat; fanning herself with her\\nhat and smiling at them. \\\"You funny, woolly things,\\\" she said \\\"You're not so\\nstupid as some people think you are. Lie still, Joe. If you show yourself, they\\nmay run away.\\\"\\n\\nI crouched behind the log, and only lifted my head occasionally to see what the\\nsheep were doing. Some of them went back into the woods, for it was very hot in\\nthis bare part of the pasture, but the most of them would not leave Mr. Wood,\\nand stood staring at him. \\\"That's a fine sheep, isn't it?\\\" said Miss Laura,\\npointing to one with the blackest face, and the blackest legs, and largest body\\nof those near us.\\n\\n\\\"Yes; that's old Jessica. Do you notice how she's holding her head close to the\\nground?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes; is there any reason for it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is. She's afraid of the grub fly. You often see sheep holding their noses\\nin that way in the summer time. It is to prevent the fly from going into their\\nnostrils, and depositing an egg which will turn into a grub and annoy and worry\\nthem. When the fly comes near, they give a sniff and run as if they were crazy,\\nstill holding their noses close to the ground. When I was a boy, and the sheep\\ndid that, we thought that they had colds in their heads, and used to rub tar on\\ntheir noses. We knew nothing about the fly then, but the tar cured them, and is\\njust what I use now. Two or three times a month during hot weather, we put a few\\ndrops of it on the nose of every sheep in the flock.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I suppose farmers are like other people, and are always finding out better ways\\nof doing their work, aren't they, uncle?\\\" said Miss Laura.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, my child. The older I grow, the more I find out, and the better care I\\ntake of my stock. My grandfather would open his eyes in amazement, and ask me if\\nI was an old women petting her cats if he were alive, and could know the care I\\ngive my sheep. He used to let his flock run till the fields were covered with\\nsnow, and bite as close as they liked, till there wasn't a scrap of feed left.\\nThen he would give them an open shed to run under, and throw down their hay\\noutside. Grain they scarcely knew the taste of. That they would fall off in\\nflesh, and half of them lose their lambs in the spring, was an expected thing.\\nHe would say I had them kennelled, if he could see my big, closed sheds, with\\nthe sunny windows that my flock spend the winter in. I even house them during\\nthe bad fall storms. They can run out again. Indeed, I like to get them in, and\\nhave a snack of dry food, to break them in to it. They are in and out of those\\nsheds all winter. You must go in, Laura, and see the self-feeding racks. On\\nbright, winter days they get a run in the cornfields. Cold doesn't hurt sheep.\\nIt's the heavy rain that soaks their fleeces.\\n\\n\\\"With my way I seldom lose a sheep, and they're the most profitable stock I\\nhave. If I could not keep them, I think I'd give up farming. Last year my lambs\\nnetted me eight dollars each. The fleeces of the ewes average eight pounds, and\\nsell for two dollars each. That's something to brag of in these days, when so\\nmany are giving up the sheep industry.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How many sheep have you, uncle?\\\" asked Miss Laura.\\n\\n\\\"Only fifty, now. Twenty-five here and twenty-five down below in the orchard.\\nI've been selling a good many this spring.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"These sheep are larger than those in the orchard, aren't they?\\\" said Miss\\nLaura.\\n\\n\\\"Yes; I keep those few Southdowns for their fine quality. I don't make as much\\non them as I do on these Shropshires. For an all-around sheep I like the\\nShropshire. It's good for mutton, for wool, and for rearing lambs. There's a\\ngreat demand for mutton nowadays, all through our eastern cities. People want\\nmore and more of it. And it has to be tender, and juicy, and finely flavored, so\\na person has to be particular about the feed the sheep get.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't you hate to have these creatures killed that you have raised and tended\\nso carefully?\\\" said Miss Laura with a little shudder.\\n\\n\\\"I do,\\\" said her uncle; \\\"but never an animal goes off my place that I don't know\\njust how it's going to be put to death. None of your sending sheep to market\\nwith their legs tied together and jammed in a cart, and sweating and suffering\\nfor me. They've got to go standing comfortably on their legs, or go not at all.\\nAnd I'm going to know the butcher that kills my animals, that have been petted\\nlike children. I said to Davidson, over there in Hoytville, 'If I thought you\\nwould herd my sheep and lambs and calves together, and take them one by one in\\nsight of the rest, and stick your knife into them, or stun them, and have the\\nothers lowing, and bleating, and crying in their misery, this is the last\\nconsignment you would ever get from me.'\\n\\n\\\"He said, 'Wood, I don't like my business, but on the word of an honest man, my\\nbutchering is done as well as it can be. Come and see for yourself.'\\n\\n\\\"He took me to his slaughter-house, and though I didn't stay long, I saw enough\\nto convince me that he spoke the truth. He has different pens and sheds, and the\\nkilling is done as quietly as possible; the animals are taken in one by one, and\\nthough the others suspect what is going on, they can't see it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"These sheep are a long way from the house,\\\" said Miss Laura; \\\"don't the dogs\\nthat you were telling me about attack them?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No; for since I had that brush with Windham's dog, I've trained them to go and\\ncome with the cows. It's a queer thing, but cows that will run from a dog when\\nthey are alone will fight him if he meddles with their calves or the sheep.\\nThere's not a dog around that would dare to come into this pasture, for he knows\\nthe cows would be after him with lowered horns, and a business look in their\\neyes. The sheep in the orchard are safe enough, for they're near the house, and\\nif a strange dog came around, Joe would settle him, wouldn't you, Joe?\\\" and Mr.\\nWood looked behind the log at me.\\n\\nI got up and put my head on his arm, and he went on: \\\"By and by, the Southdowns\\nwill be changed up here, and the Shropshires will go down to the orchard. I like\\nto keep one flock under my fruit trees. You know there is an old proverb 'The\\nsheep has a golden hoof.' They save me the trouble of ploughing. I haven't\\nploughed my orchard for ten years, and don't expect to plough it for ten years\\nmore. Then your Aunt Hattie's hens are so obliging that they keep me from the\\nworry of finding ticks at shearing time. All the year round, I let them run\\namong the sheep, and they nab every tick they see.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How closely sheep bite,\\\" exclaimed Miss Laura, pointing to one that was\\nnibbling almost at his master's feet.\\n\\n\\\"Very close, and they eat a good many things that cows don't relish bitter\\nweeds, and briars and shrubs, and the young ferns that come up in the spring.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I wish I could get hold of one of those dear little lambs,\\\" said Miss Laura.\\n\\\"See that sweet little blackie back in the alders.
