When we make assumptions, we state them. Otherwise, we presume that the future could unfold in many directions.\\n\\nWe methodically piece together plausible scenarios, step by step, using systems theory and applied mathematics. We compile our findings in detailed reports, and release them for small sums. We like to explore questions that have not been asked, including questions that are controversial, heterodox, or untoward:\\n\\n- How can we design a feasible incentive structure for carbon sequestration that reduces moral hazard?\\n- What might graph theory tell us about behavior on an entirely unindexed internet?\\n- Is the term “Blackrock Communism” the most accurate descriptor for America’s political economy?\\n\\nWe imagine this as a new forum for future thought in which feedback from supporters is vital. Supporters can provide comments, ask questions, and suggest future report topics – steering the direction of our research which is technically owned by those who contribute. At certain intervals we will print books of the reports, which will also include previously unreleased material. All supporters receive a copy of the printed issues.\\n\\nIf you're into the concept straight away, please support the first issue of our service – Cope #01. We've set a goal in anticipation of ongoing engagement with the distributed community of supporters. For more details about the material, methods, and schedule keep reading below.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Cope #01](crowdfund://0x16333436511b5c8c60B251311e325B20F106293E?network=homestead)\\n\\nThe state of contemporary affairs has borne out a widening, often uncanny, set of directions. As the paths forward continue to branch, legacy institutions are losing their claims to legitimacy. While such institutions are resource-rich, their engagement with the future amounts to impoverished PR, or the maintenance of a holding pattern that prevents the rapid changes that need to happen.\\n\\nCope sees crowdfunding as an opportunity for young professional researchers to break from think tanks, universities, and strategy firms. We take the future too seriously to agree to institutional constraints. We intend  to break from legacy institutions, by  developing feedback from a distributed set of supporters who find our lines of inquiry valuable to their own paths. We dedicate our research to systematic studies of future outcomes and pathways toward them, lifting legacy constraints and establishing new norms for rigorous, open-source futurism.\\n\\n\\n\\n## *Cope #01 – Two Reports*\\n\\n## **The BauDAO – An OS for Urban Ownership** \\n-Pierce Myers\\n\\n\\nThe BauDAO is a collective-oriented, DAO-based software stack that restructures the paradigm of architectural funding, construction and ownership: A Building Information Modeling (BIM) system wrapped in a DAO governance system that leverages the affordances of programmable money. This report outlines a sequence of BauDAO phases that begins with a collectively crowdfunded building project and moves towards a novel vision for an urban operating system. The BauDAO paradigm includes many novel software mechanisms that 1) reduce the organizational complexity of fractional ownership of various urban assets, 2) enable multi-tier governance protocols for determining and modifying ‘program’, and 3) sharply decreasing capital barriers to ownership status by several orders of magnitude via smart contract crowdfunding mechanisms. Eventually, the BauDAO becomes an Operating System which is applicable to the breadth of architectural typologies, including residential buildings, creative collectives, schools, and co-ops. Lastly, we argue that architects are uniquely positioned to redefine these socio-economic parameters of ownership and governance (Form follows Finance) by removing parasitic developers and the rentier system. As opposed to commodity service providers, architects become fractional owners of built works alongside the distributed communities that own their architecture.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2cae884a-674b-4145-bb9e-0a87e35fcc97.png?height=2500&width=2500)\\n\\n\\n\\n## **The Problem of Memory in Digital Minds** \\n-James Douglas Boyd\\n\\nDigital minds will differ from human ones in that they will be both intelligent agents and products of the engineering designs of others. It may not always be easy for a digital mind to differentiate the aspects of its intelligence that are autonomous and those that are features of others’ designs. Memory is one such aspect. We consider an experiment that a digital mind can conduct and two measures that it can estimate for choosing among hypotheses regarding the origins of its memories.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e42a92f8-2e95-463b-b022-d32d4726fbba.png?height=1084&width=2388)\\n\\n\\n\\n### *Going Forward*\\nAs Cope grows, the issues will include more reports coming from a diversity of future thinkers. The content will become multimedia, and Splits will be automatically sent to thinkers or creators who inspire our work.\\n\\nOur output is high-volume and our turn-arounds are prompt. Successfully crowdfunded reports are released within two weeks, often sooner. \\n\\nWe imagine this as a new forum for future thought in which feedback from supporters is vital. Supporters can provide comments, ask questions, and suggest future report topics – steering the direction of our research which is technically owned by those who contribute, free for use as one wishes. At certain intervals we will print books of the reports, which will also include previously unreleased material. All supporters receive a copy of the printed issues. \\n\\n### **Thanks,** \\n### **-Cope**\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1620167546,\"title\":\"Crowdfunded Systems Research\",\"publication\":\"cope\"},\"digest\":\"OYqr-8izh8Y5JGnaLn_j6gfK6lHN36Fyy3zn1Bo3-nc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5E692Fe3d06414D75380604BA202c7d5ed94f219\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Oz2K-eXkzku1h-Ri9Wf8OSWPKtz1FcKcNbn0e8M_afY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZXx-8CaEz_Jsj7XVkH5YRuc6xqV0P5fbo4Bi_GKC3jA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"snx3mWZZBScpWRzbTR-lw8X7-fKb6zHPfu2ViNpcgjDKIcKKOB1PcVP05KleHpgcXgPFI4zlzHWCGDXk9dBm5A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5e43d388301d7d0435ef971ebbefd3dfd85cf3ec5ce452a38fd00a889b1b25195a462e09ad3298e3d3ca70d4288fafac5f22605a9a01a87efa2424b5a017c0631b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on cope.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Oz2K-eXkzku1h-Ri9Wf8OSWPKtz1FcKcNbn0e8M_afY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZXx-8CaEz_Jsj7XVkH5YRuc6xqV0P5fbo4Bi_GKC3jA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"GTSLTwaY78d11sLiWJHaiYR39UOeya4F9x58mHPVVWQ\"}"
