"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"In the field of financial services, derivatives are indispensable. Hedging, risk transfer, and even speculation all occupy a pivotal position in the financial market. As derivatives enter the encryption field, many derivatives agreements have emerged.\\n\\n\\\"We have been thinking about one thing, and that is how to let more users understand decentralized finance or finance in a general sense. This is why we entered the encryption field.\\\" This is the original intention of the 01 protocol team.\\n\\n01 protocol-a fully decentralized derivatives protocol, a project party that develops decentralized derivatives such as perpetual options and binary options on the Solana chain.\\n\\n\\\"01\\\" is the first place in any alphabetical order. Regarding why such a unique name was chosen, the team said: \\\"In the alphabetical ordering method, our name is quite meaningful. It cost us a lot to come up with this name. Tian. Initially when we were still designing the protocol, we created a fully functional binary option within a week, so we thought the name 01 was appropriate because 0 and 1 are binary numbers. Since we came up with this name, we I fell in love with it deeply without regret.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, choosing solana network has two major advantages-low fees and instant transactions.\\n\\nThe average operation on the Solana network is $0.00025. The decentralized nature of 01protocol makes each transaction easier to benefit; Solana can achieve more than 50,000 transactions per second, truly achieving lightning-fast transactions and settlements, while ether The current transaction volume of Fangfang in L1 is 17 transactions per second.\\n\\nAMM Binary Options\\n\\nBinary options are a conversion to traditional options.\\n\\nIn a binary option contract, a trader buys stocks at a fixed price and a fixed remuneration, and predicts whether a certain asset will be above or below a certain price at a certain time.\\n\\nIn binary options, only the direction of change in the price of the underlying asset needs to be considered, but the magnitude of the price change is not required.\\n\\nTo give a very simple example, if the price of an apple is now 5 yuan, the fruit farmer Li Erniu thinks that the apple will rise to 6 yuan next month (because the expiration date of the binary option is various, it can also be next week or any Time), so Li Erniu buys a binary option. When Apple rises above 6 yuan, he exercises the option and gains. After that, no matter how much Apple continues to rise, his return will be fixed. In traditional options, the greater the increase, the greater the return.\\n\\n01 protocol chose the latest AMM (Automatic Market Maker) model for the binary options project. AMM does not need a market maker, but relies on the participation of liquidity providers to expand the size of the liquidity pool and ensure fair prices .\\n\\nAlthough the capital efficiency of the AMM model is low and there is a certain risk of preemptive trading, for traditional binary options trading that is not liquid, the completely decentralized non-custodial feature of the AMM model undoubtedly injects new vitality. .\\n\\nAt the same time, regardless of the number of effective orders submitted to the trading platform, AMM enables traders to always obtain the quotation of assets, which also gives full play to the characteristics of binary options.\\n\\nPerpetual Options in the Order Book\\n\\nPerpetual options are options with no expiration date. They constantly readjust their execution price. Traders do not need to choose the execution price, choose the expiration time, or move their positions when they expire. In other words, it brings the power and efficiency of sustainability to the world of options.\\n\\n01 protocol The perpetual market is driven by a decentralized Serum order book and has a backup vAMM liquidity engine.\\n\\nCompared to AMM, the order book is still an ideal choice for liquid markets, displaying market prices and large orders.\\n\\nAt present, many decentralized protocols have completely abandoned the order book mode. For example, the deri protocol uses the AMM mode, and Order Swap uses the AMM mode as the main mode, and you can choose to switch the order book mode.\\n\\n01 protocol has full confidence in the combination of perpetual options and order books: \\\"In the field of encryption, the main obstacles to option products are the lack of liquidity and the inconcentration of trading volume, and perpetual options can solve these problems well. Serum order book The function makes building the protocol on the Solana chain like fish in water. It is with the Serum order book function that we can achieve centralized and empowered applications in a decentralized environment, which is unique in the DeFi field.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1634580820,\"title\":\"Order book?
