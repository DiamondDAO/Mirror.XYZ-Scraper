In the future, I‚Äôll probably write about others, but for today, we‚Äôll focus on what I know best.\\n\\nThat‚Äôs Index ü¶â\\n\\n## Set It and Forget It\\n\\nThe kind of crypto index tokens we‚Äôll be talking about today are **[TokenSets](https://www.tokensets.com/)** based on the Set Protocol. Unlike synthetic assets, TokenSets are, **[according to their documentation](https://docs.tokensets.com/)**:\\n\\n> *‚Ä¶fully collateralised baskets, which are represented as ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. These Set tokens act as structured products that represent the manager‚Äôs strategy, which others can replicate by simply holding the Set.*\\n\\nNow TokenSets are native to Ethereum, and understandably as that‚Äôs where the majority of tokens are, but the Set Protocol is also **[available on Polygon](https://medium.com/set-protocol/pushing-boundaries-in-asset-management-tokensets-polygon-44078331a692)**. And it seems like people are just waking up to this fact now üåÖ\\n\\nAs I showed in a recent **[YouTube video](https://youtu.be/wdJS7q6RVbc)**, my favourite index product, the **[Metaverse Index (MVI)](https://www.indexcoop.com/mvi)**, is now available on Polygon. And another favourite, the **[DeFi Pulse Index (DPI)](https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi)** has already become a staple of many Polygon users portfolios.\\n\\nThe main benefit of TokenSets is **cost**, but I mean that in more ways than one. But choosing Index Coop products, you can:\\n\\n* save on gas fees/swap fees/ or centralized exchange fees from having to buy multiple tokens\\n* save on gas fees/swap fees/ or centralized exchange fees from having to sell multiple tokens\\n* reduce your taxable events triggered through buying and selling.\\n\\nThat last one is the key. Selling tokens to rebalance or reduce exposure triggers taxable events, often capital gains or capital losses. Every one of these events will need to be calculated against your taxes, making for a headache, as well as potentially needless expenses üò™\\n\\nSave your money and save yourself a ton of work (your time has value!) üôå\\n\\nWith that out of the way, perhaps you‚Äôre wondering‚Ä¶\\n\\n## What is the Index Coop?\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*CxmKzQ1lTY_tk-ht.png)\\n\\nThe Index Coop is a **[decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/)** that oversees the creation and management of various investment products, each of which is based on the underlying TokenSets technology.\\n\\nHere‚Äôs how they **[describe their vision](https://www.indexcoop.com/about)**:\\n\\n> ***The Potential Of Next-gen Asset Management***\\\\* Within 27 years, the ETF industry has grown to $4 trillion in asset value as of 2019 in the US alone, and $6 trillion worldwide.\\\\*\\n>\\n> *As the crypto market matures, it too requires easy to use products that serve as benchmarks and entrypoints into crypto.*\\n>\\n> *We believe that if we overlay the opportunity in the crypto world, crypto ETFs have the potential to make up a significant portion of the crypto market, and we‚Äôre here to make that vision a reality.*\\n\\nFollowing along with the Index Coop and their most prominent members on twitter, we can see that they aim to produce products to fit every sector across all of crypto üëè\\n\\nHere are their current products:\\n\\n## [The DeFi Pulse Index (DPI)](https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi)\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*kmkWVxl6J0R8p6sC.png)\\n\\n> *The DeFi Pulse Index is a digital asset index designed to track tokens‚Äô performance within the Decentralized Finance industry.

You just need to find an exchange that holds them and purchase as much as you‚Äôd like.\\n\\nCurrently these products are only available on decentralized exchanges (by which I mean you can‚Äôt buy them on Coinbase), and I‚Äôm not sure that will change any time soon. So you‚Äôll want to purchase large amounts on Ethereum (to reduce the impact of the gas fees) ‚õΩÔ∏è or better still, purchase them on a Layer2 DEX, like Loopring, or on one of the multiple DEXs on Polygon that have liquidity.\\n\\nAnother option for larger investors on Ethereum could be to use TokenSets issuance to essentially mint new tokens. The main benefits here are a reduction in loss to slippage, and potentially lower gas fees. You can learn more about this process **[here](https://medium.com/indexcoop/buying-mvi-using-exchange-issuance-aaa87a9c3adb)**.\\n\\nIf you‚Äôd like to see how to purchase these products on exchange, as well as how to provide liquidity yourself so you can earn yield on your investment, check out these video tutorials:\\n\\n**[Providing Liquidity for the Data Economy Index on Sushiswap (Ethereum)](https://youtu.be/D4gBYc0Ox84)**\\n\\n**[Liquidity Mining with the Metaverse Index on Sushiswap (Polygon)](https://youtu.be/wdJS7q6RVbc)**\\n\\nSo you can HODL your Index products, you can provide liquidity, in same cases you can lend your tokens as collateral for loans. DPI, for example, is available as collateral on Aave (Ethereum) üëª\\n\\nThe only other thing to keep in mind is the streaming fee üí∏\\n\\nIf you‚Äôre familiar with ETF investing, you‚Äôre likely familiar with **[fund management fees](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/062113/mutual-funds-management-fees-vs-mer.asp)** (MER for example) that you pay for holding a fund. The same ‚Äî or similar at least ‚Äî is true with TokenSets.\\n\\nHere‚Äôs **[what the documentation says](https://docs.tokensets.com/)**:\\n\\n> ***Streaming Fees***\\n>\\n> *The streaming fees are fees that are paid out to Set managers over time based on the entire market cap of the Set (e.g. 2% of market cap over 1 year). This incentivizes managers to increase the value of their Sets over time for their users.*\\n>\\n> *The streaming fee is calculated linearly over the lifespan of the Set. For example, if a Set has a 2% streaming fee and 6 months has passed, 1% of streaming fees would have been collected.*\\n\\nNothing is free, and as I mentioned above, you‚Äôre already saving a lot by going this route. And besides the best part of Index Coop products, versus traditional financial products is **transparency üîç**\\n\\n## Governance\\n\\nWhile Index Coop avoids use of the term DAO on their website, instead referring to themselves as a Decentralized Autonomous Asset Manager (DAAM?) they do have the same characteristics as a DAO. If you‚Äôre confused by what I‚Äôm saying right now, have a read through my post: **[I Joined a DAO and I Like It](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/thumbsupfinance/i-joined-dao-i-like)**.\\n\\nEffectively, those who hold the INDEX token are voting shareholders of the protocol üó≥\\n\\n> *INDEX is an ERC-20 token deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It has a capped maximum supply of 10,000,000 tokens. INDEX is used to vote in changes to the Index Coop including but not limited to: ‚Ä¢ Smart contract upgrades to the Index Coop ‚Ä¢ How to allocate the Index Coop treasury ‚Ä¢ Add new Index Coop products*\\n\\nCapped supply, clear release schedule, voting rights. Not bad. And the performance ain‚Äôt bad either üëå\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*jML4iWhORnsjN8L3.png)\\n\\nSo that‚Äôs that. I hope I‚Äôve been able to show why you might consider TokenSets (specifically the sets managed by Index Coop) as part of your crypto investing portfolio. They play a big role in mine. As always, this is not official investment advice, and you should do your own research.\\n\\nLet me know in the comments what you think of the concept of TokenSets and if any of these products appeal to you, and until next time üëã\\n\\nThumbs Up\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nDid you enjoy this content?
