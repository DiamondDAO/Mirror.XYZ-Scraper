There are a total of 48 designs, two of which will be auctioned daily. \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*The NFTs have already been minted and we will sell them through our own Solpreme marketplace. Owners of verified Solpreme NFTs will be able to sell their NFTs on the Solpreme market and will also be able to sell them in an auction sale! This mechanism allows us to be independent and ensures that the owners of Solpreme NFTs will never have to pay listing fees on the Solpreme marketplace.

It will all happen very quickly”.\",\"timestamp\":1639132433,\"title\":\"SolPunks Partners With Solana's First Virtual NFT Fashion Brand\"},\"digest\":\"Iuz17RPw_R1v-TF97Gi-EV3xwoKD0LqtZ50V5ObqnV0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3DAF6990D34a3f4289E69A11a2116D0Ec465Dbe2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"KbVMwgbKp_MeuQy59xlr0KHvzD3wkHN8Y4qYdFUWW8s\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"t07HXOLjdAGi8DlNG666p9kWXCVe2lERzq7jxIdfoGA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"FaCvAVyUjH0CLU-KwVNNLUGLvKgzTwJP6ob357COnnGUbx6P4cN4jPcONdPF_pILU1F5QgZlXkWj_B_imdDaJQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9315cd0b3aec7eca4ced23d77776318aa74b29978109cc7ae84e49aacbac8c255abeeee3c1fb5edaf49e0727d8dbfd7d91ea71493e4cd1bbfe3b016669e14b451c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"KbVMwgbKp_MeuQy59xlr0KHvzD3wkHN8Y4qYdFUWW8s\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"t07HXOLjdAGi8DlNG666p9kWXCVe2lERzq7jxIdfoGA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"M15qtLRjyBZt8hW3p1OThtwQJbu3riDNejwdn84_Sb0\"}"
