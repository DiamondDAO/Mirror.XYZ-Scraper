"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### What is RomeDao?\\n\\nThe RomeDao is a community project build by a core team of devs, researchers and community builders from the OlympusDao Community.  It plans to expand the OlympusDao ecosystem into the Kusama/Polkadot ecosystems while experimenting with new bond types and fresh mechanism design.\\n\\n### What is Kusama/ Polkadot ecosystems? \\n\\nKusama is a scalable network of specialized blockchains built using Substrate and nearly the same codebase as Polkadot. The network is an experimental development environment for teams who want to move fast and innovate on Kusama, or prepare for deployment on Polkadot.\\n\\n### What is MoonRiver? What is MVOR? \\n\\nMoonriver is a canary network of Moonbeam. Other projects will be able to test their code base on Moonriver, and only then deploy to Moonbeam. The Moonriver has already been launched and is being traded, because it has a faster process of obtaining a parachain slot. Moonriver is a full Ethereum-like environment and works with industry-standard Ethereum tools, DApps, and protocols. \\n\\nMoonriver (MOVR) is the utility token of the Moonriver Network, Moonbeam’s Kusama deployment that serves as a “CanaryNet” to the Moonbeam Network.\\n\\n### Steps to get ready for RomeDao\\n\\n1. Set up a Metamask wallet. \\n\\n   [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/)\\n\\n2. Use Chainlist to search and add Moonriver chain information into MetaMask.\\n\\n   [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org/)\\n\\n3. Two ways to prepare the Fund for RomeDao.\\n   1. Get MOVR from any exchange and send the fund to your MetaMask address.\\n      1. Exchanges support MOVR are: KuCoin, Kraken, Gate.io and BKEX.  \\n\\n         [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moonriver#markets](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moonriver#markets)\\n\\n   2. Bridge Fund from other chains\\n      * Go to RomeDao supported DEX Solarbeam. \\n\\n        [https://app.solarbeam.io/](https://app.solarbeam.io/)\\n\\n      * Go to Bridge page to bridge your asset from other Chains to Moonriver.\\n        1. Supported Chains and Asset Type\\n           1. ETH: DAI,ETH,USDC,USDT,WBTC and so on\\n           2. BSC: BNB, BUSD, LAIKA,BIFI\\n           3. Avalanche: AVAX and others through RelayChain bridge\\n           4. Polygon: Matic and others through RelayChain bridge\\n           5. Fantom: WFTM, SPELL, MIM through RelayChain bridge\\n           6. Polkadot: DOT through RelayChain bridge\\n        2. For ETH, BSC, the bridge fee is 0, but user still have to pay the transactions fee in native token. (For BSC, normally it toke around 5-15 mins to complete the bridge). User can check History Tab for bridge status. \\n        3. Get the $MVOR faucet for first transactions. Go to Bridge tab => Choose Faucet\\n        4. User can go swap your bridged asset to any RomeDao supported Asset\",\"timestamp\":1635664409,\"title\":\"How to get ready to participate RomeDao in MoonRiver (Community share, not official )\"},\"digest\":\"RZtulUgKYeOTL-GFb4ax_dpcofbxtSgyIDSpBbiIiQs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x241e25c9d15b5E7FB007B5E028C4ce8694893870\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Wat5qhlR56L67FlC9WLxU6Kfs8wahaXUmBF7RUmuUxo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"v214oOg5qUo_U1xq-1gehZcLALut1-jRzW9kUyqlEkQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"44TsN45Ma2sMv-XrR7xRA8UWtmMlU_DZIvuuR1UTtIbHu_m9TCuK0ngX-CDDYacZD8BOnp8bB5MLcQRHsxTwqQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4c07bfb83bb1ad1afe7b18dfdb90a84f5a9cd1402bc422ddd797c8e3e89fa6e75419a4a06482af12188218194966e635dce7cc5edf8a1b2a59ea6fb944a66bd51c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Wat5qhlR56L67FlC9WLxU6Kfs8wahaXUmBF7RUmuUxo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"v214oOg5qUo_U1xq-1gehZcLALut1-jRzW9kUyqlEkQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"RZtulUgKYeOTL-GFb4ax_dpcofbxtSgyIDSpBbiIiQs\"}"
