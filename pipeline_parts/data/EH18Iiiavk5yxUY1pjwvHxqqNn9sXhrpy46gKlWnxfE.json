Here, all being\\nimmaterial spirits, no physical injury can befall any of us; and\\nsince no one wants anything that any one else can give, we have\\nno opportunity of doing anything for each other.  You see we\\nneither eat nor sleep, neither can any of us again know physical\\npain or death, nor can we comfort one another, for every one\\nknows the truth about himself and every one else, and we read one\\nanother's thoughts as an open book.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you,\\\" asked Bearwarden, \\\"not eat at all?\\n\\n\\\"We absorb vitality in a sense,\\\" replied the spirit.  \\\"As the sun\\ncombines certain substances into food for mortals, it also\\nproduces molecular vibration and charges the air with magnetism\\nand electricity, which we absorb without effort.  In fact, there\\nis a faint pleasure in the absorption of this strength, when, in\\nmagnetic disturbances, there is an unusual amount of immortal\\nfood.  Should we try to resist it, there would eventually be a\\ngreater pressure without than within, and we should assimilate\\ninvoluntarily.  We are part of the intangible universe, and can\\nfeel no hunger that is not instantly appeased, neither can we\\never more know thirst.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why,\\\" asked Cortlandt reverently, \\\" did the angel with the sword\\nof flame drive Adam from the Tree of Life, since with his soul he\\nhad received that which could never die?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That was part of the mercy of God,\\\" the shade replied; \\\"for\\nimmortality could be enjoyed but meagrely on earth, where natural\\nlimitations are so abrupt.  And know this, ye who are something\\nof chemists, that had Adam eaten of that substance called fruit,\\nhe would have lived in the flesh to this day, and would have been\\nof all men the most unhappy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Will the Fountain of Youth ever be discovered?\\\" asked Cortlandt.\\n\\n\\\"That substances exist,\\\" replied the spirit, \\\"that render it\\nimpossible for the germs of old age and decay to lodge in the\\nbody, I know; in fact, it would be a break in the continuity and\\nbalance of Nature did they not; but I believe their discovery\\nwill be coincident with Christ's second visible advent on earth.\\nYou are, however, only on the shore of the ocean of knowledge,\\nand, by continuing to advance in geometric ratio, will soon be\\nable to retain your mortal bodies till the average longevity\\nexceeds Methuselah's; but, except for more opportunities of doing\\ngood, or setting a longer example to your fellows by your lives,\\nwhere would be the gain?\\n\\n\\\"I now see how what appeared to me while I lived on earth\\ninsignificant incidents, were the acts of God, and that what I\\nthought injustice or misfortune was but evidence of his wisdom\\nand love; for we know that not a sparrow falleth without God, and\\nthat the hairs of our heads are numbered.  Every act of kindness\\nor unselfishness on my part, also, stands out like a golden\\nletter or a white stone, and gives me unspeakable comfort.  At\\nthe last judgment, and in eternity following, we shall have very\\ndifferent but just as real bodies as those that we possessed in\\nthe flesh.  The dead at the last trump will rise clothed in them,\\nand at that time the souls in paradise will receive them also.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I wonder,\\\" thought Ayrault, \\\"on which hand we shall be placed in\\nthat last day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The classification is now going on,\\\" said the spirit, answering\\nhis thought, \\\"and I know that in the final judgment each\\nindividual will range himself automatically on his proper side.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do tell me,\\\" said Ayrault, \\\"how you were able to answer my\\nthought.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I see the vibrations of the grey matter of your brain as plainly\\nas the movements of your lips\\\"; in fact, I see the thoughts in\\nthe embryonic state taking shape.\\\"\\n\\nWhen their meal was ready they sat down, Ayrault placing the\\nspirit on his right, with Cortlandt on his left, and having\\nBearwarden opposite.  On this occasion their chief had given them\\na particularly good dinner, but the spirit took only a slice of\\nmeat and a glass of claret.\\n\\n\\\"Won't you tell us the story of your life,\\\" said Ayrault to the\\nspirit, \\\"and your experiences since your death?  They would be of\\ntremendous interest to us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I was a bishop in one of the Atlantic States,\\\" replied the\\nspirit gravely, \\\"and died shortly before the civil war.  People\\ncame from other cities to hear my sermons, and the biographical\\nwriters have honoured my memory by saying that I was a great man.\\nI was contemporaneous with Daniel Webster and Henry Clay.\\nShortly after I reached threescore and ten, according to earthly\\nyears, I caught what I considered only a slight cold, for I had\\nalways had good health, but it became pneumonia.  My friends,\\nchildren, and grandchildren came to see me, and all seemed going\\nwell, when, without warning, my physician told me I had but a few\\nhours to live.  I could scarcely believe my ears; and though, as\\na Churchman, I had ministered to others and had always tried to\\nlead a good life, I was greatly shocked.  I suddenly remembered\\nall the things I had left undone and all the things I intended to\\ndo, and the old saying, 'Hell is paved with good intentions,'\\ncrossed my mind very forcibly.  In less than an hour I saw the\\nphysician was right; I grew weaker and my pulse fluttered, but my\\nmind remained clear.  I prayed to my Creator with all my soul, 'O\\nspare me a little, that I may recover my strength, before I go\\nhence, and be no more seen.'  As if for an answer, the thought\\ncrossed my brain, 'Set thine house in order, for thou shalt not\\nlive, but die.'  I then called my children and made disposition\\nof such of my property and personal effects as were not covered\\nby my will.  I also gave to each the advice that my experience\\nhad shown me he or she needed.  Then came another wave of remorse\\nand regret, and again an intense longing to pray; but along with\\nthe thought of sins and neglected duties came also the memory of\\nthe honest efforts I had made to obey my conscience, and these\\nwere like rifts of sunshine during a storm.  These thoughts, and\\nthe blessed promises of religion I had so often preached in the\\nchurches of my diocese, were an indescribable comfort, and saved\\nme from the depths of blank despair.  Finally my breathing became\\nlaboured, I had sharp spasms of pain, and my pulse almost\\nstopped.  I felt that I was dying, and my sight grew dim.  The\\ncrisis and climax of life were at hand.  'Oh!' I thought, with\\nthe philosophers and sages, 'is it to this end I lived?  The\\nflower appears, briefly blooms amid troublous toil, and is gone;\\nmy body returns to its primordial dust, and my works are buried\\nin oblivion.  The paths of life and glory lead but to the grave.'\\nMy soul was filled with conflicting thoughts, and for a moment\\neven my faith seemed at a low ebb.  I could hear my children's\\nstifled sobs, and my darling wife shed silent tears.  The thought\\nof parting from them gave me the bitterest wrench.  With my\\nfleeting breath I gasped these words, 'That mercy I showed\\nothers, that show thou me.'  The darkened room grew darker, and\\nafter that I died.  In my sleep I seemed to dream.  All about\\nwere refined and heavenly flowers, while the most delightful\\nsounds and perfumes filled the air.  Gradually the vision became\\nmore distinct, and I experienced an indescribable feeling of\\npeace and repose.  I passed through fields and scenes I had never\\nseen before, while every place was filled with an all-pervading\\nlight.  Sometimes I seemed to be miles in air; countless suns and\\ntheir planets shone, and dazzled my eyes, while no\\nbird-of-paradise was as happy or free as I.  Gradually it came to\\nme that I was awake, and that it was no dream.  Then I remembered\\nmy last moments, and perceived that I had died.  Death had\\nbrought freedom, my work in the flesh was ended, I was indeed\\nalive.\\n\\n\\\"'O Death, where is thy sting?  O Grave, where is thy victory?'\\nIn my dying moments I had forgotten what I had so often\\npreached--'Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened\\nexcept it die.'  In a moment my life lay before me like a valley\\nor an open page.  All along its paths and waysides I saw the\\nlittle seeds of word and deed that I had sown extending and\\nbearing fruit forever for good or evil.  I then saw things as\\nthey were, and realized the faultiness of my former conclusions,\\nbased as they had been on the incomplete knowledge obtained\\nthrough embryonic senses.  I also saw the Divine purpose in life\\nas the design in a piece of tapestry, whereas before I had seen\\nbut the wrong side.  It is not till we have lost the life in the\\nflesh that we realize its dignity and value, for every hour gives\\nus opportunities of helping or elevating some human being-- it\\nmay be ourselves--of doing something in His service.\\n\\n\\\"Now that time is past, the books are closed, and we can do\\nnothing further ourselves to alter our status for eternity,\\nhowever much we may wish to.  It is on this account, and not\\nmerely to save you from death, which in itself is nothing, that I\\nnow tell you to run to the Callisto, seal the doors hermetically,\\nand come not forth till a sudden rush of air that you will see on\\nthe trees has passed.  A gust in which even birds drop dead, if\\nthey are unable to escape, will be here when you reach safety.\\nDo not delay to take this food, and eat none of it when you\\nreturn, for it will be filled with poisonous germs.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How can we find you? \\\" asked Ayrault, grasping his hand.  \\\"You\\nmust not leave us till we know how we can see you again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Think hard and steadfastly of me, you three,\\\" replied the\\nspirit, \\\"if you want me, and I shall feel your thought\\\"; saying\\nwhich, he vanished before their eyes, and the three friends ran\\nto the Callisto.\\n\\n```\\n                      CHAPTER III.\\n\\n                 DOUBTS AND PHILOSOPHY.\\n```\\n\\nOn reaching it, they climbed the ladder leading to the\\nsecond-story opening, and entering through this, they closed the\\ndoor, screwing it tightly in place.\\n\\n\\\"Now,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"we can see what changes, if any, this\\nwonderful gust will effect.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He made no strictures on our senses, such as they are,\\\" said\\nBearwarden, \\\"but implied that evolution would be carried much\\nfurther in us, from which I suppose we may infer that it has not\\nyet gone far.  I wish we had recorked those brandy peaches, for\\nnow they will be filled with poisonous germs.  I wonder if our\\nshady friend could not tell us of an antiseptic with which they\\nmight be treated?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Those fellows,\\\" thought Ayrault, who had climbed to the dome,\\nfrom which he had an extended view, \\\"would jeer at an angel,\\nwhile the deference they showed the spirit seems, as usual, to\\nhave been merely superficial.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let us note,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"that the spirit thermometer\\noutside has fallen several degrees since we entered, though, from\\nthe time taken, I should not say that the sudden change would be\\none of temperature.\\\"\\n\\nJust then they saw a number of birds, which had been resting in a\\nclump of trees, take flight suddenly; but they fell to the ground\\nbefore they had risen far, and were dashed to pieces.  In another\\nmoment the trees began to bend and sway before the storm; and as\\nthey gazed, the colour of the leaves turned from green and purple\\nto orange and red.  The wind blew off many of these, and they\\nwere carried along by the gusts, or fluttered to the ground,\\nwhich was soon strewed with them.  It was a typical autumnal\\nscene.  Presently the wind shifted, and this was followed by a\\ncold shower of rain.\\n\\n\\\"I think the worst is over,\\\" said Bearwarden.  \\\"The Sailor's\\nGuide says:\\n\\n```\\n       'When the rain's before the wind,\\n        Halliards, sheets, and braces mind;\\n        When the wind's before the rain,\\n        Soon you can make sail again.'\\n```\\n\\nDoubtless that will hold good here.\\\"\\n\\nThis proved to be correct; and, after a repetition of the\\nprecautions they had taken on their arrival on the planet in\\nregard to the inhalability of the air, they again sallied forth.\\nThey left their magazine shot-guns, taking instead the\\ndouble-barrelled kind, on account of the rapidity with which this\\nenabled them to fire the second barrel after the first, and threw\\naway the water that had collected in the bucket, out of respect\\nto the spirit's warning.  They noticed a pungent odour, and\\ndecided to remain on high ground, since they had observed that\\nthe birds, in their effort to escape, had flown almost vertically\\ninto the air.  On reaching the grove in which they had seen the\\nstorm, they found their table and everything on it exactly as\\nthey had left it.  Bearwarden threw out the brandy peaches on the\\nground, exclaiming that it was a shame to lose such good\\npreserves, and they proceeded on their walk.  They passed\\nhundreds of dead birds, and on reaching the edge of the toadstool\\nvalley were not a little surprised to find that every toadstool\\nhad disappeared.\\n\\n\\\"I wonder,\\\" said the doctor, \\\"if there can be any connection\\nbetween the phenomenon of the disappearance of those toadstools\\nand the death of the birds?  We could easily discover it if they\\nhad eaten them, or if in any other way the plants could have\\nentered their bodies; but I see no way in which that can have\\nhappened.\\\"\\n\\nResolving to investigate carefully any other fungi they might\\nsee, they resumed their march.  The cold, distant-looking sun,\\napparently about the size of an orange, was near the horizon.\\nSaturn's rotation on its axis occupying only ten hours and\\nfourteen minutes, being but a few minutes longer than Jupiter's,\\nthey knew it would soon be night.  Finding a place on a range of\\nhills sheltered by rocks and a clump of trees of the evergreen\\nspecies, they arranged themselves as comfortably as possible, ate\\nsome of the sandwiches they had brought, lighted their pipes, and\\nwatched the dying day.  Here were no fire-flies to light the\\ndarkening minutes, nor singing flowers to lull them to sleep with\\ntheir song but six of the eight moons, each at a different phase,\\nand with varied brightness, bathed the landscape in their pale,\\ncold rays; while far above them, like a huge rainbow, stretched\\nthe great rings in effulgent sheets, reaching thousands of miles\\ninto space, and flooded everything with their silvery light.\\n\\n\\\"How poor a place compared with this,\\\" they thought to\\nthemselves, \\\"is our world!\\\" and Ayrault wished that his soul was\\nalready free; while the dead leaves rustling in the gentle\\nbreeze, and the nightwinds, sighing among the trees, seemed to\\necho his thought.  Far above their heads, and in the vastness of\\nspace, the well-known stars and constellations, notwithstanding\\nthe enormous distance they had now come, looked absolutely\\nunchanged, and seemed to them emblematic of tranquillity and\\neternal repose.  The days were changed by their shortness, and by\\nthe apparent loss of power in the sun; and the nights, as if in\\ncompensation, were magnificently illuminated by the numerous\\nmoons and splendid rings, though neither rings nor satellites\\nshone with as strong a light as the terrestrial moon.  But in\\nnothing outside of the solar system was there any change; and\\ncould AEneas's Palinurus, or one of Philip of Macedon's\\nshepherds, be brought to life here, he would see exactly the same\\nstars in the same positions; and, did he not know of his own\\ndeath or of the lapse of time, he might suppose, so far as the\\nheavens were affected, that he had but fallen asleep, or had just\\nclosed his eyes.\\n\\n\\\"I have always regretted,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"that I was not born a\\nthousand years later.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Were it not,\\\" added Ayrault, \\\"that our earth is the vestibule to\\nspace, and for the opportunities it opens, I should rather never\\nhave lived, for life in itself is unsatisfying.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You fellows are too indefinite and abstract for me,\\\" said\\nBearwarden.  \\\"I like something tangible and concrete.  The\\nutilitarianism of the twentieth century, by which I live,\\nparadoxical though it may seem, would be out of place in space,\\nunless we can colonize the other planets, and improve their\\narrangements and axes.\\\"\\n\\nMixed with Ayrault's philosophical and metaphysical thoughts were\\nthe memories of his sweetheart at Vassar, and he longed, more\\nthan his companions, for the spirit's return, that he might ask\\nhim if perchance he could tell him aught of her, and whether her\\nthoughts were then of him.\\n\\nFinally, worn out by the fatigue and excitement of the day, they\\nset the protection-wires, more from force of habit than because\\nthey feared molestation and, rolling themselves in their\\nblankets--for the night was cold--were soon fast asleep;\\nAyrault's last thought having been of his fiancee, Cortlandt's of\\nthe question he wished to ask the spirit, and Bearwarden's of the\\nprogress of his Company in the work of straightening the\\nterrestrial axis.  Thus they slept seven hundred and ninety\\nmillion miles beyond their earth's orbit, and more than eight\\nhundred million from the place where the earth was then.  While\\nthey lay unconscious, the clouds above them froze, and before\\nmorning there was a fall of snow that covered the ground and them\\nas they lay upon it.  Soon three white mounds were all that\\nmarked their presence, and the cranes and eagles, rising from\\ntheir roosts in response to the coming day, looked unconcernedly\\nat all that was human that they had ever seen.  Finally, wakened\\nby the resounding cries of these birds, Bearwarden and Cortlandt\\narose, and meeting Ayrault, who had already risen, mistook the\\nsnowy form before them for the spirit, and thinking the dead\\nbishop had revisited them, they were preparing to welcome him,\\nand to propound the questions they had formulated, when Ayrault's\\nfamiliar voice showed them their mistake.\\n\\n\\\"Seeing your white figures,\\\" said he, \\\"rise apparently in\\nresponse to those loud calls, reminded me of what the spirit told\\nus of the last day, and of the awakening and resurrection of the\\ndead.\\\"\\n\\nThe scene was indeed weird.  The east, already streaked with the\\nrays of the rising far-away sun, and the pale moons nearing the\\nhorizon in the west, seemed connected by the huge bow of light.\\nThe snow on the dark evergreens produced a contrast of colour,\\nwhile the other trees raised their almost bare and whitened\\nbranches against the sky, as though in supplication to the\\nmysterious rings, which cast their light upon them and on the\\nground.  As they gazed, however, the rings became grey, the moons\\ndisappeared, and another day began.  Feeling sure the snow must\\nhave cleared the air of any deleterious substances it contained\\nthe day before, they descended into the neighbouring valley,\\nwhich, having a southerly exposure, was warm in comparison with\\nthe hills.  As they walked they disturbed a number of small\\nrodents, which quickly ran away and disappeared in their holes.\\n\\n\\\"Though we have seen none of the huge creatures here,\\\" said\\nCortlandt, \\\"that were so plentiful on Jupiter, these burrowers\\nbelong to a distinctly higher scale than those we found there,\\nfrom which I take it we may infer that the evolution of the\\nanimal kingdom has advanced further on this planet than on\\nJupiter, which is just what we have a right to expect; for\\nSaturn, in addition to being the smaller and therefore more\\nmatured of the two, has doubtless had a longer individual\\nexistence, being the farther from the sun.\\\"\\n\\nNotwithstanding the cold of the night, the flowers, especially\\nthe lilies, were as beautiful as ever, which surprised them not a\\nlittle, until, on examining them closely, they found that the\\nstems and veins in the leaves were fluted, and therefore elastic,\\nso that, should the sap freeze, it could expand without bursting\\nthe cells, thereby enabling the flowers to withstand a short\\nfrost.  They noticed that many of the curiously shaped birds they\\nsaw at a distance from time to time were able to move with great\\nrapidity along the ground, and had about concluded that they must\\nhave four legs, being similar to winged squirrels, when a long,\\nlow quadruped, about twenty-five feet from nostrils to tail,\\nwhich they were endeavouring to stalk, suddenly spread two pairs\\nof wings, flapping the four at once, and then soared off at great\\nspeed.\\n\\n\\\"I hope we can get one of those, or at least his photograph,\\\"\\nsaid Cortlandt.\\n\\n\\\"If they go in pairs,\\\" said Bearwarden, \\\"we may find the\\ncompanion near.\\\"\\n\\nAt that moment another great winged lizard, considerably larger\\nthan the first, rose with a snort, not twenty yards on their\\nleft.  Cortlandt, who was a good shot with a gun at short range,\\nimmediately raised his twelve-bore and fired both barrels at the\\nmonster; but the double-B shots had no more disabling effect than\\nif they had been number eights.  They, however, excited the\\ncreature's ire; for, sweeping around quickly, it made straight\\nfor Cortlandt, breathing at him when near, and almost\\noverpowering the three men with the malodorous, poisonous cloud\\nit exhaled.  Instantly Bearwarden fired several revolver bullets\\ndown its throat, while Ayrault pulled both barrels almost\\nsimultaneously, with the muzzles but a few inches from its side.\\nIn this case the initial velocity of the heavy buckshot was so\\ngreat, and they were still so close together, that they\\npenetrated the leathery hide, tearing a large hole.  With a roar\\nthe wounded monster beat a retreat, first almost prostrating them\\nwith another blast of its awful breath.\\n\\n\\\"It would take a stronger light than we get here,\\\" said\\nBearwarden, \\\"to impress a negative through that haze.  I think,\\\"\\nhe continued, \\\"I know a trick that will do the business, if we\\nsee any more of these dragons.\\\"  Saying which, he withdrew the\\ncartridges from his gun, and with his hunting-knife cut the tough\\npaper shell nearly through between the wads separating the powder\\nfrom the shot, drawing his knife entirely around.\\n\\n\\\"Now,\\\" said he, \\\"when I fire those, the entire forward end of the\\ncartridge will go out, keeping the fifteen buckshot together like\\na slug, and with such penetration that it will go through a\\ntwo-inch plank.  It is a trick I learned from hunters, and,\\nunless your guns are choke-bore, in which case it might burst the\\nbarrel, I advise you to follow suit.\\\"\\n\\nFinding they had brought straight-bored guns, they arranged their\\ncartridges similarly, and set out in the direction in which the\\nwinged lizards or dragons had gone.\\n\\n```\\n                       CHAPTER IV.\\n\\n              A PROVIDENTIAL INTERVENTION.\\n```\\n\\nThe valley narrowed as they advanced, the banks rising gently on\\nboth sides.  Both dragons had flown straight to a grove of tall,\\nspreading trees.  On coming near to this, they noticed a faint\\nsmell like that of the dragon, and also like the trace they found\\nin the air on leaving the Callisto the day before, after they had\\nsought safety within it.  Soon it almost knocked them down.\\n\\n\\\"We must get to windward,\\\" said Cortlandt.  \\\"I already feel\\nfaint, and believe those dragons could kill a man by breathing on\\nhim.\\\"\\n\\nAccordingly, they skirted around the grove, and having made a\\nquarter circle--for they did not wish the dragons to wind\\nthem--again drew nearer.  Tree after tree was passed, and finally\\nthey saw an open space twelve or fifteen acres in area at the\\ncentre of the grove, when they were arrested by a curious sound\\nof munching.  Peering among the trunks of the huge trees, they\\nadvanced cautiously, but stopped aghast.  In the opening were at\\nleast a hundred dragons devouring the toadstools with which the\\nground was covered.  Many of them were thirty to forty feet long,\\nwith huge and terribly long, sharp claws, and jaws armed with\\ngleaming batteries of teeth.  Though they had evidently lungs,\\nand the claws and mouth of an animal, they reminded the observers\\nin many respects of insects enormously exaggerated, for their\\nwings, composed of a sort of transparent scale, were small, and\\nmoved, as they had already seen, at far greater speed than those\\nof a bird.  Their projecting eyes were also set rigidly in their\\nheads instead of turning, and consisted of a number of flat\\nsurfaces or facets, like a fly's eye, so that they could see\\nbackward and all around, each facet seeing anything the rays from\\nwhich came at right angles to its surface.  This beautiful grove\\nwas doubtless their feeding-ground, and, as such, was likely to\\nbe visited by many more.  Concluding it would be wise to let\\ntheir wounded game escape, the three men were about to retreat,\\nhaving found it difficult to breathe the air even at that\\ndistance from the monsters, when the wounded dragon that they had\\nobserved moving about in a very restless manner, and evidently\\nsuffering a good deal from the effect of its wounds, espied them,\\nand, with a roar that made the echoes ring, started towards them\\nslowly along the ground, followed by the entire herd, the nearer\\nof which now also saw them.  Seeing that their lives were in\\ndanger, the hunters quickly regained the open, and then stretched\\ntheir legs against the wind.  The dragons came through the trees\\non the ground, and then, raising themselves by their wings, the\\nwhole swarm, snorting, and darkening the air with their deadly\\nbreath, made straight for the men, who by comparison looked like\\nLilliputians.  With the slug from his right barrel Bearwarden\\nended the wounded dragon's career by shooting him through the\\nhead, and with his left laid low the one following.  Ayrault also\\nkilled two huge monsters, and Cortlandt killed one and wounded\\nanother.  Their supply of prepared cartridges was then exhausted,\\nand they fell back on their revolvers and ineffective spreading\\nshot.  Resolved to sell their lives dearly, they retreated,\\nkeeping their backs to the wind, with the poisonous dragons in\\nfront.  But the breeze was very slight, and they were being\\nrapidly blinded and asphyxiated by the loathsome fumes, and\\ndeafened by the hideous roaring and snapping of the dragons'\\njaws.  Realizing that they could not much longer reply to the\\ndiabolical host with lead, they believed their last hour had\\ncome, when the ground on which they were making their last stand\\nshook, there was a rending of rocks and a rush of imprisoned\\nsteam that drowned even the dragons' roar, and they were\\nseparated from them by a long fissure and a wall of smoke and\\nvapour.  Struggling back from the edge of the chasm, they fell\\nupon the ground, and then for the first time fully realized that\\nthe earthquake had saved them, for the dragons could not come\\nacross the opening, and would not venture to fly through the\\nsmoke and steam.  When they recovered somewhat from the shock,\\nthey cut a number of cartridges in the same way that they had\\nprepared those that had done them such good service, and kept one\\nbarrel of each gun loaded with that kind.\\n\\n\\\"We may thank Providence,\\\" said Bearwarden, \\\"for that escape.  I\\nhope we shall have no more such close calls.\\\"\\n\\nWith a parting glance at the chasm that had saved their lives,\\nand from which a cloud still arose, they turned slightly to the\\nright of their former course and climbed the gently rising bank.\\nWhen near the top, being tired of their exciting experiences,\\nthey sat down to rest.  The ground all about them was covered\\nwith mushrooms, white on top and pink underneath.\\n\\n\\\"This is a wonderful place for fungi,\\\" said Ayrault.  \\\"Here,\\ndoubtless, we shall be safe from the dragons, for they seemed to\\nprefer the toadstools.\\\"  As he lay on the ground he watched one\\nparticular mushroom that seemed to grow before his eyes.\\nSuddenly, as he looked, it vanished.  Dumfounded at this\\nunmistakable manifestation of the phenomenon they thought they\\nhad seen on landing, he called his companions, and, choosing\\nanother mushroom, the three watched it closely.  Presently,\\nwithout the least noise or commotion, that also disappeared,\\nleaving no trace, and the same fate befell a number of others.\\nAt a certain point of their development they vanished as\\ncompletely as a bubble of air coming to the surface of water,\\nexcept that they caused no ripple, leaving merely a small\\ndepression where they had stood.\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Bearwarden, \\\"in all my travels I never have seen\\nanything like this.  If I were at a sleight-of-hand performance,\\nand the prestidigitateur, after doing that, asked for my theory,\\nI should say, 'I give it up.'  How is it with you, doctor?\\\" he\\nasked, addressing Cortlandt.\\n\\n\\\"There must be an explanation,\\\" replied Cortlandt, \\\"only we do\\nnot know the natural law to which the phenomenon is subject,\\nhaving had no experience with it on earth.  We know that all\\nsubstances can be converted into gases, and that all gases can be\\nreduced to liquids, and even solids, by the application of\\npressure and cold.  If there is any way by which the visible\\nsubstance of these fungi can be converted into its invisible\\ngases, as water into oxygen and hydrogen, what we have seen can\\nbe logically explained.
