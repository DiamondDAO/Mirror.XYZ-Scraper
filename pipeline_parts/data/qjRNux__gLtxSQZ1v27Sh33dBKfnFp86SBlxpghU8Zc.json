"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The usual video game is play-to-pay, like <<World of Warcraft>>, <<Fantasy Westward Journey>> and <<Genshin Impact>>, they are all expensive, because if you play more, you want to pay more, and the mode in traditional game is players spend time and money, they get pleasure and gratification back. So for the game developers, they control economic system in game, they decide how to set in-game parameter, their centralized server save the role and game equipment of players, which means you pay for the sword, clothes, shoes to make your role be better, but they still in others’ pocket(centralized server). So here comes Blockchain games. Blockchain game is play-to-earn, like <<Crypto Blades>>, <<Axie Infinity>> and <<My Defi Pet>>, they are all free, or cost a little to start. \\n\\nUnlike traditional games you need to pay first, then you can get much pleasure back in games, and finally you are willing to spend more time to play, in blockchain games, the core is you play more, you get paid more,  the pleasure comes from both the money you get and the game itself, so here is a balance, how to decide the rate between gameplay and finance part is the most important thing in blockchain game design. While we know blockchain is costly, especially Ethereum, so most of blockchain games are running in centralized server, and only the game asset transaction is built on-chain, in the form of NFTs. Here NFT is just a voucher of your in-game asset, if you sell the NFT(voucher) to other players, the game server will monitor the NFT transaction and change the owner of game asset. Build game marketplace on-chain takes a bunch of advantages, like player can easily find his sword in his wallet,  he can sell it on marketplace very quickly. And if you want to play a new game, you can sell your old assets and buy new game assets, or even you can directly transform the same assets from old game to the new one, that’s nearly impossible in traditional game field. One of the most representative game in blockchain is <<The Six Dragons>>, supported by Enjin platform, <<The Six Dragons>> is an open-world role playing game, you can mint your game asset by yourself, and once you have minted your asset, you can immediately find your items in you Enjin wallet, you can also sell it if you like.\\n\\nSo as I said before, blockchain game has a total different business model, the core of blockchain game is how to find the balance between game part and finance part, for existed blockchain games, they are not as good as AAA games, while they can also attract millions of players, like Axie Infinity, they can earn as much as <<Arena of Valor>> in one day. I’m not saying blockchain game will replace traditional game in the future, but it will have a huge potential in the future game world. If you want to know more about blockchain games, I would recommend <<illuvium>>, <<Star Atlas>> and <<Town Star>>, some of them are in progress, I think these games will be the next generation of blockchain games.\",\"timestamp\":1637584441,\"title\":\"Blockchain Games\"},\"digest\":\"c-Lsc0v7m88p6r_g9aYzTuPKA5bzUFZfg5z1fFbjbBY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xCd505A0fCE6FDc7A813440f308BA29c435c05eA0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4PfREFM-sJcsb36mJzKnPzCHMYMLYtv1Ye_obbnaxNE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1sFuVxJOAZ9g2bHlsRVFCUcyLylKQY2qTZoCplYYy5A\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"E6cQ2PNyiek4Un5BuaheVHyEwNy1ybHO1_SZEbflmpArTGL98eoporysT1WC-10khvU5GGIfA4blOBfiymMabw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8d9ce7f244ee092ccd1fa2701faae3156f0c8952638ccc6394502e0f7de91f4030bf145c7e7dc120bc1fe1b56ab0195ae888f39f8637837773287fc2324213c11c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4PfREFM-sJcsb36mJzKnPzCHMYMLYtv1Ye_obbnaxNE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1sFuVxJOAZ9g2bHlsRVFCUcyLylKQY2qTZoCplYYy5A\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"c-Lsc0v7m88p6r_g9aYzTuPKA5bzUFZfg5z1fFbjbBY\"}"
