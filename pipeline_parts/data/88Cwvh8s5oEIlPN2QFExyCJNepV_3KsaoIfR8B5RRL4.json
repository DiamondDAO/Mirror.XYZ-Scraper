"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"We are thrilled to announce that SphinxUp, an NFT financial infrastructure asset pricing protocol​​, and CyberConnect have partnered up to build toward their shared vision of Web3, a decentralized and fair internet where users control their own data, identity, and asset. \\n\\nThis partnership will bring more utilities to CyberConnect while its social graph protocol will be utilized by Eyesfi, one of SphinxUp's products, to establish social relationships and introduce a decentralized IM system into the future NFT community.\\n\\n> “As an important component of the Web3, the NFT ecology represented by SphinxUP will establish a longer-term, more in-depth partnership with the social ecology represented by Cyberconnect. We believe that in the near future we will be able to create numerous incredible innovations with massive adoption together in this space”.  \\n>\\n> – CoFounder of SphinxUp \\n\\n### About Sphinx UP\\n\\nSphinxUP aims to improve the efficiency and liquidity of the NFT ecosystem via a Web3 product matrix that includes a data analytics platform (Eyesfi.com), NFT asset valuations, NFT asset management, aggregated trading protocols, and liquidity solutions.\\n\\n[Website](https://sphinxup.com) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SphinxUp) | [Discord](http://discord.gg/WqtPaXTxTw) \\n\\n### About CyberConnect\\n\\nWe here at CyberConnect are building the first social graph protocol that democratizes social connections. Aligning with the thesis of Web3, we return the ownership of social graph data back to users themselves.\\n\\nThe CyberConnect Protocol is fully decentralized, allowing blockchain users to update and access their own social graphs. A user-friendly API will be built on top of CyberConnect Protocol and application developers can easily integrate and access the whole user-generated social graphs on Web3.\\n\\n[Website](http://cyberconnect.me) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CyberConnectHQ) | [Discord](https://cyberconnect.fyi/discord) | [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/cyberlab.eth) | [Developer Doc](https://cyberconnect.fyi/docs)\",\"timestamp\":1640149207,\"title\":\"SphinxUp and CyberConnect Have Established a Strategic Partnership\"},\"digest\":\"ayXHEPP16WxxCJK7sh3qQrEdctdCfVwXkh3-NmJIlJg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x148D59faF10b52063071eDdf4Aaf63A395f2d41c\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-pvCuz5j9LM0ZlWKELufu_oldiVR28vgZJg-x97-ov4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4rzbh_pb_ae_vSjpbt7FM0IvMDs1k8vMoaZ2APiU0Pc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"9Xilp9sCZogfasbQNx0Xl1-07NTqhv1G37OUD3hHLaRcmjflQmB8VI0OkxtQ-Zq552Ut9Ca9FGDsWp2anP1EUA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2bc11dafd20f81ad522de1187c41f9a91e5aaa9d7b42ed078bfb0fea2e81f83c6108bf916bd3fa0c5092e02e9435fd4ea496fd1071b22abab5e64cde8867ad171b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-pvCuz5j9LM0ZlWKELufu_oldiVR28vgZJg-x97-ov4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4rzbh_pb_ae_vSjpbt7FM0IvMDs1k8vMoaZ2APiU0Pc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ayXHEPP16WxxCJK7sh3qQrEdctdCfVwXkh3-NmJIlJg\"}"
