"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Markets are saturating, lead buyers are consolidating into fewer, larger players, and big brands are bringing digital marketing talent in-house.\\n\\nThe tides have changed. Social media marketing is not the 'disruptive' niche it once was. It's mainstream, and the moat surrounding this lucrative playground continues to rise.\\n\\nHowever while one door closes, another begins to open. In this article I will reveal where a new and much greater opportunity for independent marketers lies, and how to immediately capitalise on this disruption.\\n\\n## The good ol' days\\n\\nHistorically lead generation has been a relative walk in the park.\\n\\nAnyone with a laptop could google how to setup a Facebook ad campaign, draft some ad copy and throw in a few stock images. Facebook would do the hard work by automating campaign optimisations and CPMs were dirt cheap. Best of all, once you had a winning ad set you didn't even need to touch it.\\n\\nIncumbents didn’t understand social media but it was disrupting their legacy marketing. These firms wanted exposure but didn’t want to go all in to bring it in-house.\\n\\nThese factors gave rise to a wave of independent marketing companies who stepped in to capitalise.\\n\\nToday’s story is very different however.\\n\\n## Problems for independent marketers\\n\\nThe same factors that once presented lead generators huge opportunities, have now become their biggest threats.\\n\\n**Low barriers to entry.** Very low barriers to entry have caused an over saturation in the market. More people want to start an independent business and marketing is a common pick. This means it’s more difficult to get your voice heard when prospecting new clients.\\n\\n**Reduced margins.** Social media advertising is no longer new and competition continues to rise. This means your ads have to compete with bigger brands who can invest more to refine and optimise ad copy. It also drives up your CPMs and CPCs.\\n\\n**In-house marketing.** Companies are bringing marketing in house. After years of outsourcing, firms are now familiar and confident with the opportunities social media and digital ad platforms offer. Now proven, the upfront investment of internal digital marketing is more easily justified.\\n\\nBut not all is lost.\\n\\n## Where the opportunity lies\\n\\nHow often do you click on a competitor’s ad, maybe read through the landing page. If you’re really interested you submit your name and email to proceed to the next step of the service. This is marketing research 101. Everyone does it.\\n\\nBut how often do you follow up to answer the phone when called, or continue online to make a payment, and see the service right to the end acting as a real ‘mystery shopper’. Start to finish. I bet almost never. However this is exactly where the opportunity lies.\\n\\nFor many service providers, what you will find is a mess of repetitive online forms, clunky customer portals, unwanted harassment from call centres and/or insecure sensitive data capture mechanisms. The list goes on. All of which make you question the competence of the service provider you're interacting with.\\n\\n## Inequality of optimisation\\n\\nLead generators pour hours into optimising ad targeting, copy and landing pages in order to capture site visitors’ contact details. After this point in the customer journey however, they would rarely offer their expertise in optimisation. But why would they? What else would you expect when the most common payment method is payment on lead capture (PPL). This misaligned incentive mechanism leaves lead buyers, who attempted to outsource lead gen, stuck optimising their back end processes internally. However the customer journey optimisation process requires a very similar skill set to the skill set of a lead generator, therefore if the company had to outsource the lead generation in the first place, chances are they do not have the prerequisite skills inhouse.\\n\\n![Traditional funnel optimisation strategy](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QtiGHxm1XZtZ2KO2dJUbF.png?height=400&width=1000)\\n\\nIn this diagram, Steps C onwards represent items required to be carried out in order for the customer to complete their purchase. These may include: Answering general questions, verifying identity, e-signing agreements, uploading documents, making a purchase, managing purchases and/or accessing upsells.\\n\\nThis mismatch in process optimisation has left the door open for a plethora of inefficiencies. Combine this with Covid-19 and you’ll find firms are currently scrambling to adopt software that streamlines customer acquisition and retention.\\n\\nThis is the area being disrupted today and presents a huge opportunity for creatives to come in and optimise the entire client journey.\\n\\n## The new wave of opportunity\\n\\nIn an ideal world a lead generator would be able to pitch and present an end to end customer acquisition solution for a particular product or service. This would allow the independent marketer to make optimisations based on conversion metrics to the entire customer journey, not only the ads and landing page.\\n\\nOne problem. This would require the lead buyer to relinquish significant control of the entire customer journey, as opposed to a single landing page. In addition, the lead buyer needs access to make modifications based on internal factors like what the service entails or external factors like compliance requirements.\\n\\nThough, if a solution like this could be offered then showing this shiny new funnel to a prospective lead buyer would immediately stand your independent marketing firm out from the crowd.\\n\\nSounds like a lot of code though, right? Luckily, at Claims Gate we've written all the code for you.
