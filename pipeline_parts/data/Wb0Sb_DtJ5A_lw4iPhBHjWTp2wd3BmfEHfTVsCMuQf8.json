"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*The 1559 NFT Series was an experiment to celebrate the EIP-1559 Contributors which launched on July 21st, 2021.

We were delighted by the overwhelming support we received from the Ethereum community. All in all, the 22 contributing teams or individuals received:\\n\\n+ **32 ETH** from the 1/1 Patron NFT Auction (thank you leorad.eth!)\\n+ **243 ETH** from minting 1559 Supporter NFTs\\n+ **3 ETH** directly donated to the Split contract\\n\\n= **278 ETH** ($635,688!!!)\\n\\nThe contributor addresses within the Split contract are now able to claim their portion of the ETH generated by the project. *View [here on Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/splits/0x2510C039cc3b061D79e564b38836dA87e31b342f).*\\n\\nBeyond the financial success of the project, we were thrilled to receive comments from several community members saying this was their first NFT purchase, and that they were excited to support an initiative they had been following for a long time. The success of this experiment validates that [retroactive funding campaigns](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) can be an effective way to fund public goods infrastructure on Ethereum.\\n\\nWe hope these NFTs live on as collective memory of the efforts put forward over past two years. Some participants have already started to display the artwork in [digital](https://twitter.com/MonoMesa/status/1418334386815213572) [frames](https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1420214285544812545)!\\n\\nOn behalf of the entire team and the EIP-1559 Contributors, **THANK YOU** for helping this exceed our wildest expectations. Whether you minting a Supporter NFT, bid on the Patron NFT, donated directly, or simply helped raise awareness, your participation was crucial. This will not be the last NFT you see from us for a major Ethereum milestone. üëÄ\\n\\nNow, we wait for the London upgrade block [12,965,000](https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/12965000) to hit mainnet.\\n\\n‚ù§Ô∏è Stateful Works, [_kitteh](https://twitter.com/_kittehdesign), Tim Beiko, & Trent Van Epps\\n\\n---\\n\\n*If you're interested in other projects like this, check out the [**Beacon Book**](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/Y1ED9RorG9OvEUXD8NBmXgYhSVhjj8H537-I2SZJkYA): a multimedia project (digital text, mintable NFTs, + physical book) featuring the perspectives of 46 Eth2 contributors that worked on the Beacon Chain launch.*\",\"timestamp\":1627499589,\"title\":\"Wrap up: 1559 NFT Series\",\"publication\":\"stateful\"},\"digest\":\"Dx0BjlcmMzcdPYFKYoMcoAz3GyrreCPe9nahzkcFWrw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xc57c5aE582708e619Ec1BA7513480b2e7540935f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"G7cdPy-lJA5zYUiOI5Rfop2DIuYHGOPs4UxivzF3RIk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"C3IQlfk_DWTxgWsQLGO6WouPdvcfBymhnypbw9nPxZc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"bg02tS9CiYfYk3Hi_VuPe0j4UzaDOmXrQ3GeXtuCjTfI4fnF6A4qTLau0PFr9uB7MIyGbrebxCFC_4qusT-WbA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x6fa3e9a43fd1dc0bb5555dfecb93e90a576faa4dd45bd8ec2daef88a2745e75a0a806084f4653adcc1a01f85ccda5cf167d7591c6c027ff1915ef6964c5d50c91b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on stateful.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"G7cdPy-lJA5zYUiOI5Rfop2DIuYHGOPs4UxivzF3RIk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"C3IQlfk_DWTxgWsQLGO6WouPdvcfBymhnypbw9nPxZc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"qpqvDbajGArdteKMSEkEUA3bFGVWQhJXG2Pnajm5hqA\"}"
