"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"THE D-8.XYZ / BY Josip Vlah\\n\\nImagine the next few months within the space. What do we see?  \\n\\nMusic being owned by artists, projects being governed by communities, profile pictures envisioned with our self-expression and fashion wearables resembling our true inner self. The space is changing, corporations have some catching up to do, while some are working towards the madness of the future others tend to stand in place and view from the sidelines uncertain about things to come. / Fuck the sidelines. \\n\\nToday, we are only going to touch one of the subjects. Untouched by creativity and with an idea to push the boundaries of physical, digital within the modern-era of fashion industry. \\n\\nThis will personally serve me as a lite non-technical paper of possibilities and imagination. \\n\\nFruition of the transparency, art, drugs & technology. \\n\\n![THE D-8.XYZ / Definition of Freedom - Designed by hellowlrd.eth](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4jr97YP2UdWmbKd9M0y_Z.png?height=1014&width=1881)\\n\\n*Expression of your true self.* \\n\\nFrom the early days fashion enabled us to express ourselves if a way we show our beliefs and passion within the physical worlds. We saw that throughout the advent of streetwear and the hip-hop scene in the late 70’s and 80’s and this continues to this day. \\n\\nIn the past few years we see this transformation happening within the virtual worlds. Profile picture avatars are all over the twitter, even LinkedIn and introduction of NFT’s enabled us to express ourselves and our beliefs through art, fashion and culture in a ever-changing space. \\n\\n*Merge between the digital & physical.* Let’s call this Phygital. \\n\\n![THE D-8.XYZ / Definition of Crypto - Designed by hellowlrd.eth](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5jZUjO_5rjk0weZu4Ceql.png?height=737&width=1357)\\n\\nExpression of yourself within the digital and physical worlds as well as a bridge of the tangible with non-tangible assets and products is defining the new generation of fashion. \\n\\nThis bridge between the digital and physical worlds is what I am working towards. Merging and closing the gaps of normal and venturing into unknown lands fueled by the technology, creativity and innovation. \\n\\nImagine being able to own a digital (NFT) clothing piece which can be used throughout the metaverse worlds such as Decentraland, Sandbox and furthermore being able to forge this piece to a physical copy connected with augmented reality. Sounds pretty fucked, but hear me out. \\n\\n![THE D-8.XYZ / Crypto Sneakers Concept / Hellowlrd.eth & MXTC](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xQIlhCbHJ_TXwG7i_PW1u.png?height=1080&width=1920)\\n\\n*Worn within the Metaverse* \\n\\nThe metaverse fashion seems pretty understandable. You buy an NFT piece, be that a clothing garment, dress or a regular based hoodie / sneaker. The 3D Mesh of the piece directly corresponds with the meshes used within the metaverse worlds. For example: Voxel-Based (Sandbox), Low-Poly (Decentraland), Sprite-Sheets (Upcoming Kanaria Skyreach) etc… \\n\\nUsers and holders are then able to wear those pieces with their avatars throughout the virtual worlds. Those pieces also serve as NFT’s on their own so users are able to trade, hold, sell them within the markets. \\n\\n*Worn within the Physical* \\n\\nSome of the pieces which are able to be worn within the virtual worlds can also be redeemed for the physical copy.
