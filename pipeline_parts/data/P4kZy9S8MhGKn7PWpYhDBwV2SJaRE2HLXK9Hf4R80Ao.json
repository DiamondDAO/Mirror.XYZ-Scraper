"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**This post outlines the final component of the Beacon Book project, an open Crowdfund for 100 physical Genesis Edition prints.**\\n\\n---\\n\\nStateful Works began in August 2020 with a simple thesis: maintainers of Public Goods should be celebrated! And not just through monetary rewards: we should also be creating artifacts and traditions that accrue cultural capital.\\n\\nThe Beacon Book was our first project along this path: **a piece of Ethereum history** featuring profiles, reflections, and stories of the contributors that brought the Eth2 Beacon Chain to life. This book is a snapshot of sentiment from around the launch in December 2020, neatly packaged into a 5.5x8.5\\\" (140x215mm) soft cover book. In line with our founding ethos, any ETH generated from the project goes [directly](https://mirror.xyz/splits/0x4Eb0D2b356da831aC613aEf9EC3D705d78DFd197) to project contributors, which includes the Eth2 researchers.\\n\\nThe Beacon Book is your chance to contribute directly to the Ethereum story. Own part of its past, and a key to the future.\\n\\nThe project includes three main components:\\n\\n- The text itself: [Read here](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/Y1ED9RorG9OvEUXD8NBmXgYhSVhjj8H537-I2SZJkYA)\\n- mintable NFTs of book graphics: [Mint Here](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/Y1ED9RorG9OvEUXD8NBmXgYhSVhjj8H537-I2SZJkYA)\\n- 100 physical Genesis Editions **↓ excerpts and crowdfund below ↓**\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/19464179-8493-4f3e-837b-292981b97486.png?height=2500&width=4000)\\n\\n*back and front covers*\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d4141985-ce60-4d8d-9da8-9b136454566c.png?height=2500&width=3000)\\n\\n*pages 19-20*\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d6efc87d-590a-43e1-afef-4743e1c5934e.png?height=2500&width=3000)\\n\\n*\\\"Traditions\\\" NFT, pages 35-36*\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/49f3aedc-f5f1-4a42-91c7-9723d0ace474.png?height=2500&width=3000)\\n\\n*pages 27-28*\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/332b986c-c12f-47ff-af03-2391f3378892.png?height=2500&width=3000)\\n\\n*pages 55-56*\\n\\nCheck out a complete breakdown of the imagery in [Beacon Book: Graphics and Narratives](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/jOFMjyRtgT0KPbeWgysDp1HM4mQnlWKeQA3HQ2SJpbA).\\n\\n## Crowdfunding 100 Physical Genesis Editions\\n\\nWe will be using the crowdfund leaderboard to simulate an auction and select the winners of 100 Genesis Editions. While there may be future prints, this edition is notable for being the inaugural print run. Please read the following information before participating:\\n\\n1. The crowdfund will last until **August 3rd, 16:00 UTC.**\\n2. The top 100 contributors will receive physical Genesis Edition books 1-100, according to their ranking in the crowdfund leaderboard below. In addition, their copy of the book will have the final rank, eg. 1/100, inscribed on the pages 1-2, the provenance page ([see here](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/jOFMjyRtgT0KPbeWgysDp1HM4mQnlWKeQA3HQ2SJpbA)). Finally, the top 100 contributors will also receive a unique NFT featuring the the cover of the book (see below).\\n3. **Contributions are final and non-refundable**, so make sure to bid strategically. Your ranking will likely change over the course of the crowdfund, and you can even be pushed out of the top 100, therefore ineligible for the physical book. If there are equally sized contributions under and over the Top 100 threshold, we will bias towards earlier sent transactions. All ETH contributions go to the project contributors, including the featured Eth2 developers.\\n3. Our recommended minimum bid for a book is **.05 ETH (~$100)**. This considers the cost of production over the past 9 months / +500 hours, the effort and time put in by Eth2 contributors, the work of the artists, printing, packaging, shipping, and various other costs. \\n4. Please be aware in order to receive their copy, the top 100 contributors will need to supply a **street address**. After delivery confirmation, your address will be deleted. \\n5. Once you have submitted a contribution, please remember to complete the email form below. This signed message proves you participated in the crowdfund, and lets us get in touch for shipping info if you are in the top 100.\\n4. All crowdfund participants will also get a commemorative token ($STATEFUL), regardless of their final ranking. This represents your participation in a novel cultural Ethereum event as a thank you from the team!\\n5.
