"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Web3 interfaces + tools\\n\\nThey look similar to web2, but underneath they are fundamentally different. web3 apps are completely decentralized, they are not hosted by a single organization, instead, they are hosted by node servers all over the world. Every time a user enters a website or interacts with them in any way, their system downloads the necessary blockchain information from these node servers so it can function properly.\\n\\n* [MetaMask](https://app.jarvis.ai/MetaMask.io): a Google Chrome, Firefox, and mobile application that acts as a browser and wallet for Ethereum and Web3 apps. It also provides the capability to import your account into other Ethereum browsers.\\n* [Discord](https://discord.com/): Think slack on steroids, discord servers are the communication method of choice with communities. It makes it easy for people to talk about their projects through voice or chat and is allows for utilities to be built on top of it. Discord servers, for example, utilize [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/) to grant access based on whether or not people hold particular tokens. Note: it's not an actual web3 application[ yet](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/123752/discord-ceo-hints-at-integrating-ethereum-via-wallets-such-as-metamask), but a primary interface to web3 communities.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Let's go on a web3 the journey\\n\\nI learn by doing, it's helped me on this web3 journey, so here is a web3 treasure trail of sorts, that touches on all the concepts laid out in this document.\\n\\nThis journey helps you to buy Ethereum, put it in a crypto-wallet, and then use that crypto to buy an ENS domain.\\n\\n1. [Purchase Ethereum ETH through Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/buy-ethereum)\\n2. [Download and install the Metamask wallet](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531-Getting-started-with-MetaMask)\\n3. [Important: Read this article on crypto wallet security](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404722782107-User-guide-Secret-Recovery-Phrase-password-and-private-keys) (Remember, wallets are user-controlled, non-custodial products.\\n4. [Transfer the ETH that you purchased on Coinbase to your Metamask wallet](https://medium.com/verasity/how-to-transfer-ethereum-to-metamask-wallet-security-67ff0a415c88)\\n5. Goto [https://app.ens.domains](https://app.ens.domains/) and click on \\\"Connect\\\" which will sign you into the ENS application with Metamask.\\n6. [Follow this guide if you get lost. ](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/step-by-step-guide-to-registering-a-eth-name-on-the-new-ens-registrar-c07d3ab9d6a6)That's it, if successful you know OWN your name, that is, it's not rented but your ENS domain name has been written to the Ethereum blockchain for ever... (see note about setting primary name)\\n7. Now to see your registration, [we're going to sign-in to OpenSea, an NFT platform](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/360061676254-How-do-I-create-an-OpenSea-account-) (from step 3 onwards)\\n\\nAfter registering click on your profile image top right, and then click on profile, you should see your ENS domain name in your profile. Opensea knows you own this domain because you logged in using your Metamask wallet.\\n\\nIDK this is pretty cool, I'm going to try and put together more demos in the future - until then go play with web3, search, dive into Twitter it's all there.\\n\\n### And thereâ€™s more\\n\\nOther cool things you can explore by signing into web3 applications with your Metamask Wallet\\n\\n* [Cyber](https://oncyber.io/) is a virtual gallery platform. Every element of the gallery is an NFT. All of the artwork on the walls, statues, or music must be possessed and stored in the wallet that connects to the gallery owner. When you log in with your Metamask it knows which NFTs you own allowing you to [build your own gallery](https://oncyber.io/create).\\n* This is a cool messaging application that allows you to chat to any other user via their Ethereum address, go to [Our spaces](https://www.ourspaces.xyz/) and log in with Metamask, then chat with any other user, the application and login are decentralized.\\n* You can log in with most of the major NFT platforms via your Wallet, like [Rarible](https://rarible.com/), [Opensea](https://opensea.io/) as well as play-to-earn games like [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/) and Metaverse platforms like [Decentraland.](https://decentraland.org/)\\n* Finally this platform, [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) is a content publishing, NFT minting, crowdfunding platform, i'd encourage you to dive in deeper here,\\n\\nHappy Exploring, share your favs with me at [@timnotjim](https://twitter.com/timnotjim)  ðŸŽ‰\\n\\n**PS : Note on Setting primary name on ENS.Domains**\\n\\nYou can set the domain name you just published as your primary ENS domain. To do this you need to write to the Ethereum blockchain, Iâ€™ve heard that this process is a little confusing. Follow the steps but do not repeat the steps, every time you do this you will be charged Gas fees, give it a few moments to process.\",\"timestamp\":1637574591,\"title\":\"web3, an interactive journey.\"},\"digest\":\"h3gnu5CynI6JjXgDuysy-PuP2GWwsl-a6pB0HDmH0Ss\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7cbC330Bf0B9479D320170B21F8ca9e88399FC16\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nBV9L3CO783sA1rJRz3g1pXCu0mu4jfGpFLUPKlYhFw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DhPR7z7h4Qg90fkNH5faTd6ZX33bYq-ES-fsOD3uBug\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"rjEasG9z-riIjsxBNvQbpzSSCbg3n6f8ZAAzU-aOWWPTCsw1XI5QVekZCf0fNx3JQ98mmr0cNrTCjtOjNqk6jA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0bc3ae2a74a69f46730f211aab63cd2c191ab8e92061307387ef7db41e5de2646b1b3ab416e6c36efeb7cc778dd35038dd2eea207aec32bcbb3ae10402c403131c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nBV9L3CO783sA1rJRz3g1pXCu0mu4jfGpFLUPKlYhFw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DhPR7z7h4Qg90fkNH5faTd6ZX33bYq-ES-fsOD3uBug\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jz3dirqESnIPiWhXs_ZpGz5ruesBwzByp-_XIixavGY\"}"
