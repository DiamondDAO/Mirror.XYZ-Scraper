"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Compared with other applications on the chain, the game pays more attention to the silky feel of the experience.\\n\\nHowever, Ethereum, the king of the public chain, still hinders the development of various applications due to problems such as high gas fees and chain congestion.\\n\\nAlthough there are more and more other high-efficiency and low-consumption public chains, the resources of ecological users and developers are not as good as Ethereum. It is not good for application traffic growth and development and construction, especially the phenomenon-level GameFi application.\\n\\nIf the plan is to develop in the direction of a big ecology and platform, if the performance problem of the basic public chain is not solved, it will become a shackle.\\n\\nAs the upsurge of the meta universe struck again, GameFi ushered in a new round of enthusiastic pursuit. Next, we will take a look at the major public chains.\\n\\n## GameFi public chain at a glance\\n\\n**Ethereum**\\n\\nEven if it is deeply affected by high gas fees, Ethereum has always been the main position of chain game projects. The well-known Axie Infinity and The Sandbox are also based on Ethereum chain game projects.\\n\\nOf course, in order to solve the gas fee, Ethereum chain game projects mostly use side chains. For example, Axie uses Ronin and Illuvium uses Immutable X.\\n\\nDappRadar statistics show that there are a total of 520 chain games on ETH, among which Axie Infinity, Illuvium, TheSandbox, Cryptokitties, etc. have attracted much attention.\\n\\n**BSC Smart Chain**\\n\\nIn terms of chain games, BSC can be said to be \\\"the newcomer first.\\\" According to DappRadar data, there are a total of 239 BSC on-chain games.\\n\\nThe top-ranked projects on the 30-day trading volume list of BSC on-chain travels mainly include Mobox, My DeFi Pet, X World Games, BunnyPark, Faraland, CryptoBlades, etc. in its official ecosystem.\\n\\n**WAX**\\n\\nWAX is a public chain focusing on game props and digital collections. The homepage of its official website \\\"unhumbly\\\" writes the words King of NFT (\\\"NFT King\\\").\\n\\nThe WAX ​​mainnet was officially launched in June 2019. Based on the EOS transformation, it follows the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism to support the high throughput required by the game and attract chain game developers.\\n\\nWAX's theoretical TPS is more than 3000, and its Gas fee is much lower than ETH.\\n\\n**Solana**\\n\\nAs an efficient and full-potential public chain, the layout of Solana ecology in chain games involves collections, card games, sandboxes, sports, development, and so on.\\n\\nIn early November, Solana Ventures announced that it had cooperated with FTX/Lightspeed Venture Partners to launch a $100 million special fund to invest in studios and startups that make chain games in the Solana ecosystem.\\n\\nIn addition, Solana Ventures has also recently invested in Genopets (a Move-to-Earn game built on Solana, which collects players' sports data in the real world to issue corresponding rewards), MixMob and other chain games.\\n\\n**Polygon**\\n\\nPolygon (MATIC) is an L2 scaling solution built on Ethereum. Its goal is to eliminate some of the most important barriers to Dapp adoption: speed, scalability, and availability.\\n\\nAs a rising star, Polygon focuses on the field of chain games/NFT.\\n\\nIn July of this year, Polygon launched blockchain games (Polygon Gaming Studio) and NFT Studio (Polygon NFT Studio).\\n\\n**Polygon Studios has three core goals:**\\n\\n* Establish Polygon's leading position in the field of decentralized games;\\n* Create a brand that can attract developers and investors into its NFT ecosystem;\\n* Position Polygon as the best platform to transition to Web3.0.\\n\\nAccording to the latest data from DappRadar, there are 69 games on the Polygon chain.\\n\\n**OKexChain**\\n\\nAs a public chain developed by one of the leading exchanges, OKexChain is also looking forward to the construction of chain games.\\n\\nAccording to data from DappRadar, there are currently 9 types of OKexChain on-chain games, of which Celestial (which expands social and multi-chain universe modes on the basis of Play To Earn) and Blade Warrior (the first meta-universe game on OEC) are worth paying attention to.\\n\\n**Flow**\\n\\nAs the development team behind crypto cat, NBA Top Shot and other popular chain games, Dapper Labs built a blockchain platform specially for games. Flow has attracted many areas including collections, DeFi, games and sports with its advantages of fast and low-cost transactions. .\\n\\nJapanese IT giant Mixi also announced recently that it will launch chain games and NFTs on the Flow blockchain.\\n\\nIn addition to its own advantages, Flow is also actively expanding its own meta-universe world.\\n\\nIn October of this year, Flow and Dapper Labs each applied for 108 Lands to establish a virtual headquarters in Matrix World (a 3D programmable multi-chain meta-universe).\\n\\n**Phantom**\\n\\nFantom is a highly scalable blockchain platform that supports smart contracts based on DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph Distributed Database) technology and is suitable for DeFi, cryptodApp, and enterprise solutions.\\n\\nIt intends to use the Lachesis protocol to break through the restrictions set by the \\\"old\\\" blockchain. The biggest difference from other public chains is the change in transaction data storage methods brought about by DAG technology.\\n\\nFantom provides EVM compatibility with cross-chain functions. Currently, more than 2,200 smart contracts have been deployed on Fantom.\\n\\n**KardiaChain**\\n\\nAs the first smart public chain in Southeast Asia and Vietnam, KardiaChain is actively attracting developers, funds, and users. Its security, user experience (cost, speed), ecological application and other comprehensive factors have become the first choice for most chain games.\\n\\nThe encryption products that can be used in the ardiaChain ecosystem are continuously increasing. There are already a large number of DeFi and NFT projects such as THETAN ARENA, MY DEFI PET, DEFILY, BECOSWAP, SLEEPEARN FINANCE, and a large number of NFT and GameFi projects on the way.\\n\\nIn the GameFi ecosystem, the addition of more links and more roles in the Kardiachain ecosystem also makes the entire ecosystem more stable.\\n\\nAfter a large number of GameFi projects have poured into KardiaChain, September may usher in the large-scale implementation of these projects.\\n\\n**Top studio**\\n\\nA well-known \\\"publisher\\\" and \\\"manufacturer\\\" can not only ensure a great game, but also allow the game to benefit from the studio's resources.\\n\\nThe top studios mainly include SkyMavis, Animoca Brands, DapperLabs, etc.\\n\\n## Summarize\\n\\nWith the recent explosion of Gamefi (chain games), it is not difficult to find that even in the recent unstable market conditions, there are still excellent Gamefi projects entering our field of vision.\\n\\nTherefore, there will be a wave of enthusiasm for chain games. Following the trend, the profit effect is very large.\",\"timestamp\":1639486002,\"title\":\"Panoramic interpretation: GameFi public chain at a glance\"},\"digest\":\"CPAG6HXLGHPTehbS0qIRVCIgRo19r92Prd3BIfeGVV0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5Ac913aA6ba580d1788Af9d0d9b80D3c530fCB70\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MapFNWiSsoSsSQDPzX6XZ95bzXBp1VwfmqvrZj11HNg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"BUDdJOVP_4EbJ1l-RMygPAb_oOrR2wCyJRUjHjifpZA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"F0FOPp6Jt7nF_rU-aXgXIqABmAz_1tsZhVwzTEypCuv62gPH3wxiMYJS4DvtfYbnFLgtmkyaldMZRNVCtQEYfg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa1307f616ee05ef47f75625cc4d2cf93c0d4a5834e3e2651cd71147d224f944263df2763d08153c9b27912787aa7a93ffff5c19832ff2fa0bf4d28e87c3232ec1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MapFNWiSsoSsSQDPzX6XZ95bzXBp1VwfmqvrZj11HNg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"BUDdJOVP_4EbJ1l-RMygPAb_oOrR2wCyJRUjHjifpZA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"CPAG6HXLGHPTehbS0qIRVCIgRo19r92Prd3BIfeGVV0\"}"
