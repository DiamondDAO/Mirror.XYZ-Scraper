"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Hello everyone!\\n\\nI am planning to launch the following crowdfunding campaign to give contributors NFTs but also ship real physical artworks (I created).\\n\\nI would like to know if there is enough interest in this project, before I pay high gas fees to launch it :) Please share your feedback or any suggestions for improvements. Please share link to this page or give me your feedback or suggestions on my twitter: **[@ArtCoal2](https://twitter.com/ArtCoal2)**\\n\\n## Basics\\n\\nProject Title: **Collect Real Art + NFT**\\nToken: $ARTCOLLECT\\nMy Share: 10%\\nFunding Goals: 7 ETH\\nStretch Goal: 20 ETH\\nContribution Limit: 20 ETH\\n\\n## NFT Tiers\\n\\n1 ETH, Supply: 10, NFT: Chaos Under Water (image)\\n0\\\\.5 ETH, Supply: 15, NFT: Rainy Night (image)\\n0\\\\.25 ETH, Supply: 20, NFT: Simple Life (image)\\n\\n## Patron Podium\\n\\nFirst Place: Short Video Clip with sound (“Things to do in NYC”)\\nSecond Place: Short Video Clip with no sound (“Tell pharma to donate covid vaccines”)\\nThird Place: Photography image (“Busy Life”)\\n\\nCountdown: 24 hours\\n\\n## Who\\n\\nI am a visual artist in New York City who creates drawings, paintings, sculptures, prints, photographs and digital artworks.\\n\\n## What\\n\\nThis is my “Art Coal” project to bring you not just NFTs, but also real physical artworks. You get naming rights for the physical artworks! If you don’t pick a name, we will pick one for you. Project website: **<https://www.artcoal.com>** Upcoming online museum: **<https://www.America.CC>**\\n\\n## Why\\n\\nAs you may be aware, curators, agents, dealers etc. all want a cut and decide what kind of art you should see. When you support my project, you are supporting an emerging artist directly.\\n\\n## Perks\\n\\nThese are the perks for all contributors. These are independent of NFT Tiers and Podium rewards.\\n\\n**For all contributors**:\\n\\n* Your name and info will be displayed along with pictures of artworks sent to you both on project website: **<https://www.artcoal.com>** as well as on upcoming online museum at **<https://www.America.CC>**. You will be shown as an **Art Collector** along with your website or contact info, so people can contact you if they want to rent or buy the artwork from you. **You can opt out of this if you wish to remain anonymous.** Please see an example entry below:\\n\\n![Here, title of the artwork is \\\"The Smith Family Treasure\\\" as chosen by the contributor. If the contributor opts to remain anonymous, lines below the line \\\"In Private Collection\\\" will be suppressed](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/usI_dlOnKaaWMi8kHmSHd.png?height=320&width=651)\\n\\n* Naming rights. You can pick a generic name for the physical artworks. For example: “John’s summer purchase,” “To Lisa,” “My birthday present” etc. A “generic name” means a title that can be assigned to any artwork, regardless of its style, medium or subject matter. Because we choose artworks randomly, you have no way of knowing in advance which specific artwork you would receive. Therefore, please do not choose a restrictive name such as “A dreaming girl” because the artwork you receive may be about a tree instead of a girl. However, you can change the name after you receive your artwork.\\n* Change your chosen name (i.e. title of the artwork) any time after you receive the artwork. Your chosen name will be printed as the title of the artwork on a white paper. (If you do not choose a name, the artist will choose one). We suggest that you tape the paper with an artist tape or hang it with a string. This way, you or the next owner of the artwork (who bought or received it as a gift from you) can change the title of the artwork (i.e. chosen name) easily. Please contact us with any name changes so we can update it on our websites. Artist’s signature or name (Example: “Art Coal”), size info (Example: 8”x16”), edition info (if any) (Example: Edition 2/5) and year (Example: 2019) will be hand written (with pen, pencil, ink, oil paint or acrylic) on the front or the back of all physical artworks and must not be changed by anyone.\\n* All physical artworks are unique with no duplicates and we will choose them randomly when we assemble your order. So you won’t know which specific artworks you will receive.\\n* Physical artworks will be shipped to you (free worldwide shipping within 45 days). We will insure the shipment and make sure that you receive it on time.\\n* Digital images of physical artworks can be emailed to you or, if you have Opensea account (polygon network), we can transfer them as NFTs to your Opensea address. If you choose NFTs, instead of digital images of the physical artworks, the NFTs may be either exact digital images or a derivative of their digital images.\\n* All physical artworks come with paperwork for your insurance purposes (invoice, bill of labor, certificate of authenticity and artist’s self-appraisal). Because this is artwork by an emerging artist, without any previous sale history, appraisers and insurance companies may value the artworks based on the invoice, bill of labor or they can even value them all at zero. However, you should protect, preserve and take good care of your artworks and their NFTs and not tamper with them.\\n* You are welcome to proudly show your artworks to others or display them anyway you want. You can talk about the artworks, what you like and not like about them and even criticize the artworks. You can also criticize the artist! You paid for them. So enjoy them or save them safely, it is really upto you! Please do not show the artworks in any way that brings bad name to the project, artist or shows the artist in a bad light. Example of prohibited conduct: John Doe contributed 1 ETH and received the artworks. He then paid “The Great Art Appraisers, Inc.” a fee of $1500 to appraise the artworks he received. The Appraisers then value all the artworks together at $1. So, John Doe posts the artworks online and calls them worthless at such a low value. (In this scenario, John Doe should not have requested an appraisal in the first place, because these are original artworks. Secondly, the Appraisers are not qualified to appraise artworks backed by NFTs. Thirdly, John Doe should not have publicly implied that I defrauded him with worthless items as artworks)\\n\\n**For 0.25 ETH**: Everything in the above list plus 4 Glossy prints of digital photography or pencil works on paper (at least 8.5”x11”)\\n\\n**For 0.5 ETH**: Everything you get for 0.25 ETH plus 1 color artwork (oil paint, acrylic, watercolor or mixed; at least 18”x24”) on canvas pad (can be rolled or framed) plus 2 sketches (pencil on letter size paper).\\n\\n**For 1 ETH**: Everything you get for 0.5 ETH plus 2 artworks (oil paint, acrylic, color pencil, ink or mixed) on canvas (at least 18”x24”) each stretched on a wooden frame. These 2 artworks come with one page printed write-up by the artist. The wooden frame of these 2 artworks is fixed, non-bendable and non-detachable. Everything is enclosed in a rugged re-usable plastic storage box. Please see a picture of the storage box below:\\n\\n![If you contribute 1 ETH or more, your order is shipped in a plastic storage box](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ApoQT_41C-ar3N8e6_T7H.jpg?height=279&width=400)\\n\\n## For Patrons Only\\n\\nIf you are one of the top three contributors, based on the total amount you contributed to this project, then you are considered a patron. If you’re a patron, with your permission, your name, info and/or picture will be displayed on the front page of the upcoming online museum: **<https://www.America.CC>** as well as on the first page of the PDF catalogue (The catalogue will be available on the online museum website).\\n\\n## Example Artworks\\n\\nThese are some examples of physical artworks. We pick artworks randomly. So, you do not know which specific artworks you will receive. All artworks are appropriate for all audiences. There is no adult content. Sometimes, an oil, acrylic or watercolor painting can also include black/white or color pencil, color pen, pastel or other media. Artwork can be abstract, semi-abstract, figurative, landscape, conceptual, or any other style or mix of styles. You may or may not be able to understand, make sense of or recognize the subject matter portrayed in the artwork.\\n\\n**Photography**\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yR26a1Pmf68felNlB9xr2.JPG?height=737&width=983)\\n\\n**Pencil Drawing**\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZF1jMNlsR1Bi-DUrYW9T1.jpg?height=993&width=752)\\n\\n**Sketch**\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qCM_pZoHo9yYWEMR7C2UU.jpg?height=982&width=715)\\n\\n**Watercolor**\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wqNWtGp9Q7xhXX3rusjej.png?height=2354&width=2386)\\n\\n**Acrylic**\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VPHt6nPqJE6lvbbawN19e.jpg?height=996&width=995)\\n\\n**Oil Paint**\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4CnA4qlOFSbAc-TaCVn1v.jpg?height=680&width=983)\\n\\n**Mixed Media**\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6CMRrXgzo8J_57CPEhtSR.jpg?height=563&width=745)\\n\\n## Risks / Challenges\\n\\nAn emerging artist is an up and coming artist but not established or popular yet. As a emerging artist, I create fresh arts for you. However, because this is original artwork, there is no established primary or secondary market, no price history and no guarantee of any particular price. You may or may not be able to sell it in the future due to lack of liquidity, demand or name for the artist. These are not securities, just artworks. The tokens you receive are digital receipts only. Not an offer to buy or sell securities of any kind. Coronavirus is still active and it may present unforeseen challenges such as shortage of art supplies, shipping supplies or shipping delays. You may receive your shipment damaged or delayed. Please refuse shipment if it is visibly damaged. If you notice damage after opening the shipment, please send pictures. This will help us file a claim with insurance company. You may or may not be able to understand, make sense of or recognize the subject matter portrayed in the artwork. There is no guarantee that you will make a profit or loss by selling the artworks or NFTs you purchased. Because these are original artworks, there is no history of past sales transactions. Therefore, insurance companies and appraisers may value these artworks at zero. However, if you insurance your artwork with proper coverage, and your artworks are accidentally lost or damaged, please show the invoice as proof of the amount you paid and ask your insurance company to compensate you. We can give you an estimate on replacement value if you contact us when you incur a loss. Our replacement value (i.e. the amount we will charge you to recreate the artwork or a similar artwork) is 2.5 times the you amount paid towards the artwork.\\n\\n## What if you cannot afford to contribute?\\n\\nIf you cannot afford to contribute to this project, you can still admire and appreciate the artwork. Please share this crowdfunding project with your friends and relatives. Also, please contact me and let me know which artworks you love the most and why :) Remember, art is for everyone!\",\"timestamp\":1633670580,\"title\":\"My upcoming crowdfunding\"},\"digest\":\"fslz425H-ceZGCvCLFFZWysYLcfAjfJOOl2tQe0TQ_Y\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x253B77d9100E39601Ee01b4e5567a5fc8E878A81\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"CLZussYyPNf85LRhwAFKaF4MTZI8zuzd_PYHu4uPYSE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ecPEpU46GlnsDnfq4_8xMGXVeHOs900Ojblnfmpj4yY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"u2c69Ur3jfmZujlRYGjuG7Yv-lgCAAwHVFezIl4JnjJULD7UYFnn62qoZUYd_jedJJ-undh63xB6J-P0CevoAw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x27a30cabef0509535996c69924b3108266143a6941ef79475edf1ca0ec9bb9667f3376925b4483eddbb6b4e71358bda298a43a8225f71cebd3860a119307843c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"CLZussYyPNf85LRhwAFKaF4MTZI8zuzd_PYHu4uPYSE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ecPEpU46GlnsDnfq4_8xMGXVeHOs900Ojblnfmpj4yY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"yvBxK-RqZu-Kc5nbkgXyDRQmajg71uXj0MEYAaRSnxc\"}"
