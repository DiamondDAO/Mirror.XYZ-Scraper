"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"My name is [Vin](https://futureland.tv/vin/), I am a documentary filmmaker and the founder of [Futureland](https://futureland.tv/), a habit tracker and daily journal for artists. Today I am very happy to be sharing a new project with you, it’s a podcast titled, “New Memoirs”.\\n\\nNew Memoirs is not just a podcast about web3, or any one technology, or subject. I am doing this because it feels like the world is changing in a multi-dimensional way right now, and New Memoirs is my attempt at understanding those changes for myself.\\n\\nThis project serves as my exploration into the questions, “what does a sustainable civilization look like, and how do we get there?”. I want to go to the front lines of shifts in technology, science, spirituality, and subcultures, in hopes of coming back with stories that inform and inspire what we make.\\n\\nThe first episode of New Memoirs was recorded with [John Palmer](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer) in his apartment in Brooklyn, it’s titled “John Palmer: On DAOs and Independent Creativity”, and as an experiment, it’s been minted as a 1/1 NFT, with all proceeds being automatically split between John and I. You can bid on this NFT at the end of this entry.\\n\\nIn this conversation we explore the meaning, or lack of meaning of DAOs, their potential and what John has learned through experimenting with them so far. We also discuss his experiences through his own creative process, and some mental models he uses to keep exploring things for his own right reasons.\\n\\nYou can listen to New Memoirs on all major platforms, including [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-memoirs/id1594682094) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/0HYaJVv0doWP9QfqwIQXWh).\\n\\nThanks for everything so far. <3\\n\\n[https://share.transistor.fm/e/f0f28317/dark?display=iframe&height=180](https://share.transistor.fm/e/f0f28317/dark?display=iframe&height=180)\\n\\n## New Memoirs Episode 1 NFT\\n\\n[auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?auctionId=0x8260f5fba12bddc14d5d9acb01bf7c05c3a15e76bf154c0fbdcd7bde05ab44db&tokenId=6120](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?auctionId=0x8260f5fba12bddc14d5d9acb01bf7c05c3a15e76bf154c0fbdcd7bde05ab44db&tokenId=6120)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637248275,\"title\":\"New Memoirs\",\"publication\":\"v\"},\"digest\":\"W-jGsmj692rjBbPdp4yodvslFP3jl7kqYf-zgqoZZ88\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xc36419221877e81e6b734e9C6b900516A0722c93\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xFrP8nqliVXD4Yi_nlm0_5vfCh9O6_JbLAB93KixMeE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JSijXOsbvgdkxRlKKtMz9lW-UZtoSgSEbDdU4Swyitw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"A1ulgPb3_Y_sUU3S_nkdwIEo6fbl23SS-T9PxRI7JpesQqTmSOnkRPVvIS0sakgmZMP0hGHToJxpH3GaLa7WYA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x52201a0f409a0593455806756a63f7764c17074a6ff08a2d41aff947be5acbaa11b7ed36f40cb825ca369c4b908dc4c1b7f3c888b609872459c863fbf12bfcfb1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xFrP8nqliVXD4Yi_nlm0_5vfCh9O6_JbLAB93KixMeE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JSijXOsbvgdkxRlKKtMz9lW-UZtoSgSEbDdU4Swyitw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"EO9KYw-i_y6d0T9cuO4GpnwJXLtRvicDGRXtdXzuBbo\"}"
