He advised users to closely research safety measures of a platform before investing and promptly notify the personnel of the relevant exchange if they become aware of any potential security incident.\\n\\nFollowing suit, the Shiba Inu community also confirmed it would help the hacked crypto exchange, citing its already existing efforts in reviewing potential security threats for ShibaSwap, a community-built decentralized exchange.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/Shibtoken/status/1467622004463259651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1467622004463259651%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fhuobi-and-shiba-inu-community-to-help-bitmart-overcome-200m-hack](https://twitter.com/Shibtoken/status/1467622004463259651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1467622004463259651%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fhuobi-and-shiba-inu-community-to-help-bitmart-overcome-200m-hack)\\n\\nXia also [said](https://twitter.com/sheldonbitmart/status/1467722582845702149) the exchange would compensate affected investors with its own funds. “We are also talking to multiple project teams to confirm the most reasonable solutions such as token swaps. No user assets will be harmed,” he added.\\n\\nThe hack forced the exchange to stop all withdrawals and deposits temporarily. However, Xia is confident BitMart will have resumed services by Tuesday.\\n\\n***Related: [Synapse Bridge prevents $8M hack](https://cointelegraph.com/news/synapse-bridge-prevents-8m-usd-hack)***\\n\\nCross-chain protocol Synapse Bridge recently averted a multi-million-dollar exploit on the Avalanche Neutral Dollar (nUSD) Metapool.\\n\\nAs Cointelegraph reported, Synapse Bridge prevented a hacker from stealing approximately $8 million worth of cryptocurrencies:\\n\\n> “Over the past 16 hours, we encountered and discovered a contract bug in the way that the AMM Metapool contracts handle virtual price calculations against the base pool’s virtual price.”\\n\\nWhile the threat was averted, Synapse Bridge soon deployed new nUSD pools to strengthen its security against similar attacks.\",\"timestamp\":1639481532,\"title\":\"Huobi and Shiba Inu community to help BitMart overcome $200M hack\"},\"digest\":\"glHb1C-qfZnNIk_03wovnGuDd59NumX38NABYmIjuow\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x1D1d03616fB4a50801a485F0E62cB3F67Ce48D06\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"SuhW7LAvv-ELhl67WqlTBMgzEs1dObXMJ2ea1S9XLw0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JD4UOYqJtRtQrCY9zOXS-QQcY29_PdluVqwNzBEsC6o\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"IIJY-6yhcwvqCdb3RP_ebWC0YNwg1xa7AUYxdpkIlUjvQZolt5lHA0BrTHyY_BZXkLTiMuJA0LMWF-TpBGchlA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xeef70e31fe3c7db50062ae9af93682bcdaa07141725e3287393abf9cff213874264aa8f37a433043f77aa57383ebca1625dd3e65395e935b9be92c66ccf274be1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"SuhW7LAvv-ELhl67WqlTBMgzEs1dObXMJ2ea1S9XLw0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JD4UOYqJtRtQrCY9zOXS-QQcY29_PdluVqwNzBEsC6o\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"glHb1C-qfZnNIk_03wovnGuDd59NumX38NABYmIjuow\"}"
