"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"So many of us grow up as “others”. Questioning where we fit in, who our tribe is and how our identity meets the world. For me, this was the story of much of my life as a Japanese-New Zealander who was never Japanese enough to be Japanese, or white enough to be white. My teenage love of jazz, hip hop and drum’n’bass all stemmed from the same needs - these were music forms where I could find comfort and community through diving into albums created from artists’ own searches for belonging and identity: sonic offerings that decried the status quo and mainstream seeking something more. This premise has been my foundation as an artist - creating music that looks to answer my own inner questions and reflect the world I see, while knowing that emulating the status quo does little to help me understand my own past, present and future.\\n\\n**Motherland** is a 43-minute film, a meditative audio-visual exploration of my Japanese ancestry and culture. Presented as both a **super-NFT film** and **audio NFTs**, Motherland features my Japanese roots-inspired music through a solo performance, set to footage shot during an artist residency in Kaga, Japan, during Summer 2019. It’s a series of instrumental tone-poems and immersive audio-visual moments to let your imagination play.\\n\\nThe collector of the super-NFT Motherland film will also receive **additional content** and an **equity share in the entire collection’s revenue** (more about that below). As well as sharing the project to share my art, I’m excited to experiment with different ways to present, share and incentivize music in the web3 space.\\n\\n***\\\\* Due to file size, please allow up to two minutes for the film to buffer before it plays***\\n\\n[auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?tokenId=3750](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?tokenId=3750)\\n\\n## The Film\\n\\nWe begin **Motherland** on the train ride to Kaga, and then on to an immersive journey of soundtracked sights following outdoor pathways to temples, rivers and lakes, accompanied by the sounds of nature and the eight compositions.\\n\\nThe footage of Japan featured in the film was shot in two locations - **Kakusenkei Gorge**, a beautiful forested valley with a river running between, and **Natadera Temple** - a Buddhist temple established in 714 AD with sprawling grounds, temple buildings and a distinct feeling of spiritual homeland. Along with the visuals, I’ve incorporated all the field-sound - the summer breeze rustling the trees, cicada song in the air, and the river’s running water. These create an integral connecting of the music with the visuals, and underpin the film with the sonic signature of nature.\\n\\nEach composition included in the film is introduced with *shodo* (traditional Japanese calligraphy) by visual artist **Kuniharu Yoshida**. The visual of the shodo and sight of Kuniharu’s hand in motion captures so much of the spirit of ancestry and roots which this project focuses on, and I’m grateful to have his contributions here.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AoIkXLj3xAHG5cTHi10qm.jpg?height=1348&width=2396)\\n\\n## The Music\\n\\n**Motherland** features eight instrumental compositions.

Where some of my work dives heavily into beat-culture and the dancefloor, Motherland is an introspective offering, leaning primarily on the sound of the piano and subtle use of electronics to tell the story.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vYH2K0udctxqI46gcBVIG.jpg?height=1324&width=2552)\\n\\n## The NFT Collection\\n\\nMotherland is a deeply personal project for me and it’s important to present it in a way that preserves this meaning.
