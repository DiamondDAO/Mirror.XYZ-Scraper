"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I’ve joined the crypto space for more than 3 years now. \\n\\nI was attracted by cryptocurrency by its 2 properties: its self-sovereign nature and the ultimate programmability. Being a dev I was never an apprentice of finance until I learned about it through the perspective of cryptos. The fact that a nerd like me can “program” finance and make something accessible to everyone single person in this world, is mindblowing.\\n\\nBut one thing I kept thinking about and never found a decent answer to is how blockchain can change/empower the internet and what product can we bring to this world in the current paradigm?\\n\\nOf course I know web3 has been a buzz word and I’ve read all about it but it’s still a blurred image to me. Being a pragmatist I just can’t sort out how blockchain can be integrated into the internet in a step-by-step way. I’m also a lot of you can relate as well.\\n\\nThen Mirror, a great example to me.\\n\\nUGC (User Generated Content) was a hot concept back in 2017 but not recently. Not because it failed but it has become a routine and has been fully integrated into all internet products.\\n\\nSimilarly, my colleagues and I had a lot of discussions around UGV in 2018. Everyone around was fascinated about this concept, but no one, including myself, knows what’s the next step.\\n\\nMirror addresses this problem by providing a set of easy-to-use components in their product. \\n\\nEven more I believe Mirror has the potential to become a platform where devs contribute open source components and writers contribute articles. Users pay for gaining knowledge. All parties get together to manage this system. \\n\\nHow beautiful is that!\\n\\nGood job mirror team. I envy you having such a great opportunity for building this product. I’ll stay tuned and see if there’s place I can contribute myself.\",\"timestamp\":1639641023,\"title\":\"Hi Mirror\"},\"digest\":\"2lulJsWTD1nIeHTK22NuDVaNy-D3tADXMn8xNvGXuvw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x960A4D00bBEcDb1F2fEBF4ac184Fdbaf64ccB279\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"dkg-b41Ux-oEvDNxVNoPjhSJpiX9ON-YzPKRFQpX19s\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"WmZjiYN9qjIGc8GJxDmJ5iPF8rigFCvxf7vcPPvF15g\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"toQyPxWEih6yDZ051tDPDsSsRQJgyejVVD3g5wjPi2mLFWerVnjj-k1Tb4RsSfDPj4oXvFVsZOMnat_D9IM3Mw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8528c4f0435273d1a1e80c48176be69a3bd55e5e09fe82b51ea5e6b05595cc8d2f8873c0d6b36236040410c8dc212f0bd61f9e5284ad25c46686b0d88daa556e1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"dkg-b41Ux-oEvDNxVNoPjhSJpiX9ON-YzPKRFQpX19s\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"WmZjiYN9qjIGc8GJxDmJ5iPF8rigFCvxf7vcPPvF15g\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"2lulJsWTD1nIeHTK22NuDVaNy-D3tADXMn8xNvGXuvw\"}"
