"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**If it's your first time here, it can get quite intimidating. Here's a quick overview of the what, who, where, why, when and how of Concave.**\\n\\nUPDATED: 30 November 2021 \\n  \\n ACCESS to AMEND or ADD ADDENDUM: Members of the community can comment in this thread - like a Wiki - and when I have time, I‚Äôll do the necessary adjustments. If you want to claim credit for the amendments or additions/retractions, please include your Discord username in the comment. If someone comments or notifies me that the comment access has been abused, I will restrict access instead. Thanks!\\n\\n**1) WHAT is Concave?**\\n\\nConcave is a protocol that has yet to reveal its true underlying purpose or how it works.  \\n  \\n It does however has a Twitter account with the following pinned tweet:\\n\\n<https://twitter.com/ConcaveFi/status/1463360207006973957> with the accompanying image below. It also has an active Discord channel (which is currently invite-only).\\n\\n** \\n **Here‚Äôs a rough example - Concave is the giant spoon of liquidity. Providing a central multi-chain platform for protocols to maximise yield. This is accomplished alongside being a black hole for the accumulation of ohm. Concave is the true Olympus patron.\\n\\n¬†\\n\\n***The proverbial pinned image on Concave‚Äôs Twitter page has gotten many Concave users bewildered and bewitched.***\\n\\n \\n ** \\n **Once you‚Äôve gained access to its Discord channel, if you visit the üî¨„Éª# research-center at Concave's Discord, you‚Äôll see different members trying to figure out what Concave is and posting their theories there.\\n\\nAdmins and moderators who deem the efforts worthwhile or close enough to Concave's true workings are bestowed the \\\"genesis' role, which once earned, you'll be able to see on your Discord username when you click on it. Different roles are demarcated by different colors by the way.\\n\\n**2ÔºâWHO is Concave?**\\n\\nConcave is apparently founded by a Core team comprising TNA Capital, 0xCanary, 0xTheGreatApe and Typhoeus. It is also moderated/inspected by WAGMIcrypto, Nour, 0xBebis, c0inalchemist and zefram.eth.\\n\\nYou can follow each of them on Twitter and see what they are tweeting about via this consolidated Core and Inspectors team page here: <https://linktr.ee/concavefi>\\n\\nIs this an anon project?\\n\\nIn case you‚Äôre wondering, among the team members and inspectors, Nour Haridy (LinkedIn profile) is a known individual, who‚Äôs behind projects like INVERSE Finance and the stablecoin DOLA protocol, while zefram.eth (trois, trois), whose real name is presumably Zefram Lou (LinkedIn profile) is behind reputable projects like 88mph and Astrodrop.\\n\\nSo don‚Äôt get too worried about the project being completely anonymous.\\n\\nMore importantly, Concave's Discord channel comprises a growing user base whose interest is currently focused on completing 'tasks' or 'responsibilities' to create a vibrant, user-friendly and role-based community.\\n\\nAt the time of writing, members can earn these roles if they complete these roles‚Äô respective tasks. Note that as the user base grows, completing these tasks well and being recognized by the admins will take time. So be patient.\\n\\nWhat are the different roles you can earn as an active Concave Discord member\\n\\n* Miner: Say a prayer to all via üôè„Éª#pray, or greet each other with üåÑ„Éª#gm  or üåÉ„Éª#gn in their respective channels.\\n* Hentai:  Interact with the #culture-request and visit ü¶¥„Éª#culture. Note that this is for mature audiences only so it's NSFW.\\n* Foreman: This requires a small payment to Nitro boost (USD9.99 a month, subject to change here: <https://discord.com/nitro>) where you boost the Concave Discord channel. Don't fret over this if you can't afford it.\\n* Genesis: Head on to üî¨„Éª# research-center and offer your most profound theory about what you think Concave is about. Read up what other members have theorized and philosophized. You either give yourself a head spin or think you've grown a tail by the end of it! Also, try heading over to üôè #pray and write the most clever prayer you can dream up relating to Concave including \\\"WAGMI\\\"\\n* Explorer: Engage with community members and spread positive vibes across various channels. It used to be !explore in different channels but due to spam, that's probably been banned/curtailed by mods. If you're bilingual don't hesitate to branch out to some of the international channels.\\n* Surveyor: This is probably one of the hardest roles to earn. Go to üê∏„Éª#memes and upload your best self-inspired meme relevant to Concave and what many think it's aiming for. Be original. Don't copy-paste or repeat what's already been done. These can be made via meme generator apps, or via gallery app for the mobile users of the community.\\n\\nIf you need inspiration, head on over to the #pepo-city channel and type /pepo to provide you with a random image of Pepe.\\n\\n* Seismologist: Go to the cave-stadium and tune into the 24/7 lo-fi vibes radio station. Note that you may lose your Seismologist role once you tune out of the station, but tune back in and it should reappear. You can also raise your hand within the station to hopefully gain attention for the role.\\n  * Spelunker: Be helpful by offering answers and queries to new members of the community (especially if they ask questions in the üí¨„Éª#general channel. Members of the community have also gifted nitro to others that may not be able to afford or obtain it on their own.\\n\\n  When you earn this role, you‚Äôll have access to #the-spring channel where members get to chill, swap tips and discuss possible new tasks or quests ahead.\\n  * Documentator: Visit #documentation and either provide a helpful guide on what everyone's been saying about Concave (references, links, tweets, etc.) or offer up story ideas for the narrative team to devise helpful documentation for future visitors to Concave.\\n\\n  At the time of writing, several sub-channels have been created by the community, such as #catalogue-task, #meme-catalogue-task and #subtask-decentralization-of-information. The objective is to consolidate the plethora of community-contributed documents, memes, images, theories, shares, etc. in probably an indexable, searchable, archivable format.\\n\\n  When you earn this role, you‚Äôll have access to the #documentooor Conclave. There, you can join other Documentators to discuss current documentation statuses for different projects.\\n  * Miner: This is a role where you execute tasks. The first task so far is for you if you're a little more anal about all the messy information, memes and data-sheets all over the Discord and Twitter channels related to Concave. If you can figure out a way to catalogue or categorize this info, pool your resources and time with other Miners (forming a Conclave) and document them as documentation threads (like this FAQ) or separately under #catalogue-task or #meme-catalogue-task. Who knows? You might even earn yourself the unique role of Miner of the Day!\\n\\n  There are other channels, like #ot-for-the-peace, which are more to share calm peace signs with everyone - kumbaya and namaste greetings. :)\\n\\n  What are these roles for? What‚Äôs the worth of working so hard to earn them?\\n\\n  Well, your guess is as good as mine. If I were to offer insight, based on my experiences on Inverse Finance, it‚Äôs more as a marker or indicator of how much effort or commitment you‚Äôve placed in being part of the community.\\n\\n  Whether that comes with a reward is probably secondary. At the end of the day, enjoy the journey in earning them and contribute to the community in whatever way you feel is relevant and necessary to your time, resources, talent and interests.\\n\\n  **3ÔºâWHERE is Concave?**\\n\\n  Concave is not a physical entity or a corporation.\\n\\n  It's a community-driven (decentralized) cryptocurrency protocol that sits on one or several blockchains.\\n\\n  If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with what blockchains, cryptocurrency or stablecoins are, well, you may need to do a simple search (suggested keywords: what is blockchain, what is cryptocurrency, what are stablecoins) on YouTube and start a crash-course 101 tutorial.\\n\\n  **4ÔºâWHEN is Concave?**\\n\\n  **Concave first appeared on Twitter (<https://twitter.com/ConcaveFi/status/1463393214224904193>) on November 24, 2021.**¬†\\n\\n  The Discord channel was formed the next day. As of 28 November 2021, there were 13,900 users on its Discord channel and 11,800 followers on its Twitter account.\\n\\n  **5) HOW to join Concave?**\\n\\n  Currently, Concave can be found on Twitter (<https://twitter.com/ConcaveFi>) and Discord (by member invitation only). It does not have a Telegram chat channel at the time of writing.\\n\\n  If you're reading this outside of the Discord channel, the only way to score an invite into Discord is to either follow its Twitter account (for invite links) or get to know a member who has invites to give.\\n\\n  Alternative, sometimes the admins will announce participation opportunities to earn the invite.\\n\\n   \\n **Also, once you've joined Concave, do behave and be courteous to fellow members. If you've been found to misbehave (eg. you bully others, use expletives, copy-paste/plagiarize someone else's work/effort, spam everyone), you will be transported to the üëπ„Éª#troll-pit where you'll experience a time-out from the other channels.**\\n\\n  ** \\n **After some time, you may be let back out into the other channels. Repeat offenders may potentially lose their earned roles or get kicked out of the channel.\\n\\n  Is there a Concave token?\\n\\n  *The answer is no.*¬†\\n\\n  Please be wary of fake contracts and scammers who are constantly testing the system and convincing you to ‚Äòbuy‚Äô these fake Concave tokens. If you‚Äôre in doubt, or your gut feel says it doesn‚Äôt feel right, please alert the admins (by DMing them on Twitter or Discord) and let them know who these scammers or the scam token addresses are.\\n* **6ÔºâWHY Concave?**\\n\\n  Now, this is the proverbial question, isn't it?\\n\\n  In an earlier post I shared in the Discord channel (again, just my own theory), I provided the following insights (as Concave has yet to reveal its true nature, my theory may be so wrong, this may just be fluff. So take this with a questioning pinch of salt - feel free to correct me if I am):\\n\\n  a) Biggest challenges facing DeFi (Decentralized Finance) today:\\n  * Low liquidity once front-runners farmed their fill of incentives and dumped the native token as incentives decrease (affecting token value)\\n  * Vesting helps alleviate the sudden drop in protocol/token value but basically prolongs the issue above to later.\\n  * Switching between blockchains - bridges and fees make using them confusing and complex for some.\\n\\n  High Ethereum gas fees and some restrictions with using Layer 2 protocols are also great barriers for new entrants into the cryptocurrency scene.\\n  * Banks and VCs trying to get in on the action with front-runs, FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) and regulations\\n  * Hacks and exploits\\n\\n  b) Some successes in DeFi today:\\n  * OlympusDAO, a cryptocurrency protocol, allows its users to stake its native OHM tokens on its platform and trade them at a discount through bonding with other tokens, which essentially allow for a much, more controlled and stabilized environment for its native token and the paired tokens to retain their respective values.\\n  * this in turn preserves liquidity within the platform while balancing and stabilizing the value of other tokens across a broader ecosystem.\\n  * Tokemak, another protocol, allows its users to supply single-stake tokens to form less-volatile Liquidity Pools (if you have time, look up the term ‚Äòimpermanent loss‚Äô on YouTube).\\n\\n  Toke holders act as Liquidity Directors to vote on how these pools are incentivized presumably via different Tokemak reactors and gauges - this also protects their ecosystem and lets the community 'direct' how different pools/treasuries are refinanced or rebalanced.\\n\\n  Here's a useful YouTube video by Finematics on what OlympusDAO and Tokemak do (and no, it's not done by me, so I cannot claim credit for this): <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0vRTi8_FRk>\\n\\n  c) What's potentially different about Concave?\\n\\n  I may be wrong, but it seems Concave is marrying elements of Ohm with Tokemak by making it easier to bridge tokens from different blockchains like AVAX, ONE, CRO and FANTOM - while self-generating yield through the Ohm bonding protocol, or at least, lessons learned from having used these protocols.\\n\\n  Not only that, the type of cross-chain tokens used on its protocol could employ or backed by a treasury comprising of stablecoins like DOLA, which is essentially USD 1: 1 DOLA.\\n\\n  The DAO or Decentralized Organization comprising of elected community members and native token holders may have 'governance' on 'directing' how these cross-chain self-yielding pools are used to further stabilize, reward and secure the ecosystem.\\n\\n  Inverse Finance has just passed its Governance Charlie proposal, where INV stakeholders can still vote with their staked tokens on proposals (usually, when you‚Äôve staked your native tokens, your tokens are locked so you can‚Äôt really vote on proposals). It may be similar for Concave native token holders who have staked theirs.\\n\\n  They may also be able to govern different gamified pools (through fast, intermediate or slow burn-type vesting schedules like how other protocols like Curve or Convex do), but through\\n\\n  If you have further questions, feel free to contact me on twitter at @delato29 and on discord at ICEY#0063\",\"timestamp\":1638288026,\"title\":\"CONCAVE FI - Algorithm stablecoin weapon\\n\"},\"digest\":\"YpR69dwjYisjOXrbwL7ksg_r1gPKR-cHP4vZczDrPSo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0FA699182DFa78f1A22f8aBd4c93923dce5d653a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"yO2ssNRv-TmT5EQpPKUVBwYR-3x9P5425RPDAfdbdmE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"a9YXYQHCsyWXN4we3riwZ-NCv2MoWsXosnsf80HpphM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"m-Ki8keZAj5O_tbwdlI5Akec-HyEjcViLptJd5yj8E4oDoGJTMxRznk5EFBcb_GcR5kbAHHbovtLJt3KG4o9sA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x28b89e1a2c0f02618958d6ebd3c9f4b93b0d4fd3a1b3c7c606754e8e6ca38ece7ce388fe88c11688a2900dd3f1c002f842a1f5504d0fd5d0733c667491201c331b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"yO2ssNRv-TmT5EQpPKUVBwYR-3x9P5425RPDAfdbdmE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"a9YXYQHCsyWXN4we3riwZ-NCv2MoWsXosnsf80HpphM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"YpR69dwjYisjOXrbwL7ksg_r1gPKR-cHP4vZczDrPSo\"}"
