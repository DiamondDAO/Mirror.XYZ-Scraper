"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Buy & Sell 2000+ tokens on Polygon with USD and pay Zero Network Fees\\n\\nDharma is the easiest way to buy & sell any token on Ethereum from a US bank account. Today, we are excited to add Polygon network support for all users. \\n\\n**With Polygon, Dharma users can:**\\n\\n* **Buy thousands of tokens, directly from a US-bank account**\\n* **Sell tokens for dollars in your bank account without leaving Polygon**\\n* **Swap thousands of tokens with near-instant confirmation**\\n* **Transfer tokens to other Polygon users around the globe**\\n\\n… all with zero\\\\* network fees.  No expensive Ethereum transactions or tricky cross-chain bridges to navigate — the barrier to entry is *gone*.\\n\\n\\\\*Dharma will cover network fees up to $0.50, which covers the *vast majority* of transactions on Polygon. Users will pay for transaction fees only if the network fee exceeds $0.50.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nSince launching the Dharma mobile application in January 2020, the #1 piece of feedback we’ve gotten is “why are network fees so high?”. Initially, we attempted to address this feedback by subsidizing user transactions. But as DeFi Summer raged on, this practice became infeasible, and the volume of feedback increased. \\n\\n**No more. Today, users around the world can experience the magic of DeFi, through a beautiful and intuitive user experience, with zero network fees.** \\n\\nSo buy that DeFi token that you were priced out of because of network fees; trade daily and pay zero gas; pay your friends, family members, or business associated in crypto. And if you need to cash out to your bank account, you can do it directly from your Polygon wallet.  \\n\\nNo more shuffling money between Ethereum, Polygon, and your cryptocurrency exchange. It’s all possible now that Dharma is on Polygon.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Buying Tokens from Your Bank Account on Polygon\\n\\nBuying and selling on Polygon is easy!
