"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Taddington in an open carriage. Fanny told her they were his mother's sables, and none to compare with them in the country.\\n\\nOn returning, she tried her voice to the harmonium in her own antechamber, and found it was gaining strength--like herself.\\n\\nMeantime Zoe Vizard met Severne in the garden, and told him she had written to Lord Uxmoor, and he would never visit her again. But she did not make light of the sacrifice this time. She had sacrificed her own self-respect as well as Uxmoor's, and she was sullen and tearful.\\n\\nHe had to be very wary and patient, or she would have parted with him too, and fled from both of them to her brother.\\n\\nUxmoor's wounded pride would have been soothed could he have been present at the first interview of this pair. He would have seen Severne treated with a hauteur and a sort of savageness he himself was safe from, safe in her unshaken esteem.\\n\\nBut the world is made for those who can keep their temper, especially the female part of the world.\\n\\nSad, kind, and loving, but never irritable, Severne smoothed down and soothed and comforted the wounded girl; and, seeing her two or three times a day--for she was completely mistress of her time--got her completely into his power again.\\n\\nUxmoor did not reply.\\n\\nShe had made her selection. Love beckoned forward. It was useless to look back.\\n\\nLove was omnipotent. They both began to recover their good looks as if by magic; and as Severne's passion, though wicked, was earnest, no poor bird was ever more completely entangled by bird-lime than Zoe was caught by Edward Severne.\\n\\nTheir usual place of meeting was the shrubbery attached to Somerville Villa. The trees, being young, made all the closer shade, and the gravel-walk meandered, and shut them out from view.\\n\\nSeverne used to enter this shrubbery by a little gate leading from the meadow, and wait under the trees till Zoe came to him. Vizard's advertisements alarmed him, and he used to see the coast clear before he entered the shrubbery, and also before he left it. He was so particular in this that, observing one day an old man doddering about with a basket, he would not go in till he had taken a look at him. He found it was an ancient white-haired villager gathering mushrooms. The old fellow was so stiff, and his hand so trembling, that it took him about a minute to gather a single fungus.\\n\\nTo give a reason for coming up to him, Severne said, \\\"How old are you, old man?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I be ninety, measter, next Martinmas-day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Only ninety?\\\" said our Adonis, contemptuously; \\\"you look a hundred and ninety.\\\"\\n\\nHe would have been less contemptuous had he known that the mushrooms were all toad-stools, and the village centenaire was Mr. Joseph Ashmead, resuming his original arts, and playing Grandfather Whitehead on the green grass.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV.\\n\\nMADEMOISELLE KLOSKING told Vizard the time drew near when she must leave his hospitable house.\\n\\n\\\"Say a month hence,\\\" said he.\\n\\nShe shook her head.\\n\\n\\\"Of course you will not stay to gratify me,\\\" said he, half sadly, half bitterly. \\\"But you will have to stay a week or two longer *par ordonnance du me'decin.\\\"*\\n\\n\\\"My physician is reconciled to my going. We must all bow to necessity.\\\"\\n\\nThis was said too firmly to admit a reply. \\\"The old house will seem very dark again whenever you do go,\\\" said Vizard, plaintively.\\n\\n\\\"It will soon be brightened by her who is its true and lasting light,\\\" was the steady reply.\\n\\nA day or two passed with nothing to record, except that Vizard hung about Ina Klosking, and became, if possible, more enamored of her and more unwilling to part with her.\\n\\nMr. Ashmead arrived one afternoon about three o'clock, and was more than an hour with her. They conversed very earnestly, and when he went, Miss Gale found her agitated.\\n\\n\\\"This will not do,\\\" said she.\\n\\n\\\"It will pass, my friend,\\\" said Ina. \\\"I will sleep.\\\"\\n\\nShe laid herself down and slept three hours before dinner.\\n\\nShe arose refreshed, and dined with the little party; and on retiring to the drawing-room, she invited Vizard to join them at his convenience. He made it his convenience in ten minutes.\\n\\nThen she opened the piano, played an introduction, and electrified them all by singing the leading song in Siebel. She did not sing it so powerfully as in the theater; she would not have done that even if she could: but still she sung it out, and nobly. It seemed a miracle to hear such singing in a room.\\n\\nVizard was in raptures.\\n\\nThey cooled suddenly when she reminded him what he had said, that she must stay till she could sing Siebel's song. \\\"I keep to the letter of the contract,\\\" said she. \\\"My friends, this is my last night at Vizard Court.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Please try and shake that resolution,\\\" said Vizard, gravely, to Mesdemoiselles Dover and Gale.\\n\\n\\\"They cannot,\\\" said Ina. \\\"It is my destiny. And yet,\\\" said she, after a pause, \\\"I would not have you remember me by that flimsy thing. Let me sing you a song your mother loved; let me be remembered in this house, as a singer, by that.\\\"\\n\\nThen she sung Handel's song:\\n\\n\\\"What though I trace each herb and flower That decks the morning dew? Did I not own Jehovah's power, How vain were all I knew.\\\"\\n\\nShe sung it with amazing purity, volume, grandeur, and power; the lusters rang and shook, the hearts were thrilled, and the very souls of the hearers ravished. She herself turned a little pale in singing it, and the tears stood in her eyes.\\n\\nThe song and its interpretation were so far above what passes for music that they all felt compliments would be an impertinence. Their eyes and their long drawn breath paid the true homage to that great master rightly interpreted--a very rare occurrence.\\n\\n\\\"Ah!\\\" said she; \\\"that was the hand could brandish Goliath's spear.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And this is how you reconcile us to losing you,\\\" said Vizard. \\\"You might stay, at least, till you had gone through my poor mother's collection.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah! I wish I could. But I cannot. I must not. My Fate forbids it.\\\"\\n\\n[ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/121](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/121)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637672105,\"title\":\"\\nNext day Vizard had his mother's sables taken out and aired, and drove Mademoiselle Klosking into\"},\"digest\":\"K8Z42DzizGO-MH-Ok2UAqHc8IGrxX4BSSC08Z96Jozk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xebb47BcE22955a8570D5570840798eda13Ec89EB\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"XTkuTlf-ntHI0o6_Q-FSfNaXGP-lUgW4JMK-ZaEYXjg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"G1ry0sF87Mzl0QId6C99qrTjWmmHtCu3HKFZsOiDk7s\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"q6iL6RTe4N9Le8Sa2JhGI6q7-Kptsjt5NboRCTxQxBkWXFKMWPUIXOnzaX5X4rRdZwFDGLlbJzAzZuyHHZZ54g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8f76527f2ae6b285eb64ab0096c0c114e594013cb1328333c4468a9e835c923a68c850cfa92c34e67e08888337271cbfdd13a9cc7fbf31d7b9eb8fcd9c9c0c2c1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"XTkuTlf-ntHI0o6_Q-FSfNaXGP-lUgW4JMK-ZaEYXjg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"G1ry0sF87Mzl0QId6C99qrTjWmmHtCu3HKFZsOiDk7s\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"K8Z42DzizGO-MH-Ok2UAqHc8IGrxX4BSSC08Z96Jozk\"}"
