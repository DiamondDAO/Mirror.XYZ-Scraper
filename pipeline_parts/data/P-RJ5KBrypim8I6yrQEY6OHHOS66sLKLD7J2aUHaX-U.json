"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Uber is a borrowed word from German of which the original form is über, however, it has been well assimilated into English language, and have conformed to the English way of pronunciation and spelling, i.e. the denizen(同化词).\\n\\nAccording to the definiton on [Dictionary.com](http://Dictionary.com), uber can function as an adverb or adjective, meaning\\\"over, beyond, above\\\", more specifically, the word indicates the highest, greatest, or most extreme example of something, which may corresponds to the ambition of UBER.\\nFrom a phonological perspective, assimilation rule may well explain why uber is not \\\\['juːbər\\\\] as we heard in its chinese equivalent speech.\\n\\n```\\nThe assimilation rule assimilates one sound to another by \\\"copying\\\" a feature of a sequential phoneme, thus making the two phones similar...When we speak, we tend to increase the ease of articulation. This \\\"sloppy\\\" tendency may become regularized as rules of language.  ---《a new consice course in linguistics for students of English》(second edition)                     \\n```\\n\\nFor instance, in the word scream \\\\[skriːm\\\\], the \\\\[iː\\\\] sound is nasalized for it is followed by a nasal \\\\[m\\\\]; the \\\\[n\\\\] sound in the prefix in- of the word incorrect \\\\[ɪnkə'rekt\\\\] is pronounced as a velar nasal(软腭鼻音) \\\\[ŋ\\\\], for it's followed by the velar stop(软腭爆破音) \\\\[k\\\\]; while in indiscreet \\\\[ɪndɪ'skriːt\\\\] , \\\\[d\\\\] is an aveolar stop(齿槽爆破音), so here the \\\"n\\\" sound copy the feature of \\\\[d\\\\] as an alveolar nasal(齿槽鼻音) \\\\[n\\\\]. From all above we can see that the sound in question( \\\\[iː\\\\] or \\\\[n\\\\] )  assume the same place of articulation as the consonant that follows it.\\nTherefore, we analyze the word uber into u-b-er \\\\['uːbər\\\\], we find that \\\\[b\\\\] is a bilabial, so is \\\\[w\\\\], formed in the same manner of \\\\[u\\\\] with a slight noise. It can be obviously felt that the sound combination \\\\[uːb\\\\] requires less effort to voice than \\\\[juːb\\\\], and it conforms to the assimilation rule. As for the latter \\\\[juːb\\\\], the front combination \\\\[juː\\\\] consists of a shift from a palatal sound \\\\[j\\\\] to a bilabial sound \\\\[u:\\\\], during which extra muscle movement is required and thus awkward to build a connection with its bilabial consonant \\\\[b\\\\]. The assimilation rule fails in this situation.\",\"timestamp\":1634575007,\"title\":\"About uber and über\"},\"digest\":\"lh7aFH_XZkqX9lPyUqxODo__oT8Kq6oNG5MJVa8WpJg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x078Ad5270b0240D8529f600f35A271Fc6E2b2bD8\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"D5httmuGt5JIWkrKtS9ym9V3NG4hGtYFGz3l1i86K2Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"pclQsT0hrI_n9PEH8v8NqgPiLe6IuodHHIpy8S6LaVU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"TzWccwLKT-f9cKYIUh2ZrEcpDBWPHag1PLmOvWmM_ILu2NivEbcdF88_ld3j6w76Rba1OZ2errGlIHC4wlCmZw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1b82974b47b5ed005b2712b7f31894027b9ccffc32003fc0ce523772b9a0c85d440625b6db0aba124325cf1177719976dba7c4eb4688f891dce956929a1e260e1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"D5httmuGt5JIWkrKtS9ym9V3NG4hGtYFGz3l1i86K2Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"pclQsT0hrI_n9PEH8v8NqgPiLe6IuodHHIpy8S6LaVU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"lh7aFH_XZkqX9lPyUqxODo__oT8Kq6oNG5MJVa8WpJg\"}"
