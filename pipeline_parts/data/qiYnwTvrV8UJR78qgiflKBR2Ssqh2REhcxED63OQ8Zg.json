"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I have a little money of my own from my mother's estate, which my father sends me by driblets.  I won a large sum this winter on the races, and I am beginning to sell my sketches. Laidpore is more and more pleased with my work; he says it grows in force and individuality.  I cannot judge of that myself, but I feel that I have gained in ease and confidence.  However, as I said, I have sold a good many through Laidpore.  I can live in the tiny house for little or nothing, with one servant.  Old Celestine, who works occasionally for me, says she will come stay with me and do my work.  I know I shall like it, like the feeling of freedom and independence.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What does your husband say?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have not told him yet.  I only thought of it this morning. He will think I am demented, no doubt.  Perhaps you think so.\\\"\\n\\nMademoiselle shook her head slowly.  \\\"Your reason is not yet clear to me,\\\" she said.\\n\\nNeither was it quite clear to Edna herself; but it unfolded itself as she sat for a while in silence.  Instinct had prompted her to put away her husband's bounty in casting off her allegiance. She did not know how it would be when he returned.  There would have to be an understanding, an explanation.  Conditions would some way adjust themselves, she felt; but whatever came, she had resolved never again to belong to another than herself.\\n\\n\\\"I shall give a grand dinner before I leave the old house!\\\" Edna exclaimed.  \\\"You will have to come to it, Mademoiselle. I will give you everything that you like to eat and to drink. We shall sing and laugh and be merry for once.\\\" And she uttered a sigh that came from the very depths of her being.\\n\\nIf Mademoiselle happened to have received a letter from Robert during the interval of Edna's visits, she would give her the letter unsolicited.  And she would seat herself at the piano and play as her humor prompted her while the young woman read the letter.\\n\\nThe little stove was roaring; it was red-hot, and the chocolate in the tin sizzled and sputtered.  Edna went forward and opened the stove door, and Mademoiselle rising, took a letter from under the bust of Beethoven and handed it to Edna.\\n\\n\\\"Another! so soon!\\\" she exclaimed, her eyes filled with delight.  \\\"Tell me, Mademoiselle, does he know that I see his letters?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Never in the world!  He would be angry and would never write to me again if he thought so.  Does he write to you?  Never a line. Does he send you a message?  Never a word.  It is because he loves you, poor fool, and is trying to forget you, since you are not free to listen to him or to belong to him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why do you show me his letters, then?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Haven't you begged for them?  Can I refuse you anything?  Oh! you cannot deceive me,\\\" and Mademoiselle approached her beloved instrument and began to play.  Edna did not at once read the letter.  She sat holding it in her hand, while the music penetrated her whole being like an effulgence, warming and brightening the dark places of her soul.  It prepared her for joy and exultation.\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\" she exclaimed, letting the letter fall to the floor. \\\"Why did you not tell me?\\\"  She went and grasped Mademoiselle's hands up from the keys.  \\\"Oh! unkind! malicious! Why did you not tell me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That he was coming back?  No great news, ma foi.  I wonder he did not come long ago.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But when, when?\\\" cried Edna, impatiently.  \\\"He does not say when.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He says \\\\`very soon.' You know as much about it as I do; it is all in the letter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But why?  Why is he coming?  Oh, if I thought--\\\" and she snatched the letter from the floor and turned the pages this way and that way, looking for the reason, which was left untold.\\n\\n\\\"If I were young and in love with a man,\\\" said Mademoiselle, turning on the stool and pressing her wiry hands between her knees as she looked down at Edna, who sat on the floor holding the letter, \\\"it seems to me he would have to be some grand esprit; a man with lofty aims and ability to reach them; one who stood high enough to attract the notice of his fellow-men.  It seems to me if I were young and in love I should never deem a man of ordinary caliber worthy of my devotion.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Now it is you who are telling lies and seeking to deceive me, Mademoiselle; or else you have never been in love, and know nothing about it.  Why,\\\" went on Edna, clasping her knees and looking up into Mademoiselle's twisted face, \\\"do you suppose a woman knows why she loves?  Does she select?  Does she say to herself: `Go to!  Here is a distinguished statesman with presidential possibilities; I shall proceed to fall in love with him.' Or, `I shall set my heart upon this musician, whose fame is on every tongue?'  Or, \\\\`This financier, who controls the world's money markets?'\\n\\n\\\"You are purposely misunderstanding me, ma reine.  Are you in love with Robert?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Edna.  It was the first time she had admitted it, and a glow overspread her face, blotching it with red spots.\\n\\n\\\"Why?\\\" asked her companion.  \\\"Why do you love him when you ought not to?\\\"\\n\\nEdna, with a motion or two, dragged herself on her knees before Mademoiselle Reisz, who took the glowing face between her two hands.\\n\\n\\\"Why?  Because his hair is brown and grows away from his temples; because he opens and shuts his eyes, and his nose is a little out of drawing; because he has two lips and a square chin, and a little finger which he can't straighten from having played baseball too energetically in his youth.  Because--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because you do, in short,\\\" laughed Mademoiselle.  \\\"What will you do when he comes back?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\\"Do?  Nothing, except feel glad and happy to be alive.\\\"\\n\\nShe was already glad and happy to be alive at the mere thought of his return.  The murky, lowering sky, which had depressed her a few hours before, seemed bracing and invigorating as she splashed through the streets on her way home.\\n\\nShe stopped at a confectioner's and ordered a huge box of bonbons for the children in Iberville.  She slipped a card in the box, on which she scribbled a tender message and sent an abundance of kisses.\\n\\nBefore dinner in the evening Edna wrote a charming letter to her husband, telling him of her intention to move for a while into the little house around the block, and to give a farewell dinner before leaving, regretting that he was not there to share it, to help out with the menu and assist her in entertaining the guests. Her letter was brilliant and brimming with cheerfulness.\\n\\nXXVII\\n\\n\\\"What is the matter with you?\\\" asked Arobin that evening.  \\\"I never found you in such a happy mood.\\\" Edna was tired by that time, and was reclining on the lounge before the fire.\\n\\n\\\"Don't you know the weather prophet has told us we shall see the sun pretty soon?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, that ought to be reason enough,\\\" he acquiesced.  \\\"You wouldn't give me another if I sat here all night imploring you.\\\" He sat close to her on a low tabouret, and as he spoke his fingers lightly touched the hair that fell a little over her forehead.  She liked the touch of his fingers through her hair, and closed her eyes sensitively.\\n\\n\\\"One of these days,\\\" she said, \\\"I'm going to pull myself together for a while and think--try to determine what character of a woman I am; for, candidly, I don't know.  By all the codes which I am acquainted with, I am a devilishly wicked specimen of the sex. But some way I can't convince myself that I am.  I must think about it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't.  What's the use?  Why should you bother thinking about it when I can tell you what manner of woman you are.\\\" His fingers strayed occasionally down to her warm, smooth cheeks and firm chin, which was growing a little full and double.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes!  You will tell me that I am adorable; everything that is captivating.  Spare yourself the effort.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No; I shan't tell you anything of the sort, though I shouldn't be lying if I did.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you know Mademoiselle Reisz?\\\" she asked irrelevantly.\\n\\n\\\"The pianist?  I know her by sight.  I've heard her play.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She says queer things sometimes in a bantering way that you don't notice at the time and you find yourself thinking  about afterward.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For instance?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, for instance, when I left her to-day, she put her arms around me and felt my shoulder blades, to see if my wings were strong, she said.  \\\\`The bird that would soar above the level plain of tradition and prejudice must have strong wings.  It is a sad spectacle to see the weaklings bruised, exhausted, fluttering back to earth.' \\\"Whither would you soar?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm not thinking of any extraordinary flights.  I only half comprehend her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've heard she's partially demented,\\\" said Arobin.\\n\\n\\\"She seems to me wonderfully sane,\\\" Edna replied.\\n\\n\\\"I'm told she's extremely disagreeable and unpleasant.  Why have you introduced her at a moment when I desired to talk of you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh! talk of me if you like,\\\" cried Edna, clasping her hands beneath her head; \\\"but let me think of something else while you do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm jealous of your thoughts tonight.  They're making you a little kinder than usual; but some way I feel as if they were wandering, as if they were not here with me.\\\" She only looked at him and smiled.  His eyes were very near.  He leaned upon the lounge with an arm extended across her, while the other hand still rested upon her hair.  They continued silently to look into each other's eyes.  When he leaned forward and kissed her, she clasped his head, holding his lips to hers.\\n\\nIt was the first kiss of her life to which her nature had really responded.  It was a flaming torch that kindled desire.\\n\\nXXVIII\\n\\nEdna cried a little that night after Arobin left her.  It was only one phase of the multitudinous emotions which had assailed her.  There was with her an overwhelming feeling of irresponsibility.  There was the shock of the unexpected and the unaccustomed.  There was her husband's reproach looking at her from the external things around her which he had provided for her external existence.  There was Robert's reproach making itself felt by a quicker, fiercer, more overpowering love, which had awakened within her toward him.  Above all, there was understanding.  She felt as if a mist had been lifted from her eyes, enabling her to took upon and comprehend the significance of life, that monster made up of beauty and brutality.  But among the conflicting sensations which assailed her, there was neither shame nor remorse. There was a dull pang of regret because it was not the kiss of love which had inflamed her, because it was not love which had held this cup of life to her lips.\\n\\nXXIX\\n\\nWithout even waiting for an answer from her husband regarding his opinion or wishes in the matter, Edna hastened her preparations for quitting her home on Esplanade Street and moving into the little house around the block.  A feverish anxiety attended her every action in that direction.  There was no moment of deliberation, no interval of repose between the thought and its fulfillment. Early  upon the morning following those hours passed in Arobin's society, Edna set about securing her new abode and hurrying her arrangements for occupying it. Within the precincts of her home she felt like one who has entered and lingered within the portals of some forbidden temple in which a thousand muffled voices bade her begone.\\n\\nWhatever was her own in the house, everything which she had acquired aside from her husband's bounty, she caused to be transported to the other house, supplying simple and meager deficiencies from her own resources.\\n\\nArobin found her with rolled sleeves, working in company with the house-maid when he looked in during the afternoon.  She was splendid and robust, and had never appeared handsomer than in the old blue gown, with a red silk handkerchief knotted at random around her head to protect her hair from the dust.  She was mounted upon a high stepladder, unhooking a picture from the wall when he entered.  He had found the front door open, and had followed his ring by walking in unceremoniously.\\n\\n\\\"Come down!\\\" he said.  \\\"Do you want to kill yourself?\\\" She greeted him with affected carelessness, and appeared absorbed in her occupation.\\n\\nIf he had expected to find her languishing, reproachful, or indulging in sentimental tears, he must have been greatly surprised.\\n\\nHe was no doubt prepared for any emergency, ready for any one of the foregoing attitudes, just as he bent himself easily and naturally to the situation which confronted him.\\n\\n\\\"Please come down,\\\" he insisted, holding the ladder and looking up at her.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" she answered; \\\"Ellen is afraid to mount the ladder.  Joe is working over at the \\\\`pigeon house'--that's the name Ellen gives it, because it's so small and looks like a pigeon house--and some one has to do this.\\\"\\n\\nArobin pulled off his coat, and expressed himself ready and willing to tempt fate in her place.  Ellen brought him one of her dust-caps, and went into contortions of mirth, which she found it impossible to control, when she saw him put it on before the mirror as grotesquely as he could.  Edna herself could not refrain from smiling when she fastened it at his request.  So it was he who in turn mounted the ladder, unhooking pictures and curtains, and dislodging ornaments as Edna directed.  When he had finished he took off his dust-cap and went out to wash his hands.\\n\\nEdna was sitting on the tabouret, idly brushing the tips of a feather duster along the carpet when he came in again.\\n\\n\\\"Is there anything more you will let me do?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\\"That is all,\\\" she answered.  \\\"Ellen can manage the rest.\\\" She kept the young woman occupied in the drawing-room, unwilling to be left alone with Arobin.\\n\\n\\\"What about the dinner?\\\" he asked; \\\"the grand event, the coup d'etat?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It will be day after to-morrow.  Why do you call it the \\\\`coup d'etat?' Oh! it will be very fine; all my best of everything--crystal, silver and gold, Sevres, flowers, music, and champagne to swim in.  I'll let Leonce pay the bills.  I wonder what he'll say when he sees the bills.\\n\\n\\\"And you ask me why I call it a coup d'etat?\\\" Arobin had put on his coat, and he stood before her and asked if his cravat was plumb.  She told him it was, looking no higher than the tip of his collar.\\n\\n\\\"When do you go to the \\\\`pigeon house?'--with all due acknowledgment to Ellen.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Day after to-morrow, after the dinner.  I shall sleep there.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ellen, will you very kindly get me a glass of water?\\\" asked Arobin.  \\\"The dust in the curtains, if you will pardon me for hinting such a thing, has parched my throat to a crisp.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"While Ellen gets the water,\\\" said Edna, rising, \\\"I will say good-by and let you go.  I must get rid of this grime, and I have a million things to do and think of.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"When shall I see you?\\\" asked Arobin, seeking to detain her, the maid having left the room.\\n\\n\\\"At the dinner, of course.  You are invited.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not before?--not to-night or to-morrow morning or tomorrow noon or night? or the day after morning or noon?  Can't you see yourself, without my telling you, what an eternity it is?\\\"\\n\\nHe had followed her into the hall and to the foot of the stairway, looking up at her as she mounted with her face half turned to him.\\n\\n\\\"Not an instant sooner,\\\" she said.  But she laughed and looked at him with eyes that at once gave him courage to wait and made it torture to wait.\",\"timestamp\":1639988916,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"Oh!  I see there is no deceiving you.
