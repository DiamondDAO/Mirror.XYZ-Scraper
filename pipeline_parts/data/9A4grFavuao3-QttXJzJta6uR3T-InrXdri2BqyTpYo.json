"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"It is in their presence that you will finish your education.  The final school for the actor is his audience; they are the necessary complement to the exercise of his art, and it is by the impression he produces on them that he will ultimately stand or fall; on their verdict, and on their verdict alone, will his success or failure as an artist depend.  But, if you have followed carefully, assiduously, the course of instruction now open to you, when the time has arrived for you to face an audience you will start with a very considerable handicap in your favour.  If you have learnt to move well and to speak well, to be clear in your enunciation and graceful in your bearing, you are bound to arrest at once the attention of any audience, no matter where it may be, before whom you appear.  Obvious and necessary as are these two acquirements of graceful bearing and correct diction, they are not so generally diffused as to cease to be remarkable.  Consequently, however modest your beginning on the stage, however short the part you may be called upon to play, you should find immediately the benefit of your training.  You may have to unlearn a certain amount, or rather to mould and shape what you have learnt to your new conditions, but if you have been well grounded in the essential elements of an actor's education, you will stand with an enormous advantage over such of your competitors as have waited till they go into a theatre to learn what can be acquired just as well, better, more thoroughly, outside it.\\n\\nIt has been my object to deal generally with the actor's calling, a calling, difficult and hazardous in character, demanding much patience, self-reliance, determination, and good temper.  This last is not one of its least important demands on your character.  Remember that the actor is not in one sense of the word an independent artist; it is his misfortune that the practice of his art is absolutely dependent on the fulfilment of elaborate external conditions.  The painter, the musician, so long as they can find paint and canvas, ink and paper, can work at their art, alone, independent of external circumstances.  Not so the actor.  Before he can act, the theatre, the play, scenery, company, these requisites, not by any means too easy to find, must be provided.  And then it is in the company of others, his colleagues, that his work has to be done.  Consequently patience, good temper, fairness, unselfishness are qualities be will do well to cultivate, and he will lose nothing, rather gain, by the exercise of them.  The selfish actor is not a popular person, and, in my experience, not as a rule a successful one.  \\\"Give and take,\\\" in this little world of the theatre, and you will be no losers by it.\\n\\nLearn to bear failure and criticism patiently.  They are part of the actor's lot in life.  Critics are rarely animated by any personal hostility in what they may write about you, though I confess that when one reads an unfavourable criticism, one is inclined to set it down to anything but one's own deserving.  I heard a great actor once say that we should never read criticisms of ourselves till a week after they were written--admirable counsel--but I confess I have not yet reached that pitch of self-restraint that would enable me to overcome my curiosity for seven days.  It is, however, a state of equanimity to look forward to.  In the meantime, content yourself with the recollection that ridicule and damning criticism have been the lot at some time in their lives of the most famous actors and actresses, that the unfavourable verdict of to-day may be reversed to-morrow.  It is no good resenting failure; turn it to account rather; try to understand it, and learn something from it.  The uses of theatrical adversity may not be sweet, but rightly understood they may be very salutary.\\n\\nDo not let failure make you despond.  Ours is a calling of ups and downs; it is an advantage of its uncertainty that you never know what may happen next; the darkest hour may he very near the dawn.  This is where Bohemianism, in the best sense of the term, will serve the actor.  I do not mean by Bohemianism chronic intemperance and insolvency.  I mean the gay spirit of daring and enterprise that greets failure as graciously as success; the love of your own calling and your comrades in that calling, a love that, no matter what your measure of success, will ever remain constant and enduring; the recognition of the fact that as an actor you but consult your own dignity in placing your own calling as a thing apart, in leading such a life as the necessities of that calling may demand; and choosing your friends among those who regard you for yourself, not those to whom an actor is a social puppet, to be taken up and dropped as he happens for the moment to be more or less prominent in the public eye. If this kind of Bohemianism has some root in your character, you will find the changes and chances of your calling the easier to endure.\\n\\nFAILURE AND SUCCESS\\n\\nDo not despond in failure, neither be over-exalted by success. Remember one success is as nothing in the history of an actor's career; he has to make many before he can lay claim to any measure of fame; and over-confidence, an inability to estimate rightly the value of a passing triumph, has before now harmed incalculably many an actor or actress.  You will only cease to learn your business when you quit it; look on success as but another lesson learnt to be turned to account in learning the next.  The art of the actor is no less difficult, no less long in comparison with life, than any other art. In the intoxicating hour of success let this chastening thought have some place in your recollection.\\n\\nWhen you begin work as actors or actresses, play whenever you can and whatever you can.  Remember that the great thing for the actor is to be seen as often as possible, to be before the public as much as he can, no matter how modest the part, how insignificant the production. It is only when an actor has reached a position very secure in the public esteem that he can afford, or that it may be his duty, to be careful as to what he undertakes.  But before such a time is reached his one supreme object must be to get himself known to the public, to let them see his work under all conditions, until they find something to identify as peculiarly his own; he should think nothing too small or unimportant to do, too tiresome or laborious to undergo.  Work well and conscientiously done must attract attention; there is a great deal of lolling and idleness among the many thoughtless and indifferent persons who drift on to the stage as the last refuge of the negligent or incompetent.\\n\\nThe stage will always attract a certain number of worthless recruits because it is so easy to get into the theatre somehow or other; there is no examination to be passed, no qualification to be proved before a person is entitled to call himself an actor.  And then the life of an actor is unfortunately, in these days of long runs, one that lends itself to a good deal of idleness and waste of time, unless a man or woman be very determined to employ their spare time profitably.  For this reason, I should advise any actor, or actress, to cultivate some rational hobby or interest by the side of their work; for until the time comes for an actor to assume the cares and labours of management, he must have a great deal of time on his hands that can be better employed than in hanging about clubs or lolling in drawing-rooms.  At any rate, the actor or actress who thinks no work too small to do, and to do to the utmost of his or her ability, who neglects no opportunity that may be turned to account--and every line he or she speaks is an opportunity--must outstrip those young persons who, though they may be pleased to call themselves actors and actresses, never learn to regard the theatre as anything but a kind of enlarged back-drawing-room, in which they are invited to amuse themselves at an altogether inadequate salary.\\n\\nIn regard to salary, when you start in your profession, do not make salary your first consideration; do not suffer a few shillings or a pound or two to stand between you and work.  This is a consideration you may keep well in mind, even when you have achieved some measure of success.  Apart from the natural tendency of the individual to place a higher value on his services than that attached to them by others, it is often well to take something less than you ask, if the work offered you is useful.  Remember that the public judge you by your work, they know nothing and care little about what is being paid you for doing it.  To some people their own affairs are of such supreme importance that they cannot believe that their personal concerns are unknown to, and unregarded by, the outside world.  The intensely personal, individual character of the actor's work is bound to induce a certain temptation to an exaggerated egotism.  We are all egotists, and it is right that we should be, up to a point.  But I would urge the young actor or actress to be always on the watch against developing, especially in success, an extreme egotism which induces a selfishness of outlook, an egregious vanity that in the long run weakens the character, induces disappointment and discontent, and bores to extinction other persons.\\n\\nI would not for one moment advise an actor never to talk \\\"shop\\\"; it is a great mistake to think that men and women should never talk in public or private about the thing to which they devote their lives; people, as a rule, are most interesting on the subject of their own particular business in life.  Talk about the affairs of the theatre within reason, and with due regard to the amenities of polite conversation, but do not confuse the affairs of the theatre, broadly speaking, with your own.  The one is lasting, general; the other particular and fleeting.  \\\"*Il n'y a pas de l'homme necessaire*\\\" \\\\[No man is indispensable\\\\].  Many persons would be strangely surprised if they could see how rapidly their place is filled after they are gone, no matter how considerable their achievement.  It may not be filled in the same way, as well, as fittingly, but it will be filled, and humanity will content itself very fairly well with the substitute. This is especially true of the work of the actor.  He can but live as a memory, and memory is proverbially short.\\n\\nELLEN TERRY\\n\\n\\\\[In the autumn of 1883, during Henry Irving's fist engagement in New York, Ellen Terry played a round of characters as his leading lady. In the *Tribune*, Mr. William Winter said:  \\\"Miss Ellen Terry's Portia is delicious.  Her voice is perfect music.  Her clear, bell-like elocution is more than a refreshment, it is a luxury.  Her simple manner, always large and adequate, is a great beauty of the art which it so deftly conceals.  Her embodiment of a woman's loveliness, such as, in Portia, should he at once stately and fascinating and inspire at once respect and passion, was felicitous beyond the reach of descriptive phrases.\\\"  Then, on her appearance in \\\"Much Ado About Nothing:\\\" \\\"She permeates the raillery of Beatrice with an indescribable charm of mischievous sweetness.  The silver arrows of her pungent wit have no barb, for evidently she does not mean that they shall really wound.  Her appearance and carriage are beautiful, and her tones melt into music.  There is no hint of the virago here, and even the tone of sarcasm is superficial.  It is archness playing over kindness that is presented here.\\\"  On her Ophelia, Mr. Winter remarks: \\\"Ophelia is an image, or personification of innocent, delirious, feminine youth and beauty, and she passes before us in the two stages of sanity and delirium.  The embodiment is fully within Miss Terry's reach, and is one of the few unmistakably perfect creations with which dramatic art has illumined literature and adorned the stage.\\\"\\n\\nBy permission the following pages have been taken from \\\"Ellen Terry's Memoirs,\\\" copyright by the S. S. McClure Company, 1908.  All rights reserved.  ED.)\\n\\nHAMLET--IRVING'S GREATEST PART\\n\\nWhen I went with Coghlan to see Henry Irving's Philip I was no stranger to his acting.  I had been present with Tom Taylor, then dramatic critic of the *Times*, at the famous first night at the Lyceum, in 1874, when Henry put his fortune--counted, not in gold, but in years of scorned delights and laborious days, years of constant study and reflection, of Spartan self-denial and deep melancholy--when he put it all to the touch \\\"to win or lose it all.\\\"  This is no exaggeration.  Hamlet was by far the greatest part that he had ever played or ever was to play.  If he had failed--but why pursue it?  He could not fail.\\n\\nYet, the success on the first night at the Lyceum, in 1874, was not of that electrical, almost hysterical splendour which has greeted the momentous achievements of some actors.  The first two acts were received with indifference.  The people could not see how packed they were with superb acting--perhaps because the new Hamlet was so simple, so quiet, so free from the exhibition of actors' artifices which used to bring down the house in \\\"Louis XI\\\" and in \\\"Richelieu,\\\" but which were really the easy things in acting, and in \\\"Richelieu\\\" (in my opinion) not especially well done.  In \\\"Hamlet\\\" Henry Irving did not go to the audience; he made them come to him.  Slowly, but surely, attention gave place to admiration, admiration to enthusiasm, enthusiasm to triumphant acclaim.\\n\\nI have seen many Hamlets,--Fechter, Charles Kean, Rossi, Friedrich Haase, Forbes-Robertson, and my own son, Gordon Craig, among them,--but they were not in the same hemisphere!  I refuse to go and see Hamlets now.  I want to keep Henry Irving's fresh and clear in my memory until I die.\\n\\nTHE BIRMINGHAM NIGHT\\n\\nWhen he engaged me to play Ophelia in 1878, he asked me to go down to Birmingham to see the play, and that night I saw what I shall always consider the perfection of acting.  It had been wonderful in 1874; in 1878 it was far more wonderful.  It has been said that when he had the \\\"advantage\\\" of my Ophelia his Hamlet \\\"improved.\\\"  I don't think so; he was always quite independent of the people with whom he acted.\\n\\nThe Birmingham night he knew I was there.  He played--I say it without vanity--for me.  We players are not above that weakness, if it be a weakness.  If ever anything inspires us to do our best, it is the presence in the audience of some fellow-artist who must, in the nature of things, know more completely than any one what we intend, what we do, what we feel.  The response from such a member of the audience flies across the footlights to us like a flame.  I felt it once when I played Olivia before Eleonora Duse.  I felt that she felt it once when she played Marguerite Gautier for me.\\n\\nWhen I read \\\"Hamlet\\\" now, everything that Henry did in it seems to me more absolutely right even than I thought at the time.  I would give much to be able to record it all in detail, but--it may be my fault--writing is not the medium in which this can be done.  Sometimes I have thought of giving readings of \\\"Hamlet,\\\" for I can remember every tone of Henry's voice, every emphasis, every shade of meaning that he saw in the lines and made manifest to the discerning.  Yes, I think I could give some pale idea of what his Hamlet was if I read the play!\\n\\n\\\"Words, words, words!\\\"  What is it to say, for instance, that the cardinal qualities of his Prince of Denmark were strength, delicacy, distinction?  There was never a touch of commonness.  Whatever he did or said, blood and breeding pervaded it.\\n\\nTHE ENTRANCE SCENE IN \\\"HAMLET\\\"\\n\\nHis \\\"make-up\\\" was very pale, and this made his face beautiful when one was close to him, but at a distance it gave him a haggard look.  Some said he looked twice his age.\\n\\nHe kept three things going at the same time--the antic madness, the sanity, the sense of the theatre.  The last was to all that he imagined and thought what, in the New Testament, charity is said to be to all other virtues.\\n\\nHe was never cross or moody--only melancholy.  His melancholy was as simple as it was profound.  It was touching, too, rather than defiant. You never thought that he was wantonly sad and enjoying his own misery.\\n\\nHe neglected no *coup de theatre* \\\\[theatrical artifice\\\\] to assist him, but who notices the servants when the host is present?\\n\\nFor instance, his first entrance as Hamlet was what we call, in theatrical parlance, very much \\\"worked up.\\\"  He was always a tremendous believer in processions, and rightly.  It is through such means that royalty keeps its hold on the feeling of the public and makes its mark as a figure and a symbol.  Henry Irving understood this.  Therefore, to music so apt that it was not remarkable in itself, but a contribution to the general excited anticipation, the court of Denmark came on to the stage.  I understood later on, at the Lyceum, what days of patient work had gone to the making of that procession.\\n\\nAt its tail, when the excitement was at fever-heat, came the solitary figure of Hamlet, looking extraordinarily tall and thin, The lights were turned down--another stage trick--to help the effect that the figure was spirit rather than man.\\n\\nHe was weary; his cloak trailed on the ground.  He did not wear the miniature of his father obtrusively round his neck!  His attitude was one which I have seen in a common little illustration to the \\\"Reciter,\\\" compiled by Dr. Pinch, Henry Irving's old schoolmaster. Yet, how right to have taken it, to have been indifferent to its humble origin!  Nothing could have been better when translated into life by Irving's genius.\\n\\nThe hair looked blue-black, like the plumage of a crow; the eyes burning--two fires veiled, as yet, by melancholy.  But the appearance of the man was not single, straight, or obvious, as it is when I describe it, any more than his passions throughout the play were.  I only remember one moment when his intensity concentrated itself in a straightforward unmistakable emotion, without side-current or back water.  It was when he said:\\n\\nThe play's the thing Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King\\n\\nand, as the curtain came down, was seen to be writing madly on his tablets against one of the pillars.\\n\\n\\\"0 God, that I were a writer!\\\"  I paraphrase Beatrice with all my heart.  Surely a writer could not string words together about Henry Irving's Hamlet and say nothing, nothing.\\n\\n\\\"We must start this play a living thing,\\\" he used to say at rehearsals, and he worked until the skin grew tight over his face, until he became livid with fatigue, yet still beautiful, to get the opening lines said with individuality, suggestiveness, speed, and power:\\n\\n*Bernardo*:    Who's there? *Francisco*:   Nay, answer me:  stand, and unfold yourself. *Bernardo*:    Long live the king! *Francisco*:   Bernardo? *Bernardo*:    He. *Francisco*:   You come most carefully upon your hour. *Bernardo*:    'Tis now struck twelve: get thee to bed, Francisco. *Francisco*:   For this relief much thanks: 't is bitter cold.\\n\\nAnd all that he tried to make others do with these lines he himself did with every line of his own part.  Every word lived.\\n\\nSome said: \\\"Oh, Irving only makes 'Hamlet' a love poem!\\\"  They said that, I suppose, because in the nunnery scene with Ophelia he was the lover above the prince and the poet.  With what passionate longing his hands hovered over Ophelia at her words, \\\"Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind!\\\"\\n\\nTHE SCENE WITH THE PLAYERS\\n\\nHis advice to the players was not advice.  He did not speak it as an actor.  Nearly all Hamlets in that scene give away the fact that they are actors and not dilettanti of royal blood.  Henry defined the way he would have the players speak as an order, an instruction of the merit of which he was regally sure.  There was no patronising flavour in his acting here, not a touch of \\\"I'11 teach you how to do it.\\\"  He was swift, swift and simple--pausing for the right word now and again, as in the phrase \\\"to hold as 't were the mirror up to nature.\\\"  His slight pause and eloquent gesture, as the all embracing word \\\"nature\\\" came in answer to his call, were exactly repeated unconsciously, years later, by the Queen of Roumania (Carmen Sylva).  She was telling us the story of a play that she had written.  The words rushed out swiftly, but occasionally she would wait for the one that expressed her meaning most comprehensively and exactly, and, as she got it, up went her hand in triumph over her head--\\\"Like yours in Hamlet,\\\" I told Henry at the time.\",\"timestamp\":1639987611,\"title\":\"\\nIt is to a public far larger, far more real and genuine than this, that you will one day have to appeal.\"},\"digest\":\"wwlUzvT3632icSI-oszFtOzTOg5VwOlTP-camfVugaY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6A321BD15f7B900C7F8Dd29Ce6ed73fa0E7D220F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JBitisM5Q1MFRDOEsMaBisJ15PNst2e7qZXgiH1yz50\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"GnHbRvbIkHA7MfzhU2tDnNQw211sVIw_qQTo2kEqUvo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"bsxpSp7nUX2myUcSViRBvV4hcM9IuGdlSFHF1rKw0GzKjASFKrwlav89S0INEJXM4LQU0AT0PoxHioooHpxWEw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4f481d75229ebf9d6f242605b6d36f19b49aba734e0cd60a07565fab68fd68ba0ba16c572b5af02624eeafd6081b9f768551ae89675d33d1a3e2e13d7d785ac61b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JBitisM5Q1MFRDOEsMaBisJ15PNst2e7qZXgiH1yz50\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"GnHbRvbIkHA7MfzhU2tDnNQw211sVIw_qQTo2kEqUvo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wwlUzvT3632icSI-oszFtOzTOg5VwOlTP-camfVugaY\"}"
