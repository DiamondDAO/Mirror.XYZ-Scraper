"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### \\n\\n \\n  \\n 🏫 Background\\n\\n* Most developers learn to code quite early in their lives as teenagers, usually through school or because teachers encourage them.\\n* Had access to computers in their homes from an early age; wasn't common amongst their peers.\\n* However, computer science education in India is severely outdated. The tech and concepts that are still being taught, like HTML and PHP, are years old.\\n* Developers’ interest in programming and building software is largely self-initiated and self-motivated.\\n* They describe learning programming as ‘addictive’.\\n* They have a genuine curiosity for:\\n  * Learning how software is made and how it works\\n  * Solving problems\\n  * Hacking together solutions\\n  * ‘What's out there?’\\n* They enjoy the thrill of building something that will be used by other people, all over the world.\\n* There are lots of opportunities in tech, and since technology is everywhere, it creates the most impact.\\n  * *“As someone from a tier 2 city, it’s created a lot of opportunities for me (via platforms like Twitter, etc).”*\\n\\n### 🧠 Culture\\n\\n* Developers have to keep learning and updating their knowledge because the nature of software and technology is such that it constantly evolves.\\n  * *“If you have to learn, you have to keep doing more things. You’re unlikely to learn everything from your full-time job.”*\\n* Developers actively consume content and become aware of trends from Twitter, via newsletters and blogs.\\n  * Many young developers see content curation and creation as a means to learn more effectively.\\n    * *“If I curate, I can grasp more. And if I can share that with others, it’ll be helpful.”*\\n* Learning a new programming language is almost like learning a new language.\\n  * *“What I learn depends on what I want to make.”*\\n* ‘Learning by building’ is the most effective way that developers learn new skills and technologies.\\n  * By reading documentation, coding along, asking, and learning through forums and communities.\\n  * Videos are not very effective as a medium to learn.\\n    * *“Seeing videos doesn’t help. You see and then forget. Topics seem clear when you watch but hard to recall when doing.”*\\n* For developers, having a breadth of knowledge is an added advantage, but depth is more valuable.\\n\\n### 🪐 Community\\n\\n* **What makes for a good community:**\\n  * Thoughtful, smooth onboarding that doesn’t feel overwhelming for new members.\\n  * Active moderation (centralisation) by community managers or admins to maintain coherence, for new and old members, and to prevent spamming.\\n    * *“Web3 projects and communities can’t be totally decentralised; needs regulation otherwise there’ll be total chaos.”*\\n    * *“There needs to be centralised authority in the form of a core community and voting power with the broader community.”*\\n  * Incentives (implicit or explicit) that reward being genuinely helpful and kind to others in the community who are learning or asking questions.\\n  * Encouragement and celebration of community members’ wins (including but not limited to projects, learning milestones, contributions, etc.), even at the cost of some members potentially self-promoting or shilling their work.\\n    * *“It’s important to feel like I own a piece of the project. If credit is given I would feel loyal to a project or community.”*\\n  * A culture of ‘show and tell’ encourages members to present and show-off what they’re building to their peers. Members can share feedback or collaborate with project owners.\\n  * Good humour and a culture of creating, sharing, and enjoying memes.\\n    * *“Communities work as vibes right now since they mostly use Discord.”*\\n  * Align members to its values and convictions, communicate clearly and consistently.\\n  * Showcase for members who’ve ‘made it big’ with avenues to give back to the community that helped them get started.\\n    * *“I’d be loyal to a community that has helped in grow personally.”*\\n\\n### 📚 Open-source\\n\\n* The motivation to work on open-source projects is if the topic is interesting.\\n  * *“It’s not about giving back, it’s about using the project to learn and play.”*\\n* Developers earn a lot of visibility and credibility if their open-source project gains traction.\\n* Open-source is exciting for developers because of the ability to build on top and/or fork other developers' projects.\\n* It’s difficult to participate in open-source projects without a community. Navigating through documentation can be challenging.\\n\\n### 🌞 Web3\\n\\n* There are broadly two kinds of developers who are learning to build for web3:\\n  * Believers\\n    * *“If you ask me, the future is web3!”*\\n    * *“There’s no need for me to be learning and spending hours after my work learning web3, but I’m doing it purely out of interest in the technology.”*\\n  * Opportunists\\n    * *“It’s more about the opportunity in web3 rather than the tech to move full-time. I have a friend working full-time in web3, but he’s still earning less than me.”*\\n* Many developers believe in the future of web3 because the people they consider smart and credible believe in it and are moving towards web3.\\n* The web3 community and founders are extremely approachable and helpful. It's unfathomable to be able to similarly interact with web2 founders.\\n* The ‘skin in the game’ nature of web3 rewards good actors, higher quality and fewer trolls.\\n* The top reasons developers are attracted to blockchain technology and building in web3.\\n  * Built-in incentive structure with skin in the game.\\n    * *“There’s a new dimension to coding in web3. What we build can create value directly to and help the person who is contributing the most.”*\\n  * Everything is open-source by design, while still maintaining privacy.\\n  * Decentralisation\\n    * *“If you have the power to manipulate, you will. This is not possible with blockchain.”*\\n* Web3 is about one ↔ one interactions. The affinity is towards the people in the community, rather than the project itself. eg. BAYC, versus web2, where it's more a company ↔ individual consumer connection. eg. Apple.\\n* In web3, there is a sense that since it’s all very new, we're all learning this new technology together. So, there’s lot of sharing and mutual support.\\n  * *“I think web2 didn’t allow nice people to be that nice. Someone says something about Facebook and gets thrown out.”*\\n  * *“The space is early. There’s no guru. People make rules that Javascript should be like this. Here, a lot of people don’t know what’s happening.”*\\n  * “*I don’t have that much experience, I’m still learning but happy to help others learn.”*\\n* Crypto and web3 as a technology will fade away if people are attached and limited just to the currency aspect.\",\"timestamp\":1641279999,\"title\":\"Designing the Questbook brand.
