"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"All of us who are in crypto and using various dapps actively are grappled with one of the biggest questions of them all. Who will eventually win the Smart contract platform war? Let me give you my thoughts based on one simple fundamental - DNA.\\n\\nJust like every human has a unique DNA identifier attached to their biology, similar analogy can be taken to the blockchain world to explain what really sets the blockchain apart from one another. We all fall for the trap of measuring blockchains technically like TPS, block sizes, nodes etc. These technical parameters are quite important to understand one side of the equation but it fails to recognize the trajectory of where the particular blockchain is heading as it grows.\\n\\nEvery blockchain just like a cycle of a living organism goes through phases of development. Most are just in their early nascent stage and hence it becomes very important to understand their basic DNA which will help us to understand what habits they are going to acquire as it grows and matures over time.\\n\\nOne reason i am compelled to believe that because Ethereumâ€™s DNA is so much more different than all the other blockchains, it is heading to the phase of growth and maturity which will set it apart more and more as years role by. Ethereum celebrates innovation and creativity over status quo, public goods over private cabals, open source over closed source and most importantly collaboration over isolation. \\n\\nResultant actions which comes out of embracing those qualities leads to real path of relative decentralization, immutable property rights and censorship resistance which we all imagine to have in the future via crypto. Ethereum is one shot we have to realize this goal.\",\"timestamp\":1638879624,\"title\":\"Ethereum's DNA\"},\"digest\":\"1z73A2YZdisBem43d-dqMvzwE95j7ih3KHkMytJ5Qu8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x1dF2535cf0956AbEC21C4738534885d3849d6578\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"9WpZH-vJFhRypimGWpHhQCLdGXBoOZYv_q3rYzB8C6s\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"6p7hx-xX6GVOcEkYoNWniiSmrSKX1phIAlcJrmHj1aQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"4psPcXDfGAE6mokEkNUAa06fQMpqp8CosqWVE42lBmjFiHo1AO4oJ6tlxrdFG0vrLNY_129UyBE4r6_iAcoB7A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc099f8aa26c37a46ae20cd02ed7574cbf0571df2924039c6e16635e7eb27a9410800a1974725311382b7061ae14fd3268076b552564bd80e4a6c1eb24bde08fc1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"9WpZH-vJFhRypimGWpHhQCLdGXBoOZYv_q3rYzB8C6s\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"6p7hx-xX6GVOcEkYoNWniiSmrSKX1phIAlcJrmHj1aQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"1z73A2YZdisBem43d-dqMvzwE95j7ih3KHkMytJ5Qu8\"}"
