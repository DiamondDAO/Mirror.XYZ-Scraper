On December 19, according to official news, grimfinance, a compound income platform on fantom chain, suffered a lightning loan attack, and the current loss has exceeded US $30 million.

On December 19, according to a number of US media reports such as politico, US Democratic Senator manqin made it clear today that he opposed Biden's $1.75 trillion \\\"bill to rebuild a better future\\\". Since the Democratic Party and the Republican party currently hold 50 seats in the Senate, Manchin's vote will be related to whether the bill can be passed without the support of any Republican senator. Manchin's negative vote also means that Biden's bill will probably have to be postponed to January next year. The postponement of the plan will have a wide impact, even affecting next year's mid-term elections.\",\"timestamp\":1640007346,\"title\":\"Blockchain information\"},\"digest\":\"7rZ6W0FkIVzCNK4VpfWITg49lm2mvfDEWqilCwHKzao\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8D4E1BFa9BFA1404Aa02ef199cf8126e18b5aD1d\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zKEfaY6SOrDLqTpTwVDOa5Z_kfipgytObckpaJYJwDc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"898M3266yJ-X0nvdxaKmdNLC99yYDEkrh-3yvuLjmLc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Vl5gCyKIES6WLJi5nsVKShxGOK76y6coTL9U90UQIwJgT9lm2LxbVYc05Ofq8sgnK_zX6snEAdJdtd28uGE3AQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd548b5317663d973ccb22eb687219571c2ae788670c19aa6b76aa26e3137fd19407725a30213a3464726cc664b1ff0e3d09e1bdcc7993148676dff89b82c66ac1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zKEfaY6SOrDLqTpTwVDOa5Z_kfipgytObckpaJYJwDc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"898M3266yJ-X0nvdxaKmdNLC99yYDEkrh-3yvuLjmLc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"7rZ6W0FkIVzCNK4VpfWITg49lm2mvfDEWqilCwHKzao\"}"
