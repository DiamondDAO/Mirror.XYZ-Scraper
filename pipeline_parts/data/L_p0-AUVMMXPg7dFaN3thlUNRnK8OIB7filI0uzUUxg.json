"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"And opening the envelope, he showed the bank-note which he had taken from his own pocket-book.\\n\\nThis changed the matter entirely.  \\\"That is quite a different thing,\\\" remarked one of the waiters.  \\\"If you find money, you are, of course, responsible for it.  But just leave it here at the desk, and the next time the viscount comes in, the cashier will give it to him.\\\"\\n\\nA cold chill crept over Chupin at the thought of losing his bank- note in this way.  \\\"Ah! I don't fancy that idea!\\\" he exclaimed.  \\\"Leave it here? Never in life! Who'd get the reward? A viscount is always generous; it is quite likely he would give me twenty francs as a reward for my honesty.  And that's why I want his address.\\\"\\n\\nThe argument was of a nature to touch the waiters; they thought the young man quite right; but they did not know M. de Coralth's address, and they saw no way of procuring it.  \\\"Unless perhaps the porter knows,\\\" observed one of them.\\n\\nThe porter, on being called, remembered that he had once been sent to M. de Coralth's house for an overcoat.  \\\"I've forgotten his number,\\\" he declared; \\\"but he lives in the Rue d'Anjou, near the corner of the Rue de la Ville l'Eveque.\\\"\\n\\nThis direction was not remarkable for its precision, but it was more than sufficient for a pure-blooded Parisian like Victor Chupin.  \\\"Many thanks for your kindness,\\\" he said to the porter.  \\\"A blind man, perhaps, might not be able to go straight to M. de Coralth's house from your directions, but I have eyes and a tongue as well.  And, believe me, if there's any reward, you shall see that I know how to repay a good turn.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And if you don't find the viscount,\\\" added the waiters, \\\"bring the money here, and it will be returned to him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Naturally!\\\" replied Chupin.  And he strode hurriedly away.  \\\"Return!\\\" he muttered; \\\"not I!  I thought for a moment they had their hands on my precious bank-note.\\\"\\n\\nBut he had already recovered from his fright, and as he turned his steps homeward he congratulated himself on the success of his stratagem.  \\\"For my viscount is caught,\\\" he said to himself.  \\\"The Rue d'Anjou Saint Honore hasn't a hundred numbers in it, and even if I'm compelled to go from door to door, my task will soon be accomplished.\\\"\\n\\nOn reaching home he found his mother engaged in knitting, as usual.  This was the only avocation that her almost complete blindness allowed her to pursue; and she followed it constantly.  \\\"Ah! here you are, Toto,\\\" she exclaimed, joyously.  \\\"I didn't expect you so soon.  Don't you scent a savory smell? As you must be greatly tired after being up all night, I'm making you a stew.\\\"\\n\\nAs customary when he returned, Chupin embraced the good woman with the respectful tenderness which had so surprised M. Fortunat.  \\\"You are always kind,\\\" said he, \\\"but, unfortunately, I can't remain to dine with you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you promised me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's true, mamma; but business, you see--business.\\\"\\n\\nThe worthy woman shook her head.  \\\"Always business!\\\" she exclaimed.\\n\\n\\\"Yes--when a fellow hasn't ten thousand francs a year.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have become a worker, Toto, and that makes me very happy; but you are too eager for money, and that frightens me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's to say, you fear I shall do something dishonest.  Ah! mother! do you think I can forget you and Monsieur Andre?\\\"\\n\\nHis mother said no more, and he entered the tiny nook which he so pompously styled his chamber, and quickly changed the clothes he was wearing (his Sunday toggery) for an old pair of checked trousers, a black blouse, and a glazed cap.  And when he had finished, and given a peculiar turn to his hair, no one would have recognized him.  In place of M. Fortunat's respectable clerk, there appeared one of those vagabonds who hang about cafes and theatres from six in the evening till midnight, and spend the rest of their time playing cards in the low drinking dens near the barrieres.  It was the old Chupin come to life once more--Toto Chupin as he had appeared before his conversion.  And as he took a last look in the little glass hanging over the table, he was himself astonished at the transformation.  \\\"Ah!\\\" he muttered, \\\"I was a sorry looking devil in those days.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough he had cautiously avoided making any noise in dressing, his mother, with the wonderfully acute hearing of the blind, had followed each of his movements as surely as if she had been standing near watching him.  \\\"You have changed your clothes, Toto,\\\" she remarked.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, mother.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But why have you put on your blouse, my son?\\\"\\n\\nAlthough accustomed to his mother's remarkable quickness of perception, he was amazed.  Still he did not think of denying it.  She would only have to extend her hand to prove that he was telling a falsehood.  The blind woman's usually placid face had become stern.  \\\"So it is necessary to disguise yourself,\\\" she said, gravely.\\n\\n\\\"But, mother----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hush, my son! When a man doesn't wish to be recognized, he's evidently doing something he's ashamed of.  Ever since your employer came here, you have been concealing something from me.  Take care, Toto! Since I heard that man's voice, I'm sure that he is quite as capable of urging you to commit a crime as others were in days gone by.\\\"\\n\\nThe blind woman was preaching to a convert; for during the past three days, M. Fortunat had shown himself in such a light that Chupin had secretly resolved to change his employer.  \\\"I promise you I'll leave him, mother,\\\" he declared, \\\"so you may be quite easy in mind.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well; but now, at this moment, where are you going?\\\"\\n\\nThere was only one way of completely reassuring the good woman, and that was to tell her all.  Chupin did so with absolute frankness.  \\\"Ah, well!\\\" she said, when the narrative was finished.  \\\"You see now how easy it is to lead you astray! How could you be induced to play the part of a spy, when you know so well what it leads to? It's only God's protecting care that has saved you again from an act which you would have reproached yourself for all your life.  Your employer's intentions are good now; but they WERE criminal when he ordered you to follow Madame d'Argeles.  Poor woman! She had sacrificed herself for her son, she had concealed herself from him, and you were working to betray her.  Poor creature! how she must have suffered, and how much I pity her! To be what she is, and to see herself denounced by her own son! I, who am only a poor plebeian, should die of shame under such circumstances.\\\"\\n\\nChupin blew his nose so loudly that the window-panes rattled; this was his way of repressing his emotion whenever it threatened to overcome him.  \\\"You speak like the good mother that you are,\\\" he exclaimed at last,\\\" and I'm prouder of you than if you were the handsomest and richest lady in Paris, for you're certainly the most honest and virtuous; and I should be a thorough scoundrel if I caused you a moment's sorrow.  And if ever I set my foot in such a mess again, I hope some one will cut it off.  But for this once----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For this once, you may go, Toto; I give my consent.\\\"\\n\\nHe went off with a lighter heart; and on reaching the Rue d'Anjou he immediately began his investigations. They were not successful at first.  At every house where he made inquiries nobody had any knowledge of the Viscount de Coralth.  He had visited half the buildings in the street, when he reached one of the handsomest houses, in front of which stood a cart laden with plants and flowers.  An old man, who seemed to be the concierge, and a valet in a red waistcoat, were removing the plants from the vehicle and arranging them in a line under the porte cochere.  As soon as the cart was emptied, it drove away, whereupon Chupin stepped forward, and addressing the concierge, asked: \\\"Does the Viscount de Coralth live here?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.  What do you want with him?\\\"\\n\\nHaving foreseen this question, Chupin had prepared a reply.  \\\"I certainly don't come to call on him,\\\" he answered.  \\\"My reason for inquiring is this: just now, as I passed near the Madeleine, a very elegant lady called me, and said: 'M. de Coralth lives in the Rue d'Anjou, but I've forgotten the number.  I can't go about from door to door making inquiries, so if you'll go there and ascertain his address for me, I'll give you five francs for yourself,' so my money's made.\\\"\\n\\nProfiting by his old Parisian experience, Chupin had chosen such a clever excuse that both his listeners heartily laughed.  \\\"Well, Father Moulinet,\\\" cried the servant in the red waistcoat, \\\"what do you say to that? Are there any elegant ladies who give five francs for YOUR address?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is there any lady who's likely to send such flowers as these to YOU?\\\" was the response.\\n\\nChupin was about to retire with a bow, when the concierge stopped him.  \\\"You accomplish your errands so well that perhaps you'd be willing to take these flower-pots up to the second floor, if we gave you a glass of wine!\\\"\\n\\nNo proposal could have suited Chupin better.  Although he was prone to exaggerate his own powers and the fecundity of his resources, he had not flattered himself with the hope that he should succeed in crossing the threshold of M. de Coralth's rooms.  For, without any great mental effort, he had realized that the servant arrayed in the red waistcoat was in the viscount's employ, and these flowers were to be carried to his apartments.  However any signs of satisfaction would have seemed singular under the circumstances, and so he sulkily replied: \\\"A glass of wine! you had better say two.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I'll say a whole bottleful.  my boy, if that suits you any better,\\\" replied the servant, with the charming good-nature so often displayed by people who are giving other folk's property away.\\n\\n\\\"Then I'm at your service!\\\" exclaimed Chupin.  And, loading himself with a host of flower-pots as skilfully as if he had been accustomed to handling them all his life, he added: \\\"Now, lead the way.\\\"\\n\\nThe valet and the concierge preceded him with empty hands, of course; and, on reaching the second floor, they opened a door, and said: \\\"This is the place.  Come in.\\\"\\n\\nChupin had expected to find that M. de Coralth's apartments were handsomer than his own in the Faubourg Saint Denis; but he had scarcely imagined such luxury as pervaded this establishment.  The chandeliers seemed marvels in his eyes; and the sumptuous chairs and couches eclipsed M. Fortunat's wonderful sofa completely.  \\\"So he no longer amuses himself with petty rascalities,\\\" thought Chupin, as he surveyed the rooms.  \\\"Monsieur's working on a grand scale now.  Decidedly this mustn't be allowed to continue.\\\"\\n\\nThereupon he busied himself placing the flowers in the numerous jardinieres scattered about the rooms, as well as in a tiny conservatory, cleverly contrived on the balcony, and adjoining a little apartment with silk hangings, that was used as a smoking- room.  Under the surveillance of the concierge and the valet he was allowed to visit the whole apartments.  He admired the drawing-room, filled to overflowing with costly trifles; the dining-room, furnished in old oak; the luxurious bed-room with its bed mounted upon a platform, as if it were a throne, and the library filled with richly bound volumes.  Everything was beautiful, sumptuous and magnificent, and Chupin admired, though he did not envy, this luxury.  He said to himself that, if ever he became rich, his establishment should be quite different.  He would have preferred rather more simplicity, a trifle less satin, velvet, hangings, mirrors and gilding.  Still this did not prevent him from going into ecstasies over each room he entered; and he expressed his admiration so artlessly that the valet, feeling as much flattered as if he were the owner of the place, took a sort of pride in exhibiting everything.\\n\\nHe showed Chupin the target which the viscount practised at with pistols for an hour every morning; for Monsieur le Vicomte was a capital marksman, and could lodge eight balls out of ten in the neck of a bottle at a distance of twenty paces.  He also displayed his master's swords; for Monsieur le Vicomte handled side arms as adroitly as pistols.  He took a lesson every day from one of the best fencing-masters in Paris; and his duels had always terminated fortunately.  He also showed the viscount's blue velvet dressing- gown, his fur-trimmed slippers, and even his elaborately embroidered night-shirts.  But it was the dressing-room that most astonished and stupefied Chupin.  He stood gazing in open-mouthed wonder at the immense white marble table, with its water spigots and its basins, its sponges and boxes, its pots and vials and cups; and he counted the brushes by the dozen--brushes hard and soft, brushes for the hair, for the beard, for the hands, and the application of cosmetic to the mustaches and eyebrows.  Never had he seen in one collection such a variety of steel and silver instruments, knives, pincers, scissors, and files.  \\\"One might think oneself in a chiropodist's, or a dentist's establishment,\\\" remarked Chupin to the servant.  \\\"Does your master use all these every day?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certainly, or rather twice a day--morning and evening--at his toilette.\\\"\\n\\nChupin expressed his feelings with a grimace and an exclamation of mocking wonder.  \\\"Ah, well! he must have a clean skin,\\\" he said.\\n\\nHis listeners laughed heartily; and the concierge, after exchanging a significant glance with the valet, said sotto voce, \\\"Zounds! it's his business to be a handsome fellow!\\\" The mystery was solved.\\n\\nWhile Chupin changed the contents of the jardinieres, and remained upstairs in the intervals between the nine or ten journeys he made to the porte-cochere for more flowers, he listened attentively to the conversation between the concierge and the valet, and heard snatches of sentences that enlightened him wonderfully.  Moreover, whenever a question arose as to placing a plant in one place rather than another, the valet stated as a conclusive argument that the baroness liked it in such or such a place, or that she would be better pleased with this or that arrangement, or that he must comply with the instructions she had given him.  Chupin was therefore obliged to conclude that the flowers had been sent here by a baroness who possessed certain rights in the establishment.  But who was she?\\n\\nHe was manoeuvering cleverly in the hope of ascertaining this point, when a carriage was heard driving into the courtyard below.  \\\"Monsieur must have returned!\\\" exclaimed the valet, darting to the window.\\n\\nChupin also ran to look out, and saw a very elegant blue-lined brougham, drawn by a superb horse, but he did not perceive the viscount.  In point of fact, M. de Coralth was already climbing the stairs, four at a time, and, a moment later, he entered the room, angrily exclaiming, \\\"Florent, what does this mean? Why have you left all the doors open?\\\"\\n\\nFlorent was the servant in the red waistcoat.  He slightly shrugged his shoulders like a servant who knows too many of his master's secrets to have anything to fear, and in the calmest possible tone replied, \\\"If the doors are open, it is only because the baroness has just sent some flowers.  On Sunday, too, what a funny idea! And I have been treating Father Moulinet and this worthy fellow\\\" (pointing to Chupin) \\\"to a glass of wine, to acknowledge their kindness in assisting me.\\\"\\n\\nFearing recognition, Chupin hid his face as much as possible; but M. de Coralth did not pay the slightest attention to him.  There was a dark frown on his handsome, usually smiling countenance, and his hair was in great disorder.  Evidently enough, something had greatly annoyed him.  \\\"I am going out again,\\\" he remarked to his valet, \\\"but first of all I must write two letters which you must deliver immediately.\\\"\\n\\nHe passed into the drawing-room as he spoke, and Florent scarcely waited till the door was closed before uttering an oath.  \\\"May the devil take him!\\\" he exclaimed.  \\\"Here he sets me on the go again.  It is five o'clock, too, and I have an appointment in half an hour.\\n\\nA sudden hope quickened the throbbings of Chupin's heart.  He touched the valet's arm, and in his most persuasive tone remarked: \\\"I've nothing to do, and as your wine was so good, I'll do your errands for you, if you'll pay me for the wear and tear of shoe- leather.\\\"\\n\\nChupin's appearance must have inspired confidence, for the servant replied:--\\\"Well--I don't refuse--but we'll see.\\\"\\n\\nThe viscount did not spend much time in writing; he speedily reappeared holding two letters which he flung upon the table, saying: \\\"One of these is for the baroness.  You must deliver it into HER hands or into the hands of her maid--there will be no answer.  You will afterward take the other to the person it is addressed to, and you must wait for an answer which you will place on my writing-table--and make haste.\\\" So saying, the viscount went off as he had entered--on the run--and a moment later, his brougham was heard rolling out of the courtyard.\\n\\nFlorent was crimson with rage.  \\\"There,\\\" said he, addressing Chupin rather than the concierge, \\\"what did I tell you? A letter to be placed in madame's own hands or in the hands of her maid, and to be concealed from the baron, who is on the watch, of course.  Naturally no one can execute that commission but myself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's true!\\\" replied Chupin; \\\"but how about the other?\\\"\\n\\nThe valet had not yet examined the second letter.  He now took it from the table, and glanced at the address.  \\\"Ah,\\\" said he, \\\"I can confide this one to you, my good fellow, and it's very fortunate, for it is to be taken to a place on the other side of the river.  Upon my word! masters are strange creatures!  You manage your work so as to have a little leisure, and the moment you think yourself free, pouf!--they send you anywhere in creation without even asking if it suits your convenience.  If it hadn't been for you, I should have missed a dinner with some very charming ladies.  But, above all, don't loiter on the way.  I don't mind paying your omnibus fare if you like.  And you heard him say there would be an answer.  You can give it to Moulinet, and in exchange, he'll give you fifteen sous for your trouble, and six sous for your omnibus fare.  Besides, if you can extract anything from the party the letter's intended for, you are quite welcome to it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Agreed, sir! Grant me time enough to give an answer to the lady who is waiting at the Madeleine, and I'm on my way.  Give me the letter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Here it is, said the valet, handing it to Chupin.  But as the latter glanced at the address he turned deadly pale, and his eyes almost started from their sockets.  For this is what he read: \\\"Madame Paul.  Dealer in Tobacco.  Quai de la Seine.\\\"  Great as was his self-control, his emotion was too evident to escape notice.  \\\"What's the matter with you?\\\" asked the concierge and the valet in the same breath.  \\\"What has happened to you?\\\"\\n\\nA powerful effort of will restored this young fellow's coolness, and ready in an instant with an excuse for his blunder, he replied, \\\"I have changed my mind.  What! you'd only give me fifteen sous to measure such a distance as that! Why, it isn't a walk--it's a journey!\\\"\\n\\nHis explanation was accepted without demur.  His listeners thought he was only taking advantage of the need they had of his services-- as was perfectly natural under the circumstances.  \\\"What! So you are dissatisfied!\\\" cried the valet.  \\\"Very well! you shall have thirty sous--but be off!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So I will, at once,\\\" replied Chupin.  And, imitating the whistle of a locomotive with wonderful perfection, he darted away at a pace which augured a speedy return.\\n\\nHowever, when he was some twenty yards from the house he stopped short, glanced around him, and espying a dark corner slipped into it.  \\\"That fool in the red waistcoat will be coming out to take the letter to that famous baroness,\\\" he thought.  \\\"I'm here, and I'll watch him and see where he goes.  I should like to find out the name of the kind and charitable lady who watches over his brigand of a master with such tender care.\\\"\\n\\nThe day and the hour were in his favor.  Night was coming on, hastened by a thick fog; the street lamps were not yet lighted, and as it was Sunday most of the shops were closed.  It grew dark so rapidly that Chupin was scarcely able to recognize Florent when he at last emerged from the house.  It is true that he looked altogether unlike the servant in the red waist-coat.  As he had the key to the wardrobe containing his master's clothes, he did not hesitate to use them whenever an opportunity offered.  On this occasion he had appropriated a pair of those delicately tinted trousers which were M. de Coralth's specialty, with a handsome overcoat, a trifle too small for him, and a very elegant hat.\\n\\n\\\"Fine doings, indeed!\\\" growled Chupin as he started in pursuit.  \\\"My servants sha'n't serve me in that way if I ever have any.\\\"\\n\\nBut he paused in his soliloquy, and prudently hid himself under a neighboring gateway.  The gorgeous Florent was ringing at the door of one of the most magnificent mansions in the Rue de la Ville l'Eveque.  The door was opened, and he went in.  \\\"Ah! ah!\\\" thought Chupin, \\\"he hadn't far to go.  The viscount and the baroness are shrewd.  When you have flowers to send to anybody it's convenient to be neighbors!\\\"\\n\\nHe glanced round, and seeing an old man smoking his pipe on the threshold of a shop, he approached him and asked politely \\\"Can you tell me whom that big house belongs to?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To Baron Trigault,\\\" replied the man, without releasing his hold on his pipe.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you, monsieur,\\\" replied Chupin, gravely.  \\\"I inquired, because I think of buying a house \\\"And repeating the name of Trigault several times to impress it upon his memory he darted off on his errand.\\n\\nIt might be supposed that his unexpected success had delighted him, but, on the contrary, it rendered him even more exacting.  The letter he carried burned his pocket like a red-hot iron.  \\\"Madame Paul,\\\" he muttered, \\\"that must be the rascal's wife.  First, Paul is his Christian name; secondly, I've been told that his wife keeps a tobacco shop--so the case is plain.  But the strangest thing about it is that this husband and wife should write to each other, when I fancied them at dagger's ends.\\\" Chupin would have given a pint of his own blood to know the contents of the missive.  The idea of opening it occurred to him, and it must be confessed that it was not a feeling of delicacy that prevented him.  He was deterred by a large seal which had been carefully affixed, and which would plainly furnish evidence if the letter were tampered with.  Thus Chupin was punished for Florent's faults, for this seal was the viscount's' invariable precaution against his servant's prying curiosity.  So our enterprising youth could only read and re-read the superscription and smell the paper, which was strongly scented with verbena.  He fancied that there was some mysterious connection between this letter intended for M. de Coralth's wife and the missive sent to the baroness.  And why should it not be so? Had they not both been written under the influence of anger? Still he failed to perceive any possible connection between the rich baroness and the poor tobacco dealer, and his cogitations only made him more perplexed than ever.  However, his efforts to solve the mystery did not interfere with the free use of his limbs, and he soon found himself on the Quai de la Seine.  \\\"Here I am,\\\" he muttered.  \\\"I've come more quickly than an omnibus.\\\"\\n\\nThe Quai de la Seine is a broad road, connecting the Rue de Flandres with the canal de l'Ourcq.  On the left-hand side it is bordered with miserable shanties interspersed with some tiny shops, and several huge coal depots.  On the right-hand side--that next to the canal--there are also a few provision stores.  In the daytime there is no noisier nor livelier place than this same Quai; but nothing could be more gloomy at night-time when the shops are closed, when the few gas-lamps only increase the grimness of the shadows, and when the only sound that breaks the silence is the rippling of the water as its smooth surface is ruffled by some boatman propelling his skiff through the canal.\\n\\n\\\"The Viscount must certainly have made a mistake,\\\" thought Chupin; \\\"there is no such shop on the Quai.\\\"  He was wrong, however; for after passing the Rue de Soissons he espied the red lantern of a tobacco-shop, glimmering through the fog.\\n\\nXI.\\n\\nHaving almost reached the goal, Chupin slackened his pace.  He approached the shop very cautiously and peered inside, deeming it prudent to reconnoitre a little before he went in.  And certainly there was nothing to prevent a prolonged scrutiny.  The night was very dark, the quay deserted.  No one was to be seen; not a sound broke the stillness.  The darkness, the surroundings, and the silence were sinister enough to make even Chupin shudder, though he was usually as thoroughly at home in the loneliest and most dangerous by-ways of Paris as an honest man of the middle classes would be in the different apartments of his modest household.  \\\"That scoundrel's wife must have less than a hundred thousand a year if she takes up her abode here!\\\" thought Chupin.\\n\\nAnd, in fact, nothing could be more repulsive than the tenement in which Madame Paul had installed herself.  It was but one story high, and built of clay, and it had fallen to ruin to such an extent that it had been found necessary to prop it up with timber, and to nail some old boards over the yawning fissures in the walls.  \\\"If I lived here, I certainly shouldn't feel quite at ease on a windy day,\\\" continued Chupin, sotto voce.\\n\\nThe shop itself was of a fair size, but most wretched in its appointments, and disgustingly dirty.  The floor was covered with that black and glutinous coal-dust which forms the soil of the Quai de la Seine.  An auctioneer would have sold the entire stock and fixtures for a few shillings.  Four stone jars, and a couple of pairs of scales, a few odd tumblers, filled with pipes and packets of cigarettes, some wine-glasses, and three or four labelled bottles, five or six boxes of cigars, and as many packages of musty tobacco, constituted the entire stock in trade.\\n\\nAs Chupin compared this vile den with the viscount's luxurious abode, his blood fairly boiled in his veins.  \\\"He ought to be shot for this, if for nothing else,\\\" he muttered through his set teeth.  \\\"To let his wife die of starvation here!\\\" For it was M. de Coralth's wife who kept this shop.  Chupin, who had seen her years before, recognized her now as she sat behind her counter, although she was cruelly changed.  \\\"That's her,\\\" he murmured.  \\\"That's certainly Mademoiselle Flavie.\\\"\\n\\nHe had used her maiden name in speaking of her.  Poor woman! She was undoubtedly still young--but sorrow, regret, and privations, days spent in hard work to earn a miserable subsistence, and nights spent in weeping, had made her old, haggard, and wrinkled before her time.  Of her once remarkable beauty naught remained but her hair, which was still magnificent, though it was in wild disorder, and looked as if it had not been touched by a comb for weeks; and her big black eyes, which gleamed with the phosphorescent and destructive brilliancy of fever.  Everything about her person bespoke terrible reverses, borne without dignity.  Even if she had struggled at first, it was easy to see that she struggled no longer.  Her attire--her torn and soiled silk dress, and her dirty cap--revealed thorough indolence, and that morbid indifference which at times follows great misfortunes with weak natures.\\n\\n\\\"Such is life,\\\" thought Chupin, philosophically.  \\\"Here's a girl who was brought up like a queen and allowed to have her own way in everything! If any one had predicted this in those days, how she would have sneered! I can see her now as she looked that day when I met her driving her gray ponies.  If people didn't clear the road it was so much the worse for them! In those times Paris was like some great shop where she could select whatever she chose.  She said: 'I want this,' and she got it.  She saw a handsome young fellow and wanted him for her husband; her father, who could refuse her nothing, consented, and now behold the result!\\\"\\n\\nHe had lingered longer at the window than he had meant to do, perhaps because he could see that the young woman was talking with some person in a back room, the door of which stood open.  Chupin tried to find out who this person was, but he did not succeed; and he was about to go in when suddenly he saw Madame Paul rise from her seat and say a few words with an air of displeasure.  And this time her eyes, instead of turning to the open door, were fixed on a part of the shop directly opposite her.  \\\"Is there some one there as well, then?\\\" Chupin wondered.\\n\\nHe changed his post of observation, and, by standing on tiptoe, he succeeded in distinguishing a puny little boy, some three or four years old, and clad in rags, who was playing with the remnants of a toy-horse.  The sight of this child increased Chupin's indignation.  \\\"So there's a child?\\\" he growled.  \\\"The rascal not only deserts his wife, but he leaves his child to starve!  We may as well make a note of that: and when we settle up our accounts, he shall pay dearly for his villainy.\\\" With this threat he brusquely entered the shop.\\n\\n\\\"What do you wish, sir?\\\" asked the woman.\\n\\n\\\"Nothing; I bring you a letter, madame.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A letter for me! You must be mistaken.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Excuse me; aren't you Madame Paul?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then this is for you.\\\" And he handed her the missive which Florent had confided to his care.\\n\\nMadame Paul took hold of it with some hesitation, eying the messenger suspiciously meanwhile; but, on seeing the handwriting, she uttered a cry of surprise.  And, turning toward the open door, she called, \\\"M. Mouchon! M. Mouchon! It's from him--it's from my husband; from Paul.  Come, come!\\\"\\n\\nA bald-headed, corpulent man, who looked some fifty years of age, now timidly emerged from the room behind the shop with a cap in his hand.  \\\"Ah, well! my dear child,\\\" he said, in an oily voice, \\\"what was I telling you just now? Everything comes to those who know how to wait.\\\"\\n\\nHowever she had already broken the seal, and she was now reading the letter eagerly, clapping her hands with delight as she finished its perusal.  \\\"He consents!\\\" she exclaimed.  \\\"He's frightened--he begs me to wait a little--look--read!\\\"\\n\\nBut M. Mouchon could not read without his spectacles, and he lost at least two minutes in searching his pockets before he found them.  And when they were adjusted, the light was so dim that it took him at least three minutes more to decipher the missive.  Chupin had spent this time in scrutinizing--in appraising the man, as it were.  \\\"What is this venerable gentleman doing here?\\\" he thought.  \\\"He's a middle class man, that's evident from his linen.  He's married--there's a wedding-ring on his finger; he has a daughter, for the ends of his necktie are embroidered.  He lives in the neighborhood, for, well dressed as he is, he wears a cap.  But what was he doing there in that back room in the dark?\\\"\\n\\nMeanwhile M. Mouchon had finished reading the letter.  \\\"What did I tell you?\\\" he said complacently.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, you were right!\\\" answered Madame Paul as she took up the letter and read it again with her eyes sparkling with joy.  \\\"And now what shall I do?\\\" she asked.  \\\"Wait, shall I not?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, no!\\\" exclaimed the elderly gentleman, in evident dismay.  \\\"You must strike the iron while it's hot.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But he promises me----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To promise and to keep one's promises are two different things.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He wants a reply.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tell him----\\\" But he stopped short, calling her attention with a gesture to the messenger, whose eyes were glittering with intense curiosity.\\n\\nShe understood.  So filling a glass with some liquor, she placed it before Chupin, and offered him a cigar, saying: \\\"Take a seat-- here's something to keep you from feeling impatient while you wait here.\\\" Thereupon she followed the old gentleman into the adjoining room, and closed the door.\\n\\nEven if Chupin had not possessed the precocious penetration he owed to his life of adventure, the young woman and the old gentleman had said enough to enable him to form a correct estimate of the situation.  He was certain now that he knew the contents of the letter as perfectly as if he had read it.  M. de Coralth's anger, and his order to make haste, were both explained.  Moreover, Chupin distinctly saw what connection there was between the letter to the baroness and the letter to Madame Paul.  He understood that one was the natural consequence of the other.  Deserted by her husband, Madame Paul had at last become weary of poverty and privations.  She had instituted a search for her husband, and, having found him, she had written to him in this style: \\\"I consent to abstain from interfering with you, but only on conditions that you provide means of subsistence for me, your lawfully wedded wife, and for your child.  If you refuse, I shall urge my claims, and ruin you.  The scandal won't be of much use to me, it's true, but at least I shall no longer be obliged to endure the torture of knowing that you are surrounded by every luxury while I am dying of starvation.\\\"\\n\\nYes, she had evidently written that.  It might not be the precise text; but no doubt it was the purport of her letter.  On receiving it, Coralth had become alarmed.  He knew only too well that if his wife made herself known and revealed his past, it would be all over with him.  But he had no money.  Charming young men like the Viscount de Coralth never have any money on hand.  So, in this emergency, the dashing young fellow had written to his wife imploring her to have patience, and to the baroness, entreating, or rather commanding her to advance him a certain sum at once.\\n\\nThis was no doubt the case, and yet there was one circumstance which puzzled Chupin exceedingly.  In former years, he had heard it asserted that Mademoiselle Flavie was the very personification of pride, and that she adored her husband even to madness.  Had this great love vanished? Had poverty and sorrow broken her spirit to such a degree that she was willing to stoop to such shameful concessions! If she were acquainted with her husband's present life, how did it happen that she did not prefer starvation, or the alms-house and a pauper's grave to his assistance? Chupin could understand how, in a moment of passion, she might be driven to denounce her husband in the presence of his fashionable acquaintances, how she might be impelled to ruin him so as to avenge herself; but he could not possibly understand how she could consent to profit by the ignominy of the man she loved.  \\\"The plan isn't hers,\\\" said Chupin to himself, after a moment's reflection.  \\\"It's probably the work of that stout old gentleman.\\\"\\n\\nThere was a means of verifying his suspicions, for on returning into the adjoining room, Madame Paul had not taken her son with her.  He was still sitting on the muddy floor of the shop, playing with his dilapidated horse.  Chupin called him.  \\\"Come here, my little fellow,\\\" said he.\\n\\nThe child rose, and timidly approached, his eyes dilating with distrust and astonishment.  The poor boy's repulsive uncleanliness was a terrible charge against the mother.  Did she no longer love her own offspring? The untidiness of sorrow and poverty has its bounds.  A long time must have passed since the child's face and hands had been washed, and his soiled clothes were literally falling to rags.  Still, he was a handsome little fellow, and seemed fairly intelligent, in spite of his bashfulness.  He was very light-haired, and in features he was extremely like M. de Coralth.  Chupin took him on his knees, and, after looking to see if the door communicating with the inner room were securely closed, he asked: \\\"What's your name, little chap?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Paul.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you know your father?\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1640139723,\"title\":\"Chupin had foreseen this objection, and was prepared for it.  \\\"But there's money in the letter,\\\" he remonstrated.\"},\"digest\":\"oH5YeNBoQZcAFFOewnkW3G9igLd9hxOWNI73TrQoymA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x025bE40F20d6f0f04d76fE7Ad916e5d61bc4D69f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"icPwmeD_0Id-Cmy-b3c_DEpdoIeLERCAtloe18DCvCo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"g-kp4zmEywQAyEWnKQNmR49RWRdmP44fuTdTOH0e4ws\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"am9__sI6Tvgq6t3k-bwHtQDbeCaalJ5_i0WniohPhAe9GLOXXpiey0kJWoDcM4MS_ql4CQHaKtWpSS4NwXKQsA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x55277db4957ccd8357b50afdb7a28589b65a0268db405492915368b1d1ee2bec16055642c93bc6fbb978dcdae91b0d57b0d30933fd98a0c6a0cf38028147b7a21c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"icPwmeD_0Id-Cmy-b3c_DEpdoIeLERCAtloe18DCvCo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"g-kp4zmEywQAyEWnKQNmR49RWRdmP44fuTdTOH0e4ws\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"oH5YeNBoQZcAFFOewnkW3G9igLd9hxOWNI73TrQoymA\"}"
