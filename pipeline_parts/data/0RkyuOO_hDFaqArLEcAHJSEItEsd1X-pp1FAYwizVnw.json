"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"How to turn tactics into strategies to gain absolute advantage. Let the opponent understand it, but can't learn it.\\n\\nIs it hard? In fact, it is extremely simple. First of all, how is an excellent strategy formed? It is to first create a core competitiveness, or it can be said to start to create an excellent point, a specific tactic, such as a low-price strategy. Then, every other action is optimized around this low-price strategy, and finally a lot of strategy groups including logistics strategy, procurement strategy, and employment strategy are formed for the low-price strategy service. These strategies are strung together to form a core competition chain. At this time, the strategy is complete. In other words, the strategy is actually to select an advantage point, and then continuously optimize the overall effect, is it a bit complicated? So let me give you an example. For example, the founder of Wal-Mart, the old Wal-Mart, once had a merchandise discount, but his turnover soared and made a lot of money. He realized the power of \\\"low prices\\\"!\\n\\nBut the low price is only a selling point, that is, a tactic. Competitors can understand, learn well, and dare to fight for low prices. It is impossible for him to discount every day, so competitors will continue to discount. In the end, everyone will fight for industry-wide losses. This kind of thing often happens in China. In fact, Didi Taxi and Kuaidi Taxi belong to this kind of players who only play tactics. Everyone loses money, but now they are merged.\\n\\nIf the old Walton was someone who only knew how to play tactics, then there would be no Wal-Mart today. The great thing about the old Walton is that he used low prices as a strategy.\\n\\nIf you understand this. You can understand why the old Walton even lived in the cheapest hotel, but he was willing to put in hundreds of millions of dollars of satellites. The purpose of the satellites was to cooperate with the company's logistics system, which ultimately resulted in the \\\"lower price\\\" step. , Competitors will not understand what the old Wal-Mart wants to do for a while. Even if they do, they hesitate to follow up. After all, put a satellite. This is after discovering a useful tactic. Go with this\\n\\n132 Entrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs\\n\\nAn excellent tactic has slowly formed a \\\"chain-style adjustment and running-in\\\". This step is very difficult, and it tests your operational capabilities.\\n\\nHowever, as long as you do it, you make adjustments in operation and cooperate with the team to sort out. In the end, at the beginning, the advantage of \\\"surgery\\\" will continue to expand and grow. Self-strength. Just like Wal-Martâ€™s low-price strategy. Through operations, constantly self-strengthening. At this time, the competitor has long been unable to understand why you can have such a low price, and you dare not learn, and dare not fight for a low price, because he can't fight you anymore. In this way, you have finished turning tactics into strategies, and you are invincible. Everyone understands this idea, and you can adapt it to your own enterprises and projects.\",\"timestamp\":1634796802,\"title\":\"How to do business with tactics as a strategy\"},\"digest\":\"pXe24CDvP8HBIm5wFekNuPhJAmrzu2jkPlT_YRZiRxI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"DCXgIUK_-Rjjfk33zpXkeLAU4fp8vZbDVjxN0DCWt-YC_9wHnsw7VDHvMYwu6zl3EfjS28NGxE8b2eFiU6uLAQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"pXe24CDvP8HBIm5wFekNuPhJAmrzu2jkPlT_YRZiRxI\"}"
