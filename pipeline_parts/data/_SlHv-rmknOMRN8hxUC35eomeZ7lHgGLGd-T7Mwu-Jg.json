The internet is not bad for creative people. Web2 is bad for creative people.”**— Chris Dixon\\n\\n**“Denying and pushing back against NFTs and crypto is basically saying, “We’re not going to have a collectively owned future. We’re going to have a corporate-owned future, and we’re going to have a government-owned future.'”**— Naval Ravikant\\n\\n**“As with all sorts of tech things and money involved, there are bad people. It’s just inevitable. It happened in the ’90s; it happened in the 2000s. It happens now. And those people give Web3 a very bad name. We want to get rid of those people.”**— Chris Dixon\\n\\n**“Where we started was we actually decentralized the hardest thing. The hardest thing to decentralize is money. And once you have money decentralized, then you can own private property.”**— Naval Ravikant\\n\\n**“The killer app of the internet is networks. We’ve got a million networks built on this thing now.”**— Chris Dixon\\n\\n**“Any regulator that stops the next generation of artists and musicians and gamers and game developers from owning their platforms and their work is going to go into the wastebasket of history as a villain. It’s that simple.”**— Naval Ravikant\\n\\n**“Step one will be you take the existing artists and they get more money. Step two is you’re going to incentivize a whole new generation to go do these cool things.”**— Chris Dixon\\n\\n**“This should be the greatest time in history for creative people.”**— Chris Dixon\\n\\n**“I really believe very strongly that one of the most important things you can do is just go speak to a lot of people. That’s where I get all of my information is talking to entrepreneurs, talking to people that are smarter than me.”**— Chris Dixon\\n\\n**“I think Web3 is not only better for the world, but it’s also going to beat Web2. It’s going to be more popular because the people get really excited when they actually get to participate.”**— Chris Dixon\\n\\n### PEOPLE MENTIONED\\n\\n* [Nick Szabo](https://twitter.com/nickszabo4)\\n* [Vitalik Buterin](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin)\\n* [Daniel Dennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett)\\n* [Bertrand Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell)\\n* [Kurt Gödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del)\\n* [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing)\\n* [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann)\\n* [Reid Hoffman](https://twitter.com/reidhoffman)\\n* [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto)\\n* [Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs)\\n* [Steve Wozniak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak)\\n* [Clayton Christensen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_Christensen)\\n* [Fred Wilson](https://avc.com/about/)\\n* [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith)\\n* [Mark Zuckerberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg)\\n* [Larry Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page)\\n* [Sergey Brin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin)\\n* [Joe Rogan](https://twitter.com/joerogan)\\n* [Akira the Don](https://www.akirathedon.com/)\\n* [Jack Butcher](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher)\\n* [Eric Jorgenson](https://www.ejorgenson.com/)\\n* [Kevin Kelly](https://twitter.com/kevin2kelly)\\n* [Punk 6529](https://twitter.com/punk6529)\\n* [3LAU](https://twitter.com/3lau)\\n* [Dmitri Cherniak](https://twitter.com/dmitricherniak)\\n* [Andrew Steinwold](https://twitter.com/AndrewSteinwold)\\n* [AJ Romero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/romeroaj/)\\n* [Billy Beane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Beane)\\n* [Kevin Rose](https://twitter.com/kevinrose)\\n* [Ernest Hemingway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway)\\n* [Neal Stephenson](https://twitter.com/nealstephenson)\\n* [Hayden Adams](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams)\\n* [Robert Leshner](https://twitter.com/rleshner)\\n* [Henry Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford)\\n* [Balaji Srinivasan](https://twitter.com/balajis)\\n* [Patrick McHenry](https://twitter.com/PatrickMcHenry)\\n* [Kyrsten Sinema](https://twitter.com/kyrstensinema)\\n* [Andrew Yang](https://twitter.com/AndrewYang)\\n* [Karl Marx](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marx/)\\n* [Kathryn Haun](https://twitter.com/katie_haun)\\n* [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk)\\n* [George Westinghouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Westinghouse)\\n* [Thomas Edison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison)\\n* [Orville and Wilbur Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers)\\n* [Alexander Graham Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell)\\n* [Aaron Wright](https://twitter.com/awrigh01?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\\n* [Willy Wonka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Wonka)\\n* [Warren Buffett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett)\\n* [Tyler Hobbs](https://twitter.com/tylerxhobbs)\\n* [Kanye West](https://twitter.com/kanyewest)\\n* [Jay-Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z)\\n\\n\\\\***[The Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/podcast)** \\\\*is one of the most popular podcasts in the world with more than 700 million downloads.
