"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*TL;DR: This is an experiment in tracking my personal sabbatical time. I’ll write about what I do, read, and think. I welcome comments and critique. I believe I’ll learn from the act of writing this itself, even if no one else engages with it.*\\n\\nOn 31st of Dec 2021, I quit my job, and a few days later put out a [post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6884120819014938624/) on LinkedIn to let my friends and colleagues know that I intended to take some time off as a self-styled sabbatical. I was quite surprised by how many people reacted and left comments, and also messaged me directly to catch up. I suspect it may have had to do with the cat pic I included in the post. (Niki deserves her own post, we’ll get to it later)\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F075c600c-6ca9-47df-9014-ea74ddaa2819\\\\_3024x4032.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F075c600c-6ca9-47df-9014-ea74ddaa2819\\\\_3024x4032.jpeg)\\n\\nSeveral of the folks who reached out expressed an interest in following along on my journey vicariously, as I figured out what to do with my new-found freedom of time. They [suggested](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6884803298013044736/) I do this in newsletter form.\\n\\nConcurrently, I’d been thinking about keeping a journal of sorts to keep track of everything I was hoping to do over the next few months. Call me a strong J (on [MBTI](https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/judging-or-perceiving.htm)), but something about tracking and organising gives me innate satisfaction.\\n\\nAs I think more about it, I see several benefits to writing up a \\\\~biweekly synthesis of my sabbatical time:\\n\\n*   It’ll be a good trigger for regular introspection.\\n*   I can look back on how I’m spending my time and get to decide if that’s what I actually wanted to do. I’m thinking of this not as a scorecard, where I try to rate something on a goodness scale, but rather as a view from the gallery, stepping back from the daily dance.\\n*   Writing regularly should be a good way to maintain and grow my writing skills.\\n*   Maybe friends, colleagues or strangers will comment, critique or provide suggestions that will help me in my exploration.\\n*   There’s always the off chance that someone benefits from reading something that I wrote. If that’s you, please let me know!\\n\\nAnd so, here I am. I aim to write at least once a week, for at least as long as I am not working full-time again. The content will be a mix of what I’m doing and learning, and occasionally some anonymised / sanitised notes on interesting conversations I’ve had recently.\\n\\nIf you are a reader, you can help me by letting me know if it’s worth your time, and what you like vs. not. If something I write sparks a thought, leave a comment, ask a question or share it with someone you think might want to read it. You never know, we might end up going deeper into a topic, working on something together, or simply making a friendly connection!\\n\",\"timestamp\":1641667562,\"title\":\"Why a newsletter\"},\"digest\":\"DmAScX0lG_IxYWady-cUJAVCU7DQI-8NkjDgqjYDQpk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xE8fe06eF25Abde9102198721F0D5ca9964A91C8E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"24nacaVLv16GbgfQYF-Cbsfp636oCcs4C7gwVR3gb50\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eXWc5hFS1iQuuPZszEWyhi9nFExj5tocXBD3gUdek7I\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"VTzwFssj54lKp1DAjpkpfv-h8GfqM35j1Lpej8dXgaD4EN5fdY0dRrcdn5IMiM4V2G99bTXXep2sSx3gnBtJHA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4fbb88db9747324da410ab31dfd19be9ee52f2d3431e4648dad24965b85e56cc4fff9c59fdbd0cc17b2078676032fb5bbeab778d90ae774abe2c36ffdc2138551c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"24nacaVLv16GbgfQYF-Cbsfp636oCcs4C7gwVR3gb50\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eXWc5hFS1iQuuPZszEWyhi9nFExj5tocXBD3gUdek7I\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"DmAScX0lG_IxYWady-cUJAVCU7DQI-8NkjDgqjYDQpk\"}"
