"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The Thread Weekly is your best source for a quick debrief across the latest news, actions, events and happenings in web3 fashion, the open metaverse and beyond. It’s curated and published by DIGITALAX and the Global Designer Network.\\n\\nWeave your way through the threads below to get all caught up on the culture from Nov 22nd- 28th 2021.\\n\\n## Top Moments\\n\\n### Alexander goes IRL\\n\\nMetaverse fashion doesn’t just mean digital, and many of the GDN designers are well versed across both the physical and digital realms. Alexander recently released an [IRL fashion collection](https://m.shein.com/ru/pdsearch/Kurmanin/?channel_id=1&ici=s1%60EditSearch%60Kurmanin%60_fb%60d0%60PageHome&scici=Search\\\\~\\\\~EditSearch\\\\~\\\\~1\\\\~\\\\~Kurmanin\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~0) with Shein that was produced out of the 3D digital prototypes that he created. Although Shein isn’t the most sustainable brand out there, and definitely a fast fashion retailer, the designs themselves are very cool and we can’t wait to be able to enable every GDN designer to have access to the necessary tools to fabricate sustainably from start to finish! \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2CRZgjTwY1orN2BIi4j5q.png?height=674&width=1034)\\n\\n### Musashi & Moloch Cloudship\\n\\nIn the web3 space, Moloch has come to represent the god of coordination failure. We slay Moloch by creating coordination tools and infrastructure— which is exactly what Musashi and his team have set out to do… but not in a normal boring way… in a like really really cool way… it’s a freaking spaceship combining DAOs, hangouts and cool projects all in one! \\n\\nIn web3, the interface really matters, as this is how we onboard more people into the space and make the abstract far more understandable and tangible. Check out more of Musashi’s project below!\\n\\n[https://mirror.xyz/musashi13.eth/crowdfunds/0x77503fE27Da527618bA7B3e578670d31f0BEbd59](https://mirror.xyz/musashi13.eth/crowdfunds/0x77503fE27Da527618bA7B3e578670d31f0BEbd59)\\n\\n### New Digis joined the Web3 Gang\\n\\nSome new digitals joined the gang this week as we continue to build out native cyber fashion realms. \\n\\nYou can start to interact with both Àwèlé, summoned by [Hadeeart](https://designers.digitalax.xyz/designers/Hadeeart/), and Àsá, summoned by [Majestic Apparell](https://designers.digitalax.xyz/designers/Majestic%20Apparell/), [here](https://www.digitalax.xyz/web3-digi-models) and also follow them on twitter [here](https://twitter.com/AweleMeta) and [here](https://twitter.com/asathemetaelf). \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mUtI-M9mjeKOB4YgAqMGK.png?height=576&width=875)\\n\\n### Sub Threads\\n\\nWe have started to release weekly sub threads run by the Global Designer Network Purveyors. Each purveyor is releasing a weekly sub thread on Mirror where they curate and collate information from across the web3 fashion space that is specific to their particular purveyor sector, from afrofuturism design, web3 fashion media to raw apparel. \\n\\nTo overthrow the behemoths of this age old industry, it isn’t enough to out-trade them, we also have to out-type. The Thread Weekly and its sub-forks bring greater liquidity and volume around content as compelling currency and allows for more of the broader market to start sharing in on some of the most valuable insights as to how this industry is taking on traditional fashion and burning the virtual store houses of the old content robber barons.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kwUFUz42Ph79tW4jyNbk7.png?height=743&width=4096)\\n\\n### Dcentral Miami\\n\\nMost of the action this week has been getting ready for the upcoming Dcentral Miami / NFT Basel taking place from Nov 30th - Dec 1st and onwards…. all the GDN has put in so much work and we’ll be revealing the Miami designs tomorrow! Get ready, and if you haven’t already got tickets, you can so below: \\n\\n[https://www.dcentralcon.com/](https://www.dcentralcon.com/)\\n\\nEmma and Osumikat have also been hustling getting all the designer shipments in and setting up the exhibition spot!
