"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"It's not even necessarily the way they acquire their wealth *initially*. Zuck gets lucky, codes a MySpace knock-off that just happens to catch on, and becomes a multi-billionaire. Ok, well, in that chain of events he hasn't exactly murdered children or anything heinous. Yes, he was demonstrably \\\"not a great guy\\\" even in the beginning, but loads of awful people win the lottery to0, that's the nature of a probabilistic universe. So it goes.\\n\\nBut it's how these billionaires act *after* they get that wealth that continues to build the anger and resentment towards them. Just look at Mark Zuckerberg. Some billionaires blunder into their wealth, some (Putin) murder and steal their way to it, but these are single events, in essence. It isn't merely someone *having* billions of dollars that is the greatest threat, it's them *using* it not only to accumulate *more* wealth, but to do it *directly* through utilizing that wealth to leech power, agency, and resources from all those around them. And for *what*? That's the irony. These people become *more* vampiric *after* reaching a point where they have absolutely no *need for* for the resources.\\n\\nI *get* why a starving man murders another for a loaf of bread. I *get* why a drug addict robs a bank. These are awful acts, but they make *sense*. Desperation and fear, they are the most powerful of motivators across the entire animal kingdom. But billionaires exhibit these behaviors at the *top*, and at a certain point, what they keep doing stops making any sense from any rational perspective.\\n\\nMark has more money then he can ever spend in his entire life. And he is continually getting dragged before congress and eviscerated in the media, he looks like fucking garbage, and all for what? For *more* money? To hold on to his shitty Boomer Brainwashing app?\\n\\nHe could quit this bullshit, leave it to middle men, and start a project to counteract global warming. He could try to build something new and useful to society, and people like that, too, he'll get more money the legitimate way. He could start a coding lab and hire the best coders to build crazy and fun shit and not even worry about whether it made money, he could just spend his entire life doing that and funding that lab while his fortune whittled away, because, why not? Or he could just buy an island, fill it with 1,000 bikini models staffing a luxury resort made only for him, and live the rest of his life in unimaginable ease and comfort and hedonism.\\n\\nBut what the fuck is he doing instead? Looking like an idiot and getting his ass handed to him on live TV by a 10-month old congresswoman. Getting memed and berated and vilified across the entire internet *because he's an asshole*. Going to god-knows how many speaking coaches and still coming out looking like a nervous little toad. What a disastrous waste of time and wealth. There is definitely a legitimate mental disorder that comes along with that much wealth. If they weren't so evil and destructive, you'd feel bad for these people that have more than nearly anyone else ever, and are trapped in a cycle of addiction and destruction. Money money everywhere, and not a dollar to buy happiness and peace.\\n\\nMark made billions inventing a tool that has made the world, and everyone in it, worse off for it. He will go down in history as a footnote, an awkward little joke of a man, stiff and robotic, propping up the dumbest President in the history of Presidents because he's scared a big mean lady will come and break apart the shitty, horrible thing he built.\\n\\nThese people are destroying the world *and* themselves for something they are so far beyond needing. It's absurd.\\n\\nThe discourse around wealth is preposterous. I hold nothing against people who inherit money or make more money. I believe everyone should be granted the ability to live in comfort, but some people strive for more and achieve more and they ought to be paid more for their talents and effort.\\n\\nBut I don't believe these people should have dramatically more voice and influence in a government that is supposed to, by design, treat all people equally. I don't believe that they should be permitted to make a hobby out of further exploiting and impoverishing other people for money they don't even need.\\n\\nSometimes I really marvel at how no one ever seems to ask *why* they do the things they do, or whether they even need to do them.\\n\\nI look at Mark Zuckerberg and feel such waste. These people are like Walter White at the end of Breaking Bad. They have everything, everything they could ever need, but it turns out it's only their shitty, horrible, destructive empire that gives them any purpose anymore. So they keep digging, keep doing bad and worse things to hold on to something that they only use to validate their sad little lives.\\n\\nAll that fortune, and all so that weak, pathetic people can feel like whole humans.\\n\\nZuckerberg should have cashed out in his twenties and just lived his life. This sad little man is going to end up wasting his entire life aspiring to be a Big Boy that he never was and never will be, to build an Empire that no one gives a shit about and that sucks the joy out of the world like a cancer.\\n\\nJust like so many of the billionaires of the world. If the vast, vast majority of billionaires are any indication, it's far more a curse than it is a gift. They're just sad, naked apes chained to the inertia of their own mountain of money, dragged along by it, following a script, forever apart from the rest of humankind, forever despised by and despising their fellow man.\",\"timestamp\":1633475526,\"title\":\"The Fear and Loathing of Mark Zuckerberg\"},\"digest\":\"xftLKrVD5aSGexCH9olwWaf_fOdK5QgGwDtD41rGfxo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x60a87118C2B06b0a8E08AbB61D340f27f07F660d\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"e0ISsP1MyXppqS7dow1RNiva3J9dYlOa_1NdtdPUKMQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dVguMfsH-a_2hyewJssC14u_E9Z3DGAW93Sw64kzybM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"UAcK7vnqKwsmHT_keSG1e__Q299ZptspC39xGSnQ1QqXt4WTqIYLy2z3zRSip_QNspfa0EMxaTZjPkV3YbnXLQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x88293191ba31ada3fd0b274c63b023ce63290c7f6d189d60a1514c6aaf8095bd6c9d284eb90f8189bbf620512cf367bba0aa434a55e30db6db4b8c355be2dec81b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"e0ISsP1MyXppqS7dow1RNiva3J9dYlOa_1NdtdPUKMQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dVguMfsH-a_2hyewJssC14u_E9Z3DGAW93Sw64kzybM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"xftLKrVD5aSGexCH9olwWaf_fOdK5QgGwDtD41rGfxo\"}"
