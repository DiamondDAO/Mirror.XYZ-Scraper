I don't trust my body anymore. I'm not safe. I need help. Nobody can help me...\\n> — April 2019*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nI wrote this during a panic attack.\\n\\nIt started in January 2018 and happened regularly, multiple times a week and for more than a year and a half.\\n\\nDuring this article I will try to write down how I experienced them and how I got out of it.\\n\\nBefore we start, here is a longer extract from a diary I started to keep track of the attacks (I will talk about it later in this text) :\\n\\n> *en ce moment je pleurs tout les soirs, je suis a bout de ces crise d'angoisse et crise de panique. je sais plus ce qui est faux ou vrai dans ce que je ressens dans mes douleurs. j'ai juste l'impression de mourrir à petit feu ou alors que je vais mourrir d'une seconde à l'autre... ça m'épuise ça me fatigue, mais ça m'empeche de dormir, ça me fait trembler dans tout le corps. ça me fait changer rapidement d'emotion, je pleurs puis je pleurs plus puis a nouveau. qu'est ce qu'il marrive. je me bats contre moi meme, depuis plus d'un an maintenant je me sens mal dans ma peau. des crise d'anxiété du coup. je dois croire ça ? mais comment je suis sensé soigner un truc invisible que je ne ressens meme pas. j'ai fais la meditation, la respiration... j'ai plus confiance en moi. comment reconnaitre dou viennent les douleurs comment faire pour ne plus avoir peur. je ne me sens plus en sécurité tout seul. je veux que ça s'arrete. je ne souhaite a personne de vivre ça de ressentir ça.*\\n\\nAs you can see, it's in french.\\n\\nI just paste it without modifications so you have the original text and see how I wrote in my diary, at first without shaping.\\n\\n**Here is the translation with a bit of shaping :**\\n\\n\\\"These days I'm crying every night. I can't bear the anxiety and panic attacks anymore. I can't make the difference between the truth and the false when it comes to my pains. I am just believing that I am dying little by little, or that I will die from one second to the next one... It's exhausting, it's tiring. But... It prevents me from sleeping, it makes my whole body to trembles. It changes my mood very fast, I cry, then I stop crying, and I cry again. What is happening to me. I am fighting again myself, it's been more than a year now that I feel bad in my own body. Anxiety crisis then. I have to believe this? How am I supposed to heal some invisible thing that I don't even feel. I did meditation, breathing exercises... I lost all confidence in myself. How can I discern from where my pains are from? How not to be scared anymore? I don't feel safe alone anymore. I want it to stop. I wish nobody to live and feel that.\\\"\\n\\nNow imagine this, almost every night, for more than a year.\\n\\nWe can start, sit down and take deep breath.\\n\\nI will try to cover it all during this article, the doubt, the begining, the doctors, the drugs, the cure, the relieves, etc.\\n\\nBe ready for a long journey inside my brain and all of his incoherence causing Panic Attacks.\\n\\n## Before it happened\\n\\n### Mastering Work/Life Balance (false)\\n\\nI will introduce myself a little so I can contextualize everything.\\n\\nMy name is Vincent, born in 1996 in Nîmes a city of the south of France. When I was little I was blond, big eyes, big cheeks, like a lot of children you could say. My first memory was a surgery of my -\\n\\nAlright maybe it is too much of contextualization, let's jump directly to the year where it all begins.\\n\\nWe are in 2017, I am now 21. It's been around 2 years I am a freelance developper.\\n\\nI am well payed, more than I could expect after my studies, and I feel full of energy.\\n\\nWith plenty of time and energy and seeing the money arriving into my bank account, I want more.\\n\\nSo I am accumulating all the contract without thinking about how many hours I work a day.\\n\\nMy day is basically like bellow :\\n\\n1. I wake up\\n2. I open my computer and work\\n3. I eat in 20 minutes\\n4. I continue to work\\n5. I eat in 20 minutes\\n6. I continue to work until I am too tired\\n7. I fall asleep, sometimes on my computer\\n\\nPerfect life isn't it ? I worked also the Sunday on some other clients work.\\n\\nYes I know, it is not great.\\n\\nBut I without experience at all I thought I knew it all.\\n\\nI thought I could manage everything, that I was strong.\\n\\nBut guess what, **I was completely wrong.**\\n\\n### One of The Trigger\\n\\n\\\\**To respect the private life of my friend I changed some details about the next events but it stay the same*\\n\\nAt the end of 2017 a member of a very close friend's family became sick.\\n\\nLittle by little it became very harmful to the life of this person.\\n\\nShe had to go to the hospital and after heavy exams, they announced the worst.\\n\\nCancer.\\n\\nI couldn't see myself elsewhere than near by my friend at the hospital as long as she stayed there.\\n\\nBut the thing is, that I was still working while at the hospital. Because I had to. My clients were waiting for results from me.\\n\\nI don't know if you ever spent a night at the hospital. But it's not restful at all.\\n\\nAnd I spent around one night out of two at the hospital.\\n\\nThe health of the person hospitalized was getting worse.\\n\\nWe were at the respiratory section of the hospital.\\n\\nEvery few days, we could saw people covered by something like a bag. It doesn't take very long for your brain to understand why. And it was a lot of people.\\n\\nOne more month at the hospital passed, the health of the person we were here for became really bad. She had to be transferred to a palliative care hospital... This was announcing the worst.\\n\\nPalliative care is a care with the purpose of improving the quality of the life of people with very serious illness and in big pain. They try to decrease the pain as much as possible. Most of the time it is before a person dies (although it's not always the case).\\n\\nMy friend's family member was suffering so much. I had never saw in my life, with my eyes, in front of me, this kind of suffering. Begging for death...\\n\\nEveryday I wish I could help more. That I could do something... But I felt disarmed, powerless.\\n\\nAnd after two weeks in this last hospital, we lost her.\\n\\nI will never forget this moment.\\n\\nI was alone in the \\\"family\\\" room with the friend of my friend's sister. We let my friend and her sister alone. So they could have some time with their family member.\\n\\nOne of the nurse came to us, almost like she was in a hurry, and said :\\n\\n\\\"You should go confort them now, she is gone.\\\"\\n\\nWe ran to the room where they were.\\n\\nIt was an heartbreaking moment, a moment where you can try to do anything you want it stays inconsolable. But it was also a relief, to all the pain the person had to endure from the beginning of her illness to this day...\\n\\nAfter a while we had to leave to go back home. But before we leave, we had to take all the stuff disposed in the room.\\n\\nI didn't want my friend and her sister to go back inside the room, because the body of their family member was still inside.\\n\\nSo I went to get all the stuff alone.\\n\\nAlone with the corpse, it was very different.\\n\\nIt was quiet, very quiet.\\n\\nI couldn't help myself from looking at her. I was hoping for the body not to move during the time I took all the stuff out. I was a very strange experience. I could maybe talk about it in another text.\\n\\nNow that you have a bit of context. Let's talk about the panic attacks.\\n\\n### The Second Trigger and The First Panic Attack\\n\\nMy very first attack wasn't after the death of my friend's family member. It was before.\\n\\nI had to go back from Paris to Montpellier to see my family and friends, and also because I had an important meeting there. It was a month after the beginning.\\n\\nBut I also needed to think about nothing, I couldn't.\\n\\nSo I went party, big party.\\n\\nWith one of my good friends we went to a bar we like and then to a night club, we were the two of us and we took a full bottle of vodka at the club, after litters of alcohol at the bar...\\n\\nI just wanted to forget it all during this one night.\\n\\nBut please, try not to do the same mistake the following cocktail it poison. \\n\\n> ☠️ Energy Drink + Alcohol = Poison\\n\\nThe next day I felt really bad.\\n\\nMy friend in Paris announced me that the health was worst than before. I decided to go back to Paris the following day.\\n\\nBut this last night in Montpellier... Alone in my room. Something happened, something that never happened before.\\n\\nI died.\\n\\nWell not really, obviously, but that what I thought.\\n\\nIt was the first time of my life I felt this sensation.\\n\\nI was just trying to rest in my bed, ready to sleep.\\n\\nAnd my heart stopped. But it's not what I felt the most.\\n\\nWhat I really felt was one second after it, when an heavy beat happened.\\n\\nIt moved my whole body. And another one, few second after the first.\\n\\nI didn't know what was happening and I completely lost my mind for the first time in my life.\\n\\nMy heart started to beat faster, and faster, and faster. I didn't know it could beat that fast. Sometimes with the strange heavy beat, like my heart was missing some beats.\\n\\nI was loosing all control of my body, I was certain, it was my last night.\\n\\nI was going to die.\\n\\nI didn't know how to react, so I called the emergencies.\\n\\nThey asked me basic questions about heart diseases and thought that it wasn't necessary for them to move.\\n\\nI was alone against myself. In my little flat. Trying to survive and get out of one thing I didn't experienced nor knew the name of :  a panic attack.\\n\\nI remember that I took a shower that night to try to calm myself down. Because my whole body was trembling. I don't really remember after how long I went to sleep nor how.\\n\\n## My new daily life\\n\\n### Nights\\n\\nI hated the night, I hated this particular moment, just before you go to bed.\\n\\nBecause I knew what was about to happen, because it happened around 4 times a week.\\n\\nAlways the night, when I was starting to rest on my bed.\\n\\nImpossible to rest, impossible to fall asleep.\\n\\nIt's starting over and over again. This missing heartbeat and this heavy heartbeat just after it.\\n\\nThe rhythm accelerating, the lose of control over my body, the trembling...\\n\\nI was becoming mad !\\n\\nLittle by little I started to note how I was feeling (you saw the note at the beginning).\\n\\nI didn't know at this time that it would help me.\\n\\nIt was an advice I received, to keep track of my general mood, and my progression against the crisis.\\n\\nI remember now that I almost always tried to take a shower to calm it when it happened at night.\\n\\nBut one thing I did that I find funny now is the following, I was going out, walking around the street. But not randomly. I was walking in direction of the closest hospital, and I was walking there for a long time until I get better. Just in case of something happen I would be already close to the place where someone could help me.\\n\\nThis hospital was strange, at night you couldn't enter without ringing. And I didn't want to ring.\\n\\nI was too scared to ring for nothing. It wouldn't have bothered me as much to enter and speak with someone. But I not ringing.\\n\\nSomewhere deep in my brain, I knew my crisis was bullshit. So I was just walking around sometimes for hours.\\n\\nOne day I recorded myself speaking while I was walking during my panic attack. Unfortunately the next day I found out that the audio was corrupted. And I never recorded myself again.\\n\\nIt would have been interesting to hear what was in this audio. Because you don't remember everything you do or say when you have this kind of attack, in my case at least.\\n\\nSo yes, that's it. Basically my nights were this way:\\n\\n* going to sleep very late because I was scared to never wake up\\n* panic attack happening\\n* going to shower and/or going out for a walk\\n* going back home and waiting until i'm too tired to keep being awake\\n* then literally falling asleep.\\n\\nI remember that one day, I left my flat and walked to the city because I really didn't want to be alone. After thirty minutes of walk at night, I arrived to a night club. It was a Wednesday I think, because the large room was closed, and there were only a dozens of person at the second floor in the club. It was a little room, all the lights were blue. Above the dance-floor was a big pipe, it was a big aeration, I remember that I liked to stay under it because it felt like I could breath better. There was little bar where I took a beer. Then I sat down watching people dance for an hour or two, before I came back home. It helped.\\n\\nDuring this period of time, the only thing I was happy for was the morning. I was so grateful to be alive every morning, because I went to sleep with the feeling that I wouldn't make it during the night.\\n\\nThis thoughts is one of the most impacting thought I remind from these crisis.\\n\\nI just wanted to wake up and be alive one more day.\\n\\nIt helped me to put a lot of things into perspective.\\n\\n### Doctors\\n\\nLet's talk about the doctors and healing system in France.\\n\\nDuring a year and a half, I've seen my \\\"family\\\" doctor more than 22 times and I was really forcing myself not to go often. I knew it was not really useful and it I went there for not really important things. I often took appointment just to cancel them right after.\\n\\nMy doctor is great, she helped me as she could during this difficult time. She advised me to see different specialists, related to the brain, the heart, the stomach, the eyes, the muscles, the teeth, the veins... Yes, I saw a lot.\\n\\nThankfully, I live in France, and I had free healthcare even-though it's not all free.\\n\\nYou aren't always  100% reimbursed for health in France it will depends on the doctor, the speciality of the doctor, and if you have or not a complementary insurance.\\n\\nI couldn't afford all of the consultations without the help from France healthcare system.\\n\\nBack to the doctors.\\n\\nThe first specialist I saw was a cardiologist, obviously. Everything was related to my heart to me, I was always with a pain in the chest, and with the missing beat and everything, the cardiologist was the obvious choice.\\n\\nI went to see her and she told me almost just one word: \\\"**extrasystoles\\\".** After she added, that it wasn't very dangerous and that a lot of person have it and live with it.\\n\\nBefore I leave she also mentioned : \\\"Your heartbeat is a little bit too fast, do some sport.\\\"\\n\\nAlright that's all ? I'm all fine then.\\n\\nAm I fixed now ?\\n\\nNow that I can put a word on my \\\"condition\\\" : Extrasystoles\\n\\nBut what exactly is an extrasystole ?\\n\\nIt is **a premature heart beat**, here is the wikipedia definition :\\n\\n> A premature heart beat is a heart rhythm disorder corresponding to a premature contraction of one of the chambers of the heart. Premature heart beats come in two different types, premature atrial contractions and premature ventricular contractions. Often they cause no symptoms but may present with fluttering in the chest or a skipped beat. Typically have no long term complications.\\n> They most often happen naturally but may be associated with caffeine, nicotine, or stress. Usually no treatment is needed.\\n\\nThe doctor explained me that the heart is beating thanks to some electric circuit passing through different points (for example A,B,C,D).\\n\\nAnd I have some **B'** point in the circuit that also have electricity passing through. Most of the time I don't feel anything because it is lighter than the main circuit.\\n\\nBut sometimes, with fatigue, stress, anxiety, alcohol, coffee, tea... The electricity of the B' point can be stronger and the beat is prematurely triggered. Which leads to a strong heartbeat followed by a net stop of the heart for a second.\\n\\nThat is exactly how it felt, a very heavy heartbeat. It could wake me up at night, and then, silence.\\n\\nTotal silence.\\n\\nYou heart stops.\\n\\nIt might be for a second but I was in a period of my life I was really focused on my body.\\n\\nI could focus easily on my heartbeat.\\n\\nHearing. Each of. The beats. Feeling. Each of. The beats.\\n\\nI can guarantee you that when you don't feel nor hear it anymore, a second feels like an eternity.\\n\\nAnd your brain has plenty of time to think that you are dead, wondering if it will start over to beat or never again.\\n\\nAlright, now I know, extrasystole it is.\\n\\nWhat next, can I just forget about it and live with it?\\n\\nI know it's not very dangerous, just annoying. My panic attacks should disappear, isn't it ?\\n\\nOf course not.\\n\\nEverything continued, and worst than before.\\n\\nI remember this time when I was in a freelancing mission, I had to go to a little city near Toulon in the South of France.\\n\\nThere I would stay around two to four days a week before going back to Montpellier, it was a part remote job.\\n\\nI was sleeping in Airbnbs, alone, and no surprise I also had panic attack there.\\n\\nOnce, I lived in a little flat next to the owners house. It was great, I felt more secure in case of emergency because they were very close.\\n\\nOne night, I had an horrible attack, my body started trembling a lot, I sweated, my heart went so mad, more than ever. I thought : \\\"If it continue to beat this fast, I am dead\\\".\\n\\nI felt like I had fever, I couldn't breath correctly... So I called owners to know if they had a thermometer and/or any drugs to help.\\n\\nThey had no thermometers but proposed me some Paracetamol.\\n\\nI decided to call the emergency.\\n\\nI had to explain everything, this time they decided to send me a medic. As I was in a little city, and because it was late in the night it took more than an hour.\\n\\nOn hour against myself.\\n\\nI put youtube videos, music, walked on every single squared centimeters of the flat that existed, twice.\\n\\nAnd the medic finally arrived.\\n\\n\\\\-Tell me what's happening ?\\n\\nI told him everything, and he gave me a little pill and said: \\\"Put it in your mouth and let it melt\\\"\\n\\nI don't know exactly why I just took it and put it in my mouth before asking what it was.\\n\\n\\\\-\\\"Xanax\\\"\\n\\n\\\\-Oh.\\n\\n\\\\-\\\"Mister I think you are a bit too anxious, it will help you to be better and go to sleep tonight\\\"\\n\\nI felt a bit strange after taking it, probably more calm, more relaxed, and I was smiling sometimes.\\n\\nI finally felt asleep one hour after taking it.\\n\\nThe next morning everything was better. I went to work like nothing happened, and life continued normally.\\n\\nUntil it happened again.\\n\\nAnd again, and again...\\n\\nI think it's time to go back another time to my family doctor, and I told her :\\n\\n\\\"I'm sure there is something, I have pain in my chest and left arm, and my brain and... please help me...\\\"\\n\\nNew specialist to see : an angiologist (for veins and ateres). Nothing.\\n\\nBack to family doctor, new specialist to see : Osteopathe. No amelioration.\\n\\nBack to family doctor, new things to do :\\n\\n* Brain scanner, Nothing.\\n* Chest X-ray, Nothing.\\n* Stomach ultrasound scan, \\\"Are you anxious ?\\\".\\n* Ophthalmologist, \\\"Nothing, just watch it, you might have glaucoma, come back in two years\\\".\\n* Rheumatologist, \\\"After 3 sessions of injection in my back, no amelioration\\\".\\n* IRM, \\\"Nothing\\\".\\n\\nBack to the family doctor, she said :\\n\\n\\\"We tried a lot of things, there is one more doctor you could see, it's like a doctor house.\\\"\\n\\nI haven't seen him yet, but it is still an option today. I will talk about it in the next part.\\n\\nLet's finish this part with a good new !\\n\\nIn parallels to all of this story, I had another condition, called chronic sinusitis which is an inflammation of the sinus. It causes heavy pain around the sinuses, head aches, etc.\\n\\nI had it every single year in the winter, for 2 to 3 months.\\n\\nIn 2018 it continued after winter, I had it for more than 6 month in a row, I had to do something.\\n\\nI went to see a dentist : \\\"We have to remove the 4 wisdom teeth\\\"\\n\\nBut we will make a very precise X-ray radioscopy before.\\n\\nMonths passed, I had to wait around 2 to 3 month between each appointment with this dentist... I saw him 3 times before the actual chirurgical intervention.\\n\\nOn the x-ray they saw that my two bottom wisdom teeth was almost touching my nerves, and one of the two in the top was the reason of my sinusitis. The teeth was almost inside my sinus, and because of it, my sinusitis couldn't heal.\\n\\nAfter more than a year, the day of the removal has finally come ! I will not continue on this story too long I could write another article about it.\\n\\nBut, attention spoiler, after the operation the sinusitis disapeared and I don't have it anymore. Thanks my dentist 🙏\\n\\nIt gave me a lot of hope about medical care. After all the doctor I saw for my chest pain, and panic attacks without any results, I finally has a great outcome.\\n\\nEven though the removal of my wisdom teeth helped me to reduced the headaches in top of making the sinusitis disappear, it didn't help for the panic attack and chest pain, unfortunately.\\n\\nAnyway, let's see how I got out of this.\\n\\n### Cure and healing process\\n\\nI couldn't continue to live like this.\\n\\nAfter more than a year, being insecure, being fearful, loosing a lot of confidence, and loosing trust in my body and mental.\\n\\nI had to do something.\\n\\nMost of the time I only allowed myself to do one thing at the time. My goal was to identify the things that helped me the most to improve my health. Every time I saw a doctor or tried a treatment, I noted the results.\\n\\nBut then I changed my plans.\\n\\nI knew that the magnesium helped me a bit to sleep better, I knew that I had to do some sport, I knew that I already saw psychologist in the past and it didn't hurt me at all. And my doctor gave me the advice to see a physiotherapist.\\n\\nI saw the physiotherapist twice a week at first, than once a week for around a year.\\n\\nMassage and stretching. But the massages wasn't always pleasant contrary to one want might think. Jaw massage isn't pleasant, it hurts, chest massage aswell. Only back massage wasn't bad.\\n\\nAnd stretching was awful, so difficult to me, I realized how inflexible I am.\\n\\nThat's it, my new plan :\\n\\n* Physiotherapist\\n* Magnesium everyday for 2 months\\n* Psychologist every week for 5 weeks\\n* Sport every week day\\n* Less work\\n\\nI also tried meditation twice but I wasn't convinced by it in group. I stopped it to have more time available in my day.\\n\\nAnd I'm forgetting one key in this healing process, my diary, I wrote a lot in it.\\n\\nIt helped me to keep a trace of every improvement my health could have.\\n\\nAnd to never loose motivation to continue to seek for healing, because I could always see my progress.\\n\\nI wonder if at some point, without it, I could withdraw onto myself and depress. It was almost the case.\\n\\nSeeing the psychologist helped me, it is always great to speak.\\n\\nI like to see a psychologist like someone that doesn't really care about my life and this way I allow myself to tell him everything I want, how I want, and without being judge. His job was to listen to me and help me to speak. Actually it's him that advised me to try meditation courses.\\n\\nI had to talk with him about a lot of thing going into my life now and before, I will maybe write about it in others texts.\\n\\nSport was great too, it helped me to bring back some confidence onto myself, and to better understand how my body worked. I went to sport with a good friend, I think I couldn't be motivated enough to go alone.\\n\\nDecreasing my amount of work was usefull to do all of this things and get more rest.\\n\\nKeeping track of my panic attack showed me that from all these actions, things started to get better and the attacks happened less often.\\n\\n## The end\\n\\nAround May 2019 the attacks happened only twice a month, around July only once a month...\\n\\n**And since October 2019 I didn't have any panic attack.**\\n\\nWhat a relief.\\n\\nI once wrote in my diary :\\n\\n> J'ai tout relu, ça m'a fait pleurer... J'avais oublié la force de ces crises d'angoisse.. Ça me les a fait revivre. Je suis vraiment reconnaissant de ne plus en avoir aujourd'hui et de mieux m'en sortir niveau sommeil également. Les douleurs quand à elles sont toujours présentes mais je vis avec. J'ai mis plus d'un an et demi à me sortir de ces crises d'angoisses de merde... Putain. Mais je ne sais toujours pas pourquoi j'en ai eu ni comment je men suis sorti.\\n\\n\\\"I read it all again, it made me cry... I forgot how heavy were these anxiety crisis. It made my relive them. I am very grateful not to have them today, and to have a better sleep. For the pain, they are still here today, but I live with them. It took me more than a year and a half to get rid of those fu\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* anxiety crisis... Fu\\\\*\\\\*. But I still don't know \\\\[exactly\\\\] how nor why I got rid of it.\\\"\\n\\n## Today\\n\\nYes, I still have the chest pains today, (September 2021 last update).\\n\\nI dream about the day I will be able to edit this part to tell that I am freed from that.\\n\\nNevertheless, today I learned how to live with it, and to prevent myself from having any panic attack caused by the fear of the pain.\\n\\nI saw in total 4 cardiologists for it did a lot of tests, 48h tests, effort tests, ultrasound scans, radioscopy...\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8nUD_AQeV7lCjRSDlrtSp.jpg?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\nNothing has been found yet.\\n\\nEarlier in this text I told about a \\\"Doctor House\\\" his real job is : internist doctor.\\n\\nThey know a lot of pathologies, a lot of conditions and they try to find unthought possibilities about your condition.\\n\\nI haven't seen one yet but I might go to see one next year (you have a lot of wait before having an appointment with them).\\n\\nHaving these pains didn't disallow me to be happy today.\\n\\nIt didn't handicaps me and I can live normally.\\n\\nAlthough it taught me a lot of things.\\n\\nWhat is essential in life, and how lucky we are to be alive.\\n\\nThat you can't control everything that is happening to you.\\n\\nThat you can't trust everything you feel, hear, smell or see.\\n\\nThat there is always a solution.\\n\\nThat I was stronger than I thought.\\n\\nThat people you love are precious.\\n\\nNot to be so scared of death, it doesn't means I want to go there.\\n\\nThat life allows us to do so many great things.\\n\\nThat I am more lucky than a lot of person.\\n\\nThat complaining is only time wasting.\\n\\nAnd a lot more I can't think of because it's now part of me.\\n\\nI hope I could help you understand what it is and if it happens to you I hope it will help you to know that you are not alone and that it is possible to get out of it. Don't hesitate to talk about it it is important to get help and get rid of it.\",\"timestamp\":1639611006,\"title\":\"💥 How I Got Out of Panic and Anxiety Attacks\"},\"digest\":\"5ZTSjIWDB4zqY74MjJJqsV9d45qswp5nnDhUu8OrfUA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x26f755132D69dA9e2C2B27cF80e65aE0fa79Bf15\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nySNejJpBLLWXa5QVrJpO-EfxlG7kEWmK1EORRnXyHw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wgMc0ZwVJRDzdEvlguhBNYau7bKtCQBmZ8I8SjnAutk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ytErw82JpOzzXlJifEhv1Vwo91wMrkia5RyBA3uNJfjuTvcDME4gAFaJDZgKa6ST18_Iwe8N8kvb4zRNyLzdNw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe367b4d52bcb1c224a1779bac8b613b6445fb115f6b8ea8404555f153d78c64762e67fba92b0357bd67f2d680861b3971f4ba94e3f07c14b45f88e61a8ab8e6e1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nySNejJpBLLWXa5QVrJpO-EfxlG7kEWmK1EORRnXyHw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wgMc0ZwVJRDzdEvlguhBNYau7bKtCQBmZ8I8SjnAutk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"5ZTSjIWDB4zqY74MjJJqsV9d45qswp5nnDhUu8OrfUA\"}"
