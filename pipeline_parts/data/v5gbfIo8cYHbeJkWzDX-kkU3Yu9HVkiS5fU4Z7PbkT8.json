"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"2021 was a successful year for the crypto world.\\n\\nBitcoin and Ethereum repeatedly broke all-time highs; The total market value of cryptocurrency even reached $3 trillion; The NFT craze that exploded due to Curry and other sports stars; Facebook that changed its name to Meta, as the opening of Metaverse…\\n\\nThis year, traditional capital and technology upstarts started are locked in a struggle. Sequoia Capital adjusted its operation structure, changed its Twitter profile, and made every effort to bet on the Web 3 field; Musk choked on Web 3 and opposed top venture capital A16Z. Google technologies and the investment market were very excited about Web 3.\\n\\nThe magical 2021 is coming to an end. What can we expect when we look towards 2022?\\n\\n**What happened in 2021?**\\n\\nIn 2021, the market value of cryptocurrency reached new highs a few times.\\n\\nThe total market value of cryptocurrency was only $779.5 billion at the beginning of the year. In January and May, it successively surpassed $1 trillion and $2 trillion, respectively. It also reached a new record of $3 trillion on November 10.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin’s dominant position in the cryptocurrency market has been weakened. The market value of Bitcoin declined from 70.66% at the beginning of the year to a low of 38.8%. This is also the first time since mid-2018 that the market value of Bitcoin has fallen below 50%.\\n\\nBehind the data, the main reason was the overall development of the crypto ecosystem, and Bitcoin is no longer unique. The market value gap between Bitcoin and Ethereum is narrowing. More and more innovative currencies are emerging.\\n\\nOver the past year, the market value of cryptocurrency has been shuffled. Forked currencies (BCH, BSV) continue to decline; old public chains such as EOS and TRX failed to recover; meme tokens such as DOGE and SHIB once reached the top ten or even the top five in market value ranking; smart contract platforms ecosystems other than Ethereum Layer 1 such as Solana and Polygon, had risen and occupied seats in the top ten list successively.\\n\\nIn 2021, more traditional concepts were laid out in the crypto world.\\n\\nSequoia Capital, one of the largest, oldest, and most successful venture capital funds in the world, played a DAO on Twitter profile at the end of the year after laying out the public chain, exchange, Layer2, and NFT track.\\n\\nIn June, President of El Salvador Nayib Bukele had submitted a draft bill to the country’s legislature for application regarding Bitcoin to become the country’s legal tender. On September 7, the bill came into force, and Bitcoin finally became the legal tender.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*D-f3Yd_sqk5dkw6GPEJlzg.png)\\n\\nBloomberg expected that, as stimulated by the proliferation of revolutionary technologies such as crypto US dollar and non-fungible tokens (NFT), the United States will fully accept cryptocurrency and introduce appropriate supervision in 2022, which will have some impact on the price rise.\\n\\nAfter a magnificent year in 2021, development in the value of cryptocurrency will be a challenge as well as an opportunity for everyone in 2022. What will be the next rising cryptocurrency in 2022? What is the next wealth wave?\\n\\n**The Next Wealth Wave**\\n\\nNo matter how 2022 begins or ends, there is no doubt that we are still “busy” in this “crowded” market. Gen Z crypto users are curious to explore and experience the world. A survey among Australian crypto users in October this year has shown more than a quarter of them plan to use digital assets as part of Christmas gifts during this holiday season.\\n\\nCuriosity and thirst for knowledge about innovation ability are the sources of power to stimulate the development of each crypto world.\\n\\nIn a survey of “cryptocurrency forecast for 2022” by CoinList, when asked about what kind of projects respondents would like to see on CoinList in 2022, the first answer was games (56.5%). It highlights that games will become a turning point for the large-scale adoption of blockchain. DeFi (52.1%) and NFT (41.6%) are the second and third largest demand categories, followed by L1 / L2 (31.4%), infrastructure (28.3%), Social tokens (22.8%), and Governance (16.2%).\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*g50A-r-7RdYuLPeFetCnkg.png)\\n\\nIn terms of the protocol layer, the Ethereum ecosystem is unique. In the long run, there is no other platform that has promoted the innovation of cryptocurrency and Metaverse as Ethereum.\\n\\nHowever, Ethereum had pushed this summer’s NFT frenzy to a critical point. Hence, many retail investors were unable to use it due to high gas fees and scalability problems, prompting them to find alternatives.\\n\\nThere was no L1 project growing faster than Solana, which had posed an increasing threat to Ethereum.\\n\\nWhen asked about the public chain interaction outside of Ethereum in 2022, more than 56% of the respondents said Solana, followed by Binance Smart Chain (48.8%), Polkadot (47.9%), Avalanche (25%), Polygon (25%), Cosmos (17.5%) and Terra (14.2%).\\n\\nCrypto enthusiasts who had experienced the ups and downs of the crypto market understood that the early bird gets the worm. The crypto market is often social and memetic, and the capital itself is highly mobile.\\n\\nQuickly capturing cutting-edge crypto assets is a necessary skill for each investor and their main consideration when choosing a trading platform.\\n\\n**Outlook of 2022**\\n\\nIn 2021, the centralized exchanges remained the center of value capture.\\n\\nAccording to the data of The Block Research, the trading volume of centralized trading platforms had exceeded $14 trillion in 2021. As of December 24, the trading volume of the centralized trading platform has increased by 689% annually in 2020 (about $1.8 trillion in 2020).\\n\\nThe development of the crypto market has its own rhythm. If a project suddenly becomes popular and takes the lead in its track, the next similar hot project may appear soon. Now the hot spot rotation is getting faster, and it is closer to reality.\\n\\nIn 2022, for the vast majority of investors, it is particularly critical to choose a reliable and cutting-edge trading platform.\\n\\nOn December 25, MEXC officially issued a document on social media, announcing that MEXC had recently signed relevant agreements with a number of international investment funds. In order to better explore the international market, the new joint board of directors has adjusted the governance structure of MEXC, and the original management team will be gradually replaced by a new international team. Then, withdraw after the retirement of Chinese users.\\n\\nAs early as 2020, MEXC began to layout the global market, set a global compliance operation strategy, and successively obtained licenses from Estonia, the United States, Australia, Canada, Switzerland, and other five countries. It is one of the platforms with the largest number of cryptocurrency transaction operation licenses in the world.\\n\\nSo far, MEXC has launched four new launchpad activities, and the users who have obtained the quota of CBX, GENE, TRVL, and CLY have increased by 3080%, 4633%, 1642%, and 1150%, respectively. CLY later launched Coinbase.\\n\\nIn 2021, the growth percentage of MEXC overseas users reached 1100%. Then, the growth percentage of annual transaction volume exceeded 700%, and overseas users accounted for 70% of the total users.\\n\\nAt the end of 2021, Binance dollar BNB has steadily ranked among the top 10. The price once rose nearly $700. At present, it is temporarily reported as $535, with an increase of 1350% during the year.\\n\\nIn 2022, the centralized exchanges will also be reshuffled and reshaped under several waves of attacks. Who can snap up the next wealth wave codes has become an increasingly pressing issue for every investor.\",\"timestamp\":1641268596,\"title\":\"Outlook of Crypto World in 2022: What Would be the Next Wealth Wave?\"},\"digest\":\"oUQsiEBZTgq6exrAsfuQopjnvojKN1as-aduF-BuY6U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x892455B5c8FA7dA8E60DFcFD56977aeA549B022a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eOKcRMW2bLVm2bHd9FAjSImI7A_gZgLPIN58qpXSFaA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"rJ3_kuApn_Mar0lgW1i9Oi4Rh291VpSyc7skR1Ya58w\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"U840jIFQ0cNJgNcuNTxHB61Y2YU5fLlO0693fxlOYhR-gYRVqiiEXkGwR7qRloNSjhL5A2rVn32jyJrkTEhPhQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c9bb996af2fed9c63be5435d2a4358a46120368721552a5af85025951e0b5b417d7f246de85a7e69db4f23a2170f30c256dc1d5573559db32bd30b09ffdbb041c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eOKcRMW2bLVm2bHd9FAjSImI7A_gZgLPIN58qpXSFaA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"rJ3_kuApn_Mar0lgW1i9Oi4Rh291VpSyc7skR1Ya58w\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"UaSGU5LbLcCN27tMmK8G-BdDuwy3_A8cozALAt0C8Ag\"}"
