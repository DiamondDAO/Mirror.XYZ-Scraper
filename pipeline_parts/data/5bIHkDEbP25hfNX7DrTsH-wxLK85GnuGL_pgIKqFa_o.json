Wash yourself of yourself.”\\n\\n(*Rumi*)[\\\\[1\\\\]](#_ftn1)\\n\\n## 4.1. Free Will\\n\\nThe laws of physics are wonderful, not least because they show us some of the magic formulas behind the seeming mystery of life and the universe. They are also good and proper ‘laws’ — that is, they are intended to be equivalent across space and time.\\n\\nIn addition to showing us the equivalence of energy and matter, we have the great Albert Einstein to thank for also showing us that ‘here’ and ‘now’ are equivalent. His theory of general relativity combined ‘space’ and ‘time’ in a way that had never before been imagined.\\n\\nEinstein has left us unable to talk about the current moment as if it exists independently in the universe. Time is not a universal independent thing that exists and that we measure with a clock. Entropy, which will be explored later, is relevant to the question of the unusualness and usefulness of life and the changing nature of energy and matter. This movement of energy and matter is also what gives us the feeling of the flow of time.\\n\\nYou might wonder when I am going to start this chapter on freedom to will. I have. I have exercised my freedom to start the chapter by talking about other things. The previous sentence was less flippant than it might first appear.\\n\\n## “The idea that a well-defined now exists throughout the universe is an illusion, an illegitimate extrapolation of our own experience. It is like the point where the rainbow touches the forest. We think that we can see it — but, if we go to look for it, it isn’t there.”\\n\\n(*Carlo Rovelli*)[\\\\[2\\\\]](#_ftn2)\\n\\nI have been looking for the rainbow we call freedom to will and have found that it does not really exist in the world, at least not as it is often described. In the next chapter we will consider what is the closest quality that we can know exists: distance from the normal behaviour of the surrounding population (or population in question) — that is to say, relative freedom of action.[\\\\[3\\\\]](#_ftn3)\\n\\nIn writing this book I was most apprehensive about writing about this topic and that of ‘suffering, sacrifice and compassion’. I left this section in square brackets ‘\\\\[\\\\]’ until near the end of writing the first draft — yet once I had started writing it flowed so quickly and easily that it seemed to write itself. Life has a wonderful sense of irony.\\n\\n![Image: Pxhere.com, public domain.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*0o_9afEAHPL3EnqJbLq3ew.jpeg?size=medium)\\n\\n![(Ted Hughes)\\\\[4\\\\]](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*Nb1HyOfZTd_v65p7R1pk1A.png?size=medium)\\n\\n## 4.2. Freedom of Action\\n\\nI used most of the short subchapter on free will above to remind readers of some important laws of physics. It is fundamental in any consideration of reason and ethics to be reminded that all life-forms are subject to these universal physical laws. It also helps remind us of the limits of what we can meaningfully talk about when we discuss ‘free will’.\\n\\n![Matt Brown, ‘I want! I want!’, 2018 CE, based on William Blake, For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise, Plate 11, 1826 CE, Wikipedia, public domain.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\\\*wUn22P_TEjVvzRnd9my8jA.png)\\n\\nIt should go without saying, but just in case, we cannot rationally will something that is impossible,[\\\\[5\\\\]](#_ftn5) though we can still desire it.[\\\\[6\\\\]](#_ftn6)\\n\\nStrong free will could be described as the notion that life-forms have the absolute ability (are not restricted; are ‘free’) to choose paths of action and enact them (will) subject only to physical laws. Action and decision-making can be embedded in code or a result of conscious reflection or both. For humans, the effect of culture is also very significant on action.\\n\\nEven an imprisoned animal, such as a human, still retains some freedom of action whilst losing its liberty — its ability to move around is constrained but within that smaller space it may still make some choices based on its desires and may have some physical movement.\\n\\nLike many concepts in this book, the notion of individual humans having free will may seem so obvious that you might wonder that it deserves a whole chapter.\\n\\nYet it is a concept that has exercised the greatest minds in history and continues to do so. So much so that the experts rarely agree what the term even means, never mind if it exists and how much of it exists.\\n\\n## “Spinoza was the first to apply with strict consistency the idea of an all-pervasive determinism to human thought, feeling, and action. In my opinion, his point of view has not gained general acceptance by all those striving for clarity and logical rigor only because it requires not only consistency of thought, but also unusual integrity, magnanimity, and — modesty.”\\n\\n(*Albert Einstein*)[\\\\[7\\\\]](#_ftn7)\\n\\nAs you are reading this chapter and this book, be wary of finding yourself seeking to reduce everything to narrow logical proof or binary 0-or-1 answers.\\n\\nInstead, be willing to accept seeming contradictions and hold those doubts and demurs in mind, whilst maintaining an open mind to diverse information. For example, one can believe in relative freedom of action (enacting unusual behaviour) without believing in some form of strong free will (power to make decisions and enact them independently of normal cause and effect). \\n\\nIf you are the sort of person that must (having no real free will in the matter) collapse mystery into certainty and quantity, then be warned that whatever answer you comfort yourself with is unlikely to be meaningful. If there was an equation that gave us an answer in this field, it would beg the question as to what the question means.\\n\\n## “Again, no one knows how or by what means the mind moves the body, nor how many various degrees of motion it can impart to the body, nor how quickly it can move it. Thus, when men say that this or that physical action has its origin in the mind, which latter has dominion over the body, they are using words without meaning, or are confessing in specious phraseology that they are ignorant of the cause of the said action, and do not wonder at it.”\\n\\n(*Benedictus de Spinoza*)[\\\\[8\\\\]](#_ftn8)\\n\\nLet us begin by building up a picture of freedom based on physical laws and the wider community of life, so as to get closer to understanding what on Earth people might be talking about when they talk about free will.[\\\\[9\\\\]](#_ftn9) Taking an issue away from a specific use case often allows us to return with a clearer picture and a better understanding of any implicit assumptions. This can remove sources of confusion in our application.\\n\\nSo, coming back to that seemingly flippant comment:\\n\\n*Did I really have freedom in how to write a section on ‘free will’ and its content? If so, how much? And how would you or I know? How might we measure it?*\\n\\nThe first question for a scientist is: *what useful work would we need to do to measure the possible amount of freedom available in writing a book on ethics with a chapter on free will?*\\n\\nLeave aside for now the issue of whom is choosing an action and what their subjective view is about that choice. For example, I could write no words in such a chapter, or I could write a very, very long chapter. However, there are clearly some constraints within the publishing system that make those outliers so improbable that — although they have some theoretical quantity of possibility — the ability to exhibit freedom in those respects becomes near impossible within the practical constraints of the system (in this case, publishing a physical or digital book).\\n\\nBefore considering this point further it is necessary to define what we mean by exhibiting freedom to do anything. As we live in a physical world, we must first consider what any observable freedom means before we start to wrestle with this thorny notion of freedom to will (any) things and the degrees of freedom to do so. In physics and chemistry:\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\\\*QnmRG1AX4rNP74MoP-TZvA.png)\\n\\n“[Coord system CA](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Coord_system_CA_0.svg)”, Wikipedia, Jorge Stolfi, 2009 CE, public domain.\\n\\n## “a degree of freedom is an independent physical parameter in the formal description of the state of a physical system. The set of all states of a system is known as the system’s phase space, and the degrees of freedom of the system are the dimensions of the phase space.”\\n\\n[\\\\[10\\\\]](#_ftn10)\\n\\nThis means that the location of a particle in three dimensions requires three parameters (which are the position coordinates),[\\\\[11\\\\]](#_ftn11) that is, ‘x’, ‘y’ and ‘z’. These are also called Cartesian coordinates after the great French philosopher, mathematician and scientist René Descartes, who gave a more modern algebraic treatment of geometry.\\n\\nThis 3D space is also called Euclidean space after Euclid of Alexandria, considered the founder of geometry, whose ancient axioms still appear to hold true over two millennia later within 3D space. The total number of positions that are possible within a 3D space gives the total ‘phase-space’.\\n\\nThe degrees of freedom within a phase-space are therefore the number of parameters that are able to vary (i.e., be different). The direction and speed at which a particle moves within this can be described in terms of velocity components within the three dimensions of Euclidean space.\\n\\n*What about a larger moving body, like a ship?*\\n\\nShips[\\\\[12\\\\]](#_ftn12) have six degrees of freedom along three axes, called yaw, pitch and roll.\\n\\n![Owen Stanley, “HMS Beagle”, 1841 CE, Wikipedia, public domain](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*3irkNP090EjyUwEdnCbCKw.jpeg)\\n\\n## *“The vertical/Z axis, or yaw axis, is an imaginary line running vertically through the ship and through its centre of mass. A yaw motion is a side-to-side movement of the bow and stern of the ship.*\\n\\n## *The transverse/Y axis, lateral axis, or pitch axis is an imaginary line running horizontally across the ship and through the centre of mass. A pitch motion is an up-or-down movement of the bow and stern of the ship.*\\n\\n## *The longitudinal/X axis, or roll axis, is an imaginary line running horizontally through the length of the ship, through its centre of mass, and parallel to the waterline. A roll motion is a side-to-side or port-starboard tilting motion of the superstructure around this axis.”*[\\\\[13\\\\]](#_ftn13)\\n\\n![“Ships movement on the waves”, Brosen, 2006 CE, Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 (CC BY-SA 3.0)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*bbQUV6b288U8FXICbdJIHw.png)\\n\\n*What about a spaceship?*[\\\\[14\\\\]](#_ftn14)\\n\\n## “A spacecraft in microgravity has six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) of motion. Specifically, it is free to translate along three perpendicular axes — forward and backward, up and down, or left and right. In addition, the spacecraft can rotate about these three axes, termed pitch, yaw, and roll.”\\n\\nSo, a spaceship that is capable of leaving Earth has the same number of degrees of freedom within 3D space as a ship on the sea. The difference between a sailing ship and a spaceship in 3D space is therefore a difference in extent. However, we have been ignoring the time dimension; a spaceship also has additional freedom of action within 4D space-time since it can leave local space-time (unlike a sea-sailing ship). A moving body’s vector (direction of movement and magnitude) is therefore a feature that is relevant to its degrees of freedom.\\n\\n![“Conceptual illustration of both 3D space and time distortion near a mass”, Wikipedia, Lucas Vieira Barbosa, 2017 CE, Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International.](https://miro.medium.com/max/960/1\\\\*roUYSspSlXaVZBg4zybstg.gif)\\n\\nIn Einstein’s space-time, the more accurate representation of coordinates in the universe, a spaceship’s increased velocity gives it the ability to move between locations with markedly different gravitational conditions, where time is relative for each place. We need to use four parameters to specify a location within it (x, y, z, t) given that time is a relevant relative variable that can differ markedly between objects. Space-time therefore adds an additional potential degree of freedom to our existing physical coordinates. Depending on the body in question, there may also be other degrees of measurable freedom (e.g., pressure, temperature).\\n\\nEarlier experiments with relativity attempted to deal with the difficult concept that there is no absolute frame of reference determining the way in which to see ‘reality’ (as represented by space and time). Pictures of physical reality and things within it now need to include time as an additional scalar[\\\\[15\\\\]](#_ftn15) quality,[\\\\[16\\\\]](#_ftn16) in addition to the vector coordinates.\\n\\n![‘Poor time’, algo-art by Peter Pink-Howitt 2021 CE](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\\\*n6ebMNv4ppEJfJyYt0A1VQ.jpeg)\\n\\n## “Poor time!

If you could transport yourself into it, you would see every perspective of a scene at once. But how to project these perspectives on to canvas?”\\n\\n(*Arthur I. Miller*)[\\\\[18\\\\]](#_ftn18)\\n\\nThis is known to have given rise to Cubism and other impacts in respect of abstract modern art. Our new understanding of light, time and space transformed our views of reality.\\n\\n## “Simultaneity in Cubism was one way artists illustrated their understanding of the fourth dimension, meaning that the artist would simultaneously show views of the same subject from different viewpoints — views that would not normally be able to be seen together at the same time in the real world.”\\n\\n(*Beth Gersh-Nesic*)[\\\\[19\\\\]](#_ftn19)\\n\\n![Jean Metzinger, “Blue Bird”, 1912–1913 CE Public Domain](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*D266VW1oyh2weC4b156xsA.jpeg)\\n\\n![“World line”, Wikipedia, K.
