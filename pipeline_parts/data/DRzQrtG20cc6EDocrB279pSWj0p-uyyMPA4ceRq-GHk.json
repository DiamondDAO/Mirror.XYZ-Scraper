"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"#### 16/10/2021\\n\\nA problem I think we have in the Internet is that English has almost the monopoly of textual information, or even textual legitimacy. This is, of course, understandable under the effects of power and *lingua franca*, and the fact that a language is a barrier to entry for the non-speakers people, but we can rethink about the glotopolitics (language relative politics) dinamics of web3.\\n\\nSince this point of view (the critique of English's Internet predominance), we can propose, at least, remember that the lingua franca is not the only one language, and is not the very legitimate one.\\n\\nNevertheless, I also think, beyond the phylosofical thinking itself, that we can improve the linguistic diversity across It's own instrumentalization, that is, the confluece between the ethical and practical purpose (a main goal of web3, as I understand).\\n\\n#### Why Seedphrases?\\n\\nI think we need to increase the number of languages of seedphrases, proactive and not reactively. That is a big improvement to the instrumentalization of minoritarian ones. And, in the Internet, minoritarian means almost “not English”. Ten, fifteen languages are not diversity.\\n\\nIndigenous languages' seedphrases would be interesting according to the fact that many of them can make a possitive use of cryptocurrencies, in their communities and the third world in general\\n\\nWell, I dont't know yet how to do it, but I'wll try someday.\\n\\nI invite all of you to think some practical ways to include minoritarian languages in the development of web3.\",\"timestamp\":1635972202,\"title\":\"Web3, Glotopolitics and Seedphrases\\n\"},\"digest\":\"tfs5ASWdSftNs23XNuPdn4ZK7WxjuHRxugGy0GZOPV0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD0D746A2842AE23DD742A7dfc8B9313EA0F14540\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"OjTHj8MHtmd5MFgQoissL7XOMOkqHryJWRFlZM2jLoA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Bcr64wv5NqvfvG0mbdEctOTEQAE0OZL-3nxhFyGcTvI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"c8wZI376ruZqD1UQauG6PP782bkiq4jlVIP6bbxqhRQI90jHd0CV2E0pC4fedtIej5HnTlMTF7i_CG2YWMbzgw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xdf8d04024d5272aed5eaf491bcbd10de19e4bacf2d53d0f21e6421924e1ba4066334e6c3bcec10e7b5460233ce870e46a802c8f0549619dd643844b735d6ce701c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"OjTHj8MHtmd5MFgQoissL7XOMOkqHryJWRFlZM2jLoA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Bcr64wv5NqvfvG0mbdEctOTEQAE0OZL-3nxhFyGcTvI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"tfs5ASWdSftNs23XNuPdn4ZK7WxjuHRxugGy0GZOPV0\"}"
