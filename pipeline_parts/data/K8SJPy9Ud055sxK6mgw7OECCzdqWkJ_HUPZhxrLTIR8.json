"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"she cried passionately.  Then her voice swiftly became cold and steady, and she talked in the way he imagined she must have talked business with Morgan and Raff at Guvutu.  \\\"Listen to me, Mr. Sheldon.  I like you very well, though you are slow and a muddler; but I want you to understand, once and for all, that I did not come to the Solomons to get married.  That is an affliction I could have accumulated at home, without sailing ten thousand miles after it. I have my own way to make in the world, and I came to the Solomons to do it.  Getting married is not making MY way in the world.  It may do for some women, but not for me, thank you.  When I sit down to talk over the freight on copra, I don't care to have proposals of marriage sandwiched in.  Besides--besides--\\\"\\n\\nHer voice broke for the moment, and when she went on there was a note of appeal in it that well-nigh convicted him to himself of being a brute.\\n\\n\\\"Don't you see?--it spoils everything; it makes the whole situation impossible . . . and . . . and I so loved our partnership, and was proud of it.  Don't you see?--I can't go on being your partner if you make love to me.  And I was so happy.\\\"\\n\\nTears of disappointment were in her eyes, and she caught a swift sob in her throat.\\n\\n\\\"I warned you,\\\" he said gravely.  \\\"Such unusual situations between men and women cannot endure.  I told you so at the beginning.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes; it is quite clear to me what you did.\\\"  She was angry again, and the feminine appeal had disappeared.  \\\"You were very discreet in your warning.  You took good care to warn me against every other man in the Solomons except yourself.\\\"\\n\\nIt was a blow in the face to Sheldon.  He smarted with the truth of it, and at the same time he smarted with what he was convinced was the injustice of it.  A gleam of triumph that flickered in her eye because of the hit she had made decided him.\\n\\n\\\"It is not so one-sided as you seem to think it is,\\\" he began.  \\\"I was doing very nicely on Berande before you came.  At least I was not suffering indignities, such as being accused of cowardly conduct, as you have just accused me.  Remember--please remember, I did not invite you to Berande.  Nor did I invite you to stay on at Berande.  It was by staying that you brought about this--to you-- unpleasant situation.  By staying you made yourself a temptation, and now you would blame me for it.  I did not want you to stay.  I wasn't in love with you then.  I wanted you to go to Sydney; to go back to Hawaii.  But you insisted on staying.  You virtually--\\\"\\n\\nHe paused for a softer word than the one that had risen to his lips, and she took it away from him.\\n\\n\\\"Forced myself on you--that's what you meant to say,\\\" she cried, the flags of battle painting her cheeks.  \\\"Go ahead.  Don't mind my feelings.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All right; I won't,\\\" he said decisively, realizing that the discussion was in danger of becoming a vituperative, schoolboy argument.  \\\"You have insisted on being considered as a man. Consistency would demand that you talk like a man, and like a man listen to man-talk.  And listen you shall.  It is not your fault that this unpleasantness has arisen.  I do not blame you for anything; remember that.  And for the same reason you should not blame me for anything.\\\"\\n\\nHe noticed her bosom heaving as she sat with clenched hands, and it was all he could do to conquer the desire to flash his arms out and around her instead of going on with his coolly planned campaign. As it was, he nearly told her that she was a most adorable boy. But he checked all such wayward fancies, and held himself rigidly down to his disquisition.\\n\\n\\\"You can't help being yourself.  You can't help being a very desirable creature so far as I am concerned.  You have made me want you.  You didn't intend to; you didn't try to.  You were so made, that is all.  And I was so made that I was ripe to want you.  But I can't help being myself.  I can't by an effort of will cease from wanting you, any more than you by an effort of will can make yourself undesirable to me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, this desire! this want! want! want!\\\" she broke in rebelliously.  \\\"I am not quite a fool.  I understand some things. And the whole thing is so foolish and absurd--and uncomfortable.  I wish I could get away from it.  I really think it would be a good idea for me to marry Noa Noah, or Adamu Adam, or Lalaperu there, or any black boy.  Then I could give him orders, and keep him penned away from me; and men like you would leave me alone, and not talk marriage and 'I want, I want.'\\\"\\n\\nSheldon laughed in spite of himself, and far from any genuine impulse to laugh.\\n\\n\\\"You are positively soulless,\\\" he said savagely.\\n\\n\\\"Because I've a soul that doesn't yearn for a man for master?\\\" she took up the gage.  \\\"Very well, then.  I am soulless, and what are you going to do about it?\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1639040643,\"title\":\"This taking for granted!--this when I am ready\"},\"digest\":\"9qnO0Xt-nZkSsngmfOJv77IkptucF8FPbna4nEsAlnQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x90172af57cfCfbdA1dac8055668d7B5df7f90f1E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"XYAg9nd4Uq7oK3mffUib-365dhG3-TXCvGzuaJ-awss\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ckNqM3IkJCWn-ixQPwEozbVpL27jm0bhWPhNhpa4sc0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"p8txMtpDUNVwrvtcn2mDFzegE6EVvqoxlRkWGxE_623Elcsf4k7dQ5iKZUkO2fKMoN51zpTawwIaDPdKoSE6sg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0634123396be3fc588dc914e67b1a25511bd367b4546fcacd1c61146c8fa94f561c50b54078def076c8e320ac3a9f701c15fc5357497da78a146dc12843dfbfd1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"XYAg9nd4Uq7oK3mffUib-365dhG3-TXCvGzuaJ-awss\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ckNqM3IkJCWn-ixQPwEozbVpL27jm0bhWPhNhpa4sc0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"9qnO0Xt-nZkSsngmfOJv77IkptucF8FPbna4nEsAlnQ\"}"
