"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The problems we face as a generation of humans living in this moment are complex and existential. We know that no single person, organization, or even government can overcome these challenges. We must work together — capital, talent, workers, purchasers, governments, foundations, and members in the spirit of radical collaboration and cooperation for us to realize the potential of our collective power to create the change we need.\\n\\nIt is perhaps naively optimistic of me but despite our inability to come together as a nation in so many ways in the past few years — I still have an unwavering belief that collectively we have the talent, tools, and ability to solve these massive problems if we can foster and scale the power of collective action and cooperation.\\n\\nIf we can work together with a shared vision — we have the capital, the tools and technology, and the clear science and data to create innovative new systems to catalyze this era of cooperation.\\n\\n**My Path**\\n\\nI have spent my career focused on helping workers, creatives, entrepreneurs, small business owners, and their families live more stable, secure, healthy, and sustainable lives.\\n\\nI had my first Union job as a grocery bagger in Milwaukee, WI at age 15. I went on to focus on IP and labor law as a law student clerking with Teamster’s Local 237 and after law school as an associate and then partner at Madon, Malin PC a union-side labor law firm.\\n\\nIn 2002 I created AASEP (The American Association of Self-Employed Persons) to provide a core set of portable services and benefits to a growing group of freelancers, designed to fill the gap left by the lack of traditional employment.\\n\\nI am a proven business executive, manager, and attorney, yet have deep expertise in design, UX/UI, coding, strategy, and consumer insights. I have worked to help found dozens of businesses and I built and sold 2 companies on my own: VR gaming and panoramic video technology startup Social Animal, Inc and the digital marketing agency Idea Farmer, LLC.\\n\\nAt Idea Farmer, I worked with global brands such as Whirlpool, Toyota, Microsoft, Dreamworks, and many others to build and execute global digital marketing and media strategy while growing Idea Farmer into the #95 fastest growing company on the Inc. 500.\\n\\nI grew up in Milwaukee, WI, and earned my B.A. from Marquette University and a J.D. from Fordham University School of Law in Manhattan. I currently work from my garage in Carlsbad, CA — surrounded by kids, working constantly while trying my hardest to remain sane, grounded, happy, and healthy.\\n\\n**What’s next?**\\n\\nThe urgency of the issues facing us as a society has provided a clear focus for me. I am working to rapidly create and grow several ventures targeted at catalyzing cooperation and collective action through new associations, DAOs, Ventures, and supporting projects I believe do the same.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/654/1\\\\*bfsJdOEGHdaLXrI6BfKe6w.jpeg)\\n\\nThe fierce urgency of now!\\n\\n## Now active\\n\\n> ***[EVERYONE INC](https://everyoneinc.com/)***\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*hKhG2rCnp6koNEZut4w4mw.png)\\n\\nI co-founded this venture studio focused on participant ownership as an innovation model, we are currently looking for LPs and EIRs to work on the first set of studio ventures.\\n\\n**[The Neurorights Foundation](https://neurorightsfoundation.org/)**\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*GINWBMIr7pFVInAWjYDd1g.png)\\n\\nWe engage the United Nations, regional organizations, national governments, companies, entrepreneurs, investors, scientists, and the public at large to raise awareness about the human rights and ethical implications of neurotechnology.\\n\\n## **Coming Soon -**\\n\\n**The Allied**\\n\\nA community of global leaders in opposition to the rise of authoritarianism\\n\\n**Helpful**\\n\\nA participant ownership platform for professional networked services\\n\\n**Resilient**\\n\\nThe first therapist owned platform for online therapy\\n\\n**TokenSafe**\\n\\nThe world’s safest and easiest way to secure your crypto\\n\\n**Secret Society**\\n\\nA social society and activism DAO developing and supporting blockchain-based startup concepts.\\n\\nI hope you will follow me on Twitter [@tylermalin](http://twitter.com/tylermalin) at <https://tylermalin.medium.com/> to hear the latest and, in the spirit of the era of cooperation — if you have any ideas, projects, or subjects I can add value to please don’t hesitate to reach out directly.\",\"timestamp\":1636103605,\"title\":\"Hi, I’m Tyler — let’s collaborate! - tyler malin - Medium\"},\"digest\":\"wF-_4tU-eKCQQ2s54df07ZXQjzPEC9Mi_PF7MqcXzBg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa6Baa026a54C0a1c4c38F5A49ecC29342B3ef84d\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"EcIJ7qDR5IbxtE0BE9a-HUqtT3i5ETKVbtR0uj8Q8Cc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"y5WtgLTv9IleL77fVpaPuHsquV9SVBQm-AEjoGio7g0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"_dbrbqOmej5p2tr5BJT_khwgakYzUuOannWxKW6op7pgtEzRJZsTbjx7FNxH-cjz7s6hKuIvZeXJ55crPK8Wgg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4ff0f06be66167d011b41d972f531d988dc0813616c6c767e3a15b15f6e93cf74273a0e4374680145e4ca14cb4c1a058b242fd14f41d34d8721f4fe6d35948ba1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"EcIJ7qDR5IbxtE0BE9a-HUqtT3i5ETKVbtR0uj8Q8Cc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"y5WtgLTv9IleL77fVpaPuHsquV9SVBQm-AEjoGio7g0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wF-_4tU-eKCQQ2s54df07ZXQjzPEC9Mi_PF7MqcXzBg\"}"
