"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Hello person. Welcome to Season 1.\\n\\nI’m Yung.Raj & I make beats of various styles & genres.\\n\\nEver since my debut EP ‘Laced Loops’ back in 2018, I’ve been wondering how to go about making an LP (full length album) of all original music. Through a series of various events, I find myself in the middle of it already.\\n\\nI’ve been heavily inspired by legends like J Dilla, Madlib, Knxwledge (to name a few) because of the fearless & prolific attitude they carry with their beats.\\n\\nOver the last 4 years, I’ve done a bunch of 7 day regular beatmaking series.\\n\\n***Think of these beats as timestamps, one for each day, I feel that songs/jams/beats/trax whatever you wanna call them, are timestamps of reality in the sense that they represent to the artist how they were feeling at the time and where they were***\\n\\nIt seems as if they were all part of my training to reach this day!\\n\\nSeason 1 began on Jan 1, 2022 when I found myself sitting in my studio with a fractured elbow (my dominant hand to make things worse) but when I tried creating a piece on Ableton, my right hand came in clutch & I ended up with something I felt comfortable sharing, creating a Timestamp in the process. Making lots of beats is not something that’s new to me & I decided I’m not gonna let my injury get in the way of what I want to do. We’re on Day 14 of Timestamps and it’s already my longest piece of work till date at 42 min 21 secs from 14 Timestamps (12 more to go)\\n\\n[https://beta.catalog.works/spaces/5d0fa7bc-659c-4814-97f5-49dc9d8c13b7](https://beta.catalog.works/spaces/5d0fa7bc-659c-4814-97f5-49dc9d8c13b7)\\n\\nThey’re minted on Catalog right after rendering & then uploaded to SoundCloud as well.\\n\\nSeason 1 (January 2022) is gonna have 26 timestamps in total.\\n\\nAll the minting costs gas & all the media requires data storage & backup. I’m gonna try and fund it from my own pocket but if you can afford to chuck a little something to cover the above costs it would be highly appreciated.
