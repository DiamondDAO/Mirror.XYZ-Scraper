On 2 December 2021, DeFi Kingdoms announced the game's first cross-chain expansion to the Avalanche blockchain, which will be known as Crystalvale.\\n\\nWhy Avalanche? With near-instant transaction speeds, low fees and over 4,500 transactions per second, Avalanche is the perfect platform for GameFi apps.\\n\\nJEWEL Contract Address (Avalanche)\\n\\n0x4f60a160d8c2dddaafe16fcc57566db84d674bd6\\n\\nYou can currently purchase JEWEL on Avalanche via Pangolin or Trader Joe, all of which have been bridged from Anyswap. Pledging JEWEL on Crystalvale Realm (on the Avalanche network) will provide you with CRYSTAL tokens.\\n\\nNew Token\\\\*\\\\*: CRYSTAL\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nAll the bullish DEFI Kingdoms with his core feature: Serendale (Harmony) will be available in Crystalvale.\\n\\nCRYSTAL is the native token of DeFi Kingdoms: Crystalvale.\\n\\nYou will be able to earn CRYSTAL by pledging your JEWEL tokens (from the Harmony bridge) in a single transaction.\\n\\nMuch like JEWEL on DeFi Kingdoms: Serendale, CRYSTAL is used to summon, buy in-game NFTs and more.\\n\\nSo why is DFK already available for expansions, why do expansions look very good for DeFi Kingdoms, and why and how for the current $Jewel.\\n\\nAt its core DeFi Kingdoms is in the eye of all storms: DEX + NFT + multi-chain expansions\\n\\nDFK is positioned to be the first fun play-and-earn game to capture the mindshare of users on multiple blockchains and is already in competition with Axie Infinity to grab market share. dfk is already the #1 dex on the Harmony blockchain.\\n\\nThe two main features of DFK are its decentralised exchange where you can trade various cryptocurrency assets, and their hero NFTs which you can use to summon other heroes, do quests, and eventually compete against other players in PVP. Their in-game economy and hero NFTs are the most user-friendly compared to other ecosystems I've seen so far. With regards to their dex, users who pledge the governance token Jewel in the vault receive 30% of all transaction fees. For those providing liquidity, they get most of the rewards of the initial token allocation by locking in, rather than trading early in the seed round to VCs and others as most projects do. Even with the in-game hero ecosystem, most of the costs associated with summoning new heroes were reintroduced into the system. 30% of all summoning costs will be offered to players as quest rewards later on, while 10% of all summoning costs will be paid to xJewel stakers in the vault. as the project will move towards multi-chaining in the future on Avalanche and elsewhere, there will be airdrops offered to those currently actively playing on Harmony. Even with the future roadmap milestones in mind, certain land purchases and other upgrades in the game will only be available to those actively doing missions and leveling up heroes. There are currently many issues with the existing DeFi program where holding tokens does not really benefit users, by inserting these tokens into a well-designed in-game economy that works, players can be incentivised and rewarded and become active participants.\\n\\nProtocol revenue distribution: dex is at the traffic portal and can empower a lot of protocol revenue, through the rebound token jewel. (Users who pledge the governance token Jewel in the vault receive 30% of all transaction fees)\\n\\nWhy is expansion very bullish for $Jewel holders and how will this create a lot of opportunity?\\n\\n1/What will happen to the game on the Harmony blockchain?Serendale contains 8 of the final 16 base classes and will therefore always be DFK's flagship product, meaning that the roadmap will continue to be developed there first. New features will also be rolled out first on Serendale, inspiring players to continue playing on Harmony. serendale will continue to evolve and grow, with Crystalvale bringing added value in the form of new genes and unique quest lines.\\n\\n2/ Take the initiative, eat or be eaten, first mover advantage and capture the market before imitators catch up.\\n\\nPurpose of the expansion.\\n\\nAttract new players to join the adventure in a field customized for their native chain\\nIncrease demand for JEWEL and Hero NFT\\nLower the barrier to entry for new participants and provide them with the opportunity to fund the game at an early stage, thus gaining power tokens for their domain. As you can see the price of gems is going up and you look at the whole era where people can come in and buy heroes/rentals etc. We want everyone to have a good experience. But in a whole new area, everyone has the opportunity to support that new area. We're not talking about expansion in the traditional sense, we're just talking about extending our experience to other chains so that we have different areas to add functionality to so that both we and the new participants benefit.\\nExtending the value of existing heroic NFTs by accessing new gene sets and classes with extended tasks. This should be very exciting for everyone involved. Not only will we be adding value to Jewel and NFT, but there will be new art, new professions, new features. We'll leverage everything we've done at Harmony and build a design-like (in terms of quality and creativity) economy where people can put their assets in a stable environment to realise value.\\nExtending empowermentjewel.\\n\\nNew chains = new TVL, new player base = more adoption = increased value in the DeFi Kingdom economy (across all chains)\\n\\nCurrent holders will be eligible for airdrops prior to release.\\n\\nPeople will have to buy Jewel to get Crystal for the initial lead in Crystal supply - this will increase the price of Jewel.\\n\\nArbitrage opportunity - high tide will lift all boats.\\n\\nNew chains = new TVL, new player base = more adoption = increased value of DeFi Kingdom economy (across all chains)\\nHarmony is currently located on coinmarketcap with a market cap of $2.3B.\\n\\nAvalanche currently sits on coinmarketcap with a market cap of $27.3B, roughly 11.8x that of Harmony.\\n\\nDeFi Llama reports a TVL of $522.21M for the Harmony ecosystem, while Avalanche's TVL of $11.6B is more than 22 times \\\\*\\\\*Harmony's TVL. Let's consider the TVL element. \\\\*\\\\*Avalanche has 22 times more money locked up in various avalanche projects than Harmony. What do you think will happen to the TVL when new and exciting projects come to Avalanche? I'll tell you what happens, because the same thing happens across all chains - people liquidate their positions and move into new projects that they think have growth potential. The same thing happens to the Harmony ecosystem when a new exciting project comes along - people start moving some of their TVLs from one project to another.\\n\\nWith a TVL 22 times larger than Harmony, and the type of momentum and credibility DFK has, it's likely that some of the 11.6B in TVL will make it into the DFK ecosystem (more on what this means for Jewel below). It could even be argued that **4.6%** of this goes into the DFK - which is already more than the entire TVL of the Harmony ecosystem (and it will all be in the DFK). This will drive gem prices to staggering heights.\\n\\nLet's consider the player basics: AMAX's market cap is about 11.8 times higher than Harmony's and 22 times higher in TVL. That's because it's just a bigger ecosystem. Bigger ecosystem -> more holders in the ecosystem -> more potential players in DFK -> more adoption -> more TVLs, usage and demand -> higher prices for everyone.\\n\\nPeople will have to buy Jewel to get Crystal to use to initially lead the Crystal supply - this will raise the price of Jewel.\\n\\nThe new field will have its own power token (similar to a Jewel). It won't be a Jewel, but in order to get the power token there will be an extended seed phase where you need to pledge a single Jewel to get it. So suppose there are the same number of new participants as there are current participants and suppose there are 20k new participants who want to place a bet on the non-harmony chain and get the new power token. They will have to go to the market, but Jewel and pledge it to get the new power token. What does this mean for the price of Jewel? The price should increase all other things being equal.\\n\\nThis means that if someone holding $22B worth of AVAX and about $12B worth of TVL on Avalanche wants to get Crystal, they have to buy Jewel. this is called demand. What happens when demand exceeds supply? The price rises. This can manifest itself in a number of ways - either the liquidity of Jewel on AVAX's DEX is now so low that any meaningful amount of demand will drive the price of AVAX dex so high that smart investors will buy Jewel Harmony at a low price, connect their Jewel to AVAX and sell it there, or else AVAX holders will come to Harmony and buy it here. Both of these will cause prices to rise.\\n\\nThis new partnership is designed to stimulate further growth for Jewel, Harmony and Avalanche. We have carefully crafted our expansion strategy so that we can provide maximum benefit to existing players while attracting more liquidity and players from the new chain. In particular, the single pledge model is key. Gemstone tokens will have a higher intrinsic value, career quests will now be available on Serendale, and there will be an option to purchase new tokens on Crystal Valley. Meanwhile, Avalanche users who may not be on Harmony will have an incentive to bridge and start making money on Serendale as they prepare for the launch of Hero and Professions on Crystalvale. and since Serendale has more available quests than Crystalvale for a long time So players will always have a reason to ride the Harmony chain to play the game. There will be many quest arcs to complete across the chain. Our goal is to recruit a large number of new players, provide new opportunities for bottom-level access to the Crystal token, and increase the utility of the token and our NFT, which will benefit the entire community!\\n\\nSummary of reasons for recommendation.\\n\\n1:In the eye of all storms: DEX + NFT + multi-chain extensions, each with unlimited ceilings\\n\\n2:The project doesn't have any vc or investor, only pre-cast funds from the team for development and marketing, multi-signature management and public.\\n\\n3:Perfect and good token economic logic has been game experience, jewel's value capture is multiple and powerful.\\n\\n4: Social media accounts grew quickly and are still growing fast. Nearly 40k Twitter followers. 4.2k Reddit. 1.4k Facebook. 400M TVL. huge growth across all platforms.\\n\\n5: Earn as you play model, tokens and nft both add significant value, new chain expansion adds new users and empowers the acoustic token jewel.
