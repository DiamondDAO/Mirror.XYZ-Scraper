"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The \\\"Bucket hat\\\" is coming on strong in the fashion industry. You know the look: \\\"Fishing hat\\\". \\n  \\n Why is it called a bucket hat? The obvious answer for most is: \\\"It LOOKS like a bucket\\\"! \\n  \\n But this is not correct. (\\\\*waynes world flashback\\\\*) \\n  \\n take the bucket hat, and fold up the brim all the way around so that the brim is now \\\"Up\\\" 360 degrees around the hat. \\n  \\n Look familliar? It is now a \\\"Dixie Cup\\\" or the cap worn by US Navy Sailors. \\n  \\n Why do sailors wear this cap? Because in a flooding small craft, IT IS A BUCKET! Sailors may use the cap to bail water from a leaking small craft or compartment. \\n  \\n While most see a cap that LOOKS like a bucket and build a product based upon that assumption, they may well make a popular product, but completely miss the true \\\"Spirit\\\" of it's design. Conversely, \\\"Bucket hat\\\" made in the true spirit of its origin, with subtle features that hint at it's potential use as an actual bucket strike the consumer with words like \\\"Quality\\\", \\\"well done\\\", \\\"wholesome\\\" \\\"complete\\\" \\n  \\n FORM melded seamlessly with FUNCTION=QUALITY=ESSENCE=SPIRIT= The Human Condition. \\n  \\n Transitive Property: Form/Function = Human Condition. \\n  \\n If your desire is to build a \\\"QUALITY\\\" NFT project, it isn't enough to \\\"Mime\\\" what you've seen on the surface. That is \\\"Form\\\" only. You must understand it's cultural \\\"Function\\\". \\n  \\n Don't look \\\"LIKE\\\" the bucket, BE the bucket.\",\"timestamp\":1640148487,\"title\":\"Don't be \\\"Like\\\" a bucket.
