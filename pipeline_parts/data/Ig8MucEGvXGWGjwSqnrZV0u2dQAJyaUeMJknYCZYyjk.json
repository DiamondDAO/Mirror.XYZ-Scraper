This song came like a dream, from the less credited corners of YouTube with its anime versions of beautiful songs like these. At first, it seemed nothing special, until you listened to the original song to discover that it's not been electronically altered at all. Released in 1982, the song is well beyond its years. The use of electronic music is very clever and artistic, adding more allure to the song than hostility. The lyrics are just so captivating, innocent and beautiful; talks like a man completely consumed by love. \\n\\n \",\"timestamp\":1638925824,\"title\":\"Magic Ways：City Pop\"},\"digest\":\"va7QEo-EGUbAUbYmukvg4qJgYAdhroxbfnwaeFva8e4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x22A93539E28418b7E481D6Ad3b288570E349270c\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"oK-sn1FtZUQwdE5VLFEa8VwY9h71KN544uDutn6ap0I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mG_AAfsVmlTD3zPVgkF5P8rtqe-HM2fVCsWEnrkjnSU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"s-NaO2AsCZ5vJ5X3Uf3OFYdrzsLN2rF2ySAidQM28eHrC6tg7TXY16vZajPcfPP0StB92uUjONOJrLrpU1qKqg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xca9f2514f58faba1f7775a95965f16cf24a05c57c21f7209437b75f371f9efb276f688eb2d328f49587dbee0683f4873f6a9c060ddf849b22efebc992f29bf451c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"oK-sn1FtZUQwdE5VLFEa8VwY9h71KN544uDutn6ap0I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mG_AAfsVmlTD3zPVgkF5P8rtqe-HM2fVCsWEnrkjnSU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"va7QEo-EGUbAUbYmukvg4qJgYAdhroxbfnwaeFva8e4\"}"
