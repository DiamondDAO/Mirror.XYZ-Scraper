"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Dusky wings and tail, the wing   coverts tipped with soiled white, forming two indistinct bars.   Whitish eye-ring. Wings longer than tail. Female -- Similar, but slightly more buff underneath. Range -- Eastern North America, from Florida to northern British   provinces. Winters in Central America. Migrations -- May. October. Common summer resident\\n\\nThe wood pewee, like the olive-sided flycatcher, has wings decidedly longer than its tail, and it is by no means a simple matter for the novice to tell these birds apart or separate them distinctly in the mind from the other members of a family whose coloring and habits are most confusingly similar. This dusky haunter of tall shady trees has not yet learned to be sociable like the phoebe; but while it may not be so much in evidence close to our homes, it is doubtless just as common. The orchard is as near the house as it often cares to come. An old orchard, where modern insecticides are unknown and neglect allows insects to riot among the decayed bark and fallen fruit, is a happy hunting ground enough; but the bird's real preferences are decidedly for high tree-tops in the woods, where no sunshine touches the feathers on his dusky coat. It is one of the few shade-loving birds. In deep solitudes, where it surely retreats by nesting time, however neighborly it may be during the migrations, its pensive, pathetic notes, long drawn out, seem like the expression of some hidden sorrow. Pe-a-wee, pe-a-wee, pewee-ah-peer is the burden of its plaintive song, a sound as depressing as it is familiar in every walk through the woods, and the bird's most prominent characteristic.\\n\\nTo see the bird dashing about in his aerial chase for insects, no one would accuse him of melancholia. He keeps an eye on the \\\"main chance,\\\" whatever his preying grief may be, and never allows it to affect his appetite. Returning to his perch after a successful sally in pursuit of the passing fly, he repeats his \\\"sweetly solemn thought\\\" over and over again all day long and every day throughout the summer.\\n\\nThe wood pewees show that devotion to each other and to their home, characteristic of their family. Both lovers work on the construction of the flat nest that is saddled on some mossy or lichen-covered limb, and so cleverly do they cover the rounded edge with bits of bark and lichen that sharp eyes only can detect where the cradle lies. Creamy-white eggs, whose larger end is wreathed with brown and lilac spots, are guarded with fierce solicitude.\\n\\nTrowbridge has celebrated this bird in a beautiful poem.\\n\\nPHOEBE (Sayornis phoebe) Flycatcher family\\n\\nCalled also: DUSKY FLYCATCHER; BRIDGE PEWEE; WATER PEWEE;    \\\\[EASTERN PHOEBE, AOU 1998\\\\]\\n\\nLength -- 7 inches. About an inch longer than the English   sparrow. Male and Female -- Dusky olive -- brown above darkest on head,   Which is slightly crested. Wings and tail dusky, the outer   edges of some tail feathers whitish. Dingy yellowish white   underneath. Bill and feet black. Range -- North America, from Newfoundland to the South Atlantic   States, and westward to the Rockies. Winters south of the   Carolinas, into Mexico, Central America, and the West Indies. Migrations -- March. October. Common summer resident.\\n\\nThe earliest representative of the flycatcher family to come out of the tropics where insect life fairly swarms and teems, what does the friendly little phoebe find to attract him to the north in March while his prospective dinners must all be still in embryo? He looks dejected, it is true, as he sits solitary and silent on some projecting bare limb in the garden, awaiting the coming of his tardy mate; nevertheless, the date of his return will not vary by more than a few days in a given locality year after year. Why birds that are mated for life, as these are said to be, and such devoted lovers, should not travel together on their journey north, is another of the many mysteries of bird-life awaiting solution.\\n\\nThe reunited, happy couple go about the garden and outbuildings like domesticated wrens, investigating the crannies on piazzas, where people may be coming and going, and boldly entering barn-lofts to find a suitable site for the nest that it must take much of both time and skill to build.\\n\\nPewit, phoebe, phoebe; pewit, phoebe, they contentedly but rather monotonously sing as they investigate all the sites in the neighborhood. Presently a location is chosen under a beam or rafter, and the work of collecting moss and mud for the foundation and hair and feathers or wool to line the exquisite little home begins. But the labor is done cheerfully, with many a sally in midair either to let off superfluous high spirits or to catch a morsel on the wing, and with many a vivacious outburst of what by courtesy only we may name a song.\\n\\nWhen not domesticated, as these birds are rapidly becoming, the phoebes dearly love a cool, wet woodland retreat. Here they hunt and bathe; here they also build in a rocky bank or ledge of rocks or underneath a bridge, but always with clever adaptation of their nest to its surroundings, out of which it seems a natural growth. It is one of the most finished, beautiful nests ever found.\\n\\nA pair of phoebes become attached to a spot where they have once nested; they never stray far from it, and return to it regularly, though they may not again occupy the old nest. This is because it soon becomes infested with lice from the hen's feathers used in lining it, for which reason too close relationship with this friendly bird-neighbor is discouraged by thrifty housekeepers. When the baby birds have come out from the four or six little white eggs, their helpless bodies are mercilessly attacked by parasites, and are often so enfeebled that half the brood die. The next season another nest will be built near the first, the following summer still another, until it would appear that a colony of birds had made their homes in the place.\\n\\nThroughout the long summer -- for as the phoebe is the first flycatcher to come, so it is the last to go -- the bird is a tireless hunter of insects, which it catches on the wing with a sharp click of its beak like the other members of its dexterous family.\\n\\nSay's Phoebe (Sayornis saya) is the Western representative of the Eastern species, which it resembles in coloring and many of its habits. It is the bird of the open plains, a tireless hunter in midair sallies from an isolated perch, and has the same vibrating motion of the tail that the Eastern phoebe indulges in when excited. This bird differs chiefly in its lighter coloring, but not in habits, from the black pewee of the Pacific slope.\\n\\nGREAT-CRESTED FLYCATCHER (Myiarchus crinitus) Flycatcher family\\n\\nCalled also: CRESTED FLYCATCHER; \\\\[GREAT CRESTED FLYCATCHER, AOU   1998\\\\]\\n\\nLength -- 8.50 to 9 inches. A little smaller than the robin. Male and female --  Feathers of the head pointed and erect. Upper   parts dark grayish-olive, inclining to rusty brown on wings and   tail. Wing coverts crossed with two irregular bars of yellowish   white. Throat gray, shading into sulphur-yellow underneath,   that also extends under the wings. Inner vane of several tail   quills rusty red. Bristles at base of bill. Range -- From Mexico, Central America, and West Indies northward   to southern Canada and westward to the plains. Most common in   Mississippi basin; common also in eastern United States, south   of New England. Migrations -- May. September. Common summer resident.\\n\\nThe most dignified and handsomely dressed member of his family, the crested flycatcher has, nevertheless, an air of pensive melancholy about him when in repose that can be accounted for only by the pain he must feel every time he hears himself screech. His harsh, shrill call, louder and more disagreeable than the kingbird's, cannot but rasp his ears as it does ours. And yet it is chiefly by this piercing note, given with a rising inflection, that we know the bird is in our neighborhood; for he is somewhat of a recluse, and we must often follow the disagreeable noise to its source in the tree-tops before we can catch a glimpse of the screecher. Perched on a high lookout, he appears morose and sluggish, in spite of his aristocratic-looking crest, trim figure, and feathers that must seem rather gay to one of his dusky tribe. A low soliloquy, apparently born of discontent, can be overheard from the foot of his tree. But another second, and he has dashed off in hot pursuit of an insect flying beyond our sight, and with extremely quick, dexterous evolutions in midair, he finishes the hunt with a sharp click of his bill as it closes over the unhappy victim, and then he returns to his perch. On the wing he is exceedingly active and joyous; in the tree he appears just the reverse. That he is a domineering fellow, quite as much of a tyrant as the notorious kingbird, that bears the greater burden of opprobrium, is shown in the fierce way he promptly dashes at a feathered stranger that may have alighted too near his perch, and pursues it beyond the bounds of justice, all the while screaming his rasping cry into the intruder's ears, that must pierce as deep as the thrusts from his relentless beak. He has even been known to drive off woodpeckers and bluebirds from the hollows in the trees that he, like them, chooses for a nest, and appropriate the results of their labor for his scarcely less belligerent mate. With a slight but important and indispensable addition, the stolen nest is ready to receive her four cream-colored eggs, that look as if a pen dipped in purple ink had been scratched over them.\\n\\nThe fact that gives the great-crested flycatcher a unique interest among all North American birds is that it invariably lines its nest with snake-skins if one can be had. Science would scarcely be worth the studying if it did not set our imaginations to work delving for plausible reasons for Nature's strange doings. Most of us will doubtless agree with Wilson (who made a special study of these interesting nests and never found a single one without cast snake-skins in it, even in districts where snakes were so rare they were supposed not to exist at all), that the lining was chosen to terrorize all intruders. The scientific mind that is unwilling to dismiss any detail of Nature's work as merely arbitrary and haphazard, is greatly exercised over the reason for the existence of crests on birds. But, surely, may not the sight of snake-skins that first greet the eyes of the fledgling flycatchers as they emerge from the shell be a good and sufficient reason why the feathers on their little heads should stand on end? \\\"In the absence of a snake-skin, I have found an onion skin and shad scales in the nest,\\\" says John Burroughs, who calls this bird \\\"the wild Irishman of the flycatchers.\\\"\\n\\nOLIVE-SIDED FLYCATCHER (Contotus borealis) Flycatcher family\\n\\nLength -- 7 to inches. About an inch longer than the English   sparrow. Male and Female -- Dusky olive or grayish brown above; head   darkest. Wings and tail blackish brown, the former sometimes,   but not always, margined and tipped with dusky white. Throat   yellowish white; other under parts slightly lighter shade than   above. Olive-gray on sides. A tuft of yellowish-white, downy   feathers on flanks. Bristles at base of bill. Range -- From Labrador to Panama. Winters in the tropics. Nests   usually north of United States, but it also breeds in the   Catskills. Migrations -- May. September Resident only in northern part of   Its range.\\n\\nOnly in the migrations may people south of Massachusetts hope to see this flycatcher, which can be distinguished from the rest of its kin by the darker under parts, and by the fluffy,  yellowish-white tufts of feathers on its flanks. Its habits have the family characteristics: it takes its food on the wing, suddenly sallying forth from its perch, darting about midair to seize its prey, then as suddenly returning to its identical point of vantage, usually in some distended, dead limb in the tree-top; it is pugnacious, bold, and tyrannical; mopish and inert when not on the hunt, but wonderfully alert and swift when in pursuit of insect or feathered foe. The short necks of the flycatchers make their heads appear large for their bodies, a peculiarity slightly emphasized in this member of the family. High up in some evergreen tree, well out on a branch, over which the shapeless mass of twigs and moss that serves as a nest is saddled, four or five buff-speckled eggs are laid, and by some special dispensation rarely fall out of their insecure cradle.\\n\\nA sharp, loud whistle, wheu--o-wheu-o-wheu-o, rings out from the throat of this olive-sided tyrant, warning all intruders off the premises; but however harshly he may treat the rest of the feathered world, he has only gentle devotion to offer his brooding mate.\\n\\nLEAST FLYCATCHER (Empidonax minimus) Flycatcher family\\n\\nCalled also: CHEBEC\\n\\nLength -- 5 to 5.5 inches. About an inch smaller than the English   sparrow. Male -- Gray or olive-gray above, paler on wings and lower part   of back, and a more distinct olive-green on head. Underneath   grayish white, sometimes faintly suffused with pale yellow.   wings have whitish bars. White eye-ring. Lower half of bill    horn color. Female is slightly more yellowish underneath. Range -- Eastern North America, from tropics northward to Quebec,  Migrations -- May. September. Common summer resident.\\n\\nThis, the smallest member of its family, takes the place of the more southerly Acadian flycatcher, throughout New England and the region of the Great Lakes. But, unlike his Southern relative, he prefers orchards and gardens close to our homes for his hunting grounds rather than the wet recesses of the forests. Che-bec, che-bec, the diminutive olive-pated gray sprite calls out from the orchard between his aerial sallies after the passing insects that have been attracted by the decaying fruit, and chebec is the name by which many New Englanders know him.\\n\\nWhile giving this characteristic call-note, with drooping jerking tail, trembling wings, and uplifted parti-colored bill, he looks unnerved and limp by the effort it has cost him. But in the next instant a gnat flies past. How quickly the bird recovers itself, and charges full-tilt at his passing dinner! The sharp click of his little bill proves that he has not missed his aim; and after careering about in the air another minute or two, looking for more game to snap up on the wing, he will return to the same perch and take up his familiar refrain. Without hearing this call-note one might often mistake the bird for either the wood pewee or the phoebe, for all the three are similarly clothed and have many traits in common. The slightly large size of the phoebe and pewee is not always apparent when they are seen perching on the trees. Unlike the \\\"tuft of hay\\\" to which the Acadian flycatcher's nest has been likened, the least flycatcher's home is a neat, substantial cup-shaped cradle softly lined with down or horsehair, and placed generally in an upright crotch of a tree, well above the ground.\\n\\nTHE CHICKADEE (Parus atricapillus) Titmouse family\\n\\nCalled also: BLACK-CAPPED TITMOUSE; BLACK-CAP TIT; \\\\[BLACK-CAPPED   CHICKADEE, AOU 1998\\\\]\\n\\nLength -- 5 to 5.5 inches. About an inch smaller than the English   sparrow. Male and Female -- Not crested. Crown and nape and throat black.   Above gray, slightly tinged with brown. A white space,   beginning at base of bill, extends backwards, widening over   cheeks and upper part of breast, forming a sort of collar that   almost surrounds neck. Underneath dirty white. with pale rusty   brown wash on sides. Wings and tail gray. with white edgings.   Plumage downy. Range -- Eastern North America. North of the Carolinas to   Labrador. Does not migrate in the North. Migrations -- Late September. May. Winter resident; permanent   resident in northern parts of the United States.\\n\\nNo \\\"fair weather friend\\\" is the jolly little chickadee. In the depth of the autumn equinoctial storm it returns to the tops of the trees close by the house, where, through the sunshine, snow, and tempest of the entire winter, you may hear its cheery, irrepressible chickadee-dee-dee-dee or day-day-day as it swings Around the dangling cones of the evergreens. It fairly overflows with good spirits, and is never more contagiously gay than in a snowstorm. So active, so friendly and cheering, what would the long northern winters be like without this lovable little neighbor?\\n\\nIt serves a more utilitarian purpose, however, than bracing faint-hearted spirits. \\\"There is no bird that compares with it in destroying the female canker-worm moths and their eggs,\\\" writes a well-known entomologist. He calculates that as a chickadee destroys about 5,500 eggs in one day, it will eat 138,750 eggs in the twenty-five days it takes the canker-worm moth to crawl up the trees. The moral that it pays to attract chickadees about your home by feeding them in winter is obvious. Mrs. Mabel Osgood Wright, in her delightful and helpful book \\\"Birdcraft,\\\" tells us how she makes a sort of a bird-hash of finely minced raw meat, waste canary-seed, buckwheat, and cracked oats, which she scatters in a sheltered spot for all the winter birds. The way this is consumed leaves no doubt of its popularity. A raw bone, hung from an evergreen limb, is equally appreciated.\\n\\nFriendly as the chickadee is and Dr. Abbott declares it the tamest bird we have it prefers well-timbered districts, especially where there are red-bud trees, when it is time to nest. It is very often clever enough to leave the labor of hollowing out a nest in the tree-trunk to the woodpecker or nuthatch, whose old homes it readily appropriates; or, when these birds object, a knot-hole or a hollow fence-rail answers every purpose. Here, in the summer woods, when family cares beset it, a plaintive, minor whistle replaces the chickadee-dee-dee that Thoreau likens to \\\"silver tinkling\\\" as he heard it on a frosty morning.\\n\\n```\\n\\\"Piped a tiny voice near by,      Gay and polite, a cheerful cry      Chick-chickadeedee! saucy note      Out of sound heart and merry throat,      As if it said, 'Good-day, good Sir!      Fine afternoon, old passenger!      Happy to meet you in these places      Where January brings few faces.'\\\"                                     -- Emerson.\\n```\\n\\nTUFTED TITMOUSE (Parus bicolor) Titmouse family\\n\\nCalled also: CRESTED TITMOUSE; CRESTED TOMTIT\\n\\nLength -- 6 to 6. inches. About the size of the English sparrow. Male and Female -- Crest high and pointed. Leaden or ash-gray   above; darkest on wings and tail. Frontlet, bill, and shoulders   black; space between eyes gray. Sides of head dull white. Under   parts light gray; sides yellowish, tinged with red. Range -- United States east of plains, and only rarely seen so   far north as New England. Migrations -- October. April. Winter resident, but also found   throughout the year in many States.\\n\\n\\\"A noisy titmouse is Jack Frost's trumpeter\\\" may be one of those few weather-wise proverbs with a grain of truth in them. As the chickadee comes from the woods with the frost, so it may be noticed his cousin, the crested titmouse, is in more noisy evidence throughout the winter.\\n\\nOne might sometimes think his whistle, like a tugboat's, worked by steam. But how effectually nesting cares alone can silence it in April!\\n\\nTitmice always see to it you are not lonely as you walk through the woods. This lordly tomtit, with his jaunty crest, keeps up a persistent whistle at you as he flits from tree to tree, leading you deeper into the forest, calling out \\\"Here-here-here!', and looking like a pert and jaunty little blue jay, minus his gay clothes. Mr. Nehrling translates one of the calls  \\\"Heedle-deedle-deedle-dee!\\\" and another \\\"Peto-peto-peto-daytee-daytee!\\\" But it is at the former, sharply whistled as the crested titmouse gives it, that every dog pricks up his ears.\\n\\nComparatively little has been written about this bird, because it is not often found in New England, where most of the bird litterateurs have lived. South of New York State, however, it is a common resident, and much respected for the good work it does in destroying injurious insects, though it is more fond of varying its diet with nuts, berries, and seeds than that all-round benefactor, the chickadee.\\n\\nCANADA JAY (Perisoreus canadensis) Crow and Jay family\\n\\nCalled also: WHISKY JACK OR JOHN; MOOSE-BIRD; MEAT BIRD; VENISON    HERON; GREASE-BIRD; CANADIAN CARRION-BIRD; CAMP ROBBER; \\\\[GRAY   JAY, AOU 1998\\\\]\\n\\nLength -- 11 to 12 inches. About two inches larger than the   robin. Male and Female -- Upper p arts gray; darkest on wings and tail;   back of the head and nape of the neck sooty, almost black.   Forehead, throat, and neck white, and a few white tips on wings   and tail. Underneath lighter gray. Tail long. Plumage fluffy. Range -- Northern parts of the United States and British   Provinces of North America. Migrations -- Resident where found.\\n\\nThe Canada jay looks like an exaggerated chickadee, and both birds are equally fond of bitter cold weather, but here the similarity stops short. Where the chickadee is friendly the jay is impudent and bold; hardly less of a villain than his blue relative when it comes to marauding other birds' nests and destroying their young. With all his vices, however, intemperance cannot be attributed to him, in spite of the name given him by the Adirondack lumbermen and guides. \\\"Whisky John\\\" is a purely innocent corruption of  \\\"Wis-ka-tjon,\\\" as the Indians call this bird that haunts their camps and familiarly enters their wigwams. The numerous popular names by which the Canada jays are known are admirably accounted for by Mr. Hardy in a bulletin issued by the Smithsonian Institution.\\n\\n\\\"They will enter the tents, and often alight on the bow of a canoe, where the paddle at every stroke comes within eighteen inches of them. I know nothing which can be eaten that they will not take, and I had one steal all my candles, pulling them out endwise, one by one, from a piece of birch bark in which they were rolled, and another peck a large hole in a keg of castile soap. A duck which I had picked and laid down for a few minutes, had the entire breast eaten out by one or more of these birds. I have seen one alight in the middle of my canoe and peck away at the carcass of a beaver I had skinned. They often spoil deer saddles by pecking into them near the kidneys. They do great damage to the trappers by stealing the bait from traps set for martens and minks and by eating trapped game. They will sit quietly and see you build a log trap and bait it, and then, almost before your back is turned, you hear their hateful ca-ca-ca! as they glide down and peer into it. They will work steadily, carrying off meat and hiding it. I have thrown out pieces, and watched one to see how much he would carry off. He flew across a wide stream, and in a short time looked as bloody as a butcher from carrying large pieces; but his patience held out longer than mine. I think one would work as long as Mark Twain's California jay did trying to fill a miner's cabin with acorns through a knot-hole in the root. They are fond of the berries of the mountain ash, and, in fact, few things come amiss; I believe they do not possess a single good quality except industry.\\\"\\n\\nOne virtue not mentioned by Mr. Hardy is their prudent saving from the summer surplus to keep the winter storeroom well supplied like a squirrel's. Such thrift is the more necessary when a clamorous, hungry family of young jays must be reared while the thermometer is often as low as thirty degrees below zero at the end of March. How eggs are ever hatched at all in a temperature calculated to freeze any sitting bird stiff, is one of the mysteries of the woods. And yet four or five fluffy little jays, that look as if they were dressed in gray fur, emerge from the eggs before the spring sunshine has unbound the icy rivers or melted the snowdrifts piled high around the evergreens.\\n\\nCATBIRD (Galcoscoptes carolinensis ) Mocking-bird family\\n\\nCalled also: BLACK-CAPPED THRUSH; \\\\[GRAY CATBIRD, AOU 1998\\\\]\\n\\nLength -- 9 inches. An inch shorter than the robin. Male and Female -- Dark slate above; below somewhat paler; top of   head black. Distinct chestnut patch under the tail, which is   black; feet and bill black also. Wings short, more than two   inches shorter than the tail. Range -- British provinces to Mexico; west to Rocky Mountains,   to Pacific coast. Winters in Southern States, Central   America, and Cuba. Migrations -- May. November. Common summer resident,\\n\\nOur familiar catbird, of all the feathered tribe, presents the most contrary characteristics, and is therefore held in varied estimation -- loved, admired, ridiculed, abused. He is the veriest \\\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\\" of birds. Exquisitely proportioned, with finely poised black head and satin-gray coat, which he bathes most carefully and prunes and prinks by the hour, he appears from his toilet a Beau Brummell, an aristocratic-looking, even dandified neighbor. Suddenly, as if shot, he drops head and tail and assumes the most hang-dog air, without the least sign of self-respect; then crouches and lengthens into a roll, head forward and tail straightened, till he looks like a little, short gray snake, lank and limp. Anon, with a jerk and a sprint, every muscle tense, tail erect, eyes snapping, he darts into the air intent upon some well-planned mischief. It is impossible to describe his various attitudes or moods. In song and call he presents the same opposite characteristics. How such a bird, exquisite in style, can demean himself to utter such harsh, altogether hateful catcalls and squawks as have given the bird his common name, is a wonder when in the next moment his throat swells and beginning phut-phut-coquillicot, he gives forth a long glorious song, only second to that of the wood thrush in melody. He is a jester, a caricaturist, a mocking-bird.\\n\\nThe catbird's nest is like a veritable scrap-basket, loosely woven of coarse twigs, bits of newspaper, scraps, and rags, till this rough exterior is softly lined and made fit to receive the four to six pretty dark green-blue eggs to be laid therein.\\n\\nAs a fruit thief harsh epithets are showered upon the friendly, confiding little creature at our doors; but surely his depredations may be pardoned, for he is industrious at all times and unusually adroit in catching insects, especially in the moth stage.\\n\\nTHE MOCKING-BIRD (Mimus polyglottus) Mocking-bird family\\n\\n\\\\[Called also: NORTHERN MOCKINGBIRD, AOU 1998\\\\]\\n\\nLength -- 9 to 10 inches. About the size of the robin. Male and Female -- Gray above; wings and wedge-shaped; tail   brownish; upper wing feathers tipped with white; outer tail   quills white, conspicuous in flight; chin white; underneath   light gray, shading to whitish. Range -- Peculiar to torrid and temperate zones of two Americas. Migrations -- No fixed migrations: usually resident where seen.\\n\\nNorth of Delaware this commonest of Southern birds is all too rarely seen outside of cages, yet even in midwinter it is not unknown in Central Park, New York. This is the angel that it is said the catbird was before he fell from grace. Slim, neat, graceful, imitative, amusing, with a rich, tender song that only the thrush can hope to rival, and with an instinctive preference for the society of man, it is little wonder he is a favorite, caged or free. He is a most devoted parent, too, when the four or six speckled green eggs have produced as many mouths to be supplied with insects and berries.\\n\\nIn the Connecticut Valley, where many mocking-birds' nests have been found, year after year, they are all seen near the ground, and without exception are loosely, poorly constructed affairs of leaves, feathers, grass, and even rags.\\n\\nWith all his virtues, it must be added, however, that this charming bird is a sad tease. 'There is no sound, whether made by bird or beast about him, that he cannot imitate so clearly as to deceive every one but himself. Very rarely can you find a mocking-bird without intelligence and mischief enough to appreciate his ventriloquism. In Sidney Lanier's college note-book was found written this reflection: \\\"A poet is the mocking-bird of the spiritual universe. In him are collected all the individual songs of all individual natures.\\\" Later in life, with the same thought in mind, he referred to the bird as \\\"yon slim Shakespeare on the tree.\\\" His exquisite stanzas, \\\"To Our Mocking-bird,\\\" exalt the singer with the immortals:\\n\\n\\\"Trillets of humor, -- shrewdest whistle -- wit --      Contralto cadences of grave desire,     Such as from off the passionate Indian pyre     Drift down through sandal-odored flames that split     About the slim young widow, who doth sit     And sing above, -- midnights of tone entire, --      Tissues of moonlight, shot with songs of fire; --     Bright drops of tune, from oceans infinite     Of melody, sipped off the thin-edged wave     And trickling down the beak, -- discourses brave     Of serious matter that no man may guess, --      Good-fellow greetings, cries of light distress --      All these but now within the house we heard:     O Death, wast thou too deaf to hear the bird?     . . . . .    \\\"Nay, Bird; my grief gainsays the Lord's best right.     The Lord was fain, at some late festal time,     That Keats should set all heaven's woods in rhyme,     And Thou in bird-notes. Lo, this tearful night     Methinks I see thee, fresh from Death's despite,     Perched in a palm-grove, wild with pantomime     O'er blissful companies couched in shady thyme.     Methinks I hear thy silver whistlings bright     Meet with the mighty discourse of the wise, --      'Till broad Beethoven, deaf no more, and Keats,     'Midst of much talk, uplift their smiling eyes     And mark the music of thy wood-conceits,     And half-way pause on some large courteous word,     And call thee 'Brother,' O thou heavenly Bird!\\\"\\n\\nJUNCO (Junco hyemalis) Finch family\\n\\nCalled also: SNOWBIRD; SLATE-COLORED SNOWBIRD; \\\\[DARK-EYED JUNCO,   AOU 1998\\\\]\\n\\nLength -- 5.5 to 6.5 inches. About the size of the English   sparrow. Male -- Upper parts slate-colored; darkest on head and neck,   which are sometimes almost black and marked like a cowl. Gray   on breast, like a vest. Underneath white. Several outer tall   feathers white, conspicuous in flight. Female -- Lighter gray, inclining to brown. Range -- North America. Not common in warm latitudes. Breeds in   the Catskills and northern New England. Migrations -- September. April. Winter resident.\\n\\n\\\"Leaden skies above; snow below,\\\" is Mr. Parkhurst's suggestive description of this rather timid little neighbor, that is only starved into familiarity. When the snow has buried seed and berries, a flock of juncos, mingling sociably with the sparrows and chickadees about the kitchen door, will pick up scraps of food with an intimacy quite touching in a bird naturally rather shy. Here we can readily distinguish these \\\"little gray-robed monks and nuns,\\\" as Miss Florence Merriam calls them.\\n\\nThey are trim, sprightly, sleek, and even natty; their dispositions are genial and vivacious, not quarrelsome, like their sparrow cousins, and what is perhaps best about them, they are birds we may surely depend upon seeing in the winter months. A few come forth in September, migrating at night from the deep woods of the north, where they have nested and moulted during the summer; but not until frost has sharpened the air are large numbers of them seen. Rejoicing in winter, they nevertheless do not revel in the deep and fierce arctic blasts, as the snowflakes do, but take good care to avoid the open pastures before the hard storms overtake them.\\n\\nEarly in the spring their song is sometimes heard before they leave us to woo and to nest in the north. Mr. Bicknell describes it as \\\"a crisp call-note, a simple trill, and a faint, whispered warble, usually much broken, but not without sweetness.\\\"\\n\\nWHITE-BREASTED NUTHATCH (Sitta carolinensis) Nuthatch family\\n\\nCalled also: TREE-MOUSE; DEVIL DOWNHEAD\\n\\nLength -- 5.5 to 6 inches. A trifle smaller than the English   sparrow. Male and Female -- Upper parts slate-color. Top of head and nape   black. Wings dark slate, edged with black, that fades to brown.   Tail feathers brownish black, with white bars. Sides of head   and underneath white, shading to pale reddish under the tail.   (Female's head leaden.) Body flat and compact. Bill longer than   head. Range -- British provinces to Mexico. Eastern United States. Migrations -- October. April. Common resident. Most prominent in   winter.\\n\\n\\\"Shrewd little haunter of woods all gray,    Whom I meet on my walk of a winter day --     You're busy inspecting each cranny and hole    In the ragged bark of yon hickory bole;    You intent on your task, and I on the law    Of your wonderful head and gymnastic claw!\\n\\nThe woodpecker well may despair of this feat --     Only the fly with you can compete!    So much is clear; but I fain would know    How you can so reckless and fearless go,    Head upward, head downward, all one to you,    Zenith and nadir the same in your view?\\\"                                         -- Edith M. Thomas.\\n\\nCould a dozen lines well contain a fuller description or more apt characterization of a bird than these \\\"To a Nuthatch\\\"?\\n\\nWith more artless inquisitiveness than fear, this lively little acrobat stops his hammering or hatcheting at your approach, and stretching himself out from the tree until it would seem he must fall off, he peers down at you, head downward, straight into your upturned opera-glasses. If there is too much snow on the upper side of a branch, watch how he runs along underneath it like a fly, busily tapping the bark, or adroitly breaking the decayed bits with his bill, as he searches for the spider's eggs, larvae, etc., hidden there; yet somehow, between mouthfuls, managing to call out his cheery quank! quank! hank! hank!\\n\\nTitmice and nuthatches, which have many similar characteristics, are often seen in the most friendly hunting parties on the same tree. A pine woods is their dearest delight. There, as the mercury goes down, their spirits only seem to go up higher. In the spring they have been thought by many to migrate in flocks, whereas they are only retreating with their relations away from the haunts of men to the deep, cool woods, where they nest. With infinite patience the nuthatch excavates a hole in a tree, lining it with feathers and moss, and often depositing as many as ten white eggs speckled with red and lilac) for a single brood.\\n\\nRED-BREASTED NUTHATCH (Sitta canadensis) Nuthatch family\\n\\nCalled also: CANADA NUTHATCH\\n\\nLength -- 4 to 4.75 inches. One-third smaller than the English   sparrow. Male -- Lead-colored above; brownish on wings and tail. Head,   neck, and stripe passing through eye to shoulder, black.   Frontlet, chin, and shoulders white; also a white stripe over   eye, meeting on brow. Under parts light, rusty red. Tail   feathers barred with white near end, and tipped with pale   brown. Female -- Has crown of brownish black, and is lighter beneath   than male. Range -- Northern parts of North America. Not often seen south of   the most northerly States. Migrations -- November. April. Winter resident.\\n\\nThe brighter coloring of this tiny, hardy bird distinguishes from the other and larger nuthatch, with whom it is usually seen, for the winter birds have a delightfully social manner, so that a colony of these Free masons is apt to contain not only both kinds of nuthatches and chickadees, but kinglets and brown creepers as well. It shares the family habit of walking about the trees, head downward, and running along the under side of limbs like a fly. By Thanksgiving Day the quank! quank! of the white-breasted species is answered by the tai-tai-tait! of the red-breasted cousin in the orchard, where the family party is celebrating with an elaborate menu of slugs, insects' eggs, and oily seeds from the evergreen trees.\\n\\nFor many years this nuthatch, a more northern species than the white-breasted bird, was thought to be only a spring and autumn visitor, but latterly it is credited with habits like its congener's in nearly every particular.\\n\\nLOGGERHEAD SHRIKE (Lanius ludovicianus) Shrike family\\n\\nLength -- 8.5 to 9 inches. A little smaller than the robin. Male and Female -- Upper parts gray; narrow black line across   forehead, connecting small black patches on sides of head at   base of bill. Wings and tail black, plentifully marked with   white, the outer tail feathers often being entirely white and   conspicuous in flight. Underneath white or very light gray.   Bill hooked and hawk-like. Range -- Eastern United States to the plains. Migrations -- May. October. Summer resident.\\n\\nIt is not easy, even at a slight distance, to distinguish the loggerhead from the Northern shrike. Both have the pernicious habit of killing insects and smaller birds and impaling them on thorns; both have the peculiarity of flying, with strong, vigorous flight and much wing-flapping, close along the ground, then suddenly rising to a tree, on the lookout for prey. Their harsh, unmusical call-notes are similar too, and their hawk-like method of dropping suddenly upon a victim on the ground below is identical. Indeed, the same description very nearly answers for both birds. But there is one very important difference. While the Northern shrike is a winter visitor, the loggerhead, being his Southern counterpart, does not arrive until after the frost is out of the ground, and he can be sure of a truly warm welcome. A lesser distiction between the only two representatives of the shrike family that frequent our neighborhood -- and they are two too many -- is in the smaller size of the loggerhead and its lighter-gray plumage. But as both these birds select some high commanding position, like a distended branch near the tree-top, a cupola, house-peak, lightning-rod, telegraph wire, or  weather-vane, the better to detect a passing dinner, it would be quite impossible at such a distance to know which shrike was sitting up there silently plotting villainies, without remembering the season when each may be expected.\\n\\nNORTHERN SHRIKE (Lanius borealis) Shrike family\\n\\nCalled also: BUTCHER-BIRD; NINE-KILLER\\n\\nLength -- 9.5 to 10.5 inches. About the size of the robin. Male -- Upper parts slate-gray; wing quills and tail black,   edged and tipped with white, conspicuous in flight; a white   spot on centre of outer wing feathers. A black band runs   from bill, through eye to side of throat. Light gray below,   tinged with brownish, and faintly marked with waving lines   of darker gray. Bill hooked and hawk-like. Female -- With eye-band more obscure than male's, and with   More distinct brownish cast on her plumage. Range -- Northern North America. South in winter to middle   Portion of United States. Migrations -- November, April. A roving winter resident.\\n\\n\\\"Matching the bravest of the brave among birds of prey in deeds of daring, and no less relentless than reckless, the shrike compels that sort of deference, not unmixed with indignation, we are accustomed to accord to creatures of seeming insignificance whose exploits demand much strength, great spirit, and insatiate love for carnage. We cannot be indifferent to the marauder who takes his own wherever he finds it -- a feudal baron who holds his own with undisputed sway -- and an ogre whose victims are so many more than he can eat, that he actually keeps a private graveyard for the balance.\\\" Who is honestly able to give the shrikes a better character than Dr. Coues, just quoted? A few offer them questionable defence by recording the large numbers of English sparrows they kill in a season, as if wanton carnage were ever justifiable.\\n\\nNot even a hawk itself can produce the consternation among a flock of sparrows that the harsh, rasping voice of the butcherbird creates, for escape they well know to be difficult before the small ogre swoops down upon his victim, and carries it off to impale it on a thorn or frozen twig, there to devour it later piecemeal. Every shrike thus either impales or else hangs up, as a butcher does his meat, more little birds of many kinds, field-mice, grasshoppers, and other large insects than it can hope to devour in a week of bloody orgies. Field-mice are perhaps its favorite diet, but even snakes are not disdained.\\n\\nMore contemptible than the actual slaughter of its victims, if possible, is the method by which the shrike often lures and sneaks upon his prey. Hiding in a clump of bushes in the meadow or garden, he imitates with fiendish cleverness the call-notes of little birds that come in cheerful response, hopping and flitting within easy range of him. His bloody work is finished in a trice. Usually, however, it must be owned, the shrike's hunting habits are the reverse of sneaking. Perched on a point of vantage on some tree-top or weather-vane, his hawk-like eye can detect a grasshopper going through the grass fifty yards away.\\n\\nWhat is our surprise when, some fine warm day in March, just before our butcher, ogre, sneak, and fiend leaves us for colder regions, to hear him break out into song! Love has warmed even his cold heart, and with sweet, warbled notes on the tip of a beak that but yesterday was reeking with his victim's blood, he starts for Canada, leaving behind him the only good impression he has made during a long winter's visit.\\n\\nBOHEMIAN WAXWING (Ampelis garrulus) Waxwing family\\n\\nCalled also: BLACK-THROATED WAX WING; LAPLAND WAX WING; SILKTAIL\\n\\nLength -- 8 to 9.5 inches. A little smaller than the robin. Male and Female -- General color drab, with faint brownish wash   above, shading into lighter gray below. Crest conspicuous.   being nearly an inch and a half in length; rufous at the base,   shading into light gray above, velvety-black forehead, chin,   and line through the eye. Wings grayish brown, with very dark    quills, which have two white bars; the bar at the edge of the   upper wing coverts being tipped with red sealing-wax-like   points, that give the bird its name. A few wing feathers tipped   with yellow on outer edge. Tail quills dark brown, with yellow   band across the end, and faint red streaks on upper and inner    sides. Range -- Northern United States and British America. Most common   in Canada and northern Mississippi region. Migrations -- Very irregular winter visitor.\\n\\nWhen Charles Bonaparte, Prince of Canino, who was the first to count this common waxwing of Europe and Asia among the birds of North America, published an account of it in his \\\"Synopsis,\\\" it was considered a very rare bird indeed. It may be these waxwings have greatly increased, but however uncommon they may still be considered, certainly no one who had ever seen a flock containing more than a thousand of them, resting on the trees of a lawn within sight of New York City, as the writer has done, could be expected to consider the birds \\\"very rare.\\\"\\n\\nThe Bohemian waxwing, like the only other member of the family that ever visits us, the cedar-bird, is a roving gipsy. In Germany they say seven years must elapse between its visitations, which the superstitious old cronies are wont to associate with woful stories of pestilence -- just such tales as are resurrected from the depths of morbid memories here when a comet reappears or the seven-year locust ascends from the ground.\\n\\nThe goings and comings of these birds are certainly most erratic and infrequent; nevertheless, when hunger drives them from the far north to feast upon the juniper and other winter berries of our Northern States, they come in enormous flocks, making up in quantity what they lack in regularity of visits and evenness of distribution.\\n\\nSurely no bird has less right to be associated with evil than this mild waxwing. It seems the very incarnation of peace and harmony. Part of a flock that has lodged in a tree will sit almost motionless for hours and whisper in softly hissed twitterings, very much as a company of Quaker ladies, similarly dressed, might sit at yearly meeting. Exquisitely clothed in silky-gray feathers that no berry juice is ever permitted to stain, they are dainty, gentle, aristocratic-looking birds, a trifle heavy and indolent, perhaps, when walking on the ground or perching; but as they fly in compact squads just above the tree-tops their flight is exceedingly swift and graceful.\\n\\nBAY-BREASTED WARBLER (Dendroica castanea) Wood Warbler family\\n\\nLength. -- 5.25 to 5.75 inches. A little smaller than the English   sparrow. Male -- Crown, chin, throat, upper breast, and sides dull   chestnut. Forehead, sides of head, and cheeks black. Above   olive-gray, streaked with black. Underneath buffy. Two white   wing-bars. Outer tail quills with white patches on tips. Cream   white patch on either side of neck. Female -- Has more greenish-olive above. Range -- Eastern North America, from Hudson's Bay to Central   America. Nests north of the United States. Winters in tropical   limit of range. Migrations -- May. September. Rare migrant\\n\\nThe chestnut breast of this capricious little visitor makes him look like a diminutive robin. In spring, when these warblers are said to take a more easterly route than the one they choose in autumn to return by to Central America, they may be so suddenly abundant that the fresh green trees and shrubbery of the garden will contain a dozen of the busy little hunters. Another season they may pass northward either by another route or leave your garden unvisited; and perhaps the people in the very next town may be counting your rare bird common, while it is simply perverse.\\n\\nWhether common or rare, before your acquaintance has had time to ripen into friendship, away go the freaky little creatures to nest in the tree-tops of the Canadian coniferous forests.\\n\\nCHESTNUT-SIDED WARBLER (Dendroica pennsylvanica) Wood Warbler family\\n\\nCalled also: BLOODY-SIDED WARBLER\\n\\nLength -- About 5 inches. More than an inch shorter than the   English sparrow. Male -- Top of head and streaks in wings yellow. A black line   running through the eye and round back of crown, and a black   spot in front of eye, extending to cheeks. Ear coverts, chin,   and underneath white. Back greenish gray and slate, streaked   with black. Sides of bird chestnut. Wings, which are streaked   with black and yellow, have yellowish-white bars. Very dark   tail with white patches on inner vanes of the outer quills. Female -- Similar, but duller. Chestnut sides are often scarcely   apparent. Range -- Eastern North America, from Manitoba and Labrador to the   tropics, where it winters. Migrations -- May. September. Summer resident, most common in   migrations.\\n\\nIn the Alleghanies, and from New Jersey and Illinois northward, this restless little warbler nests in the bushy borders of woodlands and the undergrowth of the woods, for which he forsakes our gardens and orchards after a very short visit in May. While hopping over the ground catching ants, of which he seems to be inordinately fond, or flitting actively about the shrubbery after grubs and insects, we may note his coat of many colors -- patchwork in which nearly all the warbler colors are curiously combined. With drooped wings that often conceal the bird's chestnut sides, which are his chief distinguishing mark, and with tail erected like a redstart's, he hunts incessantly. Here in the garden he is as refreshingly indifferent to your interest in him as later in his breeding haunts he is shy and distrustful. His song is bright and animated, like that of the yellow warbler.\\n\\nGOLDEN-WINGED WARBLER (Helminthophila chrysoptera) Wood Warbler family\\n\\nLength -- About 5 inches. More than an inch shorter than the   English sparrow. Male -- Yellow crown and yellow patches on the wings. Upper parts   bluish gray, sometimes tinged with greenish. Stripe through the   eye and throat black. Sides of head chin, and line over the eye   white. Underneath white, grayish on sides. A few white markings   on outer tail feathers. Female -- Crown duller; gray where male is black, with olive   Upper parts and grayer underneath. Range -- From Canadian border to Central America, where it   winters. Migrations -- May. September. Summer resident.\\n\\nAfter one has seen a golden-winged warbler fluttering hither and thither about the shrubbery of a park within sight and sound of a great city's distractions and with blissful unconcern of them all, partaking of a hearty lunch of insects that infest the leaves before one's eyes, one counts the bird less rare and shy than one has been taught to consider it. Whoever looks for a warbler with gaudy yellow wings will not find the golden-winged variety. His wings have golden patches only, and while these are distinguishing marks, they are scarcely prominent enough features to have given the bird the rather misleading name he bears. But, then, most warblers' names are misleading. They serve their best purpose in cultivating patience and other gentle virtues in the novice.\\n\\nSuch habits and choice of haunts as characterize the blue-winged warbler are also the golden-winged's. But their voices are quite different, the former's being sharp and metallic, while the latter's zee, zee, zee comes more lazily and without accent.\\n\\nMYRTLE WARBLER (Dendroica coronata) Wood Warbler family\\n\\nCalled also: YELLOW-RUMPED WARBLER \\\\[AOU 1998\\\\]; MYRTLE BIRD;   YELLOW-CROWNED WARBLER\\n\\nLength -- 5 to 5.5 inches. About an inch smaller than the English   sparrow. Male -- In summer plumage: A yellow patch on top of head, lower   back, and either side of the breast. Upper parts bluish slate,   streaked with black. Upper breast black; throat white; all   other under parts whitish, streaked with black. Two white wing   bars, and tail quills have white spots near the tip. In winter:   Upper parts olive-brown, streaked with black; the yellow spot   on lower back the only yellow mark remaining. Wing-bars   grayish. Female -- Resembles male in winter plumage. Range -- Eastern North America. Occasional on Pacific slope.   Summers from Minnesota and northern New England northward to   Fur Countries. Winters from Middle States south ward into   Central America; a few often remaining at the northern United   States all the winter. Migrations -- April. October. November. Also, but more rarely, a   winter resident.\\n\\nThe first of the warblers to arrive in the spring and the last to leave us in the autumn, some even remaining throughout the northern winter, the myrtle warbler, next to the summer yellowbird, is the most familiar of its multitudinous kin. Though we become acquainted with it chiefly in the migrations, it impresses us by its numbers rather than by any gorgeousness of attire. The four yellow spots on crown, lower back, and sides are its distinguishing marks; and in the autumn these marks have dwindled to only one, that on the lower back or rump. The great difficulty experienced in identifying any warbler is in its restless habit of flitting about.\\n\\nFor a few days in early May we are forcibly reminded of the Florida peninsula, which fairly teems with these birds; they become almost superabundant, a distraction during the precious days when the rarer species are quietly slipping by, not to return again for a year, perhaps longer, for some warblers are notoriously irregular in their routes north and south, and never return by the way they travelled in the spring.\\n\\nBut if we look sharply into every group of myrtle warblers, we are quite likely to discover some of their dainty, fragile cousins that gladly seek the escort of birds so fearless as they. By the last of May all the warblers are gone from the neighborhood except the constant little summer yellowbird and redstart.\\n\\nIn autumn, when the myrtle warblers return after a busy enough summer passed in Canadian nurseries, they chiefly haunt those regions where juniper and bay-berries abound. These latter (Myrica cerifera), or the myrtle wax-berries, as they are sometimes called, and which are the bird's favorite food, have given it their name. Wherever the supply of these berries is sufficient to last through the winter, there it may be found foraging in the scrubby bushes. Sometimes driven by cold and hunger from the fields, this hardiest member of a family that properly belongs to the tropics, seeks shelter and food close to the outbuildings on the farm.\",\"timestamp\":1641275035,\"title\":\"Dusky brownish olive above, darkest on head; paler on   throat, lighter still underneath, and with a yellowish tinge on   the dusky gray under parts.\"},\"digest\":\"A8xNbFOMI6vpbU2s-gC9rLL33qatOrkxe0wZVu6gJOo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x1928Fa8c1480697A043aA639A3c2C52BE5B7890a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Xgq6-gx9NIcox83QYfiqU4Xi3dIkkQ7FGBBUrAvgKGE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xshVCfMXT13Zr2pwXrrQ8no3iM8MA9Cx7Q0wOF4oiH4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"sOWjaOY-pfuUa4ZuGuOiIPA168xtwD3p7z3mFJlVq0bv1GdW8KrZ6l84ePUeZXPLncOlyS0ZiqIhhCvz_YqtLg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc2915f508c470a2722a4ce73fed65c9347ae24c5a106468b1af15839395171e91d9ca4c2d65449597024ea314327baa430722944031d3ce541f337f3160405471c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Xgq6-gx9NIcox83QYfiqU4Xi3dIkkQ7FGBBUrAvgKGE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xshVCfMXT13Zr2pwXrrQ8no3iM8MA9Cx7Q0wOF4oiH4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"A8xNbFOMI6vpbU2s-gC9rLL33qatOrkxe0wZVu6gJOo\"}"
