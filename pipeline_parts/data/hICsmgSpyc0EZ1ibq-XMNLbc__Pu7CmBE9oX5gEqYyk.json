"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Hermod pursued his journey until he came to the barred gates of Hel.  Here he alighted, girthed his saddle tighter, and remounting clapped both spurs to his horse, who cleared the gate by a tremendous leap without touching it.  Hermod then rode on to the palace where he found his brother Baldur occupying the most distinguished seat in the hall, and passed the night in his company.  The next morning he besought Hela to let Baldur ride home with him, assuring her that nothing but lamentations were to be heard among the gods.  Hela answered that it should now be tried whether Baldur was so beloved as he was said to be.  \\\"If, therefore,\\\" she added, \\\"all things in the world, both living and lifeless, weep for him, then shall he return to life; but if any one thing speak against him or refuse to weep, he shall be kept in Hel.\\\"\\n\\nHermod then rode back to Asgard and gave an account of all he had heard and witnessed.\\n\\nThe gods upon this despatched messengers throughout the world to beg every thing to weep in order that Baldur might be delivered from Hel.  All things very willingly complied with this request, both men and every other living being, as well as earths, and stones, and trees, and metals, just as we have all seen these things weep when they are brought from a cold place into a hot one.  As the messengers were returning, they found an old hag named Thaukt sitting in a cavern, and begged her to weep Baldur out of Hel.  But she answered,\\n\\n\\\"Thaukt will wail With dry tears Baldur's bale-fire. Let Hela keep her own.\\\"\\n\\nIt was strongly suspected that this hag was no other than Loki himself, who never ceased to work evil among gods and men.  So Baldur was prevented from coming back to Asgard.  (In Longfellow's Poems, vol. 1, page 379, will be found a poem entitled Tegner's Drapa, upon the subject of Baldur's death.)\\n\\nAmong Matthew Arnold's Poems is one called \\\"Balder Death\\\" beginning thus:\\n\\n\\\"So on the floor lay Balder dead; and round Lay thickly strewn swords, axes, darts and spears, Which all the Gods in sport had idly thrown At Balder, whom no weapon pierced or clave; But in his breast stood fixt the fatal bough Of mistletoe, which Lok the Accuser gave To Hoder, and unwitting Hoder threw; \\\"Gainst that alone had Balder's life no charm. And all the Gods and all the heroes came And stood round Balder on the bloody floor Weeping and wailing; and Valhalla rang Up to its golden roof with sobs and cries; And on the table stood the untasted meats, And in the horns and gold-rimmed skulls the wine; And now would night have fallen and found them yet Wailing; but otherwise was Odin's will.\\\"\\n\\nTHE FUNERAL OF BALDUR\\n\\nThe gods took up the dead body and bore it to the sea-shore where stood Baldur's ship Hringham, which passed for the largest in the world.  Baldur's dead body was put on the funeral pile, on board the ship, and his wife Nanna was so struck with grief at the sight that she broke her heart, and her body was burned on the same pile with her husband's.  There was a vast concourse of various kinds of people at Baldur's obsequies.  First came Odin accompanied by Frigga, the Valkyrior, and his ravens; then Frey in his car drawn by Gullinbursti, the boar; Heimdall rode his horse Gulltopp, and Freya drove in her chariot drawn by cats. There were also a great many Frost giants and giants of the mountain present.  Baldur's horse was led to the pile fully caparisoned and consumed in the same flames with his master.\\n\\nBut Loki did not escape his deserved punishment.  When he saw how angry the gods were, he fled to the mountain, and there built himself a hut with four doors, so that he could see every approaching danger.  He invented a net to catch the fishes, such as fishermen have used since his time.  But Odin found out his hiding-place and the gods assembled to take him.  He, seeing this, changed himself into a salmon, and lay hid among the stones of the brook.  But the gods took his net and dragged the brook, and Loki finding he must be caught, tried to leap over the net; but Thor caught him by the tail and compressed it so, that salmons every since have had that part remarkably fine and thin. They bound him with chains and suspended a serpent over his head, whose venom falls upon his face drop by drop.  His wife Siguna sits by his side and catches the drops as they fall, in a cup; but when she carries it away to empty it, the venom falls upon Loki, which makes him howl with horror, and twist his body about so violently that the whole earth shakes, and this produces what men call earthquakes.\\n\\nTHE ELVES\\n\\nThe Edda mentions another class of beings, inferior to the gods, but still possessed of great power; these were called Elves.  The white spirits, or Elves of Light, were exceedingly fair, more brilliant than the sun, and clad in garments of delicate and transparent texture.  They loved the light, were kindly disposed to mankind, and generally appeared as fair and lovely children. Their country was called Alfheim, and was the domain of Freyr, the god of the sun, in whose light they were always sporting.\\n\\nThe black of Night Elves were a different kind of creatures. Ugly, long-nosed dwarfs, of a dirty brown color, they appeared only at night, for they avoided the sun as their most deadly enemy, because whenever his beams fell upon any of them they changed them immediately into stones.  Their language was the echo of solitudes, and their dwelling-places subterranean caves and clefts.  They were supposed to have come into existence as maggots, produced by the decaying flesh of Ymir's body, and were afterwards endowed by the gods with a human form and great understanding.  They were particularly distinguished for a knowledge of the mysterious powers of nature, and for the runes which they carved and explained.  They were the most skilful artificers of all created beings, and worked in metals and in wood.  Among their most noted works were Thor's hammer, and the ship Skidbladnir, which they gave to Freyr, and which was so large that it could contain all the deities with their war and household implements, but so skilfully was it wrought that when folded together it could be put into a side pocket.\\n\\nRAGNABOK, THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS\\n\\nIt was a firm belief of the northern nations that a time would come when all the visible creation, the gods of Valhalla and Niffleheim, the inhabitants of Jotunheim, Alfheim, and Midgard, together with their habitations, would be destroyed.  The fearful day of destruction will not, however, be without its forerunners. First will come a triple winter, during which snow will fall from the four corners of the heavens, the frost be very severe, the wind piercing, the weather tempestuous, and the sun impart no gladness.  Three such winters will pass away without being tempered by a single summer.  Three other similar winters will then follow, during which war and discord will spread over the universe.  The earth itself will be frightened and begin to tremble, the sea leave its basin, the heavens tear asunder, and men perish in great numbers, and the eagles of the air feast upon their still quivering bodies.  The wolf Fenris will now break his bands, the Midgard serpent rise out of her bed in the sea, and Loki, released from his bonds, will join the enemies of the gods. Amidst the general devastation the sons of Muspelheim will rush forth under their leader Surtur, before and behind whom are flames and burning fire.  Onward they ride over Bifrost, the rainbow bridge, which breaks under the horses' hoofs.  But they, disregarding its fall, direct their course to the battle-field called Vigrid.  Thither also repair the wolf Fenris, the Midgard serpent, Loki with all the followers of Hela, and the Frost giants.\\n\\nHeimdall now stands up and sounds the Giallar horn to assemble the gods and heroes for the contest.  The gods advance, led on by Odin, who engages the wolf Fenris, but falls a victim to the monster, who is, however, slain by Vidar, Odin's son.  Thor gains great renown by killing the Midgard serpent, but recoils and falls dead, suffocated with the venom which the dying monster vomits over him.  Loki and Heimdall meet and fight till they are both slain.  The Gods and their enemies having fallen in battle, Surtur, who has killed Dreyr, darts fire and flames over the world, and the whole universe is burned up.  The sun becomes dim, the earth sinks into the ocean, the stars fall from heaven, and time is no more.\\n\\nAfter this Alfadur (the almighty) will cause a new heaven and a new earth to arise out of the sea.  The new earth, filled with abundant supplies, will spontaneously produce its fruits without labor or care. Wickedness and misery will no more be known, but the gods and men will live happily together.\\n\\nRUNIC LETTERS\\n\\nOne cannot travel far in Denmark, Norway, or Sweden, without meeting with great stones, of different forms, engraven with characters called Runic, which appear at first sight very different from all we know.  The letters consist almost invariably of straight lines, in the shape of little sticks either singly or put together.  Such sticks were in early times used by the northern nations for the purpose of ascertaining future events.  The sticks were shaken up, and from the figures that they formed a kind of divination was derived.\\n\\nThe Runic characters were of various kinds.  They were chiefly used for magical purposes.  The noxious, or, as they called them, the BITTER runes, were employed to bring various evils on their enemies; the favorable averted misfortune.  Some were medicinal, others employed to win love, etc.  In later times they were frequently used for inscriptions, of which more than a thousand have been found.  The language is a dialect of the Gothic, called Norse, still in use in Iceland.  The inscriptions may therefore be read with certainty, but hitherto very few have been found which throw the least light on history.  They are mostly epitaphs on tombstones.\\n\\nGray's ode on the Descent of Odin contains an allusion to the use of Runic letters for incantation:\\n\\n\\\"Facing to the northern clime, Thrice he traced the Runic rhyme; Thrice pronounced, in accents dread, The thrilling verse that wakes the dead, Till from out the hollow ground Slowly breathed a sullen sound.\\\"\\n\\nTHE SKALDS\\n\\nThe Skalds were the bards and poets of the nation, a very important class of men in all communities in an early stage of civilization.  They are the depositaries of whatever historic lore there is, and it is their office to mingle something of intellectual gratification with the rude feasts of the warriors, by rehearsing, with such accompaniments of poetry and music as their skill can afford, the exploits of their heroes living or dead.  The compositions of the Skalds were called Sagas, many of which have come down to us, and contain valuable materials of history, and a faithful picture of the state of society at the time to which they relate.\\n\\nICELAND\\n\\nThe Eddas and Sagas have come to us from Iceland.  The following extract from Carlyle's Lectures on Heroes and Hero worship gives an animated account of the region where the strange stories we have been reading had their origin.  Let the reader contrast it for a moment with Greece, the parent of classical mythology.\\n\\n\\\"In that strange island, Iceland,   burst up, the geologists say, by fire from the bottom of the sea, a wild land of barrenness and lava, swallowed many months of every year in black tempests, yet with a wild, gleaming beauty in summer time, towering up there stern and grim in the North Ocean, with its snow yokuls (mountains), roaring geysers (boiling springs), sulphur pools, and horrid volcanic chasms, like the vast, chaotic battle-field of Frost and Fire,   where, of all places, we least looked for literature or written memorials,   the record of these things was written down.  On the seaboard of this wild land is a rim of grassy country, where cattle can subsist, and men by means of them and of what the sea yields; and it seems they were poetic men these, men who had deep thoughts in them and uttered musically their thoughts.  Much would be lost had Iceland not been burst up from the sea, not been discovered by the Northmen!\\\"\\n\\nChapter XXXIV The Druids   Iona\\n\\nThe Druids were the priests or ministers of religion among the ancient Celtic nations in Gaul, Britain, and Germany.  Our information respecting them is borrowed from notices in the Greek and Roman writers, compared with the remains of Welsh and Gaelic poetry still extant.\\n\\nThe Druids combined the functions of the priest, the magistrate, the scholar, and the physician.  They stood to the people of the Celtic tribes in a relation closely analogous to that in which the Brahmans of India, the Magi of Persia, and the priests of the Egyptians stood to the people respectively by whom they were revered.\\n\\nThe Druids taught the existence of one God, to whom they gave a name \\\"Be'al,\\\" which Celtic antiquaries tell us means \\\"the life of everything,\\\" or \\\"the source of all beings,:\\\" and which seems to have affinity with the Phoenician Baal.  What renders this affinity more striking is that the Druids as well as the Phoenicians identified this, their supreme deity, with the Sun. Fire was regarded as a symbol of the divinity.  The Latin writers assert that the Druids also worshipped numerous inferior Gods. They used no images to represent the object of their worship, nor did they meet in temples or buildings of any kind for the performance of their sacred rites.  A circle of stones (each stone generally of vast size) enclosing an area of from twenty feet to thirty yards in diameter, constituted their sacred place. The most celebrated of these now remaining is Stonehenge, on Salisbury Plain, England.\\n\\nThese sacred circles were generally situated near some stream, or under the shadow of a grove or wide-spreading oak.  In the centre of the circle stood the Cromlech or altar, which was a large stone, placed in the manner of a table upon other stones set up on end.  The Druids had also their high places, which were large stones or piles of stones on the summits of hills.  These were called Cairns, and were used in the worship of the deity under the symbol of the sun.\\n\\nThat the Druids offered sacrifices to their deity there can be no doubt.  But there is some uncertainty as to what they offered, and of the ceremonies connected with their religious services we know almost nothing.  The classical (Roman) writers affirm that they offered on great occasions human sacrifices; as for success in war or for relief from dangerous diseases.  Caesar has given a detailed account of the manner in which this was done.  \\\"They have images of immense size, the limbs of which are framed with twisted twigs and filled with living persons.  These being set on fire, those within are encompassed by the flames.\\\"  Many attempts have been made by Celtic writers to shake the testimony of the Roman historians to this fact, but without success.\\n\\nThe Druids observed two festivals in each year.  The former took place in the beginning of May, and was called Beltane or \\\"fire of God.\\\"  On this occasion a large fire was kindled on some elevated spot, in honor of the sun, whose returning beneficence they thus welcomed after the gloom and desolation of winter.  Of this custom a trace remains in the name given to Whitsunday in parts of Scotland to this day.  Sir Walter Scott uses the word in the Boat Song in the Lady of the Lake:\\n\\n\\\"Ours is no sapling, chance-sown by the fountain, Blooming at Beltane in winter to fade.\\\"\\n\\nThe other great festival of the Druids was called \\\"Samh'in,\\\" or \\\"fire of peace,\\\" and was held on Hallow-eve (first of November), which still retains this designation in the Highlands of Scotland.  On this occasion the Druids assembled in solemn conclave, in the most central part of the district, to discharge the judicial functions of their order.  All questions, whether public or private, all crimes against person or property, were at this time brought before them for adjudication.  With these judicial acts were combined certain superstitious usages, especially the kindling of the sacred fire, from which all the fires in the district which had been beforehand scrupulously extinguished, might be relighted.  This usage of kindling fires on Hallow-eve lingered in the British Islands long after the establishment of Christianity.\\n\\nBesides these two great annual festivals, the Druids were in the habit of observing the full moon, and especially the sixth day of the moon.  On the latter they sought the mistletoe, which grew on their favorite oaks, and to which, as well as to the oak itself, they ascribed a peculiar virtue and sacredness.  The discovery of it was an occasion of rejoicing and solemn worship.  \\\"They call it,\\\" says Pliny, \\\"by a word in their language which means 'heal- all,' and having made solemn preparation for feasting and sacrifice under the tree, they drive thither two milk-white bulls, whose horns are then for the first time bound.  The priest then, robed in white, ascends the tree, and cuts off the mistletoe with a golden sickle.  It is caught in a white mantle, after which they proceed to slay the victims, at the same time praying that god would render his gift prosperous to those to whom he had given it.  They drink the water in which it has been infused, and think it a remedy for all diseases.  The mistletoe is a parasitic plant, and is not always nor often found on the oak, so that when it is found it is the more precious.\\\"\\n\\nThe Druids were the teachers of morality as well as of religion. Of their ethical teaching a valuable specimen is preserved in the Triads of the Welsh Bards, and from this we may gather that their views of moral rectitude were on the whole just, and that they held and inculcated many very noble and valuable principles of conduct.  They were also the men of science and learning of their age and people.  Whether they were acquainted with letters or not has been disputed, though the probability is strong that they were, to some extent.  But it is certain that they committed nothing of their doctrine, their history, or their poetry to writing.  Their teaching was oral, and their literature (if such a word may be used in such a case) was preserved solely by tradition.  But the Roman writers admit that \\\"they paid much attention to the order and laws of nature, and investigated and taught to the youth under their charge many things concerning the stars and their motions, the size of the world and the lands , and concerning the might and power of the immortal gods.\\\"\\n\\nTheir history consisted in traditional tales, in which the heroic deeds of their forefathers were celebrated.  These were apparently in verse, and thus constituted part of the poetry as well as the history of the Druids.  In the poems of Ossian we have, if not the actual productions of Druidical times, what may be considered faithful representations of the songs of the Bards.\\n\\nThe Bards were an essential part of the Druidical hierarchy.  One author, Pennant, says, \\\"The bards were supposed to be endowed with powers equal to inspiration.  They were the oral historians of all past transactions, public and private.  They were also accomplished genealogists.\\\"\\n\\nPennant gives a minute account of the Eisteddfods or sessions of the bards and minstrels, which were held in Wales for many centuries, long after the Druidical priesthood in its other departments became extinct.  At these meetings none but bards of merit were suffered to rehearse their pieces, and minstrels of skill to perform.  Judges were appointed to decide on their respective abilities, and suitable degrees were conferred.  In the earlier period the judges were appointed by the Welsh princes, and after the conquest of Wales, by commission from the kings of England.  Yet the tradition is that Edward I., in revenge for the influence of the bards, in animating the resistance of the people to his sway, persecuted them with great cruelty.  This tradition has furnished the poet Gray with the subject of his celebrated ode, the Bard.\\n\\nThere are still occasional meetings of the lovers of Welsh poetry and music, held under the ancient name.  Among Mrs. Heman's poems is one written for an Eisteddfod, or meeting of Welsh Bards, held in London May 22, 1822.  It begins with a description of the ancient meeting, of which the following lines are a part:\\n\\n\\\"----- midst the eternal cliffs, whose strength defied The crested Roman in his hour of pride; And where the Druid's ancient cromlech frowned, And the oaks breathed mysterious murmurs round, There thronged the inspired of yore! On plain or height, In the sun's face, beneath the eye of light, And baring unto heaven each noble head, Stood in the circle, where none else might tread.\\\"\\n\\nThe Druidical system was at its height at the time of the Roman invasion under Julius Caesar.  Against the Druids, as their chief enemies, these conquerors of the world directed their unsparing fury.  The Druids, harassed at all points on the main-land, retreated to Anglesey and Iona, where for a season they found shelter, and continued their now-dishonored rites.\\n\\nThe Druids retained their predominance in Iona and over the adjacent islands and main-land until they were supplanted and their superstitions overturned by the arrival of St. Columba, the apostle of the Highlands, by whom the inhabitants of that district were first led to profess Christianity.\\n\\nIONA\\n\\nOne of the smallest of the British Isles, situated near a ragged and barren coast, surrounded by dangerous seas, and possessing no sources of internal wealth, Iona has obtained an imperishable place in history as the seat of civilization and religion at a time when the darkness of heathenism hung over almost the whole of Northern Europe.  Iona or Icolmkill is situated at the extremity of the island of Mull, from which it is separated by a strait of half a mile in breadth, its distance from the main-land of Scotland being thirty-six miles.\\n\\nColumba was a native of Ireland, and connected by birth with the princes of the land.  Ireland was at that time a land of gospel light, while the western and northern parts of Scotland were still immersed in the darkness of heathenism.  Columba, with twelve friends landed on the island of Iona in the year of our Lord 563, having made the passage in a wicker boat covered with hides.  The Druids who occupied the island endeavored to prevent his settling there, and the savage nations on the adjoining shores incommoded him with their hostility, and on several occasions endangered his life by their attacks.  Yet by his perseverance and zeal he surmounted all opposition, procured from the king a gift of the island, and established there a monastery of which he was the abbot.  He was unwearied in his labors to disseminate a knowledge of the Scriptures throughout the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, and such was the reverence paid him that though not a bishop, but merely a presbyter and monk, the entire province with its bishops was subject to him and his successors.  The Pictish monarch was so impressed with a sense of his wisdom and worth that he held him in the highest honor, and the neighboring chiefs and princes sought his counsel and availed themselves of his judgment in settling their disputes.\\n\\nWhen Columba landed on Iona he was attended by twelve followers whom he had formed into a religious body, of which he was the head.  To these, as occasion required, others were from time to time added, so that the original number was always kept up. Their institution was called a monastery, and the superior an abbot, but the system had little in common with the monastic institutions of later times.  The name by which those who submitted to the rule were known was that of Culdees, probably from the Latin \\\"cultores Dei\\\"   worshippers of God.  They were a body of religious persons associated together for the purpose of aiding each other in the common work of preaching the gospel and teaching youth, as well as maintaining in themselves the fervor of devotion by united exercises of worship.  On entering the order certain vows were taken by the members, but they were not those which were usually imposed by monastic orders, for of these, which are three, celibacy, poverty, and obedience, the Culdees were bound to none except the third.  To poverty they did not bind themselves; on the contrary, they seem to have labored diligently to procure for themselves and those dependent on them the comforts of life.  Marriage also was allowed them, and most of them seem to have entered into that state.  True, their wives were not permitted to reside with them at the institution, but they had a residence assigned to them in an adjacent locality. Near Iona there is an island which still bears the name of \\\"Eilen nam ban,\\\" women's island, where their husbands seem to have resided with them, except when duty required their presence in the school or the sanctuary.\\n\\nCampbell, in his poem of Reullura, alludes to the married monks of Iona:\\n\\n\\\" -----The pure Culdees Were Albyn's earliest priests of God, Ere yet an island of her seas By foot of Saxon monk was trod, Long ere her churchmen by bigotry Were barred from holy wedlock's tie. 'Twas then that Aodh, famed afar, In Iona preached the word with power. And Reullura, beauty's star, Was the partner of his bower.\\\"\\n\\nIn one of his Irish Melodies, Moore gives the legend of St. Senanus and the lady who sought shelter on the island, but was repulsed:\\n\\n\\\"Oh, haste and leave this sacred isle, Unholy bark, ere morning smile; For on thy deck, though dark it be, A female form I see; And I have sworn this sainted sod Shall ne'er by woman's foot be trod.\\n\\nIn these respects and in others the Culdees departed from the established rules of the Romish Church, and consequently were deemed heretical.  The consequence was that as the power of the latter advanced, that of the Culdees was enfeebled.  It was not, however, till the thirteenth century that the communities of the Culdees were suppressed and the members dispersed.  They still continued to labor as individuals, and resisted the inroads of Papa usurpation as they best might till the light of the Reformation dawned on the world.\\n\\nIonia, from its position in the western seas, was exposed to the assaults of the Norwegian and Danish rovers by whom those seas were infested, and by them it was repeatedly pillaged, its dwellings burned, and its peaceful inhabitants put to the sword. These unfavorable circumstances led to its gradual decline, which was expedited by the supervision of the Culdees throughout Scotland.  Under the reign of Popery the island became the seat of a nunnery, the ruins of which are still seen.  At the Reformation, the nuns were allowed to remain, living in community, when the abbey was dismantled.\\n\\nIonia is now chiefly resorted to by travellers on account of the numerous ecclesiastical and sepulchral remains which are found upon it.  The principal of these are the Cathedral or Abbey Church, and the Chapel of the Nunnery.  Besides these remains of ecclesiastical antiquity, there are some of an earlier date, and pointing to the existence on the island of forms of worship and belief different from those of Christianity.  These are the circular Cairns which are found in various parts, and which seem to have been of Druidical origin.  It is in reference to all these remains of ancient religion that Johnson exclaims, \\\"That man is little to be envied whose patriotism would not gain force upon the plains of Marathon, or whose piety would not grow warmer amid the ruins of Iona.\\\"\\n\\nIn the Lord of the Isles, Scott beautifully contrasts the church on Iona with the Cave of Staffa, opposite:\\n\\n\\\"Nature herself, it seemed, would raise A minister to her Maker's praise! Not for a meaner use ascend Her columns or her arches bend; Nor of a theme less solemn tells The mighty surge that ebbs and swells, And still between each awful pause, >From the high vault an answer draws, In varied tone, prolonged and high, That mocks the organ's melody; Nor doth its entrance front in vain To old Iona's holy fane, That Nature's voice might seem to say, Well hast thou done, frail child of clay, Thy humble powers that stately shrine Tasked high and hard   but witness mine.\\\"\\n\\nSKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF GREEK SCULPTURE\\n\\nWe have seen throughout the course of this book how the Greek and Norse myths have furnished material for the poets, not only of Greece and Scandinavia, but also of modern times.  In the same way these stories have been found capable of artistic treatment by painters, sculptors, and even by musicians.  The story of Cupid and Psyche has not only been retold by poets from Apuleius to William Morris, but also drawn out in a series of frescoes by Raphael, and sculptured in marble by Canova.  Even to enumerate the works of art of the modern and ancient world which depend for their subject-matter upon mythology would be a task for a book by itself.  As we have been able to give only a few illustrations of the poetic treatment of some of the principal myths, so we shall have to content ourselves with a similarly limited view of the part played by them in other fields of art.\\n\\nOf the statues made by the ancients themselves to represent their greater deities, a few have been already commented on.  But it must not be thought that these splendid examples of plastic art, the Olympian Jupiter and the Athene of the Parthenon, represent the earliest attempts of the Greeks to give form to their myths in sculpture.  Our most primitive sources of knowledge of much of Greek mythology are the Homeric poems, where the stories of Achilles and Ulysses have already taken on a poetic form, almost the highest conceivable.  But in the other arts, Greek genius lagged behind.  At the time when the Homeric poems were written, we find no traces of columned temples or magnificent statues. Scarcely were the domestic arts sufficiently advanced to allow the poet to describe dwellings glorious enough for his heroes to live in, or articles of common utility fit for their use.  Of the two most famous works of art mentioned in the Iliad we must think of the statue of Athene at Troy (the Palladium) as a rude carving perhaps of wood, the arms of the goddess separated from the body only enough to allow her to hold the lance and spindle, which were the signs of her divinity.  The splendor of the shield of Achilles must be attributed largely to the rich imagination of the poet.\\n\\nOther works of art of this primitive age we know from descriptions in later classical writers.  They attributed the rude statues which had come down to them to Daedalus and his pupils, and beheld them with wonder at their uncouth ugliness. It was long thought that these beginnings of Greek sculpture were to be traced to Egypt, but now-a-days scholars are inclined to take a different view.  Egyptian sculpture was closely allied to architecture; the statues were frequently used for the columns of temples.  Thus sculpture was subordinated to purely mechanical principles, and human figures were represented altogether in accordance with established conventions.  Greek sculpture, on the contrary, even in its primitive forms was eminently natural, capable of developing a high degree of realism.  From the first it was decorative in character, and this left the artist free to execute in his own way, provided only that the result should be in accordance with the highest type of beauty which he could conceive.  An example of this early decorative art was the chest of Kypselos, on which stories from Homer were depicted in successive bands, the reliefs being partly inlaid with gold and ivory.\\n\\n> From the sixth century before Christ date three processes of great importance in the development of sculpture; the art of casting in bronze, the chiselling of marble, and the inlaying of gold and ivory on wood (chryselephantine work).  As early Greek literature developed first among the island Greeks, so the invention of these three methods of art must br attributed to the colonists away from the original Hellas.  To the Samians is probably due the invention of bronze casting, to the Chians the beginning of sculpture in marble.  This latter development opened to Greek sculpture its great future.  Marble work was carried on by a race of artists beginning with Melas in the seventh century and coming down to Boupalos and Athenis, the sons of Achermos, whose works survived to the time of Augustus.
