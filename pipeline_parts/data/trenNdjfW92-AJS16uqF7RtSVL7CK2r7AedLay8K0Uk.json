"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Wikipedia, Minecraft, and classroom/sport group chats are the *default tools* for my kids to learn, play, and collaborate. Just like the library, a game of FIFA 1998 against a friend over a phone-line internet connection and a telephone tree were for me in the nineties. I’m sure this is relatable, with new times comes new tech which is both great and invites us to be a bit nostalgic about. Life goes on and the generation coming up after you will, broadly spoken, live the same life with a few tech improvements. \\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n This time however it’s different.\\n\\nDifferent in all forms and categories that matter to kids. Let’s say that the 5 categories below in its own way represent the most important things in life for kids (huge simplification and generalisation, I know:) \\n\\n* Family\\n* Friends \\n* School\\n* Sports / Arts / Music\\n* Money\\n\\n![Metamask logo - https://metamask.io/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/q7BW8MIQWuONeOhXkayHK.png?height=1024&width=1024)\\n\\nI find that my kids, and their peers, experience all 5 categories substantially different than my and my friends growing up in the 1990’s did. This not only opens up way more possibilities for them but also *programs* them in a fundamentally different way than lots of generations before them.  \\n\\nIn this series I aim to explore how their life, and their future, has already fundamentally changed. For me, it would be great to find insights into the *programming* and *default modes* of ‘these kids nowadays’. \\n\\n*So in fact just a bit of factual reporting going on here in the year 2021 on two kids of 10 and 8 years old. Looking at the impact new technologies have right now and a bit further down the road, on their immediate future as they venture into their teens and twenties. Don’t expect well thought out visionary stuff, I will however link to blogs that inspired me to go on this experimental journey with my kids.*\\n\\n**What I found when on our journey - and aim to explore together with you in separate entries**\\n\\n* These kids don’t have a bank account, but have made money online already by selling NFTs\\n* These kids have experienced online education and see how their education could be boundless, online\\n* These kids default mode is to build, instead of consume, when they play their games. Minecraft, Roblox, and such\\n* These kids connect to peers who have the same interests as them. Age, location, education, gender all doesn’t matter to them\\n* These kids…well let’s see what ‘These Kids Nowadays’ will bring in my next entry.\\n\\n*I hope you as a parent of care-giver are inspired to venture on this path as well. It would be of tremendous value for me and others to learn of your stories, anekdotes and inspiration when entering this new world together with your kids!*\",\"timestamp\":1633521496,\"title\":\"These kids nowadays...\"},\"digest\":\"aF_EaRV-ErStFvTY9j_HEMxQNP1ZTdOw4XZFj0QVTy8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xCaFB6000b1922D8F3B2D628B829E18e8Bb50e0F2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"b3HjrEGvsF30Em4qmSte5vNxcxV6qTqOfLYBnpSSD_o\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZKsDIls-Venx1-iIhZwIYpMyFK1o-GJ7Xjs6gBXYB3E\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"MjKIEoXABnjnAcWfdXQz4KFZLTMr-xHS0L3lJ_TrNKPhvOlFFaEsWPLrC1MXXNcKpzTCnEWXQFF5Ua0qb0CsIg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x23fea6ca90a5a5aada626480f5cdecf4f673dbce920260ce43a0686feb7a6d8a3db3cb9bef77a8a82eec6144c5e4d332682342bb6f17c1925473d4664a42e06e1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"b3HjrEGvsF30Em4qmSte5vNxcxV6qTqOfLYBnpSSD_o\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZKsDIls-Venx1-iIhZwIYpMyFK1o-GJ7Xjs6gBXYB3E\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"8ShiCs1tS1yNACiFD6bEVL1HdsfzfKxk1uMkQB48kX8\"}"
