Neal, the head of BD North America, highly praised their outstanding work in growing the community. The most exciting part is the free talk section where participants raised questions about Amara’s marketing schedules and shared proposals on how to grow the community. Worth mentioning, attendees also started a voice call on telegram group to continue discusstion after the 1-hour meeting. Here are meeting minutes.\\n\\n**Meeting Recap**\\n\\n> Q: I shared the necessary details and links with some friends. But some people are hesitate to go through it in fear of being scammed. So how can we make Amara this project more accessible and transparent?\\n\\nA: First we need to know why your friends would think the links could be scamming. We have to know the reasons first then we can solve this problem. And we have got a grant from Polygon, very reputable in India and we think almost all crypto players in India know about it. And our products have already been deployed on Moonriver. We also promoted the latest progress on telegram, medium and twitter, these informations can be shared with them and prove the accessibility of Amara.\\n\\n> Q: When Amara will be listed on some exchanges or DEXs？\\n\\nA: We are communicating with some DEXs. We will announce the news as soon as possible once Amara is listed.\\n\\n> Q: Most investors just focus on the price of the token in the short term instead of the real value of the project. Can you tell us the motivation and benefits for investors to hold the tokens in the long term?\\n\\nA: Token holders will have power of voting and participating in project governance. Long-tail assets are generally more risky, but with higher rewards. The project also will solve a major problem of uncertainties and risks of high quality long tail assets by designing a stable interest model for long tail and introducing a risk management system so that users can see their asset growth without worrying about catastrophic loss. So users can hold Mara and stake MARA with better risk control. MARA is also a deflationary token, which means if you are a holder, you will not suffer market volatility.\\n\\n> Q: What plans do you have to grow rapidly in terms of users, global market and partners? What are your strategies in building a big and strong community?\\n\\nA: To begin with, We would like to hear your thoughts. As ambassadors of Amara, your ideas and contributions to grow the community matter. For us, first and foremost, we need to polish our product, only strong products which can bring real benefits and conveniences to our users could attract users from all over the world. Then we will cooperate with famous and reputable communities and KOLs to do some marketing. Of course we’d love to see you guys connect us with the communities you trust and bring Amara more followers.\\n\\n> Q: How about rewards and incentives for ambassadors?\\n\\nA: It’s a good question. There will be rewards and incentives for ambassadors and different communities will have different rewards and incentives due to their different situations. But the details haven’t been worked out yet. And we’d like to hear your thoughts and suggestions. If you have any ideas, you are welcome to contact our admins later.\\n\\n> Q: When will IDO happen? On which platform IDO will take place?\\n\\nA: We’ve been talking with about five launchpads, after deliberate consideration, we decided to choose two trustworthy and reliable launchpads from them. We’ll release the news after all the details are settled.\\n\\n> Q: Can we arrange live youtube webinars with question answer rounds?\\n\\nA: Sure, we have plans to do Youtube webinars and we just discussed with our potential partners about marketing Amara in that way. That’s really a good way to conduct effective promotions. Youtube webinars could be arranged with famous and influential Youtubers in the DeFi field; it’s best if they enjoy a high reputation and focus on the Polkadot ecosystem.\\n\\n> Q: What plans do you have to reach big institutes? Because we need to cooperate with big institutes to grow Amara?\\n\\nDefinitely, big institutes will play a really important role in growing Amara. We will select institutes based in different countries and regions. Many institutes of different scales reached out to us and we are so glad to be trusted by them. The principle we apply on selecting our marketing partner is always honest and reputable. We’d really appreciate it If you would like to recommend some big institutes and are willing to connect us.\\n\\n> Q: Can we open an Amara Showrooms (Amara shop) for branding of Amara or can we approach Amazon also?\\n\\nThat’s an interesting idea! Actually one of our ambassadors has already built a showroom website full of Amara logo clothes. They are well-designed. We have plans to make this kind of clothes available and affordable to our users. Amazon is a great channel! After we finish our design, we’ll let you know.\\n\\n> Q: What’s the plans regarding boosting the community? How can we attract more community because only by saying about amara they will not attract so some airdrop or some kind of points or anything we can give?\\n\\nA: Recently, we are planning to do giveaways in different communities. We will customize the rules according to our ambassadors’ suggestions and proposals, you know conditions and trends in your own community best. These proposals are being considered, invitation competitions, reward quizs, article creation campaigns and bounty campaigns, to name a few.\\n\\n> Q: How about holding some competitions among the communities and rewarding them?\\n\\nA: Competitions among communities can be a good way and there will be coupling effects. This idea will be discussed. We’ll talk with community leaders and give you feedback soon.\\n\\n## About Amara Finance\\n\\nAmara is a top lending protocol within the Polkadot ecosystem.
