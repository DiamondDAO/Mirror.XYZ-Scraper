Like we thought we would have space travel by now 50 years ago, but we only have smart phones. However, we always underestimate short-term technology progress, like what blockchain could do to reform our existing system.\\n\\n10\\\\.20\\n\\nSecurity tokenizes, or token securitizes. Same thing.\\n\\n10\\\\.21\\n\\nForeseeing the future is one thing; knowing the timing is another. I couldn’t agree more.\\n\\n\\\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n11\\\\.1\\n\\nIn crypto, is code really law? Hard to say. But information is power.\\n\\n11\\\\.2\\n\\nTwo things must be scarce in metaverse: attention and computing power. I don’t want ANY company to own both. Cause I am not in that company.\\n\\n11\\\\.3\\n\\nIf it looks like a dead end, it’s because you look at it in the wrong way. So, stand higher, or push harder, there’s always a way. Personally, I prefer the former.\\n\\n11\\\\.3\\n\\nUnder promise and over deliver. Quite like us.\\n\\n11\\\\.8\\n\\nPopa in the pool,\\n\\nSwimming like a fool,\\n\\nA tool, a wool,\\n\\nI think it’s cool.\\n\\n11\\\\.9\\n\\nGovernors are smart, don’t underestimate them. It’s not them want to regulate. It’s the common people. They need time to accept innovation. They are the ones resist new things. And during most times, they are right. Just not this time. We need to be more patient and consistent. No real advance comes at its first try. We focus on the silent middle, and welcome them to take a shot.\\n\\n11\\\\.10\\n\\nArmies, Gold, Flags? The most powerful thing in the world is stories. So, where is your story with Sypool? Cz I have a lot.\\n\\n11\\\\.15\\n\\nRight, we couldn’t leave the earth by dragging our own hair. But since we have stand on the ground, why do we still dream of flying?\\n\\n12\\\\.1\\n\\nEvery pain would become a gain somewhere in the future, take it easy, we need time to enrich ourselves.\\n\\n\\\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n12\\\\.3\\n\\nI like its ending, everyday is Day 1.\\n\\n12\\\\.3\\n\\nWAGMI. We’re all gonna make it.\\n\\n12\\\\.14\\n\\nDon’t love your stock, and your token. Decide on Status quo, not past emotion.
