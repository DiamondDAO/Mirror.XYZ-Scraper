He looks both pleased and hopeful, with arms outstretched embracing the space and its’ possibilities. But maybe he is about to be crucified, by the art world, by his own ambition, by addiction.\\n\\nSeth Tillet tells me he was stoned, from pot or heroin it’s not clear. He could not be enticed out to the [Mudd Clubb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudd_Club) that evening, preferring to start work on what would become an explosive art career he had engineered through [SAMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAMO) graffiti, precisely placed around the SOHO art and gallery scene.\\n\\nHow did he get here?\\n\\nArt has the parameters of place, time and a [way of seeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ways_of_Seeing) so understanding this photo needs some exploration. Here is the gallery building at Prince st today, the gallery long closed:\\n\\n![100 Prince St SOHO, NYC.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MFIdTSSWhsU3aZuSzFiP9.png?height=2186&width=3814)\\n\\nSOHO now, and when I last walked around in 2017 is bland, mainly clothing stores and high end real estate consultants. If one considers that New York is layered vertically, and that what is accessible from the street is a tiny portion of the cultural motherlode, it is still clear that in 2021 culture has moved on from this place. But in 1981 that was not the case. What we can see now is a wonderful high ceilinged NY loft building, now representing a global lifestyle motif in itself, and just the place to imagine Basquiat making big, important work, 40 years ago. (As I write I can hear the noise of a New York style ‘loft’ development going up in my neighbourhood, 12000 miles away from where Basquiat would emerge, but I digress).\\n\\n![The Annina Nosei Gallery in SOHO from 1980-1995](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e1pTCU-9gWcI7qf97BqHo.png?height=1420&width=1202)\\n\\nBasquiat is here by design, and his short lived gallerist is [Annina Nosei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annina_Nosei), currently still alive aged 83. He had come here strategically. It’s hard to exactly define in retrospect what it was that got him here, but raw talent and hustle seem important. \\n  \\n \\n\\n**Downtown 81** \\n In Dec 1980-Jan 1981 Jean-Michel, then unknown, acted in [Downtown 81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_81) as the lead character of a day in the life of an artist. The film was made as a way to showcase bands at the time but for Basquiat it is a prescient roadmap. Remarkably it was only released at Canne in 2000.\\n\\nI tried renting or buying it but couldn’t due to various georestrictions, but ended up watching it [here](https://archive.org/details/Downtown81JeanMichelBasquiat). It is an amazing 71 minutes capturing the cultural zeitgiest of that time, and emblematic of the era. New York looks unbelievably run down and low rent, but alive with possibilities. Basquiat’s dialogue is dubbed, because the original was lost, but he looks assured, seeming to know what is coming. \\n  \\n **Diego Cortez and New York/New Wave at PS1, Feb 1981 \\n  \\n Rene Ricard and the Radiant Child, Artforum, Dec 1981**\\n\\n**References**\\n\\n[https://knownorigin.io/tokens/5983003](https://knownorigin.io/tokens/5983003)\\n\\n[https://www.artsy.net/article/christies-its-culture-or-its-not-culture-an](https://www.artsy.net/article/christies-its-culture-or-its-not-culture-an)\\n\\n[https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/jean-michel-basquiat-barbican-exhibition-boom-for-real-interviews](https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/jean-michel-basquiat-barbican-exhibition-boom-for-real-interviews)\\n\\n[https://www.vanityfair.com/news/1988/11/jean-michel-basquiat](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/1988/11/jean-michel-basquiat)\\n\\n[https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/jean-michel-basquiat-movie-downtown-81-metrograph.html](https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/jean-michel-basquiat-movie-downtown-81-metrograph.html)\\n\\n[https://www.dazeddigital.com/art-photography/article/38813/1/curator-helped-launch-basquiats-career-diego-cortez-new-york-new-wave](https://www.dazeddigital.com/art-photography/article/38813/1/curator-helped-launch-basquiats-career-diego-cortez-new-york-new-wave)\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV6aLZyaFH8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV6aLZyaFH8)\\n\\n[https://brooklynrail.org/2021/09/in-memoriam/A-Tribute-to-Diego-Cortez](https://brooklynrail.org/2021/09/in-memoriam/A-Tribute-to-Diego-Cortez)\\n\\n**Postscript** \\n What is important to me is independence.
