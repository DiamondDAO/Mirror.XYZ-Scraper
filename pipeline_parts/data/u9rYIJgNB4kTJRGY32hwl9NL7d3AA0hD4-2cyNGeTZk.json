"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1968 Pacific Ocean, Northwest of Hawaii\\n\\nIt went missing on a routine patrol without a word of why, carrying ballistic nuclear missiles. \\n\\nSome say it was mechanical error, others say it was Cold War sabotage. The Soviet ballistic missile submarine K-129 was lost in the deep of the Pacific Ocean. The USSR gave up its search after 2 months. \\n\\nThe U.S., which had managed to recover 2 lost subs, had a plan. The prize were the warheads, the code books, and the metallurgical clues of how the Russians' boats were made. The nuclear missile gap had closed and the U.S. welcomed every Cold War edge it could get.\\n\\nThe best idea was out of childhood prize arcade machines - to build a big claw that could go dive among the pile of rock under the water and dark, and pull out a new cold war edge.\\n\\nThe secret plan had to have deniability.\\n\\nEnter a billionaire famous for secrecy. Howard Hughes.\\n\\nThe official story was that the \\\"Hughes Glomar Explorer\\\", was a deep-sea mining research ship. There was a public press announcement and christening for the Glomar Explorer's launch.\\n\\nHughes' reputation for secrecy was perfect cover for why the ship's voyage was kept quiet. The Glomar sailed to its rendezvous with a special barge, and the Glomar opened special doors on its bottom and picked up the metal claw, named \\\"Clementine\\\". The Glomar set off to the K-129's location, after POTUS 37, Nixon, authorized the mission.\\n\\nWhether or not the mission was a success is shrouded in mystery. Some reports remain classified. They came up with what is known as the \\\"Glomar Response\\\": \\\"We can neither confirm nor deny.\\\"\\n\\nThis tactic survived in federal court a FOIA request.\\n\\n2912 MARS EARTH TRANSIT\\n\\nJacob C. Tagore, Jr. was at last comfortable in the clothes, hair styling, and the latest AR “skins” from an old design house of Earth, limited edition 1 of 10 designs, that costed an asteroid’s worth of lokens, local tokens. He looked perfect for the role of a diplomatic attache and son of a ‘Garch of a wealthy Mars collaborative.\\n\\n“Turn on EXPEE, practice round 88.”\\n\\nAn unreal reality filled Jacob’s suite. He was no longer on a diplomatic MARS-EARTH transport, he was back home in the Crystal Palaces, playing host to a delegation from Earth for an annual conference on transit lane licenses - boring and opulent.\\n\\nIf one could become a great host, then one is a gracious guest. There was a chime.\\n\\n”Come in please.” Jacob let the EXPEE on. The whole crew was part of a floating cover given to all operatives.\\n\\n“Looking excellent, Jacob. How is it coming?”\\n\\n”It’s going well, Sergeant-major, thank you. Not bad for someone who grew up in the Outer System.”\\n\\nThe Sergeant-major smiled.\\n\\n“It’s time for drills sir. It may not all go smooth and by the book.”\\n\\nThe Sergeant-Major dived for Jacob and began a savage attack, which Jacob was countering. He was getting used to both high-loken lifestyle and down-and-dirty Martian street fighting.\\n\\n”Again, Jacob!! I’m not a damn Expee file, what’re you going to do?”\\n\\nCombat training continued for 2 hours.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fJp3cCsXkRgWHvO1Sswye.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PjXUb9vspQ2wj1AiuPV6D.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1634426289,\"title\":\"1961: 5.14 Neither Confirm Nor Deny, 2912\"},\"digest\":\"7sKJFklSlVKdRQjTGPPS5qDJhBE61o4VVVXk0ePcz10\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"D6yZTmcztRhYQw_uAdcba2YuZ2ZwvYxjVi4qpw5uiuCW3X57uQBpw1ebnQYZKMOoRRAG5thQUEjMYQzFpcHY1w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"IN5yPW-pERGQJByf778Sufb7VWkOU3DRyArk5qdmgXg\"}"
