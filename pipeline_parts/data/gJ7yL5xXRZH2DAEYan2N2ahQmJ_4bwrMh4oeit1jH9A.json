We are sorry but this is because **We are so early.** We are so early that right now, that there isn’t a win-win situation. Ideally, we want to work with a Gnosis-like player that can offer non-custodian fund management services (*free alpha for those listening*) so that everyone is happy, but it isn’t out there yet.
