They have two options, one is to refuse to plead guilty (cooperation), and the other is to recruit from the truth (betrayal). If neither of them pleaded guilty and the police station had insufficient evidence, they could only be detained for one month (3, 3). If one of them pleaded guilty, he could become a tainted witness and be acquitted, while the other who did not plead guilty would have to sit for ten. Years in prison (4, 1), if both plead guilty, it would not mean to taint the witness, because the evidence is very conclusive, and both will be in prison for eight years (2, 2). Of course, the specific figures will vary depending on the situation, and changing the profit and loss figures will also have a considerable impact on the results, but that is probably the case. Taking the above income statement as an example, the best solution for two prisoners is undoubtedly that both of them must resolutely plead guilty, so as to minimize the total sentence of the two prisoners. However, if the other party chooses to cooperate, he has to sit for a month when he cooperates, and the betrayal can be released in court, and the self-interested individual will choose to betray. And when the other party chooses to betray, he still co-operates and keeps silent, and he will go to jail for ten years. If he confesses to betrayal, he can take two years less. Self-interested individuals will choose to betray. The result is that the two who confessed separately often choose to betray without knowing the other's strategy, and the overall profit and loss will be (2, 2), and the total income for the two is the worst of the four cases.\\n\\nEveryone is absolutely self-interested, so just believing that human nature is Diamond Hands cannot achieve equilibrium under the prisoner’s dilemma example. It is necessary to restrict individual behavior through a unique mechanism or add external factors to achieve sustainability. The optimal solution of, leads two people to choose to cooperate and reach (3, 3).\\n\\nHere are some methods that can be used:\\n\\n1. Decentralized governance\\n\\n   The operation of ordinary investors on the chain is very different from the prisoner’s dilemma. It is inherently transparent, but I think the project party is not the police officer in the prisoner’s dilemma, but one of the prisoners at the same time, so they choose to betray and need to be in the form of DAO. Actively participate in actual decision-making, warehouse multi-signature management, contract open source and other methods to allow everyone to discuss strategies so as to avoid any betrayal. This sense of participation can also enhance community consensus and improve the benefits of (3, 3) in the income statement.\\n2. Set penalties\\n\\n   The extremely high gas fee of Ethereum itself is a very effective punishment mechanism. Many people (3, 3) see that the price of the currency has risen and the unstake is because the gas fee is too high.\\n3. Community activity\\n\\n   Unlike ordinary Defi protocols, Olympus fork has a high cohesion for the community. The community cohesion referred to here does not refer to the kind of \\\"drawing is justice,\\\" but community activities that have nothing to do with interests. For example, autonomy, community teaching film production without Incentives, native meme that is not a meme competition, community meetings of specific tribes, etc. Such activities can kidnap participants emotionally, make them see each other, and leave a bit of affection when dumping. \\n4. Project guard\\n\\n   Under the understanding of the prisoner’s dilemma, the two parties who do not understand each other often choose to betray in the initial cooperation, which means that there will be a lot of selling pressure in the early stage of the market, which makes it difficult to accumulate the original community. It can be expected that the longer the plate lives, a greater proportion of people will choose to cooperate rationally. Therefore, the initial confidence will collapse. If the project team or some of the giant whales can use some means to protect the disc, it may make the project endure the positive cycle in the later stage.\",\"timestamp\":1638283411,\"title\":\"Prisoner's dilemma: (3,3) optimal solution reached\"},\"digest\":\"TkYzneTH2lxHilw3FnfIh28-4Z3PJFrAXXlidgjRi9c\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x34D44BB48807f3C704Fc7e0ef8777d10149eBca7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"i-HjMBpCoRn1M05E5Xs8g8PqbhpYwbSRbhljpNzvsq0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"5_EIRkEgyTbG0hxjMK42rBl9b_THKMIZZhoD2xEt_tg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"-9fKEf8fSRPp_yKjpq-1dVBJ-dzyncbShcLWRKTNRg_-9V38MgZm2ynJ32pyVf1GAhQF9KYGrIEy3PXlD3gDYA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x99eeff19d3d7b33b8b790ff5cc7813f3b159aa60f06ec7b096bef6346ab2261a384a72895d66550c95f78a62f7f4c56d8d5dbcad34d47cfaac09861c85dd9fed1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"i-HjMBpCoRn1M05E5Xs8g8PqbhpYwbSRbhljpNzvsq0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"5_EIRkEgyTbG0hxjMK42rBl9b_THKMIZZhoD2xEt_tg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"TkYzneTH2lxHilw3FnfIh28-4Z3PJFrAXXlidgjRi9c\"}"
