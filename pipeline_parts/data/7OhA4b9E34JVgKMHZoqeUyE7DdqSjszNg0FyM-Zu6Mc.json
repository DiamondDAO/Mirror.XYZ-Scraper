"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"At the base of some lonely dunes, a building crumbled in the corner of a decaying parking lot.  Before the storm, the building had been a public restroom.  The road to the parking lot had yet to be repaired while the coast, left alone, welcomed the transition. \\n\\nHiking through this corridor, a hermit stumbled upon the building - an oblong square.  The remaining toilet flushed, the faucet let out water, and the holes in the walls looked like they could be repaired.  It seemed as if the building could become hospitable.  Within the hollowed room, the hermit’s sleeping gear was soon rolled out with a peaceful feeling of permanence. \\n\\nEbbing and flowing, the hermit’s days found rhythm as he strolled along the cold beach collecting driftwood - and, every once in a while, a shell.  In time, the walls of the hovel were lined with gnarled pieces of wood, an accidental puzzle lit at night, flickering to the tune of a bonfire.  \\n\\nEach night, sitting by the crackly pit, the hermit examined the scattered pieces of smooth wood and dreamed of finding worthy shells to fill the empty shelves.  In three seasons gone by, only two shells had been recognized as notable.  These shells defied perfection; they cracked beauty.  Each protected a story.   \\n\\nOne howling night as the hermit sat by the fire, he heard a persistent scratch at the door.  Curious, he made his way toward the disruption.  He opened the door only to see nothing.  The wind whistled with the splashing waves.  When he looked down, a naked hermit crab was looking up at him, shivering.  The crab scuttled between the hermit’s feet and scurried into the room, settling near the fire.  Not wanting to be a poor host, the hermit snatched a wool sock that was hanging on the wall and placed it carefully on the ground near the crab, who went face-first into the sock before wiggling around in the wool.  When the hermit was once again comfortably seated, he saw two bulging eyes and a pair of pinching claws poking out of the sock.\\n\\n“It’s brisk out there!  My claws won’t stop clacking.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nThe crab continued, “You haven’t had a guest in a while?”\\n\\n“Ummm… sorry, would you like some tea?”\\n\\n“How would I drink tea?  I suppose if you had a thimble I could sip it after it had cooled down enough not to cook me.  Do you have a thimble?”\\n\\n…\\n\\nThe crab continued, “Ah, how long have you been out here, alone?”\\n\\n“Several seasons.”\\n\\n“Are you enjoying the solitude?  I’ve never minded it.  You see, I was swimming in the tides one day, and then I got swept away.  A current carried me north to Nova Scotia, then east to some islands, and south down a warm coast.  The ocean took me where it pleased: across through the west and all the way to Indonesia.  Next, I drifted north over to Alaska and down a cold coast.”\\n\\n“Welcome to California.”\\n\\n“Are you bothered?  Speaking to a crab?” \\n\\n“I’m more curious as to how.”\\n\\n“In my experience, isolation finds conversation.”  \\n\\n…\\n\\nThe crab continued, “Would you like to help me with something?”\\n\\n“What’s the thing?”\\n\\n“I am looking for a shell.”\\n\\n“What kind of shell?”\\n\\n“A shell that suits me.  I would like to be comfortable.”\\n\\n“You may have come to the right place.  I’ve collected two shells in my several seasons here.  I’ve named them: *The History of the Color Blue* and *Ms. Mauve.*”\\n\\n“You’ve named them?”\\n\\nThe hermit strolled around the room and returned with the two shells, placing them on the hearth.  Entranced, the crab’s emerging eyes stared at a spiral.  A blue, submitted from the depths of a brooding ocean, seeped from one shell’s crown, diluting to an oyster white sky at the tip.  Interrupting the shift, a jagged grey stripe cut through the shell completely.\\n\\n“*The History of the Color Blue*, indeed.  Is it a broken shell that you put back together?”\\n\\n“Its story has yet to be finished.”\\n\\n“I’d rather another crab write its epilogue.”\\n\\n...\\n\\nThe crab continued, “What a mysterious pink.  What can you tell me about this other shell?”\\n\\n“*Ms. Mauve* has a private story.”\\n\\n*“*What’s the public story?”\\n\\n“The shell will welcome any tenant, and if you feel comfortable inside, you can write the next chapter.”\\n\\n“I don’t like to be constricted.”  \\n\\n“A frame can set you free.”\\n\\n“The majority of me would hang outside both of these frames.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nThe crab continued, “I expand beyond boundaries.  How could such shells ever contain me?”\\n\\n...\\n\\nCracking silence reentered the room. Reexamining the two shells, the hermit returned them to their places. Back in his space near the fire, staring into the flames, the hermit asked a question.\\n\\n“Do you want to stay here? We’ll search for a shell that suits you?”\\n\\n…\\n\\nThe crab had fallen asleep, buried within the sock.\",\"timestamp\":1641353929,\"title\":\"The Hermit and the Hermit Crab\"},\"digest\":\"wAToBozSnwR3t-yMS5wPZY0bBGrsC3s1B18i3YOHQZk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xF206B3B01c99660e43AA63a874D3785e343946E1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HcF116PzZ-fJcETxZhMk3X8BBqpLurS7WKCRMEWNtg8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"e4lf8uLROgKkBYSkUEiMxpLNxXMOTIuMBp935Hon6Bg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"bfKxzXZelPXkrdYErAHMVVXkbn6GcmjMlowVLeDD86c7giELblySUmny61XWAbZOwW0yMOEr7zJT36ibt98yow\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x560e1f82d0681d8816cbcc62d3fd439c42cac4a208f0732fe811d466605f8cea23491e4fd0d049a5482cab42c0c9231e6ef8a28a07802d6e9da595d0ca07ee781c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HcF116PzZ-fJcETxZhMk3X8BBqpLurS7WKCRMEWNtg8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"e4lf8uLROgKkBYSkUEiMxpLNxXMOTIuMBp935Hon6Bg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wAToBozSnwR3t-yMS5wPZY0bBGrsC3s1B18i3YOHQZk\"}"
