"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"that he had reached thus far in flight from the inconveniences of an imminent revolution; and that one hundred thousand dollars, government funds, which he carried with him in an American leather valise as a souvenir of his tempestuous administration, was never afterward recovered.\\n\\nFor a \\\\~real\\\\~, a boy will show you his grave.  It is back of the town near a little bridge that spans a mangrove swamp.  A plain slab of wood stands at its head.  Some one has burned upon the headstone with a hot iron this inscription:\\n\\nRAMON ANGEL DE LAS CRUZES     Y MIRAFLORES   PRESIDENTE DE LA REPUBLICA     DE ANCHURIA   QUE SEA SU JUEZ DIOS\\n\\nIt is characteristic of this buoyant people that they pursue no man beyond the grave.  \\\"Let God be his judge!\\\"--Even with the hundred thousand unfound, though they greatly coveted, the hue and cry went no further than that.\\n\\nTo the stranger or the guest the people of Coralio will relate the story of the tragic end of their former president; how he strove to escape from the country with the publice funds and also with Dona Isabel Guilbert, the young American opera singer; and how, being apprehended by members of the opposing political party in Coralio, he shot himself through the head rather than give up the funds, and, in consequence, the Senorita Guilbert.  They will relate further that Dona Isabel, her adventurous bark of fortune shoaled by the simultaneous loss of her distinguished admirer and the souvenir hundred thousand, dropped anchor on this stagnant coast, awaiting a rising tide.\\n\\nThey say, in Coralio, that she found a prompt and prosperous tide in the form of Frank Goodwin, an American resident of the town, an investor who had grown wealthy by dealing in the products of the country--a banana king, a rubber prince, a sarsaparilla, indigo and mahogany baron.  The Senorita Guilbert, you will be told, married Senor Goodwin one month after the president's death, thus, in the very moment when Fortune had ceased to smile, wresting from her a gift greater than the prize withdrawn.\\n\\nOf the American, Don Frank Goodwin, and of his wife the natives have nothing but good to say.  Don Frank has lived among them for years, and has compelled their respect.  His lady is easily queen of what social life the sober coast affords.  The wife of the governor of the district, herself, who was of the proud Castilian family of Monteleon y Dolorosa de los Santos y Mendez, feels honored to unfold her napkin with olive-hued, ringed hands at the table of Senora Goodwin.  Were you to refer (with your northern prejudices) to the vivacious past of Mrs. Goodwin when her audacious and gleeful abandon in light opera captured the mature president's fancy, or to her share in that statesman's downfall and malfeasance, the Latin shrug of the shoulder would be your only answer and rebuttal.  What prejudices there were in Coralio concerning Senora Goodwin seemed now to be in her favor, whatever they had been in the past.\\n\\nIt would seem that the story is ended, instead of begun; that the close of tragedy and the climax of a romance have covered the ground of interest; but, to the more curious reader it shall be some slight instruction to trace the close threads that underlie the ingenious web of circumstances.\\n\\nThe headpiece bearing the name of President Miraflores is daily scrubbed with soap-bark and sand.  An old half-breed Indian tends the grave with fidelity and the dawdling minuteness of inherited sloth. He chops down the weeds and ever-springing grass with his machete, he plucks ants and scorpions and beetles from it with his horny fingers, and sprinkles its turf with water from the plaza fountain.  There is no grave anywhere so well kept and ordered.\\n\\nOnly by following out the underlying threads will it be made clear why the old Indian, Galves, is secretly paid to keep green the grave of President Miraflores by one who never saw that unfortunate statesman in life or in death, and why that one was wont to walk in the twilight, casting from a distance looks of gentle sadness upon that unhonored mound.\\n\\nElsewhere than at Coralio one learns of the impetuous career of Isabel Guilbert.  New Orleans gave her birth and the mingled French and Spanish creole nature that tinctured her life with such turbulence and warmth.  She had little education, but a knowledge of men and motives that seemed to have come by instinct.  Far beyond the common woman was she endowed with intrepid rashness, with a love for the pursuit of adventure to the brink of danger, and with desire for the pleasures of life.  Her spirit was one to chafe under any curb; she was Eve after the fall, but before the bitterness of it was felt. She wore life as a rose in her bosom.\\n\\nOf the legion of men who had been at her feet it was said that but one was so fortunate as to engage her fancy.  To President Miraflores, the brilliant but unstable ruler of Anchuria, she yielded the key to her resolute heart.  How, then, do we find her (as the Coralians would have told you) the wife of Frank Goodwin, and happily living a life of dull and dreamy inaction?\\n\\nThe underlying threads reach far, stretching across the sea. Following them out it will be made plain why \\\"Shorty\\\" O'Day, of the Columbia Detective Agency, resigned his position.  And, for a lighter pastime, it shall be a duty and a pleasing sport to wander with Momus beneath the tropic stars where Melpomene once stalked austere.  Now to cause laughter to echo from those lavish jungles and frowing crags where formerly rang the cries of pirate's victims; to lay aside pike and cutlass and attack with quip and jollity; to draw one saving titter of mirth from the rusty casque of Romance--this were pleasant to do in the shade of the lemon-trees on that coast that is curved like lips set for smiling.\\n\\nFor there are yet tales of the Spanish Main.  That segment of continent washed by the tempestuous Caribbean, and presenting to the sea a formidable border of tropicle jungle topped by the overweening Cordilleras, is still begirt by mystery and romance.  In past times, buccaneers and revolutionists roused the echoes of its cliffs, and the condor wheeled perpetually above where, in the green groves, they made food for him with their matchlocks and toledos.  Taken and retaken by sea rovers, by adverse powers and by sudden uprising of rebellious factions, the historic 300 miles of adventurous coast has scarcely known for hundreds of years whom rightly to call its master. Pizarro, Balboa, Sir Francis Drake, and Bolivar did what they could to make it a part of Christendom.  Sir John Morgan, Lafitte and other eminent swashbucklers bombarded and pounded it in the name of Abaddon.\\n\\nThe game still goes on.  The guns of the rovers are silenced; but the tintype man, the enlarged photograph brigand, the kodaking tourist and the scouts of the gentle brigade of fakirs have found it out, and carry on the work.  The hucksters of Germany, France, and Sicily now bag in small change across their counters.  Gentlemen adventurers throng the waiting-rooms of its rulers with proposals for railways and concessions.  The little \\\\~opera-bouffe\\\\~ nations play at government and intrigue until some day a big, silent gunboat glides into the offing and warns them not to break their toys.  And with these changes comes also the small adventurer, with empty pockets to fill, light of heart, busy-brained--the modern fairy prince, bearing an alarm clock with which, more surely than by the sentimental kiss, to awaken the beautiful tropics from their centuries' sleep. Generally he wears a shamrock, which he matches pridefully against the extravagant palms; and it is he who had driven Melpomene to the wings, and set Comedy to dancing before the footlights of the Southern Cross.\\n\\nSo, there is a little tale to tell of many things.  Perhaps to the promiscuous ear of the Walrus it shall come with most avail; for in it there are indeed shoes and ships and sealing-wax and cabbage-palms and presidents instead of kings.\\n\\nAdd to these a little love and counterplotting, and scatter everywhere throughout the maze a trail of tropical dollars--dollars warmed no more by the torrid sun than by the hot palms of the scouts of Fortune--and, after all, here seems to be Life, itself, with talk enough to weary the most garrulous of Walruses.\\n\\nI\\n\\n\\\"Fox-in-the-Morning\\\"\\n\\nCoralio reclined, in the mid-day heat, like some vacuous beauty lounging in a guarded harem.  The town lay at the sea's edge on a strip of alluvial coast.  It was set like a little pearl in an emerald band.  Behind it, and seeming almost to topple, imminent, above it, rose the sea-following range of the Cordilleras.  In front the sea was spread, a smiling jailer, but even more incorruptible than the frowning mountains.  The waves swished along the smooth beach; the parrots screamed in the orange and ceiba-trees; the palms waved their limber fronds foolishly like an awkward chorus at the prima donna's cue to enter.\\n\\nSuddenly the town was full of excitement.  A native boy dashed down a grass-grown street, shrieking:  \\\"\\\\~Busca el Senor\\\\~ Goodwin.  \\\\~Ha venido un telegrafo por el!\\\\~\\\"\\n\\nThe word passed quickly.  Telegrams do not come to any one in Coralio.  The cry for Senor Goodwin was taken up by a dozen officious voices.  The main street running parallel to the beach became populated with those who desired to expedite the delivery of the dispatch.  Knots of women with complexions varying from palest olive to deepest brown gathered at street corners and plaintively carolled: \\\"\\\\~Un telegrafo por Senor\\\\~ Goodwin!\\\"  The \\\\~comandante\\\\~, Don Senor el Coronel Encarnacion Rios, who was loyal to the Ins and suspected Goodwin's devotion to the Outs, hissed:  \\\"Aha!\\\" and wrote in his secret memorandum book the accusive fact that Senor Goodwin had on that momentous date received a telegram.\\n\\nIn the midst of the hullabaloo a man stepped to the door of a small wooden building and looked out.  Above the door was a sign that read \\\"Keogh and Clancy\\\"--a nomenclature that seemed not to be indigenous to that tropical soil.  The man in the door was Billy Keogh, scout of fortune and progress and latter-day rover of the Spanish Main. Tintypes and photographs were the weapons with which Keogh and Clancy were at that time assailing the hopeless shores.  Outside the shop were set two large frames filled with specimens fo their art and skill.\\n\\nKeogh leaned in the doorway, his bold and humorous countenance wearing a look of interest at the unusual influx of life and sound in the street.  When the meaning of the disturbance became clear to him he placed a hand beside his mouth and shouted:  \\\"Hey! Frank!\\\" in such a robustious voice that the feeble clamor of the natives was drowned and silenced.\\n\\nFifty yards away, on the seaward side of the street, stood the abode of the consul for the United States.  Out from the door of this building tumbled Goodwin at the call.  He had been smoking with Willard Geddie, the consul, on the back porch of the consulate, which was conceded to be the coolest spot in Coralio.\\n\\n\\\"Hurry up,\\\" shouted Keogh.  \\\"There's a riot in town on account of a telegram that's come for you.  You want to be careful about these things, my boy.  It won't do to trifle with the feelings of the public this way.  You'll be getting a pink note some day with violet scent on it; and then the country'll be steeped in the throes of a revolution.\\\"\\n\\nGoodwin had strolled up the street and met the boy with the message. The ox-eyed women gazed at him with shy admiration, for his type drew them.  He was big, blond, and jauntily dressed in white linen, with buckskin \\\\~zapatos\\\\~.  His manner was courtly, with a merciful eye.  When the telegram had been delivered, and the bearer of it dismissed with a gratuity, the relieved populace returned to the contiguities of shade from which curiosity had drawn it--the women to their baking in the mud ovens under the orange-trees, or to the interminable combing of their long, straight hair; the men to their cigarettes and gossip in the cantinas.\\n\\nGoodwin sat on Keogh's doorstep, and read his telegram.  It was from Bob Englehart, an American, who lived in San Mateo, the capital city of Anchuria, eighty miles in the interior.  Englehart was a gold miner, an ardent revolutionist and \\\"good people.\\\"  That he was a man of resource and imagination was proven by the telegram he had sent. It had had been his task to send a confidential message to his friend in Coralio.  This could not have been accomplished in either Spanish or English, for the eye politic in Anchuria was an active one.  But Englehart was a diplomatist.  There existed but one code upon which he might make requisition with promise of safety--the great and potent code of Slang.  So, here is the message that slipped, unconstrued, through the fingers of curious officials, and came to the eye of Goodwin:\\n\\n\\\"His Nibs skedaddled yesterday per jack-rabbit line with all the   coin in the kitty and the bundle of muslin he's spoony about.  The   boodle is six figures short.  Our crowd in good shape, but we need   the spondulicks.  You collar it.  The main guy and the dry goods   are headed for the briny.  You to know what to do.\\n\\n```\\nBOB.\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThis screed, remarkable as it was, had no mystery for Goodwin. He was the most successful of the small advance-guard of speculative Americans that had invaded Anchuria, and he had not reached that enviable pinnacle without having well exercised the arts of foresight and deduction.  He had taken up political intrigue as a matter of business.  He was acute enough to wield a certain influence among the leading schemers, and he was prosperous enough to be able to purchase the respect of the petty-officeholders.  There was always a revolutionary party; and to it he had allied himself; for the adherents of a new administration received the rewards of their labors.  There was now a Liberal party seeking to overturn President Miraflores.  If the wheel successfully revolved, Goodwin stood to win a concession to 30,000 manzanas of the finest coffee lands in the interior.  Certain incidents in the recent career of President Miraflores had excited a shrewd suspicion in Goodwin's mind that the government was near a dissolution from another cause than that of a revolution, and now Englehart's telegram had come as a corroboration of his wisdom.\\n\\nThe telegram, which had remained unintelligible to the Anchurian linguists who had applied to it in vain their knowledge of Spanish and elemental English, conveyed a stimulating piece of news to Goodwin's understanding.  It informed him that the president of the republic had decamped from the capital city with the contents of the treasury.  Furthermore, that he was accompanied in his flight by that winning adventuress Isabel Guilbert, the opera singer, whose troupe of performers had been entertained by the president at San Mateo during the past month on a scale less modest than that with which royal visitors are often content.  The reference to the \\\"jackrabbit line\\\" could mean nothing else than the mule-back system of transport that prevailed between Coralio and the capital.  The hint that the \\\"boodle\\\" was \\\"six figures short\\\" made the condition of the national treasury lamentably clear.  Also it was convincingly true that the ingoing party--its way now made a pacific one--would need the \\\"spondulicks.\\\"  Unless its pledges should be fulfilled, and the spoils held for the delectation of the victors, precarious indeed, would be the position of the new government.  Therefore it was exceeding necessary to \\\"collar the main guy,\\\" and recapture the sinews of war and government.\\n\\nGoodwin handed the message to Keogh.\\n\\n\\\"Read that, Billy,\\\" he said.  \\\"It's from Bob Englehart.  Can you manage the cipher?\\\"\\n\\nKeogh sat in the other half of the doorway, and carefully perused the telegram.\\n\\n\\\"'Tis not a cipher,\\\" he said, finally.  \\\"'Tis what they call literature, and that's a system of language put in the mouths of people that they've never been introduced to by writers of imagination.  The magazines invented it, but I never knew before that President Norvin Green had stamped it with the seal of his approval. 'Tis now no longer literature, but language.  The dictionaries tried, but they couldn't make it go for anything but dialect.  Sure, now that the Western Union indorses it, it won't be long till a race of people will spring up that speaks it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You're running too much to philology, Billy,\\\" said Goodwin.  \\\"Do you make out the meaning of it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sure,\\\" replied the philosopher of Fortune.  \\\"All languages come easy to the man who must know 'em.  I've even failed to misunderstand an order to evacuate in classical Chinese when it was backed up by the muzzle of a breech-loader.  This little literary essay I hold in my hands means a game of Fox-in-the-Morning.  Ever play that, Frank, when you was a kid?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think so,\\\" said Goodwin, laughing.  \\\"You join hands all 'round, and--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You do not,\\\" interrupted Keogh.  \\\"You've got a fine sporting game mixed up in your head with 'All Around the Rosebush.'  The spirit of 'Fox-in-the-Morning' is opposed to the holding of hands.  I'll tell you how it's played.  This president man and his companion in play, they stand up over in San Mateo, ready for the run, and shout: \\\"Fox-in-the-Morning!'  Me and you, standing here, we say:  'Goose and Gander!'  They say:  'How many miles is it to London town?'  We say:  'Only a few, if your legs are long enough.  How many comes out?' They say:  'More than you're able to catch.'  And then the game commences.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I catch the idea,\\\" said Goodwin.  \\\"It won't do to let the goose and gander slip through your fingers, Billy; their feathers are too valuable.  Our crowd is prepared and able to step into the shoes of the government at once;  but with the treasury empty we'd stay in power about as long as a tenderfoot would stick on an untamed bronco.  We must play the fox on every foot of the coast to prevent their getting out of the country.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"By the mule-back schedule,\\\" said Keogh, \\\"it's five days down from San Mateo.  We've got plenty of time to set our outposts.  There's only three places on the coast where they can hope to sail from--here and Solitas and Alazan.  They're the only points we'll have to guard. It's as easy as a chess problem--fox to play, and mate in three moves.  Oh, goosey, goosey, gander, whither do you wander?  By the blessing of the literary telegraph the boodle of this benighted fatherland shall be preserved to the honest political party that is seeking to overthrow it.\\\"\\n\\nThe situation had been justly outlined by Keogh.  The down trail from the capital was at all times a weary road to travel.  A jiggety- joggety journey it was; ice-cold and hot, wet and dry.  The trail climbed appalling mountains, wound like a rotten string about the brows of breathless precipices, plunged through chilling snow-fed streams, and wriggled like a snake through sunless forests teeming with menacing insect and animal life.  After descending to the foothills it turned to a trident, the central prong ending at Alazan. Another branched off to Coralio; the third penetrated to Solitas. Between the sea and the foothills stretched the five miles breadth of alluvial coast.  Here was the flora ofthe tropics in its rankest and most prodigal growth.  Spaces here and there had been wrested from the jungle and planted with bananas and cane and orange groves. The rest was a riot of wild vegetation, the home of monkeys, tapirs, jaguars, alligators, and prodigious reptiles and insects.  Where no road was cut a serpent could scarcely make its way through the tangle of vines and creepers.  Across the treacherous mangrove swamps few things without wings could safely pass.  Therefore the fugitives could hope to reach the coast only by one of the routes named.\\n\\n\\\"Keep the matter quiet, Billy,\\\" advised Goodwin.  \\\"We don't want the Ins to know that the president is in flight.  I suppose Bob's information is something of a scoop in the capital as yet.  Otherwise he would not have tried to make his message a confidential one; and, besides, everybody would have heard the news.  I'm going around now to see Dr. Zavalla, and start a man up the trail to cut the telegraph wire.\\\"\\n\\nAs Goodwin rose, Keogh threw his hat upon the grass by the door and expelled a tremendous sigh.\\n\\n\\\"What's the trouble, Billy?\\\" asked Goodwin, pausing.  \\\"That's the first time I heard you sigh.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"'Tis the last,\\\" said Keogh.  \\\"With that sorrowful puff of wind I resign myself to a life of praiseworthy but harassing honesty. What are tintypes, if you please, to the opportunities of the great and hilarious class of ganders and geese?  Not that I would be a president, Frank--and the boodle he's got is too big for me to handle --but in some ways I feel my conscience hurting me for addicting myself to photographing a nation instead of running away with it. Frank, did you ever see the 'bundle of muslin' that His Excellency has wrapped up and carried off?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Isabel Guilbert?\\\" said Goodwin, laughing.  \\\"No, I never did.  From what I've heard of her, though, I imagine that she wouldn't stick at anything to carry her point.  Don't get romantic, Billy.  Sometimes I begin to fear that there's Irish blood in your ancestry.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I never saw her either,\\\" went on Keogh; \\\"but they say she's got all the ladies of mythology, sculpture, and fiction reduced to chromos. They say she can look at a man once, and he'll turn monkey and climb trees to pick coconuts for her.  Think of that president man with Lord know how many hundreds of thousands of dollars in one hand, and this muslin siren in the other, galloping down the hill on a sympathetic mule amid songbirds and flowers!  And here is Billy Keogh, because he is virtuous, condemned to the unprofitable swindle of slandering the faces of missing links on tin for an honest living! 'Tis an injustice of nature.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Cheer up,\\\" said Goodwin.  \\\"You are a pretty poor fox to be envying a gander.  Maybe the enchanting Guilbert will take a fancy to you and your tintypes after we impoverish her royal escort.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She could do worse,\\\" reflected Keogh; \\\"but she won't.  'Tis not a tintype gallery, but a gallery of the gods that she's fitted to adorn.  She's a very wicked lady, and the president man is in luck. But I hear Clancy swearing in the back room for having to do all the work.\\\"  And Keogh plunged for the rear of the \\\"gallery,\\\" whistling gaily in a spontaneous way that belied his recent sigh over the questionable good luck of the flying president.\\n\\nGoodwin turned from the main street into a much narrower one that intersected it at a right angle.\\n\\nThese side streets were covered by a growth of thick, rank grass, which was kept to a navigable shortness by the machetes of the police.  Stone sidewalks, little more than a ledge in width, ran along the base of the mean and monotonous adobe houses.  At the outskirts of the village these streets dwindled to nothing; and here were set the palm-thatched huts of the Caribs and the poorer natives, and the shabby cabins of negroes from Jamaica and the West India islands.  A few structures raised their heads above the red-tiled roofs of the one-story houses--the bell tower of the \\\\~Calaboza\\\\~, the Hotel de los Extranjeros, the residence of the Vesuvius Fruit Company's agent, the store and residence of Bernard Brannigan, a ruined cathedral in which Columbus had once set foot, and, most imposing of all, the Casa Morena--the summer \\\"White House\\\" of the President of Anchuria.  On the principal street running along the beach--the Broadway of Coralio--were the larger stores, the government \\\\~bodega\\\\~ and post-office, the \\\\~cuartel\\\\~, the rum-shops and the market place.\\n\\nOn his way Goodwin passed the house of Bernard Brannigan.  It was a modern wooden building, two stories in height.  The ground floor was occupied by Brannigan's store, the upper one contained the living apartments.  A wide cool porch ran around the house half way up its outer walls.  A handsome, vivacious girl neatly dressed in flowing white leaned over the railing and smiled down upon Goodwin.  She was no darker than many an Andalusian of high descent; and she sparkled and glowed like a tropical moonlight.\\n\\n\\\"Good evening, Miss Paula,\\\" said Goodwin, taking off his hat, with his ready smile.  There was little difference in his manner whether he addressed women or men.  Everybody in Coralio liked to receive the salutation of the big American.\\n\\n\\\"Is there any news, Mr. Goodwin?  Please don't say no.  Isn't it warm?  I feel just like Mariana in her moated grange--or was it a range?--it's hot enough.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, there's no news to tell, I believe,\\\" said Goodwin, with a mischievous look in his eye, \\\"except that old Geddie is getting grumpier and crosser every day.  If something doesn't happen to relieve his mind I'll have to quit smoking on his back porch--and there's no other place available that is cool enough.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He isn't grumpy,\\\" said Paula Brannigan, impulsively, \\\"when he--\\\"\\n\\nBut she ceased suddenly, and drew back with a deepening color; for her mother had been a \\\\~mestizo\\\\~ lady, and the Spanish blood had brought to Paula a certain shyness that was an adornment to the other half of her demonstrative nature.\\n\\nII\\n\\nThe Lotus And The Bottle\\n\\nWillard Greddie, consul for the United States in Coralio, was working leisurely on his yearly report.  Goodwin, who had strolled in as he did daily for a smoke on the much coveted porch, had found him so absorbed in his work that he departed after roundly abusing the consul for his lack of hospitality.\\n\\n\\\"I shall complain to the civil service department,\\\" said Goodwin;-- \\\"or is it a department?--perhaps it's only a theory.  One gets neither civility nor service from you.  You won't talk; and you won't set out anything to drink.  What kind of a way is that of representing your government?\\\"\\n\\nGoodwin strolled out and across to the hotel to see if he could bully the quarantine doctor into a game on Coralio's solitary billiard table.  His plans were completed for the interception of the fugitives from the capital; and now it was but a waiting game that he had to play.\\n\\nThe consul was interested in his report.  He was only twenty-four; and he had not been in Coralio long enough for his enthusiasm to cool in the heat of the tropics--a paradox that may be allowed between Cancer and Capricorn.\\n\\nSo many thousand bunches of bananas, so mnay thousand oranges and coconuts, so many ounces of gold dust, pounds of rubber, coffee, indigo and sarparilla--actually, exports were twenty per cent greater than for the previous year!\\n\\nA little thrill of satisfaction ran through the consul.  Perhaps, he thought, the State Department, upon reading his introduction, would notice--and then he leaned back in his chair and laughed. He was getting as bad as the others.  For the moment he had forgotten that Coralio was an insignificant republic lying along the by-ways of a second-rate sea.  He thought of Gregg, the quarantine doctor, who subscribed for the London \\\\~Lancet\\\\~, expecting to find it quoting his reports to the home Board of Health concerning the yellow fever germ.  The consul knew that not one in fifty of his acquaintances in the States had ever heard of Coralio.  He knew that two men, at any rate, would have to read his report--some underling in the State Department and a compositor in the Public Printing Office.  Perhaps the typesticker would note the increase of commerce in Coralio, and speak of it, over the cheese and beer, to a friend.\\n\\nHe had just written:  \\\"Most unaccountable is the supineness of the large exporters in the United States in permitting the French and German houses to practically control the trade interests of this rich and productive country\\\"--when he heard the hoarse notes of a steamer's siren.\\n\\nGeddie laid down his pen and gathered his Panama hat and umbrella. By the sound he knew it to be the \\\\~Valhalla\\\\~, one of the line of fruit vessels plying for the Vesuvius Company.  Down to \\\\~ninos\\\\~ of five years, every one in Coralio could name you each incoming steamer by the note of her siren.\\n\\nThe consul sauntered by a roundabout, shaded way to the beach. By reason of long practice he gauged his stroll so accurately that by the time he arrived on the sandy shore the boat of the customs officials was rowing back from the steamer, which had been boarded and inspected according to the laws of Anchuria.\\n\\nThere is no harbor at Coralio.  Vessels of the draught of the \\\\~Valhalla\\\\~ must ride at anchor a mile from shore.  When they take on fruit it is conveyed on lighters and freighter sloops.  At Solitas, where there was a fine harbor, ships of many kinds were to be seen, but in the roadstead off Coralio scarcely any save the fruiters paused.  Now and then a tramp coaster, or a mysterious brig from Spain, and then a tramp coaster, or a mysterious brig from Spain, or a saucy French barque would hang innocently for a few days in the offing.  Then the custom-house crew would become doubly vigilant and wary.  At night a sloop or two would be making strange trips in and out along the shore; and in the morning the stock of Three-Star Hennessey, wines and drygoods in Coralio would be found vastly increased.  It has also been said that the customs officials jingled more silver in the pockets of their red-striped trousers, and that the record books showed no increase in import duties received.\\n\\nThe custom's boat and the \\\\~Valhalla\\\\~ gig reached the shore at the same time.  When they grounded in the shallow water there was still five yards of rolling surf between them and dry sand.  Then half- clothed Caribs dashed into the water, and brought in on their backs the \\\\~Valhalla's\\\\~ purser, and the little native officials in their cotton undershirts, blue trousers with red stripes, and flapping straw hats.\\n\\nAt college Geddie had been a treasure as a first-baseman.  He now closed his umbrella, stuck it upright in the sand, and stooped, with his hands resting upon his knees.  The purser, burlesquing the pitcher's contortions, hurled at the consul the heavy roll of newspapers, tied with a string, that the steamer always brought for him.  Geddie leaped high and caught the roll with a sounding \\\"thwack.\\\" The loungers on the beach--about a third of the population of the town--laughed and applauded delightedly.  Every week they expected to see that roll of papers delivered and received in that same manner, and they were never disappointed.  Innovations did not flourish in Coralio.\\n\\nThe consul re-hoisted his umbrella and walked back to the consulate.\\n\\nThis home of a great nation's representative was a wooden structure of two rooms, with a native-built gallery of poles, bamboo and nipa palm running on three sides of it.  One room was the official apartment, furnished chastely with a flat-top desk, a hammock, and three uncomfortable cane-seated chairs.  Engravings of the first and latest president of the country represented hung against the wall. The other room was the consul's living apartment.\\n\\nIt was eleven o'clock when he returned from the beach, and therefore breakfast time.  Chanca, the Carib woman who cooked for him, was just serving the meal on the side of the gallery facing the sea--a spot famous as the coolest in Coralio.  The breakfast consisted of shark's fin soup, stew of land crabs, breadfruit, a boiled iguana steak, aquacates, a freshly cut pineapple, claret and coffee.\\n\\nGeddie took his seat, and unrolled with luxurious laziness his bundle of newspapers.  Here in Coralio for two days or longer he would read the goings-on in the world very much as we of the world read those whimsical contributions to inexact science that assume to portray the doings of the Martians.  After he had finished with the papers they would be sent on the rounds of the other English-speaking residents of the town.\\n\\nThe paper that came first to his hand was one of those bulky mattresses of printed stuff upon which the readers of certain New York journals are supposed to take their Sabbath literary nap. Opening this the consul rested it upon the table, supporting its weight with the aid of the back of a chair.  Then he partook of his meal deliberately, turning the leaves from time to time and glancing half idly at the contents.\\n\\nPresently he was struck by something familiar to him in a picture-- a half-page, badly printed reproduction of a photograph of a vessel. Languidly interested, he leaned for a nearer scrutiny and a view of the florid headlines of the column next to the picture.\\n\\nYes; he was not mistaken.  The engraving was of the eight-hundred-ton yacht \\\\~Idalia\\\\~, belonging to \\\"that prince of good fellows, Midas of the money market, and society's pink of perfection, J. Ward Tolliver.\\\"\\n\\nSlowly sipping his black coffee, Geddie read the column of print. Following a listed statement of Mr. Tolliver's real estate and bonds, came a description of the yacht's furnishings, and then the grain of news no bigger than a mustard seed.  Mr. Tolliver, with a party of favored guests, would sail the next day on a six weeks' cruise along the Central American and South American coasts and among the Bahama Islands.  Among the guests were Mrs. Cumberland Payne and Miss Ida Payne, of Norfolk.\\n\\nThe writer, with the fatuous presumption that was demanded of him by his readers, had concocted a romance suited to their palates. He bracketed the names of Miss Payne and Mr. Tolliver until he had well-nigh read the marriage ceremony over them.  He played coyly and insinuatingly upon the strings of \\\"\\\\~on dit\\\\~\\\" and \\\"Madame Rumor\\\" and \\\"a little bird\\\" and \\\"no one would be surprised,\\\" and ended with congratulations.\\n\\nGeddie, having finished his breakfast, took his papers to the edge of the gallery, and sat there in his favorite steamer chair with his feet on the bamboo railing.  He lighted a cigar, and looked out upon the sea.  He felt a glow of satisfaction at finding he was so little disturbed by what he had read.  He told himself that he had conquered the distress that had sent him, a voluntary exile, to this far land of the lotus.  He could never forget Ida, of course; but there was no longer any pain in thinking about her.  When they had had that misunderstanding and quarrel he had impulsively sought this consulship, with the desire to retaliate upon her by detaching himself from her world and presence.  He had succeeded thoroughly in that.  During the twelve months of his life in Coralio no word had passed between them, though he had sometimes heard of her through the dilatory correspondence with the few friends to whom he still wrote. Still he could not repress a little thrill of satisfaction at knowing that she had not yet married Tolliver or any one else.  But evidently Tolliver had not yet abandoned hope.\\n\\nWell, it made no difference to him now.  He had eaten of the lotus. He was happy and content in this land of perpetual afternoon.  Those old days of life in the States seemed like an irritating dream.  He hoped Ida would be as happy as he was.  The climate as balmy as that of distant Avalon; the fetterless, idyllic round of enchanted days; the life among this indolent, romantic people--a life full of music, flowers, and low laughter; the influence of the imminent sea and mountains, and the many shapes of love and magic and beauty that bloomed in the white tropic nights--with all he was more than content.  Also, there was Paula Brannigan.\\n\\nGeddie intended to marry Paula--if, of course, she would consent; but he felt rather sure that she would do that.  Somehow, he kept postponing his proposal.  Several times he had been quite near to it; but a mysterious something always held him back.  Perhaps it was only the unconscious, instinctive conviction that the act would sever the last tie that bound him to his old world.\\n\\nHe could be very happy with Paula.  Few of the native girls could be compared with her.  She had attended a convent school in New Orleans for two years; and when she chose to display her accomplishments no one could detect any difference between her and the girls of Norfolk and Manhattan.  But it was delicious to see her at home dressed, as she sometimes was, in the native costume, with bare shoulders and flowing sleeves.\\n\\nBernard Brannigan was the great merchant of Coralio.  Besides his store, he maintained a train of pack mules, and carried on a lively trade with the interior towns and villages.  He had married a native lady of high Castilian descent, but with a tinge of Indian brown showing through her olive cheek.  The union of the Irish and the Spanish had produced, as it so often has, an offshoot of rare beauty and variety.  They were very excellent people indeed, and the upper story of the house was ready to be placed at the service of Geddie and Paula as soon as he should make up his mind to speak about it.\\n\\nBy the time two hours were whiled away the consul tired of reading. The papers lay scattered about him on the gallery.  Reclining there, he gazed dreamily out upon an Eden.  A clump of banana plants interposed their broad shields between him and the sun.  The gentle slope from the consulate to the sea was covered with the dark-green foliage of lemon-trees and orange-trees just bursting into bloom. A lagoon pierced the land like a dark, jagged crystal, and above it a pale ceiba-tree rose almost to the clouds.  The waving coconut palms on the beach flared their decorative green leaves against the slate of an almost quiescent sea.  His senses were cognizant of brilliant scarlet and ochres and the vert of the coppice, of odors of fruit and bloom and the smoke from Chanca's clay oven under the calabash-tree; of the treble laughter of the native women in their huts, the song of the robin, the salt taste of the breeze, the diminuendo of the faint surf running along the shore--and, gradually, of a white speck, growing to a blur, that intruded itself upon the drab prospect of the sea.\\n\\nLazily interested, he watched this blur increase until it became the \\\\~Idalia\\\\~ steaming at full speed, coming down the coast.  Without changing his position he kept his eyes upon the beautiful white yacht as she drew swiftly near, and came opposite to Coralio.  Then, sitting upright, he saw her float steadily past and on.  He had seen the frequent splash of her polished brass work and the stripes of her deck-awnings--so much, and no more.  Like a ship on a magic lantern slide the \\\\~Idalia\\\\~ had crossed the illuminated circle of the consul's little world, and was gone.  Save for the tiny cloud of smoke that was left hanging over the brim of the sea, she might have been an immaterial thing, a chimera of his idle brain.\\n\\nGeddie went into his office and sat down to dawdle over his report. If the reading of the article in the paper had left him unshaken, this silent passing of the \\\\~Idalia\\\\~ had done for him still more. It had brought the calm and peace of a situation from which all uncertainty had been erased.  He knew that men sometimes hope without being aware of it.  Now, since she had come two thousand miles and had passed without a sign, not even his unconscious self need cling to the past any longer.\\n\\nAfter dinner, when the sun was low behind the mountains, Geddie walked on the little strip of beach under the coconuts.  The wind was blowing mildly landward, and the surface of the sea was rippled by tiny wavelets.\",\"timestamp\":1641298413,\"title\":\"\\nThey will tell you in Anchuria, that President Miraflores, of that volatile republic, died by his own hand \"},\"digest\":\"ywkFrV1XzDCXUzqswaPkvqywV6s227yqdSwWfxfoXjY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x81227527cbBb507F7E0b85be26187C02C5D953E3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ypyLwABFHonaGYvG82w04ARmpsw4XQEWLZjj7cuAcxw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Nl-7qdJLgW45vcHkb-R02oCyo-tAPIX_0IwU9qZqhJ4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"SK5zQgaPZENi_O8CeiLvBlpnRuqotxoHHjHVc3ao4fXtljRbyxicwS-Ed9EUhw2hL_SQXzufz1xRtmgDjLNYEw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x80ec7d3414d0503d526f33d82cf2951e85ce3f511713fec0ef35d0d70483a3dd4f2c796935df29e963d886df6a1b5a4423c8907bb74925f75b0a63cee8e4628c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ypyLwABFHonaGYvG82w04ARmpsw4XQEWLZjj7cuAcxw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Nl-7qdJLgW45vcHkb-R02oCyo-tAPIX_0IwU9qZqhJ4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ywkFrV1XzDCXUzqswaPkvqywV6s227yqdSwWfxfoXjY\"}"
