Particularly, in October 2016 Vitalik Buterin proposed building on-chain Constant Product Market Maker **to resolve the high spread inherent in trading the coins back in the days.** What originally caused the high spread is the **inconvenience of market making on-chain due to high gas cost of creating and removing orders.**\\n\\nNamely, running an order book on chain requires gas fee payment anytime any type of order is set, resulting in too costly trading experience. Consequently, on-chain order books struggle to provide enough depth, causing a high spread / illiquidity.\\n\\nOn the other hand, **the simple formula proposed by Vitalik guarantees liquidity no matter the price range**, enabling users to execute their trades instantaneously. However, **the execution quality depends on the depth of liquidity pools**, where the more deposited assets imply the better execution quality (i.e. lower slippage).\\n\\nTo ensure the deeper liquidity pools, AMMs have been offering incentives such as ‚Äúyield farming‚Äù that attracted assets worth millions of dollars to AMMs‚Äô pools. Nevertheless, the **depositors quickly realized that, often, holding the tokens in their wallets might be more lucrative than providing liquidity to AMMs.** This issue has later been coined as Impermanent Loss.\\n\\nIn more detail, AMMs rely on arbitrageurs to adjust the ratio of reserves in the pool so that AMM-given price is aligned with the external market price. However, **arbitrage profit goes at the expense of liquidity providers, creating loss for LPs.** The loss can disappear only if the prices return to the initial ratio, which is why it is defined as impermanent. However, the volatile nature of crypto assets, generally, makes the loss permanent.\\n\\nThe Bancor has simply explained the impermanent loss using the figure below. They compare LP portfolio and HODLer portfolio ( HODL ‚Äî hold on for dear life). For simplicity the example assumes there are no transaction fees. **Whenever the relative price of deposited tokens changes HODLer position is more favorable than LP position due to the arbitrage effect discussed above**. This effect is a problem that CPMM and CMMM in the simplest form cannot resolve.\\n\\n![Impermanent Loss Example; Source: Bancor](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8xv5o9TZnjGWGAEeefuxS.png?height=693&width=679)\\n\\na. **Focusing on less volatile assets** -> marginal chance of impermanent loss\\n\\nSince impermanent loss is closely connected with asset volatility, the simplest way to resolve it is by ignoring volatile assets. Curve.fi focuses on stablecoin swaps, which is why impermanent loss is much less of a concern for Curve‚Äôs LPs. The concern for LPs remains only if one of the coins loses its peg.\\n\\nb. **Leveraging an oracle to achieve ‚Äúfairer‚Äù prices**\\n\\nRather than relying on arbitrage to coordinate AMM prices with market prices, Bancor utilizes Chainlink oracles. The weights of each asset in the pool is adjusted based on the oracle price update, simultaneously exterminating arbitrage opportunity and protecting the value for liquidity providers.\\n\\n*Bancor v1*\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zCIy0lh0kmsFg3YCa4a7U.png?height=379&width=960)\\n\\n*Bancor v2*\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TgsvMyUTdmHGR8oeZpFAk.png?height=364&width=958)\\n\\nDODO implements a similar solution, however, both DODO and Bancor v2 are still in an early-stage and are yet to prove that constant dependency on oracle could serve as a robust solution. **The concern comes from the risk of oracle failure and the arbitrage being faster than the price feed simultaneously generating a substantial loss for LPs.** Nevertheless, if these risks are successfully controlled, LPs would find liquidity provision to this type of protocols extremely attractive, potentially making them another DeFi hot topic.\\n\\n# üê±‚ÄçüêâIndustry\\n\\n**yearn community proposed to bolt a CFAMM facility to the Y pool,** in order to minimise governance risk.
