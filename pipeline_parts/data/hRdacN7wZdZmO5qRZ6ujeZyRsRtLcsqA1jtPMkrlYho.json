What is Avalanche? And why is it so fast?\\n\\nTop 14 answers from [Knox.Market](https://Knox.Market):\\n\\nAvalanche is fast because it takes advantage of the revolutionary Avalanche Consensus protocols.\\n\\nA platform of platforms, enabling anyone to create tailor-made application specific blockchains and benefit from Avalanche consensus.\\n\\nAvalanche is the fastest smart contracts platform in the blockchain industry, as measured by time-to-finality.\\n\\nAvalanche is an open, programmable smart contracts platform for decentralized applications.\\n\\nC-Chain is where developers can create smart contracts for DApps, P-chain coordinates network validators, tracks anc create new subnets\\n\\nAvalanche is a new platform developed by Ava Labs that allows anybody to easily produce their own multi-functional blockchains and dApps.\\n\\nX-Chain is secured by the DAG-optimized 'Avalanche' consensus—a secure and scalable protocol that can achieve transaction finality in seconds.\\n\\nSnowman consensus protocol, dual consensus, validate transactions by directed acyclic graph (DAG) optimized consensus protocol\\n\\nAvalanche is designed to address some of the limitations of older blockchain platforms, including slow transaction speeds, centralization, and scalability.\\n\\nP-Chain and C-Chain are secured by the chain optimized 'Snowman' consensus, helping to enable high throughput secure smart contracts.\\n\\nAvalanche Virtual Machines (VMs) enable developers to easily launch blockchains with a wide array of application-specific features.\\n\\nAVAX, the native utility token is used for paying network fees, staking, and as a \\\"basic unit of account\\\" between Avalanche subnets.\\n\\nBy having a validator perform repeated random subsampling, participants in Avalanche build confidence.\\n\\nAvalanche is a deflationary blockchain. The network collects fees from various actions and then sends these coins to be burned.\\n\\n\\\\[Want more insights?
