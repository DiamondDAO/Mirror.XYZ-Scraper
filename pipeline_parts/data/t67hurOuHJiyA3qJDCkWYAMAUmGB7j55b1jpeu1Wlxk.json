"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I fear I made but little progress during the three years that I remained at the High School.  Had the master explained to us how nearly allied many of the Latin and Greek roots were to our familiar English words, I feel assured that so interesting and valuable a department of instruction would not have been neglected.  But our memories were strained by being made to say off \\\"by heart,\\\" as it was absurdly called, whole batches of grammatical rules, with all the botheration of irregular verbs and suchlike.  So far as I was concerned, I derived little benefit from my High School teaching, except that I derived one lesson which is of great use in after life. I mean as regards the performance of duty.  I did my tasks punctually and cheerfully, though they were far from agreeable.  This is an exercise in early life that is very useful in later years.\\n\\nIn my walks to and from the High School, the usual way was along the North and South Bridges,--the first over the Nor' Loch, now the railway station, and the second over the Cowgate.  That was the main street between the Old Town and the New.  But there were numerous wynds and closes (as the narrow streets are called) which led down from the High Street and the upper part of the Canongate to the High School, through which I often preferred to wander.  So long as Old Edinburgh was confined within its walls the nobles lived in those narrow streets; and the Old houses are full of historical incident. My father often pointed out these houses to me, and I loved to keep up my recollections.  I must have had a little of the antiquarian spirit even then.  I got to know the most remarkable of those ancient houses--many of which were distinguished by the inscriptions on the lintel of the entrance, as well as the arms of the former possessors. Some had mottoes such as this: \\\"BLESIT BE GOD AND HYS GIFTIS. 1584.\\\" There was often a tower-shaped projection from the main front of the house, up which a spiral stair proceeded.\\n\\nThis is usually a feature in old Scotch buildings.  But in these closes the entrance to the houses was through a ponderous door, studded with great broad-headed nails, with loopholes at each side of the door, as if to present the strongest possible resistance to any attempt at forcible entrance.  Indeed, in the old times before the Union the nobles were often as strong as the King, and many a time the High Street was reddened by the blood of the noblest and bravest of the land. In 1588 there was a cry of \\\"A Naesmyth,\\\" \\\"A Scott,\\\" in the High Street. It was followed by a clash of arms, and two of Sir Michael Naesmyth's sons were killed in that bloody feud.  Edinburgh was often the scene of such disasters.  Hence the strengthening of their houses, so as to resist the inroads of feudal enemies.\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  Doorhead, from an old mansion\\n\\nThe mason-work of the doors was executed with great care and dexterity. It was chamfered at the edges in a bold manner, and ornamented with an O.G. bordering, which had a fine effect while it rendered the entrance more pleasant by the absence of sharp angles.  The same style of ornamentation was generally found round the edges of the stone-work of the windows, most commonly by chamfering off the square angle of the stone-work.  This not only added a grim grace to the appearance of the windows, but allowed a more free entrance of light into the apartments, while it permitted the inmates to have a better ranged view up and down the Close.  These gloomy-looking mansions were grim in a terrible sense, and they reminded one of the fearful transactions of \\\"the good old times!\\\"\\n\\nOn many occasions, when I was taking a daunder through these historic houses in the wynds and closes of the Old Town, I have met Sir Walter Scott showing them to his visitors, and listened to his deep, earnest voice while narrating to them some terrible incident in regard to their former inhabitants.  On other occasions I have frequently met Sir Walter sturdily limping along over the North Bridge, while on his way from the Court of Session (where he acted as Clerk of the Records) to his house in Castle Street.  In the same way I saw most of the public characters connected with the Law Courts or the University.  Sir Waiter was easily distinguished by his height, as well as his limp or halt in his walk. My father was intimate with most, if not all, of the remarkable Edinburgh characters, and when I had the pleasure of accompanying him in his afternoon walks I could look at them and hear them in the conversations that took place.\\n\\nI remember, when I was with my father in one of his walks, that a young English artist accompanied us.  He had come across the Border to be married at Gretna Green, and he brought his bride onward to Edinburgh.  My father wished to show him some of the most remarkable old buildings of the town.  It was about the end of 1817, when one of the most interesting buildings in Edinburgh was about to be demolished.  This was no less a place than the Old Tolbooth in the High Street,--a grand but gloomy old building.  It had been originally used as the city palace of the Scottish kings.  There they held their councils and dispensed justice.  But in course of time the King and Court abandoned the place, and it had sunk into a gaol or prison for the most abandoned of malefactors.  After their trial the prisoners were kept there waiting for execution, and they were hanged on a flat-roofed portion of the building at its west end.\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  The Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh.  By Alexander Nasmyth.          From the drawing in the possession of lord Inglis,          Lord Justice-General.\\n\\nAt one of the strongest parts of the building a strong oak chest, iron-plated, had been built in, held fast by a thick wall of stone and mortar on each side.  The iron chest measured about nine feet square, and was closed by a strong iron door with heavy bolts and locks.  This was the Heart of Midlothian, the condemned cell of the Tolbooth.\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... Long after the condemned cell had been pulled down, an English Chartist went down to Edinburgh to address a large meeting of his brother politicians.  He began by addressing them as \\\"Men of the Heart of Midlothian!\\\"  There was a loud guffaw throughout the audience. He addressed them as if they were a body of condemned malefactors.  ...\\\\]\\n\\nThe iron chest was so heavy that the large body of workmen could not, with all their might, pull it out.  After stripping it of its masonry, they endeavoured by strong levers to tumble it down into the street. At last, with a \\\"Yo! heave ho!\\\" it fell down with a mighty crash.\\n\\nThe iron chest was so strong that it held together, and only the narrow iron door, with its locks, bolts, and bars, was burst open, and jerked off amongst the bystanders.\\n\\nIt was quite a scene.  A large crowd had assembled, and amongst them was Sir Walter Scott.  Recognising my father, he stood by him, while both awaited the ponderous crash.  Sir Walter was still the Great Unknown.  When his Heart of Midlothian was published in the course of the following year, it was pretty well known that he was the author of that fascinating novel.  Sir Waiter got the door and the key, as relics, for his house at Abbotsford.\\n\\nThere was a rush of people towards the iron chest to look into the dark interior of that veritable chamber of horrors.  My father's artist friend went forward with the rest, and endeavoured to pick up some remnant of the demolished structure.  As soon as the clouds of dust had been dispersed, he observed, under the place where the iron box had stood, a number of skeletons of rats, as dry as mummies.  He selected one of these,\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... I was so much impressed with the events of the day, and also with the fact of the young artist having taken with him so repulsive a memento as a rat's skeleton, that I never forgot it.  More than half century later, when I was at a private view of the Royal Academy, I saw sitting on one of the sofas a remarkable and venerable-looking old gentleman. On inquiring of my friend Thomas Webster who he was, he answered, \\\"Why, that's old Linnell!\\\"  I then took the liberty of sitting down beside him, and, apologising for my intrusion on his notice, I said it was just fifty-seven years since I had last seen him!  I mentioned the circumstance of the rat-skeleton which he had put in his pocket at Edinburgh.  He was pleased and astonished to have the facts so vividly recalled to his mind.  At last he said, \\\"Well, I have that mummy rat, the relic of the Heart of Midlothian, safe in a cabinet of curiosities in my house at Redhill to this day.\\\"  ...\\\\] wrapped it in a newspaper and put it in his pocket as a recollection of his first day in Edinburgh, and of the final destruction of the \\\"Heart of Midlothian.\\\"  This artist was no other than John Linnell, the afterwards famous landscape painter.  He was then a young and unknown man.  He brought a letter of introduction to my father. He also brought a landscape as a specimen of his young efforts, and it was so splendidly done that my father augured a brilliant career for this admirable artist.\\n\\nI had the pleasure of seeing Sir Waiter Scott on another and, to me, a very memorable occasion.  From an early period of my schoolboy days I had a great regard for every object that had reference to bygone times. They influenced my imagination, and conjured up in my mind dreamy visions of the people of olden days.  It did not matter whether it was an old coin or an old castle.  took pleasure in rambling about the old castles near Edinburgh, many of them connected with the times of Mary Queen of Scots.  Craigmillar Castle was within a few miles of the city; there was also Crighton Castle, and above all Borthwick Castle. This grand massive old ruin left a deep impression on my mind. The sight of its gloomy interior, with the great hall lighted up only by stray glints of sunshine, as if struggling for access through the small deep-seated windows in its massive walls, together with its connection with the life and times of Queen Mary, had a far greater influence upon my mind than I experienced while standing amidst the Coliseum at Rome.\\n\\nLike many earnest-minded boys, I had a severe attack at the right time of life, say from 12 to 15, of what I would call \\\"the collecting period.\\\" This consisted, in my case, of accumulating old coins, perhaps one of the most salutary forms of this youthful passion.  I made exchanges with my school companions.  Sometimes my father's friends, seeing my anxiety to improve my collection gave me choice specimens of bronze and other coins of the Roman emperors, usually duplicates from their own collection.\\n\\nThese coins had the effect of promoting my knowledge of Roman history. I read up in order to find out the acts and deeds of the old rulers of the civilised world.  Besides collecting the coins, I used to make careful drawings of the obverse and reverse faces of each in an illustrated catalogue which I kept in my little coin cabinet.\\n\\nI remember one day, when sitting beside my father making a very careful drawing of a fine bronze coin of Augustus, that Sir Walter Scott entered the room.  He frequently called upon my father in order to consult him with respect to his architectural arrangements.  Sir Walter caught sight of me, and came forward to look over the work I was engaged in.  At his request I had the pleasure of showing him my little store of coin treasures, after which he took out of his waistcoat pocket a beautiful silver coin of the reign of Mary Queen of Scots, and gave it to me as being his \\\"young brother antiquarian.\\\"  I shall never forget the kind fatherly way in which he presented it. I considered it a great honour to be spoken to in so friendly a way by such a man; besides, it vastly enriched my little collection of coins and medals.\\n\\nIt was in the year 1817 that I had the pleasure, never to be forgotten, of seeing the great engineer, James Watt.  He was then close upon his eighty-second year.  His visit to Edinburgh was welcomed by the most distinguished scientific and literary men of the city.  My father had the honour of meeting him at a dinner given by the Earl of Buchan, at his residence in George Street.  There were present, Sir James Hall, President of the Royal Society; Francis Jeffrey, Editor of the Edinburgh Review; Walter Scott, still the Great Unknown; and many other distinguished notabilities.  The cheerful old man delighted them with his kindly talk, as well as astonished them with the extent and profundity of his information.\\n\\nOn the following day Mr. Watt paid my father a visit he carefully examined his artistic and other works.  Having inspected with great pleasure some landscape paintings of various scenes in Scotland executed by my sisters, who were then highly efficient artists, he purchased a specimen of each, as well as three landscapes painted by my father, as a record of his pleasant visit to the capital of his native country.  I well remember the sight I then got of the Great Engineer.  I had just returned from the High School when he was leaving my father's house.  It was but a glimpse I had of him.  But his benevolent countenance and his tall but bent figure made an impression on my mind that I can never forget.  It was even something to have seen for a few seconds so truly great and noble a man.\\n\\nI did not long continue my passion for the collection of coins, I felt a greater interest in mechanical pursuits.  I have a most cherished and grateful remembrance of the happy hours and days that I spent in my father's workroom.  When the weather was cold or wet ,he took refuge with his lathe and tools, and there I followed and watched him. He took the greatest pleasure in instructing me.  Even in the most humble mechanical job he was sure to direct my attention to the action of the tools and to the construction of the work he had in hand, and pointed out the manipulative processes requisite for its being effectually carried out.  My hearty zeal in assisting him was well rewarded by his implanting in my mind the great fundamental principles on which the practice of engineering in its grandest forms is based. But I did not learn this all at once.  It came only gradually, and by dint of constant repetition and inculcation.  In the meantime I made a beginning by doing some little mechanical work on my own account.\\n\\nWhile attending the High School, from 1817 to 1820, there was the usual rage amongst boys for spinning-tops, \\\"peeries,\\\" and \\\"young cannon.\\\" By means of my father's excellent foot-lathe I turned out the spinning-tops in capital style, so much so that I be came quite noted amongst my school companions.  They all wanted to have specimens of my productions.  They would give any price for them.  The peeries were turned with perfect accuracy, and the steel shod, or spinning pivot, was centred so as to correspond exactly with the axis of the top. They could spin twice as long as the bought peeries.  When at full speed they would \\\"sleep,\\\" that is, revolve without the slightest waving.  This was considered high art as regarded top-spinning.\\n\\nFlying-kites and tissue paper balloons were articles that I was somewhat famed for producing.  There was a good deal of special skill required for the production of a flying-kite.  It must be perfectly still and steady when at its highest flight in the air. Paper messengers were sent up to it along the string which held it to the ground.  The top of the Calton Hill was the most favourite place for enjoying this pleasant amusement.\",\"timestamp\":1639288617,\"title\":\"\\nI began to learn the elementary rudiments of Latin grammar.
