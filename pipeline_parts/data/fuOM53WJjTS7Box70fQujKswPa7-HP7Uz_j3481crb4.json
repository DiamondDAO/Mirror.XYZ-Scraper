"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"With the original NFT function, ENVELOP has the wNFT function. Users can freely use any NFT on the market to convert into pledge token wNfT. After the conversion, the original NFT function is not restricted, and the NFT converted into pledge token can still complete the initial NFT function in any service.\\n\\nAs a flexible cross-chain NFT platform, ENVELOP can provide NFTs with many new features (economic activation, on-chain copyright fees, leasing mechanism, time/value/event locking), devaluation protection and anti-fraud system. These tools can Easily used in GameFi, trading market, artwork, meta universe and non-mortgage NFT leasing and other fields.\\nENVELOP creates a complete closed-loop guarantee for various NFT users, including NFT leasing, transfer, collateral, direct purchase and sale, transaction, tokenization of secured derivatives, etc. In this ecosystem, not only individuals and legal entities can become participants, but any activity object can also become participants, such as scripts, neural networks, artificial intelligence, and other NFT issuers.\\n\\nAt present, ENVELOP mainly serves the development of the following carriers:\\n\\nTokenization of payment channels and consolidated transactions (protocols, oracles, indexes);\\nFormulate the wNFT format (agreement) for the secured derivatives market;\\nDevelop lease design (agreement and oracle) for NFT characters in the game/GameFi market segment;\\nThe advertising market (index) in the meta universe;\\nCreate a ZK mechanism (protocol) for storing assets in wNFT.\\nAnother distinguishing feature of ENVELOP is its unique cross-chain mechanism, which is an efficient form and consists of three steps:\\n\\n• Create wNFT as a guarantee in network #01 (for example-Ethernet);\\n\\n• Write wNFT into the smart contract on network #01;\\n\\n• Send the NFT key in network #02.\\n\\nThe agreement can tokenize any level of liquid assets, such as: assets flowing outside the payment channel, using converted LP tokens to create complex transactions, and so on. ENVELOP is a DAO protocol. Since DAO has developed into a service protocol, oracle and index micro-DAO, any project can use these functions for free.\\n\\nIt is worth mentioning that ENVELOP is the top 10 project of the Binance Hackathon. It has received bonus support from Rarible and Polygon. The market is in great demand at present. At the same time, the team members have more than 8 years of experience in the encryption field, 15 years of experience in the implementation of IT product project management in the fields of financial technology, e-commerce, and IT consulting, and have entrepreneurial experience in many successful high-tech projects. They are professionals with a background in blockchain, crypto trading, and entrepreneurship.\\n\\nIn short, on ENVELOP, creators can formulate their own rules, including asset pools, collateral and royalties, and holders can get a certain amount of asset value guarantee. At the same time, compared with other platforms, ENVELOP provides traders with relatively faster transaction speeds. If you are a game developer, then this platform will also provide you with a good creative environment, and the platform itself will be able to help users estimate and set royalties. Of course, users can also create their own cases to further expand Metaverse, be able to collect royalties from the tokenized NFT, and sell the NFT at a higher price.\",\"timestamp\":1634575901,\"title\":\"Create a flexible cross-chain tool set to stimulate the new economic value of NFT\"},\"digest\":\"rUf4qS9pANwHsdtqwmZH0QMcpW6rYROeyQEaLeHaGHo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xf4d69bC8197E0A34130015004C3B97A7C3cCbc70\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"sPvfFwx53p4k96MIIA9CJy2POWTT6TUiy47YW7M7MBM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xGvGZaEGhTsBAEgm4UkpRboy7ObC2ITXnZEE4Ki7rjw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"WYodNM_BjldnZ0VX90FBqJJQvQpKArz7UrFNnLaGR6Df6j_spmFN37V8-ysIudDK1wjVwT4o4si155ztY55XgA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x57ac7ebc6d4c10a891db9ba42b4c7d19a75a6e465d53b8e308481fa8c23664d376c1ae1d78550e4ed2d6d5bf0f5e0daba7ab0b2acb272ff23ec802eba6f139f01c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"sPvfFwx53p4k96MIIA9CJy2POWTT6TUiy47YW7M7MBM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xGvGZaEGhTsBAEgm4UkpRboy7ObC2ITXnZEE4Ki7rjw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rUf4qS9pANwHsdtqwmZH0QMcpW6rYROeyQEaLeHaGHo\"}"
