"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Last year, Apache was accused by the Nevada secretary of state's securities division of attempting to sell unregistered securities to the public to raise money for a purported COVID-19 cure that Nevada regulators labeled as a \\\"scheme.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We know criminals are opportunistic and use current events to cloak their schemes with an air of immediacy and legitimacy,\\\" Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske said in a statement issued by her office to announce the action against Apache.\\n\\nIn a press release at the time, Apache described its supposed cure vaguely, saying that it \\\"was developed over a 20-year period by a Harvard graduate,\\\" was \\\"derived from a well-known plant,\\\" and worked by \\\"depriving the COVID-19 virus of oxygen and killing it.\\\"\\n\\nApache said at the time it had \\\"put together a crack team to ramrod the testing\\\" for the purported treatment and was planning to raise $2.5 billion from investors to bring it to market.\\n\\nIn response, the Nevada secretary of state's office imposed a cease-and-desist action against the fundraising effort and launched an administrative action against Apache that is ongoing and could subject the company to tens of thousands of dollars in fines.\\n\\nSoon after it was targeted by Nevada regulators, Apache said it had abandoned the fundraising effort and released a statement blaming the imbroglio on a dead man. Its senior director, Dr. Lawrence Madoff, it said, had initiated the offering without authorization from the company and in a manner that was \\\"grossly premature.\\\"\\n\\nMadoff wasn't on hand to explain his actions because he had \\\"died within two days of the March 18, 2020 press release\\\" unveiling the cure, Apache said.\\n\\n## \",\"timestamp\":1638368888,\"title\":\"A purported COVID-19 cure\"},\"digest\":\"IxOWt8MSSQ2t9ChOHG_tceGSfqvT8mGMOvZkf3cmbNk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x1038e4F71522CAca5DA23A44eC021E14804b7a4f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uyES6LE4bRrzouB-2gICZTicmqtOrbOD3E1visnVSxM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZodbuTuqFoiQJX4P1NH3-1W96JinmrsiTY3L5rm8XAw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"420VvSG0vz_3tEysKkTKcRbx8SZp8adgwaA7MnF_WLFlrkPAFxWUOAr3u-JaC3fspP_JJs4tefDHt1mnfwerJw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd4a09ac089ba810f84763fc648fd6a1916f1086c072168e6fcd812b6ee9881305688d6f2282670ca5067be7040d74971c66ff5dfb241ddbaa690eca2d69010881c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uyES6LE4bRrzouB-2gICZTicmqtOrbOD3E1visnVSxM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZodbuTuqFoiQJX4P1NH3-1W96JinmrsiTY3L5rm8XAw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"IxOWt8MSSQ2t9ChOHG_tceGSfqvT8mGMOvZkf3cmbNk\"}"
