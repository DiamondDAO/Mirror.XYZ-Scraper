"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"She shows her affection for her parents by wishing to remain in it. The fact, I suppose, is, you want the rooms.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But even if we didn't? You're not going to live here for ever, I suppose?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That, Sir, is too good to be thought of, I fear. The truth is we had an idea of staying at my father's. He spoke of going down to the country and lending us the house. My sisters have made him change his mind and so here we are. Of course we can go into lodgings.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Or to an hotel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Too dear! You see you've made me pay such a sum for insuring my life. I'll tell you what I'll do. If you'll let us make it out here till the 10th of July we'll go into an hotel then.\\\" Sir Thomas, surprised at his own compliance, did at last give way. \\\"And then we can have a month at Glenbogie from the 12th.\\\" \\\"Three weeks,\\\" said Sir Thomas, shouting at the top of his voice. \\\"Very well; three weeks. If you could have made it the month it would have been convenient; but I hate to be disagreeable.\\\" Thus the matter was settled, and Mr Traffick was altogether well pleased with the arrangement.\\n\\n\\\"What are we to do?\\\" said Augusta, with a very long face. \\\"What are we to do when we are made to go away?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hope I shall be able to make some of the girls go down by that time, and then we must squeeze in at my father's.\\\"\\n\\nThis and other matters made Sir Thomas in those days irritable and disagreeable to the family. \\\"Tom\\\", he said to his wife, \\\"is the biggest fool that ever lived.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What is the matter with him now?\\\" asked Lady Tringle, who did not like to have her only son abused.\\n\\n\\\"He's away half his time, and when he does come he'd better be away. If he wants to marry that girl why doesn't he marry her and have done with it?\\\"\\n\\nNow this was a matter upon which Lady Tringle had ideas of her own which were becoming every day stronger. \\\"I'm sure I should be very sorry to see it,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Why should you be sorry? Isn't it the best thing a young man can do? If he's set his heart that way all the world won't talk him off. I thought all that was settled.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You can't make the girl marry him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is that it?\\\" asked Sir Thomas, with a whistle. \\\"You used to say she was setting her cap at him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She is one of those girls you don't know what she would be at. She's full of romance and nonsense, and isn't half as fond of telling the truth as she ought to be. She made my life a burden to me while she was with us, and I don't think she would be any better for Tom.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But he's still determined.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What's the use of that?\\\" said Lady Tringle.\\n\\n\\\"Then he shall have her. I made him a promise and I'm not going to give it up. I told him that if he was in earnest he should have her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You can't make a girl marry a young man.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have her here, and then we'll take her to Glenbogie. Now when I say it I mean it. You go and fetch her, and if you don't I will. I'm not going to have her turned out into the cold in that way.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She won't come, Tom.\\\" Then he turned round and frowned at her. The immediate result of this was that Lady Tringle herself did drive across to Kingsbury Crescent accompanied by Gertrude and Lucy, and did make her request in form. \\\"My dear, your uncle particularly wants you to come to us for the next month.\\\" Mrs Dosett was sitting by. \\\"I hope Ayala may be allowed to come to us for a month.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ayala must answer for herself,\\\" said Mrs Dosett, firmly. There had never been any warm friendship between Mrs Dosett and her husband's elder sister.\\n\\n\\\"I can't,\\\" said Ayala, shaking her head.\\n\\n\\\"Why not, my dear?\\\" said Lady Tringle.\\n\\n\\\"I can't,\\\" said Ayala.\\n\\nLady Tringle was not in the least offended or annoyed at the refusal. She did not at all desire that Ayala should come to Glenbogie. Ayala at Glenbogie would make her life miserable to her. It would, of course, lead to Tom's marriage, and then there would be internecine fighting between Ayala and Augusta. But it was necessary that she should take back to her husband some reply -- and this reply, if in the form of refusal, must come from Ayala herself. \\\"Your uncle has sent me,\\\" said Lady Tringle, \\\"and I must give him some reason. As for expense, you know,\\\" -- then she turned to Mrs Dosett with a smile -- \\\"that of course would be our affair.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you ask me,\\\" said Mrs Dosett, \\\"I think that as Ayala has come to us she had better remain with us. Of course things are very different, and she would be only discontented.\\\" At this Lady Tringle smiled her sweetest smile -- as though acknowledging that things certainly were different -- and then turned to Ayala for a further reply.\\n\\n\\\"Aunt Emmeline, I can't,\\\" said Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"But why, my dear? Can't isn't a courteous answer to a request that is meant to be kind.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Speak out, Ayala,\\\" said Mrs Dosett. \\\"There is nobody here but your aunts.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because of Tom.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tom wouldn't eat you,\\\" said Lady Tringle, again smiling.\\n\\n\\\"It's worse than eating me,\\\" said Ayala. \\\"He will go on when I tell him not. If I were down there he'd be doing it always. And then you'd tell me that I -- encouraged him!\\\"\\n\\nLady Tringle felt this to be unkind and undeserved. Those passages in Rome had been very disagreeable to every one concerned. The girl certainly, as she thought, had been arrogant and impertinent. She had been accepted from charity and had then domineered in the family. She had given herself airs and had gone out into company almost without authority, into company which had rejected her -- Lady Tringle. It had become absolutely necessary to get rid of an inmate so troublesome, so unbearable. The girl had been sent away -- almost ignominiously. Now she, Lady Tringle, the offended aunt, the aunt who had so much cause for offence, had been good enough, gracious enough, to pardon all this, and was again offering the fruition of a portion of her good things to the sinner. No doubt she was not anxious that the offer should be accepted, but not the less was it made graciously -- as she felt herself. In answer to this she had thrown back upon her the only hard word she had ever spoken to the girl! \\\"You wouldn't be told anything of the kind, but you needn't come if you don't like it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then I don't,\\\" said Ayala, nodding her head.\\n\\n\\\"But I did think that after all that has passed, and when I am trying to be kind to you, you would have made yourself more pleasant to me. I can only tell your uncle that you say you won't.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Give my love to my uncle, and tell him that I am much obliged to him and that I know how good he is; but I can't -- because of Tom.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tom is too good for you,\\\" exclaimed Aunt Emmeline, who could not bear to have her son depreciated even by the girl whom she did not wish to marry him.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't say he wasn't,\\\" said Ayala, bursting into tears. \\\"The Archbishop of Canterbury would be too good for me, but I don't want to marry him.\\\" Then she got up and ran out of the room in order that she might weep over her troubles in the privacy of her own chamber. She was thoroughly convinced that she was being ill-used. No one had a right to tell her that any man was too good for her unless she herself should make pretensions to the man. It was an insult to her even to connect her name with that of any man unless she had done something to connect it. In her own estimation her cousin Tom was infinitely beneath her -- worlds beneath her -- a denizen of an altogether inferior race, such as the Beast was to the Beauty! Not that Ayala had ever boasted to herself of her own face or form. It was not in that respect that she likened herself to the Beauty when she thought of Tom as the Beast. Her assumed superiority existed in certain intellectual or rather artistic and aesthetic gifts -- certain celestial gifts. But as she had boasted of them to no one, as she had never said that she and her cousin were poles asunder in their tastes, poles asunder in their feelings, poles asunder in their intelligence, was it not very, very cruel that she should be told, first that she encouraged him, and then that she was not good enough for him? Cinderella did not ask to have the Prince for her husband. When she had her own image of which no one could rob her, and was content with that, why should they treat her in this cruel way?\\n\\n\\\"I am afraid you are having a great deal of trouble with her,\\\" said Lady Tringle to Mrs Dosett.\\n\\n\\\"No, indeed. Of course she is romantic, which is very objectionable.\\\" \\\"Quite detestable!\\\" said Lady Tringle.\\n\\n\\\"But she has been brought up like that, so that it is not her fault. Now she endeavours to do her best.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She is so upsetting.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She is angry because her cousin persecutes her.\\\" \\\"Persecutes her, indeed! Tom is in a position to ask any girl to be his wife. He can give her a home of her own, and a good income. She ought to be proud of the offer instead of speaking like that. But nobody wants her to have him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He wants it, I suppose.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Just taken by her baby face -- that's all. It won't last, and she needn't think so. However, I've done my best to be kind, Mrs Dosett, and there's an end of it. If you please I'll ring the bell for the carriage. Goodbye.\\\" After that she swam out of the room and had herself carried back to Queen's Gate.\\n\\nCHAPTER 14 FRANK HOUSTON\\n\\nThree or four days afterwards Sir Thomas asked whether Ayala was to come to Glenbogie. \\\"She positively refused,\\\" said his wife, \\\"and was so rude and impertinent that I could not possibly have her now.\\\" Then Sir Thomas frowned and turned himself away, and said not a word further on that occasion.\\n\\nThere were many candidates for Glenbogie on this occasion. Among others there was Mr Frank Houston, whose candidature was not pressed by himself -- as could not well have been done -- but was enforced by Gertrude on his behalf. It was now July. Gertrude and Mr Houston had seen something of each other in Rome, as may be remembered, and since then had seen a good deal of each other in town. Gertrude was perfectly well aware that Mr Houston was impecunious; but Augusta had been allowed to have an impecunious lover, and Tom to throw himself at the feet of an impecunious love. Gertrude felt herself to be entitled to her L#120,000; did not for a moment doubt but that she would get it. Why shouldn't she give it to any young man she liked as long as he belonged to decent people? Mr Houston wasn't a Member of Parliament -- but then he was young and good-looking. Mr Houston wasn't son to a lord, but he was brother to a county squire, and came of a family much older than that of those stupid Boardotrade and Traffick people. And then Frank Houston was very presentable, was not at all bald, and was just the man for a girl to like as a husband. It was dinned into her ears that Houston had no income at all -- just a few hundreds a year on which he never could keep himself out of debt. But he was a generous man, who would be more than contented with the income coming from L#120,000. He would not spunge upon the house at Queen's Gate. He would not make use of Merle Park and Glenbogie. He would have a house of his own for his old boots. Four-percent. would give them nearly L#5,000 a year. Gertrude knew all about it already. They could have a nice house near Queen's Gate -- say somewhere about Onslow Gardens. There would be quite enough for a carriage, for three months upon a mountain in Switzerland, and three more among the art treasures of Italy. It was astonishing how completely Gertrude had it all at her finger's ends when she discussed the matter with her mother. Mr Houston was a man of no expensive tastes. He didn't want to hunt. He did shoot, no doubt, and perhaps a little shooting at Glenbogie might be nice before they went to Switzerland. In that case two months on the top of the mountain would suffice. But if he was not asked he would never condescend to demand an entry at Glenbogie as a part of his wife's dower. Lady Tringle was thus talked over, though she did think that at least one of her daughter's husbands ought to have an income of his own. There was another point which Gertrude put forward very frankly, and which no doubt had weight with her mother. \\\"Mamma, I mean to have him,\\\" she said, when Lady Tringle expressed a doubt.\\n\\n\\\"But papa?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I mean to have him. Papa can scold, of course, if he pleases.\\\" \\\"But where would the income come from if papa did not give it?\\\" \\\"Of course he'll give it. I've a right to it as much as Augusta.\\\" There was something in Gertrude's face as she said this which made her mother think that she would have her way.\\n\\nBut Sir Thomas had hitherto declined. When Frank Houston, after the manner of would-be sons-in-law, had applied to Sir Thomas, Sir Thomas, who already knew all about it, asked after his income, his prospects, and his occupation. Fifty years ago young men used to encounter the misery of such questions, and to live afterwards often in the enjoyment of the stern questioner's money and daughters. But there used in those days to be a bad quarter of an hour while the questions were being asked, and not unfrequently a bad six months afterwards, while the stern questioner was gradually undergoing a softening process under the hands of the females of the family. But the young man of today has no bad quarter of an hour. \\\"You are a mercantile old brick with money and a daughter. I am a jeunesse doree -- gilded by blood and fashion, though so utterly impecunious! Let us know your terms. How much is it to be, and then I can say whether we can afford to live upon it.\\\" The old brick surrenders himself more readily and speedily to the latter than to the former manner -- but he hardly surrenders himself quite at once. Frank Houston, when inquired into, declared at once, without blushing, that he had no income at all to speak of in reference to matrimonial life. As to family prospects he had none. His elder brother had four blooming boys, and was likely to have more. As for occupation, he was very fond of painting, very fond of art all round, could shoot a little, and was never in want of anything to do as long as he had a book. But for the earning of money he had no turn whatever. He was quite sure of himself that he could never earn a shilling. But then on the other hand he was not extravagant -- which was almost as good as earning. It was almost incredible; but with his means, limited as they were to a few hundreds, he did not owe above a thousand pounds -- a fact which he thought would weigh much with Sir Thomas in regard to his daughter's future happiness.\\n\\nSir Thomas gave him a flat refusal. \\\"I think that I may boast that your daughter's happiness is in my charge,\\\" said Frank Houston. \\\"Then she must be unhappy,\\\" said Sir Thomas. Houston shrugged his shoulders. \\\"A fool like that has no right to be happy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There isn't another man in the world by whom I would allow her to be spoken of like that,\\\" said Houston.\\n\\n\\\"Bother!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I regard her as all that is perfect in woman, and you must forgive me if I say that I shall not abandon my suit. I may be allowed, at any rate, to call at the house?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certainly not.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is a kind of thing that is never done nowadays -- never,\\\" said Houston, shaking his head.\\n\\n\\\"I suppose my own house is my own.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yours and Lady Tringle's, and your daughters', no doubt. At any rate, Sir Thomas, you will think of this again. I am sure you will think of it again. If you find that your daughter's happiness depends upon it -- \\\"\\n\\n\\\"I shall find nothing of the kind. Good morning.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good morning, Sir Thomas.\\\" Then Mr Houston, bowing graciously, left the little back room in Lombard Street, and, jumping into a cab had himself taken straight away to Queen's Gate.\\n\\n\\\"Papa is always like that,\\\" said Gertrude. On that day Mrs Traffick, with all the boots, had taken herself away to the small house in Mayfair, and Gertrude, with her mother, had the house to herself. At the present moment Lady Tringle was elsewhere, so that the young lady was alone with her lover.\\n\\n\\\"But he comes round, I suppose.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If he doesn't have too much to eat -- which disagrees with him -- he does. He's always better down at Glenbogie because he's out of doors a good deal, and then he can digest things.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then take him down to Glenbogie and let him digest it at once.\\\" \\\"Of course we can't go till the 12th. Perhaps we shall start on the 10th, because the 11th is Sunday. What will you do, Frank?\\\" There had been a whisper of Frank's going to the Tyrol in August, there to join the Mudbury Docimers, who were his far-away cousins. Imogene Docimer was a young lady of marvellous beauty -- not possessed indeed of L#120,000 -- of whom Gertrude had heard, and was already anxious that her Frank should not go to the Tyrol this year. She was already aware that her Frank had -- just an artist's eye for feminine beauty in its various shapes, and thought that in the present condition of things he would be better at Glenbogie than in the Tyrol.\\n\\n\\\"I am thinking of wandering away somewhere -- perhaps to the Tyrol. The Mudbury Docimers are there. He's a pal of mine, besides being a cousin. Mrs Docimer is a very nice woman.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And her sister?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A lovely creature. Such a turn of the neck! I've promised to make a study of her back head.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come down to Glenbogie,\\\" said Gertrude, sternly.\\n\\n\\\"How can I do that when your governor won't let me enter his house door even in London?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you're here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well -- yes -- I am here. But he told me not. I don't see how I'm to drive in at the gate at Glenbogie with all my traps, and ask to be shown my room. I have cheek enough for a good deal, my pet.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I believe you have, Sir -- cheek enough for anything. But mamma must manage it -- mamma and me, between us. Only keep yourself disengaged. You won't go to the Tyrol -- eh?\\\" Then Frank Houston promised that he would not go to the Tyrol as long as there was a chance open that he might be invited to Glenbogie.\\n\\n\\\"I won't hear of it,\\\" said Sir Thomas to his wife. On that occasion his digestion had perhaps failed him a little. \\\"He only wants to get my money.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But Gertrude has set her heart on it, and nothing will turn her away.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why can't she set her heart on someone who has got a decent income? That man hasn't a shilling.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nor yet has Mr Traffick.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mr Traffick has, at any rate, got an occupation. Were it to do again, Mr Traffick would never see a shilling of my money. By  -- , those fellows, who haven't got a pound belonging to them, think that they're to live on the fat of the land out of the sweat of the brow of such men as me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What is your money for, Tom, but for the children?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know what it's for. I'd sooner build a hospital than give it to an idle fellow like that Houston. When I asked him what he did, he said he was fond of 'picters'!\\\" Sir Thomas would fall back from his usual modes of expression when he was a little excited.\\n\\n\\\"Of course he hasn't been brought up to work. But he is a gentleman, and I do think he would make our girl happy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My money would make him happy -- till he had spent it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tie it up.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You don't know what you're talking about. How are you to prevent a man from spending his wife's income?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"At any rate, if you have him down at Glenbogie you can see what sort of a man he is. You don't know him now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As much as I wish to.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That isn't fair to the poor girl. You needn't give your consent to a marriage because he comes to Glenbogie. You have only to say that you won't give the money and then it must be off. They can't take the money from you.\\\" His digestion could not have been very bad, for he allowed himself to be persuaded that Houston should be asked to Glenbogie for ten days. This was the letter of invitation --\\n\\nMY DEAR MR. HOUSTON,\\n\\nWe shall start for Glenbogie on the 10th of next month. Sir Thomas wishes you to join us on the 20th if you can, and stay till the end of the month. We shall be a little crowded at first, and therefore cannot name an earlier day.\\n\\nI am particularly to warn you that this means nothing more than a simple invitation. I know what passed between you and Sir Thomas, and he hasn't at all changed his mind. I think it right to tell you this. If you like to speak to him again when you are at Glenbogie of course you can.\\n\\nVery sincerely yours,\\n\\nEMMELINE TRINGLE\\n\\nAt the same time, or within a post of it, he got another letter, which was as follows --\\n\\nDEAREST F,\\n\\nPapa, you see, hasn't cut up so very rough, after all. You are to be allowed to come and help to slaughter grouse, which will be better than going to that stupid Tyrol. If you want to draw somebody's back head you can do it there. Isn't it a joke papa's giving way like that all in a moment? He gets so fierce sometimes that we think he's going to eat everybody. Then he has to come down, and he gets eaten worse than anybody else.\\n\\nOf course, as you're asked to Glenbogie, you can come here as often as you like. I shall ride on Thursday and Friday. I shall expect you exactly at six, just under the Memorial. You can't come home to dinner, you know, because he might flare up; but you can turn in at lunch every day you please except Saturday and Sunday. I intend to be so jolly down at Glenbogie. You mustn't be shooting always.\\n\\nEver your own,\\n\\nG.\\n\\nFrank Houston as he read this threw himself back on the sofa and gave way to a soft sigh. He knew he was doing his duty -- just as another man does who goes forth from his pleasant home to earn his bread and win his fortune in some dry, comfortless climate, far from the delights to which he has been always accustomed. He must do his duty. He could not live always adding a hundred or two of debt to the burden already round his neck. He must do his duty. As he thought of this he praised himself mightily. How beautiful was his far-away cousin, Imogene Docimer, as she would twist her head round so as to show the turn of her neck! How delightful it would be to talk love to Imogene! As to marrying Imogene, who hadn't quite so many hundreds as himself, that he knew to be impossible. As for marriage, he wasn't quite sure that he wanted to marry anyone. Marriage, to his thinking, was \\\"a sort of grind\\\" at the best. A man would have to get up and go to bed with some regularity. His wife might want him to come down in a frock coat to breakfast. His wife would certainly object to his drawing the back heads of other young women. Then he thought of the provocation he had received to draw Gertrude's back head. Gertrude hadn't got any turn of a neck to speak of. Gertrude was a stout, healthy girl; and, having L#120,000, was entitled to such a husband as himself. If he waited longer he might be driven to worse before he found the money which was so essentially necessary. He was grateful to Gertrude for not being worse, and was determined to treat her well. But as for love, romance, poetry, art -- all that must for the future be out of the question. Of course, there would now be no difficulty with Sir Thomas, and therefore he must at once make up his mind. He decided that morning, with many soft regrets, that he would go to Glenbogie, and let those dreams of wanderings in the mountains of the Tyrol pass away from him. \\\"Dear, dearest Imogene!\\\" He could have loved Imogene dearly had fates been more propitious. Then he got up and shook himself, made his resolution like a man, ate a large allowance of curried salmon for his breakfast -- and then wrote the following letter. \\\"Duty first!\\\" he said to himself as he sat down to the table like a hero.\\n\\nLetter No. 1\\n\\nDEAR LADY TRINGLE,\\n\\nSo many thanks! Nothing could suit my book so well as a few days at Glenbogie just at the end of August. I will be there, like a book, on the 20th. Of course I understand all that you say. Fathers can't be expected to yield all at once, especially when suitors haven't got very much of their own. I shouldn't have dared to ask hadn't I known myself to be a most moderate man. Of course I shall ask again. If you will help me, no doubt I shall succeed. I really do think that I am the man to make Gertrude happy.\\n\\nYours, dear Lady Tringle, ever so much,\\n\\nF. HOUSTON\\n\\nLetter No. 2\\n\\nMY OWN ONE,\\n\\nYour governor is a brick. Of course, Glenbogie will be better than the Tyrol, as you are to be there. Not but what the Tyrol is a very jolly place, and we'll go and see it together some day. Ask Tom to let me know whether one can wear heavy boots in the Glenbogie mountains. They are much the best for the heather; but I have shot generally in Yorkshire, and there they are too hot. What number does he shoot with generally? I fancy the birds are wilder with you than with us.\\n\\nAs for riding, I don't dare to sit upon a horse this weather. Nobody but a woman can stand it. Indeed, now I think of it, I sold my horse last week to pay the fellow I buy paints from. I've got the saddle and bridle, and if I stick them up upon a rail, under the trees, it would be better than any horse while the thermometer is near 80. All the ladies could come round and talk to one so nicely.\\n\\nI hate lunch, because it makes me red in the face, and nobody will give me my breakfast before eleven at the earliest. But I'll come in about three as often as you like to have me. I think I perhaps shall run over to the Tyrol after Glenbogie. A man must go somewhere when he has been turned out in that fashion. There are so many babies at Buncombe Hall! -- Buncombe Hall is the family seat of the Houstons -- and I don't like to see my own fate typified before the time.\\n\\nCan I do anything for you except riding or eating lunch -- which are simply feminine exercises?\\n\\nAlways your own,\\n\\nFRANK\\n\\nLetter No. 3\\n\\nDEAR COUSIN IM,\\n\\nHow pleasant it is that a little strain of thin blood should make the use of that pretty name allowable! What a stupid world it is when the people who like each other best cannot get together because of proprieties, and marriages, and such balderdash as we call love. I do not in the least want to be in love with you -- but I do want to sit near you, and listen to you, and look at you, and to know that the whole air around is impregnated by the mysterious odour of your presence. When one is thoroughly satisfied with a woman there comes a scent as of sweet flowers, which does not reach the senses of those whose feelings are not so awakened.\\n\\nAnd now for my news! I suppose that G. T. will in a tremendously short period become Mistress F. H. \\\"A long day, my Lord.\\\" But, if you are to be hung, better be hung at once. Pere Tringle has not consented -- has done just the reverse -- has turned me out of his house, morally. That is, out of his London house. He asked of my \\\"house and my home\\\", as they did of Allan-a-Dale. Queen Gate and Glenbogie stand fair on the hill.\\\"My home\\\", quoth bold Houston, \\\"shows gallanter still.'Tis the gerret up three pair -- \\\"\\n\\nThen he told me roughly to get me gone; but \\\"had laughed on the lass with my bonny black eye.\\\" So the next day I got an invite to Glenbogie, and at the appropriate time in August, She'll go to the mountains to hear a love tale,And the youth --  it will be told by is to be your poor unfortunate coz, Frank Houston. Who's going to whimper? Haven't I known all along what was to come? It has not been my lot in life to see a flower and pick it because I love it. But a good head of cabbage when you're hungry is wholesome food. --\\n\\nYour loving cousin, but not loving as he oughtn't to love,\\n\\nFRANK HOUSTON\\n\\n\\\"I shall still make a dash for the Tyrol when this episode at Glenbogie is over.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER 15 AYALA WITH HER FRIENDS\\n\\nSome few days after Lady Tringle had been at Kingsbury Crescent, two visitors, who knew little or nothing of each other, came to see Ayala. One was a lady and the other a gentleman, and the lady came first. The gentleman, however, arrived before the lady had gone. Mrs Dosett was present while the lady remained; but when the gentleman came she was invited to leave him alone with her niece -- as shall be told.\\n\\nThe lady was the Marchesa Baldoni. Can the reader go so far back as to remember the Marchesa Baldoni? It was she who rather instigated Ayala to be naughty to the Tringles in Rome, and would have Ayala at her parties when she did not want the Tringles. The Marchesa was herself an Englishwoman, though she had lived at Rome all her life, and had married an Italian nobleman. She was now in London for a few weeks, and still bore in mind her friendship for Ayala, and a certain promise she had once made her. In Rome Lady Tringle, actuated by Augusta, who at the moment was very angry with everybody, including her own lover, had quarrelled with the Marchesa. The Marchesa had then told Ayala that she, Ayala, must stay with her aunt -- must, in fact, cease for the time to come to the Marchesa's apartments, because of the quarrel; but that a time would come in which they might again be friends. Soon afterwards the Marchesa had heard that the Tringle family had discarded poor Ayala -- that her own quarrel had, in fact, extended itself to Ayala, and that Ayala had been shunted off to a poor relation, far away from all the wealth and luxuries which she had been allowed to enjoy for so short a time. Therefore, soon after her arrival in London, the Marchesa had made herself acquainted with the address of the Dosetts, and now was in Kingsbury Crescent in fulfilment of her promise made at Rome.\\n\\n\\\"So now you have got our friend Ayala,\\\" said the Marchesa with a smile to Mrs Dosett.\\n\\n\\\"Yes; we have her now. There has been a change. Her sister, Lucy, has gone to my husband's sister, Lady Tringle.\\\"\\n\\nThe Marchesa made a pleasant little bow at each word. She seemed to Mrs Dosett to be very gorgeously dressed. She was thoroughly well dressed, and looked like a Marchesa -- or perhaps, even, like a Marchioness. She was a tall, handsome woman, with a smile perhaps a little too continuously sweet, but with a look conscious of her own position behind it. She had seen in a moment of what nature was Ayala, how charming, how attractive, how pretty, how clever -- how completely the very opposite of the Tringles! Ayala learned Italian so readily that she could talk it almost at once. She could sing, and play, and draw. The Marchesa had been quite willing that her own daughter Nina should find a friend in Ayala. Then had come the quarrel. Now she was quite willing to renew the friendship, though Ayala's position was so sadly altered. Mrs Dosett was almost frightened as the grand lady sat holding Ayala's hand, and patting it. \\\"We used to know her so well in Rome -- did we not, Ayala?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You were very kind to me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nina couldn't come, because her father would make her go with him to the pictures. But now, my dear, you must come to us just for a little time. We have a furnished house in Brook Street, near the park, till the end of the season, and we have one small spare room which will just do for you. I hope you will let her come to us, for we really are old friends,\\\" said the Marchesa, turning to Mrs Dosett.\\n\\nMrs Dosett looked black. There are people who always look black when such applications are made to them -- who look black at any allusions to pleasures. And then there came across her mind serious thoughts as to flowers and ribbons -- and then more serious thoughts as to boots, dresses, and hats. Ayala, no doubt, had come there less than six months since with good store of everything; but Mrs Dosett knew that such a house as would be that of this lady would require a girl to show herself with the newest sheen on everything. And Ayala knew it too. The Marchesa turned from the blackness of Mrs Dosett's face with her sweetest smile to Ayala. \\\"Can't we manage it?\\\" said the Marchesa.\\n\\n\\\"I don't think we can,\\\" said Ayala, with a deep sigh.\\n\\n\\\"And why not?\\\"\\n\\nAyala looked furtively round to her aunt. \\\"I suppose I may tell, Aunt Margaret?\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"You may tell everything, my dear,\\\" said Mrs Dosett.\\n\\n\\\"Because we are poor,\\\" said Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"What does that matter?\\\" said the Marchesa, brightening up. \\\"We want you because you are rich in good gifts and pretty ways.\\\" \\\"But I can't get new frocks now as I used to do in Rome. Aunt Emmeline was cruel to me, and said things which I could not bear. But they let me have everything. Uncle Reginald gives me all that he has, and I am much happier here. But we cannot go out and buy things -- can we, Aunt Margaret?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, my dear; we cannot.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It does not signify,\\\" said the Marchesa. \\\"We are quite quiet, and what you have got will do very well. Frocks! The frocks you had in Rome are good enough for London. I won't have a word of all that. Nina has set her heart upon it, and so has my husband, and so have I. Mrs Dosett, when we are at home we are the most homely people in the world. We think nothing of dressing. Not to come and see your old friends because of your frocks! We shall send for you the day after tomorrow. Don't you know, Mrs Dosett, it will do her good to be with her young friend for a few days.\\\" Mrs Dosett had not succeeded in her remonstrances when Sir Thomas Tringle was shown into the room, and then the Marchesa took her leave. For Sir Thomas Tringle was the other visitor who came on that morning to see Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"If you wouldn't mind, Mrs Dosett,\\\" said Sir Thomas before he sat down, \\\"I should like to see Ayala alone.\\\" Mrs Dosett had not a word to say against such a request, and at once took her leave.\\n\\n\\\"My dear,\\\" he began, coming and sitting opposite to Ayala, with his knees almost touching her, \\\"I have got something very particular to say to you.\\\" Ayala was at once much frightened. Her uncle had never before spoken to her in this way -- had never in truth said a word to her seriously. He had always been kind to her, making her presents, and allowing himself to be kissed graciously morning and evening. He had never scolded her, and, better than all, had never said a word to her, one way or the other, about Tom. She had always liked her uncle, because he had never caused her trouble when all the others in his house had been troublesome to her. But now she was afraid of him. He did not frown, but he looked very seriously at her, as he might look, perhaps, when he was counting out all his millions in Lombard Street. \\\"I hope you think that I have always wished to be kind to you, Ayala.\\\" \\\"I am sure you have, Uncle Tom.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"When you had come to us I always wished you to stay. I don't like changes of this sort. I suppose you didn't hit it off with Augusta. But she's gone now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Aunt Emmeline said something.\\\" That accusation, as to \\\"encouragement\\\", so rankled in her heart, that when she looked back at her grievances among the Tringles that always loomed the largest.\\n\\n\\\"I don't want to hear anything about it,\\\" said Sir Thomas. \\\"Let bygones be bygones. Your aunt, I am sure, never meant unkindly by you. Now, I want you to listen to me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will, Uncle Tom.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Listen to me to the end, like a good girl.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1639990786,\"title\":\"Augusta made up her mind no doubt to leave her father's house when she married\"},\"digest\":\"E_NMV40e8xMqjeDSZjF8NAM4kNgX8WtaUU3p5DoTL0w\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x336f98da5BDeF1692C4dE51f67eafA44062a418E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LT2WfhrP3N7RLS79xEkXiB5xGe5N4aZBojjh6Z8CiDk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YMUbRLXXM6mgf3YP6EdTE1HbZQLvmU0N8SQY_g8nhjU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"AESDZVompD41z_JHRFLYDU0cSud2rJMRWX4-FoOC0mQkQ4VJTi_QX7qV8_X8GDJxmBPuVh-QxHZxkAzycXbilQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe06932142f28349bcb4c53cf8391ab7f4246bd88cfffdd182e16ee43ace410b80f7c8e9a4f3b0e769277acf4651c5d1992d4ab133450eb9dca93c14565f48a741b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LT2WfhrP3N7RLS79xEkXiB5xGe5N4aZBojjh6Z8CiDk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YMUbRLXXM6mgf3YP6EdTE1HbZQLvmU0N8SQY_g8nhjU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"E_NMV40e8xMqjeDSZjF8NAM4kNgX8WtaUU3p5DoTL0w\"}"
