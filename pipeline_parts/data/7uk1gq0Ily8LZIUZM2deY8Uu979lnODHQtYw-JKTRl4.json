Every time you send ETH or use an Ethereum application, you pay a small ETH fee (gas fee). By requiring a fee for every computation executed on the network, bad actors are prevented from spamming the network\\n\\n\\n3/ Currently, ETH is mined using the proof of work consensus mechanism, the same process as Bitcoin.\\n\\n\\n4/ Let’s use Uber as an real-world example:\\n\\nYou can think of $ETH as the fuel needed to power the car (Ethereum) to make the trip (complete the transaction), and the #Uber driver is incentivized by the driver fee (gas fee) to make the trip.\\n\\n\\n5/ Difference:\\n\\nThe major difference between #Ethereum and #Bitcoin is their use cases.\\n\\nThe main purpose of Bitcoin is for peer-to-peer payments, whereas Ethereum aims to be a distributed world computer where you can build on top of it.\\n\\n\\n6/ Crypto Wallets: For Ethereum\\n\\nEthereum wallets are applications that let you interact with your #Ethereum account. Your wallet(s) allows you to do the following: manage not only your funds, but also your collectibles (#NFTs) and membership to DAOs.\\n\\n\\n7/ Types of Wallets\\n\\ni. Non-custodial wallet: allows users to hold and own their private key while having full control of their funds.\\n\\n* Hardware Wallets: similar to a flash drive that is offline (Ledger, Trezor)\\n* Web-Based & Mobile Wallets: MetaMask\\n* Desktop Wallet: Exodus\\n  \\n\\n  8/\\n\\nii. Custodial wallet: It’s very likely that the first time you purchase crypto, it will end up in a custodial exchange crypto wallet. In this case, the exchange is your custodian, which holds your keys and is tasked with securely storing your funds (#Coinbase, #Binance)\\n\\n9/ What You Can Do with Ethereum: #DApps\\n\\nOnce you set up your #Ethereum wallet, you can use decentralized applications (dApps). Dapps are decentralized apps that are built on a decentralized network that combines a smart contract + a frontend user interface.\\n10/ Key features of #DApps:\\n\\n* Open-source\\n* Public data and records\\n* Uses a cryptographic token to help keep the network secure\\n  \\n\\n  11/ What is Smart contract?\\n\\nYou can think of it as the back-end of dapps. Once the predetermined conditions of the contract are met, the transaction is automatically completed and recorded on the blockchain.\\n\\n 12/ Smart contracts can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via the code. Smart contracts cannot be deleted by default, and interactions with them are irreversible. (ie: Smart contracts on Ethereum are typically written in Solidity or Vyper.) 13/ Common categories of DApps:\\n\\n* Finance\\n* Art and collectibles\\n* Gaming\\n* Technology\\n  14/ Use-Case of Ethereum:\\n* DeFi (Decentralized Finance)\\n* NFTs & Collectibles\\n* Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)\\n\\nThank you!\\n\\nIf you enjoyed it you can check some other Threads too.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/EtherSiim/status/1447492904730116096](https://twitter.com/EtherSiim/status/1447492904730116096)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638388761,\"title\":\"How to talk #Ethereum like a Pro.\\n\"},\"digest\":\"12wnm_fN3Mrjful98EBs4zHR5cTMtlADJ7WbgckN1YU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6b3791AD79aCc2F412b25De89F00cfDa594f2625\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"B4nHyiFi9PhmMLCR5sUQF9_WDideZ9jEXb4nVBuh5Bo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1RJ68OZFPDOvDVdeek1AWV4QOoLPMdVzaCxfskqaTvg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"M5ZLgUplydKxnNTL0113aIlw9I8PpxgOGsw7e9Faj8v_PLbe355VX9E4QoHf7nBDKhFWSD18_BoGox8ISYJaWw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd6f819f49157ab9155434a79d48ebbad555f89acb6062707d311f90dcc253d715e9fa0af7f14f0ae52be761c251ff6110db2e138e515a27528eeb5b3da429b8d1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"B4nHyiFi9PhmMLCR5sUQF9_WDideZ9jEXb4nVBuh5Bo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1RJ68OZFPDOvDVdeek1AWV4QOoLPMdVzaCxfskqaTvg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"12wnm_fN3Mrjful98EBs4zHR5cTMtlADJ7WbgckN1YU\"}"
