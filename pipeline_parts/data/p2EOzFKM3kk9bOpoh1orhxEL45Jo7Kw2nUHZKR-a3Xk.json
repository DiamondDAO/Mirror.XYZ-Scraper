"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I ordered my horses for nine o'clock this morning, to continue my journey.  I made the more haste to leave, as a Dutch prince was expected, who had lately arrived at Reikjavik, with a large retinue, in a splendid man-of-war.\\n\\nI had the luck to see another eruption before my departure at half- past eight o'clock; and this one was nearly as beautiful as the first.  This time also the outer basin was entirely emptied, and the inner one to a depth of six or seven feet.  I could therefore again descend into the basin, and bid farewell to the Geyser at the very brink of the crater, which, of course, I did.\\n\\nI had now been three nights and two days in the immediate vicinity of the Geyser, and had witnessed five eruptions, of which two were of the most considerable that had ever been known.  But I can assure my readers that I did not find every thing as I had anticipated it according to the descriptions and accounts I had read.  I never heard a greater noise than I have mentioned, and never felt any trembling of the earth, although I paid the greatest attention to every little circumstance, and held my head to the ground during an eruption.\\n\\nIt is singular how many people repeat every thing they hear from others--how some, with an over-excited imagination, seem to see, hear, and feel things which do not exist; and how others, again, tell the most unblushing falsehoods.  I met an example of this in Reikjavik, in the house of the apothecary Moller, in the person of an officer of a French frigate, who asserted that he had \\\"ridden to the very edge of the crater of Mount Vesuvius.\\\"  He probably did not anticipate meeting any one in Reikjavik who had also been to the crater of Vesuvius.  Nothing irritates me so much as such falsehoods and boastings; and I could not therefore resist asking him how he had managed that feat.  I told him that I had been there, and feared danger as little as he could do; but that I had been compelled to descend from my donkey near the top of the mountain, and let my feet carry me the remainder of the journey.  He seemed rather embarrassed, and pretended he had meant to say NEARLY to the crater; but I feel convinced he will tell this story so often that he will at last believe it himself.\\n\\nI hope I do not weary my readers by dwelling so long on the subject of the Geyser.  I will now vary the subject by relating a few circumstances that came under my notice, which, though trifling in themselves, were yet very significant.  The most unimportant facts of an almost unknown country are often interesting, and are often most conclusive evidences of the general character of the nation.\\n\\nI have already spoken of my intoxicated guide.  It is yet inexplicable to me how he could have conducted me so safely in such a semi-conscious state; and had he not been the only one, I should certainly not have trusted myself to his guidance.\\n\\nOf the want of cleanliness of the Icelanders, no one who has not witnessed it can have any idea; and if I attempted to describe some of their nauseous habits, I might fill volumes.  They seem to have no feeling of propriety, and I must, in this respect, rank them as far inferior to the Bedouins and Arabs--even to the Greenlanders.  I can, therefore, not conceive how this nation could once have been distinguished for wealth, bravery, and civilisation.\\n\\nOn this day I proceeded on my journey about twenty-eight miles farther to Skalholt.\\n\\nFor the first five miles we retraced our former road; then we turned to the left and traversed the beautiful long valley in which the Geyser is situated.  For many miles we could see its clouds of steam rising to the sky.  The roads were tolerable only when they passed along the sides of hills and mountains; in the plains they were generally marshy and full of water.  We sometimes lost all traces of a road, and only pushed on towards the quarter in which the place of our destination was situated; and feared withal to sink at every pace into the soft and unresisting soil.\\n\\nI found the indolence of the Icelandic peasants quite unpardonable. All the valleys through which we passed were large morasses richly overgrown with grass.  If the single parishes would unite to dig trenches and drain the soil, they would have the finest meadows. This is proved near the many precipices where the water has an outlet; in these spots the grass grows most luxuriantly, and daisies and herbs flourish there, and even wild clover.  A few cottages are generally congregated on these oases.\\n\\nBefore arriving at the village of Thorfastadir, we already perceived Hecla surrounded by the beautiful jokuls.\\n\\nI arrived at Thorfastadir while a funeral was going on.  As I entered the church the mourners were busily seeking courage and consolation in the brandy-bottle.  The law commands, indeed, that this be not done in the church; but if every one obeyed the law, what need would there be of judges?  The Icelanders must think so, else they would discontinue the unseemly practice.\\n\\nWhen the priest came, a psalm or a prayer--I could not tell which it was, being Icelandic--was so earnestly shouted by peasants under the leadership of the priest and elders, that the good people waxed quite warm and out of breath.  Then the priest placed himself before the coffin, which, for want of room, had been laid on the backs of the seats, and with a very loud voice read a prayer which lasted more than half an hour.  With this the ceremony within the church was concluded, and the coffin was carried round the church to the grave, followed by the priest and the rest of the company.  This grave was deeper than any I had ever seen.  When the coffin had been lowered, the priest threw three handfuls of earth upon it, but none of the mourners followed his example.  Among the earth which had been dug out of the grave I noticed four skulls, several human bones, and a board of a former coffin.  These were all thrown in again upon the coffin, and the grave filled in presence of the priest and the people.  One man trod the soil firm, then a little mound was made and covered with grass-plots which were lying ready. The whole business was completed with miraculous speed.\\n\\nThe little town of Skalholt, my station this night, was once as celebrated in religious matters as Thingvalla had been politically famous.  Here, soon after the introduction of Christianity, the first bishopric was founded in 1098, and the church is said to have been one of the largest and richest.  Now Skalholt is a miserable place, and consists of three or four cottages, and a wretched wooden church, which may perhaps contain a hundred persons; it has not even its own priest, but belongs to Thorfastadir.\\n\\nMy first business on arriving was to inspect the yet remaining relics of past ages.  First I was shewn an oil-picture which hangs in the church, and is said to represent the first bishop of Skalholt, Thorlakur, who was worshipped almost as a saint for his strict and pious life.\\n\\nAfter this, preparations were made to clear away the steps of the altar and several boards of the flooring.  I stood expectantly looking on, thinking that I should now have to descend into a vault to inspect the embalmed body of the bishop.  I must confess this prospect was not the most agreeable, when I thought of the approaching night which I should have to spend in this church, perhaps immediately over the grave of the old skeleton.  I had besides already had too much to do with the dead for one day, and could not rid myself of the unpleasant grave-odour which I had imbibed in Thorfastadir, and which seemed to cling to my dress and my nose. {41}  I was therefore not a little pleased when, instead of the dreaded vault and mummy, I was only shewn a marble slab, on which were inscribed the usual notifications of the birth, death, &c. of this great bishop.  Besides this, I saw an old embroidered stole and a simple golden chalice, both of which are said to be relics of the age of Thorlakar.\\n\\nThen we ascended into the so-called store-room, which is only separated from the lower portion of the church by a few boards, and which extends to the altar.  Here are kept the bells and the organ, if the church possesses one, the provisions, and a variety of tools. They opened an immense chest for me there, which seemed to contain only large pieces of tallow made in the form of cheeses; but under this tallow I found the library, where I discovered an interesting treasure.  This was, besides several very old books in the Icelandic tongue, three thick folio volumes, which I could read very easily; they were German, and contained Luther's doctrines, letters, epistles, &c.\\n\\nI had now seen all there was to be seen, and began to satisfy my physical wants by calling for some hot water to make coffee, &c.  As usual, all the inhabitants of the place ranged themselves in and before the church, probably to increase their knowledge of the human race by studying my peculiarities.  I soon, however, closed the door, and prepared a splendid couch for myself.  At my first entrance into the church, I had noticed a long box, quite filled with sheep's wool.  I threw my rugs over this, and slept as comfortably as in the softest bed.  In the morning I carefully teased the wool up again, and no one could then have imagined where I had passed the night.\\n\\nNothing amused me more, when I had lodgings of this description, than the curiosity of the people, who would rush in every morning, as soon as I opened the door.  The first thing they said to each other was always, \\\"Krar hefur hun sovid\\\" (Where can she have slept?).  The good people could not conceive how it was possible to spend a night ALONE in a church surrounded by a churchyard; they perhaps considered me an evil spirit or a witch, and would too gladly have ascertained how such a creature slept.  When I saw their disappointed faces, I had to turn away not to laugh at them.\\n\\nJune 29th.\\n\\nEarly the next morning I continued my journey.  Not far from Skalholt we came to the river Thiorsa, which is deep and rapid.  We crossed in a boat; but the horses had to swim after us.  It is often very troublesome to make the horses enter these streams; they see at once that they will have to swim.  The guide and boatmen cannot leave the shore till the horses have been forced into the stream; and even then they have to throw stones, to threaten them with the whip, and to frighten them by shouts and cries, to prevent them from returning.\\n\\nWhen we had made nearly twelve miles on marshy roads, we came to the beautiful waterfall of the Huitha.  This fall is not so remarkable for its height, which is scarcely more than fifteen to twenty feet, as for its breadth, and for its quantity of water.  Some beautiful rocks are so placed at the ledge of the fall, that they divide it into three parts; but it unites again immediately beneath them.  The bed of the river, as well as its shores, is of lava.\\n\\nThe colour of the water is also a remarkable feature in this river; it inclines so much to milky white, that, when the sun shines on it, it requires no very strong imaginative power to take the whole for milk.\\n\\nNearly a mile above the fall we had to cross the Huitha, one of the largest rivers in Iceland.  Thence the road lies through meadows, which are less marshy than the former ones, till it comes to a broad stream of lava, which announces the vicinity of the fearful volcano of Hecla.\\n\\nI had hitherto not passed over such an expanse of country in Iceland as that from the Geyser to this place without coming upon streams of lava.  And this lava-stream seemed to have felt some pity for the beautiful meadows, for it frequently separated into two branches, and thus enclosed the verdant plain.  But it could not withstand the violence of the succeeding masses; it had been carried on, and had spread death and destruction everywhere.  The road to it, through plains covered with dark sand, and over steep hills intervening, was very fatiguing and laborious.\\n\\nWe proceeded to the little village of Struvellir, where we stopped to give our horses a few hours' rest.  Here we found a large assembly of men and animals. {42}  It happened to be Sunday, and a warm sunny day, and so a very full service was held in the pretty little church.  When it was over, I witnessed an amusing rural scene.  The people poured out of the church,--I counted ninety-six, which is an extraordinarily numerous assemblage for Iceland,--formed into little groups, chatting and joking, not forgetting, however, to moisten their throats with brandy, of which they had taken care to bring an ample supply.  Then they bridled their horses and prepared for departure; now the kisses poured in from all sides, and there was no end of leave-taking, for the poor people do not know whether they shall ever meet again, and when.\\n\\nIn all Iceland welcome and farewell is expressed by a loud kiss,--a practice not very delightful for a non-Icelander, when one considers their ugly, dirty faces, the snuffy noses of the old people, and the filthy little children.  But the Icelanders do not mind this.  They all kissed the priest, and the priest kissed them; and then they kissed each other, till the kissing seemed to have no end.  Rank is not considered in this ceremony; and I was not a little surprised to see how my guide, a common farm-labourer, kissed the six daughters of a judge, or the wife and children of a priest, or a judge and the priest themselves, and how they returned the compliment without reserve.  Every country has its peculiar customs!\\n\\nThe religious ceremonies generally begin about noon, and last two or three hours.  There being no public inn in which to assemble, and no stable in which the horses can be fastened, all flock to the open space in front of the church, which thus becomes a very animated spot.  All have to remain in the open air.\\n\\nWhen the service was over, I visited the priest, Herr Horfuson; he was kind enough to conduct me to the Salsun, nine miles distant, principally to engage a guide to Hecla for me.\\n\\nI was doubly rejoiced to have this good man at my side, as we had to cross a dangerous stream, which was very rapid, and so deep that the water rose to the horses' breasts.  Although we raised our feet as high as possible, we were yet thoroughly wet.  This wading across rivers is one of the most unpleasant modes of travelling.  The horse swims more than it walks, and this creates a most disagreeable sensation; one does not know whither to direct one's eyes; to look into the stream would excite giddiness, and the sight of the shore is not much better, for that seems to move and to recede, because the horse, by the current, is forced a little way down the river. To my great comfort the priest rode by my side to hold me, in case I should not be able to keep my seat.  I passed fortunately through this probation; and when we reached the other shore, Herr Horfuson pointed out to me how far the current had carried us down the river.\\n\\nThe valley in which Salsun and the Hecla are situated is one of those which are found only in Iceland.  It contains the greatest contrasts.  Here are charming fields covered with a rich green carpet of softest grass, and there again hills of black, shining lava; even the fertile plains are traversed by streams of lava and spots of sand.  Mount Hecla notoriously has the blackest lava and the blackest sand; and it may be imagined how the country looks in its immediate neighbourhood.  One hill only to the left of Hecla is reddish brown, and covered with sand and stones of a similar colour. The centre is much depressed, and seems to form a large crater. Mount Hecla is directly united with the lava-mountains piled round it, and seems from the plain only as a higher point.  It is surrounded by several glaciers, whose dazzling fields of snow descend far down, and whose brilliant plains have probably never been trod by human feet; several of its sides were also covered with snow.  To the left of the valley near Salsun, and at the foot of a lava-hill, lies a lovely lake, on whose shores a numerous flock of sheep were grazing.  Near it rises another beautiful hill, so solitary and isolated, that it looks as if it had been cast out by its neighbours and banished hither.  Indeed, the whole landscape here is so peculiarly Icelandic, so strange and remarkable, that it will ever remain impressed on my memory.\\n\\nSalsun lies at the foot of Mount Hecla, but is not seen before one reaches it.\\n\\nArrived at Salsun, our first care was to seek a guide, and to bargain for every thing requisite for the ascension of the mountain. The guide was to procure a horse for me, and to take me and my former guide to the summit of Hecla.  He demanded five thaler and two marks (about fifteen shillings), a most exorbitant sum, on which he could live for a month.  But what could we do?  He knew very well that there was no other guide to be had, and so I was forced to acquiesce.  When all was arranged, my kind companion left me, wishing me success on my arduous expedition.\\n\\nI now looked out for a place in which I could spend the night, and a filthy hole fell to my lot.  A bench, rather shorter that my body, was put into it, to serve as my bed; beside it hung a decayed fish, which had infected the whole room with its smell.  I could scarcely breathe; and as there was no other outlet, I was obliged to open the door, and thus receive the visits of the numerous and amiable inhabitants.  What a strengthening and invigorating preparation for the morrow's expedition!\\n\\nAt the foot of Mount Hecla, and especially in this village, every thing seems to be undermined.  Nowhere, not even on Mount Vesuvius, had I heard such hollow, droning sounds as here,--the echoes of the heavy footsteps of the peasants.  These sounds made a very awful impression on me as I lay all night alone in that dark hole.\\n\\nMy Hecla guide, as I shall call him to distinguish him from my other guide, advised me to start at two o'clock in the morning, to which I assented, well knowing, however, that we should not have mounted our horses before five o'clock.\\n\\nAs I had anticipated, so it happened.  At half-past five we were quite prepared and ready for departure.  Besides bread and cheese, a bottle of water for myself, and one of brandy for my guides, we were also provided with long sticks, tipped with iron points to sound the depth of the snow, and to lean upon.\\n\\nWe were favoured by a fine warm sunny morning, and galloped briskly over the fields and the adjoining plains of sand.  My guide considered the fine weather a very lucky omen, and told me that M. Geimard, the before-mentioned French scholar, had been compelled to wait three days for fine weather.  Nine years had elapsed, and no one had ascended the mountain since then.  A prince of Denmark, who travelled through Iceland some years before, had been there, but had returned without effecting his purpose.\\n\\nOur road at first led us through beautiful fields, and then over plains of black sand enclosed on all sides by streams, hillocks, and mountains of piled-up lava.  Closer and closer these fearful masses approach, and scarcely permit a passage through a narrow cleft; we had to climb over blocks and hills of lava, where it is difficult to find a firm resting-place for the foot.  The lava rolled beside and behind us, and we had to proceed carefully not to fall or be hit by the rolling lava.  But most dangerous were the chasms filled with snow over which we had to pass; the snow had been softened by the warmth of the season, so that we sank into it nearly every step, or, what was worse, slipped back more than we had advanced.  I scarcely think there can be another mountain whose ascent offers so many difficulties.\\n\\nAfter a labour of about three hours and a half we neared the summit of the mountain, where we were obliged to leave our horses.  I should, indeed, have preferred to do so long before, as I was apprehensive of the poor animals falling as they climbed over these precipices--one might almost call them rolling mountains--but my guide would not permit it.  Sometimes we came to spots where they were useful, and then he maintained that I must ride as far as possible to reserve my strength for the remaining difficulties.  And he was right; I scarcely believe I should have been able to go through it on foot, for when I thought we were near the top, hills of lava again rose between us, and we seemed farther from our journey's end than before.\\n\\nMy guide told me that he had never taken any one so far on horseback, and I can believe it.  Walking was bad enough--riding was fearful.\\n\\nAt every fresh declivity new scenes of deserted, melancholy districts were revealed to us; every thing was cold and dead, every where there was black burnt lava.  It was a painful feeling to see so much, and behold nothing but a stony desert, an immeasurable chaos.\\n\\nThere were still two declivities before us,--the last, but the worst.  We had to climb steep masses of lava, sharp and pointed, which covered the whole side of the mountain.  I do not know how often I fell and cut my hands on the jagged points of the lava.  It was a fearful journey!\\n\\nThe dazzling whiteness of the snow contrasted with the bright black lava beside it had an almost blinding effect.  When crossing fields of snow I did not look at the lava; for having tried to do so once or twice, I could not see my way afterwards, and had nearly grown snow-blind.\\n\\nAfter two hours' more labour we reached the summit of the mountain. I stood now on Mount Hecla, and eagerly sought the crater on the snowless top, but did not find it.  I was the more surprised, as I had read detailed accounts of it in several descriptions of travel.\\n\\nI traversed the whole summit of the mountain and climbed to the adjoining jokul, but did not perceive an opening, a fissure, a depressed space, nor any sign of a crater.  Lower down in the sides of the mountain, but not in the real cone, I saw some clefts and fissures from which the streams of lava probably poured.  The height of the mountain is said to be 4300 feet.\\n\\nDuring the last hour of our ascent the sun had grown dim.  Clouds of mist blown from the neighbouring glaciers enshrouded the hill-tops, and soon enveloped us so closely that we could scarcely see ten paces before us.  At last they dissolved, fortunately not in rain but in snow, which profusely covered the black uneven lava.  The snow remained on the ground, and the thermometer stood at one degree of cold.\\n\\nIn a little while the clear blue sky once more was visible, and the sun again shone over us.  I remained on the top till the clouds had separated beneath us, and afforded me a better distant view over the country.\\n\\nMy pen is unfortunately too feeble to bring vividly before my readers the picture such as I beheld it here, and to describe to them the desolation, the extent and height of these lava-masses.  I seemed to stand in a crater, and the whole country appeared only a burnt-out fire.  Here lava was piled up in steep inaccessible mountains; there stony rivers, whose length and breadth seemed immeasurable, filled the once-verdant fields.  Every thing was jumbled together, and yet the course of the last eruption could be distinctly traced.\\n\\nI stood there, in the centre of horrible precipices, caves, streams, valleys, and mountains, and scarcely comprehended how it was possible to penetrate so far, and was overcome with terror at the thought which involuntarily obtruded itself--the possibility of never finding my way again out of these terrible labyrinths.\\n\\nHere, from the top of Mount Hecla, I could see far into the uninhabited country, the picture of a petrified creation, dead and motionless, and yet magnificent,--a picture which once seen can never again fade from the memory, and which alone amply compensates for all the previous troubles and dangers.  A whole world of glaciers, lava-mountains, snow and ice-fields, rivers and lakes, into which no human foot has ever ventured to penetrate.  How nature must have laboured and raged till these forms were created!  And is it over now?  Has the destroying element exhausted itself; or does it only rest, like the hundred-headed Hydra, to break forth with renewed strength, and desolate those regions which, pushed to the verge of the sea-shore, encircle the sterile interior as a modest wreath?  I thank God that he has permitted me to behold this chaos in his creation; but I thank him more heartily that he has placed me to dwell in regions where the sun does more than merely give light; where it inspires and fertilises animals and plants, and fills the human heart with joy and thankfulness towards its Creator. {43}\\n\\nThe Westmann Isles, which are said to be visible from the top of Hecla, I could not see; they were probably covered by clouds.\\n\\nDuring the ascent of the Hecla I had frequently touched lava,-- sometimes involuntarily, when I fell; sometimes voluntarily, to find a hot or at least a warm place.  I was unfortunate enough only to find cold ones.  The falling snow was therefore most welcome, and I looked anxiously around to see a place where the subterranean heat would melt it.  I should then have hastened thither and found what I sought.  But unfortunately the snow remained unmelted every where. I could neither see any clouds of smoke, although I gazed steadily at the mountain for hours, and could from my post survey it far down the sides.\\n\\nAs we descended we found the snow melting at a depth of 500 to 600 feet; lower down, the whole mountain smoked, which I thought was the consequence of the returning warmth of the sun, for my thermometer now stood at nine degrees of heat.  I have noticed the same circumstance often on unvolcanic mountains.  The spots from which the smoke rose were also cold.\\n\\nThe smooth jet-black, bright, and dense lava is only found on the mountain itself and in its immediate vicinity.  But all lava is not the same:  there is jagged, glassy, and porous lava; the former is black, and so is the sand which covers one side of Hecla.  The farther the lava and sand are from the mountain, the more they lose this blackness, and their colour plays into iron-colour and even into light-grey; but the lighter-coloured lava generally retains the brightness and smoothness of the black lava.\\n\\nAfter a troublesome descent, having spent twelve hours on this excursion, we arrived safely at Salsun; and I was on the point of returning to my lodging, somewhat annoyed at the prospect of spending another night in such a hole, when my guide surprised me agreeably by the proposition to return to Struvellir at once.  The horses, he said, were sufficiently rested, and I could get a good room there in the priest's house.  I soon packed, and in a short time we were again on horseback.  The second time I came to the deep Rangaa, I rode across fearlessly, and needed no protection at any side.  Such is man:  danger only alarms him the first time; when he has safely surmounted it once, he scarcely thinks of it the second time, and wonders how he can have felt any fear.\\n\\nI saw five little trees standing in a field near the stream.  The stems of these, which, considering the scarcity of trees in Iceland, may be called remarkable phenomena, were crooked and knotty, but yet six or seven feet high, and about four or five inches in diameter.\\n\\nAs my guide had foretold, I found a very comfortable room and a good bed in the priest's house.  Herr Horfuson is one of the best men I have ever met with.  He eagerly sought opportunities for giving me pleasure, and to him I owe several fine minerals and an Icelandic book of the year 1601.  May God reward his kindness and benevolence!\\n\\nJuly 1st.\\n\\nWe retraced our steps as far as the river Huitha, over which we rowed, and then turned in another direction.  Our journey led us through beautiful valleys, many of them producing abundance of grass; but unfortunately so much moss grew among it, that these large plains were not available for pastures, and only afforded comfort to travellers by their aspect of cheerfulness.  They were quite dry.\\n\\nThe valley in which Hjalmholm, our resting-place for this night, was situated, is traversed by a stream of lava, which had, however, been modest enough not to fill up the whole valley, but to leave a space for the pretty stream Elvas, and for some fields and hillocks, on which many cottages stood.  It was one of the most populous valleys I had seen in Iceland.\\n\\nHjalmholm is situated on a hill.  In it lives the Sysselmann of the Rangaar district, in a large and beautiful house such as I saw no where in Iceland except in Reikjavik.  He had gone to the capital of the island as member of the Allthing; but his daughters received me very hospitably and kindly.\\n\\nWe talked and chatted much; I tried to display my knowledge of the Danish language before them, and must often have made use of curious phrases, for the girls could not contain their laughter.  But that did not abash me; I laughed with them, applied to my dictionary, which I carried with me, and chatted on.  They seemed to gather no very high idea of the beauty of my countrywomen from my personal appearance; for which I humbly crave the forgiveness of my countrywomen, assuring them that no one regrets the fact more than I do.  But dame Nature always treats people of my years very harshly, and sets a bad example to youth of the respect due to age.  Instead of honouring us and giving us the preference, she patronises the young folks, and every maiden of sixteen can turn up her nose at us venerable matrons.  Besides my natural disqualifications, the sharp air and the violent storms to which I had been subjected had disfigured my face very much.  They had affected me more than the burning heat of the East.  I was very brown, my lips were cracked, and my nose, alas, even began to rebel against its ugly colour.  It seemed anxious to possess a new, dazzling white, tender skin, and was casting off the old one in little bits.\\n\\nThe only circumstance which reinstated me in the good opinion of the young girls was, that having brushed my hair unusually far out of my face, a white space became visible.  The girls all cried out simultaneously, quite surprised and delighted:  \\\"Hun er quit\\\" (she is white).  I could not refrain from laughing, and bared my arm to prove to them that I did not belong to the Arab race.\\n\\nA great surprise was destined me in this house; for, as I was ransacking the Sysselmann's book-case, I found Rotteck's Universal History, a German Lexicon, and several poems and writings of German poets.\\n\\nJuly 2d.\\n\\nThe way from Kalmannstunga to Thingvalla leads over nothing but lava, and the one to-day went entirely through marshes.  As soon as we had crossed one, another was before us.  Lava seemed to form the soil here, for little portions of this mineral rose like islands out of the marshes.\\n\\nThe country already grew more open, and we gradually lost sight of the glaciers.  The high mountains on the left seemed like hills in the distance, and the nearer ones were really hills.  After riding about nine miles we crossed the large stream of Elvas in a boat, and then had to tread carefully across a very long, narrow bank, over a meadow which was quite under water.  If a traveller had met us on this bank, I do not know what we should have done; to turn round would have been as dangerous as to sink into the morass. Fortunately one never meets any travellers in Iceland.\\n\\nBeyond the dyke the road runs for some miles along the mountains and hills, which all consist of lava, and are of a very dark, nearly black colour.  The stones on these hills were very loose; in the plain below many colossal pieces were lying, which must have fallen down; and many others threatened to fall every moment.  We passed the dangerous spot safely, without having had to witness such a scene.\\n\\nI often heard a hollow sound among these hills; I at first took it for distant thunder, and examined the horizon to discover the approaching storm.  But when I saw neither clouds nor lightning, I perceived that I must seek the origin of the sounds nearer, and that they proceeded from the falling portions of rock.\\n\\nThe higher mountains to the left fade gradually more and more from view; but the river Elvas spreads in such a manner, and divides into so many branches, that one might mistake it for a lake with many islands.  It flows into the neighbouring sea, whose expanse becomes visible after surmounting a few more small hills.\\n\\nThe vale of Reikum, which we now entered, is, like that of Reikholt, rich in hot springs, which are congregated partly in the plain, partly on or behind the hills, in a circumference of between two and three miles.\\n\\nWhen we had reached the village of Reikum I sent my effects at once to the little church, took a guide, and proceeded to the boiling springs.  I found very many, but only two remarkable ones; these, however, belong to the most noteworthy of their kind.  The one is called the little Geyser, the other the Bogensprung.\\n\\nThe little Geyser has an inner basin of about three feet diameter. The water boils violently at a depth of from two to three feet, and remains within its bounds till it begins to spout, when it projects a beautiful voluminous steam of from 20 to 30 feet high.\\n\\nAt half-past eight in the evening I had the good fortune to see one of these eruptions, and needed not, as I had done at the great Geyser, to bivouac near it for days and nights.  The eruption lasted some time, and was tolerably equable; only sometimes the column of water sank a little, to rise to its former height with renewed force.  After forty minutes it fell quite down into the basin again. The stones we threw in, it rejected at once, or in a few seconds, shivered into pieces, to a height of about 12 to 15 feet.  Its bulk must have been 1 to 1.5 feet in diameter.  My guide assured me that this spring generally plays only twice, rarely thrice, in twenty- four hours, and not, as I have seen it stated, every six minutes.  I remained near it till midnight, but saw no other eruption.\\n\\nThis spring very much resembles the Strukker near the great Geyser, the only difference being that the water sinks much lower in the latter.\\n\\nThe second of the two remarkable springs, the arched spring, is situated near the little Geyser, on the declivity of a hill.  I had never seen such a curious formation for the bed of a spring as this is.  It has no basin, but lies half open at your feet, in a little grotto, which is separated into various cavities and holes, and which is half-surrounded by a wall of rock bending over it slightly at a height of about 2 feet, and then rises 10 to 12 feet higher. This spring never is at rest more than a minute; then it begins to rise and boil quickly, and emits a voluminous column, which, striking against the projecting rock, is flattened by it, and rises thence like an arched fan.  The height of this peculiarly-spread jet of water may be about 12 feet, the arch it describes 15 to 20 feet, and its breadth 3 to 8 feet.  The time of eruption is often longer than that of repose.  After an eruption the water always sinks a few feet into the cave, and for 15 or 20 seconds admits of a glance into this wonderful grotto.  But it rises again immediately, fills the grotto and the basin, which is only a continuation of the grotto, and springs again.\\n\\nI watched this miraculous play of nature for more than an hour, and could not tear myself from it.  This spring, which is certainly the only one of its kind, gratified me much more than the little Geyser.\\n\\nThere is another spring called the roaring Geyser; but it is nothing more than a misshapen hole, in which one hears the water boil, but cannot see it.  The noise is, also, not at all considerable.\\n\\nJuly 3d.\\n\\nNear Reikum we crossed a brook into which all the hot springs flow, and which has a pretty fall.  We then ascended the adjoining mountain, and rode full two hours on the high plain.  The plain itself was monotonous, as it was only covered with lava-stones and moss, but the prospect into the valley was varied and beautiful. Vale and sea were spread before me, and I saw the Westmann Islands, with their beautiful hills, which the envious clouds had concealed from me on the Hecla, lying in the distance.  Below me stood some houses in the port-town, Eierbach, and near them the waters of the Elvas flow into the sea.\\n\\nAt the end of this mountain-level a valley was situated, which was also filled with lava, but with that jagged black lava which presents such a beautiful appearance.  Immense streams crossed it from all sides, so that it almost resembled a black lake separated from the sea by a chain of equally black mountains.\\n\\nWe descended into this sombre vale through piles of lava and fields of snow, and went on through valleys and chasms, over fields of lava, plains of meadow-land, past dark mountains and hills, till we reached the chief station of my Icelandic journey, the town of Reikjavik.\\n\\nThe whole country between Reikum and Reikjavik, a distance of 45 to 50 miles, is, for the most part, uninhabited.  Here and there, in the fields of lava, stand little pyramids of the same substance, which serve as landmarks; and there are two houses built for such persons as are obliged to travel during the winter.  But we found much traffic on the road, and often overtook caravans of 15 to 20 horses.  Being the beginning of August, it was the time of trade and traffic in Iceland.  Then the country people travel to Reikjavik from considerable distances, to change their produce and manufactures, partly for money, partly for necessaries and luxuries. At this period the merchants and factors have not hands enough to barter the goods or close the accounts which the peasants wish to settle for the whole year.\\n\\nAt this season an unusual commotion reigns in Reikjavik.  Numerous groups of men and horses fill the streets; goods are loaded and unloaded; friends who have not met for a year or more welcome each other, others take leave.  On one spot curious tents {44} are erected, before which children play; on another drunken men stagger along, or gallop on horseback, so that one is terrified, and fears every moment to see them fall.\\n\\nThis unusual traffic unfortunately only lasts six or eight days. The peasant hastens home to his hay-harvest; the merchant must quickly regulate the produce and manufactures he has purchased, and load his ships with them, so that they may sail and reach their destination before the storms of the autumnal equinox.\\n\\n```\\n                               Miles.\\n```\\n\\nFrom Reikjavik to Thingvalla is     45 From Thingvalla to the Geyser       36 From the Geyser to Skalholt         28 From Skalholt to Salsun             36 From Salsun to Struvellir            9 From Struvellir to Hjalmholm        28 From Hjalmholm to Reikum            32 From Reikum to Reikjavik            45                                    259\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\",\"timestamp\":1637496327,\"title\":\"\\nAs I had now seen the Geyser play so often and so beautifully\"},\"digest\":\"CfTqlOH8tFefGn-Dd7usSwCjPXbj5w55YY64_zYrgWE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9DC92730677fd3244eD267F4e8bDd94201A144f8\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jlUd3uRx_l0Q-gjRY9uSL2xzcm0lYdR4no25XP5nkhk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FJn_wp1wpphOQJx6wfFGdkE_mhJYnn903Gv69BSne24\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ubSa3ccjN9GQeHzFCnlmYSxHTGtesp-BUBn2bjcwttbDnPxoiRCAn-KJ-pauzkg_RHZi6sKoXqsNQGhRQSuifw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x033917105ec111a6e919637d9715b8f1b7874220fd5aa49a43b210e5702335df4895ac326dfd7c7c5aad480e6d59264edd6401b10301f9ecbb4a6aef621f57881c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jlUd3uRx_l0Q-gjRY9uSL2xzcm0lYdR4no25XP5nkhk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FJn_wp1wpphOQJx6wfFGdkE_mhJYnn903Gv69BSne24\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"CfTqlOH8tFefGn-Dd7usSwCjPXbj5w55YY64_zYrgWE\"}"
