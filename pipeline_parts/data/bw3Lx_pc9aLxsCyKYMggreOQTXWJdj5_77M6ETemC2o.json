"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Reminder: What is Raca DAO?\\n\\nRaca DAO’s purpose is simple: to be the voice of the Binance Smartchain network’s active users through on and off-chain governance, launched as a decentralized autonomous organization with a free and fair initial distribution 100x bigger than the original DAO. The eligible wallets form a broad union of the most active users in Defi, GameFi and NFTs, giving Raca DAO the potential to be one of the most diverse and impactful communities in the history of GameFi — The Potential is Limitless. We aim to represent the views of the most active Binance Smartchain network users to the core Binance Smartchain developers and Binance Smartchain Foundation.\\n\\n# Roadmap\\n\\nThe Raca DAO is first one GameFi Dao in Binance Smartchain network, We do urge you, however, to keep in mind that the purpose and goals of Raca DAO are continuously evolving.\\n\\n### High-level goals\\n\\n* Become the largest, most diverse DAO on Smartchain network\\n* Represent the views of the Smartchain network users to the core Smartchain network developers and Smartchain Foundation\\n* Make up Raca's losses\\n\\n# On-chain Governance Process\\n\\nWhile Snapshot polls are great for one-off polling of the community, ultimately the real governance happens with the on-chain Governor and Treasury. The steps to getting a proposal approved on-chain are:\\n\\n* **Heat check**: The first step in getting a proposal to be executed on-chain is to post a Heat check on Snapshot. This proposal should be general, asking a question, or proposing an action the DAO should take. If the heat check gains traction, one of our contributors can post it on your behalf. This is to gauge interest in your proposal. Eventually, we will be releasing a Discourse-like forum for governance-related discussion where you need to hold a small amount of RDAO tokens to make posts.\\n* **Consensus check**: After the heat check passes, you can publish a Consensus Check on Snapshot. This should include the full details of the proposal, including rationale, execution, pros, and cons, and the full on-chain proposal parameters.\\n* **On-chain check**: After passing the consensus check, the proposal can be made on-chain. In the coming days, you can use Tally and Boardroom to delegate and cast votes.\\n\\nWhile ultimately the on-chain governance is completely decentralized and permissionless, we urge everyone to go through the process above.\\n\\n# RDAO Staking\\n\\nGoing forward, we want to ensure that RDAO is owned by the most active Binance Smartchain NFT, Defi, and GameFi users. To this end, we plan on launching a RDAO staking contract where you can stake your RDAO for wRDAO. While it’s staked you will be continuously earning a refund for the gas you spend determined by a formula. After several months of the staking contract being launched, we will launch a proposal that begins the airdrop to those who have staked.\\n\\n# Socials\\n\\nGo claim your allocation by visiting our [claim website](https://www.racadao.org/), get involved by joining the [Telegram](https://t.me/raca_dao), and support us on social media by engaging with [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RACADAO2021).\",\"timestamp\":1641452865,\"title\":\"Raca DAO Roadmap\"},\"digest\":\"I05PX2-0WwQ5cmBaAyaz6BjQWYgRGc_FyeLI19iSguo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x054c44d3719d02bF4dfd44e2DfEC91FF30D82E99\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qC1UqYi9hy0s5i19eLN9wvlrv1jasEaoDduvZTqyXBI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QuGvwTM60Fmnt4Dp7Tky_sCBG6tPuwpeGNAA2LlDvDk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ujcsQj5T_jqO9a9tiFV6GkVtUXBCdoIKscH7v8T1W1JhAGZtahLiKrp24t5zWgFYkQZxw6dvS1eorWUAcQteBg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1b92d0163bbe67689b5cf77b73457d53d7496f4debd023d6ff7b8d527f36f3c373307a3cba3281165a916e424f785b0632ecfa76ef35c96f8c147b8a869334ce1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qC1UqYi9hy0s5i19eLN9wvlrv1jasEaoDduvZTqyXBI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QuGvwTM60Fmnt4Dp7Tky_sCBG6tPuwpeGNAA2LlDvDk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"mXhNiGa0oWrVC3IuBPLq92Q6kNRpi_PnMO7HITlUgWM\"}"
