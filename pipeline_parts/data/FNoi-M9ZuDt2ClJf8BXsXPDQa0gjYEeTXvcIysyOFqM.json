"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\" Well,\\\" said Mrs. Wainwright, sullen and ominous, \\\" time will tell! Time will tell!\\\"\\n\\nWhen Coleman bad turned from the fleeing Peter Tounley again to Marjory, he found her making the preliminary movements of a flight. \\\"What's the matter? \\\" he demanded anxiously.\\n\\n\\\" Oh, it's too dreadful\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Nonsense,\\\" lie retorted stoutly. \\\" Only Peter Tounley! He don't count. What of that ? \\\"\\n\\n' Oh, dear! \\\" She pressed her palm to a burning cheek. She gave him a star-like, beseeching glance. Let me go now-please.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Well,\\\" he answered, somewhat affronted, \\\" if you like--\\\"\\n\\nAt the door she turned to look at him, and this glance expressed in its elusive way a score of things which she had not yet been able to speak. It explained that she was loth to leave him, that she asked forgiveness for leaving him, that even for a short absence she wished to take his image in her eyes, that he must not bully her, that there was something now in her heart which frightened her, that she loved him, that she was happy---\\n\\nWhen she had gone, Coleman went to the rooms of the American minister. A Greek was there who talked wildly as he waved his cigarette. Coleman waited in well-concealed impatience for the dvapora- tion of this man. Once the minister, regarding the correspondent hurriedly, interpolated a comment. \\\" You look very cheerful ? \\\"\\n\\n\\\" Yes,\\\" answered Coleman, \\\" I've been taking your advice.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Oh, ho ! \\\" said the minister.\\n\\nThe Greek with the cigarette jawed endlessly. Coleman began to marvel at the enduring good man- ners of the minister, who continued to nod and nod in polite appreciation of the Greek's harangue, which, Coleman firmly believed, had no point of interest whatever. But at last the man, after an effusive farewell, went his way.\\n\\n\\\" Now,\\\" said the minister, wheeling in his chair tell me all about it.\\\"\\n\\nColeman arose, and thrusting his hands deep in his trousers' pockets, began to pace the room with long strides. He, said nothing, but kept his eyes on the floor.\\n\\n\\\" Can I have a drink ? \\\" he asked, abruptly pausing.\\n\\n\\\" What would you like? \\\" asked the minister, benevolently, as he touched the bell.\\n\\n\\\" A brandy and soda. I'd like it very much. You see,\\\" he said, as he resumed his walk, \\\" I have no kind of right to burden you with my affairs, but, to tell the truth, if I don't get this news off my mind and into somebody's ear, I'll die. It's this-I asked Marjory Wainwright to marry me, and-she accepted, and- that's all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Well, I am very glad,\\\" cried the minister, arising and giving his hand. \\\"And as for burdening me with your affairs, no one has a better right, you know, since you released me from the persecution of Washington and the friends of the Wainwrights. May good luck follow you both forever. You, in my opinion, are a very, very fortunate man. And, for her part she has not done too badly.\\\"\\n\\nSeeing that it was important that Coleman should have his spirits pacified in part, the minister continued: \\\" Now, I have got to write an official letter, so you just walk up and down here and use up this surplus steam. Else you'll explode.\\\"\\n\\nBut Coleman was not to be detained. Now that he had informed the minister, he must rush off some. where, anywhere, and do-he knew not what.\\n\\nAll right,\\\" said the minister, laughing. \\\" You have a wilder head than I thought. But look here,\\\" he called, as Coleman was making for the door. \\\" Am I to keep this news a secret? \\\"\\n\\nColeman with his hand on the knob, turned im. pressively. He spoke with deliberation. \\\" As far as I am concerned, I would be glad to see a man paint it in red letters, eight feet high, on the front of the king's palace.\\\"\\n\\nThe minister, left alone, wrote steadily and did not even look up when Peter Tounley and two others entered, in response to his cry of permission. How ever, he presently found time to speak over his shoulder to them. \\\"Hear the news?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, sir,\\\" they answered.\\n\\n\\\" Well, be good boys, now, and read the papers and look at pictures until I finish this letter. Then I will tell you.\\\"\\n\\nThey surveyed him keenly. They evidently judged that the news was worth hearing, but, obediently, they said nothing. Ultimately the minister affixed a rapid signature to the letter, and turning, looked at the students with a smile. \\\" Haven't heard the news, eh ?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, Sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, Marjory Wainwright is engaged to marry Coleman.\\\"\\n\\nThe minister was amazed to see the effect of this announcement upon the three students. He had expected the crows and cackles of rather absurd merriment with which unbearded youth often greets, such news. But there was no crow or cackle. One young man blushed scarlet and looked guiltily at the floor. With a great effort he muttered: \\\" Shes too good for him.\\\" Another student had turned ghastly pate and was staring. It was Peter Tounley who relieved  the minister's mind, for upon that young man's face was a broad jack-o-lantern grin, and the minister saw that, at any rate, he had not made a complete massacre.\\n\\nPeter Tounley said triumphantly: \\\"I knew it ! \\\"\\n\\nThe minister was anxious over the havoc he had wrought with the two other students, but slowly the colour abated in one face and grew in the other.  To give them opportunity, the minister talked busily to Peter Tounley. \\\"And how did you know it, you young scamp ?\\\"\\n\\nPeter was jubilant. \\\" Oh, -I knew it! I knew it I I am very clever.\\\"\\n\\nThe student who had blushed now addressed the minister in a slightly strained voice. \\\" Are you positive that it is true, Mr. Gordner?,\\\"\\n\\n\\\" I had it on the best authority,\\\" replied the minister gravely.\\n\\nThe student who had turned pale said: \\\" Oh, it's true, of course.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Well,\\\" said crudely the one who had blushed, she's a great sight too good for Coleman or anybody like him. That's all I've got to say.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Oh, Coleman is a good fellow,\\\" said Peter Tounley, reproachfully. \\\" You've no right to say that-exactly. You don't know where you'd. be now if it were not for Coleman.\\\"\\n\\nThe, response was, first, an angry gesture. \\\" Oh, don't keep everlasting rubbing that in.  For heaven's sake, let up. - Supposing I don't. know where I'd be now if,it were not for Rufus Coleman? What of it? For the rest of my life have I got to--\\\"\\n\\nThe minister saw. that this was the embittered speech of a really defeated youth, so, to save scenes, he gently ejected the trio. \\\" There, there, now ! Run along home like good boys. I'll be busy until luncheon. And I -dare say you won't find Coleman such a bad chap.\\\"'\\n\\nIn the corridor, one of the students said offensively to Peter Tounley : \\\" Say, how in hell did you find out all this so early ? \\\"\\n\\nPeter's reply was amiable in tone. \\\" You are a damned bleating little kid and you made a holy show of yourself before Mr. Gordner. There's where you stand.  Didn't you see that he turned us out because he didn't know but what you were going to blubber or something. - you are a sucking pig, and if you want to know how I find out things go ask the Delphic  Oracle, you blind ass.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" You better look out or you may get a punch in the eye!,\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You take one punch in the general direction of my eye, me son,\\\" said -Peter cheerfully, \\\" and I'll  distribute your remains, over this hotel in a way that will cause your, friends years of trouble to collect you. Instead of anticipating an attack upon my eye, you had much better be engaged in improving your mind, which is at present not a fit machine to cope with exciting situations. There's Coke! Hello, Coke, hear the news? Well, Marjory Wainwright and Rufus Coleman , are engaged.. Straight ? Certainly ! Go ask the minister.\\\"\\n\\nCoke did not take Peter's word. \\\"Is that so ? \\\" he asked the others.\\n\\n\\\" So the minister told us,\\\" they answered, and then these two, who seemed so unhappy, watched Coke's face to see if they could not find surprised misery there. But Coke coolly said: \\\" Well, then, I suppose it's true.\\\"\\n\\nIt soon became evident that the students did not care for each other's society.  Peter Tounley was probably an exception, but the others seemed to long for quiet corners. They were distrusting each other, and, in a boyish way, they were even capable of maligant things. Their excuses for separation were badly made.\\n\\n\\\"I-I think I'll go for a walk.\\\" \\\" I'm going up stairs to read.\\\" \\\" Well, so long, old man.' \\\" So long.\\\" There was no heart to it.\\n\\nPeter Tounley went to Coleman's door, where he knocked with noisy hilarity. \\\" Come in I \\\" The correspondent apparently had just come from the street, for his hat was on his head and a light top-coat was on his back. He was searching hurriedly through some, papers. \\\" Hello, you young devil What are you doing here ?\\n\\nPeter's entrance was a somewhat elaborate comedy which Coleman watched in icy silence. Peter after a long,and impudent pantomime halted abruptly and fixing Coleman with his eye demanded: \\\"Well?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well-what?.\\\" said Coleman, bristling a trifle.\\n\\n\\\" Is it true ?\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Is what true ?\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Is it true? \\\" Peter was extremely solemn. \\\" Say, me bucko,\\\" said Coleman suddenly, \\\" if you've. come up here to twist the beard of the patriarch, don't you think you are running a chance? \\\"\\n\\n\\\"All right. I'll be good,\\\" said Peter, and he sat on the bed. \\\" But-is it true?\\n\\n\\\" Is what true? \\\"\\n\\n\\\" What the whole hotel is saying.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1638929941,\"title\":\"The professor crashed his hand down on the table. \\\"Mary!
