"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Located in the foothills of Alaska's snowy mountains, the Temple of Odi is one of 19 great temples on the continent dedicated to the supreme god of creation.The entire temple is built of ivory marble, the front of the temple is 24 two people embrace marble pillars, carved full of praise to the creation of god and his followers.On the top of the temple stands an angel statue, whose wings radiate a soft milky magic light, enveloping the whole temple.\\n\\nCardinal Brune closed the evening service by slowly closing the Holy Prayer before him.The choir of holy ladies in white retired silently, and the lofty hymns seemed to reverberate in the air.Gazing at the flame on the altar, Bren had unprovoked fretting and palpitations.\\n\\nAt fifty-five, brune was not young among the twenty-three cardinals of the Holy Church, and was less than average in illuminance, but the Pope favored him so much that he was appointed to supervise the Temple of Udi.As the most influential religion on the continent, the Holy Church has tens of millions of followers, and the authority of the Pope is recognized by all the great empires and can even appoint the Kings of some small countries.It took sixteen years for the Temple of Odi to be built. On the day of its completion, thousands of horns sounded in the sky, petals fell like rain, and white holy light came down from the sky. An angel with wings on his back appeared in the holy light, and blessed the temple with divine art \\\"Angel blessing\\\".Also became the only temple in the nineteen temples in addition to the Pope in the temple of light god only completed when god shows the miracle of the temple.\\n\\nBren was pondering his own uneasiness.Fifteen miles from the temple lies Purport, the second largest commercial port on the mainland.Each year Purport gave five percent of its revenue to the Holy Church, and Bullen had access to a third of this vast wealth.\\n\\n\\\"The day of offering is drawing near again. There should be two million gold pieces offered this year.I dare the fat Lord Phil to deceive his Lord about his wealth.\\\"Bren had no heart for sleep that night.\\\"Is it the necromancer's curse?\\n\\nSix months ago, Cardinal Bren led 300 Knights of the Temple and 20 grand Lords into the Alaskan Mountains, destroying a necraunch and his army of undead who had been hiding there.The mage is not good enough, and there are no more than 3000 undead, including skeletons.The extermination was more of a tour.Bren casts level 6 divine Cleansing himself and watches the Necromancer burn in the holy light and disappear.The sorcerer's deathbed curse is not in Brune's mind, and it was dispelled by the oracle around him before it had any effect.\\n\\nWhen the moon Mordis had passed through the air, Brune finally confirmed the annoyance in his heart.Yes, the virgin Weena who came to the temple today.The sculptural face, tall and straight small nose, knife carved like lips, everywhere full of divine breath.\\\"That's an angel,\\\" Bren said to himself.Saint Weena grew up with the Pope. No one knows where she came from.For the first time in 17 years, she stepped outside the Temple of Light.The curves beneath her white dress seemed to be right in Front of Bren's eyes.His mouth felt dry, and there was no water around him.With a low curse, he stood up and walked out of the temple.\\n\\nThe sacred white robe beneath The ice of Weena's neck could not conceal the slightest movement from the faint ripples.And that wave seemed to grow in Brune's eyes and burned his nerves.For the first time, Bren even kind of wished he was a thief, so he could...Bren smiled wryly. No thief could defeat a level 16 light mage. He had been a level 13 light mage in the church for 40 years.\\n\\nHe looked up at the moon and saw that there was a streak of blood red in it tonight.Brune was surprised, and before he could recover, the light of the temple vanished in a flash of darkness.Darkness is definitely one of Bren's pet hates.He restrained his panic and began to sing in a low voice, tracing complicated symbols with his fingers, preparing for the third level of magic, holy Light.In addition to exorcising evil, this spell can also be used temporarily as illumination.Silently, a black hand, etched with countless symbols, or rather, a hand bone, touched Bren's throat from behind.With a gentle swipe of his index finger, Bren never had a chance to cast the light.\\n\\nA knight in full armor stood over Bullen's body.Dark black body armor, black flame burning two-handed longsword, only the grip of the hand to show that it was a skeleton.With a silent cry from the armor, thousands of skeleton warriors came out of the darkness and swarmed toward the temple.Every now and then an undead knight on a flame-bone horse would burst out of the darkness and disappear into the temple knights' barracks on either side of the church.\\n\\n\\\"What is this!!Guards!Get up!!\\\"With a stir, the Knights of the Temple woke up.There are 400 knights in the Temple of Udi.The quick knights were trained to wear simple armor, and some of them would fight to the death at the gate of the camp like an endless line of skeleton soldiers, while the others would quickly begin to arm themselves.Occasionally a priest has already cast spells.\\n\\nIn the dim light of the temple's great hall, the face of weena's ice sculpture showed no movement, staring coldly at the necromancer in front of her.The necromancer is wearing a black robe, which is not surprising, even though it is dotted with symbols and formations of faint magical light that suggest it is no ordinary robe.The strange thing about this robe is how neat and new it is.The necromancer's eye sockets burn with pale fire.\\n\\n\\\"My name is Rodriguez.\\\"A voice spoke directly to Verna.Beads of sweat appeared on the face of the ice statue. As far as she knew, with her own level 16 light mage's power, she was close to demigods.Does the necromancer's ability to break through his own mind and speak directly into his own mind mean that the spirit has become so powerful that it almost controls him?And the name, the most powerful necromancer of all, Rodriguez, is tainted by his wickedness even when thought of.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, and not only that.\\\"Rodriguez's voice rang in Weina's heart again.The necromancer's eyes were blazing, and a cold spirit burst through Weena's mind.Weena grunted and a trace of blood ran from her mouth.\\n\\n\\\"Let's see the true identity of the saint.\\\" One spiritual shock after another exploded directly in Weena's mind. Weena staggered and struggled, amazed at the unparalleled power of Rodriguez.\",\"timestamp\":1634808350,\"title\":\"Necromancer \"},\"digest\":\"A6ph0h4acIlu8qjzIvtx97TpkOBkaIWn2lzUYcOYlsk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x36f9BB516e58AAba56ae3C905573A1e94CE2cEcF\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"sVZ8NPzgB2lIZ08or9ztZyf-kARbEu6nVXUt64NSsA8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"A9J19wysyJG2_-CDQDo-fAEXIrOpj67QTQNhbjQ3gRg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"eRB3-9owd2iHvJq6lCrYaZhcbas4-wxHEB3-zugx0t7Z48NwMAUX2ldfsbpa46eBLtdWZZOeELm_oc1TY3cBLA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x7ff7acdc4677d206dcadb2349a7945bd666afe92fc7bf6ba363d5a5ce32289a74c6837d3745d32d4578753df782af256e84dc76a063690faf68e83411f0691641b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"sVZ8NPzgB2lIZ08or9ztZyf-kARbEu6nVXUt64NSsA8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"A9J19wysyJG2_-CDQDo-fAEXIrOpj67QTQNhbjQ3gRg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"A6ph0h4acIlu8qjzIvtx97TpkOBkaIWn2lzUYcOYlsk\"}"
