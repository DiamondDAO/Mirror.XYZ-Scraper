In fact, all problems are their own problems.\\n\\nFirst: Check for yourself whether you are pretentious, for example, look down on everyone around you in your heart and think you are the best. People's hearts are grown in flesh, and team members can feel it.\\n\\nSecond: The belief that other people's success is based on luck and accidental reasons, while one's own success is inevitable and depends on one's own efforts. Such a concept will cause everyone to be unwilling to help you.\\n\\nThird: I always feel that others are sorry for myself, and I am at a loss. This is purely a villain mentality.\\n\\nFourth: good face, always pretending to be in front of everyone, pretending to be untrue. No one wants to be friends with hypocritical people. No one likes such a leader. A boss with leadership must be a man of true temperament.\\n\\nFifth: I like to hide myself, don't interact with team members, and don't trust the team members to do things. Even if they do things, they don't fully delegate power. If you do this, team members will have no sense of accomplishment or presence, and of course the team’s combat effectiveness will not be strong.\\n\\nSixth: I am afraid that team members will compare themselves. I dare not admit that I am inferior to some excellent members of the team in some respects, and belong to the boss who is jealous and capable. Of course, if you are like this, there are no capable people to follow you, and even if there are, they will leave.\\n\\nThe boss who made these six mistakes is a heartless person. The cohesion of the team is naturally very poor. Of course, you, the boss, are not good at being a good boss. You should check yourself, and if there is any change, you will be encouraged.\\n\\nI will provide you with an idea for change. In fact, all questions are questions of position. You only need to completely change your position.\\n\\nYour own state of mind means that your purpose is to be a team member, not to do everything for yourself. In this way, everyone will be moved in tears, and the cohesiveness and combat effectiveness will immediately explode. but\\n\\n148 Entrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs\\n\\nIt should be noted that you must choose excellent people to be the core of your team.\\n\\nJudgment, got a few white-eyed wolves to follow yourself, and then you succeed him, you are injured, you can only\\n\\nIt shows that your brain is not working well!\",\"timestamp\":1634797723,\"title\":\"Why can't the cohesion of the team work?\"},\"digest\":\"u5itdPs2YSPzlSIffX8Cf5hVmlM7ZyHiwRvcpq1E8BU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"2aYE4kSzBvs_kIrpHayFOehqcH7Fp_hTDOQxHmFWMWRuwSI4H3sH_zuqmDhceHkmP0MKzk0Crehiqtnvbz_IkQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"u5itdPs2YSPzlSIffX8Cf5hVmlM7ZyHiwRvcpq1E8BU\"}"
