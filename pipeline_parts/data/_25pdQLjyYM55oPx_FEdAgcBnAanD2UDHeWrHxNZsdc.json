Up until now, we’ve been using both frameworks and our own home-brewed solutions, because working with classes in ES5 was a total pain. That always struck me as strange, because it was clear from the outset that ES5 was designed to support classes—in fact, the keyword `CLASS` was reserved. \\n\\nWhat this led to was arguments. Everyone turned to their favorite framework and used it to create an OOP interface.
