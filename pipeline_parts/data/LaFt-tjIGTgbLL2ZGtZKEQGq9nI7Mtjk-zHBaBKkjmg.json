"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The soft moonlight streamed down on the white-haired madman thundering at the door, screaming his war-song.\\n\\nThe quiet farmyard, startled from its sleep, awoke in an uproar. Cattle shifted in their stalls; horses whinnied; fowls chattered, aroused by the din and dull thudding of the blows:. and above the rest, loud and piercing, the. shrill cry of a terrified child.\\n\\nMaggie, wakened from a vivid dream of David chasing the police, hurried a shawl around her, and in a minute had the baby in her arms and was comforting her--vaguely fearing the while that the police were after David.\\n\\nJames Moore flung open a window, and, leaning out, looked down on the dishevelled figure below him.\\n\\nM'Adam heard the noise, glanced up, and saw his enemy. Straightway he ceased his attack on the door, and, running beneath the window, shook his weapon up at his foe.\\n\\n\\\"There ye are, are ye? Curse ye for a\\n\\n\\\\-coward! .'urse ye for a liar! Come doon, I say, James Moore! come doon--I daur ye to it! Aince and for a' let's settle oor account.\\\"\\n\\nThe Master, looking down from above, thought that at length the little man's brain had gone.\\n\\n\\\"What is't yo' want?\\\" he asked, as calmly as he could, hoping to gain time.\\n\\n\\\"What is't I want?\\\" screamed the madman. \\\"Hark to him! He crosses mi in ilka thing; he plot-s agin me; lie robs me o' ma Cup; he sets ma son agin me and pits him on to murder me! And in the end he--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Coom, then, coom! I'll--\\\\~---\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Gie me back the Cup ye stole, James Moore! Gie me back ma son ye've took from rue! And there's anither thing. What's yer gray dog doin'? Where's yer--\\\"\\n\\nThe Master interposed again:\\n\\n\\\"I'll coom doon and talk things over wi' yo'.\\\" he said soothingly. But before he could withdraw, M'Adam had jerked his weapon to his shoulder and aimed it full at his enemy's head.\\n\\nThe threatened man looked down the gun's great quivering mouth, wholly unmoved.\\n\\n\\\"Yo' mon hold it steadier, little mon, if yo'd hit!\\\" he said grimly. \\\"There, I'll cooni help yo'!\\\" He withdrew slowly; and all the-time was wondering where the gray dog was.\\n\\nIn another moment he was downstairs, un--doing the bolts and bars of the door. On the other side stood M'Adam, his blunderbuss at his shoulder, his finger trembling on the trigger, waiting.\\n\\n\\\"Hi, Master! Stop, or yo're dead!\\\" roared a voice from the loft on the other side the yard.\\n\\n\\\"Feyther! feyther! git yo' back!\\\" screamed Maggie, who saw it all from the window above-the door.\\n\\nTheir cries were too late! The blunderbuss. went off with a roar, belching out a storm of sparks and smoke. The shot peppered the door like hail, and the whole yard seemed for a moment wrapped in flame.\\n\\n\\\"Aw! oh! ma gummy! A'm waounded\\\\~ A'm a goner! A'm shot! 'Elp! Murder! Eh! Oh!\\\" bellowed a lusty voice--and it was. not James Moore's.\\n\\nThe little man, the cause of the uproar, lay-quite still upon the ground, with another figure standing over him. As he had stood, finger on trigger, waiting for that last bolt to be drawn, a gray form, shooting whence no one knew, had suddenly and silently attacked him from behind, and jerked him backward to the ground. With the shock of the fall the blunderbuss had gone off.\\n\\nThe last bolt was thrown back with a clatter, and the Master emerged. In a glance he took in the whole scene: the fallen man; the gray dog; the still-smoking weapon.\\n\\n\\\"Yo', was't Bob lad?\\\" he said. \\\"I was wonderin' wheer yo' were. Yo' came just at the reet moment, as yo' aye do!\\\" Then, in a loud voice, addressing the darkness: \\\"Yo're-not hurt, Sam'! Todd--I can tell that by yer-noise; it was nob'but the shot off the door warmed yo'. Coom away doon and gie me a hand.\\\"\\n\\nHe walked up to M'Adam, who still lay-gasping on the ground. The shock of the fall and recoil of the weapon had knocked the breath out of the little man's body; beyond that he was barely hurt.\\n\\nThe Master stood over his fallen enemy and looked sternly down at him.\\n\\n\\\"I've put up wi' more from you, M'Adam, than I would from ony other man, \\\" he said. \\\"But this is too much--comin' here at night -wi' loaded arms, scarin' the wimmen and childer oot o' their lives, and I can but think meanin' worse. If yo' were half a man I'd gie yo' the finest thrashin' iver yo' had in yer life. But, as yo' know well, I could no more hit yo' than I could a woman. Why yo've got this down on me yo' ken best. I niver did yo' or ony ither mon a harm. As to the Cup, I've got it and I'm goin' to do ma best to keep it--it's for yo' to win it from me if yo' can o' Thursday. As for what yo' say o' David, yo' know it's a lie. And as for what yo're drivin' at wi' yer hints and mysteries, I've no more idee than a babe unborn. Noo I'm goin' to lock yo' up, yo're not safe abroad. I'm thinkin' I'll ha' to hand ye o'er to the p'lice.\\\"\\n\\nWith the help of Sam'l he half dragged, half supported the stunned little man across the yard; and shoved him into a tiny semisubterraneous room, used for the storage of coal, at the end of the farm-buildings.\\n\\n\\\"Yo' think it over that side, ma lad,\\\" called the Master grimly, as he turned the key, \\\"and I will this.\\\" And with that he retired to bed.\\n\\nEarly in the morning he went to release his prisoner. But he was a minute too late. For scuttling down the slope and away was a little black-begrimed, tottering figure with white hair blowing in the wind. The little man had broken away a wooden hatchment which covered a manhole in the wall of his prison-house, squeezed his small body through, and so escaped.\\n\\n\\\"Happen it's as well,\\\" thought the Master, watching the flying figure. Then, \\\"Hi, Bob, lad!\\\" he called; for the gray dog, ears back, tail streaming, was hurling down the slope after the fugitive.\\n\\nOn the bridge M'Adam turned, and, seeing his pursuer hot upon him, screamed, missed his footing, and fell with a loud splash into the stream--almost in that identical spot into which, years before, he had plunged voluntarily to save Red Wull.\\n\\nOn the bridge Owd Bob halted and looked down at the man struggling in the water below. He made a half move as though to leap in to the rescue of his enemy; then, seeing it was unnecessary, turned and trotted back to his master.\\n\\n\\\"Yo' nob'but served him right, I'm think-in',\\\" said the Master. \\\"Like as not he came here wi' the intent to mak' an end to yo.' Well, after Thursday, I pray God we'll ha' peace. It's gettin' above a joke.\\\" The two turned back into the yard.\\n\\nBut down below them, along the edge of the stream, for the second time in this story, a little dripping figure was tottering homeward. The little man was crying--the hot tears mmgling on his cheeks with the undried waters of the Wastrel--crying with rage, mortification, weariness.\\n\\nChapter XXV  THE SHEPHERDS' TROPHY\\n\\nCup Day.\\n\\nIt broke calm and beautiful, no cloud on the horizon, no threat of storm in the air; a fitting day on which the Shepherds' Trophy must be won outright.\\n\\nAnd well it was so. For never since the founding of the Dale Trials had such a concourse been gathered together on the North bank of the Silver Lea. From the Highlands they came; from the far Campbell country; from the Peak; from the county of many acres; from all along the silver fringes of the Soiway; assembling in that quiet corner of the earth to see the famous Gray Dog of Ken-muir fight his last great battle for the Shepherds' Trophy.\\n\\nBy noon the gaunt Scaur looked down on such a gathering as it had never seen. The paddock at the back of the Dalesman's Daughter was packed with a clammering, chattering multitude: animated groups of farmers; bevies of solid rustics; sharp-faced townsmen; loud-voiced bookmakers; giggling girls; amorous boys,--thrown together like toys in a sawdust bath; whilst here and there, on the outskirts of the crowd, a lonely man and wise-faced dog, come from afar to wrest his proud title from the best sheep-dog in the North.\\n\\nAt the back of the enclosure was drawn up a formidale array of carts and carriages, varying as much in quality and character as did their owners. There was the squire's landau rubbing axle-boxes with Jem Burton's modest moke-cart; and there Viscount Birdsaye's flaring barouche side by side with the red-wheeled wagon of Kenmuir.\\n\\nIn the latter, Maggie, sad and sweet in her simple summer garb, leant over to talk to Lady Eleanour; while golden-haired wee Anne, delighted with the surging crowd around, trotted about the wagon, waving to her friends, and shouting from very joyousness.\\n\\nThick as flies clustered that motley assembly on the north bank of the Silver Lea. While on the other side the stream was a little group of judges, inspecting the course.\\n\\nThe line laid out ran thus: the sheep must first be found in the big enclosure to the right of the starting flag; then up the slope and away from the spectators; around a flag and obliquely down the hill again; through a gap in the wall; along the hillside, parrallel to the Silver Lea; abruptly to the left through a pair of flags--the trickiest turn of them all; then down the slope to the pen, which was set up close to the bridge over the stream.\\n\\nThe proceedings began with the Local Stakes, won by Rob Saunderson's veteran, Shep. There followed the Open Juveniles, carried off by Ned Hoppin's young dog. It was late in the afternoon when, at length, the great event of the meeting was reached.\\n\\nIn the enclosure behind the Dalesman's Daughter the clamor of the crowd increased tenfold, and the yells of the bookmakers were redoubled.\\n\\n\\\"Walk up, gen'lemen, walk up! the ole firm! Rasper? Yessir-- twenty to one bar two! Twenty to one bar two! Bob? What price Bob? Even money, sir--no, not a penny longer, couldn't do it! Red Wull? 'oo says Red Wull?\\\"\\n\\nOn the far side the stream is clustered about the starting flag the finest array of sheep-dogs ever seen together.\\n\\n\\\"I've never seen such a field, and I've seen fifty,\\\" is Parson Leggy's verdict.\\n\\nThere, beside the tall form of his master, stands Owd Bob o' Kenmuir, the observed of all. His silvery brush fans the air, and he holds his dark head high as he scans his challengers, proudly conscious that to-day will make or mar his fame. Below him, the meanlooking, smooth-coated black dog is the tinbeaten Pip, winner of the renowned Cambrian Stakes at Liangollen--as many think the best of all the good dogs that have come from sheep-dotted Wales. Beside him that handsome sable collie, with the tremendous coat. and slash of white on throat and face, is the famous MacCallum More, fresh from his victory at the Highland meeting. The cobby, brown dog, seeming of many breeds, is from the land o' the Tykes--Merry, on whom the Yorkshiremen are laying as though they loved him. And Jess, the wiry black-and-tan, is the favorite of the men of of the Derwent and Dove. Tupper's big blue Rasper is there; Londes-\\\\~ ley's Lassie; and many more--too many t& mention: big and small, grand and mean, smooth and rough--and not a bad dog there.\\n\\nAnd alone, his back to the others, stands a little bowed, conspicuous figure--Adam M'Adam; while the great dog beside him, a hideous incarnation of scowling defiance, is. Red Wull, the Terror o' the Border.\\n\\nThe Tailless Tyke had already run up his. fighting colors. For MacCallum More, going up to examine this forlorn great adversary, had conceived for him a violent antip-. athy, and, straightway, had spun at him with all the fury of the Highland cateran, who at-\\\\~ tacks first and explains afterward. Red Wull, forthwith, had turned on him with savage, silent gluttony; bob-tailed Rasper was racing up to join in the attack; and in another second the three would have been locked inseparably--but just in time M'Adam intervened. One of the judges came hurrying up.\\n\\n\\\"Mr. M'Adam,\\\" he cried angrily. \\\"if that brute of yours gets fighting again, hang me if I don't disqualify him! Only last year at the Trials he killed the young Cossack dog.\\\"\\n\\nA dull flash of passion swept across M'Adam's face. \\\"Come here, Wullic!\\\" he called. \\\"Gin yon Hielant tyke attacks ye agin, ye're to be disqualified.\\\"\\n\\nHe was unheeded. The battle for the Cup had begun--little Pip leading the dance.\\n\\nOn the opposite slope the babel had subsided now. Hucksters left their wares, and bookmakers their stools, to watch the struggle. Every eye was intent on the moving figures of man and dog and three sheep over the stream.\\n\\nOne after one the competitors ran their course and penned their sheep--there was no single failure. And all received their just meed of applause, save only Adam M'Adam's Red Wull.\\n\\nLast of all, when Owd Bob trotted out to uphold his title, there went up such a shout as made Maggie's wan cheeks to blush with pleasure, and wee Anne to scream right lustily.\\n\\nHis was an incomparable exhibition. Sheep should be humored rather than hurried; coaxed, rather than coerced. And that sheepdog has attained the summit of his art who subdues his own personality and leads his sheep in pretending to be led. Well might the bosoms of the Dalesmen swell with pride as they watched their favorite at his work; well might Tammas pull out that hackneyed phrase, \\\"The brains of a mon and the way of a woman\\\"; well might the crowd bawl their enthusiasm, and Long Kirby puff his cheeks and rattle the money in his trouser pockets.\\n\\nBut of this part it is enough to say that Pip, Owd Bob, and Red Wull were selected to fight out the struggle afresh.\\n\\nThe course was altered and stiffened. On the far side the stream it remained as before; up the slope; round a flag; down the hill again; through the gap in the wall; along the hillside; down through the two flags; turn; and to the stream again. But the pen was removed from its former position, carried over the bridge, up the near slope, and the hurdles put together at the very foot of the spectators.\\n\\nThe sheep had to be driven over the plank bridge, and the penning done beneath the very nose of the crowd. A stiff course, if ever there was one; and the time allowed, ten short minutes.\\n\\nThe spectators hustled and elbowed in their endeavors to obtain a good position. And well they might; for about to begin was the finest exhibition of sheep-handling any man there was ever to behold.\\n\\nThose two, who had won on many a hard-fought field, worked together as they had never worked before. Smooth and swift, like a yacht in Southampton Water; round the flag, through the gap, they brought their sheep. Down between the two flags--accomplishing right well that awkward turn; and back to the bridge.\\n\\nThere they stopped: the sheep would not face that narrow way. Once, twice, and again, they broke; and each time the gallant little Pip, his tongue out and tail quivering, brought them back to the bridge-head.\\n\\nAt length one faced it; then another, and--it was too late. Time was up. The judges signalled; and the Welshman called off his dog and withdrew.\\n\\nOut of sight of mortal eye, in a dip of the ground, Evan Jones sat down and took the small dark head between his knees--and you may be sure the dog's heart was heavy as the man's. \\\"We did our pest, Pip,\\\" he cried brokenly, \\\"but we're peat--the first time ever we've been!\\\"\\n\\nNo time to daily.\\n\\nJames Moore and Owd Bob were off on their last run.\\n\\nNo applause this time; not a voice was raised; anxious faces; twitching fingers; the whole crowd tense as a stretched wire. A false turn, a wilful sheep, a cantankerous judge, and the gray dog would, he beat. And not a man there but knew it.\\n\\nYet over the stream master and dog went about their business never so quiet, never so collected; for all the world as though they were rounding up a flock on the Muir Pike.\\n\\nThe old dog found his sheep in a twinkling and a wild, scared trio they proved. Rounding the first flag, one bright-eyed wether made a dash for the open. He was quick; but the gray dog was quicker: a splendid recover, and a sound like a sob from the watchers on the hill.\\n\\nDown the slope they came for the gap in the wall. A little below the opening, James Moore took his stand to stop and turn them; while a distance behind his sheep loitered Owd Bob, seeming to follow rather than drive, yet watchful of every movement and anticipating it. On he came, one eye on his master, the other on his sheep; never hurrying them, never flurrying them, yet bringing them rapidly along.\\n\\nNo word was spoken; barely a gesture made; yet they worked, master and dog, like one divided.\\n\\nThrough the gap, along the hill parallel to the spectators, playing into one another's hands like men at polo.\\n\\nA wide sweep for the turn at the flags, and the sheep wheeled as though at the word of command, dropped through them, and trayelled rapidly for the bridge.\\n\\n\\\"Steady!\\\" whispered the crowd.\\n\\n\\\"Steady, man!\\\" muttered Parson Leggy.\\n\\n\\\"Hold 'em, for God's sake!\\\" croaked Kirby huskily. \\\"D--n! I knew it! I saw it coming!\\\"\\n\\nThe pace down the hill had grown quicker--too quick. Close on the bridge the three sheep made an effort to break. A dash--and two were checked; but the third went away like the wind, and after him Owd Bob, a gray streak against the green.\\n\\nTammas was cursing silently; Kirby was. white to the lips; and in the stillness you could plainly hear the Dalesmen's sobbing breath, as it fluttered in their throats.\\n\\n\\\"Gallop! they say he's old and slow!\\\" muttered the Parson. \\\"Dash! Look at that!\\\" For the gray dog, racing like the Nor'eastcr over the sea, had already retrieved the fugitive.\\n\\nMan and dog were coaxing the three a step. at a time toward the bridge.\\n\\nOne ventured--the others followed.\\n\\nIn the middle the leader stopped and tried to turn--and time was flying, flying, and the penning alone must take minutes. Many a man's hand was at hig watch, but no one could take his eyes off the group below him to\\\\~ look.\\n\\n\\\"We're beat! I've won bet, Tammas! groaned Sam'l. (The two had a long-standing wager on the matter.) \\\"I allus knoo hoo 'twould be. I allus told yo' th' owd tyke\\n\\nThen breaking into a bellow, his honest face crimson with enthusiasm: \\\"Coom on, Master! Good for yo', Owd Un! Yon's the style!\\\"\\n\\nFor the gray dog had leapt on the back of the hindmost sheep; it had surged forward against the next, and they were over, and making up the slope amidst a thunder of applause.\\n\\nAt the pen it was a sight to see shepherd and dog working together. The Master, his face stern and a little whiter than its wont, casting forward with both hands, herding the sheep in; the gray dog, his eyes big and bright, dropping to hand; crawling and creeping, closer and closer.\\n\\n\\\"They're in!--Nay--Ay--dang me! Stop 'er! Good, Owd Un! Ah-h-h, they're in!\\\" And the last sheep reluctantly passed through\\n\\n\\\\--on the stroke of time.\\n\\nA roar went up from the crowd; Maggie's white face turned pink; and the Dalesmen mopped their wet brows. The mob surged forward, but the stewards held them back.\\n\\n\\\"Back, please! Don't encroach! M'Adam'3 to come!\\\"\\n\\nFrom the far bank the little man watched the scene. His coat and cap were off, and his hair gleamed white in the sun; his sleeves were rolled up; and his face was twitching but set as he stood--ready.\\n\\nThe hubbub over the stream at length subsided. One of the judges nodded to him.\\n\\n\\\"Noo, Wullie--noo or niver!--'Scots wha hae'! \\\"--and they were off.\\n\\n\\\"Back, gentlemen! back! He's off--he's coming! M'Adam's coming!\\\"\\n\\nThey might well shout and push; for the great dog was on to his sheep before they knew it; and they went away with a rush, with him right on their backs. Up the slope they swept and round the first flag, already galloping. Down the hill for the gap, and M'Adam was flying ahead to turn them. But they passed him like a hurricane, and Red Wull was in front with a rush and turned them alone.\\n\\n\\\"M'Adam wins! Five to four M'Adam! I lay agin Owd Bob!\\\" rang out a clear voice in the silence.\\n\\nThrough the gap they rattled, ears. back, feet twinkling like the wings of driven grouse.\\n\\n\\\"He's lost 'em! They'll break! They're away!\\\" was the cry.\\n\\nSam'l was half up the wheel of the Kenmuir wagon; every man was on his toes; ladies were standing in their carriages; even Jim Mason's face flushed with momentary excitement.\\n\\nThe sheep were tearing along the hillside, all together, like a white scud. After them,, galloping like a Waterloo winner, raced Red Wull. And last of all, leaping over the ground like a demoniac, making not for the two flags, but the plank-bridge, the white-haired figure of M'Adam.\\n\\n\\\"He's beat! The Killer's beat!\\\" roared a strident voice.\\n\\n\\\"M'Adam wins! Five to four M'Adam! I lay agin Owd Bob!\\\" rang out the clear reply.\\n\\nRed Wull was now racing parallel to the fugitives and above them. All four were travelling at a terrific rate; while the two flags were barely twenty yards in front, below the line of flight and almost parallel to it. To effect the turn a change of direction must be macic almost through a right angle,\\n\\n\\\"He's beat! he's beat! M'Adam's beat! Can't make it nohow!\\\" was the roar.\\n\\nFrom over the stream a yell-- \\\"Turn 'em, Wullie!\\\"\\n\\nAt the word the great dog swerved down on the flying three. They turned, still at the gallop, like a troop of cavalry, and dropped, clean and neat, between the flags; and down to the stream they rattled, passing M'Adam on the way as though he was standing.\\n\\n\\\"Weel done, Wullie!\\\" came the scream from the far bank; and from the crowd went up an involuntary burst of applause.\\n\\n\\\"Ma word!\\n\\n\\\"Did yo' see that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"By gob!\\\"\\n\\nIt was a turn, indeed, of which the smartest team in the galloping horse-gunners might well have been proud. A shade later, and they must have overshot the mark; a shade sooner, and a miss.\\n\\n\\\"He's not been two minutes so far. We're beaten--don't you think so, Uncle Leggy?\\\" asked Muriel Sylvester, looking up piteously into the parson's face.\\n\\n\\\"It's not what I think, my dear; it's what the judges think,\\\" the parson replied; and what he thought their verdict would be was plainly writ on his face for all to read.\",\"timestamp\":1641284064,\"title\":\" Scots wham Bruce has aften led-- Welcome to your gory bed Or to victorie!\"},\"digest\":\"fk-sDvjJxwl1l62Cl8_8SuFC5d4GhgszeNkt-whbWSg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x64C49f050417521e14CDAd1447c72F8234716Cd7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_dAKxSHEKj_F2MxiLs0Qopuhkh3Bsyp-aLhRbA17bd0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"PdrCfQzcombXf58Dn-vKI2g33B0Uwb7oALcu-rb_ryY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"6m0cEn70LRlDUC_FaPIiO4khDj5oommQN8j2vQxvWgj_mRZovOkxdguB4KPIg64O7lOGFq8Izx5FZsC8MUSFZg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x02bb0afae6eaa49941534c0a08bc6ff8185529e33e54f83c08dcf81d970acc3b4f12de4734d892d932f77209b0fbf61f295ef28a2748fd3d38595a46d94ea5a91c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_dAKxSHEKj_F2MxiLs0Qopuhkh3Bsyp-aLhRbA17bd0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"PdrCfQzcombXf58Dn-vKI2g33B0Uwb7oALcu-rb_ryY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"fk-sDvjJxwl1l62Cl8_8SuFC5d4GhgszeNkt-whbWSg\"}"
