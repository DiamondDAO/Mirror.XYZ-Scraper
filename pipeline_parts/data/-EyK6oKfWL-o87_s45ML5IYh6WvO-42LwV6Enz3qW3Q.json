Yet he is harmed that abides in self-deception and ignorance.”\\n\\n(Marcus Aurelius)[\\\\[1\\\\]](#_ftn1)\\n\\nThe love and pursuit of truth is the preserve of all sapient beings. Yet, much of modern philosophy has been characterised by a language game for players adept at complex sentences using little known (esoteric) words. At some point our traditional philosophy appears to have lost its historic purpose as the love of truth, because the main developments in our understanding of the universe and our place in it took place elsewhere in the ‘hard’ sciences.[\\\\[2\\\\]](#_ftn2)\\n\\nA gulf has also opened up between our capacity for deep and intuitive insight (synthesis of the hard or impossible-to-calculate relations between things — often the specialism of artists and prophets) and our need to calculate and define everything.[\\\\[3\\\\]](#_ftn3) We need a reformed philosophy,[\\\\[4\\\\]](#_ftn4) to coordinate insights from across our whole culture that are used to formulate empirically justifiable axioms (statements of truth). We must coordinate information dissemination and decision-making by consensus.[\\\\[5\\\\]](#_ftn5)\\n\\n![Peter Pink-Howitt, “Clip an Angel’s wings’”, algo-art, 2021 CE](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*-CkzC7nkn3aGlkDw2zc0vQ.jpeg)\\n\\n![(John Keats)\\\\[6\\\\]](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a0jXEqe0UzEuzeO9yNbq5.png?height=684&width=1132)\\n\\nTruth is not intended to be an unknowable concept, nor something entirely relative to an observer. The deepest truths should be both invariant (true everywhere) and immanent (capable of being experienced and arising from within).\\n\\nIn these circumstances, one asks whether ethical laws must be confined to:\\n\\n#### “neither wrong or right… only crimes punished by places and by times”\\n\\n(*W. H. Auden*)[\\\\[7\\\\]](#_ftn7)\\n\\n*Even if we cannot find a universal foundation for our ethics, can ethics not be more wisely structured for the common good?*\\n\\nModern philosophy has often failed to follow a verifiable approach that is required for useful and testable theories about the ‘truth’ in question — most particularly in the field of ethics. Modern ethics has been notable in its lack of evidence and objectivity. Instead, it is often built upon assertions of unalienable rights and self-evident truths. This is not a justifiable approach. Perhaps not everything in life can be objective, but the danger with assertions that are not properly founded in a wider framework is that those ‘beliefs’ can be used to justify acting unreasonably, unfairly and without compassion.\\n\\n![ Peter Pink-Howitt, “Shape without form”, algo-art, 2021 CE](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cf2sU55xJSVc1RWzOBp_e.jpeg?height=928&width=1664&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\\n\\n## \\n\\n#### “Shape without form, shade without colour, Paralysed force, gesture without motion”\\n\\n(*T.

These propositions then give rise to the laws that flow from them. The principles of application, based also on the background axioms, are intended to help guide the application of the laws.\\n\\nThe laws are intended to be objective in principle\\\\* \\\\*but necessarily of limited practical use unless operated within carefully structured information channels and distributed consensus mechanisms.\\n\\n#### “Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.”\\n\\n(*George Orwell*)[\\\\[11\\\\]](#_ftn11)\\n\\nIt is taken as a scientific requirement that axioms in any valid ethical framework must be:\\n\\n● capable of verification and falsification\\n\\n● presumed to be provisional\\n\\n● modular, that is, capable of being removed, substituted or added to\\n\\nAs each axiom may be proved incorrect, to that extent it should also be modified or deleted, and all corresponding necessary changes made to the remainder of the ethical framework. The empirical process should drive these changes and the ethical framework should be built so as to enable this without causing systemic failure of the framework. New axioms, laws and principles will be needed over time.\\n\\n#### “It may be that there is some … way of arriving at objectivity in ethics; if so, since it must involve appeal to the majority, it will take us from personal ethics into the sphere of politics, which is, in fact, very difficult to separate from ethics.”\\n\\n(*Bertrand Russell*)[\\\\[12\\\\]](#_ftn12)\\n\\nThe proposed ethical framework contains the idea of consensus mechanisms for all decision-making, including governance, constitutional reform, identification and quantification of life-forms and their qualities, ethical lawfulness and the utility, costs and risks of any actions. The use of a distributed consensus mechanism is intended to reduce error and the risk of self-centredness, and to ensure collective responsibility. We will also need to consider some cultural methods whereby we try to ensure participants are in a more meditative (potentially wise) and less self-centred state.\\n\\nUtility-optimal decisions include those that may negatively impact a person or group’s liberty to do as they wish, but that are self-evidently a better outcome for a greater number of equivalent affected life-forms and normally give rise to a higher aggregate payoff for all. However, the importance of freedom of action must limit the excesses of utilitarian imposition of control over a minority.\\n\\nA useful ethical framework must provide ways and means to analyse the better likely payoffs. This includes evaluating the worst harms when choosing from a range of options. It should review some previous decisions made in accordance with it — either because there is new material information or to provide some form of audit of changes in consensus.\\n\\nDetermining exactly how we get where we need to be is beyond the scope of any one person. It requires much more research, broader consensus mechanisms and iteration to scope and operate. The expected initial process for any ethical framework is that willing stakeholders work together to finalise the proposed axioms and consider and agree on the provisional necessary laws and principles flowing from those axioms. This would then go out to a wider community of stakeholders to achieve consensus or iteration.\\n\\nWe need a broad community containing different skill sets to get this Consensus Engine the ground, if it is to be useful and a public good.\\n\\n*Can we create an Eden on Earth?*\\n\\nNot based on fear of knowledge and wilful ignorance, nor to appease a projected and ultimately unknowable god (a concept too often misused to instil fear and lack of curiosity).\\n\\nIt must be based on the deeper (and truly holy[\\\\[13\\\\]](#_ftn13) concept) of any god as a human expression of an attempt at ‘universal perfection or good’.[\\\\[14\\\\]](#_ftn14) Alternatively, as the life ‘force’ to which all life-forms must eventually return.[\\\\[15\\\\]](#_ftn15) An Eden based on the knowledge all humans (religious or otherwise) have learned — with knowledge of our mistakes, of the capacity of life-forms to suffer and utilising all of our capabilities and potential wisdom.[\\\\[16\\\\]](#_ftn16)\\n\\n![Johann Wenzel Peter, “Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden”, c. 1800–1829 CE, Vatican Pinacoteca, Wikipedia, public domain.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YWOGLemja-Qfwgt05jGq6.jpeg?height=1113&width=1500&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\\n\\n![T.
