"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*Hello Mr. Unknown,*\\n\\n*I don’t know who you are, where you live, and why you help me, but if I don’t write you these few lines to thank you, I won’t be able to move on to the next stages of my life with my mind and heart in peace.*\\n\\n*My real name is Tofail, I was born in Bangladesh before coming to France in 2001 with my parents and my two sisters. I am only 23 years old today, but I have a tremendous amount of responsibility in my everyday life.*\\n\\n*Even though I work as an order picker and I do work to the left and right, I don’t earn enough to pay my rent and bank loan that I made when I was 21. To get out of it I needed miraculously a substantial amount of money to solve my problems, and I’m far too realistic to believe in miracles, so I gave up and along the way I lost people who were mental pillars to me, which plunges me into a deep depression.*\\n\\n*As a joke, I always tell my mother that my life is a comedic and dramatic film, and it’s confirmed even today because thanks to you and the purchase of “Mask Off” + “a Girl Named Candy”, I will finally be able to put my account in positive and offer Christmas gifts to my family. I was so ashamed to show them my empty hands this year and you saved me from this future nightmare that I should have overcome on December 24.*\\n\\n*To tell you my whole story, I would need a lot more line and time. But I’m not here for that, I’m here to thank you Mr. Unknown, you who without knowing me, without knowing where I live, who I am and what I think, you’ve helped me. Thanks to you, I could start a new chapter in my life and try to finally build a happy ending to all this.*\\n\\n*You’re the person who helped me the most, even though we don’t know each other. With your involvement, you are changing the lives of hundreds of people around the world.*\\n\\n*On behalf of everyone, I thank you in the hope that life will give back ten times what you do for all of us.* *A thousand thanks to you, do not change. You are the best*\\n\\n*Tofail aka Imperfect,*\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nI hope you realize you’re a good person. Thank you again and again, you save my life and you give me a new chance for 2022, it’s symbolic to me because I was really tricking and you are my miracle.\\n\\nThanks to you, this is the beginning of Imperfect and the end of my problems. Hopefully one day we’ll be able to follow your lead and do the same for others. ❤\",\"timestamp\":1639499852,\"title\":\"Thank you Mr. Unknown\"},\"digest\":\"ubi8wfFelytovbZ98ksv6sRDjBLUdaVwMG7wv7DsTnc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xe8A67eF6BF98a20764896D9Fbe04AdbE03463af6\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"f57Z5hw7XZvMiRwuOh0h-7JxUJ3uiCEqGvODO9xxyCU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"vw2UO8BNYuMYCQsrtwUAS_E4YSkWMyi2BHIdF9s5QtM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Ys-SpP3kzB64-ESryE4yrrnLh_ARqa1pX_eYST2_iGPNOX7PhcD9KuBbxziNDqe190ZnirXrb7z0Z_GMD47xcg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xcea49b41a1e19a956191c8eaad49def224f72cec1afb0f1555359a686bc432d9126150e0ea3e3fa5116a94eb455e7f1ffae5cb01efb873212ac3d5f50c6f2eb81b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"f57Z5hw7XZvMiRwuOh0h-7JxUJ3uiCEqGvODO9xxyCU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"vw2UO8BNYuMYCQsrtwUAS_E4YSkWMyi2BHIdF9s5QtM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"S3IQTGnktZhqs2V65-sxyRF3xewGlTAtJs_n3xHPh0U\"}"
