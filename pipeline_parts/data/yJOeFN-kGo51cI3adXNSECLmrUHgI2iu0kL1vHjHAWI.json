"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Part One Asia Ark 2\\none\\nYang Yuan clearly remembers the bright blue sky when he was a teenager, that kind of blue, refreshing. The masses of white clouds, like cotton at your fingertips, are like a warm and soft quilt when you sleep. When nothing happened, I looked up at the sky and watched the white clouds floating in the sky by the wind, dark blue with snow white, the colors matched beautifully. Yang Yuan thought, this is the beauty that people all over the world can appreciate. I miss it the most on weekends when I was young. When I was about to get up in the morning, if I heard the patter of rain outside, it was so relaxing that I couldn't help but sleep again.\\nBut these have all become the past.\\nThe sky no longer has that intoxicating blue, replaced by the sky with blue and purple in the black; the white cloud has never been seen again, the current cloud, only occasionally can see the fog-like dark cloud, a dignified and gloomy pair His face, as if staring at you, makes people feel hairy; there is no more pattering rain, only the occasional falling snow instead of raindrops in the past.\\nThe world today is completely different from 40 years ago, only gloomy and cold.\\ntwo\\nYang Yuan is a plumber with more than 30 years of experience. It is now in 2117. Due to the shortage of labor in the world, he is 62 years old and cannot retire. Today is the day when a project starts. Yang Yuan traveled far and wide and was assigned to the coast of the eastern Philippines.\\n\\\"Oh, a lot of people!\\\" Yang Yuan sighed, seeing the construction army entering the gate of the construction site one after another. Under the cold of minus 40 degrees, they unified the guidance of the holographic projection made by intelligent robots, and followed the construction team and construction. According to the job number classification, everyone came to several temporary meeting rooms.\\nYang Yuan entered the conference room, with heating, feeling much more comfortable. See the indoor air indicator on the wall showing: temperature 5℃, humidity 25%, oxygen content 20.7%. Following the instructions of the entire system of intelligent robots, everyone found a stool to sit down and waited for the 7 o'clock meeting.\\n\\\"Hi, hello!\\\" The worker next to him took the initiative to chat with Yang Yuan in English: \\\"I am from Japan, Harada Dozo, please take care of me!\\\"\\n\\\"Hello, I'm from China, Yang Yuan.\\\" Yang Yuan stretched out his hand, took off his heavy gloves, and shook hands with him.\\nThe worker in front also turned his head and said, \\\"Hello, I am from South Korea, Kim Jong-ho.\\\" He took the initiative to greet everyone.\\n\\\"Excuse me, are you also plumbers?\\\" Yang Yuan glanced at the people in front of him. They should be about the same age as him, so they started chatting.\\n\\\"Yes, everyone has suffered a lot of being arranged here, right?\\\" Harada said.\\n\\\"Yeah, who wants to walk outdoors in heavy clothes now? It's so cold outside, and our work is basically done indoors.\\\" Jin Jong-ho said: \\\"However, the state has arranged for us to come here, but it doesn’t cost much. For those with less energy, these points are paid by the state. I just saw so many people, this project should not be easy.\\\"\\n\\\"Yes, now the world’s per capita daily energy points are less than 1,000. When we arrive here by airplane, it is far above the average. The main indicator of energy points is the consumption of oxygen. After all, airplanes consume a lot of oxygen. It’s been 40 years since I took a plane this time.” Yang Yuan said.\\n\\\"This time it should be an emergency. Our company only notified me yesterday afternoon. We have more than 300 people on a plane, all of whom are veteran workers with decades of experience. They come from different companies and positions. I am a plumber, as well as an electrician, Workers such as machine repairers, numerical control, machine tools, etc. are all urgently sent.\\\" Harada said, \\\"However, the business of our shipyard has been worse than a year. Now, the sea around Japan has long been frozen. We have already transformed into submersible ships. The customers of the original old ships were all freight companies, and they all closed down. Because of the spooky weather, the sea was covered with ice, and the shipping market in the past was extinct.\\\"\\n\\\"I also come from a shipyard, and our company has the same problem. Our company used to have a big port. It was called busy more than 40 years ago. Now it is almost abandoned, leaving only two submersible boat docks. One use and one preparation. Compared with the original prosperity, it’s not worth mentioning.” Yang Yuan also sighed, “As the ice becomes thicker and thicker every year as the year gets colder. Our old-fashioned shipyard will either go bankrupt. Either change.\\\"\\nAt 7 o'clock, the meeting began, and the characters displayed on the holographic projection interrupted everyone's chat in twos and threes.\\n\\\"Everyone, I'm Matthew, the chief in charge of Asia Ark 2, from China.\\\" The person in the projection introduced himself, \\\"This project that everyone is participating in is the project of hope for mankind. We are going to be under the sea in the eastern Philippines, To create a submarine city, it is the Asian Ark 2 that you will participate in the construction.\\\"\\n\\nWhen Yang Yuan heard about this plan for the first time, his head was at a loss. He never thought that he would build a city on the bottom of the sea. He sometimes wonders: should humans develop underground to cope with the colder and colder weather that makes it impossible to go out, or emigrate to space or Mars.\\n\\\"There are four reasons for choosing the location of Ark Asia 2: First, why it is placed in the sea. Because the submarine building unit can effectively resist earthquakes, and it can be moved. Our submarine cities are all small buildings. Units are the mainstay. These buildings will automatically select the appropriate building model according to the seawater temperature, flow rate and other parameters to weaken the influence of seawater movement. When the water flow speed and direction of the seawater change, the building unit itself will change it accordingly. At the same time, these building units can move on the seabed and are controllable. If a large space is needed, small building units can be pieced together into a large space. After use, they can be decomposed and restored to their original state. The original location of each. As for why the small space is the main one, it is because the small space is easier to resist the water flow and the tsunami caused by the possible earthquake. The building units and the units are connected to each other, and the connection is made of earthquake-proof Flexible connection to offset the mutual influence of vibration between the units. The internal ground of the building units can be kept at a permanent level. People can pass between the building units and the units through underwater buses or public corridors. The whole city is mainly divided into three parts. The uppermost layer is the public building area, the middle layer is the residential area, and the lowermost layer is the traffic road area. The residential area is in the middle layer, which is relatively safe. The outside of the city is maintained with a protective net. The net's role is mainly to stabilize the water flow and prevent the seabed Animals invade, and also use the fluctuation of water to collect energy. The size of the mesh is adjustable. Our entire city can be moved, so that we can adjust the position later to cope with the changes in the ice layer.\\\"\\n\\\"Second, this is near the equator of the earth. Last summer there was a short thawing period of the sea. The four seasons in the future will become less and less obvious. There is only one season in a year, which is winter; there is only one day in a year. Night is left. Now the seas in the southern and northern hemispheres are full of ice all year round. The construction is difficult, costly, and the construction period is long. Moreover, the living environment on the ground in the future will definitely be worse than here. We must prepare before the thawing period Work, install the first batch of building units during the thawing period and send them to the sea. Once the freezing period is reached, our work will become very slow. This is why everyone is so anxious to come here. We need to The first batch of units will be launched this year. At present, each test unit has mature experience, and now it is necessary to start mass production and installation non-stop. We plan to complete the Asian Ark 2 submarine city within 10 years.\\\"\\n\\\"Third, according to calculations, the sun’s light will completely move to the magnetic poles on both sides in about 100 years, and only the position exactly facing the sun’s magnetic poles can receive its energy. That is to say, the sun’s energy only comes from the two magnetic poles. Radiation outwards, the middle part of the sun will become very dim at that time. Unfortunately for the earth, the light will become less and less. In these 100 years, the sun’s illuminance on the earth will become lower and lower, and the earth will become more and more dim. It’s getting colder, the ground will not be able to survive, and the sea will become thicker and thicker. It is close to the deepest Mariana Trench on earth, and there are also wide submarine plains and submarine basins. The submarine cities first choose plains with stable water currents and geological stability. Above, if the ice layer thickens in the future, the submarine city can gradually sink to the bottom of the sea. When the last resort, we can move into the trench. According to calculations, this trench is the last completely frozen area in the world. Relatively shallow sea areas, cities are built here. , It can fight for more survival time for human beings. You only need to take the elevator to reach the sea.\\\"\\n\\\"Fourth, in the absence of the sun, geothermal is our main source of energy. Geothermal is a low-cost, very safe and long-term energy source. The seabed here is rich in geothermal energy that can provide urban energy. We collect For geothermal energy, geothermal converters are installed on the seabed in exchange for electricity, while a small amount of energy generated by nuclear energy and water flow is also used to supply electricity to the city.\\\"\\n\\\"Our experimental building unit has passed various tests, and everyone operates in accordance with the drawings and requirements of the ministers. Once completed, the service life of Ark 2 can reach 200 years. After 200 years, it can be overhauled and continue to be used, and it will continue to develop towards the seabed. According to our calculations, within 1,000 years, this area can be used as a home. After 1,000 years, let our children and grandchildren use their own methods to solve the human crisis!\\\"\\n\\\"You are all experts in various engineering positions and have more than 20 years of practical operation experience. Our project cannot tolerate any carelessness. Once there is a problem with the quality of the construction on the seabed, it is very difficult to escape. Participate in Ark 2, this human The Hope Project is an honor for you all. Please, everyone!\\\"\\nMatthew finally finished speaking, leaving behind a bewildered crowd, who hadn't been relieved yet.\\nThe holographic projection went out, and a person walked on the stage: \\\"Everyone, I am the Minister of the Pipeline Department, my name is Goslov, I am from Russia, and I welcome everyone to the Asia Ark 2 Pipeline Department. The temporary workshops in various operating areas, The construction has come to an end. The main task of our pipeline department is to arrange the pipelines in the temporary workshop. The main pipelines include: water supply, drainage, heating, gas supply, power supply, solid waste and other pipeline systems. After this task is completed, Carry out the installation of pipelines in each building unit. After the installation of the internal pipelines and equipment of the building unit is completed, the individual building units are launched into the sea in batches, and then we carry out the pipeline docking between the units in the sea. Finally, we also need to carry out the lines of various urban general management The installation is completed until our Ark 2 submarine city. At the same time, in order to save time, we will first arrange a team to install the subsea geothermal converter first. The geothermal collection of the geothermal converter uses a kind of biological characteristics. The growing heat-resistant thermally conductive fiber will grow to the bottom of the sea like a tree root, and the growth period will take more than 5 years, so we need to plant these machines on the bottom of the sea like a tree. At present, we have already installed the test machine. It can be installed in batches, just follow the drawing and operation manual of the testing machine.\\\"\\n\\nGoslov then distributed the tasks and distributed the drawings and operating manuals. The manuals and drawings are actually a smart holographic projection device. Now the paper is very precious because it can only cultivate trees indoors. According to the minister's arrangement, Yang Yuan's first task was to install drainage pipes in the construction workshop. Now the temporary workshop has been formed and can be operated indoors, but without heating, it should be very cold. Yang Yuan was in a group with Harada Dosan and Kim Jong-ho. Yang Yuan was the team leader and Harada Dosan was the deputy team leader. They grouped a total of 20 people. The minister sent more than 30 teams to carry out pipeline installation tasks in the construction workshop. Yang Yuan and his team are responsible for the installation of drainage pipes in Zone E.\\nthree\\nThe construction site is mainly divided into living area, materials and equipment and processing area, construction area, each area has its own corresponding office. Temporary buildings for living areas, materials and equipment, and processing areas have taken shape, and indoor corridors and roads between each area are now being built. The temporary building workshop is built with a new type of heat-insulating lightweight board. This board has low density, high hardness, fatigue resistance, good plasticity, good fire resistance, and low thermal conductivity. It is an ideal temporary housing material. The construction area is by the sea, which was originally a natural deep-water port, and there are still two submersible boat docks that can be used today. The construction area is converted from this port. In the future, various building units will be installed here. After completion, they will be launched into the sea from here, and the units will be docked in the sea.\\nWe came to the E area, which was originally a port container storage site. The current drainage pipes are different from 40 years ago. The previous municipal drainage pipes were all buried underground, but for now, the depth is not enough and will freeze. It turns out that a city, if it is not big, only needs a sewage treatment plant. At present, sewage is treated by each area itself, and the equipment is regularly cleaned and treated, and the sewage pipe does not pass through the outdoors. As for domestic water, it depends on the sea, and desalination equipment can be used. For cities that do not rely on water, each area uses its own groundwater.\\nYang Yuan's current task is to first take the pipes and fittings from the material workshop, install them according to the drawings, and finally heat the pipes. After twelve days of installation, their group overcame the cold and completed the task. After acceptance by Minister Goslov and others, they ended the task of the temporary workshop. The Minister arranged for them to formally install the pipelines of the Asian Ark 2 building unit.\\nBuilding units are divided into two categories, one is the building unit of public buildings, the other is the residential building unit, and each is subdivided into several types of houses. Yang Yuan's task is to install pipes in the molded housing unit C-type shell.\\nToday is the first working day for Yang Yuan and the others to receive a new assignment. Now there is heating in the workshop and it is much more comfortable. When they came to the assembly area, a residential C unit appeared in front of them: it was divided into two layers: the inner and outer layers, the outer layer was an irregular curved body, the inner layer was a square living space, and the inner and outer layers were mainly made of glass. , Yang Yuan tapped lightly, but found that it was not glass. Looking at the outdoors from the inside, the inner and outer layers can be transparent and can also be used as display screens. The internal space is very compact, and the rooms are few and small. The inner wall of the building can be moved or folded, and can be put away when not needed, and can also be set to be transparent or used as a display screen. The bottom of the building unit can be filled with water, like a submarine, so that the building unit is suspended on the seabed. The indoor ground is controlled by sensors and artificial intelligence, and can be kept level. If it encounters the impact of water on the seabed, the shaking is only the outer layer of the building, and the indoors are still flat on the ground. People living inside will not feel any shaking. You can also set up different life scenes indoors, you can set up beaches, grasslands, woods... people can't feel that they are living on the bottom of the sea.\\nAccording to the drawings, in a building unit, the pipes include air supply, exhaust, heating, power supply, water supply, drainage and so on. In the future, on the seabed, the arrangement of units and units will be like 3*3*3 Rubik’s Cube. The building unit in the middle of the Rubik’s Cube is responsible for the water supply, power supply, network, gas supply, heating and sewage equipment of all units of this Rubik’s Cube. This building unit is called It is a public equipment room, responsible for the 26 households of this unit Rubik's Cube. The public equipment room is then connected to the regional general equipment room. The main energy source of the general equipment room is the geothermal converter.\\nYang Yuan and his team’s task of pipeline installation is somewhat challenging, that is, the shape of this unit is variable. Therefore, the pipeline needs to be installed flexibly at the deformed node to deal with the deformation of the pipeline. These processes were not common before. And the materials this time, they have never touched. Fortunately, they have been trained by the minister, and the drawings and operating instructions have been written in great detail. They successfully completed the installation of the pipes of the first building unit.\\nIn the summer of this place, the sea surface did not thaw. Fortunately, the thickness of the frozen layer is not too thick. They can knock open the ice surface and enter the sea into the building unit. In order to prevent the knocked ice surface from freezing quickly, they electrically heated the water surface in the work area. Today is the day when the first batch of building units assembled by them enter the sea. The crane lifts the building units and puts them into the water. After the bottom of each unit is filled with water, they sink into the water. After a unit cube is arranged neatly, they put on diving suits and launch into the water for the pipe docking between the units. After the pipe docking is completed, manually Intelligently controls the overall movement of the unit cube and dives to the designated sea area.\\nIn the following days, Yang Yuan and the others repeated the construction of the Ark 2 submarine city day after day. The overall project was carried out in an orderly manner.\\nFour\\nMinister Goslov announced today that the subsea geothermal converter has been partially installed and can be docked with the regional general equipment room. The docking process needs to be carried out in the deep sea, and Yang Yuan and his team will conduct a test docking. Yang Yuan and his colleagues usually install pipelines in shallow waters. Now, where they need to go, the diving suits cannot withstand the water pressure, so they need to use submersibles and induction manipulators to install them. Yang Yuan and the others, as representatives, carry out this experimental installation. If the test is successfully connected, they will be the chief editor of the operation manual for this process.\\nYang Yuan and his team carried out the division of labor. Yang Yuan and other three persons were responsible for the installation of the end points of the regional general equipment room, and another team of three persons were responsible for the installation of the end points of the geothermal converter, and four teams of three persons were responsible for the laying of pipelines and cables. The team rides on a submersible, the navigation is operated by artificial intelligence, and the pipeline installation is operated by an induction manipulator. Yang Yuan's first team also has Harada Dozo and Kim Jong-ho.\\n\\\"It's so dark here,\\\" Harada said.\\n\\\"This is where our children and grandchildren will live in the future.\\\" Yang Yuan said.\\n\\\"The building units here are not enough for so many people on the earth to live.\\\" Kim Jong-ho looked a little worried, \\\"If you can't live here, what will you do in the future?\\\"\\nYang Yuan understands his feelings, this is also their common worry. Although humans strictly control births, there are too many humans on the planet. The habitable population of the 29 submarine cities currently under construction in the world is obviously not enough for the huge number of humans. With the world’s meager manpower and material resources, even if we continue to build new submarine cities within 100 years, it will still be a drop in the bucket, even if the birth rate is very low.\\n\\\"First do your job well!\\\" Harada Dozo reminded.\\nThey followed the ice anchor all the way down to the target sea area. The function of the ice anchor is to fix the submarine city through the ice on the sea surface and prevent it from drifting with the current. In the submersible, through the long-distance observation of the infrared imaging system, they saw rows of building units with holographic imaging in front of them. When they approached, the building units appeared in rows and rows under the searchlight, without seeing the end at a glance, it was very spectacular, and the sight in front of them was breathtaking.\\nFrom the geothermal converter to the regional general equipment room, the connecting pipeline is very long. The pipeline is a stretchable flexible pipeline, and the power supply cable is also a special stretchable cable. Finding a way on the sea bottom depends on coordinates and infrared imaging systems. The surrounding area is dark, with undercurrents surging from time to time, and the submersible shaking, making people frightened.\\nAfter several drills and 7 hours of work, Yang Yuan and the others completed the connection of a geothermal converter and the power pipes and heating pipes of a regional general equipment room. After debugging, after powering on a Rubik’s Cube, a perfect Rubik’s Cube was illuminated. Up.\\nBack on the ground, in accordance with Minister Goslov's request, they completed the compilation of the operation manual for the public equipment room and geothermal converter of the Rubik's Cube unit.\\nAccording to Matthew's vision, the Ark 2 submarine city will be completed in 10 years. Now the time is approaching and the project is nearing completion. Now more than 40 elevators from the submarine to the ground are being installed. At the age when he was supposed to retire, Yang Yuan was still working on this human hope project, for the last hope of mankind.\",\"timestamp\":1640748725,\"title\":\" Galaxy Park 1\"},\"digest\":\"x691VRLZBaczoujXfuXw4akTgztgOjw1NlwDxNaBFIA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xF55c02b021f91752521C0cB74303565f25BAcCb1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZAnf4t4qSk8JacLpn4HmVp08sG5PoHJCEy_g_tLQ_eU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kKxqfLNZchE-KYsFjjrwVBdjeyl6-A9qRoAJS95Mpjk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"7-rRRwMoND0DMzabfU80vOqIISwQPuRpLXjeROZWY7tFWE9mTjjWLX5M2n7zcVAxQKaP2H3paeRHUmwe1XAcmQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xfbae68e691bb1e97dbd4c9a264af2354a663e3588f409dd8b950a2aa67c6f3f31a676747a012127011249ca9a08ee8f487c51cd07d8207ed7f07995b6cdfa8341b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZAnf4t4qSk8JacLpn4HmVp08sG5PoHJCEy_g_tLQ_eU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kKxqfLNZchE-KYsFjjrwVBdjeyl6-A9qRoAJS95Mpjk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"x691VRLZBaczoujXfuXw4akTgztgOjw1NlwDxNaBFIA\"}"
