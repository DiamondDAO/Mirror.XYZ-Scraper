"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"A joint venture (JV) is an agreement that mutually benefits two or more businesses with complementary resources or overlapping customer avatars.\\n\\nComplementary resources can be products, services, assets, software, customer lists, social followings, and equipment.\\n\\nOverlapping customer avatars means that all parties target or cater to a similar customer base.\\n\\nFor example, let’s say that your avatar is mountain bikers, and you own a few brick-and-mortar bike shops.\\n\\nYou could ask a helmet company to pitch your bikes to their email list (email drop) in exchange for a cut of any sales that they bring in.\\n\\nYou could do the same with any other biking equipment.\\n\\nAnd then pitch them in an email drop to your list as well.\\n\\nNow, why is this strategy so powerful? Both sides are taking something that they already have and sharing it for a win-win.\\n\\nJV’s are also perfect with companies that only contact their customers once!\\n\\nExamples of this are service companies for uncommon services like plumbers and electricians.\\n\\nOr companies that only sell a single, one-time use product.\\n\\n## **The Caveat**\\n\\nIf JV’s are so great, why aren’t there more of them?\\n\\nIt comes down mostly to common entrepreneurial psychological fallacies or lack of skills like:\\n\\n* Poor communication\\n* Low self-trust\\n* The ability to trust a direct competitor\\n* Being the big-cheese and wanting to do everything alone\\n* Overcomplicating the legal side\\n\\n“Do long term business with long term people” – Naval Ravikant.\\n\\nThis simple rule will quickly deal with any road bumps that come up in a JV.\\n\\nJV’s let both sides grow their business for basically zero out of pocket.\\n\\nThey are thus allowing you to get more creative with how you solve business problems.\\n\\nWhile the thought is fresh in your mind, map possible JV opportunities that your business could take!\\n\\nRecommended posts:\\n\\n**[How To Start A Joint Venture Negotiation](https://www.zenketing.com/how-to-start-a-joint-venture-negotiation/)**\\n\\n**[How To Get To No Faster In Negotiations](https://www.zenketing.com/how-to-get-to-no-faster-in-negotiations/)**\\n\\nJoin the ASE fleet of business owners today!\\n\\n**[Get Your Complimentary Instant Growth Package Here](https://acquirescaleandexit.ck.page/7d0175d3ef)**\",\"timestamp\":1640574372,\"title\":\"What Is A Joint Venture and Why Are They So Powerful? - Acquire Scale And Exit\"},\"digest\":\"UKRtTCjPzwk0vutW03EQNgt3Uw1jZkGW4rDx9leN10k\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x387c8c9903Fe9C1fe5EFE7Cc8caB14a7e6f6Da3e\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NzV1WpJMUE9d5erjYgfliQnNhKbDAZaHdGtVtj7ub0k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KtDxKJ2ourzD-tX31_zUWSGruWMYNLlzy1oAmHXThu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"RixT0AsXOZN5aS_HyeFTZhC4gu6cC6f9FfThIJbdW4pZ3aBQvXC2ekkG_9qdVRUF8k8wdbb10eqOhCvbGVJsdQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xab9c83d4638a461200100a80c5ce61b1735ce6b3c8248736a44f43e735b4348e79c509b9d9ff7c8f35be300038243c988acefc417c460d3b6b6ac5fba1edb0871b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NzV1WpJMUE9d5erjYgfliQnNhKbDAZaHdGtVtj7ub0k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KtDxKJ2ourzD-tX31_zUWSGruWMYNLlzy1oAmHXThu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"UKRtTCjPzwk0vutW03EQNgt3Uw1jZkGW4rDx9leN10k\"}"
