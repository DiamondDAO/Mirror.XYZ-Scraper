"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## TLDR:\\n\\nWe are *bringing more people to crypto* through NFTs.\\nOur first project is an *airdrop of the Christmas Socks NFT* for you to gift your friends.\\n\\n## What are Christmas Socks and what‚Äôs the goal?\\n\\nFirst of all, let‚Äôs get something out of the way, this is the stupidest name possible for a DAO.\\n\\nIt‚Äôs OK.\\n\\nWe believe that, if the goal is big enough, people are willing to ignore and even embrace a shitty name.\\n\\nOur goal sure is:\\n\\n### To increase the adoption of crypto through the use of NFTs.\\n\\nThis is already happening.\\n\\nNFTs created an influx of people to the crypto community that we wouldn‚Äôt have seen otherwise.\\n\\nAs [@3LAU](https://twitter.com/3LAU/) said:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/3LAU/status/1446188656234926097?s=20](https://twitter.com/3LAU/status/1446188656234926097?s=20)\\n\\nWe feel there‚Äôs a lot more to be done.\\n\\nFor now, the main idea is to get people who are already into NFTs to gift NFTs during the Christmas season to people who have not yet entered the rabbit hole.\\n\\n![Be like Alice.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DImj-WlBXOgQzDrH3TrjH.gif?height=191&width=300)\\n\\n### Ownership is a magical thing.\\n\\nThis puts it so well:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1434554799450640405?s=20](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1434554799450640405?s=20)\\n\\nAnd when I heard this (üëá) on a Twitter Space, I knew there was something to this idea.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/NFTsAnonymous/status/1447307344359174153](https://twitter.com/NFTsAnonymous/status/1447307344359174153)\\n\\n## Why do we need an initiative like this?\\n\\n[@Jishai](https://twitter.com/Jishai) recently tweeted:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/Jishai/status/1436331943323488261?s=20](https://twitter.com/Jishai/status/1436331943323488261?s=20)\\n\\nI couldn‚Äôt agree more. We are so early. There‚Äôs so much to do.\\n\\n## How?\\n\\nThe first thing to remember is that this is an experiment. As with all experiments, the plan will change and adapt.\\n\\nThe initial idea is to airdrop 1 mil free Christmas Socks pairs to people who are already familiar with the space and have them gift one of them to a friend or family member for Christmas.\\n\\nThis isn‚Äôt settled in stone. It‚Äôs up to us, as a community, to figure out how to best accomplish our goal.\\n\\nMaybe we pivot to Christmas Sweaters.\\n\\nMaybe we decide to do 1M Christmas Socks.\\n\\nMaybe we come up with a staking mechanism.\\n\\nMaybe all of those.\\n\\nOne challenge that is unanimously accepted in the crypto community is that there‚Äôs still a high barrier to entry because of the cumbersome UX. But Crypto Santa listened to us and spoke to Coinbase.\\nThey just announced:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1448049855541100545?s=20](https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1448049855541100545?s=20)\\n\\n> Join their waiting list [here]()\\n\\nI bet that a lot of those challenges will be solved by players like Coinbase or pure effort from those who already deal with crypto and are willing to onboard their friends. Once again, I‚Äôm sure someone out there has better ideas.\\n\\n‚ÄúSounds all good and fluffy but what are the steps for this?‚Äù\\n\\n## The current plan üó∫\\n\\nThis is a rough visual sketch of how I‚Äôm thinking about it\\n\\n![https://whimsical.com/christmas-socks-ftw-5gPanDosULJEWZnYVMdrdj](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/v5H35LB1F6GE3TcGp54uv.png?height=2776&width=4226)\\n\\n## A Call to Arms ‚öîÔ∏è\\n\\nI started my NFT journey recently (thanks to [@tomosman](https://twitter.com/tomosman) for the Bad Bunnies tip that finally got me to enter the space) and I feel in love with the space and the possibilities.\\n\\nBut‚Ä¶\\n\\nAll these possibilities will only be realized when enough critical mass have joined the space.\\n\\nAs [@punk6529](https://twitter.com/punk6529) so well puts it:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1433025168021106697?s=20](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1433025168021106697?s=20)\\n\\nThis is where we get in. Let‚Äôs join forces to figure out how to onboard 100 million. Heck, let‚Äôs make it 10 times that. **1 billion**. Now, that‚Äôs a big number.\\n\\nIf this is to succeed, it will never be through a one-man army.\\n\\nIt needs a crowd but, mostly, it needs a community.\\nA community of people who believe.\\n\\nI‚Äôm looking for people who can and want to help. As a moderator, as a developer, as a designer, as a social media manager, as someone who told their friends about the project. As someone who can contribute in any imaginable way. \\n\\nSometimes a simple suggestion can have a huge impact on a project.\\n\\n## LFG\\n\\nNow is the time.\\n\\nLet‚Äôs make this Christmas the one when NFTs exploded in growth and impact.\\nYou can be part of it.\\n\\n[Join our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2tjKdTu4) now and be part of the revolution.\\n\\n## What does success look like?\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wPiMyMApOrfmn4eNlp4HS.png?height=720&width=1280&size=large)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1634222919,\"title\":\"Christmas Socks WTF\"},\"digest\":\"uu2iwRmZ802iLuq62AknNOmsqMgK3GC3yxN4XOv0QZw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7de48a55C6A2515C93c48F5e3C0BDF29802cFEED\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1d1s_Ib_RA1HNOpb237ORWI_XJPGu74qM08W2FcfzDs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3QTRy6lLJQRHOgvzK6eP3l9Xp9Ss7Q8AOPznb2s9XPk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"uT4iIoXtzP7Dea1PNa9DOFhL7l9ls0hLpJqsZeGWH8VNm_qqRHuHV6u72iLAcXTKqqJarpM6lzaM4shBF_pGag\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x6cf21f1aa925a1b7b1b5834afd70f8cdb4ec156d713a732115a31b08a163b2993ec453d60ddc64d5ca605b85b98aec8e5ccdbec9849f5bebad3e2f229eff24421c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1d1s_Ib_RA1HNOpb237ORWI_XJPGu74qM08W2FcfzDs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3QTRy6lLJQRHOgvzK6eP3l9Xp9Ss7Q8AOPznb2s9XPk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"SxMe85Lf-BBt3SCoiM2MoQMMwIaCK5W4Tb7p9DUl33s\"}"
