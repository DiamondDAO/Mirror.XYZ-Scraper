"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I do not see any illumination in those remarks, Mary. I understand from Marjory's manner that she is bent upon marrying Rufus Coleman. She said you knew of it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Why, of course I knew. It was as plain---\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Plain !\\\" scoffed the professor. \\\" Plain !\\\"\\n\\nWhy, of course,\\\" she cried. \\\"I knew it all along.\\\"\\n\\nThere was nothing in her tone which proved that she admired the event itself. She was evidently carried away by the triumph of her penetration. \\\" I knew it all along,\\\" she added, nodding.\\n\\nThe professor looked at her affectionately. \\\"You knew it all along, then, Mary? Why didn't you tell me, dear ? \\\"\\n\\n\\\" Because you ought to have known it,\\\" she answered blatantly.\\n\\nThe professor was glaring. Finally he spoke in tones of grim reproach. \\\"Mary, whenever you happen to know anything, dear, it seems only a matter of partial recompense that you should tell me.\\\"\\n\\nThe wife had been taught in a terrible school that she should never invent any inexpensive retorts concerning bookworms and so she yawed at once. \\\"Really, Harris. Really, I didn't suppose the affair was serious. You could have knocked me down with a feather. Of course he has been here very often, but then Marjory gets a great deal of attention. A great deal of attention.\\\" The professor had been thinking. \\\" Rather than let my girl marry that scalawag, I'll take you and her to Greece this winter with the class. Separation. It is a sure cure that has the sanction of antiquity.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Mrs. Wainwright, \\\"you know best, Harris. You know best.\\\" It was a common remark with her, and it probably meant either approbation or disapprobation if it did not mean simple discretion.\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\nTHERE had been a babe with no arms born in one of the western counties of Massachusetts. In place of upper limbs the child had growing from its chest a pair of fin-like hands, mere bits of skin-covered bone. Furthermore, it had only one eye. This phenomenon lived four days, but the news of the birth had travelled up this country road and through that village until it reached the ears of the editor of the Michaelstown Tribune. He was also a correspondent of the New York Eclipse. On the third day he appeared at the home of the parents accompanied by a photographer. While the latter arranged his, instrument, the correspondent talked to the father and mother, two coweyed and yellow-faced people who seemed to suffer a primitive fright of the strangers. Afterwards as the correspondent and the photographer were climbing into their buggy, the mother crept furtively down to the gate and asked, in a foreigner's dialect, if they would send her a copy of the photograph. The correspondent carelessly indulgent, promised it. As the buggy swung away, the father came from behind an apple tree, and the two semi-humans watched it with its burden of glorious strangers until it rumbled across the bridge and disappeared. The correspondent was elate; he told the photographer that the Eclipse would probably pay fifty dollars for the article and the photograph.\\n\\nThe office of the New York Eclipse was at the top of the immense building on Broadway. It was a sheer mountain to the heights of  which the interminable thunder of the streets arose faintly. The Hudson was a broad path of silver in the distance. Its edge was  marked by the tracery of sailing ships' rigging and by the huge  and many-coloured stacks of ocean liners. At the foot of the  cliff lay City Hall Park. It seemed no larger than a quilt. The grey walks patterned the snow-covering into triangles and ovals  and upon them many tiny people scurried here and there, without sound, like a fish at the bottom of a pool. It was only the  vehicles that sent high, unmistakable, the deep bass of their  movement. And yet after listening one seemed to hear a singular murmurous note, a pulsation, as if the crowd made noise by its  mere living, a mellow hum of the eternal strife. Then suddenly out of the deeps might ring a human voice, a newsboy shout perhaps, the cry of a  faraway jackal at night.\\n\\nFrom the level of the ordinary roofs, combined in many plateaus, dotted with short iron chimneys from which curled wisps of steam, arose other mountains like the Eclipse Building. They were great peaks,  ornate, glittering with  paint or polish. Northward they subsided to sun-crowned ranges.\\n\\nFrom some of the windows of the Eclipse office dropped the walls of a terrible chasm in the darkness of which could be seen vague struggling figures. Looking down into this appalling crevice one discovered only the tops of hats and knees which in spasmodic jerks seemed to touch the rims of the hats. The scene represented some weird fight or dance or carouse. It was not an exhibition of men hurrying along a narrow street.\\n\\nIt was good to turn one's eyes from that place to the vista of the city's splendid reaches, with spire and spar shining in the clear atmosphere and the marvel of the Jersey shore, pearl- misted or brilliant with detail. From this height the sweep of a snow-storm was defined and majestic. Even a slight summer shower, with swords of lurid yellow sunlight piercing its edges as if warriors were contesting every foot of its advance, was from the Eclipse office something so inspiring that the chance pilgrim felt a sense of exultation as if from this peak he was surveying the worldwide war of the elements and life. The staff of the Eclipse usually worked  without coats and amid the smoke from pipes.\\n\\nTo one of the editorial chambers came a photograph and an article from Michaelstown, Massachusetts. A boy placed the packet and many others upon the desk of a young man who  was standing before a window and thoughtfully drumming upon the pane. He turned at the thudding of the packets upon his desk. \\\" Blast you,\\\" he remarked amiably. \\\" Oh, I guess it won't hurt you to work,\\\" answered the boy, grinning with a comrade's Insolence. Baker, an assistant editor for the Sunday paper, took scat at his desk and began the task of examining the packets. His face could not display any particular interest because he had been at the same work for nearly a fortnight.\\n\\nThe first long envelope he opened was from a woman. There was a neat little manuscript accompanied by a letter which explained that the writer was a widow who was trying to make her living by her pen and who, further, hoped that the generosity of the editor of the Eclipse would lead him to give her article the opportunity which she was sure it deserved. She hoped that the editor would pay her as well as possible for it, as she needed the money greatly. She added that her brother was a reporter on the Little Rock Sentinel and he had declared that her literary style was excellent. Baker really did not read this note. His vast experience of a fortnight had enabled him to detect its kind in two glances. He unfolded the manuscript, looked at it woodenly and then tossed it with the letter to the top of his desk, where it lay with the other corpses. None could think of widows in Arkansas, ambitious from the praise of the reporter on the Little Rock Sentinel, waiting for a crown of literary glory and money. In the next envelope a man using the note-paper of a Boston journal begged to know if the accompanying article would be acceptable; if not it was to be kindly returned in the enclosed stamped envelope. It was a humourous essay on trolley cars. Adventuring through the odd scraps that were come to the great mill, Baker paused occasionally to relight his pipe.\\n\\nAs he went through envelope after envelope, the desks about him gradually were occupied by young men who entered from the hall with their faces still red from the cold of the streets. For the most part they bore the unmistakable stamp of the American college. They had that confident poise which is easily brought from the athletic field. Moreover, their clothes were quite in the way of being of the newest fashion. There was an air of precision about their cravats and linen. But on the other hand there might be with them some indifferent westerner who was obliged to resort to irregular means and harangue startled shop-keepers in order to provide himself with collars of a strange kind. He was usually very quick and brave of eye and noted for his inability to perceive a distinction between his own habit and the habit of others, his western character preserving itself inviolate amid a confusion of manners.\\n\\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/211](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/211)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638785771,\"title\":\"The professor straightened in his chair\"},\"digest\":\"seAZup4YcjyKgkucDG8PHiN_tewf8QqnBrjNJ7uaVok\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xBD285526750c6d1e9c301005d31Fcad2bE9E9AA0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Ng3az_9udQKRITwiHWxr3bXSie17WBKc44ypunQamWI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"CDKUA2omi0j9FkfynidYQksRwTAZ-lzgWR2_fYSJrAM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"xH4HDWa7XFba7h1NeN_noLgApzURfj_YhV-B8msjXewCWGPQO041cDkwAdWw3samfnVBFj4l_8XxZ4Y3WSWjjg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa1d4d8bb07890c1ed264c2bbf525b9708ebfe1d8d4dd749016317b33b5390a3c5bb2396b5c13b4da324abe3d72d46cf883d7843d8fc28fc7ae98cc5392c736a41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Ng3az_9udQKRITwiHWxr3bXSie17WBKc44ypunQamWI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"CDKUA2omi0j9FkfynidYQksRwTAZ-lzgWR2_fYSJrAM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"seAZup4YcjyKgkucDG8PHiN_tewf8QqnBrjNJ7uaVok\"}"
