"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Going to high school is my first time to leave home. I have to live in school from Monday to Friday. I like to stay away from my parents for some time, because I can make my own choice and be free to go anywhere. My friends and I like to spend the weekend in the countryside that near the city we live. It is the short travel that I can not only appreciate the beautiful scenery, but also learn to be independent. The things that nature teaches me are a lot. I can see from the color of the cloud to predict the weather and the sound of of animals have different meanings. All of these are hard to know from the books. I have my own thinking from these trips, and the way to take care of myself helps me to grow up.\",\"timestamp\":1639129188,\"title\":\"Traveling makes me grow up\"},\"digest\":\"kiscCJpxjsc87MehBnRxv06MXDLx7iE2P2sod3FTmJc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xBF70b4C0250DEbF3C3Ee1cAb3FAAa2dd011b0bAd\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0PtAu43UzZwYIT7DWOpncKxC3yettnmRZAr1KZ4HTSc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eGrfBaUGp537eTfIN-DwZwjH6OfHITavlgwIjZyxElU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"4HluB8n-4ak1MP7r450P84gN-BY6NcbKAMId96v8vhINK7SpulJEJezPiE0TKkpIZhr4ckKIfXo6X-zgwOFukw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x42d5af95f8a38448604d3e7505a5f35862eb5f9c57224c52ed7b4c753f61a1c81004ab8bb69999f4e89556b75a2505b58a611262d42ea8a3761ad9a7238d4ae91c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0PtAu43UzZwYIT7DWOpncKxC3yettnmRZAr1KZ4HTSc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eGrfBaUGp537eTfIN-DwZwjH6OfHITavlgwIjZyxElU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"kiscCJpxjsc87MehBnRxv06MXDLx7iE2P2sod3FTmJc\"}"
