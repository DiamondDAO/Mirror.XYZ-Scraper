"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"For a long time, I had revered companies like Google. They hired the smartest people and paid them handsomely, all while promising work with purpose, work on the cutting edge of technology and social innovation.\\n\\nA few years down the line and a couple of marketing jobs later, the sentiment turned on its head. Plunged into the attention economy and surveillance capitalism literature, I grew increasingly anxious about how companies like Google and Facebook impact our lives. I became worried about being an enabler of predatory, extractivist marketing practices. In the end, could no longer bear working a job that essentially paid for Google exec salaries, or even existing on social media.\\n\\n### The Early Years: Living in the Dark\\n\\nAs a wide-eyed, dopamine-chasing internet addict in my early 20s, I had this vivid impression that the internet was this immense and benevolent artificial intelligence organism, which was fed by its users. The mechanics were simple: what you give is what you get. The more purposeful information we added, the more we’d enrich our networks and make the world a better place. The more junk we fed it, the worse its inclinations to expose us to distractions, hate comments, and misinformation. But in the end, it was all for the common good, and if most users had good intentions, we’d succeed in building a useful digital record of our physical world and lived experiences. I thought that content was mine to use and rooted in collective co-ownership.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I was a few miles off. What I really should have asked myself was, how much influence do these services and recommendation engines have on our lives? Why are they so good at making me procrastinate for hours on end, while giving me the palpable feeling that I was achieving something by “staying in the loop”?\\n\\nIn the end, the daily fog of mindless link-hopping, binge reading, and bookmark hoarding remained unquestioned for a lot longer than I could have anticipated. Under the influence of intermittent dopamine rewards and unaware of the proverbial tracking chip in my leg, I was trailing free and providing these companies with exclusive access to my preferences, my questions, fears, and desires, as well as a detailed map of my digital (and [physical](https://www.wired.com/story/track-location-with-mobile-ads-1000-dollars-study/)) whereabouts.\\n\\nThe trouble was, I didn’t think there was anything wrong with it. At least, not until research linking social media use with anxiety, as well as Facebook’s [unethical emotions experiment](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/30/facebook-emotion-study-breached-ethical-guidelines-researchers-say) started to raise some red flags. Later on, the great Cambridge Analytica scandal would only confirm my doubts. But at this point in time, I was only beginning to fathom the feedback loop that regulated my digital life: the loop that enables algorithms to bring up relevant or “personalised” information on Google, Facebook, and co.\\n\\n### Surprise! You are the Product\\n\\nI only became fully aware of the size of the tracking and data extraction operation once I became an advertiser and was able to use some of the real products of Google and Facebook: the targeted advertising products. By the time I came across the work of scholars such as Shoshanna Zuboff, who exposed the entire paradigm of [surveillance capitalism](https://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/age-surveillance-capitalism-fight/), I was already uneasy about my day job.\\n\\nAs it turned out, the net was not governed by a friendly AI force as I had envisioned, but by the reinforcing logic which creates echo chambers and social media addicts. “What you give is what you get” was true, but none of it was working to my advantage. Case in point, the Facebook news feed algorithm is not just a chronological listing of the top updates in your network. It is designed [to keep you on the platform](https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/06/ultimate-guide-to-the-news-feed/?guccounter=1) for as long as possible and it learns to do this by making predictions based on your activity history.\\n\\nThe *Page Rank* search engine algorithm and the Facebook feed algorithm, unlike the web they live on, are not “free and open source”, but highly guarded business secrets, which could only ever be developed by extracting and processing user data. The AIs behind search engines and prediction algorithms essentially dictate where you may or may not go on the internet. They are your compass to the internet, helping you move in your chosen direction. But they are extremely problematic, since they reveal and conceal based on an internal logic that we influence without understanding.\\n\\n### What Next?\\n\\nThe truth is, I was missing the vocabulary and necessary concepts to grasp what was going on behind closed doors - and that was through no fault of my own. For many years, companies like Facebook and Google have gone to great lengths to deflect attention from their data collection practices. They have invested [tens of millions of dollars](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-are-tech-giants-lobbying-trump-era/) in lobbying, to conceal [data collection abuse](https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/study-calls-out-dark-patterns-in-facebook-and-google-that-push-users-towards-less-privacy/) under the guise of optimisation. In fact, behavioural data about users’ online activities was being mined for profit, without the apparent knowledge of users. All the while Google was even getting [support from government authorities.](https://pando.com/2014/04/23/the-revolving-door-between-google-and-the-department-of-defense/)\\n\\nWhen I finally realised how much data I was signing off for these companies, in order for them to extract additional value out of me, I felt both betrayed and complicit. While I was grateful for the newly gained awareness, some of my initial revelations were triggered by the use of targeted advertising tools in my day job. Yes, the same tools that were used to exploit citizens’ data to [influence elections around the globe](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-43476762).\\n\\nMy first course of action was to shut down my social accounts and uninstall all apps that might be tracking me. I then switched to alternative providers for my browser, search engine, email, file storage, and maps services (as it turns out, it is, in fact, possible to live without Google).\\n\\nData collection and our use of free online services are issues that don’t only impact our digital social selves - they influence our real lives and our democratic rights. Media literacy is a key skill for the digital age and learning about the ever-evolving, disruptive practices of digital capitalism is a lifelong process.\",\"timestamp\":1637316933,\"title\":\"Buttons, Boundaries and B-rolls: Waking up Inside the Media Machine \"},\"digest\":\"fT_2Cm_uHg_T6uSteZWVcMpgY0FgyA8BJObbpD7wY6o\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x79c91004293d466f8F7aA260e6Bd69D5Bb275040\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Dst02uusV2CuykfO0VogZkBJ_uviOWayoctH9AaEm-s\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"cD3GjEjYLPVnhqp0cOztZs6ocM8j9PLLoXozJ5t2YQU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"UJ2HzxI6vFchSRaaazcJbY0VbXSwiPyfk3UsMl9CgZmTIlyq-d6imE_R5MHyQSqxxbdjXXGOZGNd_9uV0SBSig\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0cb5100078ffeb186810638d460580aafbca1e687ad2b5f75e0a559ad638ea9508dc39d51293c044c29a11df7a0a426b3c9bcfa0b6ca7438d1d04abae12fd5bf1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Dst02uusV2CuykfO0VogZkBJ_uviOWayoctH9AaEm-s\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"cD3GjEjYLPVnhqp0cOztZs6ocM8j9PLLoXozJ5t2YQU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"7aK4git1-4YxSuXVMI8Kf54XMtGVusa7hM3tQj1ZRXM\"}"
