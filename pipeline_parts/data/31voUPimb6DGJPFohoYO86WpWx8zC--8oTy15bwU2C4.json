"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"According to the law of 28, 80% of the profits of a company are created by 20% of the elite. Therefore, if the company refuses to eat a big pot of rice, 80% of the profits should be shared by 20% of the people.\\n\\nThe other 20% of the profits will be distributed to 80% of the people. Those who cannot create profits will leave if they are willing to leave. It does not matter.\\n\\nSome bosses are very funny. They came to me and asked me why it was so easy to have a good person who left after not being able to do it for a long time. I answered him, because you earn 30,000 but give 5,000 to others. You like straw bales, and you use elite money to subsidize straw bales. Since you like straw bales, of course, you are surrounded by straw bales.\\n\\nEntrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs 159\\n\\nSome bosses are even more exaggerated. I have met a boss. Since his niece is an accounting student, he got his niece to get a company. The salary for his niece is much higher than the other two old accountants, which is about 4,000 yuan higher. , This is terrible. The two old accountants were so upset every day, putting on little shoes for the little girl, and finally they even left.\\n\\nExcellent people will definitely leave such a boss, because this boss likes sloppy stuff. Although the company is yours, don't think that you can spend the money any way you want. Smart entrepreneurs have long understood that if the money is too much, it is actually everyone's. You have to distribute it according to work, otherwise no one will play with you.\\n\\nAnother key point for the prosperity of talents is to create a gap between the rich and the poor. If there is no gap between the rich and the poor, especially the Chinese, he has no motivation. With the gap between the rich and the poor, the poor can work hard, and the boss can get profits. If they can’t stand it, they will quit their jobs automatically. Moreover, as everyone sees that some people do make a lot of money, some people will calm down and work hard. Everyone is the same. Talking and laughing at work becomes a playhouse. The gap between the rich and the poor can generate potential energy, and only companies with potential energy can be motivated.\\n\\nFourth: Meetings will be held in the morning and evening. The great party has more meetings. Everyone learns to learn something. Meetings are a constant unification of thinking. The purpose of meetings is still to distribute benefits. If you can earn 10,000, I will divide you 5,000. If you can earn 5,000, I will divide you 2500. Anyway, it is to constantly emphasize a reasonable distribution system.\\n\\nEveryone will always know what you are thinking, and strengthen your ideas every day. Every day the meeting is held to show the performance, and everyone’s performance yesterday is exposed.\\n\\nIn meetings every day, the managers below, the employees just say what they want to do! Only enterprises can function normally.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, the country holds meetings for the people every day, in the morning we hear about the world, and the news is broadcast in the evening. The purpose is to spread positive energy and unify thinking to make the country stable. I won’t talk about the deep ones. As long as you follow this model, everything will be smoother and smoother. If you don’t believe it, try it. If you feel good, remember to give it to me.
