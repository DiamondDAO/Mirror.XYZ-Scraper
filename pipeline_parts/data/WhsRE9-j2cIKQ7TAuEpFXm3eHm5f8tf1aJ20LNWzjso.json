"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"December 2921\\n\\n \\n 2X21 DECEMBER, The Node Complex, Earth\\n\\nAL sat in the main chamber of the Node Room and began to let the room connect him to the main interface. Tendrils of nanos, liquid peripherals and focused beams joined with him. He was connected to the Inner System. He was \\\"everywhere\\\" all at once. The pain from the Magpie's crashlanding onto the deck of the Node complex was buried by an almost limitless awareness of everything.\\n\\nHe had a passing comforting thought that Jake Jr. was in the Jump Chamber making a bottleneck so that enforcers wouldn't make this far. But a few managed to get through.\\n\\nFaye and some enforcers ran into the Node Room. AL made sure everyone except Faye passed out.\\n\\n\\\"\\\"H\\\", you must stop this!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hi Faye, It's been so long. I'm not stopping anything. And my name is AL. AL Cadmus Tagore.\\\"\\n\\nThe Node Room spoke to AL, \\\"Array retasked, field generators reoriented\\\". Faye grabbed a weapon from an enforcer but it didn't discharge.\\n\\n\\\"You're interfering with the will of the System. The Grand Halt”\\n\\n\\\"The Grand Halt is a flawed plan, doomed from the start.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Manifold displacement underway. Manifold fields unfolding. Manifold activating.\\\" said the Node Room. Suddenly everything went white. Time stopped. It was very quiet.\\n\\nJake Jr. and his crew, woke up, a little stunned. They were standing around confused. They were still in the Jump Chamber. But some were gone. The enforcers were gone. \\\"What the hell happened? Why didn't we make the jump?\\\" Jake Jr. ran towards the Node Room. It was empty. “AL??”\\n\\n\\\"What the hell happened?\\\" asked Faye, in a room that looked like the Node Room.\\n\\n\\\"You're where all of you want to be. You, the \\\"Fosters\\\", the Delegates, Lightmakers. Everyone who pushed and killed for the Grand Halt all these years. I gave you what you wanted. A life shut off from the Stars.\\\"\\n\\nAL was just a voice in a Node Room. It was then silent.\",\"timestamp\":1633972503,\"title\":\"2921: 3.29.1 The Evacuation, Pt. 1, 2921\"},\"digest\":\"qLGlgrnavvfIwosyg1BIZKEvlBh8cClEW5bpquoFNcg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"puVQb2bsEA1xK093JoKMAZLV7SnOmhTvJk8X3lGIVOf3EusVmgQ2cfbagtqn0SyYHeBKVxnX1Js2-oPbccntLg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"6QJcHj6DVTwP6l6IoCqJCuDmSgMz5UKKTCAWwV3q8-g\"}"
