"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Today I was rejected my a great company offering me a great opportunity. I say they are great although after being I rejected I realise they might not be. Especially not for me. Let me tell the story backwards (a classic mistake). After interviewing for a company that I real like for a really nice role, I was rejected for not being social enough. I came off as too shy/nervous they said. Fair maybe, lots of people are nervous during interviews. It wasn’t an interview though. It was a trial day. In general I applaud the concept of a trial day, it gives the applicant and the company a view of each other in the workplace. However, it can also lead to situations such as mine where expectations are mismatched. As I am still under the (maybe false) impression that I could bring a lot to the company, I believe the reason for my (non-)performance was due to the people making the decision not being transparent enough with their expectancies. I sat in the office like an idiot and actually went though the day as if I would be working there. I had the scheduled lunch and chatted with the team when I was told to and tried hard to give my very best on the tasks given to me. What I did not do is initiate many social interactions. I wanted to observe first and then get to know the team slowly and naturally. A mistake, I realise now. What I should have kept in mind is that my performance was being measured. Which I did in a way. I just misjudged which performance they were measuring. I thought it was a test of how I am when I work, they however wanted to see how I am when I play. It was my social skills that were being measured and not my work skills. I learnt the hard way that for this company work is about friends and not about work. Being too focused and not distracted enough by the people around me made me seem aloof and in combination with my resting face (which is of the bitchy kind) I came off as a person that is disinterested and unapproachable. I do admit that this is part of my charm and once you get to know me I am anything but disinterested or unapproachable. It seems however from this and other examples that I need to do the approaching myself however as some people seem too scared. I also think my lack of understanding in this sense makes things even more difficult for me as I struggle to imagine being scared to talk to someone or afraid of their opinion/judgement and so cannot understand my unapproachability. In this case it was best for the company to reject me and to favour the other candidate that was no doubt warmer and more approachable. To my defence during the trial day I felt slightly off. Somehow I realised that the work I did was not that important. I thought however the others must have work to do and didn’t bother people or try to socialise outside of the given opportunities. I also didn’t try to suck up as much to the HR manager as I perhaps should have. This feeling of unmet expectancies loomed over me and overshadowed the final chat, where I felt their dissatisfaction. Unfortunately, I also forgot my final question to them which was how they found me. Perhaps I would have been able to justify my social shortcomings.\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1639477052,\"title\":\"Social Rejection\"},\"digest\":\"J-qVlnFS07-4dZhUJsYpj3Pde5OP76YG5nmx-ilg66w\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xcC1Fa03e8172B22B90a68615872F47D3B703A610\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FfDlpZddWtaluNWXD7W6dN8mFghe_YfwmYHI0PlFQ5k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_S1OW_CAbpMjvy21mU1kFNuJgFXBn-KtdbhSBPu93C8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"rcCHcOWjEN8iI86Ya5grdv4pPMgR5F_OTdfnzEHOZNa6ekTqURGUxxy9oKUrSvQCaV7AYRJQRteTRjL1lbEb6g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x604ab1fb886724196c480c557c059bad0a71cc5d1af0bd5421202517fc744bd96d893a7212cc12082dbde2685be15114ba162a8c9742cf9a71a0be9568d930751b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FfDlpZddWtaluNWXD7W6dN8mFghe_YfwmYHI0PlFQ5k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_S1OW_CAbpMjvy21mU1kFNuJgFXBn-KtdbhSBPu93C8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"J-qVlnFS07-4dZhUJsYpj3Pde5OP76YG5nmx-ilg66w\"}"
