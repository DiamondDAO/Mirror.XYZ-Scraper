Meanwhile, it is currently covering Ethereum, OKExChain, Binance Smart Chain, Huobi Eco Chain, as well as Arbitrum and Optimism and other emerging public chains and layer 2 networks as planned.\\n\\nLoopring is the first zkRollup-based Layer 2 scaling exchange protocol on Ethereum. With the Loopring protocol, DeFi users do not have to make a choice between security and performance. On the premise of ensuring Ethereum-level security, Loopring’s layer 2 scaling technology also provides uers with low-cost, fast transaction and transfer experience.\\n\\n“With the goal of prioritizing the safety of user funds, we have been actively working to create a richer lending market, optimize the execution efficiency of smart contracts, and expand our business scope.” said Ron, the leader of WePiggy core development team. “On the one hand, the launch of the LRC lending market will help to expand the scale of high-quality assets of the WePiggy lending protocol on the Ethereum mainnet. On the other hand, it will also empower the LRC token with borrowing capacity, meet the borrowing needs of the Loopring community.\\n\\n“The Loopring team aims to provide a secure trading infrastructure for the entire ecosystem, and provide users with a safe, high-performance, and low-cost transaction experience.” Loopring founder Daniel Wang said, “The LRC lending market is an important addition to the existing Loopring ecosystem and further expands the LRC’s application scenarios. Hope this cooperation with WePiggy can bring a better user experience.”\\n\\nThe strategic cooperation between the two parties can effectively reduce network usage costs for users, increase the application scenarios of their assets, realize technical exchanges and sharing between communities, and lay a good foundation for future cross-chain/cross-layer ecological construction.\\n\\n## About Loopring\\n\\nLoopring Protocol is a high-performance decentralized trading protocol built on Ethereum.
