"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"On the afternoon of the 24th, Beijing time, a project called OpenDAO quietly went live and announced that it would airdrop token SOS to all interactive users on the NFT trading platform Opensea. Users who have previously traded on OpenSea can receive the tokens they can obtain. Share users’ previous transactions in Opensea and the amount of money spent are related.\\n\\nIn short, this is an airdrop project to users for Opensea, which has previously announced that it may go public and has been criticized for not being Web 3.0. \\n\\nIn the next day, the project received many encrypted KOL attention and praise on Twitter, including Dogecoin founder BillyM2k, NFT collector Pranksy (the first person in the NFT market revenue list), and Zhu Su, founder of Three Arrows Capital, etc. Wait.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Nz1vhnkG2nS-eBHjLWCkX.png?height=192&width=497)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m2wGjm9FxJ0k9y9HYTGyd.png?height=407&width=489)\\n\\nSOS Apocalypse: A user's \\\"power seizure movement\\\" against the company SOS Apocalypse: A user's \\\"power seizure movement\\\" against the company\\nAs the project became more and more popular in the community, the price began to rise, and users who initially had insufficient tokens to pay for GAS began to receive it actively. At 9 o'clock in the evening, Matcha MEXC launched SOS first, and some small trading platforms followed suit, pushing prices to soar further. Kucoin also posted that it has paid attention to SOS and hinted that it will be launched soon.\\n\\nIn the past 24 hours, the price of SOS has risen to 0.000008 USDT. The current average price remains at 0.000007 USDT, which is more than 30 times higher than the initial price. Up to now, more than 100,000 addresses have received SOS token airdrops, and 52.16% of the airdrop tokens have been received. The coin has been claimed. The number of addresses far exceeds that of ConstitutionDAO (16,779) and ENS (60,119) that were on fire before. According to Uniswap data, the 24-hour trading volume of SOS has exceeded 130 million U.S. dollars.\\n\\nSOS Apocalypse: A user's \\\"power seizure movement\\\" against the company\\nAn OpenDAO that suddenly emerged without any announcements, why can this Christmas stir the market so far?\\n\\n(1) What is OpenDAO? What is the economic model of SOS?\\nIt is reported that OpenDAO is a project initiated by the NFT ecological decentralized organization @721DAO. Its main sponsor, contributor, and senior NFT player \\\"9x9x9\\\" initiated the project. 9x9x9 also tweeted to confirm this. At the same time, 721Dao is also in the community Zhong said that it will invest 100 million US dollars in the construction of SOS ecosystem.\\n\\nSOS Apocalypse: A user's \\\"power seizure movement\\\" against the company\\nAccording to the official website, the original intention of SOS tokens was to thank all NFT creators, collectors and markets for nurturing the entire NFT ecosystem, especially OpenSea for its leadership in promoting NFT transactions. \\\"In order to pay tribute, we chose OpenSea collectors for our airdrop.\\\"\\n\\nThe specific number of airdrops is determined by the total number of transactions and the funds spent (ETH, DAI, and USDC). The former weights 30% and the latter 70%; at the same time, users must claim the SOS token before June 30, 2022 , Otherwise it will be disqualified.\\n\\nAccording to the plan, the total number of SOS is 100 trillion, of which 50% are used as airdrops, 20% are used as staking rewards, 10% are used as LP rewards, and the last 20% is reserved for OpneDAO. OpenDAO will use this 20% to compensate verified victims of fraud on OpenSea, support emerging artists and their original works, support the NFT community, support art preservation, and participate in developer grants for the $SOS ecosystem.\\n\\nThis generation of token distribution mechanism has also been questioned by the community. Some people believe that in addition to the airdrops to be applied for, OpenDAO still holds at least 50% of the tokens. There is no lock-up time and there is a risk of cashing out.\\n\\nIn this regard, the promoter \\\"9x9x9\\\" stated that he is free to work for @The_OpenDAO, and the SOS tokens he currently has he bought by himself. \\\"But you know I am not for the money, otherwise, I will buy it within the first hour (of issuing the currency) instead of 10 times (the time to buy).\\\"\\n\\nSOS Apocalypse: A user's \\\"power seizure movement\\\" against the company\\nIn addition, @QuadrataNetwork Chief Technology Officer FabdaRice said that OpenDAO's airdrop procedure has loopholes and the number of claims can be modified at will, but the official has not yet responded to the problem.\\n\\nAs of the post, according to the latest official data, more than 52% of airdrop tokens have been claimed, totaling more than 102,000 addresses.\\n\\n(2) The second SUSHI? The second PEOPLE?\\nOpenDAO's rush to issue tokens to attract Opensea users reminds many people of SushiSwap last year. As an imitator, SushiSwap once took away Uniswap's liquidity and users, and once became the leader in the DEX field.\\n\\nHowever, this comparison is obviously somewhat unrealistic. After all, OpenDAO has just been established, and it is still unknown whether it will develop a trading platform. Moreover, SUSHI was the attraction of high-yield in the boom of DeFi liquidity mining at that time, allowing users to continue to contribute liquidity. NFT Marketplace is another story. However, with the support of a large number of large NFT players, such a prospect is expected to be reasonable.\\n\\nBut these blueprints for value support are still too early. At present, for most ordinary traders, SOS is still like the smashing MEME coins such as Doge, SHIB, People, and GM. It is a \\\"zero elimination game\\\" (referring to tokens). The unit price is low, and the decimal point is eliminated through a huge increase in the later period).\\n\\nIn the community, you can also see a large number of publicity slogans with FOMO sentiment, mutual \\\"calling orders\\\", indicating that they are \\\"clearing PEOPLE, stud SOS\\\", and every MEME boom does not seem to be significantly different.\\n\\nYou can also see some bad voices. Cole, the initiator of the NFT project Pudgy Penguins, said: \\\"I sold all my SOS tokens. I know what I am doing. This \\\"shit coin\\\" is crazy, hahaha . I like this token, but I think I can get cheaper chips in the future. \\\"\\n\\nSOS Apocalypse: A user's \\\"power seizure movement\\\" against the company\\n(3) Thinking: Web3 products will not be airdropped, someone will grab you in front of you\\nRegardless of the price trend of SOS, whether OpenDAO can meet the expectations of users and make practical applications, this incident has caused many people to talk about: products in the Web3 era do not issue coins, we can reward users for you and suck your traffic , It will hit you on dimensionality reduction. Even everyone is still enthusiastically discussing in the community: how to airdrop Metamask.\\n\\nNot long ago, when the news that OpenSea was planning an IPO came out, there was a lot of criticism from the community. Hundreds of thousands of Web 3.0 users frequently trade and contribute fees to make OpenSea earn a lot of money and become famous, but now you want to give these benefits to the capital of Web 2.0? Are we going to buy Opensea stock?\\n\\nThe story of \\\"The Dragon Slayer Becomes an Evil Dragon\\\" is not uncommon in the commercial stories of Web 2, and the example of SOS is showing us another narrative possibility: water can carry a boat, and it can also overturn it; you can’t, we Do it for you; if you don't reward the person who should be rewarded, the user will \\\"Dao\\\" you.\\n\\nAs Sky9 Capital partner Vincent said: In Web2, your \\\"value behavior\\\" will only bring \\\"value\\\" to the company that provides the service, and it has nothing to do with you. In Web3, your \\\"value behavior\\\" will bring you \\\"value\\\" sooner or later. Don't worry if Opensea does not issue native tokens. On the chain, the user's data is the user's own, and your on-chain behavior is traceable. These valuable behaviors are not rewarded by the OS. Others can give you back. SOS has already started, and LooksRare will also send airdrops to OS users. So you can do what you should do on the chain, and your \\\"value behavior\\\" will bring you \\\"value\\\" sooner or later, the magical Web3.\\n\\nIn this industry, data is really a gold mine. Various applications in Web2.0 have been buried for a long time. Most of the data is redundant data, which is useless. The core is that user information is difficult to get through and the portrait is incomplete. Every txn on the chain is a \\\"high-value\\\" user behavior (after all, it bears a high gas fee), filtering a large amount of useless or low-value behavior data, and at the same time opening up the user behavior of thousands of dApps. The filtering/analysis/processing of these data can produce countless scenarios. From capturing transaction opportunities, to finding accurate user address groups, to forming chain identities and social relationships, everything is an opportunity of more than tens of billions of dollars. .\\n\\nChen Yuetian, a partner of Fire Phoenix Capital, has the same view. He believes that this is very innovative and fundamentalist. This is the concept when Web 2 was first proposed, and it was realized in Web 3. This is a \\\"power seizure movement\\\". \\\".\\n\\nInnovation may fail and there will be problems, but the thinking that innovation brings us will always be valuable。\",\"timestamp\":1640574588,\"title\":\"SOS Apocalypse: A user's \\\"power seizure movement\\\" against the company\"},\"digest\":\"5wA-JybJvTDvPXfu5yYVAWLExrj90Brp43wLX2P_Bhc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x19a23AfB21e123c626C2c4C19c34d2037Ac35734\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"agnKCQY10QTg9o2FmqhOjlWipewdJRKntrV3NVa5s7I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"SEnns0IOezXAmG3q1oE2-8BOCF4kc6WzT_2b3lYKBfY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"G548ac1U7U5WP8nKRatUQ2yo2OlCVg_6Jy4KACuEK7_UQa-UHL6onP6m358INz6ujwEClqYEvNEBj3KARObeiA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x46fc7664e155608b54fe173f7e63180c17622cc2e5ce466552d0020b165136d1476659c2b543561b12aaf872c13ea2481165ff10f4bf76da0d2fb4d5796f9fd31b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"agnKCQY10QTg9o2FmqhOjlWipewdJRKntrV3NVa5s7I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"SEnns0IOezXAmG3q1oE2-8BOCF4kc6WzT_2b3lYKBfY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"5wA-JybJvTDvPXfu5yYVAWLExrj90Brp43wLX2P_Bhc\"}"
