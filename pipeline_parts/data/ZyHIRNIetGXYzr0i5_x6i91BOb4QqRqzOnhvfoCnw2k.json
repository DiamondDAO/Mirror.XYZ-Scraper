If you’re reading this post, congratulations on being part of a revolutionary movement! You’re invited to CyberConnect’s very first social event and get a head start on building your Web3 social profile and connections. \\n\\n## #LetsCyberConnect\\n\\nJoin us in building a Web3-native social system! All you need to do is \\n\\n1. create an account at CyberConnect\\n2. CyberConnect will fellow web3 dwellers and\\n3. tell your Web2 friends about it. \\n\\nTo express our gratitude for early supporters, we got some exclusive POAPs and NFTs for you!\\n\\n\\\\#LetsCyberConnect ends on January 5th, 2022 at 1AM UTC.\\n\\n## What’s in it for me?\\n\\nYou don’t own your connections, whichever platform they are on. This is not an overstatement, it’s a fact. Think about it, your existing connections don’t follow you across any social channel, and every time you migrate to a new platform, you’ll have to reestablish your identity, profile, and connections.\\n\\nWe topple that model and put you back in control of your own social connections. By simply linking your wallet to CyberConnect, you can claim all of your connections throughout Web3, regardless of the platform you choose to engage with. You will be able to travel across all the dApps built on CyberConnect with all of your friends right there waiting for you.\\n\\n## How do I Participate?\\n\\nHead over to [CyberConnect WebApp](https://app.cyberconnect.me) and connect your wallet via either MetaMask or Wallet Connect. Once you're connected, a good way to start your journey is to check out the recommendation list. You can also search people you know with Ethereum addresses and ENS domain names.\\n\\n![CyberConnect WebApp Plaza Page](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/B08khHZZ1ZD1E-ATJ16M9.png?height=1184&width=1565&size=medium)\\n\\nShare your CyberConnect profile on social media with all of your Web2 friends. It's time, to truly own your social connections for the very first time. \\n\\n## Rewards\\n\\n### Web3 KOLs POAP\\n\\nBy the end of #LetsCyberConnect, the top 100 addresses with the most followers can claim a limited edition \\\"Web3 KOLs\\\" POAP, celebrating you being one of the first crypto-native KOLs.

All POAPs are created with the ERC-721 standard minted on xDai.\\n\\n### About CyberConnect\\n\\nWe here at CyberConnect are building the first social graph protocol that democratizes social connections. Aligning with the thesis of Web3, we return the ownership of social graph data back to users themselves.\\n\\n### CyberConnect Protocol\\n\\nThe CyberConnect Protocol is fully decentralized, allowing blockchain users to update and access their own social graphs. A user-friendly API will be built on top of CyberConnect Protocol and application developers can easily integrate and access the whole user generated social graphs on Web3.\\n\\n**[Landing Page: https://cyberconnect.me/](https://cyberconnect.me/)**\\n\\n**[App](https://app.cyberconnect.me/plaza) [https://app.cyberconnect.me](https://app.cyberconnect.me)**\\n\\n**[Developer Docs https://cyberconnect.fyi/docs](https://cyberconnect.fyi/docs)**\\n\\n**[Mirror Blog https://cyberconnect.fyi/mirror](https://cyberconnect.fyi/mirror)**\\n\\n**[Discord https://cyberconnect.fyi/discord](https://cyberconnect.fyi/discord)**\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1639184367,\"title\":\"#Let'sCyberConnect  \"},\"digest\":\"434yOD6TBEI7iea3MBAW3MrqQ-SyME8IPTT2ZEkshz4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x148D59faF10b52063071eDdf4Aaf63A395f2d41c\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-pvCuz5j9LM0ZlWKELufu_oldiVR28vgZJg-x97-ov4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4rzbh_pb_ae_vSjpbt7FM0IvMDs1k8vMoaZ2APiU0Pc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"t_TF-q1Lk8IRmxenvgZu2fTiWctrDVjX5ovc8j_XUrPBN1tFNExGHKZuQUskaIu7P9VIrM-sj4QESitKnTQLKg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2bc11dafd20f81ad522de1187c41f9a91e5aaa9d7b42ed078bfb0fea2e81f83c6108bf916bd3fa0c5092e02e9435fd4ea496fd1071b22abab5e64cde8867ad171b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-pvCuz5j9LM0ZlWKELufu_oldiVR28vgZJg-x97-ov4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4rzbh_pb_ae_vSjpbt7FM0IvMDs1k8vMoaZ2APiU0Pc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"434yOD6TBEI7iea3MBAW3MrqQ-SyME8IPTT2ZEkshz4\"}"
