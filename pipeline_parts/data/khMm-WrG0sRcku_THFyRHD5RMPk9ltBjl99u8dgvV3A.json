Beyond that, only 2018 stands in the way of new all-time highs, that year nonetheless seeing a significantly higher ceiling of up to 0.15 on some exchanges.\\n\\nIn United States dollar terms, the picture is similarly promising, Ether having set repeated new records in early November and staying broadly within 20% of $5,000 since.\\n\\n“This in theory should be the part where if strength continues we see that strong run based on structure,” fellow trader Pentoshi tweeted as part of [separate comments](https://twitter.com/Pentosh1/status/1466517835631505414) on Ether Friday.\\n\\nWhile [not everything](https://cointelegraph.com/news/regulatory-fears-put-a-damper-on-ethereum-traders-5-000-target) points to the $5,000 level falling, ETH/USD traded at around $4,550 at the time of writing.\\n\\n![ETH/USD 1-day candle chart (Bitstamp).
