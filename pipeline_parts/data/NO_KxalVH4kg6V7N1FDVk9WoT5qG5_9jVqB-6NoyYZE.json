"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"At Songcamp, we run ‚Äú*Camps‚Äù* ‚Äî cohorted projects that test out different ideas around music making, collective creation and distribution.\\n\\nSo far, we've run 2 camps:\\n\\n* **Camp Genesis** ‚Äî a group of 13 musicians, visual artists and project operatives created 3 songs, cover artwork and an [innovative NFT rollout](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/).\\n* **Camp Elektra** ‚Äî a group of 42 artists, devs and project operatives came together to create a pop-up production house + songwriting camp. Over two months, they built out the interactive story, art and world of *Elektra* -- a faraway planet where music is the ultimate source of energy. This resulted in a [lore-based NFT crowdfund](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/mkb-m9GWUCLByETAvCigJ0JIpz4XH8bwNDBtUJBPeFc), an audio-visual telling of the Elektra story [through](https://zora.co/collections/zora/4176) [multiple](https://zora.co/collections/zora/4280) [NFTs](https://zora.co/collections/zora/4435), and the release of [3 incredible songs](https://elektra.camp/#/) that would help save the dying world of Elektra. Oh..and Elektra is now spinning out into [its own DAO](https://discord.gg/hrX4yRJP) to continue building out the world.\\n\\nAll that to say, we've been busy. These projects take a lot of curation, container building and coordination. So recently we thought about how we could get a new stream going in Songcamp that could have a bit of a quicker, more inclusive flow.\\n\\n### Enter Minicamps.\\n\\nMinicamps are week-long songwriting competitions for a chance to win a coveted web3 placement.
