"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"Of you I was told the same,\\\" said Benedick.\\n\\n\\\"Here's your own hand in evidence of your love,\\\" said Claudio, producing a feeble sonnet which Benedick had written to his sweetheart.  \\\"And here,\\\" said Hero, \\\"is a tribute to Benedick, which I picked out of the ' pocket of Beatrice.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A miracle!\\\" exclaimed Benedick.  \\\"Our hands are against our hearts!

Not even the news of the capture of Don John was able to stop the flying feet of the happy lovers, for revenge is not sweet against an evil man who has failed to do harm.\\n\\nROMEO AND JULIET\\n\\nOnce upon a time there lived in Verona two great families named Montagu and Capulet.  They were both rich, and I suppose they were as sensible, in most things, as other rich people.  But in one thing they were extremely silly.  There was an old, old quarrel between the two families, and instead of making it up like reasonable folks, they made a sort of pet of their quarrel, and would not let it die out.  So that a Montagu wouldn't speak to a Capulet if he met one in the street--nor a Capulet to a Montagu--or if they did speak, it was to say rude and unpleasant things, which often ended in a fight.  And their relations and servants were just as foolish, so that street fights and duels and uncomfortablenesses of that kind were always growing out of the Montagu-and-Capulet quarrel.\\n\\nNow Lord Capulet, the head of that family, gave a party-- a grand supper and a dance--and he was so hospitable that he said anyone might come to it except (of course) the Montagues.  But there was a young Montagu named Romeo, who very much wanted to be there, because Rosaline, the lady he loved, had been asked.  This lady had never been at all kind to him, and he had no reason to love her; but the fact was that he wanted to love somebody, and as he hadn't seen the right lady, he was obliged to love the wrong one. So to the Capulet's grand party he came, with his friends Mercutio and Benvolio.\\n\\nOld Capulet welcomed him and his two friends very kindly--and young Romeo moved about among the crowd of courtly folk dressed in their velvets and satins, the men with jeweled sword hilts and collars, and the ladies with brilliant gems on breast and arms, and stones of price set in their bright girdles.  Romeo was in his best too, and though he wore a black mask over his eyes and nose, everyone could see by his mouth and his hair, and the way he held his head, that he was twelve times handsomer than anyone else in the room.\\n\\nPresently amid the dancers he saw a lady so beautiful and so lovable that from that moment he never again gave one thought to that Rosaline whom he had thought he loved.  And he looked at this other fair lady, as she moved in the dance in her white satin and pearls, and all the world seemed vain and worthless to him compared with her.  And he was saying this, or something like it, when Tybalt, Lady Capulet's nephew, hearing his voice, knew him to be Romeo.  Tybalt, being very angry, went at once to his uncle, and told him how a Montagu had come uninvited to the feast; but old Capulet was too fine a gentleman to be discourteous to any man under his own roof, and he bade Tybalt be quiet.  But this young man only waited for a chance to quarrel with Romeo.\\n\\nIn the meantime Romeo made his way to the fair lady, and told her in sweet words that he loved her, and kissed her.  Just then her mother sent for her, and then Romeo found out that the lady on whom he had set his heart's hopes was Juliet, the daughter of Lord Capulet, his sworn foe.  So he went away, sorrowing indeed, but loving her none the less.\\n\\nThen Juliet said to her nurse:\\n\\n\\\"Who is that gentleman that would not dance?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"His name is Romeo, and a Montagu, the only son of your great enemy,\\\" answered the nurse.\\n\\nThen Juliet went to her room, and looked out of her window, over the beautiful green-grey garden, where the moon was shining.  And Romeo was hidden in that garden among the trees--because he could not bear to go right away without trying to see her again.  So she--not knowing him to be there--spoke her secret thought aloud, and told the quiet garden how she loved Romeo.\\n\\nAnd Romeo heard and was glad beyond measure.  Hidden below, he looked up and saw her fair face in the moonlight, framed in the blossoming creepers that grew round her window, and as he looked and listened, he felt as though he had been carried away in a dream, and set down by some magician in that beautiful and enchanted garden.\\n\\n\\\"Ah--why are you called Romeo?\\\" said Juliet.  \\\"Since I love you, what does it matter what you are called?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized--henceforth I never will be Romeo,\\\" he cried, stepping into the full white moonlight from the shade of the cypresses and oleanders that had hidden him.\\n\\nShe was frightened at first, but when she saw that it was Romeo himself, and no stranger, she too was glad, and, he standing in the garden below and she leaning from the window, they spoke long together, each one trying to find the sweetest words in the world, to make that pleasant talk that lovers use.  And the tale of all they said, and the sweet music their voices made together, is all set down in a golden book, where you children may read it for yourselves some day.\\n\\nAnd the time passed so quickly, as it does for folk who love each other and are together, that when the time came to part, it seemed as though they had met but that moment-- and indeed they hardly knew how to part.\\n\\n\\\"I will send to you to-morrow,\\\" said Juliet.\\n\\nAnd so at last, with lingering and longing, they said good-bye.\\n\\nJuliet went into her room, and a dark curtain bid her bright window. Romeo went away through the still and dewy garden like a man in a dream.\\n\\nThe next morning, very early, Romeo went to Friar Laurence, a priest, and, telling him all the story, begged him to marry him to Juliet without delay.  And this, after some talk, the priest consented to do.\\n\\nSo when Juliet sent her old nurse to Romeo that day to know what he purposed to do, the old woman took back a a message that all was well, and all things ready for the marriage of Juliet and Romeo on the next morning.\\n\\nThe young lovers were afraid to ask their parents' consent to their marriage, as young people should do, because of this foolish old quarrel between the Capulets and the Montagues.\\n\\nAnd Friar Laurence was willing to help the young lovers secretly, because he thought that when they were once married their parents might soon be told, and that the match might put a happy end to the old quarrel.\\n\\nSo the next morning early, Romeo and Juliet were married at Friar Laurence's cell, and parted with tears and kisses.  And Romeo promised to come into the garden that evening, and the nurse got ready a rope-ladder to let down from the window, so that Romeo could climb up and talk to his dear wife quietly and alone.\\n\\nBut that very day a dreadful thing happened.\\n\\nTybalt, the young man who had been so vexed at Romeo's going to the Capulet's feast, met him and his two friends, Mercutio and Benvolio, in the street, called Romeo a villain, and asked him to fight.  Romeo had no wish to fight with Juliet's cousin, but Mercutio drew his sword, and he and Tybalt fought.  And Mercutio was killed.  When Romeo saw that this friend was dead, he forgot everything except anger at the man who had killed him, and he and Tybalt fought till Tybalt fell dead.\\n\\nSo, on the very day of his wedding, Romeo killed his dear Juliet's cousin, and was sentenced to be banished.  Poor Juliet and her young husband met that night indeed; he climbed the rope-ladder among the flowers, and found her window, but their meeting was a sad one, and they parted with bitter tears and hearts heavy, because they could not know when they should meet again.\\n\\nNow Juliet's father, who, of course, had no idea that she was married, wished her to wed a gentleman named Paris, and was so angry when she refused, that she hurried away to ask Friar Laurence what she should do.  He advised her to pretend to consent, and then he said:\\n\\n\\\"I will give you a draught that will make you seem to be dead for two days, and then when they take you to church it will be to bury you, and not to marry you.  They will put you in the vault thinking you are dead, and before you wake up Romeo and I will be there to take care of you.  Will you do this, or are you afraid?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will do it; talk not to me of fear!\\\" said Juliet.  And she went home and told her father she would marry Paris.  If she had spoken out and told her father the truth .  .  .  well, then this would have been a different story.\\n\\nLord Capulet was very much pleased to get his own way, and set about inviting his friends and getting the wedding feast ready. Everyone stayed up all night, for there was a great deal to do, and very little time to do it in.  Lord Capulet was anxious to get Juliet married because he saw she was very unhappy.  Of course she was really fretting about her husband Romeo, but her father thought she was grieving for the death of her cousin Tybalt, and he thought marriage would give her something else to think about.\\n\\nEarly in the morning the nurse came to call Juliet, and to dress her for her wedding; but she would not wake, and at last the nurse cried out suddenly--\\n\\n\\\"Alas! alas! help! help! my lady's dead! Oh, well-a-day that ever I was born!\\\"\\n\\nLady Capulet came running in, and then Lord Capulet, and Lord Paris, the bridegroom.  There lay Juliet cold and white and lifeless, and all their weeping could not wake her.  So it was a burying that day instead of a marrying.  Meantime Friar Laurence had sent a messenger to Mantua with a letter to Romeo telling him of all these things; and all would have been well, only the messenger was delayed, and could not go.\\n\\nBut ill news travels fast.  Romeo's servant who knew the secret of the marriage, but not of Juliet's pretended death, heard of her funeral, and hurried to Mantua to tell Romeo how his young wife was dead and lying in the grave.\\n\\n\\\"Is it so?\\\" cried Romeo, heart-broken.  \\\"Then I will lie by Juliet's side to-night.\\\"\\n\\nAnd he bought himself a poison, and went straight back to Verona. He hastened to the tomb where Juliet was lying.  It was not a grave, but a vault.  He broke open the door, and was just going down the stone steps that led to the vault where all the dead Capulets lay, when he heard a voice bebind him calling on him to stop.\\n\\nIt was the Count Paris, who was to have married Juliet that very day.\\n\\n\\\"How dare you come here and disturb the dead bodies of the Capulets, you vile Montagu?\\\" cried Paris.\\n\\nPoor Romeo, half mad with sorrow, yet tried to answer gently.\\n\\n\\\"You were told,\\\" said Paris, \\\"that if you returned to Verona you must die.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I must indeed,\\\" said Romeo.  \\\"I came here for nothing else.  Good, gentle youth--leave me!  Oh, go--before I do you any harm!  I love you better than myself--go--leave me here--\\\"\\n\\nThen Paris said, \\\"I defy you, and I arrest you as a felon,\\\" and Romeo, in his anger and despair, drew his sword.  They fought, and Paris was killed.\\n\\nAs Romeo's sword pierced him, Paris cried--\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I am slain!  If thou be merciful, open the tomb, and lay me with Juliet!\\\"\\n\\nAnd Romeo said, \\\"In faith I will.\\\"\\n\\nAnd he carried the dead man into the tomb and laid him by the dear Juliet's side.  Then he kneeled by Juliet and spoke to her, and held her in his arms, and kissed her cold lips, believing that she was dead, while all the while she was coming nearer and nearer to the time of her awakening.  Then he drank the poison, and died beside his sweetheart and wife.\\n\\nNow came Friar Laurence when it was too late, and saw all that had happened--and then poor Juliet woke out of her sleep to find her husband and her friend both dead beside her.\\n\\nThe noise of the fight had brought other folks to the place too, and Friar Laurence, hearing them, ran away, and Juliet was left alone.  She saw the cup that had held the poison, and knew how all had happened, and since no poison was left for her, she drew her Romeo's dagger and thrust it through her heart--and so, falling with her head on her Romeo's breast, she died.  And here ends the story of these faithful and most unhappy lovers.\\n\\n```\\n        *    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n```\\n\\nAnd when the old folks knew from Friar Laurence of all that had befallen, they sorrowed exceedingly, and now, seeing all the mischief their wicked quarrel had wrought, they repented them of it, and over the bodies of their dead children they clasped hands at last, in friendship and forgiveness.\\n\\nPERICLES\\n\\nPericles, the Prince of Tyre, was unfortunate enough to make an enemy of Antiochus, the powerful and wicked King of Antioch; and so great was the danger in which he stood that, on the advice of his trusty counselor, Lord Helicanus, he determined to travel about the world for a time.  He came to this decision despite the fact that, by the death of his father, he was now King of Tyre. So he set sail for Tarsus, appointing Helicanus Regent during his absence.  That he did wisely in thus leaving his kingdom was soon made clear.\\n\\nHardly had he sailed on his voyage, when Lord Thaliard arrived from Antioch with instructions from his royal master to kill Pericles. The faithful Helicanus soon discovered the deadly purpose of this wicked lord, and at once sent messengers to Tarsus to warn the King of the danger which threatened him.\\n\\nThe people of Tarsus were in such poverty and distress that Pericles, feeling that he could find no safe refuge there, put to sea again. But a dreadful storm overtook the ship in which he was, and the good vessel was wrecked, while of all on board only Pericles was saved.  Bruised and wet and faint, he was flung upon the cruel rocks on the coast of Pentapolis, the country of the good King Simonides.  Worn out as he was, he looked for nothing but death, and that speedily.  But some fishermen, coming down to the beach, found him there, and gave him clothes and bade him be of good cheer.\\n\\n\\\"Thou shalt come home with me,\\\" said one of them, \\\"and we will have flesh for holidays, fish for fasting days, and moreo'er, puddings and flapjacks, and thou shalt be welcome.\\\"\\n\\nThey told him that on the morrow many princes and knights were going to the King's Court, there to joust and tourney for the love of his daughter, the beautiful Princess Thaisa\\n\\n\\\"Did but my fortunes equal my desires,\\\" said Pericles, \\\"I'd wish to make one there.\\\"\\n\\nAs he spoke, some of the fishermen came by, drawing their net, and it dragged heavily, resisting all their efforts, but at last they hauled it in, to find that it contained a suit of rusty armor; and looking at it, he blessed Fortune for her kindness, for he saw that it was his own, which had been given to him by his dead father.  He begged the fishermen to let him have it that he might go to Court and take part in the tournament, promising that if ever his ill fortunes bettered, he would reward them well.  The fishermen readily consented, and being thus fully equipped, Pericles set off in his rusty armor to the King's Court.\\n\\nIn the tournament none bore himself so well as Pericles, and he won the wreath of victory, which the fair Princess herself placed on his brows.  Then at her father's command she asked him who he was, and whence he came; and he answered that he was a knight of Tyre, by name Pericles, but he did not tell her that he was the King of that country, for he knew that if once his whereabouts became known to Antiochus, his life would not be worth a pin's purchase.\\n\\nNevertheless Thaisa loved him dearly, and the King was so pleased with his courage and graceful bearing that he gladly permitted his daughter to have her own way, when she told him she would marry the stranger knight or die.\\n\\nThus Pericles became the husband of the fair lady for whose sake he had striven with the knights who came in all their bravery to joust and tourney for her love.\\n\\nMeanwhile the wicked King Antiochus had died, and the people in Tyre, hearing no news of their King, urged Lord Helicanus to ascend the vacant throne.  But they could only get him to promise that he would become their King, if at the end of a year Pericles did not come back.  Moreover, he sent forth messengers far and wide in search of the missing Pericles.\\n\\nSome of these made their way to Pentapolis, and finding their King there, told him how discontented his people were at his long absence, and that, Antiochus being dead, there was nothing now to hinder him from returning to his kingdom.  Then Pericles told his wife and father-in-law who he really was, and they and all the subjects of Simonides greatly rejoiced to know that the gallant husband of Thaisa was a King in his own right.  So Pericles set sail with his dear wife for his native land.  But once more the sea was cruel to him, for again a dreadful storm broke out, and while it was at its height, a servant came to tell him that a little daughter was born to him.  This news would have made his heart glad indeed, but that the servant went on to add that his wife--his dear, dear Thaisa--was dead.\\n\\nWhile he was praying the gods to be good to his little baby girl, the sailors came to him, declaring that the dead Queen must be thrown overboard, for they believed that the storm would never cease so long as a dead body remained in the vessel.  So Thaisa was laid in a big chest with spices and jewels, and a scroll on which the sorrowful King wrote these lines:\\n\\n\\\"Here I give to understand     (If e'er this coffin drive a-land),     I, King Pericles, have lost     This Queen worth all our mundane cost.     Who finds her, give her burying;     She was the daughter of a King;     Besides this treasure for a fee,     The gods requite his charity!\\\"\\n\\nThen the chest was cast into the sea, and the waves taking it, by and by washed it ashore at Ephesus, where it was found by the servants of a lord named Cerimon.  He at once ordered it to be opened, and when he saw how lovely Thaisa looked, he doubted if she were dead, and took immediate steps to restore her.  Then a great wonder happened, for she, who had been thrown into the sea as dead, came back to life.  But feeling sure that she would never see her husband again, Thaisa retired from the world, and became a priestess of the Goddess Diana.\\n\\nWhile these things were happening, Pericles went on to Tarsus with his little daughter, whom he called Marina, because she had been born at sea.  Leaving her in the hands of his old friend the Governor of Tarsus, the King sailed for his own dominions.\\n\\nNow Dionyza, the wife of the Governor of Tarsus, was a jealous and wicked woman, and finding that the young Princess grew up a more accomplished and charming girl than her own daughter, she determined to take Marina's life.  So when Marina was fourteen, Dionyza ordered one of her servants to take her away and kill her.  This villain would have done so, but that he was interrupted by some pirates who came in and carried Marina off to sea with them, and took her to Mitylene, where they sold her as a slave.  Yet such was her goodness, her grace, and her beauty, that she soon became honored there, and Lysimachus, the young Governor, fell deep in love with her, and would have married her, but that he thought she must be of too humble parentage to become the wife of one in his high position.\\n\\nThe wicked Dionyza believed, from her servant's report, that Marina was really dead, and so she put up a monument to her memory, and showed it to King Pericles, when after long years of absence he came to see his much-loved child.  When he heard that she was dead, his grief was terrible to see.  He set sail once more, and putting on sackcloth, vowed never to wash his face or cut his hair again.  There was a pavilion erected on deck, and there he lay alone, and for three months he spoke word to none.\\n\\nAt last it chanced that his ship came into the port of Mitylene, and Lysimachus, the Governor, went on board to enquire whence the vessel came.  When he heard the story of Pericles' sorrow and silence, he bethought him of Marina, and believing that she could rouse the King from his stupor, sent for her and bade her try her utmost to persuade the King to speak, promising whatever reward she would, if she succeeded.  Marina gladly obeyed, and sending the rest away, she sat and sang to her poor grief-laden father, yet, sweet as was her voice, he made no sign.  So presently she spoke to him, saying that her grief might equal his, for, though she was a slave, she came from ancestors that stood equal to mighty kings.\\n\\nSomething in her voice and story touched the King's heart, and he looked up at her, and as he looked, he saw with wonder how like she was to his lost wife, so with a great hope springing up in his heart, he bade her tell her story.\\n\\nThen, with many interruptions from the King, she told him who she was and how she had escaped from the cruel Dionyza.  So Pericles knew that this was indeed his daughter, and he kissed her again and again, crying that his great seas of joy drowned him with their sweetness.  \\\"Give me my robes,\\\" he said: \\\"O Heaven, bless my girl!\\\"\\n\\nThen there came to him, though none else could hear it, the sound of heavenly music, and falling asleep, he beheld the goddess Diana, in a vision.\\n\\n\\\"Go,\\\" she said to him, \\\"to my temple at Ephesus, and when my maiden priests are met together, reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife.\\\"\\n\\nPericles obeyed the goddess and told his tale before her altar. Hardly had he made an end, when the chief priestess, crying out, \\\"You are--you are--O royal Pericles!\\\" fell fainting to the ground, and presently recovering, she spoke again to him, \\\"O my lord, are you not Pericles?\\\"  \\\"The voice of dead Thaisa!\\\" exclaimed the King in wonder.  \\\"That Thaisa am I,\\\" she said, and looking at her he saw that she spoke the very truth.\\n\\nThus Pericles and Thaisa, after long and bitter suffering, found happiness once more, and in the joy of their meeting they forgot the pain of the past.  To Marina great happiness was given, and not only in being restored to her dear parents; for she married Lysimachus, and became a princess in the land where she had been sold as a slave.\\n\\nHAMLET\\n\\nHamlet was the only son of the King of Denmark.  He loved his father and mother dearly--and was happy in the love of a sweet lady named Ophelia.  Her father, Polonius, was the King's Chamberlain.\\n\\nWhile Hamlet was away studying at Wittenberg, his father died. Young Hamlet hastened home in great grief to hear that a serpent had stung the King, and that he was dead.  The young Prince had loved his father so tenderly that you may judge what he felt when he found that the Queen, before yet the King had been laid in the ground a month, had determined to marry again--and to marry the dead King's brother.\\n\\nHamlet refused to put off mourning for the wedding.\\n\\n\\\"It is not only the black I wear on my body,\\\" he said, \\\"that proves my loss.  I wear mourning in my heart for my dead father.  His son at least remembers him, and grieves still.\\\"\\n\\nThen said Claudius the King's brother, \\\"This grief is unreasonable. Of course you must sorrow at the loss of your father, but--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah,\\\" said Hamlet, bitterly, \\\"I cannot in one little month forget those I love.\\\"\\n\\nWith that the Queen and Claudius left him, to make merry over their wedding, forgetting the poor good King who had been so kind to them both.\\n\\nAnd Hamlet, left alone, began to wonder and to question as to what he ought to do.  For he could not believe the story about the snake-bite.  It seemed to him all too plain that the wicked Claudius had killed the King, so as to get the crown and marry the Queen. Yet he had no proof, and could not accuse Claudius.\\n\\nAnd while he was thus thinking came Horatio, a fellow student of his, from Wittenberg.\\n\\n\\\"What brought you here?\\\" asked Hamlet, when he had greeted his friend kindly.\\n\\n\\\"I came, my lord, to see your father's funeral.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think it was to see my mother's wedding,\\\" said Hamlet, bitterly. \\\"My father!  We shall not look upon his like again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My lord,\\\" answered Horatio, \\\"I think I saw him yesternight.\\\"\\n\\nThen, while Hamlet listened in surprise, Horatio told how he, with two gentlemen of the guard, had seen the King's ghost on the battlements.  Hamlet went that night, and true enough, at midnight, the ghost of the King, in the armor he had been wont to wear, appeared on the battlements in the chill moonlight.  Hamlet was a brave youth.  Instead of running away from the ghost he spoke to it--and when it beckoned him he followed it to a quiet place, and there the ghost told him that what he had suspected was true. The wicked Claudius had indeed killed his good brother the King, by dropping poison into his ear as he slept in his orchard in the afternoon.\\n\\n\\\"And you,\\\" said the ghost, \\\"must avenge this cruel murder-- on my wicked brother.  But do nothing against the Queen-- for I have loved her, and she is your mother.  Remember me.\\\"\\n\\nThen seeing the morning approach, the ghost vanished.\\n\\n\\\"Now,\\\" said Hamlet, \\\"there is nothing left but revenge.  Remember thee--I will remember nothing else--books, pleasure, youth--let all go--and your commands alone live on my brain.\\\"\\n\\nSo when his friends came back he made them swear to keep the secret of the ghost, and then went in from the battlements, now gray with mingled dawn and moonlight, to think how he might best avenge his murdered father.\\n\\nThe shock of seeing and hearing his father's ghost made him feel almost mad, and for fear that his uncle might notice that he was not himself, he determined to hide his mad longing for revenge under a pretended madness in other matters.\\n\\nAnd when he met Ophelia, who loved him--and to whom he had given gifts, and letters, and many loving words--he behaved so wildly to her, that she could not but think him mad.  For she loved him so that she could not believe he would be as cruel as this, unless he were quite mad.  So she told her father, and showed him a pretty letter from Hamlet.  And in the letter was much folly, and this pretty verse--\\n\\n```\\n   \\\"Doubt that the stars are fire;           Doubt that the sun doth move;         Doubt truth to be a liar;           But never doubt I love.\\\"\\n```\\n\\nAnd from that time everyone believed that the cause of Hamlet's supposed madness was love.\\n\\nPoor Hamlet was very unhappy.  He longed to obey his father's ghost--and yet he was too gentle and kindly to wish to kill another man, even his father's murderer.  And sometimes he wondered whether, after all, the ghost spoke truly.\\n\\nJust at this time some actors came to the Court, and Hamlet ordered them to perform a certain play before the King and Queen.  Now, this play was the story of a man who had been murdered in his garden by a near relation, who afterwards married the dead man's wife.\\n\\nYou may imagine the feelings of the wicked King, as he sat on his throne, with the Queen beside him and all his Court around, and saw, acted on the stage, the very wickedness that he had himself done.  And when, in the play, the wicked relation poured poison into the ear of the sleeping man, the wicked Claudius suddenly rose, and staggered from the room--the Queen and others following.\\n\\nThen said Hamlet to his friends--\\n\\n\\\"Now I am sure the ghost spoke true.  For if Claudius had not done this murder, he could not have been so distressed to see it in a play.\\\"\\n\\nNow the Queen sent for Hamlet, by the King's desire, to scold him for his conduct during the play, and for other matters; and Claudius, wishing to know exactly what happened, told old Polonius to hide himself behind the hangings in the Queen's room.  And as they talked, the Queen got frightened at Hamlet's rough, strange words, and cried for help, and Polonius behind the curtain cried out too.  Hamlet, thinking it was the King who was hidden there, thrust with his sword at the hangings, and killed, not the King, but poor old Polonius.\\n\\nSo now Hamlet had offended his uncle and his mother, and by bad hap killed his true love's father.\\n\\n\\\"Oh! what a rash and bloody deed is this,\\\" cried the Queen.\\n\\nAnd Hamlet answered bitterly, \\\"Almost as bad as to kill a king, and marry his brother.\\\"  Then Hamlet told the Queen plainly all his thoughts and how he knew of the murder, and begged her, at least, to have no more friendship or kindness of the base Claudius, who had killed the good King.  And as they spoke the King's ghost again appeared before Hamlet, but the Queen could not see it.  So when the ghost had gone, they parted.\\n\\nWhen the Queen told Claudius what had passed, and how Polonius was dead, he said, \\\"This shows plainly that Hamlet is mad, and since he has killed the Chancellor, it is for his own safety that we must carry out our plan, and send him away to England.\\\"\\n\\nSo Hamlet was sent, under charge of two courtiers who served the King, and these bore letters to the English Court, requiring that Hamlet should be put to death.  But Hamlet had the good sense to get at these letters, and put in others instead, with the names of the two courtiers who were so ready to betray him.  Then, as the vessel went to England, Hamlet escaped on board a pirate ship, and the two wicked courtiers left him to his fate, and went on to meet theirs.\\n\\nHamlet hurried home, but in the meantime a dreadful thing had happened.  Poor pretty Ophelia, having lost her lover and her father, lost her wits too, and went in sad madness about the Court, with straws, and weeds, and flowers in her hair, singing strange scraps of songs, and talking poor, foolish, pretty talk with no heart of meaning to it.  And one day, coming to a stream where willows grew, she tried to bang a flowery garland on a willow, and fell into the water with all her flowers, and so died.\\n\\nAnd Hamlet had loved her, though his plan of seeming madness had made him hide it; and when he came back, he found the King and Queen, and the Court, weeping at the funeral of his dear love and lady.\\n\\nOphelia's brother, Laertes, had also just come to Court to ask justice for the death of his father, old Polonius; and now, wild with grief, he leaped into his sister's grave, to clasp her in his arms once more.\\n\\n\\\"I loved her more than forty thousand brothers,\\\" cried Hamlet, and leapt into the grave after him, and they fought till they were parted.\\n\\nAfterwards Hamlet begged Laertes to forgive him.\\n\\n\\\"I could not bear,\\\" he said, \\\"that any, even a brother, should seem to love her more than I.\\\"\\n\\nBut the wicked Claudius would not let them be friends.  He told Laertes how Hamlet had killed old Polonius, and between them they made a plot to slay Hamlet by treachery.\\n\\nLaertes challenged him to a fencing match, and all the Court were present.  Hamlet had the blunt foil always used in fencing, but Laertes had prepared for himself a sword, sharp, and tipped with poison.  And the wicked King had made ready a bowl of poisoned wine, which he meant to give poor Hamlet when he should grow warm with the sword play, and should call for drink.\\n\\nSo Laertes and Hamlet fought, and Laertes, after some fencing, gave Hamlet a sharp sword thrust.  Hamlet, angry at this treachery--for they had been fencing, not as men fight, but as they play--closed with Laertes in a struggle; both dropped their swords, and when they picked them up again, Hamlet, without noticing it, had exchanged his own blunt sword for Laertes' sharp and poisoned one. And with one thrust of it he pierced Laertes, who fell dead by his own treachery.\\n\\nAt this moment the Queen cried out, \\\"The drink, the drink!  Oh, my dear Hamlet!  I am poisoned!\\\"\\n\\nShe had drunk of the poisoned bowl the King had prepared for Hamlet, and the King saw the Queen, whom, wicked as he was, he really loved, fall dead by his means.\\n\\nThen Ophelia being dead, and Polonius, and the Queen, and Laertes, and the two courtiers who had been sent to England, Hamlet at last found courage to do the ghost's bidding and avenge his father's murder--which, if he had braced up his heart to do long before, all these lives had been spared, and none had suffered but the wicked King, who well deserved to die.\\n\\nHamlet, his heart at last being great enough to do the deed he ought, turned the poisoned sword on the false King.\\n\\n\\\"Then--venom--do thy work!\\\" he cried, and the King died.\\n\\nSo Hamlet in the end kept the promise he had made his father.  And all being now accomplished, he himself died.  And those who stood by saw him die, with prayers and tears, for his friends and his people loved him with their whole hearts.  Thus ends the tragic tale of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark.\\n\\nCYMBELINE\\n\\nCymbeline was the King of Britain.  He had three children.  The two sons were stolen away from him when they were quite little children, and he was left with only one daughter, Imogen.  The King married a second time, and brought up Leonatus, the son of a dear friend, as Imogen's playfellow; and when Leonatus was old enough, Imogen secretly married him.  This made the King and Queen very angry, and the King, to punish Leonatus, banished him from Britain.\\n\\nPoor Imogen was nearly heart-broken at parting from Leonatus, and he was not less unhappy.  For they were not only lovers and husband and wife, but they had been friends and comrades ever since they were quite little children.  With many tears and kisses they said \\\"Good-bye.\\\"  They promised never to forget each other, and that they would never care for anyone else as long as they lived.\\n\\n\\\"This diamond was my mother's, love,\\\" said Imogen; \\\"take it, my heart, and keep it as long as you love me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sweetest, fairest,\\\" answered Leonatus, \\\"wear this bracelet for my sake.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah!\\\" cried Imogen, weeping, \\\"when shall we meet again?\\\"\\n\\nAnd while they were still in each other's arms, the King came in, and Leonatus had to leave without more farewell.\\n\\nWhen he was come to Rome, where he had gone to stay with an old friend of his father's, he spent his days still in thinking of his dear Imogen, and his nights in dreaming of her.  One day at a feast some Italian and French noblemen were talking of their sweethearts, and swearing that they were the most faithful and honorable and beautiful ladies in the world.  And a Frenchman reminded Leonatus how he had said many times that his wife Imogen was more fair, wise, and constant than any of the ladies in France.\\n\\n\\\"I say so still,\\\" said Leonatus.\\n\\n\\\"She is not so good but that she would deceive,\\\" said Iachimo, one of the Italian nobles.\\n\\n\\\"She never would deceive,\\\" said Leonatus.\\n\\n\\\"I wager,\\\" said Iachimo, \\\"that, if I go to Britain, I can persuade your wife to do whatever I wish, even if it should be against your wishes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That you will never do,\\\" said Leonatus.  \\\"I wager this ring upon my finger,\\\" which was the very ring Imogen had given him at parting, \\\"that my wife will keep all her vows to me, and that you will never persuade her to do otherwise.\\\"\\n\\nSo Iachimo wagered half his estate against the ring on Leonatus's finger, and started forthwith for Britain, with a letter of introduction to Leonatus's wife.  When he reached there he was received with all kindness; but he was still determined to win his wager.\\n\\nHe told Imogen that her husband thought no more of her, and went on to tell many cruel lies about him.  Imogen listened at first, but presently perceived what a wicked person Iachimo was, and ordered him to leave her.  Then he said--\\n\\n\\\"Pardon me, fair lady, all that I have said is untrue.  I only told you this to see whether you would believe me, or whether you were as much to be trusted as your husband thinks.  Will you forgive me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I forgive you freely,\\\" said Imogen.\\n\\n\\\"Then,\\\" went on Iachimo, \\\"perhaps you will prove it by taking charge of a trunk, containing a number of jewels which your husband and I and some other gentlemen have bought as a present for the Emperor of Rome.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will indeed,\\\" said Imogen, \\\"do anything for my husband and a friend of my husband's.  Have the jewels sent into my room, and I will take care of them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is only for one night,\\\" said Iachimo, \\\"for I leave Britain again to-morrow.\\\"\\n\\nSo the trunk was carried into Imogen's room, and that night she went to bed and to sleep.  When she was fast asleep, the lid of the trunk opened and a man got out.  It was Iachimo.  The story about the jewels was as untrue as the rest of the things he had said.  He had only wished to get into her room to win his wicked wager.  He looked about him and noticed the furniture, and then crept to the side of the bed where Imogen was asleep and took from her arm the gold bracelet which had been the parting gift of her husband.  Then he crept back to the trunk, and next morning sailed for Rome.\\n\\nWhen he met Leonatus, he said--\\n\\n\\\"I have been to Britain and I have won the wager, for your wife no longer thinks about you.  She stayed talking with me all one night in her room, which is hung with tapestry and has a carved chimney-piece, and silver andirons in the shape of two winking Cupids.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do not believe she has forgotten me; I do not believe she stayed talking with you in her room.  You have heard her room described by the servants.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah!\\\" said Iachimo, \\\"but she gave me this bracelet.  She took it from her arm.  I see her yet.  Her pretty action did outsell her gift, and yet enriched it too.  She gave it me, and said she prized it once.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Take the ring,\\\" cried Leonatus, \\\"you have won; and you might have won my life as well, for I care nothing for it now I know my lady has forgotten me.\\\"\\n\\nAnd mad with anger, he wrote letters to Britain to his old servant, Pisanio, ordering him to take Imogen to Milford Haven, and to murder her, because she had forgotten him and given away his gift. At the same time he wrote to Imogen herself, telling her to go with Pisanio, his old servant, to Milford Haven, and that he, her husband, would be there to meet her.\\n\\nNow when Pisanio got this letter he was too good to carry out its orders, and too wise to let them alone altogether.  So he gave Imogen the letter from her husband, and started with her for Milford Haven.  Before he left, the wicked Queen gave him a drink which, she said, would be useful in sickness.  She hoped he would give it to Imogen, and that Imogen would die, and the wicked Queen's son could be King.  For the Queen thought this drink was a poison, but really and truly it was only a sleeping-draft.\\n\\nWhen Pisanio and Imogen came near to Milford Haven, he told her what was really in the letter he had had from her husband.\\n\\n\\\"I must go on to Rome, and see him myself,\\\" said Imogen.\\n\\nAnd then Pisanio helped her to dress in boy's clothes, and sent her on her way, and went back to the Court.  Before he went he gave her the drink he had had from the Queen.\\n\\nImogen went on, getting more and more tired, and at last came to a cave.  Someone seemed to live there, but no one was in just then.  So she went in, and as she was almost dying of hunger, she took some food she saw there, and had just done so, when an old man and two boys came into the cave.  She was very much frightened when she saw them, for she thought that they would be angry with her for taking their food, though she had meant to leave money for it on the table.  But to her surprise they welcomed her kindly. She looked very pretty in her boy's clothes and her face was good, as well as pretty.\\n\\n\\\"You shall be our brother,\\\" said both the boys; and so she stayed with them, and helped to cook the food, and make things comfortable. But one day when the old man, whose name was Bellarius, was out hunting with the two boys, Imogen felt ill, and thought she would try the medicine Pisanio had given her.  So she took it, and at once became like a dead creature, so that when Bellarius and the boys came back from hunting, they thought she was dead, and with many tears and funeral songs, they carried her away and laid her in the wood, covered with flowers.\\n\\nThey sang sweet songs to her, and strewed flowers on her, pale primroses, and the azure harebell, and eglantine, and furred moss, and went away sorrowful.  No sooner had they gone than Imogen awoke, and not knowing how she came there, nor where she was, went wandering through the wood.\\n\\nNow while Imogen had been living in the cave, the Romans had decided to attack Britain, and their army had come over, and with them Leonatus, who had grown sorry for his wickedness against Imogen, so had come back, not to fight with the Romans against Britain, but with the Britons against Rome.  So as Imogen wandered alone, she met with Lucius, the Roman General, and took service with him as his page.\\n\\nWhen the battle was fought between the Romans and Britons, Bellarius and his two boys fought for their own country, and Leonatus, disguised as a British peasant, fought beside them.  The Romans had taken Cymbeline prisoner, and old Bellarius, with his sons and Leonatus, bravely rescued the King.  Then the Britons won the battle, and among the prisoners brought before the King were Lucius, with Imogen, Iachimo, and Leonatus, who had put on the uniform of a Roman soldier.  He was tired of his life since he had cruelly ordered his wife to be killed, and he hoped that, as a Roman soldier, he would be put to death.\\n\\nWhen they were brought before the King, Lucius spoke out--\\n\\n\\\"A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer,\\\" he said.  \\\"If I must die, so be it.  This one thing only will I entreat.  My boy, a Briton born, let him be ransomed.  Never master had a page so kind, so duteous, diligent, true.  He has done no Briton harm, though he has served a Roman.  Save him, Sir.\\\"\\n\\nThen Cymbeline looked on the page, who was his own daughter, Imogen, in disguise, and though he did not recognize her, he felt such a kindness that he not only spared the boy's life, but he said--\\n\\n\\\"He shall have any boon he likes to ask of me, even though he ask a prisoner, the noblest taken.\\\"\\n\\nThen Imogen said, \\\"The boon I ask is that this gentleman shall say from whom he got the ring he has on his finger,\\\" and she pointed to Iachimo.\\n\\n\\\"Speak,\\\" said Cymbeline, \\\"how did you get that diamond?\\\"\\n\\nThen Iachimo told the whole truth of his villainy.  At this, Leonatus was unable to contain himself, and casting aside all thought of disguise, he came forward, cursing himself for his folly in having believed Iachimo's lying story, and calling again and again on his wife whom he believed dead.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Imogen, my love, my life!\\\" he cried.  \\\"Oh, Imogen!\\n\\n\\\"Then Imogen, forgetting she was disguised, cried out, \\\"Peace, my lord--here, here!\\\"\\n\\nLeonatus turned to strike the forward page who thus interfered in his great trouble, and then he saw that it was his wife, Imogen, and they fell into each other's arms.\\n\\nThe King was so glad to see his dear daughter again, and so grateful to the man who had rescued him (whom he now found to be Leonatus), that he gave his blessing on their marriage, and then he turned to Bellarius, and the two boys.  Now Bellarius spoke--\\n\\n\\\"I am your old servant, Bellarius.  You accused me of treason when I had only been loyal to you, and to be doubted, made me disloyal. So I stole your two sons, and see,--they are here!\\\"  And he brought forward the two boys, who had sworn to be brothers to Imogen when they thought she was a boy like themselves.\\n\\nThe wicked Queen was dead of some of her own poisons, and the King, with his three children about him, lived to a happy old age.\\n\\nSo the wicked were punished, and the good and true lived happy ever after.  So may the wicked suffer, and honest folk prosper till the world's end.\\n\\nMACBETH\\n\\nWhen a person is asked to tell the story of Macbeth, he can tell two stories.  One is of a man called Macbeth who came to the throne of Scotland by a crime in the year of our Lord 1039, and reigned justly and well, on the whole, for fifteen years or more.  This story is part of Scottish history.  The other story issues from a place called Imagination; it is gloomy and wonderful, and you shall hear it.\\n\\nA year or two before Edward the Confessor began to rule England, a battle was won in Scotland against a Norwegian King by two generals named Macbeth and Banquo.  After the battle, the generals walked together towards Forres, in Elginshire, where Duncan, King of Scotland, was awaiting them.\\n\\nWhile they were crossing a lonely heath, they saw three bearded women, sisters, hand in hand, withered in appearance and wild in their attire.\\n\\n\\\"Speak, who are you?\\\" demanded Macbeth.\\n\\n\\\"Hail, Macbeth, chieftain of Glamis,\\\" said the first woman.\\n\\n\\\"Hail, Macbeth, chieftain of Cawdor,\\\" said the second woman.\",\"timestamp\":1640141341,\"title\":\"I was told you were well-nigh dead for me,\\\" remarked Beatrice.\"},\"digest\":\"4wbsx_5r4_M8bls-ez8ygQFk1C-qp_dzxDUF7TPVNMU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x336f98da5BDeF1692C4dE51f67eafA44062a418E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NjBecMchHZbrt9v_-2YKpD3KOGdGIbvEjklMuqQvkVY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AOT5ZYdm5-IjTvKM4E8zcCe-7NxzrkbIvmbYbbU9jSw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"n8gJxsD7zEXG-xCLLwDawX9e00O4fF5rNJC5pZhkVPlED7IepsOzs7jlgHL5ODkS99jpTlO7-RJByrMaj9LGgw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xeaff258f017ddfecd8ed83cc1b53e89063a8de78e0f4e6d5b3c5d0d4d1c9201f4ba6676b3476db9d2e9ef868a1dda76730d8bec9c9f785d412bcfd6fc13dc9c31b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NjBecMchHZbrt9v_-2YKpD3KOGdGIbvEjklMuqQvkVY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AOT5ZYdm5-IjTvKM4E8zcCe-7NxzrkbIvmbYbbU9jSw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"4wbsx_5r4_M8bls-ez8ygQFk1C-qp_dzxDUF7TPVNMU\"}"
