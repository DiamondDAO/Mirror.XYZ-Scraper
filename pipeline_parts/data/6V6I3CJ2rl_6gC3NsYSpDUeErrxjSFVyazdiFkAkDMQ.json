"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"My journey into the Web3 space has so far reminded me of beginning a meditation practice.\\n\\nYou find a comfortable seated position, close your eyes, and try to focus on the sensations of breathing. Inhale, exhale. Inha.... Random thoughts carry your attention away from the breath, and you've forgotten why you're sitting on a cushion with your eyes closed. After some time you remember, \\\"oh yes! I'm meditating.\\\" The practice of focusing on the breath begins again.\\n\\nI feel like I'm in that beginner's meditation phase now with learning about Web3. I sit down to learn about how artists can build a royalty structure into their NFT's smart contract, and the next thing I know I'm in seven new discord channels aimlessly clicking around.\\n\\nI set my intention to research DAO governance tools and the next thing I know I'm looking at all the Cryptopunks in the [FlamingoDAO NFT collection](https://flamingodao.xyz/collection).\\n\\nI sit down to learn about [queries on Dune Analytics](https://docs.dune.xyz/#queries) and find myself pouring over a dashboard about [top traders on OpenSea](https://dune.xyz/bitereum/Opensea-Top-Traders).\\n\\nI'm still learning to set more specific intentions and recognize when my attention drifts from my intention. Everything in Web3 is so cool, new, and exciting it's hard to discipline my curious nature. And maybe it's okay to let curiosity run wild sometimes and explore. I think we all need to find the right balance for us. I wrote a few nuggets of self discipline to help me on my journey:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/jasonpetersorg/status/1465120294104809474](https://twitter.com/jasonpetersorg/status/1465120294104809474)\\n\\nI'm a natural explorer and endlessly curious. I'm working on learning to discipline myself towards creation and contribution, and pursuing excellence in a list of skills.\\n\\nI'm  getting better at recognizing when I'm deep inside an unintended rabbit hole. I take a breath and remember my mantra; \\\"love, confidence, you got this.\\\" Then I redirect my attention and continue on.\",\"timestamp\":1638151897,\"title\":\"Self-Discipline Nuggets\"},\"digest\":\"QqiwZTeuKA7nD3LpsfUfeoaHjBMuXxTk4te7RAeetqs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9132ADb3603fA7A2A795cE55e5d1093A9805B2da\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"gpgM0RYbr45bMXmVez2PL5RLM0K2oguKyxnRx0-voqM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"u03WW-OZva8jI2zgW-Desni16lfKxXIuJlnGYPQthuo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"o8Mi740IDPeAEIJVjaXNLjLoXXf8kiAT71tvoMYZu8lghlYogaCNjGPVNeuUscVTMTVcobTEEIr80KCC0A4Qpg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x748c7425f07deea636d658e6b7a9d1ff0c366cfeeb847f06a62d353af92dc74059de62bd3b1fa9509d0df5bf5f19c8458eace94d2ab1bdfb324be8a55e0a8a561b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"gpgM0RYbr45bMXmVez2PL5RLM0K2oguKyxnRx0-voqM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"u03WW-OZva8jI2zgW-Desni16lfKxXIuJlnGYPQthuo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"QqiwZTeuKA7nD3LpsfUfeoaHjBMuXxTk4te7RAeetqs\"}"
