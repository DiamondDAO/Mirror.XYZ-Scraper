"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"From 2011 to 2014, I was crazy about photography. I used to go out every weekend\\nto shoot photographs. Practicing the art form taught me how to see the world, gave\\nme a sense of calm, and offered me a chance to meet several amazing artists. \\n \\nPeople loved my work and encouraged me to do more. And, then it started. A lot of\\nmy friends/well-wishers started telling me to take up commercial assignments\\nespecially wedding photography as it was the trend back then. Even though I was a\\nbit skeptical, I thought \\\"If so many people think I should do it, I should do it.\\\" \\n \\nSo, without any prior experience in photographing at weddings, or running a\\nbusiness, I decided to venture into wedding photography. Three months into the\\ngig, I bombed. My pictures weren't great and I was sloppy at running the business\\nside of things. Result? Prospects took their business to those who were actually\\ngood at it. \\n \\nAlso, I hated working on the assignments I had at hand. I didn't enjoy it as much as\\nwhen I was doing it as a hobby. Soon, I shut shop. And, for some reason, I couldn't\\ndo photography after that. Maybe turning it into a business left a bad taste in me.\\nOr, I genuinely moved on to different things like writing and tech. I couldn't tell. \\n \\nBut, a question I often ask myself is \\\"Would I still be photographing if I hadn't turned\\nmy passion into a business?\\\" I don't have an answer. \\n \\nBut, one lesson I learned from the experience is don't turn something you love into a\\nbusiness just because people around you want you to. Do it only if you want to. I\\nknow it can be tempting when everyone on social media is writing success stories\\nabout how they monetized their passion. \\n \\nWhen you sell your art, you aren't just making and selling art. You're responsible for\\na hundred other things. And, it may suck the happiness out of you if you're running\\nit as a single person (running it as a company is a different story). \\n \\nSo, it is okay if you don't turn your hobby/passion into a business. Continue doing it\\nfor your pleasure. Nobody is going to judge you for it.\",\"timestamp\":1637797180,\"title\":\"#16 Don't Sell Art Due to Peer\\nPressure\"},\"digest\":\"1fWSniLrldxJL3zQ2r5RMfcU-I-j4RY3q6Xa0aIx6pA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5F882566e4B071Ec1565Ed633EDBFB5c902dCA74\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8_uGVGdfFjLSJWYd0zMXytofzonHacRrnRv2eKJFt2Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_ZD7ifRsXTRvXXBU3V2IkPZAMDhECIUxIelNusRyYms\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"JmvYcvlBaslaFNz7e4Q-r8cexk7UhjF1Jrk13lrLEeu6uWkh-3wzBzmoHi1CJmXUTdTA35gBhiqpK_DJtEdddw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5dad564490ee162511d60b533a5ad5d7949efface30fb34d4338a146b02755d9025af55c5b65bcd4dbc7213a59304f21b2e17848f3ef96f5b0b359f3399243151c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8_uGVGdfFjLSJWYd0zMXytofzonHacRrnRv2eKJFt2Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_ZD7ifRsXTRvXXBU3V2IkPZAMDhECIUxIelNusRyYms\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"1fWSniLrldxJL3zQ2r5RMfcU-I-j4RY3q6Xa0aIx6pA\"}"
