"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"We are seeing big discounts on V2 bonds right now, so in the spirit of 3,3 I figured I would write a very quick how to on how to bond as this is good for both the protocol and 3,3 ohmies.\\n\\nOne thing to understand about Olympus V2 bonds is that the OHM you receive as a reward for bonding is already staked. Assuming that an ohmie would stay 3,3 no matter what, it means that **anytime the discount on a V2 bond is over 0%** (in reality we would need to account for the gas fee, especially for smaller bonds) **the optimal move is to always sell some of his OHM for the bonded asset and bond to increase his OHM stack**. \\n\\n## How to bond: \\n\\n* Go to  https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/bonds\\n* Check if there is any discount over 0%, this is what it currently looks like as I’m writing this: \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/As5aMwu_B1lhaMXfFCpeC.png?height=208&width=232)\\n\\nThis OHM-ETH discount is no joke ! Assuming that your plan is to stay 3,3 anyway, it means that you can increase your staked OHM stack by 5% instantly without risk …\\n\\n* Click on the bond you’re interested in: \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0_YVRm27_M7Sil1Zba00k.png?height=596&width=824)\\n\\n* Note the max that you can buy, which is here is 1332.85 sOHM. Unstake this amount or less at https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/stake\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3HudmHzsEAn8VqOSly_in.png?height=336&width=797)\\n\\n* If the bond is an LP bond, sell half of the OHM for the counterparty asset and create the LP position. For example for OHM-ETH bonds, you can LP it here with half OHM half wETH: https://[app.sushi.com/add/0x64aa3364F17a4D01c6f1751Fd97C2BD3D7e7f1D5/0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2](http://app.sushi.com/add/0x64aa3364F17a4D01c6f1751Fd97C2BD3D7e7f1D5/0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2)\\n\\n![Example of LPing for the OHM-ETH bond.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ioLy7RIExRu2z-rHDZgKz.png?height=677&width=702)\\n\\n* If it’s a simple treasury bond, just sell all the unstaked OHM for the asset.\\n* Go back to the bond page (https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/bonds) and bond the asset (LP/asset) to get your risk-free staked OHM. If all went well, you just got more OHM for a bit of GAS. Pay attention to the vesting term of the bond as you will be locked in that position for the duration, but **if you planned to stay 3,3 no matter what it’s essentially a risk-free way to increase your stack !** (Don’t forget to account for gas if you’re doing this with small bonds, Ethereum isn’t cheap these days)\\n\\nHope this small article was useful and can help reduce information asymetry to put more OHM in the hands of long term ohmies and more assets in the treasury, according to the spirit of (3,3) ! \",\"timestamp\":1642522565,\"title\":\"A risk free way to get more OHM for 3,3 ohmies\"},\"digest\":\"lOtQvC-TJPt1YMMXYgVgPQyL86ZInqPpVyyw6eJnbUk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xb018538e965c088550cA342BaC0d2F6c4731fb54\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LzccPFTS8eGMO2LDYUlxwNFIG3J1D2u9oc1iBhQmzUk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FKBWifkxxbvsGI2fwKNr4Kk4BLDd6wLNNNFb29UmYBk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"t1Q3nzaJz8qgg4fgrEgbWG7xTmFH3kgZg3GcITbTRD3mcGF5lUYor-yzETDT8WhfEoP3mcPFuiqCFJQTS9XVPA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x90e0832db66b86f1fb6274a2132202895f4a99059b72f7b25164d5602ec28d9122f5cb144b87ae80d41ac0145c8151bd59a3821c1101aec57da110ba0b6615911b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LzccPFTS8eGMO2LDYUlxwNFIG3J1D2u9oc1iBhQmzUk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FKBWifkxxbvsGI2fwKNr4Kk4BLDd6wLNNNFb29UmYBk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"lOtQvC-TJPt1YMMXYgVgPQyL86ZInqPpVyyw6eJnbUk\"}"
