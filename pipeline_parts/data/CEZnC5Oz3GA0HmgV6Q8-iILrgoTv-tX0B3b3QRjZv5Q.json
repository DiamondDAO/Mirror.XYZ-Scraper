"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning is a very popular subject within the world. When we think of the Terminator, designed by Skynet to destroy people's resistance, these concepts that seem a long way of have already jumped in every corner of our lives.\\n\\nAlthough the birth of Artificial Intelligence is much earlier, its adaptation to real life began with John McCarthy's –R.I.P.- belief; necessity of products’ interaction with people. Therefore, he has developed the software language Lisp (List Processing), which is based on the lambda calculation system and it has become the only language which has been used in artificial intelligence products after 1959.\\n\\nOne of the most important reasons for the rapid spread of Artificial Intelligence, which’s usage in daily life is increasing day by day, is to reduce costs as it eliminates human factor. Researchers estimate that this change is 10 times faster than the first industrial revolution and its affect is 3,000 times more. Imagine an employee that you can run uninsured with close to zero fault, without boredom, without a whim 24/7.\\n\\nA frequently debated issue about artificial intelligence’s fluctuations to our lives is the question if this technology can replace the human beings’ professional occupation in the future. Can we handle with a technology such as artificial intelligence, that’s superior to the human brain in many ways? According to the December 2017 report of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), unemployment rates in OECD countries is 5.5%, compared to the Eurozone as 8.7%. With this respect, it is logic to say that such a concern is not groundless.\\n\\nIn an article on Theconversation.com entitled “We should learn to work with them rather than having fear of the possibility of robots’ taking over our occupation”, this concern is attributed to the destructive technologies that emerged during the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries. So technology has actually posed a similar threat to humanity for centuries.\\n\\nCan robots really steal our jobs? It is not possible to give a positive or negative answer to this question. Research on this issue also gives contradictory results. According to the data shared in the article on Theconversation.com, a forecast suggests that one billion jobs will be transferred to robots by 2022, while research and consulting firm Gartner estimates that 1.8 million jobs will be lost by 2020. However, according to the data, this job loss will be compensated by the need for new jobs of 2.3 million. In other words, while artificial intelligence technology takes our business from us, it will also create new business lines for us to work with. Is that possible? In the 1980s, with computers taking place at the desks, humanity felt a similar threat to today. However, it is another fact that computers have created many new business lines such as programming, digital content production and web design for humanity today.\\n\\nAutomation in Europe has increased in the scientific, administrative and technical sectors over the past decade, but on the other hand it has caused major job losses in construction and agriculture. In routine jobs where robots can be much more efficient, the risk of losing their jobs will be at the highest level. On the other hand, robots cannot replace people in jobs that require creativity, expertise and ability to manage. People with such jobs, technical and social qualifications, will be able to enter new job opportunities in health and technology and new jobs that will not be available today but will be created between 8% and 9% by 2030.\\n\\nSo which robots can take over the jobs, which ones can't? The answers to this question also vary, but the general opinion is that artificial intelligence will be positioned as an extension to support humanity rather than to replace it in the labor force. For example, it is thought that doctors can work more qualified with the help of artificial intelligence. According to Theconversation.com's article “How Doctors Use Technology in Diagnosis?” AI can demonstrate more success than “human doctors” in saving lives. The first event that supported this was in Japan; Artificial Intelligence has diagnosed very rare form of leukemia to a woman. Artificial intelligence scanned 20 million clinical oncology studies just in 10 minutes, matched the woman's medical data, and saved her life. Nevertheless, the article states that it is difficult for artificial intelligence to replace doctors. The fact that the program fails in artificial intelligence, cyber-attacks, and the “excess verbatim” of the technology makes it necessary for a person to be involved in the process. In addition, the fact that people prefer to share their health problems with a living human doctor rather than a hologram restricts the robots' place in the health sector.\\n\\nResearches about artificial intelligence mention that it will take over the jobs which especially people do not want to do; such as dirty, boring or dangerous jobs. It is possible to transfer jobs based on repetition in factories, but requiring intelligence from people to robots. An example of this is the manual welding, which is a health hazard due to the high level of toxic gas it emits. On the other hand, for economic, social and traditional reasons, it is thought that some jobs will always remain in the hands of people.\\n\\n“Robots are coming - will they really take over all the work?” in Independent.co.uk, and the views of PwC's Chief Economist John Hawkswort: Robots will take over manual, routine tasks with programming capability; he says that jobs that require human touch, such as health and education, will be less affected. In the same article, the ideas of Michael Barber, CMRubinWorld writer and former consultant of Tony Blair are also shared. Barber says, parts of the work will be shared with them, rather than which robots will take over. Underlining that the wonderful teachers supported by an advanced artificial intelligence can change the education system from scratch, Barber emphasizes that there will be no choice between humanity and machine, but rather a partnership.\\n\\nAlthough artificial intelligence is widely used in many sectors today, efforts are being made to severely limit the effectiveness of guns. Researchers working in the field of robotics and AI in Australia and Canada wrote an open letter to the prime ministers of their countries and called for the avoidance of artificial intelligence. As a reason for this, researchers pointed out the danger that autonomous weapons without intervention, can hit and destroy any target without a proper evaluation. In addition, the letter stated that a global race could start with the start of arming with artificial intelligence. The letter emphasized the benefits of artificial intelligence to humanity and called for the exclusion of the military from this technology.\\n\\nIn other words, the “human touch”, which is the number one trump of humanity against artificial intelligence, either can help us keep our job or may cause us to lose it. The impact of this technology on our professional lives is just predictions for now. However, you can question the possibility of losing your job to robots at willrobotstakemyjob.com. On the site, millions of jobs are transferred to robots in the future, percentages and explanations are given. For example, on the website, we see the taxi drivers have an 89% risk of losing their jobs in the future, while computer programmers have 4%. Nevertheless, it is better to remember that these data are only predictions. We will only be able to learn how far artificial intelligence will progress by experience.\\n\\nFor now, scientists can only predict what the future of this technology will be. A common argument for the questions put forward by famous physicist Stephen Hawking in his speech at the Artificial Intelligence Research Center at Cambridge University: “In short, the rise of powerful AI will be either the best or the worst thing ever to happen to humanity.” We don't know which one will happen.\",\"timestamp\":1639398480,\"title\":\"Anxiety of Unemployed Robots\"},\"digest\":\"_l1-JbqDrkfPlgC6-H2I8JleJWLzkQJi9nzQzrL0F50\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD81EEb2CE87daa77180dD722e1583C6795eE098C\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fw7tEv6KgwsvrhLyFf7BkFA1cKKF4xhBxVthCXw1VPw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"o0mFCKGB2qBMq-d20nMUnjVtfNZrd8QIBiWaEvNYjvA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"dlYLbxaXcYFYw8ONwyQO__7gc0nnVL2OKiOlNM7PkP2-Sb9CgFdL6DYf6n-Y_25rDqyKbwtmbPmb5FEsC9-HXg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xced6b9bc846c66ee4b764b431f9b3fd83ba9e072ee7c7d8df4a6e17271e0fb3c29b83e0afa3ee883ba120bfe110905866726f28d59e212db5f5aaf533dc585bf1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fw7tEv6KgwsvrhLyFf7BkFA1cKKF4xhBxVthCXw1VPw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"o0mFCKGB2qBMq-d20nMUnjVtfNZrd8QIBiWaEvNYjvA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"_l1-JbqDrkfPlgC6-H2I8JleJWLzkQJi9nzQzrL0F50\"}"
