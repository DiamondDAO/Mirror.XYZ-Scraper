"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Although it seems somewhat impossible, the calendar suggests we‚Äôre already past the halfway point of SC03. It feels like just yesterday we had a bunch of baby ideas crawl into our discord, and we‚Äôre so proud of the projects they‚Äôre becoming üò≠. Not really true, many were already off to the races, but you get the sentiment.\\n\\nWe‚Äôre lucky to have the support of some of the biggest brains in web3, and even luckier that they‚Äôre willing to spend time sharing their knowledge and experience with our projects. We‚Äôve already had group sessions with Trevor McFedries, Cooper Turley, Denis Nazarov, Reuben Bramanathan, Alex Zhang, and more focused coaching sessions with many others.\\n\\nWe‚Äôre actively working on finding the right way to record and distribute all the knowledge that‚Äôs shared in these sessions with our broad community without hurting the intimacy of them, but aren‚Äôt quite there yet. So in the meantime here‚Äôs an overview of some of the big topics we‚Äôve discussed so far, followed by some project updates, and finishing with a hot alpha leak.\\n\\n**Proof of Community**\\n\\nMany of our projects are either early in their community building phases, or have large existing communities on web2 platforms, so advice on how to kickstart and grow web3 communities is something we frequently discuss.\\n\\nWe typically advise projects to start very small, find a core group of people who are value-aligned with the community they‚Äôre trying to build, and focus on engagement and having quality conversations. Trying to attract a big name, or bringing your entire web2 audience over is often counterproductive to this.\\n\\nTrevor McFedries perfectly conveyed how scrappy this stage can often be. He recommended to start by just finding ‚Äúsome group chat that you‚Äôre into and then find more people that are having those same conversations in different places and get everyone together.‚Äù\\n\\nJess suggests pitching your community through the narrative of a huge adventure that you‚Äôre embarking on, and to make it so compelling that people can‚Äôt ignore. If you get that right and are able to bring together a group of people who are really bought into that adventure, then you‚Äôll be in a great place to start figuring everything else out.\\n\\n**Community Building**\\n\\nOnce you have some semblance of community and a shared mission, your focus turns to building momentum towards a shorter term goal. Ideally you‚Äôre able to pull some early community members into this, but that often takes time so don‚Äôt be discouraged if your founding team is doing all the heavy lifting for a while.\\n\\nEven if community members aren‚Äôt stepping up it‚Äôs important to go out of your way to involve them. Alex Zhang told us that he was having individual conversations with 5 or 6 community members per day when he stepped in to lead FWB to gather input into the vision and roadmap. He dropped the gems that ‚Äúcommunity building is gardening not architecture‚Äù and that ‚Äúbeing a good leader in a DAO is like being a good dinner party host‚Äù which we fully agree with.\\n\\nIt‚Äôs this type of leadership that will earn trust, encourage community members to start contributing, and attract new members. It also helped Alex identify the people that had potential to move into core contributor/leadership roles.\\n\\nA week later Denis dropped arguably the bomb of the cohort so far when he told everyone to ‚Äúbuild for people to collectively lose their shit together‚Äù. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre talking about.\\n\\n**Path to Tokenization**\\n\\nWe‚Äôre a tokenized community accelerator so naturally if and when to launch a token is something we explore deeply with our projects. While this is very contextual to the product and vision you‚Äôre building towards, our speakers shared some helpful lenses to help us explore the question.\\n\\nThe first thing we make clear is that you don‚Äôt need a token to build a community, and introducing a token won‚Äôt make a stale community vibrant. Tokens are used for governance, shared ownership, and rewarding contributions. If there‚Äôs nothing valuable to govern or nobody wanting to contribute to the mission, tokens aren‚Äôt going to help.\\n\\nMany of our speakers have also recommended using NFTs as membership as a stepping stone to launching a fungible token. If you don‚Äôt immediately need to reward contributions, or have the need for flexible governance, this can be a great way to introduce ownership (and raise money) without having to jump into a token model.\\n\\nBut all of this being said, as Cooper explained there‚Äôs ‚Äúnever a right time to launch a token because you have no idea what you‚Äôre going to need until you actually do it‚Äù. So we always tell teams to just go. Jess frequently reminds everyone that as long as you operate with transparency and earn credibility from your community, you‚Äôll have the freedom to make adjustments to your token mechanics as your community and needs evolve.\\n\\nOnce you are ready to launch a token and planning a crowdfund or airdrop it‚Äôs important to take a step back and remember why you‚Äôre doing this. Alex told everyone to ‚Äúget your token in the hands of people who are value aligned with what your building, aren‚Äôt price speculative at all, and will ride or die with the community‚Äù.\\n\\n**Maturing Your DAO**\\n\\nWe have a few projects that have already launched tokens and have communities really leaning in to contribute, so we‚Äôve been exposing them to a lot of advice about maturing their DAOs. This includes topics like treasury diversification, legal, hiring for consistent roles, generating on-chain revenue, collaborating with other DAOs, etc.\\n\\nDiscussing these is beyond the scope of this article, but here are some treats for you to chew on.\\n\\n‚ÄúOver-incentivize early contributions and make those people feel wanted and loved and let them really lean into the roles. The more they get to define the roles themselves the better.‚Äù - Cooper\\n\\n‚ÄúAs the leader of your DAO your fingerprints should be all over the project as well. If you‚Äôre too much of a researcher you‚Äôll get stuck in this middle ground where you can‚Äôt make the decisions.‚Äù - Alex\\n\\n‚ÄúWhen it became clear \\\\[that FWB was going to work\\\\] we took a few steps backwards to build the foundation and make sure it was built correctly. We wanted to weather proof it for a crypto winter because things change a lot when price go down.‚Äù - Trevor\\n\\n**Just Go**\\n\\nWhile all of this general advice can be helpful to give you the confidence to move, it‚Äôs the movement that will provide you with the answers. So much of the real progress is made in our office hours or intimate coaching sessions where we work directly with teams to clarify their next steps and then push them to take them. So if there‚Äôs one thing we want to leave you with, it‚Äôs to ‚Äújust fucking go‚Äù. Or maybe it should be ‚Äújoin SC04‚Äù.\\n\\n## SC03 Project Milestones\\n\\nIt‚Äôs only been 3 weeks but we‚Äôve been blown away by what these projects have been able to accomplish so far.
