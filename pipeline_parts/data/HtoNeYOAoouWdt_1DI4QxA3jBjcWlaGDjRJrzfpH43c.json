"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"To go to the devil-to go to the devil-to go to the devil with this girl is not a bad fate-not a bad fate- not a bad fate.\\\" When she returned he drank his glass of champagne. Then he mumbled: \\\" You must be cold. Let me put your cape around you better. It won't do to catch cold here, you know.\\\"\\n\\nShe made a sweet pretence of rendering herself to his care. \\\" Oh, thanks \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* I am not really cold \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* There that's better.\\\"\\n\\nOf course all his manipulation of the cloak had been a fervid caress, and although her acting up to this point had remained in the role of the splendid and fabulous virgin she now turned her liquid eyes to his with a look that expressed knowledge, triumph and delight. She was sure of her victory. And she said: \\\"Sweetheart \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* don't you think I am as nice as Marjory ?\\\" The impulse had been airily confident. It was as if the silken cords had been parted by the sweep of a sword. Coleman's face had instantly stiffened and he looked like a man suddenly recalled to the ways of light. It may easily have been that in a moment he would have lapsed again to his luxurious dreaming. But in his face the girl had read a fatal character to her blunder and her resentment against him took precedence of any other emotion. She wheeled abruptly from him and said with great contempt: \\\" Rufus, you had better go home. You're tired and sleepy, and more or less drunk.\\\"\\n\\nHe knew that the grand tumble of all their little embowered incident could be neither stayed or mended. \\\"Yes,\\\" he answered, sulkily, \\\"I think so too.\\\" They shook hands huffily and he went away.\\n\\nWhen he arrived among the students he found that they had appropriated everything of his which would conduce to their comfort. He was furious over it. But to his bitter speeches they replied in jibes.\\n\\n\\\"Rufus is himself again. Admire his angelic disposition. See him smile. Gentle soul.\\\"\\n\\nA sleepy voice said from a comer: \\\" I know what pinches him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" What ? \\\" asked several.\\n\\n\\\"He's been to see Nora and she flung him out bodily.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Yes?\\\" sneered Coleman. \\\"At times I seem to see in you, Coke, the fermentation of some primeval form of sensation, as if it were possible for you to de- velop a mind in two or three thousand years, and then at other times you appear \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* much as you are now.\\\"\\n\\nAs soon as they had well measured Coleman's temper all of the students save Coke kept their mouths tightly closed. Coke either did not understand or his mood was too vindictive for silence. \\\" Well, I know you got a throw-down all right,\\\" he muttered.\\n\\n\\\"And how would you know when I got a throw down? You pimply, milk-fed sophomore.\\\"\\n\\nThe others perked up their ears in mirthful appreciation of this language.\\n\\n\\\" Of course,\\\" continued Coleman, \\\" no one would protest against your continued existence, Coke, unless you insist on recalling yourself violently to people's attention in this way. The mere fact of your living would not usually be offensive to people if you weren't eternally turning a sort of calcium  light on your prehensile attributes.\\\" Coke was suddenly angry, angry much like a peasant, and his anger first evinced itself in a mere sputtering and spluttering. Finally he got out a rather long speech, full of grumbling noises, but he was understood by all to declare that his prehensile attributes had not led him to cart a notorious woman about the world with him. When they quickly looked at Coleman they saw that he was livid. \\\" You-\\\"\\n\\nBut, of course, there immediately arose all sorts of protesting cries from the seven non-combatants. Coleman, as he took two strides toward Coke's corner, looked fully able to break him across his knee, but for this Coke did not seem to care at all. He was on his feet with a challenge in his eye. Upon each cheek burned a sudden hectic spot. The others were clamouring, \\\"Oh, say, this won't do. Quit it. Oh, we mustn't have a fight. He didn't mean it, Coleman.\\\" Peter Tounley pressed Coke to the wall saying: \\\" You damned young jackass, be quiet.\\\"\\n\\nThey were in the midst of these. festivities when a door opened and disclosed the professor. He might. have been coming into the middle of a row in one of the corridors of the college at home only this time he carried a candle. His speech, however, was a Washurst speech : \\\" Gentlemen, gentlemen, what does this mean ? \\\" All seemed to expect Coleman to make the answer. He was suddenly very cool. \\\"Nothing, professor,\\\" he said, \\\" only that this-only that Coke has insulted me. I suppose that it was only the irresponsibility of a boy, and I beg that you will not trouble over it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Mr. Coke,\\\" said the professor, indignantly, \\\" what have you to say to this? \\\" Evidently he could not clearly see Coke, and he peered around his candle at where the virtuous Peter Tounley was expostulating with the young man. The figures of all the excited group moving in the candle light caused vast and uncouth shadows to have conflicts in the end of the room.\\n\\nPeter Tounley's task was not light, and beyond that he had the conviction that his struggle with Coke was making him also to appear as a rowdy. This conviction was proven to be true by a sudden thunder from the old professor, \\\" Mr. Tounley, desist ! \\\"\\n\\nIn wrath he desisted and Coke flung himself forward. He paid less attention to the professor than if the latter had been a jack-rabbit. \\\" You say I insulted you? he shouted crazily in Coleman's face.\\n\\n\\\"Well \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* I meant to, do you see ? \\\"\\n\\nColeman was glacial and lofty beyond everything. \\\"I am glad to have you admit the truth of what I have said.\\\"\\n\\nCoke was, still suffocating with his peasant rage, which would not allow him to meet the clear, calm  expressions of Coleman. \\\"Yes \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* I insulted you \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* I insulted you because what I said was correct \\\\* \\\\* my prehensile attributes  \\\\* \\\\* yes but I have never----\\\"\\n\\nHe was interrupted by a chorus from the other students.  \\\"Oh, no, that won't do. Don't say that. Don't repeat that, Coke.\\\"\\n\\nColeman remembered the weak bewilderment of the little professor in hours that had not long passed, and it was with something of an impersonal satisfac- tion that he said to himself: \\\" The old boy's got his war-paint on again.\\\" The professor had stepped sharply up to Coke and looked at him with eyes that seemed to throw out flame and heat. There was a moment's pause, and then the old scholar spoke, bit- ing his words as if they were each a short section of steel wire. \\\" Mr. Coke, your behaviour will end your college career abruptly and in gloom, I promise you. You have been drinking.\\\"\\n\\nCoke, his head simply floating in a sea of universal defiance, at once blurted out: \\\" Yes, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have been drinking?\\\" cried the professor, ferociously. \\\"Retire to your-retire to your----retire---\\\" And then in a voice of thunder he shouted:  \\\"Retire.\\\"\\n\\nWhereupon seven hoodlum students waited a decent moment, then shrieked with laughter. But the old professor would have none of their nonsense. He quelled them all with force and finish.\\n\\nColeman now spoke a few words.\\\" Professor, I can't tell you how sorry I am that I should be  concerned in any such riot as this, and since we are doomed to be bound so closely into each other's  society I offer myself without reservation as being  willing to repair the damage as well as may be, done. I don t see how I can forget at once that Coke's conduct was insolently unwarranted, but \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* if he has anything  to sayof a nature that might heal the breach I would be willing to to meet him in the openest manner.\\\" As he made these re- marks Coleman's dignity was something grand, and, Morever, there was now upon his face that curious look of temperance and purity which had been noted in New York as a singular physical characteristic. If he. was guilty of anything in this affair at all-in fact, if he had ever at any time been guilty of anything- no mark had come to stain that bloom of innocence. The professor nodded in the fullest appreciation and sympathy. \\\" Of course \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* really there is no other sleeping placeI suppose it would be better-\\\" Then he again attacked Coke. \\\"Young man, you have chosen an unfortunate moment to fill us with a suspicion that you may not be a gentleman.   For the time there is nothing to be done with you.\\\"  He addressed  the other students. \\\" There is nothing for me to do, young gentleman, but to leave Mr. Coke in your care. Good-night, sirs. Good-night, Coleman.\\\" He left the room with his candle.\\n\\nWhen Coke was bade to \\\" Retire \\\" he had, of course, simply retreated fuming to a corner of the room where he remained looking with yellow eyes like an animal from a cave. When the others were able to see through the haze of mental confusion they found that Coleman was with deliberation taking off his boots. \\\" Afterward, when he removed his waist-coat, he took great care to wind his large gold watch.\\n\\nThe students, much subdued, lay again in their places, and when there was any talking it was of an extremely local nature, referring principally to the floor As being unsuitable for beds and also referring from time to time to a real or an alleged selfishness on the part of some one of the recumbent men. Soon there was only the sound of heavy breathing.\\n\\nWhen the professor had returned to what he called the Wainwright part of the house he was greeted instantly with the question: \\\"What was it?\\\" His wife and daughter were up in alarm. \\\"What was it \\\" they repeated, wildly.\\n\\nHe was peevish. \\\" Oh, nothing, nothing. But that young Coke is a regular ruffian. He had gotten him. self into some tremendous uproar with Coleman. When I arrived he seemed actually trying to assault him. Revolting! He had been drinking. Coleman's behaviour, I must say, was splendid. Recognised at once the delicacy of my position-he not being a student. If I had found him in the wrong it would have been simpler than finding him in the right. Confound that rascal of a Coke.\\\" Then, as he began a partial disrobing, he treated them to grunted scrap of information.  \\\" Coke was quite insane \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* I feared that I couldn't control him \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* Coleman was like ice \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* and as much as I have seen to admire in him during the last few days, this quiet beat it all. If he had not recognised my helplessness as far as he was concerned the whole thing might have been a most miserable business. He is a very fine young man.\\\" The dissenting voice to this last tribute was the voice of Mrs. Wainwright. She said: \\\" Well, Coleman drinks, too-everybody knows that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" I know,\\\" responded the professor, rather bashfully, but I am confident that he had not touched a drop.\\\" Marjory said nothing.\",\"timestamp\":1638928682,\"title\":\"She left him again and his galloping thought pounded to the old refrain\"},\"digest\":\"VY_32xRBgXknyKXMUxkR5ROYK56wCunsqbVuzb_KB2c\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xADCB4dF6dDE8773EbfDdd36e426C63f9732738c9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"KpN_IKCMvTFJdKa8Z9dQo2BTDoJzMFelvs50nh5vBXQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"sadke4MH5CdhXg_iV9R-ONTuaUXC2zCj3iQa4-exDto\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"gqAcMNfIaFhMgaYiwR9A62XP_fCWU2DoMuuACZ0i_hYp68jkmkwAak2t3vpNSONtQaBtuDL-ReXblkuuALBRmQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xbc5036e736a9e5ef11135dfbf7bf4e650b15e33e8b5b705b32f73554821b02f63e747289cf70d25b682d43c0338e727abbedc85c651294de72265624b813721f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"KpN_IKCMvTFJdKa8Z9dQo2BTDoJzMFelvs50nh5vBXQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"sadke4MH5CdhXg_iV9R-ONTuaUXC2zCj3iQa4-exDto\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"VY_32xRBgXknyKXMUxkR5ROYK56wCunsqbVuzb_KB2c\"}"
