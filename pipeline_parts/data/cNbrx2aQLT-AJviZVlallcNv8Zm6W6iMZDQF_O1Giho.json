"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Pirithous had made an irruption into the plain of Marathon, and carried off the herds of the king of Athens.  Theseus went to repel the plunderers.  The moment Pirithous beheld him, he was seized with admiration; he stretched out his hand as a token of peace, and cried, \\\"Be judge thyself,   what satisfaction dost thou require?\\\"  \\\"Thy friendship,\\\" replied the Athenian, and they swore inviolable fidelity.  Their deeds corresponded to their professions, and they ever continued true brothers in arms.  Each of them aspired to espouse a daughter of Jupiter.  Theseus fixed his choice on Helen, then but a child, afterwards so celebrated as the cause of the Trojan war, and with the aid of his friend he carried her off.  Pirithous aspired to the wife of the monarch of Erebus; and Theseus, though aware of the danger, accompanied the ambitious lover in his descent to the underworld.  But Pluto seized and set them on an enchanted rock at his palace gate, where they remained till Hercules arrived and liberated Theseus, leaving Pirithous to his fate.\\n\\nAfter the death of Antiope, Theseus married Phaedra, daughter of Minos, king of Crete.  Phaedra saw in Hippolytus, the son of Theseus, a youth endowed with all the graces and virtues of his father, and of an age corresponding to her own.  She loved him, but he repulsed her advances, and her love was changed to hate. She used her influence over her infatuated husband to cause him to be jealous of his son, and he imprecated the vengeance of Neptune upon him.  As Hippolytus was one day driving his chariot along the shore, a sea-monster raised himself above the waters, and frightened the horses so that they ran away and dashed the chariot to pieces.  Hippolytus was killed, but by Diana's assistance Aesculapius restored him to life.  Diana removed Hippolytus from the power of his deluded father and false stepmother, and placed him in Italy under the protection of the nymph Egeria.\\n\\nTheseus at length lost the favor of his people, and retired to the court of Lycomedes, king of Scyros, who at first received him kindly, but afterwards treacherously slew him.  In a later age the Athenian general Cimon discovered the place where his remains were laid, and caused them to be removed to Athens, where they were deposited in a temple called the Theseum, erected in honor of the hero.\\n\\nThe queen of the Amazons whom Theseus espoused is by some called Hippolyta.  That is the name she bears in Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream,   the subject of which is the festivities attending the nuptials of Theseus and Hippolyta.\\n\\nMrs. Hemans has a poem on the ancient Greek tradition that the \\\"Shade of Theseus\\\" appeared strengthening his countrymen at the battle of Marathon.\\n\\nMr. Lewis Morris has a beautiful poem on Helen, in the Epic of Hades.  In these lines Helen describes how she was seized by Theseus and his friend:\\n\\n\\\\----------\\\"There came a night When I lay longing for my love, and knew Sudden the clang of hoofs, the broken doors, The clash of swords, the shouts, the groans, the stain Of red upon the marble, the fixed gaze Of dead and dying eyes,   that was the time When first I looked on death,   and when I woke >From my deep swoon, I felt the night air cool Upon my brow, and the cold stars look down, As swift we galloped o'er the darkling plain And saw the chill sea-glimpses slowly wake, With arms unknown around me.  When the dawn Broke swift, we panted on the pathless steeps, And so by plain and mountain till we came to Athens, ----------.\\\"\\n\\nTheseus is a semi-historical personage.  It is recorded of him that he united the several tribes by whom the territory of Attica was then possessed into one state, of which Athens was the capital.  In commemoration of this important event, he instituted the festival of Panathenaea, in honor of Minerva, the patron deity of Athens.  This festival differed from the other Grecian games chiefly in two particulars.  It was peculiar to the Athenians, and its chief feature was a solemn procession in which the Peplus or sacred robe of Minerva was carried to the Parthenon, and suspended before the statue of the goddess.  The Peplus was covered with embroidery, worked by select virgins of the noblest families in Athens.  The procession consisted of persons of all ages and both sexes.  The old men carried olive- branches in their hands, and the young men bore arms.  The young women carried baskets on their heads, containing the sacred utensils, cakes, and all things necessary for the sacrifices. The procession formed the subject of the bas-reliefs by Phidias which embellished the outside of the temple of the Parthenon.  A considerable portion of these sculptures is now in the British museum among those known as the \\\"Elgin marbles.\\\"\\n\\nOLYMPIC AND OTHER GAMES\\n\\nWe may mention here the other celebrated national games of the Greeks.  The first and most distinguished were the Olympic, founded, it was said , by Jupiter himself.  They were celebrated at Olympia in Elis.  Vast numbers of spectators flocked to them from every part of Greece, and from Asia, Africa, and Sicily. They were repeated every fifth year in midsummer, and continued five days.  They gave rise to the custom of reckoning time and dating events by Olympiads.  The first Olympiad is generally considered as corresponding with the year 776 B.C.  The Pythian games were celebrated in the vicinity of Delphi, the Isthmian on the Corinthian isthmus, the Nemean at Nemea, a city of Argolis.\\n\\nThe exercises in these games were of five sorts: running, leaping, wrestling, throwing the quoit, and hurling the javelin, or boxing.  Besides these exercises of bodily strength and agility, there were contests in music, poetry, and eloquence. Thus these games furnished poets, musicians, and authors the best opportunities to present their productions to the public, and the fame of the victors was diffused far and wide.\\n\\nDAEDALUS\\n\\nThe labyrinth from which Theseus escaped by means of the clew of Ariadne, was built by Daedalus, a most skilful artificer.  It was an edifice with numberless winding passages and turnings opening into one another, and seeming to have neither beginning nor end, like the river Maender, which returns on itself, and flows now onward, now backward, in its course to the sea.  Daedalus built the labyrinth for King Minos, but afterwards lost the favor of the king, and was shut up in a tower.  He contrived to make his escape from his prison, but could not leave the island by sea, as the king kept strict watch on all the vessels, and permitted none to sail without being carefully searched.  \\\"Minos may control the land and sea,:\\\" said Daedalus, \\\"but not the regions of the air. I will try that way.\\\"  So he set to work to fabricate wings for himself and his young son Icarus.  He wrought feathers together beginning with the smallest and adding larger, so as to form an increasing surface.  The larger ones he secured with thread and the smaller with wax, and gave the whole a gentle curvature like the wings of a bird.  Icarus, the boy, stood and looked on, sometimes running to gather up the feathers which the wind had blown away, and then handling the wax and working it over with his fingers, by his play impeding his father in his labors.  When at last the work was done, the artist, waving his wings, found himself buoyed upward and hung suspended, poising himself on the beaten air.  He next equipped his son in the same manner, and taught him how to fly, as a bird tempts her young ones from the lofty nest into the air.  When all was prepared for flight, he said, \\\"Icarus, my son, I charge you to keep at a moderate height, for if you fly too low the damp will clog your wings, and if too high the heat will melt them.  Keep near me and you will be safe.\\\"  While he gave him these instructions and fitted the wings to his shoulders, the face of the father was wet with tears, and his hands trembled.  He kissed the boy, not knowing that it was for the last time.  Then rising on his wings he flew off, encouraging him to follow, and looked back from his own flight to see how his son managed his wings.  As they flew the ploughman stopped his work to gaze, and the shepherd learned on his staff and watched them, astonished at the sight, and thinking they were gods who could thus cleave the air.\\n\\nThey passed Samos and Delos on the left and Lebynthos on the right, when the boy, exulting in his career, began to leave the guidance of his companion and soar upward as if to reach heaven. The nearness of the blazing sun softened the wax which held the feathers together, and they came off.  He fluttered with his arms, but no feathers remained to hold the air.  While his mouth uttered cries to his father, it was submerged in the blue waters of the sea, which thenceforth was called by his name.  His father cried, \\\"Icarus, Icarus, where are you?\\\" At last he saw the feathers floating on the water, and bitterly lamenting his own arts, he buried the body and called the land Icaria in memory of his child.  Daedalus arrived safe in Sicily, where he built a temple to Apollo, and hung up his wings, an offering to the god.\\n\\nDaedalus was so proud of his achievements that he could not bear the idea of a rival.  His sister had placed her son Perdix under his charge to be taught the mechanical arts.  He was an apt scholar and gave striking evidences of ingenuity.  Walking on the seashore he picked up the spine of a fish.  Imitating it, he took a piece of iron and notched it on the edge, and thus invented the SAW.  He put two pieces of iron together, connecting them at one end with a rivet, and sharpening the other ends, and made a PAIR OF COMPASSES.  Daedalus was so envious of his nephew's performances that he took an opportunity, when they were together one day on the top of a high tower, to push him off. But Minerva, who favors ingenuity, saw him falling, and arrested his fate by changing him into a bird called after his name, the Partridge.  This bird does not build his next in the trees, nor take lofty flights, but nestles in the hedges, and mindful of his fall, avoids high places.\\n\\nThe death of Icarus is told in the following lines by Darwin:\\n\\n\\\"---------- with melting wax and loosened strings Sunk hapless Icarus on unfaithful wings; Headlong he rushed through the affrighted air, With limbs distorted and dishevelled hair; His scattered plumage danced upon the wave, And sorrowing Nereids decked his watery grave; O'er his pale corse their pearly sea-flowers shed, And strewed with crimson moss his marble bed; Struck in their coral towers the passing bell, And wide in ocean tolled his echoing knell.\\\"\\n\\nCASTOR AND POLLUX\\n\\nCastor and Pollux were the offspring of Leda and the Swan, under which disguise Jupiter had concealed himself.  Leda gave birth to an egg, from which sprang the twins.  Helen, so famous afterwards as the cause of the Trojan war, was their sister.\\n\\nWhen Theseus and his friend Pirithous had carried off Helen from Sparta, the youthful heroes Castor and Pollux, with their followers, hasted to her rescue.  Theseus was absent from Attica, and the brothers were successful in recovering their sister.\\n\\nCastor was famous for taming and managing horses, and Pollux for skill in boxing.  They were united by the warmest affection, and inseparable in all their enterprises.  They accompanied the Argonautic expedition.  During the voyage a storm arose, and Orpheus prayed to the Samothracian gods, and played on his harp, whereupon the storm ceased and stars appeared on the heads of the brothers.  From this incident, Castor and Pollux came afterwards to be considered the patron deities of seamen and voyagers (One of the ships in which St. Paul sailed was named the Castor and Pollux.  See Acts xxviii.II.), and the lambent flames, which in certain sates of the atmosphere play round the sails and masts of vessels, were called by their names.\\n\\nAfter the Argonautic expedition, we find Castor and Pollux engaged in a war with Idas and Lynceus.  Castor was slain, and Pollux, inconsolable for the loss of his brother, besought Jupiter to be permitted to give his own life as a ransom for him. Jupiter so far consented as to allow the two brothers to enjoy the boon of life alternately, passing one day under the earth and the next in the heavenly abodes.  According to another form of the story, Jupiter rewarded the attachment of the brothers by placing them among the stars as Gemini, the Twins.\\n\\nThey received divine honors under the name of Dioscuri (sons of Jove).  They were believed to have appeared occasionally in later times, taking part with one side or the other, in hard-fought fields, and were said on such occasions to be mounted on magnificent white steeds.  Thus, in the early history of Rome, they are said to have assisted the Romans at the battle of Lake Regillus, and after the victory a temple was erected in their honor on the spot where they appeared.\\n\\nMacaulay, in his Lays of Ancient Rome, thus alludes to the legend:\\n\\n\\\"So like they were, no mortal Might one from other know; White as snow their armor was, Their steeds were white as snow. Never on earthly anvil Did such rare armor gleam, And never did such gallant steeds Drink of an earthly stream.                                         .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\\n\\n\\\"Back comes the chief in triumph Who in the hour of fight Hath seen the great Twin Brethren In harness on his right. Safe comes the ship to haven Through billows and through gales, If once the great Twin Brethren Sit shining on the sails.\\\"\\n\\nIn the poem of Atalanta in Calydon Mr. Swinburne thus describes the little Helen and Clytemnestra, the sisters of Castor and Pollux:\\n\\nMELEAGER\\n\\n\\\"Even such I saw their sisters, one swan white, The little Helen, and less fair than she, Fair Clytemnestra, grave as pasturing fawns, Who feed and fear the arrow; but at whiles, As one smitten with love or wrung with joy, She laughs and lightens with her eyes, and then Weeps; whereat Helen, having laughed, weeps too, And the other chides her, and she being chid speaks naught, But cheeks and lips and eyelids kisses her, Laughing; so fare they, as in their blameless bud, And full of unblown life, the blood of gods.\\\"\\n\\nALTHEA\\n\\n\\\"Sweet days before them, and good loves and lords, And tender and temperate honors of the hearth; Peace, and a perfect life and blameless bed\\\"\\n\\nChapter XIV Bacchus.   Ariadne\\n\\nBacchus was the son of Jupiter and Semele.  Juno, to gratify her resentment against Semele, contrived a plan for her destruction. Assuming the form of Beroe, her aged nurse, she insinuated doubts whether it was indeed Jove himself who came as a lover.  Heaving a sigh, she said, \\\"I hope it will turn out so, but I can't help being afraid.  People are not always what they pretend to be.  If he is indeed Jove, make him give some proof of it.  Ask him to come arrayed in all his splendors, such as he wears in heaven. That will put the matter beyond a doubt.\\\"  Semele was persuaded to try the experiment.  She asks a favor, without naming what it is.  Jove gives his promise and confirms it with the irrevocable oath, attesting the river Styx, terrible to the gods themselves. Then she made know her request.  The god would have stopped her as she spake, but she was too quick for him.  The words escaped, and he could neither unsay his promise nor her request.  In deep distress he left her and returned to the upper regions.  There he clothed himself in his splendors, not putting on all his terrors, as when he overthrew the giants, but what is known among the gods as his lesser panoply.  Arrayed in this he entered the chamber of Semele.  Her mortal frame could not endure the splendors of the immortal radiance.  She was consumed to ashes.\\n\\nJove took the infant Bacchus and gave him in charge to the Nysaean nymphs, who nourished his infancy and childhood, and for their care were rewarded by Jupiter by being placed, as the Hyades, among the stars.  When Bacchus grew up he discovered the culture of the vine and the mode of extracting its precious juice; but Juno struck him with madness, and drove him forth a wanderer through various parts of the earth.  In Phrygia the goddess Rhea cured him and taught him her religious rites, and he set out on a progress through Asia teaching the people the cultivation of the vine.  The most famous part of his wanderings is his expedition to India, which is said to have lasted several years.  Returning in triumph he undertook to introduce his worship into Greece, but was opposed by some princes who dreaded its introduction on account of the disorders and madness it brought with it.\\n\\nAs he approached his native city Thebes, Pentheus the king, who had no respect for the new worship, forbade its rites to be performed.  But when it was known that Bacchus was advancing, men and women, but chiefly the latter, young and old poured forth to meet him and to join his triumphal march.\\n\\nMr. Longfellow in his Drinking Song thus describes the march of Bacchus:\\n\\n\\\"Fauns with youthful Bacchus follow; Ivy crowns that brow, supernal As the forehead of Apollo, And possessing youth eternal.\\n\\n\\\"Round about him fair Bacchantes, Bearing cymbals, flutes and thyrses, Wild from Naxian groves or Zante's Vineyards, sing delirious verses.\\\"\\n\\nIt was in vain Pentheus remonstrated, commanded, and threatened. \\\"Go,\\\" said he to his attendants, \\\"seize this vagabond leader of the rout and bring him to me.  I will soon make him confess his false claim of heavenly parentage and renounce his counterfeit worship.\\\"  It was in vain his nearest friends and wisest counselors remonstrated and begged him not to oppose the god. Their remonstrances only made him more violent.\\n\\nBut now the attendants returned whom he had despatched to seize Bacchus.  They had been driven away by the Bacchanals, but had succeeded in taking one of them prisoner, whom, with his hands tied behind him, they brought before the king.  Pentheus beholding him, with wrathful countenance said, \\\"Fellow!  You shall speedily be put to death, that your fate may be a warning to others; but though I grudge the delay of your punishment, speak, tell us who you are, and what are these new rites you presume to celebrate.\\\"\\n\\nThe prisoner unterrified responded, \\\"My name is Acetes; my country is Maeonia; my parents were poor people, who had no fields or flocks to leave me, but they left me their fishing rods and nets and their fisherman's trade.  This I followed for some time, till growing weary of remaining in one place, I learned the pilot's art and how to guide my course by the stars.  It happened as I was sailing for Delos, we touched at the island of Dia and went ashore.  Next morning I sent the men for fresh water and myself mounted the hill to observe the wind; when my men returned bringing with them a prize, as they thought, a boy of delicate appearance, whom they had found asleep.  They judged he was a noble youth, perhaps a king's son, and they might get a liberal ransom for him.  I observed his dress, his walk, his face.  There was something in them which I felt sure was more than mortal.  I said to my men, 'What god there is concealed in that form I know not, but some one there certainly is.  Pardon us, gentle deity, for the violence we have done you, and give success to our undertakings.'  Dictys, one of my best hands for climbing the mast and coming down by the ropes, and Melanthus, my steersman, and Epopeus the leader of the sailors' cry, one and all exclaimed, 'Spare your prayers for us.'  So blind is the lust of gain!  When they proceeded to put him on board I resisted them. 'This ship shall not be profaned by such impiety,' said I. 'I have a greater share in her than any of you.'  But Lycabas, a turbulent fellow, seized me by the throat and attempted to throw me overboard, and I scarcely saved myself by clinging to the ropes.  The rest approved the deed.\\n\\n\\\"Then Bacchus, for it was indeed he, as if shaking off his drowsiness, exclaimed, 'What are you doing with me?  What is this fighting about?  Who brought me here?  Where are you going to carry me?'  One of them replied, 'fear nothing; tell us where you wish to go and we will take you there.'  \\\"Naxos is my home,' said Bacchus; 'take me there and you shall be well rewarded.'  They promised so to do, and told me to pilot the ship to Naxos.  Naxos lay to the right, and I was trimming the sails to carry us there, when some by signs and others by whispers signified to me their will that I should sail in the opposite direction, and take the boy to Egypt to sell him for a slave.  I was confounded and said, 'Let some one else pilot the ship;' withdrawing myself from any further agency in their wickedness.  They cursed me, and one of them exclaiming, 'Don't flatter yourself that we depend on you for our safety,' took my place as pilot, and bore away from Naxos.\\n\\n\\\"Then the god, pretending that he had just become aware of their treachery, looked out over the sea and said in a voice of weeping, 'Sailors, these are not the shores you promised to take me to; yonder island is not my home.  What have I done that you should treat me so?  It is small glory you will gain by cheating a poor boy.'  I wept to hear him, but the crew laughed at both of us, and sped the vessel fast over the sea.  All at once   strange as it may seem, it is true   the vessel stopped, in the mid sea, as fast as if it was fixed on the ground.  The men, astonished, pulled at their oars, and spread more sail, trying to make progress by the aid of both, but all in vain.  Ivy twined round the oars and hindered their motion, and clung with its heavy clusters of berries to the sails.  A vine, laden with grapes, ran up the mast, and along the sides of the vessel.  The sound of flutes was heard and the odor of fragrant wine spread all around. The god himself had a chaplet of vine leaves, and bore in his hand a spear wreathed with ivy.  Tigers crouched at his feet, and lynxes and spotted panthers played around him.  The sailors were seized with terror or madness; some leaped overboard; others, preparing to do the same, beheld their companions in the water undergoing a change, their bodies becoming flattened and ending in a crooked tail.  One exclaimed, 'What miracle is this!' and as he spoke his mouth widened, his nostrils expanded, and scales covered all his body.  Another endeavoring to pull the oar felt his hands shrink up, and presently to be no longer hands but fins; another trying to raise his arms to a rope found he had no arms, and curving his mutilated body, jumped into the sea.  What had been his legs became the two ends of a crescent-shaped tail. The whole crew became dolphins and swam about the ship, now upon the surface, now under it, scattering the spray, and spouting the water from their broad nostrils.  Of twenty men I alone was left. The god cheered me, as I trembled with fear.  'Fear not,' said he; 'steer toward Naxos.'  I obeyed, and when we arrived there, I kindled the altars and celebrated the sacred rites of Bacchus.\\\"\\n\\nPentheus here exclaimed, \\\"We have wasted time enough on this silly story.  Take him away and have him executed without delay.\\\" Acetes was led away by the attendants and shut up fast in prison; but while they were getting ready the instruments of execution, the prison doors opened of their own accord and the chains fell from his limbs, and when the guards looked for him he was no where to be found.\\n\\nPentheus would take no warning, but instead of sending others, determined to go himself to the scene of the solemnities.  The mountain Cithaeron was all alive with worshippers, and the cries of the Bacchanals resounded on every side.  The noise roused the anger of Pentheus as the sound of a trumpet does the fire of a war-horse.  He penetrated the wood and reached an open space where the wildest scene of the orgies met his eyes.  At the same moment the women saw him; and first among them his own mother, Agave, blinded by the god, cried out, \\\"See there the wild boar, the hugest monster that prowls in these woods!  Come on, sisters! I will be the first to strike the wild boar.\\\"  The whole band rushed upon him, and while he now talks less arrogantly, now excuses himself, and now confesses his crime and implores pardon, they press upon and wound him.  In vain he cries to his aunts to protect him from his mother.  Autonoe seized one arm, Ino the other, and between them he was torn to pieces, while his mother shouted, \\\"Victory!  Victory!  We have done it; the glory is ours!\\\"\\n\\nSo the worship of Bacchus was established in Greece.\\n\\nThere is an allusion to the story of Bacchus and the mariners in Milton's Comus, at line 46.  The story of Circe will be found in Chapter XXII.\\n\\n\\\"Bacchus that first from out the purple grape Crushed the sweet poison of misused wine, After the Tuscan mariners transformed, Coasting the Tyrrhene shore as the winds listed On Circe's island fell; (who knows not Circe, The daughter of the Sun?  Whose charmed cup Whoever tasted lost his upright shape, And downward fell into a grovelling swine.)\\\"\\n\\nARIADNE\\n\\nWe have seen in the story of Theseus how Ariadne, the daughter of King Minos, after helping Theseus to escape from the labyrinth, was carried by him to the island of Naxos and was left there asleep, while Theseus pursued his way home without her.  Ariadne, on waking and finding herself deserted, abandoned herself to grief.  But Venus took pity on her, and consoled her with the promise that she should have an immortal lover, instead of the mortal one she had lost.\\n\\nThe island where Ariadne was left was the favorite island of Bacchus, the same that he wished the Tyrrhenian mariners to carry him to, when they so treacherously attempted to make prize of him.  As Ariadne sat lamenting her fate, Bacchus found her, consoled her and made her his wife as Minerva had prophesied to Theseus.  As a marriage present he gave her a golden crown, enriched with gems, and when she died, he took her crown and threw it up into the sky.  As it mounted the gems grew brighter and were turned into stars, and preserving its form Ariadne's crown remains fixed in the heavens as a constellation, between the kneeling Hercules and the man who holds the serpent.\\n\\nSpenser alludes to Ariadne's crown, though he has made some mistakes in his mythology.  It was at the wedding of Pirithous, and not Theseus, that the Centaurs and Lapithae quarrelled.\\n\\n\\\"Look how the crown which Ariadne wore Upon her ivory forehead that same day That Theseus her unto his bridal bore, When the bold Centaurs made that bloody fray With the fierce Lapiths which did them dismay; Being now placed in the firmament, Through the bright heaven doth her beams display, And is unto the stars an ornament, Which round about her move in order excellent.\\\"\\n\\nChapter XV The Rural Deities.   Erisichthon.   Rhoecus.   The Water Deities.   Camenae.   Winds.\\n\\nPan, the god of woods and fields, of flocks and shepherds, dwelt in grottos, wandered on the mountains and in valleys, and amused himself with the chase or in leading the dances of the nymphs. He was fond of music, and, as we have seen, the inventor of the syrinx, or shepherd's pipe, which he himself played in a masterly manner.  Pan, like other gods who dwelt in forests, was dreaded by those whose occupations caused them to pass through the woods by night, for the gloom and loneliness of such scenes dispose the mind to superstitious fears.  Hence sudden fright without any visible cause was ascribed to Pan, and called a Panic terror.\\n\\nAs the name of the god signifies in Greek, ALL, Pan came to be considered a symbol of the universe and personification of Nature; and later still to be regarded as a representative of all the gods, and heathenism itself.\\n\\nSylvanus and Faunus were Latin divinities, whose characteristics are so nearly the same as those of Pan that we may safely consider them as the same personage under different names.\\n\\nThe wood-nymphs, Pan's partners in the dance, were but one of several classes of nymphs.  There were beside them the Naiads, who presided over brooks and fountains, the Oreads, nymphs of mountains and grottos, and the Nereids, sea-nymphs.  The three last named were immortal, but the wood-nymphs, called Dryads or Hamadryads, were believed to perish with the trees which had been their abode, and with which they had come into existence.  It was therefore an impious act wantonly to destroy a tree, and in some aggravated cases was severely punished, as in the instance of Erisichthon, which we shall soon record.\\n\\nMilton, in his glowing description of the early creation, thus alludes to Pan as the personification of Nature:\\n\\n\\\"Universal Pan, Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance, Led on the eternal spring.\\\"\\n\\nAnd describing Eve's abode:\\n\\n\\\"In shadier bower More sacred or sequestered, though but feigned, Pan or Sylvanus never slept, nor nymph Nor Faunus haunted.\\\" Paradise lost, B. IV.\\n\\nIt was a pleasing trait in the old Paganism that it loved to trace in every operation of nature the agency of deity.  The imagination of the Greeks peopled all the regions of earth and sea with divinities, to whose agency it attributed those phenomena which our philosophy ascribes to the operation of the laws of nature.  Sometimes in our poetical moods we feel disposed to regret the change, and to think that the heart has lost as much as the head has gained by the substitution.  The poet Wordsworth thus strongly expresses this sentiment:\\n\\n\\\"Great God, I'd rather be A Pagan, suckled in a creed outworn. So might I, standing on this pleasant lea, Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn; Have sight of Proteus rising from th4e sea, And hear old Tritou blow his wreathed horn.\\\"\\n\\nSchiller, in his poem The Gods of Greece, expresses his regret for the overthrow of the beautiful mythology of ancient times in a way which has called forth an answer from a Christian poetess, Mrs. Browning, in her poem called The Dead Pan.  The two following verses are a specimen:\\n\\n\\\"By your beauty which confesses Some chief Beauty conquering you, By our grand heroic guesses Through your falsehood at the True, We will weep NOT!  Earth shall roll Heir to each god's aureole, And Pan is dead.\\n\\n\\\"Earth outgrows the mythic fancies Sung beside her in her youth; And those debonaire romances Sound but dull beside the truth. Phoebus' chariot course is run! Look up poets, to the sun! Pan, Pan is dead.\\\"\\n\\nThese lines are founded on an early Christian tradition that when the heavenly host told the shepherds at Bethlehem of the birth of Christ, a deep groan, heard through all the isles of Greece, told that the great Pan was dead, and that all the royalty of Olympus was dethroned, and the several deities were sent wandering in cold and darkness.  So Milton, in his Hymn to the Nativity:\\n\\n\\\"The lonely mountains o'er, And the resounding shore, A voice of weeping heard and loud lament; >From haunted spring and dale, Edged with poplar pale, The parting genius is with sighing sent; With flower-enwoven tresses torn, The nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn.\\\"\\n\\nERISICHTHON\\n\\nErisichthon was a profane person and a despiser of the gods.  On one occasion he presumed to violate with the axe a grove sacred to Ceres.  There stood in this grove a venerable oak, so large that it seemed a wood in itself, its ancient trunk towering aloft, whereon votive garlands were often hung and inscriptions carved expressing the gratitude of suppliants to the nymph of the tree.  Often had the Dryads danced round it hand in hand.  Its trunk measured fifteen cubits round, and it overtopped the other trees as they overtopped the shrubbery.  But for all that, Erisichthon saw no reason why he should spare it, and he ordered his servants to cut it down.  When he saw them hesitate, he snatched an axe from one, and thus impiously exclaimed, :\\\"I care not whether it be a tree beloved of the Goddess or not; were it the goddess herself it should come down, if it stood in my way.\\\" So saying, he lifted the axe, and the oak seemed to shudder and utter a groan.  When the first blow fell upon the trunk, blood flowed from the wound.  All the bystanders were horror-struck, and one of them ventured to remonstrate and hold back the fatal axe.  Erisichthon with a scornful look, said to him, \\\"Receive the reward of your piety;\\\" and turned against him the weapon which he had held aside from the tree, gashed his body with many wounds, and cut off his head.
