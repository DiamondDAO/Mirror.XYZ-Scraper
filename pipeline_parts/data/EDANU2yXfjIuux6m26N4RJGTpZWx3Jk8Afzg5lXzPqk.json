"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Recently, the Ministry of electronics and information technology (meity) of India released a 52 page \\\"blockchain national strategy\\\" (NSB) document to urge the government and the private sector to strengthen cooperation and establish blockchain infrastructure in the world's second most populous country.\\n\\nIt should be noted that the current NSB file is an updated version of the file released earlier this year. According to the document, India hopes to develop a national blockchain platform to further use blockchains in various sectors. Therefore, meity hopes to establish a \\\"national blockchain framework\\\" (NBF), because a \\\"geographically distributed national shared infrastructure\\\" with nodes distributed all over India is necessary for the country to benefit from the blockchain on a large scale.\\n\\nThe document states that the national blockchain infrastructure will be used to provide blockchain as a service. It added that the development of NBF will require cooperation between academic institutions, governments, start-ups and industries. Initially, NBF will only be used in the field of e-government, and over time, it will transition to a broader use case.\\n\\nThe document states that it \\\"describes the overall vision and development and implementation strategy of the national blockchain platform, covering technology stack, legal and regulatory framework, standard setting, cooperation, human resource development and potential use cases\\\". It added that meity would work with other ministries and other stakeholders to ensure the implementation of the strategy.\\n\\nAlthough the document provides a broad view of the Indian government's blockchain ambition, it does not set specific goals or implementation timetable. However, it serves as a guide for government and industry stakeholders. When cryptocurrency is under the regulatory cloud, it also brings vitality to India's blockchain community.\\n\\nFinally, India's planned cryptocurrency bill has been included in the agenda of the current parliamentary session. Since the draft has not been published publicly, it has triggered many speculation about its possible impact. But the goal of the bill is to ban all private cryptocurrencies. The latest report shows that the government will regulate cryptocurrencies as assets rather than ban them completely, which injects a glimmer of hope into the cryptocurrency community.\\n\\n报错 笔记\",\"timestamp\":1638978838,\"title\":\"India releases national blockchain strategy around E-government\"},\"digest\":\"m2HOrA8r_63xJbOM8K9OysApdv8rARKRqN4OTlXfc4k\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9895a3064948f82dc890E2599a193e3D7a4a16d6\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"EiSGN5mYPhWngwdqDx4OU6VCh4m7y-AUCPUjLZKF60M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"LaKruloFtGEt6LPPeKEUyCym_9ZLBvk1C2OEaYkLRE8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"GXKHfH77USvUTUAiEh9QNbzXrwW_de0DJJgcnCJphymPVLJY-BJXSLY5Kgf2WEmjNQbaSnMOLwHadPKAsyoaMQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0e88bca0a1bc4973d1bffd034511b408b352784e8dfd73e7245785ce48b4bcfc46d1ad9c16be537f9a27980b11a71fd8fdcedc882440cb434b495d16411c16981c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"EiSGN5mYPhWngwdqDx4OU6VCh4m7y-AUCPUjLZKF60M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"LaKruloFtGEt6LPPeKEUyCym_9ZLBvk1C2OEaYkLRE8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"m2HOrA8r_63xJbOM8K9OysApdv8rARKRqN4OTlXfc4k\"}"
