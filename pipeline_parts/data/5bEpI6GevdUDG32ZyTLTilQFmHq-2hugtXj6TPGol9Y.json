"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"A man was going to the house of some rich person. As he went along the road, he saw a box of good apples at the side of the road. He said, \\\"I do not want to eat those apples; for the rich man will give me much food; he will give me very nice food to eat.\\\" Then he took the apples and threw them away into the dust. \\n  \\n He went on and came to a river. The river had become very big; so he could not go over it. He waited for some time; then he said, \\\"I cannot go to the rich man's house today, for I cannot get over the river.\\\" \\n  \\n He began to go home. He had eaten no food that day. He began to want food. He came to the apples, and he was glad to take them out of the dust and eat them. \\n  \\n Do not throw good things away; you may be glad to have them at some other time.\",\"timestamp\":1636620079,\"title\":\"A man was going to the house of some rich person\"},\"digest\":\"--X5mcnrbpRyF7BTNftvinqn7R5sR6LfAeZVbQALs5g\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD81e91D2606b5E9A9f39D1385bF351c740386199\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"pdwNVnHtxLDhlxKoeInxxbs5e88rF9S26Nxi_ybCmFs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ur0Ne8DyLqQukVC_cwiYwjeZd43lEhBu3Fv_vrMdi0c\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"2jQoGlgGzV1PrRfgs4zmsxGGE-M05J5bpIzPK3hO5ZIPrLZ1rcKHaX9Sh5Y_M9S-vznTWrCYUGc8VOPUntDMZQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xcc686d6d88d65d14fc782e21cc6e0e173b06607901c2a35eec9291b4f39a0897706769aac7acf79d1a97ad8da1c919efc96f5a23ab252c89f26e8a0bf31efcde1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"pdwNVnHtxLDhlxKoeInxxbs5e88rF9S26Nxi_ybCmFs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ur0Ne8DyLqQukVC_cwiYwjeZd43lEhBu3Fv_vrMdi0c\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"--X5mcnrbpRyF7BTNftvinqn7R5sR6LfAeZVbQALs5g\"}"
