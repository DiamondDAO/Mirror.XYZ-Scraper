"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Fun is a fundamental element in any game because if the game amuses you, excites you, excites you and engages you, then it is a great game. If the same feelings are shared with all the other players, then the game is bound to be successful in the medium term.\\n\\n \\n\\nAll this is what is happening to me and to all the people involved in some way in Splinterlands: you enter with the aim of investing to obtain a return but then the point of view changes, you are so involved that at a certain point that everyone makes their moves for fun rather than strategy.\\n\\n \\n\\nOn the other hand it is impossible to be indifferent to something in which you are totally involved, Hive and Splinterlands for example are the clear examples. How can a simple game draw the whole world to Hive? Underestimate the economic strength of the videogames sector that annulment has billions of dollars, one of the few sectors that did not experience the economic crisis during the pandemic, indeed it has continued to increase its turnover!\\n\\n \\n\\nAttracting large companies to Splinterlands is the key to mass adoption, which is why @aggroed gave an interview to Nasdaq, a window on the world of global finance. If you still don’t believe in Splinterlands’ potential, despite its 500k active users, and huge marketing campaign underway, then you are missing out on a great opportunity for yourself.\\n\\n \",\"timestamp\":1639376688,\"title\":\"The bright future of Splinterlands and my legendary CL cards\"},\"digest\":\"DTQJu0Wuuv3VsD5QRRlssqp7zXPApYeLHK2HavHsz6c\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8D1034746C3792Cb72918f00ADEab358f30478Ed\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-TTNj_LcsNAaM16KAveEUf5XMleNiJ-UioMu4M7v5Wc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QhY7Ngxarm8lBySeoNScW6zjK45dRo3WErNu70jCxxA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"rv78WRcIwKkYiC1zZ-Dv9S0v10_Z6nKdFR7k5yyuSYHe5B9vQUQs9BI4ZkhiLhN1ROyHMM-4kQJRLoQe4RfPVg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x33f6d459ce6e0b9aaca701386b2c403628e4694b728c612a2a039bb3d580f49d7ef1c06c33fd401931e5210c221d0f2a582592b437977c66610f496b490766521c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-TTNj_LcsNAaM16KAveEUf5XMleNiJ-UioMu4M7v5Wc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QhY7Ngxarm8lBySeoNScW6zjK45dRo3WErNu70jCxxA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"DTQJu0Wuuv3VsD5QRRlssqp7zXPApYeLHK2HavHsz6c\"}"
