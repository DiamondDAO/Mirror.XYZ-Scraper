"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1990\\n\\nIn 1990, the newspaper Pravda disclosed, that couple of years before in 1988, someone was executed for espionage. \\n\\nIt was unusual news as the Cold War had begun to end. The Iron Curtain was falling, rusted away by years of containment, and post-WW II dominoes tilted backwards.\\n\\nThat collapse was helped in part by 25 years of a double-agent’s work. \\n\\nDmitry Polyakov was born in Ukraine in 1921. After serving in WW II, he was recruited by the GRU, Soviet military intelligence. As a loyal son of the Motherland, he rose in the GRU. \\n\\nAt the same time, corruption rose in the system and Polyakov became disillusioned by this betrayal of all the sacrifices his comrades made during the USSR’s ‘War Against the Fascists’.\\n\\nOne day, while stationed at the Mission for the U.N., he approached the C.I.A. He earned trust over the years by sharing a mountain of “intel”, with strategic value, affecting the balance of power with China and Russia.\\n\\nHe refused money but accepted power tools, shot guns and fishing gear. \\n\\nSome of that gear was outfitted with hidden compartments for “intel”. He revealed a British double-agent, and himself was undone by a U.S. double-agent. When a 1984 Soviet magazine published a recipe for cooking a small bird common to Eastern Europe, it was a signal to the C.I.A. that Polyakov’s cover was blown.\\n\\nHis code-name was “Top Hat”.\\n\\n2911\\n\\nJacob C. Tagore, Jr. had no idea what he was doing.\\n\\nHe was far from the only home he knew, and what family he had left. When he was 10, he lost almost everyone, except for his Uncle Al, June and their friends. Al was almost raised by Jacob’s dad, Jake Sr., after Al lost his own dad. The truth of his family, half-hidden, was uncovered by time.\\n\\nHis dad’s half-remembered stories were mixed up with Al’s and June’s versions. \\n\\nAll unbelievable adventures, going back to the Long War, through the lean years after the Treaty of Mars, and then life aboard “The Magpie”. Stories, including how his Dad got the “Magpie” thanks to June, from the old Musk shipyards, and about Dad’s old friend, someone named “Cadmus” who was a genius. And lots of sad things too, about monsters who were people on the outside but dark on the inside.\\n\\nHe used to love the stories until he turned 10. \\n\\nThat’s when he learned all the stories, especially the scary ones, were real. And that’s when everything changed. Jacob and his family lived a life of secrets. \\n\\nAnd when he lost almost everyone, he began to learn why. \\n\\nThey lived that way so that one day they could undo an even bigger secret - “The Great Upload”. The Triumvirate, after the Long War ended, promised a new kind of paradise for all humanity. Everyone would live like gods on a new kind of “’Verse”. \\n\\nThe problem was that it was a lie - everyone could die as soon as the Triumvirate hits the switch in a few years.\\n\\nHow does someone live up to the expectations of heroic stories and live down the pain of tragic memories? How does one learn to live a life of secrets, in the service of undoing the greatest lie that ever existed?\\n\\nIn Jacob’s case, he joined a tribe of spies led by a spymaster.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3wLY6Zip1gdlxAoLBLjec.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9xuTV4Dsbbf8E6j1W3KBb.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633889895,\"title\":\"1961: 5.2 Top Hats and Tall Tales, 2911\"},\"digest\":\"wQG-A3J1mhnMqHcrD7iBagCoE2JcAyciaAV4DZJIMqI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"qR4cyF2Nh0-s1Mg6Ec2_BMLzpqPQ6qbbL1lYq4PH-e8noVgBBeA7-v4PXrYsMYoUFhBDLS7sthpeUXwjkH-lZg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wQG-A3J1mhnMqHcrD7iBagCoE2JcAyciaAV4DZJIMqI\"}"
