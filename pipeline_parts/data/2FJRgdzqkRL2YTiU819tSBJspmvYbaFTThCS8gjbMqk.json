"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"On or around Dec 2021, at a yet-to-be-determined date, the project will go through the MEAN Governance Token Generation Event (TGE). The initial supply is composed of community airdrops to MeanFi app users and eligible Mean DAO community members as defined below:\\n\\n# Who qualifies for the MEAN airdrop?\\n\\nTo qualify for the airdrop of MEAN tokens, you can be in one or more of these categories:\\n\\n1. **Early Adopters**, measured by\\n   1. Going to [https://meanfi.com](https://meanfi.com/), connecting your wallet, and approving transactions, swaps, etc. Your account address total usage is the sum of the usage from both in devnet or mainnet.\\n      1. **IMPORTANT NOTE**: Accounts with identified bot activity will be disqualified on the spot, and permanently banned.\\n   2. 100% of the Network and Protocol Fees Paid in mainnet from Sept 17th until TGE count towards your usage. A number of MEAN tokens equivalent to the value of the fees paid (both network and protocol fees) will be credited during the airdrop to the respective fee-payers.\\n2. **Qualified Referrals**, the number of qualified referrals completed in the MeanFi app associated with your Solana account address, as measured by\\n   1. A new address referred by your dedicated referral link (App ‚Üí \\\\[...\\\\] Menu ‚Üí Refer a friend) that completes at least $100 worth of transactions (recurring exchanges, scheduled transfers, payroll, etc.) within 7 days of their first connection to MeanFi. Some operations qualify for more than others, for example if your referral schedules a recurring exchange gives you 2x the points than if they do a one-time swap, and doing a recurring exchange for 10 weeks will give you 5x more than a recurring exchange for 2 weeks.\\n   2. We want to incentivize the use of the platform, so any and every action available scores airdrop allocation points for referrals.\\n   3. For each qualified referral, the referrer account address will qualify for an allocation from the referral pool up to $25 USDC worth of MEAN tokens, depending on your share of the pool, and the actions of the qualified referral within the 7-day window.\\n3. **Community Engagement**, measured by\\n   1. The highest Discord Leveling Role earned by TGE.\\n   2. The number of Discord Skill Roles earned by TGE\\n   3. Your personal Twitter engagement metrics:\\n      1. Total referrals, likes, mentions, retweets, quote-retweets, and posts tagging 3+ accounts.\\n      2. You'll get bonus points for getting specific engagements from targeted communities with the @meanfinance Twitter account\\n      3. **Target Hashtags**: #solana #defi #mean #money #blockchain #dao\\n      4. Posts that include #airdrop, #wen, and #wentoken hashtags will be counted as a negative activity, so don‚Äôt use them.\\n      5. **IMPORTANT GUARDRAILS FOR TWITTER**:\\n         1. You are **NOT an official spokesperson** for the DAO. That means you should post your own opinions and not speak on behalf of the DAO through your posts.\\n         2. **NO spamming people** with micro-messages, or posts that add no value to the conversation. Be thoughtful about tagging someone, and only do it when the message is relevant to them and their recent interests and activity.\\n         3. Most of the time is it better to **comment on a previous tweet of a person**, and make the comment relevant to the context they are already talking about, rather than to create a tweet from nothing and tag them there.\\n4. **Partner Protocol Token Holder**, measured by,\\n   1. The gross tokens from the selected partner protocols you hold at TGE\\n\\n# Airdrop Rewards Booster\\n\\nIf your position falls in the top 10 percentile of any of the four eligible categories of the airdrop, you'll qualify for a 10% Airdrop Rewards Booster!\\n\\n<aside>\\nüëÄ This is something worth celebrating!!! üéâü•≥üéá\\n\\n</aside>\\n\\n### ‚û°Ô∏è Let the Mean Games begin! ... or is it Mean Squid? ü¶ë\\n\\nNote that you can receive Rewards Booster on all four categories and multiply your airdrop earning potential.\\n\\n**Special Boosts and Exceptions:**\\n\\n* There is no participation in the Earned Roles distribution from Staff and Core Team members.\\n* If the Mean DAO Community passes the goal of 10k qualified addresses for the Airdrop, then:\\n  * All Ambassadors get a guaranteed 10% boost from their earned community level.\\n  * All Mods get a guaranteed 20% boost from their earned community level.\\n\\n# Initial Token Price\\n\\nThe price discovery of MEAN at TGE will be determined by the Mean Launch process, which will be described closer to IDO date. One thing is clear, the more people use the app before the TGE, the higher the value of the MEAN tokens airdropped to qualifying users. This is inspired by the DyDx tokenomics and incentive structure which aligns usage with price extremely well.\\n\\nIn addition, the token price on the public sale is lower bound by the private round, and will be announced by the launch IDO platform(s) after professional market making on the token. The market making process determines intent and demand from the market to establish the ultimate listing price of the token.\\n\\n## Steps to register\\n\\nTo get the most out of the airdrop, you'll need to register your socials so we can count them. If you don't register your socials, we'll only be able to airdrop the bonuses that are **not** related with social media challenges.\\n\\n1. Complete this [FORM](https://forms.gle/Ggt3A8JUN9FvpQ1F8)\\n2. Join the [Mean DAO Discord](https://discord.meanfi.com) and start earning your roles\\n3. Follow [@meanfinance](https://twitter.com/meanfinance) on Twitter\\n\\nWe hope it goes without saying that fraudulent activity will result in immediate disqualification of those addresses and related accounts from the airdrop. We are watching for identified bot accounts, bot patterns and activity, double usage, spam registrations, Sybil attacks, swarm/ape behavior with copy/pasted messages, and other security measures to guarantee a fair airdrop for everyone.\\n\\n***IMPORTANT REMINDER***: Registering alone is not enough to get your MEAN airdropped. Your allocation will depend on the activity and contributions described above.\",\"timestamp\":1639098704,\"title\":\"MEAN Tokenomics & Airdrop\"},\"digest\":\"3iDJRXmt6X-Xgga6_IDenFGcvnR3Sx4uYTP_WkgFbs8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xC888272741deAc7F4A2528f2AB3614a29Fc8DB0C\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"e1K6T-uJdZY1Pc5WPu4C8y3N_u_f9QGdNwBEFa3m9Vo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Z6MRjjSGwTxKg6SoczBH2WXGFh-QOcqauz15_61lJ00\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"3CcFBuRltHw1G2rPL3-dK7AGTSLb51rokUezWi0-3r065gd42jN36NhsZ3RSsWYA0zLfQc5K9nbi6pfsO0mRNg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9037d065980306fd7da3b670b93b2eba4d4da0c5024d03d4df2c1861fbb299865949a98fc5ee027bd93145519855d8f179f39e2711ed10021d5767076a1a534a1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"e1K6T-uJdZY1Pc5WPu4C8y3N_u_f9QGdNwBEFa3m9Vo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Z6MRjjSGwTxKg6SoczBH2WXGFh-QOcqauz15_61lJ00\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"B2Nj-9thZGcLVgNDfx3_XQ-8amqbwPMfcecc0j2yqo8\"}"
