"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The [Sony](https://www.cnet.com/tags/sony/) Xperia Pro-I isn't the first phone to have a one-inch camera sensor. But it's the first to put the one-inch sensor from the popular [Sony RX100 VII camera](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/compact-cameras/all-compact-cameras/p/dscrx100m7-b) into a phone. Lucky for us, Sony didn't stop there and added a mechanical dual-aperture, a new 50-millimeter lens, EyeAF support to video and a new app called Video Pro. The price for all of this is $1,800 which converts roughly to £1,300, AU$2,400.\\n\\nIf you are obsessed with finding the [best cameras](https://www.cnet.com/news/best-camera-gear-and-cameras-of-2020-canon-nikon-more/) on a phone, the past month has been a generous one. [Apple](https://www.cnet.com/apple/) released the [iPhone 13](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/iphone-13-review/) and [13 Pro](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/iphone-13-pro-max-review/). [Google](https://www.cnet.com/google/) launched [Pixel 6](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/google-pixel-6-review-yes-it-lives-up-to-the-hype/) and [6 Pro](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/google-pixel-6-pro-review-the-best-android-phone-money-can-buy/). And now there is the Sony Xperia Pro-I. The I stands for imaging. At least, that's what Sony told me.\\n\\nGet the CNET Mobile newsletter\\n\\nFind the best phones, apps and accessories with our CNET Mobile newsletter.

In 2018, cinema camera maker [Red got our hopes up with the Hydrogen One phone](https://www.cnet.com/reviews/red-hydrogen-one-review/) which ended up having a mid-tier Android camera system that could shoot 3D photos and videos. \\n\\nNow don't get me wrong, what Apple, Google, [Huawei](https://www.cnet.com/tags/huawei/) and [Samsung](https://www.cnet.com/samsung/) have been able to do with tiny image sensors and computational photography is absolutely amazing. But you have to wonder: What if the iPhone, instead of having an image sensor that was 0.6 inches, had one that was one-inch? And that's where Sony enters the conversation with the Xperia Pro-I. It's basically a [Sony Xperia 1 III phone](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/sony-xperia-1-iii-review-it-could-have-been-magnificent-phone/) with the sensor from a Sony RX100 VII camera.\\n\\n![Sony Xperia Pro-I](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/yLNVSeDlp3pX6-FiGiuIM1FY8Sg=/1092x0/2021/10/26/87594683-249d-4722-ae34-33211b6e05de/p1018318-1.jpg?size=large pull-none hasCaption shortcode)\\n\\nWhat's amazing is that Sony was able to fit a one-inch sensor into a phone body that is roughly the same thickness as an [iPhone 13 Pro Max](https://www.cnet.com/videos/review-iphone-13-pro-and-13-pro-max-are-apples-best/). A larger sensor means a wider dynamic range and improved low-light performance for both photos and videos. But it turns out, that one-inch image sensor might not be fully used. The [camera review website DPReview points out](https://www.dpreview.com/news/1641689739/sony-just-packed-a-1-stacked-cmos-sensor-into-the-xperia-pro-i-but-there-s-a-catch) that just 60% of the Xperia Pro-I's one-inch sensor is used for photos and videos. That means instead of taking 20-megapixel photos like the Sony RX100 VII, the Xperia Pro-I takes 12-megapixel photos. That's not necessarily a dealbreaker, but it's a definite bummer.\\n\\nSony sent me a pre-production sample of the Xperia Pro-I to try. Photos and videos look good. Check out the hands-on video attached to this article to see video clips I shot using the Xperia Pro-I. I still have more testing and will do a full in-depth review once I can get a final production sample. All photos and videos I shot were taken with the main camera and its 24-millimeter lens or the ultrawide camera with its 16-millimeter lens. The 50-millimeter camera was disabled on the pre-production prototype.\",\"timestamp\":1635250157,\"title\":\"The $1,800 Sony Xperia Pro-I phone has a one-inch camera sensor and a dual-aperture\"},\"digest\":\"rY947q0ToVpCMu_bPPHpSxFH6Tth7FWpyt7fvXMwDgo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xCfc76E86305228994324774C3Bdc98272a4700f3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rAnZJNcVjY-rKvYnVuoYp-6LFq6chIyUgftaZktL35A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"HNnk0A6eytwi2QaIXqCKpJ-J4DgqZkMmdnizvyDP_vY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"j47O0rRTz1nxSOBHJH5BCWUtFolW7vzRS0oH1-6qPxOdg14S-aCuuKZqVJfuvpWHDKE6Ex2YBnhyDj-xrU90tQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe7667856d8de1d831d7bfafa88e2cb8a13a7748d25601ef5b3b4aae278aa35b6061a8d14fa39ba60ebe95fd18274237dc09045d519bdafe6a1d9ff629cfdc36d1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rAnZJNcVjY-rKvYnVuoYp-6LFq6chIyUgftaZktL35A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"HNnk0A6eytwi2QaIXqCKpJ-J4DgqZkMmdnizvyDP_vY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rY947q0ToVpCMu_bPPHpSxFH6Tth7FWpyt7fvXMwDgo\"}"
