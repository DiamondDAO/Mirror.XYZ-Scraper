Personally I am seeing various technologies as tools in the space right now for collecting, organizing, playing and getting compensated for music. The service being provided is by the artists and musicians. The software or app is a tool to gain access to the services they’re providing. Is this arguable? Yes, but we’re gonna rock with it for simplicity sake. It is also worth noting that not all platforms being reviewed are for streaming, some have features that would be cool to integrate into a streaming tool but as I do more research I realize I am patch working some very specific features together here and not one project has combined it all in the ways I am looking for on web3…..YET.\\n\\nI am also going to repeat this: *Because we are so used to having access to enormous libraries of music immediately, there does need to be some context and patience in these beta spaces I realize. After all we are literally building this new world together.*\\n\\nOk, now that we’ve sorted that let’s see what’s on offer in this space atm.\\n\\nBelow I give a brief summary, little bit on tech, pros and cons and my closing thoughts for each that I have come across or have been recommended to check out thus far. These are NOT exhaustive reviews, they are my surface level observations of the UX, features and the little bit I know about each brand. In this post I’ll be reviewing Audius, Sound, YouSound, Catalog, Opus and Rug Radio.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/kyma/status/1480425451164094464?s=20](https://twitter.com/kyma/status/1480425451164094464?s=20)\\n\\n*Special shout out **[@feelosopher777](https://twitter.com/feelosopher777)** for sparking the inspiration for this on my original Tweet. I don’t know you, but I appreciate you!*\\n\\n## R E V I E W S\\n\\n### Audius:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/AudiusProject](https://twitter.com/AudiusProject)\\n\\n**Summary:** “Giving everyone the freedom to distribute, monetize, and stream unstoppable audio.”\\n\\n* **The Tech:** App; As a platform owned and operated by its users, the future of Audius is entirely driven by $AUDIO governance. Everything about Audius is governable, with voting weight directly correlated to $AUDIO staked for value-added services.\\n* **Pros:**\\n  * Has backing from major DJs and producers\\n  * Interface is familiar\\n  * Can post works in progress - to share the process\\n  * “free forever”\\n  * Fans can download stems and find remixes.\\n* **Cons:**\\n  * UX seems to be a bit confusing in figuring out what’s going on initially. Has a more familiar layout once inside the player.\\n  * Their “Artist’s Podcasts” links to YouTube - not sure why they don’t have their podcasts uploaded to their own platform.\\n  * Having trouble finding where to submit or upload music as an artist\\n* **My Thoughts:** This was definitely designed with producers and DJs in mind. The UX isn’t to my personal taste. Artist-centric for creative ways to engage with audiences. Audience payback for engaging with artists is tokens. Community governance.\\n\\n### sound.xyz:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/soundxyz_/status/1480570722711912448?s=20](https://twitter.com/soundxyz_/status/1480570722711912448?s=20)\\n\\n**Summary:** “SOUND GIVES ARTISTS THE CHANCE TO DEBUT NEW MUSIC AS A SET OF NFTS. EACH EDITION OF THE NFT IS NUMBERED UNIQUELY, SO LISTENERS CAN SHOWCASE THEIR EARLY SUPPORT. SINCE EARLY EDITIONS ARE CONSIDERED MORE VALUABLE THAN LATER EDITIONS, BACKERS ARE INCENTIVIZED TO DISCOVER NEW MUSIC EARLY.”\\n\\n* **The Tech:** NFTs, webpage\\n* **Pros:**\\n  * Design aesthetic and branding is cool\\n  * Gives artist ability to share backstory for each project\\n  * Ability to comment on wall - social engagement, only if you “own” the NFT, if you sell this capability and any comments disappear\\n  * Creative rewards for listeners\\n  * You can see who else is in the “audience,” who else has bought a piece of the music.\\n* **Cons:**\\n  * I’m not seeing capabilities to organize playlists or stream music without adding it to your collection. Maybe I needed to connect my wallet for this (which I didn’t do).\\n  * At the time of posting, library is pretty small and niche. Currently the database only has about 200 contributing artists onboarded.\\n  * It is a curated space so there is gatekeeping for which NFTs are getting featured and what artists are being entered into the database.\\n* **My Thoughts:** A lot of innovative thinking for this one and creative execution for community involvement. At the end of the day I do just want to be able to stream the music though.\\n\\n***Side note inspired by the above:*** I wonder if there is a way to create a tool that allows listeners to stream in a playlist without buying and those that have bought the music along with the artist can then be rewarded by # of streams/popularity from those utilizing the platform as a DMST?\\n\\n### YouSound:\\n\\n[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yousound/id1452078262](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yousound/id1452078262)\\n\\n**Summary:** “All for you.”\\n\\n* **The Tech:** App; not yet web3\\n* **Pros:**\\n  * Merch market\\n  * Artist owned and operated\\n  * Community driven\\n  * Videos and lives\\n  * Can comment on tracklists\\n  * Instagram-esque artist feed for social sharing flyers, videos etc.\\n* **Cons:**\\n  * I don’t know how the payment structure works\\n  * No playlisting feature\\n  * After following an artist I don’t know where to find the database of my favorites.\\n* **My Thoughts:** Created by the community for the community. This is not a web3 native platform but it is definitely one worth paying attention to. They’re getting the social integration right and the merch market. So much potential here! Only wish I could organize the music and individual tracks that I like for playlist-ing and easily share from YouSound to Instagram stories 1.) to support the artists and 2.) to promote the platform.\\n\\n### Catalog:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/catalogworks/status/1475530655329103880?s=20](https://twitter.com/catalogworks/status/1475530655329103880?s=20)\\n\\n**Summary:** “*One of one digital records. Owned by you. Free from platforms. A blank canvas for a new world of music ownership.* Catalog exists to prove the inherent value of music and music discovery. We believe artists should be able to make a living from their music on their own terms. We’re a music platform for artists to press and sell one-of-one digital records, and for listeners to discover, listen to, and collect music from incredible independent artists.”\\n\\n* **The Tech:** NFTs, webpage. Not for “streaming.” Artists collect 100% of their initial sales, and earn a creator share every time their records are resold. These records live beyond the reaches of our platform, enabling artists to capture the value of their music for eternity (even if Catalog disappears). Catalog is currently invite only, and will remain so for some time. They welcome your submissions via the [artist form](https://submissions.catalog.community/), but can't guarantee that you'll hear back. We're a small team, and there’s a lot of work to do before we can support everyone.\\n* **Pros:**\\n  * Design aesthetic is minimalist and sleek\\n  * Encouraging music to be understood and valued as 1/1 works of art\\n* **Cons:**\\n  * NOT a streaming tool\\n  * Slow load time (they are in beta)\\n  * No playlisting feature\\n  * Minimalist nature means effort in finding info for what its all about\\n  * Small team so they can’t get back to all submissions (might be worth looking into setting up a DAO for curation and submission management if submissions is the long term model).\\n* **My Thoughts:** NFT marketplaces are seeming to become the template. I am curious how this is going to translate into streaming, organizing and most importantly, sharing music. Music is art, absolutely yes, however it is collected, consumed and shared in a different manner than visual art. Waiting to see how this space innovates. The digital and visual art world has taken NFTs and ran with it but we are not limited to functioning in the NFT world in this way. This solution is more about the UX design and load-times. How can music NFTs start existing in a familiar yet innovative layout that we’re used to for: playlisting, streaming and collecting music, while simultaneously allowing it and the merchandise to exist as art?\\n\\n### opus.audio\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/opusfoundation](https://twitter.com/opusfoundation)\\n\\n**Summary:** “Help artists generate the revenue they deserve.”\\n\\n* **The Tech:** App - “By basing the OPUS Player on the Ethereum blockchain and storing all the tracks on IPFS, there is no central server so the storage costs are drastically reduced. This allows for more of the revenue to go directly to the artist, in a more secure, transparent way than ever before. At OPUS, over 90% of the revenue you generate will end up in your account. Your transactions will be managed in a secure, efficient, and transparent manner. Never again will you be confused about any part of your revenue. Blockchain-based revenue system.”\\n* **Pros:**\\n  * UX is clean\\n  * Familiar design in player\\n  * Playlisting\\n  * Recommendations\\n* **Cons:**\\n  * Small database of music at the time of writing this\\n  * No social\\n  * Not really a con but this is mostly designed for artists to get paid better royalty % meaning the listener isn’t necessarily incentivized to anything more than listen.\\n* **My Thoughts:** Definitely heading in the right direction with regards to server efficiency, supporting artists and offering a familiar layout for users. The database is small as it is with all of these platforms as brand awareness builds and quality assurance is taken into consideration. I’ll be keeping an eye on opus to see where it goes from here.\\n\\n### Rug Radio:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/RugRadio](https://twitter.com/RugRadio)\\n\\n**Summary:** “Rug Radioᴳᴹ is the first fully decentralized media platform. What does this mean? It means that our community, our hosts, and you own the platform you participate in. Why is it important? Because we need to own the memes, the conversations and the narrative. Ownership means we each get to decide what we consume, how it's delivered, and we all benefit from the abundance we create through it.”\\n\\n* **The Tech:** Not really a streaming platform but could be in the future. They are a media platform offering NFT drops, DAO, Social tokens, PoAPs etc.\\n* **Pros:**\\n  * Simplicity in design and articulation.\\n  * Collective mission\\n  * Creativity and cohesive storytelling\\n* **Cons:**\\n  * We’ll see how easy it is to get a membership pass\\n  * Not yet a DMST\\n* **My Thoughts:** Not a DMST per-se, more of a media DAO but I would keep them on your radar to see how they might innovate in this space. They have the right idea and a mission that I resonate with very much. I do hope they also create a DMST and I’ll be getting in on the drop tomorrow to have a say in it all.\\n\\nWorth mentioning here is HiFi Labs which is going to be a go-to for the artists in getting their art onboarded to the various platforms that are going to rise in this space.\\n\\n[https://www.hifilabs.co](https://www.hifilabs.co)\\n\\n## C O N C L U S I O N\\n\\nI’m looking for a tool that is an easy app, plug and play where I can gain access to a huge library of audio (music, podcasts and even DJ mixes), search that database for artists I know and love, allows me to easily organize that music into a collection or playlist and then decide which, if any, I want to back with $ to own a part of its future success.\\n\\nThe focus on the visual art aspect of NFTs I feel is overlooking the simple necessity of the sound/audio world itself as currency and to “own” or back a portion of the audio in streaming is where this space is exciting. To back an artist early and continue to drive their success, while also getting supported in doing so.\\n\\nThe more backing the smaller the cut or percentage but the more the streams. I am not sure how the math looks for this or if there needs to be a cap for how many supporters/sponsors the audio should/could have. Maybe that should be determined by the artist in their smart contract upon set up? This is where limited-edition or 1 of ___ would come in.\\n\\n### KYMÅ’s (Updated) W I S H L I S T:\\n\\nAfter all of this research what I have determine to want in my DMST is:\\n\\n* A web3 app for iOS, Android and desktop (until we find a way to decentralize hardware)\\n* Ability to curate music into playlists or curated collections + folders.\\n* Potentially “own” pieces of the music so that I can gain passive income from streaming because I invested in an artist that I love early. Because I am invested in them I will share their music and will also be rewarded for sharing.\\n* Rewards for contributing, sharing and listening.\\n* I want to be able to post DJ mixes, listen to DJ mixes and want these to populate when an artist is searched that I’ve included in my mix.\\n* Podcasts\\n* I want merch marketplaces\\n* Social media capabilities inside the app not an external link into another app. App overload is already a very real thing - need to consolidate and compartmentalize - all in one’s. One portal for all my music related needs (oh, the DREAM!!!!)\\n* Listening rooms\\n* Easy abillities to share the app to other social platforms (ie: instagram stories and Twitter).\\n* Modular UX design allowing the users to arrange, re-arrange and customize their interface lay-out to suit their needs. (*Some people might want to see what others are listening to, some may not. Some might want playlists on the right side of their screen, some may not*).\\n* As an artist, cross platform capabilities - ability to have uploaded NFT or audio files be tracked on chain but able to keep track across various streaming tools that are up and coming (not everyone will be listening through the same platforms).\\n\\nWill one team get this all right? I’m hopeful - especially with open-source and if not I may just take it upon myself to gather a group to design it myself. Until then I’ll keep exploring, researching and reporting back with my findings and adding to the WISHLISTS. Music is the uniting force of life, there is so much potential to come together and bring music to the masses in new, exciting and mutually beneficial ways for all involved in this ecosystem. What ideas or wishlist features do you have for a DMST?\\n\\n@ me on Twitter and let’s jam on it!\\n\\n((( 💗 )))\\n\\nTwitter: [@](https://www.twitter.com/_kyma_)*[kyma](https://www.twitter.com/_kyma_) Insta: [@](https://www.instagram.com/_kyma_)*[kyma](https://www.instagram.com/_kyma_)\",\"timestamp\":1642103666,\"title\":\"Economies of Sound: Reviews for Audius, Sound, Catalog, YouSound, Opus and RugRadio\"},\"digest\":\"CFpyQIbO2uL3odegZJyRbep2bqw6EzeWv6b2ktnK3iE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd1348Edc181C989DC5abe4d6Aba9d20ECee176Ad\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PzTTpyQ3Ri9MjCb5WNKiDAuwANnwqxDyWNaQ39QmjLY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"aUeTTwYkjhTLzZLiBqvsEMDFj35-LmRn2bZK5XfBioE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"XRMi4NEs3vz5VL21UHr26aBDd-IIpTPn3yLI63C97izzTAJeBmaBbc-7a29vzp-xbXg36bSb2rynoY0IRP7C2A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xcff3d253af4a6ab9007dbe03bf4c294991007898f24c195136c723d73305dfaf4f1d815ad6dacb12b6aed98ed081cf2a3c10afdce54bd7591e60245d74502c3e1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PzTTpyQ3Ri9MjCb5WNKiDAuwANnwqxDyWNaQ39QmjLY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"aUeTTwYkjhTLzZLiBqvsEMDFj35-LmRn2bZK5XfBioE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"UQTXt9rbhsJh32oZpxT9CRKraocshO-vP-wuTolYDyU\"}"
