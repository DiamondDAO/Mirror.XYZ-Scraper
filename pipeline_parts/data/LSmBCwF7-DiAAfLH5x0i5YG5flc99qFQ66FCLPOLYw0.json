"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Five, ten, twenty talents; ay, fifty, so the wager be with Messala himself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is a mighty sum,\\\" said Malluch. \\\"I must have security.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So thou shalt. Go to Simonides, and tell him I wish the matter arranged. Tell him my heart is set on the ruin of my enemy, and that the opportunity hath such excellent promise that I choose such hazards. On our side be the God of our fathers. Go, good Malluch. Let this not slip.\\\"\\n\\nAnd Malluch, greatly delighted, gave him parting salutation, and started to ride away, but returned presently.\\n\\n\\\"Your pardon,\\\" he said to Ben-Hur. \\\"There was another matter. I could not get near Messala's chariot myself, but I had another measure it; and, from his report, its hub stands quite a palm higher from the ground than yours.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A palm! So much?\\\" cried Ben-Hur, joyfully.\\n\\nThen he leaned over to Malluch.\\n\\n\\\"As thou art a son of Judah, Malluch, and faithful to thy kin, get thee a seat in the gallery over the Gate of Triumph, down close to the balcony in front of the pillars, and watch well when we make the turns there; watch well, for if I have favor at all, I will-- Nay, Malluch, let it go unsaid! Only get thee there, and watch well.\\\"\\n\\nAt that moment a cry burst from Ilderim.\\n\\n\\\"Ha! By the splendor of God! what is this?\\\"\\n\\nHe drew near Ben-Hur with a finger pointing on the face of the notice.\\n\\n\\\"Read,\\\" said Ben-Hur.\\n\\n\\\"No; better thou.\\\"\\n\\nBen-Hur took the paper, which, signed by the prefect of the province as editor, performed the office of a modern programme, giving particularly the several divertisements provided for the occasion. It informed the public that there would be first a procession of extraordinary splendor; that the procession would be succeeded by the customary honors to the god Consus, whereupon the games would begin; running, leaping, wrestling, boxing, each in the order stated. The names of the competitors were given, with their several nationalities and schools of training, the trials in which they had been engaged, the prizes won, and the prizes now offered; under the latter head the sums of money were stated in illuminated letters, telling of the departure of the day when the simple chaplet of pine or laurel was fully enough for the victor, hungering for glory as something better than riches, and content with it.\\n\\nOver these parts of the programme Ben-Hur sped with rapid eyes. At last he came to the announcement of the race. He read it slowly. Attending lovers of the heroic sports were assured they would certainly be gratified by an Orestean struggle unparalleled in Antioch. The city offered the spectacle in honor of the consul. One hundred thousand sestertii and a crown of laurel were the prizes. Then followed the particulars. The entries were six in all--fours only permitted; and, to further interest in the performance, the competitors would be turned into the course together. Each four then received description.\\n\\n\\\"I. A four of Lysippus the Corinthian--two grays, a bay, and a black; entered at Alexandria last year, and again at Corinth, where they were winners. Lysippus, driver. Color, yellow.\\n\\n\\\"II. A four of Messala of Rome--two white, two black; victors of the Circensian as exhibited in the Circus Maximus last year. Messala, driver. Colors, scarlet and gold.\\n\\n\\\"III. A four of Cleanthes the Athenian--three gray, one bay; winners at the Isthmian last year. Cleanthes, driver. Color, green.\\n\\n\\\"IV. A four of Dicaeus the Byzantine--two black, one gray, one bay; winners this year at Byzantium. Dicaeus, driver. Color, black.\\n\\n\\\"V. A four of Admetus the Sidonian--all grays. Thrice entered at Caesarea, and thrice victors. Admetus, driver. Color, blue.\\n\\n\\\"VI. A four of Ilderim, sheik of the Desert. All bays; first race. Ben-Hur, a Jew, driver. Color, white.\\\"\\n\\nBEN-HUR, A JEW, DRIVER!\\n\\nWhy that name instead of Arrius?\\n\\nBen-Hur raised his eyes to Ilderim. He had found the cause of the Arab's outcry. Both rushed to the same conclusion.\\n\\nThe hand was the hand of Messala!\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\nEvening was hardly come upon Antioch, when the Omphalus, nearly in the centre of the city, became a troubled fountain from which in every direction, but chiefly down to the Nymphaeum and east and west along the Colonnade of Herod, flowed currents of people, for the time given up to Bacchus and Apollo.\\n\\nFor such indulgence anything more fitting cannot be imagined than the great roofed streets, which were literally miles on miles of porticos wrought of marble, polished to the last degree of finish, and all gifts to the voluptuous city by princes careless of expenditure where, as in this instance, they thought they were eternizing themselves. Darkness was not permitted anywhere; and the singing, the laughter, the shouting, were incessant, and in compound like the roar of waters dashing through hollow grots, confused by a multitude of echoes.\\n\\nThe many nationalities represented, though they might have amazed a stranger, were not peculiar to Antioch. Of the various missions of the great empire, one seems to have been the fusion of men and the introduction of strangers to each other; accordingly, whole peoples rose up and went at pleasure, taking with them their costumes, customs, speech, and gods; and where they chose, they stopped, engaged in business, built houses, erected altars, and were what they had been at home.\\n\\nThere was a peculiarity, however, which could not have failed the notice of a looker-on this night in Antioch. Nearly everybody wore the colors of one or other of the charioteers announced for the morrow's race. Sometimes it was in form of a scarf, sometimes a badge; often a ribbon or a feather. Whatever the form, it signified merely the wearer's partiality; thus, green published a friend of Cleanthes the Athenian, and black an adherent of the Byzantine. This was according to a custom, old probably as the day of the race of Orestes--a custom, by the way, worthy of study as a marvel of history, illustrative of the absurd yet appalling extremities to which men frequently suffer their follies to drag them.\\n\\nThe observer abroad on this occasion, once attracted to the wearing of colors, would have very shortly decided that there were three in predominance--green, white, and the mixed scarlet and gold.\\n\\nBut let us from the streets to the palace on the island.\\n\\nThe five great chandeliers in the saloon are freshly lighted. The assemblage is much the same as that already noticed in connection with the place. The divan has its corps of sleepers and burden of garments, and the tables yet resound with the rattle and clash of dice. Yet the greater part of the company are not doing anything. They walk about, or yawn tremendously, or pause as they pass each other to exchange idle nothings. Will the weather be fair to-morrow? Are the preparations for the games complete? Do the laws of the Circus in Antioch differ from the laws of the Circus in Rome? Truth is, the young fellows are suffering from ennui. Their heavy work is done; that is, we would find their tablets, could we look at them, covered with memoranda of wagers--wagers on every contest; on the running, the wrestling, the boxing; on everything but the chariot-race.\\n\\nAnd why not on that?\\n\\nGood reader, they cannot find anybody who will hazard so much as a denarius with them against Messala.\\n\\nThere are no colors in the saloon but his.\\n\\nNo one thinks of his defeat.\\n\\nWhy, they say, is he not perfect in his training? Did he not graduate from an imperial lanista? Were not his horses winners at the Circensian in the Circus Maximus? And then--ah, yes! he is a Roman!\\n\\nIn a corner, at ease on the divan, Messala himself may be seen. Around him, sitting or standing, are his courtierly admirers, plying him with questions. There is, of course, but one topic.\\n\\nEnter Drusus and Cecilius.\\n\\n\\\"Ah!\\\" cries the young prince, throwing himself on the divan at Messala's feet, \\\"Ah, by Bacchus, I am tired!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Whither away?\\\" asks Messala.\\n\\n\\\"Up the street; up to the Omphalus, and beyond--who shall say how far? Rivers of people; never so many in the city before. They say we will see the whole world at the Circus to-morrow.\\\"\\n\\nMessala laughed scornfully.\\n\\n\\\"The idiots! Perpol! They never beheld a Circensian with Caesar for editor. But, my Drusus, what found you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nothing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"O--ah! You forget,\\\" said Cecilius.\\n\\n\\\"What?\\\" asked Drusus.\\n\\n\\\"The procession of whites.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mirabile!\\\" cried Drusus, half rising. \\\"We met a faction of whites, and they had a banner. But--ha, ha, ha!\\\"\\n\\nHe fell back indolently.\\n\\n\\\"Cruel Drusus--not to go on,\\\" said Messala.\\n\\n\\\"Scum of the desert were they, my Messala, and garbage-eaters from the Jacob's Temple in Jerusalem. What had I to do with them!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nay,\\\" said Cecilius, \\\"Drusus is afraid of a laugh, but I am not, my Messala.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Speak thou, then.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, we stopped the faction, and--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Offered them a wager,\\\" said Drusus, relenting, and taking the word from the shadow's mouth. \\\"And--ha, ha, ha!--one fellow with not enough skin on his face to make a worm for a carp stepped forth, and--ha, ha, ha!--said yes. I drew my tablets. 'Who is your man?' I asked. 'Ben-Hur, the Jew,' said he. Then I: 'What shall it be? How much?' He answered, 'A--a--' Excuse me, Messala. By Jove's thunder, I cannot go on for laughter! Ha, ha, ha!\\\"\\n\\nThe listeners leaned forward.\\n\\nMessala looked to Cecilius.\\n\\n\\\"A shekel,\\\" said the latter.\\n\\n\\\"A shekel! A shekel!\\\"\\n\\nA burst of scornful laughter ran fast upon the repetition.\\n\\n\\\"And what did Drusus?\\\" asked Messala.\\n\\nAn outcry over about the door just then occasioned a rush to that quarter; and, as the noise there continued, and grew louder, even Cecilius betook himself off, pausing only to say, \\\"The noble Drusus, my Messala, put up his tablets and--lost the shekel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A white! A white!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let him come!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This way, this way!\\\"\\n\\nThese and like exclamations filled the saloon, to the stoppage of other speech. The dice-players quit their games; the sleepers awoke, rubbed their eyes, drew their tablets, and hurried to the common centre.\\n\\n\\\"I offer you--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And I--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I--\\\"\\n\\nThe person so warmly received was the respectable Jew, Ben-Hur's fellow-voyager from Cyprus. He entered grave, quiet, observant. His robe was spotlessly white; so was the cloth of his turban. Bowing and smiling at the welcome, he moved slowly towards the central table. Arrived there, he drew his robe about him in a stately manner, took seat, and waved his hand. The gleam of a jewel on a finger helped him not a little to the silence which ensued.\\n\\n\\\"Romans--most noble Romans--I salute you!\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Easy, by Jupiter! Who is he?\\\" asked Drusus.\\n\\n\\\"A dog of Israel--Sanballat by name--purveyor for the army; residence, Rome; vastly rich; grown so as a contractor of furnishments which he never furnishes. He spins mischiefs, nevertheless, finer than spiders spin their webs. Come--by the girdle of Venus! let us catch him!\\\"\\n\\nMessala arose as he spoke, and, with Drusus, joined the mass crowded about the purveyor.\\n\\n\\\"It came to me on the street,\\\" said that person, producing his tablets, and opening them on the table with an impressive air of business, \\\"that there was great discomfort in the palace because offers on Messala were going without takers. The gods, you know, must have sacrifices; and here am I. You see my color; let us to the matter. Odds first, amounts next. What will you give me?\\\"\\n\\nThe audacity seemed to stun his hearers.\\n\\n\\\"Haste!\\\" he said. \\\"I have an engagement with the consul.\\\"\\n\\nThe spur was effective.\\n\\n\\\"Two to one,\\\" cried half a dozen in a voice.\\n\\n\\\"What!\\\" exclaimed the purveyor, astonished. \\\"Only two to one, and yours a Roman!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Take three, then.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Three say you--only three--and mine but a dog of a Jew! Give me four.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Four it is,\\\" said a boy, stung by the taunt.\\n\\n\\\"Five--give me five,\\\" cried the purveyor, instantly.\\n\\nA profound stillness fell upon the assemblage.\\n\\n\\\"The consul--your master and mine--is waiting for me.\\\"\\n\\nThe inaction became awkward to the many.\\n\\n\\\"Give me five--for the honor of Rome, five.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Five let it be,\\\" said one in answer.\\n\\nThere was a sharp cheer--a commotion--and Messala himself appeared.\\n\\n\\\"Five let it be,\\\" he said.\\n\\nAnd Sanballat smiled, and made ready to write.\\n\\n\\\"If Caesar die to-morrow,\\\" he said, \\\"Rome will not be all bereft. There is at least one other with spirit to take his place. Give me six.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Six be it,\\\" answered Messala.\\n\\nThere was another shout louder than the first.\\n\\n\\\"Six be it,\\\" repeated Messala. \\\"Six to one--the difference between a Roman and a Jew. And, having found it, now, O redemptor of the flesh of swine, let us on. The amount--and quickly. The consul may send for thee, and I will then be bereft.\\\"\\n\\nSanballat took the laugh against him coolly, and wrote, and offered the writing to Messala.\\n\\n\\\"Read, read!\\\" everybody demanded.\\n\\nAnd Messala read:\\n\\n\\\"Mem.--Chariot-race. Messala of Rome, in wager with Sanballat, also of Rome, says he will beat Ben-Hur, the Jew. Amount of wager, twenty talents. Odds to Sanballat, six to one.\\n\\n\\\"Witnesses: SANBALLAT.\\\"\\n\\nThere was no noise, no motion. Each person seemed held in the pose the reading found him. Messala stared at the memorandum, while the eyes which had him in view opened wide, and stared at him. He felt the gaze, and thought rapidly. So lately he stood in the same place, and in the same way hectored the countrymen around him. They would remember it. If he refused to sign, his hero-ship was lost. And sign he could not; he was not worth one hundred talents, nor the fifth part of the sum. Suddenly his mind became a blank; he stood speechless; the color fled his face. An idea at last came to his relief.\\n\\n\\\"Thou Jew!\\\" he said, \\\"where hast thou twenty talents? Show me.\\\"\\n\\nSanballat's provoking smile deepened.\\n\\n\\\"There,\\\" he replied, offering Messala a paper.\\n\\n\\\"Read, read!\\\" arose all around.\\n\\nAgain Messala read:\\n\\n\\\"AT ANTIOCH, Tammuz 16th day.\\n\\n\\\"The bearer, Sanballat of Rome, hath now to his order with me fifty talents, coin of Caesar.\\n\\nSIMONIDES.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Fifty talents, fifty talents!\\\" echoed the throng, in amazement.\\n\\nThen Drusus came to the rescue.\\n\\n\\\"By Hercules!\\\" he shouted, \\\"the paper lies, and the Jew is a liar. Who but Caesar hath fifty talents at order? Down with the insolent white!\\\"\\n\\nThe cry was angry, and it was angrily repeated; yet Sanballat kept his seat, and his smile grew more exasperating the longer he waited. At length Messala spoke.\\n\\n\\\"Hush! One to one, my countrymen--one to one, for love of our ancient Roman name.\\\"\\n\\nThe timely action recovered him his ascendancy.\\n\\n\\\"O thou circumcised dog!\\\" he continued, to Sanballat, \\\"I gave thee six to one, did I not?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said the Jew, quietly.\\n\\n\\\"Well, give me now the fixing of the amount.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"With reserve, if the amount be trifling, have thy will,\\\" answered Sanballat.\\n\\n\\\"Write, then, five in place of twenty.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hast thou so much?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"By the mother of the gods, I will show you receipts.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nay, the word of so brave a Roman must pass. Only make the sum even--six make it, and I will write.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Write it so.\\\"\\n\\nAnd forthwith they exchanged writings.\\n\\nSanballat immediately arose and looked around him, a sneer in place of his smile. No man better than he knew those with whom he was dealing.\\n\\n\\\"Romans,\\\" he said, \\\"another wager, if you dare! Five talents against five talents that the white will win. I challenge you collectively.\\\"\\n\\nThey were again surprised.\\n\\n\\\"What!\\\" he cried, louder. \\\"Shall it be said in the Circus to-morrow that a dog of Israel went into the saloon of the palace full of Roman nobles--among them the scion of a Caesar--and laid five talents before them in challenge, and they had not the courage to take it up?\\\"\\n\\nThe sting was unendurable.\\n\\n\\\"Have done, O insolent!\\\" said Drusus, \\\"write the challenge, and leave it on the table; and to-morrow, if we find thou hast indeed so much money to put at such hopeless hazard, I, Drusus, promise it shall be taken.\\\"\\n\\nSanballat wrote again, and, rising, said, unmoved as ever, \\\"See, Drusus, I leave the offer with you. When it is signed, send it to me any time before the race begins. I will be found with the consul in a seat over the Porta Pompae. Peace to you; peace to all.\\\"\\n\\nHe bowed, and departed, careless of the shout of derision with which they pursued him out of the door.\\n\\nIn the night the story of the prodigious wager flew along the streets and over the city; and Ben-Hur, lying with his four, was told of it, and also that Messala's whole fortune was on the hazard.\\n\\nAnd he slept never so soundly.\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\nThe Circus at Antioch stood on the south bank of the river, nearly opposite the island, differing in no respect from the plan of such buildings in general.\\n\\nIn the purest sense, the games were a gift to the public; consequently, everybody was free to attend; and, vast as the holding capacity of the structure was, so fearful were the people, on this occasion, lest there should not be room for them, that, early the day before the opening of the exhibition, they took up all the vacant spaces in the vicinity, where their temporary shelter suggested an army in waiting.\\n\\nAt midnight the entrances were thrown wide, and the rabble, surging in, occupied the quarters assigned to them, from which nothing less than an earthquake or an army with spears could have dislodged them. They dozed the night away on the benches, and breakfasted there; and there the close of the exercises found them, patient and sight-hungry as in the beginning.\\n\\nThe better people, their seats secured, began moving towards the Circus about the first hour of the morning, the noble and very rich among them distinguished by litters and retinues of liveried servants.\\n\\nBy the second hour, the efflux from the city was a stream unbroken and innumerable.\\n\\nExactly as the gnomon of the official dial up in the citadel pointed the second hour half gone, the legion, in full panoply, and with all its standards on exhibit, descended from Mount Sulpius; and when the rear of the last cohort disappeared in the bridge, Antioch was literally abandoned--not that the Circus could hold the multitude, but that the multitude was gone out to it, nevertheless.\\n\\nA great concourse on the river shore witnessed the consul come over from the island in a barge of state. As the great man landed, and was received by the legion, the martial show for one brief moment transcended the attraction of the Circus.\\n\\nAt the third hour, the audience, if such it may be termed, was assembled; at last, a flourish of trumpets called for silence, and instantly the gaze of over a hundred thousand persons was directed towards a pile forming the eastern section of the building.\\n\\nThere was a basement first, broken in the middle by a broad arched passage, called the Porta Pompae, over which, on an elevated tribunal magnificently decorated with insignia and legionary standards, the consul sat in the place of honor. On both sides of the passage the basement was divided into stalls termed carceres, each protected in front by massive gates swung to statuesque pilasters. Over the stalls next was a cornice crowned by a low balustrade; back of which the seats arose in theatre arrangement, all occupied by a throng of dignitaries superbly attired. The pile extended the width of the Circus, and was flanked on both sides by towers which, besides helping the architects give grace to their work, served the velaria, or purple awnings, stretched between them so as to throw the whole quarter in a shade that became exceedingly grateful as the day advanced.\\n\\nThis structure, it is now thought, can be made useful in helping the reader to a sufficient understanding of the arrangement of the rest of the interior of the Circus. He has only to fancy himself seated on the tribunal with the consul, facing to the west, where everything is under his eye.\\n\\nOn the right and left, if he will look, he will see the main entrances, very ample, and guarded by gates hinged to the towers.\\n\\nDirectly below him is the arena--a level plane of considerable extent, covered with fine white sand. There all the trials will take place except the running.\\n\\nLooking across this sanded arena westwardly still, there is a pedestal of marble supporting three low conical pillars of gray stone, much carven. Many an eye will hunt for those pillars before the day is done, for they are the first goal, and mark the beginning and end of the race-course. Behind the pedestal, leaving a passage-way and space for an altar, commences a wall ten or twelve feet in breadth and five or six in height, extending thence exactly two hundred yards, or one Olympic stadium. At the farther, or westward, extremity of the wall there is another pedestal, surmounted with pillars which mark the second goal.\\n\\nThe racers will enter the course on the right of the first goal, and keep the wall all the time to their left. The beginning and ending points of the contest lie, consequently, directly in front of the consul across the arena; and for that reason his seat was admittedly the most desirable in the Circus.\\n\\nNow if the reader, who is still supposed to be seated on the consular tribunal over the Porta Pompae, will look up from the ground arrangement of the interior, the first point to attract his notice will be the marking of the outer boundary-line of the course--that is, a plain-faced, solid wall, fifteen or twenty feet in height, with a balustrade on its cope, like that over the carceres, or stalls, in the east. This balcony, if followed round the course, will be found broken in three places to allow passages of exit and entrance, two in the north and one in the west; the latter very ornate, and called the Gate of Triumph, because, when all is over, the victors will pass out that way, crowned, and with triumphal escort and ceremonies.\\n\\nAt the west end the balcony encloses the course in the form of a half circle, and is made to uphold two great galleries.\\n\\nDirectly behind the balustrade on the coping of the balcony is the first seat, from which ascend the succeeding benches, each higher than the one in front of it; giving to view a spectacle of surpassing interest--the spectacle of a vast space ruddy and glistening with human faces, and rich with varicolored costumes.\\n\\nThe commonalty occupy quarters over in the west, beginning at the point of termination of an awning, stretched, it would seem, for the accommodation of the better classes exclusively.\\n\\nHaving thus the whole interior of the Circus under view at the moment of the sounding of the trumpets, let the reader next imagine the multitude seated and sunk to sudden silence, and motionless in its intensity of interest.\\n\\nOut of the Porta Pompae over in the east rises a sound mixed of voices and instruments harmonized. Presently, forth issues the chorus of the procession with which the celebration begins; the editor and civic authorities of the city, givers of the games, follow in robes and garlands; then the gods, some on platforms borne by men, others in great four-wheel carriages gorgeously decorated; next them, again, the contestants of the day, each in costume exactly as he will run, wrestle, leap, box, or drive.\\n\\nSlowly crossing the arena, the procession proceeds to make circuit of the course. The display is beautiful and imposing. Approval runs before it in a shout, as the water rises and swells in front of a boat in motion. If the dumb, figured gods make no sign of appreciation of the welcome, the editor and his associates are not so backward.\\n\\nThe reception of the athletes is even more demonstrative, for there is not a man in the assemblage who has not something in wager upon them, though but a mite or farthing. And it is noticeable, as the classes move by, that the favorites among them are speedily singled out: either their names are loudest in the uproar, or they are more profusely showered with wreaths and garlands tossed to them from the balcony.\\n\\nIf there is a question as to the popularity with the public of the several games, it is now put to rest. To the splendor of the chariots and the superexcellent beauty of the horses, the charioteers add the personality necessary to perfect the charm of their display. Their tunics, short, sleeveless, and of the finest woollen texture, are of the assigned colors. A horseman accompanies each one of them except Ben-Hur, who, for some reason--possibly distrust--has chosen to go alone; so, too, they are all helmeted but him. As they approach, the spectators stand upon the benches, and there is a sensible deepening of the clamor, in which a sharp listener may detect the shrill piping of women and children; at the same time, the things roseate flying from the balcony thicken into a storm, and, striking the men, drop into the chariot-beds, which are threatened with filling to the tops. Even the horses have a share in the ovation; nor may it be said they are less conscious than their masters of the honors they receive.\\n\\nVery soon, as with the other contestants, it is made apparent that some of the drivers are more in favor than others; and then the discovery follows that nearly every individual on the benches, women and children as well as men, wears a color, most frequently a ribbon upon the breast or in the hair: now it is green, now yellow, now blue; but, searching the great body carefully, it is manifest that there is a preponderance of white, and scarlet and gold.\\n\\nIn a modern assemblage called together as this one is, particularly where there are sums at hazard upon the race, a preference would be decided by the qualities or performance of the horses; here, however, nationality was the rule. If the Byzantine and Sidonian found small support, it was because their cities were scarcely represented on the benches. On their side, the Greeks, though very numerous, were divided between the Corinthian and the Athenian, leaving but a scant showing of green and yellow. Messala's scarlet and gold would have been but little better had not the citizens of Antioch, proverbially a race of courtiers, joined the Romans by adopting the color of their favorite. There were left then the country people, or Syrians, the Jews, and the Arabs; and they, from faith in the blood of the sheik's four, blent largely with hate of the Romans, whom they desired, above all things, to see beaten and humbled, mounted the white, making the most noisy, and probably the most numerous, faction of all.\\n\\nAs the charioteers move on in the circuit, the excitement increases; at the second goal, where, especially in the galleries, the white is the ruling color, the people exhaust their flowers and rive the air with screams.\\n\\n\\\"Messala! Messala!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ben-Hur! Ben-Hur!\\\"\\n\\nSuch are the cries.\\n\\nUpon the passage of the procession, the factionists take their seats and resume conversation.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, by Bacchus! was he not handsome?\\\" exclaims a woman, whose Romanism is betrayed by the colors flying in her hair.\\n\\n\\\"And how splendid his chariot!\\\" replies a neighbor, of the same proclivities. \\\"It is all ivory and gold. Jupiter grant he wins!\\\"\\n\\nThe notes on the bench behind them were entirely different.\\n\\n\\\"A hundred shekels on the Jew!\\\"\\n\\nThe voice is high and shrill.\\n\\n\\\"Nay, be thou not rash,\\\" whispers a moderating friend to the speaker. \\\"The children of Jacob are not much given to Gentile sports, which are too often accursed in the sight of the Lord.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"True, but saw you ever one more cool and assured? And what an arm he has!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And what horses!\\\" says a third.\\n\\n\\\"And for that,\\\" a fourth one adds, \\\"they say he has all the tricks of the Romans.\\\"\\n\\nA woman completes the eulogium:\\n\\n\\\"Yes, and he is even handsomer than the Roman.\\\"\\n\\nThus encouraged, the enthusiast shrieks again, \\\"A hundred shekels on the Jew!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thou fool!\\\" answers an Antiochian, from a bench well forward on the balcony. \\\"Knowest thou not there are fifty talents laid against him, six to one, on Messala? Put up thy shekels, lest Abraham rise and smite thee.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ha, ha! thou ass of Antioch! Cease thy bray. Knowest thou not it was Messala betting on himself?\\\"\\n\\nSuch the reply.\\n\\nAnd so ran the controversy, not always good-natured.\\n\\nWhen at length the march was ended and the Porta Pompae received back the procession, Ben-Hur knew he had his prayer.\\n\\nThe eyes of the East were upon his contest with Messala.\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\nAbout three o'clock, speaking in modern style, the program was concluded except the chariot-race. The editor, wisely considerate of the comfort of the people, chose that time for a recess. At once the vomitoria were thrown open, and all who could hastened to the portico outside where the restaurateurs had their quarters. Those who remained yawned, talked, gossiped, consulted their tablets, and, all distinctions else forgotten, merged into but two classes--the winners, who were happy, and the losers, who were grum and captious.\\n\\nNow, however, a third class of spectators, composed of citizens who desired only to witness the chariot-race, availed themselves of the recess to come in and take their reserved seats; by so doing they thought to attract the least attention and give the least offence. Among these were Simonides and his party, whose places were in the vicinity of the main entrance on the north side, opposite the consul.\\n\\nAs the four stout servants carried the merchant in his chair up the aisle, curiosity was much excited. Presently some one called his name. Those about caught it and passed it on along the benches to the west; and there was hurried climbing on seats to get sight of the man about whom common report had coined and put in circulation a romance so mixed of good fortune and bad that the like had never been known or heard of before.\\n\\nIlderim was also recognized and warmly greeted; but nobody knew Balthasar or the two women who followed him closely veiled.\\n\\nThe people made way for the party respectfully, and the ushers seated them in easy speaking distance of each other down by the balustrade overlooking the arena. In providence of comfort, they sat upon cushions and had stools for footrests.\\n\\nThe women were Iras and Esther.\\n\\nUpon being seated, the latter cast a frightened look over the Circus, and drew the veil closer about her face; while the Egyptian, letting her veil fall upon her shoulders, gave herself to view, and gazed at the scene with the seeming unconsciousness of being stared at, which, in a woman, is usually the result of long social habitude.\\n\\nThe new-comers generally were yet making their first examination of the great spectacle, beginning with the consul and his attendants, when some workmen ran in and commenced to stretch a chalked rope across the arena from balcony to balcony in front of the pillars of the first goal.\\n\\nAbout the same time, also, six men came in through the Porta Pompae and took post, one in front of each occupied stall; whereat there was a prolonged hum of voices in every quarter.\\n\\n\\\"See, see! The green goes to number four on the right; the Athenian is there.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And Messala--yes, he is in number two.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Corinthian--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Watch the white! See, he crosses over, he stops; number one it is--number one on the left.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, the black stops there, and the white at number two.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So it is.\\\"\\n\\nThese gate-keepers, it should be understood, were dressed in tunics colored like those of the competing charioteers; so, when they took their stations, everybody knew the particular stall in which his favorite was that moment waiting.\\n\\n\\\"Did you ever see Messala?\\\" the Egyptian asked Esther.\\n\\nThe Jewess shuddered as she answered no. If not her father's enemy, the Roman was Ben-Hur's.\\n\\n\\\"He is beautiful as Apollo.\\\"\\n\\nAs Iras spoke, her large eyes brightened and she shook her jeweled fan. Esther looked at her with the thought, \\\"Is he, then, so much handsomer than Ben-Hur?\\\" Next moment she heard Ilderim say to her father, \\\"Yes, his stall is number two on the left of the Porta Pompae;\\\" and, thinking it was of Ben-Hur he spoke, her eyes turned that way. Taking but the briefest glance at the wattled face of the gate, she drew the veil close and muttered a little prayer.\\n\\nPresently Sanballat came to the party.\\n\\n\\\"I am just from the stalls, O sheik,\\\" he said, bowing gravely to IIderim, who began combing his beard, while his eyes glittered with eager inquiry. \\\"The horses are in perfect condition.\\\"\\n\\nIlderim replied simply, \\\"If they are beaten, I pray it be by some other than Messala.\\\"\\n\\nTurning then to Simonides, Sanballat drew out a tablet, saying, \\\"I bring you also something of interest. I reported, you will remember, the wager concluded with Messala last night, and stated that I left another which, if taken, was to be delivered to me in writing to-day before the race began. Here it is.\\\"\\n\\nSimonides took the tablet and read the memorandum carefully.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" he said, \\\"their emissary came to ask me if you had so much money with me. Keep the tablet close. If you lose, you know where to come; if you win\\\"--his face knit hard--\\\"if you win--ah, friend, see to it! See the signers escape not; hold them to the last shekel. That is what they would with us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Trust me,\\\" replied the purveyor.\\n\\n\\\"Will you not sit with us?\\\" asked Simonides.\\n\\n\\\"You are very good,\\\" the other returned; \\\"but if I leave the consul, young Rome yonder will boil over. Peace to you; peace to all.\\\"\\n\\nAt length the recess came to an end.\\n\\nThe trumpeters blew a call at which the absentees rushed back to their places. At the same time, some attendants appeared in the arena, and, climbing upon the division wall, went to an entablature near the second goal at the west end, and placed upon it seven wooden balls; then returning to the first goal, upon an entablature there they set up seven other pieces of wood hewn to represent dolphins.\\n\\n\\\"What shall they do with the balls and fishes, O sheik?\\\" asked Balthasar.\\n\\n\\\"Hast thou never attended a race?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Never before; and hardly know I why I am here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, they are to keep the count. At the end of each round run thou shalt see one ball and one fish taken down.\\\"\\n\\nThe preparations were now complete, and presently a trumpeter in gaudy uniform arose by the editor, ready to blow the signal of commencement promptly at his order. Straightway the stir of the people and the hum of their conversation died away. Every face near-by, and every face in the lessening perspective, turned to the east, as all eyes settled upon the gates of the six stalls which shut in the competitors.\\n\\nThe unusual flush upon his face gave proof that even Simonides had caught the universal excitement. Ilderim pulled his beard fast and furious.\\n\\n\\\"Look now for the Roman,\\\" said the fair Egyptian to Esther, who did not hear her, for, with close-drawn veil and beating heart, she sat watching for Ben-Hur.\\n\\nThe structure containing the stalls, it should be observed, was in form of the segment of a circle, retired on the right so that its central point was projected forward, and midway the course, on the starting side of the first goal. Every stall, consequently, was equally distant from the starting-line or chalked rope above mentioned.\\n\\nThe trumpet sounded short and sharp; whereupon the starters, one for each chariot, leaped down from behind the pillars of the goal, ready to give assistance if any of the fours proved unmanageable.\\n\\nAgain the trumpet blew, and simultaneously the gate-keepers threw the stalls open.\\n\\nFirst appeared the mounted attendants of the charioteers, five in all, Ben-Hur having rejected the service. The chalked line was lowered to let them pass, then raised again. They were beautifully mounted, yet scarcely observed as they rode forward; for all the time the trampling of eager horses, and the voices of drivers scarcely less eager, were heard behind in the stalls, so that one might not look away an instant from the gaping doors.\\n\\nThe chalked line up again, the gate-keepers called their men; instantly the ushers on the balcony waved their hands, and shouted with all their strength, \\\"Down! down!\\\"\\n\\nAs well have whistled to stay a storm.\\n\\nForth from each stall, like missiles in a volley from so many great guns, rushed the six fours; and up the vast assemblage arose, electrified and irrepressible, and, leaping upon the benches, filled the Circus and the air above it with yells and screams. This was the time for which they had so patiently waited!--this the moment of supreme interest treasured up in talk and dreams since the proclamation of the games!\\n\\n\\\"He is come--there--look!\\\" cried Iras, pointing to Messala.\\n\\n\\\"I see him,\\\" answered Esther, looking at Ben-Hur.\\n\\nThe veil was withdrawn. For an instant the little Jewess was brave. An idea of the joy there is in doing an heroic deed under the eyes of a multitude came to her, and she understood ever after how, at such times, the souls of men, in the frenzy of performance, laugh at death or forget it utterly.\\n\\nThe competitors were now under view from nearly every part of the Circus, yet the race was not begun; they had first to make the chalked line successfully.\\n\\nThe line was stretched for the purpose of equalizing the start. If it were dashed upon, discomfiture of man and horses might be apprehended; on the other hand, to approach it timidly was to incur the hazard of being thrown behind in the beginning of the race; and that was certain forfeit of the great advantage always striven for--the position next the division wall on the inner line of the course.\\n\\nThis trial, its perils and consequences, the spectators knew thoroughly; and if the opinion of old Nestor, uttered that time he handed the reins to his son, were true--\\n\\n\\\"It is not strength, but art, obtained the prize, And to be swift is less than to be wise\\\"--\\n\\nall on the benches might well look for warning of the winner to be now given, justifying the interest with which they breathlessly watched for the result.\\n\\nThe arena swam in a dazzle of light; yet each driver looked first thing for the rope, then for the coveted inner line. So, all six aiming at the same point and speeding furiously, a collision seemed inevitable; nor that merely. What if the editor, at the last moment, dissatisfied with the start, should withhold the signal to drop the rope? Or if he should not give it in time?\\n\\nThe crossing was about two hundred and fifty feet in width. Quick the eye, steady the hand, unerring the judgment required. If now one look away! or his mind wander! or a rein slip! And what attraction in the ensemble of the thousands over the spreading balcony! Calculating upon the natural impulse to give one glance--just one--in sooth of curiosity or vanity, malice might be there with an artifice; while friendship and love, did they serve the same result, might be as deadly as malice.\\n\\nThe divine last touch in perfecting the beautiful is animation. Can we accept the saying, then these latter days, so tame in pastime and dull in sports, have scarcely anything to compare to the spectacle offered by the six contestants. Let the reader try to fancy it; let him first look down upon the arena, and see it glistening in its frame of dull-gray granite walls; let him then, in this perfect field, see the chariots, light of wheel, very graceful, and ornate as paint and burnishing can make them--Messala's rich with ivory and gold; let him see the drivers, erect and statuesque, undisturbed by the motion of the cars, their limbs naked, and fresh and ruddy with the healthful polish of the baths--in their right hands goads, suggestive of torture dreadful to the thought--in their left hands, held in careful separation, and high, that they may not interfere with view of the steeds, the reins passing taut from the fore ends of the carriage-poles; let him see the fours, chosen for beauty as well as speed; let him see them in magnificent action, their masters not more conscious of the situation and all that is asked and hoped from them--their heads tossing, nostrils in play, now distent, now contracted--limbs too dainty for the sand which they touch but to spurn--limbs slender, yet with impact crushing as hammers--every muscle of the rounded bodies instinct with glorious life, swelling, diminishing, justifying the world in taking from them its ultimate measure of force; finally, along with chariots, drivers, horses, let the reader see the accompanying shadows fly; and, with such distinctness as the picture comes, he may share the satisfaction and deeper pleasure of those to whom it was a thrilling fact, not a feeble fancy. Every age has its plenty of sorrows; Heaven help where there are no pleasures!\\n\\nThe competitors having started each on the shortest line for the position next the wall, yielding would be like giving up the race; and who dared yield? It is not in common nature to change a purpose in mid-career; and the cries of encouragement from the balcony were indistinguishable and indescribable: a roar which had the same effect upon all the drivers.\\n\\nThe fours neared the rope together. Then the trumpeter by the editor's side blew a signal vigorously. Twenty feet away it was not heard. Seeing the action, however, the judges dropped the rope, and not an instant too soon, for the hoof of one of Messala's horses struck it as it fell. Nothing daunted, the Roman shook out his long lash, loosed the reins, leaned forward, and, with a triumphant shout, took the wall.\\n\\n\\\"Jove with us! Jove with us!\\\" yelled all the Roman faction, in a frenzy of delight.\\n\\nAs Messala turned in, the bronze lion's head at the end of his axle caught the fore-leg of the Athenian's right-hand trace-mate, flinging the brute over against its yoke-fellow. Both staggered, struggled, and lost their headway. The ushers had their will at least in part. The thousands held their breath with horror; only up where the consul sat was there shouting.\\n\\n\\\"Jove with us!\\\" screamed Drusus, frantically.\\n\\n\\\"He wins! Jove with us!\\\" answered his associates, seeing Messala speed on.\\n\\nTablet in hand, Sanballat turned to them; a crash from the course below stopped his speech, and he could not but look that way.\\n\\nMessala having passed, the Corinthian was the only contestant on the Athenian's right, and to that side the latter tried to turn his broken four; and then; as ill-fortune would have it, the wheel of the Byzantine, who was next on the left, struck the tail-piece of his chariot, knocking his feet from under him. There was a crash, a scream of rage and fear, and the unfortunate Cleanthes fell under the hoofs of his own steeds: a terrible sight, against which Esther covered her eyes.\\n\\nOn swept the Corinthian, on the Byzantine, on the Sidonian.\\n\\nSanballat looked for Ben-Hur, and turned again to Drusus and his coterie.\\n\\n\\\"A hundred sestertii on the Jew!\\\" he cried.\\n\\n\\\"Taken!\\\" answered Drusus.\\n\\n\\\"Another hundred on the Jew!\\\" shouted Sanballat.\\n\\nNobody appeared to hear him. He called again; the situation below was too absorbing, and they were too busy shouting, \\\"Messala! Messala! Jove with us!\\\"\\n\\nWhen the Jewess ventured to look again, a party of workmen were removing the horses and broken car; another party were taking off the man himself; and every bench upon which there was a Greek was vocal with execrations and prayers for vengeance. Suddenly she dropped her hands; Ben-Hur, unhurt, was to the front, coursing freely forward along with the Roman! Behind them, in a group, followed the Sidonian, the Corinthian, and the Byzantine.\\n\\nThe race was on; the souls of the racers were in it; over them bent the myriads.\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\nWhen the dash for position began, Ben-Hur, as we have seen, was on the extreme left of the six. For a moment, like the others, he was half blinded by the light in the arena; yet he managed to catch sight of his antagonists and divine their purpose. At Messala, who was more than an antagonist to him, he gave one searching look. The air of passionless hauteur characteristic of the fine patrician face was there as of old, and so was the Italian beauty, which the helmet rather increased; but more--it may have been a jealous fancy, or the effect of the brassy shadow in which the features were at the moment cast, still the Israelite thought he saw the soul of the man as through a glass, darkly: cruel, cunning, desperate; not so excited as determined--a soul in a tension of watchfulness and fierce resolve.\\n\\nIn a time not longer than was required to turn to his four again, Ben-Hur felt his own resolution harden to a like temper. At whatever cost, at all hazards, he would humble this enemy! Prize, friends, wagers, honor--everything that can be thought of as a possible interest in the race was lost in the one deliberate purpose. Regard for life even should not hold him back. Yet there was no passion, on his part; no blinding rush of heated blood from heart to brain, and back again; no impulse to fling himself upon Fortune: he did not believe in Fortune; far otherwise. He had his plan, and, confiding in himself, he settled to the task never more observant, never more capable. The air about him seemed aglow with a renewed and perfect transparency.\\n\\nWhen not half-way across the arena, he saw that Messala's rush would, if there was no collision, and the rope fell, give him the wall; that the rope would fall, he ceased as soon to doubt; and, further, it came to him, a sudden flash-like insight, that Messala knew it was to be let drop at the last moment (prearrangement with the editor could safely reach that point in the contest); and it suggested, what more Roman-like than for the official to lend himself to a countryman who, besides being so popular, had also so much at stake? There could be no other accounting for the confidence with which Messala pushed his four forward the instant his competitors were prudentially checking their fours in front of the obstruction--no other except madness.\\n\\nIt is one thing to see a necessity and another to act upon it. Ben-Hur yielded the wall for the time.\\n\\nThe rope fell, and all the fours but his sprang into the course under urgency of voice and lash. He drew head to the right, and, with all the speed of his Arabs, darted across the trails of his opponents, the angle of movement being such as to lose the least time and gain the greatest possible advance. So, while the spectators were shivering at the Athenian's mishap, and the Sidonian, Byzantine, and Corinthian were striving, with such skill as they possessed, to avoid involvement in the ruin, Ben-Hur swept around and took the course neck and neck with Messala, though on the outside. The marvellous skill shown in making the change thus from the extreme left across to the right without appreciable loss did not fail the sharp eyes upon the benches; the Circus seemed to rock and rock again with prolonged applause. Then Esther clasped her hands in glad surprise; then Sanballat, smiling, offered his hundred sestertii a second time without a taker; and then the Romans began to doubt, thinking Messala might have found an equal, if not a master, and that in an Israelite!\\n\\nAnd now, racing together side by side, a narrow interval between them, the two neared the second goal.\\n\\nThe pedestal of the three pillars there, viewed from the west, was a stone wall in the form of a half-circle, around which the course and opposite balcony were bent in exact parallelism. Making this turn was considered in all respects the most telling test of a charioteer; it was, in fact, the very feat in which Orastes failed. As an involuntary admission of interest on the part of the spectators, a hush fell over all the Circus, so that for the first time in the race the rattle and clang of the cars plunging after the tugging steeds were distinctly heard. Then, it would seem, Messala observed Ben-Hur, and recognized him; and at once the audacity of the man flamed out in an astonishing manner.\\n\\n\\\"Down Eros, up Mars!\\\" he shouted, whirling his lash with practised hand--\\\"Down Eros, up Mars!\\\" he repeated, and caught the well-doing Arabs of Ben-Hur a cut the like of which they had never known.\\n\\nThe blow was seen in every quarter, and the amazement was universal. The silence deepened; up on the benches behind the consul the boldest held his breath, waiting for the outcome. Only a moment thus: then, involuntarily, down from the balcony, as thunder falls, burst the indignant cry of the people.\\n\\nThe four sprang forward affrighted. No hand had ever been laid upon them except in love; they had been nurtured ever so tenderly; and as they grew, their confidence in man became a lesson to men beautiful to see. What should such dainty natures do under such indignity but leap as from death?\\n\\nForward they sprang as with one impulse, and forward leaped the car. Past question, every experience is serviceable to us. Where got Ben-Hur the large hand and mighty grip which helped him now so well? Where but from the oar with which so long he fought the sea? And what was this spring of the floor under his feet to the dizzy eccentric lurch with which in the old time the trembling ship yielded to the beat of staggering billows, drunk with their power? So he kept his place, and gave the four free rein, and called to them in soothing voice, trying merely to guide them round the dangerous turn; and before the fever of the people began to abate, he had back the mastery. Nor that only: on approaching the first goal, he was again side by side with Messala, bearing with him the sympathy and admiration of every one not a Roman. So clearly was the feeling shown, so vigorous its manifestation, that Messala, with all his boldness, felt it unsafe to trifle further.\\n\\nAs the cars whirled round the goal, Esther caught sight of Ben-Hur's face--a little pale, a little higher raised, otherwise calm, even placid.\\n\\nImmediately a man climbed on the entablature at the west end of the division wall, and took down one of the conical wooden balls. A dolphin on the east entablature was taken down at the same time.\\n\\nIn like manner, the second ball and second dolphin disappeared.\",\"timestamp\":1640148095,\"title\":\"Malluch!
