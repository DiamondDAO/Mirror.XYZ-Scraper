The amount of CRV received by a given pool (gauge) is based on the gauge weight, which is a function of how much veCRV has voted for that gauge (pool).\\n\\nAs such, projects have two options to increase liquidity via liquidity mining, option 1 via their native token, option 2 via veCRV votes.\\n\\n**Receiving bribes**\\n\\nFor the purpose of incentivizing veCRV votes, we created [bribe.crv.finance](http://bribe.crv.finance/), this allows projects to provide incentives for veCRV votes (thus increasing CRV rewards / this same system can be used to incentivize DAO votes).\\n\\nIf you have veCRV, you can vote every 10 days via [dao.curve.fi/gaugeweight](https://dao.curve.fi/gaugeweight). On the dashboard of [bribe.crv.finance](http://bribe.crv.finance/) you will see any upcoming bribes, these will show you an estimate of how much rewards you will receive if you vote for the given pool.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*LYr8l4vdW0A8IY9u9cIWVQ.png)\\n\\nThe estimate is based on voting 100% of your veCRV for the pool, this however is not required, you can split your vote however you prefer. So you could split your vote 33% SPELL (MIM), 33% FTM (fantom-fusdt), 33% CREAM (ib \\\\~ Iron Bank)\\n\\nIf you voted in this week, at week reset (Thursday UTC), you can claim your share of the rewards. Once you have voted for a given pool, you will keep receiving the rewards every week, you do not have to revote every 10 days. So if this week I voted for fantom-fusdt pool, then next week I can claim my share of FTM rewards, as well as the following week, ad infinitum as long as rewards are available.\\n\\n*   Vote once, claim weekly, no need to revote\\n*   Split up votes in any %, no need to vote 100%\\n\\n**Bribing veCRV**\\n\\nIf you are a project wanting to incentivize liquidity, you can easily add incentives to a gauge.\\n\\nSimply click `ADD A REWARD`\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*iMnyYY5FDAb3OCFDBUwV_g.png)\\n\\nFind the gauge/pool you want to incentivize, `Choose Pool`\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*F8jWudSKzPxmD5dh-hGMxA.png)\\n\\nPaste in the reward token address in the first input field, and the amount of reward tokens on offer in the second input field and select `Submit`\\n\\nThis will create a transaction for `add_reward_amount`\\n\\nAlternatively, you can do so directly via the contract [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7893bbb46613d7a4fbcc31dab4c9b823ffee1026#writeContract)\\n\\n**Contract definitions**\\n\\nAddress: `0x7893bbb46613d7a4FbcC31Dab4C9b823FfeE1026`\\n\\n`active_period(address gauge, address reward_token)` : The current active claim period (always previous week starting Thursday UTC) for a given `gauge` and `token`\\n\\n`claimable(address user, address gauge, address reward_token)` : The amount of tokens a veCRV voter has claimable\\n\\n`claim(address user, address gauge, address reward_token)` : Claims the `claimable` rewards for a given user.\\n\\n`add_reward_amount(address gauge, address reward_token, uint amount)` : Adds the given `amount` of `reward_token` as rewards for a given `gauge`.
