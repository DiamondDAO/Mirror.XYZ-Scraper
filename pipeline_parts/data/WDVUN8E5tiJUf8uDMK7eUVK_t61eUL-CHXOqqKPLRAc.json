"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"War does pay the newspaper in the long run. The daily newspaper lives on commotion, crime, lawlessness in general.  If people no longer enjoyed reading about violence and bloodshed half their occupation, and that the most profitable half would be gone.  It is the interest of the newspaper to keep alive the savage in human nature; and war affords the readiest means of doing this.  You can't do much to increase the number of gruesome murders and loathsome assaults, beyond giving all possible advertisement to them when they do occur.  But you can preach war, and cover yourself with glory, as a patriot, at the same time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I wonder how many of my ideals will be left to me,\\\" sighed Joan. \\\"I always used to regard the Press as the modern pulpit.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The old pulpit became an evil, the moment it obtained unlimited power,\\\" answered Mrs. Denton.  \\\"It originated persecution and inflamed men's passions against one another.  It, too, preached war for its own ends, taught superstition, and punished thought as a crime.  The Press of to-day is stepping into the shoes of the medieval priest.  It aims at establishing the worst kind of tyranny:  the tyranny over men's minds.  They pretend to fight among themselves, but it's rapidly becoming a close corporation. The Institute of Journalists will soon be followed by the Union of Newspaper Proprietors and the few independent journals will be squeezed out.  Already we have German shareholders on English papers; and English capital is interested in the St. Petersburg Press.  It will one day have its International Pope and its school of cosmopolitan cardinals.\\\"\\n\\nJoan laughed.  \\\"I can see Carleton rather fancying himself in a tiara,\\\" she said.  \\\"I must tell Phillips what you say.  He's out for a fight with him.  Government by Parliament or Government by Press is going to be his war cry.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good man,\\\" said Mrs. Denton.  \\\"I'm quite serious.  You tell him from me that the next revolution has got to be against the Press. And it will be the stiffest fight Democracy has ever had.\\\"\\n\\nThe old lady had tired herself.  Joan undertook the mission.  She thought she would rather enjoy it, and Mrs. Denton promised to let her have full instructions.  She would write to her friends in Paris and prepare them for Joan's coming.\\n\\nJoan remembered Folk, the artist she had met at Flossie's party, who had promised to walk with her on the terrace at St. Germain, and tell her more about her mother.  She looked up his address on her return home, and wrote to him, giving him the name of the hotel in the Rue de Grenelle where Mrs. Denton had arranged that she should stay.  She found a note from him awaiting her when she arrived there.  He thought she would like to be quiet after her journey.  He would call round in the morning.  He had presumed on the privilege of age to send her some lilies.  They had been her mother's favourite flower.  \\\"Monsieur Folk, the great artist,\\\" had brought them himself, and placed them in her dressing-room, so Madame informed her.\\n\\nIt was one of the half-dozen old hotels still left in Paris, and was built round a garden famous for its mighty mulberry tree.  She breakfasted underneath it, and was reading there when Folk appeared before her, smiling and with his hat in his hand.  He excused himself for intruding upon her so soon, thinking from what she had written him that her first morning might be his only chance.  He evidently considered her remembrance of him a feather in his cap.\\n\\n\\\"We old fellows feel a little sadly, at times, how unimportant we are,\\\" he explained.  \\\"We are grateful when Youth throws us a smile.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You told me my coming would take you back thirty-three years,\\\" Joan reminded him.  \\\"It makes us about the same age.  I shall treat you as just a young man.\\\"\\n\\nHe laughed.  \\\"Don't be surprised,\\\" he said, \\\"if I make a mistake occasionally and call you Lena.\\\"\\n\\nJoan had no appointment till the afternoon.  They drove out to St. Germain, and had dejeuner at a small restaurant opposite the Chateau; and afterwards they strolled on to the terrace.\\n\\n\\\"What was my mother doing in Paris?\\\" asked Joan,\\n\\n\\\"She was studying for the stage,\\\" he answered.  \\\"Paris was the only school in those days.  I was at Julien's studio.  We acted together for some charity.  I had always been fond of it.  An American manager who was present offered us both an engagement, and I thought it would be a change and that I could combine the two arts.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And it was here that you proposed to her,\\\" said Joan.\\n\\n\\\"Just by that tree that leans forward,\\\" he answered, pointing with his cane a little way ahead.  \\\"I thought that in America I'd get another chance.  I might have if your father hadn't come along.  I wonder if he remembers me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did you ever see her again, after her marriage?\\\" asked Joan.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" he answered.  \\\"We used to write to one another until she gave it up.  She had got into the habit of looking upon me as a harmless sort of thing to confide in and ask advice of--which she never took.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Forgive me,\\\" he said.  \\\"You must remember that I am still her lover.\\\"  They had reached the tree that leant a little forward beyond its fellows, and he had halted and turned so that he was facing her.  \\\"Did she and your father get on together.  Was she happy?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't think she was happy,\\\" answered Joan.  \\\"She was at first. As a child, I can remember her singing and laughing about the house, and she liked always to have people about her.  Until her illness came.  It changed her very much.  But my father was gentleness itself, to the end.\\\"\\n\\nThey had resumed their stroll.  It seemed to her that he looked at her once or twice a little oddly without speaking.  \\\"What caused your mother's illness?\\\" he asked, abruptly.\\n\\nThe question troubled her.  It struck her with a pang of self- reproach that she had always been indifferent to her mother's illness, regarding it as more or less imaginary.  \\\"It was mental rather than physical, I think,\\\" she answered.  \\\"I never knew what brought it about.\\\"\\n\\nAgain he looked at her with that odd, inquisitive expression.  \\\"She never got over it?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, there were times,\\\" answered Joan, \\\"when she was more like her old self again.  But I don't think she ever quite got over it. Unless it was towards the end,\\\" she added.  \\\"They told me she seemed much better for a little while before she died.  I was away at Cambridge at the time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Poor dear lady,\\\" he said, \\\"all those years!  And poor Jack Allway.\\\"  He seemed to be talking to himself.  Suddenly he turned to her.  \\\"How is the dear fellow?\\\" he asked.\\n\\nAgain the question troubled her.  She had not seen her father since that week-end, nearly six months ago, when she had ran down to see him because she wanted something from him.  \\\"He felt my mother's death very deeply,\\\" she answered.  \\\"But he's well enough in health.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Remember me to him,\\\" he said.  \\\"And tell him I thank him for all those years of love and gentleness.  I don't think he will be offended.\\\"\\n\\nHe drove her back to Paris, and she promised to come and see him in his studio and let him introduce her to his artist friends.\\n\\n\\\"I shall try to win you over, I warn you,\\\" he said.  \\\"Politics will never reform the world.  They appeal only to men's passions and hatreds.  They divide us.  It is Art that is going to civilize mankind; broaden his sympathies.  Art speaks to him the common language of his loves, his dreams, reveals to him the universal kinship.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Denton's friends called upon her, and most of them invited her to their houses.  A few were politicians, senators or ministers. Others were bankers, heads of business houses, literary men and women.  There were also a few quiet folk with names that were historical.  They all thought that war between France and England would be a world disaster, but were not very hopeful of averting it.  She learnt that Carleton was in Berlin trying to secure possession of a well-known German daily that happened at the moment to be in low water.  He was working for an alliance between Germany and England.  In France, the Royalists had come to an understanding with the Clericals, and both were evidently making ready to throw in their lot with the war-mongers, hoping that out of the troubled waters the fish would come their way.  Of course everything depended on the people.  If the people only knew it!  But they didn't.  They stood about in puzzled flocks, like sheep, wondering which way the newspaper dog was going to hound them.  They took her to the great music halls.  Every allusion to war was greeted with rapturous applause.  The Marseillaise was demanded and encored till the orchestra rebelled from sheer exhaustion.  Joan's patience was sorely tested.  She had to listen with impassive face to coarse jests and brutal gibes directed against England and everything English; to sit unmoved while the vast audience rocked with laughter at senseless caricatures of supposed English soldiers whose knees always gave way at the sight of a French uniform.  Even in the eyes of her courteous hosts, Joan's quick glance would occasionally detect a curious glint.  The fools!  Had they never heard of Waterloo and Trafalgar?  Even if their memories might be excused for forgetting Crecy and Poictiers and the campaigns of Marlborough.  One evening--it had been a particularly trying one for Joan--there stepped upon the stage a wooden-looking man in a kilt with bagpipes under his arm.  How he had got himself into the programme Joan could not understand.  Managerial watchfulness must have gone to sleep for once.  He played Scotch melodies, and the Parisians liked them, and when he had finished they called him back.  Joan and her friends occupied a box close to the stage.  The wooden-looking Scot glanced up at her, and their eyes met.  And as the applause died down there rose the first low warning strains of the Pibroch.  Joan sat up in her chair and her lips parted.  The savage music quickened.  It shrilled and skrealed.  The blood came surging through her veins.\\n\\nAnd suddenly something lying hidden there leaped to life within her brain.  A mad desire surged hold of her to rise and shout defiance at those three thousand pairs of hostile eyes confronting her.  She clutched at the arms of her chair and so kept her seat.  The pibroch ended with its wild sad notes of wailing, and slowly the mist cleared from her eyes, and the stage was empty.  A strange hush had fallen on the house.\\n\\nShe was not aware that her hostess had been watching her.  She was a sweet-faced, white-haired lady.  She touched Joan lightly on the hand.  \\\"That's the trouble,\\\" she whispered.  \\\"It's in our blood.\\\"\\n\\nCould we ever hope to eradicate it?  Was not the survival of this fighting instinct proof that war was still needful to us?  In the sculpture-room of an exhibition she came upon a painted statue of Bellona.  Its grotesqueness shocked her at first sight, the red streaming hair, the wild eyes filled with fury, the wide open mouth--one could almost hear it screaming--the white uplifted arms with outstretched hands!  Appalling!  Terrible!  And yet, as she gazed at it, gradually the thing grew curiously real to her.  She seemed to hear the gathering of the chariots, the neighing of the horses, the hurrying of many feet, the sound of an armouring multitude, the shouting, and the braying of the trumpets.\\n\\nThese cold, thin-lipped calculators, arguing that \\\"War doesn't pay\\\"; those lank-haired cosmopolitans, preaching their \\\"International,\\\" as if the only business of mankind were wages! War still was the stern school where men learnt virtue, duty, forgetfulness of self, faithfulness unto death.\\n\\nThis particular war, of course, must be stopped:  if it were not already too late.  It would be a war for markets; for spheres of commercial influence; a sordid war that would degrade the people. War, the supreme test of a nation's worth, must be reserved for great ideals.  Besides, she wanted to down Carleton.\\n\\nOne of the women on her list, and the one to whom Mrs. Denton appeared to attach chief importance, a Madame de Barante, disappointed Joan.  She seemed to have so few opinions of her own. She had buried her young husband during the Franco-Prussian war. He had been a soldier.  And she had remained unmarried.  She was still beautiful.\\n\\n\\\"I do not think we women have the right to discuss war,\\\" she confided to Joan in her gentle, high-bred voice.  \\\"I suppose you think that out of date.  I should have thought so myself forty years ago.  We talk of 'giving' our sons and lovers, as if they were ours to give.  It makes me a little angry when I hear pampered women speak like that.  It is the men who have to suffer and die. It is for them to decide.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But perhaps I can arrange a meeting for you with a friend,\\\" she added, \\\"who will be better able to help you, if he is in Paris.  I will let you know.\\\"\\n\\nShe told Joan what she remembered herself of 1870.  She had turned her country house into a hospital and had seen a good deal of the fighting.\\n\\n\\\"It would not do to tell the truth, or we should have our children growing up to hate war,\\\" she concluded.\\n\\nShe was as good as her word, and sent Joan round a message the next morning to come and see her in the afternoon.  Joan was introduced to a Monsieur de Chaumont.  He was a soldierly-looking gentleman, with a grey moustache, and a deep scar across his face.\\n\\n\\\"Hanged if I can see how we are going to get out of it,\\\" he answered Joan cheerfully.  \\\"The moment there is any threat of war, it becomes a point of honour with every nation to do nothing to avoid it.  I remember my old duelling days.  The quarrel may have been about the silliest trifle imaginable.  A single word would have explained the whole thing away.  But to utter it would have stamped one as a coward.  This Egyptian Tra-la-la!  It isn't worth the bones of a single grenadier, as our friends across the Rhine would say.  But I expect, before it's settled, there will be men's bones sufficient, bleaching on the desert, to build another Pyramid.  It's so easily started:  that's the devil of it.  A mischievous boy can throw a lighted match into a powder magazine, and then it becomes every patriot's business to see that it isn't put out.  I hate war.  It accomplishes nothing, and leaves everything in a greater muddle than it was before.  But if the idea ever catches fire, I shall have to do all I can to fan the conflagration.  Unless I am prepared to be branded as a poltroon. Every professional soldier is supposed to welcome war.  Most of us do:  it's our opportunity.  There's some excuse for us.  But these men--Carleton and their lot:  I regard them as nothing better than the Menades of the Commune.  They care nothing if the whole of Europe blazes.  They cannot personally get harmed whatever happens. It's fun to them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But the people who can get harmed,\\\" argued Joan.  \\\"The men who will be dragged away from their work, from their business, used as 'cannon fodder.'\\\"\\n\\nHe shrugged his shoulders.  \\\"Oh, they are always eager enough for it, at first,\\\" he answered.  \\\"There is the excitement.  The curiosity.  You must remember that life is a monotonous affair to the great mass of the people.  There's the natural craving to escape from it; to court adventure.  They are not so enthusiastic about it after they have tasted it.  Modern warfare, they soon find, is about as dull a business as science ever invented.\\\"\\n\\nThere was only one hope that he could see:  and that was to switch the people's mind on to some other excitement.  His advices from London told him that a parliamentary crisis was pending.  Could not Mrs. Denton and her party do something to hasten it?  He, on his side, would consult with the Socialist leaders, who might have something to suggest.\\n\\nHe met Joan, radiant, a morning or two later.  The English Government had resigned and preparations for a general election were already on foot.\\n\\n\\\"And God has been good to us, also,\\\" he explained.\\n\\nA well-known artist had been found murdered in his bed and grave suspicion attached to his beautiful young wife.\",\"timestamp\":1639210833,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"I don't suppose it does:  not directly,\\\" answered Mrs. Denton. \\\"But it helps them to establish their position\"},\"digest\":\"rdFmaeKDhVohdxy2gokzbO5B4zYiSbqhNlj3p5CZ1WI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x12DAB7FFceEebeDFF34FE12b77b7a16997723371\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rbrb8FXUJ-8DaMy7A2STo7R4QRsPoI9J2ngmbSqKx-Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"f2PqIbq2il9RoMAnSYW8Q_Hth6lIXmwTcbsogYvNSzg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"1XnA-e1SGNYSVXyunDEC8UAJX60XPsB0pwt7uW0xS3QgwRDZobLIDDl-sQ8iQtmJVUku1k6B1B3Li02NM6uepg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc3566d6207118a882bea5a325047add971c7e2d5dcd829d2afc55411c451bd0d31afdfa313fb00bb90b139e8d0199c57f59a32ea9e9bbbb42ca5c43df97c2c551c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rbrb8FXUJ-8DaMy7A2STo7R4QRsPoI9J2ngmbSqKx-Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"f2PqIbq2il9RoMAnSYW8Q_Hth6lIXmwTcbsogYvNSzg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rdFmaeKDhVohdxy2gokzbO5B4zYiSbqhNlj3p5CZ1WI\"}"
