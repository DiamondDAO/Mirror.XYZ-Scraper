This requires that the terms used have their most long-standing and basic meaning insofar as possible.\\n\\nUnfortunately, it is difficult to use the term inequality in its non-ethical and relative sense (i.e., there being two or more things that are not equal, such as 2 versus 5 or 100ºC versus 50ºC) without risking straying into the more pejorative sense in which it is often used (such as the inequitable availability of opportunity between people of different race, region, religion, physical ability, gender or socio-economic status).[\\\\[1\\\\]](#_ftn1) It is however necessary to use inequality in its morally neutral sense if we are to be rational in our discourse and investigations.\\n\\nAs we have considered in respect of evolutionary theory, and as will be explored later regarding negative entropy and the use of energy by life-forms, we must not confuse the potential positive value of some *inequality* between things and life-forms with the likely negative value of some *inequity* between things and life-forms.\\n\\nInequality here is simply, in principle, a form of differentiation between any things allowing more freedom for useful work to potentially be done. Inequity is a form of unjust access to resources or any other form of unfair discrimination, i.e., discrimination that is not inherently justifiable and provides less freedom for useful work to potentially be done.\\n\\n![Peter Pink-Howitt, “Beautiful inequality”, algo-art, 2021 CE — created from ‘Solar System Painting’ NASA, 2008 CE, public domain](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D5Ij5lppU8D0Wsqmnq_iM.jpeg?height=1416&width=2258&&&&&size=medium)\\n\\n#### “Absolute freedom mocks at justice. Absolute justice denies freedom. To be fruitful, the two ideas must find their limits in each other.”\\n\\n(*Albert Camus*)[\\\\[2\\\\]](#_ftn2)\\n\\nExtremes of any ideology (e.g., liberalism) can become functionally indistinguishable from their purported enemies, since they can restrict the freedom to do useful things and exercise agency. Any overly politically correct discourse and approach therefore risks creating inequitable situations despite the protestation that it is being used to make things fairer. We must avoid extremes in any political or ethical position.\\n\\nAs proposed in this book and the ethical framework it offers, any particular ethical or political position is relative (and is in fact located on a circular spectrum). Only a suitable framework for any ethical positions can be more universal.\\n\\n## 3.5. Economics and the Use of Resources\\n\\n#### “…to feel much for others and little for ourselves, that to restrain our selfish, and to indulge our benevolent affections, constitutes the perfection of human nature; and can alone produce among mankind that harmony of sentiments and passions in which consists their whole grace and propriety.”\\n\\n(*Adam Smith*)\\\\[3\\\\]\\n\\nAs we saw in the discussion of the Pareto-optimal equilibria, it is not the case that reliance on each participant to optimise for their own self-interest is better for each and all. Even Pareto-optimal outcomes are unlikely to be the most beneficial in aggregate, since in most cases the starting position will be one where some agents have an extraordinarily inequitable level of control of existing resources.\\n\\nThere are many circumstances where a decision needs to be made whereby: (i) one being, or a small group of beings may be worse off; (ii) it would be vastly beneficial for the rest of the species and sometimes other life-forms; and (iii) it would also increase the aggregate total payoff available to all life-forms (I have called this ‘utility-optimal’).\\n\\nThe practical need for centralisation of power to achieve utility-optimal solutions — whether by communism, dictatorship or ‘representative democracies’ — and the problems that arise from such centralisation of power has meant that securing such utility optimal outcomes has not been easy to achieve. It has been achieved from time to time, e.g., in some benevolent dictatorships or in post-crisis periods when societies have seen the bigger picture and coordinated more collectively.\\n\\nAny centralised system of allocation of resources is expected to eventually fail given the risk of capture of the system by a small number of selfish individuals or of over-ideologically driven decision-making. This leads to resource decisions and laws that are neither Pareto-optimal nor utility-optimal. We must also allow for differences in wealth, as inequality allows for differentiation that has utility.\\n\\nMisuse of Adam Smith’s very limited use and notion of the ‘invisible hand’ (in an almost offhand reference) can lead to disastrous results in aggregate. It also appears that Smith did not say or mean what free-market proponents have claimed.\\n\\n#### “The general caricature of what Smith meant the phrase to mean is that if we just leave markets to be free then she’ll be right. Which is, of course, not something that Smith ever intimated let alone stated openly.”\\n\\n(*Tim Worstall*)\\\\[4\\\\]\\n\\nIn *The Wealth of Nations*, Smith gives examples of cases in which government intervention is considered appropriate and those in which it is not. In any event, discussion of economic theory has moved far beyond simplistic *laissez faire* approaches (e.g., MMT), though the current state of economic theory is very confused and confusing. This is likely to be because the state and central banks have taken an increasingly dominant role in the economy.\\n\\nWe cannot afford to be religious on any of these matters. As between a poorly managed centralised command economy and a freer market, there is likely to continue to be value in understanding the role of a decentralised approach to allow more optimal equilibria to take place (but only to the extent that they actually do).\\n\\nIt is, however, impossible to see how we can find optimal solutions for the use of resources if we allow a free-for-all by the strongest or most aggressive — e.g., on matters of deforestation, energy production, pollution, wildlife protection and the destruction of natural habitats and the local economies surrounding them.\\n\\nIn addition, the ‘invisible hand’ today appears to have given way to a coordinated grab; the dominant force no longer appears to be an unintentional emergent force (if it ever was). The economic and financial system looks more like it is shaped by a coordinated effort by a few powerful entities and individuals to maintain and strengthen their control over various resources and domains — against the interests of the many.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*ITkOSTsUffsWAxBXzSxN1g.png)\\n\\n#### “Wealth was the power to set things and people in motion; and in America, therefore, wealth came to be frankly regarded as the breath of God, the divine spirit immanent in man. God was the supreme Boss, the universal Employer.”\\n\\n(*Olaf Stapledon*)\\\\[5\\\\]\\n\\nIt is notable that the Global Financial Crisis, and more importantly the response to it by the political establishment and central banks, has coincided with a rapid acceleration of wealth inequality particularly in the USA.\\n\\nThis looks like astonishing coincidence, staggering ineptitude or, more likely, a finely orchestrated plan — especially given the ability, unlike in a free market, of a centrally controlled financial system to make decisions that could instead be used to benefit a greater number of people, and all in aggregate.[\\\\[6\\\\]](#_ftn6)\\n\\n![ ‘America Will Struggle After Coronavirus. These Charts Show Why’, www.nytimes.com, David Leonhardt & Yaryna Serkez, April 10 2020 CE](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\\\*YAwVyaITRqoC_MCXBMX-NQ.png?&&&&size=medium)\\n\\nThe distribution of wealth[\\\\[7\\\\]](#_ftn7) is increasingly suboptimal. It may even be tending towards disequilibrium for the very wealthy that currently benefit the most — as the risks of societal and economic breakdown continue to rise from such blatantly unequal and inefficient allocation of resources.\\n\\n#### “Bill Gates — the second richest person in the world with a current net worth of $108.8 billion, according to Forbes — says his extreme wealth is not fair.”\\n\\n[\\\\[8\\\\]](#_ftn8)\\n\\nThe politicisation of the economy and financialisation of politics increases the potentially nefarious role of central banks in working with investment houses, commercial banks and financial intermediaries. The overall lack of transparency and accountability pollutes the political and financial systems of the Western world.\\n\\nIt is best (healthier, too) to try to remain open to the possibility that much of this is a manifestation of long-standing and worsening structural defects as much as any intentional conspiracy. Greed for money and power driven by self-centredness must, however, be the expected prime drivers of such behaviour.\\n\\n#### “The problem is that we all too often have socialism for the rich and rugged free enterprise capitalism for the poor.”\\n\\n(*Martin Luther King, Jr.*)[\\\\[9\\\\]](#_ftn9)\\n\\nGiven the risks of poor judgement, corruption and capture of the system by the few that have greater resources, we need economic decision-making processes that better benefits the many. We have seen blockchain unlock the benefits of a decentralised approach to value and finance. It is time for economics and politics to face the same fate.\\n\\nWe should therefore look to synthesise the benefits of a decentralised structure for decision-making with the benefits of a significant degree of aggregated power to effect such decisions (e.g., purchasing power, economic power, legal power). This does not require that each person has the same wealth, but it would inevitably be redistributive in its effects.\\n\\nLet us look at the current distribution of wealth in the USA on a simplified basis to see what might be credibly said about this ‘winner-takes-all’ society. The US population is approximately 330 million, of whom approximately 240 million are statistically relevant for wealth purposes. Estimates of current distributions have the top 1% owning 15 times or more as much as the bottom 50%, and the same as the bottom 90%.\\n\\n#### “We find that the top 0.1% share of wealth increased from 7% to 14% from 1978 to 2016. While this rise is half as large as prior estimates, wealth is very concentrated: the top 1% holds nearly as much wealth as the bottom 90%.”\\n\\n[\\\\[10\\\\]](#_ftn10)\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*RWn12BEk0SD7coReMfm-VA.png)\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*3kUpNZYSza7yaGzyWa5AmA.png)\\n\\nBased on these 2016 figures, the top 0.01% appear to own somewhere around $7–8 trillion and the top 1% around $26 trillion. The bottom 90% own around $24 trillion.[\\\\[11\\\\]](#_ftn11)\\n\\nGiven central bank and government support of the wealthy and asset-owning classes, I would expect that since 2016 the situation has worsened for the bottom 90% and improved for the top 10%, 1% and 0.1%. Recent figures have total wealth closer to $100 trillion[\\\\[12\\\\]](#_ftn12) than the $75 trillion in the 2016 figures. Simply put, around 24,000 people in the USA own roughly the same in financial assets (wealth) as 72 million people — and this does not take income into account.\\n\\nIt is very difficult to see what benefit this environment has for most Americans. In addition, greater wealth spread amongst a wider group of participants would likely lead to greater economic activity than that which applies when wealth is so concentrated. When even the winner in a ‘winner-takes-all’ economy warns that it is broken and is failing to be equitable and useful, one should take note.\\n\\nThe current economic system and distribution of wealth does not provide a suitable backdrop to the implementation of an ethical framework that seeks to apportion value more wisely, efficiently and fairly between different life-forms and species.\\n\\nWhen there is such disproportionate allocation of resources, influence and power amongst beings of the same species, we should expect no wider step-change in allocations between different species. Despite the risks, in the absence of root-and-branch reform, we seem to be in need of a forest fire in our financial and political systems.\\n\\nIt is fundamentally important to note that what is being proposed in this book is not any form of equality of wealth. This would be unnatural and counter-productive (even if possible). In fact, wealth distribution appears to also have an entropic nature (see chapter 9) and is in equilibrium when distributed with diverse holders in an unequal distribution (i.e. the maximum number of possible different microstates).[\\\\[13\\\\]](#_ftn13)\\n\\nThe axioms in the ethical framework proposed make clear that inequality in its technical sense is not unethical; unfortunately, the term has been hijacked to some extent and is often confused with inequity. In fact, inequalities — differences between things, as represented by evolution and the use of free energy (entropy) — are a requirement of life and useful action or work.\\n\\n#### “the Forbes 400 paints a far different picture. Between the first computation in 1982 and today, the wealth of the 400 increased 29-fold — from $93 billion to $2.7 trillion — while many millions of hardworking citizens remained stuck on an economic treadmill. During this period, the tsunami of wealth didn’t trickle down. It surged upward.”\\n\\n(*Warren Buffet*)[\\\\[14\\\\]](#_ftn14)\\n\\nThe ethical framework will therefore value economic systems with the greatest amount of freedom of action that is consistent with the axioms. Inequity is not consistent, since it gives rise to reduced freedom of action, including the potential for useful work. The remedy for dealing with inequity will likely be in the following forms:\\n\\n● Wealth generation and ownership will be constrained such that it does not create dynastic levels of wealth that transfer significant wealth further than two generations.[\\\\[15\\\\]](#_ftn15)\\n\\n● Public taxation (particularly capital gains tax) and spending will be aimed at redressing inequity whilst maintaining the ability for useful economic inequality.\\n\\n● Income support may be required to meet the challenges of the erosion of the labour base by technology.\\n\\n● Constraints on the maximum inequality that is consistent with useful freedom of action by all of the population will be modelled and enforced.\\n\\n#### “A dynastic system where you can pass vast wealth along to your children is not good for anyone; the next generation doesn’t end up with the same incentive to work hard and contribute to the economy.”\\n\\n(*Bill Gates*)\\n\\nSuch an approach would represent a very significant change to the current structure and so would be resisted fiercely by many of those people currently holding the most wealth and power. It may also face resistance from many who are not at the top of the financial food-chain on the basis that it represents a major cultural shift away from the role and importance of the ‘family’. We should therefore expect adverse media. Nevertheless, even some of the winners in the current system have reached a similar conclusion about its deficiencies.\\n\\n#### “Gates said it’s one of the reasons he co-founded the Giving Pledge with Warren Buffett (who has also said the rich should pay higher taxes). The Giving Pledge invites billionaires to commit to giving away the majority of their money to charity, and both the Gates and Buffett have made the pledge.”\\n\\n[\\\\[16\\\\]](#_ftn16)\\n\\nIn the absence of a post-scarcity world, it is inevitable that humans will need to tackle these issues soon if we are to reach a sufficiently efficient and successful high level of economic and social success. This higher level will support greater opportunities for a much larger number of people that are currently not able to add as much value as they otherwise would.\\n\\nThe reason why I am not advocating whole-sale equality is simply that some people are better able to use resources than others. Our ability collectively to undertake useful freedom of action requires some of the resources to be concentrated in those people that can achieve useful and interesting outcomes with them. However, we need to be more honest and realistic about the levels of concentration, i.e., where that switches from being useful to being a drawback on aggregate freedom of action.\\n\\nBy way of experiment, we should model to what extent different distributions of wealth are likely to increase or decrease the freedom of action available to all participants. At one end of the spectrum, we could have a society of 1 million people where all disposable income and wealth is concentrated in one person’s hands. It should be immediately obvious that, even if that person is Jeff Bezos, such a distribution makes it very unlikely that the rest of the population will be able to undertake potentially useful and unusual behaviour. In this case, nearly the entire freedom of action in economic terms is collapsed into one life-form and the system reduces the aggregate freedom of action (since all extension of that attribute is limited to one member of the population). This is a dangerous disequilibrium and mirrors the one that currently applies between humans and other life-forms.\\n\\nAt the other end of the spectrum, the wealth could be shared equally between the 1 million people. In this case it should be obvious that the ability of an individual or a small group within that population to do anything extraordinarily unusual and useful diminishes, since that freedom of action would likely require them to obtain a larger share of the resources (e.g., to research and then build new energy technologies).\\n\\n#### “Winner-take-all markets tend to discourage collaboration and cooperation. The winners have incentive to keep their knowledge and new data to themselves. Patents and copyright are liberally used to suppress any serious competition. Skilled workers are snapped up the second they leave education, and have powerful inducements to stay working for the winners. The result is a prisoner’s dilemma-style situation. Although collaboration may be best for everyone, each individual organization benefits from being selfish. As a result, no one collaborates, they just compete.”\\n\\n[\\\\[17\\\\]](#_ftn17)\\n\\nAs with the ethical validity of any relative situation, no one is able to assume a privileged universal position and determine alone, godlike, what the most ethically useful distribution of resources is. It requires collective decision-making that is based on objective foundations, stripped of dogma and based on evidence. It requires that the people with the most resources do not control the means of communication, since otherwise the information made available will inevitably be biased to reinforce their control of resources, even if that is not optimal (in fact, especially when it is not).\\n\\n#### “Warren believes in the true role of philanthropy: To take risks where governments can’t and to be a true catalyst for change.”\\n\\n(*Bill and Melinda Gates*)[\\\\[18\\\\]](#_ftn18)\\n\\nWe require a higher degree of honesty and humility about the effectiveness of central versus distributed resource allocation and management. Our ability to explore other planets and solar systems and enhance our capabilities with artificial intelligence is predicated on reaching a higher level of ethics and economic efficiency. The consequences of failure become ever more extreme as our technological capabilities grow.\\n\\nDecentralised secure information channels and decision-making processes are required that avoid single points of failure and the capture of economic, political and legal structures. Existing structures will undermine the ability to determine and execute utility-optimal decisions. The proposals for operating an ethical framework include some such scalable and secure solutions taken from innovations in blockchain communities. We must also consider the use of suitable power ratios to ensure wealth and income is never too concentrated.\\n\\n*Is there a maximum and minimum amount of resources that should be shared that is more consistent with supporting freedom of action and diversity? And if so, how should it be distributed? Should it be based on redistributive measures using a power law?**[\\\\[19\\\\]](#_ftn19)***\\n\\nOur current financial and economic system is very unbalanced but not nearly as much as our current treatment of the biosphere and particularly all non-human life-forms living in it.\\n\\n#### “Why were they prepared to go to extraordinary lengths to rescue the financial system, but completely fail to grasp what needs to be done to rescue our life support systems? Is it because the climate, unlike the banks, doesn’t fund their campaigns for re-election? Is it because oceans and rainforests can’t lobby them? Are we to face the prospect of systemic environmental collapse because averting it doesn’t appeal to their immediate self-interest?”\\n\\n(*[George Monbiot](https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot/status/1469237887627583493)*)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\ncontinued in:\\n\\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x6e2fBc139e37b43f4F29cC10B7BeDe36587f7306/8CL0xV-T45WhLFrY6xbgKskmCCOv1WtIf9tVn8pypRg](https://mirror.xyz/0x6e2fBc139e37b43f4F29cC10B7BeDe36587f7306/8CL0xV-T45WhLFrY6xbgKskmCCOv1WtIf9tVn8pypRg)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n[\\\\[1\\\\]](#_ftnref1) In many cases this may simply be the randomness of the family you are born into or brought up in, but in some cases it also means ‘class’, ‘caste’ or similar social stratifications.\\n\\n[\\\\[2\\\\]](#_ftnref2) Albert Camus, *The Rebel*, 1951 CE, translated by Anthony Bower.
