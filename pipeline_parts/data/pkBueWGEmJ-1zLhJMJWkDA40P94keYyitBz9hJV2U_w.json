"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The concept of fungibility comes from the equal sign in mathematics. The essence is a kind of mathematical thinking. The meaning of the equal sign in mathematics is to tell everyone what is not important. An apple is equal to another apple, which means that the color and size of the apple are both not important. This is also the essence of fungibility, which is to tell everyone that some information is not important.\\n\\n \\n\\nPeople have become accustomed to mathematics and forget that no two leaves in this world are the same. Mathematics shapes our consciousness in concept. The mathematics is the underlying principle of computer science. There is also mathematics behind industrialized production, and industrial products have shaped our material world.\\n\\n \\n\\nEach note has a different serial number, but when we are in the context of consumption, the serial number is not important. Every note is the same. But in the field of ancient coin collection, the year of production of the paper money and coins matters. This is actually a kind of non-fungibility defined by numbers. Some things do not need to be numbered, people can naturally distinguish their differences, such as all natural creations. Fungibility is the result of industrial production, the rise of non-fungible tokens also represents the decline of the industrial age.\\n\\n \\n\\nThrough NFT, we make the same industrial manufactured products become unique in terms of numbers. This is a kind of artificially manufactured non-fungibility. Although at the physical level, every industrial product cannot be exactly the same, but from the perspective of information transmission, it is difficult for humans to obtain this information at low cost, so we must rely on numbers.\\n\\n \\n\\nIn some mathematics, such as matrix mathematics, the commutative law does not apply. A multiplied by b is not equal to b multiplied by a. This can be used to solve some problems in quantum mechanics. So in a subset of mathematics, how can matrix mathematics be used in algorithms? The breakthrough of the algorithm must be supported by the mathematics behind it.\",\"timestamp\":1641120162,\"title\":\"Capsule(15.5.2021) NFT and Mathematics, the Collapse of Industrial Civilization\"},\"digest\":\"5A4eihTSVsYsDSDYjCOobK5GGMP6POOYsqF-_TECQmg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xE828f8bE1a3CB994133936fB4D9A708a7D192462\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"30oV-kOFSC9lQBdHEarttZfxjliQz8okqoKZUNLBj88\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"oE3PBJa5icihwzV4Vo38ifbPXR099aDCDl_ixLAomho\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"5o9AW0PRwboO4PSLx5wmH-tJ1O5EuR2Es07bbqSwhP7-lsnILDb_rGjawXamy_XsP2Z7HY5GIlFQRoZHvFSshw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x31cd513577813d56dac188e35743ecb529db0e03e283593e4cc226acb4e7611a5a06f0e8d95703de997b6dc6c43ffc9841842d11590b5c80d29579b563e532581b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"30oV-kOFSC9lQBdHEarttZfxjliQz8okqoKZUNLBj88\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"oE3PBJa5icihwzV4Vo38ifbPXR099aDCDl_ixLAomho\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"5A4eihTSVsYsDSDYjCOobK5GGMP6POOYsqF-_TECQmg\"}"
