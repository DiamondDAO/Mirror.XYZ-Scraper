"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Open data in Web3 means we get to play with a large variety of interfaces for displaying information. While this means there is a lot of flexibility, it does introduce an extra step in the groundwork requirements for creating any kind of live discovery feed. Weâ€™ve decided to build a V1 feed into our Discord server for all Mirror events from our smart contracts, which can be further leveraged for our web interface in the future.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zxV6miW9j-39H63Lax1Ej.jpg?height=1142&width=2284)\\n\\nSo why Discord? On most platforms, it's fairly difficult to get both organic discovery and discussion across content, teams, and individuals. Discord provides a happy (albeit chaotic) medium to bridge this gap and it also has a strong third-party developer ecosystem around bots.\\n\\nWhile the basis of development is a feed, building this into a Discord bot will help supplement discovery and discussion within the community on a platform that already enforces a tight feedback loop between those two elements.\\n\\nThe development of the bot came in three parts:\\n\\n* provide a feed that covers all new writers, their project and content creation, as well as their funding or sales progress in activity channels.\\n  * the bot can sit in any Discord server and *push the events of a specified set of Mirror publications*.\\n* provide interactive commands for easily viewing *all* ongoing project raises/sales on Mirror\\n* provide commands that enable streamlined communication of feature requests and bugs, pushed *directly into our development backlog*\\n\\n## Activity Feeds\\n\\nWe've added event tracking to activity channels in our discord for live updates based on the following categories:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/j2okljkwzsJQwssrUgqzZ.jpg?height=1142&width=2284&&size=medium)\\n\\n1. **[#sign-ups:](https://discord.com/channels/821771133422272542/888094195108180078/890650527334023188)** A new creator has started or joined a publication on Mirror.\\n2. **[#new-entries:](https://discord.com/channels/821771133422272542/883857527899582475/890906411066884107)** A live feed of all entries published.\\n3. **[#crowdfund-updates:](https://discord.com/channels/821771133422272542/883479657830301716/890934211932979230)** someone has contributed to a crowdfund.\\n4. **[#edition-updates:](https://discord.com/channels/821771133422272542/883857355584974878/890856633121538108)** someone has bought an edition.\\n5. **[#milestones:](https://discord.com/channels/821771133422272542/883857477861539850/888759370895208509)** A creator has started a crowdfund raise or editions sale. Additionally, all crowdfund closes and editions sell-outs will get a shoutout on both Discord and [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mir_milestones) as well.\\n\\n### Registering Mirror-bot in your Discord\\n\\nWant to bring all of the above events from your publication to your own community server? You can now register any channel to track your ENS-specific events (as long as the bot has access)!\\n\\nAfter you invite Mirror-bot to your server, you can use the `/track register_ens` slash command in the channel you want events to feed into:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WGogDe9CUiZwC-orDjxX6.gif?height=125&width=935)\\n\\nFor now, **you can add up to five publications to your server,** any of which can be removed from tracking by using the `/track remove_ens` slash command.\\n\\nIf you're interested in this feature, please [DM me](https://twitter.com/andrewhong5297) and I'll give you the bot invite link and help get you set up!\\n\\n## Interactive Commands\\n\\nWe've leveraged Discord slash commands to bring more interactivity into other channels as well. Are you wondering what projects are currently raising a crowdfund or selling editions? Pull up a paginated table using either the `/table crowdfunds` or `/table editions` commands!\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g8fObWJh6nFDNXqgbcMWD.gif?height=340&width=682)\\n\\nIn case the activity feed gets too cluttered, this is a great way of catching up on the last few weeks of projects on Mirror.\\n\\n## Direct Feedback into Dev Pipeline\\n\\nMirror is a constantly growing product, with great ideas and suggestions flowing constantly in the chat. To make sure these ideas aren't lost, we have a `/feature notification` that pushes the idea directly into our product development backlog for prioritization in future sprints.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UGrhVeHowrtJBmc3LFFST.gif?height=125&width=935)\\n\\nOn the flip side, if you encounter any bugs then you can notify us and put them in the queue as well with the `/bug notification` command.\\n\\n## Discord Bots, Roll out!\\n\\nMirror-bot will continue to grow with the community, aiming to supplement the [mirror.xyz](http://mirror.xyz) experience for everyone. Come join us all in the [Mirror discord](https://discord.gg/txuCHcE8wV), and if you have any ideas for more bot capabilities then put your ideas down with `/feature` ðŸ˜‰\",\"timestamp\":1632491118,\"title\":\"Announcing Mirror-Bot, a Discord bot for Community Discovery and Discussion\",\"publication\":\"dev\"},\"digest\":\"G8EMAKtfWhwHlbeWHo3lT_7Y2oCspNUEJxJPz5NsoQc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2Ae8c972fB2E6c00ddED8986E2dc672ED190DA06\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uoiyp7mk7B8dThMhp1xZ8LMVBzjcimvRPpk2TFATkr8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eKrsF1ZwlaTBqymzSeGnpUtYZ4IRhZPhjIy9YN44IYE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"xcJYdGNfJTJIK4lefqthPeSePMKok4503VO1FZbRyPhe9qaN_LhQ6twgZFt_nxVIJ_2nvr0OjqEXFi2hSA7QUw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x420ac2f757852d971885d4d37991358cc97dbfa38fd4646a27424c1d014162d65537e9ea9fcc72612039b4229fb9fa410443797bb4523349f73a1e4966445bf11c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on ath.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uoiyp7mk7B8dThMhp1xZ8LMVBzjcimvRPpk2TFATkr8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eKrsF1ZwlaTBqymzSeGnpUtYZ4IRhZPhjIy9YN44IYE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"nb6ldFOJcpd7OIBCD3z76tKdZ3hglgw83pi16CNqIu8\"}"
