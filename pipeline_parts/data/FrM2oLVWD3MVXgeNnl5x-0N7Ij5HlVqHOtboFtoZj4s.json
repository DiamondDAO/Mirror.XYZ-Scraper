"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Punctuality is a very important when you communicate with others. It means the quality or habit of adhering to an appointed time. Just imagine this, if you fail to attend an important meeting, you may leave a bad impression on others. Others will be angry with you. Thus, one should always be punctual. This can show your consideration for others. Failure to be punctual is a sign of disrespect to others. Some people hate to wait for others, but they don’t mind being waited for. In this case, they are not respected by others. This kind of people always can find excuses for being late. Such as, stuck on the traffic jams, waking up too late. They never mean to come earlier. I think such behaviour is very selfish. Everybody should form the habit of being punctual. It’s the main element of good quality. Just remember don’t be late. \",\"timestamp\":1639035445,\"title\":\"Punctuality\"},\"digest\":\"yy-bumNFmDJR8OQfzdA2IM7lfpjlN4g9PKuP6iYqeYg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xC3196F2d96F54145a8cD435CCab7880aaB0660c4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nbMkT-t1_DTZ1gJJMAKW_Ol4qTDu4U1GpmDC0KRtG1w\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Qq6L67lKmIrXaivjYgsPiiN2KeS9-IomPNms7BpLr9c\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"RMNUSEoUCI9NKWLz---sXbTBh_YuXsv0FUjh2_poMClKmtjLJ6KMZwBnhTNK8nUWgmyWttpesYXN7TLa3ZLSkQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa83ca574053fa9d3151e8b198c2c1cabb70fc6bbfebd3a697c724cc02cdf89330ba3cd5dd8d256b18f2e86afe33095f968a5e98c89625a9e41f5ad729ae00c011c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nbMkT-t1_DTZ1gJJMAKW_Ol4qTDu4U1GpmDC0KRtG1w\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Qq6L67lKmIrXaivjYgsPiiN2KeS9-IomPNms7BpLr9c\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"yy-bumNFmDJR8OQfzdA2IM7lfpjlN4g9PKuP6iYqeYg\"}"
