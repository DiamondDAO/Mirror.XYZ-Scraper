"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"scheming, scheming, scheming, planned rags, and bottles, and scrap-iron, and more also. Sometimes it was a plan so much bigger that if they had kept it to themselves, like the darkey's cow, they would have \\\"all swole up and died.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sst!  Come here once.  Tell you sumpum.  Now don't you go and blab it out, now will you?  Hope to die?  Well . . . . Now, no kiddin'. Cross your heart?  Well . . . .  Ah, you will, too.  I know you. You go and tattle everything you hear . . . .  Well. . . .  Cheese it!  Here comes somebody.  Make out we're talkin' about sumpum else. Ah, he did, did he?  What for, I wonder?  (Say sumpum, can't ye?) Why 'nu' ye say sumpum when he was goin' by?  Now he'll suspicion sumpum 's up, and nose around till he . . . .  Aw, they ain't no use tellin' you anything . . . .  Well.  Put your head over so 's I can whisper.  Sure I am. . . .  Well, I could learn, couldn't I?  Now don't you tell a living soul, will you?  If anybody asts you, you tell 'em you don't know anything at all about it.  Say, why 'n't you come along?  I promised you the last time.  That's jist your mother callin' you.  Let on you don't hear her.  Aw, stay.  Aw, you don't either have to go.  Say.  Less you and me get up early, and go see the circus come in town, will you?  I will, if you will. All right.  Remember now.  Don't you tell anybody what I told you. You know.\\\"\\n\\nIf a fellow just only could run off with a circus! Wouldn't it be great?  No more splitting kindling and carrying in coal; no more: \\\"Hurry up, now, or you'll be late for school;\\\" no more poking along in a humdrum existence, never going any place or seeing anything, but the glad, free, untrammeled life, the life of a circus-boy, standing up on top of somebody's head (you could pretend he was your daddy.  Who'd ever know the difference?) and your leg stuck up like five minutes to six, and him standing on top of a horse - and the horse going around the ring, and the ring master cracking his whip - aw, say!  How about it?\\n\\nMaybe the show-people would take you even if you didn't have two joints to common folks' one, and hadn't had early advantages in the way of plenty of snakes to try the grease out of.  And then . . . and then. . . . Travel all around, and be in a new town every day! And see things!  The water-works, and Main Street, and the Soldiers' Monument, and the Second Presbyterian Church.  All the sights there are to see in strange places.  And then when the show came back to your own home-town next year, people would wonder whose was that slim and gracile figure in the green silk tights and spangled breech-clout that capered so nimbly on the bounding courser's back, that switched the natty switch and shrilly called out: \\\"Hep!  Hep!\\\" They'd screw up their eyes to look hard, and they'd say: \\\"Yes, sir. It is.  It's him.  It's Willie Bigelow.  Well, of all things!\\\"  And they'd clap their hands, and be so proud of you.  And they'd wonder how it was that they could have been so blind to your many merits when they had you with them.  They'd feel sorry that they ever said you were a \\\"regular little imp,\\\" if ever there was one, and that you had the Old Boy in you as big as a horse.  They'd feel ashamed of themselves, so they would.  And they'd come and apologize to you for the way they had acted, and you'd say: \\\"Oh, that's all right.  Forgive and forget.\\\"  And they'd miss you at home, too. Your daddy would wish he hadn't whaled you the way he did, just for nothing at all.  And your mother, too, she'd be sorry for the way she acted to you, tormenting the life and soul out of you, sending you on errands just when you got a man in the king row, and making you wash your feet in a bucket before you went to bed, instead of being satisfied to let you pump on them, as any reasonable mother would.  She'll think about that when you're gone.  It'll be lonesome then, with nobody to bang the doors, and upset the cream-pitcher on the clean table-cloth, and fall over backward in the rocking-chair and break a rocker off.  Your daddy will sigh and say:\\n\\n\\\"I wonder where Willie is to-night.  Poor boy, I sometimes fear I was too harsh with him.\\\"  And your mother will try to keep back her tears, but she can't, and first thing she knows she'll burst out crying, and . . .  and . . .  and old Maje will go around the house looking for you, and whining because he can't find his little playmate . . . . It will seem as if you were dead - dead to them, and . . . . Smf!  Smf!\\n\\n(Confound that orchestra leader anyhow!  How many times have I got to tell him that this is the music-cue for \\\"Where is My Wandering Boy To-night?\\\")\\n\\nWe were all going to get up early enough to see the show come in at the depot.  Very few of us did it.  Somehow we couldn't seem to wake up.  Here and there a hardy spirit compasses the feat.\\n\\nAll the town is asleep when this boy slips out of his front-gate and snicks the latch behind him softly.  It is very still, so still that though he is more than a mile away from the railroad he can hear Johnny Mara, the night yardmaster, bawl out: \\\"Run them three empties over on Number Four track!\\\" the short exhaust of the obedient pony-engine, and the succeeding crash of the cars as they bump against their fellows.  It is very still, scarey still.  The gas-lamp flaring and flickering among the green maples at the corner has a strange look to him.  His footfalls on the sidewalk sound so loud he takes the soft middle of the dusty road.  He hears some one pursuing him and his bosom contracts with fear, as he stands to see who it is.  Although he hardly knows the boy bound on the same errand as his, he takes him to his heart, as a chosen friend.  They are kin.\\n\\nOn the freight-house platform they find other boys.  Some of them have waited up all night so as not to miss it.  They are from across the tracks.  They have all the fun, those fellows do.  They can swear and chew tobacco, and play hookey from school and have a good time.  They get to go barefoot before anybody else, and nobody tells them it will thin their blood to go in swimming so much.  Yes, and they can fight, too.  They'd sooner fight than eat.  Our boys, conscious of inferiority, keep to themselves.  The boys from across the tracks show off all the bad words they can think of.  One of them has a mouth-harp which he plays upon, now and then opening his hands hollowed around the instrument.  Patsy Gubbins dances to the music, which is a thing even more reckless and daredevil than swearing.  Patsy's going with a \\\"troupe\\\" some day.  Or else, he's going to get a job firing on an engine.  He isn't right sure which he wants to do the most.\\n\\nNow and then a brakeman goes by swinging his lantern.  The boys would like to ask him what time it is, but for one thing they're too bashful.  Being a brakeman is almost as good as going with a \\\"troupe\\\" or a circus.  You get to go to places that way, too, Marysville, and Mechanicsburg, and Harrod's - that is, if you're on the local freight, and then you lay over in Cincinnati.  Some ways it's better than firing, and some ways it isn't so good.  And then there is another reason why they don't ask the brakeman what time it is.  He'd say it was \\\"forty-five\\\" or maybe \\\"fifty-three,\\\" and never tell what hour.\\n\\n\\\"Say!  Do you know it's cold?  You wouldn't think it would be so cold in the summer-time.\\\"\\n\\nThe maple-trees, from being formless blobs, insensibly begin to look like lace-work.  Presently the heavens and the earth are bathed in liquid blue that casts a spell so potent on the soul of him that sees it that he yearns for something he knows not what, except that it is utterly beyond him, as far beyond him as what he means to be will be from what he shall attain to.  One dreams of romance and renown, of all that should be and is not.  And as he dreams the birds awaken.  In the East there comes a greenish tinge.  Far up the track, there is a sullen roar, and then the hoarse diapason of an engine whistle.  The roar strengthens and strengthens.  It is the circus train.\\n\\nUnder the witchcraft of the dreaming blue, each boy had a firm and stubborn purpose.  Over and over again he rehearsed how he would go up to the man that runs the show, and say: \\\"Please, mister, can I go with you?\\\"  And the man would say, \\\"Yes.\\\"  (As easy as that.)  But the purpose wavered as he saw the roustabouts come tumbling out, all frowsy and unwashed, rubbing the sleep out of their eyes, cross and savage.  And the man whose word they jump to obey, he's kind of discouraging.  it's all business with him. The fellows may plead with their eyes; he never sees them.  If he does, he tells them where to get to out of that and how quick he wants it done, in language that makes the boldest efforts of the boys from across the tracks seem puny in comparison.  The lads divide into two parties.  One follows the buggy of the boss canvasman to Vandeman's lots where the stand is made.  They will witness the spectacle of the raising of the tents, but they will also be near the man that runs the show, and if all goes well it may be he will like your looks and saunter up to you and say: \\\"Well, bub, and how would you like to travel with us?\\\"  You don't know.  Things not half so strange as that have happened.  And if you were right there at the time . . . .\\n\\nThe other party lingers awhile looking up wistfully at the unresponsive windows of the sleeping-cars, behind which are the happy circus-actors.  Perhaps the show-boy that stands up on top of his daddy's head will look out.  If he should raise the window and smile at you, and get to talking with you maybe he would introduce you to his pa, and tell him that you would like to go with the show, and his pa would be a nice sort of a man, and he'd say: \\\"Why, yes.  I guess we can fix that all right.\\\"  And there you'd be.\\n\\nOr if it didn't come out like that, why, maybe the boy would be another \\\"Little Arthur, the Boy Circus-rider,\\\" like it told about in he Ladies' Repository.  It seems there was a man, and one day he went by where there was a circus, and in a quiet secluded, vine-clad nook only a few steps from the main tent, he heard somebody sigh, oh, so sadly and so pitifully!  Come to find out, it was Little Arthur, the Boy Circus-rider.  He had large sensitive violet eyes, and a wealth of clustering ringlets, and he was very, very unhappy.  So the man took from his pocket a Bible that he happened to have with him, and he read from it to Little Arthur, which cheered him up right away, because up to that moment he had only heard of the Bible.  (Think of that!)  And that night at the show, what do you s'pose?  Little Arthur fell off the horse and hurt himself.  And this man was at the show and he went back in the dressing-room, and held Little Arthur's hand.  And the clown was crying, and the actors were crying, for they all loved Little Arthur in their rude, untutored way.  And Little Arthur opened his large sensitive violet eyes, and saw the man, and said off the text that the man taught him that afternoon.\\n\\nAnd then he died.  It was a sad story, but it made you wish it had been you that happened to have a Bible in your pocket as you passed the secluded, vine-clad nook only a few paces from the main tent, and had heard Little Arthur sigh so pitifully.  It was those sensitive eyes we looked for in the sleeping-car windows, and all in vain.  I think I saw the wealth of clustering ringlets, or at least the makings of it.  I am almost positive I saw curl-papers as the curtain was drawn aside a moment.\\n\\nBut whether a boy stands gazing at the sleepers, or runs over to the lots, there is something pathetic about it, something almost terrible.  It is the death of an ideal.  I can't conceive of a boy coming down to the depot to see the circus train come in another time.  Hitherto, the show has been to him the ne plus ultra of romance.  It comes in the night from 'way off yonder; it goes in the night to 'way off yonder.  It is all splendor, all deeds of high emprise.  It stands to reason then, that the closer you get to it, the closer you get to pure romance.  And it isn't that way at all.\\n\\nWhat gravels a boy the most of all is to have to do the same old thing over and over again, day after day, week in, week out.  Once he has seen the circus come in, he cannot blind himself to the fact that everything is marked and numbered; that all is system, and that everything is done today exactly as it was done yesterday, and as it will be done tomorrow.\\n\\n\\\"What town is this?\\\" he hears a man inquire of another.\\n\\n\\\"Blest if I know.  What's the odds what town it is?\\\"\\n\\nDidn't know what town it was!  Didn't care!\\n\\nThe keen morning air, or something, makes a fellow mighty unromantic, too.  Perhaps it was the thin blue wood-smoke from the field-stoves, and the smell of the hot coffee and the victuals the waiters are carrying about, some to the tent where the bare tables are for the canvasmen, some to the table covered with a red and white table-cloth as befits performers.  These have no rosy cheeks.  Their lithe limbs are not richly decked with silken tights.  Insensibly the upper lip curls.  They're not so much. They're only folks.  That's all, just folks.\\n\\nBut when ideals die, great truths are born.  To such a boy at such a moment there comes the firm conviction which increasing years can only emphasize:  Home is but a poor prosaic place, but Home - Ah, my brother, think on this - Home is where Breakfast is.\\n\\n\\\"Hay! Wait for me, you fellows!  Hay!  Hold on a minute.  Well, ain't I a-comin' jis''s fast's ever I kin?  What's your rush?\\\"\\n\\nIt is the exceptional boy has this experience.  The normal one preserves the delicate bloom of romance, by never seeing the show until it makes its Grand Triumphal Entree in a Pageant of Unparalleled Magnificence far Surpassing the Pomp and Splendor of Oriental Potentates.\\n\\nThe hitching-posts are full of whinnering country horses, and people are in town you wouldn't think existed if you hadn't seen their pictures in Puck and Yudge, people from over by Muchinippi, and out Noodletoozy way, big, red-necked men with the long loping step that comes from walking on the plowed ground.  Following them are lanky women with their front teeth gone, and their figures bowed by drudgery, dragging wide-eyed children whose uncouth finery betrays the \\\"country jake,\\\" even if the freckles and the sun-bleached hair could keep the secret.  From the far-off fastnesses, where there are still log-cabins chinked with mud, they have ventured to see the show come into town, and when they have seen that, they will retire again beyond our ken.  How every sense is numbed and stunned by the magnificence and splendor of the painted and gilded wagons as they rumble past, the driver rolling and pitching in his seat, as he handles the ribbons of eight horses all at once!  The farmer's heart is filled with admiration of his craft, as much as the children's hearts are at the gaudy pictures.\\n\\nThe allegorical tableau-car solemnly waggles past, Europe, and Asia, and Africa, and Australia brilliant in grease-paint and gorgeous cheesecloth robes.  And can you guess who the fat lady is up on the very tip-top of all, on the tip-top where the wobble is the worst? Our own Columbia!  It must be fine to ride around that way all dressed up in a flag.  But a sourer lot of faces you never saw in your life.  No.  I am wrong.  For downright melancholy and despondency you must wait till the funny old clown comes along in his little bit of a buggy drawn by a little bit of a donkey.\\n\\n\\\"And, oh, looky! Here comes the elephants, just the same as in the joggerfy books.  And see the men walking beside them.  They come from the place the elephants do.  See, they have on the clothes they wear in that country.  Don't they look proud?  Who wouldn't be proud to get to walk with an elephant?  And if you ever do anything to an elephant to make him mad, he'll always remember it, and some day he'll get even with you.  One time there was a man, and he gave an elephant a chew of tobacco, and - O-o-ooh!  See that man in the cage with the lions!  Don't it just make the cold chills run over you?  I wouldn't be there for a million dollars, would you, ma?\\n\\n\\\"What they laughing at down the street?  Ma, make Lizzie get down; she's right in my way.  I don't want to see it pretty soon.  I want to see it naow!  Oh, ain't it funny?  See the old clowns playing on horns!  Ain't it too killing?  Aw, look at them ponies.  I woosht I had one.  Johnny Pym has got a goat he can hitch up.  What was that, pa?  What was that went 'OoOOoohm!'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Whoa, Nell, whoa there!  Steady, gal, steaday!  Ho, there!  Ho! Whoa -whoa-hup!  Whad dy y' about?  Fool horse.  Whoa . . . whoa so, gal, soo-o.  Lion, I guess, or a tagger, or sumpum or other.\\\"\\n\\nAnd talk about music.  You thought the band was grand.  You just wait. Don't you hear it down the street?  It'll be along in a minute now.\\n\\nThere it is.  That's the cally-ope.  That's what the show bills call: \\\"The Steam Car of the Muses.\\\" .  .  .  Mm-well, I don't know but it is just a leetle off the pitch, especially towards the end of a note, but you must remember that you can't haul a very big boiler on a wagon, and the whistles let out an awful lot of steam.  It's pretty hard to keep the pressure even.  But it's loud.  That's the main thing.  And the man that plays on it - no, not that fellow in the overalls with a wad of greasy waste in his hand.  He 's only the engineer.  I mean the artist, the man that plays on the keys.  Well, he knows what the people want.  He has his fingers on the public pulse.  Does he give them a Bach fugue, or Guillmant's \\\"Grand Choeur?\\\" 'Deed, he doesn't.  He goes right to the heart, with \\\"Patrick's Day in the Morning,\\\" and \\\"The Carnival of Venice,\\\" and \\\"Home, Sweet Home,\\\" and \\\"Oh, Where, Oh Where has my Little Dog Gone?\\\"  He knows his business.  A shade off the key, perhaps, but my! Ain't it grand?  So loud and nice!\\n\\n\\\"Well, that's all of it . . . . Why, child, I can't make it any longer than it is.\\n\\nWhat do you want me to drive round into the other street for? You've seen all there is to see.  Got all your trading done, mother?  Well, then I expect we'd better put for home.  Now, Eddy, I told you 'No' once, and that's the end of it.  Hush up now!  Look here, sir!  Do you want me to take and 'tend to you right before everybody?  Well, I will now, if I hear another whimper out o' ye.  Ck-ck-ck!  Git ep there, Nelly.\\\"\\n\\nSome day, when we get big, and have whole, whole lots of money we're going to the circus every time it comes to town, to the real circus, the one you have to pay to get into.  For if merely the street parade is so magnificent, what must the show itself be?\\n\\nHow people can sit at the table on circus day and stuff, and stuff the way they do is more than I can understand.  You'd think they hadn't any more chances to eat than they had to go to the show. And they can find more things to do before they get started!  And then, after the house is all locked up and everything, they've got to go back after a handkerchief!  What does anybody want with a handkerchief at a circus?\\n\\nIt's exasperating enough to have to choose between going in the afternoon and not going at all.  Why, sure, it's finer at night. Lots finer.  You know that kind of a light the peanut-roaster man has got down by the post-office.  Burns that kind of stuff they use to take out grease-spots.  Ye-ah.  Gasoline.  Well, at the circus at night, they don't have just one light like that, but bunches and bunches of them on the tentpoles.  No, silly!  Of course not.  Of course they don't set the tent afire.  But say!  What if they did, eh?  The place would be all full of people, laughing at the country jake that comes out to ride the trick-mule, and you'd happen to look up and see where the canvas was ju-u-ust beginning to blaze, and you'd jump up and holler: \\\"Fire!  Fire!\\\" as loud as ever you could because you saw it first, and you'd point to the place. Excitement?  Well, I guess yes.  The people would all run every which way, and fall all over themselves, and the women would squeal  - And do you know what I'd do?  Wouldn't just let myself down between the kind of bedslat benches, and drop to the ground, and lift up the canvas and there I'd be all safe.  And after I was all safe, then I'd go back and rescue folks.\\n\\nWe-ell, I s'pose I'd have to rescue a girl.  It seems they always do that.  But it would be nicer, I think, to rescue some real rich man.  He'd say: \\\"My noble preserver!  How can I sufficiently reward you?\\\" and take out his pocketbook.  And wouldn't say: \\\"Take back your proffered gold,\\\" and make like I was pushing it away, \\\"take back your proffered gold.  I but did my duty.\\\"  And then wouldn't forget all about it.  And one day, after I'd forgotten all about, it, the man would die, and will me a million dollars, or a thousand, I don't know.  Enough to make me rich.\\n\\nAnd say!  Wouldn't the animals get excited when they saw the show was afire?  They'd just roar and roar, and upset the cages, and maybe they'd get loose.  O-o-o-Oh!  How about that?  If there was a lion come at me I'd climb a tree.  What would you do?  Ah, your pa's shot-gun nothing!  Why, you crazy, that would only infuriate him the more.  What you want to do is to take an express rifle, like Doo Challoo did, and aim right for his heart.  An express rifle is what you send off and get, and they ship it to you by express.\\n\\nSo you see what a fellow misses by having to go to the show in the afternoon, like the girls and the a-b-abs.  The boys from across the tracks get to go at night.  They have all the fun.  When they go they don't have to poke along, and poke along, and keep hold of hands so as not to get lost. . . .  Aw, hurry up, can't you?  Don't you hear the band playing?  It'll be all over before we get there.\\n\\nBut finally the lots are reached, and there are the tents, with all kinds of flags snapping from the centerpoles and the guy-ropes. And there are the sideshows.  Alas!  You never thought of the sideshows when you asked if you could go.  And now it's too late. It must be fine in the side-shows.  I never got to go to one.  I didn't have the money.  But if the big, painted banners, bulging in and out, as the wind plays with them, are anything to go by, it must be something grand to see the Fat Lady, and the Circassian Beauty, whose frizzled head will just about fit a bushel basket, and the Armless Wonder.  They say he can take a pair of scissors with his toes and cut your picture out of paper just elegant.\\n\\nOh, and something else you miss by going in the afternoon.  At night you can sneak around at the back, and when nobody is looking you can just lift up the canvas and go right in for nothing . . . . Why, what's wrong about that?  Ah, you're too particular . . . .  And if the canvasman catches you, you can commence to cry and say you had only forty cents, and wanted to see the circus so bad, and he'll take it and let you in, and you can have ten cents, don't you see, to spend for lemonade, red lemonade, you understand; and peanuts, the littlest bags, and the \\\"on-riest\\\" peanuts that ever were.\\n\\nAs far as I can see, the animal part of the show is just the same as it always was.  The people that take you to the show always pretend to be interested in them, but it's my belief they stop and look only to tease you.  Away, 'way back in ancient times, there used to be a man that took the folks around and told them what was in each cage, and where it came from, and how much it cost, and what useful purpose it served in the wise economy of nature, and all about it.  That was before my time.  But I can recollect something they had that they don't have any more.  I can remember when Mr. Barnum first brought his show to our town.  It didn't take much teasing to get to go to that, because in those days Mr. Barnum was a \\\"biger man than old Grant.\\\"  \\\"The Life of P. T. Barnum, Written by Himself\\\" was on everybody's marble-topped centertable, just the same as \\\"The History of the Great Rebellion.\\\"  You show some elderly person from out of town the church across the street from the Astor House, and say: \\\"That's St. Paul's Chapel.  General Montgomery's monument is in the chancel window.  George Washington went to meeting there the day he was inaugurated president,\\\" and your friend will say: \\\"M-hm.\\\"  But you tell him that right across Broadway is where Barnum's Museum used to be, and he'll brighten right up and remember all about how Barnum strung a flag across to St. Paul's steeple and what a fuss the vestry of Trinity Parish made. That's something he knows about.  that's part of the history of our country.\\n\\nWell, when Mr. Barnum first came to our town, all around one tent were vans full of the very identical Moral Waxworks that we had read about, and had given up all hopes of ever seeing because New York was so far away.  There was the Dying Zouave.  Oh, that was a beauty!  The Advance Courier said that \\\"the crimson torrent of his heart's blood spouted in rhythmic jets as the tide of life ebbed silently away;\\\" but I guess by the time they got to our town they must have run all out of pokeberry juice, for the \\\"crimson torrent\\\" didn't spout at all.  But his bosom heaved every so often, and he rolled up his eyes something grand!  I liked it, but my mother said it was horrid.  That's the way with women.  They don't like anything that anybody else does.  There's no pleasing 'em.  And she thought the Drunkard's Family was \\\"kind o' low.\\\"  It wasn't either.  It was fine, and taught a great moral lesson.  I told her so, but she said it was low, just the same.  She thought the Temperance Family was nice, but it wasn't anywhere near as good as the Drunkard's Family. Why, let me tell you.  The Drunkard's Wife was in a ragged calico dress, and her eye was all black and blue, where he had hit her the week before.  And the Drunkard had hold of a black quart bottle, and his nose was all red, and he wore a plug hat that was even rustier and more caved in than Elder Drown's, if such a thing were possible.  And there was -  But I can't begin to tell you of all the fine things Mr. Barnum had that year, but never had again.\\n\\nAnother thing Mr. Barnum had that year that never appeared again. It may be that after that time the Funny Old Clown did crack a joke, but I never heard him.  The one that Mr. Barnum had got off the most comical thing you ever heard.  I'll never forget it the longest day I live.  Laugh?  Why, I nearly took a conniption over it.  It seems the clown got to crying about something . . . .  Now what was it made him cry?  Let me see now . . . . Ain't it queer I can't remember that?  Fudge!  Well, never mind now.  It will come to me in a minute.\\n\\nI feel kind of sorry for the poor little young ones that grow up and never know what a clown is like.  Oh, yes, they have them to-day, after a fashion.  They stub their toes and fall down the same as ever, but there is a whole mob of them and you can't take the interest in them that you could in \\\"the one, the only, the inimitable\\\" clown there used to be, a character of such importance that he got his name on the bills.  He was a mighty man in those days.  The ring-master was a kind of stuck-up fellow, very important in his own estimation, but he didn't have a spark of humor.  Not a spark.  And he'd be swelling around there, all so grand, and the clown, just to take him down a peg or two, would ask him a conundrum.  And do you think he could ever guess one? Never.  Not a one.  And when the clown would tell him what the answer was, he'd be so vexed at himself that he'd try to take it out on the poor clown, and cut at him with his long whip.  But Mr. Clown was just as spry in his shoes as he was under the hat, and he'd hop up on the ring-side out of the way, and squall out: \\\"A-a-aah!  Never touched me!\\\"  We had that for a byword.  Oh, you'd die laughing at the comical remarks he'd make.  And he'd be so quick about it.  The ring-master would say something, and before you'd think, the clown would make a joke out of it . . . . I wish I could remember what it was he said that was so funny, the time he started crying.  Seems to me it was something about his little brother . . . . Well, no matter.\\n\\nYes, sir, there are heads of families to-day, I'll bet you, that have grown up without ever having heard a clown sing a comic song, and ask the audience to join in the chorus.  And if you say to such people: \\\"Here we are again, Mr. Merryman,\\\" or \\\"Bring on another horse,\\\" or \\\"What will the little lady have now? the banners, my lord?\\\" they look at you so funny.  They don't know what you mean, and they don't know whether to get huffy or not.  Well, I suppose it had to be that the Funny Old Clown with all his songs, and quips, and conundrums, and comical remarks should disappear.  Perhaps he \\\"didn't pay.\\\"\\n\\nI can't see that the rest of the show has changed so very much. Perhaps the trapeze performances are more marvelous and breath-suspending than they used to be.  But they were far and far beyond what we could dream of then, and to go still farther as little impresses us as to be told that people live still even westerly of Idaho.  The trapeze performers are up-to-date in one respect.  The fellow that comes down with his arms folded, one leg stuck out and the other twined around the big rope, revolving slowly, slowly - well, the band plays the Intermezzo from \\\"Cavalleria Rusticana\\\" nowadays when he does that.  It used to play: \\\"O Thou, Sweet Spirit, Hear my Prayer!\\\"  But the lady in the riding-habit still smiles as if it hurt her when her horse walks on its hind legs; the bareback rider does the very same fancy steps as the horse goes round the ring in a rocking-chair lope; the attendants still slant the hurdles almost flat for the horse to jump; they still snake the banners under the rider's feet as he gives a little hop up, and they still bang him on the head with the paper-covered hoop to  . . . . Hold on a minute.  Now.\\n\\nNow .  .  .  That story the clown told that was so funny, that had something to do with those hoops.  I wish I could think of it.  It would make you laugh, I know.\\n\\nPeople try to lay the blame of the modern circus's failure to interest them on the three rings.  They say so many things to watch at once keeps them from being watching properly any one act.  They can't give it the attention it deserves.  But I'll tell you what's wrong:  There isn't any Funny Old Clown, a particular one, to give it human interest.  It is all too splendid, too magnificent, too far beyond us.  We want to hear somebody talk once in awhile.\\n\\nThey pretended that the tent was too big for the clown to be heard, but I take notice it wasn't too big for the fellow to get up and declaim \\\"The puffawmance ees not yait hawf ovah.  The jaintlemanly agents will now pawss around the ring with tickets faw the concert.\\\" I used to hate that man.  When he said the performance was not yet half over, he lied like a dog, consarn his picture!  There were only a few more acts to come.  He knew it and we knew it.  We wanted the show to go on and on, and always to be just as exciting as at the very first, and it wouldn't!  We had got to the point where we couldn't be interested in anything any more.  We were as little ones unable to prop their eyelids open and yet quarreling with bed. We were surfeited, but not satisfied.  We sat there and pouted because there wasn't any more, and yet we couldn't but yawn at the act before us.  We were mad at ourselves, and mad at everybody else. We clambered down the rattling bedslats seats, sour and sullen.  We didn't want to look at the animals; we didn't want to do this, and we didn't want to do that.  We whined and snarled, and wriggled and shook ourselves with temper, and we got a good hard slap, side of the head, right before everybody, and then we yelled as if we were being killed alive.\\n\\n\\\"Now, mister, if I ever take you any place again, you'll know it. I'd be ashamed of myself if I was you.  Hush up!  Hush up, I tell you.  Now you mark.  You're never going to the show again.  Do you hear me?  Never! I mean it.  You're never going again.\\\"\\n\\nBut at eventide there was light.  After supper, after a little rest and a good deal of food, while chopping the kindling for morning (it's wonderful how useful employ tends to induce a cheerful view of life) out of her dazzling treasure-heap of jewels, Memory took up, one after another, a glowing recollection and viewed it with delight.  The evening performance, the one all lighted up with bunches and bunches of lights, was a-preparing, and in the gentle breeze the far-off music waved as it had been a flag.  A harsh and rumbling noise as of heavy timbers falling tore through the tissue of sweet sounds.  The horses in the barn next door screamed in their stalls to hear it.  Ages and ages ago, on distant wind-swept plains their ancestors had hearkened to that hunting-cry, and summoned up their valor and their speed.  It still thrilled in the blood of these patient slaves of man, though countless generations of them had never even so much as seen a lion.\\n\\n\\\"And is that all the difference, pa, that the lion roars at night and the ostrich in the daytime?\\\"\\n\\nOut on the back porch in the deepening dusk we sat, with eyes relaxed and dreaming, and watched the stars that powdered the dark sky.  Before our inward vision passed in review the day of splendor and renown.  We sighed, at last, but it was the happy sigh of him who has full dined.  Ambition was digesting.  In our turn, when we grew up, we, too, were to do the deeds of high emprise.  We were to be somebody.\\n\\n(I never heard of anybody sitting up to see the show depart.  And yet it seems to me that would be the best time to run off with it.)\\n\\nThe next day we visited the lots.  It was no dream.  See the litter that mussed up the place.\\n\\nWe were all there.  None had heard the man that runs the show say genially: \\\"Yes, I think we can arrange to take you with us.\\\"  Here was the ring; here the tent-pole holes, and here a scrap of paper torn from a hoop the bareback rider leaped through . . . .  Oh, now I know what I was going to tell you that the clown said.  The comicalest thing!\\n\\nHe picked up one of these hoops and began to sniffle.\\n\\nSo the ring-master asked him what he was crying about.\\n\\n\\\"I - I -was thinking of my mother.  Smf!  My good old mother!\\\"\\n\\nSo the ring-master asked him what made him think of his mother.\\n\\n\\\"This.\\\"  And he held up the paper-covered hoop.\\n\\nThe ring-master couldn't see how that put the clown in mind of his mother.  He was awful dumb, that man.\\n\\n\\\"It looks just like the pancakes she used to make for us.\\\"\\n\\nWell, sir, we just hollered and laughed at that.  And after we had quieted down a little, the ringmaster says: \\\"As big as that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Bigger,\\\" says the clown.  \\\"Why, she used to make 'em so big we used 'em for bedclothes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Indeed\\\"  (Just like that.  He took it all in, just as if it was so.)\\n\\n\\\"Oh, my, yes!  I mind one time I was sleeping with my little brother, and I waked up just as cold - Brr!  But I was cold!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But how could that be, sir?  You just now said you had pancakes for bedclothes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, but my little brother got hungry in the night, and et up all the cover.\\\"\\n\\nLaugh?  Why, they screamed.  Me?  I thought I'd just about go up. But the ring master never cracked a smile.  He didn't see the joke at all.\\n\\nGood-by, old clown, friend of our childhood, goodby, good-by forever!  And you, our other friend, the street parade, must you go, too?  And you, the gorgeous show-bills, must you tread the path toward the sundown?  Good-by!  Good-by!  In that dreary land where you are going, the Kingdom of the Ausgespielt, it may comfort you to recollect the young hearts you have made happy in the days that were, but never more can be again.\\n\\nTHE COUNTY FAIR\\n\\nWhether or not the name had an influence on the weather, I don't know.  Perhaps it did rain some years, but, as I remember, County Fair time seems to have had a sky perfectly cloudless, with its blue only a little dulled around the edges where it came close to the ground and the dust settled on it.  Things far off were sort of hazy, but that might have been the result of the bonfires of leaves we had been having evenings after supper.  In Fair weather, when the sun had been up long enough to get a really good start, it was right warm, but in the shade it was cool, and nights and mornings there was a chill in the air that threatened worse things to come.\\n\\nThe harvest is past, the summer is ended.  Down cellar the swing-shelf is cram-jam full of jellyglasses, and jars of fruit. Out on the hen-house roof are drying what, when the soap-box wagon was first built, promised barrels and barrels of nuts to be brought up with the pitcher of cider for our comforting in the long winter evenings, but what turns out, when the shucks are off, to be a poor, pitiful half-peck, daily depleted by the urgent necessity of finding out if they are dry enough yet.  Folks are picking apples, and Koontz's cider-mill is in full operation.  (Do you know any place where a fellow can get some nice long straws?)  Out in the fields are champagne-colored pyramids, each with a pale-gold heap of corn beside it, and the good black earth is dotted with orange blobs that promise pumpkin-pies for Thanksgiving Day.  No.  Let me look again.  Those aren't pie-pumpkins; those are cow-pumpkins, and if you want to see something kind of pitiful, I'll show you Abe Bethard chopping up one of those yellow globes -with what, do you suppose?  With the cavalry saber his daddy used at Gettysburg.\\n\\nThe harvest is past, the summer is ended.  As a result of all the good feeding and the outdoor air we have had for three or four months past, the strawberry shortcakes, and cherry-pies, and green peas, and new potatoes, and string beans, and roasting-ears, and all such garden-stuff, and the fresh eggs, broken into the skillet before Speckle gets done cackling, and the cockerels we pick off the roost Saturday evenings (you see, we're thinning 'em out; no sense in keeping all of 'em over winter) - as a result, I say, of all this good eating, and the outdoor life, and the necessity of stirring around a little lively these days we feel pretty good.  And yet we get kind of low in our minds, too.  The harvest is past, the summer is ended.  It's gone, the good playtime when we didn't have to go to school, when the only foot-covering we wore was a rag around one big toe or the other; the days when we could stay in swimming all day long except mealtimes; the days of Sabbath-school picnics and excursions to the Soldiers' Home - it's gone.  The harvest is past, the summer is ended.  The green and leafy things have heard the word, and most of them are taking it pretty seriously, judging by their looks.  But the maples and some more of them, particularly the maples, with daredevil recklessness, have resolved, as it were, to die with their boots on, and flame out in such violent and unbelievable colors that we feel obliged to take testimony in certain outrageous cases, and file away the exhibits in the Family Bible where nobody will bother them.  The harvest is past, the summer is ended.  Rainy days you can see how played-out and forlorn the whole world looks.  But at Fair time, when the sun shines bright, it appears right cheerful.\\n\\nIt seems to me the Fair lasted three days.  One of them was a holiday from school, I know, and unless I'm wrong, it wasn't on the first day, because then they were getting the things in, and it wasn't on the last day, because then they were taking the things out, so it must have been on the middle day, when everybody went. Charley Wells had both the depot 'buses out with \\\"County FAIR\\\" painted on muslin hung on the sides.  The Cornet Band rode all round town in one, and so on over to the \\\"scene of the festivities\\\" as the Weekly Examiner very aptly put it, and then both 'buses stood out in front of the American House, waiting for passengers, with Dinny Enright calling out: \\\"This sway t' the Fair Groun's!  Going RIGHT over!\\\"  Only he always waited till he got a good load before he turned a wheel.  (Dinny's foreman at the chair factory now.  Did you know that?  Doing fine.  Gets $15 a week, and hasn't drunk a drop for nearly two years.)\\n\\nEverybody goes the middle day of the Fair, everybody that you ever did know or hear tell of.  You'll be going along, kind of half-listening to the man selling Temperance Bitters, and denouncing the other bitters because they have \\\"al-cue-hawl\\\" in them, and \\\"al-cue-hawl will make you drunk,\\\" (which is perfectly true), and kind of half-listening to the man with the electric machine, declaring: \\\"Ground is the first conductor; water is the second conductor,\\\" and you'll be thinking how slippery the grass is to walk on, when a face in the crowd will, as it were, sting your memory.  \\\"I ought to know that man,\\\" says you to yourself.  \\\"Now, who the mischief is he?  Barker?  No, 't isn't Barker, Barkdull? No.  Funny I can't think of his name.  Begins with B I'm pretty certain.\\\"  And you trail along after him, as if you were a detective, sort of keeping out of his sight, and yet every once in a while getting a good look at him.  \\\"Mmmmmm!\\\"  says you.  \\\"What is that fellow's name?  Why, sure. McConica.\\\"  And you walk up to him and stick out your hand while he's gassing with somebody, and there's that smile on your face that says: \\\"I know you but you don't know me,\\\" and he takes it in a limp sort of fashion, and starts to say: \\\"You have the advantage of - \\\" when, all of a sudden, he grabs your hand as if he were going to jerk your arm out of its socket and beat you over the head with the bloody end, and shouts out: \\\"Why, HELLO, Billy!  Well, suffering Cyrus and all hands round!  Hold still a second and let me look at you.  Gosh darn your hide, where you been for so long?  I though you'd clean evaporated off the face the earth. Why, how AIR you?  How's everything?  That's good.  Let me make you acquainted with my wife.  Molly, this is Mr. - \\\"  But she says: \\\"Now don't you tell me what his name is.  Let me think.  Why, Willie Smith!  Well, of all things!  Why, how you've changed! Honest, I wouldn't have knowed you.  Do you mind the time we went sleigh-ridin' the whole posse of us, and got upset down there by Hanks's place?\\\" And then you start in on \\\"D' you mind?\\\" and \\\"Don't you recollect?\\\" and you talk about the old school-days, and who's married, and who's moved out to Kansas, and who's got the Elias Hoover place now, and how Ella Trimble - You know Ella Diefenbaugh, old Jake Diefenbaugh's daughter, the one that lisped.  Course you do.  Well, she married Ed Trimble, and he died along in the early part of the summer.  Typhoid. Was getting well but he took a relapse, and went off like that!  And now she's left with three little ones, and they guess poor Ella has a pretty hard time making out.  And this old schoolmate that you start to tell a funny story about is dead, and the freckle-faced boy with the buck teeth that put the rabbit in the teacher's desk, he's dead, too, and the boy that used to cry in school when they read:\\n\\n\\\"Give me three grains of corn, mother,     Only three grains o f corn;     To save what little life I have, mother,     Till the coming o f the morn.\\\"\\n\\nwell, he studied law with old judge Rodehaver, and got to be Prosecuting Attorney, but he took to drinking - politics, you know  - and now he's just gone to the dogs.  Smart as a steel-trap, and bright as a dollar.  Oh, a terrible pity!  A terrible pity.  And as you hear the fate of one after another of the happy companions of your childhood, and the sadness of life comes over you, they start to tell something that makes you laugh again.  I tell you. Did you ever see one of these concave glasses, such as the artists use when they want to get an idea of how a picture looks all together as a whole, and not as an assemblage of parts?  Well, what the concave glass is to a picture, so such talk is to life. It sort of draws it all together, and you see it as a whole, its sunshine and its shadow, its laughter and its tears, its work and its play, its past and its present.  But not its future.  The Good Man has mercifully hidden that from us.\\n\\nIt does a body good to get such a talk once in a while.\\n\\nAnd there are the young fellows and the girls.  This young gentleman in the rimless eye-glasses, who is now beginning to \\\"go out among 'em\\\" the last time you saw him was in meeting when Elder Drown was preaching, and my gentleman stood up in the seat and shouted shrilly: \\\"'T ain't at all, man.  'T ain't at all!\\\"  And this sweet girl-graduate - the last time you saw her was just after Becky Daly, in the vain effort to \\\"peacify\\\" the squalling young one, had given her a fresh egg to play with.  I kind o' like the looks of the younger generation of girls.  But I don't know about the young fellows.  They look to me like a trifling lot.  Nothing like what they were in our young days.  I don't see but what us old codgers had better hold on a while longer to the County Clerk's office, and the Sheriff's office, and the Probate judgeship, and the presidency of the National Bank.  It wouldn't be safe to trust the destinies of the country in the hands of such heedless young whiffets.  Engaged to be married! Oh, get out!  What? Those babies?\",\"timestamp\":1639993019,\"title\":\"\\nThe boys that made the little white spots come on the corners of their jaws as they lay there in the grass\"},\"digest\":\"X8Homa-4xS5ZjnvBeIc9Xmbk0BvXlXONW4CMAIp6EDE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x93be0c9BA98F727B6919FE7c4E542c3bD617d31D\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zrFBgnCPFui8QRhUsFgtgYYMrX4vMMKfivpGlC5daSo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"9O_ZkuIZV3Ks3i05LopHcjrhGz36DhWc3mywgQnFEuA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"jfhTcLfW6YFtrL6MXSQJW66X85o0N523Md7TgNJl3ozti6zlBmYw5NHW7mpmruGuKICFE5bQkE_kmxqCCd1-Hg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc8fedb7628acfd9fa48ab8e4c6d2b3a7825de57b2f0d1f3341ece65b320944bc1fa15137cb3c7827f6ef6ed56ad47efb23a37211fd4a20c3281112c952633cba1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zrFBgnCPFui8QRhUsFgtgYYMrX4vMMKfivpGlC5daSo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"9O_ZkuIZV3Ks3i05LopHcjrhGz36DhWc3mywgQnFEuA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"X8Homa-4xS5ZjnvBeIc9Xmbk0BvXlXONW4CMAIp6EDE\"}"
