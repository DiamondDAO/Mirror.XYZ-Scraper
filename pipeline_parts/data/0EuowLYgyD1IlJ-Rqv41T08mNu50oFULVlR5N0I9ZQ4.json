The aim could be as simple as pooling funds to buy an expensive piece of artwork. In other cases, DAOs can operate more like a members-only club, where you have to buy a specific NFT to gain access to the organization.\\n\\nAll of the behavior in the DAO is incentivized by a governance token, which grants holders access to exclusive events or voting power.\\n\\nNo matter the form and objective, DAOs are beginning to have a major impact on mainstream culture. From art to sports, crowdfunding and finance, these extremely-online crypto groups are likely here to stay.\\n\\nHere are our picks (not ranked) for the 8 most interesting DAOs you need to give close attention to in 2022.\\n\\n## ConstitutionDAO\\n\\n![ConstitutionDAO](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZY3m4fOTPbn9HJ7xuxrsN.webp?height=787&width=1400)\\n\\n**Who**: Julian Weisser\\n\\n**What**: Group effort to buy a copy of the U.S. Constitution\\n\\n**Why**: Preserve history, stick it to the establishment\\n\\nDespite [failing to win](https://decrypt.co/86426/confusion-constitutiondao-fails-win-sothebys-auction) a highly rare copy of the U.S. Constitution auctioned by Sotheby’s, ConstitutionDAO [succeeded](https://decrypt.co/86493/constitution-dao) in vaulting the concept of DAOs into mainstream culture. It revealed the power of community organization and speed at which DAOs can fundraise, showed how crypto groups can have real sway in the world, and has since inspired several similar ventures. (Just check out [Krause House](https://decrypt.co/86601/krause-house-dao-has-quickly-raised-1-7m-aims-to-buy-nba-team) for another DAO with a wild goal.)\\n\\nWhat’s even stranger in the wake of ConstitutionDAO’s losing effort is that its native token PEOPLE [hit an all-time high](https://decrypt.co/88075/people-power-constitutiondao-token-hits-record-high-3-weeks-failed-auction) long after the project shuttered operations—it’s trading like a meme coin.\\n\\n## FriendsWithBenefits DAO\\n\\n![FriendsWithBenefits DAO](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rNLxRjmF-7tfnsmliOcEc.webp?height=787&width=1400)\\n\\n**Who**: Trevor McFredries\\n\\n**What**: A members-only social club for crypto\\n\\n**Why**: FOMO!\\n\\nFriendsWithBenefits, or simply FWB, looks like a members-only club with a token attached, but it's [asking](https://consensys.net/blog/codefi/friends-with-benefits-a-new-model-for-social-tokens-on-ethereum/) fundamental questions about value accrual within social networks. Specifically, how does Web3 technology make platforms like Spotify or Facebook suck less?\\n\\nHere’s how it works: First, buy some FWB tokens. These are your entry passes; the more you hold, the more stuff you can do. With just one FWB token, which’ll cost you about $78 a pop at today’s prices, you can read the community’s newsletter.\\n\\nWhen you buy five tokens, you’ll get exclusive access to different [community-driven events](https://www.fwb.help/events/FWB-LA-x-Leaving-Records-x-Kensho-Group-Holiday-Party-001) and gain access to FWB’s Cities initiative, which is creating different FWB hubs (or sub-DAOs) in New York, London, and Los Angeles.\\n\\nBut those with 75 tokens get exclusive access to the project’s primary Discord channel. So for nearly $6,000 you can buy your full access into one of crypto’s most exclusive clubs.\\n\\n## PleasrDAO\\n\\n![PleasrDAO](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WEcQXMQb0ZLr27XPZ8Nlm.webp?height=466&width=1400)\\n\\n**Who**: NFT artists and collectors\\n\\n**What**: [$PEEPS](https://pleasr.xyz/?utm_source=m&utm_medium=p&utm_id=8)\\n\\n**Why**: Decentralized art appreciation!\\n\\nIt’s been a hell of a first year for PleasrDAO, a decentralized group of NFT artists and collectors who have been pooling funds to acquire culturally relevant digital art.\\n\\nThe DAO first formed in March to [purchase an NFT of an animated Uniswap ad](https://decrypt.co/63080/an-ad-for-uniswap-just-sold-for-525000-as-an-nft-heres-why) by the artist Pplpeasr [for $525,000](https://decrypt.co/63080/an-ad-for-uniswap-just-sold-for-525000-as-an-nft-heres-why), and quickly branched beyond just Pplpleasr art. The collective paid $5.5 million for an [NFT sold by Edward Snowden](https://decrypt.co/66855/edward-snowden-nft-sells-million-ethereum), which at the time was the fourth-highest-selling NFT ever, and [placed the winning $4 million bid](https://decrypt.co/83932/ethereum-pleasrdao-buyer-wu-tang-clan-album) for the sole copy of “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin,” the Wu-Tang Clan album once famously owned by “pharma bro” Martin Shkreli.\\n\\n“The primary objective of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies is to enable one-to-one transfer of ownership and the creation of value without middlemen and centralized rent-seeking institutions,” Jamis Johnson, the DAO’s “chief pleasing officer,” wrote in a [blog post about the album](https://pleasr.mirror.xyz/PTzSIYe6LbNW55i_Jo4S_fgqIiDp3d7YblpikQ1iRks). “What better symbol to represent this fight than an album created to stand up against these establishment juggernauts?”\\n\\nPleasrDAO also paid [$4 million for the Shiba Inu image](https://decrypt.co/79896/doge-nft-fractionalized-investors-pleasrdao-ethereum) that launched millions of memes and meme coins, and acquired the [Ross Ulbricht Genesis Collection](https://decrypt.co/87893/new-dao-buys-ross-ulbricht-ethereum-nft-help-free-him) for $6.3 million.\\n\\n## BitDAO\\n\\n![BitDAO](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1ZC29yLfcWoM9Px733h4y.webp?height=787&width=1400)\\n\\n**Who**: Peter Thiel, Alan Howard, Ben Zhou\\n\\n**What**: The world’s largest treasury, with about $2.5 billion invested\\n\\n**Why**: Investing in a broad range of DeFi projects\\n\\nBitDAO is a unique beast in the DAO ecosystem. Not only has it managed to amass a treasury of more than $2.5 billion through continued [mega-raises](https://decrypt.co/78719/bitdao-raises-another-365-million-after-governance-token-launch), it’s also attracted big-name investors including [Peter Thiel](https://decrypt.co/73806/peter-thiel-leads-230-million-funding-round-for-bitdao), Alan Howard, and Founders Fund.\\n\\nBybit, a Singapore-based derivatives cryptocurrency exchange, has committed 0.025% of its total trading volume to the DAO as well. Based on ByBit data, this figure amounted to roughly $1 billion per year in contributions. Ben Zhou, co-founder and CEO of ByBit, is also the brains behind BitDAO.\\n\\nThe entity is now expected to begin investing in DeFi projects, roll out grants, and even lead token swaps to diversify its treasury. “A priority for the BitDAO community is to create the tooling to enable DAO treasury participation in staking, lending, etc,\\\" BitDAO contributor and spokesperson Kevin Rose wrote via Telegram. \\\"BitDAO is building an ecosystem of autonomous entities (AEs) that are funded in part by the BitDAO treasury and bring together some of the best partners to help develop Web3 across art, entertainment, finance, and technology and more.\\\"\\n\\nAt first glance, all these goals look like pretty standard fodder for a traditional venture fund. But as a decentralized organization equipped with a token (BIT), only token holders can make proposals and vote on their execution.\\n\\n## Beets DAO\\n\\n![Beets DAO](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eSUwZRXv3dqfmxVhiNZm0.webp?height=425&width=1400)\\n\\n**Who**: Jordan Garbis, Sasha Rosewood\\n\\n**What**: Collective focused on buying music-based NFTs\\n\\n**Why**: People making money from their love of music and NFTs\\n\\nBeetsDAO is a 58-person community born within the larger EulerBeats NFT community that has a serious obsession with all music-based NFTs.\\n\\nLike some of the other DAOs on this list, BeetsDAO is, at its core, primarily pooling funds for group investments. But on a few occasions, it’s also been responsible for commissioning new art and music.\\n\\nIn March, the [DAO bought four rare EulerBeats Enigma NFTs](https://decrypt.co/63528/euler-beats-enigma-nft-auction-price-boom), algorithmically generated audio files. A month later, the group organized the creation, launch, and sale of the “[Nyan Dogg](https://decrypt.co/68570/snoop-dogg-twist-nyan-cat-nft-sells)” NFT, a collaboration between the original Nyan Cat artist and Snoop Dogg. Nyan Dogg raked in nearly $250,000.\\n\\n## LexDAO\\n\\n![LexDAO](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vao_vbhrRMYEZsMWY0Xl-.webp?height=787&width=1400)\\n\\n**Who**: Legal engineers\\n\\n**What**: Legally-minded engineers who also like crypto\\n\\n**Why**: To turn legal services into code\\n\\nLexDAO is careful to make this very clear: LexDAO is not a law firm and does not offer legal advice. It’s even in the name of the DAO’s metaverse headquarters in CryptoVoxels: “lexDAO Not Your Lawyer,” located at [33 Math Throughway, West End, Origin City](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/parcels/2223).\\n\\nSo, what is it? It’s a group of “legal engineering professionals”—[some of whom are, in fact, attorneys](https://github.com/lexDAO/Lawyers)—who want to build tools that blockchain projects can use in place of some basic and often inaccessibly expensive legal services. For instance, the DAO’s [LexLocker](https://github.com/lexDAO/LexLockerV2) is an escrow system for holding deposits while goods or services are delivered without needing to rely on a bank or another third party. The group has even come up with a method for providing an [arbitration service](https://github.com/lexDAO/Arbitration) that renders a decision through a multi-sig panel of LexDAO legal engineers.\\n\\nWhen they’re not building new tools, the DAO’s members share legally minded thoughts about blockchain project disputes on [their blog](https://lexdao.substack.com/archive?utm_source=menu-dropdown). Their latest take: an in-depth argument that the jurors in the [50 ETH Kleros doge case](https://lexdao.substack.com/p/the-case-of-the-50-eth-doge) got it wrong.\\n\\n## Mirror\\n\\n![Mirror](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gvmi9oXjiLU3qI25Evj1n.webp?height=506&width=1012)\\n\\n**Who**: Writers and early WRITE token holders\\n\\n**What**: Decentralized blogging platform\\n\\n**Why**: Turn writing into NFTs to benefit creators\\n\\nMirror has elements of Medium, Substack, and Kickstarter. Its original tagline: “Writing as usual. Publishing like never before.” When it launched in February, you could only get access by finishing in the top 10 in its weekly WRITE race, where existing members vote for aspiring members; the top finishers each week received one WRITE token that they could mint in exchange for a Mirror-hosted blog. In October, Mirror changed course and [opened the platform to anyone](https://decrypt.co/82703/ethereum-based-blogging-platform-mirror-opens-up-to-everyone), though you can still only get a custom domain name by winning the WRITE race.\\n\\nWhen publishing on Mirror, writers can choose to turn their posts into NFTs that their fans can buy; Emily Segal [crowdfunded her next novel](https://decrypt.co/68981/emily-segal-novel-crowdfund) via Mirror. In June, Mirror [added collaborative publishing tools](https://dev.mirror.xyz/WPnZICvS2XbHJQ3u-GrsvYqios3XWmZhQvTKEyUJOGE) and the option to create a media DAO.\\n\\nWe at *Decrypt* also see major potential in DAOs to fix broken digital media models, which is why we [co-created PubDAO](https://decrypt.co/84755/pubdao-media-dao-decentralized-news-wire).\\n\\n## Uniswap DAO\\n\\n![Uniswap DAO](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sJ2FDz_rAmq_J3tlrr8kI.png?height=787&width=1400)\\n\\n**Who**: Uniswap users\\n\\n**What**: Community-controlled DeFi utility\\n\\n**Why**: Improve DeFi governance\\n\\nSince launching its [governance](https://gov.uniswap.org/) token in September 2020, the industry’s most popular decentralized exchange has become a very influential DAO.\\n\\nConsider, for instance, that when Uniswap voted to reduce trading fees for some stablecoin swaps, volume soared. Much of this volume likely came from users flocking to Uniswap from other DeFi projects. In other words, when Uniswap speaks, DeFi money listens.\\n\\nThe Uniswap DAO also made headlines as a battleground for the crypto community. In May, a proposal emerged that sought to use up to $40 million in the [project’s treasury](https://decrypt.co/72241/uniswap-community-votes-40m-defi-lobbying-organization-proposal) to establish a “political defense” for the broader DeFi sector. The initiative faced heavy criticism as it became clear that the group in favor of unlocking those funds were [also delegates](https://decrypt.co/75841/uniswap-proposal-sparks-blowback-after-grantees-dump-10m-uni-tokens) from mega-influential investment firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).\\n\\nThough the proposal passed eventually (under a smaller budget), the pushback resulted in a16z [open-sourcing](https://decrypt.co/79392/andreessen-horowitz-decentralization) how it delegates its mountain of governance tokens to different entities.\\n\\n\\n---\",\"timestamp\":1640764380,\"title\":\"8 Most Interesting DAOs You Can't Miss in 2022\"},\"digest\":\"dtTqzKJBeWVJN96e9RVfp2pin_4DnPTKzqPsKBTZDVM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x17c362F7263957F15b0657c593EC270d71A6De0a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0RNJtVNIehgKmuZd8QWGjikt4nWWHZGOQ29F7H90Oe8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Cxs7AMmYCZfVroEHCTCpQzeLEh6sFSuu6QCesX2W9kU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"4Hkya1NG2wzaleKj4VrQeAyzxcliC1mzce1VrNjjcUPwo_whqvP2eF3XRR0ofc58RpO2vtcKquKNvwClxhNBKQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x352fd4713c6f6a14d3fbd4f1fd5a1dd1e62dd56c8ff69cbf5e0291ddbd6f787740455c264e902c575d2f43d7d3b9f88256dce544e0090d9063faa367ac8b43ea1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0RNJtVNIehgKmuZd8QWGjikt4nWWHZGOQ29F7H90Oe8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Cxs7AMmYCZfVroEHCTCpQzeLEh6sFSuu6QCesX2W9kU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Qwk8urwW1qhsCRh-CN4ouZghBHjg-715Tww3kqM-d_I\"}"
