"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"and Vizard soon appeared, and took his seat opposite Miss Gale and Mademoiselle Klosking. The latter whispered her doctress: \\\"It would be wise of me not to speak much at present.\\\" La Gale communicated this to Vizard, and they drove along in dead silence. But they were naturally curious to know where they were going; so they held some communication with their eyes. They very soon found they were going to Taddington Station.\\n\\nThen came a doubt--were they going up or down?\\n\\nThat was soon resolved.\\n\\nMr. Ashmead had hired a saloon carriage for them, with couches and conveniences.\\n\\nThey entered it; and Mademoiselle Klosking said to Miss Gale, \\\"It is necessary that I should sleep.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You shall,\\\" said Miss Gale.\\n\\nWhile she was arranging the pillows and things, La Klosking said to Vizard, \\\"We artists learn to sleep when we have work to do. Without it I should not be strong enough this day.\\\" She said this in a half-apologetic tone, as one anxious not to give him any shadow of offense.\\n\\nShe was asleep in five minutes; and Miss Gale sat watching her at first, but presently joined Vizard at the other end, and they whispered together. Said she, \\\"What becomes of the theory that women have no strength of will? There is Mademoiselle *Je le veux* in person. When she wants to sleep, she sleeps; and look at you and me--do you know where we are going?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No more do I. The motive power is that personification of divine repose there. How beautiful she is with her sweet lips parted, and her white teeth peeping, and her upper and lower lashes wedded, and how graceful!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She is a goddess,\\\" said Vizard. \\\"I wish I had never seen her. Mark my words, she will give me the sorest heart of all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hope not,\\\" said Rhoda, very seriously.\\n\\nIna slept sweetly for nearly two hours, and all that time her friends could only guess where they were going.\\n\\nAt last the train stopped, for the sixth time, and Ashmead opened the door.\\n\\nThis worthy, who was entirely in command of the expedition, collected the luggage, including Vizard's bag, and deposited it at the station. He then introduced the party to a pair-horse fly, and mounted the box.\\n\\nWhen they stopped at Bagley, Vizard suspected where they were going.\\n\\nWhen he saw the direction the carriage took, he knew it, and turned very grave indeed.\\n\\nHe even regretted that he had put himself so blindly under the control of a woman. He cast searching glances at Mademoiselle Klosking to try and discover what on earth she was going to do. But her face was as impenetrable as marble. Still, she never looked less likely to do anything rash or in bad taste. Quietness was the main characteristic of her face, when not rippled over by a ravishing sweetness; but he had never seen her look so great, and lofty, and resolute as she looked now; a little stern, too, as one who had a great duty to do, and was inflexible as iron. When truly feminine features stiffen into marble like this, beauty is indeed imperial, and worthy of epic song; it rises beyond the wing of prose.\\n\\nMy reader is too intelligent not to divine that she was steeling herself to a terrible interview with Zoe Vizard--terrible mainly on account of the anguish she knew she must inflict.\\n\\nBut we can rarely carry out our plans exactly as we trace them--unexpected circumstances derange them or expand them; and I will so far anticipate as to say that in this case a most unexpected turn of events took La Klosking by surprise.\\n\\nWhether she proved equal to the occasion these pages will show very soon.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI.\\n\\nPOIKILUS never left Taddington--only the \\\"Swan.\\\" More than once he was within sight of Ashmead unobserved. Once, indeed, that gentleman, who had a great respect for dignitaries, saluted him; for at that moment Poikilus happened to be a sleek dignitary of the Church of England. Poikilus, when quite himself, wore a mustache, and was sallow, and lean as a weasel; but he shaved and stuffed and colored for the dean. Shovel-hat, portly walk, and green spectacles did the rest. Grandfather Whitehead saluted. His reverence chuckled.\\n\\nPoikilus kept Severne posted by letter and wire as to many things that happened outside Vizard Court; but he could not divine the storm that was brewing inside Ina Klosking's room. Yet Severne defended himself exactly as he would have done had he known all. He and Zoe spent Elysian hours, meeting twice a day in the shrubbery, and making love as if they were the only two creatures in the world; but it was blind Elysium only to one of them--Severne was uneasy and alarmed the whole time. His sagacity showed him it could not last, and there was always a creeping terror on him. Would not Uxmoor cause inquiries? Would he not be sure to tell Vizard? Would not Vizard come there to look after Zoe, or order her back to Vizard Court? Would not the Klosking get well, and interfere once more? He passed the time between heaven and hell; whenever he was not under the immediate spell of Zoe's presence, a sort of vague terror was always on him. He looked all round him, wherever he went.\\n\\nThis terror, and his passion, which was now as violent as it was wicked, soon drove him to conceive desperate measures. But, by masterly self-government, he kept them two days to his own bosom. He felt it was too soon to raise a fresh and painful discussion with Zoe. He must let her drink unmixed delight, and get a taste for it; and then show her on what conditions alone it could be had forever.\\n\\nIt was on the third day after their reconciliation she found him seated on a bench in the shrubbery, lost in thought, and looking very dejected. She was close to him before he noticed; then he sprung up, stared at her, and began to kiss her hands violently, and even her very dress.\\n\\n\\\"It is you,\\\" said he, \\\"once more.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, dear,\\\" said Zoe, tenderly; \\\"did you think I would not come?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I did not know whether you could come. I feel that my happiness cannot last long. And, Zoe dear, I have had a dream. I dreamed we were taken prisoners, and carried to Vizard Court, and on the steps stood Vizard and Mademoiselle Klosking arm-in-arm; I believe they were man and wife. And you were taken out and led, weeping, into the house, and I was left there raging with agony. And then that lady put out her finger in a commanding way, and I was whirled away into utter darkness, and I heard you moan, and I fought, and dashed my head against the carriage, and I felt my heart burst, and my whole body filled with some cold liquid, and I went to sleep, and I heard a voice say, 'It is all over; his trouble is ended.' I was dead.\\\"\\n\\nThis narrative, and his deep dejection, set Zoe's tears flowing. \\\"Poor Edward!\\\" she sighed. \\\"I would not survive you. But cheer up, dear; it was only a dream. We are not slaves. I am not dependent on any one. How can we be parted?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We shall, unless we use our opportunity, and make it impossible to part us. Zoe, do not slight my alarm and my misgivings; such warnings are prophetic. For Heaven's sake, make one sacrifice more, and let us place our happiness beyond the reach of man!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Only tell me how.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is but one way--marriage.\\\"\\n\\nZoe blushed high, and panted a little, but said nothing.\\n\\n\\\"Ah!\\\" said he, piteously, \\\"I ask too much.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How can you say that?\\\" said Zoe. \\\"Of course I shall marry you, dearest. What! do you think I could do what I *have* done for anybody but my husband that is to be?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I was mad to think otherwise,\\\" said he, \\\"but I am in low spirits, and full of misgivings. Oh, the comfort, the bliss, the peace of mind, the joy, if you would see our hazardous condition, and make all safe by marrying me to-morrow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To-morrow! Why, Edward, are you mad? How can we be married, so long as my brother is so prejudiced against you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If we wait his consent, we are parted forever. He would forgive us after it--that is certain. But he would never consent. He is too much under the influence of his--of Mademoiselle Klosking.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Indeed, I cannot hope he will consent beforehand,\\\" sighed Zoe; \\\"but I have not the courage to defy him; and if I had, we could not marry all in a moment, like that. We should have to be cried in church.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is quite gone out among ladies and gentlemen.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not in our family. Besides, even a special license takes time, I suppose. Oh no, I could not be married in a clandestine, discreditable way. I am a Vizard--please remember that. Would you degrade the woman you honor with your choice?\\\"\\n\\nAnd her red cheeks and flashing eyes warned him to desist.\\n\\n\\\"God forbid!\\\" said he. \\\"If that is the alternative, I consent to lose her--and lose her I shall.\\\"\\n\\nHe then affected to dismiss the subject, and said, \\\"Let me enjoy the hours that are left me. Much misery or much bliss can be condensed in a few days. I will enjoy the blessed time, and we will wait for the chapter of accidents that is sure to part us.\\\" Then he acted reckless happiness, and broke down at last.\\n\\nShe cried, but showed no sign of yielding. Her pride and self-respect were roused and on their defense.\\n\\nThe next day he came to her quietly sad. He seemed languid and listless, and to care for nothing. He was artful enough to tell her, on the information of Poikilus, that Vizard had hired the cathedral choir three times a week to sing to his inamorata; and that he had driven her about Taddington, dressed like a duchess, in a whole suit of sables.\\n\\nAt that word the girl turned pale.\\n\\nHe observed, and continued: \\\"And it seems these sables are known throughout the county. There were several carriages in the town, and my informant heard a lady say they were Mrs. Vizard's sables, worth five hundred guineas--a Russian princess gave them her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is quite true,\\\" said Zoe. \\\"His mother's sables! Is it possible!\\\"\\n\\n[ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/15](ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/15)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637672200,\"title\":\"\\nThe ladies now got into the carriage; Ashmead insisted on going upon the box\"},\"digest\":\"A2DE1yBU24FtRWA8Jwb1pZZHF-HGnr-eBk7Hr8LD97s\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xebb47BcE22955a8570D5570840798eda13Ec89EB\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"XTkuTlf-ntHI0o6_Q-FSfNaXGP-lUgW4JMK-ZaEYXjg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"G1ry0sF87Mzl0QId6C99qrTjWmmHtCu3HKFZsOiDk7s\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"0lkkm1Duw85UNSQPRVwKVTa_p73Jv3MGv-6rsUwt_boFlR407nXuOS2zl47KvfoS4zTBNbDRE0zR8LtoenmRuw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8f76527f2ae6b285eb64ab0096c0c114e594013cb1328333c4468a9e835c923a68c850cfa92c34e67e08888337271cbfdd13a9cc7fbf31d7b9eb8fcd9c9c0c2c1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"XTkuTlf-ntHI0o6_Q-FSfNaXGP-lUgW4JMK-ZaEYXjg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"G1ry0sF87Mzl0QId6C99qrTjWmmHtCu3HKFZsOiDk7s\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"A2DE1yBU24FtRWA8Jwb1pZZHF-HGnr-eBk7Hr8LD97s\"}"
