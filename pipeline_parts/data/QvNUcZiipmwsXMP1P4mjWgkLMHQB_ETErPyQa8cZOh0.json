Aware of the impact representation can have on the way people perceive the world & how they act, I decided to create every day of 2018 a new emoji to show a different side of the story by showcasing modern & traditional cultures from the continent.\\n\\n### 2019‚Äì2022: From a one-person project to a community project\\n\\nAt the end of the challenge, I realized that what I made was not exactly like what I had in mind: I wanted Zouzoukwa to be a Pan-African project, but most of the emojis I designed represented West Africa and I was basically the only one deciding on which element should be an emoji. To grow, Zouzoukwa has to become a movement built by a community of users voting themselves on what element should be ‚Äúemojified‚Äù and being rewarded for their participation with a social token: $ZOU.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Mission of Zouzoukwa DAO\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NtnV8HBiItThYrURP3FtL.jpeg?height=530&width=900)\\n\\n1. Promote Africa‚Äôs cultural diversity through emojis, stickers, gifs, fonts and other digital communication tools & products\\n2. Onboard people from the continent to web3/crypto in local languages\\n3. Have a tangible impact on the continent through grants and other social initiatives\\n\\n## Crowdfund Goals & Plan\\n\\n* The 15 ETH raise will allow me to work full time for Zouzoukwa, hire developers and designers to build the first product of the DAO and mint all the original 365 emojis on [Foundation](https://foundation.app/collection/zouzoukwa)\\n* $ZOUZOUKWA tokens represent governance rights and membership in the DAO\\n* 80% of $ZOUZOUKWA will be held by the DAO, and a portion will be airdropped to early active community members to give them governance rights\\n* Backers will have access to a special Discord channel\\n* Backers will have more voting power/impact according to the edition they have\\n\\n[edition://0x834Ebe76D6e0331fe86071963caD42c98199fC7c?editionId=100](edition://0x834Ebe76D6e0331fe86071963caD42c98199fC7c?editionId=100)\\n\\n[edition://0x834Ebe76D6e0331fe86071963caD42c98199fC7c?editionId=101](edition://0x834Ebe76D6e0331fe86071963caD42c98199fC7c?editionId=101)\\n\\n[edition://0x834Ebe76D6e0331fe86071963caD42c98199fC7c?editionId=102](edition://0x834Ebe76D6e0331fe86071963caD42c98199fC7c?editionId=102)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What‚Äôs next?\\n\\nAfter the crowdfund and the NFT Collection on Foundation, we are going to hire developers and designers to create **zouzoukwa.africa,** a collaborative platform where people can explore the emojis, learn about the elements they represent, read articles written by the Editorial Team, submit emojis proposals and vote for the proposals to expand the project.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y9Ii5ZGA3bT0a246mWJSl.jpg?height=2000&width=2800)\\n\\n## About the NFT Collection\\n\\n[https://foundation.app/@oplerou/zouzoukwa/1](https://foundation.app/@oplerou/zouzoukwa/1)\\n\\nI will release the emojis by daily batches of 14, and they will be priced according to their popularity on Instagram.\\n\\n```\\nPostEngagementRate = (Likes+Comments)/FollowersCount\\nBasePrice= PostEngagementRate * 36.5\\nListPrice = BasePrice + FoundationFees\\n```\\n\\n### Why you should buy an emoji?\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_nGHyksnAnlPIZT192FJX.jpeg?height=542&width=900)\\n\\nBuying an emoji is being a patron of the African Digital Renaissance era. As soon as an emoji is bought, it will be licensed under Creative Commons CC0, the most open legal way an artist can remove his copyright from his work. It will allow anybody to use the emojis how they want, even for commercial purposes, without having to ask for permission.\\n\\nJust like the Mona Lisa example, the holder of a Zouzoukwa NFT will be the only one having ownership on it without limiting its usage by everyone, thus increasing its value. Emojis will become a kind of public good.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Get in touch\\n\\nIf you have any questions about the project or want to be involved, you can join the Discord or follow Zouzoukwa on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Zouzoukwa) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zouzoukwa_/) ‚ú®\\n\\n[https://discord.com/invite/jFPBy8dq8s](https://discord.com/invite/jFPBy8dq8s)\\n\\n[https://foundation.app/collection/zouzoukwa](https://foundation.app/collection/zouzoukwa)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Press‚ú®\\n\\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/style/a-student-who-makes-african-emojis.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/style/a-student-who-makes-african-emojis.html)\\n\\n[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/nov/18/new-emoji-set-aims-to-shatter-image-of-africa-as-zone-of-famine-and-war](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/nov/18/new-emoji-set-aims-to-shatter-image-of-africa-as-zone-of-famine-and-war)\\n\\n[https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-africa-50098298](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-africa-50098298)\\n\\n[https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/18/africa/22-year-old-creates-african-emojis/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/18/africa/22-year-old-creates-african-emojis/index.html)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n> ‚ÄúYou cannot carry out fundamental change without a certain amount of madness.
