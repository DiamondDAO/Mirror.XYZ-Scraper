"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Paper notes are used for initial recording, followed by electronic notes to refine and organize the content on the paper notes. (A second organization will reinforce memory) Choose a thicker notebook on which you can record notes from multiple books. Allocate the number of pages and divide the books and articles into two different areas for recording. As you take more notes, connections will be made between the knowledge of different books, then create an index inside the notebook to cross-reference citations and integrate them.\\n\\nIt is important to note that taking notes while reading will make reading intermittent and inefficient. And doing only excerpts from the original text, without adding your own sense of understanding, is also easy to forget. In addition, regardless of the speed and coarseness of the reading, the first reading is always negligent, and after that, due to the improvement of experience, thinking angle change and other factors, will make reading the same content and produce other different thinking. As the saying goes, \\\"the best sentences may be discovered only after several readings.\\n\\nA structure to follow is,\\n\\nRead the book once, skim the table of contents and the book content quickly, without going deeper into the content, and finish the book in one sitting to build up an organized knowledge of the book's content. In this first pass, mark the highlights and any questions you have with a pen, or write some annotations next to them. This way, you will know the overall structure of the book and the key chapters in it. Draw a framework diagram to sort out the core content.\\n\\nWhen you read the book for the second time, you will have a different priority ranking of the chapters in your mind, and with this direction and the questions you have recorded, you will focus on certain chapters, while other easy or familiar chapters can be quickly carried over. This time, in the process of reading, encounter unclear concepts, immediately go to the information to figure out. And after that, take the chapter as a unit, summarize the core knowledge of the chapter, and write down your understanding of the knowledge in your own words on your notes. (You can imagine talking to a friend, telling him the knowledge in the easiest way to understand, and if you can't be coherent or encounter unclear places, then understand the knowledge again until you can narrate it completely without reading the article, and then record the main points in this book). Then after that, write some insights of your own to connect the current content to other concepts in the body of knowledge.\\n\\nIn this way, read the text a third time and a fourth time to check for gaps and add to your notes each time you gain a new thought or insight.\\n\\nAlways remember to review your notes after you take them, otherwise they are of limited use. A regular review will complete the recollection of the knowledge points in the book, thus turning short-term memory into long-term memory and combining it with output application to achieve the final effect\\n\\nThe above is the input of knowledge mainly through notes. To use it freely and really incorporate it into your own knowledge system, you still need the output part.\\n\\nA good way to do this is to write a short essay on the content you have learned. Consciously play with applying the knowledge summarized in your notes, incorporate your own insights with real life experiences, and write an essay. If you run into any obstacles, write them down to figure them out, and then continue writing.\",\"timestamp\":1638785213,\"title\":\"Summarized reading & note taking methods\"},\"digest\":\"D4pZdDXMaxG4fIQiWSWQXlVcztgmdhrkcE8QY0ReHos\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x078Ad5270b0240D8529f600f35A271Fc6E2b2bD8\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4Mm1VUtCLCjyzowMDzhRWa9zwdtcVTni1nDxXJks4Go\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ELMuXetzSJd1gdrjYozJSlKBtCM6hS5dYKTfRxD0C-k\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"nhkqnyfFLH6TLcw9rvH586DzR7XeLfVa-x_YrCwb8dCItBhexv2UO0tkUUaGXESFD5ZSuo6oYzL9MsRw_j8ndg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x24109933ad6c03259359c4ec978cd7dadf006533dcc5d26a97a006c77b20799d51616c71a5d37b8d6fa71e5c43b1b7d6afce49686359885fe59db90384d8736f1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4Mm1VUtCLCjyzowMDzhRWa9zwdtcVTni1nDxXJks4Go\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ELMuXetzSJd1gdrjYozJSlKBtCM6hS5dYKTfRxD0C-k\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"D4pZdDXMaxG4fIQiWSWQXlVcztgmdhrkcE8QY0ReHos\"}"
