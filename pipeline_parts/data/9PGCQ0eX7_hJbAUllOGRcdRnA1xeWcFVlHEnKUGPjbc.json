The mold crept down a steep bank to the dwindling creek, which gurgling in anticipation, disappeared beneath a stone almost at its feet. The light of Erebus surrounded it, diffuse, soft, an ocher of pale clay. Inexorable sight-lines of living bamboo, smooth and mottled trunks receding in every direction, motionless, filtered the light into an altered Reality. High above an unheard, unseen wind spoke to the figure only from the rumors of whispering leaves rustling and clinking high above as bamboo leaves do, as noisy as working chain.\\n\\nThe figure, in the /darkfield/, called itself Sloop. Sloop appeared as a slender, faceless humanoid youth, the chiaroscuro grey of the default avatar. No badges or tokens adorned it: this in itself was a caution to other careful players, as not only the fresh and inexperienced displayed no devices. Others who had shed the need to display their hard won devices also appeared at default settings. Sloop perhaps, was an Inexorable.\\n\\nSloop who was smooth and nude and genderless, neither wore nor carried anything to the moldy glade by the dwindling creek except a tablet of white light. The grey figure leaned back upon the hard remnant of a ragged tree stump. The pixelations of the stump could not be visualized until one was right upon them, a trick of perspective. The stump was hard and black, devoid and glossy as obsidian; still, it was the shattered wood of some ancient towering tree left forgotten, somehow surviving the overwriting of version after version. How far back the stump, and the creek, and the mold went, how many resets and updates of the game antedated them, Sloop did not know. Offering nothing more than a concealed and peaceful glade in the relative darkness of the ever present bamboo, it functioned as Sloopâ€™s eternal kingdom.\\n\\nThe glade did offer one important feature: strong connection to the Node. Sloop rested the tablet on a knee and tapped into the torrent . . . above, the wind sussed the leaves of bamboo in their trillions each against the other like the shicking of an infinity of naked blades.\",\"timestamp\":1633607030,\"title\":\"/Emphyria/\"},\"digest\":\"0GdNoVIqsGDQDXdnsCCR79a2-L_b45TbnMljMdaGTUI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3f78441292b95F346475e9aEf2649eBA5DcbF477\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MfxTj4dR8X3nlelVL5QaZ2cQ_1PVY-6xuBxjBRxBCPU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qVME2Qrti6MaQCUp0Qwd8BnPs2AsGLt8gjH4_Ycu3tA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"uC58qZzD9OCGjd2E6ebFyzD4gTsaoNS8EkU-40v6v4Ime2-Urwb_eBb9vnwyYtkmzC8WcsASZnRboTWE2kCnng\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x13a4e73b4f92ee5d2178ee087880d2dcea5f101fd2e6edc6e0aa963f962f2ffa12cc67225dff90b3b6f2b94c5de06996c342c1cc92d9e15edfa3808c13c6589f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MfxTj4dR8X3nlelVL5QaZ2cQ_1PVY-6xuBxjBRxBCPU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qVME2Qrti6MaQCUp0Qwd8BnPs2AsGLt8gjH4_Ycu3tA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"0GdNoVIqsGDQDXdnsCCR79a2-L_b45TbnMljMdaGTUI\"}"
