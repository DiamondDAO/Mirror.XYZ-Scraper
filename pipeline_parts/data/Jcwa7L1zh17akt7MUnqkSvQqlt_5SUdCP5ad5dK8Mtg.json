Jia said she had to sign the waiver, otherwise she would have been prevented from taking the jacket.\\n\\nWhen Jia spotted the logo defect and returned to the store, she was told she could not return the product and had to take the request to the upper levels of the company.\\n\\nThe Shanghai Consumer Protection Commission talked on Wednesday with the company's lawyer, senior customer service manager and the store manager of its IFC Mall branch in Shanghai, who claimed to be unclear about the \\\"exchange policy\\\" but confirmed that the 30-day return policy stated on the company's website did not apply to the Chinese mainland, the commission said in a news release.\\n\\nThe nonrefundable policy on the mainland was also confirmed by many media, including Beijing News and Shanghai Morning Post, who inquired at Canada Goose stores across the country.\\n\\nAt around 10 am on Wednesday, Canada Goose issued a statement on the Sina Weibo social media platform saying the company was aware of the case, and \\\"all products sold in specialized shops on the Chinese mainland can be refunded under the relevant laws and regulations\\\".\\n\\nMore than 1,000 netizens left comments on the company's Weibo account accusing it of a double standard and discriminating against Chinese consumers. Some even called for a boycott of its products.\",\"timestamp\":1638456147,\"title\":\"Canada Goose draws internet ire over refund policy\"},\"digest\":\"DXd8U0L8cIVu_MLZ5ULMN12Jfwd86FoDR8CLiTLX3zk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7dB175eeF2c0bC68e577d9FEb22893f14E395A31\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JT_SqjeT1I6Gjamc_IwDOdl9BACwi-No6r4mJl3oXWQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"RBC8QviWk16u8nF4nb_yCNHGHXnyt-03TphvRAQPWrA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"E3QfC17IenPejeuB5XfQ7l7xEJLaaxfS1kLuPP_zBtgydGTrChsD6fhaZO-FDgLZcGjgA4lotVAvzdpCZTSbzA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x3b2cdb4aa3b96d99aa1acfe53b1c2f67c9d1b11cfd8b2d33ffee3e638bd6959f016f225e08b0a2f326a7447f3f77db4979232e38acd144007d18b75bf93eb0e91c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JT_SqjeT1I6Gjamc_IwDOdl9BACwi-No6r4mJl3oXWQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"RBC8QviWk16u8nF4nb_yCNHGHXnyt-03TphvRAQPWrA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"DXd8U0L8cIVu_MLZ5ULMN12Jfwd86FoDR8CLiTLX3zk\"}"
