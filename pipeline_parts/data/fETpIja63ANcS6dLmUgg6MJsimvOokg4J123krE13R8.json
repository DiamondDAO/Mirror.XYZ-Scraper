"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"IntentionalDAO Light Paper\\n\\nWhen I went for my PDC, I stayed for a week at Wild Abundance near Asheville, NC.  I had read book upon book about permaculture, soil science, nutrition, etc, and I felt in my bones that I wanted to incorporate this stuff into my life.  A sustainable farm, a forest garden, an intentional community...it all sounded so magical.  However, it wasn’t until I was able to experience it in real life that it really struck home.  The magnitude of reconnecting with something deeper in myself, while simultaneously realizing that I was experiencing the solution to many of the world’s problems.  It’s such a different experience from conventional life that most would never consider it a practical option.  Composting human waste for fertilizer?  Letting children go barefoot through woods and gardens all day, being cared for in a communal, collaborative manner.  Actually taking time to coexist with the seasons, with nature.  And unplugging from the rat race while simultaneously staying hyper plugged into the science and politics of our changing climate.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nYet probably the single most impactful thing that occurred to me during those 10 days of nonstop education, countless personal epiphanies, and wonderful human connections, was the realization that the so many of the major problems in this world seemed to have a single solution:  \\n\\n \\n Let people experience this way of living.\\n\\n \\n The community. The sense of purpose. The connectedness to nature - a nature we are all a part of no matter how hard we try to deny it.  How do we get more people to a place like Wild Abundance?  How do we create more communities like this?  How do we incentivize these communities to invite the world into their lives?  And the question it all boils down to” How do we make it easier for people to take a step closer to living this kind of intentional life?\\n\\n \\n This is what I am convinced crypto can help with.  With the correct plan, I think we can simultaneously accomplish all of the following:\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n1. Attract investment to provide land for people to create sustainability-focused intentional communities. \\n2. Provide opportunities for the outside world to visit these places, where they can experience the magic that leads to a healthy planet.\\n3. Generate funding for new projects all over the world, so that the success of each project partially finances the next. \\n4. Generate a global community of like-minded people who can learn from one-another and coordinate outreach efforts, who are hyper focused on moving the project forward because of both a shared vision and the ability to earn income.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nThis light paper is my general idea of how we can accomplish this. \\n\\n \\n  \\n \\n\\nThe best crypto projects are the ones that figure out the cleverest incentives to keep people hyper-focused on what the project wants.  Take climate change: the world’s nations have the ability to force people to act responsibly, but they have fallen woefully short.  Nations are simply not incentivized to tackle a problem like this.  Nations compete for the biggest economy, the mightiest armies, the most territory.  Whatever needs to be done to keep those in power from losing it.  In a system like we have, green legislation remains purely altruistic until the vast majority of citizens put climate change at the top of their list of priorities.  \\n\\n \\n Cryptocurrency offers a system that can mobilize people outside of the confines of nation states. It can provide a straight-forward means for funding the goals of the community. And, last but not least, it can use incentives, written in computer code, to award investors in such a way as to force them to align with our values.  We can use capitalism against itself, and we can use greed to help protect the world. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nThe following is a list of four potential types of participants in our project. Next to each group, I list what will drive them to be a part of our project as well as what they will expect to get out of the deal.  All we have to do is figure out how to arrange things so that everyone gets what they want.\\n\\n \\n     Type of Participant             What They Want                  What They Offer \\n\\n1.

Speculative Investors        -Money                                         -Money\\n\\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n\\nLet’s take each category above:\\n\\n1. Inhabitants on the land.  \\n\\nWhen we raise the initial money to buy the land, the initial investors will decide where the land will be.  It will make sense to choose a location where we can hit the ground running.  If 5 of us live in Montana and can commit to moving to the land and starting a community, maybe we decide to buy the land in Montana.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nThese original land inhabitants (up to 5) will be given 500 Intentional Tokens in a wallet, but they will not be able to access these tokens for 1 year.  At any time, if one of these people act in ways inconsistent with our rules or values, the voting members of the DAO have the ability to slash ⅓ of their staked tokens.  After the 1 year vesting time is over, these people may unstake their tokens.  All unstaked tokens undergo a 1 week unlock period, after which time the token owner may sell the tokens or do whatever they want to with them.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nThey will also be given a structure to live in.  Ideally, we could set a time in the very beginning for all available DAO members to descend on the property and build a few tiny homes or natural structures or whatever we decide.   \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nThese intentional community members will be able to make money by creating a welcoming environment for people to come visit.  Overnight visitors to the land will not be guests so much as investors who are enjoying an experience on a property they helped fund.  The DAO will not be looking to make money off of these visits because the visitors will already be part of the DAO.  They will already have made their investment.  But they must still pay a small fee to be split among the inhabitants who will inevitably be responsible for cleaning up after people, etc.  This fee will be paid to the DAO in our native token to be distributed among the inhabitants (the reason for this will become clear further down).  Inhabitants can also make extra money by making meals for visitors, teaching classes, or anything else they can think of.  Just as long as what they do align with the values of the DAO.  This money does not have to go through the DAO and can be paid directly to the person providing the service.\\n\\n \\n \\n\\nAlso, a portion of the royalties from NFT sales will go towards the land inhabitants. More on this later.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nFinally, inhabitants will have the option to petition the DAO for business usage of land acreage.  For example, an inhabitant may start a farm and grow produce to sell to the public.  They would pay the DAO a monthly rent for their business use of the land and would keep any of the profits from the produce sale. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nEven though the inhabitants will be able to earn an income on the land, they will not be required to invest in the DAO (and therefore do not have to be a DAO member at first).  In order to become a new inhabitant, they must be approved by the current land inhabitants by a ⅔ minimum vote.  The income these members earn (by the means listed above) will be locked up in a staking contract until they earn at least 500 tokens.  After they hit the 500 mark, anything above that will go directly to their wallet, unstaked and free to use in any way they see fit. The 500 staked tokens will be their collateral, at risk of being slashed if they don’t abide by the DAO rules.  Any time a land inhabitant has less than 500 tokens staked, their earned tokens will be locked until they hit this 500 mark.\\n\\n \\n \\n\\nTo summarize: \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nWhat the land inhabitants get from their participation in the project:\\n\\n1. Land to build an intentional community\\n2. The right to direct who joins their community (they don’t have a say over who joins the DAO - just the on-land community. More discussion of this below).\\n3. A potential income\\n4. A means to petition the DAO for money to fund projects they want to undertake\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n    What the DAO members gets from the land inhabitants:\\n\\n1. An intentional community that they can visit and be a real part of\\n2. Potential return on their investment\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n    The intentional community members will be the beating heart of our project.  We want \\n\\nto keep them happy.  We will offer them income, a place to live, a chance to build a community and pursue their passions, and a membership in the DAO so they can take part in treasury and governance decisions.  What the DAO asks in return is that they provide a welcoming and educational environment for people who visit, and that they uphold our ideals of sustainability, acceptance, and whatever else we decide on as a group.  \\n\\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n\\n2\\\\.   DAO Members.\\n\\nThe DAO members are basically responsible for everything outside of day-to-day operations on the land.  They decide how the treasury is spent.  They decide on updates to the smart contract.  They vote on proposals made by DAO members and land inhabitants alike.  They are also responsible for deciding what privileges come from staking tokens and whether someone’s tokens should be slashed for an infraction of our rules or values.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nIn order to be a member of the DAO, someone must stake 250 Intentional Tokens.  As with land owners, the rest of the DAO can decide (by ⅔ majority vote) to slash ⅓ of these tokens if the DAO member is found to be acting irresponsibly or maliciously.  (This is explained in detail in the “staking” section of the white paper.)  DAO members will be incentivized to participate in votes and governance by the potential to earn a yield on their staked investment.  This yield will come from a 1% inflation rate per year of all tokens in existence. Each member will only get one vote, no matter how many tokens they have bought or staked.  We can ensure this by a decentralized, anonymous identity verification like BrightID.  More money may equal more privileges in this project (up to a point), but will not equal more power.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nThe DAO members have the responsibility of keeping up the social contract outlined in this document.  They will be expected to responsibly manage the treasury.  They will be charged with approving or rejecting proposals that cost money, and also making sure that the money is spent prudently.  They will want to help the land inhabitants create a rich community, and also to make sure that the project is attractive to outsiders who may want to invest. They will benefit monetarily from the success of the project, so they will be incentivized to market it to the world.  Hopefully we end up with members who can create a website, generate video content, print T-shirts, and on and on. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nDAO members also have the opportunity to stay on the land whenever they like, but must pay a small fee which will go to the land inhabitants who may be responsible for cleaning up any messes left behind or resetting a cabin (changing beds, etc).  The fee will be enough to make it worth the time of the land inhabitants, but much lower than a regular hotel stay because the land and cabins will already be paid for.  This is basically akin to an owner staying on their own property.  \\n\\n \\n  \\n \\n\\n3\\\\.     People who are curious.\\n\\n    If we were a company, these people would be our target market. These are the people who we want to expose to our way of existing in the world, in hopes that we rub off on them.  Our goal is to influence them to make better choices in their day-to-day lives, and to learn that a sustainable life is not unattainable. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nThey, in turn, want to experience a fulfilling, sustainable life, if only for a short time. \\n\\nThey will pay for this privilege, which will help us further our endeavors.   \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n    One way to go about this would be to charge a nightly fee.  However, I think we should take it a bit further.  Instead of viewing these people as customers, we should take them into the fold.  We are not a hotel, and we are not in the business of catering to needy customers.  We are a community of people, joined by the common goal of doing our part to help the planet, ourselves, and each other.  If they want to experience life with us, they have to join us.  I think this is a very attractive idea for several reasons, not least of which has to do with my disdain for the invisible curtain between patrons and entertainers.  At the Ren Faire, I always wanted to find a way to stay after hours and hang out with the fire-eaters, drinking tankards of meade around a campfire and really getting to know the people behind the characters they played.  But it would only be worthwhile if I was accepted as a part of the community - not a paying customer.  I would have jumped through all sorts of hoops for that sort of authentic experience - learned how to juggle knives, studied Olde English, whatever.  And this is what I believe people will do to experience the life we will create.  Our only requirement is that they become a member of the DAO and follow our community’s rules. The rest, they can absorb by taking part in our online community (if they desire) and by experiencing the intentional community.\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n    Specifically, these visitors will have to buy an NFT which gives them the right to spend the night.  These NFTs will give them the same land-use rights as a voting DAO member (but they will not be voting members unless they buy and stake 250 of our tokens.)  This is kind of like buying “preferred stock” in a company, which makes them part-owner but doesn’t give them voting rights.  They can stay on the land, along with up to two other people, for a low fee that will go to the land inhabitants as was noted in the section above on DAO members. The cabins we have will be rentable on a first-come-first-serve basis.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nBased on the popularity of staying on the land, these NFTs may rise in value.  I propose that if we start off with 3 cabins that belong to the DAO (which are separate from the structures built for thas the third cabin can also be used by NFT-holders (voting members should have extra perks, right?).  If an NFT holder isn’t able to secure a cabin, they will always have the privilege to camp on the land.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nOne incredible thing about NFTs is that they are programable to give royalties back to the creator any time they are sold.  When someone sells one of these NFTs, 10% of that sale will go back to the DAO.  Of this 10%, half will be burned (to help offset the 1% inflation given to voting DAO members), and half will go into our treasury.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nIf the land owners want more money to do more dope shit, they can make sure visitors have a good time, which drives up the value of our tokens and the land-use NFT’s, which increases the value of the tokens inside the treasury and also adds more money to the treasury. It will also incentivize the DAO members to schedule more work weeks to build more cabins so we can sell more NFTs.  It can all be a grand upward spiral.  (I also have an idea for a grand party that’s a mix between Burning Man, Ren Faire, and a work-trade week to drum up interest in our project and generate a lot of income for both our project and people in the local community.  No room for that idea in this paper, though.)\\n\\n \\n  \\n \\n\\n4\\\\.    Speculative Investors\\n\\nSpeculative investors are the most straightforward as far as what they want and what \\n\\nthey give.  It’s all about money.  The great thing about crypto is that we can set things up so that the best way to make money is to come into our realm and play by our rules.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nThere will be two ways to make money.  First, an investor can buy     our tokens and hold them, hoping that the value will go up.  These people will not partake in our governance, but they will drive the price of our tokens up, allowing us to raise more money for our project.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nSecond, an investor can become a voting DAO member and earn a portion of the 1% inflation.  The majority of this inflation yield will be distributed evenly among voting members each day.  In order to be eligible, a member must have voted on one of the last two proposals.  Each time a member votes, they must post a comment along with their vote.  The comment can be very short, but it should prove that they understood the situation and voted with the ideals of the project in mind.  The protocol will award anyone who votes and comments (20 characters minimum) by depositing the daily yield into their wallet. The catch is that every DAO member can view every comment.  If someone is writing gibberish just to get the yield, the other DAO members will be able to slash ⅓ of their 250 staked tokens.  (Whenever someone is slashed, their remaining tokens are immediately unlocked.  They may then choose to restake if they wish.) \\n\\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n\\nInitial funding of the project\\n\\n \\n \\n\\nOur initial funding will come from the sale of an Initial Investment token.  We’ll start off with 300,000 of them.  These tokens will be the precursor to our DAO tokens but much simpler because all we need is something that proves a person’s investment.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nOnce we have enough money to start the DAO, it will be time to write the code, buy the land, issue our actual tokens in exchange for the investor tokens, build some cabins, and set aside some money for our next sister project.  I’ll unpack that sentence a little more:  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nWe will mint 300,000 tokens in the beginning.  We need to figure out how to go about this to maximize our initial treasury.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nThe treasury will be separated into multiple baskets:\\n\\n1. $50,000 to build cabins, yurts, etc. for the use of DAO members, NFT-holders\\n2. $30,000 to cover the legal fees of purchasing the land and setting up the DAO LLC\\n3. $30,000 to invest in a sister project just like this one (this is how to pay it forward and create a network of these all over the world)\\n4. $30,000 to use as a cushion for the legal fees, taxes, unforeseen expenses\\n5. $30,000 to compensate coders that build the smart contract (maybe we can do this in-house and just pay with our tokens), and to pay for a smart contract audit. We will also need someone to make a website and ideally a video or two to put on YouTube.\\n6. The rest of the money will go to buy the land. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nWhen the code is written, we will mint 1 million DAO tokens.  Each initial investor can trade in their tokens for DAO tokens at a rate of 1:1.  That takes care of 300,000 of the 1 million tokens.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n2500 tokens will be doled out to the first 5 land inhabitants, whom the DAO will decide on by vote.  These will probably come from the initial pool of investors, but don’t have to.  Each of the inhabitants will receive 500 tokens, locked for a year as mentioned above.\\n\\n \\n \\n\\nThe other 697,500 tokens will be kept in the DAO treasury and only released by consent of the voting DAO members.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nIn order to raise some more money in the beginning, we will sell 450 NFTs in a bid-to-earn auction.  In this form of auction, anyone who gets outbid receives a small portion of the winning bid.  It’s a fun way to have an auction where everyone who bids either wins an NFT or some money.  \\n\\nThen we will have 50 NFTs that aren’t sold, but that we can give to people who either helped with the project or who we just want to donate something cool to.\\n\\nWe should talk about what these NFTs should look like. They should look super dope.  But these are the NFTs that give land access, and also will fund our project in the future as we will receive royalties every time they are traded on the market.  \\n\\n \\n  \\n \\n\\nAnother important thing we will do as soon as actual DAO tokens are released (which will unlock the ability to vote) is to vote on initial rules.  These will act as sort of our initial commandments, will require ⅔ majority to pass, and will require a ⅔ majority vote in the future to overturn.  These should be rules that we feel very strongly about, that can act as a sort of litmus test for people who will consider whether or not to join our project.  I am thinking of things like “⅔ of the land will be set aside in the beginning as natural forest that cannot be developed,” or “synthetic pesticides and herbicides can never be used.”  People who break these rules can have their tokens slashed or they can also be banned from ever coming back to the land.  \\n\\n \\n  \\n \\n\\nOnce the project gets going, we will need ways to incentivize people to perform various crucial tasks, like meeting with government inspectors and filing the DAO’s taxes.  This is all spelled out in the white paper, but basically we will give a portion of the 1% inflation to the people who take on these tasks, so the entire 1% inflation will not go to the voting DAO members.  \\n\\n \\n  \\n \\n\\nThanks for reading this general overview of the Intentional DAO project.  For a more in depth look at the hows and whys of governance, refer to the white paper (which I need to revise, but that’s coming soon). \\n\\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \",\"timestamp\":1639285786,\"title\":\"An Intentional Community Dao\"},\"digest\":\"0YMdQ8GdV0EWGYJAn1XBtPNnld7Yvo6W7yEtZFCGmNk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xbe0284A4a260dF4c58eEc491d41995CeEe3Fac58\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qwZ-BERBlddndHSt6eJ_4PFYBC0BX56BjtBDsc4FkZ8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"h2iwP6KyhRrT6Mk46Q19Iv3muZeD9UeiQgCAxVkJlcU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"I4rR_kMew-tO6SotvJIm3G5sDyE37dMw6jJuCKat1M-y5iEqyzdFo-X8MwI2b1pPVp0PjqHyEzKrD8-U3jMZxA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x3bf8d6a2c583a053d9b0f43957048dbdfb1fa970b1123a3d2400ae2369214da27c40d0427e9546484deaf0ceda5f718b01f0452794837dbe6239e43e577a37721c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qwZ-BERBlddndHSt6eJ_4PFYBC0BX56BjtBDsc4FkZ8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"h2iwP6KyhRrT6Mk46Q19Iv3muZeD9UeiQgCAxVkJlcU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"0YMdQ8GdV0EWGYJAn1XBtPNnld7Yvo6W7yEtZFCGmNk\"}"
