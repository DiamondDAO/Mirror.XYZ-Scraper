Non-Duality\\n\\n**“No tree, it is said, can grow to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell.”**\\n\\n(*Carl Jung*)[\\\\[2\\\\]](#_ftn2)\\n\\nThe experimental ethical framework proposed in this book focuses on making justifiable relative ethical decisions, within the constraints required for actions that are consistent with and required for the proper functioning of the whole ethical system. It fosters the maximal compatible (safe) diversity of ethical relativism.\\n\\n![Newton Disc \\\\[3\\\\]](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DVxBgJ-Y205V0tEpsp1-K.png?height=760&width=2078&&&size=medium)\\n\\nA ‘Newton disc’ or spinning colour wheel illustrates how colour is made up of a unitary oneness, that is, white light. In the concluding chapter we will consider what is meant by an absolute (invariant) or objective ethical core as the centre of a system of maximum consistent (compossible) ethical relativism.\\n\\nIt seems ironic that the proposed framework is founded on universality or invariance and yet proposes maximum ethical relativism. However, if we consider the invariance or ultimate ‘truth’ to be the white light (life energy) and the ethical degrees of freedom to be relative colours (appearance) on the wheel (life-forms), it is easier to understand.\\n\\nThe apparent contradictions are a particular problem arising from a strong dualistic tendency in Western culture, and particularly in over-simplistic monotheistic religions.[\\\\[4\\\\]](#_ftn4) Non-dualistic thinking teaches that:\\n\\n**“the multiplicity of the universe is reducible to one essential reality.”**\\n\\n[\\\\[5\\\\]](#_ftn5)\\n\\nNon-dualism even requires its apparent opposite: dualistic thinking. When all perspectives are allowed their particular uses, together they get closer to expressing the ineffable nature of reality. Einstein’s understanding of the equivalence of matter and energy is so powerful because it sees through appearances to the underlying unity of matter and energy — whereas much of Western thought is and has been plagued by a tendency to treat different aspects of reality as essentially divided (e.g., mind–body separation).\\n\\nLet us not beat around the burning bush; the attempt to separate mind and body (and label one good or holy and one bad or evil) has given rise to some unspeakable evils by sapients. In the reckoning of our history of teaching love and compassion for one another, it has been perhaps the greatest error of thought and the greatest act of ‘sin’ perpetuated by Western religion.\\n\\n![(Mary Oliver)\\\\[6\\\\]](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*HzHBYzF8ZSuqd7sxrv5nlw.png)\\n\\nIn Buddhism, non-duality is:\\n\\n**“associated with the concept of emptiness (śūnyatā): and the two truths doctrine, particularly the Madhyamaka teaching of the non-duality of absolute and relative truth … The [śūnyatā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunyata) doctrine is an attempt to show that it is neither proper nor strictly justifiable to regard any metaphysical system as absolutely valid. It doesn’t lead to nihilism but strikes a middle course between excessive naivete and excessive scepticism.”[\\\\[7\\\\]](#_ftn7)**\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nThe ‘hard’ scientists and the mind scientists of old are essentially saying the same thing. We must always bring some holistic assessment and judgements to gain insight into our understanding of the nature of things.\\n\\nThe systems and processes that give us life, life-forms, logic and reason are not entirely hermetic and self-evidential solely within their own frame of reference. We must synthesise across different fields of enquiry using diverse means if we are to understand the complexity, chaos and harmony of the universe.\\n\\nIn Taoism, we have the concepts of yin and yang, which embody the unitary nature of the appearance of relative things. In simple terms, without night there is no day; without death there is no life; without energy there is no matter; without some suffering there is no wisdom.\\n\\n**“the concept of oneness would instantly perish without its counterpart ‘duality.’ Both are provisional concepts … true non-duality is … beyond oneness.”**[\\\\[8\\\\]](#_ftn8)\\n\\nEven non-dualism is a provisional understanding. Take the yin–yang symbol; you can see this by considering that both yin and yang include and define one another, but that together they express a oneness that is still separated from (i.e., does not contain) the greater space around it. There are no shortcuts to infinity.\\n\\n![“Black and White Yin Yang Symbol”, Wikipedia, John Langdon, CC BY-SA 3.0](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cXzTghGS19F6JQoW9Cnhh.png?height=480&width=480)\\n\\n**“Yin and yang complement one another. In the same way, the purpose of non-dual mindfulness isn’t to eradicate duality. The purpose is to recognize that duality, or the appearance of separation, has an unconditional place within life, or undivided wholeness.”**[\\\\[9\\\\]](#_ftn9)\\n\\nA circle (in three dimensions, a sphere) is the strongest shape, known to be able to withstand great pressure or force (when applied equally). That is because it distributes force equally across its whole boundary; as we know, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.\\n\\nThe sphere is therefore found everywhere in nature as the strongest 3D shape.[\\\\[10\\\\]](#_ftn10) Perhaps the formal similarity between a circle and a zero (0) is accidental — they do not appear to have the same linguistic root (etymology) — yet it is interesting that the concepts of wholeness and emptiness reflect one another in their shape.\\n\\nUnderneath the appearance of all things — the interplay of time and space, energy and matter, order and chaos, knowledge and entropy — there is a unity of zero[\\\\[11\\\\]](#_ftn11) and one (emptiness and fullness).\\n\\nTheories of cosmic cycles point this way, too, with the end of this universal epoch likely resulting in a re-collapse of the great sphere or ellipse of the universe back to a singularity before a new grand epoch begins again. Alternatively, we live in a fractal multiverse where each end of space-time here in this universe (every black hole) is a singularity for another universe. Ends are, after all, also beginnings.\\n\\n![William Blake, “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell”, 1794 CE, Wikipedia.org, public domain.](https://miro.medium.com/max/886/1\\\\*NuqXO8EQdk7JdbpwhRxbew.jpeg)\\n\\n**“Unlike those of Milton and Dante, Blake’s conception of Hell begins not as a place of punishment, but as a source of unrepressed, somewhat Dionysian energy, opposed to the authoritarian and regulated perception of Heaven.**\\n\\n**Blake’s purpose is to create what he called a ‘memorable fancy’ in order to reveal the repressive nature of conventional morality and institutional religion”**[\\\\[12\\\\]](#_ftn12)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nWithout darkness, the brightness would be a blindness. Nothing can grow without shadow and shade. For heaven, we need hell.[\\\\[13\\\\]](#_ftn13) For angels, we need demons. *For a new Eden on Earth, this species slaughterhouse?*\\n\\nWe must not let prior wrongdoing (unskilful mind and action) dissuade us or lead to ethical dissolution or weakened resolve. If we do, the absence of free will lead us to despair — to the belief that we have no freedom of action to evolve, adapt and change with changing conditions and experiences.\\n\\nThere is always the possibility of some freedom, but it takes dedication and sacrifice. It likely involves some risks. We need to be willing to fail and try again. If meaningful change (deviation) was easy, we would have free will. Blake tried to show that we must not label these dark energies as other or as being outside ourselves. We need to incorporate the dark and the light into a wholeness.\\n\\n**“The ancient Poets animated all sensible objects with Gods or Geniuses, calling them by the names and adorning them with the properties of woods, rivers, mountains, lakes, cities, nations, and whatever their enlarged & numerous senses could perceive[\\\\[14\\\\]](#_ftn14) … Thus men forgot that All deities reside in the human breast.”**\\n\\n(*William Blake*)[\\\\[15\\\\]](#_ftn15)\\n\\n![Ma Yuan, “Walking on Path in Spring”, 1190 CE, Wikipedia, public domain.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zWScBwGOjQpJsnX2xODU1.png?height=1110&width=1759&&&size=medium)\\n\\n![The Tao \\\\[16\\\\]](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1PcctL1BHwCNHx-SdEYA0.png?height=860&width=1594&&&size=medium)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\ncontinued in:\\n\\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x6e2fBc139e37b43f4F29cC10B7BeDe36587f7306/M3hVZ864pYz8aGGQvd2KUXRLkr-VPFVAqklrGaQQQzQ](https://mirror.xyz/0x6e2fBc139e37b43f4F29cC10B7BeDe36587f7306/M3hVZ864pYz8aGGQvd2KUXRLkr-VPFVAqklrGaQQQzQ)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n[\\\\[1\\\\]](#_ftnref1) Douglas Adams, *The* *Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*, 1978 CE.
