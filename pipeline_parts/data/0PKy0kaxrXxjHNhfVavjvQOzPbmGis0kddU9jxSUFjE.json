"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"[Protein Community](http://www.proteincommunity.xyz) is a place where people and ideas grow. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since we [launched our $PRTN token](https://protein.mirror.xyz/PiJ8OK6g4DQvlaYRdbl00fUDhlaQRGAsYhaB_WkCk08) with an awesome panel on [‚Äú](https://soundcloud.com/proteincommunity/prtn-launch-good-growth-panel)*[What is good growth?](https://soundcloud.com/proteincommunity/prtn-launch-good-growth-panel)*[‚Äù](https://soundcloud.com/proteincommunity/prtn-launch-good-growth-panel) featuring [Sirsu](https://twitter.com/sirsuhayb), [Priyanka Kanse,](https://twitter.com/pristyles) [Claire Yurika](https://www.instagram.com/thehaipriestxss/) and [Sterling Proffer](https://twitter.com/sdproffer). A lot has happened since then, so keeping to our core value of *building in the open*, we thought we‚Äôd share our journey so far ...\\n\\n**Why question Growth?**\\n\\nFor many, the Web2 models for *growth* have become exploitative and extractive, often at the expense of the user or communities who the product claims to represent and serve. While Web3 has the potential to create a fairer and more equitable framework for *growth*, it‚Äôs what we do with it which ultimately dictates the impact it has on society.\\n\\nSo, if Protein Community is a place for people and ideas to grow, it's important to explore the different models of *growth* which are both positive and negative for society today. And before we can start exploring how Web3 technologies can be used for *good growth*; we need to explore what *good* and *bad growth* means to our community.\\n\\n**Workshop #1 - What is Good Growth?**\\n\\nInspired by the thoughts, ideas and conversations from the $PRTN launch, our first workshop asked ‚ÄúWhat is Good Growth?‚Äù We opened up the Miro the day before to give our Founder Members time to go in and add suggestions, especially if they weren‚Äôt able to make the session. \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ecTcZJgzxhSgdZJiWhYru.jpeg?height=1080&width=1920)\\n\\nThe live workshop was then split into two major questions, with 3 prompts and ran for an hour. We asked ‚Ä¶\\n\\n**What is Bad Growth?**\\n\\n1. *Bad Growth is‚Ä¶*\\n2. *Examples of bad growth are‚Ä¶*\\n3. *Bad growth for Protein Community is‚Ä¶*\\n\\n**What is Good Growth?**\\n\\n1. *Good growth is‚Ä¶*\\n2. *Examples of good growth are‚Ä¶*\\n3. *Good growth for Protein Community is‚Ä¶*\\n\\nCollaboratively we tackled each section with 10 minutes of sharing, a few minutes of voting, 10 minutes discussing the key recurring ideas as well as a really healthy backchannel of which those at the session felt most passionate about.\\n\\n[Explore the board here¬†](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lxGFEMk=/)\\n\\nFollowing the event, we gave our community 24 hours to show their thoughts through emoji voting. From this, the core team explored, discussed, consolidated and grouped the ideas shared into key takeaways. The workshop was consolidated and formed into 12 ideas/concepts, which were grouped into 3 areas: Structure, Approach and Outcome.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wP14mQkmHFW1ObQFGAyDo.jpeg?height=1080&width=1920)\\n\\nWhile this framework will continue to grow and change with the Protein Community, these words are our first iteration of defining *good growth*, laying the foundations for how we can manifest *good growth* for our community internally and externally.\\n\\nIn our next update, we‚Äôll be sharing workshop #2, *Manifesting Good Growth* where we challenged and stress tested these words by asking two big questions:\\n\\n1. What's the first thing we can do on our path to *good growth*?\\n2. How can Web3 enable *good growth*?\\n\\nGot some thoughts on these and want to get involved? Reach out on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/protein) to get involved.\\n\\n*We‚Äôd like to thank all the contributors to the first workshop;*\\n\\n@anaroman @priy @faith @kesinkersole @phantanz @fancy @gustavo @algoriddims @jaybrave @herbalteagyal @raz @keeevin @faith @shalpern @sterling @yuri @iainait @O'Pl√©rou @willprotein and to everyone who attended the $PRTN launch event!\\n\\ngm, ga, gn üå± ‚ú®\",\"timestamp\":1633034451,\"title\":\"Our journey so far...\",\"publication\":\"protein\"},\"digest\":\"l8g90MgmodJe6I-yScw1hG8pDkrhLNFrep4fTEKKI9Q\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2bbF34c5EAf9498c88c9d1cd04F3885da53670B1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"l0ZEPspQA-7tZX-FS2bE9r3hZJqt6g7z3jjGO85ZyrU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"W-yhZRY9sJ6WYW5hKcLN-9Jw0g8W2EeFW0pBwhCFeYc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"zvYBNwQOXWb1bUm00RYxvDlY4vLW54YVN3f3nIcgvDJrYR1MDlvh-5_D6uNDyY5-dA2xhPeHpgVLAncdQ3tOCw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb25c7c45c087b2aa2f6affbceb39988df0a31edaf367b31d9132679cb09869a0362c31593c604525ab28391f6a84a825f5bdad3136efff399eb2fa697165d13a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on protein.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"l0ZEPspQA-7tZX-FS2bE9r3hZJqt6g7z3jjGO85ZyrU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"W-yhZRY9sJ6WYW5hKcLN-9Jw0g8W2EeFW0pBwhCFeYc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"iEKJT-ZdPmmz0DubFc4SZVAb8i5ysekvNj-ltArgqeU\"}"
