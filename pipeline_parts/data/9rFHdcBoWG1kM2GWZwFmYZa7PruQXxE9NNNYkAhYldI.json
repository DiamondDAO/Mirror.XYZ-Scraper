"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The night was clear and cold; countless stars blinked in the black vault overhead; the pale moon cast its wintry light down on a white and frozen world. As the runners glided swiftly and smoothly onward showers of dry snow like fine powder flew from under the horses' hoofs and soon whitened the black-robed figures in the sleds. The way led down the hill past the Fort, over the creek bridge and along the road that skirted the Black Forest. The ride was long; it led up and down hills, and through a lengthy stretch of gloomy forest. Sometimes the drivers walked the horses up a steep climb and again raced them along a level bottom. Making a turn in the road they saw a bright light in the distance which marked their destination. In five minutes the horses dashed into a wide clearing. An immense log fire burned in front of a two-story structure. Streams of light poured from the small windows; the squeaking of fiddles, the shuffling of many feet, and gay laughter came through the open door.\\n\\nThe steaming horses were unhitched, covered carefully with robes and led into sheltered places, while the merry party disappeared into the house.\\n\\nThe occasion was the celebration of the birthday of old Dan Watkins' daughter. Dan was one of the oldest settlers along the river; in fact, he had located his farm several years after Col. Zane had founded the settlement. He was noted for his open-handed dealing and kindness of heart. He had loaned many a head of cattle which had never been returned, and many a sack of flour had left his mill unpaid for in grain. He was a good shot, he would lay a tree on the ground as quickly as any man who ever swung an axe, and he could drink more whiskey than any man in the valley.\\n\\nDan stood at the door with a smile of welcome upon his rugged features and a handshake and a pleasant word for everyone. His daughter Susan greeted the men with a little curtsy and kissed the girls upon the cheek. Susan was not pretty, though she was strong and healthy; her laughing blue eyes assured a sunny disposition, and she numbered her suitors by the score.\\n\\nThe young people lost no time. Soon the floor was covered with their whirling forms.\\n\\nIn one corner of the room sat a little dried-up old woman with white hair and bright dark eyes. This was Grandma Watkins. She was very old, so old that no one knew her age, but she was still vigorous enough to do her day's work with more pleasure than many a younger woman. Just now she was talking to Wetzel, who leaned upon his inseparable rifle and listened to her chatter. The hunter liked the old lady and would often stop at her cabin while on his way to the settlement and leave at her door a fat turkey or a haunch of venison.\\n\\n\\\"Lew Wetzel, I am ashamed of you.\\\" Grandmother Watkins was saying. \\\"Put that gun in the corner and get out there and dance. Enjoy yourself. You are only a boy yet.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'd better look on, mother,\\\" answered the hunter.\\n\\n\\\"Pshaw! You can hop and skip around like any of then and laugh too if you want. I hope that pretty sister of Eb Zane has caught your fancy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She is not for the like of me,\\\" he said gently \\\"I haven't the gifts.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't talk about gifts. Not to an old woman who has lived three times and more your age,\\\" she said impatiently. \\\"It is not gifts a woman wants out here in the West. If she does 'twill do her no good. She needs a strong arm to build cabins, a quick eye with a rifle, and a fearless heart. What border-women want are houses and children. They must bring up men, men to drive the redskins back, men to till the soil, or else what is the good of our suffering here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are right,\\\" said Wetzel thoughtfully. \\\"But I'd hate to see a flower like Betty Zane in a rude hunter's cabin.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have known the Zanes for forty year' and I never saw one yet that was afraid of work. And you might win her if you would give up running mad after Indians. I'll allow no woman would put up with that. You have killed many Indians. You ought to be satisfied.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Fightin' redskins is somethin' I can't help,\\\" said the hunter, slowly shaking his head. \\\"If I got married the fever would come on and I'd leave home. No, I'm no good for a woman. Fightin' is all I'm good for.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why not fight for her, then? Don't let one of these boys walk off with her. Look at her. She likes fun and admiration. I believe you do care for her. Why not try to win her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who is that tall man with her?\\\" continued the old lady as Wetzel did not answer. \\\"There, they have gone into the other room. Who is he?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"His name is Miller.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lewis, I don't like him. I have been watching him all evening. I'm a contrary old woman, I know, but I have seen a good many men in my time, and his face is not honest. He is in love with her. Does she care for him?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, Betty doesn't care for Miller. She's just full of life and fun.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You may be mistaken. All the Zanes are fire and brimstone and this girl is a Zane clear through. Go and fetch her to me, Lewis. I'll tell you if there's a chance for you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dear mother, perhaps there's a wife in Heaven for me. There's none on earth,\\\" said the hunter, a sad smile flitting over his calm face.\\n\\nRalfe Miller, whose actions had occasioned the remarks of the old lady, would have been conspicuous in any assembly of men. There was something in his dark face that compelled interest and yet left the observer in doubt. His square chin, deep-set eyes and firm mouth denoted a strong and indomitable will. He looked a man whom it would be dangerous to cross.\\n\\nLittle was known of Miller's history. He hailed from Ft. Pitt, where he had a reputation as a good soldier, but a man of morose and quarrelsome disposition. It was whispered that he drank, and that he had been friendly with the renegades McKee, Elliott, and Girty. He had passed the fall and winter at Ft. Henry, serving on garrison duty. Since he had made the acquaintance of Betty he had shown her all the attention possible.\\n\\nOn this night a close observer would have seen that Miller was laboring under some strong feeling. A half-subdued fire gleamed from his dark eyes. A peculiar nervous twitching of his nostrils betrayed a poorly suppressed excitement.\\n\\nAll evening he followed Betty like a shadow. Her kindness may have encouraged him. She danced often with him end showed a certain preference for his society. Alice and Lydia were puzzled by Betty's manner. As they were intimate friends they believed they knew something of her likes and dislikes. Had not Betty told them she did not care for Mr. Miller? What was the meaning of the arch glances she bestowed upon him, if she did not care for him? To be sure, it was nothing wonderful for Betty to smile,--she was always prodigal of her smiles--but she had never been known to encourage any man. The truth was that Betty had put her new resolution into effect; to be as merry and charming as any fancy-free maiden could possibly be, and the farthest removed from a young lady pining for an absent and indifferent sweetheart. To her sorrow Betty played her part too well.\\n\\nExcept to Wetzel, whose keen eyes little escaped, there was no significance in Miller's hilarity one moment and sudden thoughtfulness the next. And if there had been, it would have excited no comment. Most of the young men had sampled some of old Dan's best rye and their flushed faces and unusual spirits did not result altogether from the exercise of the dance.\\n\\nAfter one of the reels Miller led Betty, with whom be had been dancing, into one of the side rooms. Round the dimly lighted room were benches upon which were seated some of the dancers. Betty was uneasy in mind and now wished that she had remained at home. They had exchanged several commonplace remarks when the music struck up and Betty rose quickly to her feet.\\n\\n\\\"See, the others have gone. Let us return,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Wait,\\\" said Miller hurriedly. \\\"Do not go just yet. I wish to speak to you. I have asked you many times if you will marry me. Now I ask you again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Miller, I thanked you and begged you not to cause us both pain by again referring to that subject,\\\" answered Betty with dignity. \\\"If you will persist in bringing it up we cannot be friends any longer.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Wait, please wait. I have told you that I will not take 'No' for an answer. I love you with all my heart and soul and I cannot give you up.\\\"\\n\\nHis voice was low and hoarse and thrilled with a strong man's passion. Betty looked up into his face and tears of compassion filled her eyes. Her heart softened to this man, and her conscience gave her a little twinge of remorse. Could she not have averted all this? No doubt she had been much to blame, and this thought made her voice very low and sweet as she answered him.\\n\\n\\\"I like you as a friend, Mr. Miller, but we can never be more than friends. I am very sorry for you, and angry with myself that I did not try to help you instead of making it worse. Please do not speak of this again. Come, let us join the others.\\\"\\n\\nThey were quite alone in the room. As Betty finished speaking and started for the door Miller intercepted her. She recoiled in alarm from his white face.\\n\\n\\\"No, you don't go yet. I won't give you up so easily. No woman can play fast and loose with me! Do you understand? What have you meant all this winter? You encouraged me. You know you did,\\\" he cried passionately.\\n\\n\\\"I thought you were a gentleman. I have really taken the trouble to defend you against persons who evidently were not misled as to your real nature. I will not listen to you,\\\" said Betty coldly. She turned away from him, all her softened feeling changed to scorn.\\n\\n\\\"You shall listen to me,\\\" he whispered as he grasped her wrist and pulled her backward. All the man's brutal passion had been aroused. The fierce border blood boiled within his heart. Unmasked he showed himself in his true colors a frontier desperado. His eyes gleamed dark and lurid beneath his bent brows and a short, desperate laugh passed his lips.\\n\\n\\\"I will make you love me, my proud beauty. I shall have you yet, one way or another.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let me go. How dare you touch me!\\\" cried Betty, the hot blood coloring her face. She struck him a stinging blow with her free hand and struggled with all her might to free herself; but she was powerless in his iron grasp. Closer he drew her.\\n\\n\\\"If it costs me my life I will kiss you for that blow,\\\" he muttered hoarsely.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, you coward! you ruffian! Release me or I will scream.\\\"\\n\\nShe had opened her lips to call for help when she saw a dark figure cross the threshold. She recognized the tall form of Wetzel. The hunter stood still in the doorway for a second and then with the swiftness of light he sprang forward. The single straightening of his arm sent Miller backward over a bench to the floor with a crashing sound. Miller rose with some difficulty and stood with one hand to his head.\\n\\n\\\"Lew, don't draw your knife,\\\" cried Betty as she saw Wetzel's hand go inside his hunting shirt. She had thrown herself in front of him as Miller got to his feet. With both little hands she clung to the brawny arm of the hunter, but she could not stay it. Wetzel's hand slipped to his belt.\\n\\n\\\"For God's sake, Lew, do not kill him,\\\" implored Betty, gazing horror-stricken at the glittering eyes of the hunter. \\\"You have punished him enough. He only tried to kiss me. I was partly to blame. Put your knife away. Do not shed blood. For my sake, Lew, for my sake!\\\"\\n\\nWhen Betty found that she could not hold Wetzel's arm she threw her arms round his neck and clung to him with all her young strength. No doubt her action averted a tragedy. If Miller had been inclined to draw a weapon then he might have had a good opportunity to use it. He had the reputation of being quick with his knife, and many of his past fights testified that he was not a coward. But he made no effort to attack Wetzel. It was certain that he measured with his eye the distance to the door. Wetzel was not like other men. Irrespective of his wonderful strength and agility there was something about the Indian hunter that terrified all men. Miller shrank before those eyes. He knew that never in all his life of adventure had he been as near death as at that moment. There was nothing between him and eternity but the delicate arms of this frail girl. At a slight wave of the hunter's hand towards the door he turned and passed out.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, how dreadful!\\\" cried Betty, dropping upon a bench with a sob of relief. \\\"I am glad you came when you did even though you frightened me more than he did. Promise me that you will not do Miller any further harm. If you had fought it would all have been on my account; one or both of you might have been killed. Don't look at me so. I do not care for him. I never did. Now that I know him I despise him. He lost his senses and tried to kiss me. I could have killed him myself.\\\"\\n\\nWetzel did not answer. Betty had been holding his hand in both her own while she spoke impulsively.\\n\\n\\\"I understand how difficult it is for you to overlook an insult to me,\\\" she continued earnestly. \\\"But I ask it of you. You are my best friend, almost my brother, and I promise you that if he ever speaks a word to me again that is not what it should be I will tell you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I reckon I'll let him go, considerin' how set on it you are.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But remember, Lew, that he is revengeful and you must be on the lookout,\\\" said Betty gravely as she recalled the malignant gleam in Miller's eyes.\\n\\n\\\"He's dangerous only like a moccasin snake that hides in the grass.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Am I an right? Do I look mussed or--or excited--or anything?\\\" asked Betty.\\n\\nLewis smiled as she turned round for his benefit. Her hair was a little awry and the lace at her neck disarranged. The natural bloom had not quite returned to her cheeks. With a look in his eyes that would have mystified Betty for many a day had she but seen it he ran his gaze over the dainty figure. Then reassuring her that she looked as well as ever, he led her into the dance-room.\\n\\n\\\"So this is Betty Zane. Dear child, kiss me,\\\" said Grandmother Watkins when Wetzel had brought Betty up to her. \\\"Now, let me get a good look at you. Well, well, you are a true Zane. Black hair and eyes; all fire and pride. Child, I knew your father and mother long before you were born. Your father was a fine man but a proud one. And how do you like the frontier? Are you enjoying yourself?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes, indeed,\\\" said Betty, smiling brightly at the old lady.\\n\\n\\\"Well, dearie, have a good time while you can. Life is hard in a pioneer's cabin. You will not always have the Colonel to look after you. They tell me you have been to some grand school in Philadelphia. Learning is very well, but it will not help you in the cabin of one of these rough men.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is a great need of education in all the pioneers' homes. I have persuaded brother Eb to have a schoolteacher at the Fort next spring.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"First teach the boys to plow and the girls to make Johnny cake. How much you favor your brother Isaac. He used to come and see me often. So must you in summertime. Poor lad, I suppose he is dead by this time. I have seen so many brave and good lads go. There now, I did not mean to make you sad,\\\" and the old lady patted Betty's hand and sighed.\\n\\n\\\"He often spoke of you and said that I must come with him to see you. Now he is gone,\\\" said Betty.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, he is gone, Betty, but you must not be sad while you are so young. Wait until you are old like I am. How long have you known Lew Wetzel?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All my life. He used to carry me in his arm, when I was a baby. Of course I do not remember that, but as far back as I can go in memory I can see Lew. Oh, the many times he has saved me from disaster! But why do you ask?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think Lew Wetzel cares more for you than for all the world. He is as silent as an Indian, but I am an old woman and I can read men's hearts. If he could be made to give up his wandering life he would be the best man on the border.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, indeed I think you are wrong. Lew does not care for me in that way,\\\" said Betty, surprised and troubled by the old lady's vehemence.\\n\\nA loud blast from a hunting-horn directed the attention of all to the platform at the upper end of the hall, where Dan Watkins stood. The fiddlers ceased playing, the dancers stopped, and all looked expectantly. The scene was simple strong, and earnest. The light in the eyes of these maidens shone like the light from the pine cones on the walls. It beamed soft and warm. These fearless sons of the wilderness, these sturdy sons of progress, standing there clasping the hands of their partners and with faces glowing with happiness, forgetful of all save the enjoyment of the moment, were ready to go out on the morrow and battle unto the death for the homes and the lives of their loved ones.\\n\\n\\\"Friends,\\\" said Dan when the hum of voices had ceased \\\"I never thought as how I'd have to get up here and make a speech to-night or I might have taken to the woods. Howsomever, mother and Susan says as it's gettin' late it's about time we had some supper. Somewhere in the big cake is hid a gold ring. If one of the girls gets it she can keep it as a gift from Susan, and should one of the boys find it he may make a present to his best girl. And in the bargain he gets to kiss Susan. She made some objection about this and said that part of the game didn't go, but I reckon the lucky young man will decide that for hisself. And now to the festal board.\\\"\\n\\nAmple justice was done to the turkey, the venison, and the bear meat. Grandmother Watkins' delicious apple and pumpkin pies for which she was renowned, disappeared as by magic. Likewise the cakes and the sweet cider and the apple butter vanished.\\n\\nWhen the big cake had been cut and divided among the guests, Wetzel discovered the gold ring within his share. He presented the ring to Betty, and gave his privilege of kissing Susan to George Reynolds, with the remark: \\\"George, I calkilate Susan would like it better if you do the kissin' part.\\\" Now it was known to all that George had long been an ardent admirer of Susan's, and it was suspected that she was not indifferent to him. Nevertheless, she protested that it was not fair. George acted like a man who had the opportunity of his life. Amid uproarious laughter he ran Susan all over the room, and when he caught her he pulled her hands away from her blushing face and bestowed a right hearty kiss on her cheek. To everyone's surprise and to Wetzel's discomfiture, Susan walked up to him and saying that as he had taken such an easy way out of it she intended to punish him by kissing him. And so she did. Poor Lewis' face looked the picture of dismay. Probably he had never been kissed before in his life.\\n\\nHappy hours speed away on the wings of the wind. The feasting over, the good-byes were spoken, the girls were wrapped in the warm robes, for it was now intensely cold, and soon the horses, eager to start on the long homeward journey, were pulling hard on their bits. On the party's return trip there was an absence of the hilarity which had prevailed on their coming. The bells were taken off before the sleds left the blockhouse, and the traces and the harness examined and tightened with the caution of men who were apprehensive of danger and who would take no chances.\\n\\nIn winter time the foes most feared by the settlers were the timber wolves. Thousands of these savage beasts infested the wild forest regions which bounded the lonely roads, and their wonderful power of scent and swift and tireless pursuit made a long night ride a thing to be dreaded. While the horses moved swiftly danger from wolves was not imminent; but carelessness or some mishap to a trace or a wheel had been the cause of more than one tragedy.\\n\\nTherefore it was not remarkable that the drivers of our party breathed a sigh of relief when the top of the last steep hill had been reached. The girls were quiet, and tired out and cold they pressed close to one another; the men were silent and watchful.\\n\\nWhen they were half way home and had just reached the outskirts of the Black Forest the keen ear of Wetzel caught the cry of a wolf. It came from the south and sounded so faint that Wetzel believed at first that he had been mistaken. A few moments passed in which the hunter turned his ear to the south. He had about made up his mind that he had only imagined he had heard something when the unmistakable yelp of a wolf came down on the wind. Then another, this time clear and distinct, caused the driver to turn and whisper to Wetzel. The hunter spoke in a low tone and the driver whipped up his horses. From out the depths of the dark woods along which they were riding came a long and mournful howl. It was a wolf answering the call of his mate. This time the horses heard it, for they threw back their ears and increased their speed. The girls heard it, for they shrank closer to the men.\\n\\nThere is that which is frightful in the cry of a wolf. When one is safe in camp before a roaring fire the short, sharp bark of a wolf is startling, and the long howl will make one shudder. It is so lonely and dismal. It makes no difference whether it be given while the wolf is sitting on his haunches near some cabin waiting for the remains of the settler's dinner, or while he is in full chase after his prey--the cry is equally wild, savage and bloodcurdling.\\n\\nBetty had never heard it and though she was brave, when the howl from the forest had its answer in another howl from the creek thicket, she slipped her little mittened hand under Wetzel's arm and looked up at him with frightened eyes.\\n\\nIn half an hour the full chorus of yelps, barks and howls swelled hideously on the air, and the ever increasing pack of wolves could be seen scarcely a hundred yards behind the sleds. The patter of their swiftly flying feet on the snow could be distinctly heard. The slender, dark forms came nearer and nearer every moment. Presently the wolves had approached close enough for the occupants of the sleds to see their shining eyes looking like little balls of green fire. A gaunt beast bolder than the others, and evidently the leader of the pack, bounded forward until he was only a few yards from the last sled. At every jump he opened his great jaws and uttered a quick bark as if to embolden his followers.\\n\\nAlmost simultaneously with the red flame that burst from Wetzel's rifle came a sharp yelp of agony from the leader. He rolled over and over. Instantly followed a horrible mingling of snarls and barks, and snapping of jaws as the band fought over the body of their luckless comrade.\\n\\nThis short delay gave the advantage to the horses. When the wolves again appeared they were a long way behind. The distance to the fort was now short and the horses were urged to their utmost. The wolves kept up the chase until they reached the creek bridge and the mill. Then they slowed up: the howling became desultory, and finally the dark forms disappeared in the thickets.\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\nWinter dragged by uneventfully for Betty. Unlike the other pioneer girls, who were kept busy all the time with their mending, and linsey weaving, and household duties, Betty had nothing to divert her but her embroidery and her reading. These she found very tiresome. Her maid was devoted to her and never left a thing undone. Annie was old Sam's daughter, and she had waited on Betty since she had been a baby. The cleaning or mending or darning--anything in the shape of work that would have helped pass away the monotonous hours for Betty, was always done before she could lift her hand.\\n\\nDuring the day she passed hours in her little room, and most of them were dreamed away by her window. Lydia and Alice came over sometimes and whiled away the tedious moments with their bright chatter and merry laughter, their castle-building, and their romancing on heroes and love and marriage as girls always will until the end of time. They had not forgotten Mr. Clarke, but as Betty had rebuked them with a dignity which forbade any further teasing on that score, they had transferred their fun-making to the use of Mr. Miller's name.\\n\\nFearing her brothers' wrath Betty had not told them of the scene with Miller at the dance. She had learned enough of rough border justice to dread the consequence of such a disclosure. She permitted Miller to come to the house, although she never saw him alone. Miller had accepted this favor gratefully. He said that on the night of the dance he had been a little the worse for Dan Watkins' strong liquor, and that, together with his bitter disappointment, made him act in the mad way which had so grievously offended her. He exerted himself to win her forgiveness. Betty was always tender-hearted, and though she did not trust him, she said they might still be friends, but that that depended on his respect for her forbearance. Miller had promised he would never refer to the old subject and he had kept his word.\\n\\nIndeed Betty welcomed any diversion for the long winter evenings. Occasionally some of the young people visited her, and they sang and danced, roasted apples, popped chestnuts, and played games. Often Wetzel and Major McColloch came in after supper. Betty would come down and sing for them, and afterward would coax Indian lore and woodcraft from Wetzel, or she would play checkers with the Major. If she succeeded in winning from him, which in truth was not often, she teased him unmercifully. When Col. Zane and the Major had settled down to their series of games, from which nothing short of Indians could have diverted them, Betty sat by Wetzel. The silent man of the woods, an appellation the hunter had earned by his reticence, talked for Betty as he would for no one else.\\n\\nOne night while Col. Zane, his wife and Betty were entertaining Capt. Boggs and Major McColloch and several of Betty's girls friends, after the usual music and singing, storytelling became the order of the evening. Little Noah told of the time he had climbed the apple-tree in the yard after a raccoon and got severely bitten.\\n\\n\\\"One day,\\\" said Noah, \\\"I heard Tige barking out in the orchard and I ran out there and saw a funny little fur ball up in the tree with a black tail and white rings around it. It looked like a pretty cat with a sharp nose. Every time Tige barked the little animal showed his teeth and swelled up his back. I wanted him for a pet. I got Sam to give me a sack and I climbed the tree and the nearer I got to him the farther he backed down the limb. I followed him and put out the sack to put it over his head and he bit me. I fell from the limb, but he fell too and Tige killed him and Sam stuffed him for me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Noah, you are quite a valiant hunter,\\\" said Betty. \\\"Now, Jonathan, remember that you promised to tell me of your meeting with Daniel Boone.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It was over on the Muskingong near the mouth of the Sandusky. I was hunting in the open woods along the bank when I saw an Indian. He saw me at the same time and we both treed. There we stood a long time each afraid to change position. Finally I began to act tired and resorted to an old ruse. I put my coon-skin cap on my ramrod and cautiously poked it from behind the tree, expecting every second to hear the whistle of the redskin's bullet. Instead I heard a jolly voice yell: 'Hey, young feller, you'll have to try something better'n that.' I looked and saw a white man standing out in the open and shaking all over with laughter. I went up to him and found him to be a big strong fellow with an honest, merry face. He said: 'I'm Boone.' I was considerably taken aback, especially when I saw he knew I was a white man all the time. We camped and hunted along the river a week and at the Falls of the Muskingong he struck out for his Kentucky home.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Here is Wetzel,\\\" said Col. Zane, who had risen and gone to the door. \\\"Now, Betty, try and get Lew to tell us something.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come, Lewis, here is a seat by me,\\\" said Betty. \\\"We have been pleasantly passing the time. We have had bear stories, snake stories, ghost stories--all kinds of tales. Will you tell us one?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lewis, did you ever have a chance to kill a hostile Indian and not take it?\\\" asked Col. Zane.\\n\\n\\\"Never but once,\\\" answered Lewis.\\n\\n\\\"Tell us about it. I imagine it will be interesting.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I ain't good at tellin' things,\\\" began Lewis. \\\"I reckon I've seen some strange sights. I kin tell you about the only redskin I ever let off. Three years ago I was takin' a fall hunt over on the Big Sandy, and I run into a party of Shawnees. I plugged a chief and started to run. There was some good runners and I couldn't shake 'em in the open country. Comin' to the Ohio I jumped in and swum across, keepin' my rifle and powder dry by holdin' 'em up. I hid in some bulrushes and waited. Pretty soon along comes three Injuns, and when they saw where I had taken to the water they stopped and held a short pow-wow. Then they all took to the water. This was what I was waitin' for. When they got nearly acrosst I shot the first redskin, and loadin' quick got a bullet into the others. The last Injun did not sink. I watched him go floatin' down stream expectin' every minute to see him go under as he was hurt so bad he could hardly keep his head above water. He floated down a long ways and the current carried him to a pile of driftwood which had lodged against a little island. I saw the Injun crawl up on the drift. I went down stream and by keepin' the island between me and him I got out to where he was. I pulled my tomahawk and went around the head of the island and found the redskin leanin' against a big log. He was a young brave and a fine lookin strong feller. He was tryin' to stop the blood from my bullet-hole in his side. When he saw me he tried to get up, but he was too weak. He smiled, pointed to the wound and said: 'Deathwind not heap times bad shot.' Then he bowed his head and waited for the tomahawk. Well, I picked him up and carried him ashore and made a shack by a spring. I staid there with him. When he got well enough to stand a few days' travel I got him across the river and givin' him a hunk of deer meat I told him to go, and if I ever saw him again I'd make a better shot.\\n\\n\\\"A year afterwards I trailed two Shawnees into Wingenund's camp and got surrounded and captured. The Delaware chief is my great enemy. They beat me, shot salt into my legs, made me run the gauntlet, tied me on the back of a wild mustang. Then they got ready to burn me at the stake. That night they painted my face black and held the usual death dances. Some of the braves got drunk and worked themselves into a frenzy. I allowed I'd never see daylight. I seen that one of the braves left to guard me was the young feller I had wounded the year before. He never took no notice of me. In the gray of the early mornin' when all were asleep and the other watch dozin' I felt cold steel between my wrists and my buckskin thongs dropped off. Then my feet were cut loose. I looked round and in the dim light I seen my young brave. He handed me my own rifle, knife and tomahawk, put his finger on his lips and with a bright smile, as if to say he was square with me, he pointed to the east. I was out of sight in a minute.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How noble of him!\\\" exclaimed Betty, her eyes all aglow. \\\"He paid his debt to you, perhaps at the price of his life.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have never known an Indian to forget a promise, or a kind action, or an injury,\\\" observed Col. Zane.\\n\\n\\\"Are the Indians half as bad as they are called?\\\" asked Betty. \\\"I have heard as many stories of their nobility as of their cruelty.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Indians consider that they have been robbed and driven from their homes. What we think hideously inhuman is war to them,\\\" answered Col. Zane.\\n\\n\\\"When I came here from Fort Pitt I expected to see and fight Indians every day,\\\" said Capt. Boggs. \\\"I have been here at Wheeling for nearly two years and have never seen a hostile Indian. There have been some Indians in the vicinity during that time but not one has shown himself to me. I'm not up to Indian tricks, I know, but I think the last siege must have been enough for them. I don't believe we shall have any more trouble from them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Captain,\\\" called out Col. Zane, banging his hand on the table. \\\"I'll bet you my best horse to a keg of gunpowder that you see enough Indians before you are a year older to make you wish you had never seen or heard of the western border.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And I'll go you the same bet,\\\" said Major McColloch.\\n\\n\\\"You see, Captain, you must understand a little of the nature of the Indian,\\\" continued Col. Zane. \\\"We have had proof that the Delawares and the Shawnees have been preparing for an expedition for months. We shall have another siege some day and to my thinking it will be a longer and harder one than the last. What say you, Wetzel?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I ain't sayin' much, but I don't calkilate on goin' on any long hunts this summer,\\\" answered the hunter.\\n\\n\\\"And do you think Tarhe, Wingenund, Pipe, Cornplanter, and all those chiefs will unite their forces and attack us?\\\" asked Betty of Wetzel.\\n\\n\\\"Cornplanter won't. He has been paid for most of his land and he ain't so bitter. Tarhe is not likely to bother us. But Pipe and Wingenund and Red Fox--they all want blood.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have you seen these chiefs?\\\" said Betty.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I know 'em all and they all know me,\\\" answered the hunter. \\\"I've watched over many a trail waitin' for one of 'em. If I can ever get a shot at any of 'em I'll give up Injuns and go farmin'. Good night, Betty.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What a strange man is Wetzel,\\\" mused Betty, after the visitors had gone. \\\"Do you know, Eb, he is not at all like any one else. I have seen the girls shudder at the mention of his name and I have heard them say they could not look in his eyes. He does not affect me that way. It is not often I can get him to talk, but sometimes he tells me beautiful thing about the woods; how he lives in the wilderness, his home under the great trees; how every leaf on the trees and every blade of grass has its joy for him as well as its knowledge; how he curls up in his little bark shack and is lulled to sleep by the sighing of the wind through the pine tops. He told me he has often watched the stars for hours at a time. I know there is a waterfall back in the Black Forest somewhere that Lewis goes to, simply to sit and watch the water tumble over the precipice.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Wetzel is a wonderful character, even to those who know him only as an Indian slayer and a man who wants no other occupation. Some day he will go off on one of these long jaunts and will never return. That is certain. The day is fast approaching when a man like Wetzel will be of no use in life. Now, he is a necessity. Like Tige he can smell Indians. Betty, I believe Lewis tells you so much and is so kind and gentle toward you because he cares for you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course Lew likes me. I know he does and I want him to,\\\" said Betty. \\\"But he does not care as you seem to think. Grandmother Watkins said the same. I am sure both of you are wrong.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did Dan's mother tell you that? Well, she's pretty shrewd. It's quite likely, Betty, quite likely. It seems to me you are not so quick witted as you used to be.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why so?\\\" asked Betty, quickly.\\n\\n\\\"Well, you used to be different somehow,\\\" said her brother, as he patted her hand.\\n\\n\\\"Do you mean I am more thoughtful?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, and sometimes you seem sad.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have tried to be brave and--and happy,\\\" said Betty, her voice trembling slightly.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, yes, I know you have, Betty. You have done wonderfully well here in this dead place. But tell me, don't be angry, don't you think too much of some one?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have no right to ask me that,\\\" said Betty, flushing and turning away toward the stairway.\\n\\n\\\"Well, well, child, don't mind me. I did not mean anything. There, good night, Betty.\\\"\\n\\nLong after she had gone up-stairs Col. Zane sat by his fireside. From time to time he sighed. He thought of the old Virginia home and of the smile of his mother. It seemed only a few short years since he had promised her that he would take care of the baby sister. How had he kept that promise made when Betty was a little thing bouncing on his knee? It seemed only yesterday. How swift the flight of time! Already Betty was a woman; her sweet, gay girlhood had passed; already a shadow had fallen on her face, the shadow of a secret sorrow.\\n\\n```\\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\\n```\\n\\nMarch with its blustering winds had departed, and now April's showers and sunshine were gladdening the hearts of the settlers. Patches of green freshened the slopes of the hills; the lilac bushes showed tiny leaves, and the maple-buds were bursting. Yesterday a blue-bird--surest harbinger of spring--had alighted on the fence-post and had sung his plaintive song. A few more days and the blossoms were out mingling their pink and white with the green; the red-bud. the Hawthorne, and the dog-wood were in bloom, checkering the hillsides.\\n\\n\\\"Bessie, spring is here,\\\" said Col. Zane, as he stood in the doorway. \\\"The air is fresh, the sun shines warm, the birds are singing; it makes me feel good.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, it is pleasant to have spring with us again,\\\" answered his wife. \\\"I think, though, that in winter I am happier. In summer I am always worried. I am afraid for the children to be out of my sight, and when you are away on a hunt I am distraught until you are home safe.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, if the redskins let us alone this summer it will be something new,\\\" he said, laughing. \\\"By the way, Bess, some new people came to the fort last night. They rafted down from the Monongahela settlements. Some of the women suffered considerably. I intend to offer them the cabin on the hill until they can cut the timber and run up a house. Sam said the cabin roof leaked and the chimney smoked, but with a little work I think they can be made more comfortable there than at the block-house.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is the only vacant cabin in the settlement. I can accommodate the women folks here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, we'll see about it. I don't want you and Betty inconvenienced. I'll send Sam up to the cabin and have him fix things up a bit and make it more habitable.\\n\\nThe door opened, admitting Col. Zane's elder boy. The lad's face was dirty, his nose was all bloody, and a big bruise showed over his right eye.\\n\\n\\\"For the land's sake!\\\" exclaimed his mother. \\\"Look at the boy. Noah, come here. What have you been doing?\\\"\\n\\nNoah crept close to his mother and grasping her apron with both hands hid his face. Mrs. Zane turned the boy around and wiped his discolored features with a wet towel. She gave him a little shake and said: \\\"Noah, have you been fighting again?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let him go and I'll tell you about it,\\\" said the Colonel, and when the youngster had disappeared he continued: \\\"Right after breakfast Noah went with me down to the mill. I noticed several children playing in front of Reihart's blacksmith shop. I went in, leaving Noah outside. I got a plow-share which I had left with Reihart to be repaired. He came to the door with me and all at once he said: 'look at the kids.' I looked and saw Noah walk up to a boy and say something to him. The lad was a stranger, and I have no doubt belongs to these new people I told you about. He was bigger than Noah. At first the older boy appeared very friendly and evidently wanted to join the others in their game. I guess Noah did not approve of this, for after he had looked the stranger over he hauled away and punched the lad soundly. To make it short the strange boy gave Noah the worst beating he ever got in his life. I told Noah to come straight to you and confess.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, did you ever!\\\" ejaculated Mrs. Zane. \\\"Noah is a bad boy. And you stood and watched him fight. You are laughing about it now. Ebenezer Zane, I would not put it beneath you to set Noah to fighting. I know you used to make the little niggers fight. Anyway, it serves Noah right and I hope it will be a lesson to him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll make you a bet, Bessie,\\\" said the Colonel, with another laugh. \\\"I'll bet you that unless we lock him up, Noah will fight that boy every day or every time he meets him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I won't bet,\\\" said Mrs. Zane, with a smile of resignation.\\n\\n\\\"Where's Betts? I haven't seen her this morning. I am going over to Short Creek to-morrow or next day, and think I'll take her with me. You know I am to get a commission to lay out several settlements along the river, and I want to get some work finished at Short Creek this spring. Mrs. Raymer'll be delighted to have Betty. Shall I take her?\\n\\n\\\"By all means. A visit there will brighten her up and do her good.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, what on earth have you been doing?\\\" cried the Colonel. His remark had been called forth by a charming vision that had entered by the open door. Betty--for it was she--wore a little red cap set jauntily on her black hair. Her linsey dress was crumpled and covered with hayseed.\\n\\n\\\"I've been in the hay-mow,\\\" said Betty, waving a small basket. \\\"For a week that old black hen has circumvented me, but at last I have conquered. I found the nest in the farthest corner under the hay.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How did you get up in the loft?\\\" inquired Mrs. Zane.\\n\\n\\\"Bessie, I climbed up the ladder of course. I acknowledge being unusually light-hearted and happy this morning, but I have not as yet grown wings. Sam said I could not climb up that straight ladder, but I found it easy enough.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You should not climb up into the loft,\\\" said Mrs. Zane, in a severe tone. \\\"Only last fall Hugh Bennet's little boy slid off the hay down into one of the stalls and the horse kicked him nearly to death.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, fiddlesticks, Bessie, I am not a baby,\\\" said Betty, with vehemence. \\\"There is not a horse in the barn but would stand on his hind legs before he would step on me, let alone kick me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know, Betty, but I think that black horse Mr. Clarke left here would kick any one,\\\" remarked the Colonel.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no, he would not hurt me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Betty, we have had pleasant weather for about three days,\\\" said the Colonel, gravely. \\\"In that time you have let out that crazy bear of yours to turn everything topsy-turvy. Only yesterday I got my hands in the paint you have put on your canoe. If you had asked my advice I would have told you that painting your canoe should not have been done for a month yet. Silas told me you fell down the creek hill; Sam said you tried to drive his team over the bluff, and so on. We are happy to see you get back your old time spirits, but could you not be a little more careful? Your versatility is bewildering. We do not know what to look for next. I fully expect to see you brought to the house some day maimed for life, or all that beautiful black hair gone to decorate some Huron's lodge.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I tell you I am perfectly delighted that the weather is again so I can go out. I am tired to death of staying indoors. This morning I could have cried for very joy. Bessie will soon be lecturing me about Madcap. I must not ride farther than the fort. Well, I don't care. I intend to ride all over.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Betty, I do not wish you to think I am lecturing you,\\\" said the Colonel's wife. \\\"But you are as wild as a March hare and some one must tell you things. Now listen. My brother, the Major, told me that Simon Girty, the renegade, had been heard to say that he had seen Eb Zane's little sister and that if he ever got his hands on her he would make a squaw of her. I am not teasing you. I am telling you the truth. Girty saw you when you were at Fort Pitt two years ago. Now what would you do if he caught you on one of your lonely rides and carried you off to his wigwam? He has done things like that before. James Girty carried off one of the Johnson girls. Her brothers tried to rescue her and lost their lives. It is a common trick of the Indians.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What would I do if Mr. Simon Girty tried to make a squaw of me?\\\" exclaimed Betty, her eyes flashing fire. \\\"Why, I'd kill him!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I believe it, Betts, on my word I do,\\\" spoke up the Colonel. \\\"But let us hope you may never see Girty. All I ask is that you be careful. I am going over to Short Creek to-morrow. Will you go with me? I know Mrs. Raymer will be pleased to see you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Eb, that will be delightful!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well, get ready and we shall start early in the morning.\\n\\nTwo weeks later Betty returned from Short Creek and seemed to have profited much by her short visit. Col. Zane remarked with satisfaction to his wife that Betty had regained all her former cheerfulness.\\n\\nThe morning after Betty's return was a perfect spring morning--the first in that month of May-days. The sun shone bright and warm; the mayflowers blossomed; the trailing arbutus scented the air; everywhere the grass and the leaves looked fresh and green; swallows flitted in and out of the barn door; the blue-birds twittered; a meadow-lark caroled forth his pure melody, and the busy hum of bees came from the fragrant apple-blossoms.\\n\\n\\\"Mis' Betty, Madcap 'pears powerfo' skittenish,\\\" said old Sam, when he had led the pony to where Betty stood on the hitching block. \\\"Whoa, dar, you rascal.\\\"\\n\\nBetty laughed as she leaped lightly into the saddle, and soon she was flying over the old familiar road, down across the creek bridge, past the old grist-mill, around the fort and then out on the river bluff. The Indian pony was fiery and mettlesome. He pranced and side-stepped, galloped and trotted by turns. He seemed as glad to get out again into the warm sunshine as was Betty herself. He tore down the road a mile at his best speed. Coming back Betty pulled him into a walk. Presently her musings were interrupted by a sharp switch in the face from a twig of a tree. She stopped the pony and broke off the offending branch. As she looked around the recollection of what had happened to her in that very spot flashed into her mind. It was here that she had been stopped by the man who had passed almost as swiftly out of her life as he had crossed her path that memorable afternoon. She fell to musing on the old perplexing question. After all could there not have been some mistake? Perhaps she might have misjudged him? And then the old spirit, which resented her thinking of him in that softened mood, rose and fought the old battle over again. But as often happened the mood conquered, and Betty permitted herself to sink for the moment into the sad thoughts which returned like a mournful strain of music once sung by beloved voices, now forever silent.\\n\\nShe could not resist the desire to ride down to the old sycamore. The pony turned into the bridle-path that led down the bluff and the sure-footed beast picked his way carefully over the roots and stones. Betty's heart beat quicker when she saw the noble tree under whose spreading branches she had spent the happiest day of her life. The old monarch of the forest was not one whit changed by the wild winds of winter. The dew sparkled on the nearly full grown leaves; the little sycamore balls were already as large as marbles.\\n\\nBetty drew rein at the top of the bank and looked absently at the tree and into the foam covered pool beneath. At that moment her eyes saw nothing physical. They held the faraway light of the dreamer, the look that sees so much of the past and nothing of the present.\\n\\nPresently her reflections were broken by the actions of the pony. Madcap had thrown up her head, laid back her ears and commenced to paw the ground with her forefeet. Betty looked round to see the cause of Madcap's excitement. What was that! She saw a tall figure clad in brown leaning against the stone. She saw a long fishing-rod. What was there so familiar in the poise of that figure? Madcap dislodged a stone from the path and it went rattling down the rock, slope and fell with a splash into the water. The man heard it, turned and faced the hillside. Betty recognized Alfred Clarke. For a moment she believed she must be dreaming She had had many dreams of the old sycamore. She looked again. Yes, it was he. Pale, worn, and older he undoubtedly looked, but the features were surely those of Alfred Clarke. Her heart gave a great bound and then seemed to stop beating while a very agony of joy surged over her and made her faint. So he still lived. That was her first thought, glad and joyous, and then memory returning, her face went white as with clenched teeth she wheeled Madcap and struck her with the switch. Once on the level bluff she urged her toward the house at a furious pace.\\n\\nCol. Zane had just stepped out of the barn door and his face took on an expression of amazement when he saw the pony come tearing up the road, Betty's hair flying in the wind and with a face as white as if she were pursued by a thousand yelling Indians.\\n\\n\\\"Say, Betts, what the deuce is wrong?\\\" cried the Colonel, when Betty reached the fence.\\n\\n\\\"Why did you not tell me that man was here again?\\\" she demanded in intense excitement.\\n\\n\\\"That man! What man?\\\" asked Col. Zane, considerably taken back by this angry apparition.\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Clarke, of course. Just as if you did not know. I suppose you thought it a fine opportunity for one of your jokes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Clarke. Well, the fact is I just found it out myself. Haven't I been away as well as you? I certainly cannot imagine how any man could create such evident excitement in your mind. Poor Clarke, what has he done now?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You might have told me. Somebody could have told me and saved me from making a fool of myself,\\\" retorted Betty, who was plainly on the verge of tears. \\\"I rode down to the old sycamore tree and he saw me in, of all the places in the world, the one place where I would not want him to see me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Huh!\\\" said the Colonel, who often gave vent to the Indian exclamation. \\\"Is that all? I thought something had happened.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All! Is it not enough? I would rather have died. He is a man and he will think I followed him down there, that I was thinking of--that--Oh!\\\" cried Betty, passionately, and then she strode into the house, slammed the door. and left the Colonel, lost in wonder.\\n\\n\\\"Humph! These women beat me. I can't make them out, and the older I grow the worse I get,\\\" he said, as he led the pony into the stable.\\n\\nBetty ran up-stairs to her room, her head in a whirl stronger than the surprise of Alfred's unexpected appearance in Fort Henry and stronger than the mortification in having been discovered going to a spot she should have been too proud to remember was the bitter sweet consciousness that his mere presence had thrilled her through and through. It hurt her and made her hate herself in that moment. She hid her face in shame at the thought that she could not help being glad to see the man who had only trifled with her, the man who had considered the acquaintance of so little consequence that he had never taken the trouble to write her a line or send her a message. She wrung her trembling hands. She endeavored to still that throbbing heart and to conquer that sweet vague feeling which had crept over her and made her weak. The tears began to come and with a sob she threw herself on the bed and buried her head in the pillow.\",\"timestamp\":1640148460,\"title\":\"\\nThe long whips cracked, the bells jingled, the impatient horses plunged forward and away they went over the glistening snow\"},\"digest\":\"2yjxvDaGNDIQ2eYC1OL4B7aeTF-_-DCqeERcRTHvJlk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x1928Fa8c1480697A043aA639A3c2C52BE5B7890a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"TdsSTO1EXRF1V2f74V4BtTFTiFdivi5_1EK8K8JQkW0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3ADrQzoRK5rJ8-5nO-HK_bwgnWfv3SHq3iSf4OAB3ok\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"MhYKxcuwMx7Q33qDCSvAhfVl6_-XgXLMeWTuAXp8KUhlhJjwEtE8gIQguGZrGA6PZENJGtRJ5ver_QXNmoPbfQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa5ed91ce2681720c69d9a20de90801026a5f09c7cb345d50f0d47cda03547e8264c85b4c04f58970c65ab9de88d64215ca62860581433917791dfd5cd19c41fe1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"TdsSTO1EXRF1V2f74V4BtTFTiFdivi5_1EK8K8JQkW0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3ADrQzoRK5rJ8-5nO-HK_bwgnWfv3SHq3iSf4OAB3ok\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"2yjxvDaGNDIQ2eYC1OL4B7aeTF-_-DCqeERcRTHvJlk\"}"
