"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"composition of all members of this system by assuming that they\\nwere all once a part of the same body, and you may say brothers\\nand sisters of the sun, instead of its offspring.  It also makes\\nsize the only factor determining temperature and density, but of\\ncourse modified by age, since otherwise Jupiter would have a far\\nless developed crust than that with which we find it.  I have\\nalways considered the period from the molten condition to that\\nwith a crust as comparatively short, which stands to reason, for\\nradiation has then no check; and the period from the formation of\\nthe crust, which acts as a blanket, to the death of a planet, as\\nvery long.  I have not found this view clearly set forth in any\\nof the books I have read, but it seems to me the simplest and\\nmost natural explanation.  Now, granted that the solar system was\\nonce a nebula, on which I think every one will agree--the same\\nforces that changed it into a system of sun and planets must be\\nat work on fifty-one M. Canum venaticorum, Andromeda, and ninety-\\nnine M. Virginis, and must inevitably change them to suns, each\\nwith doubtless a system of planets.\\n\\n\\\"If, then, the condition of a nebula or star depends simply on\\nits size, it is reasonable to suppose that Andromeda, Sirius, and\\nall the vast bodies we see, were created at the same time as our\\nsystem, which involves the necessity of one general and\\nsimultaneous creation day.  But as Sirius, with its diameter of\\ntwelve million miles, must be larger than some of the nebulae\\nwill be when equally condensed, we must suppose rather that\\nnebulae are forming and coming into the condition of bright and\\ndead stars, much as apples or pears on a fruit tree are\\nconstantly growing and developing, so that the Mosaic description\\nof the creation would probably apply in point of time only to our\\nsystem, or perhaps to our globe, though the rest will doubtless\\npass through precisely the same stages.  This, I think, I will\\npublish, on our return, as the Cortlandt astronomical doctrine,\\nas the most rational I have seen devised, and one that I think we\\nmay safely believe, until, perhaps, through increased knowledge,\\nit can be disproved.\\\"\\n\\nAfter they crossed a line of hills that ran at right angles to\\ntheir course they found the country more rolling.  All streams\\nand water-courses flowed in their direction, while their aneroid\\nshowed them that they were gradually descending.  When they were\\nmoving along near the surface of the ground, a delicious and\\nrefined perfume exhaled by the blue and white flowers, that had\\nbeen growing smaller as they journeyed northward, frequently\\nreached their nostrils.  To Cortlandt and Bearwarden it was\\nmerely the scent of a flower, but to Ayrault it recalled mental\\npictures of Sylvia wearing violets and lilies that he had given\\nher.  He knew that the greatest telescopes on earth could not\\nreveal the Callisto moving about in Jupiter's sunshine, as even a\\npoint of light, at that distance, and, notwithstanding\\nCortlandt's learning and Bearwarden's joviality, he felt at times\\nextremely lonely.\\n\\nThey swept along steadily for fifty hours, having bright sunny\\ndays and beautifully moonlit nights.  They passed over finely\\nrounded hills and valleys and well- watered plains.  As they\\napproached the ocean and its level the temperature rose, and\\nthere was more moisture in the air.  The plants and flowers also\\nincreased in size, again resembling somewhat the large species\\nthey had seen near the equator.\\n\\n\\\"This would be the place to live,\\\" said Bearwarden, looking at\\niron mountains, silver, copper, and lead formations, primeval\\nforests, rich prairies, and regions evidently underlaid with coal\\nand petroleum, not to mention huge beds of aluminum clay, and\\nother natural resources, that made his materialistic mouth water.\\n\\\"It would be joy and delight to develop industries here, with no\\nsnow avalanches to clog your railroads, or icy blizzards to\\nparalyze work, nor weather that blights you with sun-strokes and\\nfevers.  On our return to the earth we must organize a company to\\nrun regular interplanetary lines.  We could start on this globe\\nall that is best on our own.  Think what boundless possibilities\\nmay be before the human race on this planet, which on account of\\nits vast size will be in its prime when our insignificant earth\\nis cold and dead and no longer capable of supporting life!  Think\\nalso of the indescribable blessing to the congested communities\\nof Europe and America, to find an unlimited outlet here!  Mars is\\nalready past its prime, and Venus scarcely habitable, but in\\nJupiter we have a new promised land, compared with which our\\nearth is a pygmy, or but little more than microscopic.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I see,\\\" said Ayrault, \\\"that the possibilities here have no\\nlimit; but I do not see how you can compare it to the promised\\nland, since, till we undertook this journey, no one had even\\nthought of Jupiter as a habitable place.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I trace the Divine promise,\\\" replied Bearwarden, \\\"in what you\\ndescribed to us on earth as man's innate longing and desire to\\nrise, and in the fact that the Almighty has given the race\\nunbounded expansiveness in very limited space.  This would look\\nto me as the return of man to the garden of Eden through\\nintellectual development, for here every man can sit under his\\nown vine and fig-tree.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1636792421,\"title\":\"\\\"This theory explains the practical uniformity in the chemical\"},\"digest\":\"j51xMG2fDulSKE3t2UjftW9IuxAi-tKgUvJdKm_nOcw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x953ef2b42A44aEF445c93691F4C90c61b8173D62\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Na_W-OlFw_bJfHD7TpcsGUgD4e15aPBLhp9OC9n6DVM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0KLvJPrWG0k4F64WRI8Sk4CgL4Fqnaf3C3DT3IkQajg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"CcbDV4iOqBvEUOlbK1Jd5BGYqk3_Qlv2hiHNRYQkjm_HRq9hUlwBN3JXRum2DrzkIY6IUMK7D1jtGmj1hf2Ekw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0d0918a627542a43ac974f9bfbfeb5f235e921188677c57bae5c849e0626921f3bc733ae9b90740e5211e7132b7f2ef811330cc352919a01d5b01a52524fbc4c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Na_W-OlFw_bJfHD7TpcsGUgD4e15aPBLhp9OC9n6DVM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0KLvJPrWG0k4F64WRI8Sk4CgL4Fqnaf3C3DT3IkQajg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"j51xMG2fDulSKE3t2UjftW9IuxAi-tKgUvJdKm_nOcw\"}"
