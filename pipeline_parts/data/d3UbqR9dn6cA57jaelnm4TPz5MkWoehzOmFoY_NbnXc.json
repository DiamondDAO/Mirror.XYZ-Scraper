People looking at each-other (not the camera) allow for **well composed observational action moments** creating beautiful photos with emphasis on body language and expression from often subtly lit and challenging environments.\\n\\n![A bit of laughter](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/62JlzeDkge5fX9S8mZ-1-.png?height=580&width=1480&&&&&&size=medium)\\n\\n![new friends...](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lp54KH8F9IFWh867NuDzS.png?height=533&width=1482&&&&&&size=medium)\\n\\n![and a variety of expressions ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1Sq19jiql-EI-vrFCekV9.png?height=569&width=1471&&&&&&size=medium)\\n\\n*(credits to [Mervin](https://www.instagram.com/surrephoto/) for 3 excellent examples)*\\n\\n## Benefits\\n\\nWe give official status to out top eagle-eyed shooters, to those who show artistic flair and ingenuity in their photography.\\n\\nCapturing people when they‚Äôre deep in their most memorable moments without them noticing is a fine art that deserves recognition when done well.\\n\\n**Benefits include:**\\n\\n* Certificate of recommendation.\\n* ML Official Photographer watermark.\\n* Access to our inner community networks\\n* Access to paid assignments from our international team.\\n* Join our team at local private events.\\n\\n## Equipment & Settings\\n\\n### DSLR\\n\\nAll photographers should use a DSLR camera. Cell phone or point-and-shoot/pocket camera photography is not acceptable.\\n\\n### Available Light Photography\\n\\nOur venues are often dimly lit, taking photos with available light is challenging. However, the benefits are that you can capture attractive images of the vibe and ambience in a place.\\n\\n1. **Camera:** Be sure to have a camera that performs well at very high ISO sensitivity. For instance, the Canon 6D or 5D Mark III will allow you to go up to ISO 10,000 and still get crisp photos. Of course, there will be noise, but with the right noise reduction, you can convert it into a non-distracting grain when you retouch your photos.\\n2. **Lens:** Ideally, use a 50mm f/1.4 lens. These very popular lenses are also known as ‚Äúnifty fifty‚Äù lenses, and are available quite affordably for both Nikon and Canon. Presumably, the same applies for other camera brands.\\n3. **Shutter speed:** at high ISO and wide openings, you should be able to get anywhere between 1/30 and 1/100 even in low-light environments. Note that for anything longer than 1/30, you will need a very very steady hand.\\n4. **Focus:** careful: at f/1.4, your depth of field will be extremely shallow. Manually select your AF point when shooting, point it over an area with good light/dark contrast so the camera can focus, then shoot. Afterwards, check our images for sharpness by zooming in on the spot you wanted in focus (preferably a person's eyes) when you review them.\\n\\n### Flash Photography\\n\\n**Shutter Speed:** It‚Äôs advisable to work with a shutter speed between 1/15 and 1/30 allowing for plenty of exposure to background light and not just the exposure of your flash victim's face.\\n\\n**Flash:** Don‚Äôt shoot straight into people‚Äôs faces. It will annoy them and make them look flat. Some photographers point their flash at the ceiling or find inventive ways to disperse the light around the room. Photos with obright faces and dark backgrounds are not okay for publication.\\n\\n**AF Points:** If you give the camera automatic control over autofocus (AF) points, it may focus on things you don‚Äôt want it to.\\n\\nIn this shot, the guy's hair on the right (red box) is sharp and crisp, but it‚Äôs not the intended subject. Instead, we should focus on the well-lit guy's face (green).\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WGHoS31EbnZJKR7xUvFt1.png?height=667&width=1000)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*Here is a mock-up of the Canon EOS 6D‚Äôs AF point layout:\\\\*\\\\*In this example, it‚Äôs best to manually select the top AF point (in red, as above) so that the camera focuses on the subject‚Äôs eye.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YWJavSolFno_cAWq-df2s.png?height=692&width=1000)\\n\\nAlternately, leave the middle AF point always selected, use that to focus, and then recompose the shot before triggering the shutter.\\n\\n## Learn from others.\\n\\nThe Internet is full of videos and tutorials offering advice and technique for developing and expanding your skill set. Keep educating yourself and compare tips with your colleagues.\\n\\n## The Candid Sniper‚Äôs Guide\\n\\n### Camouflage |\\n\\nTo capture people looking natural and not posing, we blend into the background like a world-class ninja. Only by passing by unnoticed do we capture participants off-guard, looking natural and not posing.\\n\\n### Sniper |\\n\\n* Try from a high-bar stool, the door, behind the bar, a DJ booth, **a tree, get up there!**\\n* Shots from a distance or a high vantage point help achieve natural shots.\\n* If there's enough light available, go with a zoom or telephoto lens.\\n\\n**Step by step, candid photos:**\\n\\n1. Walk around, observe light **sources**.\\n2. Find light falling on **faces**.\\n3. Study that **person**. How do they carry themselves, where do they stand in relation to the rest of the group?\\n4. Study the **surroundings**. Are there people nearby? Are they distracting because they, too, face your camera? If it‚Äôs an empty part of the bar, can you get more people will be in the frame?\\n5. Look through the camera at the scene and look at **everything in the frame**. How is your angle? Can you move up or down, left or right for a changed picture? Can you move closer or further away for a better picture?\\n6. Now, select the **AF point** in your camera that lies over the subject you want to have in focus (see ‚ÄúAF Points‚Äù above for more info).\\n7. Focus and take **photos** of the scene. 4, 5, more if necessary.\\n8. **Review** these photos closely in your camera. Look at the frame, zoom in to see if your focus is on, look at everybody's faces. If somebody looks dumb, blurry or badly under/overexposed, try again.\\n9. **Repeat this** until you have a great shot of the scene.\\n\\n## Post Production\\n\\nUse post production software, even if just to tweak the white balance. Recommended programs:\\n\\n* **[Adobe Lightroom](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html)** (paid, available by subscription to Adobe Cloud)\\n* **[Darktable](http://www.darktable.org/)** (free open-source alternative to Lightroom.
