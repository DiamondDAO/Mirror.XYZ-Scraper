When you add all of that up, NFTs allow you to “own a piece of the internet.\\n\\nAs Mark Twain said, “When everybody is digging for gold, it’s good to be in the pick and shovel business.”\\n\\nThe most profitable shovel you can sell right now is creating an **Nft Marketplace.**\\n\\nWith this wisdom of the group to sell shovels to gold hunters, we must be expecting a lot of people selling shovels or a lot of Nft marketplaces existing with a considerable market share.\\n\\nYou couldn't be more wrong.\\n\\n> Opensea commands a massive 90% share of the whole market!!!!\\n\\nOpensea has come out as the hands-down winner, to the point where for most of us, there is no difference between opensea and NFT’s in general.\\n\\nThe remaining single-digit % is then shared by 100’s of other Nft marketplaces.\\n\\nIt’s not even like nobody is trying; most of the biggest brands in the game have their marketplace ( Ftx, Binance, Sushiswap etc.), but none of them has been able to get more than a single-digit market share.\\n\\nWhat makes Opensea special?\\n\\n> It’s the only web3 company which has web2 advantages\\n\\nWeb3, by its architecture, makes everything interoperable, i.e. You own the Nft’s; hence you can carry it anywhere anytime, and nobody can stop you.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*0OgEaU26S0_1i-X1Qzt3dA.png)\\n\\nNft is not owned by Opensea but stored at a commonplace\\n\\nBut here lies the Catch22\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*HnVdY4WazWFdJw-82k_vlA.png)\\n\\nAny platform can access it\\n\\nEven though you own your Nft’s, it is important that there are people in the other side of the market to buy it.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*vfDooDqJxB_9kd-rm9whqg.png)\\n\\nEven though your asset is at commonplace it still needs buyers and sellers to make the transaction happen\\n\\nA couple of years ago, this same dynamic of market domination was present in Dex’s when Uniswap owned most of the supply, and then Sushiswap came along took away 30% of the volume in one week, All of this was made possible because the tokens that were being traded in the Dex’s were fungible (Alike). In the case of an Nft marketplace, this becomes so much harder as each asset is unique in itself.\\n\\nAll of this creates a huge moat for Opensea\\n\\n* Opensea has always been the pioneer in the Nft space, with its inception back in 2017, when people even in the crypto world joked about them.\\n* Opensea single-handedly created a new standard of royalty sharing between artist and buyer.\\n\\nIt is annoying that Opensea and other such successful companies are despised even after acing and owning the market and that too without any unfair advantage. They have built the market from scratch.\\n\\nAt the same time, having multiple choices and perfect competition is where every market should heads towards.\\n\\nA simple google search doesn’t even show any organic results :P\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*3cHIdNEC61qYYgwu4320sQ.png)\\n\\nMore marketplaces than Nft’s\\n\\nWill opensea ever see real competition?\\n\\nThis is where we come to the meat of the whole discussion; for someone to succeed in creating a digital marketplace, their launch strategy or attack on the problem of creating a marketplace has to be different.\\n\\n## **Let’s welcome Looksrare.**\\n\\nWhat better way to start 2022 than to drop hundreds of millions of tokens to Opensea users.\\n\\n> Before continuing a necessary disclosure — I own Looksrare token and no I did not get those in the airdrop.\\n\\nLet me explain why I think Looksrare has a fighting chance to establish itself as a significant player in the Nft space.\\n\\nLooksrare realises that the biggest roadblock in solving this problem is getting buyers and sellers into the platform. It helps that there is considerable overlap between buyers and sellers but the job is to get the most active traders onboarded onto their platform.\\n\\nAt the same time, the platform would need to be entirely or Majorly be community-owned so as to build or kickstart network effects.\\n\\nAnd the Holy grail of all marketplace startups success is to have a strong go to Market strategy to kickstart their growth flywheel.\\n\\nThere are various ways of doing that\\n\\n* Find a Niche and then slowly expand.\\n* Control one side of the equation either becoming the only buyer or the only seller in the initial days.\\n* Incentives either side of the trade.\\n\\nFinding and sticking to a niche in this market condition does not make sense because supply is not scarce, curation is subjective, and the people who are using these services are more attracted to the trading part of it and not the art or gaming use case.\\n\\nAccording to me, what Looksrare ended up doing could very well expose a crack in the Opensea’s armour.\\n\\nLooksRare has essentially\\n\\n> Used Airdrop to generate buzz — Which in itself is worthless but enough to get everyone’s attention.\\n>\\n> Selected the user’s who are essentially the most active traders on Opensea.\\n>\\n> Incentivised trading by giving rewards.\\n>\\n> Distributing all of the platform fees back to the community.\\n>\\n> Looksrare makes it very lucrative to keep your tokens staked.\\n\\nLooksrare definitely has a shot to the throne.\\n\\n## WashTrading as a Launch strategy\\n\\nNobody in the space wants to hear the word Wash trading. All of the Marketplaces try to discourage this practice or at least not openly acknowledge it.\\n\\nWhat if — Wash Trading is a GTM and Marketing strategy.\\n\\nLet me Explain\\n\\nWhat is that one metric that the whole industry and outsiders look at to make a sense of market sentiment?\\n\\n> Volume — How much are Nft’s being traded\\n\\nLooksrare has essentially owned this from day 1. Since their launch, they have become the biggest Nft marketplace volume and that too by a factor of 3x consistently every day,\\n\\nWashTrading is when you are both the buyer and seller of the asset, this is primarily done to pump up the volume and inflate the prices.\\n\\nBefore you point out the obvious to me.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*ghwjRvmwiEBrcrWi6OmW1w.png)\\n\\nCredits — Hilobby— <https://dune.xyz/hildobby/LooksRare-VS-OpenSea>\\n\\nThey have hijacked this metric — what all NFT sceptics say is going on in the industry; they have made it a reality — Most of their volume is essentially wash trading.\\n\\nLooksrare’s reward structure is actively incentivising this behaviour.\\n\\nIt incentivises people to make larger trades to earn more Looksrare tokens.\\n\\nSuch an incentive structure has made them equal in terms of popularity or buzz to Opensea even though opensea has 30 times more Daily active users on its platform.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*SG8n45FhbPMn_7rIsStzEQ.png)\\n\\nCredits — <https://dune.xyz/hildobby/LooksRare-VS-OpenSea>\\n\\nSimilar explanation with more math on why wash trading as a strategy might turn out to be good.\\n\\nDisclosure — Is an investor in LooksRare\\n\\nTrade-based Incentives lead to most of the volumes being generated by wash trades; it’s not like all of the transactions happening are wash trades, but more or less 70% should fall into that category.\\n\\n**TLDR:** Wash trading is a marketing strategy to gain eyeballs and make them the No2 player on everyone’s mind.\\n\\nCombine all of this with the fact that\\n\\n* They distribute all the platform fees back to the people who have staked their coins.\\n* 70% of the whole protocol is community-owned.\\n* They have not forked the project and have genuinely tried to make something original with Unique features (ex. Collection offer)\\n\\nIt gives them an excellent probability of actually succeeding in cementing them in the Nft exosystem.\\n\\nWith all that said, the reality of the situation is\\n\\nIt is not going to be an easy battle for Looksrare; Opensea is in no way stopping or slowing down. Even though Looksrare has got a very good start, building an awesome and innovative marketplace will eventually decide if they can succeed.\\n\\nAirdropping tokens to thousands of people does help, but the advantage they give is very short-lived and replicable by different teams quite easily; I expect to see quite a few airdrops happening this year, which would try to swing the market away from Opensea and Looksrare and only the actual innovative builders and a vibrant community will survive.\\n\\nI am definitely game for it and personally invested in Looksrare; whatever happens, what seems inevitable is a real decentralised opensea competitor is around the horizon, and I hope it turns out to be Looksrare.\\n\\nMy 2 Rupees on what Looksrare team should be working on next\\n\\n* They stuck a chord with the entire community when they introduced the concept of collection offer — where instead of looking at the Unique value of every asset, they are looking at the overall value of the collection. Looksrare should further double down on this opportunity by\\n* Creating fractional ownership of Nft’s possible.\\n* Making it even more liquid by making the whole collection tradeable similar to phunks token.\\n* Going Multichain as soon as possible — The world will be multichain so should the next biggest Nft marketplace.\\n* Focus on the gaming ecosystem and creating a specialised experience for gaming-focused Nft projects\\n\\nI am very hopeful about the future of both the Industry and Looksrare in general; As always, the focus is not to be 100% accurate but to start a discussion and I would love for us to take this conversation forward.
