"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Since the beginning of time, millions of people have theorized and questioned the point of our existence.  As a species, we get stuck on the minute details of such theories, which in turn creates a division amongst the human race.  A division that has cost the lives of many of those who had found their own purpose in different moral frameworks with quite similar messages.  How moral is it to project your opinions of faith onto others who have already found their purpose through equal but separate belief systems?  How moral is it to assume that anyone who doesn’t believe a 2,000 year-old book to the tee will be condemned to an eternal pit of fire based on aspects beyond their control?  Most religious ideology implies that only one of these belief systems can be correct, or none of them are.  But what if I told you that we may all be somewhat correct in our theories?  As a species, we have lost our ability to see the bigger picture of existence.  We must look at the trends across all of the different theories and beliefs in order to comprise a necessary update for the origins and purpose of consciousness.  With very evident evolutionary growth, human intelligence and access to new information is at its peak.  We now know a lot more about our surroundings than we ever have before.  Therefore we should not be satisfied with a set of dogmatic rules contrived over 20 centuries ago; we must continue to develop these ideas in order to progress as a species.  We must come together, understand our differences, and be willing to accept new possible explanations.  With a collective basis of information for the topic of human consciousness and our existence as a whole, I have composed an unbiased formulation as to the purpose of human consciousness based on the striking consistencies across all theories.**\\n\\n**Consciousness exists outside of the human brain.  Human functions operate as a filter to a greater consciousness of the entire cosmos, or, everything we know to exist outside of self that is perceived through our individual lenses.  In each separate level of “intelligence” within organisms, there are key differences to be noted.  Humans are perceived to be the most intelligent form of life as we know of today.  This is largely due to our substantial brains which operate with the highest level of efficiency in comparison to our lesser counterparts.  The most intelligent forms of life, including humans, have 5 or more senses, in which organisms can perceive all of the stimuli in a worldview through a combination of each of their senses that paints the picture to reality.  There are several other organisms that have all of the same senses that we humans have, and more.  At the base level of consciousness, there are organisms that only have one sense of perception (i.e. worms only are able to perceive with the sense of touch.)  When we go even further down the line, there are forms of life that have absolutely none of the 5 human senses, such as plants and bacteria.  Nonetheless, everything is still “living.”  If we were to imagine what it would be like to be a worm, for example, we would have no understanding as to what it is like to see, hear, smell, and taste.  Thus, our worldview would be entirely different and probably somewhat dissatisfying.  Although, we know that there is much more to life than just what a worm experiences.  The worm is to us as we are to the “greater consciousness” in theory.  All of our senses have a limited spectrum; we only perceive the things that fall within a certain frequency.  It would simply be selfish to assume that we are the ultimate form of consciousness when considering how much we don’t know about our surroundings, how we got here, and what our purpose is.  Because we are locked into one experience in one human body, it is difficult for us to perceive what it’s like to feel anything else.**  \\n\\n**Although, there are ways to alter consciousness during the human experience.  Firstly and most naturally, we can meditate.  Through holotropic breathing techniques and other meditative exercises, we are able to fully immerse ourselves in “nothingness,” where thought intrusion is nearly eliminated, and time, space, and ego are far less important.  Another option is to consume substances that we find within the landscape of our existence.  The substances that humans consume alter our consciousness for different reasons, but the most fascinating of them in my eyes are psychoactive substances, otherwise known as “psychedelics.”  All of these substances are naturally derived from plant life and some even occur naturally in the human brain.  Why would such mind-altering substances exist in nature?  There are really only two possible explanations I can conceive of.  First, it could be a natural survival response that inhibits the functional abilities of anyone or anything that tries to consume it.  Although, why would these plants employ such a tactic after already being eaten?  The second explanation would be that these plants exist to aid the wellbeing of all conscious beings.  This would explain why DMT, regarded by many to be the most powerful psychedelic compound, is actively released in the brain of all living organisms in similar amounts to serotonin.  When these substances are consumed, there is a recurring theme of experience that entails the meeting of “entities”, understanding life more in depth in and of its true form -- where most have stated that reality feels even more “real,” and a feeling of connectivity with the rest of the universe.  In turn, a large number of people who try these substances become more compassionate towards all life-forms and lose their fear of death.  The same types of experiences are also reported during near-death instances, even when brain activity shuts off entirely.  There is hard evidence for some of these psychedelic substances being consumed in ancient rituals, which is thought to have been the basis for all religious ideology.**  \\n\\n**Since we are confined to a simplistic language of communication and some cognitive ability flaws, the human race has produced more than 3,000 different religious beliefs.  This is simply a translation error at its highest form.  There is nothing more telling than a personal experience of meeting God, Allah, Shiva, the “divine energy” or whatever you want to call it.  These different stories likely came from individual experiences that discuss the same idea of a higher being, for lack of a better term.  To explain how everything came to be, we feel the need to use laws of science that are tried and tested in our plane of existence.  “Something can’t come from nothing,” so where did we come from?  In each different theory of our inception, including a large majority of religious beliefs, spiritual ideas, and even the simulation theory, we consistently consider an eternal being to be the best explanation.  If there is a god, who/what made god?  If we are in a simulation, who/what made the simulation?  Who/what made the creator of the simulation?  All of these questions are faced with a roadblock, and therefore, our answer can only be either an eternal being, or an infinite chain of “creators.”  We aren’t able to fully understand what eternity is, since our human lives are very much finite.  But we are able to conceptualize this idea, which is a step in the right path.**\\n\\n**In an attempt to explain our purpose or meaning for life within a restricted language, we must use two fundamental ideas: eternity and balance.  As far as we know, space & time do not have an end, and most likely, don’t have a beginning either.  As aforementioned, we have to use some form of eternity to explain our origins.  But then the question remains, why would there even be life as we know it?  Why wouldn’t everything just exist in eternity?  The answer is balance.  Eternal “rest” of the cosmos would probably get pretty old after a while.  A temporary consciousness with freedom of ideas, decisions, and creativity gives a necessary break in eternity.  This idea of balance is nothing new to us, and is symbolized throughout all of human consciousness.  Would we truly appreciate the good things in life if everything was always good?  We need a balance in order to truly realize how wonderful life can be.  To this day, scientists are still unable to explain exactly why we need sleep.  All we know is that it recharges our brain, and that if we don’t get enough of it, we don’t function properly.  My answer to why we need sleep is the same as to why I believe we experience a temporary consciousness; we need a balance.  Another form of symbolism is present within our most vital region of information processing that comprises the entirety of our identity: the brain.  We strategically have two hemispheres of our brain; The left hemisphere of the brain is involved in rational thinking and cognitive abilities and the right hemisphere is our center for creativity and out-of-the-box ideas.  While I support science and its credibility 100%, we should not only use rational thinking for the basis of our existence.  We have the right hemisphere for a reason, which is why spiritual ideas are so prevalent in our culture.**  \\n\\n**Which is a more absurd idea?  That we essentially get one lifetime and our experiences are limited to individual human consciousness, or that we may just be involved in a field of limitless energy that has vast abilities for higher and/or differing states of consciousness?  From a scientific perspective, there is no evidence to suggest that there is a continuation of experience upon the cessation of life.  Although, when considering how long spiritual practices have been incorporated amongst high-intelligence individuals and communities, and how much these practices have aided in personal and communal growth, it seems fairly evident that the human race has been, and still is, attempting to explain the seemingly unexplainable -- that all observable life is connected in some way.  This idea seems entirely rational when we look more in depth at the chemical makeup of all species, the planet, and the universe in relation to one another.  First and foremost, regardless of the incredible variety of plants and animals with extraordinary functions and abilities, all organisms are built from a combination of six essential ingredients: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.  These are the same ingredients scattered across the universe within every known galaxy.  Not only are the same compounds present within each of us, they are everywhere, all the time.  Additionally, each and every life form has an innate drive to reproduce and preserve the natural environment.  Why would that be?  The most reasonable explanation is that we each play a minute role in a much larger scheme of things.  To exemplify this, we can take a microscope to any living organism and dissect its components.  When we do as such, we observe a variety of cells with specific functions that make up a whole being.  These cells with different shapes, movements, and capabilities are all made up of the same ingredients, down to the smallest observable unit: atoms.  It also turns out that the largest observable “unit,” the universe, is made up of trillions and trillions of atoms, as well as “dark matter.”  Hence, we may not be able to ever fully understand what the greater purpose of the cosmos is with our human capacities, just as individual cells probably aren’t aware of their role relative to the organism.  The idea of “faith” likely stems from an inherent comprehension of the bigger picture.**\\n\\n**While the hypothesis of interconnectivity is nothing new to mankind and is purely speculation, it seems as though the masses are congregating towards religious ideas without religious dogmatism, which may go hand in hand with the concept.  It’s important to note this shift in society.  We empirically know that as a species, we continue to progress and evolve as time goes on.  Newer generations are collectively more open-minded than any other generation, despite the apparent negative perception of Millennials and Gen Z’s.  Perhaps evolution is playing it’s part once again, and is allowing for a revolution in the way our species views such topics of consciousness and purpose.**\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1640787571,\"title\":\"Consciousness & Purpose: The Greatest
