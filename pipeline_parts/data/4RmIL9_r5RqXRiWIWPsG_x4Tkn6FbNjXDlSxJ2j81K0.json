Description\\n\\n[Apprecio.Finance](https://apprecio.finance) is a decentralized inflation dashboard for multiple countries. Starting with Mexico as the minimum viable product. The next step: United States of America ([white paper](https://mirror.xyz/espejel.eth/GeYEoRFxF-HSaZr78pjeAx-3yTvcpAH7yd64bgL7ajI)).\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d2H3M7RkuBBOh2QkVb4zM.png?height=415&width=1440&&&&&&&size=medium)\\n\\n## 2. Problem\\n\\nThe increase in inflation rates could encourage governments to intervene in the measurement of inflation.\\n\\n## 3. Why\\n\\nIn general, **inflation is not desired by governments in turn** (see [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-worry-biden-could-pay-the-political-price-for-rising-inflation/2022/01/12/6f76ba68-73c7-11ec-8b0a-bcfab800c430_story.html), [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/24/us/politics/biden-inflation-prices.html)). However, **when economic actors expect inflation to rise, they can influence real price**s and fulfill the prophecy. Therefore, one way to undermine the development of inflation is to **influence (or censor) inflation expectations** (see the simplified figure below). Therefore, there is an **incentive to intervene in the evolution of inflation expectations.** One way to do this is by censoring or tampering with inflation data, which creates the n**eed for an uncensorable tool to measure actual inflation** (more details below).\\n\\n![Simplification of the process in which inflation expectations can affect actual inflation.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZktkHWP6HdzxIvLlhkNTn.png?height=1977&width=3949&&&&&&&&size=medium)\\n\\n### Step 1: Higher inflation expectations could lead to higher inflation rates\\n\\nIndividuals change their behavior according to what they believe prices will be in the future, these are called [inflation expectations](https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/cleveland-fed-digest/ask-the-expert/ate-20190528-rich.aspx) (expected rate of increase in prices).\\n\\nHere are examples of actions that actors in the economy **might take when they expect high inflation**:\\n\\n1. People might **increase their spending today to get cheaper prices**. However, increased spending will tend to push prices up.\\n2. Workers may **seek higher wages in anticipation of a rising cost of living**. Higher wages would drive up prices since **(1)** firms would tend to raise the prices of their products to pay for higher labor costs, and **(2)** workers can now purchase more goods in the economy by raising prices.\\n3. Firms may **raise their own prices in anticipation of, for example, higher prices from their suppliers and wages**. This anticipation of high prices would tend to push prices higher (this example was given in the reverse order [here](https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/cleveland-fed-digest/ask-the-expert/ate-20190528-rich.aspx)).\\n\\n**In other words, inflation expectations can affect actual inflation.** If economic actors expect higher inflation, inflation could rise and vice versa ([Director of Cleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation Research](https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/cleveland-fed-digest/ask-the-expert/ate-20190528-rich.aspx), 2019).\\n\\n### Step 2: So Controlling Inflation Expectations Might Lower Inflation\\n\\n> “If enough of the right people believe that inflation is going to happen, it will. As such, when inflation is happening, there is often a push to *censor* discussion of inflation itself, under the grounds that discussing the problem actually causes it in the first place.” ([1720 Newsletter](https://1729.com/inflation), 2021)\\n\\nStakeholders that benefit from a lower rate of inflation, such as a government, could benefit from avoiding expectations of high inflation (for example, by [arguing that inflation is transitory](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/10/business/economy/inflation-markets-federal-reserve.html), not to worry).\\n\\nIn the worst case, governments could censor discussions of inflation. The [Argentine government](https://qz.com/84838/argentines-are-now-allowed-to-know-the-real-rate-of-inflation-thanks-to-their-courts/) went so far as to prohibit the general public from creating their own inflation measures, citizens must believe the rate they publish centrally.\\n\\nThis might not present a credible threat today in advanced economies. However, the incentives exist and it is something that we cannot let go. Even less when there is a technology that can provide us with an alternative: the blockchain.\\n\\n## 4. How Apprecio.Finance looks like\\n\\nWe calculate inflation in a descentrally way and store it in the Ethereum blockchain (Kovan testnet for version 0.2) so that no one can censor it.\\n\\nThe mvp for Mexico consists of 3 layers of decentralization that can be replicated for the next countries.\\n\\nTo achieve the highest possible resistance to censorship, AF implements decentralization at three different times in its design. The following figure captures them.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/L-CU5HxmQbE9FJpO3zWQ2.png?height=3295&width=1428)\\n\\nWe deeply believe in the impact that a decentralized inflation measure could have on the world economy. While we haven't (yet) figured out a business model. This can be the beginning of a strong community that guarantees the quality of life, purchasing power and assets of the citizens of the States of the network throughout the world.\\n\\nPlease refer to the [Apprecio.Finance whitepaper](https://mirror.xyz/espejel.eth/GeYEoRFxF-HSaZr78pjeAx-3yTvcpAH7yd64bgL7ajI) for more details.\\n\\n## Sources\\n\\n* Rob Rich, Director of Cleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation Research (2019). “[What are inflation expectations, and why do they matter?](https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/cleveland-fed-digest/ask-the-expert/ate-20190528-rich.aspx)”.
