Voters do not have the opportunity to choose freely. They have no choice.\\\"\\n\\nCiting his own country Brazil as an example, Marco Fernandes, a research fellow from the Tricontinental Institute for Social Research, said the US has been undermining democracy in other countries.\\n\\nBy applying a new mechanism called \\\"lawfare\\\", the US government would carry out political persecutions against progressive leaders in Latin American countries that are not aligned with the White House, and accuses them of corruption \\\"with no evidence, but massively repeated by the mainstream and social media\\\", he said.\\n\\nHe also called on the world to support the efforts of China and many other countries of the Global South that are making efforts to build a real multilateral forum.\",\"timestamp\":1638971813,\"title\":\"10 questions, but few answers expected from US\"},\"digest\":\"dTWfaMImGGtEhkKvaun0cR92fK8i_MPP7chTWM4Jt1k\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xb792afe963Cd871aC02d7cCed3cb32230Fe2A937\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"WsQGv3sedUUCoMN6LDt7vM48szhruFf815uRm7rCIPE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FoSFz30ISJbSgS27POkOO3CekP3oLAi30swCqQlWlo4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"RZt7777Ia5_csq8k75TeH9JG_lxC0pJyQF-nyIaFnrFwigZeCMglgxZv-PqCTkqo4B6EhrBkGskMWEul2fL8UQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9404f5f2041f453c46e5568bcf099aca844628430855fd26cc5bd5aa763761fc3639feb5275f42fc42b9719c204d6e7b3b2868b1171e0bccff1eb81de223c0ff1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"WsQGv3sedUUCoMN6LDt7vM48szhruFf815uRm7rCIPE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FoSFz30ISJbSgS27POkOO3CekP3oLAi30swCqQlWlo4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"dTWfaMImGGtEhkKvaun0cR92fK8i_MPP7chTWM4Jt1k\"}"
