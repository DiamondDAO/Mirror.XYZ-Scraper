"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Chinese culture is broad and profound, and literary literacy is everyone's spiritual embodiment. With the passage of time, Chinese literacy has been divided into high and low. So as teenagers, how should we improve our Chinese literacy?\\n\\n \\n\\nI think the most important thing is the acquisition of extracurricular literary knowledge. Gorky once said: books are the ladder of human progress. It can be seen that books have played a vital role in improving Chinese literacy. It is with books that we can have countless opportunities to communicate with scholars. As Zhou Guoping once said: reading is the spiritual exchange with great men. Such communication is undoubtedly a necessary magic weapon to improve Chinese literacy. \\\"There is a golden house in the book, and there is a face like jade in the book.\\\" In the eyes of the ancients, books were higher than gold. To improve Chinese literacy is to enter the text and feel the most delicate feelings and profound thoughts in a book. Integrate yourself into the characters in the book and appreciate all kinds of forms. Through the understanding of words, we can improve what we think.\\n\\n \\n\\nSecondly, listening attentively, thinking independently and self perception in class are also essential. Teachers' guidance and vivid teaching also create great opportunities for our Chinese literacy. \\\"Teachers, so preaching, teaching and dispelling doubts.\\\" Han Yu said so in Shi Shuo. The teacher's teaching undoubtedly creates ideas and inspiration for us in the face of Chinese, and also provides methods and models for our answer and writing. What we need to do is to feel the words, think independently and improve our internal literary literacy.\\n\\n \\n\\nFinally, the necessary social practical experience is also required. We are in an information-based society. The rapid change of information inevitably leads to text errors. We should be good at perceiving information and give our own opinions on the words in the information. We should know how to seek advantages and avoid disadvantages, feel good words, and get a good promotion of literary literacy. Do not choose the wrong literature and information.\\n\\n \\n\\nAs middle school students, what should we do? \\\"Good reading, good reading\\\" is one of them. \\\"Mastering knowledge and using it flexibly\\\" is also the key.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe improvement of Chinese literacy is just as Qu Yuan said, \\\"the road is long and long, I will seek from top to bottom.\\\" Let's improve our Chinese literacy together.\",\"timestamp\":1639148867,\"title\":\"CULTHER\"},\"digest\":\"uU3EokzqYJaQpBqYOLvij7TKz7ciZNP0A5wxL5L7xsw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x48CBCeAb076756B1964dC973EddcAEF0758627DE\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LJTE9_ds2QnH28myCfKI0TqKXRSe6vmuZbkJfcETXsM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zJ4HOcedSOh1akfb_92Pv1K7UjXMQP4l1lPqJZHZN6I\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"FotvPM1mKZxcrVl00Ka8o23adpTQ5kw5eiJjhdvZgRVyXvfsB6gw99ws0Lt9HV72-m03KI5iaqYVDV27o31zCA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x103fb5d56616841a6d8ef0a0e9ff2fd3989db74dcc675d2ac5d557510b3e4f7c54b82e54c8ec17ee038bc00649bfb9cffe2d6a1a92e701512a718ba648e22cd11b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LJTE9_ds2QnH28myCfKI0TqKXRSe6vmuZbkJfcETXsM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zJ4HOcedSOh1akfb_92Pv1K7UjXMQP4l1lPqJZHZN6I\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"uU3EokzqYJaQpBqYOLvij7TKz7ciZNP0A5wxL5L7xsw\"}"
