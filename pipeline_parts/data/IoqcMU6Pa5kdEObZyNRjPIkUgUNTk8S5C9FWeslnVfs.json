"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"is most painful to me to see a fair lady cry. After all, your son\\n\\nbears the name of Husson, and if my dear deceased wife were living she\\n\\nwould wish to do something for the name of her father and of her\\n\\nbrother--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She loved her brother,\\\" said Oscar's mother.\\n\\n\\\"But all my fortune is given to my children, who expect nothing from\\n\\nme at my death,\\\" continued the old man. \\\"I have divided among them the\\n\\nmillions that I had, because I wanted to see them happy and enjoying\\n\\ntheir wealth during my lifetime. I have nothing now except an annuity;\\n\\nand at my age one clings to old habits. Do you know the path on which\\n\\nyou ought to start this young fellow?\\\" he went on, after calling to\\n\\nOscar and taking him by the arm. \\\"Let him study law; I'll pay the\\n\\ncosts. Put him in a lawyer's office and let him learn the business of\\n\\npettifogging; if he does well, if he distinguishes himself, if he\\n\\nlikes his profession and I am still alive, each of my children shall,\\n\\nwhen the proper time comes, lend him a quarter of the cost of a\\n\\npractice; and I will be security for him. You will only have to feed\\n\\nand clothe him. Of course he'll sow a few wild oats, but he'll learn\\n\\nlife. Look at me: I left Lyon with two double louis which my\\n\\ngrandmother gave me, and walked to Paris; and what am I now? Fasting\\n\\nis good for the health. Discretion, honesty, and work, young man, and\\n\\nyou'll succeed. There's a great deal of pleasure in earning one's\\n\\nfortune; and if a man keeps his teeth he eats what he likes in his old\\n\\nage, and sings, as I do, 'La Mere Godichon.' Remember my words:\\n\\nHonesty, work, discretion.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you hear that, Oscar?\\\" said his mother. \\\"Your uncle sums up in\\n\\nthree words all that I have been saying to you. You ought to carve the\\n\\nlast word in letters of fire on your memory.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I have,\\\" said Oscar.\\n\\n\\\"Very good,--then thank your uncle; didn't you hear him say he would\\n\\ntake charge of your future? You will be a lawyer in Paris.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He doesn't see the grandeur of his destiny,\\\" said the little old man,\\n\\nobserving Oscar's apathetic air. \\\"Well, he's just out of school.\\n\\nListen, I'm no talker,\\\" he continued; \\\"but I have this to say:\\n\\nRemember that at your age honesty and uprightness are maintained only\\n\\nby resisting temptations; of which, in a great city like Paris, there\\n\\nare many at every step. Live in your mother's home, in the garret; go\\n\\nstraight to the law-school; from there to your lawyer's office; drudge\\n\\nnight and day, and study at home. Become, by the time you are twenty-\\n\\ntwo, a second clerk; by the time you are twenty-four, head-clerk; be\\n\\nsteady, and you will win all. If, moreover, you shouldn't like the\\n\\nprofession, you might enter the office of my son the notary, and\\n\\neventually succeed him. Therefore, work, patience, discretion,\\n\\nhonesty,--those are your landmarks.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"God grant that you may live thirty years longer to see your fifth\\n\\nchild realizing all we expect from him,\\\" cried Madame Clapart, seizing\\n\\nuncle Cardot's hand and pressing it with a gesture that recalled her\\n\\nyouth.\\n\\n\\\"Now come to breakfast,\\\" replied the kind old man, leading Oscar by\\n\\nthe ear.\\n\\nDuring the meal uncle Cardot observed his nephew without appearing to\\n\\ndo so, and soon saw that the lad knew nothing of life.\\n\\n\\\"Send him here to me now and then,\\\" he said to Madame Clapart, as he\\n\\nbade her good-bye, \\\"and I'll form him for you.\\\"\\n\\nThis visit calmed the anxieties of the poor mother, who had not hoped\\n\\nfor such brilliant success. For the next fortnight she took Oscar to\\n\\nwalk daily, and watched him tyrannically. This brought matters to the\\n\\nend of October. One morning as the poor household was breakfasting on\\n\\na salad of herring and lettuce, with milk for a dessert, Oscar beheld\\n\\nwith terror the formidable ex-steward, who entered the room and\\n\\nsurprised this scene of poverty.\\n\\n\\\"We are now living in Paris--but not as we lived at Presles,\\\" said\\n\\nMoreau, wishing to make known to Madame Clapart the change in their\\n\\nrelations caused by Oscar's folly. \\\"I shall seldom be here myself; for\\n\\nI have gone into partnership with Pere Leger and Pere Margueron of\\n\\nBeaumont. We are speculating in land, and we have begun by purchasing\\n\\nthe estate of Persan. I am the head of the concern, which has a\\n\\ncapital of a million; part of which I have borrowed on my own\\n\\nsecurities. When I find a good thing, Pere Leger and I examine it; my\\n\\npartners have each a quarter and I a half in the profits; but I do\\n\\nnearly all the work, and for that reason I shall be constantly on the\\n\\nroad. My wife lives here, in the faubourg du Roule, very plainly. When\\n\\nwe see how the business turns out, if we risk only the profits, and if\\n\\nOscar behaves himself, we may, perhaps, employ him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah! my friend, the catastrophe caused by my poor boy's heedlessness\\n\\nmay prove to be the cause of your making a brilliant fortune; for,\\n\\nreally and truly, you were burying your energy and your capacity at\\n\\nPresles.\\\"\\n\\nMadame Clapart then went on to relate her visit to uncle Cardot, in\\n\\norder to show Moreau that neither she nor her son need any longer be a\\n\\nburden on him.\\n\\n\\\"He is right, that old fellow,\\\" said the ex-steward. \\\"We must hold\\n\\nOscar in that path with an iron hand, and he will end as a barrister\\n\\nor a notary. But he mustn't leave the track; he must go straight\\n\\nthrough with it. Ha! I know how to help you. The legal business of\\n\\nland-agents is quite important, and I have heard of a lawyer who has\\n\\njust bought what is called a \\\"titre nu\\\"; that means a practice without\\n\\nclients. He is a young man, hard as an iron bar, eager for work,\\n\\nferociously active. His name is Desroches. I'll offer him our business\\n\\non condition that he takes Oscar as a pupil; and I'll ask him to let\\n\\nthe boy live with him at nine hundred francs a year, of which I will\\n\\npay three, so that your son will cost you only six hundred francs,\\n\\nwithout his living, in future. If the boy ever means to become a man\\n\\nit can only be under a discipline like that. He'll come out of that\\n\\noffice, notary, solicitor, or barrister, as he may elect.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come, Oscar; thank our kind Monsieur Moreau, and don't stand there\\n\\nlike a stone post. All young men who commit follies have not the good\\n\\nfortune to meet with friends who still take an interest in their\\n\\ncareer, even after they have been injured by them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The best way to make your peace with me,\\\" said Moreau, pressing\\n\\nOscar's hand, \\\"is to work now with steady application, and to conduct\\n\\nyourself in future properly.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\nTRICKS AND FARCES OF THE EMBRYO LONG ROBE\\n\\nTen days later, Oscar was taken by Monsieur Moreau to Maitre\\n\\nDesroches, solicitor, recently established in the rue de Bethisy, in a\\n\\nvast apartment at the end of a narrow court-yard, for which he was\\n\\npaying a relatively low price.\\n\\nDesroches, a young man twenty-six years of age, born of poor parents,\\n\\nand brought up with extreme severity by a stern father, had himself\\n\\nknown the condition in which Oscar now was. Accordingly, he felt an\\n\\ninterest in him, but the sort of interest which alone he could take,\\n\\nchecked by the apparent harshness that characterized him. The aspect\\n\\nof this gaunt young man, with a muddy skin and hair cropped like a\\n\\nclothes-brush, who was curt of speech and possessed a piercing eye and\\n\\na gloomy vivaciousness, terrified the unhappy Oscar.\",\"timestamp\":1637316481,\"title\":\"\\n\\n\\\"Listen to me, madame,\\\" said the little old man, \\\"and don't weep; it\"},\"digest\":\"qaxA2VrabnqPf8GbhmFxLvR3zxgY1dITHpEJ_ihtIik\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xBD285526750c6d1e9c301005d31Fcad2bE9E9AA0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"sJX3GWZarO8FjwGSv68PUqxbbXz7OfgAGh0nM_nOPOs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dryFLbgmzAST0Nn1jB_Zw4x9c-GBqoXZJHYsFQhED1I\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Bh_mTgb5dB_8--C9V8IcH9RDhHu9iwOd_l_BlS5Pnm0zlv1iQXSBD2sA21JkYZUxYWK2cJPhF_iNPFvFTOsfzw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd687e945a3aa76771358e63fc9b70bf7b3bd88d0bc83632527eac848c20d50fd1c8cc4d107ae951923305820d49df9dce62ce4d4dfd603bca27c1d69a2b2ac921b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"sJX3GWZarO8FjwGSv68PUqxbbXz7OfgAGh0nM_nOPOs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dryFLbgmzAST0Nn1jB_Zw4x9c-GBqoXZJHYsFQhED1I\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"qaxA2VrabnqPf8GbhmFxLvR3zxgY1dITHpEJ_ihtIik\"}"
