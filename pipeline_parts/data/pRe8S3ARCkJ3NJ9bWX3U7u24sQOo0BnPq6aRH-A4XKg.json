"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Social networks are the place we share everything from baby photos to political opinions.  These network are our de-facto public squares and the culture they enable and incentivize has real-world implications that touch all of our lives.\\n\\n> “Ask yourself, what are we doing here as a species, for the most part, we're creating and consuming culture. The near term goal should be pretty obvious, we have to build a culture that is conducive to sanity.\\n>\\n> We need a culture that is at minimum compatible with our long term survival. And we have serious problems to solve.  Infrastructure, pandemic preparedness, climate change, cybersecurity, education, wealth inequality, our relationship with China.\\n>\\n> Wouldn't it be amazing to just get busy and sort this stuff out without all the animosity and conspiracy thinking and dogmatism and perverse incentives and everything else that makes sane policies and compromises impossible?”\\n>\\n> \\\\- [Sam Harris](https://www.samharris.org/) (Neuroscientist, Philosopher, Best Selling Author)\\n\\nThis quote resonates because most of us want to live in a culture that is conducive to sanity and compatible with our long term survival… and that everything else is pretty accurate too.  Sam was able to articulate a reality, a way to think about the world, that the vast majority of us should be able comprehend.  \\n\\nGood idea’s, like this new way to think about culture, can change the world if given the space to grow and the network to reach the right people.  We believe that in order to shift our culture to the one we want we need to build a new type of network to power that shift.\\n\\nThat network is Chaos.  Chaos is “an anonymous brainstorming network” (but that’s a mouthful so if you’ve got a better idea [Tweet at us](https://twitter.com/trychaos_ai).)\\n\\nThis new network doesn’t work like a social network in two very important ways:\\n\\n1 - Every post is anonymous.  This means you can’t shoot the messenger, which is great for the message and the messenger.  On Chaos you can’t destroy an idea by destroying the creator.  \\n\\n2 - There are no followers.  Your distribution and influence are driven by your positive contributions to the community.  Act in bad faith and no one will see what you have to say.  Contribute constructively and you can become an influential thought leader regardless of your current social network celebrity.\\n\\nOur mission is to unlock the power of collective intelligence.  We’ve got a long way to go, but if this is something you want to be a part of we’d love you to [join our beta](https://www.trychaos.ai/)!
