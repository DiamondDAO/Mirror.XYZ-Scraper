"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Hey followers! Thanks for the eyes as I discuss how NFT minting and selling compares on 3 platforms: Opensea.io, RARI, and Mirror.XYZ. I am currently writing this blog on Mirror.XYZ, the only NFT platform I’ve seen so far that has blogging capabilities. It’s not without its faults of course, but it’s definitely something I can sink my teeth into.\\n\\nMirror.XYZ: Mirror has a very simple approach to NFT minting that has an instagram-esque feel to it. You post a picture and write a description with enabling the creation of an NFT. I feel like maybe I’m selling out if I made every post and NFT. Trying to make money off of every post? Yea I guess so, I’d rather do ads or receive tipping from BAT somehow. Mirror has two NFT modes and I went through one of them, the other has the NFT, description, and a cover photo. I guess to categorize your own NFT. It costs money to mint these NFT because a transaction needs gas to mint something. Not really at the fault of Mirror either, so I won’t hold it against them. However, I’m not seeing a main feed, this is my second post and there doesn’t seem to be a direct way to buy them here if you made them here. It does let you send them to auctioning websites like RARI or opensea.io, but I’m guessing that costs gas as well, or maybe not I’m unsure. I do see my NFTs show up in my metamask wallet.\\n\\nHere’s the NFT I minted on Mirror.XYZ and can show here because I bought a copy:\\n\\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=3144](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=3144)\\n\\nI made it real cheap if you want to buy a test NFT. I had this GIF laying around from an old project, but the small red buses are supposed to be moving. So here’s another point: Mirror.XYZ can upload .jpg, .png, .gif, and .mp4. The .mp4 and .gif formats infer the use of animations or videos. But when I uploaded my old .gif it came up as a still image, this all makes me think I did it wrong. I bought my own NFT to check it out (Congrats on my first NFT). On metamask it’s still but I can easily pull it up. This fault is on the side of Mirror.XYZ, I see my own NFT animations but they are unmoving, on the tutorial I see moving animations but not on my own NFT and not on others in a feed. I mean the strangest thing is the top guy on the leaderboard of the $write race has nothing on their page (assuming lots of genders there). Is this project dead? I can’t tell.\\n\\nOpensea.io: When it comes to Opensea.io, all I really think of is disappointment. Be careful about what you buy in Opensea.io, because it won’t show up in your Metamask at all, this is really more of a complaint with Metamask. Be wary of Opensea.io, it has been through its own hacking attempt. Just make sure you practice good internet hygiene (wash yo a$$). Great, the site is down, the hallmark of an early project.\\n\\nCheck out the NFT I bought and can show here because I bought it:\\n\\n[https://rarible.com/token/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e:15856337856917357433264578137314620566549072045013887703133172295180675448833?tab=owners](https://rarible.com/token/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e:15856337856917357433264578137314620566549072045013887703133172295180675448833?tab=owners)\\n\\nRARI: I actually have warmed up to RARI, I was bit angry with her because she lost a lot of my money but she’s just so darn cute. RARI approaches the selling of NFTs a different way, by allowing the artist to pass the cost of minting onto the consumer, thereby allowing less fortunate artists to participate (That’s me, I'm the artist, buy my NFT). All that gas stuff, blah blah blah, don’t worry about it, it’s all about the art and getting it out there. Minting is set to buyer, artist sets royalty per sale. Anytime the NFT exchanges hands, the artist gets their desired pay. I’m sure some poor artists will rise quickly if their art stands the test of critique. Like the Dallas 2045 NFT, it appears you do not have to send the NFT to RARI, it’s already there in your wallet.\\n\\n[https://rarible.com/token/0xdf5b5ee15cc96ba7d0cb6bd9b2c0fc4417ab6445:2808?tab=details](https://rarible.com/token/0xdf5b5ee15cc96ba7d0cb6bd9b2c0fc4417ab6445:2808?tab=details)\\n\\nI also might as well talk about what kind of NFT would be good and popular for the future to come? My guess is gaming NFTs, Something you can put in a game and maybe it’s very common, like a fancy mushroom. A developer makes a game, but they can buy the gaming assets for SANDBOX right off of RARI, they just rearrange it in game maker. So I also made a conceptual NFT, the RUBY. I can show it here because I know nobody has bought it.\\n\\n[https://rarible.com/token/0xB66a603f4cFe17e3D27B87a8BfCaD319856518B8:101406104142746972506323020995500375078788423500898967751343137345798494224385?tab=owners](https://rarible.com/token/0xB66a603f4cFe17e3D27B87a8BfCaD319856518B8:101406104142746972506323020995500375078788423500898967751343137345798494224385?tab=owners)\\n\\nIt has a flexible frame of 64 x 64, shine animation, the conversion to a .GIF seems to have made it blurry. But if used at its original size it would still be a good asset to use as an icon. A game developer could be making a Gameboy-esque game and use it as an icon for a menu item. It’s cheap for them, they would have to buy a lot to make an easy game at scale. If they were cheap enough then it might take no time at all, and save payment for when the game is finished. Assets may grow in that time if the artist knows their asset is being used, or they may grow organically, so there are benefits to buying them early. The main problem is that I made a gaming asset for a gaming style that isn’t presented in the crypto world, maybe in Decentraland. So I need to make an NFT that applies to a game that already exists, and so I found the SANDBOX. I will look into Decentraland but I’m not a fan of the Zucc. I had to hook up my beefy computer again but it can definitely handle it easily and the computer is still in good shape, I’m excited. I will try to make some basic gaming NFT for RARI (stone sword, silver sword, gold sword) as the sandbox asset area is small. Their collection is impressive, but there’s rooms for outsiders to make decent and usable NFT.\\n\\nAll I have to say is if you’re good in art and want an opportunity, think about making NFTs specifically for the Sandbox. So Opensea.io is still in development, RARI is good to use for the artist, an Mirror.XYZ is good for blogging I guess.\",\"timestamp\":1641313432,\"title\":\"On NFTs in regards to Opensea.io, RARI, and Mirror.XYZ\"},\"digest\":\"P9W1nWwpnq99YXS2U7eb4mV_7LQJvfhoYB_Aw-TWZZI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2DC2AE98523E191004A657b8784230B46c0b846a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ew8CWVvhCV_fbCX7h0YWn50dbJ38gR0ue6TlaQc0Gx0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KCHeYvABNPF8OkUuV3NeSCNQMjVJ-vX7pxIvTQSTwTc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"DO7OljDAlNAaIJ3DIFmRS_Tgr7iapBYWelzNZk5oXqiUkeAKms3wRviXxevOM_gX5Rp4uOAWSniRCYs1gVcusg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9fe85d0c11132ca37e6226ce9bb41dbf1046c1a995cc66e1dbd1d71505d2c99a79f79a8dc71fa8c9a6551296b7235892beff8c5bb38047099d23a25bcb89e6961b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ew8CWVvhCV_fbCX7h0YWn50dbJ38gR0ue6TlaQc0Gx0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KCHeYvABNPF8OkUuV3NeSCNQMjVJ-vX7pxIvTQSTwTc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"E98yq--DfWSDsR3zfTPEfZz42qinWzohvIwsoKeNLYQ\"}"
