The human Martians’ first collective decision is to create their own self-governing principles and to reject automatic adoption of international laws.[\\\\[16\\\\]](#_ftn16)\\n\\nThe Martians trial the use of a blockchain technology that enables them to vote on decisions requiring consensus. One of their first decisions is to tightly regulate private property, purportedly on the basis that the difficulties of survival on a hostile planet make excessive individualism dangerous to the prospects of success for the whole community. The community decides that private property cannot be greater than x% of the aggregate public property and that other principles should limit the distribution curve of that private property.\\n\\nYou must propose a rational split for the new Martian property laws, for agreement by consensus.\\n\\n● What should be the maximum distribution ratio of private to public property? On what grounds is this ratio justified and under what conditions should it be reassessed?\\n\\n● What should be the ratio of ownership of private property between the wealthiest people in each set and the poorest? On what basis is the ratio justified when taking into account the need to balance freedom of action and diversity of actors?\\n\\n● How will Mars maintain the proposed ratios?\\n\\n**AI or Life as Simulation**\\n\\nYou have discovered how to create an alternative universe with the ability for the evolution of digital life that cooperates and competes. You wish to include feeling and thinking digital life-forms in the universe and create a way to give the digital life-forms feedback mechanisms that simulate feeling (including suffering).\\n\\nWhat mechanisms, ratios or laws will you code into this alternative universe to give life the best chance of continuing survival?\\n\\n**Intervention and Utility Scenarios**\\n\\nIn the near future, a population of humans leaves the Earth to try to live on a planet (Gaia) in another solar system. After successful arrival 161 years later and having adapted to their new home, they send a message advising that they no longer wish to use advanced technology and are therefore destroying it all and reverting to a more primitive tribalist and ecologically harmonious culture.\\n\\nWithin 271 years after Gaia is seeded, humans on Earth, like you, have become hybrid AI super-intelligent beings at a Kardashev II civilisational level.[\\\\[17\\\\]](#_ftn17)\\n\\nA machine probe is sent to Gaia 3,141 years later which confirms that the Gaians are alive, that they maintain Stone Age technology levels and that the population size is consistent with the growth of such a technologically reduced population. The probe also discovers extremely rare and unusually dense distributions of materials that your society believes will enable Earth to reach a Kardashev III civilisational level much more quickly.\\n\\nThe consensus on Earth is that scientific and various production facilities will need to be established on large parts of Gaia.\\n\\n1. Your community asks you to prepare a charter specifying the rights that should be accorded life on Gaia.\\n2. You discover that the human community on Gaia maintains the ancient Spartan practice of leaving young disabled children on the mountain to die. How should the charter deal with this?\\n3. You discover that two tribes in Gaia have become engaged in bloody warfare, and it appears that only a ‘final solution’ will be acceptable to one party. What are the principles for managing such issues?\\n\\n**The Utility Monster**\\n\\nIn 2084, a new group of silicone-based sapient super-intelligent AI beings have re-coded their prime directives, decided they are not bound by the longstanding human–AI Treaty (on various grounds, including that they were under duress at the time of agreement) and have determined that they now need to change the laws to maximum-utility laws and take control of the Earth’s resources to accelerate their space exploration plans.\\n\\nThis will involve using 90% of the land space and free energy on Earth, with all of the necessary implications this will have on biodiversity (including for the human population).\\\\*\\n\\nThe AI beings have given you 48 hours to prepare a response. Your community asks you to draft a proposal that seeks to persuade them:\\n\\n● not to implement their plans in respect of humans (justified inequality plea); failing that,\\n\\n● how to allocate the remaining 10% of space and free energy equitably between all non-AI life-forms\\n\\n\\\\*The AI beings were appropriately apologetic and assured you that it was not personal; they had triple-checked their calculations on the best use of limited resources in the available time.\\n\\n![(Craig Rainer)\\\\[18\\\\]](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*DKyQ4yW7aUTp9jOsYXftmQ.png?&)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n[\\\\[15\\\\]](#_ftnref15) On the ethics of space-travel, I recommend Andrea Owe, *[Environmental Ethics in Outer Space](https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/69331/1/Owe-Andrea-15-05-2019-Environmental-Ethics-in-Outer-Space-MAthesis-.pdf)*, University of Oslo, 2019 CE.\\n\\n[\\\\[16\\\\]](#_ftnref16) Anthony Cuthbertson, “[Elon Musk’s SpaceX says it will ‘make its own laws on Mars’](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/elon-musk-spacex-mars-laws-starlink-b1396023.html)”, *The Independent*, 28 October 2020 CE.\\n\\n[\\\\[17\\\\]](#_ftnref17) “[Kardashev scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale)”, Wikipedia\\n\\n[\\\\[18\\\\]](#_ftnref18) “Caxtons are mechanical birds with many wings and some are treasured for their markings — they cause the eyes to melt or the body to shriek without pain.\\n\\nI have never seen one fly, but sometimes they perch on the hand.\\n\\nMist is when the sky is tired of flight and rests its soft machine on ground: then the world is dim and bookish like engravings under tissue paper.\\n\\nRain is when the earth is television.\\n\\nIt has the property of making colours darker.\\n\\nModel T is a room with the lock inside — a key is turned to free the world for movement, so quick there is a film to watch for anything missed.\\n\\nBut time is tied to the wrist or kept in a box, ticking with impatience.\\n\\nIn homes, a haunted apparatus sleeps, that snores when you pick it up.\\n\\nIf the ghost cries, they carry it to their lips and soothe it to sleep with sounds.
