"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"According to Google Trends data on December 14, global searches for the term \\\"web3\\\" have risen sharply in the past three months. In fact, in contrast, over the past period of time, discussions about web3.0 have gradually heated up.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/F0RAwQvCZnZYSU-x0YJnP.png?height=282&width=600)\\n\\n## What is Web3.0\\n\\nWeb 1.0 refers to the first stage of the development of the World Wide Web, approximately from 1991 to 2004. In Web 1.0, there are few content creators, and the vast majority of users are just consumers of content. Personal web pages are very common, mainly composed of static web pages hosted on a web server operated by an ISP or hosted on a free web hosting service (such as GeoCities).\\n\\nWith the advent of Web 2.0, ordinary Internet users can own social network profiles (websites such as Myspace and Facebook) and personal blogs through low-cost web hosting services or through dedicated servers (such as Blogger or LiveJournal). Usually, the content is dynamically generated, allowing readers to post comments in a different way than before.\\n\\nWeb 2.0 is a new Internet method that promotes information exchange and collaboration between people on the network through Web Applications, and its model is more user-centric. Typical Web 2.0 sites include: online communities, web applications, social networking sites, blogs, Wikis, and so on.\\n\\nWeb 3.0 was proposed for Web 2.0. The more famous first mention was in an article criticizing Web 2.0 in Jeffrey Zeldman's blog in early 2006. In fact, since the end of 2006, the term Web 3.0 has received more and more attention and is the focus of more and more controversy. This phenomenon is continuing to the present. The debate on how to define Web 3.0 and what it represents is fierce, and there are many opinions.\\n\\nIn May 2006, Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist and inventor of the World Wide Web, said that people kept asking what Web 3.0 was. I think that when SVG is used on a large scale on the basis of Web 2.0—everything is rippled, folded and does not look water chestnut—and a whole semantic web covers a large amount of data, you can access this incredible Data resources.\\n\\nAt the Technet Summit in November 2006, Yang Zhiyuan, founder and CEO of Yahoo, pointed out that there are a lot of archives and discussions on Web 2.0. With the performance that can be achieved at the network level, the power of the network has reached a critical point. We have also seen the emergence of more advanced devices and more advanced methods of interacting with the network in the past 4 years, not only on hardware such as game consoles and mobile devices, but also on the software level. You don’t have to be a computer scientist to create a program. This phenomenon is beginning to take shape in Web 2.0, and 3.0 will deepen and become a true public carrier... The boundaries between professional, semi-professional, and consumer are getting blurred, creating a network effect of business and applications. .\\n\\nReed Hastings, founder of Netflix Netflix, explained a simple formula for defining web terms. Web 1.0 is a dial-up Internet, 50K average bandwidth, Web 2.0 is 1M average bandwidth, then Web 3.0 should be 10M bandwidth, a full-image network, which feels like Web 3.0.\\n\\nMary Meeker, the \\\"Queen of the Internet\\\" at the Web 2.0 Summit on November 16, 2010, pointed out that Web 3.0 is composed of \\\"Social Networking, Mobile and Search\\\".\\n\\n## The controversy of Web3.0\\n\\nIn fact, Web 3.0 is still difficult to be defined. In the eyes of traditional Internet people, it is a more user-friendly Internet, incorporating newer technologies, big data, artificial intelligence, etc. Computers will help you think of many things. But this will lead to issues such as information monopoly and users having no privacy.\\n\\nTherefore, in the eyes of blockchain practitioners, Web 3.0 should be a decentralized network. For example, the goal of Web3.0 is to provide a better user-centered experience in an intermediary read-write network. Technology allows individuals to control data privacy and ownership by default. Web 3.0 roughly has the following 4 feature tags: unified identity authentication system, data confirmation and authorization, privacy protection and anti-censorship, and decentralized operation. Therefore, in the eyes of blockchain practitioners, Web 3.0 is actually a new network form evolved based on blockchain thinking.\\n\\nIn the past year, discussions on web3.0 in the blockchain industry have gradually heated up. Of course, it is full of controversy. Some people think that web3.0 is the future of the Internet, and some people think that web3.0 is still far away.\\n\\nSam Altman, president of Y Combinator, an American startup incubator, said that the average risk return of investments made in the 2020s will be much worse than investments made in the 2010s. But web3 may still have a return in 2010, but most venture capital companies will miss it.\\n\\nOn December 2, Elon Musk replied to Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator, an American startup incubator, saying, \\\"Web 3 sounds like bullshit.\\\" On December 4, Elon Musk posted a mockery of Web3 again on social media. Such content, the pictures published this time alluded to the fact that Web3 supporters like to promote Web3, Decentralized Organization (DAO) and other cryptographic concepts to others regardless of occasion. Subsequently, Ethernet Square core developers eric.eth in sassal.eth retweeted tweets indicates Musk, most people do not like the market have been Elon Musk, Web 3 and does not require encryption DeFi Elon.\\n\\nBoca Polkadot manner founder Gavin Wood will this be human interaction on a global scale called \\\"Housinuodeng Time Network\\\" (Post-Snowden Web). Looking to the next 10 or 20 years, Gavin Wood said that the future large-scale multi-user application framework can provide users with \\\"practical\\\" guarantees. When asked to predict Web 3 in ten years’ time, Gavin Wood replied: “This will be a very interesting social experiment. We will see the world’s concern for privacy, self-sovereignty and transparency, and know how the system or service rules work. Very real.\\\"\\n\\nA16z partner Chris Dixon tweeted that the development of emerging technologies cannot be opposed because of the defects in current emerging technologies. Any important technological movement needs to go through many years of time. Well-intentioned criticism can improve the technology. \\\"Disadvantages\\\" are distinguished from \\\"complete restrictions\\\", especially Web 3 and encryption. There are indeed high transaction costs and excessive energy consumption. This is a temporary defect of this emerging technology, but due to different stages of development, we can Think about more solutions, but you cannot regard \\\"temporary defects\\\" as a reason to completely deny emerging technologies.\\n\\nIt is worth mentioning that at the encryption hearing of the U.S. Congress on December 9, Tomicah Tilleman, a16z policy director, said: This is the first time that a congressman has adopted the platform of a committee hearing to emphasize that Web3 is the future of the Internet. This is a historic turning point in the national discussion on decentralized technology. Committee members acknowledged that the Web3 platform has the potential to solve many of their concerns, including remittances and financial inclusion.\\n\\nIn general, web3.0 is receiving more and more attention, and it is also destined to be full of controversy in the future.\",\"timestamp\":1639474382,\"title\":\"Golden Observation | Search volume has soared in the past three months.
