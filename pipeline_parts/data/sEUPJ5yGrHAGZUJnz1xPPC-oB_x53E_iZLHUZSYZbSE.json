"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"and I escape.  They don't know me from Noah.  But they do know you; and how do you come to let me escape?  What has happened to you, Bunny?  That's the crux.  What could have happened after they all. dropped off?\\\"  And for a minute Raffles frowned and smiled like a sensation novelist working out a plot; then the light broke, and transfigured him through his burnt cork.  \\\"I've got it, Bunny!\\\" he exclaimed.  \\\"You took some of the stuff yourself, though of course not nearly so much as they did.\\n\\n\\\"Splendid!\\\" I cried.  \\\"They really were pressing it upon me at the end, and I did say it must be very little.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You dozed off in your turn, but you were naturally the first to come to yourself.  I had flown; so had the gold brick, the jewelled belt, and the silver statuette.  You tried to rouse the others.  You couldn't succeed; nor would you if you did try.  So what did you do? What's the only really innocent thing you could do in the circumstances?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Go for the police,\\\" I suggested dubiously, little relishing the prospect.\\n\\n\\\"There's a telephone installed for the purpose,\\\" said Raffles.  \\\"I should ring them up, if I were you.  Try not to look blue about it, Bunny.  They're quite the nicest fellows in the world, and what you have to tell them is a mere microbe to the camels I've made them swallow without a grain of salt.  It's really the most convincing story one could conceive; but unfortunately there's another point which will take more explaining away.\\\"\\n\\nAnd even Raffles looked grave enough as I nodded.\\n\\n\\\"You mean that they'll find out you rang me up?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They may,\\\" said Raffles.  \\\"I see that I managed to replace the receiver all. right.  But still - they may.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm afraid they will,\\\" said I, uncomfortably.  \\\"I'm very much afraid I gave something of the kind away.  You see, you had not replaced the receiver; it was dangling over you where you lay. This very question came up, and the brutes themselves seemed so quick to see its possibilities that I thought best to take the bull by the horns and own that I had been rung up by somebody. To be absolutely honest, I even went so far as to say I thought it was Raffles!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You didn't, Bunny!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What could I say?  I was obliged to think of somebody, and I saw they were not going to recognize you.  So I put up a yarn about a wager we had made about this very trap of Maguire's.  You see, Raffles, I've never properly told you how I got in, and there's no time now; but the first thing I had said was that I half expected to find you here before me.  That was in case they spotted you at once.  But it made all. that part about the telephone fit in rather well.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should think it did, Bunny,\\\" murmured Raffles, in a tone that added sensibly to my reward.  \\\"I couldn't have done better myself, and you will forgive my saying that you have never in your life done half so well.  Talk about that crack you gave me on the head! You have made it up to me a hundredfold by all. you have done to-night.  But the bother of it is that there's still so much to do, and to hit upon, and so precious little time for thought as well as action.\\\"\\n\\nI took out my watch and showed it to Raffles without a word.  It was three o'clock in the morning, and the latter end of March.  In little more than an hour there would be dim daylight in the streets. Raffles roused himself from a reverie with sudden decision.\\n\\n\\\"There's only one thing for it, Bunny,\\\" said he.  \\\"We must trust each other and divide the labor.  You ring up the police,(and leave the rest to me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You haven't hit upon any reason for the sort of burglar they think you were, ringing up the kind of man they know I am?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not yet, Bunny, but I shall.  It may not be wanted for a day or so, and after all. it isn't for you to give the explanation.  It would be highly suspicious if you did.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So it would,\\\" I agreed.\\n\\n\\\"Then will you trust me to hit on something - if possible before morning - in any case by the time it s wanted?  I won't fail you, Bunny.  You must see how I can never, never fail you after to-night!\\\"\\n\\nThat settled it.  I gripped his hand without another word, and remained on guard over the three sleepers while Raffles stole upstairs.  I have since learned that there were servants at the top of the house, and in the basement a man, who actually heard some of our proceedings!  But he was mercifully too accustomed to nocturnal orgies, and those of a far more uproarious character, to appear unless summoned to the scene.  I believe he heard Raffles leave.  But no secret was made of his exit: he let himself out and told me afterward that the first person he encountered in the street was the constable on the beat.  Raffles wished him good-morning, as well he might; for he had been upstairs to wash his face and hands; and in the prize-fighter's great hat and fur coat he might have marched round Scotland Yard itself, in spite of his having the gold brick from Sacramento in one pocket, the silver statuette of Maguire in the other, and round his waist the jewelled belt presented to that worthy by the State of Nevada.\\n\\nMy immediate part was a little hard after the excitement of those small hours.  I will only say that we had agreed that it would be wisest for me to lie like a log among the rest for half an hour, before staggering to my feet and rousing house and police; and that in that half-hour Barney Maguire crashed to the floor, without waking either himself or his companions, though not without bringing my beating heart into the very roof of my mouth.\\n\\nIt was daybreak when I gave the alarm with bell and telephone.  In a few minutes we had the house congested with dishevelled domestics, irascible doctors, and arbitrary minions of the law.  If I told my story once, I told it a dozen times, and all. on an empty stomach. But it was certainly a most plausible and consistent tale, even without that confirmation which none of the other victims was as yet sufficiently recovered to supply. And in the end I was permitted to retire from the scene until required to give further information, or to identify the prisoner whom the good police confidently expected to make before the day was out.\\n\\nI drove straight to the flat.  The porter flew to help me out of my hansom.  His face alarmed me more than any I had left in Half-moon Street.  It alone might have spelled my ruin.\\n\\n\\\"Your flat's been entered in the night, sir,\\\" he cried.  \\\"The thieves have taken everything they could lay hands on.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thieves in my flat!\\\" I ejaculated aghast.  There were one or two incriminating possessions up there, as well as at the Albany.\\n\\n\\\"The door's been forced with a jimmy,\\\" said the porter.  \\\"It was the milkman who found it out.  There's a constable up there now.\\\"\\n\\nA constable poking about in my flat of all. others!  I rushed upstairs without waiting for the lift.  The invader was moistening his pencil between laborious notes in a fat pocketbook; he had penetrated no further than the forced door.  I dashed past him in a fever.  I kept my trophies in a wardrobe drawer specially fitted with a Bramah lock.  The lock was broken - the drawer void.\\n\\n\\\"Something valuable, sir?\\\" inquired the intrusive constable at my heels.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, indeed - some old family silver,\\\" I answered.  It was quite true.  But the family was not mine.\\n\\nAnd not till then did the truth flash across my mind.  Nothing else of value had been taken.  But there was a meaningless litter in all. the rooms.  I turned to the porter, who had followed me up from the street; it was his wife who looked after the flat.\\n\\n\\\"Get rid of this idiot as quick as you can,\\\" I whispered.  \\\"I'm going straight to Scotland Yard myself.  Let your wife tidy the place while I'm gone, and have the lock mended before she leaves. I'm going as I am, this minute!\\\"\\n\\nAnd go I did, in the first hansom I could find - but not straight to Scotland Yard.  I stopped the cab in Picadilly on the way.\\n\\nOld Raffles opened his own door to me.  I cannot remember finding him fresher, more immaculate, more delightful to behold in every way.  Could I paint a picture of Raffles with something other than my pen, it would be as I saw him that bright March morning, at his open door in the Albany, a trim, slim figure in matutinal gray, cool and gay and breezy as incarnate spring.\\n\\n\\\"What on earth did you do it for?\\\" I asked within.\\n\\n\\\"It was the only solution,\\\" he answered, handing me the cigarettes. \\\"I saw it the moment I got outside.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't see it yet.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why should a burglar call an innocent gentleman away from home?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's what we couldn't make out.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I tell you I got it directly I had left you.  He called you away in order to burgle you too, of course!\\\"\\n\\nAnd Raffles stood smiling upon me in all. his incomparable radiance and audacity.\\n\\n\\\"But why me?\\\" I asked.  \\\"Why on earth should he burgle me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My dear Bunny, we must leave something to the imagination of the police.  But we will assist them to a fact or two in due season. It was the dead of night when Maguire first took us to his house; it was at the Imperial Boxing Club we met him; and you meet queer fish at the Imperial Boxing Club.  You may remember that he telephoned to his man to prepare supper for us, and that you and he discussed telephones and treasure as we marched through the midnight streets.  He was certainly bucking about his trophies, and for the sake of the argument you will be good enough to admit that you probably bucked about yours.  What happens?  You are overheard; you are followed; you are worked into the same scheme, and robbed on the same night.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you really think this will meet the case?\\\"   \\\"I am quite certain of it, Bunny, so far as it rests wit us to meet the case at all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then give me another cigarette, my dear fellow, and let me push on to Scotland Yard.\\\"\\n\\nRaffles held up both hands in admiring horror.  \\\"Scotland Yard!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To give a false description of what you took from that drawer in my wardrobe.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1637495312,\"title\":\"It's easy enough for me,\\\" he went on.  \\\"I am a common house-breaker\"},\"digest\":\"gmPHeDvlHW7tiQAtfjh-vpORZN_TkRXzEVduJ8uLV1o\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD2dD0Fd14351C19d159B581881AE68fAD5390A5a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"v8nGFyqu7HoLbbgXrJFMaX9mS9qVsu4Dsscw8Doi2IQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JEZ09CjWDiUNB9ezbG4UaYjXJvkNAU1za1eUkSbtV-4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"vQhrRKmCo8U42VmOuQynj4Uvi4KVcYovVzUSasPOM_0_CNkQ8bXP-K9OFmoR_Xnmc4PPbunyPZwVE-XAX_4FFA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9d00d136b3cdca5336b42c9d9e60a2816c75edf2f44c2b494059c00cbfd1f7133f399aa903a6e1845acc278283d425f7500583c7e600e2cad7ff358facff17db1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"v8nGFyqu7HoLbbgXrJFMaX9mS9qVsu4Dsscw8Doi2IQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"JEZ09CjWDiUNB9ezbG4UaYjXJvkNAU1za1eUkSbtV-4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"gmPHeDvlHW7tiQAtfjh-vpORZN_TkRXzEVduJ8uLV1o\"}"
