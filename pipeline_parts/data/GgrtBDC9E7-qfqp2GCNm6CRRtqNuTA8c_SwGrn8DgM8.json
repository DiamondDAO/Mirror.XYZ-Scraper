Take breaks between work!\\n\\n## Quote of the Day:\\n\\n> *‚ÄúWorrying doesn‚Äôt take away tomorrow‚Äôs troubles, it tales away today‚Äòs peace.‚Äù - Unknown*\\n\\n## 07:35\\n\\nToday I woke up at 7:35 and I carried out my daily routine. This consists of waking up and praying Fajr. Afterwards, I then read Surah Yasin, which helps me start the day with positive and in the name of the Lord, of my religion. This normally takes 20 minutes because I have to ‚Äúdefrost‚Äù and carry out wudhu (ablutions). Afterwards, I don‚Äôt make my bed but rather undo it! This is because my bed needs to breathe!\\n\\nThat‚Äôs my morning routine done. I‚Äôm sleeping downstairs because my brother invaded and conquered my normal quarters after I left for university. Sigh, but it is what it is! But on the plus side, I‚Äôm closer to the kitchen and the lounge!\\n\\nSo I prepared scrambled eggs and a slice of bread, coated with olive margarine, fried on my favourite frying pan. Don‚Äôt ask me why I‚Äôve got a favourite kitchen item but that‚Äôs me! Jumped onto the engulfing sofa, lift my feet and switched on some good old Grand Tour. The trio does make my mornings. But I should be starting to watch the news since a LOT goes on during the world and I should make an active contribution to understanding worldly matters.\\n\\nMum came downstairs and she puts the kettle on and I make tea for myself and her. Two sugars and a drop of milk for me, mum prefers to have a drop of milk. I just don‚Äôt get how you can have tea on its own! Some people just have an Americano (black coffee) with no sugar, literally so bitter and I don‚Äôt know how people like it! üò≠\\n\\nAfter finishing the show, it‚Äôs 9:30 and I jump onto the laptop to finish my university assignment which is taking me two weeks to complete. My last assignment took my three weeks to complete and I‚Äôm struggling to understand how people do their assignments last minute! Some people do have willpower I‚Äôm telling you! Let‚Äôs see how much I can complete, keep an eye out for an update.\\n\\n## 13:07\\n\\nHuge update! We decided to head to the city centre for a family outing since everyone would be going back to work, school or university after the holidays. We checked out many places including the Library and the shopping centre. It‚Äôs been great fun to get out of the house and some fresh air. We‚Äôve had food, a chicken and chips family bucket that was enough to feed all of us. The chicken was hot and tasted AMAZING.\\n\\nNow we‚Äôre back home and in time for the sunset prayers and I wanted to watch the Chelsea game against Liverpool but my dust allergies were simply too much for me to handle. Ever since I came back home, my dust allergy has been killing me - well not literally - more so itchy red eyes and a severely blocked nose. Taking loratadine should help since it‚Äôs an antihistamine. Basically, it‚Äôs a medicine that stops the symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as a runny nose. But now I‚Äôm going to have a cup of tea and will be aiming to finish my report. I‚Äôve got a chemistry quiz in a couple of weeks when I get back. Let‚Äôs hope I get it done!\\n\\n## 19:30\\n\\nWell, now I‚Äôve almost completed a chunk of my assignment. The ‚Äúmain‚Äù aspect of my assignment is still in the blue and I guess I‚Äôm going to have to wait until I get back to university to speak with my friends and my professor about this. It‚Äôs going to be 11 pm group calls with my friends to get this over and done with! I will now be completing revision questions for my chemistry quiz, to give me a sense of satisfaction for my day!\\n\\n## 22:24\\n\\nI‚Äôm in bed now after praying my night prayers. I had a cheeky pot of noodles and strawberry milkshake just to replenish my hunger. I didn‚Äôt manage to finish the topic but I did organise the module on Notion which is good since I was meant to do that. I did realise that I have a lot to do and the only I can complete it is by having a timetable sorted. I‚Äôll sort it out when I get back.\\n\\nFor now, I‚Äôll be dozing off and letting my body relax after a long day of walking, exploring and working.\\n\\n**Thank you for reading! üòÅ**\\n\\n***Honestly, my life is pretty ordinary and not much happens, but that doesn‚Äôt matter. The reason why I‚Äôve started journaling is to help me clear my mind and understand my thoughts. As for myself, I do understand when a person has endless thoughts and is a deep thinker. Journalling has helped me feel happier, healthier and more human. That‚Äôs why you should do it too!***\\n\\n***Subscribe to me on Vocal and follow my TikTok to be updated on my journey!***\\n\\n***Tiktok: @baxterpage***\",\"timestamp\":1641249047,\"title\":\"Journal Day #2\"},\"digest\":\"8JDiPkE_mn-ca8Zz3gipLdDWpB0nuVdDBdbT-ofy2uw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5982e1d19F1e3712f3B2ee6A4f19649cc2414E6B\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"5AgyRs7936yjz08n9eAq3TUHhNpttflkuHCeUbe7CLQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"I4q5VRVTru-bU9ldkowi9yhNJolrjgCVKQtRgdO_T-Y\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"-0f6KDdTewUVElVyodjHdkmz86PQ_GvfTA-A7WvD3q-Lkvv7X42v_FUwMFwEp3jQPLRR3F41EryECohnsm8XPw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd1f1f43dba96ef936bfb56f24911eb28f5c21080faa9873332666cd67ec3969f67dc95e72118f0ea62209b28e47d37fa5c1fcd76a84f09229f678eca3a4fa67a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"5AgyRs7936yjz08n9eAq3TUHhNpttflkuHCeUbe7CLQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"I4q5VRVTru-bU9ldkowi9yhNJolrjgCVKQtRgdO_T-Y\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"8JDiPkE_mn-ca8Zz3gipLdDWpB0nuVdDBdbT-ofy2uw\"}"
