"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"We're at the beginning of a new media culture—with new dominant players emerging in the form of crypto-native brands (e.g. BAYC). The establishment brands will try to leverage their existing influence (incl. money) and try to stay relevant.\\n\\nWe will likely see more and more of these traditional brands entering our space. Nothing wrong with that per se: building self-governed communities, using blockchain technology or even participating in the growing significance of online experience and existence.\\n\\nBut crypto-curious companies need to recognize and internalize the new rules and habits, which define this new paradigm, to be successful. For an example, attention and participation are redefined to —in lack of a better world—\\\"Prosumowners\\\".\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/beyondm3ta/status/1483725396474576897\\n\\nSome are honestly embracing our culture and our contribution-first attitude—some not so. There will be a lot of cash grabs in the future. But: Those non-crypto-native brands which have \\\"skin in the game\\\" win. The roadmap is not just \\\"gm\\\", a fancy PFP and then an NFT drop.\\n\\nThat might be finally lucrative—but not infinitely reproducible. For long-term success and to get a piece of the scarce resource of \\\"attention\\\", it is inevitable to engage with and be part of the community and the conversations within. Crypto-native brands have that in their DNA.\",\"timestamp\":1642762437,\"title\":\"On crypto-curious brands\"},\"digest\":\"RDeLrl57i96T_hv_404wcodvsQbF0MyD4evOzVqme1w\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x71f2106e53cE0D5F4169B231DDc5cffEB0150e10\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"VIiXv-RYY0ZkXST1EE1x7FqmZuL61sSn2hkoQHsNgYM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"A3k32iBmeY1X1zeEqKTc_jRgG7XrWahzaW7wKIdWqRY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"kudkwWy-IflYcDY-BDJvqRXGZ0mZRvfAOqkXjcOtYudJQGXckvVnm5iPdMDz3gMCtU2J7LOCPQvl3tnE3GhZKA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x02c4ade29ede0a8b0ef0ff52cf82c509ae28eab8d9ee61616d652e637a8789d3078c12ef05f9a7b28569c4fdd938bec59b61fc6d732f01f61580a929737452211b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"VIiXv-RYY0ZkXST1EE1x7FqmZuL61sSn2hkoQHsNgYM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"A3k32iBmeY1X1zeEqKTc_jRgG7XrWahzaW7wKIdWqRY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"RDeLrl57i96T_hv_404wcodvsQbF0MyD4evOzVqme1w\"}"
