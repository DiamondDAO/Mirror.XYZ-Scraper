"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Begin by understanding that everything is malleable.\\n\\nThe process of growth is necessarily transformational: every flower starts with a seed, every dragonfly metamorphoses from a baby nymph.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nAccept nature as absolute. It is allegorical and its fundamental rules are programmed into the range of human conditions and existence.\\n\\nA person who tries to out-think nature is bound for great suffering as he is trying to defy the source of his own thinking.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nUnderstand that nature is not prescriptive. It does not seek to teach or inspire. Its existence is pure and undisturbed. The growth of nature is independent of its purpose.\\n\\nThe human mind has been trained to deduce motivations from patterns. It prefers narratives because predictability is an easier circumstance for survival.\\n\\nWhere such narratives are violated, the mind resists.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nTo experience harmony is to accept that all realities are malleable. While changes bring about losses, they are a way of life and one should look forward to them.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nThus, know that one has complete and total control of how they think and feel, as all thinking is intentional which gives rise to feelings, which are reactive.\\n\\nBelieve in the power of will.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nUnderstand that experiences are individual realities, which obey the same rules of nature: neutral, malleable and forever changing.\\n\\nAccept nothing as given.\\n\\nHave no expectations for how things were and will be. The single source of truth comes from the present moment. To think about it is to dwell on the past.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nRemain curious and simple.\\n\\nFreedom and clarity come from internalizing the laws of change.\",\"timestamp\":1639267771,\"title\":\"CHANGE\"},\"digest\":\"Aq8LZ79ftVGHPWnoPtsEZ8HistoOBK0daACoL7GnRfQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x1339e24bbD37614A0A5669dC7e3E97D9E351Ab76\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"io0bR3Nqsp1aYJbXS7xMtPWcLZ2HbSH1XdEbtDP04p8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"IWjZKPFHQPvDNREQujHe19Vkrsi2X95odxPq4DwFI6Q\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ghiaol4h52KSNPchYEYFFAtHW4U5qrUvQMTRFCKnCdBKlVFaX6R_oFFoZa1TFVBoL7bFkh01U79WFWRDdL_BVw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa6c5c847ccd94d8d2c0643292008408226f52fe6896f2a132c52a27d4c3133d505c66ce88da2abee40e1ad8c01a8c3e99ab43c0c7c31f4be0cd6fac9facdfcc21b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"io0bR3Nqsp1aYJbXS7xMtPWcLZ2HbSH1XdEbtDP04p8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"IWjZKPFHQPvDNREQujHe19Vkrsi2X95odxPq4DwFI6Q\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"1KVHYs-XKhiYYRQ5jn3AvoDWFGBvPQKKadwKMqVfuCY\"}"
