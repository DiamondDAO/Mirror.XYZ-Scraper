"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"This is our first guest post from a $HASH historian from the DAO. These folks have some deep insights about $HASH hunting, uncovering historic moments, and leveraging tools to realize their archeological ambitions. \\n\\nExcited to have BulletEyeDk share his tips around finding your txn to mint!\\\" - David Sun\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nI've been in love with the [ProofOfBeauty](https://www.pob.studio/) project since the Genesis S0 season, and minted my first POB NFT almost 6 months ago.\\n\\nI have spent countless hours scouting various blockchain explorers, using distinct website tools, building scraping scripts, and using SQL hunting for unique txn to mint.\\n\\nSince i joined the [Historians DAO](https://hash.pob.studio/historians) a few members of the POB discord have asked me for help/assistance to find unique txn to mint.\\n\\nWith this blog i will try to explain how to get started looking for something cool to mint.\\n\\n### How to start searching\\n\\nThe most basic search you can start with is searching ERC-20 projects and look up the contract creation of a project.\\n\\nAs an example im going to look up Uniswap on [Coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/), browsing Uniswap you're going to hover the \\\"explorers\\\" menu. Select \\\"etherscan.io\\\" and then [click](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984) on this.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f27bc744-309b-4b63-8b5e-2fc156d0cab2.png?height=458&width=928)\\n\\nYou're now presented with an overview of Uniswap, on this page you need to go to the profile summary on the right upper side of the page, here you need to [click](0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984) on the \\\"contract\\\" as highlighted in the image below.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c7a91bdc-aafe-45ef-8df7-83e966be5fd1.png?height=514&width=790)\\n\\nDoing that will open up the page for the Uniswap contract, on this page you're going to [click](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4b37d2f343608457ca3322accdab2811c707acf3eb07a40dd8d9567093ea5b82) on the \\\"txn 0x4b37....\\\" as highlighted on the image above.\\n\\nYou're now presented with a page transaction details for the Uniswap contract creation, the transaction $HASH \\\"0x4b37d2f343608457ca3322accdab2811c707acf3eb07a40dd8d9567093ea5b82\\\" is the one you're looking for, as this was the transaction used for deploying the contract of Uniswap Protocol: UNI token.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eb92f61c-bf38-40bb-adb6-c2cb637eb69f.png?height=616&width=1390)\\n\\nNow copy the transaction $HASH and paste it onto ProofOfBeauty search bar.\\n\\nhttps://hash.pob.studio/\\n\\nOnce you do that, you will notice, that this already has been minted in Genesis S0 as mint number #73\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9788604f-0496-4826-a89f-b6a54097854d.png?height=784&width=490)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cd75a61d-7a33-41a1-83fc-05aeac371716.png?height=578&width=474)\\n\\nAs you can see on the mint information, the owner has described this as \\\"UNI creation tx\\\".\\n\\nSeeing a green \\\"Verified\\\" tick mark next to a mint, indicates that this mint has been verified by the Historian DAO that it represents whats is written in the description.\\n\\n### Searching further using explorers\\n\\nAnother approach for some unique mints, could be to look up other known projects in the NFT space.\\n\\nThe Bored Ape Yacht Club: BAYC Token has seen much interest, so let's dive a bit into that.\\n\\nFrom another POB mint we know this [txn](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x22199329b0aa1aa68902a78e3b32ca327c872fab166c7a2838273de6ad383eba) is the creation of the contract in that particular project\\n\\nIf you follow that link, you will get to the transaction details page on etherscan.io, see below image\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dd536fba-129b-4e33-9786-e392a3c50945.png?height=1784&width=1568)\\n\\nFirst you click the [txn contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d)\\n\\nThen click the tracker: [BoredApeYachtClub (BAYC)](https://etherscan.io/token/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d)\\n\\nYou're now presented with the Token page for the BoredApeYachtClub, for the example please go click [last](javascript:move('generic-tokentxns2?contractAddress=0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d&mode=&sid=225efbdec00bb63cfa89aa7bc8296cac&m=normal&p=1349'))\\n\\nDoing this you're viewing the first transactions.\\n\\nIt seems looking at the txn $HASH and method compared to the TokenID most right, that a lot of \\\"Apes\\\" has been reserved in the exact same txn.\\n\\nLet's go back a page, click [previous](javascript:move('generic-tokentxns2?contractAddress=0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d&mode=&sid=225efbdec00bb63cfa89aa7bc8296cac&m=normal&p=1348')) once\\n\\nYou should now be at the exact same page af the bottom of the above image.\\n\\nNow click the [txn](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8b119c0955a2e4402e6c11b820e84fa700b5e4d36b58e898ef8a4f0668a2f062) highlighted in the image\\n\\nDoing that, you should now see the same page as the image shows below:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1f9d870f-12a3-4264-8716-b35841a53b20.png?height=752&width=1388)\\n\\nSo it seems that the txn 0x8b119c0955a2e4402e6c11b820e84fa700b5e4d36b58e898ef8a4f0668a2f062 was used for minting 2 Bored Ape Yacht Club Apes, with ID 31 and 32.\\n\\nUsing nftexp.io it's possible to look up Bored Apes Yacht Club by token ID.\\n\\nThose minted in the txn in the example look like this:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/64519f1c-04c3-4456-ad36-157df8e64912.png?height=500&width=1070)\\n\\nNow go ahead and look up the txn at [ProofOfBeauty](https://hash2.pob.studio/art/0x8b119c0955a2e4402e6c11b820e84fa700b5e4d36b58e898ef8a4f0668a2f062)\\n\\nAt the time of writing this blog, this $HASH is not minted yet.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f489f6d5-6fd1-481b-a162-f6e2567d5915.png?height=1226&width=490)\\n\\n\\n\\n### How to search further\\n\\nOne of the first website tools i used to search for random unique txn was this [site](https://pob.kikoweb.ch/)\\n\\nIt seems the site isn't updated for displaying S1: SAGA previews, but none the less, it's still possible to use.\\n\\nIf you try to make a search with **start block: 430250**\\n**Num Blocks: 100** and then hit scan, you will get the following result:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f5bd9ce9-266e-4248-a551-b64173829c9b.png?height=2390&width=1295)\\n\\nWhat you see displayed here is the number of transactions within the 100 blocks you wanted to search.\\n\\nTo hunt down unique and beautiful pieces, there is also a manuel process, you can take each txn and paste it onto the searhbar at ProofOfBeauty, to check how it looks visually and also get to know if it's already minted by someone else.\\n\\nA significant parameter is the number of leading zeros in the transaction $HASH\\n\\nIn S1: SAGA a $HASH without any leading zero's will have 2 circles, for each leading zero an extra circle are added.\\n\\nThe transaction with the most leading zero's as of today is this very nice [piece](https://hash.pob.studio/art/0x00000000bd1b55188f96ab2cedf07f563e2486b3b11548d50a49de4e5bdb0dcd), which have amazing 8 leading zero's, it was minted in S0: Genesis season as number 894.\\n\\nIf you dive deep into the above image, you will see this txn was also found using the website tool.\\n\\nA total of 33 transactions with 7 leading zero's has until now ever been recorded on the ethereum blockchain, all those except one was minted in the S0: Genesis season.\\n\\nThe S1: Saga mint with 7 leading zero's is viewable on ProofOfBeauty [here](https://hash.pob.studio/art/0x0000000a54f29044d7eadab9b7a683ec3fcebc42fc52eecd0ed455a09e97faae)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/80f34747-264b-496e-b17f-ae2c0177b2f5.png?height=783&width=489)\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/82297bf3-81a1-4e65-926f-9b7bb2f09a21.png?height=618&width=468)\\n\\nActually there is a lot of parameters that generates how the ProofOfBeauty NFT's end up visually, you might want to dive a bit into that in this blog posted earlier this year, this digs into how the [SAGA](https://pob.mirror.xyz/Ep7nUgI52SGreSLE2-wVEEDZ8wF3wEOkaZDMURl__VU) algorithm works\\n\\n\\n### Advanced search using SQL\\n\\nSearching for a specific number of leading zero's or other parameters, i would recommend using SQL, which is a bit more complicated\\n\\nTo search the ethereum blockchain i recommend using Google Cloud BigQuery, it's free of charge for the first 1TB of data per month you use.\\n\\nUse this [link](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=bigquery-public-data&page=dataset&d=ethereum_blockchain&p=bigquery-public-data&redirect_from_classic=true&ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1sbigquery-public-data!2sethereum_blockchain) to get to the project page inside Google Cloud BigQuery platform.\\n\\nStarting out on the platform you will need to navigate to \\\"crypto_ethereum\\\" as the dataset you will be searching.\\n\\nThe open up the tree structure by selecting \\\"transactions\\\", this will show you which exact variables that are searchable using the dataset.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6612ebad-df4b-4250-a6c0-842f3f818004.png?height=918&width=1314)\\n\\nIf you click details shown in the upper middle of the screen you will see the statistics of the dataset\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7fcf298b-be0a-44ec-a99a-9e941d2c7631.png?height=532&width=453)\\n\\nAs of writing this blog post, the data seems to be approx. 45 minutes behind actual time, but updated continuosly.\\n\\nUsing SQL to extract data requires some knowledge, i really can't get into teaching SQL in this blog post, but as an example i will show you how to search for the top 10 most used ERC-721 contracts as of 20. july 2021.\\n\\nUse the query below, and you will get a result like this: (i added tracker name)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b269821e-d840-4132-80a1-f59de9c014ce.png?height=648&width=1008)\\n\\nThe above contracts could be a starting point for finding unique txn within these projects.\\n\\n### Search for historic transactions\\n\\nFor some this task is just straightforward, but for many it may be hard, where to start. It's all about knowning the history of ethereum.\\n\\nA good start i would say could be to look at english wiki page for [ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum)\\n\\nWithin this page you will find this table:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c16f1743-7fa1-4260-a1b3-53dd44208a4b.png?height=374&width=355)\\n\\nAs you see on the above image, ethereum had some protocol upgrades at specific block numbers.\\n\\nI have highlighted the Berlin upgrade which was released 15. april 2021 at block number 12244000.\\n\\nNow please go look up that blocknumber in this [explorer](https://blockchair.com/ethereum/transactions?s=id(asc)&q=block_id(12244000)#f=hash,block_id,failed,time,sender,recipient,internal_value,index)\\n\\nViewing that page shows you the transactions in that block listed cronological, now go ahead and click on the first transaction [hash](https://blockchair.com/ethereum/transaction/0xac503dd98281d4d52c2043e297a6e684d175339a7ebf831605fe593f01ce82c3)\\n\\nThis transaction is the first txn in the block published as being the first block after the Berlin upgrade.\\n\\nYou might want to go look that transaction up on [ProofOfBeauty](https://hash.pob.studio/art/0xac503dd98281d4d52c2043e297a6e684d175339a7ebf831605fe593f01ce82c3) \\n\\nAfter you have connected your wallet, you could most probably see \\\"Mint now\\\". If you see exact text phrase, this transaction is still available to mint.\\n\\nIf you see \\\"Opensea\\\" mentioned instead, this transaction has already been minted by someone else.\\n\\n### Looking up historic NFT mints/sales\\n\\nThis is all about knowing your stuff about the NFT space, im still not too deep into that area, but as a part of the [Historians DAO](https://hash.pob.studio/historians) i have already stumpled upon some request to verify mints that represents transactions that includes minting of famous NFT art pieces and such.\\n\\nSo i guess google would be your best assistant here, dig into what is valuable for people into the NFT space.\\n\\nOnce you stumple upon a project, you need to dig into this a bit further. At first is this deployed on ethereum blockchain or some other, this is crucial to check.\\n\\nAs an example let's explore an NFT called \\\"Fade\\\" by Pak, look up this [page](https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2021/natively-digital-a-curated-nft-sale-2/to-be-announced)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/79910d5e-1ab8-441d-b548-bd6212b5d090.png?height=924&width=1050)\\n\\nWe see that this NFT has the smart contract address: [0x62f5418d9edbc13b7e07a15e095d7228cd9386c5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x62f5418d9edbc13b7e07a15e095d7228cd9386c5)\\n\\nClick the address of the contract to look it up\\n\\nInvestigating the page we see the following information at tracker: Fade (FADE)\\n\\nAt the bottom of the page you will see the transaction mentioned as being used in the creation of the contract.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/84e63559-e59e-4af8-bf05-2fa5afb90b0f.png?height=556&width=1382)\\n\\nClick on [txn 0x9662000....](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x96620001c4bbeb3c32881e3cd011023d2fea5e87653a3f2856b562a16eab9489)\\n\\nDoing so, will take you to the transaction details, on this page you will see that this txn was used to mint Fade ERC-721 token with ID: 1\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b29bb0ae-8fa0-4971-97b1-956e2bed8cc0.png?height=502&width=1387)\\n\\nNow use the txn $HASH on [ProofOfBeauty](https://hash.pob.studio/art/0x96620001c4bbeb3c32881e3cd011023d2fea5e87653a3f2856b562a16eab9489)\\n\\nYou will see that this exact $HASH is already minted.\\n\\n\\n\\nThanks for taking your time to read this pretty long blog post.\\n\\nIf you're still not to clear about what to do to find some unique and maybe also beautiful NFT's to mint, you're more than welcome to peak around on this website i made for showcasing some of my $HASH finds for ProofOfBeauty.\\n\\nMost of the stuff on the website is free to take at whatever price you want, a few pieces have a set price.\\n\\nPlease note that buying anything from the [shop](www.pobnfts.com) only gives you the $HASH that you need to use for minting the NFT it self.\",\"timestamp\":1627063083,\"title\":\"Finding a unique txn to mint as $HASH\",\"publication\":\"pob\"},\"digest\":\"PrwisS74TAioK3OkV3WKDiMEnEqGslE8hZV7bYwi_QQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xb99f063aaCbbE0602A41Be67B26648506ef45600\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MeyxfclWsR0hrNHhCy4DD7OafF9I7y1ko-e6_EXXCp4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"V0TCOEUf8j-SWrAy6xWqkMRmVRminItT3R9gbMbl3Qs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"FKNiSD0nmfiQNYYGWdoKG8Dk2PxNe3NDHtDnsJ-2tUZ_gqLC0u1Gx8zpu2Sf1MqtcS8JP_4tTlxAeG_d90azIg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x3bd91e9fcfb4183f2957182b73d18d3bccab9c2a74ba93076de3471cfcc01d9628b7ae1be8fded99704377f656e55aff9c0af42aad84f2fb163ca12ea9ed09441c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on pob.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MeyxfclWsR0hrNHhCy4DD7OafF9I7y1ko-e6_EXXCp4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"V0TCOEUf8j-SWrAy6xWqkMRmVRminItT3R9gbMbl3Qs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"WQAttPx_rDU2jCKwj66YHx_HMEpAWU2vXxR81PRiK0g\"}"
