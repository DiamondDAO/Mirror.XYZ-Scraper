We recommend using MetaMask\\n\\n* [Dlick here to download the MetMask application](https://metamask.io/download/) for your desktop or mobile device \\n* For a [detailed walkthrough click here](https://mirror.xyz/nftwithme.eth/Y0V3Q2z1NvNV7ghWuNvSuqtpCPnKHv-ezDONPGkO4jI).\\n\\n## Step 2: Deposit ETH into your wallet\\n\\n*If you already have ETH in your crypto wallet, skip to Step 3*\\n\\nTo mint the NFT you will need [ETH (Ethereum)](https://ethereum.org/en/get-eth/). You can buy ETH from within MetaMask, or set up an exchange account with a company to buy and trade ETH.\\n\\nWhile purchasing ETH from within MetaMask allows you to stay within the application (Option A), we recommend setting up an exchange account to be able to easily purchase, trade and transfer ETH and other cryptos from an established exchange (Option B).\\n\\n### Option A: To buy ETH from within MetaMask\\n\\nSelect the buy or add funds button in you MetaMask to buy ETH and have it deposited into your wallet from one of the provided options.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tNaDo6lj1tyIvPDEPbZPp.jpg?height=1341&width=1613)\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n* You will be charged a “gas fee” to transfer the ETH into your wallet. Gas fees apply to all transaction processed on the Ethereum network, learn more about them here.\\n* Most service providers that you can buy ETH from will require a form of identity verification to comply with government regulations.\\n\\n### Option B: To buy ETH by creating an exchange account\\n\\n**B.1 - Setup an exchange account**\\n\\nYou can transfer ETH that you buy from a supported exchange into your MetaMask. We recommend using [coinbase.com](https://coinbase.com) as one of the easier to use options for US residents, and [binance.com](https://binance.com) for non-US residents.\\n\\nYou can use the the country based search engine to view exchange options and [learn more here.](https://ethereum.org/en/get-eth/)\\n\\n![Source: https://ethereum.org/en/get-eth/ updated as of Jan. 7th, 2022](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8a9D7O5yEjnt7WlJckuc2.png?height=1840&width=654)\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n* You cannot transfer ETH to your MetaMask (or other decentralized wallet) from all exchanges. For example Venmo, CashApp, and Robinhood all do not currently allow you to transfer ETH from your account to another wallet.\\n* Most exchanges will require a form of identity verification to comply with government regulations. While some offer automatic identity verification, this process can take sometime.\\n* Some exchanges do not allow for newly added funds to be withdrawn right away, make sure to set up your account in advance of you needing the funds.\\n\\n**B.2 Transfer the ETH from your exchange account into your wallet**\\n\\nAfter you have purchased ETH within your exchange account, you will need to transfer it to you wallet. To do so follow these general steps:\\n\\n1. **Select the withdraw or transfer** option from within your exchange account\\n2. **Select ETH** as the currency you want to transfer. If it has an option, make sure that it is the ERC20 one.\\n3. **Input your destination ETH wallet address**.
