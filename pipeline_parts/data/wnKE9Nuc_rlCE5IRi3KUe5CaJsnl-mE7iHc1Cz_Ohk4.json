"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"It is another sort of safe of which you must break the lock, Frank; another treasure you must steal. Do you not understand me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not in the least.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is Tom,\\\" said Gertrude. \\\"He is always wandering about the place now like a ghost. Let us go back to the gate.\\\" Then Frank turned. \\\"You heard, I suppose, of that dreadful affair about the policeman.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There was a row, I was told.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did you feel that the family were disgraced?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not in the least. He had to pay five shillings -- hadn't he -- for telling a policeman to go about his business?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He was -- locked up,\\\" said Gertrude, solemnly.\\n\\n\\\"It's just the same. Nobody thinks anything about that kind of thing. Now, what is it I have got to do? We had better turn back again as soon as we can, because I must go up to the house before I go.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You will?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certainly. I will not leave it to your father to say that I came skulking about the place, and was ashamed to show my face. That would not be the way to make him give you your money.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am sure he'd give it -- if we were once married.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If we were married without having it assured beforehand we should look very blue if things went wrong afterwards.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I asked you whether you had courage.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Courage enough, I think, when my body is concerned; but I am an awful coward in regard to money. I wouldn't mind hashed mutton and baked potatoes for myself, but I shouldn't like to see you eating them, dearest, after all the luxuries to which you have been accustomed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should think nothing of it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did you ever try? I never came absolutely to hashed mutton, but I've known how very uncomfortable it is not to be able to pay for the hot joints. I'm willing to own honestly that married life without an income would not have attractions for me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But if it was sure to come?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, then indeed -- with you! I have just said how nice it would be.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have you ever been at Ostend?\\\" she asked, suddenly.\\n\\n\\\"Ostend. Oh, yes. There was a man there who used to cheat horribly at ecarte. He did me out of nearly a hundred pounds one night.\\\" \\\"But there's a clergyman there, I'm told.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't think this man was in orders. But he might have been. Parsons come out in so many shapes! This man called himself a count. It was seven years ago.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am speaking of today.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've not been there since.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Would you like to go there -- with me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It isn't a nice sort of place, I should say, for a honeymoon. But you shall choose. When we are married you shall go where you like.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To be married!\\\" she exclaimed.\\n\\n\\\"Married at Ostend! Would your mother like that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mother! Oh, dear!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll be shot if I know what you're after, Gertrude. If you've got anything to say you'd better speak out. I want to go up to the house now.\\\"\\n\\nThey had now taken one or two turns between the lodge and a point in the road from which the house could be observed, and at which Tom could still be seen wandering about, thinking no doubt of Ayala. Here Frank stopped as though determined not to turn to the lodge again. It was wonderful to Gertrude that he should not have understood what she had already said. When he talked of her mother going with them to the Ostend marriage she was almost beside herself. This lover of hers was a man of the world and must have heard of elopements. But now had come a time in which she must be plain, unless she made up her mind to abandon her plan altogether. \\\"Frank,\\\" she said, \\\"if you were to run away with me, then we could be married at Ostend.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Run away with you!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It wouldn't be the first time that such a thing has been done.\\\" \\\"The commonest thing in the world, my dear, when a girl has got her money in her own hands. Nothing I should like so much.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Money! It's always money. It's nothing but the money, I believe.\\\" \\\"That's unkind, Gertrude.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ain't you unkind? You won't do anything I ask.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My darling, that hashed mutton and those baked potatoes are too clear before my eyes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You think of nothing, I believe, but your dinner.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think, unfortunately, of a great many other things. Hashed mutton is simply symbolical. Under the head of hashed mutton I include poor lodgings, growlers when we get ourselves asked to eat a dinner at somebody's table, limited washing bills, table napkins rolled up in their dirt every day for a week, antimacassars to save the backs of the chairs, a picture of you darning my socks while I am reading a newspaper hired at a halfpenny from the public house round the corner, a pint of beer in the pewter between us -- and perhaps two babies in one cradle because we can't afford to buy a second.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't, Sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In such an emergency I am bound to give you the advantage both of my experience and imagination.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Experience!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not about the cradles! That is imagination. My darling, it won't do. You and I have not been brought up to make ourselves happy on a very limited income.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Papa would be sure to give us the money,\\\" she said, eagerly. \\\"In such a matter as this, where your happiness is concerned, my dear, I will trust no one.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My happiness!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, my dear, your happiness! I am quite willing to own the truth. I am not fitted to make you happy, if I were put upon the hashed mutton regime as I have described to you. I will not run the risk -- for your sake.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For your own, you mean,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Nor for my own, if you wish me to add that also.\\\"\\n\\nThen they walked up towards the house for some little way in silence. \\\"What is it you intend, then?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\\"I will ask your father once again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He will simply turn you out of the house,\\\" she said. Upon this he shrugged his shoulders, and they walked on to the hall door in silence.\\n\\nSir Thomas was not at Merle Park, nor was he expected home that evening. Frank Houston could only therefore ask for Lady Tringle, and her he saw together with Mr and Mrs Traffick. In presence of them all nothing could be said of love affairs; and, after sitting for half an hour, during which he was not entertained with much cordiality, he took his leave, saying that he would do himself the honour of calling on Sir Thomas in the City. While he was in the drawing-room Gertrude did not appear. She had retired to her room, and was there resolving that Frank Houston was not such a lover as would justify a girl in breaking her heart for him.\\n\\nAnd Frank as he went to town brought his mind to the same way of thinking. The girl wanted something romantic to be done, and he was not disposed to do anything romantic for her. He was not in the least angry with her, acknowledging to himself that she had quite as much a right to her way of looking at things as he had to his. But he felt almost sure that the Tringle alliance must be regarded as impossible. If so, should he look out for another heiress, or endeavour to enjoy life, stretching out his little income as far as might be possible -- or should he assume altogether a new character, make a hero of himself, and ask Imogene Docimer to share with him a little cottage in whatever might be the cheapest spot to be found in the civilised parts of Europe? If it was to be hashed mutton and a united cradle he would prefer Imogene Docimer to Gertrude Tringle for his companion.\\n\\nBut there was still open to him the one further chance with Sir Thomas; and this chance he could try with the comfortable feeling that he might be almost indifferent as to what Sir Thomas might say. To be prepared for either lot is very self-assuring when any matter of difficulty has to be taken in hand. On arriving at the house in Lombard Street he soon found himself ushered once more into Sir Thomas's presence. \\\"Well, Mr Houston, what can I do for you today?\\\" asked the man of business, with a pleasant smile.\\n\\n\\\"It is the old story, Sir Thomas.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't you think, Mr Houston, that there is something -- a little -- unmanly shall I call it, in coming so often about the same thing?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, Sir Thomas, I do not. I think my conduct has been manly throughout.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Weak, perhaps, would have been a better word. I do not wish to be uncourteous, and I will therefore withdraw unmanly. Is it not weak to encounter so many refusals on the same subject?\\\" \\\"I should feel myself to have been very strong if after so many refusals I were to be successful at last.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is not the least chance of it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why should there be no chance if your daughter's happiness depends upon it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is no chance, because I do not believe that my daughter's happiness does depend upon it. She is foolish, and has made a foolish proposition to you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What proposition?\\\" asked Houston, in surprise, having heard nothing of that intercepted letter.\\n\\n\\\"That journey to Ostend, with the prospect of finding a good-natured clergyman in the town! I hardly think you would be fool enough for that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, Sir Thomas, I should not do that. I should think it wrong.\\\" This he said quite gravely, asking no questions; but was very much at a loss to know where Sir Thomas had got his information. \\\"I am sure you would think it foolish: and it would be foolish. I pledge you my word, that were you to do such a thing I should not give you a shilling. I should not let my girl starve; but I should save her from suffering in such a manner as to let you have no share of the sustenance I provided for her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is no question of that kind,\\\" said Frank, angrily.\\n\\n\\\"I hope not -- only as I know that the suggestion has been made I have thought it well to tell you what would be my conduct if it were carried out.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It will not be carried out by me,\\\" said Frank.\\n\\n\\\"Very well; I am glad to hear it. To tell the truth, I never thought that you would run the risk. A gentleman of your sort, when he is looking for a wife with money, likes to have the money quite certain.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No doubt,\\\" said Frank, determined not to be browbeaten.\\n\\n\\\"And now, Mr Houston, let me say one word more to you and then we may part, as I hope, good friends. I do not mean my daughter Gertrude to marry any man such as you are -- by that I mean an idle gentleman without means. Should she do so in my teeth she would have to bear the punishment of sharing that poor gentleman's idleness and poverty. While I lived she would not be allowed absolutely to want, and when I died there would be some trifle for her, sufficient to keep the wolf from the door. But I give you my solemn word and honour that she shall never be the means of supplying wealth and luxury to such a husband as you would be. I have better purposes for my hard-earned money. Now, good-day.\\\" With that he rose from his chair and put out his hand. Frank rose also from his chair, took the hand that was offered him, and stepped out of Travers and Treason into Lombard Street, with no special desire to shake the dust off his feet as he did so. He felt that Sir Thomas had been reasonable -- and he felt also that Gertrude Tringle would perhaps have been dear at the money. Two or three days afterwards he despatched the following little note to poor Gertrude at Merle Park:\\n\\nDEAR GERTRUDE,\\n\\nI have seen your father again, and found him to be absolutely obdurate. I am sure he is quite in earnest when he tells me that he will not give his daughter to an impoverished idle fellow such as I am. Who shall say that he is wrong? I did not dare to tell him so, anxious as I was that he should change his purpose. I feel myself bound in honour, believing, as I do, that he is quite resolved in his purpose, to release you from your promise. I should feel that I was only doing you an injury were I to ask you to be bound by an engagement which could not, at any rate for many years, be brought to a happy termination.\\n\\nAs we may part as sincere friends I hope you will consent to keep the little token of my regard which I gave you.\\n\\nFRANK HOUSTON\\n\\nCHAPTER 38 FRANK HOUSTON IS PENITENT\\n\\n\\\"And now the Adriatic's free to wed another,\\\" said Houston to himself, as he put himself into a cab, and had himself carried to his club. There he wrote that valedictory letter to Gertrude which is given at the end of the last chapter. Had he reason to complain of his fate, or to rejoice? He had looked the question of an establishment full in the face -- an establishment to be created by Sir Thomas Tringle's money, to be shared with Sir Thomas Tringle's daughter, and had made up his mind to accept it, although the prospects were not, as he told himself, \\\"altogether rosy\\\". When he first made up his mind to marry Gertrude -- on condition that Gertrude should bring with her, at any rate, not less than three thousand a year -- he was quite aware that he would have to give up all his old ways of life, and all his little pleasures. He would become son-in-law to Sir Thomas Tringle, with a comfortable house to live in; with plenty to eat and drink, and, probably, a horse or two to ride. If he could manage things at their best, perhaps he might be able to settle himself at Pau, or some other place of the kind, so as to be as far away as possible from Tringle influences. But his little dinners at one club, his little rubbers of whist at the other club, his evenings at the opera, the pleasant smiles of the ladies, whom he loved in a general way -- these would be done with for ever! Earn his own bread! Why, he was going to earn his bread, and that in most disagreeable manner. He would set up an establishment, not because such an establishment would have any charms for him, but because he was compelled by lack of money to make some change in his present manner of life. And yet the time had been when he had looked forward to a marriage as the happiest thing that could befall him. As far as his nature could love, he had loved Imogene Docimer. There had come a glimpse upon him of something better than the little dinners and the little rubbers. There had been a prospect of an income -- not ample, as would have been that forthcoming from Sir Thomas -- but sufficient for a sweet and modest home, in which he thought that it would have sufficed for his happiness to paint a few pictures, and read a few books, and to love his wife and children. Even as to that there had been a doubt. There was a regret as to the charms of London life. But, nevertheless, he had made up his mind -- and she, without any doubt, had made up hers. Then that wicked uncle had died, and was found to have expended on his own pursuits the money which was to have been left to his nephew. Upon that there was an explanation between Frank and Imogene; and it was agreed that their engagement should be over, while a doubtful and dangerous friendship was to be encouraged between them.\\n\\nSuch was the condition of things when Frank first met Gertrude Tringle at Rome, now considerably more than twelve months since. When Gertrude had first received his proposition favourably he had written to Imogene a letter in that drolling spirit common to him, in which he declared his purpose -- or rather, not his purpose, but his untoward fate, should the gods be unkind to him. She had answered him after the same fashion, saying, that in regard to his future welfare she hoped that the gods would prove unkind. But had he known how to read all that her letter expressed between the lines, he would have perceived that her heart was more strongly moved than his own. Since that time he had learned the lesson. There had been a letter or two; and then there had been that walk in the wood on the Italian side of the Tyrolese Alps. The reader may remember how he was hurried away in the diligence for Innsbruck, because it was considered that his further sojourn in the same house with Imogene was dangerous. He had gone, and even as he went had attempted to make a joke of the whole affair. But it had not been quite a joke to him even then. There was Imogene's love and Imogene's anger -- and together with these an aversion towards the poor girl whom he intended to marry -- which became the stronger the more strongly he was convinced both of Imogene's love and of her anger.\\n\\nNevertheless, he persevered -- not with the best success, as has already been told. Now, as he left the house in Lombard Street, and wrote what was intended to be his last epistle to Gertrude, he was driven again to think of Miss Docimer. Indeed he had in his pocket, as he sat at his club, a little note which he had lately received from that lady, which, in truth, had disturbed him much when he made his last futile efforts at Merle Park and in Lombard Street. The little note was as follows:\\n\\nDEAR FRANK,\\n\\nOne little friendly word in spite of our storm on the Tyrolese hillside! If Miss Tringle is to be the arbiter of \\\"your fate -- why, then, let there be an end of everything between us. I should not care to be called upon to receive such a Mrs Frank Houston as a dear friend. But if Tringle pere should at the last moment prove hardhearted, then let me see you again.\\n\\nYours,\\n\\nI.\\n\\nWith this letter in his pocket he had gone down to Merle Park, determined to put an end to the Tringle affair in one way or the other. His duty, as he had planned it to himself, would not be altered by Imogene's letter; but if that duty should become impracticable -- why, then, it would be open to him to consider whatever Imogene might have to say to him.\\n\\nThe Docimers were now in London, where it was their custom to live during six months of the year,; but Houston had not been at their house since he had parted from them in the Tyrol. He had spent but little of his time in London since the autumn, and, when there, had not been anxious to see people who had, at any rate, treated him somewhat roughly. But now it would be necessary that he should answer Imogene's letter. What should be the nature of such answer he certainly had not as yet decided; nor could he have decided before those very convincing assurances of Sir Thomas Pringle. That matter was at any rate over, and now the \\\"Adriatic might wed another,\\\" -- if the Adriatic thought well to do so. The matter, however, was one which required a good deal of consideration. He gave to it ten minutes of intense thought, during which he consumed a cup of coffee and a cigarette; and then, throwing away the burnt end of the paper, he hurried into the morning-room, and wrote to the lady as follows:\\n\\nDEAR IMOGENE,\\n\\nYou will not have to press to your bosom as my wife the second daughter of Sir Thomas Tringle, Bart. The high honour of that alliance has at last been refused by him in very plain language. Had she become Mrs Frank Houston, I do not doubt but you would have done your duty to your own cousin. That lot, however, has not been written for me in the Book of Fates. The father is persistent in looking upon me as an idle profligate adventurer; and though he has been kind enough to hint more than once that it might be possible for me to achieve the young lady, he has succeeded in convincing me that I never should achieve anything beyond the barren possession of her beauty. A wife and family on my present very moderate income would be burdensome; and, therefore, with infinite regrets, I have bade adieu to Miss Tringle.\",\"timestamp\":1639991370,\"title\":\"I couldn't break open Travers and Treason, and get at the safe, or anything in that way.\"},\"digest\":\"H_hN3AyBOrA5Zj4G0IBiReFcGqd4qz6ML3-E_CZTCJg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x104C9415d8cF60006fA1f2ecb12Aa1B60108c24D\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"QZeSETSHSJeM026AC4_lE4E7olvhMHiFjTJCCgYuBD0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"g97xJhtzceEXQAlxJvBHtW-18JaOrZdNp_mU6eBH0TM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"pyNCdxj-SPPbR9EAltzOvgfkId53etOp0RDOcCLID6AoNW4mqqqO-M01mlM7ym833ldD0ikedu9VGfFer8uhOg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8f5c76f27e07d99e7d354d580fe09ea3291c61542a265ce0b8a956e1def0b98e7d832991c78955a60c9b5d538ca71d3810dfa955d85b4a711bc0dbd1e921c2e81b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"QZeSETSHSJeM026AC4_lE4E7olvhMHiFjTJCCgYuBD0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"g97xJhtzceEXQAlxJvBHtW-18JaOrZdNp_mU6eBH0TM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"H_hN3AyBOrA5Zj4G0IBiReFcGqd4qz6ML3-E_CZTCJg\"}"
