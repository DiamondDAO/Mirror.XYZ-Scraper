"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Mirror supports auctioning off NFTs using reserve auctions. Reserve auctions are configured with two main parameters: the reserve price and the auction duration. Like other economic blocks on Mirror, your auction is deployed as a smart contract and can be embedded inside any Mirror entry.\\n\\n## How auctions work\\n\\nWhen a bid is placed that matches or exceeds your reserve price, the auction duration countdown begins. Let's imagine that Alice creates an auction with a reserve price of 1 ETH and a duration of 12 hours.\\n\\n1. Bob places a bid of 1 ETH.\\n2. The clock starts counting down from 12 hours.\\n3. Any bids placed within the last 15 minutes of the auction reset the clock to 15 minutes.\\n4. A new bid must be 10% higher than the previous bid.\\n5. The collector that is last to place a bid before the auction ends wins the NFT.\\n\\n## Launching an auction\\n\\n### **Pick an NFT**\\n\\nTo create an Auction, pick an NFT from the \\\"Select NFT\\\" dropdown. Any Zora NFTs that are owned by the wallet that controls your Mirror publication will be pre-populated in the dropdown.\\n\\n### **Route the funds**\\n\\nProceeds from the auction can be routed to any Ethereum address or smart contract. If you want to route the funds for yourself, put your Ethereum address here.\\n\\nAlternatively, funds can flow to other economic blocks on Mirror, such as Crowdfunds or Splits. To route the proceeds from the NFT auction to  your Crowdfund, put your Crowdfund address here. You can also share funds with multiple entities by routing it to a Split contract address.\\n\\n### **Set the limits**\\n\\nHow long should the auction run after the first bid? What should the reserve price be?\\n\\n### **Deploying**\\n\\nAfter you deploy the auction, you'll get an embed code that you can paste into your entry. Save the entry and share it so people can bid.\",\"timestamp\":1621192268,\"title\":\"Guide â†’ Auctions\",\"publication\":\"jktest\"},\"digest\":\"5--4wRiGHYRdD5zChEYWXMcn0snbHnweXJ9b5Umyz-g\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x841fF85B6873d7bfB712C8f7A347C774355b6EC3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kOmDVnrIOu3X5CSd5UF5m2tl5GMFRWttYeFmi8vkWDg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"f8yyj32Vwczgi-q5B-Rf0OdQC4Jv6uL2_gMcl9fDTng\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Y9FeBuwxY9IwtjsiOmV1qd_eEgqBSc2KvJNGB_RsVQViilfXyjkWeswwZptnTsMMuPzdnaZ8JdCFNa3gwB_w6g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x7a2c894f36554fa35c37796b6cec5deda88c177e87fcd6f6360825cda4f72aaa7423009f515e91bb3274f67aa1bbc2549f59815c9b9984085b67e0c213fb0bae1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on jktest.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kOmDVnrIOu3X5CSd5UF5m2tl5GMFRWttYeFmi8vkWDg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"f8yyj32Vwczgi-q5B-Rf0OdQC4Jv6uL2_gMcl9fDTng\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"SOjXoSv7OxQQmqXva3xqGEUwybVoAHj-HlSimSZ6XFQ\"}"
