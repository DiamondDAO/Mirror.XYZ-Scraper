"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"One of the biggest challenges for developers building on Ethereum’s market leading smart contract platform/blockchain are the high fees and slow transactions. These issues arise from the fact that the Ethereum blockchain’s current architecture is not particularly scalable.\\n\\nThe Ethereum core developers have been working on these issues for years and there are changes coming in the core Ethereum protocol that will help with scalability. But the broader Ethereum community is not relying entirely on the core developers to address these issues. There are a number of “layer two” solutions that have emerged that will bring very significant increases in speed and lower fees.\\n\\nOne of these layer two solutions, called Zero Knowledge Rollups, is particularly exciting to us at USV and earlier this year we invested in a project called [Matter Labs](https://matter-labs.io/) (also known as ZKSync) that has built what we think is the best approach to Rollups on top of Ethereum.\\n\\nMy partner [Nick](https://twitter.com/nickgrossman) [posted today about ZKSync](https://www.usv.com/writing/2021/06/scaling-ethereum-with-zksync/) and outlined why we are so excited about this approach. If you are a developer building on Ethereum and are looking for a good layer two solution, you should absolutely read [Nick’s post](https://www.usv.com/writing/2021/06/scaling-ethereum-with-zksync/). I would also recommend it for anyone who is invested in or interested in Ethereum as layer two scaling solutions will likely unlock a lot of value in the Ethereum community over the coming years.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1622829695,\"title\":\"Scaling Ethereum \",\"publication\":\"avc\"},\"digest\":\"XkuMWWwRilvTkxQHj2eB7_N7KFrjOraP_-sesi_e0uI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LTl3aLSRol2QUVUD6CZDmgOh-_8_repOG-vj-b00m1o\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Q21DlwnMAzKTxzvSjREQR-eWtchCVIOEf9pQ8-_jbbs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"BYcAo4Ob1p-vfMpMCYZpIwNKnVAtMZ5Mp2-BWjM5EwZbt-hcRxcTVTOkxWMVjGX2nLkP2SeEaRvCHcoChxHkCQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa36ed4a1f484cc32e85a01be266ff07df93d7d551959ab6f44e5cb7aca49bba22841e81a419ff9150996b75ecf4a0a87eda7e1e79898e4f8e48a13744383f7451b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on avc.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LTl3aLSRol2QUVUD6CZDmgOh-_8_repOG-vj-b00m1o\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Q21DlwnMAzKTxzvSjREQR-eWtchCVIOEf9pQ8-_jbbs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"XkuMWWwRilvTkxQHj2eB7_N7KFrjOraP_-sesi_e0uI\"}"
