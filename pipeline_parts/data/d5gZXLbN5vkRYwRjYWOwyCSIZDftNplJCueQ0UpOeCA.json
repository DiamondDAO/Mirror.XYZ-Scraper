"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I am happy for you, and I envy you. It is my lifelong regret that I did not have a proper higher education, and I am a believer, so to speak, in the life of an institution. Please don't think of me as an example of someone who completed his education outside the university gates; in fact, I would have done better than I did if I had spent my days studying late at night. When I look at education as someone who has little experience with it, on the one hand, it seems unfathomable, and you may not know a thing about it in your lifetime; but on the other hand, it seems simple, and that is - sometimes I am glad that I am a person who can read, and I think how miserable my life would be if I could not read! I think how miserable life would be if I couldn't read! Education is perhaps what makes life a little more interesting and less boring. In this farewell today, I do not intend to talk to you about the profound aspects, because it is impossible for me to tell you, but it is necessary for you and us to search together, generation after generation, without ever getting a complete answer, so I only want to give you some simple instructions.\\n\\n```\\nFirst of all, I suggest that you do not think about usefulness, but more about useless values. There are already too many useful things in this world, all the cause-and-effect logic is connected and driven by the use, those marginal secondary nature from the chain broken down, eliminated from the game, life and life was diffuse dense shape, texture also has elasticity, now more and more filtered clean, and thus become smooth, hard, and single. This year's interview, I interviewed with a clinical medicine candidate, we talked about the issue of medical theft, she said that \\\"euthanasia\\\" is a strange humanitarianism, I asked why? The woman said that a person's life and death cannot be accounted for in terms of meaning, and I said, \\\"Do you mean that there is also an emotional element, that is, it is about the person's relatives and family? Said neither, but - she thought for a long time and said, life itself has value. I hope that our school does not miss this candidate, who explained my ideas about usefulness and uselessness.\\n\\nSecondly, I hope you don't go too far with efficiency, which is always purposive. In fact, we are all in process, which can be said to be about the essence of life, except that this process is increasingly divided into tiny, short purposes that steal our idea of what is right. Steve Jobs changed the world, but let the world better or worse, far from the time to draw conclusions. Later, will people think that existence is hidden behind the screen of that Apple machine, and that all arrival and return lies in the slightest touch of a fingertip. Whether physical or intellectual labor, all reduced to zero, what else can we do? And what else do we need to do? If we don't do anything, will we be happier or unhappy? In a society where efficiency is paramount, where process is belittled as a chore, where it is accounted for as a cost and then eliminated, where it is summarized as a symbol for the sake of computational convenience, how can we recognize the beneficial nature of existence in this artificially simulated system? How can we determine our purpose, assuming that one can waive the right and obligation to know?\\n\\nThird, I urge you not to rush into the competition, which will inevitably place you in contrast and affect your self-assessment. Competition will also place you in the so-called mainstream value system, which will also affect your values. And I hope that you will be confident enough to maintain a rational distance from the mainstream system and perfect yourselves in relative isolation. It is not that we should be proud of society, but in the long run of time, human history is just a stage, and the era we are in is a stage within a stage, with some development of the Lord, which really has a greater value outside our inspectable range, deciding the winner and the loser. And the concept of winning and losing is also something we have to be wary of, because there is already a potential unfairness in it, only balanced by the wording of legitimacy.\\n```\\n\\nIt is true that education today has many problems, some of them quite serious, but in any case, education does not lose its meaning, it is by far the most equitable opportunity for us to become better, so that not only you, but also we, thinking that you have generously given us the responsibility of your youth, will not dare to be lazy.\",\"timestamp\":1636907306,\"title\":\"The meaning of education\"},\"digest\":\"1vhQmEiAf-8iXPnvCFc6-XBp3GPaZvxS6F7JgpIuoO8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x71213a9C9504E406d3242436A4bf69c6bfE74461\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eaRiLDH82PZsNbEaMezG5WyMkwxxDMbpIQdaT14De4E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"vUJEvtR7mjqkwKr3jsUt_OMmk3iUBnb7Ab4SdzFmurw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"U6Av4mws4clEjIKReyiSOs7tlWJfZwTM74l2WZiidzV2zDds8uYRZjzZYpmRFgoxkRlsLL6ok6748TlmzmCnIQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0097975467da54f28da985dce051aefef1640b785ed2828a3984ba9c14bbc61b3f21437fdf9b28eb83cb294d7a9b0d0f1fc25dc0e76fb65568523db85ab73fa01c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eaRiLDH82PZsNbEaMezG5WyMkwxxDMbpIQdaT14De4E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"vUJEvtR7mjqkwKr3jsUt_OMmk3iUBnb7Ab4SdzFmurw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"1vhQmEiAf-8iXPnvCFc6-XBp3GPaZvxS6F7JgpIuoO8\"}"
