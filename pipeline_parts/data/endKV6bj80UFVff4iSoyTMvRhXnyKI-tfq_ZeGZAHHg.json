"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, [warned](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-27/milley-likens-china-s-hypersonic-weapon-test-to-sputnik-moment) Wednesday that China's test of a hypersonic missile is \\\"very concerning\\\" and \\\"very close\\\" to the kind of \\\"Sputnik moment\\\" that triggered the Space Race during the Cold War.\\n\\n**Why it matters:** The comments by America's top uniformed general underscore the depths of U.S. concerns about China's rapid military expansion and development of advanced weaponry.\\n\\n**The big picture:** In 1957, the Soviet Union's stunning launch of the Sputnik satellite raised alarms that the U.S. was falling behind in a technology race.\\n\\n* The Financial Times [reported](https://www.ft.com/content/ba0a3cde-719b-4040-93cb-a486e1f843fb) last week that China's test of a hypersonic missile, which could deliver a nuclear weapon that evades U.S. missile defenses, caught intelligence officials by surprise.\\n* \\\"I don’t know if it’s quite a Sputnik moment, but I think it’s very close to that. It has all of our attention,\\\" Milley told Bloomberg Television's \\\"The David Rubenstein Show: Peer-to-Peer Conversations.\\\"\\n\\n**Between the lines:** Weapons experts [told Axios](https://www.axios.com/us-china-cold-war-missile-taiwain-submarines-475e719b-60b1-48aa-9281-d0d38442c39f.html) that the \\\"Sputnik\\\" comparisons are not appropriate, noting that the technology China employed is similar to what the U.S. developed with the Space Shuttle program in the 1970s.\\n\\n* \\\"The point about Sputnik is that the Soviets had beaten us to the punch, they put the first satellite up,\\\" said Joshua Pollack, a nuclear proliferation [expert](https://nonproliferation.org/experts/joshua-pollack/) at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. \\\"Weapons payload aside, this is old hat for the United States.\\\"\\n* But the pace of China's progress, in tandem with its [military aggression](https://www.axios.com/taiwan-china-invasion-biden-1393d976-6c47-4954-9927-374ae967c1a9.html) toward Taiwan, [expansion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/china-nuclear-missile-silos/2021/06/30/0fa8debc-d9c2-11eb-bb9e-70fda8c37057_story.html) of nuclear missile silos, and broader geopolitical tensions with the U.S., has been enough to spark fears of a \\\"[new cold war](https://www.axios.com/us-china-cold-war-missile-taiwain-submarines-475e719b-60b1-48aa-9281-d0d38442c39f.html).\\\"\\n\\n**What they're saying:** \\\"They’re expanding rapidly — in space, in cyber and then in the traditional domains of land, sea and air,” Milley said. \\\"And they have gone from a peasant-based infantry army that was very, very large in 1979 to a very capable military that covers all the domains and has global ambitions.\\\"\\n\\n* \\\"As we go forward — over the next 10, 20, 25 years — there’s no question in my mind that the biggest geostrategic challenge to the United States is gonna be China,\\\" he added. \\\"They’ve developed a military that’s really significant.” \\n\\n## Go deeper\\n\\n[Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian](https://www.axios.com/authors/baebrahimian/), author of [China](https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-china)\\n\\n19 hours ago - [World](https://www.axios.com/world)\\n\\n### Interview: Hong Kong activist Frances Hui on extradition fears\",\"timestamp\":1635337430,\"title\":\"Top general: China's hypersonic missile test \\\"very close\\\" to a \\\"Sputnik moment\\\"\"},\"digest\":\"otgy1rXYNr1KCwKhJpDrCdAeJO6c42z5y3ApbgKVAhI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x445D2E92B9b68e0254f0d0F5FFDbbB8AD476AfbA\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"UYOhv85VPMNSx-IOH2FRnuE-PnKWtHfpibmW71d6ID0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KkDNf7veLwZ2264OqNEbB61NLmBaX5wzrbP_n1SZYIU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"_pxKl0rMvY0u3OSNuYI88MZ5HoLbC9TLGawyY-aFGgXi7uOmLKCyynmcBcCVyYEKYB2UmmQ_5rFbR-_t1wrA5w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1a9a0a957d33257ab916b6db3a2ba22c3253649bef41fe1c20c52faedb5e967306db6a390b6f2e71ca2d0463856c93d3138d41842610f25f23b4a7a505091c761c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"UYOhv85VPMNSx-IOH2FRnuE-PnKWtHfpibmW71d6ID0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KkDNf7veLwZ2264OqNEbB61NLmBaX5wzrbP_n1SZYIU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"otgy1rXYNr1KCwKhJpDrCdAeJO6c42z5y3ApbgKVAhI\"}"
