"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"There are at least two games in the world. A game that can be called a finite game\\n\\nThe other is called infinite game. Limited games aim to win, while unlimited games aim to continue the game. \\\"\\n\\nFinite games play within boundaries, while infinite games play within boundaries.\\n\\nEveryone in the coin circle wants cryptocurrency to be an unlimited game. There is no clear end point in the game. Players in the game can get considerable benefits in the process of continuous \\\"capacity expansion\\\" of this infinite game.\\n\\nFor some time, axie infinity players have gained a lot, some in Southeast Asia\\n\\nNational players even support their families through axie games.\\n\\nFrom \\\"free to play\\\" of traditional games to \\\"play to earn\\\" (p2e) of chain games, the game mode has changed greatly. Especially in recent months, various innovative playing methods have continuously enriched the game ecology. Chain tour has once again become the focus of the encryption market.\\n\\nAccording to the Google search trend, the search data of \\\"chain Tour\\\" has continued to rise since August 20, and recently reached the peak of search volume, including the Philippines\\n\\n, Vietnam and Singapore firmly occupy the top three in search volume.\\n\\nIn terms of the number of users, according to dappradar data, the number of chain game users has increased significantly. On August 5, the number of users once reached nearly 900000, compared with 46000 just six months ago.\\n\\nUnder the popularity of chain travel, capital giants have also paid attention. Among them are coinbase, Ma Yun and Cai Chongxin\\n\\nBlue pool capital, a family managed fund.\\n\\nAs of August 13, according to incomplete statistics, there were nearly a thousand publicly available chain game platforms on the market. After sorting out the top 10 platforms with users in recent 7 days, it is found that most of them are role-playing and based on BSC, which can be said that the playing methods are similar.\\n\\nWhy is role play more popular? In addition to being relatively simple and playable, players can also get a happy experience through role-playing. Most importantly, the economics of token contained in it\\n\\n, the so-called p2e, is easier to implement.\\n\\nSo, who will become the most potential of many chain game platforms?\\n\\nWe think that in addition to the number of users, the secondary market\\n\\nTurnover is also a key element. According to dapprad's data, cloud hunting finance has learned that the trading volume in recent 7 days\\n\\nThe top 10 platforms partially coincide with the above table. They are axie infinity, cryptoblades, mobox: NFT farmer, my DFI pet. Axie infinity, let's not say for the moment. There are too many reports on it in the market. Let's look at several other platforms.\\n\\nCryptoBlades\\n\\nCryptoblades is a role-playing (RPG) combat game on the coin security intelligent chain. Players can recruit heroes, exercise weapons, configure teams, upgrade and fight monsters to obtain skill revenue through skill tokens. The higher the level of victory, the higher the revenue. Each character, weapon and other equipment are NFT assets and can be freely traded with other players.\\n\\nSimilar to most \\\"earn while playing\\\" games, the main user base of cryptoblades is also concentrated in Southeast Asia. Like axie infinity, Filipino users account for the majority.\\n\\nStatistics show that cryptoblades is the best performing BSC chain game in July and the only DAPP with the most significant increase in the number of active wallets. According to dappradar data statistics, since mid July, indicators on cryptoblades necklaces began to soar. In just half a month, daily life soared 30 times. In the past 24 hours, the data has also performed well. Cryptoblades has achieved 3.22 million transactions with a trading volume of 2.17 million.\\n\\nMOBOXï¼šNFT Farmer\\n\\nMobox is also a BSc based project, which integrates game + asset management + machine gun pool. Its main businesses include revenue aggregator, game and asset management. Game is the core business of the project and the premise and foundation for the establishment of the other two businesses.\\n\\nAccording to officials, mobox is completely community driven. It aims to combine the respective advantages of defi and NFT, improve user participation and entertainment through token rewards, and provide distribution and traffic channels for IP creators and game developers.\\n\\nMobox allows users to obtain \\\"key\\\" rewards by pledging LP tokens or stable coins, which are agricultural tokens\\n\\nCan be used to unlock NFT, and NFT can be used for game characters or stacking in mobox.\\n\\nMy DeFi Pet\\n\\nMy defi pet is a virtual pet game hatched by kardiachain and developed by Vietnamese game developer topebox. The game mainly enables players to obtain rich rewards by collecting, creating, cultivating, fighting, activities, socializing and trading, and organically combines defi, collectibles and player personality.\\n\\nIt is understood that new pets will be born every hour, and the bidding lasts 24 hours to complete the collection; Any two pets will breed new breeds and complete the creation of breeds; Ensure cool new appearance and enhanced statistics at the stage of pet evolution, so as to increase scarcity cultivation; The fighting, socializing, trading and activities of game players after having pet characters can not only increase the game experience, but also obtain rich prizes.\\n\\nIn addition, in the market and quiz center of the game, players can earn income by trading pets and pledging dpet tokens. As the main token of my defi pet, dpet is mainly used to trade, exchange and improve pets and their special quality in the first stage.\\n\\nepilogue\\n\\nAs industry insiders say, blockchain\\n\\nThe technology driven p2e model has opened up a new generation of digital native economy for us\\n\\nOpportunity, playing games is not just a consumption behavior to pass the time.\\n\\nPlayers play games day after day, pay time and labor, experience the process, but earn income.\\n\\nHowever, it must be pointed out that the overall playability of the current blockchain p2e game is still not high, which is also the biggest pain point of the current chain game. In addition, the broken circle road of chain tour is also worth considering. After all, people outside the circle still have a threshold to play chain tour.
