"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**[Good Vibe Hunters](https://www.instagram.com/goodvibehunters) is an adventure lifestyle brand with big ambitions to disrupt the Travel, Apparel and Event Management industries by using the power of community and the shared ownership economy.**\\n\\nThe goal here is to create a rapidly growing decentralized organization of like minded individuals that work towards a global DAO of interlinked real world and web3 businesses..\\n\\nImagine Co-Owning a chain of profitable Remote Work Resorts/Hostels. Being a part of new branded apparel or accessory product design/marketing plan and deciding where and when the next meetup, group tour or event/festival will be. Everyone involved shares in the expansion ideas, but also share in the economic benefits.\\n\\nThis does sound very ambitious on the surface. But when broken down into bite sized pieces and baby steps coupled with a global network of different people with different talents and resources, the trajectory towards big goals is far easier than a traditional business model.\\n\\nWeb3 has created a thriving community of developers who have been busy building the infrastructure for a new frontier, now it is time to put these tools to the test and turn this dream into a reality..\\n\\n**If you have no Idea what a DAO is, I strongly recommend watching [this 3 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MaucjMwEUA) before reading on..**\\n\\n### Background\\n\\nGood Vibe Hunters was created in 2014 with the idea to have community generated content from followers on Instagram wearing our apparel whilst outdoors doing whatever their idea of good vibe hunting might be. It did not take long for hashtag #goodvibehunters to got from 0 to 10,000+ posts. It was very interesting to see how the sky diving community became the leading group of good vibe hunters, followed closely by SUP Yoga.. Neither of which, either of us two Aussie founders had ever done!\\n\\nUnfortunately as we were traveling Europe ourselves, we did not exactly have the stability to be processing clothing orders out of our backpacks! And such, the momentum fizzled out.\\n\\n**GVH was always meant to be a DAO!** Community generated content, the community decided what being a Good Vibe Hunter meant, the only thing missing was sharing the economic benefits that the followers content had created through T-Shirt and Accessory sales. Now, let’s imagine taking this a step further..\\n\\n### Traditional Organizations VS DAOs\\n\\nIt is important to have a basic understanding Traditional Organizations, why they fail and how they attract malpractices and fraudulent activities. Having this understanding helps understand the benefits and solutions Web3 and DAOs may provide.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/beC6VgQza71uG-v1mDoMl.png?height=742&width=1327)\\n\\n* \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/H64JED54nsNsNxQYphM9y.jpg?height=563&width=1000)\\n\\n**Remote Work Resorts:**\\n\\n* *Traditional:* Privately owned resorts are a lot to manage! From the physical upkeep and day to day management, to staying competitive with pricing and all the marketing and booking fees you pay to third party providers, it is hard to keep on to of it all. As the owner is the only beneficiary of success, they may decide to cut corners to make ends meet. They may also become inefficient with their time and energy due to individual biases and a limit of skills or resources.\\n* *DAO owned:* Ownership responsibilities are spread thin. Web3 creates opportunities to disrupt booking industry by creating NFT contracts for reservations that would be on a decentralized marketplace, this would help the DAO sell the accommodation for the optimal price and also change the customer into a partner. (If they can no longer attend, they have a vested interest in selling the booking NFT, potentially even for a profit! instead of a cancelation fee and an empty room!) The booking NFT would also have a small transaction fee that goes back to the DAO treasury. Potentially killing three birds with one stone: Next to no upset customers, extra income from a single booking and better occupancy with minimal human labour.\\n\\n  DAO owners also share in the marketing of the business, and let’s be honest, positive word of mouth is always the most effective form of marketing! DAO owners would also help and create new content when they are visiting. They could even be rewarded via a referral system that earns them more tokens and hence more ownership in the physical assets and Brand! Resort reviews become a web3 style suggestions box! Example: “Loved the stay, but the bed sheeting was stained! 3 stars” Instantly becomes a DAO vote: “Should we spend X from the treasury to upgrade linen to enhance user experience?” On site management roles would become similar to the way most hostels are run around the world with temporary workers coming and going as they please with only a small number of permanent managers, as DAO involvement grows, the roles and responsibilities manual would be refined for anyone involved to follow. They could be paid in a traditional format or some type of token compensation. As briefly mentioned earlier, all individual involvement in the front and back end of the DAO is either rewarded in GVHDAO tokens (So the person investing their time and effort are rewarded with more ownership) OR if the tokens are not liquid enough, they would be rewarded in ETH or USD stable coins out of the treasury.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NesDSA3altwcrcKFR2_tT.jpg?height=450&width=956)\\n\\n**Event Management**\\n\\n* *Traditional:* Company owner has an idea for an event, they choose a theme, location and decide on the artists or entertainment, make the bookings and sell the tickets. Marketing costs are high and it is a gamble weather the event will be a success or not. Upfront costs are high!\\n\\n  *DAO owned:* DAO owners are the initial customers. Ideas are passed around and voted on by the broader community. This removes an individuals bias for trying to create an event in a location that no one really wants. “If you build it, they will come” sounds nice, but is not always a reality! As the DAO should be made up with different people with different interests, the best event ideas should naturally surface to the top!\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KvPp6Y2ZnRyH5LMTXlkxu.PNG?height=770&width=986)\\n\\n**Apparel and Branded products**\\n\\n* *Traditional:* All traditional clothing brands are trying to create a brand that encapsulates a certain group. The trouble is, those brands may be owned by a corporation who have no interest in the interests of the actual group. This is usually the case when a Brand is bought out by a big corporation. It is just numbers to them\\n\\n  *DAO owned:* Relating this back to GVH, as mentioned in the introduction we had not anticipated the Skydiving community and impressive SUP Yoga pro’s to become the most involved members. Wouldn’t it be cool if these people came together to design, source materials and market the next product? It would start as an idea from one member, gain traction (or not) get voted on, then if successful a new team would emerge to make that product a reality. The first customers would be the DAO owners who were so hyped about it, but would naturally market the product to their circle of influence.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7PVpZTArnPfbq_hgGMgQA.jpg?height=700&width=1200)\\n\\n* **\\\\*Bonus: Group Travel**\\n\\n  *Traditional:* Company competes with other brands for customers by trying to market the ultimate experience where people meet and explore exotic destinations. The employees are paid next to nothing, but have a fun job. Marketing costs are high but the company has a long line of employees, executives and sometimes shareholders to pay. All of this is built into the cost of the experience/ticket.\\n\\n  *DAO owned:* Once again, the ownership and management responsibilities are spread thin. A shared ownership economy removes the competitive marketing costs. A customer that has a good experience doesn’t just give it a good review and tell some friends they should try it out, they get involved in the DAO and vote on new experiences or slight changes to the product they had just joined. Now, as they refer their friends, they are helping with the network effect and seeing the value of the DAO increase, including the treasury.\\n\\nYou may be thinking, this all sounds like a lot of disruption. That is correct, but all of the individual skills all ready exist, the people who possess the individual skills would just need to get involved in a new way of managing those skills. The compensation for their skills and input would be decided on by a broader working group as apposed to one single manager or location specific minimum wage.\\n\\nNotice their is no executive team or CEO? That does not mean their is no leadership at all. Individual leadership roles would naturally emerge, but these positions would never rise to a level of disproportionate compensation or an ability to get away with excessive bonuses as the DAO voting mechanism would be structured in a way to avoid majority ownership or some kind of percentage attack.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eRwr2OMwCcdt0N4501VQ0.png?height=721&width=1215)\\n\\n### The Future is faster than you think..\\n\\n*We are currently in the middle of a multitude of converging technologies as well as macro economic themes that I believe are setting the scene for one of the greatest opportunities in a lifetime. Let me explain..*\\n\\n1. Web3 and DAO’s - We are all still figuring out the possibilities of what this entails. If you have zero understanding, I suggest starting with [this explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTsL2ygY0-c). The easiest explanation I have read to explain a DAO, is that they are basically a community of contributors with a shared vision and a secure shared bank account.\\n2. The rise of the gig economy - First Uber, then Freelancer and now Web3. People want to work when they want, ***where they want*** on what they want!\\n3. Covid-19 - The global lockdowns have created opportunities in the most pent up industry.. **Travel**! 2 Years of forced savings have 18-35 year old’s the world over ready to explore! (Not to mention all of the new Blockchain protocols with big teams of developers and contributors.. What happens when they finally want to get together on a working team trip/holiday?)\\n4. Struggling Countries - Some Countries have faired better than others, unfortunately some fan favorites have not done so well. But that could create opportunities to scoop up cheap digital nomad resorts/hostels.\\n\\n### Ok, let’s talk details!\\n\\nGVH DAO is a token to help fund the **foundations** of a decentralized adventure lifestyle company. **We start by focusing on one goal**, but if successful all previously mentioned sectors will interlink some way in the future. I have curated a list of opportunities the GVH DAO could include. I will then focus predominantly on the first goal of purchasing a Remote Work Resort in a popular digital nomadic location like Bali, Indonesia.\\n\\n**Future real world income opportunities include:**\\n\\n* *Purchase and manage a chain of remote work resorts/hostels (Start with one!) token holders share the benefits of success.*\\n* Online store with community designed and managed products.\\n* Group Travel Tours, location and activities included voted by $GVHDAO holders. (Accommodation would likely be at the Co-Owned Resort)\\n* Community created content with advertising revenue on traditional platforms like YouTube.\\n* Music festival, conference or special event, voted by token holders.\\n* Many more opportunities as the brand recognition grows.\\n* A Franchise setup, if the community is large enough, other boutique hostels/resorts may be inclined to become franchisee’s.\\n* Other pay as you go memberships.\\n\\n**Web3 income opportunities:**\\n\\n* A “Membership” NFT sale (Similar to a resort timeshare sale)\\n\\n  *For example: 500 X Memberships, 10 ETH each. Ticket holders receive 2-10 years limited accommodation and event access. This alone, could fund the first resort/hostel purchase in a location like Indonesia.*\\n* A new NFT marketplace booking system. Removing the basic cancelation fees and helping find the perfect accommodation price.\\n* Treasury yield farming (Attractive interest rates earned on funds in the treasury by using various DeFi Protocols)\\n* Other lower tier NFT’s.\\n* NFT transaction fee income.\\n* Metaverse Meetups and events.\\n* Online reservation marketplace for buying and selling resort reservations.\\n\\n### DAOs doing things:\\n\\n*“With decentralization, DeFi, DAOs, NFTs, and technologies we haven't even invented yet, Americans are on the verge of unlocking a better, more transparent, and more fair financial system.”* - Mike Novogratz - CEO of Galaxy Investment partners\\n\\nWe are still early in the adoption and implementation of DAO’s, but to get an idea of what the early adopters are building with DAO’s, I have curated a small list of easy to understand DAO’s:\\n\\n* [Cabin DAO](https://foul-buffer-636.notion.site/Cabin-DAO-668930ccc2c64e8a958aacb2686e335f) - A group of >100 people who crowdfunded the first batch of residency cohorts at the cabins and were given ₡ABIN tokens. They literally pooled capital, got together and built 3 Cabins in Texas. This is the closest comparison to the GVH DAO. I encourage you to read through that link to understand the roadmap. Early $CABIN token holders had fun getting together and building the Cabins, but will also benefit as the DAO gains momentum and they look to expand.\\n* [Links DAO](https://linksdao.io/) is creating the modern golf & leisure club. A global community of thousands of enthusiasts has come together to create one of the world's greatest golf clubs - and reimagine the country club.\\n* [Krause House](https://krausehouse.club/) - A DAO with the mission to buy a NBA team.\\n* [$BACON](https://www.baconcoin.com/) - A new way to invest in US home loans\\n* [Lex DAO](https://www.lexdao.coop/) - Legal engineers trying to turn legal services into code\\n* There are hundreds of other Defi, Social and Web3 DAO’s\\n\\nMany of these DAO’s started as just a crazy idea from one person, but the idea quickly spread. The community got involved and investment followed. [Bit DAO](https://www.bitdao.io/) is a Web3 investment DAO that has amassed a $2.5 Billion treasury ready to deploy on the next big idea..\\n\\n### STEP 1:\\n\\nTo stress test the idea and put the foundational blocks in place, we are raising 20 ETH, with contributions capped at .5 ETH. That ensures a reasonable number of people are able to participate. Allocations are made on a first come, first serve basis. If you don’t have an Ethereum wallet, I recommend downloading[ Rainbow’s](https://rainbow.me/) mobile app (iOS only).[ Metamask](https://metamask.io/) is a good alternative.\\n\\nContributors will receive a stake in $GVHDAO, our token.\\n\\nAll proceeds of this initial crowdfund are for idea validation, to fund the expansion of the community, legal fees, building the correct governance and smart contracts. The goals of these funds will be to:\\n\\n* Pay for legal advice. The obvious question that pops to any logical persons mind. \\\\*GVH DAO operations do not have to include physical assets in the US or any other jurisdictions that are not Crypto Friendly. There are many Countries that would welcome the economic benefits that come with opening up to the remote work economy. We are not trying to avoid all taxes here!\\n* Build community to 500+ Unfortunately, there is a lot of noise in the Crypto space. A lot of scams and thousands of projects copying each other. Some funds will need to be used to pay influencers who can help build and find the right contributors with the missing skills.\\n* Re-Branding and front end design.\\n* Other Marketing, Infrastructure and Smart Contract costs.\\n\\nOnce the foundations are in place. We would vote on a second round via token sale. Further down the line, the NFT contracts (similar to [Links DAO memberships](https://linksdao.io/)) would be built to help fund the actual products and building construction or renovation.\\n\\n### What do $GVHDAO holders get?\\n\\nAs this is the foundation round, the risks of failure are at their highest. As such, a high risk should come with high reward. By backing the crowdfund, supporters receive three primary benefits if the project is a success:\\n\\n1. Shared Ownership in all future assets \\\\*Still need to figure out the tokenomics via a vote.\\n2. Founders NFT with lifetime benefits. \\\\*Air dropped once built\\n3. Voting rights in business decisions\\n4. Opportunity to get involved in the physical purchase, build or renovation and management of the first Resort.\\n\\nAbove all, you will be entering into the process of building this with us.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*Resort purchase may not be outright as some Countries do not allow foreign ownership. A leasehold title means that you own the right to use the villa for a specific number of years. Leasehold rights are normally granted to tenants of both residential and commercial premises. It can be 15, 20, 25 or 30 years, depending on the agreement. Acquiring the leasehold of property is straightforward with the lease being in the name of the foreigner or lessee (DAO). After the lease ends, the asset goes back to the landowner. However, it is possible to keep extending the lease. The leasehold is paid upfront. The economics of any potential purchase would be investigated and then voted on by the DAO token holders, no individual makes the executive decision.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EgwEvf4NN8GhXsjcL5dLD.png?height=839&width=1201)\\n\\n### Step 2 and beyond:\\n\\n1. NFT Memberships to help fund first resort purchase. These NFTs could be structured in a holiday timeshare style OR percentage of physical ownership. The best structure would be determined after liaising with legal council and smart contract developers.\\n2. The GVHDAO tokens may need to migrate to a new Operating System with more features, like [DauHaus](https://daohaus.club/)\\n3. More front end development, like an Opensea style booking system creating a marketplace for NFT smart contract booking reservations.\\n4. Go shopping! All DAO holders would be encouraged to participate in a Global search for the perfect first location from a top down framework. Is the Country crypto friendly? Is the City a hotspot for remote workers? How is the demand already met from other accommodation options? How does the actual purchase get structured? (Crypto to Fiat cash payment, asset held in a more traditional company structure with smart contract tying the assets to the DAO? Or an added DeFi layer where the assets are purchased with a new Defi loaning protocol for added leverage)\\n5. Document the journey of purchasing, renovating and running the first location. Imagine [“The block”](https://www.youtube.com/c/theblock/videos) Style YouTube Channel, where DAO holders help vote and decide on renovation decisions like room décor and garden design! This would not need to include every minor detail, the community input and interest would dictate how much people actually care.\\n6. Opening party - All Founding members would be invited (Invite list would be governed by initial backers size and involvement in the project so far) If members are unavailable to attend, they could auction off their spot in the marketplace. (A Founders opening party NFT that was airdropped to them earlier)\\n7. Business as usual - First location would have all the procedures in place to run efficiently as a new and improved way of running a remote work resort.\\n8. Expand - Depending on the success of the first location, the strength and size of the Community/Brand. Metaverse meetups and Discord conversations would result in expansion ideas being voted on. A second location? Ecommerce products? A special event in a totally different part of the world? A founders group travel trip? A festival?\\n9. Share in the success. **Selling the ideas and financing the initial operations is the hardest part.** Once up and running, the treasury should be building nicely. The DAO should have been designed in a way to share in the expansion and success of the Brand and it’s assets with those who helped make the vision a reality. More so than the pure speculation of the token value. The idea is to build real world profitable businesses, where contributors are compensated for their services without diluting the value of the underlying business. Finding the balance is key to success and happiness from all involved.\\n\\nIf you made it this far, and want to go further down the rabbit hole of what is possible through the DAO ecosystem, here is a list of interesting and inspiring content:\\n\\n* [Most interesting DAO’s of 2021](https://decrypt.co/88894/11-most-interesting-daos-of-2021)\\n* [Full time DAO’s](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/5vTIKBRzMpVAiNyc7CnABXjh3ToJrjQOnOdkwqvb3l8)\\n* [The DAO Planning Canvis](https://mirror.xyz/abatch.eth/3cL6s_qhmc7Ka5l8vRUaiO76nulfTCMovspE9ngL-P8)\\n* [The State of DAO Tooling](https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/organization-legos-the-state-of-dao-tooling-866b6879e93e)\\n* [Cooper Turley](https://alias.co/coopahtroopa/essays)\\n\\nAs you made it right to the end, you might as well join in the conversation by joining the GVH DAO [Discord](https://discord.gg/rxjaFVft) Early contributors will share in any success this crazy idea may produce..\\n\\n## FURTHER READING \\\\*not essential\\\\*\\n\\n### Some questions that may have sprung to mind\\n\\n*Ok, you may still be thinking this is still overwhelming. So let me break it down into the initial problems that come to mind and need solutions..*\\n\\n1. **How do I know if any of this is even possible?**\\n\\n   *We don’t know for sure. But there are projects like [$BACON](https://www.baconcoin.com/) who are already decentralizing home mortgages. Then there is [KrausHouse](https://krausehouse.club/) who are breaking down the questions and concerns in buying a NBA team as a DAO! Fractional ownership is taking over the world and some people think every company in the future will be a DAO, so it is not a question of “if” this is possible, it is more a question of “when” this will be possible. If you still don’t think this is possible, I encourage you to think back to when Uber first hit your town.. And watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISIjlRExdpE) to understand how they did what they did!*\\n2. **Ok, but there are many moving parts in all of this, where do you even start?**\\n\\n   *The main benefit of the fractional ownership economy is that the heavy load is shared by many people. Obviously the regulatory issues are the first thing that pops to mind. I recently discovered [Lex DAO](https://www.lexdao.coop/), a legal engineering guiled (A community full of Web3 curious Lawyers! There are many other similar communities that have all the emerging answers to how a Web3 world actually works.*\\n3. **How do I avoid being scammed or rug pulled?**\\n\\n   *Total transparency is key. If we can build a solid community of contributors that understand and agree on the long game (building revenue streams and a collection of assets that have utility) coupled with the leading cyber security systems, the organization could grow exponentially. Corruption and greed is the major drag on any growing enterprise. All investment funds stay in the community treasury to be voted on how they are used and who gets compensated what for their product or service.*\\n\\n### TIMESHARES\\n\\nTimeshare was created and marketed toward the middle aged, semi retired couples. As you can see by the screenshot below from the current website on a valuable domain [www.timeshares.com.au](https://www.timeshares.com.au) it seems there has been minimal improvements since the creation of the internet!\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fd311Vae6fs7LoyXMqiqD.PNG?height=866&width=1575)\\n\\nA quick Google search of “Timeshare” results in images and articles like this, warning of Timeshare scams.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jzE3mI3_ZtCT17jVe2Vkh.png?height=1309&width=700)\\n\\nThe benefit of a DAO run portfolio of properties (not to mention the other businesses that would pop up under the umbrella, like special events and festivals) with NFTs that replace timeshare ownership contracts, would be the liquidity and optionality of the NFT.\\n\\nIf the resort is fully booked out leading up to the date allocated to your week of free accommodation, you may opt to sell the accommodation in the marketplace. Rates would be dynamically adjusted like any other free market. This could even be automated to find the best rate if you know in advance you will not be using the accommodation.\\n\\nAs the NFT was sold as a pre build investment, the value of the NFT should raise in line with the value created in the building and brand recognition. Having the company run as a DAO, there should be enough interest from within the community or outside investors to easily sell the NFT with the click of a button. No lazy salesmen in the middle! The transaction costs involved would be a fraction of traditional property transactions. The minor transaction fees would benefit the DAO holders as those fees go into the treasury, used for maintenance and other value adding decisions.\\n\\nThe NFT release would come *after* the DAO token and community has been built. The NFT’s would have tiers **something like this** **(EXAMPLES ONLY)**\\n\\n**Platinum First Membership, 30 NFT’s**\\n\\nFeatures include:\\n\\n* 2 weeks accommodation per year at every location owned for 5 years.\\n* 2 night accommodation per year at every location franchised for 5 years\\n* 30% off any further accommodation\\n* VIP access to all special events for 10 years\\n* Name on plaque of first location\\n* Naming rights for room or area in first location\\n\\n**Gold Membership, 100 NFT’s**\\n\\nFeatures include:\\n\\n* 1 weeks accommodation per year at every location owned for 5 years.\\n* 2 night accommodation per year at every location franchised for 5 years.\\n* 20% off any further accommodation\\n* VIP access to all special events for 10 years\\n\\n**GVH Early Support, 200 NFT’s**\\n\\nFeatures include:\\n\\n* 2 Night accommodation per year at every location owned for 5 years.\\n* 2 night accommodation per year at every location franchised for 5 years.\\n* 15% off any further accommodation\\n* 50% off all special events for 10 years\\n\\nThe people that purchase these NFTs know and understand they are helping fund the initial start up costs and as such, they would be priced accordingly. The value should increase once up and running. There would also be other features that allow these NFT holders to rent out there claimed benefits through a marketplace on the website.\\n\\n### What does it look like?\\n\\nSo as I mentioned before, timeshares are a sometimes sketchy product for Baby Boomers and above. With the momentum of remote work through applications like [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) and a young generation who are eager to explore the world. I believe there is about to be an explosion of remote work resorts.\\n\\nBy getting involved, the DAO token holders would be involved in the decision making, like location and design or renovation but then also management decisions like how many beds per room, what the rates will be ect. The DAO holders would naturally become marketers to their individual circle of influence and then eventually share in the economic benefits.\\n\\nAs I mentioned earlier, DAO holders will have other benefits that haven’t even been thought about yet, and if they decide to travel and stay at a location, they will have some sort of discounted membership. The business does still need be profitable in the long run, so proper thought should be put into the initial offer of the tokens as it is difficult to completely pivot after the crowdfunding takes place.\\n\\nThe day to day operations and management would run as any other business, but the employees would be offered compensation or bonuses via the Token if the Token grows to accommodate enough liquidity at a somewhat stable value.\\n\\nThe value of the token would eventually become quantifiable by calculating the value of the assets, cash flow and community/brand value.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FQ4-mHSW7AB0-BHgZgnmc.jpg?height=550&width=930)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NQEqNa1nPGh_nbvDVV7xl.jpg?height=399&width=720)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ogod0c-HVpyCnyOJ1mapN.jpg?height=450&width=750)\\n\\nAs you made it right to the end, you might as well join in the conversation by joining the GVH DAO [Discord](https://discord.gg/rxjaFVft) Early contributors will share in any success this crazy idea may produce..\",\"timestamp\":1642418103,\"title\":\"GVH DAO - Remote Work Resort\"},\"digest\":\"KdwLg6UkiJsWaV1dN_fpu0hguTqpyFX1fOsdKuCZnDc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8C35F70115eDEC9982F3113Bb9a22168c84a6d83\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"b1ZVqbD8jIv3H6yHaeyRhjhryqQMsTaC433ZJHrquu8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"pap14MgbPezDeVYaIoqvAvCSRcPVjuGLwSnJs68VFT8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"C7AagoIuNDJe5QU01yXjKWHgggMThIUy3uRAT7WdDRd1-DGQ0lpSswvnRECqnFp0JtCHq45mFnClF7ydprs01Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x7c981eafa27070c29c22193a2c733b78fffc7a1329fa18bf2921ca686e7f5b147aa9492159c0802c4c99c6a7e6db74392a6e6ce742eccb10ad55fdf37289ea3901\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"b1ZVqbD8jIv3H6yHaeyRhjhryqQMsTaC433ZJHrquu8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"pap14MgbPezDeVYaIoqvAvCSRcPVjuGLwSnJs68VFT8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"DiIuGJGtKzO6LwfI7cj9jvVasRIXDQz3WFLenzM5kC0\"}"
