Using Blockchain technology anyone with an account on-chain can claim an address, anything they make, instruments and songs they acquire, are all stored with that address and are accessible from anywhere via a connected device. Although other tools work in a similar fashion, none allow for universal access through link and id sharing, nor provide a way to give access to VSTs in a web3 based app.\\n\\nThe goal of this project is to decentralize the music industry and create user owned ecosystems in which music (in all forms - full tracks, sessions, stems, VSTs) can be shared, sold, bought, and played with an interface that is accessible from anywhere at any time.\\n\\n![Non-Fungible Devices](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YgMP43hNgAQrtHyJQeea3.png?height=2112&width=2187)\\n\\n![FIle Explorer](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/u8XcEWdVV71cgju7CmNI9.png?height=3072&width=5349)\\n\\n**OBSTACLES** \\n  \\n Low to no cost blockchain transaction fees due to volume of Non fungible token creation \\n Interface for user searchable data \\n Background method of tracking likes and popularity of files + display in categorized lists \\n Give users the option to set NFTs as public/opensource and private/closed \\n Background method to snapshot session data + mint as smart contract with user adjustable visibility \\n Enable users to share smart contract sessions \\n Non fungible Virtual Instrument creation and/or partnership with VST creators + software instrument companies \\n Background method to categorize and display wallet contents (VST, songs, sessions) \\n Method of connecting/scanning local hardware for VST \\n Method of “playing” audio files on the blockchain \\n  \\n **POSSIBILTIES** \\n  \\n Creation of a decentralized music and content industry from creator based work \\n Elimination of Hardware requirements \\n Instant access from anywhere at anytime \\n Partnership with other Digital Audio Workstations, Software instruments \\n verifiable user submission and collection of items \\n user ran record labels and collectives \\n Partnership with record labels for a+r and submission \\n Partnership with social media or metaverse application to share/display tracks that are on-chain\",\"timestamp\":1640710563,\"title\":\"Open-source Ideas: PLATFRM\"},\"digest\":\"Tmj-hb12kG4HW4ADA53JKGolLVFKnuzlnJGn6YO39eI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2bFA74Fd69756749d2Cad661F7486DBa3B1Fb124\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"iOSGergmtk5wk4tMC56obXbeYLabs_Y8af8VnTKKycM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"T61QBOB7gyQpx2H7saYLA-EOWo09ewwt3rSP367taa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"URDibg8yoyz-sYZ7y-167HllRhE8zWvWU7SKsTWLt59S99D4huLdfTMpYJK5uX7t8-joUACuHloz8HT3GpvFXg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2964f6a7b47177b4ed8ebb80dbf2c670f9ebb25c92ee83d899570f5b5cd8eedf21a183845b283919ef3a457bc3fc4683a9a864fc5ea9b2ca9f6faaa5b48419b501\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"iOSGergmtk5wk4tMC56obXbeYLabs_Y8af8VnTKKycM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"T61QBOB7gyQpx2H7saYLA-EOWo09ewwt3rSP367taa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Tmj-hb12kG4HW4ADA53JKGolLVFKnuzlnJGn6YO39eI\"}"
