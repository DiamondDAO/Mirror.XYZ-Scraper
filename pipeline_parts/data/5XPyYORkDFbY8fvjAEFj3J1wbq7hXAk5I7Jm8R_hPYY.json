"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Similar digital card games, such as Hearthstone, provide no such direct reward potential, nor can cards be individually sold on a marketplace (or traded at all). To earn money in Hearthstone, you need to be a pro player with a salary or a talented streamer who can build a brand around themselves. Very seldom can ordinary players can earn money directly from Hearthstone’s pro circuit. This requires months of high leaderboard placement in order to qualify for a cash event. Then players need to travel to compete at in-person tournaments where placing outside the top 16 means no monetary reward and a sizable travel bill. \\n\\n#### Grinding for rewards\\n\\nIn Axie Infinity, a Pokémon-inspired universe where players battle, raise, and collect fantasy creatures, the game highlights the benefits of Play2Earn through rewarding gameplay and a player-driven economy. Battling monsters in the game’s PvE mode will earn you tokens called Love Potions which can be sold for the highly liquid cryptocurrency Ether. With those proceeds, you can choose to buy additional items in Axie Infinity, or migrate that value to a different crypto-enabled game, or even sell them for U.S. dollars. \\n\\nAxie has also been paying out tokens from sponsors such as MakerDAO & Kyber Network, two of the top DeFi (decentralized finance) projects, to the top 50 players on their leaderboard. This represents a new model in which advertising budgets go directly to the players, which drives more engagement and demand for game assets within an ecosystem.\\n\\n \\n\\n#### More from NFT and Blockchain Gaming Theme Week\",\"timestamp\":1639040856,\"title\":\"Similar digital card games, such as Hearthstone\"},\"digest\":\"Dv5dBuBUqYtIdKRtYh_xhGbFsGixolDbqJLsT21xH6g\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2b02466633bE17c2B131430b6B3d2e5CB918c964\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3rdg5Bx_4yxfiiUIvEMJGkQeAGpSh-yGSOamY-0bZkM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"om8yFSjfBHQnlBBKS7abFr69-VhL3DYIUn2HyKl8Wf4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"VcNyVbewrogePQdTVZJ9twzXnAGr8gyTEBIoOA7RoGYZMlsgG22HSEDTwuhhedEYPdQ6OEF1vu-XHwiMUU1sDw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x76be8ed67ee59308f1c89d08aadfcd1ba90d5b9e4d675e2c421b836fba8638d95cf4a9fd7e6127672d18549f5fa15f02005c9dac351106ae62c8396e08d44f771c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3rdg5Bx_4yxfiiUIvEMJGkQeAGpSh-yGSOamY-0bZkM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"om8yFSjfBHQnlBBKS7abFr69-VhL3DYIUn2HyKl8Wf4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Dv5dBuBUqYtIdKRtYh_xhGbFsGixolDbqJLsT21xH6g\"}"
