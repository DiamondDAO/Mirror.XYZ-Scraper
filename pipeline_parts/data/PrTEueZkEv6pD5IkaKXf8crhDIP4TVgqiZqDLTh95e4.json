"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### Today we’re introducing voyager, a creator DAO for art, music and media with a community focus on resonance and creative practice\\n\\nvoyager is a space to be in resonance, flow, and connection with artists, musicians, and creatives who are experimenting in web3. We are here to establish a web3 creative organization that’s collectively owned and governed by its members.\\n\\nWe are a community of artists founded by artists. We have fun and make stuff. Getting into a practice of making art, jamming together and sharing works in progress for cross pollination and dynamic feedback loops in connection with a network of creatives across mediums.\\n\\nWhether you’ve recorded music, designed artwork, coded a generative project, made a video, or wrote an article, the community is available to share feedback, make suggestions, and amplify the energy of new works with a potential for collaboration.\\n\\nApplications to join Season 0 and become an early voyager member are open [here](https://airtable.com/shrfUKOCBGihLezqm).\\n\\nThe genesis of voyager DAO is coming later in 2022. Our announcement today is for the founding blueprint of our creative organization:\\n\\n* curated art catalog on Zora\\n* web3 music label\\n* counterculture zine on Mirror\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yhb7AC90ZrpYvz02oG9qt.jpg?height=1500&width=3000&&&&&&&&&size=large)\\n\\n## Exploring a web3 ecosystem\\n\\nArt is always evolving with technology and web3 is the next evolution of the internet. Flowing like water around barriers in a process of discovery.\\n\\nThis is where we find ourselves today. We have experienced being artists, musicians and creators in web2 platforms that do not share equitable benefits. So what might the coming years look like in the emerging web3 space?\\n\\nAspects we consider beneficial:\\n\\n* Building with open protocols that are decentralized and community governed\\n* Transparency and openness\\n* On-chain provenance\\n* Proof of ownership and authenticity for artists\\n* Composability and co-creation in an interoperable ecosystem\\n* Funding opportunities that enable artists to go their own way\\n* Knowledge and tools being shared with creators and communities\\n* The possibility to advance towards a more equitable and harmonious world\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OsFiLfu8PnBSithoTZ_Ah.jpg?height=1250&width=1895)\\n\\n## Call to adventure\\n\\nWe are keenly aware that immersion in crypto, DAOs and a NFTs degen lifestyle is depleting for many of us. Information overload and addictive use of technology is counteractive to a balanced state of being and optimum creative practice.\\n\\nWe are conscious of this reality for creative people. There is a sanctuary for you here. A dedicated space and time to feel into your practice.\\n\\nWe also understand the hesitation that people can experience when looking to get started in web3. We get it. There is so much that feels unknown and unfamiliar. So much to learn, a lack of clarity, and many different voices. Perhaps you’ll feel it’s all too difficult to get started?\\n\\nImagine voyager as your friendly welcoming party. Meeting you after a long journey to give you a ride from the airport, help with your bags, bring you straight to your destination and invite you inside.\\n\\nYou arrive feeling at your best and ready to have a good time. Walking into great conversations with people and friends talking about art, creative projects and everything you’re into. As we learn together and inspire each other, a dynamic signal arises from a sea of noise which helps us navigate. Tangible ritualised practice and cross pollination becomes a force of mythic proportions.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qVNz9K97BbiCi0Y-F3hJJ.jpg?height=1250&width=1895)\\n\\n## Blueprint for Season 0\\n\\n### Art\\n\\nCurated art hosted on the Ethereum blockchain.
