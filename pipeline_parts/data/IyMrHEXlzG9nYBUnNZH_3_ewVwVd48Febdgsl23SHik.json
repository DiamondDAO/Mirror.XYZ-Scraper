BLOCKCHAIN & BE GDPR COMPLIANT?\\n  * YES: Users have the opportunity to ‘erase’ information from the blockchain by means of burning tokens that contain data: non-fungible tokens (ERC721). The reason blockchain companies should use the ERC-721 token (and not the most frequently used one, ERC20) is that only non-fungible tokens are read by the system as containers in which you put information. Also, the user who keeps a token in his or her private account may determine who will be able to access the data with the help of his/her private key and BIP-32 protocol. Moreover, all ERC20s are equal to each other, just like dollars, while the ERC721 allows the storage of different sizes of information within it.There are several actions that should be taken to burn ERC721 tokens. These include erasing metadata in the ERC721 token and then assigning its account number to the last minted ERC721 token. This will lead to the burning of the sold ERC721 token.\\n\\n** \\n **\\n\\n[TRACE ](https://www.traceinternational.org/)\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1639005155,\"title\":\"THE WEB 3 ACCELERATOR: SOURCING INNOVATION, FUNDING, AND INVESTMENT.
