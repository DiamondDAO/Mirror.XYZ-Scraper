"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*ccessing decentralized finance products and services starts with a gateway, more commonly known as a DeFi wallet.*\\n\\nTo help users get access to some of these features, DeFi wallets become key. While traditionally, these wallets were complex to use and slow to operate, they are now becoming more streamlined and easier for new users to navigate than ever before. As the core to DeFi, wallets allow users to access new financial products as a cryptocurrency gateway to Web 3.0, thereby providing freedom, transparency and ownership of a user’s assets.\\n\\n3\\\\.\\n\\n## What is a DeFi wallet?\\n\\n*A DeFi wallet is a solution that provides users with complete ownership over their assets and is positioned as one of the safest storage methods available today.*\\n\\nAs an access point, a DeFi wallet provides users with a solution that leaves the power completely in the hands of their owner. This contrasts greatly with a traditional bank, which retains control of all of the user’s assets in its holdings and requires user verification and other related information to do so.\\n\\nDeFi wallets eliminate the need for a third party, a concept that further revolutionizes the financial industry. Looking at DeFi wallets generally, most operate as [Web 3.0](https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-three-traits-of-web-3-0-that-fix-what-went-wrong-with-today-s-internet) wallets with compatibility on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain (although this may vary).\\n\\nOther similarities across these wallets include their compatibility with DeFi applications and their position as a key-based solution requiring users to retain responsibility for the safekeeping of their private key. DeFi wallets also operate with a non-custodial background, ensuring only the wallet owner has access to the funds.\\n\\nFor these reasons, DeFi wallets are among the safest solutions on the market. However, their security becomes a product of the user, who then may find themselves out of luck if they lose their login information.\",\"timestamp\":1639122279,\"title\":\"How can users get started in the DeFi world?\"},\"digest\":\"XbHsgDcir2WFKQjETK7Ulr5J7HLBI-Qnxar874cayMw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x21106D1f84E7Ee7048b138EDEe27307E1B25f690\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-XcBmXSmcf27wNW0KLPUNyAt1B6oh-OncLfe2Ftslsk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QnJ8X4jWS84PdKn3RMnTIQsXCUBQ_UtRocvnXvJDUS4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"-FU5SXBOhx09kCI-Nd8QFr2BDaihk1xCjvFdrW8ajBWGKeAp-3RqfyECFaUK5a-bJGvp4t7ZDnoYNTlDI-slwg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xce1b5d44a93459c0ea8a579cf1bad8dba6aa85d781edfdf65e015b8fe66193102492cc80d85f6df2f1efad767cfc080161ec68f0595a71bcc59efe2c6049c4a71c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-XcBmXSmcf27wNW0KLPUNyAt1B6oh-OncLfe2Ftslsk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QnJ8X4jWS84PdKn3RMnTIQsXCUBQ_UtRocvnXvJDUS4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"XbHsgDcir2WFKQjETK7Ulr5J7HLBI-Qnxar874cayMw\"}"
