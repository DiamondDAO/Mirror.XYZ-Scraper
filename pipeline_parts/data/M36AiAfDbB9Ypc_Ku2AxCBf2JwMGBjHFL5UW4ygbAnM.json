"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Compared with Bitcoin, which is regarded as a distributed ledger, Ethereum is committed to becoming a \\\"next generation smart contract and decentralized application platform\\\", which can be regarded as a distributed computing platform that can run programs.\\n\\nVitalik also conceived it as a decentralized \\\"world computer\\\". As a computer, it needs functions such as calculation, storage, and execution.\\n\\nTherefore, in addition to the basic data storage functions of the Bitcoin network, Ethereum also needs to run various codes for calculations. The software or applications compiled and interpreted by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) are \\\"smart contracts\\\".\\n\\nWhen a transfer transaction occurs on the Ethereum chain, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) will perform the following series of tasks:\\n\\nRetrieve the value of the transfer and analyze the contract's instructions.\\nCalculate the consumption of Gas (handling fee), and ensure that the address that sends the transfer has enough Gas fee.\\nExecute the contract and realize the transfer to the corresponding address.\\nFrom the above workflow of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), we can see several functions of EVM for Ethereum:\\n\\nEasy to test: In order to ensure the smooth execution of various \\\"smart contracts\\\", we need to create a safe operating environment for them. The Ethereum Virtual Machine is a code operating environment.\\nAs we said above, various operations in the virtual machine will not affect the host. Any developer who wants to create a smart contract on the Ethereum virtual machine can test various applications on the virtual machine without occupying the main chain resources. It is also not affected by other blockchains.\\n\\nIncrease security: Ethereum carries various applications with powerful functions, and its logic is more complicated, and developers are more prone to various vulnerabilities. The Ethereum Virtual Machine is a completely independent sandbox, and the contract code can be completely isolated from the outside and run inside the EVM.\\nNot only can it prevent the entire main chain from being affected by criminals or programmers' programming errors, but it can also prevent the physical equipment running the smart contract from being attacked.\\n\\nEnsuring stability: Since the Ethereum virtual machine is deployed on each node of the Ethereum network, the data of the entire Ethereum network is maintained and updated by many nodes, which maintains the consistency of the entire blockchain data, which also enables the Ethereum The workshop has extremely high fault tolerance and guarantees zero downtime.\",\"timestamp\":1634479369,\"title\":\"What is the use of the Ethereum Virtual Machine?\"},\"digest\":\"qb0H9F1-H5_3mTqSdael9zDMPBGqq2IBlladYC5bISk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd8c19eAE0bd8Bc6f48538dbC54285499fF21fE1c\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eIAdgQrv68xYxqeKhDPsvZSnVohvfvQznGFFjSmEYpg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TWytvYGB-q8FhCWwQcAGH5mbVCupn80SxySerAWpusw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"GfpCae2QeRwPdU1w22twXYnBF_RQ0S6h7jNfAEsHTeWh9lxUOjHHLvjCZrj12B4alM1Y3bZsT55lLZCH_zeLhg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9030be729598f7d5b393ede9952fc2200207c148f89c8c964d6c272c11f468c07585bd06cb3a1a43cd5130fcb303b89e730d3ae919d003277fd1a7e2e906cceb1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eIAdgQrv68xYxqeKhDPsvZSnVohvfvQznGFFjSmEYpg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TWytvYGB-q8FhCWwQcAGH5mbVCupn80SxySerAWpusw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"qb0H9F1-H5_3mTqSdael9zDMPBGqq2IBlladYC5bISk\"}"
