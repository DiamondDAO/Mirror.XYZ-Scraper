"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1961 Berlin\\n\\nA long war, made of two global wars with a 20 year break in-between, turned the world upside down and killed millions. \\n\\nThere was another pause in 1945 - just long enough for a new kind of secret war to begin. A ‘Cold War’.\\n\\nThe victors looked at the spoils and turned on each other. They split Europe in half, and in public, each side declared they would win the peace through productivity. Behind the scenes they would compete in other ways.\\n\\nThe Eastern half failed to put enough food on tables and at the same time crushed the spirits of millions. Hundreds of thousands ran westward in the years that followed. The Eastern half’s masters gave an ultimatum - all armed forces on both sides had to leave Berlin. \\n\\nKrushchev pushed, JFK pushed back.\\n\\nIn 1961, the local powers-that-be of the “German Democratic Republic” decided to put an end to it. \\n\\nThey built a wall to keep their “republic” from becoming empty. Orders for enough barbed wire to encircle West Berlin was spread out and were so secret that firms in West Germany and the United Kingdom didn’t know they were among the suppliers.\\n\\nCheckpoint Charlie was a crossing point for a city divided in two, East and West Berlin. A portal between two different worlds. It was tiny crack in a dam built to keep an ocean of people and secrets from leaking out.\\n\\nThey still leaked.\\n\\n2911\\n\\nJacob C. Tagore, Jr. fought the urge to struggle against his restraints. \\n\\nIt would do no good. He focused on his breathing. The hood kept him in the dark but he could still breathe. He slowed his breathing.\\n\\nThen, the background glare of city lights and sounds returned. He fought his panic back. He wasn’t used to urban life with a natural gravity well. Falling off a tower was not freefall - it was something that nanos and stims could not repair. \\n\\nJacob had company.\\n\\n‘They haven’t finished construction here, and you know it is, builders have deadlines, they got their milestones and billions of tokens involved. A lot is on the line and accidents are going to happen. It’s a shame the cams are offline. Routine maintenance for drones.”\\n\\nThe men around Jacob closed in. \\n\\nHe scanned and counted. Jacob saw that one of the men carried a carbonlight. Jacob targeted him first. That carbonlight will cut open the restraints, and the rest would follow.\\n\\nThe sunset was a deep hazy blue. The city was a non-stop concert of mechanical motion and morphing. It was peaceful.\\n\\nJacob wiped off the blood, using one of the men’s shirts, and swapped clothes with his closest match. It was good enough. He pocketed their peripherals. He set the cleaner drone on high to scrape away all trace of him after he left. The cams were offline, they wouldn’t be found in the maintenance room for a while.\\n\\nHe was about to walk through a back alley, someone was waiting.\\n\\n”Did you retrieve it?”\\n\\n”Yes. sir. All protocols for dispatch and disposal were followed.”\\n\\n”Good, another week of tests done. Prepare for next week.”\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tgsFvnvoheiG3SaX8avvV.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yf4wmfqjjhj9NXOYjbij_.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633889583,\"title\":\"1961: 5.1 A Secret War, 2911\"},\"digest\":\"-dUAu9hgh-XU2kuOFsZd_JQw7a3faSD5ca2rdFPzGAA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"G46TTlsHHO3x5hIp1XbKw-h_zhAqiF0uPgJuK7_zwPj0YMJD4VNoVRgKJHbbOfl7_cMBM9Hy4P7E-D0PfBzjGA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"g2lsSAW0X2Lh0wLgBs4UShJzdqCnnhsHy5HA7Ddw2m8\"}"
