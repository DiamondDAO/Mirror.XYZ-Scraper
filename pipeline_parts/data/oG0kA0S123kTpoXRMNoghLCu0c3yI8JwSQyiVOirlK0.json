"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"We will attempt to chronicle the NYC trip in “chronological” order for posterity! Each chance encounter unlocked a new magical reality throughout this trip.\\n\\nDay 1 (PM)\\n\\nSunday- Drive from Temecula to San Diego with my dad. To be more accurate he drove because he’s the best and I tried to make sure I had everything in order for the trip to catch my red-eye flight from SAN airport on Sunday night. All went well and smoothly at the airport, I didn’t sleep much due to a divine appointment with the person next to me on the flight; but I learned a lot about the way I am connected to my indigenous ancestors even now.\\n\\nDay 2 (AM)\\n\\nMonday morning around 11 AM I land in Laguardia airport in NYC and am picked up by my good friend Sal Del who lives in the city. He picks me up at the airport and we drive about 20 minutes to Vero’s apartment in Harlem where she is most graciously hosting me for most of the week ( @verowang_ on IG)\\n\\n![A look inside a real NYC artist apartment: three artists having bagels Sal got for all of us was my first official breakfast in NY.

As I could only have imagined knowing her for months only through the voice app Clubhouse. You could say Vero and I already had a pretty strong connection, as she had told our group of friends one day that she had dreamt of me in two separate occasions in the past! Both dreams were full of whimsy and magic which we tried to recreate in real life - minus the bike with the basket and the central park picnic. Although we did have a semi- picnic with cheese pies on the last day of my stay in NY - provided by our friend Sara who shared they are traditional Arab / Syrian dish from her heritage which was deeeelicious! She brought a huge box so I brought a few back to CA for the 6+ hour journey home and ate them in my moms kitchen late at night after I landed after the trip.\\n\\nBack to Monday though, we settled in, smoked a little and ate some nice cheesy bodega bagels Sal got for all of us.\\n\\nAfter freshening up, Vero and I went for a walk down to her work space Noonlight Studios, where we got to make some photos on the rooftop. Then met her business partner Violet, who is an amazing artist and immediately started to load a large format film camera in what looked like a pair of pants to create some photos.\\n\\n![Photo of @ultravioletttt loading film into her large format camera taken by @Creatressart. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2a1pAqSy6aQOO5_96xIGg.jpg?height=1558&width=1170)\\n\\nAt this point Vero also picked out a camera I could use to document the NFT.NYC speakers and audience at the main festival sessions the next day. I also spent some time giving Vero, Violet and Kofa a preview of my VR performance using her Mac to display what I saw inside the studio and giving Vero her first demo inside VR.\\n\\nI was also lucky enough to be chosen to model for one of the photos they created with the large format camera; for the shot, they instructed me to go down to the street and across to a spot on the opposing sidewalk where a strip of sunlight was still shinning. They called me to make sure I was standing in the right spot and I stood still as I waited for them to click the shutter from the 12th floor studio window. Once I got the message that they were done I headed off to the subway for my first ride on the subway alone for this trip.\\n\\n![Photograph made on large format camera by @ultravioletttt](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M_TZtPnKSAcL4taYno50m.JPEG?height=5953&width=4701)\\n\\nDay 2 (PM)\\n\\nI managed to make my way to the Margaritaville Resort near Time Square and was able to find the right people to check in and get my badge for the NFT.NYC festival. The first person I ran into as I came up the escalators was Laurel Jensen (untangleddragons on IG) who I recognized from her clubhouse profile photo and then confirmed by looking at her badge with her name on it. Thank goodness for badges with names on them!\\n\\nI also met Laurel’s partner Brad Anderson (@bradtheappguy) before I headed to get my badge, my sweatshirt and hat swag from the event. Happy to report they had a small black sweatshirt when I pulled up! Although an extra small might have fit my tiny frame a bit better, I was excited to wear it and blend in for the next day when I would be taking photos for the event at the Edison Hotel.\\n\\nAfter getting my badge and swag I walked over to Carragher's Pub & Restaurant with Laurel to check out the Enchanted Valley Community Meetup hosted by Charmaine Hussain, one of the artists I look up to and am proud to have in my collection. As I walked in and upstairs that was the first time I saw Gabe W, who was also at Carragher’s and seemingly having some good conversation I didn’t dare interrupt. I was fortunate to serendipitously meet him at a later time during the trip.\\n\\nI went forward to greet the group and met so many wonderful people at once that I had spoken to on clubhouse or twitter spaces in the past year! I met Charmaine of course, who was as warm and loving as she sounds online. She gifted me a lovely Enchanted Valley pin I treasure. I met her collaborator Himanshu as well, the Architect of the Valley who was a lovely human as well. At this wonderful space we also encountered the bright Jimena BV, the amazing Dr.Lem, Layla P, Ana C, Randi, and many more gorgeous souls I had been hoping to meet for some time.\\n\\nI was quite tired so after the Enchanted meet up I decided to call it an early night and hop back on the subway to head back to Vero’s house. We got into comfy clothes and had a sesh like we had always imagined we would, Vero even played her guitar and sang like only she does, with her incredible artworks hung on the wall behind her.\\n\\n![Just coming out of the subway in Harlem. Feet hurting but feeling happy and grateful for all the magical connections of the day. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tWjwaQpzgCHtAnDJ830M6.jpg?height=1439&width=1170)\\n\\nI used this quiet night time at Vero’s apartment to rest from my travels and from the day’s many activities. I also spent some time planning my schedule of events for day 3 of the trip. Just happy to be out of the cold and to have made it back to home base on the subway without getting lost in the city or my phone dying. \\n\\n*Cover Photo by Vero Perez on the rooftop of noonlightstudio.com*\\n\\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/106393](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/106393)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639535916,\"title\":\"Creatress Collective .003 |NFT.NYC Recap| Day 1 & 2\"},\"digest\":\"F_TZDYWMpuT-ZoWFYEXlQt14rJ5PhY9wEe3STludjT4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xf0cbC46c2a6e41f81f0ef4b351e8198d2fEa6912\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fe36Rw9BW1Mg6-QTylRknykv_PXLNGEwAhDd7pFnKcE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"aWuJf22OtkumXYAIU2hFZUn2a9J6ebkhrkOQAbz3Ick\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ZDhB55Wx_tgPYZTyNb0WB1YeC38dEjq4tp3v38KRiMF83_aODiwkCHpUTWVRWtf6sspdcjDbxQ4ZTWYfE_ih3w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x35847b0ef09a0fda9b0f7b6de5342e41926820b93ac94f63ed44e31cc905437216bfec57ec6a443b0c40daa0c1f754db21650607b5f6d8dbd5192689495d29fa1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fe36Rw9BW1Mg6-QTylRknykv_PXLNGEwAhDd7pFnKcE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"aWuJf22OtkumXYAIU2hFZUn2a9J6ebkhrkOQAbz3Ick\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"asIADaVu9DRWVl3RP_w_-5Zx4ogRSdj5bndUxlzhTXc\"}"
