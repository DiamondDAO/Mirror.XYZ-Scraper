"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Edit: $CLUB is live. Claim here: [claim.seedclub.xyz](https://claim.seedclub.xyz/)\\n\\nWhat happens when you bring together mission-driven builders with a network of web3 leaders?\\n\\n**You get Seed Club.**\\n\\nSeed Club is an incubator for web3 communities.\\n\\nStarted as a DAO, Seed Club is a growing family of creators, mentors and operators building the future of community. It is responsible for many of the leading social initiatives you see today, and is quickly becoming a braintrust for those driving a new wave of community-focused adoption.\\n\\nSince its inception less than a year ago, Seed Club has successfully completed three accelerator cohorts.\\n\\nIt’s been backed by leading builders and supporters in web3, and is now home to a podcast and the mCLUB DAO.\\n\\nAs Seed Club continues to expand its reach, it’s time for the next chapter of growth.\\n\\n**Seed Club is fully governed and operated by the community - all thanks to the $CLUB token.**\\n\\nHere’s an overview of Seed Club, and how you can get involved.\\n\\n## Seed Club Model\\n\\nSeed Club operates in cohorts.\\n\\nCohorts are group sessions for project leaders to go through weekly workshops regarding best practices for building in web3. Cohorts feature presentations from industry leaders and offer a chance for founders to tap into resources on how to go from 0 to 1 on launching a community token.\\n\\nSeed Club will host \\\\~4 cohorts per year. Each cohort features \\\\~15 projects, all coming together over 6-8 week periods with the sole goal of bringing tokenized communities to life.\\n\\n**For participating in a cohort, projects join the Seed Club ecosystem and swap their tokens with $CLUB - stored in a Community Treasury.**\\n\\nAs the number of tokenized communities grows, it’s time for Seed Club to lead that conversation.\\n\\n## Introducing $CLUB\\n\\nNext week, Seed Club will release its membership token - $CLUB.\\n\\n**The official contract address will be updated here when live.**\\n\\nPlease triple check that you are interacting with the correct $CLUB token. There are previous versions of $CLUB and there are more than likely to be scammers eager to harvest the seeds of your labor.\\n\\nThe distribution of $CLUB is as follows:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qcWnngG-guc4suXBKWwCp.jpg?height=1800&width=1800)\\n\\nMore detail on how the community treasury is broken down is included in a later section.\\n\\n### CLUBdrop\\n\\nAllocated to on-chain supporters of Seed Club.\\n\\nAll $CLUB from the CLUBdrop (described in detail below) is fully liquid.\\n\\n### Past Cohorts\\n\\nReserved for projects who participated in Seed Club Cohorts 2 & 3.\\n\\nEach project that went through Cohort 2 or 3 has the right to claim 10,000 $CLUB - distributed at the time of launching a token and distributing 3% of its supply to the Seed Club Treasury.\\n\\nThe following 8 projects have qualified for their 10,000 $CLUB allocation at launch.\\n\\n* [Global Coin Research ($GCR)](https://twitter.com/Globalcoinrsrch)\\n* [Forefront ($FF)](https://twitter.com/forefront__)\\n* [Krause House ($KRAUS)](https://twitter.com/KrauseHouseDAO)\\n* [Creator Cabins ($CABIN)](https://twitter.com/creatorcabins)\\n* [Shiny Objects ($SHINY)](https://twitter.com/ShinyObjectSC)\\n* [Protein ($PRTN)](https://twitter.com/protein)\\n* [JUMP ($JUMP)](https://twitter.com/jumperstweeting)\\n* [Water & Music ($STREAM)](https://twitter.com/water_and_music)\\n\\nAll recipients will receive $CLUB directly to their community treasury, to be utilized as each respective community sees fit.\\n\\n### Contributors\\n\\nComposed of Team, Founding Contributors and early supporters.\\n\\nAll Contributors are subject to a 3 year vest with a 6 month cliff, starting simultaneously from the date of the CLUBdrop.\\n\\n### DAO 20\\n\\nAllocated to the top 20 contributors in the DAO ecosystem as voted by $CLUB holders.\\n\\nAll DAO 20 tokens are liquid upon distribution following the closing of the race (detailed below).\\n\\n### Community Treasury\\n\\nRetained by the DAO and subject to $CLUB governance.\\n\\nThis detailed breakdown of the community treasury reflects the current sentiment of the Seed Club team and the contributors in this working group.\\n\\nIt’s important to reiterate that the community will ultimately decide how the treasury is allocated; the goal of including this breakdown is to give the community a solid foundation to start with.\\n\\nEarly thoughts around the use of Treasury funds are as follows:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4F2aVTXSQMI4xnVxDzsVW.jpg?height=1800&width=1800)\\n\\n## Why $CLUB?\\n\\nSeed Club is a community-governed project.\\n\\nThe single biggest goal of $CLUB is to attract talent to work on Seed Club projects.\\n\\nThis means that $CLUB will be used for:\\n\\n* Onboarding\\n* Contributions\\n* Curation\\n\\nTogether, $CLUB acts as a powerful coordination mechanism to get the smartest people in the world into the same room.\\n\\n### Mentors\\n\\nFor contributors, $CLUB can be earned for value-added participation in the Seed Club ecosystem.\\n\\nWhether this is directly helping a project, giving a wider talk to a cohort or acting as a scout, $CLUB tokens act as recognition and membership for those who create value within Seed Club.\\n\\nMentors will earn $CLUB, and be eligible for ongoing distributions from the community treasury.\\n\\n### Projects\\n\\nAll projects that go through Seed Club are eligible to earn $CLUB tokens.\\n\\nThese tokens give projects a shared sense of membership with the rest of the cohort, and encourage positive sum behavior to contribute, share and create value amongst founders.\\n\\nThe amount of $CLUB earned by each project will be determined through a series of variables, shared in detail in a later post.\\n\\n### Curation\\n\\nAs the demand for Seed Club grows, so does the number of applications for each cohort.\\n\\nRather than expand the size of each cohort, $CLUB will be used as a curation mechanism to vote on which project(s) will make their way into each coming round.\\n\\nUsing Mirror’s Token Race template, $CLUB holders will vote on the selection of future cohort members.\\n\\n## How $CLUB Works\\n\\nNow this all sounds great - but how does it actually work?\\n\\nEach cohort, a fixed amount of $CLUB is allocated across mentors and projects.\\n\\nSeed Club will use a variety of web3 tools to allocate tokens across both working groups, geared at prioritizing projects which launch tokens, and mentors who add concrete value in bringing those tokens to life.\\n\\n$CLUB is the coordination mechanism for key contributors to the Seed Club ecosystem.\\n\\nSeed Club is actively working through the mechanics for these distributions. If you’re eager to contribute to this model, keep a close eye out for ways to get involved in the coming weeks.\\n\\n### $CLUBdrop\\n\\nSo you want to get in the mix?\\n\\nWell - here is your chance.\\n\\nNext week, 500,000 $CLUB (or 5% of the total supply) is being dropped to past contributors.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NRuAErY4RtPJ2_Le-ZC4j.jpg?height=1800&width=1800)\\n\\n370,000 $CLUB is allocated as follows:\\n\\n* 185,000 $CLUB - To wallets that own two of the following tokens - $FWB, $BANK, $FF, $WRITE\\n* 185,000 $CLUB - To those who have contributed to Seed Club NFT sales\\n\\nEvery address that qualified for the first bucket received a fixed allocation of $CLUB.\\n\\n***The snapshot for these contributions was taken at [block height 13430405](https://etherscan.io/block/13430405) - or October 16th, 2021.***\\n\\nEvery address that contributed to one of the following Seed Club NFT sales ([here](https://club.mirror.xyz/2jcmMIQ93KbFWvZ3xVvbcfD90qLhKBiqs8T3GMIOaQ0), [here](https://club.mirror.xyz/a5PQAwU0CuHJ90lEOmzq545nlC4qqNoTVTeHEGRrqow), and [here](https://club.mirror.xyz/dnN3Dwe-iD6jBpzkase4YLHTxYtnuFnmUbSoOfPEkjI)) earned a variable allocation split pro-rata based on the total amount of ETH contributed.\\n\\n100,000 $CLUB was allocated to 40 all-star project leads from past cohorts. These individuals went above and beyond within their cohorts, and continue to be leading proponents for Seed Club today.\\n\\n30,000 $CLUB was allocated to 40 partners who contributed to past cohorts. These individuals were the mentors, collaborators and guiding hands who helped connect dots and provide direction for cohorts and their teams.\\n\\nDetails on how to claim the CLUBdrop will be shared early next week - at which point $CLUB will be used to vote on a new initiative called the DAO 20.\\n\\n### DAO 20 Awards\\n\\nTo bring new contributors into the Seed Club ecosystem, we are allocating 25,000 $CLUB (or 0.25% of the total supply) to the top 20 participants in the DAO ecosystem.
