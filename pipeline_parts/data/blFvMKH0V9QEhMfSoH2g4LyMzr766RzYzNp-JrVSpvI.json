"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The [Wolf Game](https://wolf.game/) project is a wild ride. Since launching less than a week ago, their sheep, wolf and land sales have ranked in the Top 10 for NFT volume on OpenSea. \\n\\n![The $WOOL Factory](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GvN6MVBQKP44LEf0Iae9-.gif?height=960&width=960)\\n\\nThe premise of the game (which won’t be released until 2022) is easy to digest, sheep produce $WOOL, wolves eat sheep. Staking your animals puts them in game so they can start earning $WOOL. \\n\\nWhen sheep and wolves became available to mint, crypto Twitter and Discord was jammed with speculation. Almost immediately the game was paused, with all staked objects + $WOOL locked after the project was compromised. Since the pause, the developers made deeds for land + farmers available to mint with $WOOL. \\n\\nI’m caught up in the Wolf Game moment. I own 3 deeds and 2 farmers, which means I’m $7k+ USD into this experiment that’s unfolding in real-time. The moment could be magic, with the game becoming a sensation with lasting power (est 10% chance), hype (50% chance) or completely flop (40% chance). I’ve placed my bet. No need to be sheepish. \\n\\nWhat I learned yesterday: \\n\\n* **Bridge over troubled water**: L1 gas is silly. L2 gas is not. Before last week, I’d didn’t grasp the difference between L1 (Ethereum mainnet), L2 protocols (Polygon, OE, Celo) and other blockchains (Solona, Avalanche, Polkadot). Fast forward after a week of tinkering and it all makes sense. \\n  * [The Ultimate Guide to L2s on Ethereum](https://mirror.xyz/dcbuilder.eth/QX_ELJBQBm1Iq45ktPsz8pWLZN1C52DmEtH09boZuo0) is a good read\\n  * Future dApp projects will be built on L2 protocols. This will be a significant step forward for consumer crypto because high L1 gas fees are a blocker to broader adoption of web3. \\n  * Other blockchains seem unnecessary and smell more like a cash grab.
