"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Summary: Leader of Formal Focus. Competitive-minded and consistent Halo player since Halo 3. Xbox Live Gold member for 11+ years. Xbox Insider for 5+ years. Big Team Battle is my passion. I create gameplay opportunities through teamwork and leadership. I persevere by being mentally stronger and more mature than the opposition. The light in the dark. The point between rage and serenity.\\n\\nMy Halo Timeline: Beat Halo CE & Halo 2's Campaigns on solo Legendary (PC) before buying an Xbox 360 & Halo 3 in early 2009. Focused mainly on collecting achievements. I then discovered competitive Halo (MLG at the time) & began watching online tournaments every chance I got. Since then I've kept up with the competitive Halo esports scene closely & am a dedicated spectator/fan of many players. Due to school & a lack of close immediate support I would never compete in tournaments myself, but I've always had a strong interest in playing Halo competitively no matter the situation. For me, having fun in any multiplayer game means winning & learning how to do so in the most skillfully efficient & teamwork oriented way possible. My Halo \\\"timeline\\\" in chronological order:\\n\\nUnlocked all achievements in Halo 3 (+DLC).\\nBought Halo 3 ODST day one & unlocked all achievements acquiring Recon armor in Halo 3 (noteworthy at the time).\\nPlayed the Halo Reach Beta & hit max rank.\\nBought Halo CE Anniversary day one & unlocked all achievements.\\nBought Halo Reach day one & unlocked all achievements (+DLC). I climbed to \\\"Reclaimer\\\" rank. I had 70,000+ kills with over a 1.9 K/D. Discovered my love for Big Team Battle.\\nBought Halo 4 day one & unlocked all achievements (+DLC). Hit SR130 within two months of the game's release. I have 103,000+ kills, over a 2.3 K/D, and a 50CSR in BTB, CTF, Race, OG Slayer, ect.\\nPlayed the Halo 5 Beta & achieved Semi-Pro rank in Slayer & Breakout.\\nBought Halo MCC day one & mainly stuck to the BTB playlist. Due to the incredibly broken nature of the game I refused to get all the achievements. There is a lot I could say here. This was by far the lowest point in my experience with the Halo franchise.\\nBought Halo 5 day one & unlocked all achievements. Joined ExO Delta Gaming on 10/22/2016. Formed Formal Focus on 8/20/2020. Placed Champ #13 in BTB during the Preseason & later Champ #43 in only 24 games during the Summer 2019 Season on my alt HybridSupport76. Publicly credited on Halo Waypoint for having majorly impacting the 2019 \\\"BTB Refresh\\\" update (awarded 343 Fire Unicorn AR skin). Placed Champ in BTB on several other accounts.
