"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Start with self-abasement**\\n\\nIt was new year eve of 2017, I was invited to a party in China, my friend married western, many westerns attended the party, I am not a social person, nor could I speak English, plus never been abroad of China, from the first second I walk into the party, I already know I'm going to have an uncomfortable night. Then, got a few questions like 'how are you doing?', without answering, I turn to talk with Chinese then escape all 'English speaking' moments, play with kids under 3 years old the whole night. I got blushed, deeply inside, also feel self-abasement and shamelessness. That was my New Year's Eve of 2017.\\n\\n \\n\\n**A purposeless, different from school way study journey**\\n\\nI was a copywriter in a Chinese ad agency, almost no chance to use English at work or in my daily life, but how 2017 starts, made up my mind to learn English, not for jobs, not for anything specific.\\n\\nInitially, I followed an influencer who teaches English online. Every morning, he posts audio with three sentences on his social media, I copy them down and read them until I can memorize them. A few days later I realized the 'vocabulary problem', then download an app,  everyday swipe 100 words on it, just like how people use Tinder.\\n\\nSure not make it every day, but after a few months, I found I am getting better at reading English news.\\n\\n \\n\\n**Understand 'Sex and the City'**\\n\\nOn the way of learning English, Since almost all mainstream apps are banned in China, I download 'Fox News' which luckily survival, listen to it while preparing breakfast daily, then got to know how topics related to 'China', 'Trade war' popular in American media, even can't understand the specific details, but understand the outline of the news.\\n\\nI like to watch English TV shows as well, with Chinese subtitles for sure. Shows like  <Homeland>, <Breaking Bad>, <Modern Family>, <Better Call Saul>, etc. spend many weekends and nights with me.\\n\\nI was cleaning my apartment one afternoon when I heard Carrie and Samantha have a funny discussion in 'Sex and the City,' so I laughed without subtitles, then I knew I had made some progress in learning English.\\n\\n \\n\\n**First Time 'Use' English**  \\n\\nOn my path of learning English, I have seen different lifestyles which are completely different from my previous experiences in typically Chinese culture life.\\n\\nPeople can take a gap year after high school then decide what will they do, youth travel around the world, sleep in the hostel to see different countries, cultures, lives, a Ph.D. student also can be a club enthusiast, man can be a feminist, and people can discuss issues on a dialectical level, I have been influenced.  I set out for my first overseas trip to Ho Chi Minh City, 3376 kilometers away, 1 hour behind Beijing.\\n\\nIt was the first time I speak English for daily conversation, motorbikes Uber leaves me a deep impression, Google map navigates my whole trip, add new friends on Instagram and still keep in touch till now, Welcome to a world without VPN.\\n\\n**Language changed my life** \\n\\nSince then, I've seen more and more lifestyles, met people from different cultures, traveled as much as possible, read about places I'm curious about. Listen to different voices, know the entire picture before I judge.\\n\\nI was born in a small village in Xinjiang, China, know ABCDEFG at 13 years old, have no fancy educational background, in the stereotyped Chinese culture, I was supposed to get married at 25, have 2 kids, then that’d be it. However, glad I make myself discover more about this wonderful world through language.\\n\\n1 year ago, I decided to leave China, now have spent 3 months in Europe, diversity and freedom attracted me a lot. Open up a new chapter of life at age 32, wish I could survival see more, learn more, experience more.\",\"timestamp\":1641675414,\"title\":\"My Story With English, And How It Changed My Life\"},\"digest\":\"MaJrpKuLP0y9xczNjzrh3d9JTzKJ1ktiHUA_ldt3CP8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xc32B574fdA333a1Eb112bcA8c6D3dFe191F4F9A7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LJtkflSenArBPgqhlY2TgCvc3drYzlIOqN6RbkZbHTg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"sjXhQdxrGw4mui3keFTnBJEUVuAB2sSsDgTHXtY0R40\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"tHTDJhAa9tfZvJxbMRnwQK4_Y5Iv73QZVZDYB2dc2vYQU90YBC6TjmUC-AbYF9F_BX6F12oWm1hbN7yuGqMW8A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x11e4f1cdfe2057d7dda8c60850a7ea7daa3416cb9656c8ab42c2ddd064dd7d87740c6e728e6a4eb482eb508611dbfc79b0d04ad8efdb0fe5cf88f5011ba081b01b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LJtkflSenArBPgqhlY2TgCvc3drYzlIOqN6RbkZbHTg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"sjXhQdxrGw4mui3keFTnBJEUVuAB2sSsDgTHXtY0R40\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"MaJrpKuLP0y9xczNjzrh3d9JTzKJ1ktiHUA_ldt3CP8\"}"
