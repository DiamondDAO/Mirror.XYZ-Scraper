The necklace began as a lab, then refinery, factory, launchpad.   The Moon became a bejeweled colony, then Mars, and the 'Belt'.\\n\\nThe further and higher we went, the faster we changed.\\nThe faster the changes, the higher and further we flew.\\n\\nWhen people stopped coming back, we became many peoples.\\nWe left home, took our ways with us. All of them, including war.\\n\\nThe Necklace became a fortress, the factories made munitions.\\n\\nThe war went on, until one day, it became \\\"The Long War\\\", nobody remembers.\\n\\nThen one day, the greatest mind of the age created a new wonder. The 'Manifold', it was rumored, could change it all.\\n\\nAgainst the creator’s wishes, they made a weapon in haste.\\n\\nThere was a test, it failed in such a way that the \\\"machines\\\", the command and control AIs made to win, of both sides, met in secret. They thought the only way to \\\"win\\\", was to end the war and take over.\\n\\nThe Necklace became the first node of a new network under the \\\"machines\\\".The machines eliminated threats to their new peace.\\n\\nThe Necklace became new glittering cities floating over Earth.\\n\\nIt became a new home to new embassies, consulates, offices, gathering spaces for the cooperatives, grand displays of art, entertainment, and cultural luxuries. The Long Party began at the Necklace - the machines wanted to spread it everywhere.\\n\\nI came here to rebuild. Now I have to find something from the War. I’m not sure if I want to but I took my ways with me here too.\\n\\n[https://audius.co/net_run/control-node-dyatic-remix-contest-448523](https://audius.co/net_run/control-node-dyatic-remix-contest-448523)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/h19rOLDRIH2k6r0q0scst.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1634524926,\"title\":\"1999: 7.9 When 1,000 Nodes Grows To 100,000\"},\"digest\":\"aDFVYx1vq2zsodJUX6uZDMSWkse_m-Zro1LdsOPQksk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"-sw3pKWKJiImMnbpI4Wxgk30hpg0QHsJaz7P6_CfeVKdsgncHyz-hdOxXJj-U9hy0VD2BNqHtIRxVdOx4E3U8A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"4F4RZMx_ZyHwT0K8qEsMS4cyPEyKJ-dU-iKiBeVvU-c\"}"
