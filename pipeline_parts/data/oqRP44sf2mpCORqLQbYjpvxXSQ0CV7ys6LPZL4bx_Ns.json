"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"Thou hast done a foolish thing,\\\" he said; \\\"foolish for one placed as thou art. I am not dependent upon thee for death. Life is a thread I can break without thy help; and, if I do, what will become of thee? Men determined on death prefer it at the hands of others, for the reason that the soul which Plato giveth us is rebellious at the thought of self-destruction; that is all. If the ship be a pirate, I will escape from the world. My mind is fixed. I am a Roman. Success and honor are all in all. Yet I would have served thee; thou wouldst not. The ring was the only witness of my will available in this situation. We are both lost. I will die regretting the victory and glory wrested from me; thou wilt live to die a little later, mourning the pious duties undone because of this folly. I pity thee.\\\"\\n\\nBen-Hur saw the consequences of his act more distinctly than before, yet he did not falter.\\n\\n\\\"In the three years of my servitude, O tribune, thou wert the first to look upon me kindly. No, no! There was another.\\\" The voice dropped, the eyes became humid, and he saw plainly as if it were then before him the face of the boy who helped him to a drink by the old well at Nazareth. \\\"At least,\\\" he proceeded, \\\"thou wert the first to ask me who I was; and if, when I reached out and caught thee, blind and sinking the last time, I, too, had thought of the many ways in which thou couldst be useful to me in my wretchedness, still the act was not all selfish; this I pray you to believe. Moreover, seeing as God giveth me to know, the ends I dream of are to be wrought by fair means alone. As a thing of conscience, I would rather die with thee than be thy slayer. My mind is firmly set as thine; though thou wert to offer me all Rome, O tribune, and it belonged to thee to make the gift good, I would not kill thee. Thy Cato and Brutus were as little children compared to the Hebrew whose law a Jew must obey.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But my request. Hast--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thy command would be of more weight, and that would not move me. I have said.\\\"\\n\\nBoth became silent, waiting.\\n\\nBen-Hur looked often at the coming ship. Arrius rested with closed eyes, indifferent.\\n\\n\\\"Art thou sure she is an enemy?\\\" Ben-Hur asked.\\n\\n\\\"I think so,\\\" was the reply.\\n\\n\\\"She stops, and puts a boat over the side.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dost thou see her flag?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is there no other sign by which she may be known if Roman?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If Roman, she hath a helmet over the mast's top.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then be of cheer. I see the helmet.\\\"\\n\\nStill Arrius was not assured.\\n\\n\\\"The men in the small boat are taking in the people afloat. Pirates are not humane.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They may need rowers,\\\" Arrius replied, recurring, possibly, to times when he had made rescues for the purpose.\\n\\nBen-Hur was very watchful of the actions of the strangers.\\n\\n\\\"The ship moves off,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Whither?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Over on our right there is a galley which I take to be deserted. The new-comer heads towards it. Now she is alongside. Now she is sending men aboard.\\\"\\n\\nThen Arrius opened his eyes and threw off his calm.\\n\\n\\\"Thank thou thy God,\\\" he said to Ben-Hur, after a look at the galleys, \\\"thank thou thy God, as I do my many gods. A pirate would sink, not save, yon ship. By the act and the helmet on the mast I know a Roman. The victory is mine. Fortune hath not deserted me. We are saved. Wave thy hand--call to them--bring them quickly. I shall be duumvir, and thou! I knew thy father, and loved him. He was a prince indeed. He taught me a Jew was not a barbarian. I will take thee with me. I will make thee my son. Give thy God thanks, and call the sailors. Haste! The pursuit must be kept. Not a robber shall escape. Hasten them!\\\"\\n\\nJudah raised himself upon the plank, and waved his hand, and called with all his might; at last he drew the attention of the sailors in the small boat, and they were speedily taken up.\\n\\nArrius was received on the galley with all the honors due a hero so the favorite of Fortune. Upon a couch on the deck he heard the particulars of the conclusion of the fight. When the survivors afloat upon the water were all saved and the prize secured, he spread his flag of commandant anew, and hurried northward to rejoin the fleet and perfect the victory. In due time the fifty vessels coming down the channel closed in upon the fugitive pirates, and crushed them utterly; not one escaped. To swell the tribune's glory, twenty galleys of the enemy were captured.\\n\\nUpon his return from the cruise, Arrius had warm welcome on the mole at Misenum. The young man attending him very early attracted the attention of his friends there; and to their questions as to who he was the tribune proceeded in the most affectionate manner to tell the story of his rescue and introduce the stranger, omitting carefully all that pertained to the latter's previous history. At the end of the narrative, he called Ben-Hur to him, and said, with a hand resting affectionately upon his shoulder,\\n\\n\\\"Good friends, this is my son and heir, who, as he is to take my property--if it be the will of the gods that I leave any--shall be known to you by my name. I pray you all to love him as you love me.\\\"\\n\\nSpeedily as opportunity permitted, the adoption was formally perfected. And in such manner the brave Roman kept his faith with Ben-Hur, giving him happy introduction into the imperial world. The month succeeding Arrius's return, the armilustrium was celebrated with the utmost magnificence in the theater of Scaurus. One side of the structure was taken up with military trophies; among which by far the most conspicuous and most admired were twenty prows, complemented by their corresponding aplustra, cut bodily from as many galleys; and over them, so as to be legible to the eighty thousand spectators in the seats, was this inscription:\\n\\n\\\\---------------------------------------------- TAKEN FROM THE PIRATES IN THE GULF OF EURIPUS,                       BY                 QUINTUS ARRIUS,                    DUUMVIR. ----------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK FOURTH\\n\\n\\\"Alva.   Should the monarch prove unjust-- And, at this time--\\n\\nQueen.         Then I must wait for justice Until it come; and they are happiest far Whose consciences may calmly wait their right.\\\"                        Schiller, Don Carlos (act iv., sc. xv.)\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nThe month to which we now come is July, the year that of our Lord 29, and the place Antioch, then Queen of the East, and next to Rome the strongest, if not the most populous, city in the world.\\n\\nThere is an opinion that the extravagance and dissoluteness of the age had their origin in Rome, and spread thence throughout the empire; that the great cities but reflected the manners of their mistress on the Tiber. This may be doubted. The reaction of the conquest would seem to have been upon the morals of the conqueror. In Greece she found a spring of corruption; so also in Egypt; and the student, having exhausted the subject, will close the books assured that the flow of the demoralizing river was from the East westwardly, and that this very city of Antioch, one of the oldest seats of Assyrian power and splendor, was a principal source of the deadly stream.\\n\\nA transport galley entered the mouth of the river Orontes from the blue waters of the sea. It was in the forenoon. The heat was great, yet all on board who could avail themselves of the privilege were on deck--Ben-Hur among others.\\n\\nThe five years had brought the young Jew to perfect manhood. Though the robe of white linen in which he was attired somewhat masked his form, his appearance was unusually attractive. For an hour and more he had occupied a seat in the shade of the sail, and in that time several fellow-passengers of his own nationality had tried to engage him in conversation, but without avail. His replies to their questions had been brief, though gravely courteous, and in the Latin tongue. The purity of his speech, his cultivated manners, his reticence, served to stimulate their curiosity the more. Such as observed him closely were struck by an incongruity between his demeanor, which had the ease and grace of a patrician, and certain points of his person. Thus his arms were disproportionately long; and when, to steady himself against the motion of the vessel, he took hold of anything near by, the size of his hands and their evident power compelled remark; so the wonder who and what he was mixed continually with a wish to know the particulars of his life. In other words, his air cannot be better described than as a notice--This man has a story to tell.\\n\\nThe galley, in coming, had stopped at one of the ports of Cyprus, and picked up a Hebrew of most respectable appearance, quiet, reserved, paternal. Ben-Hur ventured to ask him some questions; the replies won his confidence, and resulted finally in an extended conversation.\\n\\nIt chanced also that as the galley from Cyprus entered the receiving bay of the Orontes, two other vessels which had been sighted out in the sea met it and passed into the river at the same time; and as they did so both the strangers threw out small flags of brightest yellow. There was much conjecture as to the meaning of the signals. At length a passenger addressed himself to the respectable Hebrew for information upon the subject.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I know the meaning of the flags,\\\" he replied; \\\"they do not signify nationality--they are merely marks of ownership.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Has the owner many ships?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He has.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You know him?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have dealt with him.\\\"\\n\\nThe passengers looked at the speaker as if requesting him to go on. Ben-Hur listened with interest.\\n\\n\\\"He lives in Antioch,\\\" the Hebrew continued, in his quiet way. \\\"That he is vastly rich has brought him into notice, and the talk about him is not always kind. There used to be in Jerusalem a prince of very ancient family named Hur.\\\"\\n\\nJudah strove to be composed, yet his heart beat quicker.\\n\\n\\\"The prince was a merchant, with a genius for business. He set on foot many enterprises, some reaching far East, others West. In the great cities he had branch houses. The one in Antioch was in charge of a man said by some to have been a family servant called Simonides, Greek in name, yet an Israelite. The master was drowned at sea. His business, however, went on, and was scarcely less prosperous. After a while misfortune overtook the family. The prince's only son, nearly grown, tried to kill the procurator Gratus in one of the streets of Jerusalem. He failed by a narrow chance, and has not since been heard of. In fact, the Roman's rage took in the whole house--not one of the name was left alive. Their palace was sealed up, and is now a rookery for pigeons; the estate was confiscated; everything that could be traced to the ownership of the Hurs was confiscated. The procurator cured his hurt with a golden salve.\\\"\\n\\nThe passengers laughed.\\n\\n\\\"You mean he kept the property,\\\" said one of them.\\n\\n\\\"They say so,\\\" the Hebrew replied; \\\"I am only telling a story as I received it. And, to go on, Simonides, who had been the prince's agent here in Antioch, opened trade in a short time on his own account, and in a space incredibly brief became the master merchant of the city. In imitation of his master, he sent caravans to India; and on the sea at present he has galleys enough to make a royal fleet. They say nothing goes amiss with him. His camels do not die, except of old age; his ships never founder; if he throw a chip into the river, it will come back to him gold.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How long has he been going on thus?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not ten years.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He must have had a good start.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, they say the procurator took only the prince's property ready at hand--his horses, cattle, houses, land, vessels, goods. The money could not be found, though there must have been vast sums of it. What became of it has been an unsolved mystery.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not to me,\\\" said a passenger, with a sneer.\\n\\n\\\"I understand you,\\\" the Hebrew answered. \\\"Others have had your idea. That it furnished old Simonides his start is a common belief. The procurator is of that opinion--or he has been--for twice in five years he has caught the merchant, and put him to torture.\\\"\\n\\nJudah griped the rope he was holding with crushing force.\\n\\n\\\"It is said,\\\" the narrator continued, \\\"that there is not a sound bone in the man's body. The last time I saw him he sat in a chair, a shapeless cripple, propped against cushions.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So tortured!\\\" exclaimed several listeners in a breath.\\n\\n\\\"Disease could not have produced such a deformity. Still the suffering made no impression upon him. All he had was his lawfully, and he was making lawful use of it--that was the most they wrung from him. Now, however, he is past persecution. He has a license to trade signed by Tiberius himself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He paid roundly for it, I warrant.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"These ships are his,\\\" the Hebrew continued, passing the remark. \\\"It is a custom among his sailors to salute each other upon meeting by throwing out yellow flags, sight of which is as much as to say, 'We have had a fortunate voyage.'\\\"\\n\\nThe story ended there.\\n\\nWhen the transport was fairly in the channel of the river, Judah spoke to the Hebrew.\\n\\n\\\"What was the name of the merchant's master?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ben-Hur, Prince of Jerusalem.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What became of the prince's family?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The boy was sent to the galleys. I may say he is dead. One year is the ordinary limit of life under that sentence. The widow and daughter have not been heard of; those who know what became of them will not speak. They died doubtless in the cells of one of the castles which spot the waysides of Judea.\\\"\\n\\nJudah walked to the pilot's quarter. So absorbed was he in thought that he scarcely noticed the shores of the river, which from sea to city were surpassingly beautiful with orchards of all the Syrian fruits and vines, clustered about villas rich as those of Neapolis. No more did he observe the vessels passing in an endless fleet, nor hear the singing and shouting of the sailors, some in labor, some in merriment. The sky was full of sunlight, lying in hazy warmth upon the land and the water; nowhere except over his life was there a shadow.\\n\\nOnce only he awoke to a momentary interest, and that was when some one pointed out the Grove of Daphne, discernible from a bend in the river.\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nWhen the city came into view, the passengers were on deck, eager that nothing of the scene might escape them. The respectable Jew already introduced to the reader was the principal spokesman.\\n\\n\\\"The river here runs to the west,\\\" he said, in the way of general answer. \\\"I remember when it washed the base of the walls; but as Roman subjects we have lived in peace, and, as always happens in such times, trade has had its will; now the whole river front is taken up with wharves and docks. Yonder\\\"--the speaker pointed southward--\\\"is Mount Casius, or, as these people love to call it, the Mountains of Orontes, looking across to its brother Amnus in the north; and between them lies the Plain of Antioch. Farther on are the Black Mountains, whence the Ducts of the Kings bring the purest water to wash the thirsty streets and people; yet they are forests in wilderness state, dense, and full of birds and beasts.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where is the lake?\\\" one asked.\\n\\n\\\"Over north there. You can take horse, if you wish to see it--or, better, a boat, for a tributary connects it with the river.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Grove of Daphne!\\\" he said, to a third inquirer. \\\"Nobody can describe it; only beware! It was begun by Apollo, and completed by him. He prefers it to Olympus. People go there for one look-- just one--and never come away. They have a saying which tells it all--'Better be a worm and feed on the mulberries of Daphne than a king's guest.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then you advise me to stay away from it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not I! Go you will. Everybody goes, cynic philosopher, virile boy, women, and priests--all go. So sure am I of what you will do that I assume to advise you. Do not take quarters in the city-- that will be loss of time; but go at once to the village in the edge of the grove. The way is through a garden, under the spray of fountains. The lovers of the god and his Penaean maid built the town; and in its porticos and paths and thousand retreats you will find characters and habits and sweets and kinds elsewhere impossible. But the wall of the city! there it is, the masterpiece of Xeraeus, the master of mural architecture.\\\"\\n\\nAll eyes followed his pointing finger.\\n\\n\\\"This part was raised by order of the first of the Seleucidae. Three hundred years have made it part of the rock it rests upon.\\\"\\n\\nThe defense justified the encomium. High, solid, and with many bold angles, it curved southwardly out of view.\\n\\n\\\"On the top there are four hundred towers, each a reservoir of water,\\\" the Hebrew continued. \\\"Look now! Over the wall, tall as it is, see in the distance two hills, which you may know as the rival crests of Sulpius. The structure on the farthest one is the citadel, garrisoned all the year round by a Roman legion. Opposite it this way rises the Temple of Jupiter, and under that the front of the legate's residence--a palace full of offices, and yet a fortress against which a mob would dash harmlessly as a south wind.\\\"\\n\\nAt this point the sailors began taking in sail, whereupon the Hebrew exclaimed, heartily, \\\"See! you who hate the sea, and you who have vows, get ready your curses and your prayers. The bridge yonder, over which the road to Seleucia is carried, marks the limit of navigation. What the ship unloads for further transit, the camel takes up there. Above the bridge begins the island upon which Calinicus built his new city, connecting it with five great viaducts so solid time has made no impression upon them, nor floods nor earthquakes. Of the main town, my friends, I have only to say you will be happier all your lives for having seen it.\\\"\\n\\nAs he concluded, the ship turned and made slowly for her wharf under the wall, bringing even more fairly to view the life with which the river at that point was possessed. Finally, the lines were thrown, the oars shipped, and the voyage was done. Then Ben-Hur sought the respectable Hebrew.\\n\\n\\\"Let me trouble you a moment before saying farewell.\\\"\\n\\nThe man bowed assent.\\n\\n\\\"Your story of the merchant has made me curious to see him. You called him Simonides?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. He is a Jew with a Greek name.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where is he to be found?\\\"\\n\\nThe acquaintance gave a sharp look before he answered,\\n\\n\\\"I may save you mortification. He is not a money-lender.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nor am I a money-borrower,\\\" said Ben-Hur, smiling at the other's shrewdness.\\n\\nThe man raised his head and considered an instant.\\n\\n\\\"One would think,\\\" he then replied, \\\"that the richest merchant in Antioch would have a house for business corresponding to his wealth; but if you would find him in the day, follow the river to yon bridge, under which he quarters in a building that looks like a buttress of the wall. Before the door there is an immense landing, always covered with cargoes come and to go. The fleet that lies moored there is his. You cannot fail to find him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I give you thanks.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The peace of our fathers go with you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And with you.\\\"\\n\\nWith that they separated.\\n\\nTwo street-porters, loaded with his baggage, received Ben-Hur's orders upon the wharf.\\n\\n\\\"To the citadel,\\\" he said; a direction which implied an official military connection.\\n\\nTwo great streets, cutting each other at right angles, divided the city into quarters. A curious and immense structure, called the Nymphaeum, arose at the foot of the one running north and south. When the porters turned south there, the new-comer, though fresh from Rome, was amazed at the magnificence of the avenue. On the right and left there were palaces, and between them extended indefinitely double colonnades of marble, leaving separate ways for footmen, beasts, and chariots; the whole under shade, and cooled by fountains of incessant flow.\\n\\nBen-Hur was not in mood to enjoy the spectacle. The story of Simonides haunted him. Arrived at the Omphalus--a monument of four arches wide as the streets, superbly illustrated, and erected to himself by Epiphanes, the eighth of the Seleucidae--he suddenly changed his mind.\\n\\n\\\"I will not go to the citadel to-night,\\\" he said to the porters. \\\"Take me to the khan nearest the bridge on the road to Seleucia.\\\"\\n\\nThe party faced about, and in good time he was deposited in a public house of primitive but ample construction, within stone's-throw of the bridge under which old Simonides had his quarters. He lay upon the house-top through the night. In his inner mind lived the thought, \\\"Now--now I will hear of home--and mother--and the dear little Tirzah. If they are on earth, I will find them.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nNext day early, to the neglect of the city, Ben-Hur sought the house of Simonides. Through an embattled gateway he passed to a continuity of wharves; thence up the river midst a busy press, to the Seleucian Bridge, under which he paused to take in the scene.\\n\\nThere, directly under the bridge, was the merchant's house, a mass of gray stone, unhewn, referable to no style, looking, as the voyager had described it, like a buttress of the wall against which it leaned. Two immense doors in front communicated with the wharf. Some holes near the top, heavily barred, served as windows. Weeds waved from the crevices, and in places black moss splotched the otherwise bald stones.\\n\\nThe doors were open. Through one of them business went in; through the other it came out; and there was hurry, hurry in all its movements.\\n\\nOn the wharf there were piles of goods in every kind of package, and groups of slaves, stripped to the waist, going about in the abandon of labor.\\n\\nBelow the bridge lay a fleet of galleys, some loading, others unloading. A yellow flag blew out from each masthead. From fleet and wharf, and from ship to ship, the bondmen of traffic passed in clamorous counter-currents.\\n\\nAbove the bridge, across the river, a wall rose from the water's edge, over which towered the fanciful cornices and turrets of an imperial palace, covering every foot of the island spoken of in the Hebrew's description. But, with all its suggestions, Ben-Hur scarcely noticed it. Now, at last, he thought to hear of his people--this, certainly, if Simonides had indeed been his father's slave. But would the man acknowledge the relation? That would be to give up his riches and the sovereignty of trade so royally witnessed on the wharf and river. And what was of still greater consequence to the merchant, it would be to forego his career in the midst of amazing success, and yield himself voluntarily once more a slave. Simple thought of the demand seemed a monstrous audacity. Stripped of diplomatic address, it was to say, You are my slave; give me all you have, and--yourself.\\n\\nYet Ben-Hur derived strength for the interview from faith in his rights and the hope uppermost in his heart. If the story to which he was yielding were true, Simonides belonged to him, with all he had. For the wealth, be it said in justice, he cared nothing. When he started to the door determined in mind, it was with a promise to himself--\\\"Let him tell me of mother and Tirzah, and I will give him his freedom without account.\\\"\\n\\nHe passed boldly into the house.\\n\\nThe interior was that of a vast depot where, in ordered spaces, and under careful arrangement, goods of every kind were heaped and pent. Though the light was murky and the air stifling, men moved about briskly; and in places he saw workmen with saws and hammers making packages for shipments. Down a path between the piles he walked slowly, wondering if the man of whose genius there were here such abounding proofs could have been his father's slave? If so, to what class had he belonged? If a Jew, was he the son of a servant? Or was he a debtor or a debtor's son? Or had he been sentenced and sold for theft? These thoughts, as they passed, in nowise disturbed the growing respect for the merchant of which he was each instant more and more conscious. A peculiarity of our admiration for another is that it is always looking for circumstances to justify itself.\\n\\nAt length a man approached and spoke to him.\\n\\n\\\"What would you have?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I would see Simonides, the merchant.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Will you come this way?\\\"\\n\\nBy a number of paths left in the stowage, they finally came to a flight of steps; ascending which, he found himself on the roof of the depot, and in front of a structure which cannot be better described than as a lesser stone house built upon another, invisible from the landing below, and out west of the bridge under the open sky. The roof, hemmed in by a low wall, seemed like a terrace, which, to his astonishment, was brilliant with flowers; in the rich surrounding, the house sat squat, a plain square block, unbroken except by a doorway in front. A dustless path led to the door, through a bordering of shrubs of Persian rose in perfect bloom. Breathing a sweet attar-perfume, he followed the guide.\\n\\nAt the end of a darkened passage within, they stopped before a curtain half parted. The man called out,\\n\\n\\\"A stranger to see the master.\\\"\\n\\nA clear voice replied, \\\"In God's name, let him enter.\\\"\\n\\nA Roman might have called the apartment into which the visitor was ushered his atrium. The walls were paneled; each panel was comparted like a modern office-desk, and each compartment crowded with labelled folios all filemot with age and use. Between the panels, and above and below them, were borders of wood once white, now tinted like cream, and carved with marvellous intricacy of design. Above a cornice of gilded balls, the ceiling rose in pavilion style until it broke into a shallow dome set with hundreds of panes of violet mica, permitting a flood of light deliciously reposeful. The floor was carpeted with gray rugs so thick that an invading foot fell half buried and soundless.\\n\\nIn the midlight of the room were two persons--a man resting in a chair high-backed, broad-armed, and lined with pliant cushions; and at his left, leaning against the back of the chair, a girl well forward into womanhood. At sight of them Ben-Hur felt the blood redden his forehead; bowing, as much to recover himself as in respect, he lost the lifting of the hands, and the shiver and shrink with which the sitter caught sight of him--an emotion as swift to go as it had been to come. When he raised his eyes the two were in the same position, except the girl's hand had fallen and was resting lightly upon the elder's shoulder; both of them were regarding him fixedly.\\n\\n\\\"If you are Simonides, the merchant, and a Jew\\\"--Ben-Hur stopped an instant--\\\"then the peace of the God of our father Abraham upon you and--yours.\\\"\\n\\nThe last word was addressed to the girl.\\n\\n\\\"I am the Simonides of whom you speak, by birthright a Jew,\\\" the man made answer, in a voice singularly clear. \\\"I am Simonides, and a Jew; and I return you your salutation, with prayer to know who calls upon me.\\\"\\n\\nBen-Hur looked as he listened, and where the figure of the man should have been in healthful roundness, there was only a formless heap sunk in the depths of the cushions, and covered by a quilted robe of sombre silk. Over the heap shone a head royally proportioned--the ideal head of a statesman and conqueror--a head broad of base and domelike in front, such as Angelo would have modelled for Caesar. White hair dropped in thin locks over the white brows, deepening the blackness of the eyes shining through them like sullen lights. The face was bloodless, and much puffed with folds, especially under the chin. In other words, the head and face were those of a man who might move the world more readily than the world could move him--a man to be twice twelve times tortured into the shapeless cripple he was, without a groan, much less a confession; a man to yield his life, but never a purpose or a point; a man born in armor, and assailable only through his loves. To him Ben-Hur stretched his hands, open and palm up, as he would offer peace at the same time he asked it.\\n\\n\\\"I am Judah, son of Ithamar, late head of the House of Hur, and a prince of Jerusalem.\\\"\\n\\nThe merchant's right hand lay outside the robe--a long, thin hand, articulate to deformity with suffering. It closed tightly; otherwise there was not the slightest expression of feeling of any kind on his part; nothing to warrant an inference of surprise or interest; nothing but this calm answer,\\n\\n\\\"The princes of Jerusalem, of the pure blood, are always welcome in my house; you are welcome. Give the young man a seat, Esther.\\\"\\n\\nThe girl took an ottoman near by, and carried it to Ben-Hur. As she arose from placing the seat, their eyes met.\\n\\n\\\"The peace of our Lord with you,\\\" she said, modestly. \\\"Be seated and at rest.\\\"\\n\\nWhen she resumed her place by the chair, she had not divined his purpose. The powers of woman go not so far: if the matter is of finer feeling, such as pity, mercy, sympathy, that she detects; and therein is a difference between her and man which will endure as long as she remains, by nature, alive to such feelings. She was simply sure he brought some wound of life for healing.\\n\\nBen-Hur did not take the offered seat, but said, deferentially, \\\"I pray the good master Simonides that he will not hold me an intruder. Coming up the river yesterday, I heard he knew my father.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I knew the Prince Hur. We were associated in some enterprises lawful to merchants who find profit in lands beyond the sea and the desert. But sit, I pray you--and, Esther, some wine for the young man. Nehemiah speaks of a son of Hur who once ruled the half part of Jerusalem; an old house; very old, by the faith! In the days of Moses and Joshua even some of them found favor in the sight of the Lord, and divided honors with those princes among men. It can hardly be that their descendant, lineally come to us, will refuse a cup of wine-fat of the genuine vine of Sorek, grown on the south hill-sides of Hebron.\\\"\\n\\nBy the time of the conclusion of this speech, Esther was before Ben-Hur with a silver cup filled from a vase upon a table a little removed from the chair. She offered the drink with downcast face. He touched her hand gently to put it away. Again their eyes met; whereat he noticed that she was small, not nearly to his shoulder in height; but very graceful, and fair and sweet of face, with eyes black and inexpressibly soft. She is kind and pretty, he thought, and looks as Tirzah would were she living. Poor Tirzah! Then he said aloud,\\n\\n\\\"No, thy father--if he is thy father?\\\"--he paused.\\n\\n\\\"I am Esther, the daughter of Simonides,\\\" she said, with dignity.\\n\\n\\\"Then, fair Esther, thy father, when he has heard my further speech, will not think worse of me if yet I am slow to take his wine of famous extract; nor less I hope not to lose grace in thy sight. Stand thou here with me a moment!\\\"\\n\\nBoth of them, as in common cause, turned to the merchant. \\\"Simonides!\\\" he said, firmly, \\\"my father, at his death, had a trusted servant of thy name, and it has been told me that thou art the man!\\\"\\n\\nThere was a sudden start of the wrenched limbs under the robe, and the thin hand clenched.\\n\\n\\\"Esther, Esther!\\\" the man called, sternly; \\\"here, not there, as thou art thy mother's child and mine--here, not there, I say!\\\"\\n\\nThe girl looked once from father to visitor; then she replaced the cup upon the table, and went dutifully to the chair. Her countenance sufficiently expressed her wonder and alarm.\\n\\nSimonides lifted his left hand, and gave it into hers, lying lovingly upon his shoulder, and said, dispassionately, \\\"I have grown old in dealing with men--old before my time. If he who told thee that whereof thou speakest was a friend acquainted with my history, and spoke of it not harshly, he must have persuaded thee that I could not be else than a man distrustful of my kind. The God of Israel help him who, at the end of life, is constrained to acknowledge so much! My loves are few, but they are. One of them is a soul which\\\"--he carried the hand holding his to his lips, in manner unmistakable--\\\"a soul which to this time has been unselfishly mine, and such sweet comfort that, were it taken from me, I would die.\\\"\\n\\nEsther's head drooped until her cheek touched his.\\n\\n\\\"The other love is but a memory; of which I will say further that, like a benison of the Lord, it hath a compass to contain a whole family, if only\\\"--his voice lowered and trembled--\\\"if only I knew where they were.\\\"\\n\\nBen-Hur's face suffused, and, advancing a step, he cried, impulsively, \\\"My mother and sister! Oh, it is of them you speak!\\\"\\n\\nEsther, as if spoken to, raised her head; but Simonides returned to his calm, and answered, coldly, \\\"Hear me to the end. Because I am that I am, and because of the loves of which I have spoken, before I make return to thy demand touching my relations to the Prince Hur, and as something which of right should come first, do thou show me proofs of who thou art. Is thy witness in writing? Or cometh it in person?\\\"\\n\\nThe demand was plain, and the right of it indisputable. Ben-Hur blushed, clasped his hands, stammered, and turned away at loss. Simonides pressed him.\\n\\n\\\"The proofs, the proofs, I say! Set them before me--lay them in my hands!\\\"\\n\\nYet Ben-Hur had no answer. He had not anticipated the requirement; and, now that it was made, to him as never before came the awful fact that the three years in the galley had carried away all the proofs of his identity; mother and sister gone, he did not live in the knowledge of any human being. Many there were acquainted with him, but that was all. Had Quintus Arrius been present, what could he have said more than where he found him, and that he believed the pretender to be the son of Hur? But, as will presently appear in full, the brave Roman sailor was dead. Judah had felt the loneliness before; to the core of life the sense struck him now. He stood, hands clasped, face averted, in stupefaction. Simonides respected his suffering, and waited in silence.\\n\\n\\\"Master Simonides,\\\" he said, at length, \\\"I can only tell my story; and I will not that unless you stay judgment so long, and with good-will deign to hear me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Speak,\\\" said Simonides, now, indeed, master of the situation--\\\"speak, and I will listen the more willingly that I have not denied you to be the very person you claim yourself.\\\"\\n\\nBen-Hur proceeded then, and told his life hurriedly, yet with the feeling which is the source of all eloquence; but as we are familiar with it down to his landing at Misenum, in company with Arrius, returned victorious from the AEgean, at that point we will take up the words.\\n\\n\\\"My benefactor was loved and trusted by the emperor, who heaped him with honorable rewards. The merchants of the East contributed magnificent presents, and he became doubly rich among the rich of Rome. May a Jew forget his religion? or his birthplace, if it were the Holy Land of our fathers? The good man adopted me his son by formal rites of law; and I strove to make him just return: no child was ever more dutiful to father than I to him. He would have had me a scholar; in art, philosophy, rhetoric, oratory, he would have furnished me the most famous teacher. I declined his insistence, because I was a Jew, and could not forget the Lord God, or the glory of the prophets, or the city set on the hills by David and Solomon. Oh, ask you why I accepted any of the benefactions of the Roman? I loved him; next place, I thought with his help, array influences which would enable me one day to unseal the mystery close-locking the fate of my mother and sister; and to these there was yet another motive of which I shall not speak except to say it controlled me so far that I devoted myself to arms, and the acquisition of everything deemed essential to thorough knowledge of the art of war. In the palaestrae and circuses of the city I toiled, and in the camps no less; and in all of them I have a name, but not that of my fathers. The crowns I won--and on the walls of the villa by Misenum there are many of them--all came to me as the son of Arrius, the duumvir. In that relation only am I known among Romans. . . . In steadfast pursuit of my secret aim, I left Rome for Antioch, intending to accompany the Consul Maxentius in the campaign he is organizing against the Parthians. Master of personal skill in all arms, I seek now the higher knowledge pertaining to the conduct of bodies of men in the field. The consul has admitted me one of his military family. But yesterday, as our ship entered the Orontes, two other ships sailed in with us flying yellow flags. A fellow-passenger and countryman from Cyprus explained that the vessels belonged to Simonides, the master-merchant of Antioch; he told us, also, who the merchant was; his marvellous success in commerce; of his fleets and caravans, and their coming and going; and, not knowing I had interest in the theme beyond my associate listeners, he said Simonides was a Jew, once the servant of the Prince Hur; nor did he conceal the cruelties of Gratus, or the purpose of their infliction.\\\"\\n\\nAt this allusion Simonides bowed his head, and, as if to help him conceal his feelings and her own deep sympathy, the daughter hid her face on his neck. Directly he raised his eyes, and said, in a clear voice, \\\"I am listening.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"O good Simonides!\\\" Ben-Hur then said, advancing a step, his whole soul seeking expression, \\\"I see thou art not convinced, and that yet I stand in the shadow of thy distrust.\\\"\\n\\nThe merchant held his features fixed as marble, and his tongue as still.\\n\\n\\\"And not less clearly, I see the difficulties of my position,\\\" Ben-Hur continued. \\\"All my Roman connection I can prove; I have only to call upon the consul, now the guest of the governor of the city; but I cannot prove the particulars of thy demand upon me. I cannot prove I am my father's son. They who could serve me in that--alas! they are dead or lost.\\\"\\n\\nHe covered his face with his hands; whereupon Esther arose, and, taking the rejected cup to him, said, \\\"The wine is of the country we all so love. Drink, I pray thee!\\\"\\n\\nThe voice was sweet as that of Rebekah offering drink at the well near Nahor the city; he saw there were tears in her eyes, and he drank, saying, \\\"Daughter of Simonides, thy heart is full of goodness; and merciful art thou to let the stranger share it with thy father. Be thou blessed of our God! I thank thee.\\\"\\n\\nThen he addressed himself to the merchant again:\\n\\n\\\"As I have no proof that I am my father's son, I will withdraw that I demanded of thee, O Simonides, and go hence to trouble you no more; only let me say I did not seek thy return to servitude nor account of thy fortune; in any event, I would have said, as now I say, that all which is product of thy labor and genius is thine; keep it in welcome. I have no need of any part thereof. When the good Quintus, my second father, sailed on the voyage which was his last, he left me his heir, princely rich. If, therefore, thou cost think of me again, be it with remembrance of this question, which, as I do swear by the prophets and Jehovah, thy God and mine, was the chief purpose of my coming here: What cost thou know--what canst thou tell me--of my mother and Tirzah, my sister--she who should be in beauty and grace even as this one, thy sweetness of life, if not thy very life? Oh! what canst thou tell me of them?\\\"\\n\\nThe tears ran down Esther's cheeks; but the man was wilful: in a clear voice, he replied,\\n\\n\\\"I have said I knew the Prince Ben-Hur. I remember hearing of the misfortune which overtook his family. I remember the bitterness with which I heard it. He who wrought such misery to the widow of my friend is the same who, in the same spirit, hath since wrought upon me. I will go further, and say to you, I have made diligent quest concerning the family, but--I have nothing to tell you of them. They are lost.\\\"\\n\\nBen-Hur uttered a great groan.\\n\\n\\\"Then--then it is another hope broken!\\\" he said, struggling with his feelings. \\\"I am used to disappointments. I pray you pardon my intrusion; and if I have occasioned you annoyance, forgive it because of my sorrow. I have nothing now to live for but vengeance. Farewell.\\\"\\n\\nAt the curtain he turned, and said, simply, \\\"I thank you both.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Peace go with you,\\\" the merchant said.\\n\\nEsther could not speak for sobbing.\\n\\nAnd so he departed.\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nScarcely was Ben-Hur gone, when Simonides seemed to wake as from sleep: his countenance flushed; the sullen light of his eyes changed to brightness; and he said, cheerily,\\n\\n\\\"Esther, ring--quick!\\\"\\n\\nShe went to the table, and rang a service-bell.\\n\\nOne of the panels in the wall swung back, exposing a doorway which gave admittance to a man who passed round to the merchant's front, and saluted him with a half-salaam.\\n\\n\\\"Malluch, here--nearer--to the chair,\\\" the master said, imperiously. \\\"I have a mission which shall not fail though the sun should. Hearken! A young man is now descending to the store-room--tall, comely, and in the garb of Israel; follow him, his shadow not more faithful; and every night send me report of where he is, what he does, and the company he keeps; and if, without discovery, you overhear his conversations, report them word for word, together with whatever will serve to expose him, his habits, motives, life. Understand you? Go quickly! Stay, Malluch: if he leave the city, go after him--and, mark you, Malluch, be as a friend. If he bespeak you, tell him what you will to the occasion most suited, except that you are in my service, of that, not a word. Haste--make haste!\\\"\\n\\nThe man saluted as before, and was gone.\\n\\nThen Simonides rubbed his wan hands together, and laughed.\\n\\n\\\"What is the day, daughter?\\\" he said, in the midst of the mood. \\\"What is the day? I wish to remember it for happiness come. See, and look for it laughing, and laughing tell me, Esther.\\\"\\n\\nThe merriment seemed unnatural to her; and, as if to entreat him from it, she answered, sorrowfully, \\\"Woe's me, father, that I should ever forget this day!\\\"\\n\\nHis hands fell down the instant, and his chin, dropping upon his breast, lost itself in the muffling folds of flesh composing his lower face.\\n\\n\\\"True, most true, my daughter!\\\" he said, without looking up. \\\"This is the twentieth day of the fourth month. To-day, five years ago, my Rachel, thy mother, fell down and died. They brought me home broken as thou seest me, and we found her dead of grief. Oh, to me she was a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of En-Gedi! I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey. We laid her away in a lonely place--in a tomb cut in the mountain; no one near her. Yet in the darkness she left me a little light, which the years have increased to a brightness of morning.\\\" He raised his hand and rested it upon his daughter's head. \\\"Dear Lord, I thank thee that now in my Esther my lost Rachel liveth again!\\\"\\n\\nDirectly he lifted his head, and said, as with a sudden thought, \\\"Is it not clear day outside?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It was, when the young man came in.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1640142726,\"title\":\"He tossed the ring away.
