"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**1648 Münster and Osnabrück, Holy Roman Empire**\\n\\nIt seemed endless, decades of war which killed millions, but the Peace of Westphalia came. A Dutch Republic was free of the Spanish Empire. By the time the treaties were signed, the rebel provinces were a world power.\\n\\nThe Dutch Golden Age was a miracle.\\n\\nThe world’s first stock exchange, first global corporation, an early central bank, and windmill powered shipbuilding, while the ports’ geographic sweet spot captured half of European shipping. International law and early interplanetary discoveries had a place in this age. A long war had given way to a great peace.\\n\\nThere was an explosion in ART.\\n\\nVirtual Reality in oil paints. Over 1.3 million paintings in the mid-1600s. There was wheeling and dealing but not everyone won. Despite the peace and prosperity, artists like Vermeer and Rembrandt couldn’t always escape poverty.\\n\\nEven in a golden age, not everyone gets the gold.\\n\\n**2911, Mars**\\n\\nElena Firmina May was terrified.\\n\\nFresh off the transport from Jupiter, she sat in the waiting room, waiting for her host. The nanos she was given during the flight were too slow in helping her adjust to the gravity on an inner world. She tried not to stare at all the different looking humans, with different accents.\\n\\n“I wish I was home.” She almost said it out-loud.\\n\\nShe didn’t feel like the “next greatest” thing to come out of Jupiter - a renderer, a creator of “expees”, experiences. An exotic Jovian who caught the eyes of Inner World dealers and promoters, ready to promote the “next great” artist who could create for billions of people.\\n\\nThe Long War was over for years but the System’s people were hungry for fun, art and escape.\\n\\n“Elena, there you are! My new “1 of 1”, my new star!”\\n\\nElena turned to face a woman cloaked in the latest augmented designware from Earth. She put on a smile, and stood up, sure that she was steady against gravity. She tripped over her bag and fell on her well-dressed host.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/efu5x8aWti6WuLZY1AG1l.png?height=2400&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633830401,\"title\":\"1648: 4.1 A Golden Age Begins, 2911\"},\"digest\":\"SEYiHuw0-0_UWV1wBFR64v_SHrrCGuawqItEff1Zqis\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ifJ4Kcb6wQ7j3Ebzum7W1SJpbez4cLep_V4imqmIT0cknfGjy0Bu9l7IKOx1taYX0EAhRu0HpjNUCV1KZKsmxA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"hfTfbqXoPYwKV9MABce1f5R12kucc4nY-09H9VO45OE\"}"
