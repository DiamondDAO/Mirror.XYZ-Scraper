"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"```\\n \\n```\\n\\nJune 22, 2005.. I bought a 525 ml bottle of Vaseline(a brand of lotion.) Extra Strength lotion. It was on sale, just 3 bucks, like RMB 20 kuai. That was a really good deal. I can use it for 365 days. Saving is my premier job, coz Im not rich and also couldn’t buy luxury products. One of my friends who is in Australia only love Louis Vuitton( a luxury brand of leather products from France) Last time, she sent me some pictures about her Louis Vuitton collection. It was huge! Everything of hers is Louis Vuitton, even her underwears.( Does Louis Vuitton produce UNDERWEAR?) She probably bought a Nissan(a car brand from Japan.) 350z. Wow! I love that car very much, but I can’t afford it. When we were in the same senior high school, she told her friends she liked me, but she never said it to me. When I knew it, she is already living in Australia. We chat sometimes on MSN(a message software which is extensively used all over the world), but we are just common friends. Speak it like it is, I was never in love with her, coz I didn’t have that feeling. Maybe she was seeing me, but I was not. Yesterday, I mentioned about a Korean girl. She was rich as well. She has a BMW X5 and…… I think that car is enough to prove everything. How come those girls who liked me are much richer than me? Im poor and still suffer the poverty. When these 2 girls are eating delicious food, I m eating instant noodle soup. When they are driving on the road elatedly, Im walking to university. I really wanna find a poor girl to be my galfriend, coz I could also find the balance. My ex-girlfriend is living in Japan. She is ok, not that rich. Sometimes, we talk online, and she still calls me SWEETIE and regards me as her husband. I can see through she wants to get back our relationship. Ha, that is okay. But it doesn’t make any sense. She won’t come to Canada for me. She has a good job and family there. That was why I did not want her to tag along with me and stick with me. We are hopeless although our love lasted almost 4 years. I just wanna get over it! Now Im a 100% single man. I live by myself. Everyday I keep being busy. I do believe that sometimes girl is nothing but troubles. Today, I bought a new tee, the words printed on the shirt are “Canadian Girls Drinking Team”, I just felt it was interesting and bought it. Maybe some of my friends see it, they probably scream “are you gonna change your sex and join that team, man? You look weird and freak! ” Ha, who cares!\\n　　I just tried to use very very basic and easy words here in order to make each sentence more understandable and clean out any vocabulary blocks. I just hope you enjoy it and keep reading it day by day. Today, my test was fabulous! Tomorrow there is another one. Im gonna prepare it.
