"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"On the sidelines of an international gathering in Costa Rica earlier this year, Secretary of State Antony Blinken tried to make headway with the foreign minister of a government that is increasingly dictatorial and hostile to the United States.\\n\\nWas that government willing to rethink its repressive moves? Would it allow a free and fair election later this year? Could Washington send an emissary to talk? Blinken nudged his counterpart in an encounter that lasted roughly 10 minutes, a senior State Department official said. But the foreign minister was non-committal, at best, when he wasn’t sticking to meaningless talking points.\\n\\nBlinken’s diplomatic foray didn’t turn out the way he’d hoped. In fact, the United States’ relationship with Nicaragua almost immediately turned much, much worse.\\n\\nDuring the next two months, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega dramatically escalated a crackdown on people he and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, deemed a threat to their continued rule of 14 years and counting. By mid-August, Ortega and Murillo had detained at least seven potential presidential rivals and barred the genuine opposition parties from participating in the Nov. 7 presidential election — [effectively wiping away any real competition](https://www.state.gov/the-lack-of-prospects-for-free-and-fair-election-in-nicaragua/). They’ve also detained or otherwise threatened dozens more human rights activists, business leaders, students, journalists and others in the Central American country of 6.5 million.\\n\\nThe repression is among the most intense a Western Hemisphere country has experienced in decades. Ortega and Murillo have a long and bloody history in Nicaraguan politics — one dotted with references to witchcraft, imperialism, erotica and Ronald Reagan. But now, U.S. officials and prominent Nicaraguans say, they appear to be taking things to a new level, imposing a police state with the goal of bringing about dynastic rule to the country.\\n\\nThe pair are defying Washington’s warnings, sanctions and visa bans, ignoring the objections of other neighboring states, and aligning themselves more with Moscow as they peddle what one U.S. official described as a religiously infused “magical realism” to Nicaraguan citizens. The two have even drawn an outcry from Hollywood by detaining the father of the creator of the hit TV show “Riverdale.”\\n\\nThe turmoil in Nicaragua has been overshadowed by events in nearby Venezuela, Haiti and Cuba, not to mention other parts of the world. But the tiny country in its own way has come to epitomize two of the key challenges that President Joe Biden says the world’s democracies cannot ignore: the rise of authoritarianism and the spread of corruption. If November’s election goes the way Ortega and Murillo have scripted it, it could also deepen the hemisphere’s migration crisis.\\n\\n[IMMIGRATION](https://www.politico.com/news/immigration)\\n\\n## It’s not just Republicans. Everyone’s mad at Biden over migration.\\n\\nBY [SABRINA RODRIGUEZ](https://www.politico.com/staff/sabrina-rodriguez)\\n\\nBiden aides say they are working with regional partners and cranking up the pressure on the regime in Managua. But U.S. lawmakers from both parties, as well as other voices, say the Biden administration must do more, quickly, to reverse the trend in Nicaragua.\\n\\n“It’s basically become a dictatorship because of the jailing of political opposition and stomping out of any political other side,” said Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas). “There has to be a strong message to the Nicaraguan government that the United States and the region soundly reject that dictatorial situation.”\\n\\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) added in a statement: “The Biden administration must hold this undemocratic regime — which continues to censor the press and imprison its political opponents — accountable for its crimes.”\\n\\n### ‘Very grave and very disturbing’\\n\\nThe speed and scope of this summer’s Nicaraguan crackdown has startled even veteran observers of Latin America. But the country’s democracy has been eroding for quite some time, thanks largely to the machinations of Ortega and Murillo.\\n\\nBoth once fought autocracy in their country. As members of the Sandinista rebel movement, they helped topple the dynastic dictatorship of Nicaragua’s Somoza family. Ortega served as president during the second half of the 1980s, butting heads through that decade with Reagan, who loathed the Sandinistas’ pro-communist views and deputized the CIA to undermine Ortega’s rule by arming rebels known as the Contras.\\n\\nOrtega was voted out in 1990, just as the Cold War was drawing to an end and his patrons in the Soviet Union were watching their empire crumble. But he kept trying to regain the presidency, eventually winning in 2006. He’s held on to the office ever since through [increasingly questionable maneuvers](https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/peace/americas/nicaragua_2011_report_post.pdf), including changes to the constitution. Ortega and his wife’s regime, in [the words of one U.S. official](https://usoas.usmission.gov/oas-resolution-condemns-ortega-regime-in-nicaragua/), “controls all centers of power in Nicaragua including the Executive, the Legislature, the Judiciary, and the Supreme Electoral Council.”\\n\\nOrtega and Murillo have come a long way from the Sandinistas’ socialist ideals. They have embraced elements of capitalism and benefited richly from it. The family is believed to control significant chunks of the country’s economy, including in the media and energy sectors. And they’re not afraid to use violence to protect their hold on power. In 2018, Ortega used official security forces as well as pro-government paramilitary groups to crush massive anti-governments protests; at least 300 people died and more than 100,000 Nicaraguans have fled the country since that crackdown.\\n\\nOrtega’s wife is, by most accounts, highly influential and in charge of many day-to-day decisions. He’s something of a recluse who, nonetheless, still enjoys railing against American imperialism. She is the more colorful public face of their regime, and her interests over the years have [reportedly included witchcraft](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1990-01-30-9001210869-story.html) and[ erotic poetry](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nicaragua-wife/nicaraguans-see-first-lady-as-power-behind-throne-idUKN2632184220070129). Murillo delivers near-daily remarks to the country via multiple media platforms, and she has literally changed the landscape through public art and other projects often bathed in soft colors like yellow and pink.\\n\\nMurillo already was a powerful first lady and the government spokesperson before Ortega [put her on the ballot](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/31/world/americas/nicaragua-daniel-ortega-rosario-murillo-house-of-cards.html) as his No. 2 in 2016. A senior Biden administration official declined to say which member of the power couple holds the real authority. The official stressed, however, that this summer’s crackdown on the opposition was a “very grave and very disturbing” development, and that it “fundamentally alters” how Nicaragua’s leadership should be viewed.\\n\\n## MOST READ\\n\\n1.

He responded by emailing a lengthy statement defending the Nicaraguan system while denouncing U.S. “aggressions” that “constitute crimes against humanity.”\\n\\n“The People of Nicaragua are not asking for permission to exercise their Right to National Sovereignty, Independence and Self-determination. That Right was conquered with blood, sweat and tears and with the memory of hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguan Sisters and Brothers,” the statement declared.\\n\\nBut as repression has intensified and it’s become clear that [November’s elections](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210925-nicaragua-s-presidential-campaign-kicks-off-with-no-rivals) won’t offer voters a real choice, the climate inside Nicaragua is akin to a “state of terror,” prominent Nicaraguan journalist Carlos Fernando Chamorro said.\\n\\nChamorro is the director of the [news organization Confidencial](https://www.confidencial.com.ni/) and he himself faces criminal charges from the regime. His sister, Cristiana Chamorro, is one of the targeted potential presidential candidates and is under house arrest. Their brother Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, a politician and activist, has been imprisoned.\\n\\nCarlos Fernando Chamorro, who is in exile in Costa Rica, said that on the surface in Nicaragua, it appears that “life goes on,” but that’s just a façade. “People have their so-called normal lives under this police state, under a state of repression,” he said in a phone interview. “People cannot express themselves.”\\n\\nA second senior Biden administration official described the situation as feeling “like the walls are closing in and space is being closed off.” The official added, “I get the sense that a lot of Nicaraguans have sort of lost hope for the medium term.”\\n\\n### ‘They have their own lawyers’\\n\\nAlmost from the start of Biden’s tenure, his administration has denounced or otherwise made moves against Nicaragua. On Feb. 8, State Department spokesperson [Ned Price warned](https://www.state.gov/nicaraguas-foreign-agents-law-drives-nicaragua-toward-dictatorship-silencing-independent-voices/) that “Ortega is driving Nicaragua toward dictatorship” as the Nicaraguan leader shut down civil society groups under a law targeting “foreign agents.”\\n\\nA week after Blinken’s effort at diplomacy in Costa Rica, the Biden administration announced it was [levying economic sanctions on several Nicaraguans](https://www.state.gov/announcing-sanctions-on-the-ortega-regime-in-response-to-arbitrary-detentions-and-other-undemocratic-moves/), including one of Ortega and Murillo’s children. In the weeks since, the United States has also imposed at least [two major rounds](https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-restricts-visas-of-50-additional-nicaraguan-individuals-affiliated-with-ortega-murillo-regime/) of visa bans, [targeting at least 150 Nicaraguans](https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-restricts-visas-of-100-nicaraguans-affiliated-with-ortega-murillo-regime/) linked to the country’s National Assembly and its judicial system.
