"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Argent, the company behind one of the only smart contract wallets with social recovery for Ethereum, has previously announced plans to [partner with and deploy on zkSync’s Layer2](https://www.argent.xyz/blog/layer-2-plans/). It now appears that Argent may be experimenting with StarkNet’s Layer2 as seen by a new repo title [argent-contracts-starknet](https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-contracts-starknet) in [Argent Labs’ github](https://github.com/argentlabs) organization. Co-founder and Chief Science Officer at Argent, Julien Niset, has made [all the commits](https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-contracts-starknet/commits/main) to the repo. The description for the repo states:\\n\\n> “Preliminary work for an Argent Account on Starknet.”\\n\\n![Starkware's StarkNet roadmap](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/X8Cw18E0ZEIQ_A_TdI7E0.png?height=350&width=700)\\n\\nStarkNet and zkSync are among the most prominent and promising solutions for scaling Ethereum. Both solutions use zkRollups which offer much more scaling and privacy that other rollups and layer 2s that utilize optimistic rollups. Both have plans to land new versions with more capabilities on mainnet in the coming months.\\n\\nVitalik has [mentioned the importance of social recovery](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html) for wallets and need to move away from seed phrases to on-board mainstream users to the decentralized world and Argent remains at the forefront of this effort.\\n\\n![Layer2 planned features from Argent](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vt9qTU1b1gS0dcCUT63uO.png?height=812&width=799)\\n\\nArgent is currently running a sweepstakes promoting their Layer2 launch.
