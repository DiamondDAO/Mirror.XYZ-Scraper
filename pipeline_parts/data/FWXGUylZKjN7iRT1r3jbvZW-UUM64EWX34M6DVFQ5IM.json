I would like to compose some more books, distribute them in libraries and Kindles, so that it can inspire other kids to become writers with their own inspiring adventures.. \\n\\nI also like crafts and art, like paper crafts, sketches, sculpture, pixel art (It’s actually funny to paint in pixels)… Minecraft modding is also a favorite. I am looking forward to making a mod where you can, like, insta-everything. (Dragon stuff, actually.)\\n\\nI am also looking forward to coding some games and trying them out. I think they’ll be fun to play! Books are really my interest. I love reading and writing long chapter books and the like.\\n\\nHere is a preview of things that you will see:\\n\\n**Everything about Pill bugs**\\n\\nPill bugs. Not bugs. Not close. Not scary. My opinion says they are cute with their small tiny eyes the size of bread crumbs (If they were tiny and exactly the same size, that is.) And they roll up into a (Beach) ball! Really easy to keep. I have some as my “Pets” in my opinion. Pill bugs eat rotting leaves and bark. They have more than 17 names! \\n\\nHere are a few: Pill bugs, woodlice, slaters, potato bugs, doodle bugs, sow bugs, armadillo bugs, butcher boys, carpenters, cafners, cheeselogs, cheesy bugs, chiggy pigs, chucky pigs, granny greys, hog-lice, pea bugs, peasie-bugs, charliepigs, slunkerpigs, penny sows, grammasows, granddad gravys, granddads.\\n\\n![ALL SPECIES OF PILLBUG FROM RED BUTT TO HAASI HIGH YELLOW](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1GM0ygXHj4GDdvD42sIkb.jpg?height=1559&width=2131)\\n\\n**Horse care, riding, grooming**\\n\\nHorses are really majestic and graceful, strong and powerful. Some people think they are intimidating and scary, others say cute and cuddly (Think foal or pony).\\n\\nHorses need great care. Stallions are naturally crazy and you better be an advanced rider to have one. If you aren’t, think of being bucked off a zillion times in a row, riding a crazy madman, err, madhorse rearing like a psychopath, and galloping everywhere without listening to your cues, whether to stop or turn or whatever. Do not try to handle one (Unless you are an advanced rider and know what you are doing, that is).\\n\\n** \\n **\\n\\n![PHOENIX AND HIS HERD VS SOME SNAKES](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BoXJ717Y0cDPW7RpzSCkP.jpg?height=1421&width=2168)\\n\\n*I know this one is creepy…but it doesn’t give me the creeps...*\\n\\n** \\n We’ll talk about dragons**\\n\\nDragons. Dragons! Powerful creatures and fire  breathing monsters, like us humans, the good fight the bad. Really interesting in my opinion.\\n\\n** \\n **\\n\\n![SCARLETT THE FIRE DRAGON](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OP7OMF4jbvR4VhbiBsSHC.jpg?height=1318&width=2214)\\n\\n*This one is one of my good art. It didn’t take long, though. 16-30 minutes ‘o art made it through.*\\n\\n** \\n Minecraft galore!**\\n\\nMinecraft. Who doesn’t like Minecraft? It’s so popular and fun to play! Snow much fun! And it snows in Minecraft. Chests, (If you didn’t know, are things you can contain stuff in) on Christmas day, are presents. Minecraft is full of surprises, so when you play (If you can do so) you’re about to find out!! You can, like, build (Literally) everything you’d want. Who doesn’t wanna try it out?\\n\\n** \\n **\\n\\n![THE MINECRAFT ZOMBIE STORY](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/waEhfjlewxadI0jVyDSyD.jpg?height=512&width=384)\\n\\n*This one is incredibly weird. Can you read all of it? It tells a story of a zombie and a player. Think about Minecraft.*\\n\\n\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\n\\nAll of this on Mirror. I’ve recently been introduced to web3 and want to experiment with it. Expect some really (Not crazed pyromaniac-ish) silly things. Probably some horsy things, too. And some bugs (Not crashes!) and dragons.\\n\\nThis will take form via: chapter books, art projects ; reviews of books, games and art.\\n\\nNow you know what I am looking forward to doing, I look forward to entertaining you, and thank you for your continuous support!\\n\\n*Ziattak*\",\"timestamp\":1641471016,\"title\":\"HELLO MY NAME IS ZIATTAK!\"},\"digest\":\"m_8zq_VwZz8ds9FtOzthAIP1Mi0d7tIzqyjktEWENb0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x91b930Da7cdef7EA0eD5CDFcD3C9D6DdD14b3Cb9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"IYpRVpgoGsxBKOit0CnfTIq1j-8iJJD8a5Z8FBoBqXg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"luub1QNczszC3AOkdgsqmpidEgsuWp9Y5xA_H7m9w2k\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"5-VauaYZAaZRmCzykw_HaQU0CsXkLnO0HUSIIfC7_sbeiFvjmlhQVspgN2VcN4l7UuAYlTjKD3AGjBRJx2sYYw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc41125b3eada209678aa3d7cfec01c2aa0286b78bf2fc7997f29b63bb36b8b1560d0e3bc280a81545fb9081fb82bd5d2f8acec4f54747c6468b3bb5421fe4e9f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"IYpRVpgoGsxBKOit0CnfTIq1j-8iJJD8a5Z8FBoBqXg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"luub1QNczszC3AOkdgsqmpidEgsuWp9Y5xA_H7m9w2k\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"m_8zq_VwZz8ds9FtOzthAIP1Mi0d7tIzqyjktEWENb0\"}"
