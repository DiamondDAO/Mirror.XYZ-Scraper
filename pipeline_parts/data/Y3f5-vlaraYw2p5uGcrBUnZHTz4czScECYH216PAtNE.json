"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Day 1\\n\\nThe sun was shining and everything looked the most amazing it had ever looked before, i mean how couldn’t it when it was literally created a couple of days ago. straight from the ether, brand new, and blaze. \\n\\nSee how marvelous the trees and animals feel and look, how fresh and clean the air is, and how perfect the weather always is. The trees in a constant state of producing  fruits in abundance at all times while the animals enjoy eternal youth and health.  \\n\\nFor the creator so loved his perfect creature that he dedicated the rest of all his marvelous creations to Adam. Everything above and below, inner and outer was given to him as gift to rule over, after all he was the exact replica of his creator.\\n\\nAnd a creator deserved his own mini kingdom to rule, and so the earth was to be both his domain and his home, together with all the other creations he was meant to rule.\\n\\nand yet to think that a man would still have the ability to be completely bored, thought Adam to himself while observing the nearby scenery. one most exquisite and perfect to behold, just like everything that existed in this paradise.\\n\\nAdam mostly spent his days helping the animals in the garden, naming them and discovering way of using his abilities given to him when he was created to help there day to day tasks. \\n\\nHowever in his spare time he would receive special teaching from the angels as part of his training, and boy did he learn quick. The secrets of the universe which each angel was assigned was slowly imparted to Adam.\\n\\nFor each angel can only be allowed to know particular secrets f heaven and was never allowed to share them except with Adam. Some angels taught him the secrets of stones, herbs, of the stars and many more and every thing was perfect.\\n\\nAnd although unknown to Adam not all the angels were happy with the authority which he was granted by the creator and with that they set out to try to trap him, and prove to the creator how unfit his son and chosen champion was.\\n\\none day while doing his usual custodian of the universe duty he observed a strange phenomenon which he had never paid attention to until now. Every creature in the garden had a partner. \\n\\neach animal had a male and female, from the greatest creature to the smallest ant everything had a partner everything except Adam. This perplexed adam, as this was the first time he had ever noticed it.\\n\\nAdam: samyaza, why does every other animal have a partner except me? he asked as he sat on the rock right next to the tree of tree. \\n\\nSamyaza: sadly i dont not have the answer to such a complex and profound question. i think it is a question best suited for the supreme being. For certain things are only privy to them and them alone. \\n\\nAdam: signs, indeed i shall do like wise when i see him next. for now am eager to learn about what you have to teach me today Our previous lesson was really exquisite and exciting. \\n\\nSamyaza: Today i shall divulge the secrets of the trees. all trees shall deliver there secrets to you as commanded by the creator, all except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. As it is forbidden to speak of its secrets.\\n\\nSamyaza: But like all stories we shall begin in the beginning when they were first created and spoken into existence the supreme creator. and so we begin, in the beginning………\",\"timestamp\":1635366170,\"title\":\"black Adam in Paradise\"},\"digest\":\"MWMVud41F1VtS04snH7eNjx6FyRkpN8gKjuaTS5IZAY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xE3293A736d2BBe183F5C0A90cdb0fe0518f8834E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"N0hewa9bjXXi4BqFlwVFYovLPyZj4xhPl3qNEZHIxaI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"OUewK8g6c91MaqnyN_13qfPnBCjo3uPhzYRHB7yXrkY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"3i10NY2T14KtpVbi3rQroAVIQ3cmyrNKGYDE7jGmzNUNT2CA21k6abbb7k1wYZw6u-c1QELuvs8kBM6HIjq30Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xccd7ea30a3dec9c87bbd98c0fac8dbdcf08c064b1ad0b2b2f2c58908c41838c158349fb009942bd24a864c189e7b8349d4740f2674aa8c1deb40c72bf57ec5231c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"N0hewa9bjXXi4BqFlwVFYovLPyZj4xhPl3qNEZHIxaI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"OUewK8g6c91MaqnyN_13qfPnBCjo3uPhzYRHB7yXrkY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"MWMVud41F1VtS04snH7eNjx6FyRkpN8gKjuaTS5IZAY\"}"
