"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"If I hadn't been ill until to-day you would have seen me in the salon. I open at the Folly Theatre next week. Dear ol' Lunnon, y' know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Of course, I knew you were going,\\\" said Coleman. \\\"But I thought you were to go later. What do you open in? \\\"\\n\\n\\\" Fly by Night. Come walk along with me. See those two old ladies \\\" They've been watching for me like hawks ever since we left New York. They expected me to flirt with every man on board. But I've fooled them. I've been just as g-o-o-d. I had to be.\\\"\\n\\nAs the pair moved toward the stern, enormous and radiant green waves were crashing futilely after the steamer. Ireland showed a dreary coast line to the north. A wretched man who had crossed the Atlantic eighty-four times was declaiming to a group of novices. A venerable banker, bundled in rugs, was asleep in his deck chair.\\n\\n\\\" Well, Nora,\\\" said Coleman, \\\" I hope you make a hit in London. You deserve it if anybody does. You've worked hard.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Worked hard,\\\" cried the girl. \\\"I should think so. Eight years ago I was in the rear row. Now I have the centre of the stage whenever I want it. I made Chalmers cut out that great scene in the second act between the queen and Rodolfo. The idea! Did he think I would stand that ? And just because he was in love with Clara Trotwood, too.\\\"\\n\\nColeman was dreamy. \\\" Remember when I was dramatic man for the Gazette and wrote the first notice ? \\\"\\n\\n\\\" Indeed, I do,\\\" answered the girl affectionately. \\\" Indeed, I do, Rufus. Ah, that was a great lift. I believe that was the first thing that had an effect on old Oliver. Before that, he never would believe that I was any good. Give me your arm, Rufus. Let's parade before the two old women.\\\" Coleman glanced at her keenly. Her voice had trembled slightly. Her eyes were lustrous as if she were about to weep.\\n\\n\\\" Good heavens,\\\" he said. \\\" You are the same old Nora Black. I thought you would be proud and 'aughty by this time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Not to my friends,\\\" she murmured., \\\" Not to my friends. I'm always the same and I never forget. Rufus.\\\"\\n\\n\\\" Never forget what? \\\" asked Coleman.\\n\\n\\\" If anybody does me a favour I never forget it as long as I live,\\\" she answered fervently.\\n\\n\\\" Oh, you mustn't be so sentimental, Nora. You remember that play you bought from little Ben Whipple, just because he had once sent you some flowers in the old days when you were poor and happened to bed sick. A sense of gratitude cost you over eight thousand dollars that time, didn't it? \\\" Coleman laughed heartily.\\n\\n\\\" Oh, it wasn't the flowers at all,\\\" she interrupted seriously. \\\" Of course Ben was always a nice boy, but then his play was worth a thousand dollars. That's all I gave him. I lost some more in trying to make it go. But it was too good. That was what was the matter. It was altogether too good for the public. I felt awfully sorry for poor little Ben.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Too good?\\\" sneered Coleman. \\\"Too good? Too indifferently bad, you mean. My dear girl, you mustn't imagine that you know a good play. You don't, at all.\\\"\\n\\nShe paused abruptly and faced him. This regal, creature was looking at him so sternly that Coleman felt awed for a moment as if he, were in the presence of a great mind. \\\" Do you mean to say that I'm not an artist ? \\\" she asked.\\n\\nColeman remained cool. \\\" I've never been decorated for informing people of their own affairs,\\\" he observed, \\\" but I should say that you were about as much of an artist as I am.\\\"\\n\\nFrowning slightly, she reflected upon this reply. Then, of a sudden, she laughed. \\\" There is no use in being angry with you, Rufus. You always were a hopeless scamp. But,\\\" she added, childishly wistful, \\\"have you ever seen Fly by Night?  Don't you think my dance in the second act is artistic? \\\"\\n\\n\\\" No,\\\" said Coleman, \\\" I haven't seen Fly by Night yet, but of course I know that you are the most beautiful dancer on the stage. Everybody knows that.\\\"\\n\\nIt seemed that her hand tightened on his arm. Her face was radiant. \\\" There,\\\" she exclaimed. \\\" Now you are forgiven. You are a nice boy, Rufus-some- times.\\\"\\n\\nWhen Miss Black went to her cabin, Coleman strolled into the smoking room. Every man there covertly or openly surveyed him. He dropped lazily into a chair at a table where the wine merchant, the Chicago railway king and the New York millionaire were playing cards. They made a noble pretense of not being aware of him. On the oil cloth top of the table the cards were snapped down, turn by turn.\\n\\nFinally the wine merchant, without lifting his head to- address a particular person, said: \\\" New conquest.\\\"\\n\\nHailing a steward Coleman asked for a brandy and soda.\\n\\nThe millionaire said: \\\" He's a sly cuss, anyhow.\\\" The railway man grinned. After an elaborate silence the wine merchant asked: \\\" Know Miss Black long, Rufus?\\\" Coleman looked scornfully at his friends. \\\" What's wrong with you there, fellows, anyhow?\\\" The Chicago man answered airily. \\\" Oh, nothin'. Nothin', whatever.\\\"\\n\\nAt dinner in the crowded salon, Coleman was aware that more than one passenger glanced first at Nora Black and then at him, as if connecting them in some train of thought, moved to it by the narrow horizon of shipboard and by a sense of the mystery that surrounds the lives of the beauties of the stage. Near the captain's right hand sat the glowing and splendid Nora, exhibiting under the gaze of the persistent eyes of many meanings, a practiced and profound composure that to the populace was terrfying dignity.\\n\\nStrolling toward the smoking room after dinner, Coleman met the New York millionaire, who seemed agitated. He took Coleman fraternally by the arm. \\\" Say, old man, introduce me, won't you ? I'm crazy to know her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you mean Miss Black?\\\" asked Coleman.\",\"timestamp\":1638786111,\"title\":\" Send you a card \\\" I don't believe you can read,  else you would have known I was to sail on this steamer\"},\"digest\":\"y0JTfU-cwgAzc49S89QpScSHdgbYtGSIhdBrO03Wz9o\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x667E6054E728f4dC76df3f0F3c9c6bf23c751e8a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"XwJv_DXXCGGD6RyqdhKrLFeodzUyjsbhBiFKnVFQbnY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"O4C5IwAQc3BOUysoU9fFrUpvAPo2TCQolYJc5HKolIs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"lzOovDP70fCLd8U1T_eLP3BPf0KxSj9E0B8peL0a9CPqvmvNstehnHmMvrPLnegKRhWPZgI7q1Z-GVutXrQBWw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x28c1966ebb66fce75cf5136c3570f5676b940ef39aa966a7b03237f441870a814708faebb83ae686dd1d1ae4c8bb86d09251efd0540e08c1afff7a165a9c58771c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"XwJv_DXXCGGD6RyqdhKrLFeodzUyjsbhBiFKnVFQbnY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"O4C5IwAQc3BOUysoU9fFrUpvAPo2TCQolYJc5HKolIs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"y0JTfU-cwgAzc49S89QpScSHdgbYtGSIhdBrO03Wz9o\"}"
