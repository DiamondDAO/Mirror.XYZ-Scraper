The Bored Ape Gazette is reporting Fallon most likely purchased Bored Ape #599.\\nBored Ape #599 has the following six traits and rarities:\\n\\n* Blue background (12% of Apes)\\n* Navy Striped Tee (3%)\\n* Heart sunglasses (4%)\\n* Cream fur (6%)\\n* Sea Captain’s hat (3%)\\n* Bored mouth (23%)\\n  This Ape was purchased by Moonpay for $46.6 Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) on Nov. 8, or around $216,000. Moonpay transferred the Ape to a new Opensea account, which could be that of Fallon.\\n  Related Link: NBA Player Uses Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT On Sneakers: What Investors Should Know \\n  Why It’s Important: Fallon is well-known as a talk show host interacting with celebrities and athletes on a daily basis.
