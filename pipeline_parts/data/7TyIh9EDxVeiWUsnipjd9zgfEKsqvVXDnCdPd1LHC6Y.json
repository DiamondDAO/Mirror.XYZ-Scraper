"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"When the blockchain spirit is highly developed, it will emerge a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, that is, an encrypted native group formed on a common purpose. DAO is an entity driven by the blockchain, and its internal operations are written through smart contracts. Its governance and operation are determined by rules written in self-executing smart contracts without the intervention of centralized power, and it is transparent to everyone. DAO also issues tokens to its community, as the \\\"ownership\\\" and the right to participate in decision-making (similar to shareholders in the traditional business world). The rules written in the code by the DAO cannot be changed and will be operated as expected until the community (token holders) vote to change them through the set process. Therefore, DAO is a new form of technology-enabled organization that allows people to gather for a common goal and work together in a formal way to achieve the goal.\\n\\n \\n\\nIn short, DAO is an organization that has no formal leadership and allows every member to participate in decision-making and make decision together. It can also be called a distributed autonomous company (DAC), and there are indeed many similarities between DAO and traditional companies.\\n\\nOrganize individuals for a certain cause, solve social problems by creating value, and provide an opportunity to create wealth (including individuals and the entire society).\\n\\nBut at the same time, there are also sharp differences between the two. A traditional company is a form of corporate organization established in accordance with the law for the purpose of making profits, and the ownership of the company belongs to the company's shareholders. Since most of the decision-making power and the company's profits are in the hands of shareholders, the profits for company's employees are greatly reduced. Therefore, problems such as centralization, organizational failure, and inequality of wealth are prone to occur under the corporate system.\\n\\nDAO is just the opposite. DAO is task-driven, taking into account profits of everyone and creating value. The ownership of DAO belongs to the entire community. In DAO, there is no strict hierarchy, and community members communicate on an equal footing.\\n\\nDAO's decision-making is determined by the community, and the common goal is achieved through the interaction, competition and collaboration between network nodes. Meanwhile, DAO relies on smart contracts to have high autonomy and orderliness, flat management structure, and create a more flexible workflow.\\n\\n**When the SDOG community develops rapidly, DAO governance is on the agenda**\\n\\nAs the largest individual address holders of SHIB and ENS pay attention to and hold SDOG, the number of holders of SDOG has grown at an extraordinary speed, and the issue of community governance is put on the agenda.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BOH6ZmLHVBnXw04pr25bL.jpg?height=341&width=756)\\n\\nSDOG is a revolutionary experiment initiated by the decentralized community, committed to becoming a more decentralized and promising currency than DogeCoin and SHIB. Therefore, how to balance governance and ecosystem development has become the focus of the SDOG community:\\n\\nEach stage of SDOG will be carried out by the growth of coin holding addresses, evolving from a small DAO to a larger DAO. People enter specific servers and organizations because of some common concerns and hobbies, and spot their places in communication with other people, and then a new social structure and work personalization have been created through online-to-offline interconnection.\\n\\n**SDOG and its new road to consensus HoldMaps**\\n\\nSDOG has absorbed the successful experience of DAO and made an improvement on the form of the organization. SDOG has launched a new consensus mechanism Holdmaps. As the name implies, Holdmaps is a roadmap for holding currency addresses. It is a very interesting mechanism, as shown on SDOG's official website:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OO0G2N_ZJpLBks2SyGLY8.jpg?height=454&width=756)\\n\\nFrom SDOG's HolderMaps, it can be seen that SDOG has completed three processes:\\n\\n1000 Holders - Commemorative Coins \\n\\nEach SDOG commemorative coin has an independent serial number. The commemorative coin has a face value of 1 SDOG and 100 SDOG. For every 1000 commemorative coins with a face value of 1 SDOG, a commemorative coin with a face value of 100 SDOG will be randomly generated.\\n\\n3000 Holders - Zoo Project\\n\\nThe breeder plan (Phase 1), with 50 billion SDOG, airdrops to the SHIB holding addresses. Rewards will be issued in the form of blind boxes, and users can check the specific amount received after receiving them.\\n\\n6000Holders - NFT Governance Mining\\n\\nSDOG can continue mining for 100 years through NFT mining machines. ETH and BSC are supported chains for present, and users can mine on either chain of the two chains.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ohLr5Jt2sZ68ugoOdJuNN.jpg?height=556&width=756)\\n\\nThe upcoming stage is 10000Holder's SDOG cross-chain BSC, and BSC mining and governance supporting.\\n\\nThe subsequent stages are as follows:\\n\\n20000 Holders - SDOG Credit Card\\n\\nSDOG users can apply for SDOG exclusive credit card to deposit SDOG, and convert SDOG into fiat currency for consumption.\\n\\n30000 Holders - SDOG DAO\\n\\nWhen a user holds a mining machine for mining, the user will obtain governance rights (hashrate) based on the properties of the mining machine and the number of thrusters added. Then the user can make a governance vote on SDOG's proposals.\\n\\n100000 Holders - Layer2\\n\\nBased on zero-knowledge proof, resolve the slow across chain bridge speed with layer 2 network.\\n\\n150000 Holders - Satellite Node\\n\\nCooperate with SpaceX to store NFT information and will information to the satellite for permanent storage, and retrieve it when needed.\\n\\n200000 Holders - Metaverse\\n\\nAfter a large-scale consensus, a new meta-universe world is created.\\n\\nThis novel project progress is in line with the decentralization spirit of the current blockchain technology. With the increase of currency holding addresses, the governance rights for community construction will also be assigned to the currency holding addresses. It can reveal the reasonable thinking on the self development of SDOG community. To a certain extent, SODG’s HoldMaps will be the market’s model for governance rights. SDOG will gradually expand its market influence and become a new bellwether of the market in the course of continuous development.\\n\\n**SDOG governance and incentives**\\n\\nIn practice, DAO could be used to achieve many goals, but Many existing DAOs are at risk of being replaced by new, faster-growing teams. In the final analysis, it is because the incentive mechanism is weak or non-existent. Product development is slow and the team cannot grow without incentives. At the same time, the protocol has uncountable funds that need to be spent effectively. The development dilemma of DAO looms ahead.\\n\\nSDOG's exploration of community governance includes the following two parts:\\n\\nSDOG Treasury: All funds of the SDOG project include: SDOG to be distributed, income from the sale of NFT rockets and thrusters, income from fund management, income from supporting other projects, etc.\\n\\nDAO Governance: All expenditures of the treasury are determined by the DAO. Users who own SDOG mining machines and mining to provide hashrate have voting rights. The higher the hashrate, the grater the voting right.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_EfBq-pryni823v_lldJd.jpg?height=852&width=1307)\\n\\nThe fund allocation is that 25% into the fund pool, 25% to buyback SDOG, and 50% to the treasury. While treasury funds promote the development of SDOG project and the growth of Holders, the growth of Holders is also beneficial for the ecosystem construction, thereby promoting the increase of treasury income.\\n\\nSDOG’s DAO governance is mainly about the governance of SDOG treasury and HolderMaps development proposals. The SDOG project will deposit tokens to be distributed and income (SDOG to be distributed, income from the sale of NFT rockets and thrusters, income from fund management, income from supporting other projects, etc.) into the treasury. The expenditures of the treasury are determined by the vote of SDOG governors.\\n\\nIn the practical governance process, Holder obtains incomes by holding hashrate. The faster the project develops, the higher the income that Holder obtains. Treasury’s buyback method can also effectively control the fluctuation of SDOG price. This governance model is considerably beneficial to stimulate the enthusiasm of community members, and since SDOG eco development is still in the early stage, there is no need to worry about the minority controlling community governance rights.\\n\\n**Summary**\\n\\nIn the future, DAO will become an important form of social organization, maximizing the effectiveness and value of the organization, and shaping new commercial changes. The SDOG community will gradually grow up under the guidance of decentralization. Although SDOG DAO governance may experience attacks or other problems, it does not mean that SDOG's exploration of community governance is wrong. More and more DAO are emerging, and the SDOG community will grow stronger.\",\"timestamp\":1639039548,\"title\":\"Accelerating of Community Autonomy, SDOG’s DAO Governance and Incentives\"},\"digest\":\"DAh-PfBirRvpWjstMT_46xuvszPu7mTJiekdBIDfDlE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x1fEf11c746cDF0482A5be1699391a1e6e9497301\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"O3bxdP0talfWzmYVhGGPLhPECKtGRvQRba8gFdSFzl4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"InY8pLGFI20Yj6QNuiDPx6aNaEz1QDbDEX9YQ29tVT4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"LxsVm6grBDlV0rOKgstb339rPk-I4DNbs8xLjry5ZoAoT1pHJlsN7j--hBGdJtZ2GV6rDUbPlDS5R1_RoB3Ssw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc353999c2dcf8f6c78124973786af795cc9cf1281f5d5379c9c01b3f93d798f642abeb750c408bfc9221898c6f7122753b4c862d1e5eb363794335b2a19a6c361c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"O3bxdP0talfWzmYVhGGPLhPECKtGRvQRba8gFdSFzl4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"InY8pLGFI20Yj6QNuiDPx6aNaEz1QDbDEX9YQ29tVT4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"DAh-PfBirRvpWjstMT_46xuvszPu7mTJiekdBIDfDlE\"}"
