"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Yes, this is Doge. The *iconic* Doge. WOOF!\\n\\nWhat started off as ‚Äòjust‚Äô an internet meme has worked its way into becoming a cultural phenomenon and a perennial piece of art. Doge, centered around a Shiba Inu dog with suboptimal grammar, has undoubtedly become the most loved meme of the decade. Whilst weaving its way into our hearts, this special K9 has also paved the way for the viral memes that came after it.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/64801586-0ab9-4e5b-b02a-25467bfdc367.png?height=480&width=640)\\n\\nIn June 2021, Atsuko Sato, the owner of the famous Shiba Inu (who goes by Kabosu), [minted the original photo as an NFT](https://zora.co/0x337071a7e907f5a599747a2c9baf6efdf7eb4bcc/3366). The NFT is the rare 1/1 original piece that pays tribute to the whole Doge movement and related internet phenomena. It was sold for a record-breaking price of 1696 ETH ($5.5 million) to PleasrDAO, an experimental art collective.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9298ef46-6f53-4aa8-8693-c68467776fb8.png?height=1218&width=1840)\\n\\n**Oke, so wat?**\\n\\nToday, PleasrDAO is announcing that the NFT has been fractionalized into billions of pieces to be shared with the broader internet community. Using [fractional.art](https://fractional.art/vaults/0xbaac2b4491727d78d2b78815144570b9f2fe8899), the original Doge NFT has been divided into billions of $DOG ERC-20 tokens, allowing everyone and everything, including also cats, to own a piece of history.\\n\\n**How it werk? ü§î**\\n\\nThe initial auction of $DOG fractions will take place on September 1st, at 1pm EST and it will be the first opportunity for people to own this piece of art. Thereafter, it will be available to exchange on [fractional.art](https://fractional.art) or through decentralized exchanges such as [sushi.com](https://sushi.com) or [uniswap.org](https://uniswap.org).\\n\\nTalking numbers, there will initially be 20% of total $DOG supply available in the auction. That is 3,393,939,393 $DOG of the total supply of 16,969,696,969. An additional 25% of $DOG tokens have been allocated to $DOG community programs and continued development.\\n\\nOur goal at PleasrDAO is to be good stewards of this meaningful piece to help her reach her full potential. We have plans for a $DOG dev fund for projects aimed at supporting the long term community, and we will be the primary provider of liquidity on exchanges. PleasrDAO has discussed many mechanisms for getting all $DOG into the hands of the community without resulting in downward price pressure. We will ensure The Doge NFT does not go up for auction until we feel $DOG has reached full meme escape velocity and is coupled with a strong, thriving community.\\n\\nFor now, it‚Äôs very much as if the Louvre decided to fractionalize the Mona Lisa and distribute a portion of it for the public to own. However, unlike at the Louvre, collective ownership of art is really only possible using crypto art. In this digital-first world, NFTs can capture significant moments, phenomena and concepts while a smart contract can fractionalize and distribute them to the public. An incredible thing to witness and be a part of.\\n\\n**I buy Doge, now wat? üéâ**\\n\\nAfter securing a rightful place in the annals of history books, you, as a proud Doge owner, are granted additional benefits. *Much excite, very fun!*\\n\\nDoge ownership gives you access to an exclusive set of activities, both on- and woofline. Consider this your lifetime ticket to a perpetual festival of delight and entertainment brought to you directly by the Doge community. More details on that will soon be posted on the [Doge Discord](https://discord.gg/WyqUTTXQ).\\n\\n**Diamond Paws üëá**\\n\\nWith great pawer comes great respawnsibility. üêæ Aside from special benefits, $DOG holders can also exercise their ownership of the NFT by voting on the valuation of the original NFT. In other words ‚Äî¬† determine how much the NFT is worth. If sold at a given price, which is collectively determined by the whole holder base, ownership of the Doge NFT will transfer to the new owner and token holders will then be able to trade their tokens at a price proportional to that of the sale.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Your Guide Doc to buy $DOG**\\n\\n*A simple step-by-step tutorial on how to get $DOG tokens and earn your rightful place in history*\\n\\nIf you are reading this, you are special, much special. We are beyond excited to have you on board as we set out to begin a journey that will echo in eternity. Here is how to get started and become an Internet culture pioneer.\\n\\n* As a first step, make sure you‚Äôve loaded up on some ETH in your crypto wallet, you‚Äôll need it to complete the whole process. Don‚Äôt have a wallet? [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) are great options.\\n* Head over to the [SushiSwap App](https://app.sushi.com/swap), connect your wallet (Top Right), and swap your ETH (*Swap From*) into Wrapped ETH (*Swap To*). This is simply wrapping your ETH so it will work with the Miso auction.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9a8c5fc3-927b-48d2-a41b-672cf5478af6.png?height=780&width=1212)\\n\\n* The $DOG auction will take place on [Miso](https://miso.sushi.com/auctions/0x5e29C9Bf97c45e55f1c2257D0Ecf6909726745f3). Again, make sure your wallet is connected and then head over to *Marketplace* > *Live Sales* from the left-hand side menu.
