"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"In conjunction with Xi’s growing support for blockchain technology, China aggressively progressed with its CBDC and blockchain initiatives in 2020. As such, China’s digital yuan pilots had processed at least $300 million in transactions by November. In December, the Chinese government also hinted that it plans to launch cross-border CBDC transactions with Hong Kong.\\n\\nChina’s Blockchain-based Service Network, a nationwide blockchain initiative supported by the government, also saw multiple milestones in 2020. Piloted in 2019, the BSN rolled out its first set of blockchain integrations including Ethereum and EOS in August, later adding more networks such as Polkadot and Algorand.\\n\\n**Xi’s 2021:**\\n\\nCointelegraph expects China’s President Xi to further encourage the accelerated development of digital currency and blockchain. It remains to be seen how China’s cross-border CBDC transactions will play out, but it will provide some solid basis for global CBDC initiatives and further development of the global financial system. A cross-border digital yuan, if realized, would also raise more questions about the U.S. dollar’s hegemony as the world’s reserve currency and the Chinese CBDC potentially being an economic cyberweapon.\\n\\nIt will be also interesting to observe the dynamics of the Chinese government’s relationship with private enterprise after the state halted Jack Ma’s $35 billion Ant Group initial public offering in late 2020. President Xi reportedly was the main figure behind the decision to halt the IPO.\",\"timestamp\":1639033768,\"title\":\"In conjunction with Xi’s growing support for blockchain technology\"},\"digest\":\"FaRVgELP_VItmAkhRz2C84hyrEPjrL_OyJuKRywogsY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd85739516B1BdCDDFdf9aA7f6acAcb4307766A9b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"gEtc6JGXZyHP7lIzjcxT47e1Zycds3jn16VtrU9dMgw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"w4FLlCU9YBuepdbdttP1biwm0cVvkgxkCq3zoLUviz8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Ux3fIDZ6N5RMSAJEEzfkLIof_AjFXJ8T0TOq3zElHSpc3VV3xjq-xBfOvMEZh0msj5pemFnR-DS-qIbvjVQtWg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe30de0a8027a77804fb73de63617ac7c34fbe8cd86b44a1d8627b4997c6c06e527120fd3043cd0bfab2b2a76cff0df570493c4d5d80931272b0a049e262b6c5e1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"gEtc6JGXZyHP7lIzjcxT47e1Zycds3jn16VtrU9dMgw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"w4FLlCU9YBuepdbdttP1biwm0cVvkgxkCq3zoLUviz8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"FaRVgELP_VItmAkhRz2C84hyrEPjrL_OyJuKRywogsY\"}"
