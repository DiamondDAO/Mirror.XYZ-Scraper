"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Disclaimer: I am no ETH maxi, ETH had less than 10% of my portfolio at the beginning of the year. Still sub 20% and is likely to stay that way until major developments in the balance of power.\\n\\nAt the time of writing Oct 2021, there’s a lot of excitement in the smart contract space about Ethereum competitors, notable ones with price runs being Avalanche and Polygon. Other competitors will be covered further down the article. In this article will be covering why speed is not a moat, developer incentives and user incentives.\\n\\n# Speed is not enough\\n\\nThe crux of my argument basically comes down to you cannot compete on speed in the medium/long run. For those that are competing on speed your competitor is no longer ETH but rather its various scaling solutions be it layer2 or otherwise.\\n\\nFast/Cheap EVM compatible transactions growth is a double edged sword, what gives you an influx of S-curve customers today is what takes your s-curve ramp tomorrow, unless you meaningfully differentiate. This is why today I effectively view EVM compatible chains that compete on speed as acquisition channels. But let’s explore the dynamics of this a bit more.\\n\\nThis is not an issue for the user facing dapps just their underlying chains. Once a dapp gains meaningful user and growth they will have many options in front of them for how to best achieve further growth, many options of which will be on Ethereum.  EVM compatibility makes switching or spanning chains relatively cheap. What matters to this growth dapp projects in their next phase of maturity is composability, integration, and liquidity, not speed or cheapness of transactions.\\nAt the extremes you see a version of this today, Axie has built Ronin for scalability, Tether is on Omni, ETH and Tron…\\n\\nThe only thing that will keep your faster/cheaper EVM compatible chain relevant is a differentiated use case that is valuable for your dapp projects in their needs. Now let’s talk about some developer dynamics.\\n\\n# Developer incentives\\n\\nA rational dev will always take the shortest path, time and resource wise, to achieve an approximate end goal that close their vision. This lets you get your product out and test for product market fit. There are so many new things in crypto, spending more time on an unreleased project has huge opportunity costs. This is the case for any startup but even worse for a crypto one during a bull market. So why build fundamental building blocks when you can leverage off 3rd party works? It worked well for Linux and open source adoption in a Microsoft world and it worked for Node adoption in the web2 world. To put it bluntly you will be able to ship a more fully featured and integrated product on day one on ETH than anywhere else. There will be exceptions but this will be the majority case.\\n\\nThis is what happens when dapp projects are still small, let’s take a look at what happens when they’re bigger. Once you grow and have an audience, you will have more resources to allow you to better tailor to the audience that you don’t know A) if it exists or B) exactly what they want. Once you have an app with an established and growing audience you will be solely focused on features for your users or target users. A large subset of these features are already exists on Ethereum ecosystem either as financial primitives, integrations or partnering opportunities. So even if you got big somewhere else you will have to bridge or integrate with an ETH based project. This is the benefits of power law returns in the diversity of the ETH ecosystem. Finally Ethereum still has advantages in composability and security. The real measure of success for an Ethereum competitor in the long run is not in the projects that has deployed on it, it is what those projects do when they scale up and how the project spreads its value across chains. You see it today the big DeFi projects are going multi-chain for various reasons, scalability being a major one, but the value accrues back to ETH from a primary chain perspective.\\n\\nA final point related to the existing ecosystem, it took years for Ethereum to build that up and you’re only seeing the stability and maturity now for a thriving ecosystem. Can this be bootstrapped by copy pasta dapps? Additionally before that it took years for Ethereum to build the tooling to make the above possible do these exist for competitors?\\n\\n# User incentives\\n\\nI see a world where users do not understand what is behind the product but trust it empirically. I first came across this idea from @AriDavidPaul. You trust your credit card, very few people know the technical details and tradeoffs of the infrastructure that powers cards, nor do they care. More importantly the merchants that sells trust it too.\\n\\nUsers are already fickle, just look at AMMs they go where the liquidity /price is and look at all the mercenary capital in Yield aggregators. Yes token incentives creates greater buy-in, governance and participation in projects but this mainly accrues to the project no the underlying chain.\\n\\nLet’s look at this from another perspective, a value chain perspective. You have: \\n\\n* Users -> dapps -> blockchains \\n* Demand -> gateway -> suppliers \\n\\nI used gateway because not all projects have aggregator characteristics. The dapp projects (gateway) are closest to the users effectively control the demand and power in this value chain and they will inevitably try to modularise the suppliers. Look at what Apple did to IOS app and games developers (suppliers) and Amazon did to sellers. @benthompson writes in depth about this stuff, give him a sub!\\n\\n# Left overs and conclusion\\n\\nHow does Solana, Polkadot and Cosmos fit in here? I suspect they’re more defensible given they’re not as reliant on speed and cheap transactions. This is an area I’m still diving into and may write more on.\\n\\nWhat timeframe am I talking about 2-5 years.\\n\\nThis piece is not focused around price potential of the the projects mentioned below a lot of these chains can be quite successful and still be an acquisition channel for ETH, but acquisition channels never overtake the thing it is acquiring for.  EVM while a great growth hack is one that can only be used as a stepping stone, day one you need to have a meaningful differentiation.\\n\\nWhere am I wrong? What am I missing? What should I expand on?\\nLet me know as I write to improve my thinking.\",\"timestamp\":1633743130,\"title\":\"Speed is not enough, why EVM based chains are just short-term acquisition channels for Ethereum\"},\"digest\":\"TowfUO_UqLQhuD603ahHF921Kx2romAjlwfdKoyniKw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2a41D6d9f24F4a1458F1072e83f40736f43eF16c\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"YyWGjwHfGMH0wLuWZrc0_xsvrZSsc0xwODJsolclRZ0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"aj0RzgrNAUQnHBNSk8aNUlZdtFKPz4w_ebl8lPQNae8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Uv63gfLLMheccYA47SDJE_aLuhR9zjxHXfnzn0wS4-EI6b8lmL6uHCa6b5eMmRU0Ip_3Pa9GeJZYlHd4HmrUzg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xbd751be54b03d24f6a7e31845ba6765fe20504a118693ab9211a287b3a276d0825611b75319079a61e33dd593c788f4469d1e965ef3822407ffd15de694519091b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"YyWGjwHfGMH0wLuWZrc0_xsvrZSsc0xwODJsolclRZ0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"aj0RzgrNAUQnHBNSk8aNUlZdtFKPz4w_ebl8lPQNae8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"TowfUO_UqLQhuD603ahHF921Kx2romAjlwfdKoyniKw\"}"
