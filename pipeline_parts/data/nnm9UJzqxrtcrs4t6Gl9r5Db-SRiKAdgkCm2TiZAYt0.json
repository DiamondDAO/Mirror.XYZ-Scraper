"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"If you answer other people's questions frequently and write more articles, your logical thinking will become stronger and stronger. Seriously speaking, the logic of language is the logic of the brain.\\n\\nWriting an article and speaking have something in common. Both have a very low threshold, but it is extremely difficult to do well. Everyone can speak and write, but why do some people speak well and write well and others can't? Because it is like building blocks, the rules are super simple, but what can be combined is really based on the logic and imagination of the brain.\\n\\nTo improve the logic of the article, the essence is to improve the logic of thinking. My personal experience is as follows:\\n\\nRead more logical books. Of course, logic itself is a subject. Besides, the most logical subject is mathematics.\\n\\nYou see, when we solve a math problem, logic must be used; and to prove a math problem, the proof process must be logically rigorous. So if you suspect that your logical thinking is weak, you must make up for mathematics. I finished college and when I was fine, I bought two high school math books to do math problems in order to train Luo Ji's thinking ability.\\n\\nThe second is to read more logical books. I always admire books written by developed countries in Europe and America, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Books written by people in these three countries, as long as they are called classics, no matter what they are. The books are very structured and logical. If you read books written by people with strong logic, your logic will naturally be trained.\\n\\nIn contrast, Asia and the third world countries have very weak logic. If you are close to Zhu Zhe is red, close to Mo is black, if you often read fantasy novels written by Chinese, the Internet\\n\\nNovels, your mind will become more and more confused. In addition, now that the Internet is so convenient, answering other people’s questions on the Internet can also be forged.\\n\\nPractice your Luo Ji thinking.\\n\\nEntrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs 137\\n\\nWhy answer the question? Because proving a problem requires strong logic. Use waste\\n\\nQuit, you often prove something to others, naturally Luo Ji thinks just fine\\n\\nPosition yourself quickly, whether to be a leader or a manager\\n\\nMany of us have little experience in starting a business, thinking that leaders and managers are the same. Anyway, we just do what happens, instead of using our own strengths based on our own strengths.\\n\\nEveryone has their own abilities and character focus. Few people are both leaders and managers. Because the practice of leaders and managers are mutually exclusive.\\n\\nThe most important ability of a leader is to look at industry trends and the general social environment, and to practice the ability to simplify complex issues. Belongs to the talents who control the direction and set the strategy.\\n\\nAs for managers, they need the ability to complicate simple problems, to implement strategies, directions, and to control the details of the company and the details of products.\\n\\nLeadership requires a lot of things to focus on, analyze clearly, what can be done, what can’t be done, and what can be done only after waiting. You must have the ability to see the essence through the phenomenon.\\n\\nAnd what about managers? It requires the ability to divide a big problem into many small problems, divide the broad direction into small details, and then lead the team to do these things.\\n\\nTherefore, managers actually deal with trivial matters every day, and are the specific operators of the enterprise.\\n\\nWhat about the leader? It's about caring about the company's strategy every day. Are the candidates for the company's various departments competent, and what changes in the market? It’s important to analyze these things clearly, but you don’t need to set a strategy every day and change the leaders of various departments every day. The leader is very\\n\\n138 Entrepreneur Business School Serving entrepreneurs\\n\\nFew, but very important people. Basically, no mistakes are allowed. Once it makes a mistake, it is a big mistake, and the company may be ruined.\\n\\nManagers are doing small things every day, focusing on how to subdivide countless small things and follow up on the specific affairs of the company. If these small things are done well, then the effect of business operations will be very good. Do a little thing wrong. It will not affect the overall situation.\\n\\nSo, if you are a leader, then you need to find a manager as your partner. If you are a manager, you need to find a leader as your partner. In fact, there is no difference between high and low, and equal status. But if they are misplaced, or they are all leadership talents or management talents, the company will definitely be messed up.\\n\\nI suggest that we entrepreneurs, after setting sail, the first step is to find a good partner and cooperate with each other. The chance of success will be much higher.\\n\\nEntrepreneurship, knowing that you are suitable to be a leader or a manager can accelerate the development of the enterprise.\\n\\nIn fact, most successful companies in this world are created by a leader and a manager.\\n\\nFor example, Jack Ma is a leader, and the person behind him is the manager. Jack Ma was not a manager of a company. Jobs was a salesman, but Apple computers and mobile phones were not made by him, but by Wozniak. In other words, Jobs is a leader, and Wozniak Nicoya is a technology manager.\",\"timestamp\":1634797033,\"title\":\"How to improve your logical thinking\"},\"digest\":\"HEo188TLnUKrpyP_D2vEzyhxoNGiM3InaRJeXVnDx_M\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"kwN2cSKvFTg6W103kTtlyBl5Vl3020w9tM7deZx4fcOyHMmpnYuIz4trbu8EcKadRqNTsbd-luHdTwzsSHtzwA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"HEo188TLnUKrpyP_D2vEzyhxoNGiM3InaRJeXVnDx_M\"}"
