"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Computer students should not be unfamiliar with \\\"virtual machines\\\". \\\"Virtual machines\\\" refer to complete computer systems with complete hardware system functions that are simulated by software and run in a completely isolated environment.\\n\\nIn layman's terms, a virtual machine is a virtual machine that we have simulated through software that is exactly the same as our personal computer. It has the same software and hardware resources as an actual physical computer.\\n\\nAfter entering the virtual system, all our daily operations can be carried out in this brand new and independent virtual system, which can be installed and operated independently, data saved and so on.\\n\\nIn this way, we can toss in the virtual machine as much as we want, and we are not afraid of all kinds of viruses and attacks. The big deal is to reinstall the virtual machine and it will not have any impact on the real system.\\nWe know that the Bitcoin network is like a huge distributed ledger that is updated in real time. Computers anywhere in the world can be connected to the Bitcoin system via the Internet. It has the characteristics of decentralization, non-tampering, and openness and transparency.\\n\\nThere is no virtual machine in this network. Bitcoin's more main function is to record and store transaction data on the chain at any time.\\n\\nThe Ethereum virtual machine, as its name suggests, is an abstract machine built on the Ethereum blockchain, which can isolate the programs running on it from each other and separate from the main chain.\",\"timestamp\":1634479277,\"title\":\"What is the Ethereum virtual machine?\"},\"digest\":\"GNDx_q7RqCRLk4pstzHinw6iJkFMvgMb_0-YgiFld2U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD4bb7f64c14E8Fdc02AA7c53153F7eD4Bb8d1744\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3sbnZiCM2e49JSXz6cny_WtotrutWNT8fgix_eyYR44\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"sxXE2PePI_jdm5HYqSJD0EbPBfjsL3935wSw-FQP8F8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"UGdi22UtaZq2ZsCCRGcAL7BVJlQ4VOkk05ZL3e23br4GfnfbrDm10ypLYonXUi2knAlUo1a-fiy5m_q05Bitew\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xecbfef621de0c56a2a11469cd0225c6d199b6fbd0b5e2249a676b02031906f8127df8cd93b49b79132ad4347a3662f00572f25bd824e078bfaa0fdb60da1026b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3sbnZiCM2e49JSXz6cny_WtotrutWNT8fgix_eyYR44\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"sxXE2PePI_jdm5HYqSJD0EbPBfjsL3935wSw-FQP8F8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"GNDx_q7RqCRLk4pstzHinw6iJkFMvgMb_0-YgiFld2U\"}"
