"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Until February 1st, 2022, you (yes, YOU) can (secretly) put your Ethereum in either the letter **A** or **B**.\\n\\nWhy should you give your ETH to a letter, you ask? Because you want to get that ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’° (or rather, ÎžÎžÎž). If your side is the **least popular** (has the least ETH), you win the other sideâ€™s ETH.\\n\\nChoose a letter [here](https://www.avsb.xyz/).\\n\\n## How it works\\n\\nThe game works in 3 phases according to a Commit-Reveal scheme (all dates 2022).\\n\\n**1st: Hidden Voting**\\n\\n* Until Feb 1st, players put ETH behind A or B (in increments of 0.05Îž)\\n* Choices are hidden (only cryptographic commitments posted)\\n\\n**2nd: The Reveal**\\n\\n* After Feb 1st until Feb 15th, players reveal what side they chose\\n* Reveal verified by checking cryptographic commitment\\n* Side with **less** ETH revealed decreed winner\\n\\n**3rd: Payout**\\n\\n* After Feb 15th, players of the winning side can claim their prize\\n* Only players that revealed in Phase 2 can claim\\n* Prize is proportional to the ETH they put in\\n* 95% of funds are paid out to winners (5% founder fee)\\n\\nAnd of course, all of the above happens trustlessly.\\n\\n## Why does this exist\\n\\nTLDR; this exists to pit people against each other and see what we can learn about each other in the process.\\n\\nThere are a number of miscellaneous, somewhat unrelated reasons we think this game should exist in the big bad world.\\n\\n* we were bored\\n* will people play both sides (lower variance, possibly negative EV due to fees) or will only people with a strong conviction play?\\n  * keep in mind, one wallet address = one vote\\n* what sort of reasoning will people use to choose their voting side and amount?\\n* crypto should be used generally to scalably test game theoretic questions, just for fun\\n* how rationally do crypto users behave?\\n* are people more concerned with profit, or community and narrative?\\n\\nBesides, maybe A and B represent something else. Something larger. Maybe A is mAinstream and B is suBversive. Maybe mountAins are better than Beaches. Amazon vs Blockchain. cAr vs Bike. Or maybe A is just A, and B is just B.\\n\\n## Implementation Quirks\\n\\nAs with all games based on smart contracts, there are some minor implementation details and edge cases that players should be aware of.\\n\\n* technically, players can reveal their vote anytime before Feb 15th\\n  * however, revealing early is shooting yourself in the foot ... unless you do it on purpose for a reason ðŸ¤”\\n* the founder fee (5%) is collected game end, during payout\\n* if no sides reveal any ETH, the founder receives the contract balance\\n* if only one side reveals no ETH, then the other side wins\\n* **if there is an equal amount of revealed ETH behind both sides, the first person to claim a payout decides who the winner of the game is**\\n\\nWith love,\\n\\nsome bored kids\",\"timestamp\":1641277533,\"title\":\"â˜¯ A vs B\"},\"digest\":\"rsEli2FSniDMy26xDg7iqKYz4UVMHXFsljQIaE_hRcM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7B91649D893B2e4Feef78b6891dE383d5a8491eE\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8DKt2ZINe0fFImufKWARnVQ06cARv2oyt-Gj41bKbKQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gTF41GpKIhUT8w1bXvUu6OFDEgwVu15VF90Ee4PiAvw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"iV911sk_k3dwcXv2ym-G0H8QHQUD2vtCf6Li02GdXk9Ba1mzBANuAm4gXm6vIQ08saTRMsWF9FHIfOv-uMA74g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x42f9cd327cffbca12e10c27a0d06d0c6968121f64e98e07b5866e9748b40407d0b5e7dbea0735c1896c1a1755a6710f5eeff4db05759079748c67a4a552af68f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8DKt2ZINe0fFImufKWARnVQ06cARv2oyt-Gj41bKbKQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gTF41GpKIhUT8w1bXvUu6OFDEgwVu15VF90Ee4PiAvw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rsEli2FSniDMy26xDg7iqKYz4UVMHXFsljQIaE_hRcM\"}"
