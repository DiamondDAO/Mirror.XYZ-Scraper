"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"You know him, of course?\\\" continued Estelle, after a slight pause.\\n\\n\\\"Who does not know him, madame?\\\" said the painter.\\n\\n\\\"Knows him like his double,\\\" remarked Mistigris.\\n\\n\\\"Monsieur Grindot told me your name,\\\" said Madame Moreau to the\\n\\npainter. \\\"But--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Joseph Bridau,\\\" he replied, wondering with what sort of woman he had\\n\\nto do.\\n\\nMistigris began to rebel internally against the patronizing manner of\\n\\nthe steward's wife; but he waited, like Bridau, for some word which\\n\\nmight give him his cue; one of those words \\\"de singe a dauphin\\\" which\\n\\nartists, cruel, born-observers of the ridiculous--the pabulum of their\\n\\npencils--seize with such avidity. Meantime Estelle's clumsy hands and\\n\\nfeet struck their eyes, and presently a word, or phrase or two,\\n\\nbetrayed her past, and quite out of keeping with the elegance of her\\n\\ndress, made the two young fellows aware of their prey. A single glance\\n\\nat each other was enough to arrange a scheme that they should take\\n\\nEstelle seriously on her own ground, and thus find amusement enough\\n\\nduring the time of their stay.\\n\\n\\\"You say you love art, madame; perhaps you cultivate it successfully,\\\"\\n\\nsaid Joseph Bridau.\\n\\n\\\"No. Without being neglected, my education was purely commercial; but\\n\\nI have so profound and delicate a sense of art that Monsieur Schinner\\n\\nalways asked me, when he had finished a piece of work, to give him my\\n\\nopinion on it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Just as Moliere consulted La Foret,\\\" said Mistigris.\\n\\nNot knowing that La Foret was Moliere's servant-woman, Madame Moreau\\n\\ninclined her head graciously, showing that in her ignorance she\\n\\naccepted the speech as a compliment.\\n\\n\\\"Didn't he propose to 'croquer' you?\\\" asked Bridau. \\\"Painters are\\n\\neager enough after handsome women.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What may you mean by such language?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In the studios we say croquer, craunch, nibble, for sketching,\\\"\\n\\ninterposed Mistigris, with an insinuating air, \\\"and we are always\\n\\nwanting to croquer beautiful heads. That's the origin of the\\n\\nexpression, 'She is pretty enough to eat.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I was not aware of the origin of the term,\\\" she replied, with the\\n\\nsweetest glance at Mistigris.\\n\\n\\\"My pupil here,\\\" said Bridau, \\\"Monsieur Leon de Lora, shows a\\n\\nremarkable talent for portraiture. He would be too happy, I know, to\\n\\nleave you a souvenir of our stay by painting your charming head,\\n\\nmadame.\\\"\\n\\nJoseph Bridau made a sign to Mistigris which meant: \\\"Come, sail in,\\n\\nand push the matter; she is not so bad in looks, this woman.\\\"\\n\\nAccepting the glance, Leon de Lora slid down upon the sofa beside\\n\\nEstelle and took her hand, which she permitted.\\n\\n\\\"Oh! madame, if you would like to offer a surprise to your husband,\\n\\nand will give me a few secret sittings I would endeavor to surpass\\n\\nmyself. You are so beautiful, so fresh, so charming! A man without any\\n\\ntalent might become a genius in painting you. He would draw from your\\n\\neyes--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We must paint your dear children in the arabesques,\\\" said Bridau,\\n\\ninterrupting Mistigris.\\n\\n\\\"I would rather have them in the salon; but perhaps I am indiscreet in\\n\\nasking it,\\\" she replied, looking at Bridau coquettishly.\\n\\n\\\"Beauty, madame, is a sovereign whom all painters worship; it has\\n\\nunlimited claims upon them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They are both charming,\\\" thought Madame Moreau. \\\"Do you enjoy\\n\\ndriving? Shall I take you through the woods, after dinner, in my\\n\\ncarriage?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh! oh! oh!\\\" cried Mistigris, in three ecstatic tones. \\\"Why, Presles\\n\\nwill prove our terrestrial paradise.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"With an Eve, a fair, young, fascinating woman,\\\" added Bridau.\\n\\nJust as Madame Moreau was bridling, and soaring to the seventh heaven,\\n\\nshe was recalled like a kite by a twitch at its line.\\n\\n\\\"Madame!\\\" cried her maid-servant, bursting into the room.\\n\\n\\\"Rosalie,\\\" said her mistress, \\\"who allowed you to come here without\\n\\nbeing sent for?\\\"\\n\\nRosalie paid no heed to the rebuke, but whispered in her mistress's\\n\\near:--\\n\\n\\\"The count is at the chateau.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Has he asked for me?\\\" said the steward's wife.\\n\\n\\\"No, madame; but he wants his trunk and the key of his apartment.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then give them to him,\\\" she replied, making an impatient gesture to\\n\\nhide her real trouble.\\n\\n\\\"Mamma! here's Oscar Husson,\\\" said her youngest son, bringing in\\n\\nOscar, who turned as red as a poppy on seeing the two artists in\\n\\nevening dress.\\n\\n\\\"Oh! so you have come, my little Oscar,\\\" said Estelle, stiffly. \\\"I\\n\\nhope you will now go and dress,\\\" she added, after looking at him\\n\\ncontemptuously from head to foot. \\\"Your mother, I presume, has not\\n\\naccustomed you to dine in such clothes as those.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\" cried the cruel Mistigris, \\\"a future diplomatist knows the\\n\\nsaying that 'two coats are better than none.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How do you mean, a future diplomatist?\\\" exclaimed Madame Moreau.\\n\\nPoor Oscar had tears in his eyes as he looked in turn from Joseph to\\n\\nLeon.\\n\\n\\\"Merely a joke made in travelling,\\\" replied Joseph, who wanted to save\\n\\nOscar's feelings out of pity.\\n\\n\\\"The boy just wanted to be funny like the rest of us, and he blagued,\\n\\nthat's all,\\\" said Mistigris.\\n\\n\\\"Madame,\\\" said Rosalie, returning to the door of the salon, \\\"his\\n\\nExcellency has ordered dinner for eight, and wants it served at six\\n\\no'clock. What are we to do?\\\"\\n\\nDuring Estelle's conference with her head-woman the two artists and\\n\\nOscar looked at each other in consternation; their glances were\\n\\nexpressive of terrible apprehension.\\n\\n\\\"His Excellency! who is he?\\\" said Joseph Bridau.\\n\\n\\\"Why, Monsieur le Comte de Serizy, of course,\\\" replied little Moreau.\\n\\n\\\"Could it have been the count in the coucou?\\\" said Leon de Lora.\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\" exclaimed Oscar, \\\"the Comte de Serizy always travels in his own\\n\\ncarriage with four horses.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How did the Comte de Serizy get here?\\\" said the painter to Madame\\n\\nMoreau, when she returned, much discomfited, to the salon.\\n\\n\\\"I am sure I do not know,\\\" she said. \\\"I cannot explain to myself this\\n\\nsudden arrival; nor do I know what has brought him-- And Moreau not\\n\\nhere!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"His Excellency wishes Monsieur Schinner to come over to the chateau,\\\"\\n\\nsaid the gardener, coming to the door of the salon. \\\"And he begs\\n\\nMonsieur Schinner to give him the pleasure to dine with him; also\\n\\nMonsieur Mistigris.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Done for!\\\" cried the rapin, laughing. \\\"He whom we took for a\\n\\nbourgeois in the coucou was the count. You may well say: 'Sour are the\\n\\ncurses of perversity.'\\\"\\n\\nOscar was very nearly changed to a pillar of salt; for, at this\\n\\nrevelation, his throat felt saltier than the sea.\\n\\n\\\"And you, who talked to him about his wife's lovers and his skin\\n\\ndiseases!\\\" said Mistigris, turning on Oscar.\\n\\n\\\"What does he mean?\\\" exclaimed the steward's wife, gazing after the\\n\\ntwo artists, who went away laughing at the expression of Oscar's face.\\n\\nOscar remained dumb, confounded, stupefied, hearing nothing, though\\n\\nMadame Moreau questioned him and shook him violently by his arm, which\\n\\nshe caught and squeezed. She gained nothing, however, and was forced\\n\\nto leave him in the salon without an answer, for Rosalie appeared\\n\\nagain, to ask for linen and silver, and to beg she would go herself\\n\\nand see that the multiplied orders of the count were executed. All the\\n\\nhousehold, together with the gardeners and the concierge and his wife,\\n\\nwere going and coming in a confusion that may readily be imagined. The\\n\\nmaster had fallen upon his own house like a bombshell.\\n\\nFrom the top of the hill near La Cave, where he left the coach, the\\n\\ncount had gone, by the path through the woods well-known to him, to\\n\\nthe house of his gamekeeper. The keeper was amazed when he saw his\\n\\nreal master.\\n\\n\\\"Is Moreau here?\\\" said the count. \\\"I see his horse.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, monseigneur; he means to go to Moulineaux before dinner, and he\\n\\nhas left his horse here while he went to the chateau to give a few\\n\\norders.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you value your place,\\\" said the count, \\\"you will take that horse\\n\\nand ride at once to Beaumont, where you will deliver to Monsieur\\n\\nMargueron the note that I shall now write.\\\"\\n\\nSo saying the count entered the keeper's lodge and wrote a line,\\n\\nfolding it in a way impossible to open without detection, and gave it\\n\\nto the man as soon as he saw him in the saddle.\",\"timestamp\":1637316413,\"title\":\"\\nTOO insipid.
