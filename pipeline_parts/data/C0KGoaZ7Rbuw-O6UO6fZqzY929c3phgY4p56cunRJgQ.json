"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Last year, I went to the countryside to get my internship, my duty was to be a teacher, teaching the middle school students English. At first, I was not used to the environment, it was so different from the city I live in, but I didnâ€™t want to give up, so I insisted and got used to the new environment. On the first day of being a teacher, I was a little shy, but the students were kind, they cooperated with me so much, I was so moved. In the coming days, I became more and more confident, I learned to be a good teacher, got along with the students, we became friends soon. When I came home, the students were sad, I also felt sad. I am so thankful for the internship experience, it fosters me with the ability to get used to the new environment.\",\"timestamp\":1634967705,\"title\":\"My Internship Experience\"},\"digest\":\"0cuVEfcqHYHUxvFxi46tJHIkdpDGrRHV2_bHahftUK8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5846b837DB8882704aa1a85C0BD39588c068360F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4rLCfnePI0lHHjRsqi7H4sVzQIy41apCIfiVpYROzzM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QBH6QGE5fUO5msI76qqnAnl1bKrE74duOycTu2sC_-Q\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"M1JW68VTYhxmkTQ731F-3eKHAGQf12hmXscjlm8IniwQjd5EAjCHYVIYus_lZ3X85pUpVuNCJ5v9jRYHLEipQg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x36a823f4d4cdade326f52a3a2d736effe18486b8ad2656560a925a9be0ea6b7b1f1af427ec66c59e60c2cdc3081a3a62f4e4e9cc96e0410f3827175daf6dc3f41b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4rLCfnePI0lHHjRsqi7H4sVzQIy41apCIfiVpYROzzM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QBH6QGE5fUO5msI76qqnAnl1bKrE74duOycTu2sC_-Q\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"0cuVEfcqHYHUxvFxi46tJHIkdpDGrRHV2_bHahftUK8\"}"
