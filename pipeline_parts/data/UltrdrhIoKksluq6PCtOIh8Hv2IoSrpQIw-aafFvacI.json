"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Web 3 enables a new depth in engaging with creative projects. The new metric for the success of an artwork, film, or story is no longer just the amount of interactions it has, rewards can now also be seen in the depths of those interactions. This incentivizes projects to facilitate and encourage creation on top of their initial work, leading to deeper creative interactions, and the promotion of derivative work, changing the role of the traditional passive audience into an active community.\\n\\nOf course, communities existed in Web 2 and before. Youtubers have subscribers, and authors have email lists. These groups can interact with the creator and with each other, but these interactions very rarely get to the core of a creator’s work, the creative process itself. Web 3 is beginning to change to this.\\n\\nWith the tokenization of creative work though NFTs and social tokens, creator’s audiences have grown to expect additional utility from their tokens. Often there is a commitment from the creator to forming a community by offering access to a token-gated discord, but tokens can also act as invitations into aspects of the creative process, or licenses to create on top of existing work.\\n\\nThis invitation for community members into the creative process subverts the traditional roles of the artist and their audience, providing a greater sense of ownership to the community members, elevating them to the role of co-creator. Co-creation is a spectrum, with some projects being flat, mostly community-created and organized, and others having a hierarchy similar to traditional creative structures, with some community involvement.\\n\\nThe original artist or creator can still play a large role in what the community creates, designing specific interactions that can come from the tokens, or the initial project. The continued role of the creator can be seen in projects like Society of the Hourglass and their collaboration with Jumpcut Media, where their community is helping to write and shape an animated series. Further down the spectrum the continued role of the artist can even be seen in the lore hidden by Dom Hofmann in the Loot Project smart contract, which led to projects around the 16 Orders and Genesis Adventurers.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z7CQtrDVE7y-RZmbJAQPV.png?height=1501&width=3001)\\n\\nIt is in this gray area, the blending of the artist and their community that Web 3 truly has the chance to enter new creative territory, deepening the bonds not only between community members and the original creator, but also between one another. David Phelps referred to these types of NFT projects saying “It’s not the tree you’re buying, it’s the seed for the tree.” These projects are not delivering a final product, they are often providing the key to a series of creative interactions which on the grandest scale can lead to an ever-expanding fictional world, an infinite roadmap.\\n\\nCommunity involvement through co-creation is not a value-add to every project. This process will require trial and error on the part of many creators, and it certainly increases the potential to diminish from the overall quality of a work, but the potential for a stronger community and more diverse creative work on the other side justifies the learning curve necessary. Most creative projects, films, stories, artworks, etc, will continue along fixed lines between creator and audience member, some will design deeper creative interactions with their work for the community, and some still will be almost entirely community driven, based only on a spark or a prompt from the initial creator.\\n\\nThough co-creation has always existed, Web 3 has brought new attention to it, providing concrete markers of ownership for community members to shape and continue creative projects. Co-creation projects, specifically those that center around tokens, require new platforms, contexts and tools for those tokens and their unique interactions. Outside of a few creative technologists, most creatives and artists are held back from launching projects like these because of the technical barrier. Bridging this divide was my inspiration for starting Ensemble, a product studio for the co-creator economy. Ensemble will be one of many working in the largely untrodden co-creation space, building tools for creators, for their communities to create with them and their work.\\n\\nThe place of the lone auteur will remain, but much of the compelling creative work on the horizon will be co-created.\\n\\nThank you for reading, more to come.\\n\\n\\n______________\\n\\nThank you to [David](https://twitter.com/divine_economy) for chatting with myself and the Ensemble community about co-creation earlier this year, and for suffering occasional cow memes from me.\\n\\nThanks to [Sofia](https://twitter.com/vialpandotweets) for her counsel and creative insights.\\n\\nAnd [follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/mackxdav) while you’re here.\",\"timestamp\":1642521305,\"title\":\"The Co-Creation Thesis\"},\"digest\":\"fxEl3bkqzkMVpjw3pZKud9sdGJqeRNJFlnEnIHqLot4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2F66e6Ab6d1Fa0dCD37DedD72293372bA4D63063\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"vXEslj0QbEnIoBwu9wutv6jJofLpJEmnWLBkMK0Dt0s\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eP2LawYf-b5dbA9IUnzX2wipP2WGnVlZ386xdAABDFo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"laWHgsy82Hqc5sUZTLgSYUDGlA-Ul4Pa-HTcuNEYdCJ1HTyazj9xuLnsX5FvxJnQxTvsZoKibKJpCT-bcGecpA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x98ecc923a2241f071124a49508635e37b7673601d7d1d2723d6666bb8512d63370654ad1dbb35dc688a9945f1548de582c0d305fd5fc4c037fbbaa08cf0e1e951b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"vXEslj0QbEnIoBwu9wutv6jJofLpJEmnWLBkMK0Dt0s\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eP2LawYf-b5dbA9IUnzX2wipP2WGnVlZ386xdAABDFo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"flX93MQtKLlAWidnWpZyV5UAMYz91t3h7iIDY0g5d4A\"}"
