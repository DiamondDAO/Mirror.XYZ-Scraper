Google has[ 5.6 billion](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-search-statistics#:\\\\~:text=Google%20doesn't%20share%20its,trillion%20global%20searches%20per%20year.) daily searches. Presearch has a 6% daily search volume compared to Google.\\n\\nHard to compete with that difference, especially in a B2B marketing environment that will lower average monthly search volumes. For perspective, even Bing is only 900M searches per day, a 16% difference from the Google giant’s daily search volume, and even Bing is overlooked by many search marketers. (\\\\*Many, not all, and to Bing’s credit- their analytics are far better than Google).\\n\\nMaybe for B2C targeting keywords with a huge MSV, Presearch ads could be an interesting play right now because of the pricing structure. Let’s take a closer look at pricing.\\n\\nUsers can earn money simply by searching. While only a quarter, the average person searches 3–4 times a day. Wouldn’t it be nice to earn $30 from this activity instead of it all going to Google?\\n\\nThe cost is the missed interest opportunity from staking. Staking generates an impressive yearly return (though I struggled to find an exact number, it’s likely related to broader tokenomics than a set APY). To purchase an ad, you must stake tokens.\\n\\nThis neat approach creates a powerful incentive for token demand but until more users enter the network, I won’t have the fun of poking around here much more.\\n\\nOver time, I think the economics play out here for Presearch to be an interesting search marketing channel. This timeline may be 3–5, 10+ years out though.\\n\\nRead more about the project and their CMC partnership here: <https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-presearch-pre-features-tokenomics-and-price-prediction>\\n\\nBetter yet, if you start to test Presearch ad network, share your experience with a comment below!\\n\\n_ \\n Photo by [Anna Nekrashevich](https://www.pexels.com/@anna-nekrashevich?utm_content=attributionCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=pexels) from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/calculator-and-magnifying-glass-on-survey-sheets-6801636/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=pexels)\\n\\n[ \\n ](https://medium.com/@dazedconfused?source=post_sidebar--------------------------post_sidebar-----------)\",\"timestamp\":1633544505,\"title\":\"Presearch Ad Network: Real-World Test\"},\"digest\":\"kfkfrTZdEcnAjnFcEI-eVBj0R23xazyjg8UPFaXJhLc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xAeA14896B33913Afb74E686d6ED7BaC53C0d43b8\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kRN0g2ULKp_gXrgoHdwxlvBEo0FyxPa_rg2-Rq203Ug\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Z1khcHiSucrG57H7ZCxiAk-3cE5YHSS1aMCp4GxhfyY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"qj0G5Fsv59tAZkdhAI_8iB2M9U-xdHFKb3TQpGAN5I-0_cWqBL-t6Imq6rvJiGjDwM1cPr_nuVVbDU9BdczAyw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x32256defe6d1b73214c5754bd38320502ef19bef1434498006fd878e6e0818433a0b5016707b89207daf31bdd549b78e6d6655a8fad32891cfb617bfa4fcfc0e1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kRN0g2ULKp_gXrgoHdwxlvBEo0FyxPa_rg2-Rq203Ug\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Z1khcHiSucrG57H7ZCxiAk-3cE5YHSS1aMCp4GxhfyY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"kfkfrTZdEcnAjnFcEI-eVBj0R23xazyjg8UPFaXJhLc\"}"
