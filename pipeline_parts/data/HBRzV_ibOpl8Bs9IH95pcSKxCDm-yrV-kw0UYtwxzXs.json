"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"I am Momo, never silent.\\\"Little Momo has big pride, a \\\"big banyan tree on a little meadow.Little Momo used to lie on the top of the tree and look up at the stars all alone forever.This is no different today.Momo, never silent Momo grew older, more and more lonely and silent.Thirteen years ago, Momo's mother Qin shi dreamed of a white light entering her body, and this world had momo this new life.After October, Momo arrives as scheduled, and as expected, he shows his difference from the ordinary people right from the beginning.Different from other children, little Momo did not cry or laugh when he was just born into this world, but was silent.Perhaps for this reason, Momo's father named him Momo.And in the mother's interpretation, it became the meaning of never silent.Maybe that's just a good hope.Never silent for Momo is just a little ridiculous words, every time to speak of all with a bitter taste, is the biggest sadness in the young heart.Little Momo in big banyan tree top strong smile, smile some bitter, some astringent.Momo is unusual from the moment he is born, so his parents have great expectations for him.But as Momo grew older, that expectation turned to disappointment.But Momo's parents did not abandon him and remained loving to him.But closed the door for him, forever!A door they hoped Momo would never be silent.The parents' love became a heavy pressure, and the stubborn little Momo demanded to live alone after he was too early to understand.He always hoped that with his own efforts, once again open the door that has been closed for him.Little Momo took off a banyan leaf and put it to his mouth to chew the bitter taste.He looked up at the bright starry sky, his eyes full of reluctance and doubt.Why, there were so many stars, so bright, but not one of them would lend him any [strength.It](http://strength.It) was as if the whole world had shut its doors and Windows for him, and there was nothing but solitary darkness in his world.There were so many stars, so bright, and little Momo's place was always in that dark corner without stars.The banyan leaves did not taste good.Little Momo spat it out with some anger.He clenched his fist and pounded the dull tree with his childish power.There were only a few breezes in the night sky, and it seemed that little Momo's face was bright with starlight.Should a worthless person feel inferior?What is inferiority?Little Momo didn't know.But they all said little Momo was proud, conceited.What is pride?Neither did little Momo.They said little Momo was a loser, who never kept his eyes on the ground when he walked, but always had a chin up in his face.Little Momo didn't know what they were talking about. Little Momo just liked to look at the sky.What's wrong with that?Just like the roadside grass can only be trampled on by others forever, there is no stretch to the sky of the right?And they said, yes.Roadside weeds should only be trampled!And who said that?Little Momo did not listen, nor would he.His chin still lifted slightly to the sky, a lonely and stubborn curve, so young, so fragile.Maybe the world can't tolerate a different voice.Little Momo felt excluded, excluded from the world, not just from the solitude of that starry [sky.So](http://sky.So) little Momo finally became more and more silent, more and more lonely.Gradually, only one person climbed to the top of the tree and looked at the bright sky, which had closed all the doors and Windows for little Momo.This is an era as bright as the stars, this is an era of stars.Stars give people unimaginable power and life.When the stars close all doors for a person, it is equal to the whole world closes all doors for this person.This is the consensus of the whole world, the consensus beyond [reproach.So](http://reproach.So) brutal a consensus of no tolerance.For unwilling ordinary teenager, hollowness and beautiful starry sky cruelty unimaginable.Stubborn and proud, little Momo can only quietly hide in the shadow of his [parents.It](http://parents.It) was the only kindness little Momo's parents could show him after their disappointment.But little Momo is so unwilling.Like a dream, there is always a voice in the consciousness of small Momo rang ----- you with invincible, undefeated life!Yes, little Momo always thought with some self-mockery: I am truly invincible.Because most people of my age or even younger than me can do the astral force exercise, astral force washing, and even astral force entering the mystery.Who else would be in their own class?And the same as their own useless people, mostly only one or two years old children.There are even some brilliant geniuses who are already star-struck when they are born.Think oneself so different from ordinary people is indeed different from ordinary people, just a little weak.And their own level all are still can not walk children, and how will be their opponents?This peer invincible seems to make [sense.As](http://sense.As) for a lifetime of invincibility?It was a joke, a joke that made little Momo feel a little cold.Little Momo did not know that he was no match for some gifted children who had not yet finished astral entry.But little Momo had seen too little to know.Otherwise, it's always been more self-deprecating.But only self-deprecation?Little Momo couldn't say.Because that one voice made little Momo feel different every [time.It](http://time.It) was not as loud or serious as his father's voice, but there was something about it that could not be questioned.If it were not for small Momo's own situation is too poor, small Momo can not help but doubt whether he is doomed to the same rank invincible, undefeated all his life.Because one voice has been supporting the poor stubbornness of little Momo?Maybe.Maybe not.Every time little Momo wanted to lower his head, it was as if some force forced him to lift it and look up into the sky.Whenever little Momo wanted to cry in front of people, something told him to look at the clouds and let the wind take away his tears and sadness.Maybe the power is real.Little Momo couldn't say, but he clung to his fragile stubbornness.When god closes a door for a person, he also opens a window for him.Under the night sky, a door opened in the cottage beside the meadow, and a warm light poured out.A little head popped out, kind of cute.This is little Momo's window.For years little Momo had not lived here alone, with his servant, Tanner.Tanner came out of the hut and shouted to Momo from the big banyan tree, \\\"Master, the water is ready and you can come down to bathe.\\\"Little Momo took another angry look at the stars and slowly straightened himself up to go back into the cabin.The stars above the big banyan tree are so bright and bright.When little Momo straightened up the moment, as if to give a person an illusion, the whole starry sky will be attracted by little Momo down in general...\",\"timestamp\":1642130494,\"title\":\"[Water Air]Drop
