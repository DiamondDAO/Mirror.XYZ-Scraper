And the company's counteroffer? Predictability at the expense of my individual production [scale](https://store.legal.thomsonreuters.com/law-products/news-views/corporate-counsel/employer-and-employee-ownership-of-intellectual-property-not-as-easy-as-you-think), time with family, and creativity. Hmmm.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1399383928880963584?s=20](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1399383928880963584?s=20)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## a BIG MOOD\\n\\nIt turns out many of us are having doubts about work. Is it the pandemic? The endless months in hibernation and [dangerous introspection](https://time.com/5925218/covid-19-pandemic-life-decisions/)? Or maybe the realization that once the noise of the office dies down, what's left is rise and grind? Either way, this feeling of dissatisfaction with the current working environments is rampant.\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n> *In a report called The Next Great Disruption Is Hybrid Work – [Are We Ready?](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index), Microsoft found that as much as 54% of Generation Z workers and 41% of the entire global workforce could be considering handing in their resignation.*\\n>\\n> *Similarly, a UK and Ireland survey found that [38%](https://hr.personio.de/hubfs/EN_Downloads/202104_HRStudy_UKI.pdf) of employees were planning to leave their jobs in the next six months to a year, while a US survey reported that [42%](https://news.prudential.com/presskits/pulse-american-worker-survey-is-this-working.htm) of employees would quit if their company didn’t offer remote working options long term.*\\n>\\n> Source: World Economic Forum\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1433501296422801411?s=20](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1433501296422801411?s=20)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nI was too embarrassed to tell my manager I was going into [web3](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/) directly when I spoke with them.\\n\\nI told them a half-truth instead: \\\"This is not the right role for me. I think the team needs folks who want to manage tech-support tickets and enjoy catering to customers on a daily basis. You need a team that feels challenged managing accounts...”\\n\\n***The better and more important half of the story has two parts:***\\n\\n1. The company is building technology for an age that is coming to an end, and\\n2. I am no longer OK selling my personal work to any company, stealing my ability to scale expertise and wealth.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/agorismlabs/status/1427009765075570696?s=20](https://twitter.com/agorismlabs/status/1427009765075570696?s=20)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Note 1: Hear thee, yo, the hype is fr. Your tech is for the yesteryears.\\n\\nI joined this job last year. It was very near my dream job: tech startup, employee #22, remote, in an industry that I'm passionate about, and with cutting-edge API-first technology for its industry.\\n\\nAnd yet, I have quit for the uncertainty of web3 a bare 9 months later. Or might I say, I have succumbed to the certainty of participating in something bigger, more important, at a pivotal point in our collective history.\\n\\n![It's about to get weird.

It's cultish, weird, and colorful. But as you dig deeper, into the Discord servers of [avatar-specific](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/) communities for example, you'll find that the hype is real.\\n\\nBy real, I mean millions upon millions of dollars of investment by [top VC firms](https://a16z.com/crypto/) and personal wealth into tight-knit [pseudonymous](https://thehub.ca/in-the-know/2021-06-10/what-is-the-pseudonymous-economy-balaji-srinivasan/) communities, [fun](https://rainbow.me/) technology, and [micro-economies](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/gWY6Kfebs9wHdfoZZswfiLTBVzfKiyFaIwNf2q8JpgI). The folks working in this space have glassy eyes, looking beyond the horizon to something larger than themselves.\\n\\n![A new \\\"American West\\\" (Source: https://www.americanwest.amdigital.co.uk/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f637a315-997b-4b2a-a878-732235dd596d.png?height=362&width=980)\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1424458503922536455?s=20](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1424458503922536455?s=20)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs I became enveloped in this new ecosystem (shoutout to[ @creatorcabins](https://twitter.com/creatorcabins) and [@forefront__](https://twitter.com/forefront__)), it became increasingly clear that the technology my company is building is outdated. Specifically, the company is automating outdated enterprise operations.\\n\\n> *\\\"Am I going to spend my time, energy, focus, and life building something for outdated methods of collaboration?\\\"*\\n\\nThe company will no doubt be very successful: they will disrupt the current market and become an enterprise leader. However, it is focusing on dominating an industry from a previous generation.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/stefdelev/status/1431870223305658368?s=21](https://twitter.com/stefdelev/status/1431870223305658368?s=21)\\n\\nOnce I became aware of this, it became impossible to sit by the sidelines. New [digital-native organizations](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-dao-of-daos) are forming, maturing, and growing — and this is where the future of the global economy is being defined.\\n\\nMy enthusiasm can’t be contained any longer. If you’re a bit of an internet nerd like me, here are [some](https://sotonye.substack.com/p/if-einstein-had-the-internet-an-interview) [excellent](https://otherinter.net/squad-wealth/) [articles](https://ath.mirror.xyz/mDu_nGsWpjvF-KaPLADwxeAMfze3UJOtTAQi2CwPwWc) that might inspire you.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Note 2: From employee to free agent\\n\\nHype aside, there is a larger second reason I am quitting [web2](https://dev.to/dabit3/the-new-creator-economy-daos-community-ownership-and-cryptoeconomics-lnl).\\n\\nTraditional organizations offer a trade-off for employees: You get paid a fixed capped amount (hourly, salary, bonus, equity), and the company retains your [intellectual property in perpetuity](https://www.uschamber.com/co/start/strategy/can-employees-own-intellectual-property#:\\\\~:text=If%20that%20worker%20is%20directly,or%20product%20for%20the%20business.). A fair exchange?\\n\\nPrior to the web, [I strongly believed this was a good bargain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm) due to transaction costs. Corporations and businesses paid you (on average) more than your ability to market and scale work across your lifespan. In other words, the payment was worth it. If you tried to create, market, sell, and scale individually, it would be too expensive (and you'd likely fail).\\n\\nNow, as with all things, the internet has [changed the trade-off](https://passion.io/blog/passion-economy-future-of-work#:\\\\~:text=The%20Passion%20Economy%20is%20a,exponentially%20and%20earn%20passive%20income.&text=The%20gig%20economy%20demands%20participants,horizon%20for%20their%20next%20one.)) dynamics. Individuals will slowly, and then suddenly, realize that their knowledge, craft, passion has accessible, monetizable niches. Companies are struggling to internalize this and, as a result, will have a great wave of [resignations](https://twitter.com/JoshuaOgundu/status/1429959048024125484?s=20) just like mine.\\n\\nMany companies think that increasing salaries or giving out larger bonuses will fix this, but it won't. Why? Because it is a question about ownership, [belonging](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-cooperation-economy-), and self-worth. It is not a question about take-home cash. The next-generation organizations understand this intuitively and emerge accordingly.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1421909057053597698?s=20](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder/status/1421909057053597698?s=20)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nTo better visualize the impact on organization dynamics, consider this 2x2 grid. On one axis, we have transaction costs (x-axis), and on the other we have organization group size (y-axis).\\n\\n![A 2x2, because I'm a consultant.

New organisms emerge, and participation pathways become possible.\\n\\nIn a traditional setting, you would need an interview and then a defined role to offset the cost of onboarding and coordination.\\n\\nBut now, I can write a single article as part of CabinDAO with no permission, get people to consent to the publication, and publish in a matter of days.

I invite you to follow our journey at[ folklore.mirror.xyz](http://folklore.mirror.xyz) and support the mission.\\n\\nI'm not sure how this journey into web3 will turn out.
