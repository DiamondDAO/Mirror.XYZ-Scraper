His prosperity results from his capacity to adapt through his high intelligence.\\n\\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, humanity created machines activated by a fossil energy which tenfold the animal and human forces. The Revolution took place in the sovereign states which replaced the previous feudal regime. The states landed the soil to create a regime of production based on private ownership and liberation of individual initiative.\\n\\nMainly supported by real estate property, wealth still today resides in lands, mines and factories. Private property is concentrated in a few families that monopolize private initiative through the old industrial property system (patents and trademarks). The Industrial Revolution generated high growth but strong inequalities. Human creativity was under-exploited because it contradicts the interests of the establishment.\\n\\nAs machines became more powerful, production threatened the future of all life on earth. The producers became extremely polluting, exceeded the nature’s capacities of renewal and destroyed a large part of the common heritage of humanity. Until recently, no serious measures were taken to stop the destruction because of dominant industrial interests.\\n\\nBut the times are changing. Following the expansion of the digital world, the power of industry has reduced considerably. All the labor work which presents a repetitive character is progressively transferred to robots handled by software.\\n\\nThe importance of intellectual power is taking precedence over industrial power. We have entered the Creational Era. Creation factor has become the driving force of the economy.\\n\\nEach human being is creative. To meet the urgent world challenges, we need the creative ideas of everyone. A new production model that pushes the new trend must be implemented. The free intellectual property system will:• Enlarge private initiative to all creators• Promote a long-term sustainable framework for R&D• Exploit fully the creators’ responsibility.\\n\\nThis White Book shows how the Creafree Standard implements this new system.\\n\\n## I. Why is Creafree important?\\n\\nSince Kyoto (1997), humanity is aware of the massive destruction which is now taking place. The governments did not manage to reverse the process that threatens life on earth. \\\\*\\\\*Destruction of the environment continued at an accelerated pace\\\\*\\\\*. In 2018, on August the 1st, humanity consumed more than it produced renewable resource. Living species are disappearing, catastrophes are each year more numerous, level of seas is raising, desertification extends, migrations grow irresistibly, nationalist egoism gains support, the world system is collapsing.\\n\\n## A. The need for creations\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/602/1\\\\*F0UalrjQy0LDkecMfDd6zQ.png)\\n\\n[A study](https://www.fastcompany.com/1648943/most-important-leadership-quality-ceos-creativity) made amongst top managers shows that **creativity is the strongest asset for positive change**. The meaning of the word “Creator” has shifted over time. In the past it concerned a painter, a writer, or a musician and maybe a designer. Increasingly more people are proud to claim this quality in their work and put forward their creativity in their resume.**Every human is a creator**, that is to say a being that has potential ideas to solve problems, bring innovation and contribute to the improvement of life. To introduce a new development model, we need to intensify and disseminate Research & Development (R&D).\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/428/1\\\\*SEt_tApc4F7f_UbVptgyLA.png)\\n\\nThere are 7 billion people able to propose improvements. They all have a direct or indirect access to the internet. [Most people cannot today implement their creative potential](https://adage.com/article/news/study-75-living-creative-potential/234302/). This [under-exploitation](https://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pdfs/Adobe_State_of_Create_Global_Benchmark_Study.pdf) considerably slows down the meeting of the world green challenge. Low R&D rate in third world countries tremendously increases the migratory pressure.\\n\\n## B. The lock of the old venality system\\n\\nThe intellectual property regime is made of old national laws and institutions which deliberately ignore who the real creator is. **Any productive idea that is not patented is abandoned either to death or to free looting.**\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/550/1\\\\*Y0bmQSFGQhdxqA6cyyzqDQ.png)\\n\\nThe dominant intellectual property discourages small companies and creative citizens because progress challenges existing technologies. Only big companies and rich countries can offer **the enormous patent and trademark costs** and face the heavy administrative burdens of the system which protects innovative investments.\\n\\nThe locks of the old system limit human creativity, diminish the attractivity of disruptive innovations and **hinder the renewal of the production model.**\\n\\n## **C. The new trends of the digital era**\\n\\nHumanity is entering a new world where robots and emerging technologies replaces most repetitive labor. [Software and internet that escape of the old property system are now everywhere](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52016PC0593).In the digital era, **creative work has become the central factor for growth**, [employment and competition between nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_economics). Fair intellectual property practice depends on a good implementation of the fundamental principles of human rights.According to \\\\[international treaties [Article 27 (2)](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html) , **author right is the keystone ruling world intellectual property:** “Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author” .\\\\*\\\\*A standard is needed to implement this universal keystone \\\\*\\\\*within a sustainable development framework.\\n\\n## II. How will Creafree will function?\\n\\n**Creators design the future of our planet**.It is our urgent responsibility to support their action with a:• Free access to register their rights.• High Cost Efficiency• Sustainable Ecosystem\\n\\n**A. Free Access for Everyone**\\n\\nCreafree proposes a **Platform accessible to any world creator** who wishes to describe and claim her/his creation. Connected via a smartphone or an ordinary computer, the creator can fill and register the universal Creabook template for less than €50.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/658/1\\\\*w9_ZgbX29FpVGDUy4v9d7g.png)\\n\\nThe **Creabook gives the means to prove how and when the creator had the creative idea** and to provide all necessary documentary evidence (co-authors, author mark, design, software, recording, standard, know-how…). The Platform provides all facilities so that the creator may obtain the support of any competent adviser and coordinate with other creators.\\n\\n## B. High Cost Efficiency\\n\\nHer/his book benefits of the long-term worldwide protection attached to author’s right. The Creafree registration provides the property presumption attached to the [one-star Cf\\\\* label](https://www.amazon.com/How-Establish-Your-Intellectual-Property/dp/1980232024).Additional services of the Société mondiale des Créateurs (SmC) include third party expert label such as:\\n\\n1\\\\. Cf\\\\*\\\\* Creabook conformity to the Creafree Standard2. Cf\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* Economic evaluation of the creation3. Cf\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* **Originality labelled by top world jury experts**4. Cf\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* Certification of the authenticity of each product/service\\n\\n## C. Sustainable Ecosystem\\n\\nCreafree is a project started by creators with the aim of protecting and promoting their intellectual property. \\\\*\\\\*Using Blockchain technology, it assures full security and total traceability \\\\*\\\\*of all operations and provides opportunities to implement smart contracts, including a credit system which finance R&D creation markets.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/426/1\\\\*A7rAOaWcnBv5urUC0Hlehg.png)\\n\\nCrea is a token dedicated to paying Creafree services and launching new creations. It is guaranteed by a pledge on the creation’s intellectual property. Crea is also a special kind of digital asset. It shares the characteristics of a [stable coin token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin) through an indexation with [IMF drawing rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_drawing_rights).Participants to the Creafree ecosystem are required to fully identify themselves under the know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) procedures, **in line with** [the World Bank’s strategy to develop creative activities](http://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/calling-all-innovators-help-achieve-good-id-world-invisible-billion).\\n\\n## III. What will Creafree offer?\\n\\nThe concept of Creafree ecosystem covers the world market and provides:• Superior Property Title for Creators• Long Term Guarantee for Investors• Sustainable Revenue for Contributors• Authentic and Ethical Products for Consumers\\n\\n## A. Superior Property Title for Creators\\n\\nThe creator may request the originality of the Creabook to be assessed and labelled by a jury composed of at least three top world experts in the sector(s) concerned. Such jury may also be requested by the arbitrators who have been nominated to solve a conflict opposing the creator to one or several participants to the ecosystem. **Because of this high examination, Creabook acquires a value superior to any existing intellectual property title**.\\n\\n## B. Long Term Guarantee for Investors\\n\\nMost economists consider that **present World Research & Development (R&D) is insufficient to meet the world challenges** (climate change, sustainable development and employment in particular). [In 2014, it represented 2,2% of the world GDP](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS), that is to say about 2 trillion euros. Underdeveloped countries generally have a rate of R&D below 1%. According to expert estimation, the average world rate should be much above 2,5% (200 billion euros more investments needed each year).\\n\\nHalf of R&D is financed by public budget.R&D investment needs to become more attractive for private investors through **more choices and more return on investments**. Creafree provides **a new momentum** through:• ending the looting of creations and motivating all citizens to become creators;• publishing wide R&D choices, developing cooperation and organizing the creation market;• providing strong guarantees and long-term return on investment.\\n\\n## C. Sustainable Revenue for Contributors\\n\\nThe quality and development of creation depends on the cooperation of numerous and qualified actors in the several hundred sectors concerned. In each sector, special counselors must be trained to advise creators on legal, technical, marketing and finance matters.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/546/1\\\\*4PDxGD9xuyiu-WkMH8gY2g.png)\\n\\nCapitals of creation must be founded to administrate the world institutions in each sector; such as: **training and research center, mortgage conservatory, mediation, arbitration, annual exposition & awards, creation markets…**Brokers will assist the various creators and facilitate the cooperation.\\n\\n## D. Authentic and Ethical Products for Consumers\\n\\n60% of the products that will be sold in 2030 do not yet exist today. **Most of these new products that represent more than 48 trillion euros will be protected by author’s right.** For these newly created products and services, Creafree Standard offers a process directly connected to the Single Creations’ Register. This process certifies the authenticity of each product and services distributed to the consumer.The Creafree Platform does not control a priori the content of any registered creation. But the support of SmC labels will not be provided to creation that do not meet the Creafree Ethical Charter. These restrictions will particularly concern violence, pollution and more generally products and [services that contradict human rights ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26000). **Ethical and sustainable development will be ensured by the responsibility of the creators** for all the products and services they produce, distribute or license.\\n\\n**Facing the risk of collapse, Creafree opens an alternative based on:**\\n\\n**• Freedom,**\\n\\n**• Creation,**\\n\\n**• Ownership,**\\n\\n**• and Responsibility**\",\"timestamp\":1637791175,\"title\":\"Creafree, The Alternative  \"},\"digest\":\"95Mc814S2KvKy1YeTQD9CZcOuVd5XrPltd0eSN-nJ2A\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD586FBe47C3E326AE584ef6D342d8E9Ff1b1899D\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"h5gaFhS2ifE_IznefGVJaxbDNNYoBM4_Z1rZEfOv0y0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"L9PsFWR2lHIo1HC-7hwY3EuJPOunv0MwK9_f-NwYOHs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"oPv2SHohBhI4aFOcjkS5Jc6OArXGW7Ktk095mTyyGhxWMSyfG7xcmmykAsx4Ob7I66ze4Jncw0oSz9KWAeS48Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x48a388aeee412c31d3d4a9b06255a1cd4251ce36486e87d4fbea8c0e2abdae1f4e50ae26d17c7b0bdf95b4beaf1151ce175ea6a88cb4b721d0db7f4a90be0f941b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"h5gaFhS2ifE_IznefGVJaxbDNNYoBM4_Z1rZEfOv0y0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"L9PsFWR2lHIo1HC-7hwY3EuJPOunv0MwK9_f-NwYOHs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"95Mc814S2KvKy1YeTQD9CZcOuVd5XrPltd0eSN-nJ2A\"}"
