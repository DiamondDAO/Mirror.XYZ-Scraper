"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Recently, the whole world seems to be talking about \\\"meta universe\\\", and technology giants and investors are rushing to it from home to abroad. Just earlier this month, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has renamed \\\"Facebook\\\" to \\\"Meta\\\". Zuckerberg said that from now on, the company's business will give priority to the business of Metaverse, and many investors have also invested in industries and concept stocks related to Metaverse.\\n\\nAs of now, **we don't know in what way the metaverse will eventually appear in front of us.** The important thing is that one day Metaverse will serve as a new and profoundly transformative medium, and a global network of 3D content organized by space will be available to everyone without restrictions.\\n\\nAt the same time, it seems that some clarification and guidance are needed to construct a meta-universe that aims to bring the greatest benefit to all. The following are the seven laws that make up the meta-universe, which can guide our ongoing work according to these rules and evaluate progress according to these rules.\\n\\n**Only one meta universe**\\n\\nThe meta universe is the sum of all publicly accessible virtual worlds, real-time 3D content and related media. They are connected on an open global network and are not controlled by anyone and can be accessed by everyone.\\n\\nWhen referring to a certain place in the meta-universe, the correct expression term should be \\\"world\\\", \\\"virtual world\\\", \\\"space\\\", \\\"environment\\\", \\\"node\\\", \\\"region\\\" and other widely accepted similar names.\\n\\nIf someone calls such a place \\\"meta universe\\\", then they are not describing the meta universe. They describe places, people, or 3D spaces that share many characteristics with the meta universe. But these are not \\\"meta universes\\\", because there is only one meta universe.\\n\\n**Meta universe is for everyone**\\n\\nSystems in the meta-universe must adapt to a wide range of imaginable use cases and the user roles that design them. Generally, this means any 2D or 3D experience provided through Metaverse's network infrastructure. Although virtual environment is the main type of experience in the meta-universe, it is not a prerequisite or defining characteristic.\\n\\nMost of the production value and interaction mechanism in the meta-universe will be \\\"game-like\\\" or be perceived through 3D experience. But most of the experiences in the meta universe will not be games, nor will they be \\\"game players\\\" in the popular sense. There will be games in the meta-universe, but there will also be many other types of experiences.\\n\\nSince Metaverse supports the widest audience, it must adapt to the creators and consumers of business, society, and academia. This has inherent economic significance in that for many purposes, the cost of creating and distributing content cannot be too high, and it must provide easy, unrestricted access to all visitors.\\n\\n**No one can control the meta universe**\\n\\nMetaverse is the universal commonality of digital communications and commerce. It is adjusted according to needs, governed according to the needs of common interests, and strives for the greatest benefit for the greatest number of people.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jMMtpRJVz1_TBBkk5bob6.png?height=299&width=600)\\n\\nCapital will undoubtedly promote many innovations and enterprises in the meta universe. It greedily creates unfair advantages and seeks to maximize returns. Although these forces have brought unimaginable value in the digital age, they have always maintained a tense relationship with the needs of creators and consumers, and this tension will become more obvious in the meta-universe.\\n\\nEnterprise entities’ attempts to control the meta-universe are doomed to fail. Due to free market competition, any meta-universe controlled by a single entity will be inherently limited in scale, because they cannot provide a complete solution to solve every stakeholder’s problem. All needs. A company may be able to provide some commonly used functions, such as search or access. Over time, these functions may expand to a monopoly position, but these companies actually control only the vertical part.\\n\\nAny meta-universe that claims to be controlled by a single entity will be rejected by a growing class of creators and consumers. They have already experienced the monopolistic influence of the Internet. The Internet was originally prepared for everyone, but it was eventually rejected by several companies. Controlled by large technology companies. This large-scale rejection has already begun, as evidenced by the creator economic community and the NFT market.\\n\\nThe power of decentralization is working and growing. Decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other blockchain-based infrastructure have entered the early deployment phase from the experimental stage. Web3 technology has become the early foundation of the meta universe and will play a key role in the future. In particular, the identity, privacy, payment, and economy in Metaverse will be affected by these measures.\\n\\nSome industry participants may use economies of scale to establish early advantages, but any advantage will be temporary. The control of specific areas in the meta-universe depends entirely on their stakeholders. Companies can control their own areas in the meta-universe and should freely create private or restricted access spaces under their own control. Experiences created for private use should be provided with appropriate protection measures, just like private spaces in the real world.\\n\\nNevertheless, Metaverse will need intermediary technology service providers related to regulators, similar to domain name services and ICANN. In addition, the Web 2 era has confirmed the danger of leaving a vacuum in governance, and one might expect the creators of the metaverse to consider appropriate protective measures now. Look at how important a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) plays in this new phase of the information age, and how traditional government and regulatory entities adapt to this rapidly changing order.\\n\\nThe meta universe is open\\n\\nFrom telephone, radio, television to the Internet, any important communication medium must be based on standards. You can read this article now because you have a computer or mobile device that is connected to the Internet and is running Internet language software. Without multiple standards that define media formats, wire protocols for transmission, and agreed presentation and interaction rules, all of this will be impossible.\\n\\nOpen and interoperable technologies provide the most reliable way to expand with the universe. Although closed systems and proprietary technologies have short-term advantages, there are inherent limitations in scale. No single product or product suite can solve all problems, and interoperable products allow more flexible combinations to meet more needs.\\n\\nAn open software and hardware ecosystem provides more choices for creators and consumers. More choices means more content, more tools and opportunities for platform vendors, which is a virtuous circle.\\n\\nIronically, any significant case of monopoly in the Internet world today is based on open standards. The largest social networks, search engines, and consumer hardware companies use the advantages of the Internet to provide added value at the cost of some form of lock-in, such as brand monopolies, closed ecosystems, or network effects.\\n\\nIn the short term, proprietary products and solutions will always develop faster and compete more effectively than standards-based products and solutions. Companies can quickly meet market needs based on their own capabilities, while open solutions require time to reach consensus and deploy on a large scale. This is a natural by-product of the standardization process, but it often leads to the notion that standards-based solutions are inferior. Although this is sometimes true, in the long run, this is largely not the case, as the standard will eventually achieve functional equivalence.\\n\\nThe path of a few people dominating the market is not always out of malice. Sometimes, only large platforms can provide convenience and value. We are at the forefront of the Web2.0 mobile computing era, and we must constantly choose between convenience and autonomy. However, in the emerging meta-universe, this approach has met with strong opposition.\\n\\nDespite the obvious advantages of open systems, today's standards may not be sufficient to support the infrastructure of Metaverse. The current format and protocol provide a good starting point, but further development is needed. In addition, in terms of compatibility and architecture, older versions of software (such as web browsers) may reach a breakpoint because they are always designed for the two-dimensional first information world.\\n\\nMeta universe is independent of hardware\\n\\nA defining feature of the meta-universe is spatial organization, mainly real-time 3D content. In order for everyone to access this content, it must be able to be presented on the widest range of hardware, including devices that the user already owns within a reasonable range.\\n\\nAlthough the content of the meta universe may be three-dimensional, the display technology may not necessarily be. Multiplayer gaming experiences such as realistic 3D \\\"virtual products\\\" and cartoon rendering can be presented at real-time frame rates on the 2D displays of modern computers or mobile devices. This is the reality of today’s computing world. From mobile phones in our pockets, to the latest full-power personal computers, to room-sized display walls and projections, every configuration can present the work to consumers without the need for one. A new type of display device.\\n\\nAlthough virtual reality and augmented reality are attractive enough to the general public, immersion is not a prerequisite for the success of Metaverse. For some applications, immersive hardware devices will undoubtedly enhance the user experience of Metaverse, but these are by no means indispensable for its large-scale deployment.\\n\\nCreated for a specific form factor, essentially limiting the scale. If the intent of the content is to experience it as widely as possible, then it should be designed and implemented to run on any device. The responsive design technology pioneered for the Web and mobile Web will appear analogous in the meta universe, with content that can be run on tablet mobile devices, such as tablet computer monitors, display walls, immersive virtual reality headsets, mobile augmented reality, Head-mounted augmented reality, holographic display, etc. Obviously, these experiences are not the same in different device types, but are gradually enhanced to optimize the experience of the device. Some experiences will be designed to be XR first, with simple 2D backups.\\n\\nAccessibility is crucial. When designing content, accessibility should be considered. In addition to not relying on specific device types and user interface technologies, the experience should also be flexibly designed to accommodate the disabled or impaired individuals.\\n\\nMeta universe is a network\\n\\nMetaverse connects all accessible virtual experiences, real-time 3D content and related media in the world. From a technical point of view, Metaverse is a computer network that transmits and presents digital information. It is unique in that it can present information to users in the form of 3D spaces, locations, objects, and characters to promote communication for a wide range of purposes.\\n\\nMeta universe is not a computer program, but multiple computer programs and processes exchange information through network protocols. Metaverse is not a browser or other application or executable file. Instead, an application acts as a user agent to provide access to the experience in Metaverse.\\n\\nThe meta universe is not a specific entrance or access point. It will have portals, search engines, directories and other similar services to help users locate and navigate, but these are only maps of the meta universe, not the meta universe itself.\\n\\nAll of the above content is implemented in a generally accepted way to support Metaverse software systems, that is, it does not depend on specific products or implementations, complies with media formats and communication protocols established through open processes, and presents them in a consistent manner.\\n\\nFrom a functional point of view, Metaverse is a network that connects everyone and provides them with the following functions:\\n\\n1. Visit, read or experience content;\\n2. Establish one or more identities that represent yourself;\\n3. Asynchronous or real-time communication in a variety of ways, including text, voice and gestures;\\n4. Use various digital media types to create and publish 3D, space and related content and experiences in various forms;\\n5. Appropriately change the virtual environment around us and give sufficient permission;\\n6. Engage in business and commercial activities, and have the widest possible choice in terms of access, personal identity, social connections, data storage, content creation, content distribution, and payment.\\n\\nIn addition to the above-mentioned general functions, the meta-universe does not require any functional description. Only the future will tell us what are the mainstream patterns and compelling use cases for creative expression in the meta-universe.\\n\\nThe meta universe is the Internet\\n\\nThe Internet is the global communication infrastructure that connects all of us. It is the foundation of our daily life, including social interaction, work, entertainment, learning and business. This will not change with the arrival of the meta-universe. The Internet will only adapt, expand and provide new information services as usual to cover the meta-universe we envision.\\n\\nOn the contrary, the Internet is not a meta-universe, at least not yet. Today's Internet is moving towards more powerful capabilities and will form the basis of the future meta-universe. In some respects, it is already a typical form of meta-universe, carrying years of continuous innovation and experimentation in providing real-time 3D content and virtual worlds.\\n\\nIn addition to the definition of technology, the Internet also embodies a method: an open, collaborative, and consensus-driven way of developing technologies and tools. Protocols, file formats, and creation software have developed together over the past few decades, expanding to include the World Wide Web and various other services. The governing body defines strict standards, but much of the work is also carried out through example realization, intellectual property contributions and collaborative open source projects, all of which are carried out in the interaction of constantly upgrading our communication infrastructure structure.\\n\\nSome people believe that because the needs of networked, real-time 3D virtual worlds are so unique and dense, a new kind of network must be designed for the meta-universe. This is not only largely unrealistic, but also unworkable.\\n\\nIn terms of feasibility, we have commercial 3D games based on Internet protocols, which are the most performance- and resource-intensive applications. We also have Internet media types that support the dynamic delivery of 3D content. Recently developed formats (such as glTF and USDZ) are now serving hundreds of millions of Internet users. WebGL and WebXR APIs for browsers have also proven that user agents can support feature-rich 3D rendering and high-performance immersive experiences.\\n\\nOn the road to the meta-universe, it is feasible to re-examine some designs of the Internet, but the idea of ​​large-scale redesign is unrealistic. The current infrastructure investment is too much, and the inherent conversion cost of this change is too high, so it will not happen at all. Where possible, the traditional Internet will be incorporated into a new paradigm, and new user access, content distribution, visual presentation, real-time communication and interaction methods will be developed as needed.\\n\\nFortunately, the adaptability of the Internet is unparalleled. Flexibility is still its inherent cornerstone. A more effective method than redesign is to carry out a series of optimizations, and a revolutionary leap occurs by introducing some brand-new functions. In the process, although not all traditional Internet content will be retained, it may be presented in different forms.\\n\\nThere are some things that can be upgraded to carry out new work. The document object model and cascading style sheet are designed for the 2D information world. 3D is limited to a rectangle in the page layout, with additional support for full-screen rendering and stereo vision. However, the organization principle of the meta-universe will be a scene, environment or some such 3D structure. After all, Metaverse has nothing to do with documents but with shared 3D space and content and real-time communication. By transplanting the design to the traditional 2D model, immersive interactions such as head tracking, tactile input and real environment perception can be realized, but the effect is not particularly satisfactory so far.\\n\\nShared and persistent object state is another area that needs research. The multiplayer world has solved this problem long ago, albeit in a customized way. In the past, interoperable solutions were rare. However, so far, there may be enough overlap between design patterns and practical knowledge and a collective willingness to continue trying.\\n\\nThe needs of stakeholders will promote the development of innovation. For example, the current Web3 decentralization movement is an important step in returning power to consumers and producers for distribution, payment, and identity verification. This will have an important impact on how certain information is maintained in the meta-universe. On the other hand, this does not mean that we should support the decentralization of all layers. The method should be judged based on its characteristics, performance, privacy, and security advantages.\\n\\nInterstellar observation\\n\\nAlthough Metaverse seems to be a very vague concept, in fact, with the development of technology and the entry of more and more companies and capital, the term Metaverse is no longer confined to the imagination in the book. VR headsets allow people to be on the scene. The virtual world can be made out of the real, the reality and the virtual are intertwined with each other, and the meta-universe is getting closer and closer to us.\\n\\nAlthough the meta-universe is not yet mature and requires advanced blockchain technology to cooperate and support each other, we can completely believe that the formation of the meta-universe will be a complete Internet revolution.\",\"timestamp\":1639712096,\"title\":\"The Seven Laws of Constructing the Metaverse\"},\"digest\":\"4Xykb410z-8t-E20GuZWw3MWUvYO1-2oRiHrcmuR3Ek\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa5eE12532625600cf3B01b493e361571d3e3d337\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hGSUCu_DGiD9BbtuarOzxGFNhGYyQKJzwaGfblZ5ASc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"sm8_lXJZG6yXUtlb4a3nEydk-Cak0yeybJrN4_4_UNQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"9WCT7QfhM9ha_Xq7sRB4LQYRry498-5TCXd8vZ2lpE6HSeSVVYMjkgiDup9MHR1uJcYVdRhrCOAslACBiIcstQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa141de5544317bd98572cca546ea3914ea1d9561878ee8d614830d093f1f6d030293ea2aaf5c449fe890b5b58cbfeeefcacb599233e7a204ab7f3d2423a05aae1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hGSUCu_DGiD9BbtuarOzxGFNhGYyQKJzwaGfblZ5ASc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"sm8_lXJZG6yXUtlb4a3nEydk-Cak0yeybJrN4_4_UNQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"4Xykb410z-8t-E20GuZWw3MWUvYO1-2oRiHrcmuR3Ek\"}"
