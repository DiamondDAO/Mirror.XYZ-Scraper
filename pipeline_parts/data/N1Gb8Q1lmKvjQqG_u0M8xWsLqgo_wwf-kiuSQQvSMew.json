"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I am often very afraid to cross large wide streets. I always go to the traffic light and use the crosswalk, but many times I have been frightened. When the light changes to green, I still need to look both directions to check the traffic On many occasions a speeding motorcycle or bicycle or once a truck drove past the red light and across the pedestrian's When I have my bicycle, I get off and walk across the street, but always someone crosses the red light. Once at the intersection near National Taiwan University I saw an accident: a taxi had stopped for the light, and another truck came from behind and did not stop. For safety, it is very important for everyone to obey the traffic laws.\",\"timestamp\":1639140132,\"title\":\"Obeying the Traffic Laws\"},\"digest\":\"OBVwUASUDs-3fb60tZVFZVIuAxpiL0nB0pRuOYB1o8c\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x86BA0338Ed90941406b81CdA7111c3b115c8045a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"5AQnuLJ-4bVSpvYOjxKv-sBf61VUrCx6DFwWjh_7dkU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FrExmArJ712OkmSLoW1G7k51JPQM0IDK9cHBnSSRz_A\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"BBQ62xGKw9-pG4LsbSS_prmWkPW8icusGGOa-SluKh5BhWzFgn_nfF4WKKC1XlWeIJsQ6sxKzlwikI-teQ2tSQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xcc2632d8bcc07cf307e5df108b9bf9a6c3a57e2d006558a4e75c7d0d52642c512bc5f842883b4350ddb49ed8413eb993a670156bccc7a4682ecef96f863975ab1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"5AQnuLJ-4bVSpvYOjxKv-sBf61VUrCx6DFwWjh_7dkU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FrExmArJ712OkmSLoW1G7k51JPQM0IDK9cHBnSSRz_A\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"OBVwUASUDs-3fb60tZVFZVIuAxpiL0nB0pRuOYB1o8c\"}"
