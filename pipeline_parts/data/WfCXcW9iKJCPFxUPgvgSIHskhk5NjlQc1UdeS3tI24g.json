"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"As a popular sport all over the world, football is loved by men, women and children. Since joining [@football.xyz](https://twitter.com/footballdotxyz), I have been learning to search for related concepts related to webs, searched for some information about the intersection of web3 and football, and some of my own thoughts.\\n\\nWhat do we often say is web3? \\n Web3 can be said to be an iterative and upgraded version of web2. It has made great progress in both dimensions and breadth. The concept of Web3.0 is relatively decentralized, with users’ personal digital identities, digital assets, and data completely decentralized.\\n\\nAn automated and intelligent new Internet world based on the premise of returning to the individual. The trend we are about to witness is that the Internet will evolve with the needs and use of users, and ultimately belong to users. \\n It has the following two key characteristics:\\n\\n> *• Openness and decentralization: The open protocol is the most suitable soil for the growth of the web3 platform and does not require the endorsement of a third-party platform.*\\n>\\n> *• Ownership: Participants own their data and content, and even obtain ownership of the platform.*\\n\\nFootball is the biggest piece of the sports industry, with an annual output value of more than 500 billion US dollars, accounting for more than 40% of the entire sports field. It is foreseeable that the market size of the encrypted sports industry will also be considerable.\\n\\nThese features of Web3 fit well with the passion, freedom, struggle, and competition represented by football. It is believed that the integration with web3, which itself is decentralized and open, will produce a wonderful chemical reaction.\\n\\nI think the acquisition of [football.xyz](https://twitter.com/footballdotxyz) and the football team is not a one-time cash. Acquisition, but a collection of building a digital world, real communities and sustainable business.\\n\\nDeeply believe that cryptocurrency and NFT can change the current pattern of football.\\n\\n# Encrypted chain transactions and wallets\\n\\nWallets and exchanges are the core of the development of web3. One of the criteria to measure the degree of user interest in web3 is to check the frequency and number of encrypted transactions.\\n\\nUser data highlights that people's interest in 3.0 is increasing rapidly. This will become an incremental source of web3 channels in the future, so it is a good indicator for exploring user interests and activities in the web3 era. \\n Network data display:\\n\\n> *•Coinbase has more than 68 million real users on its platform. \\n •According to the transaction volume, the transaction volume of Binance, Coinbase and FTX has doubled compared with the previous year \\n •Robinhood has become the easiest way for many people to buy cryptocurrency today. In addition, Robinhood wallet will be launched soon, and more than 1 million users have made appointments. \\n •Metamask is currently one of the most popular wallets, and the number of Coinbase and phantom wallet users has skyrocketed.*\\n\\nWhat impressed me was that Cristiano Ronaldo, the winner of the 2020 European Cup Golden Boot Award, ranked first in the European Cup's best scorer with 5 goals and 1 assist, and won the first blockchain scoring gold cup in the history of the European Cup -\\\"Alipay Trophy\\\", not only that, the results and honors will be permanently recorded in the blockchain system irrevocably, web3 and football honors are becoming more and more inseparable.\\n\\nFootball’s firework\\n\\nIn recent years, more and more mainstream football clubs have continued to launch their own digital currency/fan Token. Although the general public is still divided on the actual utility of these products, the fact remains that the football community is quite clearly aware of the technical and monetary claims proposed by cryptocurrencies are very keen.\\n\\nIt’s no secret that players in the past and present quickly accepted cryptocurrency, and athletes in all sports industries continue to rapidly adopt encryption technology. It’s no secret that the football industry in particular is a big hit.\\n\\n# The NFTs\\n\\nWhen it comes to \\\"ownership\\\" in web3, as its name implies, non-fungible tokens are unique on the chain. NFT is a unique digital asset that relies on some common areas. Blockchain technology and cryptocurrency principles of artworks, music, and videos are even an act of imitating delivery.\\n\\nNft has a wide range of use cases, including collectibles, digital assets in games, digital art, reputation systems, etc. This is an area that has truly succeeded, highlighting the power that web3 can bring. We can see that in addition to financial activities, nft is also becoming a key part of people's identification and a new way of building communities:\\n\\n> *• The **OpenSea** platform has increased by more than 500 times over the same period last year. NFT wave sweeps the world in 2021 \\n • At the same time, **Coinbase** announced the launch of the NFT market this year. There are already 3.8 million users on the appointment list. \\n • The daily transaction volume of **SolanaArt** is approximately 3 million. FTX has also recently launched a Solana-based NFT market.*\\n\\nWhat I want to point out is that NFT is the cornerstone of the club’s development blueprint, and the digital community built on this basis will be a perfect opportunity for energetic and capital investment.\\n\\nSome football and nft or even game combination projects are worth learning:\\n\\n> *• Next-generation product: **Sorare**, a digital football NFT collection platform. Sorare is a blockchain game based on Ethereum that uses football player cards as NFT collections. Every digital star card is registered as the Ethereum blockchain. Players can buy and sell these star cards from other players, and all transactions are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, providing football clubs, players and their fans with a deeper connection to each other Way.*\\n>\\n> *Sorare combines real football matches and blockchain NFT to make a rare NFT card similar to NBA topshot, and absorbs the gameplay of virtual games. Players can trade and collect corresponding athletes’ NFT cards according to their own hobbies to form a virtual team. Through the performance of real players on and off the chain, the rewards are finally distributed according to the virtual team’s ranking, thereby realizing closed-loop applications. In this way, NFT can be empowered and the players' needs can be stimulated. At the same time, NFT can also be transferred, traded, etc., so that players can obtain corresponding benefits.*\\n\\n> *• **Cryptofifa** is an encrypted star card Gamefi platform based on NFT. It introduces classic gameplay in traditional football games into the encrypted world, and integrates NFT and Defi elements to develop a more fair, friendly and sustainable game mechanism. Including blind box draw, event mining, lineup challenge, etc. Users can permanently collect their favorite encrypted star cards, and get corresponding mining rewards based on the performance of the player or the team in the real game. \\n Cryptofifa has designed a sophisticated economic model to ensure the operation of the entire game ecosystem, and to protect the interests of users to the greatest extent. The earlier users who participate in the game and the longer they participate in the game, the greater the rewards they can get, so that the game can continue. Go on. \\n This economic model is implemented around event mining: Cryptofifa has set up a bonus pool for event mining, and the funds in the bonus pool come from the initial issuance and distribution of FFA tokens and the circulating injection of FFA tokens consumed by users drawing cards.*\\n\\n> *• **Messi’s four-piece NFT** set will also go on sale in August this year. As a winner of six golden balls, Messi's NFT is also extremely luxurious. He cooperated with the new NFT Ethernity chain, and was personally operated by the digital design master Bosluoqi who has worked with Marvel and Disney, and even the name of the NFT is full of domineering-\\\"Messiverse, Messi personally titled his NFT: \\\"Art is like football-it is eternal. \\\"Inspired by Messi, the single price of his NFT exceeded $1.25 million. \\n NFT is becoming more and more \\\"organized and standardized.\\\" It is said that in Messi’s signing of the Grand Paris contract, the bonus part also includes the club’s fans’ encrypted tokens. In the future, on the basis of head traffic driving, good operations, and elimination of vicious hype, no one can say whether NFT is a new answer for the future sports industry.*\\n\\nFrom the current art collectibles market that frequently speaks in the billions, there is still huge room for growth in the NFT of the football circle. Especially for the trendy people in the European and American football circles who are good at playing tricks and mastering traffic passwords, NFT is still an undeveloped \\\"virgin land\\\".\\n\\n# The DAOs\\n\\nDAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization and is a way for people to collaborate around a common mission or vision. DAO allows on-chain governance, decentralized decision-making and ownership.\\n\\nIn the web3 world, if people do not use mutual cooperation as the main way to achieve their goals, DAO may be meaningful, especially the acquisition and management of football clubs, which embodies dao management.\\n\\n> *So what is the role of DAO? \\n • **Assets under management**: The total assets managed by DAO are as high as 14 billion, which has almost doubled in just one month. Millions of members poured into the universe of DAO \\n • **Use cases**: DAOs appear in countless cases, such as agreements and investments. Or it might include social networking, charity, service, and so on. \\n • **Infrastructure**: The related Dao infrastructure is also constantly improving. More and more things are appearing to make processing organization (DAOHaus), management (snapshot), fund management (Parcel) and communication (Discourse, Discord) and cooperation (Coordinape) these Make dao easier to understand and visualize.*\\n\\nThe latest and most vigorous development is this kind of community DAO. Generally speaking, it is characterized by decentralized startup. Although there may be one or several initiators who think of this thing as an idea, but he almost all of the entire community Decision-making and the direction of the community are all generated by everyone's discussion, so it is almost completely community-driven such an organization, its degree of collaboration is very high, and its business scope is relatively wide.\\n\\nThen the topic is the production center VS governance center. \\n Because the DAO that we were familiar with in the past was the governance center, everyone just used it as a general meeting of shareholders. For a project, you often don’t have to do the work to join members. We have a team, but you can vote when making decisions, but I can’t ask you every day for major decisions, so it’s more of a governance center, and This governance is not a complete community governance either.\\n\\nI am not saying that this is a problem, because it is unrealistic to pursue complete decentralization at the initial stage. It is likely to cause some advancement in your product development to stagnate. But a DAO in this state is really not my ideal DAO, because it is top-down. The product comes first, and the DAO is built last. A small number of communities have been handed over to DAOs slowly and more and more, and finally a complete decentralization may be achieved.\\n\\nAnother big category of DAO actually puts production and governance in the same place. This is not just a production center. It almost uses the power of the community to do everything from the goal strategy of the entire organization, to the introduction and matching of talents, to some of your basic back-office, front-end operations, R&D and production, including the BD market. Everything is promoted by community members to collaborate. Such a DAO is not mainstream now, but it has a tendency to explode, and he has also begun to slowly expand from a small circle of encryption to the entire industry.\\n\\nOf course, such a DAO also has its problems, such as efficiency, incentives, and so on. But at least in my opinion, this type of DAO has greater charm and more openness, and can better accept these. People who are passionate and interested in DAO come and participate.\\n\\n# Incentive model\\n\\nIt may be a little confusing to summarize here, because there are no mature cases to follow and dao is evolving in new forms every day. Next, I want to combine the website and the **Bankless DAO** case to share my views.\\n\\nPeople say that in addition to love, that is to make money. This is related to this funding, because you say that it is not realistic to let everyone do the work and contribute in vain. So most DAOs actually have a variety of incentives or funding methods to support their members to do something.\\n\\n**Bankless DAO** roughly divides this funding into four types:\\n\\n> *• Seasonal project \\n The project dao itself will report the budget before the start of a quarter, explaining what the project commits are. Everyone has to go through a community discussion and vote, and agree that this project is reliable and worthwhile. The individual budgets for these items will be directly added to the budget plan for the entire quarter. \\n  \\n • Bankless Grants \\n Because a quarter is three months, but the crypto world, including the world of DAO, is developing very fast. It is very likely that you have discovered a particularly reliable thing during these three months and you think you should do it right away. Can’t wait for two months to arrive. Plan to do it in another quarter, so he will leave a certain budget for such urgent projects or unions that everyone agrees to support to support such community behaviors.*\\n>\\n> *• Contributor reward \\n This is a reward he reserved for active contributors in some communities. How to understand active contributors? For example, if you are a very important person in charge of a project, there will be your budget in the project, and you will get some rewards and rewards for your contributions in the project. But there are many people who may have made a lot of suggestions, but they have not specifically participated in the actual operation of a certain guild or some actual research and development work terminals of the project. But I think he is also very important, because he has made great contributions to the activity of the community and the formation of many decisions. So this Contributor reward actually reserves a portion of the budget for active contributors in the community.*\\n>\\n> *• Funding \\n DAO has its own mod, and some of their daily work rewards are to be put into dao's funding. Funding will leave some small funds of your own, and you may have some incentives for active people in the trade union.*\\n\\nRelying on such a cycle, the activity of the entire community is made up. Then, by making contributions, some great projects may be formed, which in turn will generate a positive incentive for DAO, and this will turn it around. This is also a very interesting model, he used someone else's existing incentive system to do this. \\n  \\n In traditional companies, most of the incentives are not so easy to design and may not be reasonable. This is a common problem faced by all organizations, especially in a new world like DAO.\\n\\nIn addition, incentives must also be in line with the economic closed loop. For most DAOs, it is a challenge that must be faced in the future. It is impossible to rely on the enthusiasm of the market to support the price and value of your token. Instead, you must create something that belongs to the DAO. Return, and then the circle can be rounded. Now the development of dao is still in the early stage. Compliance, collaboration, efficiency governance, incentives, and economic closed-loop are at the core of DAO\\n\\nFootball.xyz\\n\\nIt takes more time to give more observations to this industry. Next year is the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The passion, excitement and hype will be displayed to the fullest.
