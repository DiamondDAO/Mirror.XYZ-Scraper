"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"To recap the idea: use this platform to publish unpublishable cartoons as NFTs (No Filter Toons) and start a conversation about comedy and censorship in the age of internet mob rule.\\n\\nAbout me:\\nFor over a decade, I’ve been a staff cartoonist at The New Yorker magazine. Every week, my fellow doodlers and I submit ten cartoons each and occasionally, the New Yorker publishes one. That leaves a lot of funny stuff that no one gets to see.\\n\\nAbout No Filter Toons:\\nMy cartoonist coworker Matt Diffee had the brilliant idea to make a collection of the best of these rejects, called “The Rejection Collection.” It featured New Yorker cartoons that were too dirty, dark, gross, weird, shocking, controversial, offensive, and down right crass for the magazine. AKA, the really super funny ones. It was so successful it even got a second volume.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xKoRxbWVWqEtqb-XCBHSu.PNG?height=640&width=555)\\n\\nBut that was way back in the 2000s when comedians could still make jokes without a twitter mob calling for the end of their career. Diffee has been trying to publish a new third volume of rejected New Yorker cartoons, but in this climate, publishers are so afraid of internet mob retribution that they rejected my rejected cartoons and the rejects of many other talented artists for being too controversial to see the light of day—even in a collection calling them out as too racy.\\n\\nLet’s skirt this censorship by the mob and get these cartoons out there for people to enjoy their dirty, offensive, nasty, definitely-not-politically-correct jokes. We live in an unfair world, so let’s laugh at it.\\n\\nI’m going to distribute these cartoons as a a series of collectible, ownable NFTs. I’ll release one every Toonsday (Tuesday) for a year. They’ll be otherwise unpublishable, so help me subvert the publishing industry which kowtows to the faceless outrage factory that is the internet.\\n\\nI’m kicking off this collection with some of my personal rejects but will soon open it up to  other talented New Yorker cartoonists whose jokes were too spicy for the world.\",\"timestamp\":1635296041,\"title\":\"thanks for the votes to launch this idea!\",\"publication\":\"farleykatz\"},\"digest\":\"St9HKBxJQPwdmdOkpIv18JlVf-0Cp7a81rxl9rKtxJ0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0F3065Ab44D0B2B908c3a16033a974Ba64e6165b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"15jLl7hY5pao9PjLH9ycLPMobmFuAD49GqbNj3w7afI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"UGG-ptrMuS0YLJtkODLS1s_LFCO8WHbf9yuhNWMQD9o\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"EQfZtRtNDnlfBqHY0KaJEABvcAdlmzvl2nKjmhs2PsWbPVWsDFyI4Dsfi2hiIBplC8xQAz5tiF3w9K7F0HenuA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x59c243b0c9ca0a53b7f693709d0c33fbae39ebda782913317c6ae0d2f7336ead24b193e4de3908fa5cf41655125138da4f5e105a2dcac2604f522de5dc9992fa1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"15jLl7hY5pao9PjLH9ycLPMobmFuAD49GqbNj3w7afI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"UGG-ptrMuS0YLJtkODLS1s_LFCO8WHbf9yuhNWMQD9o\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"St9HKBxJQPwdmdOkpIv18JlVf-0Cp7a81rxl9rKtxJ0\"}"
