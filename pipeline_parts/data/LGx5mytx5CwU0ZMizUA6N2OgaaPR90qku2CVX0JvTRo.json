Silver will also be transferred to Spacetime Rips, which, later on, will be withdrawn into points.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_hC0ErAnxrzViXFx12RgF.png?height=319&width=601)\\n\\nBelow shows what a Spacetime Rip looks like - these are used to get points with silver, and also allow users to transfer and withdraw Artifacts.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/szXHDUNxw8LQb4q2O7BCU.png?height=342&width=596)\\n\\nThe following picture shows the Foundry, where players can find Artifacts (every Artifact is a NFT) and has various buffs on the planet.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Uz_HHofuYQor6qE92xDpw.png?height=356&width=573)\\n\\nThe picture below shows Quasars, with the largest energy reserves and silver deposits among all planets of its class.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CrN3mX4-ODT1g_fgHzYAe.png?height=357&width=657)\\n\\n## How to conquer a celestial body?\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fHvIB88E41QmsKdN-vFON.png?height=560&width=865)\\n\\nYou will start with a level 0 home planet, which will help you expand your field.\\n\\nClick on the planet and select the energy you want to send, click on send and it will bring up a solid line to the target planet and send energy to start the conquest.\\n\\nThe picture above shows that sending 50% of my 100-energy planet will knock out 7 energy while the target is only 4 energy, so it will be possible to conquer it in one time.\\n\\n## How to gain points\\n\\n1\\\\.Send silver to a Spacetime Rip, as shown below\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-uLfWmJBnw2crdRDnd0wd.png?height=517&width=712)\\n\\n2\\\\.

In addition, transferring planets from players to the civilizations can only be done one by one due to the underlying mechanism, and bulk transfers can take a long time (10 transfers can take 2-3 minutes), so please use the appropriate strategy accordingly.\\n* If you are not able to succeed through the first and the second button after trying many times, and you cannot transfer the planet back to yourself, please use the third and the fourth button to return the planet from your civilization (rescue mode)\\n\\n### How to add the dark gang plugin?\\n\\nRed civilization and blue civilization should add the plugin for their own civilization.\\n\\n**\\\\[Recommended\\\\] Method 1: Copy the following code and paste it into the plugin window**\\n\\nRed civilization：\\n\\n```\\nGangPluginRed export { default } from \\\"https://guild-w.github.io/dark-gang/GangPluginRed.js\\\"\\n```\\n\\nBlue civilization：\\n\\n```\\nGangPluginBlue export { default } from \\\"https://guild-w.github.io/dark-gang/GangPluginBlue.js\\\"\\n```\\n\\nMethod 2: Copy the file contents directly and paste it into the plugin window (more code may cause a lag, please be patient)：\\n\\nRed team: GangPluginRed <https://guild-w.github.io/dark-gang/GangPluginRed.js>\\n\\nBlue team: GangPluginBlue <https://guild-w.github.io/dark-gang/GangPluginBlue.js>\\n\\nRefer to the picture below for details:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6rQ1ZDf6pzFu6JnljCyG1.png?height=547&width=865)\\n\\n### Find your contribution on the leaderboard\\n\\nClick on the Leaderboard button at the bottom to see an overview of the current contributions.\\n\\nThe ranking of the red civilization's contributions is on the left and the ranking of the blue civilization's contributions is on the right.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hF6X5XJlqapJ12ICI51IV.png?height=478&width=631)\\n\\nIf you have any questions, please jump into the Guild W discord server and find the #English-help channel.\\n\\n[https://discord.gg/rtdjfXtqh6](https://discord.gg/rtdjfXtqh6)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638587083,\"title\":\"Tutorial: How to play the Dark Forest Community Round 1\",\"publication\":\"buidl\"},\"digest\":\"8PDb417a5VYrrCx5QKsKq1F0skc6G3iUw3hKnvGzkuA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x65946FfB5FAbE6d4D02F826699204336b42D436F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cCIrdrMAjg0WRwsOJnrp9ay8b_liRgSg1Yt-wQa9d3Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1leaffDhhVptjjcbykTYhJE9S_P2EqTvoZm3abdgtAI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"BCk-XCsYA4HWZWiXXeoc1dcbu8l3QW5ejxK8o1Ax_tknvdGBJ0RaunDaXJzvA6RJFZUz0NKfuq7vTJwaVuKqyw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc6d7f1cbd3bceba46276b74e25914ba1e5fdb8202260a89033fb7ca67799c18c2c6a6cd26f5162ac46af4b1dd1414991ec4556b96c32bff0c5fd756451748c6f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cCIrdrMAjg0WRwsOJnrp9ay8b_liRgSg1Yt-wQa9d3Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1leaffDhhVptjjcbykTYhJE9S_P2EqTvoZm3abdgtAI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"oS2rIeO5dsGtWNBC7U8Dfv8vyBgQMV18uWwcL4TaA84\"}"
