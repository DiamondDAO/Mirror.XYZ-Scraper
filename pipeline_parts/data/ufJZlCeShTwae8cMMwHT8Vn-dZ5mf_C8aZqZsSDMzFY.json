"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"With cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, and Dogecoin gyrating in value over the past few months, many people are looking at [so-called stablecoins](https://fortune.com/2021/06/24/crypto-stablecoin-us-fed-digital-dollar-circle/) like Terra to invest in because of their more predictable prices.\\n\\nTerraform Labs, which oversees the Terra cryptocurrency project, has benefited from its rising popularity. The company said Friday that investors like Arrington Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Pantera Capital have pledged $150 million to help it incubate various crypto projects that are connected to Terra. \\n   \\n  Terraform Labs and its partners have built apps that operate on the company’s blockchain technology that helps keep a permanent and shared record of the firm’s crypto-related financial transactions.\\n\\nHere’s what you need to know about Terra and the company behind it.\\n\\nWhat is Terra?\\n\\nTerra is a blockchain project developed by Terraform Labs that powers the startup’s cryptocurrencies and financial apps. These cryptocurrencies include the Terra U.S. Dollar, or UST, that is pegged to the U.S. dollar through an algorithm.\\n\\nTerra is a [stablecoin](https://fortune.com/2019/01/30/stablecoins-bitcoin-cryptocurrency/) that is intended to reduce the volatility endemic to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Some stablecoins, like [Tether](https://fortune.com/2019/08/26/ethereum-tether/), are pegged to more conventional currencies, like the U.S. dollar, through cash and cash equivalents as opposed to an algorithm and associated reserve token.\\n\\nTo mint new UST tokens, a percentage of another digital token and reserve asset, Luna, is “burned.” If the demand for UST rises with more people using the currency, more Luna will be automatically burned and diverted to a community [pool](https://fortune.com/company/pool). That balancing act is supposed to help stabilize the price, to a degree. \\n   \\n  “Luna directly benefits from the economic growth of the Terra economy, and it suffers from contractions of the Terra coin,” Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon said.\\n\\nEach time someone buys something—like an ice cream—using UST, that transaction generates a fee, similar to a credit card transaction. That fee is then distributed to people who own Luna tokens, similar to a stock dividend.\\n\\nWho leads Terra?\\n\\nThe South Korean firm Terraform Labs was founded in 2018 by Daniel Shin and Kwon, who is now the company’s CEO. Kwon is a 29-year-old former [Microsoft](https://fortune.com/company/microsoft) employee; Shin now heads the Chai online payment service, a Terra partner. Kwon said many Koreans have used the Chai service to buy goods like movie tickets using Terra cryptocurrency.\\n\\nTerraform Labs does not make money from transactions using its crypto and instead relies on outside funding to operate, Kwon said. It has raised $57 million in funding from investors like HashKey Digital Asset Group, Divergence Digital Currency Fund, and Huobi Capital, according to deal-tracking service PitchBook. The amount raised is in addition to the latest $150 million funding commitment announced on July 16.\\n\\nWhat are Terra’s plans?\\n\\nTerraform Labs plans to use Terra’s blockchain and its associated cryptocurrencies—including one pegged to the Korean won—to create a digital financial system independent of major banks and fintech-app makers. So far, its main source of growth has been in Korea, where people have bought goods at stores, like coffee, using the Chai payment app that’s built on Terra’s blockchain. Kwon said the company’s associated Mirror trading app is experiencing growth in China and Thailand.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Kwon said Terraform Labs would use its latest $150 million in funding to invest in groups that build financial apps on Terra’s blockchain. He likened the scouting and investing in other groups as akin to a “Y Combinator demo day type of situation,” a reference to the popular startup pitch event organized by early-stage investor Y Combinator.\\n\\nThe combination of all these Terra-specific financial apps shows that Terraform Labs is “almost creating a kind of bank,” said Ryan Watkins, a senior research analyst at cryptocurrency consultancy Messari.\\n\\nIn addition to cryptocurrencies, Terraform Labs has a number of other projects including the Anchor app, a high-yield savings account for holders of the group’s digital coins. Meanwhile, people can use the firm’s associated Mirror app to create [synthetic financial assets](https://fortune.com/2021/07/06/fake-tesla-apple-stocks-trade-blockchains-crypto-exchange/) that mimic more conventional ones, like “tokenized” representations of corporate stocks. These synthetic assets are supposed to be helpful to people like “a small retail trader in Thailand” who can more easily buy shares and “get some exposure to the upside” of stocks that they otherwise wouldn’t have been able to obtain, Kwon said. But some critics have [said](https://fortune.com/2021/07/06/fake-tesla-apple-stocks-trade-blockchains-crypto-exchange/) the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may eventually crack down on synthetic stocks, which are currently unregulated.\\n\\nWhat do critics say?\\n\\nTerra still has a long way to go to catch up to bigger cryptocurrency projects like [Ethereum](https://fortune.com/2021/05/08/what-is-ethereum-price-why-is-it-surging-eth-blockchain-decentralized-apps-dapps-defi-buying-selling-crypto/). \\n\\nMost financial transactions involving Terra-related cryptocurrencies have originated in Korea, where its founders are based. Although Terra is becoming more popular in Korea thanks to rising interest in its partner Chai, it’s too early to say whether Terra-related currencies will gain traction in other countries.\\n\\nTerra’s blockchain runs on a “limited number of nodes,” said Messari’s Watkins, referring to the computers that help keep the system running. That helps reduce latency that may otherwise slow processing of financial transactions, he said.\\n\\nBut the tradeoff is that Terra is less “decentralized” than other blockchain platforms like Ethereum, which is powered by thousands of interconnected computing nodes worldwide. That could make Terra less appealing to some blockchain purists.\",\"timestamp\":1638429357,\"title\":\"What is Terra?\"},\"digest\":\"Y3zGpRD24bUT-5PjzwcPuwBAGjhcD2uhdUR8pvnP-Ag\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xbE86f4bc2609E60f483c64B9464694deE8Bf68b4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"VIJ-iVS9Lim4v4vbTSnEyi8vh4Da6bnoDTA-GIMStTk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"tARb_bYuGdsBFUgIwQmwiLWUvb2BabX9lduO5WXdmow\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"4ilZ7SjY5htQ4iUXZ0GUv3WG9G-jzHDIYx75f5Rt2crQ6WjGKVehHg1LiwguqtWjvH9nmWx7xBFjf2cLq3DaLg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x6502deaeaf50a4acc8669d5b1656c4518899a36ebda1bbbdb42503160519322578f3ea75c94b18d4c790cf6968cc94a3d4c0a06be36e53ca577b48b676f4e25f1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"VIJ-iVS9Lim4v4vbTSnEyi8vh4Da6bnoDTA-GIMStTk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"tARb_bYuGdsBFUgIwQmwiLWUvb2BabX9lduO5WXdmow\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Y3zGpRD24bUT-5PjzwcPuwBAGjhcD2uhdUR8pvnP-Ag\"}"
