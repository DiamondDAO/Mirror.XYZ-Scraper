"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I come from a poor and backward mountain village. Both my parents are poor farmers and they have no culture. What I am proud of is that my mother went to high school through hard work. This has changed my destiny more or less.\\n\\nMy childhood and even my entire youth were a cultural desert. Whenever I think of this great time, I have not absorbed any competitive thoughts, ways of thinking, wisdom, and my heart is aching. The textbook-like knowledge of elementary school, junior high school, high school, and university only increased my competitiveness a little, but did not make me much change.\\n\\nLater I recalled my childhood and youth. In the bones is still a ridiculously naive soul. People's thinking and culture must be professionally trained to be competitive. and\\n\\n128 Entrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs\\n\\nIt is generally impossible for children in rural areas to receive professional training. Without this kind of high-quality social education, children in rural areas are naturally weakened in competitiveness.\\n\\nBy chance, I was enlightened by a great god-level character, and I gradually understood the importance of learning. From then on, absorbing social knowledge crazily, and then realizing that desperate pursuit of one's heart is the meaning of life. I am not willing to be an ordinary person anymore.\\n\\nI developed from an IT technician to an office manager, then jumped to engineering sales, and then started my own business. It was all the result of following my heart. In this process, I gave up a lot of things, but the thoughtful things I got are even more precious. Every time I follow my heart, I feel that my thinking has been greatly improved, and my knowledge has also taken a great leap. Compared to me before, my competitiveness has increased several times. I feel more able to make money and feel safer to gain a foothold in society.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, the transformation of rural children can only be done on their own. I have deeply realized this, so I must follow my heart more firmly, start a business to change my destiny, and inspire to illuminate my life.\\n\\nI share profiteering Internet projects with many people, hoping that their destiny can change their own destiny through this greatest invention of mankind in the 20th century. Although we are not the sons of Gao Fushuai, when we leave this world that day, we will go to heaven as Gao Fushuai. Although I never want to go to heaven, I want to live forever.\",\"timestamp\":1634796681,\"title\":\"The inner talents who follow their own will become more and more competitive\"},\"digest\":\"20KJXfGDj_YcoTBlFZYew3NChVYldPTcKo7JBI8eWO4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"LP1L02LSu_jptxfRxqHecg3aIICDhOEyxB8lh40VUjVnsk6pu066H5eenZw7IYhzD9yqo0s5nyGe6YPBZtPuyA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"20KJXfGDj_YcoTBlFZYew3NChVYldPTcKo7JBI8eWO4\"}"
