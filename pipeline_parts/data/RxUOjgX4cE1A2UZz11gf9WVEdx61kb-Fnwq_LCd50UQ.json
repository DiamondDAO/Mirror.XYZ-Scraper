"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Salespersons are the most difficult group to manage. If they are managed well, the company's performance will rise rapidly. If they are not managed well, they will just wait for bankruptcy. Salesman positions are not standard positions, and their jobs are difficult to quantify from their daily work. For example, you can see that a salesman is working hard on the surface, but he is actually playing in an outside Internet cafe. Some salespersons seem to be joking and not doing anything, but their performance is very good. This makes many bosses a headache. If you want to manage the salesperson group well, you must start from the heart of managing salespersons. My strategy is to hold a small meeting with the salesman every day. This small meeting is not very formal. Of course, the formal ones are often opened.\\n\\nThe purpose is to:\\n\\nEntrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs 197\\n\\nStrengthen the ideological work of salesmen, let them identify with the company as much as possible, and identify with the company’s culture; salary rewards are 10% higher than those of their peers, divided into monthly rewards, quarterly rewards and annual rewards, so that those who resign casually will definitely lose; do Good career planning of each salesperson, so that they have room for improvement, have a head start, and set a good example because they have done a good job and become a business executive and business manager; the company must establish a complete customer file to record every customer’s A transaction information, the customer is in the hands of the company, not in the hands of the salesperson; a dedicated customer service department can be set up to contact the customer at any time, and the customer service will come forward during the holidays instead of the sales staff to send small gifts to the customers. Gifts, so that even if the salesperson resigns to someone else’s company, they will not take away our company’s customers.\\n\\nIn addition, starting a company does not satisfy all customers. Our childhood education is: To serve the people, no matter what we do, we hope that everyone is satisfied with us. In various management books and various media, you will see many cases where companies or organizations provide high-quality services to every customer so that everyone is satisfied. The boss of every large enterprise often speaks in public that our The purpose is to satisfy all our users. The bosses of these big companies actually pit many entrepreneurs when they say this: 110 policemen buy breakfast for citizens who call for help in the morning, and a certain company repairs air conditioners for free at 12 o’clock in the middle of the night. A certain company drove dozens of kilometers to give users a commodity worth more than ten yuan and so on. When I first started my business, I was determined in my heart to provide good service to satisfy all customers. Later, I found out that the cost was too high. For some customers, I only made a few hundred yuan, but in the end I kept looking for services later. In order to fulfill the promise, I paid thousands of yuan and added Artificial. If this continues, I will be bankrupted by these customers. Later, I thought, maybe those big bosses lied to me, and it was impossible to satisfy everyone, so I adjusted my business policy. Whoever gives more money, who is a major customer, I will do a good job of serving and whoever is. Small customers, whoever gives less money, I can just do a little bit of service. If I lose money, I will stop doing it, or if I want to do it, I will continue to charge. He is not happy, and I don’t care, he said he will never do it again. I don’t buy my products anymore, I’m still very\\n\\n198 Entrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs\\n\\nHappy, and finally one less troublesome customer.\\n\\nTherefore, our bosses are not only attracting customers to buy our products, I\\n\\nWe must also select high-quality customers and serve those who bring us a lot of profits, so that companies\\n\\nIn order to develop healthily.\",\"timestamp\":1634801912,\"title\":\"How to manage salesperson\"},\"digest\":\"nkBR785iYW2hQBhFZyjZ0dMyxZ5SRKRfr0hhqD4STHM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"0fgwRW5NZkRw7on_7qPn4QB9P_6onemVQkJiZSx80tySrQRB-EUPhDAeANfJ_6iR2jdh2rr16jjWlrchHKdcTg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"nkBR785iYW2hQBhFZyjZ0dMyxZ5SRKRfr0hhqD4STHM\"}"
