Since most symmetric primitives are relatively easy to modify in a way that makes them quantum resistant, efforts have focused on public-key cryptography, namely digital signatures and key encapsulation mechanisms. In December 2016 NIST initiated a standardization process by announcing a call for proposals.\\\\[7\\\\]\\n\\nThe competition is now in its third round out of expected four, where in each round some algorithms are discarded and others are studied more closely. NIST hopes to publish the standardization documents by 2024, but may speed up the process if major breakthroughs in quantum computing are made.\\n\\nIt is currently undecided whether the future standards be published as FIPS or as NIST Special Publication (SP).\\n\\nRound one\\nUnder consideration were:\\\\[8\\\\]\\n(strikethrough means it had been withdrawn)\\n\\nType\\tPKE/KEM\\tSignature\\tSignature & PKE/KEM\\nLattice\\t\\nCompact LWE\\nCRYSTALS-KYBER\\nDing Key Exchange\\nEMBLEM and R.EMBLEM\\nFrodoKEM\\nHILA5 (withdrawn and merged into round 5)\\nKCL (pka OKCN/AKCN/CNKE)\\nKINDI\\nLAC\\nLIMA\\nLizard\\nLOTUS\\nNewHope\\nNTRUEncrypt\\\\[9\\\\]\\nNTRU-HRSS-KEM\\nNTRU Prime\\nOdd Manhattan\\nRound2 (withdrawn and merged into Round5)\\nRound5 (merger of Round2 and Hila5, announced 4 August 2018)\\\\[10\\\\]\\nSABER\\nThree Bears\\nTitanium\\nCRYSTALS-DILITHIUM\\nDRS\\nFALCON\\npqNTRUSign\\\\[9\\\\]\\nqTESLA\\nCode-based\\t\\nBIG QUAKE\\nBIKE\\nClassic McEliece + NTS-KEM\\nDAGS\\nEdon-K\\nHQC\\nLAKE (withdrawn and merged into ROLLO)\\nLEDAkem\\nLEDApkc\\nLepton\\nLOCKER (withdrawn and merged into ROLLO)\\nMcNie\\nNTS-KEM\\nROLLO (merger of Ouroboros-R, LAKE and LOCKER) \\\\[11\\\\]\\nOuroboros-R (withdrawn and merged into ROLLO)\\nQC-MDPC KEM\\nRamstake\\nRLCE-KEM\\nRQC\\npqsigRM\\nRaCoSS\\nRankSign\\nHash-based\\t\\t\\nGravity-SPHINCS\\nSPHINCS+\\nMultivariate\\t\\nCFPKM\\nGiophantus\\nDualModeMS\\nGeMSS\\nGui\\nHiMQ-3\\nLUOV\\nMQDSS\\nRainbow\\nSRTPI\\nDME\\nBraid group\\t\\t\\nWalnutDSA\\nSupersingular elliptic curve isogeny\\t\\nSIKE\\nSatirical submission\\t\\t\\t\\npqRSA\\\\[12\\\\]\\\\[13\\\\]\\nOther\\t\\nGuess Again\\nHK17\\nMersenne-756839\\nRVB\\nPicnic\\nRound one submissions published attacks\\nGuess Again by Lorenz Panny \\\\[14\\\\]\\nRVB by Lorenz Panny\\\\[15\\\\]\\nRaCoSS by Daniel J.

The first track contains the algorithms which appear to have the most promise, and will be considered for standardization at the end of the third round. Algorithms in the second track could still become part of the standard, after the third round ends.\\\\[51\\\\] NIST expects some of the alternate candidates to be considered in a fourth round. NIST also suggests it may re-open the signature category for new schemes proposals in the future.\\\\[52\\\\]\\n\\nOn June 7-9, 2021, NIST conducted the third PQC standardization conference, virtually.\\\\[53\\\\] The conference included candidates' updates and discussions on implementations, on performances, and on security issues of the candidates. A small amount of focus was spent on intellectual property concerns.\\n\\nFinalists\\nType\\tPKE/KEM\\tSignature\\nLattice\\\\[a\\\\]\\t\\nCRYSTALS-KYBER\\nNTRU\\nSABER\\nCRYSTALS-DILITHIUM\\nFALCON\\nCode-based\\t\\nClassic McEliece\\nMultivariate\\t\\t\\nRainbow\\nAlternate candidates\\nType\\tPKE/KEM\\tSignature\\nLattice\\t\\nFrodoKEM\\nNTRU Prime\\nCode-based\\t\\nBIKE\\nHQC\\nHash-based\\t\\t\\nSPHINCS+\\nMultivariate\\t\\t\\nGeMSS\\nSupersingular elliptic curve isogeny\\t\\nSIKE\\nZero-knowledge proofs\\t\\t\\nPicnic\\nIntellectual property concerns\\nAfter NIST's announcement regarding the finalists and the alternate candidates, various intellectual property concerns were voiced, notably surrounding lattice-based schemes such as Kyber and NewHope. NIST holds signed statements from submitting groups clearing any legal claims, but there is still a concern that third parties could raise claims. NIST claims that they will take such considerations into account while picking the winning algorithms.\\\\[54\\\\]\\n\\nAdaptations\\nDuring this round, some candidates have shown to be vulnerable to some attack vectors. It forces this candidates to adapt accordingly:\\n\\nCRYSTAL-KYBER and SABER - may change the nested hashes used in their proposals in order for their security claims to hold.\\\\[55\\\\]\\nFALCON - side channel attack by . A masking may be added in order to resist the attack. This adaptation affects performance and should be considered while standardizing.\\\\[56\\\\]\",\"timestamp\":1640696647,\"title\":\"NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization\"},\"digest\":\"Ct6kLATM8Azy3b5THtUutEcLI7HThSByPdccu9VSSPk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xC73A0868C34ba8620f8a9D64ECe8Dc805D94d877\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"skYqs4lpi7eqkKXaZlSHKWJC91A9aYWGB-gOap81Y-0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"238t8WZ-9CdCQ2t31_cHaKYhYSLF7dHviJ44gHFC07Y\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"1gEOMd3tS5E1i-DyOhN2IntXEfhrH5QrguupjKQT_M2-ZFub20C7dKLe_k7nwxL2JJs8xPqHjj151u3-UxFsrw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xca7d93ea4a9f315ebbd83d03c2f594ad2dfdf2b79444dc23a04c34781ba0f7ae08505205da9d833b591276297115582ddcb873bd4e309c1b0b67f6c3b29d32b01c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"skYqs4lpi7eqkKXaZlSHKWJC91A9aYWGB-gOap81Y-0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"238t8WZ-9CdCQ2t31_cHaKYhYSLF7dHviJ44gHFC07Y\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Ct6kLATM8Azy3b5THtUutEcLI7HThSByPdccu9VSSPk\"}"
