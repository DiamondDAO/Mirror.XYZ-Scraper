A hostile takeover of power is what many in Sudan and beyond have feared could happen anytime. The signs have been all too clear.\\n\\nA pro-military sit-in right in front of the presidential palace in Khartoum was seen as choreographed to lead to a coup. No attempt was made to disguise its purpose. The protesters demanded that the military overthrow \\\"failed\\\" civilian leaders. It was an unusual attempt at legitimising a military takeover, using the guise of a popular protest.\\n\\nNearly a week later, a counter-protest was held. This time, huge crowds came out in support of the civilian government.\\n\\nWith more protests called by pro-democracy groups to \\\"counter a military coup\\\", Sudan could be set for yet another period of showdown between the armed forces and the people.\\n\\nThe country has made huge strides in normalising ties with the West and unlocking much-needed funding streams. The promise of transition to democracy has kept many Sudanese and the country's allies hopeful. But all that could be at risk now.\\n\\nMedia caption,Thousands join a protest to back the military and oppose the government\\n\\nThe military and civilian transitional authorities have ruled together since President Bashir was toppled after months of street protests in 2019.\\n\\nA power-sharing deal between the military and a loose coalition of groups - the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC) - had been agreed, launching the Sovereign Council.\\n\\nIt was to rule the country for another year - with the aim of holding elections and transitioning to civilian rule.\\n\\nBut the deal has always been fractious, with a large number of rival political groups - and divisions within the military too.\\n\\nTensions grew further after [a coup attempt attributed to followers of Mr Bashir was foiled in September](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-58629978).\\n\\nSudan has been unable to find a workable political system since independence in 1956 and has seen numerous coups and coup attempts.\",\"timestamp\":1635153338,\"title\":\"Sudan's civilian leaders arrested amid coup reports\"},\"digest\":\"sZWFWkX_CA31OB9nU6hzHQiDy6liCaR6zXvDiUBefTI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8073DB17391a3781b4a401FD4adA047A0c318a6E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bMJQ4QlRsaCx4afIgQDaw-I7cMzEF-jaN3i1GMXGZuk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"p-MMxEtqTGAD4Cki4qJt6b0OkfkPCOSs0EQb0NGeVmY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"3an1z0FfKAo51RalbTYSszULiannrIn2429CO4a8rJPaSvtmgK64oc8UYmtlr6jKlnKL7-nHJfgpAuj3rp0Wvw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa5f23ea9faf614a59500957c292bcabefa2795406d0bfbfb8a6223a05aac428e37164f99821a72298797a7ebf131981e7fbe1ee8b8d4d712836e2a1ed717689c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bMJQ4QlRsaCx4afIgQDaw-I7cMzEF-jaN3i1GMXGZuk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"p-MMxEtqTGAD4Cki4qJt6b0OkfkPCOSs0EQb0NGeVmY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"sZWFWkX_CA31OB9nU6hzHQiDy6liCaR6zXvDiUBefTI\"}"
