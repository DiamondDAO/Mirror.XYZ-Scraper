"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"This discussion is limited to certain popular online or page-based games, not including board games, military strategy and other games close to pure intelligence.\\n\\nSince the game is operated by a commercial company, the designer's aim is of course to provide a stable profit return model and make the game complex and subtle in design. Players are deeply involved in it, and even as long as they have a visible ranking in the whole service, they think that the previous investment is still worthwhile, and the game's winning game seems to eliminate the day's accumulated temper.\\n\\nFrom the operator's point of view, the players are into the treasure only, the game content has nothing to do with it, everything serves to keep the interest of customers, maintain the stability of the currency trading system, regularly follow the trend, update the elements, add some new ways to play, stick to the customer is the job, or even the only important responsibility.\\n\\nBut players, ah, they have to have a responsibility too, and it's impossible to get the officials to maintain the big and small things that happen in the game world, and as said above, unless it does have a long-lasting negative impact on the game operations, players have to solve it all by themselves. A particular online game corresponds to a certain community of people in the real world, and everything is no more than a feud between people, except that in the virtual world, people are invisible to each other, as if the world is dark one day, so things like burning and robbing will naturally appear, and people can do everything they wouldn't dare to do on a regular basis. In such a virtual world, emotions are magnified, and everyone can recklessly knock vicious curses in the chat window, or go against the rules of the game and carry out \\\"criminal activities\\\" such as vendetta, fraud, blackmail, etc., and all this without being held responsible.\\n\\nGames can reflect another side of a person - a dark side that is not easily revealed in real life.\\n\\nHow much a game community is good or bad can be determined by the design structure inherent in a game. More luck, speculative components (i.e. the winning rate depends on the set probability), then it will attract those who love to do nothing and speculate in reality; more veteran players dominate the server (newcomers are discriminated against and mocked), then it will attract those who live on relationships and like to gang up on people; more money determines the strength of the components (RMB warriors), then it will attract those who live in reality Those who spend money to buy titles, spend money to buy laws ...... These people as the mainstream, forming a community, representing the game \\\"really suitable\\\" people, want to play well in this game, the best to meet that standard.\\n\\nIn fact, the above examples highlight certain facets, and perhaps only in some trash page game to see this design. Generally mature, regular companies operating games are trying to maintain a balance - the so-called put a long line, fishing for big fish. In addition to ... In some special periods of the company (such as liquidity or something), the company will sacrifice part of the design to break the balance, which is not without its own.\\n\\nThe former relies on equipment, props, dress up and other elements designed around the game itself, while the latter relies on pop-ups, traffic, commercial promotion ...... Now the Chinese community so pompous, the reason, product design is part (in the official promotion), the other part, the virtual world, but also, after all, is the real world of people, people were lack of self-control animals, the Internet so chaotic, without the restrictions of the external world, you can indulge yourself at will.\",\"timestamp\":1635693969,\"title\":\"Major drawbacks of onine games\"},\"digest\":\"seHYXGdX-jlnU9uSBRg0upaqWLzYiitOu04Py5wXCsY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x896002E29FE4CDa28A3ae139b0bf7bAc26B33a8C\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"gsXkAKdmQ9iQBpQLPUhp1XW_HL2cZ2FRXclNbrJmnsM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"j5nZ4gu4D8aoX3ynJ4b-ud1ZI6B-b9ChXlyxSlHL0tk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"4kb2Hky9F_FGoxw1T9-XBwpnc3Q7xdIBARYEuoVUF4gxnnHZlhJaR6fOv4BGFCRuY5Sk_3Y7vv62o1ReUFf0nA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe98489d0a83781271f643a33e30d83a985935f6feafed697109abbf6e55998df1c9a23b72a3d52afd0e1b0af12d905ca63da642cff300250561098b54f0324091b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"gsXkAKdmQ9iQBpQLPUhp1XW_HL2cZ2FRXclNbrJmnsM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"j5nZ4gu4D8aoX3ynJ4b-ud1ZI6B-b9ChXlyxSlHL0tk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"seHYXGdX-jlnU9uSBRg0upaqWLzYiitOu04Py5wXCsY\"}"
