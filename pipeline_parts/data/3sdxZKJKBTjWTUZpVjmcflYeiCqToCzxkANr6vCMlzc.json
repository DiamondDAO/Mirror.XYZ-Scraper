"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"***Each new job I’ve had gets harder and harder to explain to friends and family. Now, I’m joining Aragon, a DAO that builds tools for DAOs! Sorry friends and family. Here is what I’m up to now, and why I’m excited about it.***\\n\\n*You may want to skip to a relevant section:*\\n\\n* *What’s Web3?*\\n* *And DAOs?*\\n* *So what? Will DAOs achieve some meaningful impact?*\\n* *What’s Aragon?*\\n* *Ok, but what will you actually do?*\\n\\n*What’s Web3?*\\n\\nOk, so you know about cryptocurrencies, and that blockchain is the technology behind it for building decentralised technology. There’s been a new wave of enthusiasm for this area along with a rebranding of it called “Web3”.\\n\\nThe story goes that Web1 was the first version of the internet, mostly static pages that you could read. Web2 was where it was easier for any user to add content (think Facebook posts, Airbnb hostings) - on top of platforms that start to centralise huge resources and power (Facebook, Google, Amazon). Web3 is the idea that the mass of internet users will not only read and write on platforms, but own those platforms too. That’s because Web3 companies are funded by, built by, and maintained by their users, who earn shares (called ‘tokens’ for doing so.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1459036992050716697](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1459036992050716697)\\n\\nThis is a great rebrand for crypto because it points towards how it can go beyond just financial speculation, and build new systems for society.\\n\\n*And DAOs?*\\n\\nTo govern and facilitate these decentralised organisations, is the concept of “DAOs” - decentralised autonomous organisations. “Decentralised” meaning there is no central leadership, and decisions are made bottom-up (by the community that owns the tokens). “Autonomous”, like a self-driving car, meaning that the idea takes on a life of its own to make itself happen - imagine the ‘CEO’ and founding team leave the project - the project has in-built incentive systems for the community to keep driving itself forwards (coincidentally, this has happened at Aragon).\\n\\nAt its core a DAO is “an internet community with a shared bank account” (shared crypto wallet). Around that, you have an emerging set of tools designed for DAOs (“Web3 tooling”). For example, these are tools that let you automatically measure value created in a community ([SourceCred](https://twitter.com/sourcecred)), or make it easy for members to reward each other ([Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/)). And around all that tech, you have an emerging set of norms and culture: incredible cross-pollination, collaborative dynamics and positivity - the ‘CEO’ of one DAO likely spends most of their time in 3 other DAOs working on similar problems; lead developers from different projects sit next to each other in coworking spaces exchanging notes.\\n\\nThe most illustrative hot example is ConstitutionDAO - a group that got together and within a few days raised $40 million in order to buy the US Constitution, and from there steward it as a community (e.g. decide which museums to put it in). (Read more about [the rise](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/nov/19/original-copy-of-us-constitution-sells-for-record-43m?ref=upstract.com&curator=upstract.com&utm_source=upstract.com), [the fall](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjb8av/constitutiondao-aftermath-everyone-very-mad-confused-losing-lots-of-money-fighting-crying-etc)).\\n\\nDAOs use governance tools (like Aragon) to operate. They can create a token (i.e. raise funds together and distribute ownership) - like crowdfunding, but where you get ownership and decision-making power, instead of a complementary t-shirt. They enable you to vote on binding decisions. And they (should) have mechanisms for dispute resolution. \\n\\n*So what? Will DAOs achieve some meaningful impact?*\\n\\nSo here we arrive at my observations and personal view. It’s very early days, but DAOs are already controlling a significant amount of resources - $15.8 billion ([insightful stats here](https://deepdao.io/#/deepdao/dashboard)). To put it in perspective, the treasury of the United Kingdom holds around $90 billion ([from here](https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Departmental-Overview-Department-for-HM-Treasury-2017-18.pdf)).\\n\\nThe bulk of these DAOs are in finance (DeFi) driven by the speculation bubble, then protocols and infrastructure for the crypto world, and then gaming guilds (gamers who club together to pursue quests and share the spoils). This is probably not ‘meaningful impact’, but they could be seen as useful environmental conditions for change (money, infrastructure, culture).\\n\\nThat said, there are green shoots of promise for impact. Solutions are cropping up that challenge some of the worst systemic failures we have as a society. After all, if you want to change today’s world, starting with an alternative funding and incentives model is a good route to try.\\n\\n* [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/) is collectively funding, researching, and commercialising longevity research in order to make it open (alternative to the pharma model)\\n* [ResearchHub](https://www.researchhub.com/) is a ‘github for science’ to make papers open and free, (as an alternative to the closed and slow journals system).\\n* [Seeds](https://joinseeds.earth/) and [Regen Network](https://www.regen.network/) are creating an economy around regenerative land management (creating an incentive to steward land rather than extract from it)\\n* [KlimaDAO ](https://docs.klimadao.finance/klima.fi-manifesto)is helping build infrastructure for carbon markets missed by the current funding system\\n* [Althea Network](https://www.althea.net/faqs) is a community owned and run internet service provider for rural areas, where members provide bandwidth and relay internet to each other; [ENS](https://ens.domains/) provides domain names in Web3, owned by the community - the idea of the technical infrastructure of the web being community owned points in the direction of a healthier internet.\\n* GitCoin and Optimism are experimenting with new grant mechanisms for funding public goods ([link](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/11/16/retro1.html)) (alternative to the arduous and inefficient grant systems - if you know, you know)\\n* The founder of Ethereum is [pushing for using decentralized prediction markets to help moderate content](https://ethresear.ch/t/prediction-markets-for-content-curation-daos/1312) and curation (an antidote to click driven media and fake news)\\n* Getting even more utopian...[CityDAO](https://www.citydao.io/) is buying up land with plans to build a city from scratch, driven by the ideology of decentralised governance, and [Democracy Earth](https://democracy.earth/)/[Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/) and [Circles](https://joincircles.net/) are working on universal basic income (real people are already receiving real money).\\n* \\n\\nAt the very least, this is a hotbed of experiments that interesting things will spawn from. At most, it could be systemic change.\\n\\nIt is early days, and the big questions determining whether Web3 and DAOs are worthwhile are still to play for. Will Web3 be representative and diverse? Will it be dominated by rich white men, or will it thrive from women prioritising flexible work and talent from around the world with fewer barriers? Will it be speculation focused or real value focused? It's not cooked yet. I’m in a fortunate position that I can take a punt on it and try to push in a positive direction on these points.\\n\\nOne of the reasons I’m optimistic is looking at it socioeconomically. Who are the people who hold the resources in the crypto world versus in the traditional world? The rich people here are the early adopters of Bitcoin and Ethereum - idealistic, seeking system change, and highly experimental. And who are the people working in this space? This year there has been an influx of people from economics, technology, law, social sciences, and this melting pot is reaching a critical mass. So even if you take technology out of the equation, as a social and economic phenomenon, Web3 has the right winds behind it.\\n\\n*What is Aragon?*\\n\\nAragon was the first organisation working on the concept of DAOs, starting in 2017 to build tools to make it ‘easy’ and safe to set up a DAO. It has a legacy of going against the grain, building DAO infrastructure through crypto winters and [early disaster](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao) in the space.. It’s open source, with many organisations building their own modules on top. It’s owned by the community, it is a DAO, and has the vision to bring this approach to the world and empower an ideal driven ‘fight for freedom’.\\n\\nAragon has some scale (2,000 organisations, with 60,000 members, use Aragon for governing over $1bn in managed assets) but this is a drop in the ocean for where it can get to.\\n\\nI’m in the Aragon Association, a non-profit, temporary organisation of around 50 people that are stewards of the Aragon treasury ($350m). The Association’s mission is to build tools to achieve the vision, coordinate the community, and gradually decentralise fully. There’s already a large (by the measure of traditional organisations) degree of decentralisation - strategic decisions are voted on, and work ranging from tech support to partnerships development is carried forward by the community - but we should be decentralising our jobs over time.\\n\\n*Ok, but what will you actually do?*\\n\\nI’ll be working on the go-to-market strategy for 2022, together with the community.\\n\\nWe have this green space with a lot of excitement, a lot of people and resources flooding in, and a lot of froth - but it’s so early and the promised impact is not there yet. I’m working on figuring out: where is this space going? Who should we serve? Who can use these tools to make a meaningful impact? What do they need? How do we as a community engage them and mobilise impact?\\n\\n*If you’re interested in these topics, I’d love to hear from you! Perhaps we can learn along together.*\\n\\n*I’ll be spending more time on Twitter again - my handle is @_harrywilson.*\",\"timestamp\":1638366834,\"title\":\"What’s the point of DAOs and Web3?
