"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*‚ÄúWe choose to go to the Moon, not because it is easy, but because it is fun.‚Äù* **-JFK (probably)**\\n\\nMoonDAO is an international collective of people united by the mission of decentralizing access to space research and exploration. We have a multi-year roadmap with ambitious milestones for space exploration. Our funding cycle is open until the next full moon (January 17th, 2022), if you like what we‚Äôre about, you can contribute [here](https://juicebox.money/#/p/moondao) in exchange for governance tokens. We did not pre-mine any coins for the founders, VC investors, or anyone else, everyone receives the same terms! Also, this will be our one and only token supply creation. Also, if you‚Äôd like to get involved you can [join our Discord](http://discord.gg/5nAu7K9aES) to learn more about our goals, including to send someone to space in 2022!\\n\\n### Hold on, what exactly is MoonDAO?\\n\\nIf you‚Äôre new to web3 or not hip on all the lingo: MoonDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO for short). This means we are a group of people that coordinate online in a decentralized manner and are united by a common mission. In our case, our mission is simple: **To decentralize access to space research and exploration**.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/OfficialMoonDAO/status/1468283164456062981?s=20](https://twitter.com/OfficialMoonDAO/status/1468283164456062981?s=20)\\n\\n### Why should we decentralize access to space?\\n\\nWe are currently living at the inflection point of a privatized space race. The implications of this exponential takeoff is massive, and its outcomes will define our future. Few people comprehend the magnitude of the opportunity to go to the Moon or Mars.\\n\\nCreating an economic connection with an entirely new planet will be such a massive wealth creation opportunity that few can wrap their heads around. Trillions and trillions of dollars in mining for materials, manufacturing off-world, and constructing new civilizations. And who would benefit most from this? The people that are *already* the richest in the world: Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX, Jeff Bezos‚Äôs Blue Origin, Richard Branson‚Äôs Virgin Galactic.\\n\\n![Just sayin'](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/krI6vbSdL8JXXci86PFdK.png?height=900&width=1200)\\n\\nNow, we don‚Äôt doubt that making life multi-planetary is a bad goal, quite the opposite, **we believe that making life multi-planetary is one of the most inspiring and important missions in our lifetime**, the big question is: *how?*\\n\\n**We believe that an international, decentralized, inclusive, and transparent organization would be much better aligned with the needs of the everyday person.**\\n\\nAt MoonDAO we do not believe in \\\"Emperors of the Moon,\\\" ‚ÄúKings of Mars,‚Äù or \\\"CEOs of Space,\\\" but instead **we believe in extending the unalienable rights of citizens of planet earth to the solar system and beyond, and sharing the benefits of space exploration with ‚Äúthe people.‚Äù**\\n\\nSpace travel isn‚Äôt nearly as far off as you might think, either, we are on the precipice of an exponential curve:\\n\\n![Crypto isn't the only exponential curve in town. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZLgEQ_PaFkkc1gn2N5kJx.png?height=480&width=680)\\n\\n*Ok I see, so‚Ä¶ how do you intend on going to the Moon as a DAO?*\\n\\n## MoonDAO‚Äôs Roadmap\\n\\n![\\\"The Crypto-Token to Moon-Colony Pipeline.\\\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gCSAGzAL_QJL2ToyOuDXP.png?height=500&width=1500)\\n\\n### üåí¬†Moon Phase 1: Deploy a token for decentralized governance of MoonDAO.\\n\\n**Our funding goal:** The primary goal is to decentralize the governance of MoonDAO, but in order to fund our project we need capital. Some tickets for low earth orbit are being advertised for ‚Äúas low as‚Äù $450,000, but tickets in auction have gone up to $28 Million dollars. This token raise won‚Äôt be our only opportunity to raise funds, but ideally this token gives us enough runway to achieve Moon phase 2.\\n\\nIn order to be a DAO, we need a governance token for decision making. This is our first step. **There is no expectation of profit with this token, this token‚Äôs purpose is to coordinate our governance.**\\n\\nIt is very important to note that **the core team has not pre-mined any tokens for ourselves.** We have not given ‚Äúspecial terms‚Äù to any Venture Capitalists, Influencers, Angel Investors, Rich Friends or Family, or any other person. We are all being treated equally.\\n\\nEvery investor, builder, or fren, big or small, **has gotten the same terms**. No special treatment for anyone. This is unusual for an Ethereum project, but we thought it would be more fair for everyone involved that we did not airdrop or pre-mine any number of tokens for people ahead of time. We are not VC funded, we are community organized and led, this is very important to us!\\n\\n**What are the properties of this token?**\\n\\n1. Our token will have a fixed supply. Once our initial token raise is over, **we will never increase the supply of the tokens.**\\n2. Our token will be used for governance decisions. We will have proportional governance up to a community decided limit. The limit is needed so that if one person buys more than 51% of the tokens they cannot centrally control the DAO‚Äôs decisions. To begin, we will use a 4% limit of the total coin supply, however anyone is welcome to purchase more than 4% if they would like to contribute more.\\n3. The money raised from this token will fund the workers (NFT designers, website developers, solidity developers, marketing, legal consulting, etc.) needed to complete the rest of the roadmap.\\n4. The token raise will occur on [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money), and for every contribution we will create governance tokens at a fixed rate. You will receive a portion of those tokens in your wallet, and then some will stay with the DAO in order to fund the work required to make this DAO function, and those tokens will form part of the shared treasury that you can vote on with your tokens.\\n\\nThere is no expectation of profit with this token. It is a governance token. You are not receiving fractionalized ownership of the DAOs assets in exchange for the token, check our FAQs for more information and disclaimers.\\n\\n[https://moondao.com/docs/faq](https://moondao.com/docs/faq)\\n\\n### üåì¬†Moon Phase 2: Send a MoonDAO member to space in 2022.\\n\\n1. We will release the *Ticket to Space* NFT collection. **These tickets will put you into a lottery to win a ticket to fly to space in 2022**.\\n2. The money raised from the sale of these NFTs will be used to buy tickets to space on a SpaceX/Blue Origin/Virgin Galactic etc. rocket ship.\\n3. Send MoonDAO member(s) to space in 2022.\\n\\n**How much will this cost?** Virgin Galactic advertises its tickets will be sold for ‚Äúas low as‚Äù $450K and it has been reported that Blue Origin‚Äôs tickets are have gone up for auction for over $28M. The range is large. MoonDAO wants to help create a world where anyone can fly to space regardless of their financial situation. We hope that this can be a meaningful and inspirational first step in decentralizing space exploration.\\n\\nSo far in history, space exploration has been gated to the rest of the world ‚Äî accessible to only the privileged. MoonDAO changes this for the first time in history.\\n\\n### üåî¬†Moon Phase 3: Provide funding to space research and exploration.\\n\\nWe don‚Äôt want to just take a ride on someone else‚Äôs rockets, we‚Äôd like to fund and coordinate our own plans. We think an international collective could move much faster than any red-taped organization, and we can contract out certain aspects of rocket development to private companies -- just like NASA.\\n\\nThe exploration of space should unify the world, not pit us against each other like the last space race. After all, aren't we all just curious earthlings that want to explore the unknown? Now, Web 3.0 represents a technology that can unify earthlings and decentralize space exploration.\\n\\n### üåï¬†Moon Phase 4: Put a MoonDAO colony on the Moon.\\n\\nThat's¬†one small step for a DAO, one giant leap for DAO-kind.\\n\\nThe 1967 Space Treaty forms the basis for all law concerning space. In this treaty it states that no *national* appropriation of the Moon can take place. However, a DAO is not a nation ‚Äî it is an international collective of frens.\\n\\nWe have the opportunity to use these new governance and coordination tools in order to form a more perfect union as we extend the rights and liberties of every human on earth into the solar system.\\n\\n### üåù¬†Moon Phase 5: Have sweet Moon parties (everyone's invited).\\n\\nThey're gonna be sweet. BYOB but we'll provide transportation.\\n\\n## Our Values\\n\\nWe don‚Äôt want to get on our soapbox too much, but MoonDAO has very strong values and a strong vision.\\n\\nScaling DAOs is difficult, scaling any organization is difficult. We want MoonDAO to last for year and years, and to outlive any individual member. In order to scale this DAO we abide by strong values:\\n\\n### Space should be in the hands of the people.\\n\\n**ALL** the people, with **NO special treatment** to any single group, nation, or private entity.\\n\\n**This is why we have no pre-mine, no whitelisting, no special treatment to influencers, investors, VCs, our close friends, or the founders themselves.**\\n\\nWe uphold values of inclusion, peace, transparency, freedom of organization and speech. Space should be in the hands of the people.\\n\\nMoonDAO will support funding for individuals to go to space, acquisition of collectively governed assets (like our own rockets üëÄ), and fund future space research and exploration as it fits into the mission of becoming the governing body for the moon and other celestial bodies.\\n\\n## Who is behind this?\\n\\nKori Rogers and myself found each other on Discord after the fallout of ConstitutionDAO. I myself was a core developer at ConstitutionDAO, but ultimately I resigned after a disagreement with some of the other core contributors. I learned a lot from my time at ConstitutionDAO and I‚Äôm taking the learnings to MoonDAO.\\n\\nWe have now built an awesome team at MoonDAO, when asked to write bios many say things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not good at self-promotion,‚Äù and I think the ethos of MoonDAO is not about making it ‚Äúabout‚Äù any single contributor. However, it is only human nature to be skeptical of organizations without a clear face or reputation behind it, so Kori and I have written some bios so people can get to know us -- however we do not claim to be the leaders, nor do we want any special treatment once the DAO reaches maturity. We are DAO members first, not ‚Äúcore contributors‚Äù or anything like that.\\n\\n### Pablo Moncada-Larrotiz‚Äã\\n\\n**Bio:** ‚ÄúHey I'm Pablo, I used to work in BigTech but then I dropped out after seeing where the world could be heading with centralized control over billion's of people's lives. I see cryptographic decentralization as a key component of the solution to fixing these problems. My full-time attention is on JuntoDAO: a DAO to allow people to collectively govern their real life and digital assets with smart contacts, basically making it easier to share things with your friends. Before that I worked at Waymo (Google's self driving car), YoutubeVR (real-time server-side rendering, light-field enthusiast), and in biotech (developing a bioreactor to engineer human body parts). I mostly grew up in Ann Arbor, MI, and went to Michigan (Go Blue!), but I'm very culturally Spanish and lived in Zaragoza as a kid.‚Äù\\n\\nTwitter: [@LarrotizPablo](https://twitter.com/LarrotizPablo) || DiscordID: @pmoncada\\n\\n### Kori Rogers‚Äã\\n\\n**Bio:** ‚ÄúHey all!
