"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The meta universe is a virtual environment in which people can share their experiences and participate in real-time simulated events. For those who believe that Metaverse has commercial prospects, 2020 is a watershed moment. This year, Metaverse began to gain traction outside the entertainment industry and began to penetrate the mainstream market.\\n\\nMetaverse is the next stage in the development of the Internet, allowing users to immerse themselves in virtual reality. The main features of Metaverse include real-time participation, economy, active community, digital avatar, and cross-platform accessibility.\\n\\nIn terms of application, games are already an integral part of the meta-universe, and so is blockchain technology. Together, they redefine the game industry. Integrating NFTs to transform the game economy is one of the biggest innovations currently driving games and meta-universe applications.\\n\\nBefore the blockchain entered the global game industry, games had always been built on a centralized system. Among them, everything works in the same way-all assets, history, data and game currency are under the control of the central system at all times. Therefore, the creator retains full ownership of the game's intellectual property rights.\\n\\nThis year, the NFT industry has developed rapidly, thanks to NFT artwork, which uses the transparency of the blockchain and a secure digital ledger to verify the authenticity of unique products. It provides gamers with a viable means to formally own their digital assets, which enables them to benefit from their game characters. It also paved the way for a new gaming revenue model called play-to-earn (P2E model). In the new mode, players can get rewards.\\n\\nAlthough NFT is just getting started, it has been adopted on a large scale in 2021.\\n\\nAccording to Google Trends, NFT began to develop rapidly in February this year. After NFT sales involving digital art and top NBA shooters became popular, NFT became popular. For companies like Dapper Labs, the sales and resale of these NFTs have exceeded $780 million. Christie’s auctioned Beeple’s NFT digital collage for US$69.3 million in March, which seems completely incomprehensible, but it’s true.\\n\\nIn October 2017, NFT emerged with the launch of CryptoPunks, the world's first \\\"rare digital art\\\" market. At that time, they were just unforgeable tokens, without any exposure outside the blockchain community.\\n\\nAccording to data from nonfungible.com, NFT sales in the first three months of 2021 exceeded US$2 billion, an increase of 2100% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. According to data from DappRadar, in July 2021, NFT sales reached 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for almost half of the total annual sales of 2.5 billion U.S. dollars.\\n\\nThe rarity of NFT is a key factor in its attractiveness. For example, in the CryptoKitties game, user collection and breeding of digital cats are represented by a unique NFT. Some CryptoKitties are considered rare collectibles, which makes them more valuable in the eyes of collectors who value rarity.\\n\\nMetaverse, games, blockchain, and NFT are combined in a wonderful way, not only providing an entertainment center, but also providing players with an open channel for them to get rewards through the game. SIDUS is one of the game companies that use these four technologies to bring players an unparalleled gaming experience.\\n\\nSIDUS meta-universe is a game meta-universe based on P2E mode and NFT. It is rapidly developing into a 3D game. It is ready to compete with 3D games that have not yet utilized the blockchain play-2-earn (P2E) function.\\n\\nInterestingly, \\\"SIDUS Heroes\\\" is bringing key innovations to the gaming industry. It is one of the first NFT-based massively multiplayer online role-playing games. In the SIDUS meta-universe, players can choose to breed pets, participate in the PVP arena, trade assets and craft resources in the game, and build homes in different places in the galaxy.\\n\\nSo far, the play-to-earn model has been very successful, attracting the attention of a large number of high-level game players, developers and investors. Blockchain games are cultivating a strong cooperative community for their players, attracting more people to participate in this industry.\\n\\nThe gaming industry is a great application case of blockchain technology\\n\\nAccording to a survey conducted by the NFT tracking website DappRadar, more than 1 million digital wallets were connected to decentralized gaming applications every day in October, accounting for 55% of the entire blockchain field. Online games are undoubtedly a blockchain giant.\\n\\nThe global game market is expected to expand by 50%, from $178.4 billion in 2021 to $268.8 billion in 2025. Why don't game developers apply blockchain technology, cryptocurrency and NFT to their games? A recent study shows that developers are now applying blockchain technology to their platforms.\\n\\nAccording to a recent survey by the major blockchain platform Stratis, more than half (58%) of the 197 interviewed video game developers in the United States and the United Kingdom are currently experimenting with blockchain technology. And nearly half of the respondents (47%) claimed to have begun to apply NFT in their games.\\n\\nBrands in 2020 may need to start forming meta universe and blockchain teams to help them enter the Web 3.0 era. Many companies thought they would never need social media in the early 21st century, but today, social media has become a key sales channel. The same is true for blockchain technology.\\n\\nFinal thoughts\\n\\nJust like the classic project management problem \\\"cheap, good, and fast-choose two from three\\\", blockchain tries to strike a balance between decentralization, scalability, and security. Since there are so many stakeholders who can benefit, why hasn't blockchain technology been widely adopted in the gaming field? One of the factors is time, but this day will eventually come.\",\"timestamp\":1639481025,\"title\":\"Metaverse: Blockchain and NFT will become mainstream\"},\"digest\":\"URK2IhrCWvU214l_Sfqvoh6Yu-nLzqQ8ZXrgmTqFJ2U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x18575C04BE0C2Cd9B9D1674D554d205c1629A766\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Q8G30YtKABitYnO86Qou8v8ZQPvw42bIlinKjYwU9fY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MiO1gU20wpAf-quTxgoGpbUC-aa3KRHmOUscsZrPTcY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"kloF8PITvmoxUkjK8msqt0uHLiw75qmRdrjlV5Ba63zFCzOXXwFtN267QMIWpDF-Wi9janTTZtHybfO4-l2KGQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1295d8bb945adb7206c6b666181012c33d81bd5b1ffdc51bd529f6e4a98dbae82cbe0f37ce657475119af3d6d4bc2b0adef7fc83b3670babd5368237c20953b21c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Q8G30YtKABitYnO86Qou8v8ZQPvw42bIlinKjYwU9fY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MiO1gU20wpAf-quTxgoGpbUC-aa3KRHmOUscsZrPTcY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"URK2IhrCWvU214l_Sfqvoh6Yu-nLzqQ8ZXrgmTqFJ2U\"}"
