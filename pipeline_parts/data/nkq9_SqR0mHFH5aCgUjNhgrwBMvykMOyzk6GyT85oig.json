First, the SHIB token's initial starting price was relatively low. Secondly, the extremely high FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) sentiment made investors jump on the opportunity being offered by SHIB. Thirdly, SHIB surged by so much in so little time based on billionaire Elon Musk's Dogecoin endorsement.\\n\\nAs the neck-to-neck battle between SHIB and Dogecoin continues, which meme cryptocurrency will emerge the victor remains to be seen.\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1636177383,\"title\":\"SHIBA INU Continues to be the Top Trending Topic in Crypto Amid an 889% Monthly Surge\"},\"digest\":\"gI5QwQvNiPNU7zO_K192p5vW-W-FN5Ji_3jmhekPOJM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x013e8157A719Ba984692f7aa3Da2ad615947E98E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ffXPh8wkKzaSrkHoWg8qMlWyPCxJjW-FQ7J8nwy1nss\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"auZYj7X2OBLBLTGTPj2yDOvMWzNi-X3VZR7AMfTc0ow\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"DqaNihL8jO2n2jpez3xYs08TJhuXfUIOfm-8NxqHSoB-K7mk7lm3aH6JgtmfUtVzkZsfXQ2Nl8s4VYG9kgCTDQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe96058e7dbe6c3e98cbd58d3261a3d9874abc79d50c6867eec077baa3174eda4090bc723b6fcd4c2d436787b4cd1d0b60c6d8b9af7063e42c8b612c64d6b8baf1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ffXPh8wkKzaSrkHoWg8qMlWyPCxJjW-FQ7J8nwy1nss\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"auZYj7X2OBLBLTGTPj2yDOvMWzNi-X3VZR7AMfTc0ow\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"gI5QwQvNiPNU7zO_K192p5vW-W-FN5Ji_3jmhekPOJM\"}"
