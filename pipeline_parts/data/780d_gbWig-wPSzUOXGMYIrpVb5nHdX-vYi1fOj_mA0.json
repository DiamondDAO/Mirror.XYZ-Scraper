"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"a neighbor. This aunt forced Peppina into sin. Her beauty, which must have been extraordinary, naturally attracted attention and turned people's heads. It seems to have driven one man nearly mad. He is a fisherman, not young, and a married man. It seems that he is notoriously violent and jealous, and thoroughly unscrupulous. He is a member of the Camorra, too. He pestered Peppina with his attentions, coming day after day from Mergellina, where he lives with his wife. One night he entered the house and made a scene. Peppina refused finally to receive his advances, and told him she hated him before all the neighbors. He took out a razor and--\\\"\\n\\nHermione stopped.\\n\\n\\\"I understand,\\\" said Artois. \\\"He disfigured her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dreadfully.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is often done here. Sometimes a youth does it simply to show that a girl is his property. But what is it you wish to do for Peppina? I see you have a plan in your head.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I want to have her on the island.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In what capacity?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As a servant. She can work. She is not a bad girl. She has only-- well, Emile, the aunt only succeeded in forcing one lover on her. That is the truth. He was rich and bribed the aunt. But of course the neighbors all know, and--the population here has its virtues, but it is not exactly a delicate population.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Per Bacco!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And now that the poor girl is disfigured the aunt is going to turn her out-of-doors. She says Peppina must go and earn money for herself. Of course nobody will take her. I want to. I have seen her, talked to her. She would be so thankful. She is in despair. Think of it! Nineteen, and all her beauty gone! Isn't it devilish?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And the man?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, they say he'll get scarcely anything, if anything. Two or three months, perhaps. He is 'protected.' It makes my blood boil.\\\"\\n\\nArtois was silent, waiting for her to say more, to ask questions.\\n\\n\\\"The only thing is--Vere, Emile,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Vere?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. You know how friendly she is with the servants. I like her to be. But of course till now they have been all right--so far as I know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You do well to add that proviso.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Peppina would not wait on us. She would be in the kitchen. Am I justified in taking her? Of course I could help her with money. If I had not seen her, talked to her, that is what I should have done, no doubt. But she wants--she wants everything, peace, a decent home, pure air. I feel she wants the island.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And the other servants?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They need only know she was attacked. They need not know her past history. But all that does not matter. It is only the question of Vere that troubles me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You mean that you are not decided whether you ought to bring into the house with Vere a girl who is not as Vere is?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you want me to advise you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can't do that, Hermione.\\\"\\n\\nShe looked at him almost as if she were startled.\\n\\n\\\"Why not? I always rely--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, no. This is not a man's business, my business.\\\"\\n\\nHe spoke with an odd brusqueness, and there were traces of agitation in his face. Hermione did not at all understand what feeling was prompting him, but again, as on the previous evening, she felt as if there were a barrier between them--very slight, perhaps, very shadowy, but definite nevertheless. There was no longer complete frankness in their relations. At moments her friend seemed to be subtly dominated by some secret irritation, or anxiety, which she did not comprehend. She had been aware of it yesterday. She was aware of it now. After his last exclamation she said nothing.\\n\\n\\\"You are going to this girl now?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\\"I mean to. Yes, I shall go.\\\"\\n\\nShe sat still for a minute, looking down at the pink-and-yellow carpet.\\n\\n\\\"And what will you do?\\\"\\n\\nShe looked up at him.\\n\\n\\\"I think I shall take her to the island. I am almost sure I shall. Emile, I don't believe in cowardice, and I sometimes think I am inclined to be a coward about Vere. She is growing up. She will be seventeen this year, very soon. There are girls who marry at sixteen, even English girls.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is true.\\\"\\n\\nShe could gather nothing from his tone; and now his face was perfectly calm.\\n\\n\\\"My instinct is to keep Vere just as she is, to preserve the loveliness of childhood in her as long as possible, to keep away from her all knowledge of sin, sorrow, the things that distract and torture the world. But I mustn't be selfish about Vere. I mustn't keep her wrapped in cotton wool. That is unwholesome. And, after all, Vere must have her life apart from me. Last night I realized that strongly.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Last night?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, from the way in which she treated the Marchese, and later from something else. Last night Vere showed two sides of a woman's nature-- the capacity to hold her own, what is vulgarly called 'to keep her distance,' and the capacity to be motherly.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Was Vere motherly to the Marchesino, then?\\\" asked Artois, not without irony.\\n\\n\\\"No--to Ruffo.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That boy? But where was he last night?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"When we got back to the island, and the launch had gone off, Vere and I stood for a minute at the foot of the steps to listen to the roaring of the sea. Vere loves the sea.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know that.\\\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he thought of something that Hermione did not know.\\n\\n\\\"The pool was protected, and under the lee of the island it was comparatively calm. But the rain was falling in torrents. There was one fishing-boat in the pool, close to where we were, and as we were standing and listening, Vere said, suddenly, 'Madre, that's Ruffo's boat!' I asked her how she knew--because he has changed into another boat lately--she had told me that. 'I saw his head,' she answered. 'He's there and he's not asleep. Poor boy, in all this rain!' Ruffo has been ill with fever, as I told you, and when Vere said that I remembered it at once.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Had you told Vere yet?\\\" interposed Artois.\\n\\n\\\"No. But I did then. Emile, she showed an agitation that--well, it was almost strange, I think. She begged me to make him come into the house and spend the night there, safe from the wind and the rain.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you did, of course?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. He was looking very pale and shaky. The men let him come. They were nice and sympathetic. I think they are fond of the boy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ruffo seems to know how to attract people to him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And so Vere played the mother to Ruffo?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. I never saw that side of her before. She was a woman then. Eventually Ruffo slept with Gaspare.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And how did Gaspare accept the situation?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Better than I should have expected. I think he likes Ruffo personally, though he is inclined to be suspicious and jealous of any strangers who come into our lives. But I haven't had time to talk to him this morning.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is Ruffo still in the house?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh no. He went off in the boat. They came for him about eight.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah!\\\"\\n\\nArtois went to the window and looked out. But now he saw nothing, although the three women were still talking and gesticulating on the terrace of the bath-house, more fishing-boats were being towed or rowed out into the Bay, carts were passing by, and people were strolling in the sun.\\n\\n\\\"You say that Vere showed agitation last night?\\\" he said, turning round after a moment.\\n\\n\\\"About Ruffo's illness? It really almost amounted to that. But Vere was certainly excited. Didn't you notice it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think she was.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Emile,\\\" Hermione said, after an instant of hesitation, \\\"you remember my saying to you the other day that Vere was not a stranger to me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, quite well.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You said nothing--I don't think you agreed. Well, since that day-- only since then--I have sometimes felt that there is much in Vere that I do not understand, much that is hidden from me. Has she changed lately?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She is at an age when development seems sudden, and is often striking, even startling.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know why, but--but I dread something,\\\" Hermione said. \\\"I feel as if--no, I don't know what I feel. But if Vere should ever drift away from me I don't know how I could bear it. A boy--one expects him to go out into the world. But a girl! I want to keep Vere. I must keep Vere. If anything else were to be taken from me I don't think I could bear it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Vere loves you. Be sure of that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\nHermione got up.\\n\\n\\\"Well, you won't give me your advice?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, Hermione.\\\"\\n\\nHe looked at her steadily.\\n\\n\\\"You must treat Vere as you think best, order her life as you think right. In some things you do wisely to consult me. But in this you must rely on yourself. Let your heart teach you. Do not ask questions of my head.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your head!\\\" she exclaimed.\\n\\nThere was a trace of disappointment, even of surprise, in her voice. She looked at him as if she were going to say more, but again she was disconcerted by something in his look, his attitude.\\n\\n\\\"Well, good-bye, Emile.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will come with you to the lift.\\\"\\n\\nHe went with her and touched the electric bell. As they waited for a moment he added:\\n\\n\\\"I should like to have an evening quietly on the island.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come to-night, or whenever you like. Don't fix a time. Come when the inclination whispers--'I want to be with friends.' \\\"\\n\\nHe pressed her hand.\\n\\n\\\"Shall I see Peppina?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Chi lo sa?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And Ruffo?\\\"\\n\\nShe laughed.\\n\\n\\\"The Marchesino, too, perhaps.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said Artois, emphatically. \\\"Disfigured girls and fisher-boys--as many as you like, but not the alta aristocrazia Napoletana.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I thought--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I like Doro, but--I like him in his place.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And his place?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is not the island--when I wish to be quiet there.\\\"\\n\\nThe lift descended. Artois went out once more onto the balcony, and watched her get into the carriage and drive away towards Naples. She did not look up again.\\n\\n\\\"She has gone to fetch that girl Peppina,\\\" Artois said to himself, \\\"and I might have prevented it.\\\"\\n\\nHe knew very well the reason why he had not interfered. He had not interfered because he had wished too much to interfere. The desire had been strong enough to startle him, to warn him.\\n\\nAn islet! That suggests isolation. Like Hermione, he wished to isolate Vere, to preserve her as she was in character. He did not know when the wish had first been consciously in his mind, but he knew that since he had been consulted by Vere, since she had broken through her reserve and submitted to him her poems, unveiling for him alone what was really to her a holy of holies, the wish had enormously increased. He told himself that Vere was unique, and that he longed to keep her unique, so that the talent he discerned in her might remain unaffected. How great her talent was he did not know. He would not know, perhaps, for a very long time. But it was definite, it was intimate. It was Vere's talent, no one else's.\\n\\nHe had made up his mind very soon about Hermione's incapacity to produce work of value. Although Vere was such a child, so inexperienced, so innocent, so cloistered, he knew at once that he dared not dash her hopes. It was possible that she might eventually become what her mother certainly could never be.\\n\\nBut she must not be interfered with. Her connection with the sea must not be severed. And people were coming into her life--Ruffo, the Marchesino, and now this wounded girl Peppina.\\n\\nArtois felt uneasy. He wished Hermione were less generous-hearted, less impulsive. She looked on him as a guide, a check. He knew that. But this time he would not exercise his prerogative. Ruffo he did not mind--at least he thought he did not. The boy was a sea creature. He might even be an inspiring force to Vere. Something Artois had read had taught him that. And Ruffo interested him, attracted him too.\\n\\nBut he hated Vere's acquaintance with the Marchesino. He knew that the Marchesino would make love to her. And the knowledge was odious to him. Let Vere be loved by the sea, but by no man as yet.\\n\\nAnd this girl, Peppina?\\n\\nHe thought of the horrors of Naples, of the things that happen \\\"behind the shutter,\\\" of the lives led by some men and women, some boys and girls of the great city beneath the watching volcano. He thought of evenings he had spent in the Galleria. He saw before him an old woman about whom he had often wondered. Always at night, and often in the afternoon, she walked in the Galleria. She was invariably alone. The first time he had seen her he had noticed her because she had a slightly humped back. Her hair was snow white, and was drawn away from her long, pale face and carefully arranged under a modest bonnet. She carried a small umbrella and a tiny bag. Glancing at her casually, he had supposed her to be a respectable widow of the borghese class. But then he had seen her again and again, and by degrees he had come to believe that she was something very different. And then one night in late spring he had seen her in a new light dress with white thread gloves. And she had noticed him watching her, and had cast upon him a look that was unmistakable, a look from the world \\\"behind the shutter\\\"; and he had understood. Then she had followed him persistently. When he sat before the \\\"Gran caffe\\\" sipping his coffee and listening to the orchestra of women that plays on the platform outside the caffe, she had passed and repassed, always casting upon him that glance of sinister understanding, of invitation, of dreary wickedness that sought for, and believed that it had found, an answering wickedness in him.\\n\\nTerrible old woman! Peppina's aunt might well be like that. And Peppina would sleep, perhaps to-night, in the Casa del Mare, under the same roof as Vere.\\n\\nHe resolved to go that evening to the island, to see Peppina, to see Vere. He wished, too, to have a little talk with Gaspare about Ruffo.\\n\\nThe watch-dog instinct, which dwelt also in Gaspare, was alive in him.\\n\\nBut to-day it was alive to do service for Vere, not for Hermione. He knew that, and said to himself that it was natural. For Hermione was a woman, with experience of life; but Vere was only upon the threshold of the world. She needed protection more than Hermione.\\n\\nSome time ago, when he was returning to Naples from the island on an evening of scirocco, Artois had in thought transferred certain hopes of his from Hermione to Vere. He had said to himself that he must henceforth hope for Hermione in Vere.\\n\\nNow was he not transferring something else from the mother to the child?\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\nArtois had intended to go that evening to the island. But he did not fulfil his intention. When the sun began to sink he threw a light coat over his arm and walked down to the harbor of Santa Lucia. A boatman whom he knew met him and said:\\n\\n\\\"Shall I take you to the island, Signore?\\\"\\n\\nArtois was there to take a boat. He meant to say yes. Yet when the man spoke he answered no. The fellow turned away and found another customer. Two or three minutes later Artois saw his boat drawing out to sea in the direction of Posilipo. It was a still evening, and very clear after the storm of the preceding night. Artois longed to be in that travelling boat, longed to see the night come from the summit of the island with Hermione and Vere. But he resisted the sea, its wide peace, its subtle summons, called a carriage and drove to the Galleria. Arrived there, he took his seat at a little table outside the \\\"Gran Caffe,\\\" ordered a small dinner, and, while he was eating it, watched the people strolling up and down, seeking among them for a figure that he knew.\\n\\nAs the hour drew near for the music to begin, and the girls dressed in white came out one by one to the platform that, surrounded by a white railing edged with red velvet, is built out beyond the caffe to face the crowd, the number of promenaders increased, and many stood still waiting for the first note, and debating the looks of the players. Others thronged around Artois, taking possession of the many little tables, and calling for ices, lemon-water, syrups, and liqueurs. Priests, soldiers, sailors, students, actors--who assemble in the Galleria to seek engagements--newsboys, and youths whose faces suggested that they were \\\"ruffiani,\\\" mingled with foreigners who had come from the hotels and from the ships in the harbor, and whose demeanor was partly curious and partly suspicious, as of one who longs to probe the psychology of a thief while safely guarding his pockets. The buzz of voices, the tramp of feet, gained a peculiar and vivid sonorousness from the high and vaulted roof; and in the warm air, under the large and winking electric lights, the perpetually moving figures looked strangely capricious, hungry, determined, furtive, ardent, and intent. On their little stands the electric fans whirred as they slowly revolved, casting an artificial breeze upon pallid faces, and around the central dome the angels with gilded wings lifted their right arms as if pointing the unconscious multitude the difficult way to heaven.\\n\\nA priest sat down with two companions at the table next to Artois. He had a red cord round his shaggy black hat. His face was like a parroquet's, with small, beady eyes full of an unintellectual sharpness. His plump body suggested this world, and his whole demeanor, the movements of his dimpled, dirty hands, and of his protruding lips, the attitude of his extended legs, the pose of his coarse shoulders, seemed hostile to things mystical. He munched an ice, and swallowed hasty draughts of iced water, talking the while with a sort of gluttonous vivacity. Artois looked at him and heard, with his imagination, the sound of the bell at the Elevation, and saw the bowed heads of the crouching worshippers. The irony of life, that is the deepest mystery of life, came upon him like the wave of some Polar sea. He looked up at the gilded angels, then dropped his eyes and saw what he had come to see.\\n\\nSlowly threading her way through the increasing throng, came the old woman whom he had watched so often and by whom he had been watched. To-night she had on her summer dress, a respectable, rather shiny gown of grayish mauve, a bonnet edged with white ribbon, a pair of white thread gloves. She carried her little bag and a small Japanese fan. Walking in a strange, flat-footed way that was peculiar to her, and glancing narrowly about her, yet keeping her hand almost still, she advanced towards the band-stand. As she came opposite to Artois the orchestra of women struck up the \\\"Valse Noir,\\\" and the old woman stood still, impeded by the now dense crowd of listeners. While the demurely sinister music ran its course, she remained absolutely immobile. Artois watched her with a keen interest.\\n\\nIt had come into his mind that she was the aunt of Peppina, the disfigured girl, who perhaps to-night was sleeping in the Casa del Mare with Vere.\\n\\nPresently, attracted, no doubt, by his gaze, the old woman looked across at Artois and met his eyes. Instantly a sour and malignant expression came into her long, pale face, and she drew up a corner of her upper lip, as a dog sometimes does, showing a tooth that was like a menace.\\n\\nShe was secretly cursing Artois.\",\"timestamp\":1637314052,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"She is greedy, wicked, merciless.
