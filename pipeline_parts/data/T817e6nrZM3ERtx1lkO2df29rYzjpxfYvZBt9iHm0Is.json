"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### RECAP üçÉ ONBOARDING & BATCHES\\nOur goal at [Mint Fund](https://themint.fund/) is to empower creatives. Largely, that has been through the thoughtful practice of onboarding global creatives to mint their first NFTs.\\n\\nWe've onboarded artists from 18 countries including the Philippines, Indonesia, Mexico, Venezuela, South Africa, Nigeria, Malaysia, and more. Selected artists complete onboarding and attend a series of workshops to then receive a grant. To date, Mint Fund has received ~42 ETH from ~74 contributors, and we have distributed ~12 ETH in total to artists. With gratitude to all who have contributed to the fund, 44 NFTs have been successfully minted by artists representing a diverse range of perspectives, practices, locations, and identities.  \\n\\nSome of the incredibly talented artists to join Mint Fund include: 3D artist [Rimbawan Gerilya](https://zora.co/rimbawangerilya), multimedia artist [Moyosore Briggs](https://foundation.app/@TheCount), photographer [Ashmit Galav](https://foundation.app/@nft/nft-30176), designer [Ravi Vasavan](https://foundation.app/@ravi), musician [Eddington Again](https://zora.co/0xd1CcB4472872c2488856226EC47B890c167ae2F7/1790), performance artist [Niall Ashley](https://foundation.app/@niall), 3D artist [The Glad Scientist](https://foundation.app/@thegladscientist/wool-wobble-40984), designer [Gian Ferrer](https://zora.co/0x2bD5d2e3d5852AD9960638083cb7c9F493E7A597/3003), illustrator [O‚ÄôPlerou](https://zora.co/oplerou), animator [Tigris Li](https://foundation.app/@tigris), concept artist [Tondji](https://foundation.app/@Tondji), and so many more.  \\n\\nBehind-the-scenes, our core team continues to review applications based on curation criteria prioritizing BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ creators. With care and intention, we onboard batches, host workshops, and work closely with each artist throughout the minting process. Since we onboarded [Batch 01](https://twitter.com/themintfund/status/1389900035412746242) of 35 artists in late-February, we‚Äôve reworked our process and took new learnings with us through to our latest Batch 04. \\n\\nWe also want to take a moment to thank all of the contributors who have volunteered to host educational workshops with us including [Cooper Turley](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa), [Osinachi](https://twitter.com/osinachiart), [Paris Rouzati](https://twitter.com/parisrouz), [Gabrielle Micheletti](https://twitter.com/parisrouz), [Shawna X](https://twitter.com/shawnax), [Sven Eberwein](https://twitter.com/sven_eberwein), and [Bria Thomas](https://twitter.com/TheNamesBria_).   \\n     \\n### INITIATIVES üçÉ SOTHEBY‚ÄôS & THE DIGITAL DIASPORA\\n\\nAs our work to support a global network of artists progresses, we‚Äôve garnered interest from organizations to further our mission. In May, Sotheby‚Äôs auction house organized [*Natively Digital: A Curated NFT Sale.*](https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2021/natively-digital-a-curated-nft-sale-2) As part of the lot, a percentage of the artwork sales will be donated to Mint Fund. We also had the opportunity to work with Michael Bouhanna, Deputy Director at Sotheby‚Äôs, and Ben Gentilli, founder of the Robert Alice Project, to identify an alumni of Mint Fund‚Äôs artist roster to participate in the auction. Brazilian artist, [Ikaro Cavalcante](https://twitter.com/occult3d) (occulted), created a new work for the show‚Äî*[Perennial Links](https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2021/natively-digital-a-curated-nft-sale-2/perennial-links)*. Inclusion of work by an artist from Mint Fund gave us an important signal and glimpse into the future we are aiming to build, one where artists are able to achieve unimaginable heights by having access to minting NFTs alone. \\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/occult3d/status/1403227316432654336     \\n\\nAlong with our schedule of onboarding new creators through batches, Mint Fund was presented with the opportunity to provide support for *[The Digital Diaspora](https://foundation.app/digital-diaspora)*. Curator [Diana Sinclair](https://twitter.com/dianaesinclair) of [Towards Utopia](https://www.towardsutopia.life/) organized an exhibition of NFTs from 18 artists across the African diaspora to be released on Juneteenth. A portion of funds raised through the NFT auctions were [donated to G.L.I.T.S. and herstoryDAO](https://twitter.com/towards_utopia/status/1414704795148070912). Similar to the Sotheby‚Äôs project, Diana selected South African photographer [Ayesha Kazim](https://foundation.app/@ayeshachasm/rebirth-47730) to represent Mint Fund in the dual exhibition and auction fundraiser.                           \\n\\n### FUTURE üçÉ\\n\\n*The Digital Diaspora* marked two inflection points for Mint Fund‚Äôs future: providing support for large-scale community-organized efforts, and collecting and preserving NFTs. \\n\\nIn the rapidly shifting and emergent space of NFTs, we are also evolving to further our mission of supporting and uplifting underrepresented creatives. We are proud to fund and support initiatives like *The Digital Diaspora* and look forward to utilizing the treasury for like-minded projects in the future. By participating in auctions and collecting *[Double Vision](https://foundation.app/@blacksneakers/double-vision-47755)* by [BLACKSNEAKERS](https://twitter.com/BLACKKSNEAKERS), we want to permanently record this moment in time and double down on our support for creators and initiatives that are pushing culture forward.  \\n\\nWe will continue to onboard batches, but are now opening up applications for group shows and larger-initiatives to have access to Mint Fund‚Äôs treasury.
