"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Research topic: ***Am I just a line of code?***\\n\\n“I had the consistent urge for a reality check each time I encounter uncertainty in life, later on, I developed a feeling of disconnection with the world‘s rapid changes, where I feel nothing actually has been fundamentally changed, it is more like a moving pattern within a frame, or like a ripple on the surface of a pond. “\\n\\n*Chapter 0. Time: 11.30.2021*\\n\\nI had brainstormed with Summer just like we used to do every time we met, she shared her discovery in Bible and language.\\n\\nStarting from “Word” inspiration in [John1:1 NIV](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/JHN.1.1.NIV):\\n\\n“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\\n\\nHe was with God in the beginning.\\n\\nThrough him all things were made; without him, nothing was made that has been made.\\n\\nIn him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind.”\\n\\n\\\\*In Chinese, the Word is translated as Dao, meaning “way,” “road,” “path,” “course,” “speech,” or “method” also a Chinese philosophy called Dao, Confucius can be said to be “**Truth**”. The first sentence in Chinese is 太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神. Dao is God.\\n\\nDoes it imply that the language was generated by itself? Or anything beyond human beings’ imagination?\\n\\nIt reminded me of [Tower of ](https://blog.logos.com/really-happened-tower-babel/)**[Babel](https://blog.logos.com/really-happened-tower-babel/)**, (מִגְדַּל בָּבֶל‎，Migdal Bāḇēl), in [Genesis 11:1–9](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%2011.1%E2%80%939?webSyncID=7297b324-8dce-036a-a50d-c026055eb505&sessionGUID=9a095e90-0535-6bba-314e-2c87136a2c9c):\\n\\nAt first, the whole earth had **one language** and the same **words**. And as people migrated from the east they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. And they started to work and build the city together, then Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower that humankind was building. Then he decided to scatter people in different languages so they won’t understand each other.\\n\\nFor this part of the story, language is a curse to people, mainly to divide them into groups with different ways of thinking, with different ideologies.\\n\\nIf we see religion in different societies, we can find the pattern of history and culture inside, the religion is the mirror and archive of the social movement and evolution. Religion rides on language into wider publication and attracts more followers.\\n\\nLanguage serves as the foundation in the genesis period of humankind, in general, communication consists of **words,** which are organized in a conventional way, which could be expressed through writing, speaking, and gesture. It is also very identical in each group, community, and nation. I found the fascinating part of language is when I try to fully understand it, I have to embrace the entire entity that a language carries, combining with culture, history, an essential spirit that is deeply rooted inside of it, that is what glues the individual in the community tightly. The language could be regarded as the spirit of a community, the blood of a body, the roots of a tree.\\n\\nMany see and use language just as a tool, it is undervalued in many cultures than a science major. Language itself has such a permeability, human breath and sleeps with it, without it, we probably will be soulless numb creatures, although most of the creatures have their own way of communicating and expressing. Also, language is like water, the sentence construction is like a spontaneous art performance, in a discussion or a speech, we would feel the words come into our brain and construct in a certain way and produced fluently from our speaking system.\\n\\nAccording to Wikipedia, it describes the communicator simply encode and decode the message during the process of communication: “In communications and information processing, code is **a system of rules to convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret**, for communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium.”\\n\\n*System of rules*, which refers to the underlying code. Does it sound familiar?\\n\\nLanguage basically serves as a system of rules in its nature, Ludwig Wittgenstein once stated “The limits of my language mean the **limits** of my world.” - The words of this language are referred to what only the speaker can know — **to his immediate private sensations.**  The language here, therefore, marked one’s frontier of knowledge and defined the border of one’s known and unknown. It is the **system of rule**, it is the **law**.\\n\\nLanguage is a rule, what if we don‘t want the conventional rule? We break the old one and reconstruct a new one. We build a new system, a new border, a new law.\\n\\nSo in this context, the word represents the rule, language represents the system of rule, then code…is law?\\n\\nReference:\\n\\n[https://journals.openedition.org/factsreports/4518](https://journals.openedition.org/factsreports/4518)\\n\\n[https://newn.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Mary-Osborne-3.pdf](https://newn.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Mary-Osborne-3.pdf)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638284372,\"title\":\"For us in many years\"},\"digest\":\"dz-xFJFiEsNMX5tHBCd3dsNM2_aK6-n-pXbKaY0oVl0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xb12e31D8F7DdA2Dd3733c25cB3B01F6924cd3497\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Lr5PDIM-7CYqjKY0FyUbQOdVAKZQxW4dWUFVQIH1V0E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MvcF9owt1yEKt107pZTz6dsxILIe3Lvjfh3Ydj7quqk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"S_amY8ImzdKyrlTJ9dV536Q14eNAlOMK41nmK9ChP3LM2z2qi-_JSdCrXWxMbFCBBAEi764fPm9C91hFVyd6Mg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x24935a61236472302068f0d7667525159380a54a71ce668a6c9841c372f9b4fc0a8b2384113da3d62cc57a62c2f23825765253cf48c700cc992e0d4024e392961c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Lr5PDIM-7CYqjKY0FyUbQOdVAKZQxW4dWUFVQIH1V0E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MvcF9owt1yEKt107pZTz6dsxILIe3Lvjfh3Ydj7quqk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"AVmw0g7OyPjkm8OIFrl7Ps631apCE35MIraeiE5rMxg\"}"
