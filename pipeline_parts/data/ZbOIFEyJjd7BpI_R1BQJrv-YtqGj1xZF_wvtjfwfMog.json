"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"His eyes looked excited, surely, as if something unusual had been happening. And they were fixed upon her face with a scrutiny that was strange, almost as if he saw her now for the first time.\\n\\n\\\"What is it, Gaspare? Why do you look at me like that?\\\"\\n\\nGaspare turned his eyes away.\\n\\n\\\"Like what, Signorina? Why should I not look at you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What have you been doing at Mergellina?\\\"\\n\\nShe spoke rather imperiously.\\n\\n\\\"Nothing particular, Signorina.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\"\\n\\nShe paused, but he did not speak.\\n\\n\\\"Where did you see Ruffo?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"At the harbor, Signorina.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tell me, Gaspare, do you like him?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ruffo?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do not dislike him, Signorina. He has never done me any harm.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course not. Why should he?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I say--he has not.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I like Ruffo.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lo so.\\\"\\n\\nAgain he looked at her with that curious expression in his eyes. Then he said:\\n\\n\\\"Come, Signorina! It is getting late. We must go to the island.\\\"\\n\\nAnd they pulled out round the point to the open sea.\\n\\nDuring the hot weather the dwellers in the Casa del Mare made the siesta after the mid-day meal. The awnings and blinds were drawn. Silence reigned, and the house was still as the Palace of the Sleeping Beauty. At the foot of the cliffs the sea slept in the sunshine, and it was almost an empty sea, for few boats passed by in those hot, still hours.\\n\\nTo-day the servants were quiet in their quarters. Only Gaspare was outside. And he, in shirt and trousers, with a white linen hat covering his brown face, was stretched under the dwarf trees of the little garden, in the shadow of the wall, resting profoundly after the labors of the morning. In their respective rooms Hermione and Vere were secluded behind shut doors. Hermione was lying down, but not sleeping. Vere was not lying down. Generally she slept at this time for an hour. But to-day, perhaps because of her nap in the cave, she had no desire for sleep.\\n\\nShe was thinking about her mother. And Hermione was thinking of her. Each mind was working in the midst of its desert space, its solitude eternal.\\n\\nWhat was growing up between them, and why was it growing?\\n\\nHermione was beset by a strange sensation of impotence. She felt as if her child were drifting from her. Was it her fault, or was it no one's, and inevitable? Had Vere been able to divine certain feelings in her, the mother, obscure pains of the soul that had travelled to mind and heart? She did not think it possible. Nor had it been possible for her to kill those pains, although she had made her effort --to conceal them. Long ago, before she was married to Maurice, Emile had spoken to them of jealousy. At the time she had not understood it. She remembered thinking, even saying, that she could not be jealous.\\n\\nBut then she had not had a child.\\n\\nLately she had realized that there were forces in her of which she had not been aware. She had realized her passion for her child. Was it strange that she had not always known how deep and strong it was? Her mutilated life was more vehemently centred upon Vere than she had understood. Of Vere she could be jealous. If Vere put any one before her, trusted any one more than her, confided anything to another rather than to her, she could be frightfully jealous.\\n\\nRecently she had suspected--she had imagined--\\n\\nRestlessly she moved on her bed. A mosquito-curtain protected it. She was glad of that, as if it kept out prying eyes. For sometimes she was ashamed of the vehemence within her.\\n\\nShe thought of her friend Emile, whom she had dragged back from death.\\n\\nHe, too, had he not drifted a little from her in these last days? It seemed to her that it was so. She knew that it was so. Women are so sure of certain things, more almost than men are ever sure of anything. And why should Vere have drifted, Emile have drifted, if there were not some link between them--some link between the child and the middle-aged man which they would not have her know of?\\n\\nVere had told to Emile something that she had kept, that she still kept from her mother. When Vere had been shut up in her room she had not been reading. Emile knew what it was that she did during those long hours when she was alone. Emile knew that, and perhaps other things of Vere that she, Hermione, did not know, was not allowed to know.\\n\\nHermione, in their long intimacy, had learned to read Artois more clearly, more certainly than he realized. Although often impulsive, and seemingly unconscious of the thoughts of others, she could be both sharply observant and subtle, especially with those she loved. She had noticed the difference between his manner when first they spoke of Vere's hidden occupation and his manner when last they spoke of it. In the interval he had found out what it was, and that it was not reading. Of that she was positive. She was positive also that he did not wish her to suspect this. Vere must have told him what it was.\\n\\nIt was characteristic of Hermione that at this moment she was free from any common curiosity as to what it was that Vere did during those many hours when she was shut up in her room. The thing that hurt her, that seemed to humiliate her, was the Emile should know what it was and not she, that Vere should have told Emile and not told her.\\n\\nAs she lay there she cowered under the blow a mutual silence can give, and something woke up in her, something fiery, something surely that could act with violence. It startled her, almost as a stranger rushing into her room would have startled her.\\n\\nFor a moment she thought of her child and her loved friend with a bitterness that was cruel.\\n\\nHow long had they shared their secret? She wondered, and began to consider the recent days, searching their hours for those tiny incidents, those small reticences, avoidances, that to women are revelations. When had she first noticed a slight change in Emile's manner to her? When had Vere and he first seemed a little more intimate, a little more confidential than before? When had she, Hermione, first felt a little \\\"out of it,\\\" not perfectly at ease with these two dear denizens of her life?\\n\\nHer mind fastened at once upon the day of the storm. On the night of the storm, when she and Emile had been left alone in the restaurant, she had felt almost afraid of him. But before then, in the afternoon on the island, there had been something. They had not been always at ease. She had been conscious of trying to tide over moments that were almost awkward--once or twice, only once or twice. But that was the day. Her woman's instinct told her so. That was the day on which Vere had told Emile the secret she had kept from her mother. How excited Vere had been, almost feverishly excited! And Emile had been very strange. When the Marchesino and Vere went out upon the terrace, how restless, how irritable he--\\n\\nSuddenly Hermione sat up in her bed. The heat, the stillness, the white cage of the mosquito net, the silence had become intolerable to her. She pulled aside the net. Yes, that was better. She felt more free. She would lie down outside the net. But the pillow was hot. She turned it, but its pressure against her cheek almost maddened her, and she got up, went across the room to the wash-stand and bathed her face with cold water. Then she put some /eau de Cologne/ on her forehead, opened a drawer and drew out a fan, went over to an arm-chair near the window and sat down in it.\\n\\nWhat had Emile written in the visitors' book at the Scoglio di Frisio? With a strange abruptness, with a flight that was instinctive as that of a homing pigeon, Hermione's mind went to that book as to a book of revelation. Just before he wrote he had been feeling acutely-- something. She had been aware of that at the time. He had not wanted to write. And then suddenly, almost violently, he had written and had closed the book.\\n\\nShe longed to open that book now, at once, to read what he had written. She felt as if it would tell her very much. There was no reason why she should not read it. The book was one that all might see, was kept to be looked over by any chance visitor. She would go one day, one evening, to the restaurant and see what Emile had written. He would not mind. If she had asked him that night of course he would have shown her the words. But she had not asked him. She had been almost afraid of things that night. She remembered how the wind had blown up the white table-cloth, her cold, momentary shiver of fear, her relief when she had seen Gaspare walking sturdily into the room.\\n\\nAnd now, at once, this thought of Gaspare brought to her a sense of relief again, of relief so great, so sharp--piercing down into the very deep of her nature--that by it she was able to measure something, her inward desolation at this moment. Yes, she clung to Gaspare, because he was loyal, because he loved her, because he had loved Maurice--but also because she was terribly alone.\\n\\nBecause he had loved Maurice! Had there been a time, really a time, when she had possessed one who belonged utterly to her, who lived only in and for her? Was that possible? To-day, with the fierceness of one starving, she fastened upon this memory, her memory, hers only, shared by no one, never shared by living or dead. That at least she had, and that could never be taken from her. Even if Vere, her child, slipped from her, if Emile, her friend, whose life she had saved, slipped from her, the memory of her Sicilian was forever hers, the memory of his love, his joy in their mutual life, his last kiss. Long ago she had taken that kiss as a gift made to two--to her and to Vere unborn. To-day, almost savagely, she took it to herself, alone, herself-- alone. Hers it was, hers only, no part of it Vere's.\\n\\nThat she had--her memory, and Gaspare's loyal, open-hearted devotion. He knew what she had suffered. He loved her as he had loved his dead Padrone. He would always protect her, put her first without hesitation, conceal nothing from her that it was her right--for surely even the humblest, the least selfish, the least grasping, surely all who love have their rights--that it was her right to know.\\n\\nHer cheeks were burning. She felt like one who had been making some physical exertion.\\n\\nDeeply silent was the house. Her room was full of shadows, yet full of the hidden presence of the sun. There was a glory outside, against which she was protected. But outside, and against assaults that were inglorious, what protection had she? Her own personality must protect her, her own will, the determination, the strength, the courage that belong to all who are worth anything in the world. And she called upon herself. And it seemed to her that there was no voice that answered.\\n\\nThere was a hideous moment of drama.\\n\\nShe sat there quietly in her chair in the pretty room. And she called again, and she listened--and again there was silence.\\n\\nThen she was afraid. She had a strange and horrible feeling that she was deserted by herself, by that which, at least, had been herself and on which she had been accustomed to rely. And what was left was surely utterly incapable, full of the flabby wickedness that seems to dwell in weakness. It seemed to her that if any one who knew her well, if Vere, Emile, or even Gaspare, had come into the room just then, the intruder would have paused on the threshold amazed to see a stranger there. She felt afraid to be seen and yet afraid to remain alone. Should she do something definite, something defiant, to prove to herself that she had will and could exercise it?\\n\\nShe got up, resolved to go to Vere. When she was there, with her child, she did not know what she was going to do. She had said to Vere, \\\"Keep your secrets.\\\" What if she went now and humbled herself, explained to the child quite simply and frankly a mother's jealousy, a widow's loneliness, made her realize what she was in a life from which the greatest thing had been ruthlessly withdrawn? Vere would understand surely, and all would be well. This shadow between them would pass away. Hermione had her hand on the door. But she did not open it. An imperious reserve, autocrat, tyrant, rose up suddenly within her. She could never make such a confession to Vere. She could never plead for her child's confidence--a confidence already given to Emile, to a man. And now for the first time the common curiosity to which she had not yet fallen a victim came upon her, flooded her. What was Vere's secret? That it was innocent, probably even childish, Hermione did not question even for a moment. But what was it?\\n\\nShe heard a light step outside and drew back from the door. The step passed on and died away down the paved staircase. Vere had gone out to the terrace, the garden, or the sea.\\n\\nHermione again moved forward, then stopped abruptly. Her face was suddenly flooded with red as she realized what she had been going to do, she who had exclaimed that every one has a right to their freedom.\\n\\nFor an instant she had meant to go to Vere's room, to try to find out surreptitiously what Emile knew.\\n\\nA moment later Vere, coming back swiftly for a pencil she had forgotten, heard the sharp grating of a key in the lock of her mother's door.\\n\\nShe ran on lightly, wondering why her mother was locking herself in, and against whom.\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\nDuring the last days Artois had not been to the island, nor had he seen the Marchesino. A sudden passion for work had seized him. Since the night of Vere's meeting with Peppina his brain had been in flood with thoughts. Life often acts subtly upon the creative artist, repressing or encouraging his instinct to bring forth, depressing or exciting him when, perhaps, he expects it least. The passing incidents of life frequently have their hidden, their unsuspected part in determining his activities. So it was now with Artois. He had given an impetus to Vere. That was natural, to be expected, considering his knowledge and his fame, his great experience and his understanding of men. But now Vere had given an impetus to him--and that was surely stranger. Since the conversation among the shadows of the cave, after the vision of the moving men of darkness and of fire, since the sound of Peppina sobbing in the night, and the sight of her passionate face lifted to show its gashed cross to Vere, Artois' brain and head had been alive with a fury of energy that forcibly summoned him to work, that held him working. He even felt within him something that was like a renewal of some part of his vanished youth, and remembered old days of student life, nights in the Quartier Latin, his debut as a writer for the papers, the sensation of joy with which he saw his first article in the /Figaro/, his dreams of fame, his hopes of love, his baptism of sentiment. How he had worked in those days and nights! How he had hunted experience in the streets and the by-ways of the great city! How passionate and yet how ruthless he had been, as artists often are, governed not only by their quick emotions, but also by the something watchful and dogged underneath, that will not be swept away, that is like a detective hidden by a house door to spy out all the comers in the night. Something, some breath from the former days, swept over him again. In his ears there sounded surely the cries of Paris, urging him to the assault to the barricades of Fame. And he sat down, and he worked with the vehement energy, with the pulsating eagerness of one of \\\"les jeunes.\\\" Hour after hour he worked. He took coffee, and wrote through the night. He slept when the dawn came, got up, and toiled again.\\n\\nHe shut out the real world and he forgot it--until the fit was past. And then he pushed away his paper, he laid down his pen, he stretched himself, and he knew that his great effort had tired him tremendously --tremendously.\\n\\nHe looked at his right hand. It was cramped. As he held it up he saw that it was shaking. He had drunk a great deal of black coffee during those days, had drunk it recklessly as in the days of youth, when he cared nothing about health because he felt made of iron.\\n\\n\\\"Pf-f-f!\\\"\\n\\nAnd so there was Naples outside, the waters of the Bay dancing in the sunshine of the bright summer afternoon, people bathing and shouting to one another from the diving platforms and the cabins; people galloping by in the little carriages to eat oysters at Posilipo. Lazy, heedless, pleasure-loving wretches! He thought of Doro as he looked at them.\\n\\nHe had given strict orders that he was not to be disturbed while he was at work, unless Hermione came. And he had not once been disturbed. Now he rang the bell. An Italian waiter, with crooked eyes and a fair beard, stepped softly in.\\n\\n\\\"Has any one been to see me? Has any one asked for me lately?\\\" he said. \\\"Just go down, will you, and inquire of the concierge.\\\"\\n\\nThe waiter departed, and returned to say that no one had been for the Signore.\\n\\n\\\"Not the Marchese Isidoro Panacci?\\n\\n\\\"The concierge says that no one has been, Signore.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Va bene.\\\"\\n\\nThe man went out.\\n\\nSo Doro had not come even once! Perhaps he was seriously offended. At their last parting in the Villa he had shown a certain irony that had in it a hint of bitterness. Artois did not know of the fisherman's information, that Doro had guessed who was Vere's companion that night upon the sea. He supposed that his friend was angry because he believed himself distrusted. Well, that could soon be put right. He thought of the Marchesino now with lightness, as the worker who has just made a great and prolonged effort is inclined to think of the habitual idler. Doro was like a feather on the warm wind of the South. He, Artois, was not in the mood just then to bother about a feather. Still less was he inclined for companionship. He wanted some hours of complete rest out in the air, with gay and frivolous scenes before his eyes.\\n\\nHe wanted to look on, but not to join in, the merry life that was about him, and that for so long a time he had almost violently ignored.\\n\\nHe resolved to take a carriage, drive slowly to Posilipo, and eat his dinner there in some eyrie above the sea; watching the pageant that unfolds itself on the evenings of summer about the ristoranti and the osterie, round the stalls of the vendors of Fruitti di Mare, and the piano-organs, to the accompaniment of which impudent men sing love songs to the saucy, dark-eyed beauties posed upon balconies, or gathered in knots upon the little terraces that dominate the bathing establishments, and the distant traffic of the Bay. His brain longed for rest, but it longed also for the hum and the stir of men. His heart lusted for the sight of pleasure, and must be appeased.\\n\\nCatching up his hat, almost with the hasty eagerness of a boy, he went down-stairs. On the opposite side of the road was a smart little carriage in which the coachman was asleep, with his legs cocked up on the driver's seat, displaying a pair of startling orange-and-black socks. By the socks Artois knew his man.\\n\\n\\\"Pasqualino! Pasqualino!\\\" he cried.\\n\\nThe coachman sprang up, showing a round, rosy face, and a pair of shrewd, rather small dark eyes.\\n\\n\\\"Take me to Posilipo.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signore.\\\"\\n\\nPasqualino cracked his whip vigorously.\\n\\n\\\"Ah--ah! Ah--ah!\\\" he cried to his gayly bedizened little horse, who wore a long feather on his head, flanked by bunches of artificial roses.\\n\\n\\\"Not too fast, Pasqualino. I am in no hurry. Keep along by the sea.\\\"\\n\\nThe coachman let the reins go loose, and instantly the little horse went slowly, as if all his spirit and agility had suddenly been withdrawn from him.\\n\\n\\\"I have not seen you for several days, Signore. Have you been ill?\\\"\\n\\nPasqualino had turned quite round on his box, and was facing his client.\\n\\n\\\"No, I've been working.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si?\\\"\\n\\nPasqualino made a grimace, as he nearly always did when he heard a rich Signore speak of working.\\n\\n\\\"And you? You have been spending money as usual. All your clothes are new.\\\"\\n\\nPasqualino smiled, showing rows of splendid teeth under his little twisted-up mustache.\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signore, all! And I have also new underclothing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Per Bacco!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ecco, Signore!\\\"\\n\\nHe pulled his trousers up to his knees, showing a pair of pale-blue drawers.\\n\\n\\\"The suspenders--they are new, Signore!\\\" He drew attention to the scarlet elastics that kept the orange-and-black socks in place. \\\"My boots!\\\" He put his feet up on the box that Artois might see his lemon- colored boots, then unbuttoned and threw open his waistcoat. \\\"My shirt is new! My cravat is new! Look at the pin!\\\" He flourished his plump, brown, and carefully washed hands. \\\"I have a new ring.\\\" He bent his head. \\\"My hat is new.\\\"\\n\\nArtois broke into a roar of laughter that seemed to do him good after his days of work.\\n\\n\\\"You young dandy! And where do you get the money?\\\"\\n\\nPasqualino looked doleful and hung his head.\\n\\n\\\"Signore, I am in debt. But I say to myself, 'Thank the Madonna, I have a rich and generous Padrone who wishes his coachman to be chic. When he sees my clothes he will be contented, and who knows what he will do?' \\\"\\n\\n\\\"Per Bacco! And who is this rich and generous Signore?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ma!\\\" Pasqualino passionately flung out the ringed hand that was not holding the reins--\\\"Ma!--you, Signore.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You young rascal! Turn round and attend to your driving!\\\"\\n\\nBut Artois laughed again. The impudent boyishness of Pasqualino, and his childish passion for finery, were refreshing, and seemed to belong to a young and thoughtless world. The sea-breeze was soft as silk, the afternoon sunshine was delicately brilliant. The Bay looked as it often does in summer--like radiant liberty held in happy arms, alluring, full of promises. And a physical well-being invaded Artois such as he had not known since the day when he had tea with Vere upon the island.\\n\\nHe had been shut in. Now the gates were thrown open, and to what a brilliant world! He issued forth into it with almost joyous expectation.\\n\\nThey went slowly, and presently drew near to the Rotonda. Artois leaned a little forward and saw that the fishermen were at work. They stood in lines upon the pavement pulling at the immense nets which were still a long way out to sea. When the carriage reached them Artois told Pasqualino to draw up, and sat watching the work and the fierce energy of the workers. Half naked, with arms and legs and chests that gleamed in the sun like copper, they toiled, slanting backward, one towards another, laughing, shouting, swearing with a sort of almost angry joy. In their eyes there was a carelessness that was wild, in their gestures a lack of self-consciousness that was savage. But they looked like creatures who must live forever. And to Artois, sedentary for so long, the sight of them brought a feeling almost of triumph, but also a sensation of envy. Their vigor made him pine for movement.\\n\\n\\\"Drive on slowly, Pasqualino,\\\" he said. \\\"I will follow you on foot, and join you at the hill.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si Signore.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1637314243,\"title\":\"\\nThere was something very odd about Gaspare to-day, Vere thought.
