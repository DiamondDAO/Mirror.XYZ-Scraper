"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*In this series, we shine a light on uniquely talented creators that have recently joined the Uptick Network. Introducing the artists, showcasing their work, and interviewing them on the thought process behind their art, their experience as a creator, and their journey into this new and exciting space. This is the first in many series to come.*\\n\\n## Introduction | Edapollo\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*niYgZD8wL1kXD4Sy4ismEA.jpeg)\\n\\nEd (Edapollo) is a designer and music producer from the UK, currently based in Melbourne, Australia.

Ed’s work is currently focused on the music industry, and he has created artwork for **Bonobo, Emancipator, Gabrielle Alpin, RY X** and many more.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*LSfz6fl7FPXWexryK4lKOw.png)\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*172hwYnHE9o166nbg-Eryg.png)\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*XlGLWbvWYNQpzJNVzjavbQ.png)\\n\\nWe caught up with Ed and asked some questions relating to his art, creative process and thoughts on the wider NFT space.\\n\\n## **Could you tell us a little about your artistic background?**\\n\\n*I’m a graphic designer & music producer. I’ve always been a creative and started playing music at the age of 13. I then studied Music & Photography, which took me further down the path before I eventually started working as a freelance designer, working on many different projects.*\\n\\n## **When did you first start seriously creating art?**\\n\\n*At first I set up an Instagram which was purely for fun and having a place to showcase my work. Not long after that I started getting people asking to commission me to work with them, so I guess that was a turning point where I started taking it more seriously.*\\n\\n## **Who are some of the artists you’ve created for?**\\n\\n*I’ve worked on projects for Bonobo, Emancipator, Gabrielle Aplin, RY X and lots more.*\\n\\n## **What inspires you to create?**\\n\\n*I get a real buzz from it, when you create something that excites you it’s a really uplifting feeling and it’s constantly energising my desire to be creative.*\\n\\n## **Do you have a favourite kind of artwork to produce, and could you talk a little about about the process behind it?**\\n\\n*One of my favourite techniques / processes I love to explore is using paint and taking macro photographs of the textures and colours. The way the colours bleed in to each other create some really unique and interesting results. Then in post editing I enjoy refining the images further and remixing them in to different contexts.*\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*VY8RNP6SqPMASu3djpjgrw.jpeg)\\n\\n## **How did you first discover the world of NFTs, and what is your impression on the space as a creator?**\\n\\n*I came across it earlier this year and it seems to be a thriving space for creatives to shine. I’m still a newbie but I’m looking forward to exploring the space further.*\\n\\nYou can check out more of Ed’s work at his [website](https://www.edbidgood.com/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/edbidgood/?hl=en) page.
