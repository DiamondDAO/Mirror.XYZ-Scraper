"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Singapore's digital banking license was perhaps one of the most widely discussed topic in 2019 within fintech circles and we suspect 2020 will not be too different with MAS anticipated to issue licenses by mid-2020.\\n\\nThere were many speculations as to who are the contenders-to-be and there's no shortage of aspirants announcing their interest to bid for the digital banking license.\\n\\nOn December 31, 2019, the application for digital banking license in Singapore was completed as scheduled. In the mid-2020, the results of this digital war will be finally announced. Before the answers are officially announced, we can first find out which organizations are involved in the competition?\\n\\n**Grab & Singtel**\\n\\nOn December 30, 2019, Grab, a sharing ride-hailing platform, officially confirmed to apply for Singapore digital banking license together with Singtel. \\n\\nFor that reason, the two sides have formed a special alliance, in which Grab holds a 60% stake and Singtel 40%. Both sides hope to provide SMEs with more convenient, personalized and digital credit services. \\n\\nBefore that, the two companies have successively involved in financial services such as mobile payment and insurance. Therefore, it is very normal for them to enter the field of digital banking.\\n\\n**Razer Youth Bank**\\n\\nOn January 2, 2020, reports from multiple media showed that technology giant Razer will also participate in the competition. In the future, Razer plans to cooperate with Sheng Siong holdings, FWD, LinkSure Global, Insignia Venture Partners and Carro to establish a digital bank called Razer Youth Bank. \\n\\nAmong them, Razer holds 60% of the equity, while the above-mentioned institutions from supermarket chains, insurance, mobile Internet, venture capital and second-hand car market will enjoy the remaining equity.\\n\\n**[Ant Financial](https://www.holobase.io/company/5badfe18df68ad00012774c0)**\\n\\nOn January 3, 2020, according to a report from Reuters, Ant Financial, a Chinese financial technology giant, also submitted a digital wholesale banking license to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). \\n\\nAnd in November 2019, Ant Financial has expressed its intention to apply for Singapore digital bank to the media. In May 2019, Ant Financial has obtained the Hong Kong virtual banking license issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\\n\\n**iFast Corporation, Hande & Yillion**\\n\\nWealth management firm and mainboard listed iFast Corporation confirmed that they have also applied a digital banking license with two Chinese partners namely — Yillion Group and Hande Group.\\n\\nYillion Group operates a digital bank in China and Hande Group is a fintech firm founded by the former Chairman of WeBank — a digital bank backed by the Tencent Group.\\n\\nThe newly formed consortium is reportedly eyeing the underserved SME sector in Singapore.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, there are already some who have decided to drop out of the race. For example, Nium, a Singapore cross-border payment start-up company (formerly called InstaRem), expressed its willingness to apply when the Singapore Monetary Authority (MAS) announced its license plan. \\n\\nHowever, in November 2019, Nium said it would still focus on international payment business and became the first institution to launch the application.\\n\\nThe digital banking consortium consisting of OCBC, Keppel, Vertex and Validus has reportedly pulled out of the race. After Nium expressed its willingness, the digital banking consortium also said that it would not participate in the application for the digital banking license temporarily because it was inconsistent with the development plan of its member institutions.\\n\\nThis is an article from [weiyangx.com](https://www.weiyangx.com/347723.html), translated by Chris Yuan.\",\"timestamp\":1641455065,\"title\":\"Grab & Singtel, Razer and Ant Financial join the stiff race of Singapore digital banking license bid\"},\"digest\":\"12TavmD7FQPlLgEzqScrtoiGKSKxSlrbSNtmQcb1yxU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x021D29dC0d2DfC3137253fCb9fE56c6BD1d8a225\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JYZDbC55KuWwe2OC6cJhOu8Ak4BlV06YqJ3cLf4IXA8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"EISdO5a5-8cZsq1MjXo7j4mPetZnqTIVk8VXgO6YY2w\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"naZeuzpKSUJTuhGm6zG1bzVurB5DHKkt80HBlxgjLlmPVD2VZQVMjzlMbxBAgEGx1KBue-10Nv7xeDjgjLqFYQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8a5e280c109f2e0b82e94a5ebd8036a14a846924a0ed240d64d91c5724ca6e080811f2c079b4bc53a0fdad0c4e0905ac6a7dbad2e4da00a9f4619a04abb15f4b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JYZDbC55KuWwe2OC6cJhOu8Ak4BlV06YqJ3cLf4IXA8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"EISdO5a5-8cZsq1MjXo7j4mPetZnqTIVk8VXgO6YY2w\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"12TavmD7FQPlLgEzqScrtoiGKSKxSlrbSNtmQcb1yxU\"}"
