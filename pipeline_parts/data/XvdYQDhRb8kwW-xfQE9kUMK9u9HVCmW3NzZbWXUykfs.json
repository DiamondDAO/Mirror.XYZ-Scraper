"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"One of the earliest provocations at Mirror went a little like this: What if you have a great idea‚Ä¶ and what if when telling the story introducing it to the world you could *also* enable the reader to participate in making that story come to life, directly inline within the narrative? This scenario has informed our approach to interface since day one, and lead us to creating a series of *Economic Blocks‚Äî*embeddable interfaces you can place within a story enabling readers to interact by funding and sustaining great ideas. *To be active participants in the story.*\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a6ce55c-ead2-4343-99ae-93568ffbd715.jpeg?height=1012&width=2024&hide=true)\\n\\nClearly we were on to something. We‚Äôre starting to lose count of how many successful projects have taken place during Mirror‚Äôs first few months! Projects like Colin and Samir‚Äôs [NFT auction and split](https://colinandsamir.mirror.xyz/G5kD1SysIvVE-Socv7zknOExp3wZWZPSZ9_sxBj_cV4), Songcamp‚Äôs [auctions and splits for three original songs](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM), Emily‚Äôs [crowdfund for $NOVEL](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg), and many more.\\n\\n![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/permalinks.svg?height=1012&width=2024&size=medium)\\n\\nThe economic blocks powering these projects have turned out to be just that‚Äî*very powerful.* Although they take form as focused embeddable blocks within stories, each contain much of the same functionality you‚Äôd expect from an *entire platform*. No joke!\\n\\nWith this in mind, we decided to give Economic Blocks permanent homes by creating **Permalinks**‚Äîdirect links to URLs where blocks are accessible outside of entries. Take a look by visiting one of the projects above, navigating to an economic block, and clicking the üîó link icon in the heading. Auctions in particular look good!\\n\\nIn truth, this has been on our mind since day one, but overtime the idea was validated by seeing how blocks have been used. We‚Äôre excited to continue introducing other ideas up our sleeve. It‚Äôs easy to imagine how a design system of embeddable ‚Äúblocks‚Äù which represent expanded web3 ‚Äúapps‚Äù may evolve in the future. *Yes, we‚Äôre thinking about THAT, too* üòâ\\n\\nOnwards!\",\"timestamp\":1620771411,\"title\":\"Introducing Block Permalinks\",\"publication\":\"jktest\"},\"digest\":\"d3NhxQBmnhY7KiTH5E1OY_DMlcFX5CAi2sPV_60SXk4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x841fF85B6873d7bfB712C8f7A347C774355b6EC3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BwMOeSYPanA7vfLVrjkx_Hn-yihPsoDDjn1mBmI2SuQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KCu6GKru7ORz-i1EpWsku16K1lZ38egx5Fm5-wwV-Z4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"21opacciEtjojzqQm0XRTwMPkoUAIOxZuPVdBgX4UdX5FutNPIUzDer0xn1r90jSZ3yhVkhCe6nQCFP5TotQGg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x13c8cd7532a0227ad94187f35b5c2b871fdeff064faefbc58d47e78f3f927e6c0200dd7898497fb92f5d91d229cb943b98e5ed1c484f7f06b04be7150c9aa6111c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on jktest.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BwMOeSYPanA7vfLVrjkx_Hn-yihPsoDDjn1mBmI2SuQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KCu6GKru7ORz-i1EpWsku16K1lZ38egx5Fm5-wwV-Z4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"8a229fd0939cf46675bfc68bb941a49203106713cfe3a0e79a9ba6e58bd1804d\"}"
