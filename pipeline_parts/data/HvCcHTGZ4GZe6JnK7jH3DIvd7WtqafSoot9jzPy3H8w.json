"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Decentralized Finance** or **DeFi** for short, is essentially a better and faster financial system created from blockchain technology. DeFi is a collection of a variety of applications and projects in the public blockchain space. The goal for these decentralized applications and services is so they can detach from the traditional *centralized* financial world.\\n\\nIn other words, it allows for a world where the financial system is **controlled** **by the people** and not by one single entity. *Financial Institutions such as banks, funds and brokerage firms offer all of the products and services in the traditional financial world today.*\\n\\nIn this report, we will be explaining how DeFi works and how it can drastically improve the lives of **millions** of people around the world when mass adoption is achieved.\\n\\nHowever, in order for you to truly understand the value of decentralized finance, it is important to be aware of the current state of the traditional financial ecosystem...\\n\\n### Current State of Traditional Finance\\n\\nAs humanity evolves, so do our economies. From bartering for goods and services to creating a currency to make it easier to exchange those same goods and services. Evolution, however, comes at a cost.\\n\\nAs you may already know, central authorities have issued currencies that underpin our economies. This gives them **more power** and thus more people begin to place their trust in them. Economic prosperity or hardships that come to these central authorities rub off on the rest of the global economy. While we have done great in the past century, the financial crisis and the Great Recession revealed a **huge** flaw in our system.\\n\\nIssues for a couple of large financial institutions created a domino effect of tumbling economies and the start of the global recession. There was nothing you or anyone could've done about it...\\n\\nDecentralized Finance uses technology to remove the middleman and enables you to access financial services regardless of ethnicity, age, or cultural identity. dApps *(decentralized applications)* also provide users with more control over their money through anonymous wallets and trading services that would otherwise only be available to large institutions.\\n\\n**This is thanks to blockchain technology.**\\n\\nWhy is blockchain technology so cool? I believe it's because of **Smart Contracts**.\\n\\n### Smart Contracts\\n\\nSmart Contracts are the reason DeFi is able to work. They are a type of computer program that usually underpin the transfer of digital assets from one party to another. The \\\"terms\\\" of the agreement between the two parties are stored on the blockchain, and therefore can be easily tracked but once set, cannot be altered.\\n\\nThe specific terms to facilitate the contract are stored on a blockchain, and hence, do not require the presence of a third party.\\n\\nThis not only allows for huge financial savings on legal fees but also an increased level of security and savings on time.\\n\\nThe most popular blockchain that capitalizes on Smart Contracts is the **Ethereum network**. There are also many alternative networks that are emerging that deliver more speed, security, scalability and lower costs but we'll stick with good 'ol ETH for this report!\\n\\nThe Ethereum network is a 2nd generation blockchain that first maximized the potential of this technology within the financial industry. Ultimately, the impact of Ethereum encouraged businesses and enterprises to build and develop projects that formed the ecosystem of DeFi today.\\n\\n## DeFi Today\\n\\nAt the time of writing this report, DeFi's **TVL** *(Total Value Locked)* is at **$119.7 billion** according to [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/home), making it the fastest-growing sector within the public blockchain space.\\n\\nLet's have a look at the most popular use cases and protocols available in the market today.\\n\\n**1. Lending and Borrowing**\\n\\nThe concept of lending and borrowing has been around for ages and is one of the most popular services available in the financial system today. It's a very well-known method of earning passive income. The concept is very simple - **lenders provide their funds to borrowers at a specific interest rate.** *That's it*.\\n\\nThese services are usually handled and controlled by financial institutions and or large independent entities. In the world of Cryptocurrency, however, lending and borrowing are possible in two specific avenues. **CeFi** (*centralized finance*) and **DeFi**.\\n\\nLending and borrowing on CeFi platforms work similarly to most financial institutions (i.e. banks) as they take hold of your deposited assets, and in return offer you steady gains. It is worth noting that, similar to banks, CeFi platforms don't just hold your money, but rather they loan it out to third parties. This causes much concern as the chances of theft and or hacks increase.\\n\\nOn DeFi protocols, you can take advantage of these services because these protocols give you complete control over your funds at all times, thanks to smart contracts! More importantly, DeFi can be used by anyone, anywhere and without having to provide your personal information.\\n\\nThe top projects in this market are **Aave**, **Compound** and **Maker**.\\n\\n**2. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)**\\n\\nDecentralized exchanges are an essential part of DeFi as they allow users to exchange one token for another *(buy, sell, or trade)* all while **operating without a central authority**. Traditional exchanges *(centralized exchanges or CEXs)* offer similar options, however, extra costs on every transaction and the selection of investments offered are all negative aspects of CEXs that DEXs tend to address.\\n\\nEvery blockchain has a DEX, and one of the most popular is **Uniswap** which is native to the Ethereum blockchain. Uniswap is a chain-specific DEX that is only available on Ethereum. However, **THORChain** is a revolutionary DEX that is capable of offering its services across **different blockchains**.\\n\\nAnother amazing aspect of a DEX is that you do **not** need to deposit your assets in order to use their services. Simply connect your wallet and begin trading/swapping! You should try it out for yourself.\\n\\nFor a list of all the popular DEX's, click here.\\n\\n**3. Asset Management**\\n\\nThe ultimate goal is to make investing more accessible, faster, less expensive and more decentralized in this sector. The functionalities of the DeFi ecosystem make it a favourable home for asset management.\\n\\nIn traditional finance, investors have often taken their positions for granted as they are often able to afford the risks and fees involved, and are part of a demographic that has easy access to investing. Under decentralized asset management, these investment opportunities will be available to a much **larger group of investors all across the world**. Investors that would otherwise be unable to participate in traditional finance.\\n\\nDecentralized asset management will also allow more **transparency**, **composability**, and **trust**. Things are quite murky in traditional asset management today.\\n\\nFor a more in-depth breakdown of asset management in DeFi, click here.\\n\\n**4. Derivatives Market**\\n\\nDerivatives have often proven that they are a **necessity** and that they play a crucial role in supporting the **long-term growth** of any asset class.\\n\\nIn the case of **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum**, assets that have been historically volatile, the introduction of futures and options contracts provided an important opportunity for investors to short and hedge risk against them,\\n\\nSmart contracts allow for the creation of tokenized derivatives without the need for a third party. Agreements are all encoded in the blockchain, ultimately reducing the risk for malicious activity. This also gives retail traders access to opportunities that were previously restricted to them.\\n\\nIf you want to learn more about the Derivatives Market, click here.\\n\\n### DeFi Is The Future Of Finance\\n\\nYou have probably understood by now, that the goal of DeFi is to put more control in the hands of the people, to allow everyone fair and equal opportunities and access to financial services without discrimination or prejudice.\\n\\nAccording to a report conducted by the Global Findex Database, there are **over 1.7 billion** people who do not have access to basic financial services. DeFi, thanks to blockchain technology, can and will eventually improve the way of living for these people. 1.7 billion is **almost** **a third** of the worldâ€™s population!\\n\\nWith all that DeFi has to offer today, the most exciting thing is that it is **still in its infancy**! It's just getting started. Not surprisingly, DeFi is catching up to traditional finance, despite having a few ups and downs which is a normal price to pay when you're constantly innovating. There has been nothing like this in the past, a global *yet* decentralized financial system built by the people, for the people.\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1639182518,\"title\":\"What is DeFi?
