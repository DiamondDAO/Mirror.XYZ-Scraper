"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"We are alone here,\\\" said Brigida. \\\"I am a woman, and I don't know that you may not have come armed. It is only the commonest precaution on my part not to give you a chance of getting at the wax mas k till I have made my conditions.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You never said a word about conditions before.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"True. I remember telling you that I wanted nothing but the novelty of going to the masquerade in the character of my dead enemy, and the luxury of being able to terrify the man who had brutally ridiculed me in old days in the studio. That was the truth. But it is not the less the truth that our experiment on Count Fabio has detained me in this city much longer than I ever intended, that I am all but penniless, and that I deserve to be paid. In plain words, will you buy the mask of me for two hundred scudi?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have not twenty scudi in the world, at my own free disposal.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You must find two hundred if you want the wax mask. I don't wish to threaten--but money I must have. I mention the sum of two hundred scudi, because that is the exact amount offered in the public handbills by Count Fabio's friends for the discovery of the woman who wore the yellow mask at the Marquis Melani's ball. What have I to do but to earn that money if I please, by going to the palace, taking the wax mask with me, and telling them that I am the woman. Suppose I confess in that way; they can do nothing to hurt me, and I should be two hundred scudi the richer. You might be injured, to be sure, if they insisted on knowing who made the wax model, and who suggested the ghastly disguise--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Wretch! do you believe that my character could be injured on the unsupported evidence of any words from your lips?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Father Rocco, for the first time since I have enjoyed the pleasure of your acquaintance, I find you committing a breach of good manners. I shall leave you until you become more like yourself. If you wish to apologize for calling me a wretch, and if you want to secure the wax mask, honor me with a visit before four o'clock this afternoon, and bring two hundred scudi with you. Delay till after four, and it will be too late.\\\"\\n\\nAn instant of silence followed; and then Nanina judged that Brigida must be departing, for she heard the rustling of a dress on the lawn in front of the summer-house. Unfortunately, Scarammuccia heard it too. He twisted himself round in her arms and growled.\\n\\nThe noise disturbed Father Rocco. She heard him rise and leave the summer-house. There would have been time enough, perhaps, for her to conceal herself among some trees if she could have recovered her self-possession at once; but she was incapable of making an effort to regain it. She could neither think nor move--her breath seemed to die away on her lips--as she saw the shadow of the priest stealing over the grass slowly from the front to the back of the summer-house. In another moment they were face to face.\\n\\nHe stopped a few paces from her, and eyed her steadily in dead silence. She still crouched against the summer-house, and still with one hand mechanically kept her hold of the dog. It was well for the priest that she did so. Scarammuccia's formidable teeth were in full view, his shaggy coat was bristling, his eyes were starting, his growl had changed from the surly to the savage note; he was ready to tear down, not Father Rocco only, but all the clergy in Pisa, at a moment's notice.\\n\\n\\\"You have been listening,\\\" said the priest, calmly. \\\"I see it in your face. You have heard all.\\\"\\n\\nShe could not answer a word; she could not take her eyes from him. There was an unnatural stillness in his face, a steady, unrepentant, unfathomable despair in his eyes that struck her with horror. She would have given worlds to be able to rise to her feet and fly from his presence.\\n\\n\\\"I once distrusted you and watched you in secret,\\\" he said, speaking after a short silence, thoughtfully, and with a strange, tranquil sadness in his voice. \\\"And now, what I did by you, you do by me. You put the hope of your life once in my hands. Is it because they were not worthy of the trust that discovery and ruin overtake me, and that you are the instrument of the retribution? Can this be the decree of Heaven--or is it nothing but the blind justice of chance?\\\"\\n\\nHe looked upward, doubtingly, to the lustrous sky above him, and sighed. Nanina's eyes still followed his mechanically. He seemed to feel their influence, for he suddenly looked down at her again.\\n\\n\\\"What keeps you silent? Why are you afraid?\\\" he said. \\\"I can do you no harm, with your dog at your side, and the workmen yonder within call. I can do you no harm, and I wish to do you none. Go back to Pisa; tell what you have heard, restore the man you love to himself, and ruin me. That is your work; do it! I was never your enemy, even when I distrusted you. I am not your enemy now. It is no fault of yours that a fatality has been accomplished through you--no fault of yours that I am rejected as the instrument of securing a righteous restitution to the Church. Rise, child, and go your way, while I go mine, and prepare for what is to come. If we never meet again, remember that I parted from you without one hard saying or one harsh look--parted from you so, knowing that the first words you speak in Pisa will be death to my character, and destruction to the great purpose of my life.\\\"\\n\\nSpeaking these words, always with the same calmness which had marked his manner from the first, he looked fixedly at her for a little while, sighed again, and turned away. Just before he disappeared among the trees, he said \\\"Farewell,\\\" but so softly that she could barely hear it. Some strange confusion clouded her mind as she lost sight of him. Had she injured him, or had he injured her? His words bewildered and oppressed her simple heart. Vague doubts and fears, and a sudden antipathy to remaining any longer near the summer-house, overcame her. She started to her feet, and, keeping the dog still at her side, hurried from the garden to the highroad. There, the wide glow of sunshine, the sight of the city lying before her, changed the current of her thoughts, and directed them all to Fabio and to the future.\\n\\nA burning impatience to be back in Pisa now possessed her. She hastened toward the city at her utmost speed. The doctor was reported to be in the palace when she passed the servants lounging in the courtyard. He saw the moment, she came into his presence, that something had happened, and led her away from the sick-room into Fabio's empty study. There she told him all.\\n\\n\\\"You have saved him,\\\" said the doctor, joyfully. \\\"I will answer for his recovery. Only let that woman come here for the reward; and leave me to deal with her as she deserves. In the meantime, my dear, don't go away from the palace on any account until I give you permission. I am going to send a message immediately to Signor Andrea d'Arbino to come and hear the extraordinary disclosure that you have made to me. Go back to read to the count, as usual, until I want you again; but, remember, you must not drop a word to him yet of what you have said to me. He must be carefully prepared for all that we have to tell him; and must be kept quite in the dark until those preparations are made.\\\"\\n\\nD'Arbino answered the doctor's summons in person; and Nanina repeated her story to him. He and the doctor remained closeted together for some time after she had concluded her narrative and had retired. A little before four o'clock they sent for her again into the study. The doctor was sitting by the table with a bag of money before him, and D'Arbino was telling one of the servants that if a lady called at the palace on the subject of the handbill which he had circulated, she was to be admitted into the study immediately.\\n\\nAs the clock struck four Nanina was requested to take possession of a window-seat, and to wait there until she was summoned. When she had obeyed, the doctor loosened one of the window-curtains, to hide her from the view of any one entering the room.\\n\\nAbout a quarter of an hour elapsed, and then the door was thrown open, and Brigida herself was shown into the study. The doctor bowed, and D'Arbino placed a chair for her. She was perfectly collected, and thanked them for their politeness with her best grace.\\n\\n\\\"I believe I am addressing confidential friends of Count Fabio d'Ascoli?\\\" Brigida began. \\\"May I ask if you are authorized to act for the c ount, in relation to the reward which this handbill offers?\\\"\\n\\nThe doctor, having examined the handbill, said that the lady was quite right, and pointed significantly to the bag of money.\\n\\n\\\"You are prepared, then,\\\" pursued Brigida, smiling, \\\"to give a reward of two hundred scudi to any one able to tell you who the woman is who wore the yellow mask at the Marquis Melani's ball, and how she contrived to personate the face and figure of the late Countess D'Ascoli?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course we are prepared,\\\" answered D'Arbino, a little irritably. \\\"As men of honor, we are not in the habit of promising anything that we are not perfectly willing, under proper conditions, to perform.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Pardon me, my dear friend,\\\" said the doctor; \\\"I think you speak a little too warmly to the lady. She is quite right to take every precaution. We have the two hundred scudi here, madam,\\\" he continued, patting the money-bag; \\\"and we are prepared to pay that sum for the information we want. But\\\" (here the doctor suspiciously moved the bag of scudi from the table to his lap) \\\"we must have proofs that the person claiming the reward is really entitled to it.\\\"\\n\\nBrigida's eyes followed the money-bag greedily.\\n\\n\\\"Proofs!\\\" she exclaimed, taking a small flat box from under her cloak, and pushing it across to the doctor. \\\"Proofs! there you will find one proof that establishes my claim beyond the possibility of doubt.\\\"\\n\\nThe doctor opened the box, and looked at the wax mask inside it; then handed it to D'Arbino, and replaced the bag of scudi on the table.\\n\\n\\\"The contents of that box seem certainly to explain a great deal,\\\" he said, pushing the bag gently toward Brigida, but always keeping his, hand over it. \\\"The woman who wore the yellow domino was, I presume, of the same height as the late countess?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Exactly,\\\" said Brigida. \\\"Her eyes were also of the same color as the late countess's; she wore yellow of the same shade as the hangings in the late countess's room, and she had on, under her yellow mask, the colorless wax model of the late countess's face, now in your friend's hand. So much for that part of the secret. Nothing remains now to be cleared up but the mystery of who the lady was. Have the goodness, sir, to push that bag an inch or two nearer my way, and I shall be delighted to tell you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thank you, madam,\\\" said the doctor, with a very perceptible change in his manner. \\\"We know who the lady was already.\\\"\\n\\nHe moved the bag of scudi while he spoke back to his own side of the table. Brigida's cheeks reddened, and she rose from her seat.\\n\\n\\\"Am I to understand, sir,\\\" she said, haughtily, \\\"that you take advantage of my position here, as a defenseless woman, to cheat me out of the reward?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"By no means, madam,\\\" rejoined the doctor. \\\"We have covenanted to pay the reward to the person who could give us the information we required.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, sir! have I not given you part of it? And am I not prepared to give you the whole?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certainly; but the misfortune is, that another person has been beforehand with you. We ascertained who the lady in the yellow domino was, and how she contrived to personate the face of the late Countess D'Ascoli, several hours ago from another informant. That person has consequently the prior claim; and, on every principle of justice, that person must also have the reward. Nanina, this bag belongs to you--come and take it.\\\"\\n\\nNanina appeared from the window-seat. Brigida, thunderstruck, looked at her in silence for a moment; gasped out, \\\"That girl!\\\"--then stopped again, breathless.\\n\\n\\\"That girl was at the back of the summer-house this morning, while you and your accomplice were talking together,\\\" said the doctor.\\n\\nD'Arbino had been watching Brigida's face intently from the moment of Nanina's appearance, and had quietly stolen close to her side. This was a fortunate movement; for the doctor's last words were hardly out of his mouth before Brigida seized a heavy ruler lying, with some writing materials, on the table. In another instant, if D'Arbino had not caught her arm, she would have hurled it at Nanina's head.\\n\\n\\\"You may let go your hold, sir,\\\" she said, dropping the ruler, and turning toward D'Arbino with a smile on her white lips and a wicked calmness in her steady eyes. \\\"I can wait for a better opportunity.\\\"\\n\\nWith those words she walked to the door; and, turning round there, regarded Nanina fixedly.\\n\\n\\\"I wish I had been a moment quicker with the ruler,\\\" she said, and went out.\\n\\n\\\"There!\\\" exclaimed the doctor; \\\"I told you I knew how to deal with her as she deserved. One thing I am certainly obliged to her for--she has saved us the trouble of going to her house and forcing her to give up the mask. And now, my child,\\\" he continued, addressing Nanina, \\\"you can go home, and one of the men-servants shall see you safe to your own door, in case that woman should still be lurking about the palace. Stop! you are leaving the bag of scudi behind you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can't take it, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And why not?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"*She* would have taken money!\\\" Saying those words, Nanina reddened, and looked toward the door.\\n\\nThe doctor glanced approvingly at D'Arbino. \\\"Well, well, we won't argue about that now,\\\" he said. \\\"I will lock up the money with the mask for to-day. Come here to-morrow morning as usual, my dear. By that time I shall have made up my mind on the right means for breaking your discovery to Count Fabio. Only let us proceed slowly and cautiously, and I answer for success.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\nTHE next morning, among the first visitors at the Ascoli Palace was the master-sculptor, Luca Lomi. He seemed, as the servants thought, agitated, and said he was especially desirous of seeing Count Fabio. On being informed that this was impossible, he reflected a little, and then inquired if the medical attendant of the count was at the palace, and could be spoken with. Both questions were answered in the affirmative, and he was ushered into the doctor's presence.\\n\\n\\\"I know not how to preface what I want to say,\\\" Luca began, looking about him confusedly. \\\"May I ask you, in the first place, if the work-girl named Nanina was here yesterday?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She was,\\\" said the doctor.\\n\\n\\\"Did she speak in private with any one?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes; with me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then you know everything?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Absolutely everything.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am glad at least to find that my object in wishing to see the count can be equally well answered by seeing you. My brother, I regret to say--\\\" He stopped perplexedly, and drew from his pocket a roll of papers.\\n\\n\\\"You may speak of your brother in the plainest terms,\\\" said the doctor. \\\"I know what share he has had in promoting the infamous conspiracy of the Yellow Mask.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My petition to you, and through you to the count, is, that your knowledge of what my brother has done may go no further. If this scandal becomes public it will ruin me in my profession. And I make little enough by it already,\\\" said Luca, with his old sordid smile breaking out again faintly on his face.\\n\\n\\\"Pray do you come from your brother with this petition?\\\" inquired the doctor.\\n\\n\\\"No; I come solely on my own account. My brother seems careless what happens. He has made a full statement of his share in the matter from the first; has forwarded it to his ecclesiastical superior (who will send it to the archbishop), and is now awaiting whatever sentence they choose to pass on him. I have a copy of the document, to prove that he has at least been candid, and that he does not shrink from consequences which he might have avoided by flight. The law cannot touch him, but the Church can--and to the Church he has confessed. All I ask is, that he may be spared a public exposure. Such an exposure would do no good to the count, and it would do dreadful injury to me. Look over the papers yourself, and show them, whenever you think proper, to the master of this house. I have every confidence in his honor and kindness, and in yours.\\\"\\n\\nHe laid the roll of papers open on the table, and then retired with great humility to the window. The doctor looked over them with some curiosity.\\n\\nThe statement or confession began by boldly avowing the writer's conviction that part of the property which the Count Fabio d'Ascoli had inherited from his ancestors had been obtained by fraud and misrepresentatio n from the Church. The various authorities on which this assertion was based were then produced in due order; along with some curious particles of evidence culled from old manuscripts, which it must have cost much trouble to collect and decipher.\\n\\nThe second section was devoted, at great length, to the reasons which induced the writer to think it his absolute duty, as an affectionate son and faithful servant of the Church, not to rest until he had restored to the successors of the apostles in his day the property which had been fraudulently taken from them in days gone by. The writer held himself justified, in the last resort, and in that only, in using any means for effecting this restoration, except such as might involve him in mortal sin.\\n\\nThe third section described the priest's share in promoting the marriage of Maddalena Lomi with Fabio; and the hopes he entertained of securing the restitution of the Church property through his influence over his niece, in the first place, and, when she had died, through his influence over her child, in the second. The necessary failure of all his projects, if Fabio married again, was next glanced at; and the time at which the first suspicion of the possible occurrence of this catastrophe occurred to his mind was noted with scrupulous accuracy.\\n\\nThe fourth section narrated the manner in which the conspiracy of the Yellow Mask had originated. The writer described himself as being in his brother's studio on the night of his niece's death, harassed by forebodings of the likelihood of Fabio's marrying again, and filled with the resolution to prevent any such disastrous second union at all hazards. He asserted that the idea of taking the wax mask from his brother's statue flashed upon him on a sudden, and that he knew of nothing to lead to it, except, perhaps, that he had been thinking just before of the superstitious nature of the young man's character, as he had himself observed it in the studio. He further declared that the idea of the wax mask terrified him at first; that he strove against it as against a temptation of the devil; that, from fear of yielding to this temptation, he abstained even from entering the studio during his brother's absence at Naples, and that he first faltered in his good resolution when Fabio returned to Pisa, and when it was rumored, not only that the young nobleman was going to the ball, but that he would certainly marry for the second time.\\n\\nThe fifth section related that the writer, upon this, yielded to temptation rather than forego the cherished purpose of his life by allowing Fabio a chance of marrying again--that he made the wax mask in a plaster mold taken from the face of his brother's statue--and that he then had two separate interviews with a woman named Brigida (of whom he had some previous knowledge ), who was ready and anxious, from motives of private malice, to personate the deceased countess at the masquerade. This woman had suggested that some anonymous letters to Fabio would pave the way in his mind for the approaching impersonation, and had written the letters herself. However, even when all the preparations were made, the writer declared that he shrank from proceeding to extremities; and that he would have abandoned the whole project but for the woman Brigida informing him one day that a work-girl named Nanina was to be one of the attendants at the ball. He knew the count to have been in love with this girl, even to the point of wishing to marry her; he suspected that her engagement to wait at the ball was preconcerted; and, in consequence, he authorized his female accomplice to perform her part in the conspiracy.\\n\\nThe sixth section detailed the proceedings at the masquerade, and contained the writer's confession that, on the night before it, he had written to the count proposing the reconciliation of a difference that had taken place between  them, solely for the purpose of guarding himself against suspicion. He next acknowledged that he had borrowed the key of the Campo Santo gate, keeping the authority to whom it was intrusted in perfect ignorance of the purpose for which he wanted it. That purpose was to carry out the ghastly delusion of the wax mask (in the very probable event of the wearer being followed and inquired after) by having the woman Brigida taken up and set down at the gate of the cemetery in which Fabio's wife had been buried.\\n\\nThe seventh section solemnly averred that the sole object of the conspiracy was to prevent the young nobleman from marrying again, by working on his superstitious fears; the writer repeating, after this avowal, that any such second marriage would necessarily destroy his project for promoting the ultimate restoration of the Church possessions, by diverting Count Fabio's property, in great part, from his first wife's child, over whom the priest would always have influence, to another wife and probably other children, over whom he could hope to have none.\\n\\nThe eighth and last section expressed the writer's contrition for having allowed his zeal for the Church to mislead him into actions liable to bring scandal on his cloth; reiterated in the strongest language his conviction that, whatever might be thought of the means employed, the end he had proposed to himself was a most righteous one; and concluded by asserting his resolution to suffer with humility any penalties, however severe, which his ecclesiastical superiors might think fit to inflict on him.\\n\\nHaving looked over this extraordinary statement, the doctor addressed himself again to Luca Lomi.\\n\\n\\\"I agree with you,\\\" he said, \\\"that no useful end is to be gained now by mentioning your brother's conduct in public--always provided, however, that his ecclesiastical superiors do their duty. I shall show these papers to the count as soon as he is fit to peruse them, and I have no doubt that he will be ready to take my view of the matter.\\\"\\n\\nThis assurance relieved Luca Lomi of a great weight of anxiety. He bowed and withdrew.\\n\\nThe doctor placed the papers in the same cabinet in which he had secured the wax mask. Before he locked the doors again he took out the flat box, opened it, and looked thoughtfully for a few minutes at the mask inside, then sent for Nanina.\\n\\n\\\"Now, my child,\\\" he said, when she appeared, \\\"I am going to try our first experiment with Count Fabio; and I think it of great importance that you should be present while I speak to him.\\\"\\n\\nHe took up the box with the mask in it, and beckoning to Nanina to follow him, led the way to Fabio's chamber.\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\nABOUT six months after the events already related, Signor Andrea d'Arbino and the Cavaliere Finello happened to be staying with a friend, in a seaside villa on the Castellamare shore of the bay of Naples. Most of their time was pleasantly occupied on the sea, in fishing and sailing. A boat was placed entirely at their disposal. Sometimes they loitered whole days along the shore; sometimes made trips to the lovely islands in the bay.\\n\\nOne evening they were sailing near Sorrento, with a light wind. The beauty of the coast tempted them to keep the boat close inshore. A short time before sunset, they rounded the most picturesque headland they had yet passed; and a little bay, with a white-sand beach, opened on their view. They noticed first a villa surrounded by orange and olive trees on the rocky heights inland; then a path in the cliff-side leading down to the sands; then a little family party on the beach, enjoying the fragrant evening air.\\n\\nThe elders of the group were a lady and gentleman, sitting together on the sand. The lady had a guitar in her lap. and was playing a simple dance melody. Close at her side a young child was rolling on the beach in high glee; in front of her a little girl was dancing to the music, with a very extraordinary partner in the shape of a dog, who was capering on his hind legs in the most grotesque manner. The merry laughter of the girl, and the lively notes of the guitar were heard distinctly across the still water.\\n\\n\\\"Edge a little nearer in shore,\\\" said D'Arbino to his friend, who was steering; \\\"and keep as I do in the shadow of the sail. I want to see the faces of th ose persons on the beach without being seen by them.\\\"\\n\\nFinello obeyed. After approaching just near enough to see the countenances of the party on shore, and to be barked at lustily by the dog, they turned the boat's head again toward the offing.\\n\\n\\\"A pleasant voyage, gentlemen,\\\" cried the clear voice of the little girl. They waved their hats in return; and then saw her run to the dog and take him by the forelegs. \\\"Play, Nanina,\\\" they heard her say. \\\"I have not half done with my partner yet.\\\" The guitar sounded once more, and the grotesque dog was on his hind legs in a moment.\\n\\n\\\"I had heard that he was well again, that he had married her lately, and that he was away with her and her sister, and his child by the first wife,\\\" said D'Arbino; \\\"but I had no suspicion that their place of retirement was so near us. It is too soon to break in upon their happiness, or I should have felt inclined to run the boat on shore.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I never heard the end of that strange adventure of the Yellow Mask,\\\" said Finello. \\\"There was a priest mixed up in it, was there not?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes; but nobody seems to know exactly what has become of him. He was sent for to Rome, and has never been heard of since. One report is, that he has been condemned to some mysterious penal seclusion by his ecclesiastical superiors--another, that he has volunteered, as a sort of Forlorn Hope, to accept a colonial curacy among rough people, and in a pestilential climate. I asked his brother, the sculptor, about him a little while ago, but he only shook his head, and said nothing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And the woman who wore the yellow mask?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She, too, has ended mysteriously. At Pisa she was obliged to sell off everything she possessed to pay her debts. Some friends of hers at a milliner's shop, to whom she applied for help, would have nothing to do with her. She left the city, alone and penniless.\\\"\\n\\nThe boat had approached the next headland on the coast while they were talking They looked back for a last glance at the beach. Still the notes of the guitar came gently across the quiet water; but there mingled with them now the sound of the lady's voice. She was singing. The little girl and the dog were at her feet, and the gentleman was still in his old place close at her side.\\n\\nIn a few minutes more the boat rounded the next headland, the beach vanished from view, and the music died away softly in the distance.\\n\\nLAST LEAVES FROM LEAH'S DIARY.\\n\\n3d of June.--Our stories are ended; our pleasant work is done. It is a lovely summer afternoon. The great hall at the farmhouse, after having been filled with people, is now quite deserted. I sit alone at my little work-table, with rather a crying sensation at my heart, and with the pen trembling in my fingers, as if I was an old woman already. Our manuscript has been sealed up and taken away; the one precious object of all our most anxious thoughts for months past--our third child, as we have got to call it--has gone out from us on this summer's day, to seek its fortune in the world.\\n\\nA little before twelve o'clock last night, my husband dictated to me the last words of \\\"The Yellow Mask.\\\" I laid down the pen, and closed the paper thoughtfully. With that simple action the work that we had wrought at together so carefully and so long came to a close. We were both so silent and still, that the murmuring of the trees in the night air sounded audibly and solemnly in our room.\\n\\nWilliam's collection of stories has not, thus far, been half exhausted yet; but those who understand the public taste and the interests of bookselling better than we, think it advisable not to risk offering too much to the reader at first. If individual opinions can be accepted as a fair test, our prospects of success seem hopeful. The doctor (but we must not forget that he is a friend) was so pleased with the two specimen stories we sent to him, that he took them at once to his friend, the editor of the newspaper, who showed his appreciation of what he read in a very gratifying manner. He proposed that William should publish in the newspaper, on very fair terms, any short anecdotes and curious experiences of his life as a portrait-painter, which might not be important enough to put into a book. The money which my husband has gained from time to time in this way has just sufficed to pay our expenses at the farmhouse up to within the last month; and now our excellent friends here say they will not hear anything more from us on the subject of the rent until the book is sold and we have plenty of money. This is one great relief and happiness. Another, for which I feel even more grateful, is that William's eyes have gained so much by their long rest, that even the doctor is surprised at the progress he has made. He only puts on his green shade now when he goes out into the sun, or when the candles are lit. His spirits are infinitely raised, and he is beginning to talk already of the time when he will unpack his palette and brushes, and take to his old portrait-painting occupations again.\\n\\nWith all these reasons for being happy, it seems unreasonable and ungracious in me to be feeling sad, as I do just at this moment. I can only say, in my own justification, that it is a mournful ceremony to take leave of an old friend; and I have taken leave twice over of the book that has been like an old friend to me--once when I had written the last word in it, and once again when I saw it carried away to London.\\n\\nI packed the manuscript up with my own hands this morning, in thick brown paper, wasting a great deal of sealing-wax, I am afraid, in my anxiety to keep the parcel from bursting open in case it should be knocked about on its journey to town. Oh me, how cheap and common it looked, in its new form, as I carried it downstairs! A dozen pairs of worsted stockings would have made a larger parcel; and half a crown's worth of groceries would have weighed a great deal heavier.\\n\\nJust as we had done dinner the doctor and the editor came in. The first had called to fetch the parcel--I mean the manuscript; the second had come out with him to Appletreewick for a walk. As soon as the farmer heard that the book was to be sent to London, he insisted that we should drink success to it all round. The children, in high glee, were mounted up on the table, with a glass of currant-wine apiece; the rest of us had ale; the farmer proposed the toast, and his sailor son led the cheers. We all joined in (the children included), except the editor--who, being the only important person of the party, could not, I suppose, afford to compromise his dignity by making a noise. He was extremely polite, however, in a lofty way, to me, waving his hand and bowing magnificently every time he spoke. This discomposed me a little; and I was still more flurried when he said that he had written to the London publishers that very day, to prepare them for the arrival of our book.\\n\\n\\\"Do you think they will print it, sir?\\\" I ventured to ask.\\n\\n\\\"My dear madam, you may consider it settled,\\\" said the editor, confidently. \\\"The letter is written--the thing is done.
