"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I and many friends, also looked up foreign for private domain flow of the view. No, but for many years, Community has been popular, and the effect is visible.\\n\\nFor example, many enterprises \\\"developer community\\\", \\\"CIO club \\\"... It is of great help to the brand and also brings continuous growth momentum.\\n\\nCompanies can participate in communities where peers in a field freely share ideas to find product ideas, build user loyalty, cultivate free \\\"market researchers and word of mouth...\\n\\nThe community is open, inclusive and diverse.\\n\\nFor example, the technical communities of large enterprises such as Cisco and Salesforce have offline meetings every year to share the latest technology trends and practical experience in addition to daily communication.\\n\\nThe seemingly loose communities of these companies take a lot of effort to maintain.\\n\\nGroups that don't take the time and effort to run and throw corporate ads into them are not community at all, but disrespectful to customers.\\n\\nLow frequency customers do not look, high frequency customers angered, delete or shield is often the case.\\n\\nIn the community operation, continuous communication, continuous demand to meet, even more than customers think of suggestions, for re-purchase and stick to customers to give a reasonable reason.\\n\\nIn the end, community can help enterprises tap demand, do a good job in brand maintenance, and timely insight into market changes, and finally spread to more customers through word of mouth.\\n\\nHowever, not all decision-making groups are suitable for engaging in community. For example, it is ok for technical personnel and marketing personnel who like to communicate. It seems that corporate finance and procurement are inherently not suitable for communicating and sharing in the community.\",\"timestamp\":1635601822,\"title\":\"Can B2B customer communities be built?\"},\"digest\":\"uZrsyvVBoFPmfAXfBaxitR_U846MLUq4tFj3s-Lecwg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x636330c3D78A494B6fDB20b5D6DF07B235a0377b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RNlPYWdYKpEiIlS-ot5ZFYBI6uNCQnQiGqTSUYgC84M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"vDgeST0h9vm-0UJFNSWItJdixoLULSes0BonQDUGWHU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"CgIQBbCdilYyrjnu1-hKGtvNZX0EoCMFWXDL9pjO9PJL7odKVMSHxkaLVTO7UkNNoAU4Zuxw3GlFaKiXdo8F2w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x90feb5bcbceec5c830533d77a49a6ad7e24bec57c50671eac951b1ad3024d2311115d490f090e94be0fcd0bc61162d0635fe9bb0bbf16842782c5211f31bedac1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RNlPYWdYKpEiIlS-ot5ZFYBI6uNCQnQiGqTSUYgC84M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"vDgeST0h9vm-0UJFNSWItJdixoLULSes0BonQDUGWHU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"uZrsyvVBoFPmfAXfBaxitR_U846MLUq4tFj3s-Lecwg\"}"
