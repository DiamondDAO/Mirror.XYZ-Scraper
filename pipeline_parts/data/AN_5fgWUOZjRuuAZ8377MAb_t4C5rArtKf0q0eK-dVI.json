"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"It is my aim to try to convince you that BTC's biggest long-term factor in determining its value is not inherent traits which are very desirable i.e. the well known supply limit, permission-less model that allows audit and provides censorship resistance...  The biggest long term factor is how those traits are valued within the global geopolitical context. To be more specific BTC's long-term value ceiling is inversely proportional to the global geopolitical power distribution and subsequent stability.\\n\\nIn this piece I do not intend to cover the basics of BTC nor even some of desirable and pioneering traits of BTC, I leave that rabbit hole for yourself to explore. [Bitcoin Information & Educational Resources](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html) is a good place, there are many good places.\\n\\nI do want to take a moment to differentiate long-term factors from short-term ones. Short-term factors move price in the, well, short term. It could be a million things, some examples are new ETF/ETN(s), regulatory action(s), big frauds and hacks or narratives like institutional onboarding tsunami. I'm using short-term not in a degrading sense, these factors have short staying power. All of these examples share a certain trait, they can affect price (potentially quite a lot) but only in the short term < 3 years. You're unlikely to still be talking about potential ETF in 10 years time. The other key differentiator between short term and long term is how HODLers view them, they shouldn't care about the short-term and but should care about the long term. There might be a segment of HODLers that never ever sell, I'm guess push comes to shove most HODLers are not in that camp. Long-term factors are important when an asset class has reached maturity, BTC is not there yet.\\n\\nEven though I believe geopolitical power distribution to be the most powerful ceiling on BTC price or peak predictor in the long term that's not to discount the large impact that short term factors will have on BTC's price as it matures. There will never be one singular thing that can ascribe the complex world we live in.\\n\\n## Geopolitical power distribution and stability\\n\\nFor me geopolitical power distribution lives on a spectrum, on the one end imagine the whole world is governed by a single entity and on the other end the world is governed by a large number of independent and similarly powerful entities. Just to be topical (2020) we can say the former to be an alternate timeline where China dominates the world and owns 70% of trade, an example of the latter might be everyone adopts Switzerland's canton system, a world divided into cantons with no even less centralised overtures than what the Swiss has. Just to orient ourselves let’s say 2020 is somewhere closer to the middle having swung over the last 60 years from the left hand side from a  heavily US dominated world after WWII to one where the US is starting to lose some of that dominance to China. This is most visible in the economic realm.\\n\\nIt is worth mentioning that as power concentrates (as we move to the left side of spectrum) there is more and more stability. Stability in the aggregate sense, there may well be regions opposing this concentration, regional conflicts and wars are an example of this. In aggregate however stability and power concentration together ushers in an era where control flows to the entity. There are macro and micro examples of this everywhere. China as a country is an example where there is strong concentration of power and high stability although this waxes and wanes. Another example might be a new manager that just entered a recently restructured company, she has both low-power and low-stability. The reason stability is worth mentioning is because power concentration changes over time and stability is generally the leading indicator of that change, instability signals a power concentration change as it flows to another entity or perhaps re-acquired by the original entity.\\n\\nAny entity that enters an era of new found power and stability always will exercise that power, it is the form of execution that varies, benevolent dictators chose to exercise that power in a benign form. In this new era both the power holders as well as the subjects of power will begin to mould their environment into one that efficient based on the form of power deployed. i.e. China has a rule by law system where all things are subservient to the ideology of social homogeneity and social cohesion/stability and China achieves this via rule by law.\\n\\nNow money maybe an amoral instrument but the systems of control around money will be always subservient to the ideology of the entity that controls power. China's banking system is ultimately beholden to the government, via rule by law, of whatever the government's aims are. In China’s case the primary goal is social cohesion and stability. This is in contrast to the US's banking system which developed around a government that had a founding ideology of freedom hence a relentless background push for deregulation.\\n\\nIn an environment where I have little freedom and choice (higher power) and there’s no widespread discontent (high stability), the natural inclination of the populous will be to operate in a manner that’s most efficient for the environment. That is rely on the trusted entity, examples can be use WeChat for all payment, invest in government sanctioned assets… A person in this world might say \\\"why would I be interested in an asset class that is most valuable in an distributed trust-less world, my world is very trusted in fact there’s only one entity controlling most aspects of my collectivist society! Also what if my government came down with a ban-hammer on this stuff then I would lose everything.\\\" There will always be renegades in any society but the volume is just too small to make a difference not to collectivist societies are incentivised to cure renegades. Now if the whole world is just China, there would be a very low value for something like BTC because the wider populous has no need for this. Now if the populous is discontent and a rebellion is forming (low stability & high power) you can start to see a path where a non-centralised asset class becomes very valuable.\\n\\nTo be continued in Part 2 when I get some time, in the rest of this series I plan to cover \\\"Turmoil and price\\\" and \\\"Historical parallels\\\".\",\"timestamp\":1633734161,\"title\":\"BTC and geopolitical power distribution - the biggest long term factor - Part 1\"},\"digest\":\"Mw22Q_QXgGEqJ6HVaO74BkFod52bQ8tCLPTgOpiKn08\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2a41D6d9f24F4a1458F1072e83f40736f43eF16c\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"YyWGjwHfGMH0wLuWZrc0_xsvrZSsc0xwODJsolclRZ0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"aj0RzgrNAUQnHBNSk8aNUlZdtFKPz4w_ebl8lPQNae8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"U_i5Redz7PjfEDOhU2dULZL9OsfmHg7r5pRAbLS_pPgmtw6ds7JbkRDIoz0Z3sKLw4hjmZXnuOaaihiVHZ-24A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xbd751be54b03d24f6a7e31845ba6765fe20504a118693ab9211a287b3a276d0825611b75319079a61e33dd593c788f4469d1e965ef3822407ffd15de694519091b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"YyWGjwHfGMH0wLuWZrc0_xsvrZSsc0xwODJsolclRZ0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"aj0RzgrNAUQnHBNSk8aNUlZdtFKPz4w_ebl8lPQNae8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Mw22Q_QXgGEqJ6HVaO74BkFod52bQ8tCLPTgOpiKn08\"}"
