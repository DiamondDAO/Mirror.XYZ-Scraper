"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I planned on writing a post detailing how I set my 2020 goals today. Instead, I got sidetracked tonight (i.e., prioritized) engaging with a few Crypto projects, most notably [LinksDao](https://linksdao.io/) and [RabbitHole](http://rabbithole.gg/), so that post will have to wait.\\n\\nIn 2008, I dove deep into emerging web2. As a first-year elementary school teacher with no clue how to teach, I found a community on Twitter. That pushed me to contribute to [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) to start my first blog and regularly build value with strangers on the internet. That inspired me to leverage [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), and Crowdfunding sites to co-found a nonprofit community for teachers, K-12 students, and makers to figure out how to leverage emerging online tools to build cool shit. That work eventually led to co-founding my own web2 company and ultimately landing my dream job at Lyft.\\n\\nCrypto has been top of mind since 2019, but getting involved in a few DAOs has generated the same excitement I felt first signing up for Twitter way back in the late aughts. I’m profoundly and genuinely excited.\\n\\nIt can be confusing, scary, and wild. But it’s fun. And it’s worth it.\\n\\nI’m also cross-publishing my posts on [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/mrsenorhill.eth), a DAO for writers. I’d like to go all-in on the platform (it’s what I’ve linked on my Twitter bio), but will figure out a better strategy later. It’s a really cool project.\\n\\n**Sidenote**: I bought a new laptop tonight. The first three apps I downloaded: 1.) Discord (to talk to DAO communities), Brave (a web browser that uses crypto rewards), and MetaMask (a crypto wallet).
