"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"***Project RIFT is a Metaverse event born from the Loot (For Adventurers) project. The unleashing of Loot has caused ripples ripping a rift in the Metaverse. The opening of the Rift has created a new form of concentrated magic, known as Loot Crystals, constantly shifting and wildly chaotic.***\\n\\nThe first Crystals to coalesce bring with them forgotten magic and the ancient energy that powers it...**Mana.**\\n\\n## What are Mana Crystals?\\n\\nMana Crystals are the first Crystals that have come out of the Rift. They generate Mana over time, and can be leveled up to increase their traits (like Mana generation, mana capacity, and others). You will use your Loot bags, mLoot bags, or Genesis Adventurers to go into the Rift (our smart contract) to claim your Crystal. \\n\\n## How do Mana Crystals work?\\n\\n*When you first find your Crystal, it’s part of your bag… almost like it was always there.* Crystals are registered to the Loot, mLoot, or GA you used to claim it. \\n\\nCrystals have 6 main properties: Name, Color, Spin, Resonance, Slabs, and Level. As you level up your Crystal, they gain increased Spin, Resonance, and Slabs.\\n\\nA Crystal can be removed from your bag (minted into an ERC721) at any point. *We don’t do this by default cause it results in higher gas costs for playing the game.*\\n\\n### What do these traits do?\\n\\nThe intent is that anyone can build off Crystals and use the traits for whatever they’d like. On day one, we support using Crystals and their traits for Mana.\\n\\n### Mana\\n\\nIt’s an ERC20 token that is discharged from the Rift and Crystals. \\n\\n**Mana Generation:** Every day, Crystals generate Mana equal to their Resonance. The Mana is stored in the Crystal until the Mana is extracted at the Rift. Crystals can’t store more Mana than their Level \\\\* Resonance. Finally, we use Spin to determine the maximum amount of Mana a Crystal can produce at a given level. \\n\\n**Leveling up:** Crystals can be leveled up by waiting for them to fully charge up, and then sacrificing that Mana for a +1 to its level.\\n\\nAlthough all these interactions can be done by interacting with the Smart Contract directly. We built a dApp to make it as easy as possible.\\n\\n![We built a dApp to handle Crystal claiming, management, and Mana generation. \\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wh-Exhiq2xMeQJUhM6fvn.png?height=813&width=774)\\n\\n### Genesis Adventurer Offering\\n\\nWe’ve been working on figuring out a Genesis Adventure collaboration since we announced the Rift project. Huge shout out to @timshel for exploring ideas on how we can make something work. \\n\\nWe’re excited to announce, at launch GAs will be able to claim a Level 10 Crystal with their GA NFTs! \\n\\n### \\n\\n*We were inspired to come up with a new UX for NFTs, and have done that with Crystals. We hope you enjoy them! made by chris and tony*\",\"timestamp\":1635373239,\"title\":\"The Rift + Mana Crystals\"},\"digest\":\"dIcv3yPIx7_aTloVXUcU9CPol21t7WDonsspC-RUHeI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xF7c454Feb83b0886f21C2A1FEd78ecD246529789\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"983CmwmO6xvrUHA0nQJ-OEjZnUCf4hvUigtUKEry8Xg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NViMzAx--DkjqKQxTa0jHQAFvN7HEqwWdqm6Lah4KZc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"hv47270ufawJbKfdGwd2YB0WUrMCVGBdR-98Wps0-PznbZvvMImREsbJPzVlOa2w3Wy0InX5ZYv-YpWQNN-Gwg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x276b830846709f03c7fb4b4b0d928c2ab25829b0af0fdcc449fcbd616a358ea70316a099fd04de0faf556e8f5bb9207b31c9773165d8e5356fb3b4eb87fb4db31b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"983CmwmO6xvrUHA0nQJ-OEjZnUCf4hvUigtUKEry8Xg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NViMzAx--DkjqKQxTa0jHQAFvN7HEqwWdqm6Lah4KZc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"dIcv3yPIx7_aTloVXUcU9CPol21t7WDonsspC-RUHeI\"}"
