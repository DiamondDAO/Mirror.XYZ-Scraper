"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Note: **This is not official ConstitutionDAO messaging. This is just coming from me, a member of ConstitutionDAO.**\\n\\nWith everyone’s support [ConstitutionDAO](https://constitutiondao.com) has already **raised $4,931,440** (as of this writing). This is awesome. But there’s a problem.\\n\\nWe only have 2 more days. **And we need to raise something closer to 50 million if we really want to pull this off.**\\n\\nHow can we do this?\\n\\nWhat if… **we use memes?**\\n\\nWhat if we **meme magic** the sueccess [ConstitutionDAO ](https://constitutiondao.com)to buy the constitution and deliver the message that the **constitution belongs in the hands of the people -** not a rich billionaire private owner.\\n\\n![let's meme our way to victory](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qe-vAKUNzy1FnTNd9zLRi.png?height=239&width=648)\\n\\n## Introducing… the NFT split\\n\\nMost popular NFT platforms allow for something called a Split. **A split is when you let the benefits of your sold NFT go to multiple parties** instead of just one.\\n\\n*\\\\*[insert Owen Wilson saying wow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxiVYEjp0Ww)\\\\**\\n\\nWhat does that mean? You can **support ConstitutionDAO by selling an NFT** and then **splitting the proceeds to ConstitutionDAO**.\\n\\nFor example, I split this entry! The proceeds of this entry are split as follows:\\n\\n* 90% go to ConstitutionDAO.\\n* 10% will go to a foundation called [GiveWell](https://givewell.org) an [effective altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism)-focused organization.\\n\\nWhen you make your NFT, **you could make the other 10% go to yourself**, but I thought since I’m involved with ConstitutionDAO I don’t want to take advantage of that fact and take anyone’s money.\\n\\n**So how can you help ConstitutionDAO?**\\n\\nYou can NFT songs, like this one:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/songadaymann/status/1460316250924531726?s=21](https://twitter.com/songadaymann/status/1460316250924531726?s=21)\\n\\nYou can NFT memes, like this one:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/sullydoesitall/status/1460125673922703369?s=21](https://twitter.com/sullydoesitall/status/1460125673922703369?s=21)\\n\\nOr just NFT tweets directly -- like the first ConstitutionDAO tweet just 4 days ago:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/ConstitutionDAO/status/1458990413625315354?s=20](https://twitter.com/ConstitutionDAO/status/1458990413625315354?s=20)\\n\\n**Here’s how you can do it:**\\n\\n1. First you’ll need a [web3 wallet](https://metamask.io/)\\n2. Next you need to [create a split](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/splits). Mirror (the platform I’m using) [makes this relatively easy](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/splits). Just add ConstitutionDAO’s address as getting a percent of the NFT (I would recommend using as high as a percentage as possible to support us, but you can choose whatever you want) the other percent can be **your own ETH address or a cause you care about** (like GiveWell in my case).\\n\\n   **ConstitutionDAO’s ETH address is: [0xb1C95AC257029D11F3f64ac67b2307A426699322](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb1c95ac257029d11f3f64ac67b2307a426699322)**\\n\\n   \\\\- Note: If you’re using mirror make sure that the .csv you create has no formatting or it will give you a bug.\\n3. Next, start making memes and [post them in our discord](https://discord.gg/p2jdESeVfy)!\\n4. If your memes are dank the **11,290 members** (as of this writing) might buy it! Post in our #memes channel disclose the split you’re using (although it’s on chain, so everyone will know if you’re telling the truth!)\\n\\n## Ok… who actually controls this thing? What’s really going on with this?? Is this a scam??\\n\\nThis was my first instinct too, I was extremely skeptical. However, there’s something beautiful about a DAO -- **all the transactions happen publicly on chain.** So you don’t have to trust others, it’s all publicly verifiable.\\n\\nWe have pushed for as much as transparency as we possibly can offer given the time constraints, and have published all the answers to all the most common questions people have here: **[Official ConstitutionDAO FAQs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wp042niF6a_KDytccxcpuOsBbQ1ZX-Ie75iDUnIO6uo/edit#)**\\n\\nWe have pushed so much for **transparency** over time.\\n\\n1. **[Open source code.](https://github.com/ConstitutionDAO)**\\n2. **[Sharing who owns the multi-sig wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb1c95ac257029d11f3f64ac67b2307a426699322)** (who has the funds) -- the owners of the wallet are all extremely trusted people in the web3 community. I’ve personally worked with them like crazy these past few days, **they’re all incredibly talented and all want just one thing: To buy The Constitution.**\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/ConstitutionDAO/status/1460435156427329543](https://twitter.com/ConstitutionDAO/status/1460435156427329543)\\n\\n3\\\\. All of our smart contracts are community vetted and battle tested with millions of funds in them before. [Vet them yourself here.](https://github.com/jbx-protocol)\\n\\n4\\\\. **None of the core contributors have taken money** or have pre-mined any of the token for themselves.\\n\\n[From the official FAQs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wp042niF6a_KDytccxcpuOsBbQ1ZX-Ie75iDUnIO6uo/edit#): *The core team has not received or pre-minted any tokens. Following the purchase of The Constitution, we intend to submit a proposal to be voted on by the community. While this is unusual, we believe that it establishes a precedence of mutual trust between the core team and the backers of the ConstitutionDAO.*\\n\\nYou don’t have to listen to me: Everything is publicly on-chain, so it’s all **publicly verifiable that no tokens were pre-mined.**\\n\\n5\\\\. We will govern the fate of the constitution together. But we will make sure that it is very difficult to make any modifications or alter / destroy the constitution.\\n\\n[From the official FAQs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wp042niF6a_KDytccxcpuOsBbQ1ZX-Ie75iDUnIO6uo/edit#): *ConstitutionDAO is seeking an esteemed partner to publicly display the Constitution. The eventual home must have the expertise to properly house, store, and maintain the artifact. Additionally, the community has expressed strong preferences for institutions that are free to the public and willing to cover the costs associated with housing the document. **Since the inception of ConstitutionDAO, the community has continuously emphasized the value of historical preservation. None of the core contributors wish to physically alter The Constitution in any way**, and are committed to its safety and security. We intend to formalize this foundational value by a vote of the DAO.*\\n\\n## This feels like a scam. Isn’t this just a multi-sig with a bunch of money being raised for just a few people?\\n\\nBecause we have been under such an insane time crunch (only 3 days left to buy the constitution), **some aspects of ConstitutionDAO have been more centralized than I had hoped.**\\n\\n**However, we can fix this with progressive decentralization over time.**\\n\\nWe can launch a governance token and move away from a multi-sig over time so we become truly decentralized. This will be voted on by the current core-contributors, and I think they will make the right call here and push towards more decentralization in the spirit of being a **decentralized** autonomous organization.\\n\\nAll of our **code** is public, however all of our **chats** are not. The core-contributors are working closely together at speed. Having these chats be publicly open is hard because we would have so much other noise to attend to from other people.\\n\\nHowever, the chats can be made **public and read-only** over time, so that anyone can see what is going on. This will be voted on by the current core-contributors, and I think they will make the right call here to allow the community to see the inner workings of the DAO.\\n\\nFurthermore, **we can create** **transparent mechanisms** **for allowing other interested community members to become a core-contributor**. I know it’s hard to become a core-contributor right now because everyone is extremely slammed -- unfortunately on-boarding requires a lot of time to invest with context sharing which ultimately slows us down.\\n\\nI know it’s hard to become a core contributor because **it was extremely hard to become one myself** -- and I was in the discord just hours after it launched -- a lot of internal politics is involved.\\n\\n**Unfortunately tech can’t solve people, but we can decentralize all the keys to power over time and truly become a DAO, and create transparent methods of on-boarding new members and true decentralized governance**.\\n\\nI truly believe in this effort. I think we’re all going to make it. **With your help.**\\n\\nMeme magic is incredibly powerful.\\n\\n**Let’s show the world what we can do.**\\n\\n**WAGBTC** (We’re **all** going to buy the Constitution)\",\"timestamp\":1637080482,\"title\":\"You can support Constitution DAO with NFT memes!\"},\"digest\":\"11GEU7lX5CXnxWHiYnoPLCeYA4RdNC8WvJK6U0N4K0o\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x679d87D8640e66778c3419D164998E720D7495f6\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hH-mS-dpTJvxc5ElR5xxXB9ldQ7wUOSX4Xf9WHmrc2k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"J5slI5ARcFvZSCtluMqXWPytEvshRdGEI5VowKtyF5U\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"DYV9h1T8M7KC3E2dRS8OS7IJvqRA87VvTmeQLUxcDIqwFDN61ISDr9TAHU8SrnwKx2PSBHx_OYBuenxypkl60g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2b2bd939eb6f4af90e9e27e095ea217de989801b4c6ba3dde773a53d52d07e925f88e8db6066651a0aa914e9f9d1e26ccf961bd69d2ed94be3bc277ae466981b1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hH-mS-dpTJvxc5ElR5xxXB9ldQ7wUOSX4Xf9WHmrc2k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"J5slI5ARcFvZSCtluMqXWPytEvshRdGEI5VowKtyF5U\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"U-pW_QsLb81IbRVCkOvWwMRggd16dYKsdBxpO0kea2E\"}"
