For National Geographic's \\\"Into Water\\\".](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qbM976d4kDNv74RJwbUig.jpg?height=4480&width=6720)\\n\\nWhen speaking with a colleague of mine about climate change, they said “[doom just doesn’t do it for me](https://www.ted.com/talks/tito_jankowski_take_carbon_out_of_the_air_and_make_useful_things_with_it)”. This resonated with me on an incredibly deep level. So much so that I decided to change the course of my career from traditional film production to telling future-focused stories surrounding climate change. I will be beginning this transition with a focus on carbon credits, carbon removal, and the idea of regenerative economies.\\n\\nThe most important theme of my work is accessibility. The carbon sequestration industry is a potential trillion dollar market opportunity, and (if you are science-minded), an absolutely essential direction we must move global policy, economics, and public values towards if we are to keep our planet within the 2 degrees threshold of catastrophic global warming.\\n\\nThe second most important theme of my work is positivity. In the spirit of “doom just doesn’t do it for me”, this series of articles will be hyper-focused on the most promising research and people enacting positive change in order to help guide public knowledge and values into a space in which we can dream about a beautiful future for generations to come.\\n\\n## The Project:\\n\\nThis is both a research and advocacy project designed to break down the carbon sequestration industry into accessible chapters and give the average person a roadmap and a robust understanding the industry and how to get involved. This will evolve into a pilot television episode in a series called Air Miners that is [currently in development](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R6xsJT8RCFe1t6L78GdXVHXbfIIdsiRLcxbHHj7Pwoo/edit?usp=sharing). We have an incredibly talented and experienced team currently working on this pilot project on both the research and production side. In 2022, you can expect from this project:\\n\\n* One in-depth article on current carbon sequestration research, projects, and policy each week of 2022.\\n* In-depth interviews and deep-dives with industry players and academics on the bleeding-edge of the carbon sequestration space.\\n* All-original, carbon offset NFTs (original photographs, and infographic animations) released within each article to support the project pilot.\\n* A crowdfunding campaign for development of the series Air Miners backed by NFT’s that include an ownership stake in the project.\\n\\nThis project has already begun, it is no small feat to put together in-depth accessible articles on an industry that is currently only accessible through academia, industry jargon, and vaguely worded political promises. During the next two months we are actively meeting industry players, researching and writing primers on as many elements of the carbon-sequestration industry as possible, creating original photography and animated NFT sets that will be used to fund the development of our television series [Air Miners](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R6xsJT8RCFe1t6L78GdXVHXbfIIdsiRLcxbHHj7Pwoo/edit?usp=sharing).\\n\\n### My Background:\\n\\nMy name is Steve Henderson, and I am a commercial, documentary, and branded content filmmaker. I came up over the last decade working in extreme environments for brands such as The North Face, Google, National Geographic, Thule, Red Bull, and countless blue-chip companies. You can learn a little bit about me and my previous work through my personal website [here](https://www.hendo.co), my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/steve.hendo), [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/hendocarbon), and my newest business venture [here](https://www.arcademotion.com/).\\n\\nI have been working in film for the past decade. First creating social justice documentaries on the North American asbestos industry which screened at the TIFF Bell Lightbox, to television series called The Polar Sea for TVO / ARTE Germany. Soon after, I transitioned to the action sports industry with a drive to tell stories of culture, athleticism, and of environmental respect. This led to the better part of my 20’s collaborating with incredible academics, storytellers, and people from all walks of life. Most recently I was the associate producer on the feature film [La Liste: Everything or Nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGOCcw3BO6E). I have placed photos from my career throughout the article as a way of introduction to a part of my work.\\n\\n![Riparian habitat in Poisson-Blanc Provincial Park, Quebec, Canada.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_NctOQUq8EYr_dgPb2iT7.jpg?height=3640&width=5464)\\n\\nI have had the incredible privilege and opportunity to tell stories from our planet’s most remote places. This has led me to Indonesia’s remote coral reefs, the glaciers of the Karakoram, Himalaya, Alps, Andes, Iceland, and the Rockies, and pristine coastal and rainforest ecosystems to name a few. They are wild places that showcase both the sublime nature and fragility of our planet.\\n\\n![Pakistan's mighty K2, in the Karakoram Range.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ly-iIBvnsTOQNIcfKHDel.jpg?height=3348&width=5000)\\n\\nOne thing that I can’t seem to step away from in my travels is our collective impact on these incredible environments. Fisheries disappearing, coral bleaching, glaciers melting, forests cut down, and waterway pollution are just some of the things that I have seen progress exponentially in just the last decade. It has been so striking to me that I realized that I have to do more than tell stories, I have to tell stories that inspire and push people to embrace the idea of a radical change into a regenerative or circular economy.\\n\\n![Spear fishing in remote Central Sulawesi, Indonesia for National Geographic's \\\"Into Water\\\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Yzze9T35MPTPsZaQJjrWq.jpg?height=590&width=1180)\\n\\nThe most exciting thing about this is that this **is not just an abstract idea**. There is incredible research being done, future focused companies leading the way, and many people making this a reality. Through cutting edge science, engineering, and most importantly conservation. Incredible success stories are waiting to be told and there are still not enough tangible action plans for people to latch on to and make differences in their own way.\\n\\nHere is to a 2022 commitment to drive these stories forward through in-depth research, collaboration, and putting out one in-depth article per week on decarbonizing our world, and help in some small way in our collective efforts to transition to the new carbon economy.\\n\\nSo please, join us, and help us bring a new suite of tools of climate action to an entirely new audience, and ignite the fire of possibility!\\n\\n> *All photography copyright Arcade Motion Inc.* \",\"timestamp\":1636323518,\"title\":\"Air Miners, an introduction:\"},\"digest\":\"AlDbjx4cdcWmyvfFMdvaGriB2UuEGNJnKmib4j-h-fw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2342F6fEFbAa4F3Bb64C60fa1DfA26126f79e34f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"WzLY_mwr1izrL8q29G-thTJPU-tuZ8KpsPcD1gVm6nE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Trk64ZptawFuKJ5ecaeQgQPfIhmvYnOjMCX1Bvar3Es\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"3wX7h7mJIVS5FXoerCcFWyJ_Wjd1pwU2E1FntyM1AWUwRIrYTYtoiMz8PtTLcMca4gDnn7Iees32bch3VDaThQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x71e1d90f65cc934e3ae49a92d67aee2f1c202da7eb1d32dd871077e6e8f06d18033549d891b890e28fcc8e93df40cfd3a72096a3915c9384549bbd2d418e2e731c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"WzLY_mwr1izrL8q29G-thTJPU-tuZ8KpsPcD1gVm6nE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Trk64ZptawFuKJ5ecaeQgQPfIhmvYnOjMCX1Bvar3Es\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"zgnmuV4whEgm6O0fVQquvLHTSmVzDQWDlcaFFj6kQOA\"}"
