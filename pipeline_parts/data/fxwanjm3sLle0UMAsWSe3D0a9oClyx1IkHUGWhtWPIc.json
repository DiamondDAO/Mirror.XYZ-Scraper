"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"On 25 November, New York Post reported that Metaverse Group, the NFT-based metaverse real estate company, which is a subsidiary of Tokens.com, bought a plot of ‘land’ on Decentraland for USD 2.43 million. This amount is more than double the previous record for the largest metaverse land acquisition.\\n\\nOn 15 November, Coindesk reported that Barbados signed an agreement with Decentraland to establish its virtual embassy on the platform in January 2022, becoming the first country to do so.\\n\\n……\\n\\nSo many news reports are telling us that you can’t ignore this game.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*F4ibTT0mvC0zwAUn)\\n\\nDecentraland is a metaverse built on the Ethereum blockchain, it is a decentralized virtual world software where virtual plots of lands can be bought and sold. People can create their own micro-worlds with virtual trees, aircraft on much more than 90,000 parcels of land. Decentraland can provide all kinds of users with space to experience and create in this world, and every user can find his own position there.\\n\\n## Decentraland: Gameplay\\n\\nDecentraland designed a completely free virtual world with very high degrees of freedom.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*X01IUzJZlhjq5HKA)\\n\\nAs described in their whitepaper, as a content developer, you can design all kinds of things in it, such as building a casino, building an amusement park, designing a house, even an aquarium and shopping mall. Only what you didn’t expect can be created in this virtual reality world.\\n\\nPeople who have played the game know that the equipment in the game needs to be bought, and so does Decentraland. For example, they must buy land, concert tickets, and even chips for reading blogs. When you want to buy, you must use the most important token of Decentraland: MANA\\n\\n## Decentraland Coin\\n\\nLike Axie Infinity (AXS), Decentraland also has a native token (MANA) that is used for various purposes within the Decentraland ecosystem.\\n\\nThere are two digital assets: LAND, the non-fungible parcels in which the virtual world is divided; and MANA, an ERC-20 token that is burned to claim LAND, as well as to make in-world purchases of goods and services.\\n\\n## Earning Money With Decentraland\\n\\n## Buy Land\\n\\nYou can purchase land through an intermediary NFT exchange such as Opensea or right at Decentraland’s marketplace. Both options will cost you MANA, which you can buy using Bitcoins on any exchange where the token is available.\\n\\nAfter that, it’s all about building environments like casinos, art galleries, and games where people can interact.\\n\\n## Selling Decentraland Properties\\n\\nThese include your land, estates, wearables, and unique names. Here’s how you can go about this process:\\n\\nIt allows you to purchase MANA using BTC easily and participate in online gaming action on Blackjack and Roulette tables and Slots.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*L6-Abuajxy6QcXRv)\\n\\n## Referral Rewards $40\\n\\nAs an affiliate, you can get DG tokens by referring new players.\\n\\n## Governance Bonus\\n\\nLocking your DG in the company’s governance contract will also earn you additional tokens.\\n\\n## Conclusion & Outlook: Promising\\n\\nDecentraland, as one of the first metaverse games developed in Ethereum, has a good preemptive advantage.\\n\\nHowever, this “land” also provides many restrictions for the development of Decentraland.\\n\\nThe first is the huge operation and technology costs. There is still a certain gap between Decentraland’s current game experience and the virtual world games under the chain.\\n\\nLaggings and bugs still exist in the game, and the metaverse construction is also in the preliminary stage. There is still a long way to go before becoming a real “metaverse world”, and there are still many technical problems to be solved.\",\"timestamp\":1642489825,\"title\":\"Virtual Real Estate Series 2: Decentraland\"},\"digest\":\"HaU1TV8NbioP0XFKvlcSUsOxWCM32OXp0VyLNacDH-c\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2cDc9360D38e50407613e858a9b950964430C8c0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Z_zk4oGtXZtdUSmXGrsdGpMxao-RFxhY4rxq7zTn6Ts\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"G0HPBM6fbBvUNrR-bWYV40n3uWz79RF8JxYy9gy8pbY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"dyR8dngWMq3layi40asb44I0pQMcxJKGQSTguw0vlVyRR0be9e35zyA5chcb1GRkm3pKyFxo9iCLM_gxNMy3Cw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x84b6806b234a313f40c71de67220b235d62776b6e482ee56a5ccef71a42b213b77175639dd858a6a5b127604473768fadadfba37ae4c1bb33adc410c642cd2bf1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Z_zk4oGtXZtdUSmXGrsdGpMxao-RFxhY4rxq7zTn6Ts\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"G0HPBM6fbBvUNrR-bWYV40n3uWz79RF8JxYy9gy8pbY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"HaU1TV8NbioP0XFKvlcSUsOxWCM32OXp0VyLNacDH-c\"}"
