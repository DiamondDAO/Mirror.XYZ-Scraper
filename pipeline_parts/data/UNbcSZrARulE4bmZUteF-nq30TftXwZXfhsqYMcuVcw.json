"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Join the PolkaWorld community and build Web 3.0 together!\\n\\nWhen Gavin Wood joined the team led by Vitalik Buterin to build the better blockchain they envisioned, Bitcoin was the dominant blockchain in the world.\\n\\nButerin, Gavin, and six other co-founders see Ethereum, which was launched in 2014, as a broader ecosystem. Users can create and exchange services and products, including smart contracts that bring NFTs. Gavin described the goal they were trying to achieve as the \\\"world computer.\\\"\\n\\nThis vision is not suitable for loyal Bitcoin users.\\n\\n\\\"There was a lot of Bitcoin extremism, and it still exists,\\\" Gavin told Protocol. \\\"This has resulted in a very harmful environment. We are trying to push the cryptocurrency blockchain technology forward. We have no malice against Bitcoin. We are just technologists. But we get a lot of \\\"hatred\\\" from the Bitcoin world, a lot of Unnecessary, unreasonable suspicion, and sometimes worse. It’s almost like an encrypted version of nationalism.”\\n\\nEthereum eventually became the second most used blockchain in the world after Bitcoin. Ethereum now has a market value of more than 330 billion U.S. dollars.\\n\\nBut in 2015, Gavin left Ethereum and founded a blockchain software development company called Parity Technologies with Jutta Steiner, the former security director of the Ethereum Foundation, a PhD in mathematics. Two years later, he co-founded the Web3 Foundation, which provides funding for teams focused on decentralized network technology.\\n\\nPart of the reason Gavin left is because he believes that Ethereum has not done enough to pursue blockchain technology, a truly decentralized ecosystem. It has become another network competing for dominance in the increasingly crowded blockchain world.\\n\\nIt is also being affected by the \\\"crypto extremism\\\" Gavin encountered when he helped launch Ethereum. \\\"There are already Ethereum extremists,\\\" Gavin said. \\\"You will realize, oh, maybe this is part of human nature, and you can't get rid of it.\\\"\\n\\nBut Gavin wants to get rid of the \\\"territory mentality\\\" of this blockchain, or at least \\\"alleviate it by having the ability to have multiple chains.\\\"\\n\\nThis is the vision of Polkadot launched in May 2020 by Gavin and two co-founders Robert Habermeier and Peter Czaban with the support of the Parity and Web3 Foundation. For Wood, this is an opportunity to start from scratch.\\n\\nHe said in a video: \\\"We have been thinking about how we can create the next generation of Ethereum if we have a \\\"green field\\\" that can be designed.\\\"\\n\\nPolkadot hopes to create a new multi-chain ecosystem that serves as a bridge connecting other blockchains, and abandons what Gavin calls \\\"a patchwork of Internet independent and isolated legal systems.\\\"\\n\\nPolkadot has just started, but there is no doubt that Gavin's reputation and position as a pioneer in the blockchain have promoted it. The dot token is now the 9th largest token in the world with a market value of more than 25 billion U.S. dollars.\\n\\nIn an interview with Protocol, Gavin talked about his journey from Ethereum to Polkadot, his vision for the third iteration of the network and his belief that encryption and blockchain technology will prevail because \\\"technology has changed human civilization. And it won't stop now.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1634228201,\"title\":\"Breaking Nationalism in the Crypto World (Gavin Wood)\"},\"digest\":\"Wv6yEwmhYvFdwoCbwXBmHVNB3P_j69WRaOhYY9RhrSg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xe6b93ce05c592AE5A51256C31e39E70d0757C94A\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LjwBZvtRWwNXIrOY3YI0w1oc1k00LfrD7qdS_Pof0-8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"b9xlXdd7vqCEgj7sQeDWmnSaxki1HEtn6CPCWXdGsns\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"6bu-lr_0cBG3MeqwV9NX9LOidXwLZftF6tPJe9WbbImAe6q0x7qEExj-5y2REImSOVhXhBU3Gx33mt7xueiqew\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xedebde5e453704861a4c625ddbad72f99eda394d3a86d8d28c6dfd360dc73d3d026979386b83e5b40e1c6f8413030b6d40c3586375de7c5bbbcc26ff8f7a03a31c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LjwBZvtRWwNXIrOY3YI0w1oc1k00LfrD7qdS_Pof0-8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"b9xlXdd7vqCEgj7sQeDWmnSaxki1HEtn6CPCWXdGsns\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Wv6yEwmhYvFdwoCbwXBmHVNB3P_j69WRaOhYY9RhrSg\"}"
