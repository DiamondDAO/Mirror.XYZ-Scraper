quite the other way,\\nI have to go to bed by day.\\n\\nI have to go to bed and see\\nThe birds still hopping on the tree,\\nOr hear the grown-up people's feet\\nStill going past me in the street.\\n\\nAnd does it not seem hard to you,\\nWhen all the sky is clear and blue,\\nAnd I should like so much to play,\\nTo have to go to bed by day?\\n\\n```\\n                                      II\\n                                   A Thought\\n```\\n\\nIt is very nice to think\\nThe world is full of meat and drink,\\nWith little children saying grace\\nIn every Christian kind of place.\\n\\n```\\n                                      III\\n                                At the Sea-side\\n```\\n\\nWhen I was down beside the sea\\nA wooden spade they gave to me\\nTo dig the sandy shore.\\n\\nMy holes were empty like a cup.\\nIn every hole the sea came up,\\nTill it could come no more.\\n\\n```\\n                                      IV\\n                              Young Night-Thought\\n```\\n\\nAll night long and every night,\\nWhen my mama puts out the light,\\nI see the people marching by,\\nAs plain as day before my eye.\\n\\nArmies and emperor and kings,\\nAll carrying different kinds of things,\\nAnd marching in so grand a way,\\nYou never saw the like by day.\\n\\nSo fine a show was never seen\\nAt the great circus on the green;\\nFor every kind of beast and man\\nIs marching in that caravan.\\n\\nAs first they move a little slow,\\nBut still the faster on they go,\\nAnd still beside me close I keep\\nUntil we reach the town of Sleep.\\n\\n```\\n                                       V\\n                            Whole Duty of Children\\n```\\n\\nA child should always say what's true\\nAnd speak when he is spoken to,\\nAnd behave mannerly at table;\\nAt least as far as he is able.\\n\\n```\\n                                      VI\\n                                     Rain\\n```\\n\\nThe rain is falling all around,\\nIt falls on field and tree,\\nIt rains on the umbrellas here,\\nAnd on the ships at sea.\\n\\n```\\n                                      VII\\n                                 Pirate Story\\n```\\n\\nThree of us afloat in the meadow by the swing,\\nThree of us abroad in the basket on the lea.\\nWinds are in the air, they are blowing in the spring,\\nAnd waves are on the meadow like the waves there are at sea.\\n\\nWhere shall we adventure, to-day that we're afloat,\\nWary of the weather and steering by a star?\\nShall it be to Africa, a-steering of the boat,\\nTo Providence, or Babylon or off to Malabar?\\n\\nHi!  but here's a squadron a-rowing on the sea--\\nCattle on the meadow a-charging with a roar!\\nQuick, and we'll escape them, they're as mad as they can be,\\nThe wicket is the harbour and the garden is the shore.\\n\\n```\\n                                     VIII\\n                                 Foreign Lands\\n```\\n\\nUp into the cherry tree\\nWho should climb but little me?\\nI held the trunk with both my hands\\nAnd looked abroad in foreign lands.\\n\\nI saw the next door garden lie,\\nAdorned with flowers, before my eye,\\nAnd many pleasant places more\\nThat I had never seen before.\\n\\nI saw the dimpling river pass\\nAnd be the sky's blue looking-glass;\\nThe dusty roads go up and down\\nWith people tramping in to town.\\n\\nIf I could find a higher tree\\nFarther and farther I should see,\\nTo where the grown-up river slips\\nInto the sea among the ships,\\n\\nTo where the road on either hand\\nLead onward into fairy land,\\nWhere all the children dine at five,\\nAnd all the playthings come alive.\\n\\n```\\n                                      IX\\n                                 Windy Nights\\n```\\n\\nWhenever the moon and stars are set,\\nWhenever the wind is high,\\nAll night long in the dark and wet,\\nA man goes riding by.\\nLate in the night when the fires are out,\\nWhy does he gallop and gallop about?\\n\\nWhenever the trees are crying aloud,\\nAnd ships are tossed at sea,\\nBy, on the highway, low and loud,\\nBy at the gallop goes he.\\nBy at the gallop he goes, and then\\nBy he comes back at the gallop again.\\n\\n```\\n                                       X\\n                                    Travel\\n```\\n\\nI should like to rise and go\\nWhere the golden apples grow;--\\nWhere below another sky\\nParrot islands anchored lie,\\nAnd, watched by cockatoos and goats,\\nLonely Crusoes building boats;--\\nWhere in sunshine reaching out\\nEastern cities, miles about,\\nAre with mosque and minaret\\nAmong sandy gardens set,\\nAnd the rich goods from near and far\\nHang for sale in the bazaar;--\\nWhere the Great Wall round China goes,\\nAnd on one side the desert blows,\\nAnd with the voice and bell and drum,\\nCities on the other hum;--\\nWhere are forests hot as fire,\\nWide as England, tall as a spire,\\nFull of apes and cocoa-nuts\\nAnd the negro hunters' huts;--\\nWhere the knotty crocodile\\nLies and blinks in the Nile,\\nAnd the red flamingo flies\\nHunting fish before his eyes;--\\nWhere in jungles near and far,\\nMan-devouring tigers are,\\nLying close and giving ear\\nLest the hunt be drawing near,\\nOr a comer-by be seen\\nSwinging in the palanquin;--\\nWhere among the desert sands\\nSome deserted city stands,\\nAll its children, sweep and prince,\\nGrown to manhood ages since,\\nNot a foot in street or house,\\nNot a stir of child or mouse,\\nAnd when kindly falls the night,\\nIn all the town no spark of light.\\nThere I'll come when I'm a man\\nWith a camel caravan;\\nLight a fire in the gloom\\nOf some dusty dining-room;\\nSee the pictures on the walls,\\nHeroes fights and festivals;\\nAnd in a corner find the toys\\nOf the old Egyptian boys.\\n\\n```\\n                                      XI\\n                                    Singing\\n```\\n\\nOf speckled eggs the birdie sings\\nAnd nests among the trees;\\nThe sailor sings of ropes and things\\nIn ships upon the seas.\\n\\nThe children sing in far Japan,\\nThe children sing in Spain;\\nThe organ with the organ man\\nIs singing in the rain.\\n\\n```\\n                                      XII\\n                                Looking Forward\\n```\\n\\nWhen I am grown to man's estate\\nI shall be very proud and great,\\nAnd tell the other girls and boys\\nNot to meddle with my toys.\\n\\n```\\n                                     XIII\\n                                  A Good Play\\n```\\n\\nWe built a ship upon the stairs\\nAll made of the back-bedroom chairs,\\nAnd filled it full of soft pillows\\nTo go a-sailing on the billows.\\n\\nWe took a saw and several nails,\\nAnd water in the nursery pails;\\nAnd Tom said, \\\"Let us also take\\nAn apple and a slice of cake;\\\"--\\nWhich was enough for Tom and me\\nTo go a-sailing on, till tea.\\n\\nWe sailed along for days and days,\\nAnd had the very best of plays;\\nBut Tom fell out and hurt his knee,\\nSo there was no one left but me.\\n\\n```\\n                                      XIV\\n                              Where Go the Boats?\\n```\\n\\nDark brown is the river,\\nGolden is the sand.\\nIt flows along for ever,\\nWith trees on either hand.\\n\\nGreen leaves a-floating,\\nCastles of the foam,\\nBoats of mine a-boating--\\nWhere will all come home?\\n\\nOn goes the river\\nAnd out past the mill,\\nAway down the valley,\\nAway down the hill.\\n\\nAway down the river,\\nA hundred miles or more,\\nOther little children\\nShall bring my boats ashore.\\n\\n```\\n                                      XV\\n                                Auntie's Skirts\\n```\\n\\nWhenever Auntie moves around,\\nHer dresses make a curious sound,\\nThey trail behind her up the floor,\\nAnd trundle after through the door.\\n\\n```\\n                                      XVI\\n                            The Land of Counterpane\\n```\\n\\nWhen I was sick and lay a-bed,\\nI had two pillows at my head,\\nAnd all my toys beside me lay,\\nTo keep me happy all the day.\\n\\nAnd sometimes for an hour or so\\nI watched my leaden soldiers go,\\nWith different uniforms and drills,\\nAmong the bed-clothes, through the hills;\\n\\nAnd sometimes sent my ships in fleets\\nAll up and down among the sheets;\\nOr brought my trees and houses out,\\nAnd planted cities all about.\\n\\nI was the giant great and still\\nThat sits upon the pillow-hill,\\nAnd sees before him, dale and plain,\\nThe pleasant land of counterpane.\\n\\n```\\n                                     XVII\\n                                The Land of Nod\\n```\\n\\nFrom breakfast on through all the day\\nAt home among my friends I stay,\\nBut every night I go abroad\\nAfar into the land of Nod.\\n\\nAll by myself I have to go,\\nWith none to tell me what to do--\\nAll alone beside the streams\\nAnd up the mountain-sides of dreams.\\n\\nThe strangest things are these for me,\\nBoth things to eat and things to see,\\nAnd many frightening sights abroad\\nTill morning in the land of Nod.\\n\\nTry as I like to find the way,\\nI never can get back by day,\\nNor can remember plain and clear\\nThe curious music that I hear.\\n\\n```\\n                                     XVIII\\n                                   My Shadow\\n```\\n\\nI have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,\\nAnd what can be the use of him is more than I can see.\\nHe is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;\\nAnd I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.\\n\\nThe funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow--\\nNot at all like proper children, which is always very slow;\\nFor he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,\\nAnd he sometimes goes so little that there's none of him at all.\\n\\nHe hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,\\nAnd can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.\\nHe stays so close behind me, he's a coward you can see;\\nI'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!\\n\\nOne morning, very early, before the sun was up,\\nI rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;\\nBut my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,\\nHad stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.\\n\\n```\\n                                      XIX\\n                                    System\\n```\\n\\nEvery night my prayers I say,\\nAnd get my dinner every day;\\nAnd every day that I've been good,\\nI get an orange after food.\\n\\nThe child that is not clean and neat,\\nWith lots of toys and things to eat,\\nHe is a naughty child, I'm sure--\\nOr else his dear papa is poor.\\n\\n```\\n                                      XX\\n                                  A Good Boy\\n```\\n\\nI woke before the morning, I was happy all the day,\\nI never said an ugly word, but smiled and stuck to play.\\n\\nAnd now at last the sun is going down behind the wood,\\nAnd I am very happy, for I know that I've been good.\\n\\nMy bed is waiting cool and fresh, with linen smooth and fair,\\nAnd I must be off to sleepsin-by, and not forget my prayer.\\n\\nI know that, till to-morrow I shall see the sun arise,\\nNo ugly dream shall fright my mind, no ugly sight my eyes.\\n\\nBut slumber hold me tightly till I waken in the dawn,\\nAnd hear the thrushes singing in the lilacs round the lawn.\\n\\n```\\n                                      XXI\\n                               Escape at Bedtime\\n```\\n\\nThe lights from the parlour and kitchen shone out\\nThrough the blinds and the windows and bars;\\nAnd high overhead and all moving about,\\nThere were thousands of millions of stars.\\nThere ne'er were such thousands of leaves on a tree,\\nNor of people in church or the Park,\\nAs the crowds of the stars that looked down upon me,\\nAnd that glittered and winked in the dark.\\n\\nThe Dog, and the Plough, and the Hunter, and all,\\nAnd the star of the sailor, and Mars,\\nThese shown in the sky, and the pail by the wall\\nWould be half full of water and stars.\\nThey saw me at last, and they chased me with cries,\\nAnd they soon had me packed into bed;\\nBut the glory kept shining and bright in my eyes,\\nAnd the stars going round in my head.\\n\\n```\\n                                     XXII\\n                                 Marching Song\\n```\\n\\nBring the comb and play upon it!\\nMarching, here we come!\\nWillie cocks his highland bonnet,\\nJohnnie beats the drum.\\n\\nMary Jane commands the party,\\nPeter leads the rear;\\nFeet in time, alert and hearty,\\nEach a Grenadier!\\n\\nAll in the most martial manner\\nMarching double-quick;\\nWhile the napkin, like a banner,\\nWaves upon the stick!\\n\\nHere's enough of fame and pillage,\\nGreat commander Jane!\\nNow that we've been round the village,\\nLet's go home again.\\n\\n```\\n                                     XXIII\\n                                    The Cow\\n```\\n\\nThe friendly cow all red and white,\\nI love with all my heart:\\nShe gives me cream with all her might,\\nTo eat with apple-tart.\\n\\nShe wanders lowing here and there,\\nAnd yet she cannot stray,\\nAll in the pleasant open air,\\nThe pleasant light of day;\\n\\nAnd blown by all the winds that pass\\nAnd wet with all the showers,\\nShe walks among the meadow grass\\nAnd eats the meadow flowers.\\n\\n```\\n                                     XXIV\\n                                 Happy Thought\\n```\\n\\nThe world is so full of a number of things,\\nI'm sure we should all be as happy as kings.\\n\\n```\\n                                      XXV\\n                                   The Wind\\n```\\n\\nI saw you toss the kites on high\\nAnd blow the birds about the sky;\\nAnd all around I heard you pass,\\nLike ladies' skirts across the grass--\\nO wind, a-blowing all day long,\\nO wind, that sings so loud a song!\\n\\nI saw the different things you did,\\nBut always you yourself you hid.\\nI felt you push, I heard you call,\\nI could not see yourself at all--\\nO wind, a-blowing all day long,\\nO wind, that sings so loud a song!\\n\\nO you that are so strong and cold,\\nO blower, are you young or old?\\nAre you a beast of field and tree,\\nOr just a stronger child than me?\\nO wind, a-blowing all day long,\\nO wind, that sings so loud a song!\\n\\n```\\n                                     XXVI\\n                                 Keepsake Mill\\n```\\n\\nOver the borders, a sin without pardon,\\nBreaking the branches and crawling below,\\nOut through the breach in the wall of the garden,\\nDown by the banks of the river we go.\\n\\nHere is a mill with the humming of thunder,\\nHere is the weir with the wonder of foam,\\nHere is the sluice with the race running under--\\nMarvellous places, though handy to home!\\n\\nSounds of the village grow stiller and stiller,\\nStiller the note of the birds on the hill;\\nDusty and dim are the eyes of the miller,\\nDeaf are his ears with the moil of the mill.\\n\\nYears may go by, and the wheel in the river\\nWheel as it wheels for us, children, to-day,\\nWheel and keep roaring and foaming for ever\\nLong after all of the boys are away.\\n\\nHome for the Indies and home from the ocean,\\nHeroes and soldiers we all will come home;\\nStill we shall find the old mill wheel in motion,\\nTurning and churning that river to foam.\\n\\nYou with the bean that I gave when we quarrelled,\\nI with your marble of Saturday last,\\nHonoured and old and all gaily apparelled,\\nHere we shall meet and remember the past.\\n\\n```\\n                                     XXVII\\n                             Good and Bad Children\\n```\\n\\nChildren, you are very little,\\nAnd your bones are very brittle;\\nIf you would grow great and stately,\\nYou must try to walk sedately.\\n\\nYou must still be bright and quiet,\\nAnd content with simple diet;\\nAnd remain, through all bewild'ring,\\nInnocent and honest children.\\n\\nHappy hearts and happy faces,\\nHappy play in grassy places--\\nThat was how in ancient ages,\\nChildren grew to kings and sages.\\n\\nBut the unkind and the unruly,\\nAnd the sort who eat unduly,\\nThey must never hope for glory--\\nTheirs is quite a different story!\\n\\nCruel children, crying babies,\\nAll grow up as geese and gabies,\\nHated, as their age increases,\\nBy their nephews and their nieces.\\n\\n```\\n                                    XXVIII\\n                               Foreign Children\\n```\\n\\nLittle Indian, Sioux, or Crow,\\nLittle frosty Eskimo,\\nLittle Turk or Japanee,\\nOh! don't you wish that you were me?\\n\\nYou have seen the scarlet trees\\nAnd the lions over seas;\\nYou have eaten ostrich eggs,\\nAnd turned the turtle off their legs.\\n\\nSuch a life is very fine,\\nBut it's not so nice as mine:\\nYou must often as you trod,\\nHave wearied NOT to be abroad.\\n\\nYou have curious things to eat,\\nI am fed on proper meat;\\nYou must dwell upon the foam,\\nBut I am safe and live at home.\\nLittle Indian, Sioux or Crow,\\nLittle frosty Eskimo,\\nLittle Turk or Japanee,\\nOh! don't you wish that you were me?\\n\\n```\\n                                     XXIX\\n                                The Sun Travels\\n```\\n\\nThe sun is not a-bed, when I\\nAt night upon my pillow lie;\\nStill round the earth his way he takes,\\nAnd morning after morning makes.\\n\\nWhile here at home, in shining day,\\nWe round the sunny garden play,\\nEach little Indian sleepy-head\\nIs being kissed and put to bed.\\n\\nAnd when at eve I rise form tea,\\nDay dawns beyond the Atlantic Sea;\\nAnd all the children in the west\\nAre getting up and being dressed.\\n\\n```\\n                                      XXX\\n                                The Lamplighter\\n```\\n\\nMy tea is nearly ready and the sun has left the sky.\\nIt's time to take the window to see Leerie going by;\\nFor every night at teatime and before you take your seat,\\nWith lantern and with ladder he comes posting up the street.\\n\\nNow Tom would be a driver and Maria go to sea,\\nAnd my papa's a banker and as rich as he can be;\\nBut I, when I am stronger and can choose what I'm to do,\\nO Leerie, I'll go round at night and light the lamps with you!\\n\\nFor we are very lucky, with a lamp before the door,\\nAnd Leerie stops to light it as he lights so many more;\\nAnd oh! before you hurry by with ladder and with light;\\nO Leerie, see a little child and nod to him to-night!\\n\\n```\\n                                     XXXI\\n                               My Bed is a Boat\\n```\\n\\nMy bed is like a little boat;\\nNurse helps me in when I embark;\\nShe girds me in my sailor's coat\\nAnd starts me in the

ships,\\nSail about on tiny trips;\\nAnd above the Daisy tree\\nThrough the grasses,\\nHigh o'erhead the Bumble Bee\\nHums and passes.\\n\\nIn that forest to and fro\\nI can wander, I can go;\\nSee the spider and the fly,\\nAnd the ants go marching by,\\nCarrying parcels with their feet\\nDown the green and grassy street.\\nI can in the sorrel sit\\nWhere the ladybird alit.\\nI can climb the jointed grass\\nAnd on high\\nSee the greater swallows pass\\nIn the sky,\\nAnd the round sun rolling by\\nHeeding no such things as I.\\n\\nThrough that forest I can pass\\nTill, as in a looking-glass,\\nHumming fly and daisy tree\\nAnd my tiny self I see,\\nPainted very clear and neat\\nOn the rain-pool at my feet.\\nShould a leaflet come to land\\nDrifting near to where I stand,\\nStraight I'll board that tiny boat\\nRound the rain-pool sea to float.\\n\\nLittle thoughtful creatures sit\\nOn the grassy coasts of it;\\nLittle things with lovely eyes\\nSee me sailing with surprise.\\nSome are clad in armour green--\\n(These have sure to battle been!)--\\nSome are pied with ev'ry hue,\\nBlack and crimson, gold and blue;\\nSome have wings and swift are gone;--\\nBut

and serious, brown and big.\\n\\nHe digs the flowers, green, red, and blue,\\nNor wishes to be spoken to.\\nHe digs the flowers and cuts the hay,\\nAnd never seems to want to play.\\n\\nSilly gardener! summer goes,\\nAnd winter comes with pinching toes,\\nWhen in the garden bare and brown\\nYou must lay your barrow down.\\n\\nWell now, and while the summer stays,\\nTo profit by these garden days\\nO how much wiser you would be\\nTo play at Indian wars with me!\\n\\n```\\n                                     VIII\\n                            Historical Associations\\n```\\n\\nDear

march ahead,\\nFor this is that enchanted ground\\nWhere all who loiter slumber sound.\\n\\nHere is the sea, here is the sand,\\nHere is the simple Shepherd's Land,\\nHere are the fairy hollyhocks,\\nAnd there are Ali Baba's rocks.\\nBut yonder, see! apart and high,\\nFrozen Siberia lies; where I,\\nWith Robert Bruce William Tell,\\nWas bound by an enchanter's spell.\\n\\n```\\n

Minnie\\n```\\n\\nThe red room with the giant bed\\nWhere none but elders laid their head;\\nThe little room where you and I\\nDid for awhile together lie\\nAnd, simple, suitor, I your hand\\nIn decent marriage did demand;\\nThe great day nursery, best of all,\\nWith pictures pasted on the wall\\nAnd leaves upon the blind--\\nA pleasant room wherein to wake\\nAnd hear the leafy garden shake\\nAnd rustle in the wind--\\nAnd pleasant there to lie in bed\\nAnd see the pictures overhead--\\nThe wars about Sebastopol,\\nThe grinning guns along the wall,\\nThe daring escalade,\\nThe plunging ships, the bleating sheep,\\nThe happy children ankle-deep\\nAnd laughing as they wade:\\nAll these are vanished clean away,\\nAnd the old manse is changed to-day;\\nIt wears an altered face\\nAnd shields a stranger race.\\nThe river, on from mill to mill,\\nFlows past our childhood's garden still;\\nBut ah! we children never more\\nShall watch it from the water-door!\\nBelow the yew--it still is there--\\nOur phantom voices haunt the air\\nAs we were still at play,\\nAnd I can hear them call and say:\\n\\\"How far is it to Babylon?\\\"\\n\\nAh, far enough, my dear,\\nFar, far enough from here--\\nSmiling and kind, you grace a shelf\\nToo high for me to reach myself.\\nReach down a hand, my dear, and take\\nThese rhymes for old acquaintance' sake!\\nYet you have farther gone!\\n\\\"Can I get there by candlelight?\\\"\\nSo goes the old refrain.\\nI do not know--perchance you might--\\nBut only, children, hear it right,\\nAh, never to return again!\\nThe eternal dawn, beyond a doubt,\\nShall break on hill and plain,\\nAnd put all stars and candles out\\nEre we be young again.\\n\\nTo you in distant India, these\\nI send across the seas,\\nNor count it far across.\\nFor which of us forget\\nThe Indian cabinets,\\nThe bones of antelope, the wings of albatross,\\nThe pied and painted birds and beans,\\nThe junks and bangles, beads and screens,\\nThe gods and sacred bells,\\nAnd the load-humming, twisted shells!\\nThe level of the parlour floor\\nWas honest, homely, Scottish shore;\\nBut when we climbed upon a chair,\\nBehold the gorgeous East was there!\\nBe this a fable; and behold\\nMe in the parlour as of old,\\nAnd Minnie just above me set\\nIn the quaint Indian cabinet!\\n\\n```\\n                                       V\\n

read.\\nThen you shall discover, that your name was printed down\\nBy the English printers, long before, in London town.\\n\\nIn the great and busy city where the East and West are met,\\nAll the little letters did the English printer set;\\nWhile you thought of nothing, and were still too young to play,\\nForeign people thought of you in places far away.\\n\\nAy, and when you slept, a baby, over all the English lands\\nOther little children took the volume in their hands;\\nOther children questioned, in their homes across the seas:\\nWho was little Louis, won't you tell us, mother, please?\\n\\n```\\n                                       2\\n```\\n\\nNow that you have spelt your lesson, lay it down and go and play,\\nSeeking shells and seaweed on the sands of Monterey,\\nWatching all the mighty whalebones, lying buried by the breeze,\\nTiny sandpipers, and the huge Pacific seas.\\n\\nAnd remember in your playing, as the sea-fog rolls to you,\\nLong ere you could read it, how I told you what to do;\\nAnd that while you thought of no one, nearly half the world away\\nSome one thought of Louis on the beach of Monterey!\\n\\n```\\n
