"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## JapaneseDecade\\n\\nIt is January 2032, and we are in \\\"backward\\\" Japan.\\n\\nDue to the economic, IT, and educational disparities that had been growing rapidly for the past ten years, the number of disgruntled citizens had increased massively, and the security situation in the country had deteriorated.\\n\\nTen years ago, in 2022, Japan was so focused on defending its vested interests that it was unable to respond to the then global trends of \\\"Web3\\\" and \\\"crypto\\\".\\n\\nAfter this period, Japan's economy and large corporations lost their centripetal force, and many talented people and capitalists went overseas. \\n At the same time, a weak Japanese yen became common place, so the Japanese economy got weaker. \\n Unemployment and poverty have become \\\"familiar\\\" problems for many people in the past decade.\\n\\nNaturally, the masses lived in a constant state of dissatisfaction and depression. \\n They have managed to endure 10 years on the sinking ship, but the situation in Japan has only gotten worse, not better.\\n\\nThey have finally reached their limit.\\n\\nThey come to express their frustration in each part of the country despite having “strong patience\\\" like a SAMURAI.\\n\\nTheir anger is directed at \\\"cryptocurrency,\\\" which grew rapidly a decade ago when inequality began to widen, and by extension, at \\\"those who have increased their assets enormously by investing in cryptocurrencies. \\n Those who surface their dissatisfaction shout out the following arguments at the top of their lungs:\\n\\n* ”Crypto assets have no substance, they're just garbage”\\n* ”The NFT epidemic is a media conspiracy”\\n* \\\"It's inappropriate to make money from P2E\\\"\\n* ”Work diligently!”\\n\\nThey say this despite the fact that bitcoin has been the world's most popular asset to replace gold since it reached a price of 1 BTC per million dollars in 2027. \\n \\\\*1ETH/$100,000\\n\\nTheir negative feelings about cryptocurrency become more and more heated, and there are more hate speeches against cryptocurrency holders across Japan. \\n In addition to that, children of the holders are bullied by other children, and the cases where the holders are abused by being named with ridiculous nicknames: “cheater”, “dog”, “ape”, and “sushi” on social media.\\n\\nJapanese government that sees these things seriously aims three goals and determines to make urgent policies.\\n\\n* Eradication of discrimination against those who possess cryptocurrency\\n* Change of the impression toward cryptocurrency as clean and good\\n* Formation of the culture and framework of cryptocurrency familiar with all generations andall people who are not IT literate\\n\\nThe government is under pressure that these goals should be achieved, or Japan will be disrupted.\\n\\nThe government creates a solution by securing a large budget. \\n Their solution is\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\\"embodiment of crypto assets”(!)\\n\\nSpecifically, crypto asset holders residing in Japan will have to submit an application (on paper only, of course) to convert all of their tokens into real tokens: coins.\\n\\nBy sending the token to an address managed by a country dedicated to embodiment, the token will be embodied in the real world. \\n The government thinks shaped cryptocurrency like the legal currency will lower the hurdles of people who don't like digital currency and don't have high Digital literacy.\\n\\nThose who violate this law are punished by imprisonment of up to 5 years or a fine of up to 500,000 yen.\\n\\nSurprisingly, the outrageous technological development of embodying tokens in the real world has been going on in secret since May 2011.\\n\\nEveryone in the world is shocked by its technological prowess and ideas, but the policy itself collects a lot of bashing.\\n\\nThat is natural.\\n\\nDespite feeling the cold glare from abroad, the government put public sentiment first and let this law go into effect.\\n\\nPeople familiar with cryptos in Japan had completely given up. \\n However, they must have felt that they had no choice but to do so, hoping that the oppression against them would stop now.\\n\\nMany intellectuals judge the scenario of the disruption of Japan is determined by the enforcement of this law.\\n\\nUntil the “bugs” of embodied tokens come up to the surface on the date of the Token embodiment Law enforcement.\\n\\n## TalkingToken\\n\\nOn September 1, 2032, the “Token embodiment Law” is enforced.\\n\\nThe bug occurred early in the day, resulting in a total of 25 similar incidents being identified that day alone.\\n\\nThe first bug is happened in Minato Ward, Tokyo.\\n\\nA Vitalik devotee in his 40s has seen a change in his embodied token holdings. \\n The token he held, ETH, was transformed from a coin into a \\\"human form\\\"!\\n\\nIt was \\\"humanoid,\\\" or almost human, as far as I could tell. \\n She was probably in middle or high school, a girl. \\n And to my surprise, she was vocal, emotional, and able to communicate.\\n\\nShe was strangely calm and actively communicated with me. \\n She then called herself \\\"Ether\\\".\\n\\nHe was just stunned by the appearance of the girl before him.\\n\\nHe had exchanged a few words with her at this point, but the man could barely remember the conversation.\\n\\nA few minutes later, the man finally calmed down a little and tried to recognize the situation. \\n Then he asked the girl who called herself \\\"Ether\\\".\\n\\n\\\"...Where the hell did you come from?\\\"\\n\\nAt that moment,\\n\\n\\\"Swoosh.\\\"\\n\\nIt was about five minutes after she had transformed into her human form. \\n Surprisingly, she suddenly returned to her original form (coin).\\n\\nVitalik devotee picked up a coin that had fallen to the floor and stared at it.\\n\\nThe surface of the coin was a display, and on it were the words \\\"100 ETH\\\", the quantity held by the man.\\n\\nI tried shaking the coin and calling out, \\\"Hey,\\\" but there was no response.\\n\\nHe tipped the coin and observed it closely, and found nothing odd about it. \\n Not to mention, there was no way he was going to transform into a girl.\\n\\nThe man felt a little lonely. \\n He mumbled very quietly,\\n\\n\\\"TokenGirl…”\",\"timestamp\":1642406941,\"title\":\"SuperBirth
