"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"# A brief introduction to RGB protocols\\n\\nFrancisco Calderón published onNovember 08, 2021\\n\\nOn January 3, 2009 Satoshi Nakamoto launched the first Bitcoin node, from that moment new nodes joined and Bitcoin begin to behave as if it were a new form of life, a form of life that has not stopped evolving, little by little it has become the safest network in the world as a result of its unique design, very well thought out by Satoshi since, through economic incentives, it attracts users commonly called miners to invest in energy and computing power which contributes to network security.\\n\\nAs Bitcoin continues its growth and adoption it faces scalability issues, the Bitcoin network allows a new block with transactions to be mined in an approximate time of 10 minutes, **assuming we have 144 blocks in a day with maximum values ​​of 2700 transactions per block, Bitcoin would have allowed only 4.5 transactions per second,** Satoshi was aware of this limitation, we can see it in an email[1](https://grunch.dev/blog/brief-intro-rgb/?continueFlag=b5d6f714000140e86b3aa676dae95f7d#1) sent to Mike Hearn in March 2011 where he explains how what we know today as a payment channel works. micropayments quickly and safely without waiting for confirmations. This is where off-chain protocols come in.\\n\\nAccording to Christian Decker[2](https://grunch.dev/blog/brief-intro-rgb/?continueFlag=b5d6f714000140e86b3aa676dae95f7d#2) Off-chain protocols are usually systems in which users use data from a blockchain and manage it without touching the blockchain itself until the last minute. Based on this concept, the Lightning Network was born, a network that uses off-chain protocols to allow Bitcoin payments to be made almost instantaneously and since not all these operations are written on the block chain, it allows thousands of transactions per second and scale Bitcoin.\\n\\nResearch and development in the area of ​​off-chain protocols on Bitcoin has opened a pandora's box, today we know that we can achieve much more than value transfer in a decentralized way, the non-profit [LNP/BP Standards Association](https://lnp-bp.org/) focuses on development of layer 2 and 3 protocols on Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, among these projects [RGB](https://rgbfaq.com/) stands out.\\n\\n1\\n[https://plan99.net/\\\\\\\\\\\\~mike/satoshi-emails/thread4.html](https://plan99.net/%5C\\\\~mike/satoshi-emails/thread4.html)\\n\\n2\\n<https://btctranscripts.com/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-christian-decker-history-of-lightning/>\\n\\n3\\n<https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-June/012773.html>\\n\\n4\\n<https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/blob/master/lnpbp-0020.md>\\n\\n5\\n<https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/blob/master/lnpbp-0021.md>\",\"timestamp\":1639289099,\"title\":\"Lok'tar Ogar\"},\"digest\":\"I-3vVH2c04wThXyqXJPj3h7AuTqBBFSdzDKSFLtUbfE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4617628f76c30e9553189c034DC6f4055798f406\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wiLJO6OoHpati0ixZNM7JJL64_SDpzY-OPQJ2FxigkU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"H3O4pBbq1SFyUt32OeJcAidpqOEIqbuLsJNjkSXOvXg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"SLcdUaLxG4LX0fsiy1KjvZeOvd613tA7MbyLLLEXhrKnZ9KHI-0gZ2mJbsnDqqiG4-Q_sG_Yw6gya3NBiwFhug\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4e7e7c73978944a5d6c8b095cdc5118be96a93d8edb7e45ce04381065237d46749fe944457c6dbf92ac0c949e19231467eefdaeaa37bf829c4991968b30aad411b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wiLJO6OoHpati0ixZNM7JJL64_SDpzY-OPQJ2FxigkU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"H3O4pBbq1SFyUt32OeJcAidpqOEIqbuLsJNjkSXOvXg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"vIv3NJEOjw7j4y6pzlYV8G35Myp4ESvr2m2bmUk8rq0\"}"
