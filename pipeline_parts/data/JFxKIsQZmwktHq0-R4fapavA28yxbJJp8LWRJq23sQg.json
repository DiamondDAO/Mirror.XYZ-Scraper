"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Today we share, how to title, to more attractive? A number of clicks on the article, is inseparable from a moving title, how to play a good title? A lot of people have said that, but there are always people who can't, right? Today I will talk to you again!\\nFirst of all, I need to know the mistake of the title:\\n\\n1. The title completely reflects the theme\\n   Many writers will appear this situation, feel that the title is to show the theme of the article, reflect the main content, however, we have an important aspect of the title, it is ignored, that is to attract the eye, if only monotonous show the theme, it will not attract the eye effect.\\n   2, lack of reading\\n   A readable headline is one that makes the reader want to read the whole article, not one that makes the reader want to read the whole article.\\n2. Never make headlines\\n   The title is seriously inconsistent with the content of the article. In order to increase the click rate, a grandiose title is created, but the content of the article has no connection with the title. This is cheating readers.\\n   Secondly, these are the aspects we should consider when writing the title:\\n   1, the title should pay attention to objective facts, not grandiose, to be easy to understand, consider our article audience level, understanding ability, not too obscure, especially rare words to avoid as far as possible.\\n   2, a suspense title let us see the title at the beginning of the mind with a question, want to read the article to solve the problem, a suspense title is easier to attract the attention of readers.\\n   3, the purpose of the title, directly describe the details of the article, such a title is suitable for teaching articles, let readers know what you want to teach at a glance, want to learn people know is not their own needs to meet the knowledge and skills needs of readers.\\n3. Contradictory and controversial titles\\n   Use conflicting arguments to engage readers directly in the debate, but articles with such titles need to be good content and worth reading.\\n4. Hot event titles\\n   Hot events are always the easiest for people to chase after, and the flow can not be underestimated. Actively mastering the dynamics of public opinion and always paying attention to hot news events are beneficial for us to write articles.\\n5. The Angle of the title\\n   Articles on the same topic can be divided into different sub-categories. For example, when we write about agriculture, rural areas and farmers, we can start to describe them from different aspects. A novel perspective and a distinct attitude will have different contents from others.\\n6. Use \\\"I\\\", \\\"you\\\" and \\\"TA\\\"\\n   Use the first, second, third person to write the title, with the story to move people, from the beginning directly hit the reader's mind, to achieve the title effect.\\n7. The number of title words is also critical\\n   A longer title can put down more eye-catching words, of course, also can not be a long title, there is a topic skill is split, the key words of the article listed first, take a look to remove the most critical, the rest of the combination, see the result is not the title you want!\",\"timestamp\":1635602514,\"title\":\"We media article title how to write to attract attention?
