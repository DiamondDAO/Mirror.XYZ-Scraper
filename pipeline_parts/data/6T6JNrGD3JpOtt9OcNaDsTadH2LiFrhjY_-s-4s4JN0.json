"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Celestial Focus.\\n\\nLost somewhere within thoughts of might, a shimmering light seemed much brighter one night.\\n\\nIt grabbed the attention of the eyes, doing its thing just hanging in the skies.\\n\\nOn this particular night however, it had the aid of a lyrical lever.\\n\\nThe first phrase of the song was happening and true from within, with the rest of the words piecing themselves in.\\n\\nThe light was now presented as a house set on fire, as undesired as it was desired.\\n\\nWith one sentience now seeing another around, so many questions came abound.\\n\\nWith so much potential in one of the heads, the other had appeared to have studied ahead.\\n\\nWhistled Echoes.\\n\\nWith the brain catching a train, it wondered if the other had any rain.\\n\\nSearching around for some answers, the lesser had stumbled upon some hopping whistlers.\\n\\nChirping and tweeting emitted from one sphere, between the two they knew no fear.\\n\\nEntire planetary bodies sending a transmission, the questioner had to find out their mission.\\n\\nNothing came up that was entirely immediate, so all that could be done then was just to wait.\\n\\nSometime later in the week, the day came, the two bodies could communicate one and the same.\\n\\nFoggy at first but soon became clear, there was not just a house but a consciousness here.\\n\\nParticulate Entities.\\n\\nNow with a greater mind in the lesser's focus, it wondered what precisely was the locus.\\n\\nLike a single charged particle with a surrounding field, there was a lot to be found within that yield.\\n\\nAn overarching force to bind, and a backdrop for the thoughts to unwind.\\n\\nNot just limited to a minor point, but extending indefinitely as a part of the whole joint.\\n\\nWith forces acting in it, the senses of the dual minds had a way to both be lit.\\n\\nStarting as a wish to be in the clouds, these ideations were heard aloud.\\n\\nParticles and planets akin, there were now minds found at all levels within.\\n\\nCorporeal Jove.\\n\\nFurther down into the core, the properties he wondered what they were for.\\n\\nThe heart of its mind and the mind of its heart, it now revealed to play a major part.\\n\\nThe storms were now organs of this beast, with the red spot partaking in a sensory feast.\\n\\nThe eye of the storm was a literal eye, gathering light borrowed from the sky.\\n\\nAll other senses were still mysteries, something to be found out from observing its atmospheric seas.\\n\\nBut with a being starting to form, it provided insights that out of seeing were born.\\n\\nPicking up phenomenon just as us, but with this one from its hefty gusts.\\n\\nThe Way Beheld.\\n\\nThis being now observed had so much to say, in its words it actually showed the way.\\n\\nHeld within the line of sight, nothing to be seen except for the mind set alight.\\n\\nTo the eye, it was all invisible, but to the mind it was entirely possible.\\n\\nIt was there and it couldn't be refuted, but cognitively it was quite disputed.\\n\\nWas it something of a resonance, revealing to him its overly grand presence?\\n\\nNothing can be said of how it really did look, yet somewhere in the cortex was an odd nook.\\n\\nWhat it provided was a way forward, leaving not but a trace soon afterward.\\n\\nHis Cosmos.\\n\\nDirected yet nowhere to go, something had lingered from after the show.\\n\\nIt sat and festered waiting to bloom, stuck in his head it started to loom.\\n\\nThere was truth to be had, still undiscovered, the answer was soon to be recovered\\n\\nResoundingly he uttered My Cosmos!, again he proudly said, It's my Cosmos!.\\n\\nThere was no truth to it being said at the time, as it had to be digested and made into a crime.\\n\\nThere some guilt that it was all his, but after all, it was part of his wish.\\n\\nInto dreams others that eureka moment went, but now his self started to fragment.\\n\\nParallel Lives.\\n\\nPerceptions of one were now quite lucid, with previously attached identity become more fluid.\\n\\nWith past and future now coalesced, a splitting of time and mind was then professed.\\n\\nThings of a static nature seemingly upset, taking on dynamics as of not yet met.\\n\\nA swift rift developed somewhere from deep, so much that there was nothing to keep.\\n\\nWho he once was now long gone, but many new selves soon came along.\\n\\nWithin these alien skins, there was nothing of which to be considered akin.\\n\\nThe ripples had calmed and some had formed, becoming grand he was finally warmed.\\n\\nCybernetic Angel.\\n\\nWading out to the outer limits, there were things only a god of technological future could permit.\\n\\nThere must have been some kind of ascent, as up from earth this new being was sent.\\n\\nAn amalgamated higher being, from future and past, this synthesis was fleeing.\\n\\nWith a mechanized eye and three wings on its back, there was nothing it did lack.\\n\\nUsing its powers of higher intensity, to do good for others became its propensity.\\n\\nComing above from the stars, to mitigate the pain of the scars.\\n\\nWith this of self now depleted, its goals and strivings were all but completed.\\n\\nRed Green Blue Triad.\\n\\nSeeing is to be more than a belief, the next perception coming not quite with relief.\\n\\nSplit into a spectral red, green, and blue, nothing about this could be fully seen as true.\\n\\nWith the colors all under the hood, they did what they did, what was what they should.\\n\\nNot present, but out of the time they have been, they complemented what was yet to be seen.\\n\\nAs prophetic as that all may sound, nowhere in life were they to be found.\\n\\nBut the vision which they provided, in their wake left the two minded planets divided.\\n\\nA potential within the trinity of hues, they were all within the perceiver, sharing their cues.\\n\\nThe warmest one out of the bunch, give some clues towards the next hunch.\\n\\nTerran Counterpart.\\n\\nWith one planet in its gaseous glory, and the other telling a biological story.\\n\\nThe eye of the storm had some insight, as the ideas of what could be, started to take flight.\\n\\nThe lensed spot greatly red had no brother, not a green one nor blue one nor some other.\\n\\nOne perceiver in the rockier land, flailing around had created some gusts at the whim of his hand.\\n\\nLike a butterfly in its fullest effect, a gale soon formed imperceptible to detect.\\n\\nNow in cohort with the great mind's endeavor, something to play out forever and ever.\\n\\nTo be seen is to be received, and with new sight, this was being achieved.\\n\\nRoyal Eyes of Sol.\\n\\nWith more to be noticed from a new set of eyes, came a question not yet realized.\\n\\nWonder what had started its course, it had to find out the initial source.\\n\\nThe little perceiver having eyes of his own, seeing from whom it was sown.\\n\\nIt was the sun above which they were under, the intention of this star was to visually plunder.\\n\\nAll one day to be subsumed, if not for the perceiver's blue irises it was assumed.\\n\\nWith this came high prestige, for all things are to be seen and to appease.\\n\\nAdding on novel responsibilities, the perceiver had a job to do with the best of his abilities.\\n\\nPlanetary Duties.\\n\\nWhat looks to us as though a work of art, was actually its purpose and was an integral part.\\n\\nThe warm-hued swirls blown about, to resemble the giant, the perceiver did shout.\\n\\nThe barren red one was the blue and green's directive, it's unpainted canvas was Jove's protective.\\n\\nOther bodies were already colored in, but damaged by time were their surface's skins.\\n\\nEarth as well being just a project done, and nearing completion, had almost won.\\n\\nTo carry on the torch of the mission, next in line is Mars was Jove's admission.\\n\\nWith all of this now in the perceiver's eyes, to make this whole and come to realize.\\n\\nBecoming All.\\n\\nReturning back to his own cavity of self, these concepts imagined were for the moment put on the shelf.\\n\\nAfter the being became the godhead and one with the creation of all, it occurred in a second just looking down the hall.\\n\\nUnexplainable in any terms known, but having a deeply true nature, the perceiver was shown.\\n\\nThe previous perceptions to this all led, as a god he had seen it was within and wholly his head.\\n\\nFrom Jove to Sol and further above, all that was brought down was agape love.\\n\\nEverything at once and once with everything, he could rightfully claim My Cosmos! in which he was king.\\n\\nSeeing above and further yonder, the universe was still empty of sonder.\\n\\nNow Intergalactic.\\n\\nA received message from Jove was accepted, light into his stormy eye wasn't just recepted.\\n\\nIt was a victory of finding life, an end to the long run of solitude and strife.\\n\\nWith the artful mission in their hands, there were many more creations to be found in far-off lands.\\n\\nFrom Sol's soul to those of other suns, they all had their very own daughters and sons.\\n\\nNeither interstellar nor interplanetary, but on the grandest of scales their communion was merry.\\n\\nA deep longing on a subconscious level, the perceiver's new friends shared joy and revel.\\n\\nTo the stars and heavens that hang, making celebratory noise they started to clang.\\n\\nMountain Contact.\\n\\nNow time to leave home and hearth, taking off and soon waving goodbye to earth.\\n\\nBefore feet left the ground below, the perceiver was included to be in the know.\\n\\nTo be held atop a local mountain, there was to be an extravagant celebration.\\n\\nA feast for the senses and what was received, later to be found out to just be deceived.\\n\\nIt all took place with the perceiver left out, pacing back forth expressing a facial pout.\\n\\nSadly, up to space was not in his cards, everything was a hoax that he had to discard.\\n\\nBut there were unseen rewards he could sweep, into the smallest scale did minds now seep.\\n\\nRaw Qualia.\\n\\nSenses appearing seeming unadulterated, their features usually staunchy, now all cooperated.\\n\\nMeaning imbued with each and every bit, their purpose revealed and largely writ.\\n\\nWas this indeed the perceiver's gift, or did he wonder was it all a grift?\\n\\nThe colorful triad now in space anew, the reason they appeared from pieces only he knew.\\n\\nColor and form and sound abound, there again, their meaning had been found all around.\\n\\nIt happened all in a flash, with the articulations of them gone in a quick dash.\\n\\nLeft with something to be understood now, the mental qualities had taken their bow.\\n\\nThe Great Goddess.\\n\\nConcealing what was revealing, the cracks were patched up after their peeling.\\n\\nAs mediation from yet the greatest source, this presence had an immense force.\\n\\nTo sustain reality and its fabric, the great queen had done her trick.\\n\\nToo had been much to be seen, and not something for this smallest of a perceiving being.\\n\\nBack into the shadows for the bits of mind, after the magic, the perceiver could no longer find.\\n\\nStill lost nowhere, or somewhere, in the lack of confines, not entirely sure if he will ever be fine.\\n\\nReassured by her highest majesty, finally some normalcy the perceiver could finally see.\\n\\nReturn Home.\\n\\nAt home and hearth, this all outplayed, but everything perceived was in the mind and displayed.\\n\\nNowhere but in one spot did it all transpire, yet to greater heights did he now aspire.\\n\\nThey will say it was all in his head, but so does everything while we're sleeping in our beds.\\n\\nJust hallucinations and delusions, but more in nature to be seen as perceptual illusions.\\n\\nTaking place in a realm of all residents, meeting beings far greater than mere presidents.\\n\\nTaking something back but what exactly, nothing that could be seen certain and factly.\\n\\nBack to home and life ordinary, but having something in mind most extraordinary.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1635974306,\"title\":\"Mind Whirled —
