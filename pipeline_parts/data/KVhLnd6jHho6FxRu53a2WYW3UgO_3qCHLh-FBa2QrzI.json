"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"When I was very small, I stayed in the hometown with my grandparents. I had the great time there, I liked the environment so much. There was a long river in front of my house, the water was very clean, I could see the small fish swim. My grandma usually washed her clothes along the river side. But now when I went back to my hometown, the river was very dirty, the water was light yellow and there were so many rubbish floating in the river. It made me feel that the river had lost its life. I missed the old time when I was playing in the river. It is human being that ruin the environment, if we don't take action to protect it, we will destroy ourselves.\",\"timestamp\":1639107984,\"title\":\"The Clean Water\"},\"digest\":\"AoJHF3HRTaHum9IUPflX8jTf5U2aNuwCx7DUzSW4Cz8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x432194c6184882c7BcF822d0cE8C545a44640E7d\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1deNmsg0NKIDNaBfVRmMj1irZUz7TgXS35WHnh4PfcE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"XcLCG3p_lWBCmdVuAZDCAm93rU84uQXk6ZOHSpWU5s4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"UO44xTsA64WEoVKDHnIgNz1sAgBJ8rmaxjdry97L73Ck9eghNDmdSTmeXqtnRrhcFMk6ejHtvj7rht_ZBs545Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xeed30bf862d529cb6e7cfd5664992e72e118cdb2674314064dbf02878df46f2f0f038ccc48cb844b736333b491c86e960191e948f7ff467126da923ee63145231b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1deNmsg0NKIDNaBfVRmMj1irZUz7TgXS35WHnh4PfcE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"XcLCG3p_lWBCmdVuAZDCAm93rU84uQXk6ZOHSpWU5s4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"AoJHF3HRTaHum9IUPflX8jTf5U2aNuwCx7DUzSW4Cz8\"}"
