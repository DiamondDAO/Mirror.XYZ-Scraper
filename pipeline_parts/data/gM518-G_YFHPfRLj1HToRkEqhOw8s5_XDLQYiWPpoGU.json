"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"On October 19, 2021, 13 days before Halloween, Obits [launched 1331](https://twitter.com/obitsnft/status/1450583452236013569?s=21) — an ambitious IRL to virtual experience. 13 days after Halloween, the 1331 finale arrived. Over 26 days, I formed new friendships, speculated on the future of NFT/crypto, and even [made a late-night drive to Venice, CA in search of a Skeleton Key](https://twitter.com/andrewkingme/status/1454356134047850496?s=21). I joined a dedicated group of individuals to solve the 1331 riddle and I walked away with Obit 2112 as my prize.\\n\\n![1331 Skeleton Key Locations](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*eB9KufrAe3wQM3Xjr-gVmQ.jpeg)\\n\\n## The Obits Backstory\\n\\nBorn by the [death of CryptoPunk 2317](https://twitter.com/robnessofficial/status/1414664615506546690), Obits is a collection of 7132 (2317 in reverse) NFT collectibles — the so-called ‘creepy cousins to the original Punks.’ More than the collectibles themselves, Obits has grown into a community passionate about IRL to virtual experiences.\\n\\nFrom [Dead Ringers](https://obitsnft.com/deadringers) (a 1:1 match of an original Punk) to Skeleton Keys (QR codes linking the real world to the virtual), I was immediately drawn to the ideas behind the pixel art.\\n\\n![https://obitsnft.com](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*CzkaBLxOO7ZiUTZQrVwRpQ.png)\\n\\n## Rugpull in Reverse\\n\\nThe Obits project launched unexpectedly weeks before the developers intended. Affectionately referred to as the ‘September Surprise’ or a ‘Rugpull in Reverse,’ the Obits team explains.\\n\\n> With nothing but a site and about 100 Twitter followers we felt little risk experimenting with giveaways to help us build traction for Obits, but in order to do a giveaway we needed Obit tokens. Minting the two tokens we needed required us opening the contract. Someone found out about it and the word spread like wildfire, causing Obits to sell out in 20 minutes due to people minting directly from the contract around 1 AM. This was a literal overnight success.\\n\\nThis overnight success meant that the Obits development team never had the chance to mint tokens for themselves or future giveaways. With the exception of Obit 0001 and Obit 0002, they were forced to buy back the Obits they had just created on the secondary market.\\n\\nObit 0001 and Obit 0002 were later claimed from Skeleton Key 000 and Skeleton Key 002, respectively.\\n\\n## Skeleton Key 000\\n\\n[Brooklyn, NY](https://goo.gl/maps/JyeHbhPhe5vfx4E67)\\n\\nThe very first Skeleton Key (a QR code containing an Ethereum private key) was posted on the back of a stop sign in [DUMBO](https://goo.gl/maps/JyeHbhPhe5vfx4E67) — launching a cornerstone of the Obits project, IRL to virtual experiences. [Polonary](https://twitter.com/0xhalal), an early adopter and [Obits Discord](https://discord.gg/ggpFEdUc9q) community member, ventured out to Brooklyn in search of the key. The story of how polonary found Skeleton Key 000 and claimed Obit 0001 is [worth a read](https://twitter.com/0xhalal/status/1443104247235624961?s=21).\\n\\n![Skeleton Key 000, Brooklyn, NY](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*pvjjqWfpKVFRfXVGzTEBng.jpeg)\\n\\n```\\n💀🗝 000 Information\\n\\nPublic Key: 0x281eFaB12b1BdCD83aE546e518F40d31FcbaaB4E\\n\\nPrivate Key: 1ce8a381dd1ce398ecc7c87772f0b4405634d9375fbac6fe153c97310ecc805f\\n\\nObit in Wallet: 0001\\n\\nClaimed By: polonary\\n```\\n\\n## Obits 1331\\n\\n## Staging Wallet\\n\\nOn October 11, 2021, the Obits Twitter account [posted a QR code](https://twitter.com/obitsnft/status/1447800436950511619?s=21) (containing an [Ethereum public key](https://etherscan.io/address/0xDa16A5A1Cc222806499e7895bf21ed65d5f56aFF)). The wallet held 0.1331 ETH and two Obits (0002 and 2112), foreshadowing the upcoming 1331 event. This QR code was shared/retweeted multiple times during 1331, most notably after a third Obit (1731) was added to the wallet on November 11.\\n\\nThe staging wallet was our guide, letting us know which Obits were up for grabs. Inaccessible, the publicly visible wallet sat there teasing us, taunting us.\\n\\n![1331 Staging Wallet](https://miro.medium.com/max/640/1\\\\*4P7M9wVKDn14oyuOohDL0g.gif)\\n\\n```\\nStaging Wallet Information\\n\\nPublic Key: 0xDa16A5A1Cc222806499e7895bf21ed65d5f56aFF\\n\\nPrivate Key: Unknown\\n\\nObits in Wallet: 2112, 0002, 1731\\n```\\n\\n## 1331: The Riddle\\n\\nThe following riddle was released via a [video/audio message posted to the Obits Twitter account](https://twitter.com/obitsnft/status/1450583452236013569?s=21) on October 19, 2021, 13 days before Halloween.\\n\\nI immediately [Tweeted my excitement](https://twitter.com/andrewkingme/status/1450599829126598662?s=21) and found myself checking the [Obits Discord](https://discord.gg/ggpFEdUc9q) frequently. Normally a Discord observer, I began contributing to the Obits 1331 channel in a way I never had on other projects.\\n\\n![Image of the Obits: 1331 Riddle, originally posted by the Obits Twitter account.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*MANd0Y1A8S7HMh5SC0H_5Q.jpeg)\\n\\n## Deciphering the Riddle\\n\\nOver time, a dedicated group of us were able to break down the meaning of the riddle. For the sake of brevity, I’ll focus on correct assumptions. Our (many) incorrect assumptions will forever remain on the record in the 1331 channel on Discord.\\n\\n> *This Halloween movie suggested watchlist \\n Can only be read with the articles dismissed*\\n\\n1. The daily movie name/poster provided by the Obits team forms a *suggested watchlist*.\\n2. We should ignore any English articles (a/an/the) in the movie name. <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_articles>\\n\\n> *Where title characters who are in first and in third \\n Reveal the trick to our treat the day after the bird*\\n\\n1. Take the first and third letters from each movie name (after removing English articles).\\n2. The riddle reveals a mechanic for an event happening the *the day after the bird*. Initially, we were convinced *the day after the bird* meant the day after American Thanksgiving (also known as Black Friday). We later learned that the October 30 watchlist movie was THE CROW, making Halloween (October 31) *the day after the bird*.\\n\\n> *Know the middle bride is just I, so begone (that’s a clue)*\\n\\n1. A watchlist movie was posted every day, with the first watchlist movie on 10/19 and the final watchlist movie on 10/31. In total, 13 days of watchlist movies.\\n2. Exactly halfway through, the 7th watchlist movie posted was THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN. The *middle bride*.\\n3. Normally we would take the first and third letters (excluding English articles) to get BI. However, the riddle tells us to take *just I* and *begone* (‘B’ gone). BI = I\\n\\n> *And only the alternate films here will do*\\n\\n1. We should only extract letters from every other watchlist movie.\\n2. Assuming THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (7th watchlist movie) is part of the solution, we should ignore even numbered movies and extract letters from odd numbered watchlist movies.\\n3. The 13th/final watchlist movie was posted on 10/31, Halloween. (1331)\\n\\n> *Yes, you’ll see the message in letters is mixed \\n So reorder thirteen for three heads on a switch*\\n\\n1. The letters extracted from the odd numbered watchlist movies aren’t in order. We’ll need to solve an anagram.\\n2. *Reorder thirteen* refers to the thirteen letters we should extract from the watchlist movies. 7 odd numbered watchlist movies \\\\* 2 = 14. Removing the B from the BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN results in one less letter. 14–1 = 13.\\n3. *Three heads on a switch* was unclear until the very end, after we solved the anagram.\\n\\n## Suggested Watchlist: Solving the Anagram\\n\\nThe Obits team replied to their original post every day with a watchlist movie name/poster. Over the course of 13 days, we were able to compile a complete watchlist. As directed by the riddle, we extracted the first and third letters from each watchlist movie (ignoring English articles) and organized those extracted letters into odd and even collections.\\n\\nThe first watchlist movie, The Witch, had a movie poster with the W character split into two VV characters. We tracked both WT and VI throughout. Ultimately, WT was correct.\\n\\n```\\n01. THE WITCH = WT\\n02. DRACULA HAS RISEN FROM THE GRAVE = DA\\n03. THE WICKER MAN = WC\\n04. MANDY = MN\\n05. THE LOST BOYS = LS\\n06. THE BABADOOK = BB\\n07. THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN = BI = I\\n08. BLACK SUNDAY = BA\\n09. THE TRANSFIGURATION = TA\\n10. THE HOUSE OF THE DEVIL = HU\\n11. AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON = AE\\n12. THE CROW = CO\\n13. HALLOWEEN = HL\\n\\nAll:  WT DA WC MN LS BB I BA TA HU AE CO HL\\nOdd:  WT WC LS I TA AE HL\\nEven: DA MN BB BA HU CO\\n```\\n\\nOn October 29, 2021, two days before the 13th watchlist movie was released, a group of us in the Obits Discord successfully [predicted the final watchlist movie letters and solved the anagram](https://twitter.com/andrewkingme/status/1454657620250267656?s=21).\\n\\n```\\nExtracted Letters: WT WC LS I TA AE HL\\nAnagram Solution: A WALLET SWITCH\\n```\\n\\n> *After 13 days of a riddling curseThe answer of Obits arrives in reverse*\\n\\nOn Halloween, the Obits team [posted an unintelligible audio clip to Twitter](https://twitter.com/obitsnft/status/1454863641854070794?s=21). Reversing the audio confirmed our anagram solution — A WALLET SWITCH.\\n\\nAt this point, we continued to speculate what A WALLET SWITCH could mean, not knowing the first switch was only a few hours away.\\n\\n## Skeleton Key 001\\n\\n[Brooklyn, NY](https://goo.gl/maps/WH66BwdXshDcDFS58) and [Venice, CA](https://goo.gl/maps/LbTyd426Gpy42iv59)\\n\\nSolving the 1331 riddle was only the first step. A WALLET SWITCH was coming but we would also need an IRL Skeleton Key to claim each Obit. On October 28, prior to solving the riddle, the first Skeleton Key [was](https://twitter.com/obitsnft/status/1453893277804027913?s=21) [posted](https://twitter.com/obitsnft/status/1454141910591983618?s=21) in [Brooklyn, NY](https://goo.gl/maps/WH66BwdXshDcDFS58) and [Venice, CA](https://goo.gl/maps/LbTyd426Gpy42iv59).\\n\\n[Oaklord1](https://twitter.com/stovden/) was first on the scene in Brooklyn. Upon finding an empty wallet, and preferring to solve 1331 with the [Discord community](https://discord.gg/ggpFEdUc9q), he [shared the private key with the group](https://twitter.com/stovden/status/1453951817117691915?s=21). This act of selflessness was inspiring and, in my opinion, indicative of the type of individuals present in the Obits community.\\n\\nIn parallel, I found myself driving up to Venice in search of a matching Skeleton Key. In a way, it felt like Oaklord1 and I were venturing out together, even though we were physically an entire country apart.\\n\\n![Skeleton Key 000, Brooklyn, NY](https://miro.medium.com/max/1354/1\\\\*YSBuQn9j6K18XfmhIisQoA.jpeg)\\n\\n![Skeleton Key 001, Venice, CA](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*DHgt0247AsZqyZn1tiUwsQ.jpeg)\\n\\nOn Halloween eve, Obits posted the following countdown to Twitter.\\n\\n> *To answer the question of how and when \\n Best start now, count minutes down from ten*\\n\\nAt the end of the countdown, Obit 2112 was transferred/switched from the Staging Wallet to Skeleton Key 001, along with 0.05 ETH for gas.\\n\\nAt first, I was watching the Obits Twitter for a new post. After 10 minutes passed, then 11 minutes, then 12, I finally realized what was happening and checked the Skeleton Key. There it was — Obit 2112! In a rush of excitement, I quickly claimed/transferred Obit 2112 to my personal wallet. Shortly thereafter, the following message was posted to the Obits Twitter account.\\n\\n> *Death knocks at the door \\n For the keymaster’s score \\n Rapping once and then twice \\n To warn of two more*\\n\\n1. Obit 2112 was [andrewkingme.eth’s score](https://twitter.com/andrewkingme/status/1455040148899459072?s=21).\\n2. A WALLET SWITCH would happen twice more. ( — aligning with *three heads on a switch* from the original riddle.)\\n\\n```\\n💀🗝 001 Information\\n\\nPublic Key: 0xeBEbD74a87f5C3b0985D0269f74501A3C541FDE2\\n\\nPrivate Key: efdbaefa6584196ce3a242922c4b5e7f67d0e150b2a0250bec43ce26a4406bd4\\n\\nObit in Wallet: 2112\\n\\nClaimed By: andrewkingme.eth\\n```\\n\\n## Skeleton Key 002\\n\\n[Venice, CA](https://goo.gl/maps/TJcFH8aKCZ415DSv5) and [Philadelphia, PA](https://goo.gl/maps/pdC4VVnMsNjbG4g48)\\n\\n> *The second is twoAnd two’s in two cities \\n But two is just oneFor LA and Philly*\\n\\n![Skeleton Key 002, Venice, CA](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*n6bYU8hx76J4nDK6EEB78w.jpeg)\\n\\n![Skeleton Key 002, Philadelphia, PA](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*1OyRes6Fgagmwc4vansSHw.jpeg)\\n\\nOn November 4, 2021, the second Sketelon Key [was](https://twitter.com/obitsnft/status/1456443466301513732?s=21) [posted](https://twitter.com/obitsnft/status/1456442540853538833?s=21) in [Venice, CA](https://goo.gl/maps/TJcFH8aKCZ415DSv5) and [Philadelphia, PA](https://goo.gl/maps/pdC4VVnMsNjbG4g48).
