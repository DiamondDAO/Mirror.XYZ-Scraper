Integrating the best technical solutions is a priority to push NFT innovation forward. We are thrilled to offer creators a reliable VRF tool which, alongside the N project collection, unlocks a promising future for on-chain generative art.\\n\\nIn order to create generative art that is truly random from the transaction execution, creators need access to a secure random number generator (RNG) that any user could independently audit.\\n\\nHowever, RNG solutions for smart contracts require several security considerations to prevent manipulation and ensure system integrity. For instance, RNG solutions derived from blockchain data like block hashes can be exploited by miners/validators, while off-chain RNG solutions derived from off-chain APIs can be opaque.\\n\\n## Integration Chainlink VRF\\n\\nAfter reviewing various solutions, we selected Chainlink VRF because it’s based on cutting-edge academic research, supported by a time-tested oracle network, and secured through the generation and on-chain verification of cryptographic proofs that prove the integrity of each random number supplied to smart contracts.\\n\\nChainlink VRF works by combining block data that is still unknown when the request is made with the oracle node's pre-committed private key to generate both a random number and a cryptographic proof.\\n\\n**The artists using Nil’s platform can build a smart contract that will only accept the random number input if it has a valid cryptographic proof, and the cryptographic proof can only be generated if the VRF process is tamper-proof.** This provides collectors with verifiable assurances that the generative art was encoded in a provably random manner.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Au7KLBwAQ8EDPGr735hP1.png?height=338&width=1140)\\n\\n## Case Study: Seed Phrase Collection by Sean Elliott\\n\\n**Seed Phrase is a ‘Crypto Native’ generative art collection that’s fully on-chain.**\\n\\nEvery creative decision in this project has been made with the available blockchain technologies in mind. This collection pays homage to those before Sean who inspired him, and to those who will be here after.\\n\\nThe Seed Phrase collection is inspired by BIP-0039, and uses all 2048 words in its list!\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/v39Gvnp9ItwDl4feeAv5u.png?height=4800&width=4800)\\n\\n**The pieces are fully on-chain, meaning that your SEED, its metadata, attributes, and the art itself are generated directly from the artist’s smart contract and stored immutably on the Ethereum blockchain.**\\n\\nTo make the art generative in a truly random way, Sean incorporates Chainlink VRF into his RNG (random number generator) to provide a provably-fair and verifiable source of randomness. This makes every piece of art verifiably unique, with on-chain randomization allowing for reliable, but unpredictable Seed Phrase art generation.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nNil DAO is thrilled to grow its stack by integrating best-in-class blockchain infrastructure.\\n\\nChainlink VRF will be used as a tool to support some of the most exciting generative art pieces of the century, promoting fairness and transparency alongside some really amazing generative art!\\n\\n**FREE THE CREATORS.**\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## About Chainlink\\n\\nChainlink is the industry standard for building, accessing, and selling oracle services needed to power hybrid smart contracts on any blockchain. Chainlink oracle networks provide smart contracts with a way to reliably connect to any external API and leverage secure off-chain computations for enabling feature-rich applications. Chainlink currently secures tens of billions of dollars across DeFi, insurance, gaming, and other major industries, and offers global enterprises and leading data providers a universal gateway to all blockchains.\\n\\n**Learn more about Chainlink by visiting [chain.link](https://chain.link/) or read the documentation at [docs.chain.link](http://docs.chain.link/).**\\n\\nTo discuss an integration, [reach out to an expert](https://chainlinkcommunity.typeform.com/to/OYQO67EF?page=announcement).\\n\\n## About Nil\\n\\n* Explore on [Nil](https://nildao.xyz)\\n* Join the Nil community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/nildao)\\n* Follow Nil on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Nil__dao)\",\"timestamp\":1639581041,\"title\":\"Nil Integrates Chainlink VRF to Empower Generative Art Creators\"},\"digest\":\"ohrVwgjuy3JUNVvvoFqTuCQZzRSqo8SkbsSjOboP5cQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x73e3E8a583cC7b9b4baa0fa8B6b5241D17Ff7D36\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"YHpThw0CIx52z6Q23DE7FHFiuY1Ex0mrtzwZsIXfX5w\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"cxuIEJU2xmdKOliuXeqLWFv7YT6k5OIVT598IUPkP8M\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"oJ7E81iNQZ8zs72djqDT5Xd0Ceph6iehSPCDhXHSthM1ljgAS1aIPziRPZMM6rp80VFPhVpEDH7VRaOmMSd7Yw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xedbc7e0616271fede7bb9334f139bb541fb0bdb65a68e2240acf24af6f211194296b6a155afe3afbef1520b98d466ebf489b582544d1f87f438380ed0c754ea51c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"YHpThw0CIx52z6Q23DE7FHFiuY1Ex0mrtzwZsIXfX5w\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"cxuIEJU2xmdKOliuXeqLWFv7YT6k5OIVT598IUPkP8M\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Yn_0OR30RLSQrTp1VI1-u0w9FQyOrfMU8_5pFMJOMc0\"}"
