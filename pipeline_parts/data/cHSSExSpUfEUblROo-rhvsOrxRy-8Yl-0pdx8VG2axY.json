"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"connected with the behaviour of birds. Undoubtedly numerous species of birds are susceptible to atmospheric changes (of an electrical and barometric nature) too slight to be observed by man's unaided senses; thus only is to be explained the phenomenon of migration and also the many other peculiarities in the behaviour of birds whereby approaching changes in the weather may be foretold. Probably, also, this fact has much to do with the extraordinary homing instinct of pigeons.  But, of course, in the days when meteorological science had yet to be born, no such explanation as this could be known. The ancients observed that birds by their migrations or by other peculiarities in their behaviour prognosticated coming changes in the seasons of the year and other changes connected with the weather (such as storms, *etc*.); they saw, too, in the homing instincts of pigeons an apparent exhibition of intelligence exceeding that of man. What more natural, then, for them to attribute foresight to birds, and to suppose that all sorts of coming events (other than those of an atmospheric nature) might be foretold by careful observation of their flight and song?\\n\\nAugury--that is, the art of divination by observing the behaviour of birds--was extensively cultivated by the Etrurians and Romans.\\\\[1\\\\] It is still used, I believe, by the natives of Samoa.  The Romans had an official college of augurs, the members of which were originally three patricians. About 300 B.C. the number of patrician augurs was increased by one, and five plebeian augurs were added.  Later the number was again increased to fifteen.  The object of augury was not so much to foretell the future as to indicate what line of action should be followed, in any given circumstances, by the nation. The augurs were consulted on all matters of importance, and the position of augur was thus one of great consequence. In what appears to be the oldest method, the augur, arrayed in a special costume, and carrying a staff with which to mark out the visible heavens into houses, proceeded to an elevated piece of ground, where a sacrifice was made and a prayer repeated. Then, gazing towards the sky, he waited until a bird appeared. The point in the heavens where it first made its appearance was carefully noted, also the manner and direction of its flight, and the point where it was lost sight of. From these particulars an augury was derived, but, in order to be of effect, it had to be confirmed by a further one.\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] This is not quite an accurate definition, as \\\"auguries\\\" were also obtained from other animals and from celestial phenomena (*e.g*. lightning), *etc*.\\n\\nAuguries were also drawn from the notes of birds, birds being divided by the augurs into two classes:  (i) *oscines*, \\\"those which give omens by their note,\\\" and (ii) *alites*, \\\"those which afford presages by their flight.\\\"\\\\[1\\\\] Another method of augury was performed by the feeding of chickens specially kept for this purpose.  This was done just before sunrise by the *pullarius* or feeder, strict silence being observed. If the birds manifested no desire for their food, the omen was of a most direful nature.  On the other hand, if from the greediness of the chickens the grain fell from their beaks and rebounded from the ground, the augury was most favourable. This latter augury was known as *tripudium solistimum*. \\\"Any fraud practiced by the `pullarius',\\\" writes the Rev. EDWARD SMEDLEY, \\\"reverted to his own head. Of this we have a memorable instance in the great battle between Papirius Cursor and the Samnites in the year of Rome 459. So anxious were the troops for battle, that the `pullarius' dared to announce to the consul a `tripudium solistimum,' although the chickens refused to eat.  Papirius unhesitatingly gave the signal for fight, when his son, having discovered the false augury, hastened to communicate it to his father. `Do thy part well,' was his reply, `and let the deceit of the augur fall on himself.  The \\\"tripudium\\\" has been announced to me, and no omen could be better for the Roman army and people!' As the troops advanced, a javelin thrown at random struck the `pullatius' dead.  `The hand of heaven is in the battle,' cried Papirius; `the guilty is punished!' and he advanced and conquered.\\\"\\\\[1b\\\\] A coincidence of this sort, if it really occurred, would very greatly strengthen the popular belief in auguries.\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] PLINY:  *Natural History*, bk.  x.  chap.  xxii.

EDWARD SMEDLEY, M.A.: *The Occult Sciences* (*Encyclopaedia Metropolitana*), ed.  by ELIHU RICH (1855), p.  144.\\n\\nThe *cock* has always been reckoned a bird possessed of magic power. At its crowing, we are told, all unquiet spirits who roam the earth depart to their dismal abodes, and the orgies of the Witches' Sabbath terminate. A cock is the favourite sacrifice offered to evil spirits in Ceylon and elsewhere.  Alectromancy\\\\[2\\\\] was an ancient and peculiarly senseless method of divination (so called) in which a cock was employed. The bird had to be young and quite white.  Its feet were cut off and crammed down its throat with a piece of parchment on which were written certain Hebrew words.  The cock, after the repetition of a prayer by the operator, was placed in a circle divided into parts corresponding to the letters of the alphabet, in each of which a grain of wheat was placed. A certain psalm was recited, and then the letters were noted from which the cock picked up the grains, a fresh grain being put down for each one picked up.  These letters, properly arranged, were said to give the answer to the inquiry for which divination was made. I am not sure what one was supposed to do if, as seems likely, the cock refused to act in the required manner.\\n\\n\\\\[2\\\\] Cf.  ARTHUR EDWARD WAITE:  *The Occult Sciences* (1891), pp. 124 and 125.\\n\\nThe *owl* was reckoned a bird of evil omen with the Romans, who derived this opinion from the Etrurians, along with much else of their so-called science of augury.  It was particularly dreaded if seen in a city, or, indeed, anywhere by day. PLINY (Caius Plinius Secundus, A.D. 61-before 115) informs us that on one occasion \\\"a horned owl entered the very sanctuary of the Capitol; . . . in consequence of which, Rome was purified on the nones of March in that year.\\\"\\\\[1\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] PLINY:  *Natural History*, bk.  x.  chap.  xvi.  (BOSTOCK and RILEY'S trans., vol.  ii., 1855, p.  492).\\n\\nThe folk-lore of the British Isles abounds with quaint beliefs and stories concerning birds.  There is a charming Welsh legend concerning the *robin*, which the Rev. T. F. T. DYER quotes from *Notes and Queries*:--\\\"Far, far away, is a land of woe, darkness, spirits of evil, and fire.  Day by day does this little bird bear in his bill a drop of water to quench the flame.  So near the burning stream does he fly, that his dear little feathers are SCORCHED; and hence he is named Brou-rhuddyn (Breast-burnt). To serve little children, the robin dares approach the infernal pit.  No good child will hurt the devoted benefactor of man.  The robin returns from the land of fire, and therefore he feels the cold of winter far more than his brother birds. He shivers in the brumal blast; hungry, he chirps before your door.\\\"\\\\[2\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[2\\\\] T. F. THISELTON DYER, M.A.: *English Folk-Lore* (1878), pp. 65 and 66).\\n\\nAnother legend accounts for the robin's red breast by supposing this bird to have tried to pluck a thorn from the crown encircling the brow of the crucified CHRIST, in order to alleviate His sufferings. No doubt it is on account of these legends that it is considered a crime, which will be punished with great misfortune, to kill a robin. In some places the same prohibition extends to the *wren*, which is popularly believed to be the wife of the robin. In other parts, however, the wren is (or at least was) cruelly hunted on certain days.  In the Isle of Man the wren-hunt took place on Christmas Eve and St Stephen's Day, and is accounted for by a legend concerning an evil fairy who lured many men to destruction, but had to assume the form of a wren to escape punishment at the hands of an ingenious knight-errant.\\n\\nFor several centuries there was prevalent over the whole of civilised Europe a most extraordinary superstition concerning the small Arctic bird resembling, but not so large as, the common wild goose, known as the *barnacle* or *bernicle goose*. MAX MUELLER\\\\[1\\\\] has suggested that this word was really derived from *Hibernicula*, the name thus referring to Ireland, where the birds were caught; but common opinion associated the barnacle goose with the shell-fish known as the barnacle (which is found on timber exposed to the sea), supposing that the former was generated out of the latter. Thus in one old medical writer we find:  \\\"There are founde in the north parts of Scotland, and the Ilands adjacent, called Orchades \\\\[Orkney Islands\\\\], certain trees, whereon doe growe certaine shell fishes, of a white colour tending to russet; wherein are conteined little liuing creatures: which shells in time of maturitie doe open, and out of them grow those little living things; which falling into the water, doe become foules, whom we call Barnakles . . . but the other that do fall vpon the land, perish and come to nothing: this much by the writings of others, and also from the mouths of the people of those parts....\\\"\\\\[1b\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] See F. MAX MUELLER'S *Lectures on the Science of Language* (1885), where a very full account of the tradition concerning the origin of the barnacle goose will be found.\\n\\n\\\\[1b\\\\] JOHN GERARDE:  *The Herball; or, Generall Historie of Plantes* (1597). 1391.\\n\\nThe writer, however, who was a well-known surgeon and botanist of his day, adds that he had personally examined certain shell-fish from Lancashire, and on opening the shells had observed within birds in various stages of development.  No doubt he was deceived by some purely superficial resemblances--for example, the feet of the barnacle fish resemble somewhat the feathers of a bird. He gives an imaginative illustration of the barnacle fowl escaping from its shell, which is reproduced in fig.  12.\\n\\nTurning now from superstitions concerning actual birds to legends of those that are purely mythical, passing reference must be made to the *roc*, a bird existing in Arabian legend, which we meet in the *Arabian Nights*, and which is chiefly remarkable for its size and strength.\\n\\nThe *phoenix*, perhaps, is of more interest. Of \\\"that famous bird of Arabia,\\\" PLINY writes as follows, prefixing his description of it with the cautious remark, \\\"I am not quite sure that its existence is not all a fable.\\\" \\\"It is said that there is only one in existence in the whole world, and that that one has not been seen very often. We are told that this bird is of the size of an eagle, and has a brilliant golden plumage around the neck, while the rest of the body is of a purple colour; except the tail, which is azure, with long feathers intermingled of a roseate hue; the throat is adorned with a crest, and the head with a tuft of feathers. The first Roman who described this bird . . . was the senator Manilius.... He tells us that no person has ever seen this bird eat, that in Arabia it is looked upon as sacred to the sun, that it lives five hundred and forty years, that when it becomes old it builds a nest of cassia and sprigs of incense, which it fills with perfumes, and then lays its body down upon them to die; that from its bones and marrow there springs at first a sort of small worm, which in time changes into a little bird; that the first thing that it does is to perform the obsequies of its predecessor, and to carry the nest entire to the city of the Sun near Panchaia, and there deposit it upon the altar of that divinity.\\n\\n\\\"The same Manilius states also, that the revolution of the great year is completed with the life of this bird, and that then a new cycle comes round again with the same characteristics as the former one, in the seasons and the appearance of the stars.  . . . This bird was brought to Rome in the censorship of the Emperor Claudius . . . and was exposed to public view.... This fact is attested by the public Annals, but there is no one that doubts that it was a fictitious phoenix only.\\\"\\\\[1\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] PLINY:  *Natural History*, bk.  x.  chap.  ii.  (BOSTOCK and RILEY'S trans., vol.  ii., 1855, PP.  479-481).\\n\\nThe description of the plumage, *etc*., of this bird applies fairly well, as CUVIER has pointed out,\\\\[2\\\\] to the golden pheasant, and a specimen of the latter may have been the \\\"fictitious phoenix\\\" referred to above.  That this bird should have been credited with the extraordinary and wholly fabulous properties related by PLINY and others is not, however, easy to understand. The phoenix was frequently used to illustrate the doctrine of the immortality of the soul (*e.g*. in CLEMENT'S *First Epistle to the Corinthians*), and it is not impossible that originally it was nothing more than a symbol of immortality which in time became to be believed in as a really existing bird. The fact, however, that there was supposed to be only one phoenix, and also that the length of each of its lives coincided with what the ancients termed a \\\"great year,\\\" may indicate that the phoenix was a symbol of cosmological periodicity.  On the other hand, some ancient writers (e_.g_. TACITUS, A.D. 55-120) explicitly refer to the phoenix as a symbol of the sun, and in the minds of the ancients the sun was closely connected with the idea of immortality. Certainly the accounts of the gorgeous colours of the plumage of the phoenix might well be descriptions of the rising sun. It appears, moreover, that the Egyptian hieroglyphic *benu*, {glyph}, which is a figure of a heron or crane (and thus akin to the phoenix), was employed to designate the rising sun.\\n\\n\\\\[2\\\\] See CUVIER'S *The Animal Kingdom*, GRIFFITH'S trans., vol.  viii. (1829), p.  23.\\n\\nThere are some curious Jewish legends to account for the supposed immortality of the phoenix.  According to one, it was the sole animal that refused to eat of the forbidden tree when tempted by EVE.  According to another, its immortality was conferred on it by NOAH because of its considerate behaviour in the Ark, the phoenix not clamouring for food like the other animals.\\\\[1\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] The existence of such fables as these shows how grossly the real meanings of the Sacred Writings have been misunderstood.\\n\\nThere is a celebrated bird in Chinese tradition, the *Fung Hwang*, which some sinologues identify with the phoenix of the West.\\\\[2\\\\] According to a commentator on the '*Rh Ya*, this \\\"felicitous and perfect bird has a cock's head, a snake's neck, a swallow's beak, a tortoise's back, is of five different colours and more than six feet high.\\\"\\n\\n\\\\[2\\\\] Mr CHAS.  GOULD, B.A., to whose book *Mythical Monsters* (1886) I am very largely indebted for my account of this bird, and from which I have culled extracts from the Chinese, is not of this opinion. Certainly the fact that we read of Fung Hwangs in the plural, whilst tradition asserts that there is only one phoenix, seems to point to a difference in origin.\\n\\nAnother account (that in the *Lun Yu Tseh Shwai Shing*) tells us that \\\"its head resembles heaven, its eye the sun, its back the moon, its wings the wind, its foot the ground, and its tail the woof.\\\" Furthermore, \\\"its mouth contains commands, its heart is conformable to regulations, its ear is thoroughly acute in hearing, its tongue utters sincerity, its colour is luminous, its comb resembles uprightness, its spur is sharp and curved, its voice is sonorous, and its belly is the treasure of literature.\\\"  Like the dragon, tortoise, and unicorn, it was considered to be a spiritual creature; but, unlike the Western phoenix, more than one Fung Hwang was, as I have pointed out, believed to exist. The birds were not always to be seen, but, according to Chinese records, they made their appearance during the reigns of certain sovereigns. The Fung Hwang is regarded by the Chinese as an omen of great happiness and prosperity, and its likeness is embroidered on the robes of empresses to ensure success.  Probably, if the bird is not to be regarded as purely mythological and symbolic in origin, we have in the stories of it no more than exaggerated accounts of some species of pheasant. Japanese literature contains similar stories.\\n\\nOf other fabulous bird-forms mention may be made of the *griffin* and the *harpy*.  The former was a creature half eagle, half lion, popularly supposed to be the progeny of the union of these two latter. It is described in the so-called *Voiage and Travaile of Sir* JOHN MAUNDEVILLE in the following terms\\\\[1\\\\]: \\\"Sum men seyn, that thei hen the Body upward, as an Egle, and benethe as a Lyoun: and treuly thei seyn sothe, that thei ben of that schapp. But o Griffoun hathe the body more gret and is more strong thanne 8 Lyouns, of suche Lyouns as ben o this half; and more gret and strongere, than an 100 Egles, suche as we hen amonges us. For o Griffoun there will bere, fleynge to his Nest, a gret Hors, or 2 Oxen zoked to gidere, as thei gon at the Plowghe.  For he hathe his Talouns so longe and so large and grete, upon his Feet, as thoughe thei weren Hornes of grete Oxen or of Bugles or of Kyzn; so that men maken Cuppes of hem, to drynken of: and of hire Ribbes and of the Pennes of hire Wenges, men maken Bowes fulle strong, to schote with Arwes and Quarelle.\\\"  The special characteristic of the griffin was its watchfulness, its chief function being thought to be that of guarding secret treasure. This characteristic, no doubt, accounts for its frequent use in heraldry as a supporter to the arms.  It was sacred to APOLLO, the sun-god, whose chariot was, according to early sculptures, drawn by griffins.  PLINY, who speaks of it as a bird having long ears and a hooked beak, regarded it as fabulous.\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] *The Voiage and Travaile of Sir* JOHN MAUNDEVILLE, *Kt.

The work, which was first published in French during the latter part of the fourteenth century, achieved an immense popularity, the marvels that it relates being readily received by the credulous folk of that and many a succeeding day.\\n\\nThe harpies (*i.e*. snatchers) in Greek mythology are creatures like vultures as to their bodies, but with the faces of women, and armed with sharp claws.\\n\\n\\\"Of Monsters all, most Monstrous this; no greater Wrath God sends 'mongst Men; it comes from depth of pitchy Hell:  And Virgin's Face, but Womb like Gulf unsatiate hath, Her Hands are griping Claws, her Colour pale and fell.\\\"\\\\[1\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] Quoted from VERGIL by JOHN GUILLIM in his *A Display of Heraldry* (sixth edition, 1724), p.  271.\\n\\nWe meet with the harpies in the story of PHINEUS, a son of AGENOR, King of Thrace.  At the bidding of his jealous wife, IDAEA, daughter of DARDANUS, PHINEUS put out the sight of his children by his former wife, CLEOPATRA, daughter of BOREAS. To punish this cruelty, the gods caused him to become blind, and the harpies were sent continually to harass and affright him, and to snatch away his food or defile it by their presence. They were afterwards driven away by his brothers-in-law, ZETES and CALAIS.  It has been suggested that originally the harpies were nothing more than personifications of the swift storm-winds; and few of the old naturalists, credulous as they were, regarded them as real creatures, though this cannot be said of all. Some other fabulous bird-forms are to be met with in Greek and Arabian mythologies, *etc*., but they are not of any particular interest. And it is time for us to conclude our present excursion, and to seek for other byways.\\n\\nV\\n\\nTHE POWDER OF SYMPATHY:  A CURIOUS MEDICAL SUPERSTITION\\n\\nOUT of the superstitions of the past the science of the present has gradually evolved.  In the Middle Ages, what by courtesy we may term medical science was, as we have seen, little better than a heterogeneous collection of superstitions, and although various reforms were instituted with the passing of time, superstition still continued for long to play a prominent part in medical practice.\\n\\nOne of the most curious of these old medical (or perhaps I should say surgical) superstitions was that relating to the Powder of Sympathy, a remedy (?) chiefly remembered in connection with the name of Sir KENELM DIGBY (1603-1665), though he was probably not the first to employ it. The Powder itself, which was used as a cure for wounds, was, in fact, nothing else than common vitriol,\\\\[1\\\\] though an improved and more elegant form (if one may so describe it) was composed of vitriol desiccated by the sun's rays, mixed with *gum tragacanth*. It was in the application of the Powder that the remedy was peculiar. It was not, as one might expect, applied to the wound itself, but any article that might have blood from the wound upon it was either sprinkled with the Powder or else placed in a basin of water in which the Powder had been dissolved, and maintained at a temperate heat. Meanwhile, the wound was kept clean and cool.\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] Green vitriol, ferrous sulphate heptahydrate, a compound of iron, sulphur, and oxygen, crystallised with seven molecules of water, represented by the formula FeSO4<.>7H2O. On exposure to the air it loses water, and is gradually converted into basic ferric sulphate. For long, green vitriol was confused with blue vitriol, which generally occurs as an impurity in crude green vitriol. Blue vitriol is copper sulphate pentahydrate, CuSO4<.>5H2O.\\n\\nSir KENELM DIGBY appears to have delivered a discourse dealing with the famous Powder before a learned assembly at Montpellier in France; at least a work purporting to be a translation of such a discourse was published in 1658,\\\\[1\\\\] and further editions appeared in 1660 and 1664. KENELM was a son of the Sir EVERARD DIGBY (1578-1606) who was executed for his share in the Gunpowder Plot.  In spite of this fact, however, JAMES I. appears to have regarded him with favour.  He was a man of romantic temperament, possessed of charming manners, considerable learning, and even greater credulity.  His contemporaries seem to have differed in their opinions concerning him.  EVELYN (1620-1706), the diarist, after inspecting his chemical laboratory, rather harshly speaks of him as \\\"an errant mountebank\\\". Elsewhere he well refers to him as \\\"a teller of strange things\\\"--this was on the occasion of DIGBY'S relating a story of a lady who had such an aversion to roses that one laid on her cheek produced a blister!\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] *A late Discourse . . . by Sir* KENEEM DIGBY, *Kt. &c. Touching the Cure of Wounds by the Powder of Sympathy . . . rendered . . . out of French into English by* R. WHITE, Gent. (1658). This is entitled the second edition, but appears to have been the first.\\n\\nTo return to the *Late Discourse*:  after some preliminary remarks, Sir KENELM records a cure which he claims to have effected by means of the Powder.  It appears that JAMES HOWELL (1594-1666, afterwards historiographer royal to CHARLES II.), had, in the attempt to separate two friends engaged in a duel, received two serious wounds in the hand. To proceed in the writer's own words:--\\\"It was my chance to be lodged hard by him; and four or five days after, as I was making myself ready, he \\\\[Mr Howell\\\\] came to my House, and prayed me to view his wounds; for I understand, said he, that you have extraordinary remedies upon such occasions, and my Surgeons apprehend some fear, that it may grow to a Gangrene, and so the hand must be cut off....\\n\\n\\\"I asked him then for any thing that had the blood upon it, so he presently sent for his Garter, wherewith his hand was first bound:  and having called for a Bason of water, as if I would wash my hands; I took an handful! of Powder of Vitrol, which I had in my study, and presently dissolved it. As soon as the bloody garter was brought me, I put it within the Bason, observing in the interim what Mr *Howel* did, who stood talking with a Gentleman in the corner of my Chamber, not regarding at all what I was doing:  but he started suddenly, as if he had found some strange alteration in himself; I asked him what he ailed?  I know not what ailes me, but I find that I feel no more pain, methinks that a pleasing kind of freshnesse, as it were a wet cold Napkin did spread over my hand, which hath taken away the inflammation that tormented me before; I replied, since that you feel already so good an effect of my medicament, I advise you to cast away all your Plaisters, onely keep the wound clean, and in a moderate temper 'twixt heat and cold. This was presently reported to the Duke of *Buckingham*, and a little after to the King \\\\[James I.\\\\], who were both very curious to know the issue of the businesse, which was, that after dinner I took the garter out of the water, and put it to dry before a great fire; it was scarce dry, but Mr *Howels* servant came running \\\\[and told me\\\\], that his Master felt as much burning as ever he had done, if not more, for the heat was such, as if his hand were betwixt coales of fire: I answered, that although that had happened at present, yet he should find ease in a short time; for I knew the reason of this new accident, and I would provide accordingly, for his Master should be free from that inflammation, it may be, before he could possibly return unto him: but in case he found no ease, I wished him to come presently back again, if not he might forbear coming.  Thereupon he went, and at the instant I did put again the garter into the water; thereupon he found his Master without any pain at all. To be brief, there was no sense of pain afterward: but within five or six dayes the wounds were cicatrized, and entirely healed.\\\"\\\\[1\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] *Ibid*., pp.  7-11.\\n\\nSir KENELM proceeds, in this discourse, to relate that he obtained the secret of the Powder from a Carmelite who had learnt it in the East.  Sir KENELM says that he told it only to King JAMES and his celebrated physician, Sir THEODORE MAYERNE (1573-1655). The latter disclosed it to the Duke of MAYERNE, whose surgeon sold the secret to various persons, until ultimately, as Sir KENELM remarks, it became known to every country barber. However, DIGBY'S real connection with the Powder has been questioned.  In an Appendix to Dr NATHANAEL HIGHMORE'S (1613-1685) *The History of Generation*, published in 1651, entitled *A Discourse of the Cure of Wounds by Sympathy*, the Powder is referred to as Sir GILBERT TALBOT'S Powder; nor does it appear to have been DIGBY who brought the claims of the Sympathetic Powder before the notice of the then recently-formed Royal Society, although he was a by no means inactive member of the Society.  HIGHMORE, however, in the Appendix to the work referred to above, does refer to DIGBY'S reputed cure of HOWELL'S wounds already mentioned; and after the publication of DIGBY'S *Discourse* the Powder became generally known as Sir KENELM DIGBY'S Sympathetic Powder.  As such it is referred to in an advertisement appended to *Wit and Drollery* (1661) by the bookseller, NATHANAEL BROOK.\\\\[1\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] This advertisement is as follows:  \\\"These are to give notice, that Sir *Kenelme Digbies* Sympathetical Powder prepar'd by Promethean fire, curing all green wounds that come within the compass of a Remedy; and likewise the Tooth-ache infallibly in a very short time: Is to be had at Mr *Nathanael Brook's* at the Angel in *Cornhil*.\\\"\\n\\nThe belief in cure by sympathy, however, is much older than DIGBY'S or TALBOT'S Sympathetic Powder.  PARACELSUS described an ointment consisting essentially of the moss on the skull of a man who had died a violent death, combined with boar's and bear's fat, burnt worms, dried boar's brain, red sandal-wood and mummy, which was used to cure (?) wounds in a similar manner, being applied to the weapon with which the hurt had been inflicted. With reference to this ointment, readers will probably recall the passage in SCOTT'S *Lay of the Last Minstrel* (canto 3, stanza 23), respecting the magical cure of WILLIAM of DELORAINE'S wound by \\\"the Ladye of Branksome\\\":--\\n\\n\\\"She drew the splinter from the wound And with a charm she stanch'd the blood; She bade the gash be cleans'd and bound:  No longer by his couch she stood; But she had ta'en the broken lance, And washed it from the clotted gore And salved the splinter o'er and o'er. William of Deloraine, in trance, Whene'er she turned it round and round, Twisted as if she gall'd his wound. Then to her maidens she did say That he should be whole man and sound Within the course of a night and day.      Full long she toil'd; for she did rue      Mishap to friend so stout and true.\\\"\\n\\nFRANCIS BACON (1561-1626) writes of sympathetic cures as follows:--\\\"It is constantly Received, and Avouched, that the *Anointing* of the *Weapon*, that maketh the *Wound*, wil heale the *Wound* it selfe. In this *Experiment*, upon the Relation of *Men of Credit*, (though my selfe, as yet, am not fully inclined to beleeve it,) you shal note the *Points* following; First, the *Ointment* . . . is made of Divers *ingredients*; whereof the Strangest and Hardest to come by, are the Mosse upon the *Skull* of a *dead Man, Vnburied*; And the *Fats* of a *Boare*, and a *Beare*, killed in the *Act of Generation*.  These Two last I could easily suspect to be prescribed as a Starting Hole; That if the *Experiment* proved not, it mought be pretended, that the *Beasts* were not killed in due Time; For as for the *Mosse*, it is certain there is great Quantity of it in *Ireland*, upon *Slain Bodies*, laid on *Heaps, Vnburied*.  The other *Ingredients* are, the *Bloud-Stone* in *Powder*, and some other *Things*, which seeme to have a *Vertue* to *Stanch Bloud*; As also the *Mosse* hath.... Secondly, the same *kind* of *Ointment*, applied to the Hurt it selfe, worketh not the *Effect*; but onely applied to the *Weapon*..... Fourthly, it may be applied to the *Weapon*, though the Party Hurt be at a great Distance.  Fifthly, it seemeth the *Imagination* of the Party, to be *Cured*, is not needful! to Concurre; For it may be done without the knowledge of the *Party Wounded*; And thus much hath been tried, that the *Ointment* (for *Experiments* sake,) hath been wiped off the *Weapon*, without the knowledge of the *Party Hurt*, and presently the *Party Hurt*, hath been in great *Rage of Paine*, till the *Weapon* was *Reannointed*.  Sixthly, it is affirmed, that if you cannot get the *Weapon*, yet if you put an *Instrument* of *Iron*, or *Wood*, resembling the *Weapon*, into the *Wound*, whereby it bleedeth, the *Annointing* of that *Instrument* will serve, and work the *Effect*.  This I doubt should be a Device, to keep this strange *Forme of Cure*, in Request, and Use; Because many times you cannot come by the *Weapon* it selve.  Seventhly, the *Wound* be at first *Washed clean* with *White Wine* or the *Parties* own *Water*; And then bound up close in *Fine Linen* and no more *Dressing* renewed, till it be *whole*.\\\"\\\\[1\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] FRANCIS BACON:  *Sylva Sylvarum:  or, A Natural History . . . Published after the Authors death . . . The sixt Edition* ?. . (1651), p.  217.\\n\\nOwing to the demand for making this ointment, quite a considerable trade was done in skulls from Ireland upon which moss had grown owing to their exposure to the atmosphere, high prices being obtained for fine specimens.\\n\\nThe idea underlying the belief in the efficacy of sympathetic remedies, namely, that by acting on part of a thing or on a symbol of it, one thereby acts magically on the whole or the thing symbolised, is the root-idea of all magic, and is of extreme antiquity. DIGBY and others, however, tried to give a natural explanation to the supposed efficacy of the Powder.  They argued that particles of the blood would ascend from the bloody cloth or weapon, only coming to rest when they had reached their natural home in the wound from which they had originally issued. These particles would carry with them the more volatile part of the vitriol, which would effect a cure more readily than when combined with the grosser part of the vitriol. In the days when there was hardly any knowledge of chemistry and physics, this theory no doubt bore every semblance of truth. In passing, however, it is interesting to note that DIGBY'S *Discourse* called forth a reply from J. F. HELVETIUS (or SCHWETTZER, 1625-1709), physician to the Prince of Orange, who afterwards became celebrated as an alchemist who had achieved the magnum opus.\\\\[1\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] See my *Alchemy:  Ancient and Modern* (1911), SESE 63-67.\\n\\nWriting of the Sympathetic Powder, Professor DE MORGAN wittily argues that it must have been quite efficacious.  He says: \\\"The directions were to keep the wound clean and cool, and to take care of diet, rubbing the salve on the knife or sword. If we remember the dreadful notions upon drugs which prevailed, both as to quantity and quality, we shall readily see that any way of NOT dressing the wound would have been useful. If the physicians had taken the hint, had been careful of diet, *etc*., and had poured the little barrels of medicine down the throat of a practicable doll, THEY would have had their magical cures as well as the surgeons.\\\"\\\\[2\\\\] As Dr PETTIGREW has pointed out,\\\\[3\\\\] Nature exhibits very remarkable powers in effecting the healing of wounds by adhesion, when her processes are not impeded. In fact, many cases have been recorded in which noses, ears, and fingers severed from the body have been rejoined thereto, merely by washing the parts, placing them in close continuity, and allowing the natural powers of the body to effect the healing. Moreover, in spite of BACON'S remarks on this point, the effect of the imagination of the patient, who was usually not ignorant that a sympathetic cure was to be attempted, must be taken into account; for, without going to the excesses of \\\"Christian Science\\\" in this respect, the fact must be recognised that the state of the mind exercises a powerful effect on the natural forces of the body, and a firm faith is undoubtedly helpful in effecting the cure of any sort of ill.\\n\\n\\\\[2\\\\] Professor AUGUSTUS DE MORGAN:  *A Budget of Paradoxes* (1872), p 66.\\n\\n\\\\[3\\\\] THOMAS JOSEPH PETTIGREW, F.R.S.: *On Superstitions connected with the History and Practice of Medicine and Surgery* (1844), pp.  164-167.\\n\\nVI\\n\\nTHE BELIEF IN TALISMANS\\n\\nTHE word \\\"talisman\\\" is derived from the Arabic \\\"tilsam,\\\" \\\"a magical image,\\\" through the plural form \\\"tilsamen.\\\" This Arabic word is itself probably derived from the Greek telesma in its late meaning of \\\"a religious mystery\\\" or \\\"consecrated object\\\". The term is often employed to designate amulets in general, but, correctly speaking, it has a more restricted and special significance.  A talisman may be defined briefly as an astrological or other symbol expressive of the influence and power of one of the planets, engraved on a sympathetic stone or metal (or inscribed on specially prepared parchment) under the auspices of this planet.\\n\\nBefore proceeding to an account of the preparation of talismans proper, it will not be out of place to notice some of the more interesting and curious of other amulets.  All sorts of substances have been employed as charms, sometimes of a very unpleasant nature, such as dried toads.  Generally, however, amulets consist of stones, herbs, or passages from Sacred Writings written on paper. This latter class are sometimes called \\\"characts,\\\" as an example of which may be mentioned the Jewish phylacteries.\\n\\nEvery precious stone was supposed to exercise its own peculiar virtue; for instance, amber was regarded as a good remedy for throat troubles, and agate was thought to preserve from snake-bites. ELIHU RICH\\\\[1\\\\] gives a very full list of stones and their supposed virtues. Each sign of the zodiac was supposed to have its own particular stone\\\\[2\\\\] (as shown in the annexed table), and hence the superstitious though not inartistic custom of wearing one's birth-\\n\\nMonth (com-Astro- mencing Sign of the Zodiac.  logical 21st of Stone.

The belief in the occult powers of certain stones is by no means non-existent at the present day; for even in these enlightened times there are not wanting those who fear the beautiful opal, and put their faith in the virtues of New Zealand green-stone.\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] ELTHU RICH:  *The Occult Sciences (Encyclopaedia Metropolitana*, 1855), pp.  348 *et seq*.\\n\\n\\\\[2\\\\] With regard to these stones, however, there is much confusion and difference of opinion.  The arrangement adopted in the table here given is that of CORNELIUS AGRIPPA (*Occult Philosophy*, bk. ii.). A comparatively recent work, esteemed by modern occultists, namely, *The Light of Egypt, or the Science of the Soul and the Stars* (1889), gives the following scheme:--\\n\\n{}=Amethyst. {}=Emerald. {}=Diamond. {}=Onyx (Chalcedony).\\n\\n{}=Agate. {}=Ruby. {}=Topaz. {}=Sapphire (skyblue).\\n\\n{}=Beryl. {}=Jasper. {}=Carbuncle. {}=Chrysolite.\\n\\nCommon superstitious opinion regarding birth-stones, as reflected, for example, in the \\\"lucky birth charms\\\" exhibited in the windows of the jewellers' shops, considerably diverges in this matter from the views of both these authorities. The usual scheme is as follows:--\\n\\nJan.=Garnet.  May =Emerald.  Sept. =Sapphire,  Feb.=Amethyst.     June=Agate.         Oct. =Opal.  Mar.=Bloodstone.   July =Ruby.         Nov.=Topaz.  Apr.=Diamond. Aug.=Sardonyx. Dec. =Turquoise.\\n\\nThe bloodstone is frequently assigned either to Aries or Scorpio, owing to its symbolical connection with Mars; and the opal to Cancer, which in astrology is the constellation of the moon.\\n\\nConfusion is rendered still worse by the fact that the ancients whilst in some cases using the same names as ourselves, applied them to different stones; thus their \\\"hyacinth\\\" is our \\\"sapphire,\\\" whilst their \\\"sapphire\\\" is our \\\"lapis lazuli\\\".\\n\\nCertain herbs, culled at favourable conjunctions of the planets and worn as amulets, were held to be very efficacious against various diseases.  Precious stones and metals were also taken internally for the same purpose--\\\"remedies\\\" which in certain cases must have proved exceedingly harmful. One theory put forward for the supposed medical value of amulets was the Doctrine of Effluvia.  This theory supposes the amulets to give off vapours or effluvia which penetrate into the body and effect a cure.  It is, of course, true that certain herbs, *etc*., might, under the heat of the body, give off such effluvia, but the theory on the whole is manifestly absurd. The Doctrine of Signatures, which we have already encountered in our excursions,\\\\[1\\\\] may also be mentioned in this connection as a complementary and equally untenable hypothesis.\",\"timestamp\":1641298258,\"title\":\"\\nAMONGST the most remarkable of natural occurrences must be included many of the phenomena\"},\"digest\":\"yhTk9Tkvj5sLkG2HoB1gkiOtB74gvZHwMklY3YC43L0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x667E6054E728f4dC76df3f0F3c9c6bf23c751e8a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"poFSYrhfsZxUAFDiQBRg4DGdnJJIsr8uXBBJL2A-OHo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gUvhYEGFIn_GrsUBpmhDM2f2RSAEsAr5AIbbzLHDLnk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"K70shu7ITcrEJ_kX_nHJLMIV5uRJfHsU8kgF8PuAAc1wNl4eRkDFJS1SLQy8dKtVBSdSDrhh4o-lTDeBee-9-A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x46aa50d5f8f0291e0840b5c2458abe3e23b3c835a5edfb143895596150edd8c2014ea257c007c815a4293807679569f1fa38905efc3c44225f052413575e5b8e1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"poFSYrhfsZxUAFDiQBRg4DGdnJJIsr8uXBBJL2A-OHo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gUvhYEGFIn_GrsUBpmhDM2f2RSAEsAr5AIbbzLHDLnk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"yhTk9Tkvj5sLkG2HoB1gkiOtB74gvZHwMklY3YC43L0\"}"
