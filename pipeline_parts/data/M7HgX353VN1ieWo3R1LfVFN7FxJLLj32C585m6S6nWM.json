"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Key Takeaways**\\n\\n* Web3 and the ownership economy create a model that allows users to become empowered users, or agents, which contribute and add value to the platform\\n* Hybrid token models are sharing the value created within the platform, with users that contributed to it through the issuance of tokens. The users then become stakeholders in the platform\\n* If under-appreciated users created network effects, agents will create exponential hyper-network effects\\n* Cracking the right token model and allowing users to enjoy the value creation can unleash wild growth opportunities in Web3\\n\\n### The hybrid token model\\n\\nAn increasing number of web 3 startups are choosing a hybrid token and equity model. This new model is a new and exciting primitive in web 3, and it allows for protocols, dapps, centralized companies, and startups to share the value creation that was historically shareholder exclusive, with users and participants of the protocol.\\n\\nHybrid tokens ‘curve-out’ equity value to additional stakeholders, allowing them to enjoy the success of the platform. The main idea around a hybrid model is to create a token that has a utility within the platform. The token is not a security and is not eligible to profits the company makes, but rather enables different kinds of interactions within the platform such as voting on feature changes, discounts on platform fees (e.g. lower fees in exchanges), or platform participation. Although the token is not eligible to profit rights as equity, it also enjoys a growing demand as the product/platform succeeds.\\n\\nHybrid models solve so of the misalignment between early users and the platform. Web aggregators such as social networks use early users to build the network, putting a lot of work, enthusiasm and actively building and contributing to it. When you invited friends to Facebook in 2008 you expanded the network. When you shared an image or wrote a blog post you expanded the network. These early users are the reason this network could scale and all of us can enjoy it today. Hybrid tokens are about sharing that value creation with them and about alignment.\\n\\n### From users to agents\\n\\nHybrid models incentivize users to become agents of the platform. They know that if the platform succeeds, they might enjoy an economic upside on the token they are holding. In many cases, this is connected to some kind of decentralization of the product/ network.\\n\\nHybrid models can solve a lot of the problems that are familiar with web 2 apps, like an incentive for central platforms to use the [attract and extract](https://youtu.be/rW8GrxQYPbI?t=42) model or monetize users’ data.\\n\\nEarly users are incentivized to become power users, help the platform grow, and acts as its best agent. This model is in essence much fairer towards users because it rewards the loyal users that helped to build success and believed in the project from the early days.\\n\\n### Incentive Alignment Creates Hyper Network Effect\\n\\nIf I knew that I hold an asset that is correlated to the success of the platform, what would I do as a user?\\n\\nAn early Facebook user would probably invite all of his friends, share a ton of content and images, and will be really excited about the growth of the network. So tokens allow for network growth, much faster than the regular network effect we know. This is what we call a ‘hyper network effect’.\\n\\n### Some examples\\n\\nUsing a hybrid approach can have different forms. We would like to point out a few examples, that although are essentially different, all share the same idea that users can participate in the success of the project without owning equity, but rather other digital assets that make them stakeholders.\\n\\n[Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/) is a play-to-earn digital game in which users can earn by playing and participating in the Axie universe, inspired by Pokémon. Users can use their Axis to battle other users and earn ERC-20 tokens (‘Smooth Love Potions’), breed their Axis, or sell them on the market. The mix of users being able to play, trade and earn, combined with addictive game dynamics, has brought Axie revenues to explode through the roof, with $330B in protocol revenues until today (yes, 330 billion dollars). Instead of the founders building a centralized marketplace and controlling the Axie universe, they have opened it up so users can enjoy the tremendous growth throughout playing, earning, or just speculating. This approach has shared the amazing Axie Infinity universe growth with day-to-day users, creating a recursive cycle of highly engaged users.\\n\\n[Rally](https://rally.io/) is a social tokens platform on which different creators can issue their own social tokens. The social token is used by creators for direct engagement with their audience, create unique gated content, and helping creators build their own monetization channel. The Rally token, RLY, serves as the beating heart of this creator economy — users can purchase creator tokens using RLY, hold it, or stake them in DeFi protocols and earn yield.\\n\\nRally platform constantly encourages users to participate and support creators, by airdropping them with RLY tokens when buying and holding creator tokens. The airdropped RLY tokens can be used to purchase and support more creator tokens and earn more RLY in turn — a participate-to-earn model, turning users into highly engaged agents.\\n\\n[ZED RUN](https://zed.run/) is a digital horse racing game in which users can buy horses on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/zed-run-official). The horses are ERC-20 tokens that are fully transferable and tradable as digital assets, plus they can be bred with other horses so the owner can earn fees on breeding.\\n\\nWhile these NFTs are part of participation in the game (you need a horse to participate in a race), users of the platform get exposure to its success by buying and breeding digital horses. This can create an addictive participation cycle that makes users ultra engaged.\\n\\n### Questions when issuing a hybrid token model\\n\\nWhen designing a hybrid token approach within your platform, some key important questions to ask are -\\n\\n* Are we issuing tokens in a way that encourages users to participate?\\n* Are we transforming users into agents? will they be incentivized to grow the platform?\\n* Can early users be exposed to the major upside? How can we help them become long-term stakeholders?\\n* Are we generous to our users? How can we share our success with them?\\n\\n### This is just the beginning\\n\\nHybrid models are still in the exploration phase but can be a powerful tool both for startups as a growth hacking tool and both for the users that can enjoy the success of the platform through token price appreciation.\\n\\nWe believe slicing the traditional equity value to different stakeholders tiers (which are not just shareholders and early investors) is one of the strongest primitives in web3 and crypto, and can create user alignment in a way that was not possible before.\\n\\nSome cynics will try to claim this as a sophisticated way to disguise security. This is a complete misunderstanding of a new financial primitive that is not classified under stocks/bonds/commodities.\\n\\nHybrid models are around creating a rich space of digital assets, which are programmable and play different roles within the digital economy. This is a brand new design space, and we can’t wait to see what’s coming up next. \\n\\n(Written with the help of Eylon Aviv)\",\"timestamp\":1635413110,\"title\":\"Hybrid equity & tokens models in web 3\"},\"digest\":\"cTm78RNlLDcQpIfCHMA2F7kR9JI1fNNNFvy4HBlkGfM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x461bb1c0c23C0AE24805C4097Bc5B64593Dd2a59\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"62IxSRPmqW139p7RpEG-xlZ9NAxoqD8u9YA5W_Gm0Cc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mJG2Rm2TlRPJm0rswhSaGk4Y8BGnEIVMS_oE1E-5two\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"nAclqyIn-B2a2Ttw1PGPgggnooqIe56xhz42raFSgrG42NyGYk6h_vv0ttHiJhUMwKK3PnxZTnz9_4Lo8rw-UA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x600b461dd087cc9203a3bfe46faa2e8c7b6b08c23afc016c9cdb4e3de2c793ec4731a2d2066d0fe96360227c54c8cb201f7bb6def706cfb75047a4eb1337cfe31c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"62IxSRPmqW139p7RpEG-xlZ9NAxoqD8u9YA5W_Gm0Cc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mJG2Rm2TlRPJm0rswhSaGk4Y8BGnEIVMS_oE1E-5two\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"cTm78RNlLDcQpIfCHMA2F7kR9JI1fNNNFvy4HBlkGfM\"}"
