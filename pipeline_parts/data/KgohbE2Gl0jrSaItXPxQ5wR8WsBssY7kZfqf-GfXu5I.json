We think that our global footprint because of our colonies, we have brought many influences from all over the world back to our home country.\\n\\nSpices from India, rice from Asia, beans from Africa, fruits from Brazil, and many other ingredients that mother nature, cultures, and people offer to us, we have had at our core the gratitude and appreciation for making anyone that meets the Portuguese culture feel at home and being saluted with a cozy warmness and golden colors that only our beautiful Mediterranean homeland has to offer.\\n\\nThis is what our souls are born within Portugal.\\n\\nAnd we believe that Web3 and the Metaverse have these beliefs at the core of its revolution.\\n\\nPassion, safety, transparency, belief, community, culture, equality, and empathy are some of the values that this transformational time has brought to us.\\n\\nWe are taking the leap to create the first Metaverse-based hospitality brand, to compete with established centralized global brands in the coffee and food space.\\n\\nImagine this:\\n\\nImagine that 40 or 60 years ago, you were able to be part of McDonald’s or Starbucks?\\n\\nBy being part we mean, by believing and participating in the creation of the cheeseburger, big mac, cappuccino, store design, branding, coloring, all of it.\\n\\nImagine even that the cheeseburger was first created as an NFT, and that the whole imagery, concept, look and feel of the burger would be ideated within its first community of believers.\\n\\nImagine that you could actually buy that cheeseburger as an NFT, and have a small royalty so that every time that cheeseburger gets sold you’d get a percentage for being one of the first believers.\\n\\nOn the other hand, leading hospitality experiences from the most famous brands you know, prime their in-store experiences. Although they struggle to have the ideation floor, and validate their engagement with their potential first believers, because of the cost, logistics, and infrastructure required.\\n\\nEnvision, that now you could actually visualize your next favorite hospitality brand in the Metaverse, interact with it, and eventually see that idea come into real life.\\n\\nOh, hi.\\n\\n**Meet NATA$ World.**\\n\\n![Keep reading to learn more about NATA$ first NFT collection](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bNqfr5cnGPmiCei1c6-D2.png?height=1800&width=1800&&&&&size=large)\\n\\nNATA$ World is the first auto-generated hospitality experience born in the Metaverse.\\n\\nThe NATA$ World features in its launch a collection of NFTs, a Metaverse, and a DAO  that will allow members to be part of what is the most transformational brand in its category. MacDonalds, Starbucks, and many other category-defining brands in the sector have had in its foundation a set of key products and a group of superfans (evangelists) that have led these brands to the four corners of the world.\\n\\nNATA$ World wants to do the same by using the most innovative NFT, and Defi Mechanics for its whole product creation, store ideation, and customer engagement, that will co-exist both in the Metaverse and in real life.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Our vision,**\\n\\nOur vision is that anyone can own all things related to the NATA$ World ecosystem, and be an active contributor to the growth and strategy of the brand.\\n\\nAs an example the product line auto-created in an NFT will allow (for the first time in the history of hospitality), anyone to own that product as an NFT and also a small royalty directly associated with that product, so that anytime that product is sold the NFT owner makes a partial royalty.\\n\\nThis will be the biggest economical shift, where super fans will become the driving force of brand expansion and customer success.\\n\\nNATA$ World will be at the intersection of a futuristic, dreamy, and wonderland look that will make it’s members and guests comfortable within its environment and become the hub where the daring come together experiencing the most unique gastronomical and hospitality experiences ever both online and in real life.\\n\\nWe want NATA$ World to be a community-driven brand. For this purpose we want anyone to own a piece of NATA$ World and help us decide the future of the brand, vote in the product, financial, and company decisions, and strategize the expansion of NATA$ World.\\n\\nWe believe that by creating a DAO we can build a long-lasting community, where members come together both in the NATA$ World Metaverse and in real life, and enjoy the perks associated with their token holdership, and help with the over-arching strategy of the brand.\\n\\n```\\n  <nft-card\\n    contractAddress=\\\"0x0322f6f11a94cfb1b5b6e95e059d8deb2bf17d6a\\\"\\n    tokenId=\\\"6784\\\">\\n    </nft-card>\\n    <script src=\\\"https://unpkg.com/embeddable-nfts/dist/nft-card.min.js\\\"></script>\\n```\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n**First NFT Collection**\\n\\n`The Natas`\\n\\nNATA$ will become the defining pastry for the NATA$ World DAO and for the whole crypto and blockchain ecosystem.\\n\\nInterestingly enough one of the most vibrant ecosystems in crypto has been growing in Lisbon, Portugal, and our vision is that this pastry represents the celebration of the best of this revolution, and brings us together through an unforgettable trip to ancient times. Something made with love, care, and joy.\\n\\n![NATAS NFT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DyOCzjty4Zy_CiChUUGLT.png?height=1800&width=1800)\\n\\n`The Rooster`\\n\\nThe rooster represents the “Galo de Barcelos”.\\n\\nThe story goes back to the inhabitants of Barcelos who were alarmed by a crime, of which the criminal who had committed it had not yet been discovered.\\n\\nOne day, a Galician man appeared who became a suspect. The authorities decided to arrest him, despite his oaths of innocence, that he was just passing through on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, in fulfillment of a promise, he was sentenced to death. The man asked to be brought before the judge who had sentenced him.\\n\\nAuthorization was granted, they took him to the magistrate's residence, who at that time was feasting with some friends. The Galician man once again affirmed his innocence and, faced with the incredulity of those present, he pointed to a roast rooster that was on the table and exclaimed:\\n\\n\\\"It's so right that I'm innocent, how right is this cock to sing when they hang me!\\n\\nThe judge pushed his plate aside and ignored the appeal, but when the pilgrim was being hanged, the rooster rose on the table and started singing.\\n\\nUnderstanding his mistake, the judge ran to the gallows and found that the Galician man had been saved thanks to a poorly made knot. The man was immediately released and sent in peace. After some time, the Galo de Barcelos was made and the case was declared closed.\\n\\nThis NFT will be usable on the NATA$ world metaverse in a 3D character, and will feature justice, empathy, and hope that in this world there are always two ways of seeing one situation, and within our community, we must choose love and altruism.\\n\\n![The NATAS Character ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Hb56X9VRsObqnnBe3fNAT.png?height=1800&width=1800)\\n\\n`The Land`\\n\\nThe land allows any NFT holder to hold a plot of land of nearly 50 meters by 50 meters within the NATA$ World Metaverse, allowing NATA$ World NFT holders or Token holders to develop their businesses, and communities within the NATA$ World Metaverse\\\\*\\\\*.\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n![NATAS World plot of land](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mpju41YNX3tfUucag6FzY.png?height=1800&width=1800)\\n\\n`The burgers`\\n\\nThe burgers represent our first experiment to develop an auto-generated worldwide loved product, with the most healthy and high-quality ingredients ever done in a burger.\\n\\nWe want the whole product line of NATA$ World to be gluten-free, dairy-free, and use other alternatives to sugar such as Stevia.\\n\\nBurgers will also be used as a feeder for characters to play in NATA$ World Metaverse.\\n\\n![NATAS World Burger](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FJ2cqt2ju0QmAFLX7g9zU.png?height=2560&width=2560)\\n\\n`The juices`\\n\\nThe juices will delight NFT holders with magic potions that can be used within the NATA$ World Metaverse to feed their characters, and create new mutations within the rooster they own.\\n\\nThe juices also will be sold in real-life stores and will feature the healthiest and most natural ingredients to help human enhancement, immunity, great digestive systems, and overall health.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n**The NATA$ World Metaverse**\\n\\n![Outside wonderland of NATA$ World Metaverse](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U5mKlN6TvFSNpUMVE2DE4.jpeg?height=695&width=1280)\\n\\nThe Metaverse is where community members, NFT holders, DAO token holders, and all the others that participate in the vibrant ecosystem of the NATA$ World will meet.\\n\\nIdeas will float, and creations will emerge, that will serve as the floor for imagination for the most innovative in real-life hospitality experiences.\\n\\n![Hospitality area in NATA$ World Metaverse featuring a futuristic look combined with a dome illustrating the Portuguese discoveries](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lqMEMjSesmeTco3_NsW-N.jpeg?height=664&width=1280)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n**The first believers**\\n\\n**Jason Carvalho,**  co-founder, and CEO is one of the most successful international Portuguese hospitality entrepreneurs that launched one of the first Natas stores in Toronto, Canada, and has generated over $1MM in annual sales in Natas during a global pandemic.\\n\\nFeatured in all major Portuguese media outlets, when announcing the NATA$ World project, Jason has been acclaimed by the Portuguese government as one of the most innovative projects in its category.\\n\\n**Antonio Trincao** -
