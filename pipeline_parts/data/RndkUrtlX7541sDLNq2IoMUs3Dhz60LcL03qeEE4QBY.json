"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**All Eyes Are On You**\\n\\nAs we are finding our way back to “normal,” now may be an excellent time to consider how we will present the *new* version of ourselves to the rest of the world through our apparel, through a men’s makeover, a man’s style “level up”; The Man’s Glow Up.\\n\\nThis does not mean going out to buy a whole new wardrobe. This does not mean recreating your wardrobe to mimic James Bond. It can mean slowly introducing new items to it that reflects ***your personal style***. Some of us have no choice to buy new clothes because we have picked up a few quarantine pounds and need to size up. While shopping for that size up, we can also shop for designs and brands that we have never worn before and *change* clothes. We can gradually *change the style* of clothes we buy to match our new vibe. We need to be confident in how we present ourselves to the rest of the world.\\n\\n> ***There is nothing sexier or more attractive than confidence. — Tom Ford***\\n\\nShopping does not need to be a task. We should be **strategic**, or else we can waste our hard-earned money. You can start by learning the basics from the best here:\\n\\n**Fellas, here is how to style and re-invent yourself strategically:**\\n\\n**STEP 1: Assign yourself a style.**\\n\\nWe can start by looking inside and understanding ourselves. What is your personality? Are you classic and reserved, artistic, sporty, casual, business-like, a logo-lover? Once we know our personality, we can look to stylists and fashion designers who align with our style for inspiration. Masterclass assigns [eight general categories](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/types-of-fashion-styles?) to style (Sporty, Bohemian, Preppy, Grunge, Punk, Streetwear, Classic, and Casual). Do your research to understand your fit.\\n\\n**STEP 2: Be realistic about your budget.**\\n\\nThe fashion goal should not be to look like a billboard full of expensive designer logos, but rather to express your personality and look “well put together,” clean and neat, according to your version of “style.” You can be well put together in luxury/expensive, midrange, or inexpensive clothing. You can look well put together in casual, streetwear, sportswear, or a suit. Just be neat and clean. Expression of individuality is what makes style and fashion fun. Buy items that help express your unique personality and that are in your price range.\\n\\n**Men’s fashion budgets will fall into three (3) categories:**\\n\\n**(1) Luxury Fashion** ([Hugo Boss](https://www.hugoboss.com/us/men/), [Brunello Cucinelli](https://shop.brunellocucinelli.com/en-us/men-collection.html), [Ralph Lauren (Purple Label)](https://www.ralphlauren.com/brands-purple-label), [Gucci](https://www.gucci.com/us/en/), [Salvatore Ferragamo](https://www.ferragamo.com/shop/us/en/men), [Hermes](https://www.hermes.com/), [Bottega Veneta](https://www.bottegaveneta.com/en-us)), **(2)** **Midrange** ([J Crew](https://www.jcrew.com/), [Calvin Klein](https://www.calvinklein.us/en), [Kenneth Cole](https://www.kennethcole.com/), [Brooks Brothers](https://www.brooksbrothers.com/), [Under Armour](https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/c/mens/), [Nike](https://www.nike.com/men), [Banana Republic](https://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/category.do?cid=13846&tid=brps015991&kwid=1&ap=7&gclid=bd501f3a2f2e120427b37eb2566edbc5&gclsrc=3p.ds&msclkid=bd501f3a2f2e120427b37eb2566edbc5&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=BAN_BR-X_US_Men%27s_Clothing_DCM_CVR_X_Exact_X&utm_term=bananarepublic%20mens%20clothing&utm_content=BAN_BR_US_Men%27s_Clothing#)), and **(3) Fast Fashion** ([Men’s Warehouse](https://www.menswearhouse.com/), [Express](https://www.express.com/mens-clothing), [Zara](https://www.zara.com/us/en/woman-new-in-l1180.html), [H&M](https://www2.hm.com/en_us/men.html)).\\n\\n**Looking for Luxury at Discount?:** [Shop Saks Off 5th](https://www.saksoff5th.com/)\\n\\n**STEP 3: Align your style to a brand and influencer to stay current.**\\n\\nEach brand caters to a specific consumer personality. For example, Hermes and Banana are “classic,” Ralph Lauren and Hugo Boss are “elegant,” J Crew and Brooks Brothers may be seen as “preppy,” and Kenneth Cole and Under Armour or Nike may be seen as “casual” or “sporty.” Bottega and Zara are more “artistic/edgy” may be viewed as “bohemian,” and Gucci may be seen as disco and “street style.” Note that “**[bespoke](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bespoke)**” means custom and tailor-made.\\n\\nChoosing a brand or designer that speaks your style and shopping on-brand streamline your fashion research. Pick a brand from each price range that suits your style, and voila! Each season, refresh. The brand evolves with you.\\n\\n**[Stylists and influencers ](https://medium.com/tcg-by-mbmm/8-global-men-to-improve-your-style-dc3309c2e423)**also do the work of researching trends and staying on top of developments in style. Some are celebrities that are mailed items by brands to promote. Others, stylists by trade, attend the men’s fashion shows in New York (or, in the case of Italy, **[Pitti Uomo](https://www.gq.com/story/what-is-pitti-uomo-anyway))** and report on what they see in their social media posts.\",\"timestamp\":1637019212,\"title\":\"The Man “Glow Up”\"},\"digest\":\"wKhnsFqtQhBjMz-3XrvSFFuTXE2Au7oRWXL5tXRAZxA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xE25Fe6B82f4F46B9a653a05Dd60986a3B61D2988\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"OyWE_zdJa7c_W2ftGcxlpdIrdAA8vSjKZlVamPIG17E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1xbLGQmE8bDUaqpXCHAuvB7Gbn1ENPlCmnJfIk3TSps\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"YH0R1NQjlQwtf8aDl7ydppLndmHllPEA8EHBnQhcvaVnI3PL-58s3P061G6_wy37_qiPxBHqPeu6EKzvFhonvw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x032267969b9eaec4b10f92e2fdad55abd2571b67ea5f2c09590055ac1d9a86dc0b61c703943b5f24e09fed4fcb933685120b03a190808638527dd0fd9cf60aca1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"OyWE_zdJa7c_W2ftGcxlpdIrdAA8vSjKZlVamPIG17E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1xbLGQmE8bDUaqpXCHAuvB7Gbn1ENPlCmnJfIk3TSps\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wKhnsFqtQhBjMz-3XrvSFFuTXE2Au7oRWXL5tXRAZxA\"}"
