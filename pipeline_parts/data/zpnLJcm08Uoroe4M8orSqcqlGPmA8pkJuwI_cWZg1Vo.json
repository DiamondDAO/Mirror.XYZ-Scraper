"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*ZsTGIehMGjyv2cTL.jpg)\\n\\nHey friends 👋\\n\\nWelcome to the first ever issue of **[Know Your Coin](https://mirror.xyz/thumbsupfinance.eth/utrrjpJbOtEQlYXpZGMBxh9X7iQBPBBLx9RKl-NqnNs)**, the series where I’ll explain the idea behind (and the potential value of) various cryptocurrency projects 👨‍🏫\\n\\nAt the time of writing there are over 4000 cryptocurrencies in circulation, but don’t read too much into that number as it’s relatively easy to create a new token, and only a few hundred at most offer real, long term value 📈 Of those, we’re going to be digging into the ones I find the most interesting.\\n\\nSo I thought to myself, what better place to start than with the closest parallel to our existing fiat money: stablecoins 💵\\n\\n## What are stablecoins?\\n\\n**[Stablecoins](https://ethereum.org/en/stablecoins/)** are basically digitally currency. Imagine a token that’s **valued 1:1 to the US dollar**, or the **[Canadian dollar](https://www.trusttoken.com/products)**, or the \\\\*\\\\*[British Pound ](https://www.trusttoken.com/products)\\\\*\\\\*💷 The idea that the coins are always held closely to this value (or “pegged”) offers a few distinct features not found in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Allow me to explain.\\n\\nStable coins offer… well… stability 😐\\n\\nYou may have noticed that with inflation there is not much incentive to save money under your mattress or even in **[most savings accounts](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/what-is-the-average-savings-account-interest-rate)**, because the money will lose buying power at a more rapid rate than it can provide returns.\\n\\nThis leads to a market incentive to buy other asset classes, including stocks, bonds, gold, other rare metals, commodities, and of course property. This is **[also an incentive to buy Bitcoin](https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2021/05/02/from-lumber-to-tips-to-bitcoin-12-inflation-hedging-investment-moves/?sh=30939160593f)** or other deflationary assets, at least in theory 💰\\n\\nInterestingly though, the inverse is also true. **[If a currency is deflationary, there is a disincentive to spend it](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0311/the-dangers-of-deflation.aspx)**, knowing that by doing so, the thing you buy will never offer equivalent value to what you spent. Assuming that one day deflationary currency (let’s say Bitcoin) is the norm, one potential side effect is that people will be less interested in participating in stock markets and property ownership as the **[opportunity cost](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp)** of spending their Bitcoin will be harder to calculate. I don’t view either of these scenarios as a bad thing necessarily, but worthwhile consideration nonetheless 🤓\\n\\n## Stability, my dear Watson\\n\\nTo extend this idea just a bit further, I’ll ask one more question. What if we can’t say for sure that a cryptocurrency will increase or decrease in value consistently? What if it’s extremely volatile? 🎢\\n\\nAt this nascent stage of crypto, many currencies are volatile. In fact, that’s why they’re so popular with investors. The easiest way to make (or lose) a lot of money, is to invest in something risky 🎰 However, this once again disincentives the use as currency, because now every transaction is zero-sum. Either the payment I gave you will be worth more than what I received, or the payment you received will buy you less in the future ⚖️\\n\\nRemember I’m not inventing these scenarios, some businesses do accept Bitcoin, and some people do spend it. In the first **[Crypto Misadventures](https://medium.com/@thumbsupfinance.eth/crypto-misadventures-a-wallet-by-any-other-name-c17fec66d55c)**, I talked about Laszlo Hanyecz whose purchase of two pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoins in 2010 **[would now be worth over $300,000,000](https://bitcoinpizzaindex.net/)**. Laszlo doesn’t regret his decision, but some might. As such, the principle use for Bitcoin at the moment is as an investment, which many liken to gold, only “**[harder](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hardmoney.asp)**” as there is **[a truly capped supply](https://21mcap.com/)** 🙅‍♂️\\n\\nThe same people who might choose to invest in Bitcoin as “digital gold,” might prefer to spend something less volatile, or even — dare I say — *stable ✨*\\n\\nStablecoins are the natural step in moving our current fiat monetary system to the blockchain 🔗 They may be a mere stepping stone to decentralization, or they may continue to exist as a staple of a new, borderless, bankless monetary system. I’m not here to speculate on any of that; I’m here to talk about what stablecoins are and the many different kinds so that in a future post, I can show you some of the incredible ways you can use them to make money with decentralized finance (**[DeFi](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/thumbsupfinance/stake-cake)**) 🙌\\n\\n## Where do stablecoins get their stability?\\n\\nThat’s really the question I want to answer with this article. After all, anyone can say “this coin is worth 1 USD” but unless there’s consensus between the person who sends the dollar, the person who receives it, the next person who receives it, and so on down the line (including when trying to “cash out”), the whole thing falls apart 💥\\n\\nThe most common way to create a trusted stablecoin is to collateralize each coin 1:1 with actual fiat, held by a trust (a company), ideally in some sort of audited reserve at one or more banks 🏦 But that’s not the only way. More on that below…\\n\\n## Fiat-collateralized Stablecoins\\n\\nYou may have heard of **[Tether](https://tether.to/)**, aka **USDT**. Tether is basically the OG stablecoin, originally launching on the Bitcoin blockchain via the **[Omni protocol](https://www.omnilayer.org/)**. Now ported to basically every major blockchain, Tether enjoys the highest level of acceptance in the DeFi space. However, not everyone trusts Tether. In 2019, **[the New York Attorney General filed a lawsuit against Tether](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2019/attorney-general-james-announces-court-order-against-crypto-currency-company)** accusing the company of misappropriating funds. The lawsuit was settled out of court for $18.5M but questions have repeatedly come up about Tether’s use of debt to collateralize their issuance, as well as their inconsistent self-reporting of their offshore reserves 😰\\n\\n**[USD Coin](https://www.coinbase.com/usdc)**, aka USDC is the second most popular stablecoin by market capitalization. Like Tether, it is fiat-collateralized, this time through a partnership between **[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/usdc)** and **[Circle](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc)**. Each dollar is held in the bank in a fully audited and monitored account 🏦\\n\\n**[Binance USD](https://www.binance.com/en/busd)** aka BUSD holds the third spot in terms of market cap. It is a 1:1 USD-backed stablecoin approved by the **[New York State Department of Finance Services (NYDFS)](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/)**, issued in partnership with Paxos. For those heavily invested in the **[Binance ecosystem](https://medium.com/binanceexchange/the-binance-ecosystem-beyond-the-cryptocurrency-exchange-c91602f8c6f3)**, this is probably going to be the preferred option, though most other stablecoins have been ported to Binance chain as well. In fact, one of the key features of BUSD, is that Binance does not charge a fee to convert from BUSD to USDT, USDC, TUSD, or PAX 🔥\\n\\n**[Gemeni dollar](https://www.gemini.com/dollar)**, aka GUSD is a particularly interesting fiat-backed stablecoin as it takes what USDC and BUSD do and goes one step further. Gemini is perhaps the most regulatory compliant and trusted cryptocurrency exchange in North America and their stablecoin is exactly as compliant as you’d expect. Like Binance, Gemeni’s coin is approved by the NYDFS, but unlike BUSD and USDC, GUSD reserves are backed by **[FDIC insurance of up to $250,000 per user](https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2010/pr10161.html)** 🙌 If you want to buy Gemini Dollar, there are absolutely no fees if you use Gemini, (**[use my referral for a $10 bonus](https://www.gemini.com/share/gr88wyz2x)**)\\n\\nThe biggest issue with all fiat-backed stablecoins is the same…\\n\\n## Centralized Risk\\n\\n**[FDIC insurance](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/)** exists because banks can go out of business. But when they go out of business, what happens to the funds? The answer **[before the 1930s](https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/bank-run)** was that all your money was gone. The solution came from Franklin D Roosevelt with his inauguration of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The FDIC, like the CDIC in Canada has banks pay a form of insurance on deposits they hold, such that a reasonable amount is protected for every depositor. Here’s an interesting anecdote from the FDIC’s 1998 report: **[A Brief History of Deposit Insurance in the United Sates](https://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/brief/index.html)**\\n\\n> *Federal deposit insurance became effective on January 1, 1934, providing depositors with $2,500 in coverage, and by any measure it was an immediate success in restoring public confidence and stability to the banking system. Only nine banks failed in 1934, compared to more than 9,000 in the preceding four years.*\\n\\nSo, the mere existence of deposit insurance helped to provide a tremendous amount of stability for consumers. And it cost them nothing, because the banks are required to pay for the insurance 👏 Yet, many banks do still fail. And not all banks are FDIC insured. And let’s not forget that only a certain amount of funds per client is protected (Up to $250,000 thanks to the **[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act)**)\\n\\nThat’s kind of the problem with fiat-backed stablecoins. There is always this one rather glaring point of failure: **centralization**.\\n\\nWith **Tether**, it’s their reserves: they are not independently audited, not held in the US, not FDIC insured, and while many consumers do trust Tether (as evident by its prominence), many do not.\\n\\nWith **USDC** and **BUSD** (and **[TUSD](https://www.trusttoken.com/trueusd)** among others), you have the benefits/disadvantages of it being held in the US including regulatory compliance and auditing, but also some might argue potential interference from the government or banks themselves.\\n\\nWith **Gemeni dollar (GUSD)** you have $250,000 of FDIC protection, but all that says is that if the custodian (State Street Bank and Trust) fails, Gemeni can get back $250,000 of your money for you. It won’t protect more, and it won’t protect you from any other risks of course like theft, or investment mistakes. I’m only mentioning that because some people don’t fully understand **[how deposit insurance works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBOFiDpmESI)** 🧑‍🏫\\n\\nIn my mind, solutions like GUSD are the most trustworthy among these fiat-backed options, however I do use all of the other stable coins I mentioned in various DeFi applications due to the higher demand for them, after all **[much of the returns in DeFi are based on demand](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/thumbsupfinance/stake-cake)** — more on that in a future post.\\n\\nBriefly, I just want to mention that there are stablecoins that are pegged to precious metals. **[Digix](https://digix.global/)**, **[Pax Gold](https://www.paxos.com/paxgold/)**, and **[Tether Gold](https://gold.tether.to/)** are such options. Many people lump these in with stablecoins which is why I mention them, but I personally feel that they are a different product altogether 🌗 I’ll also save my rant about how gold should be released to the market to find its natural value, improve technology, and bring down costs for consumers, and hard-capped crypto like Bitcoin should step in to serve that role as a store of value instead… for now…\\n\\nAnyways, onwards to the excited part: **alternatives to fiat-backed stablecoins**.\\n\\n## Dai Another Day\\n\\nWhat if anyone in the world could mint their own stablecoin? This was the question that **[MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/en/)** was seeking to answer with their Dai Stablecoin, also known as Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD)\\n\\nMCD allows users to deposit cryptocurrencies to create an overcollateralized loan against which DAI is minted and borrowed. This overcollateralization allows Maker to ensure that Dai can hold its peg even through wild swings. In March of 2020 however, extraordinary market volatility caused a deleveraging spiral that allowed Dai to reach $1.11 briefly and caused liquidation for a number of users. Maker responded quickly with changes to how the protocol handles liquidations and with the new MCD system which allows for collateral supply of other cryptocurrencies — instead of just Ether — including other stablecoins.\\n\\nNow, you might be thinking, “well isn’t MakerDAO just another centralized organization and therefore another potential point of failure?” Once upon a time the answer might have been yes. Maker Foundation was started and headquartered in Denmark, and had a CEO named Rune Christensen, but what’s important to note, is actually right there in the name. Maker is a **[Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/)**, and the DAO is (**[now completely](https://blog.makerdao.com/makerdao-has-come-full-circle/)**) separate from the Maker Foundation.\\n\\nThis means that Maker is not actually the maker (see what I did there 😏 ) of the rules. It is the holders of the Maker Governance Token (MKR) that decide on the implementation of proposals. And **you can become a token holder by buying** (or swapping for) MKR. You can do that **[here](https://web.newton.co/r/DOULTD)** 🇨🇦 or **[here](https://www.gemini.com/share/gr88wyz2x)** 🇺🇸\\n\\nI’ll write more about DAOs and their potential to reshape society as a whole, and especially business, in the future. But for now, I want you to know the **benefits and weaknesses of DAI ⚖️**\\n\\n## Benefits of Dai\\n\\n* Can be minted by anyone, anywhere, without opening accounts or doing **[KYC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knowyourclient.asp)**. We take it for granted in North America, but in many parts of the world anonymous access to cryptocurrency could be the only option to avoid persecution by oppressive governments, cartels, or extremist groups.\\n* **Your collateral, not theirs**. Unlike fiat-backed stablecoins, you don’t rely on a centralized holder of the currency. In the case of Gemini for example, you buy GUSD, then they deposit an equivalent amount in a bank account, and that bank holds it until such time that you sell GUSD back to Gemini. That level of abstraction (or “middlemen”) is what Peer-to-peer/Decentralized Finance aims to eliminate. Dai is created through a smart contract. Your loan is not held by MakerDAO, it is held in a protocol on the blockchain.\\n* **Dai is infinite**. Because you’re not worrying about exceeding the FDIC insurance cap, or trading dollars 1:1, you can create as much Dai as you want. And one day if the reserve currency of the world is no longer the US dollar, a stablecoin that pegs to that could be created in the same way.\\n\\n## Weaknesses of Dai\\n\\n* **Dai is not 1:1 collateralized**. As I mentioned above, Dai is minted via an overcollateralized loan. This means that unlike USDC for example where you spent $1 (USD) and get 1 USDC, with Dai, you will technically be putting in more collateral to mint Dai, though you can get back your collateral by repaying the loan. In fact some use this as a way to borrow stable assets against their Ether to go long.\\n* **Dai is not the most popular stablecoin**. Due in large part to institutional adoption of USDC and Tether, the market capitalization (at the time of writing) of Dai is 5 times less than that of USDC, and over 12 times less than USDT. This might lead some to choose not to invest in Dai, resulting in lesser demand. In the world of DeFi where much of the returns are based on trading fees or loan interest, demand is key to maximizing returns.\\n* **Deleveraging risk**. Although the protocol has been changed to dramatically reduce the risk of a deleveraging spiral like the one from March of 2020, the risk is not entirely eliminated. Those who prefer a 1:1 collateral ratio (based on fiat which is less volatile), may prefer to opt for fiat-backed stablecoins, or maybe a mix of options.\\n\\n## Algorithmic Stablecoins\\n\\nImagine a stable, currency-pegged token, that was bankless like Dai, but didn’t require overcollateralization. Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, so far, it has been. Every algorithmic stablecoin thus far has had its own controversy and chaos. In the second issue of **[Crypto Misadventures,](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/thumbsupfinance/crypto-misadventures-2)** I talked about how I got rekt taking a gamble on Iron Finance’s vision of an algorithmic stablecoin. In retrospect though, Iron’s approach had pretty obvious flaws that **[neither I, nor Mark Cuban took the time to study](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/mark-cuban-says-he-lost-money-trading-defi-token-titan-that-crashed-to-zero-2021-6-1030533245?op=1)** 🙈\\n\\nSince then, numerous algorithmic stablecoins have become popular and seem to be doing things right from what I can see. One of the most promising of these is UST which is part of the **[Terra](https://www.terra.money/)** ecosystem 🌎 The Terra ecosystem is really interesting as it’s rooted in algorithmic responses to supply and demand. Here’s a great video that explains the interplay between Terra stablecoins like UST and the protocol’s native currency, LUNA 👇\\n\\n[https://youtu.be/KqpGMoYZMhY](https://youtu.be/KqpGMoYZMhY)\\n\\nWant to learn more? Check out the **[Terra Whitepaper](https://assets.website-files.com/611153e7af981472d8da199c/618b02d13e938ae1f8ad1e45_Terra_White_paper.pdf)**.\\n\\nSo that’s one approach, but let’s check out another, more unconventional approach…\\n\\n**[Ampleforth](https://www.ampleforth.org/basics/)** is an algorithmic stablecoin relies on **supply elasticity**. Essentially it inflates or deflates every single day algorithmically to ensure stable value 🤯 Interestingly, and perhaps most importantly, it is **non-dilutive**, which means you are not buying a number of coins, but rather a percentage of the total. This means, as the supply shifts, your balance shifts to help the currency return to it’s peg.\\n\\nInterestingly Ampleforth, the peg is another place AMPL differs from other stablecoins. While most stablecoins aim to maintain a peg to the **current** **value** of the US dollar (or whatever fiat currency they’re pegged to), Ampleforth is now, and will (theoretically) be forever pegged to the value of the 2019 US dollar. Making this a truly stable currency, free even from the affects of inflation or deflation.\\n\\nThe team at Ampleforth argue that this stability makes AMPL the ideal currency for use in contracts as it is neither subject to market volatility or debasement 😯\\n\\nPretty interesting stuff if you ask me.\\n\\n## Other Interesting Approaches\\n\\nTo truly list every stablecoin as they come into existence would be a full-time job in and of itself. But there are two more that I want to to draw your attention to, both of which, I’ve actually written about before.\\n\\nIn my post **[Hello, Cello](https://medium.com/@thumbsupfinance.eth/hello-celo-f8157f908000)** I explain ambitious blockchain project and the native crypto-backed stablecoins which can even be used to pay network transaction fees. That post even tells you some great ways to earn income on the Celo Network, so you should check it out.\\n\\nI also wrote about an interesting, if somewhat hard-to-decipher project called Beanstalk. Beanstalk offers what it calls a credit-backed stablecoin that comes from an ecosystem with yield built in. Want to learn more? Check out **[this post](https://medium.com/@thumbsupfinance.eth/hey-friends-b997688023fe)** 🌱\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nStablecoins offer a way to move away from traditional finance (TradFi) towards DeFi. In this peer-to-peer system, middlemen can not obscure away huge profits and leave you with mere crumbs. DeFi offers returns unheard of at banks 💸 The caveat, one assumes, is that we trade these APYs for instability. But what if we didn’t have to?\\n\\nWhat if the first step in our journey towards building our own money is simply to build our own banks (or rather something better)? 🧐 If that’s true, then there will always be a place for a currency that holds its value in one way or another.\\n\\nWant to know how to get started in stablecoins? During a recent period of particular volatility, I shared some ideas that I think you’ll find interesting.
