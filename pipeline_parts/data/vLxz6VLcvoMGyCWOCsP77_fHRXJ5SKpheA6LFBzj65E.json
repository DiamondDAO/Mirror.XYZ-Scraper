We love you Saso and your work is insane! Congrats on the collab! Big things ahead‚Ä¶.\\n\\n> So a bunch of time ago (feels like forever because of how fast things move in web3) I got contacted by Stella, and she told me they're doing a collab with Fresh Couture, a brand I didn't know at they time. When I checked it out my jaw dropped, because it was kind of a big brand. Not bad for my first ever commission, but I nearly wasn't going to take it because I had 0 prior working experience in 3D, and this seemed crazy. However, I learned that it's not about the experience you have - if there is an opportunity presented to you and you have the time for that opportunity, then that's all that matters. You learn most of your skills on the job - Tania, Domingo and Midwestmisfit and I were supporting each other, giving feedback and I learned so much from this experience it's crazy. I think my experience is honestly the run of the mill for any beginner designer in the Global Designer network: you just come in as a complete clueless noob, and the community instantly provides you with close support, educational resources and many opportunities to work with real people and to gain real professional experience, which is kind of mind blowing. Web3 fashion is completely flipping traditional employment hierarchies, and that's kind of what we're about.\\n>\\n> Kind thanks to Stella, who gave me courage and was incredibly supportive during this experience, protecting the interests of GDN members. Kind thanks to Emma and the team for building this insane community.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/59TBKgFHlVz4JUE5dlJRU.png?height=935&width=1458)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ukj5cjrd9XGj5yhhqfzsd.png?height=557&width=732)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mM1T8keaIIV_CCDa4a5FT.png?height=762&width=1309)\\n\\n### Do You Feel Me?\\n\\n[Amratio](https://designers.digitalax.xyz/designers/amratio/) has embarked on a new project‚Äî designing cool IRL T-shirts with messages that hit home for almost all modern day cyber users‚Äî the insta photo doesn‚Äôt do justice in capturing the real experiences and emotions felt off camera.\\n\\nEach designed shirt will include a logo as a back print and also include the text ‚Äúdo you feel me?‚Äù The smiling mouth portrays what we want to show other people around us, i.e. we‚Äôre happy all the time. The sad faces making up the eyes portray the deeper and real feelings that are often hidden.\\n\\nThe message here is that we are all vulnerable sometimes. If only more of us could summon the courage to break the stigma and share with all of our many friends, online and IRL, everything would suddenly be alright? But, what happens when we open up and the people who swore would be there to catch us when we fall, just like they do, have turned away to tell someone else to seize the moment and take that chance.\\n\\nTurns out, relentless positivity only takes us so far.\\n\\nWho could have guessed that there is nuance in what we feel and in what it takes to make the structures that work best for each of us. Maybe we need more. *Do you feel me?* goes deeper into the places where we are not so sure how best to solve it or what the answers are all the time.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D_b9OEUrmkmLrSsSlguPM.png?height=972&width=932)\\n\\n### MoNa Gallery Reward üòç\\n\\nAmazing news and a massive congrats in order for [Catherinetheworst](https://designers.digitalax.xyz/designers/Catherinetheworst/), [Stella Achenbach](https://designers.digitalax.xyz/designers/Stella%20Achenbach/) and Virtualperfectioncowboy who were all awarded by MoNa Gallery in their collaborative **The Temple of the MultiMinds** piece.
