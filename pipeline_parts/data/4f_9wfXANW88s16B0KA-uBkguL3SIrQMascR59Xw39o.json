"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"[Curve (CRV)](https://bravenewcoin.com/data-and-charts/assets/curve-dao-token) continues to buck wider market trends - surging in value even as other, seemingly similar [Decentralized Finance tokens falter](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/decentralized-finance-defi). Over the last 90 days, CRV is up 113%. Over the same period, Compound (COMP), SushiSwap (SUSHI), UniSwap (UNI), and Aave (AAVE) are down 41%, 44%, 32%, and 37% respectively.\\n\\nThe Total Value Locked (TVL) into the Curve protocol is also rocketing upwards. In the same 90 days it has risen 70% with activity on the platform increasing alongside the price of the CRV token.\\n\\n*[Source:Defilama](https://defillama.com/protocol/curve). The USD value of assets across Curve pools has surged in 2021. Curve is popular on Ethereum, Avalanche, and many other EVM and layer 2 chains*\\n\\n## What is Curve Finance?\\n\\n[Curve](https://curve.fi/) is an automated market maker-based decentralized exchange with similar mechanisms to Uniswap and Balancer. It differentiates itself from other AMMs, however, by focusing on supporting liquidity pools with similarly priced assets. Examples of pools on Curve include stablecoin based pools, and pools containing wrapped versions of volatile assets (ie. wrapped-BTC, tBTC).\\n\\nThis approach allows Curve to use optimized algorithms that lower fees and slippage, and lead to less impermanent loss when interacting with these like-for-like asset markets.\\n\\nCurve is also well liked for its charming 90s style user interface that favors substance over style.\\n\\n## What is driving the CRV price?\\n\\nThe native token of the Curve platform is CRV and the short answer to the question above is that the asset is nudging towards becoming net deflationary because of spiking demand to lock-up CRV governance tokens.\\n\\nOn top of giving liquidity providers a share of trading fees, DeFi protocols like Compound, Uniswap, Sushiswap, and Curve are generally quite generous in offering ‘governance tokens’.\\n\\nThese tokens give holders a share of the responsibility to determine the future direction of the protocol and key structural decisions. They also offer holders a share of the total revenue generated by the protocol, not just on individual liquidity pools like with LP tokens. Finally, governance tokens have speculative value.\\n\\nCurve holders have the option to 'stake' their governance tokens, CRV, into the platform for a period between four weeks and four years. The length of time locked determines the level of voting rights allocated to a staker. CRV stakers are given ve-CRV or vote escrowed-CRV as their tickets to vote in governance decisions.\\n\\nCurrently, around 750,000 CRV are distributed daily to liquidity providers on the Curve protocol. The Curve DAO, ve-CRV holders, determine which LPs of which pools get these tokens. These token rewards are allocated based on the predetermined inflation rate of the CRV token.\\n\\nEvery year for the next \\\\~300 years, at a decreasing rate, CRV tokens will be created and allocated to liquidity providers. The bulk of these tokens will be distributed in the first few years of the project's existence. The Curve interface also comes with tools to let ve-CRV holders know how best to allocate their votes to maximize their potential earnings.\\n\\nThe first reduction in emissions happened in early August 2021. This coincided with the CRV token’s rapid appreciation in value.
