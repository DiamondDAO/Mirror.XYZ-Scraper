"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**1939 France**\\n\\nFreda was born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1906, her mother was washer-woman who gave up dance-hall dreams and her father was a vaudeville drummer. \\n\\nSoon after Freda was born, her father left. By age 8, she was a house-cleaner and babysitter to help her mother. She ran away at 13. She was a club waitress who became a dancer known for her comedic skits with dance companies.\\n\\nIn the 1920s, the French were enthralled with Jazz and the exotic. Freda was made for the moment. She became a star in 1920s Paris. Fans included Hemingway, Picasso and E.E. Cummings.\\n\\nFame, fortune, and a 1,000 marriage proposals followed, as did French citizenship in 1937.\\n\\nWhen WW II began, she served in the French Red Cross and then the Resistance. The beautiful high-flying star could hide in plain sight. She delivered secret intelligence for the Allies.\\n\\nShe hosted refugees in her estate in the southwest of France, renamed Les Milandes, and performed for troops in North Africa and the Middle East.\\n\\nFor her War service, France awarded her the Croix de Guerre.\\n\\nShe did return to the U.S. for a comeback tour twice. The first attempt in the 1930s was met with hostility and racism. After the war, she adopted 12 children from around the world, and joined the Civil Rights Movement. The NAACP named a day in her honor.\\n\\nShe tried again in 1973. There was a standing ovation at Carnegie Hall. She later had a 50th anniversary performance, in 1975, in honor of her debut in Paris. 2 days later she passed away in her sleep. Thousands attended her funeral. \\n\\nJosephine Baker was the only American to be remembered with French Military Honors.\\n\\n**1948 Western Europe**\\n\\nA global war had ended - millions were killed and there was a new secret war between 2 victors, each with plans.\\n\\nThe plan would amount to 5 percent of the Gross Domestic Product to rebuild 16 nations, to fund the reconstruction of half of Europe. Infrastructure, cities and industry would be rebuilt, trade barriers between neighbors lowered.\\n\\nIn less than 4 years growth was higher than pre-war levels.\\n\\nThere were other features - 5 percent of these funds were invested in a new intelligence agency designed for the new secret war for the future. The Central Intelligence Agency was funded - new \\\"front\\\" enterprises were funded as a tiny part of the broader \\\"policy... directed ... against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos.”\\n\\n**2912 Earth, Ring City**\\n\\nFernanda Marie-Therese Roque was enjoying the finest delicacies of an Earth \\\"tea time\\\". The long table featured some of the finest pastries from every corner. Even the humblest of biscuits were like Faberge eggs, bespoke and no two alike, the teas brewed from premium clippings of ancient varietals.\\n\\nA miracle year had followed the command performance of her protege, Elena Firmina May, for Martian representatives of the Triumvirate, the commerce cooperatives and leading collaboratives, the grand event space, the Floating Agora.\\n\\nElena's heartwarming, heartbreaking \\\"experience\\\" recreated old Pre-war Mars for the guests, and elevated the image of the exotic girl from Ganymede, Jupiter.\\n\\nElena was already famous for her \\\"miracle\\\" at the Reverence Halls, where she revitalized the scarred minds of Long War veterans living out their last years at the \\\"Halls\\\".\\n\\nHer private \\\"experience\\\" performance for the local elite of Mars put her career in orbit. Fernanda had orchestrated this rise.\\n\\nIt also brought the Roque Cooperative under the scrutiny of the heart of the Triumvirate on Earth. Fernanda was invited to visit Earth, in preparation for bringing her protege very soon.\\n\\nElena’s career would become a System-wide phenomenon - her talents would serve at the pleasure of the Triumvirate.\\n\\nTheir long-running plan, the \\\"Great Upload\\\", the greatest migration of humanity into a new metaverse, was years in the making. This was a multi-decade plan to invest in a new kind of future for mankind.\\n\\nFernanda's Roque Cooperative had become a massive enterprise in part by serving the Triumvirate’s interests.\\n\\n\\\"Lady Fernanda, incoming call from the Triumvirate House, please hold for the Praetor.\\\"\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dMIPNLxMMQF7t00tppAvk.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/u4c6Z6Vh9plrgrwgnV0U9.png?height=2400&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633899259,\"title\":\"1961: 5.17 An Unlikely Spy, Plans Against Chaos, 2913\"},\"digest\":\"NW2KNuAua6WhcmGV83qbXyRdqYdIiXsgc1JVdHlIOME\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"avTg3ApRLJccA4WcfZuFV-_XjxK0b3HS9_d6Cm4zv_adyue3eRINzgkrxv5yK6CMduGS71rm0mnycKMPUD7RQg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"9AOV6nnbBnjLzt5EKWg-WzK9n7tEEVGVsIYOQs8yoEE\"}"
