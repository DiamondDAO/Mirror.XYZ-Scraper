One person or team\\n\\nIt is difficult to keep up with the times forever, and sooner or later the bottleneck will appear.\\n\\nAnd more importantly: the money is in the pocket! Too many speculators are all this\\n\\n170 Entrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs\\n\\nAttitudes toward doing things, companies or projects are experiencing weak growth, the industry is in recession, and bottlenecks occur. You can consider changing projects. Insufficient personnel capacity can consider looking for outstanding talents. The team cannot keep up with the times. You can consider training, further education, and introducing new talents. I think the company is no longer good, and the team members are no longer good. I wonder what is going on with the scattered partners?\\n\\nWe must avoid working with such speculators, which will affect people's good mood. If this kind of person becomes a boss, as long as everyone knows his mind, no one wants to follow\\n\\nHe mixed. Song Jiang in the Water Margin was deeper than he was hidden, and his family was destroyed in the end. I look down on\\n\\nThis is what Song Jiang’s is. That’s all he needs to do well. In order to have a stable and prosperous prosperity, he betrayed the interests of Liangshan’s enterprise and took the ideals of his brothers improperly. In the end, he suffered heavy losses and was not a human being. The real masters are those who cherish the companies they have established and their teams. The so-called hide riches in the people, and the money earned is also shared with everyone. Where is the idea of ​​keeping the bag safe?\\n\\nEven if a team member is incompetent, as long as he is able to support himself by following himself through the struggle, he always has to give him a way or even a position.\\n\\nWe talk about Han Xin's generals, the more the better, the more the people, the bigger the career can be. Mao Zedong, the great leader of Wei, knew that many people are powerful, and he played the trick that people can do things well. Heroes in the world have similar opinions. The strongest person will always unite many people. How can it be easy to sell a business? Money can win over the little people, but can't touch the hearts of big people. He actually sold the company and the team for money, which shows how stupid the boss is for such a leader. It is purely to deceive everyone's trust, let everyone follow him, and I can only win over a gang of mobs. People with this kind of mind can't become a climate. A business too!\\n\\nThe high-level people use faith to win over, the middle-level people use professionalism and brainwashing, and the lower-level people just give some money. We fight the country and rule the country. It happens that we need high-level and middle-level people. It just so happens that money is the least important. How many people who sell businesses have been wiped out in the long history of business. Huawei leaves\\n\\nEntrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs 171\\n\\nA team of Li Yinan followed him and established the Harbor Company. In the end, this buddy actually sold the company to Huawei, leaving the team with him nowhere to go, and everyone ran out of food. This traitor, Li Yinan, had to leave Huawei in the end. No one wanted to mess with him anymore, so he had to be a poor investor. Tencent Dai Zhikang also belongs to this type of person. He betrayed his own company and his team. In the end, he was lonely and widowed. How much money he had, he had to play with angel investment. This kind of people, in the end, everyone rebels and leaves, and the team and dreams are wiped out together. Only a hero will lead his brothers to persevere in the struggle, and only those who never betray their own business and never sell their team will gather into a team of true heroes, because everyone will follow you, rest assured, the bear is always thinking about fishing. One vote will betray the country and the brothers. Betray the team, who is willing to mix with you with all their heart?\\n\\nMoreover, the team is the most important asset of a leader. One person cannot build several teams in a lifetime, because there are time costs and energy costs. Once the team is sold out, everyone will see and remember what you do. , I hate you if you don't say it, the people on the rivers and lakes know your behavior, and fools will not play with you!\\n\\nTherefore, there is a saying in business: reputation and credit are more important than life. You have to figure out, what did you say when you united everyone to fight the situation? Are you saying that you want to get a ticket to leave and put the money in your pocket? When people's hearts are chilled, there is nothing but space and sorrow.\\n\\nMengniu Dairy made its fortune because Niu Gensheng. When leaving Yili, there was a group of high-level and middle-level employees who were willing to pay for their own money and follow Niu Gensheng! When Niu Gensheng was involved in the melamine tainted milk powder incident in Mengniu, he could still allow Modern Dairy to conquer the market and drive high. It was also because the team did not fall. Everyone was willing to follow Niu Gensheng. If Niu Gensheng is a business gadget, if it is money Can Niu Gen survive for An's stuff?\\n\\nComrade Shi Yuzhu, who owes a debt of 250 million yuan in repairing the Giant Mansion, can make a comeback through his brain platinization! It is also because more than 100 senior cadres are willing to play with Shi Yuzhu without paying wages. The so-called heroes and the so-called leaders do not need money!\\n\\n172 Entrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs\\n\\nIt is precisely because you don't need money to make the world rich. Only the miser, or the short-sighted rat, needs to sell the enterprise, sell the team, and put the money in the pocket!\\n\\nI can have today, that’s the point. With my brothers, they both paid out of their own pockets and played projects with me. It is because they paid for their own money and were willing to do things with me. They would do things with their hearts, so that we can make a few small bucks. , If I was a gadget to be safe, my brother would definitely not want to play with me.\\n\\nSo the real routine of being a boss and being a boss is definitely not selling a company. Nokia was a wooden factory at first. They would never sell the Nokia brand. At most, they would sell the following specific businesses, such as the mobile phone business.\\n\\nBut the company is still there, and the core team is still there. The team is here, everything is there, the team is scattered, everything is imaginary, some guys think he is smart to take away how much money? Such people are hypoxic in the brain.\\n\\nIn other words, if you are a small person, it doesn't really matter, it doesn't matter what you do. Once you reach a certain level, once you betray the team, you have no hope of getting up for life.\\n\\nTo sum up: the team is more important than everything. Don’t abandon or betray. As long as you contribute to you, you must be kind. If you can’t keep up, you can find someone with strong ability outside. The project has declined and you can change. project. But money is the least important thing. If you do what I said before, money will chase you. If you can't do it, no matter how scheming, no matter how smart, it will be nothing.\\n\\nSmart people don't put money in their own pockets. Most of the money is in the pockets of other people and in the pockets of team members. Yes, the money belongs to the team members and can be used by me, because I am their boss.\",\"timestamp\":1634799000,\"title\":\"The team is more important than all money and second\"},\"digest\":\"3XRGxYK9cYVswLlpCEsI-6qebhiZk283KAEBycLQXMA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"3pr0Bnlx7SlpH0o5CENMORKGTFDP-cmqeCuIdZDRrecqsgJ_2zLzkV6xsoh4Il121RXjDUg9wBcqMH8GyaH3Ig\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"3XRGxYK9cYVswLlpCEsI-6qebhiZk283KAEBycLQXMA\"}"
