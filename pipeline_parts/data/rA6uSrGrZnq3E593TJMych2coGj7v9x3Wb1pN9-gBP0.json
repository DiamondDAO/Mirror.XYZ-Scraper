"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"She knew that I adored her once, and she let me adore her.  It was \\\\`Robert, come; go; stand up; sit down; do this; do that; see if the baby sleeps; my thimble, please, that I left God knows where.  Come and read Daudet to me while I sew.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Par exemple! I never had to ask.  You were always there under my feet, like a troublesome cat.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You mean like an adoring dog.  And just as soon as Ratignolle appeared on the scene, then it WAS like a dog.  \\\\`Passez!  Adieu! Allez vous-en!'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps I feared to make Alphonse jealous,\\\" she interjoined, with excessive naivete.  That made them all laugh.  The right hand jealous of the left!  The heart jealous of the soul!  But for that matter, the Creole husband is never jealous; with him the gangrene passion is one which has become dwarfed by disuse.\\n\\nMeanwhile Robert, addressing Mrs Pontellier, continued to tell of his one time hopeless passion for Madame Ratignolle; of sleepless nights, of consuming flames till the very sea sizzled when he took his daily plunge.  While the lady at the needle kept up a little running, contemptuous comment:\\n\\n\\\"Blagueur--farceur--gros bete, va!\\\"\\n\\nHe never assumed this seriocomic tone when alone with Mrs. Pontellier.  She never knew precisely what to make of it; at that moment it was impossible for her to guess how much of it was jest and what proportion was earnest.  It was understood that he had often spoken words of love to Madame Ratignolle, without any thought of being taken seriously.  Mrs. Pontellier was glad he had not assumed a similar role toward herself.  It would have been unacceptable and annoying.\\n\\nMrs. Pontellier had brought her sketching materials, which she sometimes dabbled with in an unprofessional way.  She liked the dabbling.  She felt in it satisfaction of a kind which no other employment afforded her.\\n\\nShe had long wished to try herself on Madame Ratignolle. Never had that lady seemed a more tempting subject than at that moment, seated there like some sensuous Madonna, with the gleam of the fading day enriching her splendid color.\\n\\nRobert crossed over and seated himself upon the step below Mrs. Pontellier, that he might watch her work.  She handled her brushes with a certain ease and freedom which came, not from long and close acquaintance with them, but from a natural aptitude. Robert followed her work with close attention, giving forth little ejaculatory expressions of appreciation in French, which he addressed to Madame Ratignolle.\\n\\n\\\"Mais ce n'est pas mal!  Elle s'y connait, elle a de la force, oui.\\\"\\n\\nDuring his oblivious attention he once quietly rested his head against Mrs. Pontellier's arm.  As gently she repulsed him.  Once again he repeated the offense.  She could not but believe it to be thoughtlessness on his part; yet that was no reason she should submit to it.  She did not remonstrate, except again to repulse him quietly but firmly.  He offered no apology.  The picture completed bore no resemblance to Madame Ratignolle. She was greatly disappointed to find that it did not look like her. But it was a fair enough piece of work, and in many respects satisfying.\\n\\nMrs. Pontellier evidently did not think so.  After surveying the sketch critically she drew a broad smudge of paint across its surface, and crumpled the paper between her hands.\\n\\nThe youngsters came tumbling up the steps, the quadroon following at the respectful distance which they required her to observe.  Mrs. Pontellier made them carry her paints and things into the house.  She sought to detain them for a little talk and some pleasantry.  But they were greatly in earnest.  They had only come to investigate the contents of the bonbon box.  They accepted without murmuring what she chose to give them, each holding out two chubby hands scoop-like, in the vain hope that they might be filled; and then away they went.\\n\\nThe sun was low in the west, and the breeze soft and languorous that came up from the south, charged with the seductive odor of the sea.  Children freshly befurbelowed, were gathering for their games under the oaks.  Their voices were high and penetrating.\\n\\nMadame Ratignolle folded her sewing, placing thimble, scissors, and thread all neatly together in the roll, which she pinned securely.  She complained of faintness.  Mrs. Pontellier flew for the cologne water and a fan.  She bathed Madame Ratignolle's face with cologne, while Robert plied the fan with unnecessary vigor.\\n\\nThe spell was soon over, and Mrs. Pontellier could not help wondering if there were not a little imagination responsible for its origin, for the rose tint had never faded from her friend's face.\\n\\nShe stood watching the fair woman walk down the long line of galleries with the grace and majesty which queens are sometimes supposed to possess.  Her little ones ran to meet her.  Two of them clung about her white skirts, the third she took from its nurse and with a thousand endearments bore it along in her own fond, encircling arms.  Though, as everybody well knew, the doctor had forbidden her to lift so much as a pin!\\n\\n\\\"Are you going bathing?\\\" asked Robert of Mrs. Pontellier.  It was not so much a question as a reminder.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no,\\\" she answered, with a tone of indecision.  \\\"I'm tired; I think not.\\\" Her glance wandered from his face away toward the Gulf, whose sonorous murmur reached her like a loving but imperative entreaty.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, come!\\\" he insisted.  \\\"You mustn't miss your bath.  Come on.  The water must be delicious; it will not hurt you.  Come.\\\"\\n\\nHe reached up for her big, rough straw hat that hung on a peg outside the door, and put it on her head.  They descended the steps, and walked away together toward the beach.  The sun was low in the west and the breeze was soft and warm.\\n\\nVI\\n\\nEdna Pontellier could not have told why, wishing to go to the beach with Robert, she should in the first place have declined, and in the second place have followed in obedience to one of the two contradictory impulses which impelled her.\\n\\nA certain light was beginning to dawn dimly within her,--the light which, showing the way, forbids it.\\n\\nAt that early period it served but to bewilder her.  It moved her to dreams, to thoughtfulness, to the shadowy anguish which had overcome her the midnight when she had abandoned herself to tears.\\n\\nIn short, Mrs. Pontellier was beginning to realize her position in the universe as a human being, and to recognize her relations as an individual to the world within and about her.  This may seem like a ponderous weight of wisdom to descend upon the soul of a young woman of twenty-eight--perhaps more wisdom than the Holy Ghost is usually pleased to vouchsafe to any woman.\\n\\nBut the beginning of things, of a world especially, is necessarily vague, tangled, chaotic, and exceedingly disturbing. How few of us ever emerge from such beginning!  How many souls perish in its tumult!\\n\\nThe voice of the sea is seductive; never ceasing, whispering, clamoring, murmuring, inviting the soul to wander for a spell in abysses of solitude; to lose itself in mazes of inward contemplation.\\n\\nThe voice of the sea speaks to the soul.  The touch of the sea is sensuous, enfolding the body in its soft, close embrace.\\n\\nVII\\n\\nMrs. Pontellier was not a woman given to confidences, a characteristic hitherto contrary to her nature.  Even as a child she had lived her own small life all within herself.  At a very early period she had apprehended instinctively the dual life--that outward existence which conforms, the inward life which questions.\\n\\nThat summer at Grand Isle she began to loosen a little the mantle of reserve that had always enveloped her.  There may have been--there must have been--influences, both subtle and apparent, working in their several ways to induce her to do this; but the most obvious was the influence of Adele Ratignolle.  The excessive physical charm of the Creole had first attracted her, for Edna had a sensuous susceptibility to beauty.  Then the candor of the woman's whole existence, which every one might read, and which formed so striking a contrast to her own habitual reserve--this might have furnished a link.  Who can tell what metals the gods use in forging the subtle bond which we call sympathy, which we might as well call love.\\n\\nThe two women went away one morning to the beach together, arm in arm, under the huge white sunshade.  Edna had prevailed upon Madame Ratignolle to leave the children behind, though she could not induce her to relinquish a diminutive roll of needlework, which Adele begged to be allowed to slip into the depths of her pocket. In some unaccountable way they had escaped from Robert.\\n\\nThe walk to the beach was no inconsiderable one, consisting as it did of a long, sandy path, upon which a sporadic and tangled growth that bordered it on either side made frequent and unexpected inroads. There were acres of yellow camomile reaching out on either hand. Further away still, vegetable gardens abounded, with frequent small plantations of orange or lemon trees intervening. The dark green clusters glistened from afar in the sun.\\n\\nThe women were both of goodly height, Madame Ratignolle possessing the more feminine and matronly figure.  The charm of Edna Pontellier's physique stole insensibly upon you.  The lines of her body were long, clean and symmetrical; it was a body which occasionally fell into splendid poses; there was no suggestion of the trim, stereotyped fashion-plate about it.  A casual and indiscriminating observer, in passing, might not cast a second glance upon the figure.  But with more feeling and discernment he would have recognized the noble beauty of its modeling, and the graceful severity of poise and movement, which made Edna Pontellier different from the crowd.\\n\\nShe wore a cool muslin that morning--white, with a waving vertical line of brown running through it; also a white linen collar and the big straw hat which she had taken from the peg outside the door.  The hat rested any way on her yellow-brown hair, that waved a little, was heavy, and clung close to her head.\\n\\nMadame Ratignolle, more careful of her complexion, had twined a gauze veil about her head.  She wore dogskin gloves, with gauntlets that protected her wrists.  She was dressed in pure white, with a fluffiness of ruffles that became her.  The draperies and fluttering things which she wore suited her rich, luxuriant beauty as a greater severity of line could not have done.\\n\\nThere were a number of bath-houses along the beach, of rough but solid construction, built with small, protecting galleries facing the water.  Each house consisted of two compartments, and each family at Lebrun's possessed a compartment for itself, fitted out with all the essential paraphernalia of the bath and whatever other conveniences the owners might desire.  The two women had no intention of bathing; they had just strolled down to the beach for a walk and to be alone and near the water.  The Pontellier and Ratignolle compartments adjoined one another under the same roof.\\n\\nMrs. Pontellier had brought down her key through force of habit.  Unlocking the door of her bath-room she went inside, and soon emerged, bringing a rug, which she spread upon the floor of the gallery, and two huge hair pillows covered with crash, which she placed against the front of the building.\\n\\nThe two seated themselves there in the shade of the porch, side by side, with their backs against the pillows and their feet extended.  Madame Ratignolle removed her veil, wiped her face with a rather delicate handkerchief, and fanned herself with the fan which she always carried suspended somewhere about her person by a long, narrow ribbon.  Edna removed her collar and opened her dress at the throat.  She took the fan from Madame Ratignolle and began to fan both herself and her companion.  It was very warm, and for a while they did nothing but exchange remarks about the heat, the sun, the glare.  But there was a breeze blowing, a choppy, stiff wind that whipped the water into froth.  It fluttered the skirts of the two women and kept them for a while engaged in adjusting, readjusting, tucking in, securing hair-pins and hat-pins.  A few persons were sporting some distance away in the water.  The beach was very still of human sound at that hour.  The lady in black was reading her morning devotions on the porch of a neighboring bathhouse.  Two young lovers were exchanging their hearts' yearnings beneath the children's tent, which they had found unoccupied.\\n\\nEdna Pontellier, casting her eyes about, had finally kept them at rest upon the sea.  The day was clear and carried the gaze out as far as the blue sky went; there were a few white clouds suspended idly over the horizon.  A lateen sail was visible in the direction of Cat Island, and others to the south seemed almost motionless in the far distance.\\n\\n\\\"Of whom--of what are you thinking?\\\" asked Adele of her companion, whose countenance she had been watching with a little amused attention, arrested by the absorbed expression which seemed to have seized and fixed every feature into a statuesque repose.\\n\\n\\\"Nothing,\\\" returned Mrs. Pontellier, with a start, adding at once: \\\"How stupid!  But it seems to me it is the reply we make instinctively to such a question.  Let me see,\\\" she went on, throwing back her head and narrowing her fine eyes till they shone like two vivid points of light.  \\\"Let me see.  I was really not conscious of thinking of anything; but perhaps I can retrace my thoughts.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh! never mind!\\\" laughed Madame Ratignolle.  \\\"I am not quite so exacting.  I will let you off this time.  It is really too hot to think, especially to think about thinking.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But for the fun of it,\\\" persisted Edna.  \\\"First of all, the sight of the water stretching so far away, those motionless sails against the blue sky, made a delicious picture that I just wanted to sit and look at.  The hot wind beating in my face made me think--without any connection that I can trace of a summer day in Kentucky, of a meadow that seemed as big as the ocean to the very little girl walking through the grass, which was higher than her waist.  She threw out her arms as if swimming when she walked, beating the tall grass as one strikes out in the water.  Oh, I see the connection now!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where were you going that day in Kentucky, walking through the grass?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't remember now.  I was just walking diagonally across a big field.  My sun-bonnet obstructed the view.  I could see only the stretch of green before me, and I felt as if I must walk on forever, without coming to the end of it. I don't remember whether I was frightened or pleased.  I must have been entertained.\\n\\n\\\"Likely as not it was Sunday,\\\" she laughed; \\\"and I was running away from prayers, from the Presbyterian service, read in a spirit of gloom by my father that chills me yet to think of.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And have you been running away from prayers ever since, ma chere?\\\" asked Madame Ratignolle, amused.\\n\\n\\\"No! oh, no!\\\" Edna hastened to say.  \\\"I was a little unthinking child in those days, just following a misleading impulse without question.  On the contrary, during one period of my life religion took a firm hold upon me; after I was twelve and until-until--why, I suppose until now, though I never thought much about it--just driven along by habit.  But do you know,\\\" she broke off, turning her quick eyes upon Madame Ratignolle and leaning forward a little so as to bring her face quite close to that of her companion, \\\"sometimes I feel this summer as if I were walking through the green meadow again; idly, aimlessly, unthinking and unguided.\\\"\\n\\nMadame Ratignolle laid her hand over that of Mrs. Pontellier, which was near her.  Seeing that the hand was not withdrawn, she clasped it firmly and warmly.  She even stroked it a little, fondly, with the other hand, murmuring in an undertone, \\\"Pauvre cherie.\\\"\\n\\nThe action was at first a little confusing to Edna, but she soon lent herself readily to the Creole's gentle caress.  She was not accustomed to an outward and spoken expression of affection, either in herself or in others.  She and her younger sister, Janet, had quarreled a good deal through force of unfortunate habit.  Her older sister, Margaret, was matronly and dignified, probably from having assumed matronly and housewifely responsibilities too early in life, their mother having died when they were quite young, Margaret was not effusive; she was practical.  Edna had had an occasional girl friend, but whether accidentally or not, they seemed to have been all of one type--the self-contained.  She never realized that the reserve of her own character had much, perhaps everything, to do with this.  Her most intimate friend at school had been one of rather exceptional intellectual gifts, who wrote fine-sounding essays, which Edna admired and strove to imitate; and with her she talked and glowed over the English classics, and sometimes held religious and political controversies.\\n\\nEdna often wondered at one propensity which sometimes had inwardly disturbed her without causing any outward show or manifestation on her part.  At a very early age--perhaps it was when she traversed the ocean of waving grass--she remembered that she had been passionately enamored of a dignified and sad-eyed cavalry officer who visited her father in Kentucky.  She could not leave his presence when he was there, nor remove her eyes from his face, which was something like Napoleon's, with a lock of black hair failing across the forehead.  But the cavalry officer melted imperceptibly out of her existence.\",\"timestamp\":1639988488,\"title\":\"Could any one fathom the cruelty beneath that fair exterior?\\\" murmured Robert.\"},\"digest\":\"OcjH_Eeq2StKv-sYJUua7P0zv_kcju1HLbGKqL84ky0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9dA14EBFe3CfE059a88A873b83F5D7f596175316\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xgLQ4KTe5m1tnl9_Ove85AzSMZc5WmLKq3MIojJMAJE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"b70hID4S1d4pvhJO4zynBqvRLjGKqn12FXUD3BA6_r8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"-ic2TW6SErO2tJ3yVx4PwoLqfgoun530wqPzsnQgJOcDZBnTSe82vmPptg0yJfsWqDaliMtP7t27sd2OYHmifw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1cc19b51ddaac205c2a998855d7cb6477286f585343bdc88dbcd11ab305182153babdd5128bafc4e4074e1d5c53aa95e0aca8dde255061017450d86fcb5b07d01c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xgLQ4KTe5m1tnl9_Ove85AzSMZc5WmLKq3MIojJMAJE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"b70hID4S1d4pvhJO4zynBqvRLjGKqn12FXUD3BA6_r8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"OcjH_Eeq2StKv-sYJUua7P0zv_kcju1HLbGKqL84ky0\"}"
