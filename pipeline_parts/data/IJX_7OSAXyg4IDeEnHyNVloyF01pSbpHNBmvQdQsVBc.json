These communities are built in web2 spaces like Spotify, Soundcloud, and Twitter; and while they are a great first step, artists deserve to own those relationships that they’ve cultivated and to interact and engage with their communities on their own terms.\\n\\nEnter web3, where ownership is in the hands of creators, not intermediaries. At Mint Songs, we are driven to build the most effective tools that empower music artists to cultivate thriving web3 communities that they can cherish.\\n\\n# Posters\\n\\nMint Songs is excited to announce the launch of Posters, a new way for artists to build their web3 communities.
