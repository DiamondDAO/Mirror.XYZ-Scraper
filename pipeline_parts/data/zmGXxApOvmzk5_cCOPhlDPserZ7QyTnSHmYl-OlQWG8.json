"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Introducing [ProsperDAO](https://twitter.com/ProsperDao), an experiment in collective prosperity.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/91595b77-b7c0-466b-a9f6-fc996a320b88.jpg?height=3300&width=2550)\\n\\n\\n\\nProsperDAO is born out of a desire to build the community weâ€™ve always dreamed of. An opportunity to experiment with how we collaborate (organizational design / DAO). To nurture meaningful relationships in both the digital and physical realms (community / people). To simply build cool sh*t with amazing people (purpose).\\n\\n> Purpose + people + DAO = magic âœ¨\\n\\n\\n### Our mission is to create spaces for collective prosperity to thrive. \\nProsperDAO is seeded in [Celo](https://twitter.com/CeloOrg)â€™s mission of prosperity for everyone and celebrates the interoperable and interconnected nature of web3. ProsperDAO is for anyone in the broader crypto community aligned to this spirit of purposeâ€”especially those who want to have FUN in the process.\\n\\nWe hope to spark a global community of leaders committed to spreading prosperity globally. Without overpowering, extracting from, neglecting, or dismissing. Instead, having the courage to stand in prosperity and hold the space for others to do the same. \\n\\n## It started in 2019...\\nIn 2019,  a group of us hosted a retreat with good peeps that led to co-founders meeting, new projects launching, and unexpected magic. The intent was to bring prosperity to life through a shared  experience. By the end, there were ideas to turn it into a three month experience and desire to host retreats around the world. The overwhelming positive feedback of this experience energized us to bring people back together IRL and to do so with DAO infrastructure to support it.\\n\\n## ...picking up where we left off this fall\\nThis September, ~80 people will be [gathering in the Catskill Mountains](https://prosperdao.xyz/) for ProsperDAOâ€™s genesis weekend. To finalize the [principles](https://www.notion.so/Principles-v1-7c9639cf1c8649d1a21a93bd8f32af1c) & manifesto. To build community. To hug (remember that?!). To shape the future of ProsperDAO.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2ea71f39-ae47-4027-85de-43f6e43d10d0.png?height=1080&width=1920)\\n\\n## Letâ€™s DAO it\\nAt their best, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations enable experimental, anti-hierarchical, fluid structures that optimize for organic and meaningful contributions from a collective intelligence. The DAO infrastructure creates greater community ownership and decision-making. Weâ€™re still just scratching the surface for whatâ€™s possible when people move from intrinsic motivation. Weâ€™re excited to prototype new methods of intentional organizing and sharing our findings along the way.\\n\\n## Wait, so what will we actually do?\\nHost really amazing experiences around the world. Build products & relationships. Maybe spark a movement. And just hang...yes, more chillinâ€™.\\n\\n## Today is the MVDâ€”Minimum Viable DAO\\nThis day marks the launch of the MVD. The minimum amount of infrastructure needed to start building in public and with the community. This includes: a multi-sig, legal entity (almost complete!), purpose, [principles](https://www.notion.so/Principles-v1-7c9639cf1c8649d1a21a93bd8f32af1c), & plenty of artwork. There is still much to figure out, including how new members join ProsperDAO. Weâ€™ll be finalizing much of this, with ProsperDAOâ€™s current and future members, in the coming months and at the [genesis retreat weekend](http://prosperdao.xyz).\\n\\n## Genesis Members\\nHumbly at your service, meet the folks who have been dedicated to getting ProsperDAO off of the ground. A collective of creatives, programmers, healers, investors, operators, and advocates dreaming prosperity into existence. \\n\\n- [Adriana Cerundolo](https://twitter.com/adrisonic)\\n- [Daniel Olarte](https://twitter.com/DanielOlarte_)\\n- [Evan Kereiakes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evan-kereiakes/)\\n- [Gabrielle Micheletti](https://twitter.com/gabriellemic)\\n- [Jarrell James](https://twitter.com/techboiafrica)\\n- [Josh Crites](https://twitter.com/critesjosh_)\\n- [Nitya Subramanian](https://twitter.com/_nityas)\\n- [Vanessa Slavich](https://twitter.com/vslavich)\\n- [Yaz Khoury](https://twitter.com/Yazanator)\\n\\n## Let the adventure begin.\\nWith our MVD in the pocket, weâ€™re excited to meet other folks aligned to the purpose and broader experiment. \\n\\nInterested in what weâ€™re up to?
