"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"> “In a free market the people are free, the ideas are locked up.” — Lewis Hyde\\n\\nLewis Hyde’s book The Gift is a must-read.\\n\\nIt’s a study of gift giving, its relationship to art, and the communities that form around these acts.\\n\\n> “It is the one book I recommend without fail to aspiring writers and painters and musicians.” — Margaret Atwood\\n\\n## How a gift economy differs from a market economy\\n\\nHyde describes this clearly:\\n\\n* In a **market economy, *there’s an equilibrium state***. You exchange goods of equivalent value. You pay to balance the scale.\\n* In a **gift economy, *there is momentum*.** A gift moves energy from one body to another.\\n\\nTraditional examples of acts in the gift economy:\\n\\n* Making offerings to a religious deity\\n* Contributing open source software\\n* Cooking food for friends\\n* Babysitting a neighbor’s children\\n* Mentoring / coaching a youth group\\n* Serving as a volunteer EMT\\n* Sharing a poem with a friend\\n\\nGifts do not need to move reciprocally.\\n\\nGifts do not produce the adversarial roles of creditor and debtor.\\n\\nGifts shun accounting and exactness.\\n\\nGifts are passed on — the act of passing on a gift benefits both the giver and the receiver.\\n\\n## The gift economy does not operate in isolation from the market\\n\\nSep Kamvar [writes](https://farmerandfarmer.org/mastery/economies.html) about this:\\n\\n> When people talk of gift economies, often they talk about them as a replacement for the market economy. But gift economies and market economies have operated side-by-side for much of history.\\n\\nWeb2 social media platforms were successful at creating a gift economy among users.\\n\\nUsers shared and liked things freely.\\n\\nThen, users woke up to the fact that they were the product. The “gifts” they shared/liked could be monetized and the value accrued to the platforms.\\n\\n## With Web3, the spirit of the gift economy is being ported onto a market economy\\n\\nTake issuing art/music/writing as an NFT.\\n\\nIt can be shared and enjoyed as usual, but it can also be exchanged for money in a way that rewards both the creator and their supporters.\\n\\n### Airdrops are another example.\\n\\nYesterday, 25M ENS tokens was airdropped into certain people’s wallets.\\n\\nWhy? Because those people were early supporters of ENS.\\n\\nA few cashed in; most kept their gift. Now the tokens are worth around $1B. And the supporters are even more ardent.\\n\\n## Pay it forward\\n\\nIn traditional cultures, it’s taboo to hoard a gift and not contribute something back to the community.\\n\\nHyde wrote: “In folk tales, the person who tries to hold onto a gift usually dies.”\\n\\nWeb3 builders — and DAOs like ENS specifically —are creating powerful incentives to pay it forward and act generously. That’s a message worth spreading.\\n\\n![Lewis Hyde’s The Gift](https://miro.medium.com/max/584/1\\\\*o7c_tQy7FbeAqvQX7s5oEg.jpeg)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637257440,\"title\":\"Web3 will enable the gift economy and the market economy to play together in completely new ways\"},\"digest\":\"pthOuPwV-qjpLovVZfwqImZauY9E9i5VQGgwIHc9EjI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5a5D9aB7b1bD978F80909503EBb828879daCa9C3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"B0riQ0zqeSQiGpY5oDTmBmvrnJqfj4Y4SAITBCnEhcg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DKQ2xNJQGITQD8AVVlzPPDMX3pfQDQdLd9edzyUKlIo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"qo2lE_azf4_mhozbHa0g4p2Kt_cTb5Y_TMp418_I5VCwSJmP03YMOLArEJD0dipKfbIzdBEIK-wUIJgBs6PQbQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x3b08eeb76589a4153c5013321b0ce19de6bf584cbafc2ba8cf06d99b9f90ae877446c5575b4d897de73a69de7299a2e1f1b26caae9d4476e94787dd46c6d943a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"B0riQ0zqeSQiGpY5oDTmBmvrnJqfj4Y4SAITBCnEhcg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DKQ2xNJQGITQD8AVVlzPPDMX3pfQDQdLd9edzyUKlIo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"pthOuPwV-qjpLovVZfwqImZauY9E9i5VQGgwIHc9EjI\"}"
