ETH/BTC are the two largest cryptocurrency by market cap and so the aim is to try to outperform both (with the expectation that their marketcaps mean less room for growth).***\\n\\nTakeaways from ‘2022 main trends’\\n\\n* Continued trend in multi-chain DEFI\\n* Modular blockchain architecture closer to mainnet\\n* Emergence of \\\\*successful\\\\* play-to-earn economies\\n* Everyone <> Metaverse\\n\\n** \\n **\\n\\nDevs in Crypto\\n\\n* Talented web2 developers jumping over to web3 companies/projects\\n* Languages more non-crypto native and traditional developer friendly being used\\n* Blockchain infrastructure is overlooked and is a space for developers to grow\\n  * Infura for Ethereum <> AWS\\n* Pocket Network!\\n\\n** \\n **\\n\\nLayer 1s and IBC\\n\\n* Solana\\n  * SBF and Almeda backing\\n  * Protocol innovations allow really fast transaction processing (resulting in a v.good end user experience)\\n  * EVM Compatibility soon?\\n  * Pyth Network.

Better r/r plays than Sol for Q1 considering it’s market cap\\n  * Technicals:\\n    * Current range is re-accumulation before more upside\\n    * Sentiment on Sol DeFi at peak lows\\n  * Top Sol Project WILL outperform SOL (See recent hackathon for potentials)\\n  * Plan is to roll profits into SOL as these catalysts start to appear later in the Q/year\\n* AVAX (Avalanche)\\n  * Main catalysts for Q1 is Defikingsoms CrystalVale expansion\\n  * Has outperformed most other chains for second half of year in terms of user onboarding\\n  * AVAX/Crystal pool after Single-Staking JEWEL as largest Q2 positions\\n* BTC (Bitcoin)\\n  * The riskiest asset for non-crypto natives BUT considered the risk-off asset for those in Crypto\\n  * Bitcoin Dominance as a metric for risk on/risk off\\n  * Q4 BTC Pushed it’s all time high twice\\n  * All BTC breakouts have aligned with a local low on the ETH/BTC pair\\n  * TradFi warming up to BTC -> Long term BTC holders warming up to Alts\\n  * Holds value as a long term multi year investment so always keep/build the stack but it’s better served to hedge downside during bull markets\\n  * Expectations:\\n    * BTC ranges between 42-53k\\n    * Most bearish scenario is a 42k break nd potential 27k rest (The absolute floor scenario)\\n    * Likely scenario is a range in this area before push for new ATH\\n* ETH (Ethereum)\\n  * By midyear ETH should be what it considers a functioning modular blockchain stack\\n  * Interesting to see if alternate L1 users will use rollups once rolled out over the chains they’re currently used to\\n  * Unlikely ETHs scaling solutions take this market share from other L1s that have onboarded non crypto users (Unless UX is vastly different/improved)\\n  * New retail chasing 100x aren’t using Ethereum or won’t be using it as much for a variety of reasons (cost, speed, opportunity at present on other L1s)\\n  * The claim to fame of security and decentralization isn’t a good enough sell to onboard new users\\n    * This may attract non crypto boomer but won’t attract a large portion of new users/investors\\n  * Reasoning on  why it isn’t a great trade\\n    * Market cap MUCH larger than other monolithic L1s with the worst UX of them all\\n    * L2s that perform best will have tokens available from Centralized exchanges\\n      * Holding these tokens should outperform holding spot ETH\\n    * ETH is not optimized for modular architecture\\n      * ETH present day is a monolith pivoting towards a settlement and data availability layer with rollups for execution layer\\n      * Celestia as a team arte focused on being a data availability layer and were built for this from the ground up\\n      * NEAR similarly has been built from the ground up with one thing as their focus\\n    * Once ETH transitions to a settlement layer some of its market share will be taken by other parts of the ecosystem. Expect more value to go to these other layers as they’re starting from 0\\n    * Future of DeFi will be multichain!\\n      * More likely we have multi chain eco of networks all functioning together than one solution working well with all others failing\\n\\n** \\n **\\n\\nOther plays not mentioned:\\n\\nCurve Wars: CV / CRV / YFI / BTRFLY\\n\\nSYS+MUTE\\n\\nSpell & MIM + Sushi\\n\\nFXS\\n\\nINV\\n\\nGMX / dYdX / PERP / MNGO / DRIFT Protocol\\n\\nDPX / RBN / PsyOptions\\n\\nDusk \\n Metis\\n\\nMagic (TreasureNFT) \\n Ninja on SOl\\n\\nLevana Protocol\\n\\n** \\n **\\n\\nSome BOLD predictions for 2022 that piqued my interest:\\n\\n* DeFi Kingdoms in Top 10 by market cap 👀\\n* SOL-DeFi outperforms SOL by a wide margin 🤌\\n* SoLunAvax flips ETH and stays there 🚀\\n* ATOM $100B+ Market cap (Sorry wut ?!)\\n* DeFi Options gain a lot of traction 🚜\",\"timestamp\":1641127490,\"title\":\"Q1 2022’ Report Notes\"},\"digest\":\"PsONkUm6nsnr54zH5g97o4P1HL7qg_QWDoW-KIPz88o\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xFAe3Cb021F2643Cc07512df7579c4555A5291eC2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wRZ5hSgJ68obtS2c3tpCunzEKrTAWSKTosrQOz-LPEU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"O4epcfffCa1dBnFo-xK_14sNNo_3GWAUB4BiB05JxJ8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"oOS0X47n3kaDcVh7raT3XRz880ANr7mMISKjQEFCQiDuVOAqIhptDwdjqEfcXVtb1EETYdUif4BLYIeEwG8l-g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0ada9115a31a558957312f641b0dcf0208a5aaef5f24fe4e81db7c7c038236183a384293d0c27bdde75c1ca68bb9687eb05e871bbe920bbf32cdec658a84f9701c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wRZ5hSgJ68obtS2c3tpCunzEKrTAWSKTosrQOz-LPEU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"O4epcfffCa1dBnFo-xK_14sNNo_3GWAUB4BiB05JxJ8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"PsONkUm6nsnr54zH5g97o4P1HL7qg_QWDoW-KIPz88o\"}"
