In 1954, China had begun to promote winter sports in its northeastern regions, and Tonghua established its first cross-country ski team. Shan became part of the first group at age 16.\\n\\n\\\"Conditions were really tough at that time,\\\" he said. \\\"We didn't have good equipment. We had to make skis out of wood by ourselves. But I always had the confidence to perform well.\\\"\\n\\nFrom 1957 to 1960, Shan won 10 medals in different national competitions, including five golds.\\n\\nBecause of injuries, he retired from skiing at age 24, but he stayed close to the winter sport he loved. Over the years, he has served as a ski coach, secretary-general of Chinese Ski Association and head of the Chinese ski team, branching out to all aspects of skiing, including downhill racing. He took it as his mission to cultivate winter sports among as many people and in as many places as he could.\\n\\n![Shan Zhaojian is named honorary dean of the College of Ice and Snow Industry at the Jilin Institute of Physical Education in Changchun, Jilin province, in October. ](http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202111/19/61978335a310cdd3d81b9825.jpeg)\\n\\nIn 1995, Shan visited the Chongli district of Zhangjiakou, Hebei province, looking for a place where skiing activities could be held — especially racing. His visit changed the fate of Chongli.\\n\\n\\\"The topography of Chongli is good for skiing. Its large forest area also contributes to a good ecological environment,\\\" he said. \\\"Plus, it is close to Beijing, with an expressway linking the two places.\\\"\\n\\nOver the years, Chongli built several ski resorts and was chosen as a major venue for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games.\\n\\nAfter his retirement in 1998, Shan spent time researching the history and culture of skiing, as well as giving public speeches and promoting activities involving ice and snow on school campuses across the country.\\n\\nOn Oct 25, he was named honorary dean of the the College of Ice and Snow Industry at the Jilin Institute of Physical Education.\\n\\n\\\"I hope to see more people participate in ice and snow sports,\\\" he said, noting the boost in enthusiasm provided by the Winter Games. \\\"I also hope to see the blossoming of various sectors of China's ice and snow industry.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1637331991,\"title\":\"Now 83, ski champion stays close to sport he loves\"},\"digest\":\"jP431jmNehnNfmOn8nBJ1uu7t83VcLPcbSzOdlFPYFs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2ea08148D387edE3890D2ac51795e2d170c9512D\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Fx-sRx7StoMzhX-1HEJBV9ijJn_lJhAK2WtL4ld-B7I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ONxDkNKtNCc8NE5CNCRlEe5BEaAX8xawHIxTOdVBC68\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"o_jGejPQStL2qeNP3tb49w_UBRlSWAl9e4aF_zLeGaz5fz5wftKubq0QNP_dxEVrE6EduBwQ7bVv52I7qm8i5A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0be2d4861d5d08dc17e61bcb34bf8a21740a4bac173675691c7474d2b966fd106679e0b332908d2496cd027c70fdc85be524de35f63df436f3b700eac49957171c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Fx-sRx7StoMzhX-1HEJBV9ijJn_lJhAK2WtL4ld-B7I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ONxDkNKtNCc8NE5CNCRlEe5BEaAX8xawHIxTOdVBC68\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jP431jmNehnNfmOn8nBJ1uu7t83VcLPcbSzOdlFPYFs\"}"
