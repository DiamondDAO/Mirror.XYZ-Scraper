"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1961 East Berlin\\n\\nOn paper, he was the perfect recruit. He was the son of an officer of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs, 'NKVD' for short (secret police) and a graduate of a top university in Moscow.\\n\\nAt the NKVD, he learned 4 languages and trained in spycraft. His first posting was with the foreign service in 1961, right before the Berlin Wall was completed. He was repelled by the wall but kept silent. He returned to Moscow, and in 1963 he joined the KGB.\\n\\nIn 1966, he was attached to the Soviet embassy in Copenhagen. His seed of disillusionment grew after Soviet tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia in 1968. The Danes noticed and contacted MI6.\\n\\nOleg Antonovich Gordievsky rose to KGB Colonel and London bureau chief - a critical MI6 \\\"asset\\\". His code-names were \\\"SUNBEAM\\\", \\\"TICKLE\\\". He helped prevent a Soviet first nuclear strike in 1983, and identified Gorbachev as a likely leader of the USSR, years in advance.\\n\\nIn 1985, his cover was blown. He was imprisoned in a KGB Moscow safe house, drugged, interrogated, and told he would never travel again.\\n\\nThe extraction was planned years ago. Gordievsky would walk to a specific street corner with a Safeways bag, his contact would carry a Harrod's bag while eating a candy bar as the “Go” signal. He went for his usual jog, eluded the KGB, and reached the Finnish border. He was given a death sentence in absentia. The defection cast suspicion on various other KGB officers, including friends of the current Russian president, Putin.\\n\\nIn 2007, Gordievsky was admitted to a hospital in Surrey, England, for thallium poisoning. An investigation was dropped by MI6 but a former M15 Director General reopened it Colonel Gordievesky lives at an undisclosed location in the U.K.\\n\\n2911\\n\\nJacob C. Tagore, Jr. wandered the street market’s stalls and small shops. He haggled, smiled and scowled and made small talk. He was early and enjoyed an escape of the space between other spaces, when nothing happened or appeared to. It wasn’t all hard training all the time.\\n\\n“They’re here”, said the voice.\\n\\n“I’ve picked a place that makes all kinds of dishes that will work.”\\n\\nJacob walked over to an old food hall that served all kinds of thing fresh every morning. The kind of traditional cooking that would have mutated into haute cuisine but the locals didn’t try hard to promote it. If anything, there was a pride of place in keeping it undiscovered, despite the 24/7 hum of culture oracles on food ‘chains. This was thanks to home grown rules more secure than Faraday chambers. It was perfect.\\n\\n“This is quite a place, it’s peaceful. I may come back.””Yes, the mothers and fathers here make great food, have a seat.”\\n\\nThey didn’t have to order. Jacob got to know the mother who ran one place, that had been around since before the Long War. A war-widow who raised grand-children and great-grand-children with an iron will and a soft heart. He knew the layout of the place by heart.”Ingermica, you come back. I know what you will you and your friend will eat.” Jacob smiled and cupped the mother’s hand in his.”Yes, mother, thank you. I also want my friend to try some of the pastries from this morning too, please.”\\n\\nHis guest would have an allergic reaction to the pastries an hour later. Jacob would then help his guest get a doctor without drawing attention, and have a long chat, the beginning of an interesting friendship.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7JU3P4-MCc7BkWIQ4xmcQ.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4fuSwU-1NPO8iESVcSbcF.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633890437,\"title\":\"1961: 5.4 Seeds Of Disillusionment, 2911\"},\"digest\":\"VPqBY1Azn-yX_kchH8I75hADu4KqwCprVGbPJw7M4G8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ZptK666pt30NAZf3sg1BS69LD-EOXEwUmV6cIqN0Ka02XWNmFbq_xU1-1P3UUwiI1ZK3sgRil-pWbXS1hrt1ew\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"uF6oRsxEqKa8wdGZ6ed2YdZC8wi2Gh6W-_4OceIMYi4\"}"
