She instituted the Hololens playbook – work with enterprise clients to identify use cases, build applications together and then, sell.\\n\\nThis new enterprise-first focus means that now Magic Leap is going up against Microsoft.\\n\\nMicrosoft has a significant headstart – with Hololens 2 in the hands of their massive clientele and Hololens 3 under development. Moreover, Magic Leap is also competing for the same enterprise clients where Microsoft has deep relations because of Azure and Office.\\n\\nAlso, last year, when Magic Leap laid off half of its employees, most of them went to Apple and Facebook to develop their AR efforts.\\n\\nIt’s going to be tough for a single product company to build a futuristic tech with no product-market-fit and go up against the giants.\\n\\nOn a tangent, a question that always pops up in my mind when I think about AR headsets for enterprises is:\\n\\nAre companies really gonna spend capital for front-line workers to use these expensive headsets on a large scale? The question is not if that happens but when.\\n\\nIf you liked it, leave [your comments here!](https://twitter.com/prashantpbagga/status/1448594061305200641?s=20https://twitter.com/prashantpbagga/status/1448594061305200641?s=20)\",\"timestamp\":1634207192,\"title\":\"Magic Leap is Back\"},\"digest\":\"rZYLv5Ms8Y81I9B9L2MM0TQaTpaWxINJTaHSs8Vxj7g\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xfA4e3AeB9F59C6d5F957e7C3002c03D2C6927991\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HsG2dSLgNFQSrc_7tRFSb9Q_Ur3oSeVErRGPSxN2YEY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4ByVlpWoMqLl_BA_VeC7ePD5fWWs8p4NqRA-IFezynA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"8jUI2pOx9q025_YFX8rpZCqB9BONoF3V6UxQF1k4BmL5Pj6d9DMcy9GOYFESWgHvvjGyHNnjhxNtcpYMVAygmA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x3a0787a25c2e8ea91f508e1690d875082000517be070472e7335ed03774f1c7c5787357b23a03d3383ae7799db92fd1d123a922572e54fad23c12426a8db36031b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HsG2dSLgNFQSrc_7tRFSb9Q_Ur3oSeVErRGPSxN2YEY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4ByVlpWoMqLl_BA_VeC7ePD5fWWs8p4NqRA-IFezynA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rZYLv5Ms8Y81I9B9L2MM0TQaTpaWxINJTaHSs8Vxj7g\"}"
