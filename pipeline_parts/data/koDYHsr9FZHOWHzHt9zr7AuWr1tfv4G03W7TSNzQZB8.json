"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Now that we have a good understanding of Ethereum and smart contracts, we can start digging into the details of what dApps are. To be clear, a Dapp is just like any other software application you use. It can be a website or an app on your phone. Dapps differ from traditional apps in that they are built on decentralized networks, such as Ethereum. When you create your own Ethereum smart contract, you're essentially writing a piece of back-end code for a Dapp. While your Dapp will have the same user interface as a traditional application, all or part of the back end will be built on top of Ethereum. This back-end code is written in Ethereum specific languages, including Solidity (most popular), Serpent, and Vyper.\\n\\nIf the smart contract is deployed to ethereum's main network (i.e., production) or even the local test network, your Dapp can execute the code in the smart contract by calling the function printHelloWorld(). But the front end? Does your Dapp need to use any specific language? No! You can use any front-end language/framework you want. But you can host your front-end code on decentralized storage nodes, spreading both your front-end and back-end. Check out technologies like Swarm and IPFS to learn more about decentralized storage. Ok, so Dapps are just applications with part or all of the back end scattered, and maybe even a scattered front end. Why do you care? The development of Dapps is another step towards the future of the Internet, often referred to as Web 3.0.\\n\\nSince the birth of the Internet, the amount of information and human interaction has exploded. We can produce and consume information at a nearly infinite level. Unfortunately, over time, the ability to control this information becomes highly centralized. This includes information about your social life, health, finances, and more. The people who control this information are its ultimate owners and can use it as they see fit. These are essentially middlemen who keep your information on their central servers so that they can provide services to you, such as holding your money, hosting your website, contacting family and friends, etc. With a click of a button, they can completely remove you have no access to this (yours?) Information and all related services. It's a monopoly on the information you produce and consume and the services you use. Fortunately, Web 3.0 has changed all that, and Ethereum Dapps are playing a central role. Web 3.0 is many things, but at its core is a decentralized technology. By decentralizing information and services, big companies and governments will not be able to control Internet users through monopolistic, authoritarian tactics. Ethereum Dapps, with their ability to decentralize information and services, provide a platform for Web 3.0 to provide a completely free (i.e., free) and accessible Internet for everyone. There will no longer be a central point of control, as there will be no middleman to facilitate the flow of information and services.\",\"timestamp\":1641360169,\"title\":\"What is a Dapp?\"},\"digest\":\"Qjl7_jKYW9lnojuFHBuSt3JwIFNOMALXdroZVgKN-LQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x21122e04EC22941969E7764755Ef23131f5A3026\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7lBeMdF6kOP1NgoF8VMQF4BxrPuaUu_p2C702dH19nQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"u3GdxCHoyBLo7Gbw2haM52JWGsuRNgxcSZf7S9_o8d8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"pcTX90laUGw_enyiBFfe7CyT--9BkSSbLiXhHHHT7wjnyAePQdSuc7OCmqhGnK38cz7gur1khq7RdbpPNrURtQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x991735e4f716e27c80bd9834ffbccd1b00f9dd6028be171ca723e3b257572cec742881b68cf56dbf7cd31ecbbc8a7531e052185592e2281904850f61aa3547191c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7lBeMdF6kOP1NgoF8VMQF4BxrPuaUu_p2C702dH19nQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"u3GdxCHoyBLo7Gbw2haM52JWGsuRNgxcSZf7S9_o8d8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Qjl7_jKYW9lnojuFHBuSt3JwIFNOMALXdroZVgKN-LQ\"}"
