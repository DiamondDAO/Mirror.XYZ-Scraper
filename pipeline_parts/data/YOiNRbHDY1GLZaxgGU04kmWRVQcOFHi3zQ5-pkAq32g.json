By this simple mode of employing the power of a steam-engine for canal boat traction, all risk of injury to the banks would be avoided, as the chain and not the water of the canal was the fulcrum or resistance which the steam-engine on the tug-boat operated upon in thus warping its way along the chain; and thus effectually, without slip or other waste of power, dragging along the train of barges attached to the stern of the steam-tug.  I had arranged for two separate chains, so as to allow trains of barges to be conveyed along the canal in opposite directions, without interfering with each other.\\n\\nI submitted a complete set of drawings, and a full description of my design in all its details, to the directors of the Canal Company; and I received a complimentary acknowledgment of them in writing.  But such was the prejudice that existed, in consequence of the injury to the canal banks resulting from the use of paddle Wheels, that it extended to the use of steam power in any form, as a substitute for ordinary horse traction; and although I had taken every care to point out the essential difference of my system (as above indicated) by which all such objections were obviated, my design was at length courteously declined, and the old system of horse traction continued.\\n\\nIn 1845 I had the pleasure to see this simple mode of moving vessels along a definite course in most successful action at the ferry across the Hamoaze at Devonport, in which my system of employing the power of a steam-engine on board the ferry boat, to warp its way along a submerged chain lying along the bottom of the channel from side to side of the ferry, was most ably carried out by my late excellent friend, James Rendell, Esq., C.E., and is still, I believe, in daily action, giving every satisfaction.\\n\\n1. An Instrument for Measuring the Total and Comparative Expansion       of all Solid Bodies.\\n\\nMy kind friend and patron, Professor Leslie, being engaged in some investigations in which it was essential to know the exact comparative total expansion in bulk of metals and other solid bodies, under the same number of degrees of heat, mentioned the subject in the course of conversation.  The instrument at that time in use was defective in principle as well as in construction, and the results of its application were untrustworthy.  As the Professor had done me the honour to request me to assist him in his experiments, I had the happiness to suggest an arrangement of apparatus which I thought might obviate the sources of error; and, with his approval, I proceeded to put it in operation.\\n\\nMy contrivance consisted of an arrangement by means of which the metal bar or other solid substance, whose total expansion under a given number of degrees of heat had to be measured, was in a manner itself converted into a thermometer.  Absolutely equal bulks of each solid were placed inside a metal tube or vessel, and surrounded with an exact equal quantity of water at one and the same normal temperature. A cap or cover, having a suitable length of thermometer tube attached to it, was then screwed down, and the water of the index tube was adjusted to the zero point of the scale attached to it, the whole being at say 50deg of heat, as the normal temperature in each case.  The apparatus was then heated up to say 200deg by immersion in water at that temperature.  The expansion of the enclosed bar of metal or other solid substance under experiment caused the water to rise above the zero, and it was accordingly so indicated on the scale attached to the cap tube.  In this way we had a thermometer whose bulb was for the time being filled with the solid under investigation,--the water surrounding it imply acting as the means by which the expansion of each solid under trial was rendered visible, and its amount capable of being ascertained and recorded with the utmost exactness, as the expansion of the water was in every case the same, and also that of the instrument itself which was \\\"a constant quantity.\\\"\\n\\nIn this way we obtained the correct relative amount of expansion in bulk of all the solid substances experimented upon.  That each bar of metal or other solid substance was of absolutely equal bulk, was readily ascertained by finding that each, when weighed in water, lost the exact same weight.\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  James Nasmyth's Expansometer, 1826.\\n\\nMy friend, Sir David Brewster, was so much pleased with the instrument that he published a drawing and description of it in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal, of which he was then editor.\\n\\n1. A Method of increasing the Effectiveness of Steam by       super-heating it on its Passage from the Boiler to the Engine.\\n\\nOne or the earliest mechanical contrivances which I made was for preventing water, in a liquid form, from passing along with the steam from the boiler to the cylinder of the steam-engine. The first steam-engine I made was employed in grinding oil colours for my father's use in his paintings.  When I set this engine to work for the first time I was annoyed by slight jerks which now and then disturbed the otherwise smooth and regular action of the machine. After careful examination I found that these jerks were caused by the small quantities of water that were occasionally carried along with the current of the steam, and deposited in the cylinder, where it accumulated above and below the piston, and thus produced the jerks.\\n\\nIn order to remove the cause of these irregularities, I placed a considerable portion of the length of the pipe which conveyed the steam from the boiler to the engine within the highly heated side flue of the boiler, so that any portion of water in the liquid form which might chance to pass along with the steam, might, ere it reached the cylinder, traverse this highly-heated steam pipe, and, in doing so, be converted into perfectly dry steam, and in that condition enter the cylinder.  On carrying this simple arrangement into practice, I found the result to be in every way satisfactory.  The active little steam-engine thence-forward performed its work in the most smooth and regular manner.\\n\\nSo far as I am aware, this early effort of mine at mechanical contrivance was the first introduction of what has since been termed \\\"super-heated steam\\\"--a system now extensively employed, and yielding important results, especially in the case of marine steam-engines. Without such means of supplying dry steam to the engines, the latter are specially liable to \\\"break-downs,\\\" resulting from water, in the liquid form, passing into the cylinders along with the steam.\\n\\n1. A Method of \\\"chucking\\\" delicate Metal-work, in order that it may       be turned with perfect truth\\n\\nIn fixing portions of work in the turning-lathe, one of the most important points to attend to is, that while they are held with sufficient firmness in order to be turned to the required form, they should be free from any strain which might in any way distort them. In strong and ponderous objects this can be easily accomplished by due care on the part of an intelligent workman.  It is in operating by the lathe on delicate and flexible objects that the utmost care is requisite in the process of chucking, as they are easily strained out of shape by fastening them by screws and bolts, or suchlike ordinary means.  This is especially the case with disc-like objects.  As I had on several occasions to operate in the lathe with this class of work I contrived a method of chucking or holding them firm while receiving the required turning process, which has in all cases proved most handy and satisfactory.\\n\\nThis method consisted of tinning three, or, if need be, more parts of the work, and laying them down on a tinned face-plate or chuck, which had been heated so as just to cause the solder to flow.  As soon as the solder is cooled and set, the chuck with its attached work may then be put in the lathe, and the work proceeded with until it is completed.  By again heating the chuck, by laying upon it a piece of red-hot iron, the work, however delicate, can be simply lifted off, and will be found perfectly free from all distortion.\\n\\nI have been the more particular in naming the use of three points of attachment to the chuck or face-plate, as that number is naturally free from any risk of distortion.  I have on so many occasions found the great value of this simple yet most secure mode of fixing delicate work in the lathe, that I feel sure that any one able to appreciate its practical value will be highly pleased with the results of its employment.\\n\\nThe same means can, in many cases, be employed in fixing delicate work in the planing-machine.  All that is requisite is to have a clean-planed wrought-iron or brass fixing-plate, to which the work in hand can be attached at a few suitable parts with soft solder, as in the case of the turning lathe above described.\\n\\n1. A Method of casting Specula for Reflecting Telescopes, so as to       ensure perfect Freeness from Defects, at the same time enhancing       the Brilliancy of the Alloy.\\n\\nMy father possessed a very excellent achromatic spy-glass of 2 inches diameter.  The object-glass was made by the celebrated Ramsden. When I was about fifteen I used it to gaze at the moon, planets, and sun-spots.  Although this instrument revealed to me the general characteristic details of these grand objects, my father gave me a wonderful account of what he had seen of the moon's surface by means of a powerful reflecting telescope of 12 inches diameter, made by Short-- that justly celebrated pioneer of telescope making.  It had been erected in a temporary observatory on the Calton Hill, Edinburgh.  These descriptions of my father's so fired me with the desire to obtain a sight of the glorious objects in the heavens through a more powerful instrument than the spy-glass, that I determined to try and make a reflecting telescope which I hoped might in some degree satisfy my ardent desires.\\n\\nI accordingly searched for the requisite practical instruction in the pages of the Encyclopedia Britannica, and in other books that professed to give the necessary technical information on the subject.  I found, however, that the information given in books--at least in the books to which I had access was meagre and unsatisfactory.  Nevertheless I set to work with all earnestness, and began by compounding the requisite alloy for casting a speculum of 8 inches diameter.  This alloy consisted of 32 parts of copper, 15 parts of grain tin, and 1 part of white arsenic. These ingredients, when melted together, yielded a compound metal which possessed a high degree of brilliancy.  Having made a wooden pattern for my intended 8-inch diameter speculum, and moulded it in sand, I cast this my first reflecting telescope speculum according to the best book instructions.  I allowed my casting to cool in the mould in the slowest possible manner; for such is the excessive brittleness of this alloy (though composed of two of the toughest of metals) that in any sudden change of temperature, or want of due delicacy in handling it, it is very apt to give way, and a fracture more or less serious is sure to result.  Even glass, brittle though it be, is strong in comparison with speculum metal of the above proportions, though, as I have said, it yields the most brilliant composition.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the observance of all due care in respect of the annealing of the casting by slow cooling, and the utmost care and delicate handling of it in the process of grinding the surface into the requisite curve and smoothness suitable to receive the final polish,-- I was on more than one occasion inexpressibly mortified by the sudden disruption and breaking up of my speculum.  Thus many hours of anxious care and labour proved of no avail.  I had to begin again and proceed da capo.  I observed, however, that the surplus alloy that was left in the crucible, after I had cast my speculum, when again melted and poured out into a metal ingot mould, yielded a cake that, brittle though it might be, was yet strong in comparison with that of the speculum cast in the sand mould; and that it was also, judging from the fragments chipped from it, possessed of even a higher degree of brilliancy.\\n\\nThe happy thought occurred to me of substituting an open metal mould for the closed sand one.  I soon had the metal mould ready for casting. It consisted of a base plate of cast iron, on the surface of which I placed a ring or hoop of iron turned to fully the diameter of the intended speculum, so as to anticipate the contraction of the alloy. The result of the very first trial of this simple metal mould was most satisfactory.  It yielded me a very perfect casting: and it passed successively through the ordeal of the first rough grinding, and eventually through the processes of polishing, until in the end it exhibited a brilliancy that far exceeded that of the sand mould castings.\\n\\nThe only remaining difficulty that I had to surmount was the risk of defects in the surface of the speculum.  These sometimes result from the first splash  of the melted metal as it is poured into the ring mould. The globules sometimes got oxidised before they became incorporated with the main body of the inflowing molten alloy: and dingy spots in the otherwise brilliant alloy were thus produced.  I soon mastered this, the only remaining source of defect, by a very simple arrangement. In place of pouring the melted alloy direct into the ring mould, I attached to the side of it what I termed a \\\"pouring pocket;\\\" which communicated with an opening at the lower edge of the ring, and by a self-acting arrangement by which the mould plate was slightly tilted up, the influx of the molten alloy advanced in one unbroken tide.  As soon as the entire surface of the mould plate was covered by the alloy, its weight overcame that of my up-tilting counterpoise, and allowed the entire apparatus to resume its exact level.  The resulting speculum was, by these simple arrangements, absolutely perfect in soundness.  It was a perfect casting, in all respects worthy of the care and labour which I invested in its future grinding and polishing, and enabled it to perform its glorious duties as the grand essential part of a noble reflecting telescope!\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]\\n\\nA.

Counterpoise, By which the chill plate is tilted up The largest figure in the engraving is the annealing tub of cast iron filled with sawdust, where the speculum is placed to cool as slowly as possible.\\n\\nThe rationale of the strength of specula cast in this metal mould system, as compared with the treacherous brittleness of those cast in sand moulds, arises simply from the consolidation of the molten metal pool taking place first at the lower surface, next the metal base of the mould--the yet fluid alloy above satisfying the contractile requirements of that immediately beneath it; and so on in succession, until the last to consolidate is the top or upper stratum. Thus all risk of contractile tension, which is so dangerously eminent and inherent in the case of sand-mould castings, made of so exceedingly brittle an alloy as that of speculum metal, is entirely avoided. By the employment of these simple and effective improvements in the art of casting the specula for reflecting telescopes, and also by the contrivance and employment of mechanical means for grinding and polishing them, I at length completed my first 8-inch diameter speculum, and mounted it according to the Newtonian plan.  I was most amply rewarded for all the anxious labour I had gone through in preparing it, by the glorious views it yielded me of the wonderful objects in the heavens at night.  My enjoyment was in no small degree enhanced by the pleasure it gave to my father, and to many intimate friends.  Amongst these was Sir David Brewster, who took a most lively and special interest in all my labours on this subject.\\n\\nIn later years I resumed my telescope making enjoyments, as a delightful and congenial relaxation from the ordinary run of my business occupations.  I constructed several reflecting telescopes, of sizes from 10-inch to 20-inch diameter specula.  I had also the pleasure of assisting other astronomical friends, by casting and grinding specula for them.  Among these I may mention my late dear friend William Lassell, and my excellent friend Warren de la Rue, both of whom have indelibly recorded their names in the annals of astronomical science.  I know of no subject connected with the pursuit of science which so abounds with exciting and delightful interest as that of constructing reflecting telescopes.  It brings into play every principle of constructive art, with the inexpressibly glorious reward of a more intimate acquaintance with the sublime wonders of the heavens, I communicated in full detail all my improvements in the art of casting, grinding, and polishing the specula of reflecting telescopes, to the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester, illustrating my paper with many drawings.  But as my paper was of considerable length, and as the illustrations would prove costly to engrave, it was not published in the Society's Transactions.  They are still, however, kept in the library for reference by those who take a special interest in the subject.\\n\\n1. A Mode of transmitting Rotary Motion by means of a Flexible       Shaft, formed of a Coiled Spiral Wire or Rod of Steel.\\n\\nWhile assisting Mr. Maudslay in the execution of a special piece of machinery, in which it became necessary to have some holes drilled in rather inaccessible portions of the work in hand, and where the employment of the ordinary drill was impossible, it occurred to me that a flexible shaft, formed of a closely coiled spiral of steel wire, might enable us to transmit the requisite rotary motion to a drill attached to the end of this spiral shaft.  Mr. Maudslay was much pleased with the notion, and I speedily put it in action by a close coiled spiral wire of about two feet in length.\\n\\nThis was found to transmit the requisite rotary motion to the drill at the end of the spiral with perfect and faithful efficiency. The difficulty was got over, to Mr. Maudslay's great satisfaction.\\n\\nSo far as I am aware, such a mode of transmitting rotary motion was new and original.  The device was useful, and proved of essential service in other important applications.  By a suitably close coiled spiral steel wire I have conveyed rotary motion quite round an obstacle, such as is indicated in the annexed figure.\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]\\n\\nIt has acted with perfect faithfulness from the winch handle at A to the drill at B.  Any ingenious mechanic will be able to appreciate the value of such a flexible shaft in many applications.  Four years ago I saw the same arrangement in action at a dentist's operating-room, when a drill was worked in the mouth of a patient to enable a decayed tooth to be stopped.  It was said to be the last thing out in \\\"Yankee notions.\\\" It was merely a replica of my flexible drill of 1829.\\n\\n1. A Mode of cutting Square or Hexgonal Collares Nuts or Bolt-Heads       by means of a Revolving File or Cutter.\\n\\nThis method is refrered to, and drawings given, in the text, pp.  141, 142.\\n\\n1. A Investigation into the Origin and Mode of writing the Cuneiform       Character\\n\\nThis will be found described in the next and final chapter\\n\\n1. A Machine for cutting the Key-Grooves in Metal Wheels and Belt       Pulleys, of ANY Diameter.\\n\\nThe fastening of wheels and belt pulleys to shafts, so as to enable them to transmit rotary motion, is one of the most frequently-recurring processes in the construction of machinery.  This is best effected by driving a slightly tapered iron or steel wedge, or \\\"key\\\" as it is technically termed, into a corresponding recess, or flat part of the shaft, so that the wheel and shaft thus become in effect one solid structure.\\n\\nThe old mode of cutting such key-grooves in the eyes of wheels was accomplished by the laborious and costly process of chipping and filing.  Maudslay's mortising machine, which he contrived for the Block machinery, although intended originally to operate upon wood, contained all the essential principles and details required for acting on metals. Mr. Richard Roberts, by some excellent modifications, enabled it to mortise or cut out the key-grooves in metal wheels, and this method soon came into general use.  This machine consisted of a vertical slide bar, to the lower end of which was attached the steel mortising tool, which received its requisite up and down motion from an adjustable crank, through a suitable arrangement of the gearing.  The wheel to be operated upon was fixed to a slide-table, and gradually advanced, so as to cause the mortising tool to take successive cuts through the depth of the eye of the wheel, until the mortise or key-groove had attained its required depth.\\n\\nThe only drawback to this admirable machine was that its service was limited in respect to admitting wheels whose half diameter did not exceed the distance from the back of the jaw of the machine to the face of the mortise tool; so that to give to this machine the requisite rigidity and strength to resist the strain on the jaw, due to the mortising of the key-grooves, in wheels of say 6 feet diameter, a more massive and cumbrous frame work was required, which was most costly in space as well as in money.\\n\\nIn order to obviate this inconvenience, I designed an arrangement of a key-groove mortising machine.  It was capable of operating upon wheels of any diameter, having no limit to it capacity in that respect. It was, at the same time, possessed in respect of the principle on which it was arranged, of the power of taking a much deeper cut, there being an entire absence of any source of springing or elasticity in its structure.  This not only enabled the machine to perform its work with more rapidity, but also with more precision.  Besides, it occupied much less space in the workshop, and did not cost above one-third of the machines formerly in use.  It gave the highest satisfaction to those who availed themselves of its effective Services.\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]\\n\\nA comparison of Fig. 1--which represents the general arrangement of the machine in use previous to the introduction of mine--with that of Fig. 2, may serve to convey some idea of their relative sizes.  Fig. 1 shows a limit to the admission of wheels exceeding 6 feet diameter, Fig. 2 shows an unlimited capability in that respect.\\n\\n1. An Instrument for finding and marking the Centres of Cylindrical       Rods or Bolts about to be turned on the Lathe.\\n\\nOne of the most numerous details in the structure of all classes of machines is the bolts which serve to hold the various parts together. As it is most important that each bolt fits perfectly the hole it belongs to, it is requisite that each bolt should, by the process of turning, be made perfectly cylindrical.  In preparing such bolts, as they come from the forge, in order to undergo the process of turning, they have to be \\\"centred;\\\" that is, each end has to receive a hollow conical indent, which must agree with the axis of the bolt. To find this in the usual mode, by trial and frequent error, is a most tedious process, and consumes much valuable time of the workman as well as his lathe.\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]\\n\\nIn order to obviate the necessity for this costly process, I devised the simple instrument, a drawing of which is annexed.  The use of this enabled any boy to find and mark with absolute exactness and rapidity the centres of each end of bolts, or suchlike  objects.  All that was required was to place the body of the bolt in the V-shaped supports, and to gently cause it to revolve, pressing it longitudinally against the steel-pointed marker, which scratched a neat small circle in the true centre or axis of the bolt.  This small circle had its centre easily marked by the indent of a punch, and the work was thus ready for the lathe.  This humble but really important process was accomplished with ease, rapidity, and great economy.\",\"timestamp\":1639290799,\"title\":\"\\nThe scheme consisted in laying a chain along the bottom of the canal, and of passing any part of its length between three grooved\"},\"digest\":\"f4Cnyev3yRk56M_oIRoo4ylKb8Tmy5Roxq8MYcCCgbA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x98485E752AD42d721892AE055281b72F1cA81833\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"q8OPdFPlLrS-hTPU4_F1cX7DQKxIPGDSYUxRo5WwFyc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"a1fFdvY4IBmQvR7xR8SAFZaUHrmATFAbdMR38LkO6-g\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"qVXrHJWh5fhlpcDOJdAHOXS98OawbWikEvPGa78UwLXQrAUO8igbh2_8RVv6pRgSEp-xTI-b8wLuW_a64QBRiw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x35916c9d1f788b9da40a9ff144fc59cc66fd8a310b9ff98dfa4c97f62574c38f3eb948215b370c383c9c1b30b5267b0748c5e6ebdd2f8265f68cf1da954f55e91c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"q8OPdFPlLrS-hTPU4_F1cX7DQKxIPGDSYUxRo5WwFyc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"a1fFdvY4IBmQvR7xR8SAFZaUHrmATFAbdMR38LkO6-g\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"f4Cnyev3yRk56M_oIRoo4ylKb8Tmy5Roxq8MYcCCgbA\"}"
