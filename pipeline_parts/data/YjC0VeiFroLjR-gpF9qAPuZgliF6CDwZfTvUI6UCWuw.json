"{\"content\":{\"body\":\" 1. Without a doubt, Web3.0 is in its first hype cycle. Many more are bound to come - just like with previous tech cycles. By the time it is mature, it will probably even be called something completely different. Just like we don’t call the Internet Information-Superhighway any longer.\\n 2. Web3.0 will be misunderstood for long and create many unfulfilled expectations - just like with previous tech cycles. Short term, it will be overrated - but long-term it will be underrated. Most of what is done now will prove to be a waste of time and fail - but out of it will grow what follows after FANG (Meta, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet).\\n 3. As usual, analogies are both futile and helpful. One of them ist that Web3.0 is now where Web1.0 was with the launch of Marc Andreessen’s Netscape browser.\\n 4. Gavin Wood, Cofounder of Polkadot and Codeveloper of Etherium, coined the expression already in 2014. Web3.0 is a technological evolution with significant transformations for businesses and consumers. It comes with a number of promises - at its core is the promise that it will give superpowers to consumers - and to communities. All in all, it will combine tokenisation, ownership, decentralisation the meta verse into a new era of digital.\\n 5. Web3.0 comes with a strong counter-cultural, almost romantic, touch. It promises to finally deliver the goods that Web2.0 not only failed to deliver - but turned on its head: democratisation, empowerment, control and freedom. Personally, I doubt it will be that simple. After all, historically, the 1% has always found a way to successfully disempower the 99%.\\n 6. The tokenisation of everything: Blockchain and smart-contract-based Tokenisation will be a core-enabler of the changes to come. Marc Andreessen famously remarked that software will be eating the world. In its latest cycle, it is tokenisation that will be eating the word.\\n 7. The transition from Web2.0 to Web3.0 entails a number of shifts: From central storage to decentralised storage. From having to trust a third party for transactions to trustless, permissonless transactions. From 3rdparty payment systems to native built-in payments. From centralised platforms - that capture all value - to community-based structures that allocate value to those that create it.\\n 8. It will distributed and robust - and thus offer a high degree of censorship resistance and a high degree of privacy. It will be self-governing - and it will allow for new, much more partcicipatory ways to build companies (DAOs). Basically, it will be nothing short of paradise - compared with Web2.0 - where evil billionaires generate huge profits by manipulating you and by stealing all your content/data - yet still don’t pay taxes.\\n 9. Unsurprisingly, Marc Zuckerberg will be the personification of evil in this new era. But maybe he is lucky and will go down as the Carnegie of the 21st century: A ruthless robber-barron that needed to be overcome and brought under control.\\n10. Art, games and music will be the first segments that will be significantly disrupted. For example: In art and music, NFT will bring back to digital what seemed lost for good: The idea of scarcity, the idea of having original. In games, it lets players own and trade with their assets (avatars, skins). It will shift games business models from being extractive to being participative. It will allow for a new era of digital asset sovereignty.\\n11. While much is unknowable and while stakes are high: Don’t miss out on the most fascinating changes in digital since it’s beginnings\",\"timestamp\":1639087357,\"title\":\"The promises of Web3.0: Can it deliver the goods that Web2.0 didn’t?\"},\"digest\":\"Jz2HMb_YbXyQfxdHg1M8sscMUt2ZNGCeGLfoQyUOoUA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8A91e57ec2CBcbF462c2Dd707cf749e693C8a097\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hGnFN6ocPBKWFxE17BCNu9R1t1ZPxjtxXpDFDSwj3Ps\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"itOk2xsZZN1jMuUrC0EcCRa6_kcQB8xv18zcu1DIrtA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Ops5lTPQimjeDd9g7VQI2LfOjtBBTbUbz7ZT76LcxozB40S8q_f2Ntdszr25BRm6a-X8N3ghn96yZ-Sj63A-rQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe984dfcd4074d75997eb0c447c38f5a6eb606030edbac44175270dcd49c380970b98e69a5ac6d774d9311dc91b8b3754e981b39842f32850238e2aa15328a0891b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hGnFN6ocPBKWFxE17BCNu9R1t1ZPxjtxXpDFDSwj3Ps\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"itOk2xsZZN1jMuUrC0EcCRa6_kcQB8xv18zcu1DIrtA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Jz2HMb_YbXyQfxdHg1M8sscMUt2ZNGCeGLfoQyUOoUA\"}"
