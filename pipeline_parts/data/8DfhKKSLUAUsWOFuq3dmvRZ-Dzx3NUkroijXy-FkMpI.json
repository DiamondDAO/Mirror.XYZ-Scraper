Community does not scale as well as technology; the sauce behind the most successful NFT marketplaces is that they've scaled slowly, and have created a unique sense of identity and belonging. The downside is that most people are locked out of creating their own slice of Internet that they can choose to monetize if they wish.\\\"\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e7028455-39dd-491b-bff1-771f04a4b44e.jpg?height=413&width=596)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Universal Creative Income\\n\\nhttps://li.mirror.xyz/j3WsyvI5LKFKcFc9YK6cwzpU131Gs-N8ynGh3Jkli_g\\n\\n\\\"The idea is simple: use company revenue to fund a Universal Creative Income program for emerging creators on the platform. For instance, companies like Facebook or YouTube could carve out a fund to support creators on the platform and send them a monthly check to cover basic living expenses, regardless of skill, training, or background. UCI differs from most prevailing platform creator funds in terms of consistency of payments, transparency of eligibility criteria, and focus on smaller emerging creators.\\\"\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1f707b79-d9cd-409e-9e40-9b1c39650c94.jpg?height=407&width=605)\\n\\n### The playbook\\n\\nhttps://p.mirror.xyz/1EpvJwUpx_KlRcHOKLNqADEkwHL_Z1ZYKobF2uLwgBg\\n\\n\\\"Creator-focused protocols will have community-led decision committees, native protocol tokens for governance, value capture, and utility, decentralized grant programs, [universal creator income](https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class), an open developer ecosystem, pseudonymous collectives, degen investment clubs, protocol politicians, and more.\\n\\nA couple years ago this may have sounded like another one of those idealistic crypto narratives that would never actually work in practice. But it's already happening. Since 2018, DeFi protocols like Uniswap, Compound, and AAVE have earned billion dollar treasuries, launched protocol tokens, and started experimenting with community-led initiatives like grant programs.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0f7c2e4f-a714-4e43-876d-01b3ed2b7d67.png?height=992&width=709)\\n\\n### Convex Mirror\\n\\nhttps://blog.gnosis.pm/inventories-not-identities-7da9a4ec5a3e\\n\\nThis is a fascinating piece From [Kei Kreutler](https://kei.mirror.xyz/) that I missed when it was first published.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a5cb7706-1b24-4183-88a7-1dd2af0d93e4.png?height=537&width=816)\\n\\n**All images by Julien Priez.**\\n\\n**Impossible Object publishes innovative books and uses a blend of both legacy and crypto workflows to create new kinds of book. https://www.impossible-object.io/.**\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1619169708,\"title\":\"Mirrorball #3\",\"publication\":\"r\"},\"digest\":\"ELP_0O8KWDEC1h8X9z2Zv1o7WVcGREIHMpcfnZMr6-s\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xc46E9a66FDdC8D1a69529d86E668236f02957F1b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2gOreeFuSTzHTbTHh9VLYOVAbQObud6uGR8QKO8hX68\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mIcvZP41c-qLBmjZN1LVVaBuBBW6rZ4AdumfCBqht0c\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"-XlCwcbugceuexj2sC_kiCb8D5XdX_ntJ-AbzEq00YRI2znFaHbhBPhOh0ZPVhR8KvxSP0lGzfACLJil2Ww8KQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa12ba6931bea4c7bc2184de485923a78b6af767e47b5366ba29378cf7e8f474c40cd9c51f95dc6b0f445745db5e88230c78ae1e3421b36703b7d474fbda0c57f1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on r.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2gOreeFuSTzHTbTHh9VLYOVAbQObud6uGR8QKO8hX68\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mIcvZP41c-qLBmjZN1LVVaBuBBW6rZ4AdumfCBqht0c\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ELP_0O8KWDEC1h8X9z2Zv1o7WVcGREIHMpcfnZMr6-s\"}"
