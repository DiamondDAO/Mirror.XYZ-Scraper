"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### Prologue - \\\"Are you from the future?\\\"\\n\\nThere are two questions that, sooner or later, everyone who bumps into these diaries ends up asking me.\\n\\nThe first one is quite obvious: \\\"Are you from the future?\\\"\\n\\nWell... the answer depends on interpretation, since I’m not really from the future, I’ve merely visited it. Hard to believe? It’s understandable. However — and I apologize if I am overstepping here — I would like to ask for the benefit of the doubt.\\n\\nIt is worth saying that before all of this happened, I was just another IT professional. Frustrated, both with my career and with the world, I used to devote my scarce free time to a failed existential search; tirelessly seeking, wherever I went, nothing less than the very meaning of life.\\n\\nThat’s, of course, until \\\"day zero\\\"; the landmark of my first spacetime journey, and from which things have never been the same. The experience was so striking that at one point I asked if I could keep a diary. The request was received by my mentors with great enthusiasm, but authorized under one condition: that I would openly share it upon my return.\\n\\nAs Niliph told me, on the eve of his 237th birthday: \\\"Yesterday a deposit was issued, one of a credit that shall only be invested now\\\". The words made no sense when I heard them, but like so many others recorded during my journey, their meanings insist on hiding far beyond the first impressions.\\n\\nAnd although I had signed a commitment, I confess that in the end I did not desire to return. I did not want to give up the clean air, the gentle hugs and the inexplicable feeling of belonging to a collective where each and everyone works to improve themselves.\\n\\nSome would say I visited a utopia, only I can’t see it that way. A utopia, by definition, can only be so as long as it is still in the future, and should it happen in the present time, it can no longer be called that. No, that place was something different…\\n\\n\\\"That place\\\", in fact, is what I call Tokenverse: the spacetime of a mysterious human civilization, much wiser and harmonic. Instead of governments, banks, and megacorporations, there are people — or rather, people and tokens!\\n\\nIf you do not know what tokens are, do not worry, for so far no one you know truly understands it. For now, I can tell you that tokenizing is a way of learning to appreciate the value of things. It may not be intentional, but, wherever there is a number, the value it indicates can be questioned. And in the end, the search for the real value of things is an essential step in unraveling the very mystery of being human.\\n\\n10 SELF tokens per 0.5 GAYA tokens during the Steps of Awen. It was the first transaction that showed me how everything can be different, and how we still know very little about what to do with the time we are given.\\n\\nStill hard to believe? It remains understandable… even so, it’s possible that you have felt mysteriously attracted to this future, and if that’s the case, then rest assured that my diaries are for you. I sincerely hope that it’s reading brings a new perspective on what we are; one forged by the glimpse and reflections of what we will still turn out to be.\\n\\nAh, of course... I almost forgot the last question:\\n\\n\\\"Is Tokenverse really the future that awaits us? Will it be possible?\\\"\\n\\nI myself asked this question at the end of my first journey, and since then I carry the answer that I received as a great motto of life:\\n\\n\\\"Aren’t all futures possible?\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1641077781,\"title\":\"Namascoin and the Diaries of the Tokenverse - DØ - Prologue\"},\"digest\":\"h9PDdc533Qx4NQgAqyC_IAvMqE7g8ouh_Zc3fmSlsiE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xf1Bfb00c3716307Bb0a5F70bDC8d07C418910Ef0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GFRNKQdjgekpqMvPG0uZwmi_yru772YwcM2PYMNhNHE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"d2XTpFWGj6JjwymRUPkeIhU38dITjyZ2wjoMgtldQZ4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"SFbz9sNuJymBU4ZMOFgeD6MKZxMqpWx5LhCGFfT62COpape8FfDoPxcjnQi2EEq77c6VOnai_peQhCotFXr-6w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9903039cc8ed5f9f01d88c82797ffbfef2713d35ae42bf72e9a8949800dda87b0895126d6b0f15cc153b3348f757125bf420f43d1c1cea6a5ebb8b549a4d65651b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GFRNKQdjgekpqMvPG0uZwmi_yru772YwcM2PYMNhNHE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"d2XTpFWGj6JjwymRUPkeIhU38dITjyZ2wjoMgtldQZ4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"h9PDdc533Qx4NQgAqyC_IAvMqE7g8ouh_Zc3fmSlsiE\"}"
