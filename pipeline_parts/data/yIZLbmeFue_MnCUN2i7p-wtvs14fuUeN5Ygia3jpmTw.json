"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1942, Chicago\\n\\nHidden under the stands of a football field, at the University of Chicago, was a pile of bricks. A heap of graphite, uranium oxide and metal, which couldn't even power a light bulb, was proof that both tragedy and triumph was coming.\\n\\nThe Atomic Age was born December 2, 1942. Its fathers included scientists who spoke English with a strange accent, had superhuman minds, from an exotic land. One of them joked this was proof of aliens - that the Hungarian scientists involved were Martians.\\n\\nThe joker was Leo Szilard, father of the nuclear reactor. He helped scientists flee to America during WW II. He was among the first to connect thermodynamics to information theory. After the war he moved on to biology, involved in the first cloning of the human cell and nuclear medicine.\\n\\n\\\"Do not destroy what you cannot create.\\\" - Leo Szilard\\n\\n2871\\n\\nYear 2X21 minus 50, Asteroid Belt Research Lab\\n\\n\\\"It's a stable field, self-sustained. John, you did it. The Manifold works.”\\n\\n\\\"It's not good. They'll go for the first use case. Not tweaking space-time for new worlds, upgrading humanity, or sending us to the stars. They want guns, not the book of Genesis.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's official, they know about these results. They want a test. On a live target. They're going to ask for someone to watch oversee deployment. Big Jake Tagore's son, \\\"Junior\\\", will be in command.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A waste, we can upgrade the 'Verse to something like a cross between the real world and the ‘Verse. The total computing power of the System could run on it. We can even entangle it all. No more local 'Verses and \\\"Fogs\\\". The stars would be in reach. Don't tell anyone, but it's part of my designs for the \\\"ALEPs\\\". The \\\"Autonomous Learning Entity Programs\\\" could be part of the next stage in our development.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"John, promise me you won't talk about any of this in front of the leadership. For your sake.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I want to remind them that our minds can both destroy and create. We’ve lost the past. We can make the future.”\",\"timestamp\":1633920702,\"title\":\"2921: 3.19 Martians of the 20th Century, 2871\"},\"digest\":\"dkNQlCKd-t_wqxTlP7UUbonK_L1RThs9J9WZ9MsAGaM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"oA1UoRavXgm2rgYM9-uIVnYnrDPkBembb-7e0IidlckCQjjfbcl3g0nzAXSip9Eqz_f6FSGp1TVM2rsgyCZT6w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"t7a8DyFGKvn1IIe0t9A7GjhZsqQiQmHwS2TzR_WjvTw\"}"
