I had an eight month internship at Tesla in 2018. There I became a fan of Elon Musk and his way of thinking. It is obvious to those who know, that Tesla could not be where it is today without him, but could Tesla still reach its lofty and long dated goals without him? Since company leadership is mainly in the strategy layer, I came up with a stratification based on the bounds and bases of knowledge used to make company decisions. These bounds and bases are: information theory, physical theory and conscious theory.\\n\\n![Three pillars](https://miro.medium.com/max/560/0\\\\*ZLuTz_VQzCv0Yst-.jpg)\\n\\nThey are both bounds and bases because they are the floor and the ceiling of the design space. For example, the more you know of physics the more interesting designs you can potentially think of, but also, the more your limits are clear to you. Your designs cannot break the known laws of physics. Likewise, the more math and logic you know the better software you could build, but you cannot go against rules of logic or the axioms of mathematics. I think of this as a horizontal layering, vertical sections of the company built on these bases and governed by these bounds. They are not totally walled off, rather they all intermix.\\n\\nA leader has to have mastery of all these sectors or at least one. Elon is well trained in physical theory and information theory. Tesla cars are some of the best designed because they are based on physics, not industry standard. The car software is also top of class. Though, Elon has always had issues working with people. This is why he works best with a number two who handles the day to day operations and human capital allocation.\\n\\nThe corporate structure today is defined by a singular head, the CEO. They are the final decision maker on all aspects of the company. But, I think this is misguided. It requires either an individual to master all three layers or have a lopsided government, where more power is given to the sector the CEO masters over the others (at Tesla, physical sector and informational sector goals can often take priority over human capital management). I believe the ideal structure of company leadership is a tribunal seated by heads of each sector, a head of bits (information theory), a head of atoms(physical theory) and a head of capital (conscious theory). This gives equal weighting to each sector and allows for each head to have deeper mastery by concentrating their focus.\\n\\nIn summary, I believe there are three horizontal layers to a company; the physical, informational and conscious. The physical sector is bound by the laws of physics and deals with atoms involved in the product and production capacity. The information sector is bound by the axioms of math and logic. It deals with the software and algorithms involved in the P and PC. The conscious sector is bound by the biological structures of consciousness and deals with the allocation and management of human and capital resources. It is necessary to have an individual with mastery in each of the three sectors to successfully lead a company.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1640831409,\"title\":\"The Foundational Matrix of Companies (part 2) \"},\"digest\":\"fN9a4mrC74e9q-YCXv8B8aDJ65NyGeUDB7ESIa3R_Cs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x34E27bb83d081ddfdA3dCBA5503555CAC89D7169\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RdeRUjoAIzijlloChKuS2_Gy-IhCUC44EL464PJqDjw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FuydOSAeCZ9pA34nLOQ2oca6RbERqI-WDvi9GUExZ7A\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"lkGIltX3b1DXGi3VDwEOjEJrGy9_72aa18nP-Q3yV3ieb-tI_opatfkmMkewELeviPqTSnLWrJAm76tPnj1NpQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x6a2fb253e0d4dcc8774da27773e03eacd49c6a471f9bb7d32af22611988b3534626738165e22496aefe8ca910fc6687f93b85127fce86c3e072b44ddacf73dee1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RdeRUjoAIzijlloChKuS2_Gy-IhCUC44EL464PJqDjw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FuydOSAeCZ9pA34nLOQ2oca6RbERqI-WDvi9GUExZ7A\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"fN9a4mrC74e9q-YCXv8B8aDJ65NyGeUDB7ESIa3R_Cs\"}"
