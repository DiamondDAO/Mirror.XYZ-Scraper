"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"About 7 years ago, I never gave a thought to the ethnicity of …well, anyone. I didn’t give two fucks about identifying as heterosexual, male, or white. I wasn’t tallying the number of non-whites on TV commercials, and I couldn’t fathom the possibility that the graduate school I was attending would ever push for a racially segregated graduation ceremony. \\n\\n### Reality\\n\\nBut now the world demands identification… so here’s a few facts about me. I grew up in one of the only large towns in America where white folks are a minority. The Asian demographic are the kings of our public school district. Our mayor was an immigration lawyer who plastered “Move to Edison, NJ” billboards throughout India when the H-1B visa foreshadowed the hollowing of the American middle class. I am first generation college educated; my parents are high school graduates who were deeply insistent that I get myself into a “union job” cause “benefits.” Dad worked 30+ years in a utility company; Mom’s brothers were police and fire, and she worked her later years as a secretary in the school district. My father’s family abandoned him when he was 15, and my grandmother told my mother she was supposed to be an abortion. Before my grandmother died, my eldest uncle mindfucked her Alzheimer’s, motivating her to rewrite her last will and testament, removing my mother from every cent of a small inheritance. Welcome to my white privilege.\\n\\nOne of the voids that weighs on my sense of identity is the complete lack of historical context around anything I might call “family.” I’m a mix of many different European nationalities, but my mother’s family bequeathed a connection to the Hungarian church in New Brunswick, along with recipes for chicken paprikash, stuffed cabbage, and dumplings. I know that my maternal grandfather fought in the Korean War, and my paternal grandfather was in the Navy before he died; my father was 10 at the time of his death. Nonetheless, there were no stories of previous generations, family history, immigration, success, failure, etc. I feel a near-zero connection with any approximation of a family legacy. We have none. It’s personally disappointing… but I don’t want your sympathy, and I’m not looking for “recognition.” \\n\\n### Postmodern Idiocy\\n\\nLet’s skip over the bullshit of the last 6-7 years, cause there’s no sense in rehashing the birth of narcissistic victimhood. Instead, let’s state the expectations of the racist, sexist, woke congregation: First, I’m supposed to be so fucking privileged that it’s now my duty to cower to everyone who is not male, white, and heterosexual. Why do these fucktards demand this masochistic groveling? Well it should be fucking obvious that (1) as a man, I intimidate and beat the shit out of anyone I want whenever I want, (2) the rich, white utopia has blessed me with acres of idyllic property populated with fairies that fart gold coins and rainbows, and (3) heterosexuals have perfect relationships and get to fuck everyone they could ever want to fuck.\\n\\nMy woke brethren also teach me that my post-graduate degrees (several of them) were not earned… because (1) all the subjects I’ve ever learned were specifically engineered for white people, (2) my white parents were given golden tickets with my birth certificate for the local college, and (3) all I ever had to do was wink at my Asian professors and those model minorities gave me a hug and an A in all my upper level courses. \\n\\nAmazingly, I’ve learned that the best part about being white is that every little bit of effort I’ve ever donated to a task was a tragically unnecessary waste of time! America is so fucking white that I breeze through job interviews like Larry Bird makes jump shots. I only work with other white, heterosexual men who don’t even care if I have a degree! In the interview they saw how pale I was, showed me a picture of Carrie Underwood in a bikini to check for penile blood flow, and that was all it took before they showed me the champagne room.  Then they asked me what salary I think I deserve without even describing what they wanted me to do. \\n\\nWho knew that being white makes you so auto-magically successful? \\n\\nThe Woke. They knew. \\n\\nThey know that (1) we white folks need to be re-educated out of this Garden of White Eden, (2) any time two white heterosexual men might end up in the same room, we can’t help ourselves but share racist and sexist jokes about the last BIPOC we took advantage of, and (3) if anyone’s skin color and/or sexuality makes them personally miserable, then it is a white heterosexual man’s responsibility to descend from our godly pedestal and help transmute that sad, sad misery. Who else can save the Wokenocrats if not us privileged white heterosexual men? Certainly, I never thought of myself as a white savior… but they’ve taught me that I have no choice… it’s who they need me to be. \\n\\n### Ludicrous Speed\\n\\nThe insanity of the few paragraphs above should offend everyone. It’s an asinine, imbecilic, head-up-your-ass, fixed-victimhood, projected-utopia mindset. It’s so far from any semblance of truth that it’s practically a suggestion of violence. If you simply look at me and make a public claim that I was born with guaranteed privileges, you are asking for a fight. In the vein of the unsolicited use of the ‘N’ word, it will not be long until these kinds of suggestions are met with a fist. \\n\\nIt is not just BIPOC and LGBTQ++++… who are pissed off. Everyone is pissed off. We’re all sick of the judgement, the fighting, the politics, the inflation, the division, the corporate takeover, the medical self-righteousness, the lying liars of our govt, the parasites in Pharma and Banking, the military interventionists that rape the world at large… We’re all sick of this unethical cesspool of elite scumbags. These elites are not an ethnic supremacist group… they are from decades of corruption and wealth. They are monarchs and family banking dynasties. They are military generals with board seats on global private equity funds. They are Japanese, Saudi, Swiss, Jewish, Emirati, Anglo, Dutch, Brazilian, Moroccan, Spanish, and American. They are the power behind the power. They fund BLM in America and Neo-Nazis in The Ukraine. It’s not necessarily a conspiracy… it’s the way to keep the young idiots fighting with the old idiots, no matter where you’re from. While it is unbelievably clear to me that the real enemy is this globalist oligarchy, the Woke idiocracy would rather make the closest white person into a subservient coward than work together to take the people’s power back from the puppet duopoly that enables these globalist scumsuckers to pillage our future.\\n\\nAs a liberal-minded, well-educated, blue-collar family member who firmly believes in progressive values, I have been forced to denounce all of this Alt-Far-Leftist bullshit for the sake of family-preservation. The Woke have announced, in no uncertain terms, that my family and I are their sworn enemy. I have no value in their revolutionary regime.  So while we’re not far from the complete collapse of two centuries of American cultural capital--the intellectual capital that created the world’s most influential institutions--the Woke are accelerating that destruction, and making any collective progress against the globalist technocracy completely impossible. \\n\\nIf the pendulum doesn’t begin to swing backward and away from the far Left spectrum of Wokeism, the people who KNOW that these Woke Fucks are single-handedly destroying this country’s cultural and intellectual capital are likely to get violent. There will be a deep, dark resistance at the twilight, before the Woke take it all down into their vacant misery. \",\"timestamp\":1640648339,\"title\":\"How The Woke Are Destroying White Civility...\"},\"digest\":\"wEPkM4-aZd5kEIzfWQvqXD1UQbFn6PPGbLbfWeVhN28\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0442E49c1aC33a3FaF93D3301a1cB28C688DA753\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kvwVh31MdtHPskJxszFikL050CrtB2l0o-sZCZyiUIM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"6aytP4Zx0DE7DjmvGCFgZpmMsgP8YAtQT_JBPlndKOk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"p14MAXaPZ9gBQuavRZNqFH7vZDARBzcBL6ZB0O3vjV4dy22Q2y_XmVExTPtd_yPpHcTjP6VpktTz8Lu1TT7hjw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8c378ca6e8b300c8a9731c125fcea109ee13bc3c3c7417d6caff7fdf8cd65a7d3e1f0c54884c46682a1eb10ed432fc631597ff405ab57a6dd6cb9a59a0e30f761c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kvwVh31MdtHPskJxszFikL050CrtB2l0o-sZCZyiUIM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"6aytP4Zx0DE7DjmvGCFgZpmMsgP8YAtQT_JBPlndKOk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wEPkM4-aZd5kEIzfWQvqXD1UQbFn6PPGbLbfWeVhN28\"}"
