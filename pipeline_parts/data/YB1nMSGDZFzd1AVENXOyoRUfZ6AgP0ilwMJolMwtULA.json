"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Last week I read [an article on LOOP which was full of great ideas how we could drive more utility to the LOOPR token](https://www.loop.markets/swiss-loopr-knife/). Of course I also think we currently already have very much good stuff in the pipeline for the LOOP ecosystem (DEX, NFT marketplace, â€¦). But as long as we are that early, it's never too late to make up your mind of what you think the LOOP site could also be like in the future:\\n\\nWhat should LOOP represent?\\n\\nWhat else (beside current plans) could make you or others come here over and over again?\\n\\nWhat kind of possibilities are lying out there which are may be worth to focus more on than others?\\n\\nI don't write the next lines because I think this should be included in LOOP tomorrow or maybe even at all. It should be seen more as a few ideas of what might be possible in the future:\\n\\nLOOP Gaming Beta Testing For Users Improving Game Development In Early Cycles By Feedback & Early Game Marketing\\n\\nor\\n\\nwen games??? oO\\n\\n* Especially for innovative and generally new games, you as a developer are usually happy with people which are\\n* â€“ unbiased toward the project\\n* â€“ not only interested but also at least some experienced and familiar in the crypto and/or gaming space\\n* â€“ really interested in testing these products (not because they have to, but they want to)\\n\\nTo me, this sounds like a perfect match for the LOOP community, where you are likely to find all of these factors combined. In addition, all members have an account with which they can write about the game experience and probably are likely to do so. Especially if this is incentivized somehow.\\n\\nFor the developers, this creates valuable detailed early feedback as well as marketing for the game as well as a strong early relation to future loyal user base. Excellent developers will also listen to what the beta testers say and try to improve on that in the next iteration. This shows transparently how \\\"good\\\" the company is with setting and reaching its own goals.\\n\\nFor a crypto gaming developer, it's just the right amount of marketing at the beginning which isn't too much, but also not too little to test out the early responses for your product. Of course, there are games in development which prefer to not go outside into the public before their project has reached some minimum level of quality. But I guess a lot or even most developers would really appreciate this way of getting relatively easy and early test results of valuable \\\"fitting quality users\\\". This way, a lot of games can result in a better game experience for the user with less effort and happily engaging users from the LOOP community.\\n\\nIf you have any doubt that online desktop and/or mobile games on the blockchain are highly likely to be the next new big thing, take a look at these numbers and relations:\\n\\nâ€“ there are approximately 2.5 billion gamers right now. Covid lockdowns also driven this user count even higher. Not only because of that trend is rather increasing than decreasing. Independent of cryptos\\n\\nâ€“ crypto games are now just getting started: [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), [My Neighbor Alice](https://www.myneighboralice.com/), [Splinterlands](https://splinterlands.com/) and many others led the early success of crypto games this year. [Neo Tokio](https://neotokyo.codes/) from Elio and Alex Becker is already setting some kind of new standard, [MonkeyBall](https://www.monkeyball.com/) is coming soon ([participate in the MonekyBall $MBS airdrop & NFT giveaway until end of november here](https://gleam.io/jvIyk/monkeybucks-mbs-nft-giveaway?gsr=jvIyk-mU5N6mhjJA)). [SuperFarm](https://superfarm.com/) will liekly improve the whole industry further through innovation. [StarAtlas](https://staratlas.com/) also may have potential to set new standards. Also exciting to see how [Derby Stars](https://derbystars.com/) will look as one of the first metaverse NFT games on Terra LUNA.\\n\\nIf you're in cryptos for a while you allready know and these examples show: \\\"There's much going on in crypto gaming\\\" is really a heavy understatement right now!\\n\\nTo put it more simple by looking at the numbers:\\n\\nâ€“ current active (mainly non crypto) game users: \\\\~3.24 billion ([source](https://www.google.com/search?q=active+gamers+in+the+world))\\n\\nâ€“ current active blockchain users: \\\\~300 million ([source1](https://www.google.com/search?q=active+crypto+users+in+the+world), [source2](https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership/))\\n\\nâ€“ current active blockchain gaming users: a small percentage of this 300 million. I think 10% would be already too high, this would mean around 30 million.\\n\\nIf we compare 30 million to 3.24 billion we get:\\n\\n30,000,000 : 3.240,000,000\\n\\n1 : 108\\n\\nThese figures show that we likely have a potential growth of 100x ahead of us. The more realistic outview might honestly be even more bullish because I already assumed 10% of crypto users playing â€“ which is unlikely. More realistic around 5% or less. So it would be a 200x growth potential or more.\\n\\nAlso factor in what kind of new innovative games in different areas of our daily life will probably soon be possible to be developed. Everyone that can is now somehow coming out and wants to build metaverses. After Mark Zuckerbergs meta hype kickoff announcement, suddenly almost everyone has some kind of a metaverse plan. The [Winkelvoss Twins followed immediately with a great response](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/122856/firm-backed-by-alan-howard-winklevoss-twins-closes-100-million-metaverse-fund), [then Microsoft](https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-shares-metaverse-plans-talks-about-users-immersive-experience-on-ms-teams-10112821.html) and now [Niantic the company behind PokemonGo had a big announcement](https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/niantic-reveals-its-vision-for-a-real-world-metaverse-releases-lightship-ar-developer-kit/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMV13-1G0YnuXjmdPj7q3CtecxrclOL8_To0Bsb-HP8NWmJOQ6mRBvs71psiN0nDbvm9QM_8kea9Gu1-7M6jrc4IszK_8hX6xNWjuARyhLaBBpAOWhRwAJk5L4u4aaOs8jqQtC3CJ8SqURd6bRh7uUZKcA03eGk1hb8KYe2FnpX3). They will open their development kit enabling everyone an option to build their own metaverse with their technology. It's also allready a nice battle in pros and cons between virtual reality (meta) vs. augmented reality (Niantic). I guess time will tell which use cases are more appropriate for one or the other. Also central vs. decentralÂ will unlikely be 100% black or white in the short to mid term. I think there lies very much value in combining decentralisation where it is good and favourable but also centralisation where it's still needed. [XIS7 combines these two opposing approaches very well](https://www.xis7.com/?affiliate=1b3c8b20-3ffb-42f1-a0ae-bf756dd9aac2). They are still relatively unknown because development is in it's final stages and they are going to launch soon. If you're interested [you can buy land here (e.g. Soccercoin Secret Hotspot is interesting) or may be still get in the presale](https://www.xis7.com/?affiliate=1b3c8b20-3ffb-42f1-a0ae-bf756dd9aac2) (I heard should be live on website soon).\\n\\nThe next upcoming times will therefore likely create a bridge between VR technologies, metaverses, games, blockchain, play to earn and most important new kinds of users. It's a little bit like \\\"back in the old days\\\" when almost no older people were really using smartphones. Steve Jobs made people and especially the older generation heavily get involved.\\n\\nI project Games, augmented/virtual reality, metaverses, play to earn and blockchain will kind of do the same in the future and attract more new people which normally never would have played games in the past. So my personal outview on this is even better.\\n\\nEven if we now just pessimistically assume that we have already way more crypto users and will see a rather slow transfer from traditional computer games to the blockchain. We can still see how early we are and how much room for improvement there still is. Therefore, it's realistic to assume that the LOOP community could potentially also contribute a large part to the blockchain game development with positive results for:\\n\\nâ€“ game developers\\n\\nâ€“ users getting to know about the game\\n\\nâ€“ users playing the game\\n\\nâ€“ users giving honest feedback for playing the game\\n\\nâ€“ users help to improve the game for future users\\n\\nâ€“ multiple networks & marketing effects through this\\n\\nCombine this with rewards for people participating in this as an incentive, and I guess it should be great. Also, maybe include random rewards to make it more fun. Why random? Many researches have shown that random rewards create the most active and likely loyal users. Random rewards for every participating user in like five games to choose from will also likely result in users just choosing what they really like and not where the most rewards are â€¦ You would have to factor in things like this to really make it usable, attractive and therefore long term successful and effective for both sides: Beta tester users AND developers\\n\\nThanks again at [Opa for inspiring](https://www.loop.markets/swiss-loopr-knife/) me to this article! This article here actually started as just a normal comment that I wanted to write under his article. As some of you guys may have noticed, I often have a hard time giving short comments .. ðŸ˜€ So I took this as an opportunity to create a \\\"short\\\" article out of it.\\n\\nWhat do you think about this? Would you like to play early-stage blockchain related games to help developers and future users? Maybe you have some other ideas about this?
