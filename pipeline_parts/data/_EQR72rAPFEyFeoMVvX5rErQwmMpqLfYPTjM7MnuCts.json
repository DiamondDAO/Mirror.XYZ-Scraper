Hope you are as stoked as us for another issue of our weekly newsletter, the Concave Echo!\\n\\nThe Concave Echo is a weekly newsletter where we recap the most recent developments in Concave, while highlighting some of the amazing contributions from the community. Now without further ado, let us get started!\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n* Concave Gaming Hub\\n* Genesis & Angel Role\\n* Gather World Preview\\n* Team Interview with GrapeApe\\n* Concave Hermeticum\\n* Miner of the Week\\n* Other Community Contributions\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n## Concave Gaming Hub\\n\\nThrough our Concubator channels, Karan has created a sweet Concave gaming hub where miners can go and play games in the future. In the future, the gaming hub will be a place where you can receive community gaming event updates, play Concave arcade games, participate in lotteries, and more. The gaming hub is the first initiative to expand upon the Concave gaming ecosystem, which the community team will elaborate more on in the future. While the hub is still a work in progress, you can take a look at the website preview [here](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qma7LtvPkcgRi3K6oSkQREAg6pDeBrBw6gpQstmPQxbW7S/).\\n\\n![](https://concave.lol/blog/content/images/2022/01/unknown--10-.png)\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n## Genesis & Angel Role\\n\\nRecently, there have been talks of the Genesis purge in the server, and we would like to give you some more information about this. In order to retain your Genesis role, you need to participate in 33% of the threads in Alpha or Psyops. You have one month to do this so you have some time to get this done. This week, Concave also introduced the Angel role, a role which is reserved for the most dedicated miners who post regularly in Alpha or Psyops. To qualify for the Angel role, you need to engage in thoughtful discussion in 66% of the Alpha or Psyops threads within the next month. The Angel role will increase your whitelist allocations so make sure you participate in these threads before the end of the month. We are looking for miners who take time to engage in the material of these threads and offer thoughtful discussion. These threads are very interesting so please give them a read when you have the time.\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n## Gather World Preview\\n\\nWe have hinted this in the past with community events, but we want to take Gather Town to the next level. To do this, the community team is creating a Concave world on [Gather Town](https://twitter.com/gather_town?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) that will serve as our first foray into a metaverse world custom built for miners. This Gather world will allow you to journey through the actual caves of miners and explore faithful representations of areas present in the Discord server, such as the Troll Pit, the Springs, Cave stadium, and more. Our vision is to build out the Concave metaverse where miners can explore the Concave, interact with the protocol, and make friends with other miners along the way. This is an ambitious project that will take some time, but we are working quickly to build out a premiere metaverse for Concave. You can see a preview of what we are working on here.\\n\\n![](https://concave.lol/blog/content/images/2022/01/North_Town--1-.png)\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n## Team Interview with GrapeApe\\n\\n![](https://concave.lol/blog/content/images/2022/01/1_ev5jjaCgtQ0IKCx-D0rTwA.jpeg)\\n\\nA strong community needs a strong core, and the mining core has been busy at work getting Concave to be a powerhouse in the DeFi space. We wanted to drop by and have a short interview with GrapeApe, one of the core miners for Concave.\\n\\n**What is your background?**\\n\\nMBA in IT management, 5 + years as a Scrum Master, working to deliver software in the financial industry as well as government and military.\\n\\n**How did you learn about Concave?**\\n\\nI learned about Concave through my association with the guys at TNA Capital, which grew out of Typhoeus working with Jman on projects within Olympus.\\n\\n**What are your personal hobbies?**\\n\\nI’m a sports junky. I wrestled in college and picked up rugby and continue to play that to this day. I love cooking, I can make a damn good smoked brisket. I love animals, I spend time volunteering at the local humane society working with their long-term canine residents. Most of all, I love spending time with my family going on drives to local parks and getting out to explore nature and the world.\\n\\n**How do you envision Concave in the future?**\\n\\nFrom the beginning, I’ve seen Concave as a way to financial freedom for folks just stepping out of the CEXs, I think we’ve all experienced the difficulty of finding the next big project in DAOs, L2s, and Defi in general and having Concave as an option will provide folks with that rush of being in defi and a little bit of the risk that’s associated with dipping their toes into Defi, without the worry of “will this be the next rug?” Obviously there’s no guarantee of where we’ll go, but I feel like we have the right people with the right intentions to make this project very successful. I really look forward to Concave being that one stop shop for Defi investors in the future.\\n\\n**What is a goal that you would like to achieve?**\\n\\nMy major goal is to successfully bring agile methodologies to the Defi world. What that means to me is taking current methodologies and adapting them to our team’s needs and building a successful foundation for them to grow upon. I want to help these individuals achieve personal growth and empower them to not only deliver a great product through their work ethic and innovations but also help them to realize their inner potential and feel great about their accomplishment’s. My biggest success will be the success of my team, I am a servant leader, my successes and failures will be directly evidenced by the outcome of the teams I support.\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n## Concave Hermeticum\\n\\nOur hardworking community has created many amazing documents since the start of our journey, and one thing that we want to make sure of is that these documents live on through the flow of time. In order to do this, community member Templum Spiritum created the Concave Hermeticum, a collection of documents from the community that is available for everyone to see. This ensures that all of the documents of Concave exist through space and time on the blockchain. This website is still a work in progress, but you can see the collection [here](https://www.concavumhermeticum.com/).\\n\\n![](https://concave.lol/blog/content/images/2022/01/2022-01-03-13_16_38-Concavum-Hermeticum-l-NFT-Project.png)\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n## Miner of the Week\\n\\nThis week’s Miner of the Week goes to Zas, a hardworking community member who has helped a tremendous amount as a mediator and moderator for the Concave. We wanted to stop by and learn more about Zas and what he does with the Concave community.\\n\\nZas is a Russian nomad who enjoys travelling in order to better understand our world and its people. With a finance and investment background, Zas uses his solid negotiation skills to to conduct asset and project management jobs within big commercial real estate corporations.\\n\\nThroughout his life, he had been blessed to experience studying, living, and doing business in different countries from Iceland to Thailand. Other than travelling, Zas enjoys spending time with his family and friends, playing poker, learning as much as he can about cryptoverse to have a change of scenery.\\n\\nZas spends the whole time awake in Concave intermittently mostly on mobile, so around 16 hours to catch up on updates. He is everywhere from checking Mediation tickets to staying on tracks of Echo updates.Zas also helps the community in Documentation and russia-op, from helping with general moderation and roles to being present in helpful in many other channels to spread wagmi vibes. Being in an unusual UTC+4 zone helps to spread the Mod load and have everything covered. Most of the Mediation work goes away from other eyes privately and touches sensitive topics so things could escalate quickly. Staying neutral and doing his best to achieve a healthy de-escalation when possible is his purpose so Mediators do not take things personally.\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\nThe Community Contribution section is a place where we celebrate some of the amazing work of our mining community. Here are some of the brilliant projects that our community has created this past week.\\n\\n### Memes\\n\\nWe have some amazing meme creators in our community, and they have been putting in their passion and creativity to create memes that miners can enjoy. One meme that impressed us was this image of Darth Vader holding his hand out for a spoon.\\\\*\\\\* Ior2021\\\\*\\\\* created this meme that certainly gave us a chuckle, and we wanted to highlight their contribution here.\\n\\n![](https://concave.lol/blog/content/images/2022/01/1_80Q_RQwKGSKVouBHSsOkMw.jpeg)\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Alpha or Psyops**\\n\\nFor this week’s newsletter, we wanted to highlight some thoughtful responses in the Alpha or Psyops threads. In the thread “Is hodling, adoption?” **Defi Rat** gives a well thought out response in regard to money velocity and predictions on the economy moving forward.\\n\\n> Once the human culture develops, everything becomes more specialized, that is also the case with financial assets. Since the Bretton Woods abandonment in the 70s, the money (USD) and store of value (Gold) has been separated. I believe this will stay the case for the time being, as central banks will want to ‘stimulate’ the economy by issuing more money into the system, by debasing the currency and raising debt. So to put it simple: money is for paying, store of value is for holding. Bitcoin is getting adoption as a store of value, but is not getting adoption as money. Interestingly enough, Ethereum is getting adoption from both sides… Moreover, store of value is a social construct. Something has a value because people believe it does. The more wealth is getting poured into an asset, the more adoption it gets as a store of value. Essentially, people buying bitcoin are ‘voting’ with their dollars and showing that they believe it has a value. The price action of bitcoin is a pure chart representing its adoption.\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n**That’s all for this week miners — we hope you enjoyed this week’s issue of the Concave Lens and look forward to bringing you the next one.**\\n\\n**WAGMI**\\n\\nMake sure to follow us on our socials!\\n\\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ConcaveFi) | [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Concavefi/) | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWbz_2ZUQoehm4llGbk9CtA) | [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/concavefi)\",\"timestamp\":1641468919,\"title\":\"The Echo-Concave Weekly Newsletter\"},\"digest\":\"B2m0zbYlXCiouDjkZ7aDC9ByVOKl_quIcCNyMhXfRIA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2C949fE13E8381E1b93CFA54f6C1F138FfBe8a36\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MmYCzyRd0noNMC2va1ELsFpCR0KRlnLmTqNd3u8HeXo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"H-3Xq6e5Wv0lJY_x3fc3MjCj8P_SBsIUJBd27J1swZQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Wz_K-aCWAqeuFSLnX9LbjpK8WOMgMKEvijyj6SL5KE-quoMfVOsR4ktgfN1P4CbmOvwCZnTJHaDQIs6hV1TZWw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x54c9bf9afe6c99c8e3a03d460f26fe78d0c27a33c8a72b3882838eec1d15f2153ec6a038e41845c6453284f671e43c8c06a279782d2df4b3fc3fb898215879dc1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MmYCzyRd0noNMC2va1ELsFpCR0KRlnLmTqNd3u8HeXo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"H-3Xq6e5Wv0lJY_x3fc3MjCj8P_SBsIUJBd27J1swZQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"W3U1p8QAGhdodU4QdrSJjnRD__mZRv8Pb-7sVA5zr0E\"}"
