"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"I was with Ruffo this evening. We talked, and he told me that he met you at the Festa last night. He told me, too, that he was with his mother.\\\"\\n\\nShe waited to give him a chance of speaking, of forestalling any question. But he only stared at her with dilated eyes.\\n\\n\\\"He told me that you knew his mother, and that his mother knew you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why not?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course, there is no reason. What surprised me rather\\\"--she was speaking more slowly now, and more unevenly--\\\"was this--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si?\\\"\\n\\nGaspare's voice was loud. He lifted up his hands and laid them heavily on his knees.\\n\\n\\\"Si?\\\" he repeated.\\n\\n\\\"After you had spoken with her, she cried, Ruffo's mother cried, Gaspare. And she said, 'To think of its being Gaspare on the island!'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is that all?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.\\\"\\n\\nA look that was surely a look of fear came into his face, rendering it new to Hermione. Never before had she seen such an expression--or had she once--long ago--one night in Sicily?\\n\\n\\\"That isn't all. Ruffo took his mother home, and when they got home she said to him this, 'Has Gaspare ever said you were like somebody?' \\\"\\n\\nGaspare said nothing.\\n\\n\\\"Did you hear, Gaspare?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signora.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Gaspare, it seems to me\\\"--Hermione was speaking now very slowly, like one shaping a thought in her mind while she spoke--\\\"it seems to me strange that you and Ruffo's mother should have known each other so well long before Ruffo was born, and that she should cry because she met you at the Festa, and that--afterwards--she should ask Ruffo that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Strange?\\\"\\n\\nThe fear that had been formless was increasing now in Hermione, and surely it was beginning at last to take a form, but as yet only a form that was vague and shadowy.\\n\\n\\\"Yes. I think it very strange. Did you\\\"--an intense curiosity was alive in her now--\\\"did you know Ruffo's mother in Sicily?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Signora, it does not matter where I knew her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why should she say that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Has Gaspare ever said you were like somebody?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have never said Ruffo was like anybody!\\\" Gaspare exclaimed, with sudden and intense violence. \\\"May the Madonna let me die--may I die\\\"-- he held up his arms--\\\"may I die to-morrow if I have ever said Ruffo was like anybody!\\\"\\n\\nHe got up from his chair. His face was red in patches, like the face of a man stricken with fever.\\n\\n\\\"Gaspare, I know that, but what could this woman have meant?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Madonna! How should I know? Signora, how can I tell what a woman like that means? Such women have no sense, they talk, they gossip--ah, ah, ah, ah!\\\"--he imitated the voice of a woman of the people--\\\"they are always on the door-step, their tongues are always going. Dio mio! Who is to say what they mean, or what nonsense goes through their heads?\\\"\\n\\nHermione got up and laid her hand heavily on his arm.\\n\\n\\\"I believe you know of whom Ruffo's mother spoke, Gaspare. Tell me this--did Ruffo's mother ever know your Padrone?\\\"\\n\\nShe looked straight into his eyes. It seemed to her as if, for the first time, there came from them to her a look that had something in it of dislike. This look struck her to a terrible melancholy, yet she met it firmly, almost fiercely, with a glance that fought it, that strove to beat it back. And with a steady voice she repeated the question he had not answered.\\n\\n\\\"Did Ruffo's mother ever know your Padrone?\\\"\\n\\nGaspare moved his lips, passing his tongue over them. His eyes fell. He moved his arm, trying to shift it from his Padrona's hand. Her fingers closed on it more tenaciously.\\n\\n\\\"Gaspare, I order you to tell me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Signora,\\\" he said, \\\"such things are not in my service. I am here to work, not to answer questions.\\\"\\n\\nHe spoke quietly now, heavily, and moved his feet on the carpet.\\n\\n\\\"You disobey me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Signora, I shall always obey all your orders as a servant.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And as a friend, Gaspare, as a friend! You are my friend, aren't you?\\\"\\n\\nHer voice had suddenly changed, and in answer to it his face changed. He looked into her face, and his eyes were full of a lustrous softness that was like a gentle and warm caress.\\n\\n\\\"Signora, you know what I am for you. Then leave me alone, Signora.\\\" He spoke solemnly. \\\"You ought to trust me, Signora, you ought to trust me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do trust you. But you--do you trust me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signora.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In everything?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Signora, I trust you; I have always trusted you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And my courage--do you trust that?\\\"\\n\\nHe did not answer.\\n\\n\\\"I don't think you do, Gaspare.\\\"\\n\\nSuddenly she felt that he was right not to trust it. Again she felt beset by fear, and as if she had nothing within her that was strong enough to stand up in further combat against the assaults of the world and of destiny. The desire to know all, to probe this mystery, abruptly left her, was replaced by an almost frantic wish to be always ignorant, if only that ignorance saved her from any fresh sorrow or terror.\\n\\n\\\"Never mind,\\\" she said. \\\"You needn't answer. I don't want-- What does it all matter? It's--it's all so long ago.\\\"\\n\\nHaving got hold of that phrase, she clung to it as if for comfort.\\n\\n\\\"It's all so long ago,\\\" she repeated. \\\"Years and years ago. We've forgotten it. We've forgotten Sicily, Gaspare. Why should we think of it or trouble about it any more? Good-night, Gaspare.\\\"\\n\\nShe smiled at him, but her face was drawn and looked old.\\n\\n\\\"Buona notte, Signora.\\\"\\n\\nHe did not smile, but gazed at her with earnest gentleness, and still with that lustrous look in his eyes, full of tenderness and protection.\\n\\n\\\"Buon riposo, Signora.\\\"\\n\\nHe went away, surely relieved to go. At the door he said again:\\n\\n\\\"Buon riposo.\\\"\\n\\nThe door was shut.\\n\\n\\\"Buon riposo!\\\"\\n\\nHermione repeated the words to herself.\\n\\n\\\"Riposo!\\\"\\n\\nThe very thought of repose was like the most bitter irony. She walked up and down the room. To-night there was no stability in her. She was shaken, lacerated mentally, by sharply changing moods that rushed through her, one chasing another. Scarcely had Gaspare gone before she longed to call him back, to force him to speak, to explain everything to her. The fear that cringed was suddenly replaced by the fear that rushes forward blindly, intent only on getting rid of uncertainty even at the cost of death. Soldiers know that fear. It has given men to bayonet points.\\n\\nNow it increased rapidly within Hermione. She was devoured by a terror that was acutely nervous, that gnawed her body as well as her soul.\\n\\nGaspare had known Ruffo's mother in Sicily. And Maurice--he had known Ruffo's mother. He must have known her. But when? How had he got to know her?\\n\\nHermione stood still.\\n\\n\\\"It must have been when I was in Africa!\\\"\\n\\nA hundred details of her husband's conduct, from the moment of his return from the fair till the last kiss he had given her before he went away down the side of Monte Amato, flashed through her mind. And each one seemed to burn her mind as a spark, touching flesh, burns the flesh.\\n\\n\\\"It was when I was in Africa!\\\"\\n\\nShe went to the window and leaned out into the night over the misty sea. Her lips moved. She was repeating to herself again and again:\\n\\n\\\"To-morrow I'll go to Mergellina! To-morrow I'll go to Mergellina!\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXV\\n\\nHermione did not sleep at all that night. When the dawn came she got up and looked out over the sea. The mist had vanished with the darkness. The vaporous heat was replaced by a delicate freshness that embraced the South as dew embraces a rose. On the as yet pale waters, full of varying shades of gray, slate color, ethereal mauve, very faint pink and white, were dotted many fishing-boats. Hermione looked at them with her tired eyes. Ruffo's boat was no doubt among them. There was one only a few hundred yards beyond the rocks from which Vere sometimes bathed. Perhaps that was his.\\n\\nRuffo's boat! Ruffo!\\n\\nShe put her elbows on the sill of the window and rested her face in her hands.\\n\\nHer eyes felt very dry, like sand she thought, and her mind felt dry too, as if insomnia was withering it up. She opened her lips to breathe in the salt freshness of the morning.\\n\\nUpon Anacapri a woolly white cloud lay lightly. The distant coast, where dreams Sorrento, was becoming clearer every moment.\\n\\nOften and often in the summer-time had Hermione been invaded by the radiant cheerfulness of the Bay of Naples. She knew no sea that had its special gift of magical gayety and stirring hopefulness, its laughing Pagan appeal to all the light things of the soul. It woke even the weary heart to holiday when, in the summer, it glittered and danced in the sun, whispering or calling with a tender or bold vivacity along its lovely coast.\\n\\nOut of this morning beauty, refined and exquisitely gentle, would rise presently that livelier Pagan spirit. It was not hers. She was no Pagan. But she had loved it, and she had, or thought she had, been able to understand it.\\n\\nAll that was long ago.\\n\\nNow, as she leaned out, her soul felt old and haggard, and the contact with the youth and freshness of the morning emphasized its inability to be influenced any more by youthful wonders, by the graciousness and inspiration that are the gifts of dawn.\\n\\nWas that Ruffo's boat?\\n\\nHer mind was dwelling on Ruffo, but mechanically, heavily, like a thing with feet of lead, unable to lift itself once it had dropped down upon a surface.\\n\\nAll the night her brain had been busy. Now it did not slumber, but it brooded, like the mist that had so lately left the sea. It brooded upon the thought of Ruffo.\\n\\nThe light grew. Over the mountains the sky spread scarlet banners. The sea took, with a quiet readiness that was happily submissive, its burnished gift of gold. The gray was lost in gold.\\n\\nAnd Hermione watched, and drank in the delicate air, but caught nothing of the delicate spirit of the dawn.\\n\\nPresently the boat that lay not far beyond the rocks moved. A little black figure stood up in it, swayed to and fro, plying tiny oars. The boat diminished. It was leaving the fishing-ground. It was going towards Mergellina.\\n\\n\\\"To-day I am going to Mergellina.\\\"\\n\\nHermione said that to herself as she watched the boat till it disappeared in the shining gold that was making a rapture of the sea. She said it, but the words seemed to have little meaning, the fact which they conveyed to be unimportant to her.\\n\\nAnd she leaned out of the window, with a weary and inexpressive face, while the gold spread ever more widely over the sea, and the Pagan spirit surely stirred from its brief repose to greet the brilliant day.\\n\\nPresently she became aware of a boat approaching the island from the direction of Mergellina. She saw it first when it was a long distance off, and watched it idly as it drew near. It looked black against the gold, till it was off the Villa Pantano. But then, or soon after, she saw that it was white. It was making straight for the island, propelled by vigorous arms.\\n\\nNow she thought it looked like one of the island boats. Could Vere have got up and gone out so early with Gaspare?\\n\\nShe drew back, lifted her face from her hands, and stood straight up against the curtain of the window. In a moment she heard the sound of oars in the water, and saw that the boat was from the island, and that Gaspare was in it alone. He looked up, saw her, and raised his cap, but with a rather reluctant gesture that scarcely indicated satisfaction or a happy readiness to greet her. She hesitated, then called out to him.\\n\\n\\\"Good-morning, Gaspare.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good-morning, Signora.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How early you are up!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you, too, Signora.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Couldn't you sleep?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Signora, I never want much sleep.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where have you been?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have been for a row, Signora.\\\"\\n\\nHe lifted his cap again and began to row in. The boat disappeared into the Saint's Pool.\\n\\n\\\"He has been to Mergellina.\\\"\\n\\nThe mind of Hermione was awake again. The sight of Gaspare had lifted those feet of lead. Once more she was in flight.\\n\\nArabs can often read the thoughts of those whom they know. In many Sicilians there is some Arab blood, and sometimes Hermione had felt that Gaspare knew well intentions of hers which she had never hinted to him. Now she was sure that in the night he had divined her determination to go to Mergellina, to see the mother of Ruffo, to ask her for the truth which Gaspare had refused to tell. He had divined this, and he had gone to Mergellina before her. Why?\\n\\nShe was fully roused now. She felt like one in a conflict. Was there, then, to be a battle between herself and Gaspare, a battle over this hidden truth?\\n\\nNow she felt that it was vital to her to know this truth. Yet when her mind, or her tormented heart, was surely on the verge of its statement, was--or seemed to be--about to say to her, \\\"Perhaps it is-- that!\\\" or \\\"It is--that!\\\" something within her, housed deep down in her, refused to listen, refused to hear, revolted from--what it did not acknowledge the existence of.\\n\\nParadox alone could hint the condition of her mind just then. She was in the thrall of fear, but, had she been questioned, would not have allowed that she was afraid.\\n\\nAfterwards she never rightly knew what was the truth of her during this period of her life.\\n\\nThere was to be a conflict between her and Gaspare.\\n\\nShe came from the window, took a bath, and dressed. When she had finished she looked in the glass. Her face was calm, but set and grim. She had not known she could look like that. She hated her face, her expression, and she came away from the glass feeling almost afraid of herself.\\n\\nAt breakfast she and Vere always met. The table was laid out-of-doors in the little garden or on the terrace if the weather was fine, in the dining-room if it was bad. This morning Hermione saw the glimmer of the white cloth near the fig-tree. She wondered if Vere was there, and longed to plead a headache and to have her coffee in her bedroom. Nevertheless, she went down resolved to govern herself.\\n\\nIn the garden she found Giulia smiling and putting down the silver coffee-pot in quite a bower of roses. Vere was not visible.\\n\\nHermione exchanged a good-morning with Giulia and sat down. The servant's smiling face brought her a mingled feeling of relief and wonder. The pungent smell of coffee, conquering the soft scent of the many roses, pinned her mind abruptly down to the simple realities and animal pleasures and necessities of life. She made a strong effort to be quite normal, to think of the moment, to live for it. The morning was fresh and lively; the warmth of the sun, the tonic vivacity of the air from the sea, caressed and quickened her blood.\\n\\nThe minute garden was secluded. A world that seemed at peace, a world of rocks and waters far from the roar of traffic, the uneasy hum of men, lay around her.\\n\\nSurely the moment was sweet, was peaceful. She would live in it.\\n\\nVere came slowly from the house, and at once Hermione's newly made and not yet carried out resolution crumbled into dust. She forgot the sun, the sea, the peaceful situation and all material things. She was confronted by the painful drama of the island life! Vere with her secrets, Emile with his, Gaspare fighting to keep her, his Padrona, still in mystery. And she was confronted by her own passions, those hosts of armed men that have their dwelling in every powerful nature.\\n\\nVere came up listlessly.\\n\\n\\\"Good-morning, Madre,\\\" she said.\\n\\nShe kissed her mother's cheek with cold lips.\\n\\n\\\"What lovely roses!\\\"\\n\\nShe smelled them and sat down in her place facing the sea-wall.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, aren't they?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And such a heavenly morning after the mist! What are we going to do to-day?\\\"\\n\\nHermione gave her her coffee, and the little dry tap of a spoon on an egg-shell was heard in the stillness of the garden.\\n\\n\\\"Well, I--I am going across to take the tram.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Naples again? I'm tired of Naples.\\\"\\n\\nThere was in her voice a sound that suggested rather hatred than lassitude.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know that I shall go as far as Naples. I am going to Mergellina.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\"\\n\\nVere did not ask her what she was going to do there. She showed no special interest, no curiosity.\\n\\n\\\"What will you do, Vere?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know.\\\"\\n\\nShe glanced round. Hermione saw that her usually bright eyes were dull and lack-lustre.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know what I shall do.\\\"\\n\\nShe sighed and began to eat her egg slowly, as if she had no appetite.\\n\\n\\\"Did you sleep well, Vere?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not very well, Madre.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are you tired of the island?\\\"\\n\\nVere looked up as if startled.\\n\\n\\\"Oh no! at least\\\"--she paused--\\\"No, I don't believe I could ever be really that. I love the island.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What is it, then?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sometimes--some days one doesn't know exactly what to do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, but you always seem occupied.\\\" Hermione spoke with slow meaning, not unkindly, but with a significance she hardly meant to put into her voice, yet could not keep out of it. \\\"You always manage to find something to do.\\\"\\n\\nSuddenly Vere's eyes filled with tears. She bent down her head and went on eating. Again she heard Monsieur Emile's harsh words. They seemed to have changed her world. She felt despised. At that moment she hated the Marchesino with a fiery hatred.\\n\\nHermione was not able to put her arm round her child quickly, to ask her what was the matter, to kiss her tears away, or to bid them flow quietly, openly, while Vere rested against her, secure that the sorrow was understood, was shared. She could only pretend not to see, while she thought of the two shadows in the garden last night.\\n\\nWhat could have happened between Emile and Vere? What had been said, done, to cause that cry of pain, those tears? Was it possible that Emile had let Vere see plainly his--his--? But here Hermione stopped. Not even in her own mind, for herself alone, could she summon up certain spectres.\\n\\nShe went on eating her breakfast, and pretending not to notice that Vere was troubled. Presently Vere spoke again.\\n\\n\\\"Would you like me to come with you to Mergellina, Madre?\\\" she said.\\n\\nHer voice was rather uneven, almost trembling.\\n\\n\\\"Oh no, Vere!\\\"\\n\\nHermione spoke hastily, abruptly, strongly conscious of the impossibility of taking Vere with her. Directly she had said the words she realized that they must have fallen on Vere like a blow. She realized this still more when she looked quickly up and saw that Vere's face was scarlet.\\n\\n\\\"I don't mean that I shouldn't like to have you with me, Vere,\\\" she added, hurriedly. \\\"But--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's all right, Madre. Well, I've finished. I think I shall go out a little in my boat.\\\"\\n\\nShe went away, half humming, half singing the tune of the Mergellina song.\\n\\nHermione put down her cup. She had not finished her coffee, but she knew she could not finish it. Life seemed at that moment utterly intolerable to her. She felt desperate, as a nature does that is forced back upon itself by circumstances, that is forced to be, or to appear to be, traitor to itself. And in her desperation action presented itself to her as imperatively necessary--necessary as air is to one suffocating.\\n\\nShe got up. She would start at once for Mergellina. As she went up- stairs she remembered that she did not know where Ruffo's mother lived, what she was like, even what her name was. The boy had always spoken of her as \\\"Mia Mamma.\\\" They dwelt at Mergellina. That was all she knew.\\n\\nShe did not choose to ask Gaspare anything. She would go alone, and find out somehow for herself where Ruffo lived. She would ask the fishermen. Or perhaps she would come across Ruffo. Probably he had gone home by this time from the fishing.\\n\\nQuickly, energetically she got ready.\\n\\nJust before she left her room she saw Vere pass slowly by upon the sea, rowing a little way out alone, as she often did in the calm summer weather. Vere had a book, and almost directly she laid the oars in their places side by side, went into the stern, sat down under the awning, and began--apparently--to read. Hermione watched her for two or three minutes. She looked very lonely; and moved by an impulse to try to erase the impression made on her by the abrupt exclamation at the breakfast-table, the mother leaned out and hailed the child.\\n\\n\\\"Good-bye, Vere! I am just starting!\\\" she cried out, trying to make her voice sound cheerful and ordinary.\\n\\nVere looked up for a second.\\n\\n\\\"Good-bye!\\\"\\n\\nShe bent her head and returned to her book.\\n\\nHermione felt chilled.\\n\\nShe went down and met Giulia in the passage.\\n\\n\\\"Giulia, is Gaspare anywhere about? I want to cross to the mainland. I am going to take the tram.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Signora, are you going to Naples? Maria says--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can't do any commissions, because I shall probably not go beyond Mergellina. Find Gaspare, will you?\\\"\\n\\nGiulia went away and Hermione descended to the Saint's Pool. She waited there two or three minutes. Then Gaspare appeared above.\\n\\n\\\"You want the boat, Signora?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Gaspare.\\\"\\n\\nHe leaped down the steps and stood beside her.\\n\\n\\\"Where do you want to go?\\\"\\n\\nShe hesitated. Then she looked him straight in the face and said:\\n\\n\\\"To Mergellina.\\\"\\n\\nHe met her eyes without flinching. His face was quite calm.\\n\\n\\\"Shall I row you there, Signora?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I meant to go to the village, and walk up and take the tram.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As you like, Signora. But I can easily row you there.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Aren't you tired after being out so early this morning?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, Signora.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did you go far?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not so very far, Signora.\\\"\\n\\nHermione hesitated. She knew Gaspare had been to Mergellina. She knew he had been to see Ruffo's mother. If that were so her journey would probably be in vain. In their conflict Gaspare had struck the first blow. Could anything be gained by her going?\\n\\nGaspare saw, and perhaps read accurately, her hesitation.\\n\\n\\\"It will get very hot to-day, Signora,\\\" he said, carelessly.\\n\\nHis words decided Hermione. If obstacles were to be put in her way she would overleap them. At all costs she would emerge from the darkness in which she was walking. A heat of anger rushed over her. She felt as if Gaspare, and perhaps Artois, were treating her like a child.\\n\\n\\\"I must go to Mergellina, Gaspare,\\\" she said. \\\"And I shall go by tram. Please row me to the village.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Va bene, Signora,\\\" he answered.\\n\\nHe went to pull in the boat.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVI\\n\\nWhen Hermione got out of the boat in the little harbor of the village on the mainland Gaspare said again:\\n\\n\\\"I could easily row you to Mergellina, Signore. I am not a bit tired.\\\"\\n\\nShe looked at him as he stood with his hand on the prow of the boat. His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, showing his strong arms. There was something brave, something \\\"safe\\\"--so she called it to herself--in his whole appearance which had always appealed to her nature. How she longed at that moment to be quite at ease with him! Why would he not trust her completely? Perhaps in her glance just then she showed her thought, her desire. Gaspare's eyes fell before her.\\n\\n\\\"I think I'll take the tram,\\\" she said, \\\"unless--\\\"\\n\\nShe was still looking at him, longing for him to speak. But he said nothing. At that moment a fisherman ran down the steps from the village, and came over the sand to greet them.\\n\\n\\\"Good-bye, Gaspare,\\\" she said. \\\"Don't wait, of course. Giovanni can row me back.\\\"\\n\\nThe fisherman smiled, but Gaspare said:\\n\\n\\\"I can come for you, Signora. You will not be very long, will you? You will be back for colazione?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh yes, I suppose so.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will come for you, Signora.\\\"\\n\\nAgain she looked at him, and felt his deep loyalty to her, his strong and almost doglike affection. And, feeling them, she was seized once more by fear. The thing Gaspare hid from her must be something terrible.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you, Gaspare.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A rivederci, Signora.\\\"\\n\\nWas there not a sound of pleading in his voice, a longing to retain her? She would not heed it. But she gave him a very gentle look as she turned to walk up the hill.\\n\\nAt the top, by the Trattoria del Giardinetto, she had to wait for several minutes before the tram came. She remembered her solitary dinner there on the evening when she had gone to the Scoglio di Frisio to look at the visitor's book. She had felt lonely then in the soft light of the fading day. She felt far more lonely now in the brilliant sunshine of morning. And for an instant she saw herself travelling steadily along a straight road, from which she could not diverge. She passed milestone after milestone. And now, not far off, she saw in the distance a great darkness in which the road ended. And the darkness was the ultimate loneliness which can encompass on earth the human spirit.\\n\\nThe tram-bell sounded. She lifted her head mechanically. A moment later she was rushing down towards Naples. Before the tram reached the harbor of Mergellina, on the hill opposite the Donn' Anna, Hermione got out. Something in her desired delay; there was plenty of time. She would walk a little way among the lively people who were streaming to the Stabilimenti to have their morning dip.\\n\\nIn the tram she had scarcely thought at all. She had given herself to the air, to speed, to vision. Now, at once, with physical action came an anxiety, a restlessness, that seemed to her very physical too. Her body felt ill, she thought; though she knew there was nothing the matter with her. All through her life her health had been robust. Never yet had she completely \\\"broken down.\\\" She told herself that her body was perfectly well.\\n\\nBut she was afraid. That was the truth. And to feel fear was specially hateful to her, because she abhorred cowardice, and was inclined to despise all timidity as springing from weakness of character.\\n\\nShe dreaded reaching Mergellina. She dreaded seeing this woman, Ruffo's mother. And Ruffo? Did she dread seeing him?\\n\\nShe fought against her fear. Whatever might befall her she would remain herself, essentially separate from all other beings and from events, secure of the tremendous solitude that is the property of every human being on earth.\\n\\n\\\"Pain, misery, horror, come from within, not from without.\\\" She said that to herself steadily. \\\"I am free so long as I choose, so long as I have the courage to choose, to be free.\\\"\\n\\nAnd saying that, and never once allowing her mind to state frankly any fear, she came down to the harbor of Mergellina.\\n\\nThe harbor and its environs looked immensely gay in the brilliant sunshine. Life was at play here, even at its busiest. The very workers sang as if their work were play. Boats went in and out on the water. Children paddled in the shallow sea, pushing hand-nets along the sand. From the rocks boys were bathing. Their shouts travelled to the road where the fishermen were talking with intensity, as they leaned against the wall hot with the splendid sun.\\n\\nHermione looked for Ruffo's face among all these sun-browned faces, for his bright eyes among all the sparkling eyes of these children of the sea.\\n\\nBut she could not see him. She walked along the wall slowly.\\n\\n\\\"Ruffo--Ruffo--Ruffo!\\\"\\n\\nShe was summoning him with her mind.\\n\\nPerhaps he was among those bathing boys. She looked across the harbor to the rocks, and saw the brown body of one shoot through the shining air and disappear with a splash into the sea.\\n\\nPerhaps that boy was he--how far away from her loneliness, her sadness, and her dread!\\n\\nShe began to despair of finding him.\\n\\n\\\"Barca! Barca!\\\"\\n\\nShe had reached the steps now near the Savoy Hotel. A happy-looking boatman, with hazel eyes and a sensitive mouth, hailed her from the water. It was Fabiano Lari, to whom Artois had once spoken, waiting for custom in his boat the /Stella del Mare/.\\n\\nHermione was attracted to the man, as Artois had been, and she resolved to find out from him, if possible, where Ruffo's mother lived. She went down the steps. The man immediately brought his boat right in.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" she said, \\\"I don't want the boat.\\\"\\n\\nFabiano looked a little disappointed.\\n\\n\\\"I am looking for some one who lives here, a Sicilian boy called Ruffo.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ruffo Scarla, Signora? The Sicilian?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That must be he. Do you know him?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signora, I know Ruffo very well. He was here this morning. But I don't know where he is now.\\\" He looked round. \\\"He may have gone home, Signora.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you know where he lives?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signora. It is near where I live. It's near the Grotto.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Could you possibly leave your boat and take me there?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signora! A moment, Signora.\\\"\\n\\nQuickly he signed to a boy who was standing close by watching them. The boy ran down to the boat. Fabiano spoke to him in dialect. He got into the boat, while Fabiano jumped ashore.\\n\\n\\\"Signora, I am ready. We go this way.\\\"\\n\\nThey walked along together.\\n\\nFabiano was as frank and simple as a child, and began at once to talk. Hermione was glad of that, still more glad that he talked of himself, his family, the life and affairs of a boatman. She listened sympathetically, occasionally putting in a word, till suddenly Fabiano said:\\n\\n\\\"Antonio Bernari will be out to-day. I suppose you know that, Signora?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Antonio Bernari! Who is he? I never heard of him.\\\"\\n\\nFabiano looked surprised.\\n\\n\\\"But he is Ruffo's Patrigno. He is the husband of Maddalena.\\\"\\n\\nHermione stood still on the pavement. She did not know why for a moment. Her mind seemed to need a motionless body in which to work. It was surely groping after something, eagerly, feverishly, yet blindly.\\n\\nFabiano paused beside her.\\n\\n\\\"Signora,\\\" he said, staring at her in surprise, \\\"are you tired? Are you not well?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm quite well. But wait a minute. Yes, I do want to rest for a minute.\\\"\\n\\nShe dared not move lest she should interfere with that mental search. Fabiano's words had sent her mind sharply to Sicily.\\n\\nMaddalena!\\n\\nShe was sure she had known, or heard of, some girl in Sicily called Maddalena, some girl or some woman. She thought of the servants in the Casa del Prete, Lucrezia. Had she any sister, any relation called Maddalena? Or had Gaspare--?\\n\\nSuddenly Hermione seemed to be on the little terrace above the ravine with Maurice and Artois. She seemed to feel the heat of noon in summer. Gaspare was there, too. She saw his sullen face. She saw him looking ugly. She heard him say:\\n\\n\\\"Salvatore and Maddalena, Signora.\\\"\\n\\nWhy had he said that? In answer to what question?\\n\\nAnd then, in a flash, she remembered everything. It was she who had spoken first. She had asked him who lived in the House of the Sirens.\\n\\n\\\"Salvatore and Maddalena.\\\"\\n\\nAnd afterwards--Maurice had said something. Her mind went in search, seized its prey.\\n\\n\\\"They're quite friends of ours. We saw them at the fair only yesterday.\\\"\\n\\nMaurice had said that. She could hear his voice saying it.\\n\\n\\\"I'm rested now.\\\"\\n\\nShe was speaking to Fabiano. They were walking on again among the chattering people. They had come to the wooden station where the tram- lines converge.\\n\\n\\\"Is it this way?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signora, quite near the Grotto. Take care, Signora.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's all right. Thank you.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1637315477,\"title\":\"\\nHe kept his eyes on her, staring with a tremendous directness that was essentially southern. \"},\"digest\":\"cxrTdzHAMXe3a7PItZCP7HqkU0JtnhwlB-NmAUwnJmc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x98485E752AD42d721892AE055281b72F1cA81833\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"y_Ljyr7voM-nzvJvlAa9Okq8pxIh9OViDsiPjm4hLZs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TB5ve3o-ubmaFCI36loH0ycd-exYYbEOeT7YO1mD8rQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"66qYbHZ5TBH_SpNR-xZI-xVMrq4Vqmoe41svyrG5JeKl8Ta3LeQZAlJ8gAHev3ZK01xDcEELOj0mUV9fuv1zEw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x031ea1203bc4897a49b5a15b02f7a735786acf32a1eed49a398862e38d03a4222b2bfd5e3f1b4336e61877af48c90e855f10b113167363e4f29a5dbd7f72fd6a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"y_Ljyr7voM-nzvJvlAa9Okq8pxIh9OViDsiPjm4hLZs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TB5ve3o-ubmaFCI36loH0ycd-exYYbEOeT7YO1mD8rQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"cxrTdzHAMXe3a7PItZCP7HqkU0JtnhwlB-NmAUwnJmc\"}"
