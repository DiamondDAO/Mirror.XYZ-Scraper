"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"And have you been eight months searching Europe for this madman?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. At first pride and anger were strong, and I said, 'Here I stay till he comes back to me and to his senses.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Brava!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes; but month after month went by, carrying away my pride and my anger, and leaving my affection undiminished. At last I could bear it no longer; so, as he would not come to his senses--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You took leave of yours, and came out on a wild-goose chase,\\\" said Ashmead, but too regretfully to affront her.\\n\\n\\\"It *was,\\\"* said Ina; \\\"I feel it. But it is not one *now,* because I have *you* to assist me with your experience and ability. You will find him for me, somehow or other. I know you will.\\\"\\n\\nLet a woman have ever so little guile, she must have tact, if she is a true woman. Now, tact, if its etymology is to be trusted, implies a fine sense and power of touch; so, in virtue of her sex, she pats a horse before she rides him, and a man before she drives him. There, ladies, there is an indictment in two counts; traverse either of them if you can.\\n\\nJoseph Ashmead, thus delicately but effectually manipulated, swelled with gratified vanity and said, \\\"You are quite right; you can't do this sort of thing yourself; you want an agent.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course I do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, you have got one. Now let me see--fifty to one he is not at Homburg at all. If he is, he most likely stays at Frankfort. He is a swell, is he not?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Swell!\\\" said the Anglo-Dane, puzzled. \\\"Not that I am aware of.\\\" She was strictly on her guard against vituperation of her beloved scamp.\\n\\n\\\"Pooh, pooh!\\\" said Ashmead; \\\"of course he is, and not the sort to lodge in Homburg.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then behold my incompetence!\\\" said Ina.\\n\\n\\\"But *the* place to look for him is the gambling-saloon. Been there?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then you must.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What! Me! Alone?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No; with your agent.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, my friend; I said you would find him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What a woman! She will have it he is in Homburg. And suppose we do find him, and you should not be welcome?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I shall not be unwelcome. *I shall be a change.\\\"*\\n\\n\\\"Shall I tell you how to draw him to Homburg, wherever he is?\\\" said Ashmead, very demurely.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, tell me that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And do *me* a good turn into the bargain.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is it possible? Can I be so fortunate?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes; and *as you say,* it *is* a slice of luck to be able to kill two birds with one stone. Why, consider--the way to recover a man is not to run after him, but to make him run to you. It is like catching moths; you don't run out into the garden after them; you light the candle and open the window, and *they* do the rest--as he will.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, yes; but what am I to do for *you?\\\"* asked Ina, getting a little uneasy and suspicious.\\n\\n\\\"What! didn't I tell you?\\\" said Ashmead, with cool effrontery. \\\"Why, only to sing for me in this little opera, that is all.\\\" And he put his hands in his pockets, and awaited thunder-claps.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, that is all, is it?\\\" said Ina, panting a little, and turning two great, reproachful eyes on him.\\n\\n\\\"That is all,\\\" said he, stoutly. \\\"Why, what attracted him at first? Wasn't it your singing, the admiration of the public, the bouquets and bravas? What caught the moth once will catch it again 'moping' won't. And surely you will not refuse to draw him, merely because you can pull me out of a fix into the bargain. Look here, I have undertaken to find a singer by to-morrow night; and what chance is there of my getting even a third-rate one? Why, the very hour I have spent so agreeably, talking to you, has diminished my chance.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\" said Ina, \\\"this is *driving* me into your net.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I own it,\\\" said Joseph, cheerfully; \\\"I'm quite unscrupulous, because I know you will thank me afterward.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The very idea of going back to the stage makes me tremble,\\\" said Ina.\\n\\n\\\"Of course it does; and those who tremble succeed. In a long experience I never knew an instance to the contrary. It is the conceited fools, who feel safe, that are in danger.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What is the part?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"One you know--Siebel in 'Faust,' with two new songs.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Excuse me, I do not know it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, everybody knows it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You mean everybody has heard it sung. I know neither the music nor the words, and I cannot sing incorrectly even for you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, you can master the airs in a day, and the cackle in half an hour.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am not so expeditious. If you are serious, get me the book--oh! he calls the poet's words the cackle--and the music of the part directly, and borrow me the score.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Borrow you the score! Ah! that shows the school you were bred in. I gaze at you with admiration.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then please don't, for we have not a moment to waste. You have terrified me out of my senses. Fly!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes; but before I fly, there is something to be settled--salary!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As much as they will give.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course; but give me a hint.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, no; you will get me some money, for I am poor. I gave all my savings to my dear mother, and settled her on a farm in dear old Denmark. But I really sing for *you* more than for Homburg, so make no difficulties. Above all, do not discuss salary with me. Settle it and draw it for me, and let me hear no more about that. I am on thorns.\\\"\\n\\nHe soon found the director, and told him, excitedly, there was a way out of his present difficulty. Ina Klosking was in the town. He had implored her to return to the opera. She had refused at first; but he had used all his influence with her, and at last had obtained a half promise on conditions--a two months' engagement; certain parts, which he specified out of his own head; salary, a hundred thalers per night, and a half clear benefit on her last appearance.\\n\\nThe director demurred to the salary.\\n\\nAshmead said he was mad: she was the German Alboni; her low notes like a trumpet, and the compass of a mezzo-soprano besides.\\n\\nThe director yielded, and drew up the engagement in duplicate. Ashmead then borrowed the music and came back to the inn triumphant. He waved the agreement over his head, then submitted it to her. She glanced at it, made a wry face, and said, \\\"Two months! I never dreamed of such a thing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not worth your while to do it for less,\\\" said Ashmead. \\\"Come,\\\" said he, authoritatively, \\\"you have got a good bargain every way; so sign.\\\"\\n\\nShe lifted her head high, and looked at him like a lioness, at being ordered.\\n\\nAshmead replied by putting the paper before her and giving her the pen.\\n\\nShe cast one more reproachful glance, then signed like a lamb.\\n\\n\\\"Now,\\\" said she, turning fretful, \\\"I want a piano.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You shall have one,\\\" said he coaxingly. He went to the landlord and inquired if there was a piano in the house.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, there is one,\\\" said he.\\n\\n\\\"And it is mine,\\\" said a sharp female voice.\\n\\n\\\"May I beg the use of it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said the lady, a tall, bony spinster. \\\"I cannot have it strummed on and put out of tune by everybody.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But this is not everybody. The lady I want it for is a professional musician. Top of the tree.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The hardest strummers going.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, mademoiselle, this lady is going to sing at the opera. She *must* study. She *must* have a piano.\\n\\n\\\"But \\\\[grimly\\\\] she need not have mine.\\n\\n\\\"Then she must leave the hotel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh \\\\[haughtily\\\\], *that* is as she pleases.\\\"\\n\\nAshmead went to Ina Klosking in a rage and told her all this, and said he would take her to another hotel kept by a Frenchman: these Germans were bears. But Ina Klosking just shrugged her shoulders, and said, \\\"Take me to her.\\\"\\n\\nHe did so; and she said, in German, \\\"Madam, I can quite understand your reluctance to have your piano strummed. But as your hotel is quiet and respectable, and I am unwilling to leave it, will you permit me to play to you? and then you shall decide whether I am worthy to stay or not.\\\"\\n\\nThe spinster drank those mellow accents, colored a little, looked keenly at the speaker, and, after a moment's reflection, said, half sullenly, \\\"No, madam, you are polite. I must risk my poor piano. Be pleased to come with me.\\\"\\n\\nShe then conducted them to a large, unoccupied room on the first-floor, and unlocked the piano, a very fine one, and in perfect tune.\\n\\nIna sat down, and performed a composition then in vogue.\\n\\n\\\"You play correctly, madam,\\\" said the spinster; \\\"but your music--what stuff! Such things are null. They vex the ear a little, but they never reach the mind.\\\"\\n\\nAshmead was wroth, and could hardly contain himself; but the Klosking was amused, and rather pleased. \\\"Mademoiselle has positive tastes in music,\\\" said she; \\\"all the better.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said the spinster, \\\"most music is mere noise. I hate and despise forty-nine compositions out of fifty; but the fiftieth I adore. Give me something simple, with a little soul in it--if you can.\\\"\\n\\nIna Klosking looked at her, and observed her age and her dress, the latter old-fashioned. She said, quietly, \\\"Will mademoiselle do me the honor to stand before me? I will sing her a trifle my mother taught me.\\\"\\n\\nThe spinster complied, and stood erect and stiff, with her arms folded. Ina fixed her deep eyes on her, playing a liquid prelude all the time, then swelled her chest and sung the old Venetian cauzonet, \\\"Il pescatore de'll' onda.\\\" It is a small thing, but there is no limit to the genius of song. The Klosking sung this trifle with a voice so grand, sonorous, and sweet, and, above all, with such feeling, taste, and purity, that somehow she transported her hearers to Venetian waters, moonlit, and thrilled them to the heart, while the great glass chandelier kept ringing very audibly, so true, massive, and vibrating were her tones in that large, empty room.\\n\\nAt the first verse that cross-grained spinster, with real likes and dislikes, put a bony hand quietly before her eyes. At the last, she made three strides, as a soldier marches, and fell all of a piece, like a wooden *mannequin,* on the singer's neck. \\\"Take my piano,\\\" she sobbed, \\\"for you have taken the heart out of my body.\\\"\\n\\nIna returned her embrace, and did not conceal her pleasure. \\\"I am very proud of such a conquest,\\\" said she.\\n\\nFrom that hour Ina was the landlady's pet. The room and piano were made over to her, and, being in a great fright at what she had undertaken, she studied and practiced her part night and day. She made Ashmead call a rehearsal next day, and she came home from it wretched and almost hysterical.\\n\\nShe summoned her slave Ashmead; he stood before her with an air of hypocritical submission.\\n\\n\\\"The Flute was not at rehearsal, sir,\\\" said she, severely, \\\"nor the Oboe, nor the Violoncello.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Just like 'em,\\\" said Ashmead, tranquilly.\\n\\n\\\"The tenor is a quavering stick. He is one of those who think that an unmanly trembling of the voice represents every manly passion.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Their name is legion.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The soprano is insipid. And they are all imperfect--contentedly imperfect, How can people sing incorrectly? It is like lying.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is what makes it so common--he! he!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do not desire wit, but consolation. I believe you are Mephistopheles himself in disguise; for ever since I signed that diabolical compact you made me, I have been in a state of terror, agitation, misgiving, and misery--and I thank and bless you for it; for these thorns and nettles they lacerate me, and make me live. They break the dull, lethargic agony of utter desolation.\\\"\\n\\nThen, as her nerves were female nerves, and her fortitude female fortitude, she gave way, for once, and began to cry patiently.\\n\\nAshmead the practical went softly away and left her, as we must leave her for a time, to battle her business with one hand and her sorrow with the other.\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\nIN the Hotel Russie, at Frankfort, there was a grand apartment, lofty, spacious, and richly furnished, with a broad balcony overlooking the Platz, and roofed, so to speak, with colored sun-blinds, which softened the glare of the Rhineland sun to a rosy and mellow light.\\n\\nIn the veranda, a tall English gentleman was leaning over the balcony, smoking a cigar, and being courted by a fair young lady. Her light-gray eyes dwelt on him in a way to magnetize a man, and she purred pretty nothings at his ear, in a soft tone she reserved for males. Her voice was clear, loud, and rather high-pitched whenever she spoke to a person of her own sex; a comely English blonde, with pale eyelashes; a keen, sensible girl, and not a downright wicked one; only born artful. This was Fanny Dover; and the tall gentleman--whose relation she was, and whose wife she resolved to be in one year, three years, or ten, according to his power of resistance--was Harrington Vizard, a Barfordshire squire, with twelve thousand acres and a library.\\n\\nAs for Fanny, she had only two thousand pounds in all the world; so compensating Nature endowed her with a fair complexion, gray, mesmeric eyes, art, and resolution--qualities that often enable a poor girl to conquer landed estates, with their male incumbrances.\\n\\nBeautiful and delicate--on the surface--as was Miss Dover's courtship of her first cousin once removed, it did not strike fire; it neither pleased nor annoyed him; it fell as dead as a lantern firing on an iceberg. Not that he disliked her by any means. But he was thirty-two, had seen the world, and had been unlucky with women. So he was now a *divorce',* and a declared woman-hater; railed on them, and kept them at arm's-length, Fanny Dover included. It was really comical to see with what perfect coolness and cynical apathy he parried the stealthy advances of this cat-like girl, a mistress in the art of pleasing--when she chose.\\n\\nInside the room, on a couch of crimson velvet, sat a young lady of rare and dazzling beauty. Her face was a long but perfect oval, pure forehead, straight nose, with exquisite nostrils; coral lips, and ivory teeth. But what first struck the beholder were her glorious dark eyes, and magnificent eyebrows as black as jet. Her hair was really like a raven's dark-purple wing.\\n\\nThese beauties, in a stern character, might have inspired awe; the more so as her form and limbs were grand and statuesque for her age; but all was softened down to sweet womanhood by long, silken lashes, often lowered, and a gracious face that blushed at a word, blushed little, blushed much, blushed pinky, blushed pink, blushed roseate, blushed rosy; and, I am sorry to say, blushed crimson, and even scarlet, in the course of those events I am about to record, as unblushing as turnip, and cool as cucumber. This scale of blushes arose not out of modesty alone, but out of the wide range of her sensibility. On hearing of a noble deed, she blushed warm approbation; at a worthy sentiment, she blushed heart-felt sympathy. If you said a thing at the fire that might hurt some person at the furthest window, she would blush for fear it should be overheard, and cause pain.\\n\\nIn short, it was her peculiarity to blush readily for matters quite outside herself, and to show the male observer (if any) the amazing sensibility, apart from egotism, that sometimes adorns a young, high-minded woman, not yet hardened by the world.\\n\\nThis young lady was Zoe Vizard, daughter of Harrington's father by a Greek mother, who died when she was twelve years of age. Her mixed origin showed itself curiously. In her figure and face she was all Greek, even to her hand, which was molded divinely, but as long and large as befitted her long, grand, antique arm; but her mind was Northern--not a grain of Greek subtlety in it. Indeed, she would have made a poor hand at dark deceit, with a transparent face and eloquent blood, that kept coursing from her heart to her cheeks and back again, and painting her thoughts upon her countenance.\\n\\nHaving installed herself, with feminine instinct, in a crimson couch that framed her to perfection, Zoe Vizard was at work embroidering. She had some flowers, and their leaves, lying near her on a little table, and, with colored silks, chenille, etc., she imitated each flower and its leaf very adroitly without a pattern. This was clever, and, indeed, rather a rare talent; but she lowered her head over this work with a demure, beaming complacency embroidery alone never yet excited without external assistance. Accordingly, on a large stool, or little ottoman, at her feet, but at a respectful distance, sat a young man, almost her match in beauty, though in quite another style. In height about five feet ten, broad-shouldered, clean-built, a model of strength, agility, and grace. His face fair, fresh, and healthy-looking; his large eyes hazel; the crisp curling hair on his shapely head a wonderful brown in the mass, but with one thin streak of gold above the forehead, and all the loose hairs glittering golden. A short clipped mustache saved him from looking too feminine, yet did not hide his expressive mouth. He had white hands, as soft and supple as a woman's, a mellow voice, and a winning tongue. This dangerous young gentleman was gazing softly on Zoe Vizard and purring in her ear; and she was conscious of his gaze without looking at him, and was sipping the honey, and showed it, by seeming more absorbed in her work than girls ever really are.\\n\\nMatters, however, had not gone openly very far. She was still on her defense: so, after imbibing his flatteries demurely a long time, she discovered, all in one moment, that they were objectionable. \\\"Dear me, Mr. Severne,\\\" said she, \\\"you do nothing but pay compliments.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How can I help it, sitting here?\\\" inquired he.\\n\\n\\\"There--there,\\\" said she: then, quietly, \\\"Does it never occur to you that only foolish people are pleased with flatteries?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have heard that; but I don't believe it. I know it makes me awfully happy whenever you say a kind word of me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is far from proving your wisdom,\\\" said Zoe; \\\"and, instead of dwelling on my perfections, which do not exist, I wish you would *tell* me things.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What things?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How can I tell till I hear them? Well, then, things about yourself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is a poor subject.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let me be the judge.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, there are lots of fellows who are always talking about themselves: let me be an exception.\\\"\\n\\nThis answer puzzled Zoe, and she was silent, and put on a cold look. She was not accustomed to be refused anything reasonable.\\n\\nSeverne examined her closely, and saw he was expected to obey her. He then resolved to prepare, in a day or two, an autobiography full of details that should satisfy Zoe's curiosity, and win her admiration and her love. But he could not do it all in a moment, because his memory of his real life obstructed his fancy. Meantime he operated a diversion. He said, \\\"Set a poor fellow an example. Tell me something about _yourself--_since I have the bad taste, and the presumption, to be interested in you, and can't help it. Did you spring from the foam of the Archipelago? or are you descended from Bacchus and Ariadne?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you want sensible answers, ask sensible questions,\\\" said Zoe, trying to frown him down with her black brows; but her sweet cheek would tint itself, and her sweet mouth smile and expose much intercoral ivory.\\n\\n\\\"Well, then,\\\" said he, \\\"I will ask you a prosaic question, and I only hope you won't think it impertinent. How--ever-- did such a strangely assorted party as yours come to travel together? And if Vizard has turned woman-hater, as he pretends, how comes he to be at the head of a female party who are not *all* of them--\\\" he hesitated.\\n\\n\\\"Go on, Mr. Severne; not all of them what?\\\" said Zoe, prepared to stand up for her sex.\\n\\n\\\"Not perfect?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is a very cautious statement, and--there--you are as slippery as an eel; there is no getting hold of you. Well, never mind, I will set you an example of communicativeness, and reveal this mystery hidden as yet from mankind.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Speak, dread queen; thy servant heareth.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ha! ha! ha! Mr. Severne, you amuse *me.\\\"*\\n\\n\\\"You only interest *me,\\\"* was the soft reply.\\n\\nZoe blushed pink, but turned it off. \\\"Then why do you not attend to my interesting narrative, instead of-- Well, then, it began with my asking the dear fellow to take me a tour, especially to Rome.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You wanted to see the statues of your ancestors, and shame them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Much obliged; I was not quite such a goose. I wanted to see the Tiber, and the Colosseum, and Trajan's Pillar, and the Tarpeian Rock, and the one everlasting city that binds ancient and modern history together.\\\"\\n\\nShe flashed her great eyes on him, and he was dumb. She had risen above the region of his ideas. Having silenced her commentator, she returned to her story, \\\"Well, dear Harrington said 'yes' directly. So then I told Fanny, and she said, 'Oh, do take me with you?' Now, of course I was only too glad to have Fanny; she is my relation, and my friend.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Happy girl!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Be quiet, please. So I asked Harrington to let me have Fanny with us, and you should have seen his face. What, he travel with a couple of us! He-- I don't see why I should tell you what the monster said.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes, please do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You won't go telling anybody else, then?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not a living soul, upon my honor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, then,\\\" he said--she began to blush like a rose--\\\"that he looked on me as a mere female in embryo; I had not yet developed the vices of my sex. But Fanny Dover was a ripe flirt, and she would set me flirting, and how could he manage the pair? In short, sir, he refused to take us, and gave his reasons, such as they were, poor dear! Then I had to tell Fanny. Then she began to cry, and told me to go without her. But I would not do that, when I had once asked her. Then she clung round my neck, and kissed me, and begged me to be cross and sullen, and tire out dear Harrington.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is like her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How do you know?\\\" said Zoe sharply.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I have studied her character.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"When, pray?\\\" said Zoe, ironically, yet blushing a little, because her secret meaning was, \\\"You are always at my apron strings, and have no time to fathom Fanny.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"When I have nothing better to do--when you are out of the room.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I shall be out of the room very soon, if you say another word.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And serve me right, too. I am a fool to talk when you allow me to listen.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is incorrigible!\\\" said Zoe, pathetically. \\\"Well, then, I refused to pout at Harrington. It is not as if he had no reason to distrust women, poor dear darling. I invited Fanny to stay a month with us; and, when once she was in the house, she soon got over me, and persuaded me to play sad, and showed me how to do it. So we wore long faces, and sweet resignation, and were never cross, but kept turning tearful eyes upon our victim.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ha! ha! How absurd of Vizard to tell you that two women would be too much for one man.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, it was the truth; and girls are artful creatures, especially when they put their heads together. But hear the end of all our cunning. One day, after dinner, Harrington asked us to sit opposite him; so we did, and felt guilty. He surveyed us in silence a little while, and then he said, 'My young friends, you have played your little game pretty well, especially you, Zoe, that are a novice in the fine arts compared with Miss Dover.' Histrionic talent ought to be rewarded; he would relent, and take us abroad, on one condition: there must be a chaperone. 'All the better,' said we hypocrites, eagerly; 'and who?'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"'Oh, a person equal to the occasion--an old maid as bitter against men as ever grapes were sour. She would follow us upstairs, downstairs, and into my lady's chamber. She would have an eye at the key-hole by day, and an ear by night, when we went up to bed and talked over the events of our frivolous day.' In short, he enumerated our duenna's perfections till our blood ran cold; and it was ever so long before he would tell us who it was-- Aunt Maitland. We screamed with surprise. They are like cat and dog, and never agree, except to differ. We sought an explanation of this strange choice. He obliged us. It was not for his gratification he took the old cat; it was for us. She would relieve him of a vast responsibility. The vices of her character would prove too strong for the little faults of ours, which were only volatility, frivolity, flirtation-- I will *not* tell you what he said.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I seem to hear Harrington talking,\\\" said Severne. \\\"What on earth makes him so hard upon women? Would you mind telling me that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Never ask me that question again,\\\" said Zoe, with sudden gravity.\\n\\n\\\"Well, I won't; I'll get it out of him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you say a word to him about it, I shall be shocked and offended.\\\"\\n\\nShe was pale and red by turns; but Severne bowed his head with a respectful submission that disarmed her directly. She turned her head away, and Severne, watching her, saw her eyes fill.\\n\\n\\\"How is it,\\\" said she thoughtfully, and looking away from him, \\\"that men leave out their sisters when they sum up womankind? Are not we women too? My poor brother quite forgets he has one woman who will never, never desert nor deceive him; dear, darling fellow!\\\" and with these three last words she rose and kissed the tips of her fingers, and waved the kiss to Vizard with that free magnitude of gesture which belonged to antiquity: it struck the Anglo-Saxon flirt at her feet with amazement. Not having good enough under his skin to sympathize with that pious impulse, he first stagnated a little while; and then, not to be silent altogether, made his little, stale, commonplace comment on what she had told him. \\\"Why, it is like a novel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A very unromantic one,\\\" replied Zoe.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know that. I have read very interesting novels with fewer new characters than this: there's a dark beauty, and a fair, and a duenna with an eagle eye and an aquiline nose.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hush!\\\" said Zoe: \\\"that is her room;\\\" and pointed to a chamber door that opened into the apartment.\\n\\nOh, marvelous female instinct! The duenna in charge was at that moment behind that very door, and her eye and her ear at the key-hole, turn about.\\n\\nSeverne continued his remarks, but in a lower voice.\\n\\n\\\"Then there's a woman-hater and a man-hater: good for dialogue.\\\"\\n\\nNow this banter did not please Zoe; so she fixed her eyes upon Severne, and said, \\\"You forget the principal figure--a mysterious young gentleman who looks nineteen, and is twenty-nine, and was lost sight of in England nine years ago. He has been traveling ever since, and where-ever he went he flirted; we gather so much from his accomplishment in the art; fluent, not to say voluble at times, but no egotist, for he never tells you anything about himself, nor even about his family, still less about the numerous *affaires de coeur* in which he has been engaged. Perhaps he is reserving it all for the third volume.\\\"\\n\\nThe attack was strong and sudden, but it failed. Severne, within the limits of his experience, was a consummate artist, and this situation was not new to him. He cast one gently reproachful glance on her, then lowered his eyes to the carpet, and kept them there. \\\"Do you think,\\\" said he, in a low, dejected voice, \\\"it can be any pleasure to a man to relate the follies of an idle, aimless life? and to you, who have given me higher aspirations, and made me awfully sorry, I cannot live my whole life over again. I can't bear to think of the years I have wasted,\\\" said he; \\\"and how can I talk to you, whom I reverence, of the past follies I despise? No, pray don't ask me to risk your esteem. It is so dear to me.\\\"\\n\\nThen this artist put in practice a little maneuver he had learned of compressing his muscles and forcing a little unwilling water into his eyes. So, at the end of his pretty little speech, he raised two gentle, imploring eyes, with half a tear in each of them. To be sure, Nature assisted his art for once; he did bitterly regret, but out of pure egotism, the years he had wasted, and wished with all his heart he had never known any woman but Zoe Vizard.\\n\\nThe combination of art and sincerity was too much for the guileless and inexperienced Zoe. She was grieved at the pain she had given, and rose to retire, for she felt they were both on dangerous ground; but, as she turned away, she made a little, deprecating gesture, and said, softly, \\\"Forgive me.\\\"\\n\\nThat soft tone gave Severne courage, and that gesture gave him an opportunity. He seized her hand, murmured, \\\"Angel of goodness!\\\" and bestowed a long, loving kiss on her hand that made it quiver under his lips.\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\" cried Miss Maitland, bursting into the room at the nick of time, yet feigning amazement.\\n\\nFanny heard the ejaculations, and whipped away from Harrington into the window. Zoe, with no motive but her own coyness, had already snatched her hand away from Severne.\\n\\nBut both young ladies were one moment too late. The eagle eye of a terrible old maid had embraced the entire situation, and they saw it had.\\n\\nHarrington Vizard, Esq., smoked on, with his back to the group. But the rest were a picture--the mutinous face and keen eyes of Fanny Dover, bristling with defense, at the window; Zoe blushing crimson, and newly started away from her too-enterprising wooer; and the tall, thin, grim old maid, standing stiff, as sentinel, at the bedroom door, and gimleting both her charges alternately with steel-gray orbs; she seemed like an owl, all eyes and beak.\\n\\nWhen the chaperon had fixed the situation thoroughly, she stalked erect into the room, and said, very expressively, \\\"I am afraid I disturb you.\\\"\\n\\nZoe, from crimson, blushed scarlet, and hung her head; but Fanny was ready.\\n\\n\\\"La! aunt,\\\" said she, ironically, and with pertness infinite, \\\"you know you are always welcome. Where ever have you been all this time? We were afraid we had lost you.\\\"\\n\\nAunt fired her pistol in reply: \\\"I was not far off--most fortunately.\\\"\\n\\nZoe, finding that, even under crushing circumstances, Fanny had fight in her, glided instantly to her side, and Aunt Maitland opened battle all round.\\n\\n\\\"May I ask, sir,\\\" said she to Severne, with a horrible smile, \\\"what you were doing when I came in?\\\"\\n\\nZoe clutched Fanny, and both awaited Mr. Severne's reply for one moment with keen anxiety.\\n\\n\\\"My dear Miss Maitland,\\\" said that able young man, very respectfully, yet with a sort of cheerful readiness, as if he were delighted at her deigning to question him, \\\"to tell you the truth, I was admiring Miss Vizard's diamond ring.\\\"\\n\\nFanny tittered; Zoe blushed again at such a fib and such *aplomb.*\\n\\n\\\"Oh, indeed,\\\" said Miss Maitland; \\\"you were admiring it very close, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is like herself--it will bear inspection.\\\"\\n\\nThis was wormwood to Miss Maitland. \\\"Even in our ashes live their wonted fires;\\\" and, though she was sixty, she disliked to hear a young woman praised. She bridled, then returned to the attack.\\n\\n\\\"Next time you wish to inspect it, you had better ask her *to take it off,* and show you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"May I, Miss Maitland?\\\" inquired the ingenuous youth. \\\"She would not think that a liberty?\\\"\\n\\nHis mild effrontery staggered her for a moment, and she glared at him, speechless, but soon recovered, and said, bitterly, \\\"Evidently *not.\\\"* With this she turned her back on him rather ungraciously, and opened fire on her own sex.\\n\\n\\\"Zoe!\\\" (sharply).\\n\\n\\\"Yes, aunt \\\" (faintly).\\n\\n\\\"Tell your brother--if he can leave off smoking--I wish to speak to him.\\\"\\n\\nZoe hung her head, and was in no hurry to bring about the proposed conference.\\n\\nWhile she deliberated, says Fanny, with vast alacrity, \\\"I'll tell him, aunt.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Fanny!\\\" murmured Zoe, in a reproachful whisper.\\n\\n\\\"All right!\\\" whispered Fanny in reply, and whipped out on to the balcony. \\\"Here's Aunt Maitland wants to know if you ever leave off smoking;\\\" and she threw a most aggressive manner into the query.\\n\\nThe big man replied, composedly, \\\"Tell her I do--at meals and prayers; but I always *sleep* with a pipe in my mouth--heavily insured!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, then, you mustn't; for she has something very particular to say to you when you've done smoking.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Something particular! That means something disagreeable. Tell her I shall be smoking all day to-day.\\\"\\n\\nFanny danced into the room and said, \\\"He says he shall be smoking all day, *under the circumstances.\\\"*\\n\\nMiss Maitland gave this faithful messenger the look of a basilisk, and flounced to her own room. The young ladies instantly stepped out on the balcony, and got one on each side of Harrington, with the feminine instinct of propitiation; for they felt sure the enemy would tell, soon or late.\\n\\n\\\"What does the old cat want to talk to me about?\\\" said Harrington, lazily, to Fanny.\\n\\nIt was Zoe who replied:\\n\\n\\\"Can't you guess, dear?\\\" said she, tenderly--\\\"our misconduct.\\\" Then she put her head on his shoulder, as much as to say, \\\"But we have a more lenient judge here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As if I could not see *that* without her assistance!\\\" said Harrington Vizard. (Puff!) At which comfortable reply Zoe looked very rueful, and Fanny burst out laughing.\\n\\nSoon after this Fanny gave Zoe a look, and they retired to their rooms; and Zoe said she would never come out again, and Fanny must stay with her. Fanny felt sure *ennui* would thaw that resolve in a few hours; so she submitted, but declared it was absurd, and the very way to give a perfect trifle importance.\\n\\n\\\"Kiss your hand!\\\" said she, disdainfully--\\\"that is nothing. If I was the man, I'd have kissed both your cheeks long before this.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And I should have boxed your ears and made you cry,\\\" said Zoe, with calm superiority.\\n\\nSo she had her way, and the deserted Severne felt dull, but was too good a general to show it. He bestowed his welcome company on Mr. Vizard, walked with him, talked with him, and made himself so agreeable, that Vizard, who admired him greatly, said to him, \\\"What a good fellow you are, to bestow your sunshine on me. I began to be afraid those girls had got you, and tied you to their apron-strings altogether.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no!\\\" said Severne: \\\"they are charming; but, after all, one can't do without a male friend: there are so few things that interest ladies. Unless you can talk red-hot religion, you are bound to flirt with them a little. To be sure, they look shy, if you do, but if you don't--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They *are* bored; whereas they only *looked* shy. I know 'em. Call another subject, please.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I will; but perhaps it may not be so agreeable a one.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is very unlikely,\\\" said the woman-hater, dryly.\\n\\n\\\"Well, it is Tin. I'm rather short. You see, when I fell in with you at Monaco, I had no idea of coming this way; but, meeting with an old college friend--what a tie college is, isn't it? There is nothing like it; when you have been at college with a man, you seem never to wear him out, as you do the acquaintances you make afterward.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is very true,\\\" said Vizard warmly.\\n\\n\\\"Isn't it? Now, for instance, if I had only known you of late years, I should feel awfully shy of borrowing a few hundreds of you--for a month or two.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know why you should, old fellow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should, though. But having been at college together makes all the difference. I don't mind telling you that I have never been at Homburg without taking a turn at the table, and I am grizzling awfully now at not having sent to my man of business for funds.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How much do you want? That is the only question.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Glad to hear it,\\\" thought Severne. \\\"Well, let me see, you can't back your luck with less than five hundred.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, but we have been out two months; I am afraid I haven't so much left. Just let me see.\\\" He took out his pocket-book, and examined his letter of credit. \\\"Do you want it to-day?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, yes; I do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, then, I am afraid you can only have three hundred. But I will telegraph Herries, and funds will be here to-morrow afternoon.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All right,\\\" said Severne.\\n\\nVizard took him to the bank, and exhausted his letter of credit: then to the telegraph-office, and telegraphed Herries to enlarge his credit at once. He handed Severne the three hundred pounds. The young man's eye flashed, and it cost him an effort not to snatch them and wave them over his head with joy: but he controlled himself, and took them like two-pence-halfpenny. \\\"Thank you, old fellow,\\\" said he. Then, still more carelessly, \\\"Like my I O U?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As you please,\\\" said Vizard, with similar indifference; only real.\\n\\nAfter he had got the money, Severne's conversational powers relaxed--short answers--long reveries.\\n\\nVizard observed, stopped short, and eyed him. \\\"I remember something at Oxford, and I am afraid you are a gambler; if you are, you won't be good for much till you have lost that three hundred. It will be a dull evening for me without you: I know what I'll do--I'll take my hen-party to the opera at Homburg. There are stalls to be got here. I'll get one for you, on the chance of your dropping in.\\\"\\n\\nThe stalls were purchased, and the friends returned at once to the hotel, to give the ladies timely intimation. They found Fanny and Zoe seated, rather disconsolate, in the apartment Zoe had formally renounced: at sight of the stall tickets, the pair uttered joyful cries, looked at each other, and vanished.\\n\\n\\\"You won't see *them* any more till dinner-time,\\\" said Vizard. \\\"They will be discussing dress, selecting dress, trying dresses, and changing dresses, for the next three hours.\\\" He turned round while speaking, and there was Severne slipping away to his own bedroom.\\n\\nThus deserted on all sides, he stepped into the balcony and lighted a cigar. While he was smoking it, he observed an English gentleman, with a stalwart figure and a beautiful brown beard, standing on the steps of the hotel. \\\"Halloo!\\\" said he, and hailed him. \\\"Hi, Uxmoor! is that you?\\\"\\n\\nLord Uxmoor looked up, and knew him. He entered the hotel, and the next minute the waiter ushered him into Vizard's sitting-room.\\n\\nLord Uxmoor, like Mr. Vizard, was a landed proprietor in Barfordshire. The county is large, and they lived too many miles apart to visit; but they met, and agreed, at elections and county business, and had a respect for each other.\\n\\nMeeting at Frankfort, these two found plenty to say to each other about home; and as Lord Uxmoor was alone, Vizard asked him to dine. \\\"You will balance us,\\\" said he: \\\"we are terribly overpetticoated, and one of them is an old maid. We generally dine at the *table-d'hote,* but I have ordered dinner *here* to-day: we are going to the opera at Homburg. You are not obliged to do that, you know. You are in for a bad dinner, that is all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To tell the truth,\\\" said Lord Uxmoor, \\\"I don't care for music.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then you deserve a statue for not pretending to love it. I adore it, for my part, and I wish I was going alone, for my hens will be sure to cackle *mal 'a propos,* and spoil some famous melody with talking about it, and who sung it in London, instead of listening to it, and thanking God for it in deep silence.\\\"\\n\\nLord Uxmoor stared a little at this sudden sally, for he was unacquainted with Vizard's one eccentricity, having met him only on county business, at which he was extra rational, and passed for a great scholar. He really did suck good books as well as cigars.\\n\\nAfter a few more words, they parted till dinner-time.\\n\\nLord Uxmoor came to his appointment, and found his host and Miss Maitland, whom he knew; and he was in languid conversation with them, when a side-door opened, and in walked Fanny Dover, fair and bright, in Cambridge blue, her hair well dressed by Zoe's maid in the style of the day. Lord Uxmoor rose, and received his fair country-woman with respectful zeal; he had met her once before. She, too, sparkled with pleasure at meeting a Barfordshire squire with a long pedigree, purse, and beard--three things she admired greatly.\\n\\nIn the midst of this, in glided Zoe, and seemed to extinguish everybody, and even to pale the lights, with her dark yet sunlike beauty. She was dressed in a creamy-white satin that glinted like mother-of-pearl, its sheen and glory unfrittered with a single idiotic trimming; on her breast a large diamond cross. Her head was an Athenian sculpture--no chignon, but the tight coils of antiquity; at their side, one diamond star sparkled vivid flame, by its contrast with those polished ebon snakes.\\n\\nLord Uxmoor was dazzled, transfixed, at the vision, and bowed very low when Vizard introduced him in an off-hand way, saying, \\\"My sister, Miss Vizard; but I dare say you have met her at the county balls.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have never been so fortunate,\\\" said Uxmoor, humbly.\\n\\n\\\"I have,\\\" said Zoe; \\\"that is, I saw you waltzing with Lady Betty Gore at the race ball two years ago.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What!\\\" said Vizard, alarmed. \\\"Uxmoor, were you waltzing with Lady Betty Gore?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have it on too high an authority for me to contradict.\\\"\\n\\nFinding Zoe was to be trusted as a county chronicle, Vizard turned sharply to her, and said, \\\"And was he flirting with her?\\\"\\n\\nZoe colored a little, and said, \\\"Now, Harrington, how can I tell?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You little hypocrite,\\\" said Vizard, \\\"who can tell better?\\n\\nAt this retort Zoe blushed high, and the water came into her eyes.\\n\\nNobody minded that but Uxmoor, and Vizard went on to explain, \\\"That Lady Betty Gore is as heartless a coquette as any in the county; and don't you flirt with her, or you will get entangled.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You disapprove her,\\\" said Uxmoor, coolly; \\\"then I give her up forever.\\\" He looked at Zoe while he said this, and felt how easy it would be to resign Lady Betty and a great many more for this peerless creature. He did not mean her to understand what was passing in his mind; he did not know how subtle and observant the most innocent girl is in such matters. Zoe blushed, and drew away from him. Just then Ned Severne came in, and Vizard introduced him to Uxmoor with great geniality and pride. The charming young man was in a black surtout, with a blue scarf, the very tint for his complexion.\\n\\nThe girls looked at one another, and in a moment Fanny was elected Zoe's agent. She signaled Severne, and when he came to her she said, for Zoe, \\\"Don't you know we are going to the opera at Homburg?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I know,\\\" said he, \\\"and I hope you will have a pleasanter evening than I shall.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are not coming with us?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said he, sorrowfully.\\n\\n\\\"You had better,\\\" said Fanny, with a deal of quiet point, more, indeed, than Zoe's pride approved.\\n\\n\\\"Not if Mr. Severne has something more attractive,\\\" said she, turning palish and pinkish by turns.\\n\\nAll this went on *sotto voce,* and Uxmoor, out of good-breeding, entered into conversation with Miss Maitland and Vizard. Severne availed himself of this diversion, and fixed his eyes on Zoe with an air of gentle reproach, then took a letter out of his pocket, and handed it to Fanny. She read it, and gave it to Zoe.\\n\\nIt was dated from \\\"The Golden Star,\\\" Homburg.\\n\\n\\\"DEAR NED--I am worse to-day, and all alone. Now and then I almost fear I may not pull through. But perhaps that is through being so hipped. Do come and spend this evening with me like a good, kind fellow.\\n\\n\\\"Telegraph reply.\\n\\nS. T.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Poor fellow,\\\" said Ned; \\\"my heart bleeds for him.\\\"\\n\\nZoe was affected by this, and turned liquid and loving eyes on \\\"dear Ned.\\\" But Fanny stood her ground. \\\"Go to 'S. T.' to-morrow morning, but don't desert 'Z. V.' and 'F. D.' to-night.\\\" Zoe smiled.\\n\\n\\\"But I have telegraphed!\\\" objected Ned.\\n\\n\\\"Then telegraph again--*not,\\\"* said Fanny firmly.\\n\\nNow, this was unexpected. Severne had set his heart upon *rouge et noir,* but still he was afraid of offending Zoe; and, besides, he saw Uxmoor, with his noble beard and brown eyes, casting rapturous glances at her. \\\"Let Miss Vizard decide,\\\" said he. \\\"Don't let me be so unhappy as to offend her twice in one day.\\\"\\n\\nZoe's pride and goodness dictated her answer, in spite of her wishes. She said, in a low voice, \\\"Go to your sick friend.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There,\\\" said Severne.\\n\\n\\\"I hear,\\\" said Fanny. \\\"She means 'go;' but you shall repent it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I mean what I say,\\\" said Zoe, with real dignity. \\\"It is my habit.\\\" And the next moment she quietly left the room.\\n\\nShe sat down in her bedroom, mortified and alarmed. What! Had it come to this, that she felt her heart turn cold just because that young man said he could not accompany her--on a single evening! Then first she discovered that it was for him she had dressed, and had, for once, beautified her beauty--for *him;* that with Fanny she had dwelt upon the delights of the music, but had secretly thought of appearing publicly on *his* arm, and dazzling people by their united and contrasted beauty.\\n\\nShe rose, all of a sudden, and looked keenly at herself in the glass, to see if she had not somehow overrated her attractions. But the glass was reassuring. It told her not one man in a million could go to a sick friend that night, when he might pass the evening by her side, and visit his friend early in the morning. Best loved is best served. Tears of mortified vanity were in her eyes; but she smiled through them at the glass; then dried them carefully, and went back to the dining-room radiant, to all appearance.\\n\\nDinner was just served, and her brother, to do honor to the new-comer, waved his sister to a seat by Lord Uxmoor. He looked charmed at the arrangement, and showed a great desire to please her, but at first was unable to find good topics. After several timid overtures on his part, she assisted him, out of good-nature, She knew by report that he was a very benevolent young man, bent on improving the home, habits, wages, and comforts of the agricultural poor. She led him to this, and his eyes sparkled with pleasure, and his homely but manly face lighted, and was elevated by the sympathy she expressed in these worthy objects. He could not help thinking: \\\"What a Lady Uxmoor this would make! She and I and her brother might leaven the county.\\\"\\n\\nAnd all this time she would not even bestow a glance on Severne. She was not an angel. She had said, \\\"Go to your sick friend;\\\" but she had not said, \\\"I will smart alone if you *do.\\\"*\\n\\nSeverne sat by Fanny, and seemed dejected, but, as usual, polite and charming. She was smilingly cruel; regaled him with Lord Uxmoor's wealth and virtues, and said he was an excellent match, and all she-Barfordshire pulling caps for him. Severne only sighed; he offered no resistance; and at last she could not go on nagging a handsome fellow, who only sighed, so she said, \\\"Well, *there;* I advise you to join us before the opera is over, that is all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will, I will!\\\" said he, eagerly. \\\"Oh, thank you.\\\"\\n\\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/111](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/111)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637668158,\"title\":\"He could not stay eight months in any country; besides, there are no gambling-houses there.\\\"\"},\"digest\":\"jqt2ybRaCpLRx7EWMB4tplAQY_I_WIHeQUtxDOAVKXQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x90172af57cfCfbdA1dac8055668d7B5df7f90f1E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"in1k2DCcfdsnoljsTzn7RxGWmRWvVZiDod6CWxvEs0s\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Jh0v8U02CwUdZmLqaj_RI1x8S6gbOUy-CWY0r6IL-yU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"UgJJ8Am2Mfs2ymFXMncz6K_qqIr7qNZqJ9Obq_7afIUmcSWMYPmhlOXINlfWGzXOsfEJqNUapFrQm1YFMHWjuw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x510eaa354ec4fa4f8f21ad68325f16d389c42f001405e8a31b9b9c9c37c141e60848495760365eae14082a71282f897bf4b41bcfea04080560c7d338339c8cc31c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"in1k2DCcfdsnoljsTzn7RxGWmRWvVZiDod6CWxvEs0s\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Jh0v8U02CwUdZmLqaj_RI1x8S6gbOUy-CWY0r6IL-yU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jqt2ybRaCpLRx7EWMB4tplAQY_I_WIHeQUtxDOAVKXQ\"}"
