"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### The Prediction\\n\\nMany disease-causing DNA changes (variants) within gene regulatory elements might be found to play a role in multiple tissues or organs simultaneously (i.e., pleiotropic effect) to drive a convergent disease phenotype, contrary to the belief that regulatory elements are highly tissue-specific.\\n\\nExample: Multiple variants control the expression of IRX3 and IRX5 genes in both human adipose tissue and brain, the coordinated effects of which (less thermogenesis and more feeding behavior) result in obesity.\\n\\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34083488/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34083488/)\\n\\n### Context, please…\\n\\nDNA changes that are either inherited or newly emerged may cause genetic diseases or conditions (for example, diabetes). Many change the sequences of genes, but most don’t. They instead change the sequences of gene regulatory elements.\\n\\n### Regulatory what?\\n\\nRegulatory elements, such as promoter and enhancers, work coordinately to control gene expression. Think about the lights in your home. Every room has lights, but you might want a different brightness and hue for your bedroom vs your living room. Likewise, regulatory elements help ‘customize’ the activity of a given gene for different tissues in your body.\\n\\nThe popular belief is that regulatory elements are tissue-specific. That is, each tissue has its unique set of regulatory elements for a gene. But the notion described above that regulatory elements might be shared between tissues, and that the same DNA change might affect multiple tissues in such a way that the coordinated effects result in the same disease outcome is both unexpected and intriguing.\\n\\n### Credit\\n\\nDr. Débora Sobreira’s work in the lab of Marcelo Nóbrega.\",\"timestamp\":1638132624,\"title\":\"Biotech/Biomed Prediction #3\"},\"digest\":\"zfsajFnnT-npHZttL6O1sKXMzK1EFnDJ9aABmcOKBXY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x818a75FFb356645e086046ae2e1A554f46BAFC39\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"OKYcfolahaTdYQiiUGSWWs-mPXC3Rux1uiR_f6xvR1k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"UUmDeDIqovp8zryhRBKxFGHYI6L_CLMjq6u1wYTdwC8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"11PfV-ak4sGZepOK5YIEQtAFfTerQLe1-7uJE0JHXsjF8YmoO8DgaqKe5ZQMFJ6f4IpeZtNh3UokllNtWWRzOA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2223bd5f140513245c0f598c130b646cce1866da871e8797a3e464bfe4d942741edc7891f4539f171b525020adf5ce5f495e1fcabedb608cbdce03b18f8e4cd81b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"OKYcfolahaTdYQiiUGSWWs-mPXC3Rux1uiR_f6xvR1k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"UUmDeDIqovp8zryhRBKxFGHYI6L_CLMjq6u1wYTdwC8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"O68N7u9xP7mUTZLgq7y48iM69W01gGd6Y3-oh4Wtz7Y\"}"
