Benjamin Bratton posits that \\\"**Planetary-Scale Computation should be understood as the means of and for the liberation and articulation of public reason, collective intelligence and technical abstraction as collective self-composition.**\\\" This goal provides an imperative for a collective media (i.e., \\\"any extension ourselves\\\", in the words of Marshall McLuhan) that uses planetary-scale computation to help us better know (sense, feel, understand, etc) ourselves — this media must be decentralized in order to scale to 7.9 billion people.\\n\\n**\\\\[2\\\\] Framework**\\n\\nMedia and media platforms can be placed within a framework of scalability, decentralization, and agency that is analogous to that of the [Scalability Trilemma](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html) for blockchains. The evolution of media in the digital age of the 21st century has historically tended towards further scalability and further user agency/interactivity but only recently has media evolution along further decentralization taken place. The platonic ideal of the \\\"Open Metaverse\\\" exists as the simultaneous maximization of scalability, decentralization, and agency and therefore requires crypto (i.e., cryptoeconomic mechanisms, cryptographic protocols) to serve as the economic membrane for both decentralization but also scale that cannot be achieved in centralized models which become user extractive over time. AI and crypto can solve the [social scalability](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html) problems of our global, media ecosystem — Web3's promise is that of social scalability, that is to increase \\\"the number of people who can beneficially participate in the institution\\\" of our public digital space.\\n\\n**\\\\[3.0\\\\] Combinatorial Cryptomedia**\\n\\nThe simultaneous maximization of scalability, decentralization, and agency for media and media platforms requires further development and adoption of crypto and AI/ML-based innovations in social scalability. AI/ML techniques are already being applied to represent collective psychic processes by artists like Refik Anadol, who is actualizing the concepts of the \\\"collective unconscious\\\" (Carl Jung) and the \\\"collective memory\\\" (Maurice Halbwachs) within his artworks.\\n\\n**\\\\[3.1\\\\] Primordial Buzzword Soup: Crypto, NFTs, AI, and the Metaverse**\\n\\nIt turns out that the actualization of the Open Metaverse and the representation of our collective psychic processes within digital media turns out to be the same act. The [toys that will become the next big things](https://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy) are being created through combinationial experimentation of primitives within our zeitgeist’s primordial buzzword soup (crypto! NFTs! AI! metaverse!). We will be focusing on the toys emerging at the intersection of cryptomedia (of which I consider NFTs a subcategory) and AI/ML, namely iNFTs and AI-generated cryptomedia. This particular track of media evolution corresponds to a rightward movement in the upper half of my framework, in which already decentralized cryptomedia are seeking to increase scalability and agency **(NFTs → iNFTs and dNFTs → multisig i/dNFTs → fully decentralized cryptomedia)**. The synthesis of crypto and AI challenge [characterizations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1735&v=J2klGJRrjqw&feature=youtu.be) of these technologies that map them along opposite ends of the centralization-decentralization spectrum. Some continually advancing tech primitives (both crypto and non-crypto) that hold promise in helping achieve S/D/A simulmax include zkSTARKs/zkSNARKs, timelock encryption and VDFs, GPT+, Merkle-CRDTs, further adoption of freal-time streaming (RTS) architectures, dynamic bonding curves, and crypto-native serverless.\\n\\n**\\\\[3.2\\\\] Humanity's Mood Ring**\\n\\n> **Towards a Blueprint**: \\\\[*real-time streaming (RTS) architecture*\\\\] + \\\\[*VQGAN+CLIP* OR *NLP Sentiment Visualizer*\\\\] + \\\\[*federated learning*\\\\] + \\\\[*homomorphic encryption*\\\\] + \\\\[*DAO*\\\\] + \\\\[*Web3 social media/messaging*\\\\] + \\\\[*ZKPs*\\\\] + \\\\[*anti-Sybil mechanisms*: some combination of token-curated registries, [Proof-of-Humanity](https://blog.kleros.io/proof-of-humanity-an-explainer/), [decentralized trust graphs](https://github.com/CirclesUBI/whitepaper), [\\\"DAO for verifying humans\\\")](https://youtu.be/6LbRtvdRVBw?t=2040)\\n\\nImagine wearing a mood ring that reflects the current collective mood of humanity — this is Humanity's Mood Ring (HMR).

Jung**, *The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious*\\n\\nThe story of the 20th and 21st century is a story about humanity's realization and continued reconciliation of its status as an interconnected, planetary-scale force. The formalization of this relatively recent shared reality is a continuing process, for example, the Anthropocene Working Group of the International Commission of Stratigraphy is currently seeking to [identify a definitive geological marker based on radionuclides from atomic detonations from 1945 to 1963](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01641-5) in order to formalize the beginning of the geologic epoch of the Anthropocene, defined \\\"[as the period of time during which human activities have had an environmental impact on the Earth](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Anthropocene).\\\" Although the specific, defining \\\"moment\\\" of this collective realization will be a continued topic for retrospective narrativization, the mass articulation of the concept of mutually assured destruction via full-scale nuclear war throughout the Cold War era is clearly a prime candidate. Since the end of the Cold War, our global \\\"[Contemporary Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_by_period#Contemporary_Period_(1945%E2%80%93present))\\\" has tautologically been defined by those happenings that highlight the unmistakably interconnected nature of humanity — global contagion and virality takes on financial, ecological, memetic/informatic, and, as has been made evident to us most recently in the form of COVID-19, biomaterialistic forms. As I put the finishing touches on this piece on November 26th, [a new coronavirus variant](https://www.ft.com/content/8df04124-c8e7-4c30-b4da-082ea635f308) reminds us, yet again, of the inescapably interconnected nature of our modern existence.\\n\\nFrom *[What is Planetary-Scale Computation For?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8LzY24ChtQ)* by **Benjamin Bratton**:\\n\\n> *\\\\[8:00\\\\]* **Benjamin**: The very concept of climate change itself, not the chemical and ecological phenomena, but the *concept* of climate change (the model of the statistical regularity that we refer to as \\\"climate change\\\") is itself an epistemological accomplishment of planetary-scale computation.

A breakdown of this work is as follows:\\n\\n* \\\"**Towards ...\\\"**: I recognzie that the scope of this work is extremely ambitious (some might argue hubristic) so I'll be happy to have been *directionally* correct.\\n* **\\\"... a blueprint for ...\\\"**: \\\"Blueprint\\\" because I will point out the *actual* or near existence of modules that are *already* making planetary-scale cryptomedia a reality.\\n* **\\\" ... planetary-scale ...\\\"**: Borrowed from Benjamin Bratton's concept of [planetary-scale computation](https://strelkamag.com/en/article/new-world-order-for-planetary-governance). For our purposes, that cryptomedia is \\\"planetary-scale\\\" means that it is technically *and* socially scalable across the 7.9+ billion people living on Earth.\\n* **\\\" ... cryptomedia\\\"**: Jacob Horne ([ZORA](https://zora.co/) co-founder and from whom I co-opt the term \\\"cryptomedia\\\") has defined cryptomedia as a \\\"medium for anyone on the internet to create *universally accessible* and *individual ownable* hypermedia.\\\" NFTs are a subset of cryptomedia.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \\\\[2\\\\] The Framework\\n\\n![This three dimensions of media in this framework are analagous to the three properties of blockchains implied by the Scalability Trilemma.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vLwEnsIwpnLATZKQPvTPD.png?height=1185&width=1419&&size=large)\\n\\n*View on [Figjam](https://www.figma.com/file/funHMjtAf1Pnaq7pbq5iDg/planetary-scale-cryptomedia?node-id=0%3A1) for better resolution.*\\n\\nThis framework places media and media platforms along three dimensions:\\n\\n* **x-axis**: Scalability\\n* **y-axis**: Decentralization\\n* **node shape**: Agency / Interactivity / Degrees of Freedom\\n\\nBroadly speaking, Web 2.0 media companies sought to maximize some combination of the scalability of their media assets and the level of agency offered to the user/consumer/player. While jpeg/mp3/mp4 files are nearly infinitely scalable in that the same mp4 file can be replicated and distributed at [zero marginal cost](https://stratechery.com/aggregation-theory/), the affordances for interaction possible in these mediums are scant. On the other hand, while video games like Minecraft and Fortnite are highly interactive and afford higher degrees of freedom, the scalability of multiplayer video games across large numbers of players is limited by [technical constraints in synchronizing interactions and dependencies](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/super-lag-during-large-fleet-battles-node-crashes-etc/90824) between distributed clients (players). It was only until relatively recently that the idea of another dimension of consideration for media, namely decentralization, become widespread with the cultural rise of NFTs and \\\"Web3\\\".\\n\\nThe platonic ideal of the \\\"Open Metaverse\\\" exists as a circle in the top right corner of my proposed framework, thereby representing media that simultaneously maximizes scalability, decentralization, and agency. That [the establishment of a Metaverse requires crypto to serve as a robust economic membrane](https://naavik.co/business-breakdowns/into-the-void) can be explained through this framework by interpreting Web3 as a reaction to the limitations of scalability achieved through centralization — the centralized nature of Web 2.0 platforms limit both the extensity and intensity of participation in spaces that disproportionately extract from users. Web3's promise is *social scalability*, that is to increase \\\"the number of people can beneficially participate in the institution\\\" of our public digital space.\\n\\nfrom [Money, blockchains, and social scalability](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html) by **Nick Szabo**:\\n\\n> Social scalability is the ability of an institution –- a relationship or shared endeavor, in which multiple people repeatedly participate, and featuring customs, rules, or other features which constrain or motivate participants’ behaviors -- to overcome shortcomings in human minds and in the motivating or constraining aspects of said institution that limit who or how many can successfully participate. Social scalability is about the ways and extents to which participants can think about and respond to institutions and fellow participants as the variety and numbers of participants in those institutions or relationships grow. It's about human limitations, not about technological limitations or physical resource constraints.\\n\\n> Even though social scalability is about the cognitive limitations and behavior tendencies of minds, not about the physical resource limitations of machines, it makes eminent sense, and indeed is often crucial, to think and talk about the social scalability of a technology that facilitates an institution. The social scalability of an institutional technology depends on how that technology constrains or motivates participation in that institution, including protection of participants and the institution itself from harmful participation or attack. One way to estimate the social scalability of an institutional technology is by the number of people who can beneficially participate in the institution. Another way to estimate social scalability is by the extra benefits and harms an institution bestows or imposes on participants, before, for cognitive or behavioral reasons, the expected costs and other harms of participating in an institution grow faster than its benefits.\\n\\nThe crux of the current iteration of this Web3/crypto/Metaverse buzzword zeitgeist can be boiled down to one simple question: What does a socially scalable planetary-scale media that trustlessly affords individuals agency and expressivity look like? **Or, put simply, how do you get 7.9 billion people in the same room together?**\\n\\nIf we were to define that \\\"room\\\" as a very large physical building then Tim Urban has shown us that [cramming 7+ billion people together](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/03/7-3-billion-people-one-building.html) is possible, but \\\"beneficial participation\\\" would probably be impossible under such conditions. We could dematerialize our definition of \\\"room\\\" to a single voicecall between all 7.9 billion of us but, as anyone who has ever played COD on Xbox Live knows, beneficial participation would still be impossible. A single chatroom, even if we suspended the laws of physics and assumed perfect synchronization with no latency across 7.9 billion connected devices, wouldn't be socially scalable for similar reasons. These are instances in which affordances for individuals' agency in shared spaces results in chaos.\\n\\nIf we dial back the individual affordances for agency/DOF/interactivity to allowing each person the bare minimum of communicating a \\\"0\\\" or \\\"1\\\" by flipping a single, pre-assigned pixel on a single 88,882 x 88,882 (= \\\\~7.9 billion) grid then, even assuming that we've solved the [proof of Humanity](https://blog.kleros.io/proof-of-humanity-an-explainer/) problem and that there's sufficient trust in the backend host(s), we still haven't scaled *beneficial* participation.\\n\\nWe can dial up individual affordances for expression/agency in digital space to its present maximum, in the form of a hypothetically perfectly decentralized and trustless Minecraft server instance with zero latency across 7.9 billion distributed devices, but the experience would probably devolve into a virtual rave at the [Schelling point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)) of (x=0, y=0, z=0). Needless to say, neither the addition of a global chatroom nor voicechat (either proximity-based vs global voicechat) would enable scalable beneficial participation.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \\\\[3\\\\] Combinatorial Cryptomedia\\n\\n> Innovations in social scalability involve institutional and technological improvements that move function from mind to paper or mind to machine, lowering cognitive costs while increasing the value of information flowing between minds, reducing vulnerability, and/or searching for and discovering new and mutually beneficial participants.\\n> — **Nick Szabo**, [Money, blockchains, and social scalability](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html)\\n\\nThe manifestation of the \\\"Open Metaverse\\\", abstractly conceptualized as the simultaneous maximization of scalability, decentralization, and agency under my proposed framework, requires further development and adoption of crypto and AI/ML-based *\\\"Innovations in social scalability\\\"* that *\\\"move function from ... mind to machine\\\",* thereby *\\\"lowering cognitive costs while increasing the value of information flowing between minds, reducing vulnerability\\\"* while also *\\\"searching for and discovering new and mutually beneficial participants\\\"* at the same time.\\n\\n![ ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MAJA9m1vJeVme8p7BsG8A.png?height=198&width=604)\\n\\n[https://youtu.be/MbT4809Jupg](https://youtu.be/MbT4809Jupg)\\n\\n*\\\"Unsupervised\\\" alludes to the use of [unspervised machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning) algorithms. Refik is known to use the [UMAP dimension reduction technique](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to create works such as these. UMAP belongs is in the class of unsupervised ML techniques known as unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques (aka \\\"clustering algorithms\\\"), of which [PCA](https://setosa.io/ev/principal-component-analysis/) and [t-SNE](https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/) also belong.*\\n\\nThe [new media art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media_art) works of [Refik Anadol](https://refikanadol.com/about/) represent the current cutting edge of the application of AI/ML methods on vast amounts of data in order to create art. While no human has the capability to meaningfully process the output of a hypothetical chatroom with 7.9 billion concurrent participants, machine learning algorithms *can*. Refik's \\\"*Data Universe*\\\" uses UMAP to reduce the 138,151 records in the [MoMA research dataset](https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection) down into 7 dimensions (x, y, z, r, g, b, t) where (x, y, z) represent coordinates in a 3 dimensional space, (r, g, b) represent red/green/blue, and (t) represents time. The largeness of the scale at which he's thinking about applying his techniques are made evident by his body of work and in statements such as those made in a [recent interview with the MoMA and Feral File](https://www.moma.org/magazine/articles/658), in which they speak about Refik's MoMA ongoing exhibition and corresponding NFT sales.\\n\\n> **Refik**: The first month of my residency at AMI, I found a wonderful open-source cultural archive in Istanbul, called [SALT](https://saltresearch.org/primo_library/libweb/static_htmls/salt/info_about_en_US.jsp), with 1.7 million documents. Seeing these documents inspired me to think about how I could use my training in both AI and visual arts to creatively engage with vast archives of human experience. Could we apply AI algorithms to a library that is open to everyone?\\n\\n> **Refik**: For me, art reflects humanity’s capacity for imagination. And if I push my compass to the edge of imagination, I find myself well connected with the machines, with the archives, with knowledge, and the collective memories of humanity.\\n\\nWhile Refik's use of advanced AI/ML methods in his ambition to artistically represent \\\"the collective memories of humanity\\\" is cutting edge, neither the idea of a collective psychic process nor the application of technology to actually represent said process is new.\\n\\nThe underlying idea goes at least as far back as Carl G. Jung's conception of the [collective unconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious) in a (now lost) 1916 essay, \\\"*The Structure of the Unconscious*.\\\" More notably however was Jung's \\\"*The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious*\\\"(1959), published two years prior to Jung's death in 1961. Though published decades before the rise of the Internet, his commentary resonates in our digital age more now than ever:\\n\\n> “The mirror does not flatter, it faithfully shows whatever looks into it; namely, the face we never show to the world because we cover it with the persona, the mask of the actor.”\\n> ― **C.G. Jung**, *The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious* (1959)\\n\\nThe practice of applying technology to represent collective psychic processes goes as far back as Maurizio Bolognini's *[Collective Intelligence Machines](https://www.bolognini.org/foto/cims.htm)* series, which began in the wake of the peak of the Dot-com era in 2000.\\n\\nFrom *[Programmed Machines: Infinity and Identity](https://www.generativeart.com/on/cic/papersGA2004/b9.htm)* (Dec 2004) by Maurizio Bolognini:\\n\\n![ ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aP0uWMruAbH7NGcHoNrYa.png?height=1124&width=892)\\n\\n> I would like to clarify this aspect by pointing out the ways in which results that are out of my control (in most cases images) are generated in my works. Delegating this process to a device is possible by adopting two different approaches:\\n>\\n> 1. the use of algorithms capable of making random choices (randomisation): any computer can generate pseudo-random numbers starting from a given numerical series which can be activated from various points each defined by a random event (for example, time measured in milliseconds);\\n> 2. the introduction of an evolutionary principle which transfers intelligence to the system; this can be done in two further ways: through **the application of artificial intelligence or collective intelligence**. In the former case, programming techniques (genetic algorithms, neural networks etc.) are used to develop different possible solutions according to their fitness to given objectives. In the latter case, procedures are applied which enable the public to interact and become part of the device.\\n\\nSo while neither the idea nor practice are new, between 1916 to 2000 to 2021, the progress of a suite of technologies that can be composed to simultaneously solve for scalability, decentralization, and agency are making the full manifestation of media that captures humanity's collective psychic processes a real, imminent possibility.\\n\\n![72 hour timelapse of Place (Reddit) (2017); Source: When Pixels Collide](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PAgdxqF6YrlBg_ZhvNqwD.gif?height=1000&width=1000)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \\\\[3.1\\\\] Primordial Buzzword Soup: Crypto, NFTs, AI, and the Metaverse\\n\\n![from Artist in the Cloud (Jul 2019) by Gene Kogan](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/luAAP7N6rNPzwMuL7OQvF.png?height=1365&width=1400)\\n\\nActualizing the Open Metaverse and representing our collective psychic processes within digital media turns out to be the same act. The underlying technological medium is agnostic to the labels that contemporary society assigns to the message conveyed by the medium so while the Metaverse (including the less articulated crypto-dependent instantiation of the Metaverse) is currently predominantly associated with gaming and art, we shouldn't forget that [big things start out looking like toys](https://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy) as evidenced by the likes of **Facebook**  (originally a website Mark Zuckerberg built to rate women's looks → now world's 8th largest public co) and **Nvidia** (initially focused on rendering 3D graphics for video games before ML explosion induced GPU demand → now world's 9th largest public co).\\n\\nThe \\\\[toy → big thing\\\\] dynamic is currently unfolding in our current zeitgeist of primordial buzzword soup (Crypto! NFTs! AI! Metaverse!) in which people are exploring combinations and conjugations of technological primitives that are presently manifesting as digital toys (aka media). These toys, for anyone paying attention, hold the latent potential for revolutionary change on a planetary-scale and, in much the same way that a college kid's dumb website and advancements in video gaming hardware led to revolutions in human connection and AI/ML, at least a few of the toys borne of the *artificialmetacryptoverseintelligence* buzzword soup will lead to effects of similar magnitudes.\\n\\nThis accelerating movement of combinatorial experimentation between these buzzword primitives is illustrated in the top half of the **[Scalability, Decentralization, and Interactivity](https://www.notion.so/Scalability-Decentralization-and-Interactivity-8fa41092919649d6908ba1edcdfcbe7c)** framework, in which decentralized cryptomedia are seeking to increase scalability and agency **(NFTs → iNFTs and dNFTs → multisig i/dNFTs →  fully decentralized cryptomedia)** and those mediums that are already sufficiently decentralized *and* scaled are tending towards increasing agency and interactivity (in addition to continued scale and decentralization). The former movement (NFTs → ... → fully decentralized cryptomedia) is what we'll be largely focusing on for the remainder of this work.\\n\\n*\\\\[Not explicitly represented within my framework but still worth mentioning is the less-pronounced movement of scaled media entities/platforms towards decentralization as in the case of Twitter's [BlueSky](https://blueskyweb.org/) initiative and Google's push for [FLoCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_Learning_of_Cohorts), though this movement is a topic for another time.\\\\]*\\n\\nWith respect to media, the intersection of crypto (of which I consider NFTs a subcategory) and AI/ML is currently manifesting as either:\\n\\n1. Intelligent NFTs (iNFTs), or NFTs with embedded intelligence. [Alethea AI](https://www.alethea.ai/) and [Altered State Machine](https://www.alteredstatemachine.xyz/) are two projects exploring this space.\\n2. AI-generated cryptomedia, in which cryptoeconomic protocols govern the creation process and the resultant media may or may not be issued as an NFT. [Botto](https://botto.com/) (issues creations as NFTs) and [Abraham](https://abraham.ai/) (does not currently issue creations as NFTs) are two projects exploring this space.\\n\\nThese particular syntheses of crypto and AI challenge the characterization (see [here](https://youtu.be/J2klGJRrjqw?t=1735), [here](https://emerging.substack.com/p/technology-governance-fit), and [here](https://stratechery.com/2021/technological-revolutions-follow-up-crypto-and-cheap-energy-the-stratechery-2-schedule/)) of crypto and AI as generally mapping on opposite ends of the spectrum of centralization vs decentralization:\\n\\n> \\\"Two of the areas of tech that people are very excited about in Silicon Valley today are crypto on the one hand and AI on the other. And even though I think these things are underdetermined, I do think these two map in a way, politically, very tightly on this centralization-decentralization thing. **Crypto is decentralizing, AI is centralizing**.

Network, Storage) + Telecoms\\\" isn't meant to represent a \\\"primitive\\\", so much as it's meant to represent the material infrastructure (atoms) that facilitates modern communication (bits). The emphasis on this infrastructure being a \\\"Distributed/Decentralized/Mesh\\\" infrastructure is because the adoption of Computational Market Democracy (CMD) necessitates non-centralized architectures for the simple reason that no concentrated (monopolistic, oligopolistic) group of private interests (companies) could ever be fully entrusted with facilitating the \\\\[digital\\\\] representation of the body politic. The potential conflicts of interest write themselves. Imagine in the year 2040 that the facilitation of the [electronic vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_voting_in_Estonia) for America's Presidential election was contracted to AWS and that the vote was between two candidates with vastly differing views on regulating Amazon — *even with cryptographic guarantees*, could the American public ever fully trust AWS to facilitate this service?\\n\\nAs Mike Summers outlines in [Online Voting Isn’t as Flawed as You Think—Just Ask Estonia](https://spectrum.ieee.org/online-voting-isnt-as-flawed-as-you-thinkjust-ask-estonia), while you'd only \\\"no more than US $200 for mixing and decrypting votes within an hour of the close of polls\\\" running on the \\\"the equivalent of 40 Amazon Web Services' m4.10xlarge virtual servers to run a U.S. presidential election\\\", even \\\"assuming a 100% turnout of every U.S. citizen of voting age\\\", \\\"civic leaders will probably be reticent to jump straight into using cloud computing for online voting\\\" and it would be more likely that \\\"the jurisdictions in each state, and in some instances individual counties, would want to purchase their own servers and infrastructure for online voting\\\".\\n\\nA discussion around whether even the State or, more precisely, particular governments ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)): \\\"*The state is the organization while the government is the particular group of people, the administrative bureaucracy that controls the state apparatus at a given time*\\\") can be entrusted with the function of facilitation is a logical extension of my hypothetical AWS example. Imagine that the US had an online referendum in 2040 on whether the country should allow \\\"the jurisdictions in each state\\\" to host the computing infrastructure for online voting versus a public blockchain on a decentralized mesh network — could this referendum be facilitated by the \\\"jurisdictions in each state\\\" which themselves are the subject of the referendum? To quote McLuhan, \\\"... it is ridiculous to talk of 'what the public wants' played over its own nerves\\\" — the imperative for decentralized communication networks for facilitating democratic processes is self-evident.\\n\\nBy now it should be clear that bottleneck in the blueprint for CMD is the problem of socially legitimizing the establishment of \\\"interoperability with interfaces for markets & governance\\\" as it pertains to existing State institutions (and that, paradoxically, the process of legitimatizing CMD requires facilitation by those very institutions that CMD seeks to disrupt and obviate). However, outside of State institutions, the existence of interfaces with markets and governance that interoperate with digital agents *already exists*. With respect to traditional public equity markets, the combination of [API-first brokerages](https://alpaca.markets/docs/) and [automated serverless deployment via cloud compute services](https://www.serverless.com/blog/cron-jobs-on-aws) *already* enables anybody with Internet access and knowledge to provision \\\"digital agents\\\" to allocate their capital across markets. With respect to crypto markets, tools like [Furucombo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HEudgDEVWs) and [Gelato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQGRIT8aV5c) are introducing low code abstraction solutions to the already existing abstraction layers of [yield aggregators](https://defiprime.com/yield-aggregators), [DEX aggregators](https://thedefiant.io/dex-aggregators-the-search-engines-of-defi-trading/) (wen DEX aggregator-aggregator??), and [crypto indices](https://www.indexcoop.com/#Producs) — digital agents can be (i.e., they already are) natively integrated into these interfaces because of the open nature of decentralized blockchains. With respect to crypto-native governance within protocols and DAOs, I'd imagine that delegation, voting, proposals, etc. is already possible (though I have yet to see examples at this stage of ecosystem development).\\n\\nThese were developments that would have been impossible for Rousseau to foresee when he wrote \\\"It is unimaginable that the people should remain continually assembled to devote their time to public affairs ...\\\" in 1762, a time at which \\\\~60% of France's labor force was still working in agriculture:\\n\\n![from Our World in Data](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LnzAJBTGRq5uRPxpp1PAX.png?height=690&width=852)\\n\\nWould the Rousseau of 2021 rethink his position about the amount of time the people have to devote to public affairs after discovering less than 3% of his countrymen are engaged in working the land?

CMD's legitimacy can only be established within the broader, public sphere as better formed articulations of the idea take shape and disseminate. Therefore, the remainder of this section will be to provide a sample of existing articulations of how CMD *could* manifest.\\n\\n**Existing (NOW OR SOON: 1 to 10 years) → Intelligent NFTs**\\n\\nfrom [Altered State Machine is Enabling AI Ownership via NFTs, Hereditary AI and Minting Brains](/Altered-State-Machine-is-Enabling-AI-Ownership-via-NFTs-Hereditary-AI-and-Minting-Brains-4c1889e12fe347fc998b59da0c5ef099) ([Altered State Machine](https://www.alteredstatemachine.xyz/)):\\n\\n> *\\\\[02:24\\\\]* **Aaron McDonald**: Altered State Machine is two new primitives for the metaverse and the blockchain space.

But you might have someone who can represent only you if you are willing to give up the idea that that representative is a human. If that representative is a software agent, we could have a senate that has as many senators as we have citizens. And those senators are going to be able to read every bill and they're going to be able to vote on each one of them.\\n\\n> *\\\\[9:10\\\\]* **César Hidalgo**: So it would be a very simple system. Imagine a system where you log in, you create your avatar, and then you want to start training your avatar. So you can provide your avatar with your reading habits, or connect it to your social media, or you can connect it to other data, for example by taking a psychological test. And the nice thing about this is that there's no deception ... you are providing data to a system that is *designed* to be used to make political decisions on your behalf. Then you take that data and you choose a training algorithm. It'd be an open marketplace in which different people can submit different algorithms to predict how you would vote based on the data that you've provided and this system is open, so nobody controls the algorithms ... and eventually you can audit the system — you can see how your avatar is working and if you like it you can leave it on auto-pilot, if you want more control you can choose that they ask you everytime it makes a decision, or you can choose anywhere in between.\\n\\nfrom [Augmented Democracy](https://www.peopledemocracy.com/) by **César Hidalgo**:\\n\\n> **WHAT IS AUGMENTED DEMOCRACY?** Augmented Democracy (AD) is the idea of using digital twins to expand the ability of people to participate directly in a large volume of democratic decisions. A digital twin, software agent, or avatar is loosely defined as a personalized virtual representation of a human. It can be used to augment the ability of a person to make decisions by either providing information to support a decision or making decisions on behalf of that person. Many of us interact with simple versions of digital twins every day. For instance, movie and music sites, such as Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, or Spotify, have virtual representations of their users that they use to choose the next song they will listen to or watch the movies they are recommended. The idea of Augmented Democracy is the idea of empowering citizens with the ability to create personalized AI representatives to augment their ability to participate directly in many democratic decisions.\\n\\n> **HOW WOULD ONE OF THESE EXPERIMENTAL \\\"AUGMENTED DEMOCRACY SYSTEMS\\\" WORK?**\\n>\\n> What an Augmented Democracy system would need to do is predict how each of its users would vote on a bill that is being discussed in that country’s congress or parliament. These predictions would provide an estimate of the support that the bill would have received if it had voted directly by the population of users of an AD system instead of their elected representatives.\\n>\\n> To provide these predictions, an AD system would need information from both users and bills. People participating in the system would provide information on a voluntary basis and have the ability to withdraw the information at any moment. This information could include active and passive forms of data. Active data includes surveys, questionnaires, and, more importantly, the feedback that people would provide directly to its digital twin (for instance, by correcting their twin when it made the wrong prediction). Passive data would include data that users already generate for other purposes, such as their online reading habits (e.g., New York Times vs Wall Street Journal), purchasing patterns, or social media behavior.\\n>\\n> The digital twin would then combine a user’s data with information about a bill to predict how that user would vote on that bill. The algorithm used to make a prediction would be chosen by the user from an open marketplace of algorithms, and the user would be able to change it at any time. These algorithms could also make predictions on more nuanced issues, such as which specific parts of the bill the user is more inclined to agree or disagree with, or what pieces of data about a user prompted the AI to suggest a decision.\\n\\n> My recommendation for an AD system is not to design it based on the platform paradigm that dominates today’s web but instead use the protocol paradigm that dominated the early days of the web. Platforms, such as Facebook, are almost natural monopolies, whereas protocols, such as email, allow the creation of distributed systems (more similar to markets than monopolies).\\n>\\n> In a protocol-based AD system each user can store their data in their own “personal data store,” or “data pod” (like the pods proposed by Tim Berners Lee in his Solid Project). The data can be in any of the many cloud providers of such a service or in a home computer. This is similar to email. Unlike social media, email services are provided by a large number of universities, companies, and other organizations. In a platform world (e.g., Facebook), some people have control over the entire platform. In a protocol system, like email, nobody has access to all of the email servers. It is a deeply fragmented and federated system by default.\\n>\\n> The algorithms used to make predictions are also distributed and not unique. They exist as part of a marketplace that is open for people wanting to contribute algorithms. Users can select which algorithms they allow to interact with their data, based on how accurate they think the algorithm predictions are, how much they trust the algorithm’s creators, and other criteria.\\n>\\n> These decentralized architectures can help revert the data concentration problem, by bringing questions to the data, instead of centralizing all the data in a few places. These questions are answered in a decentralized manner. And yes, this could be an application of blockchain technology (although that may also not be the only alternative).\\n>\\n> There are, of course, advantages and disadvantages of using protocols instead of platforms. The big advantage of protocols is their distributed nature. This allows protocol-based systems to avoid centralization of data and mitigates many of the privacy and monopoly concerns that are natural in platforms. The disadvantage is that, because of their decentralized nature, protocols are much more difficult to update and improve than platforms.\\n\\n> As I explain in my TED talk, the level of participation in democracy is relatively low, even though the number of participatory instances is relatively small. If we were to expand democracy to more instances of participation (like participatory budgets or having direct democracy for parliamentary decisions), the empirical data suggests that the participation of people would be minimal and decrease with additional instances. So the technical problem of direct democracy is not one of limited communication but one of the limited time and cognitive bandwidth of people. To participate in hundreds of decisions, we don’t need additional communication technologies but technologies that augment the number of different things a person can pay attention to.\\n\\n**Sci-fi (LONG TERM: 100 to 1,000 years) → Metacortex**\\n\\nfrom *[Accelerando](/Accelerando-ed6a8677ec204bb787304dbdc10cd9a6)* (2005) by Charles Stross:\\n\\n> The metacortex – a distributed cloud of software agents that surrounds him in netspace, borrowing CPU cycles from convenient processors (such as his robot pet) – is as much a part of Manfred as the society of mind that occupies his skull; his thoughts migrate into it, spawning new agents to research new experiences, and at night, they return to roost and share their knowledge.\\n\\n> \\\"The president of agalmic.holdings.root.184.97.AB5 is agalmic.holdings.root.184.97.201. The secretary is agalmic.holdings.root.184.D5, and the chair is agalmic.holdings.root.184.E8.FF. All the shares are owned by those companies in equal measure, and I can tell you that their regulations are written in Python. Have a nice day, now!\\\"\\n>\\n> He thumps the bedside phone control and sits up, yawning, then pushes the do-not-disturb button before it can interrupt again. After a moment he stands up and stretches, then heads to the bathroom to brush his teeth, comb his hair, and figure out where the lawsuit originated and how a human being managed to get far enough through his web of robot companies to bug him.\\n\\n> Radical new economic theories are focusing around bandwidth, speed-of-light transmission time, and the implications of CETI, communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. Cosmologists and quants collaborate on bizarre relativistically telescoped financial instruments. Space (which lets you store information) and structure (which lets you process it) acquire value while dumb mass – like gold – loses it. The degenerate cores of the traditional stock markets are in free fall, the old smokestack microprocessor and biotech/nanotech industries crumbling before the onslaught of matter replicators and self-modifying ideas. The inheritors look set to be a new wave of barbarian communicators, who mortgage their future for a millennium against the chance of a gift from a visiting alien intelligence. Microsoft, once the US Steel of the silicon age, quietly fades into liquidation.\\n\\n> About ten billion humans are alive in the solar system, each mind surrounded by an exocortex of distributed agents, threads of personality spun right out of their heads to run on the clouds of utility fog – infinitely flexible computing resources as thin as aerogel – in which they live. The foggy depths are alive with high-bandwidth sparkles; most of Earth's biosphere has been wrapped in cotton wool and preserved for future examination. For every living human, a thousand million software agents carry information into the farthest corners of the consciousness address space.\\n\\n> The pre-election campaign takes approximately three minutes and consumes more bandwidth than the sum of all terrestrial communications channels from prehistory to 2008. Approximately six million ghosts of Amber, individually tailored to fit the profile of the targeted audience, fork across the dark fiber meshwork underpinning of the lily-pad colonies, then out through ultrawideband mesh networks, instantiated in implants and floating dust motes to buttonhole the voters. Many of them fail to reach their audience, and many more hold fruitless discussions; about six actually decide they've diverged so far from their original that they constitute separate people and register for independent citizenship, two defect to the other side, and one elopes with a swarm of highly empathic modified African honeybees.\\n\\nMay you live in interesting
