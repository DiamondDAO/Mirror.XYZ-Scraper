"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I want to be let alone. Nobody has any right--except children, perhaps--and even then, it seems to me--or it did seem--\\\" She felt that her speech was voicing the incoherency of her thoughts, and stopped abruptly.\\n\\n\\\"The trouble is,\\\" sighed the Doctor, grasping her meaning intuitively, \\\"that youth is given up to illusions.  It seems to be a provision of Nature; a decoy to secure mothers for the race.  And Nature takes no account of moral consequences, of arbitrary conditions which we create, and which we feel obliged to maintain at any cost.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" she said.  \\\"The years that are gone seem like dreams--if one might go on sleeping and dreaming--but to wake up and find--oh! well! perhaps it is better to wake up after all, even to suffer, rather than to remain a dupe to illusions all one's life.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It seems to me, my dear child,\\\" said the Doctor at parting, holding her hand, \\\"you seem to me to be in trouble.  I am not going to ask for your confidence.  I will only say that if ever you feel moved to give it to me, perhaps I might help you.  I know I would understand, And I tell you there are not many who would--not many, my dear.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Some way I don't feel moved to speak of things that trouble me.  Don't think I am ungrateful or that I don't appreciate your sympathy.  There are periods of despondency and suffering which take possession of me.  But I don't want anything but my own way. That is wanting a good deal, of course, when you have to trample upon the lives, the hearts, the prejudices of others--but no matter-still, I shouldn't want to trample upon the little lives. Oh!  I don't know what I'm saying, Doctor.  Good night.  Don't blame me for anything.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I will blame you if you don't come and see me soon. We will talk of things you never have dreamt of talking about before.  It will do us both good.  I don't want you to blame yourself, whatever comes.  Good night, my child.\\\"\\n\\nShe let herself in at the gate, but instead of entering she sat upon the step of the porch.  The night was quiet and soothing. All the tearing emotion of the last few hours seemed to fall away from her like a somber, uncomfortable garment, which she had but to loosen to be rid of. She went back to that hour before Adele had sent for her; and her senses kindled afresh in thinking of Robert's words, the pressure of his arms, and the feeling of his lips upon her own.  She could picture at that moment no greater bliss on earth than possession of the beloved one.  His expression of love had already given him to her in part.  When she thought that he was there at hand, waiting for her, she grew numb with the intoxication of expectancy.  It was so late; he would be asleep perhaps.  She would awaken him with a kiss.  She hoped he would be asleep that she might arouse him with her caresses.\\n\\nStill, she remembered Adele's voice whispering, \\\"Think of the children; think of them.\\\" She meant to think of them; that determination had driven into her soul like a death wound--but not to-night.  To-morrow would be time to think of everything.\\n\\nRobert was not waiting for her in the little parlor.  He was nowhere at hand.  The house was empty.  But he had scrawled on a piece of paper that lay in the lamplight:\\n\\n\\\"I love you.  Good-by--because I love you.\\\"\\n\\nEdna grew faint when she read the words.  She went and sat on the sofa.  Then she stretched herself out there, never uttering a sound.  She did not sleep.  She did not go to bed.  The lamp sputtered and went out.  She was still awake in the morning, when Celestine unlocked the kitchen door and came in to light the fire.\\n\\nXXXIX\\n\\nVictor, with hammer and nails and scraps of scantling, was patching a corner of one of the galleries.  Mariequita sat near by, dangling her legs, watching him work, and handing him nails from the tool-box.  The sun was beating down upon them.  The girl had covered her head with her apron folded into a square pad.  They had been talking for an hour or more.  She was never tired of hearing Victor describe the dinner at Mrs. Pontellier's.  He exaggerated every detail, making it appear a veritable Lucullean feast.  The flowers were in tubs, he said.  The champagne was quaffed from huge golden goblets.  Venus rising from the foam could have presented no more entrancing a spectacle than Mrs. Pontellier, blazing with beauty and diamonds at the head of the board, while the other women were all of them youthful houris, possessed of incomparable charms. She got it into her head that Victor was in love with Mrs. Pontellier, and he gave her evasive answers, framed so as to confirm her belief.  She grew sullen and cried a little, threatening to go off and leave him to his fine ladies.  There were a dozen men crazy about her at the Cheniere; and since it was the fashion to be in love with married people, why, she could run away any time she liked to New Orleans with Celina's husband.\\n\\nCelina's husband was a fool, a coward, and a pig, and to prove it to her, Victor intended to hammer his head into a jelly the next time he encountered him.  This assurance was very consoling to Mariequita.  She dried her eyes, and grew cheerful at the prospect.\\n\\nThey were still talking of the dinner and the allurements of city life when Mrs. Pontellier herself slipped around the corner of the house. The two youngsters stayed dumb with amazement before what they considered to be an apparition.  But it was really she in flesh and blood, looking tired and a little travel-stained.\\n\\n\\\"I walked up from the wharf\\\", she said, \\\"and heard the hammering. I supposed it was you, mending the porch.  It's a good thing. I was always tripping over those loose planks last summer. How dreary and deserted everything looks!\\\"\\n\\nIt took Victor some little time to comprehend that she had come in Beaudelet's lugger, that she had come alone, and for no purpose but to rest.\\n\\n\\\"There's nothing fixed up yet, you see.  I'll give you my room; it's the only place.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Any corner will do,\\\" she assured him.\\n\\n\\\"And if you can stand Philomel's cooking,\\\" he went on, \\\"though I might try to get her mother while you are here.  Do you think she would come?\\\" turning to Mariequita.\\n\\nMariequita thought that perhaps Philomel's mother might come for a few days, and money enough.\\n\\nBeholding Mrs. Pontellier make her appearance, the girl had at once suspected a lovers' rendezvous.  But Victor's astonishment was so genuine, and Mrs. Pontellier's indifference so apparent, that the disturbing notion did not lodge long in her brain.  She contemplated with the greatest interest this woman who gave the most sumptuous dinners in America, and who had all the men in New Orleans at her feet.\\n\\n\\\"What time will you have dinner?\\\" asked Edna.  \\\"I'm very hungry; but don't get anything extra.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll have it ready in little or no time,\\\" he said, bustling and packing away his tools.  \\\"You may go to my room to brush up and rest yourself.  Mariequita will show you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thank you\\\", said Edna.  \\\"But, do you know, I have a notion to go down to the beach and take a good wash and even a little swim, before dinner?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The water is too cold!\\\" they both exclaimed.  \\\"Don't think of it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I might go down and try--dip my toes in.  Why, it seems to me the sun is hot enough to have warmed the very depths of the ocean. Could you get me a couple of towels?  I'd better go right away, so as to be back in time.  It would be a little too chilly if I waited till this afternoon.\\\"\\n\\nMariequita ran over to Victor's room, and returned with some towels, which she gave to Edna.\\n\\n\\\"I hope you have fish for dinner,\\\" said Edna, as she started to walk away; \\\"but don't do anything extra if you haven't.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Run and find Philomel's mother,\\\" Victor instructed the girl. \\\"I'll go to the kitchen and see what I can do.  By Gimminy! Women have no consideration! She might have sent me word.\\\"\\n\\nEdna walked on down to the beach rather mechanically, not noticing anything special except that the sun was hot.  She was not dwelling upon any particular train of thought.  She had done all the thinking which was necessary after Robert went away, when she lay awake upon the sofa till morning.\\n\\nShe had said over and over to herself: \\\"To-day it is Arobin; to-morrow it will be some one else.  It makes no difference to me, it doesn't matter about Leonce Pontellier--but Raoul and Etienne!\\\" She understood now clearly what she had meant long ago when she said to Adele Ratignolle that she would give up the unessential, but she would never sacrifice herself for her children.\\n\\nDespondency had come upon her there in the wakeful night, and had never lifted.  There was no one thing in the world that she desired.  There was no human being whom she wanted near her except Robert; and she even realized that the day would come when he, too, and the thought of him would melt out of her existence, leaving her alone.  The children appeared before her like antagonists who had overcome her; who had overpowered and sought to drag her into the soul's slavery for the rest of her days.  But she knew a way to elude them.  She was not thinking of these things when she walked down to the beach.\\n\\nThe water of the Gulf stretched out before her, gleaming with the million lights of the sun.  The voice of the sea is seductive, never ceasing, whispering, clamoring, murmuring, inviting the soul to wander in abysses of solitude.  All along the white beach, up and down, there was no living thing in sight.  A bird with a broken wing was beating the air above, reeling, fluttering, circling disabled down, down to the water.\\n\\nEdna had found her old bathing suit still hanging, faded, upon its accustomed peg.\\n\\nShe put it on, leaving her clothing in the bath-house.  But when she was there beside the sea, absolutely alone, she cast the unpleasant, pricking garments from her, and for the first time in her life she stood naked in the open air, at the mercy of the sun, the breeze that beat upon her, and the waves that invited her.\\n\\nHow strange and awful it seemed to stand naked under the sky! how delicious!  She felt like some new-born creature, opening its eyes in a familiar world that it had never known.\\n\\nThe foamy wavelets curled up to her white feet, and coiled like serpents about her ankles.  She walked out.  The water was chill, but she walked on.  The water was deep, but she lifted her white body and reached out with a long, sweeping stroke.  The touch of the sea is sensuous, enfolding the body in its soft, close embrace.\\n\\nShe went on and on.  She remembered the night she swam far out, and recalled the terror that seized her at the fear of being unable to regain the shore.  She did not look back now, but went on and on, thinking of the blue-grass meadow that she had traversed when a little child, believing that it had no beginning and no end.\\n\\nHer arms and legs were growing tired.\\n\\nShe thought of Leonce and the children.  They were a part of her life.  But they need not have thought that they could possess her, body and soul.  How Mademoiselle Reisz would have laughed, perhaps sneered, if she knew!  \\\"And you call yourself an artist! What pretensions, Madame!  The artist must possess the courageous soul that dares and defies.\\\"\\n\\nExhaustion was pressing upon and overpowering her.\\n\\n\\\"Good-by--because I love you.\\\" He did not know; he did not understand.  He would never understand.  Perhaps Doctor Mandelet would have understood if she had seen him--but it was too late; the shore was far behind her, and her strength was gone.\\n\\nShe looked into the distance, and the old terror flamed up for an instant, then sank again.  Edna heard her father's voice and her sister Margaret's.  She heard the barking of an old dog that was chained to the sycamore tree.  The spurs of the cavalry officer clanged as he walked across the porch.  There was the hum of bees, and the musky odor of pinks filled the air.\\n\\nBeyond the Bayou\\n\\nThe bayou curved like a crescent around the point of land on which La Folle's cabin stood.  Between the stream and the hut lay a big abandoned field, where cattle were pastured when the bayou supplied them with water enough.  Through the woods that spread back into unknown regions the woman had drawn an imaginary line, and past this circle she never stepped.  This was the form of her only mania.\\n\\nShe was now a large, gaunt black woman, past thirty-five.  Her real name was Jacqueline, but every one on the plantation called her La Folle, because in childhood she had been frightened literally \\\"out of her senses,\\\" and had never wholly regained them.\\n\\nIt was when there had been skirmishing and sharpshooting all day in the woods.  Evening was near when P'tit Maitre, black with powder and crimson with blood, had staggered into the cabin of Jacqueline's mother, his pursuers close at his heels.  The sight had stunned her childish reason.\\n\\nShe dwelt alone in her solitary cabin, for the rest of the quarters had long since been removed beyond her sight and knowledge.  She had more physical strength than most men, and made her patch of cotton and corn and tobacco like the best of them. But of the world beyond the bayou she had long known nothing, save what her morbid fancy conceived.\\n\\nPeople at Bellissime had grown used to her and her way, and they thought nothing of it.  Even when \\\"Old Mis'\\\" died, they did not wonder that La Folle had not crossed the bayou, but had stood upon her side of it, wailing and lamenting.\\n\\nP'tit Maitre was now the owner of Bellissime.  He was a middle-aged man, with a family of beautiful daughters about him, and a little son whom La Folle loved as if he had been her own. She called him Cheri, and so did every one else because she did.\\n\\nNone of the girls had ever been to her what Cheri was.  They had each and all loved to be with her, and to listen to her wondrous stories of things that always happened \\\"yonda, beyon' de bayou.\\\"\\n\\nBut none of them had stroked her black hand quite as Cheri did, nor rested their heads against her knee so confidingly, nor fallen asleep in her arms as he used to do. For Cheri hardly did such things now, since he had become the proud possessor of a gun, and had had his black curls cut off.\\n\\nThat summer--the summer Cheri gave La Folle two black curls tied with a knot of red ribbon--the water ran so low in the bayou that even the little children at Bellissime were able to cross it on foot, and the cattle were sent to pasture down by the river.  La Folle was sorry when they were gone, for she loved these dumb companions well, and liked to feel that they were there, and to hear them browsing by night up to her own enclosure.\\n\\nIt was Saturday afternoon, when the fields were deserted.  The men had flocked to a neighboring village to do their week's trading, and the women were occupied with household affairs,--La Folle as well as the others.  It was then she mended and washed her handful of clothes, scoured her house, and did her baking.\\n\\nIn this last employment she never forgot Cheri.  To-day she had fashioned croquignoles of the most fantastic and alluring shapes for him.  So when she saw the boy come trudging across the old field with his gleaming little new rifle on his shoulder, she called out gayly to him, \\\"Cheri!  Cheri!\\\"\\n\\nBut Cheri did not need the summons, for he was coming straight to her.  His pockets all bulged out with almonds and raisins and an orange that he had secured for her from the very fine dinner which had been given that day up at his father's house.\\n\\nHe was a sunny-faced youngster of ten.  When he had emptied his pockets, La Folle patted his round red cheek, wiped his soiled hands on her apron, and smoothed his hair.  Then she watched him as, with his cakes in his hand, he crossed her strip of cotton back of the cabin, and disappeared into the wood.\\n\\nHe had boasted of the things he was going to do with his gun out there.\\n\\n\\\"You think they got plenty deer in the wood, La Folle?\\\" he had inquired, with the calculating air of an experienced hunter.\\n\\n\\\"Non, non!\\\" the woman laughed.  \\\"Don't you look fo' no deer, Cheri. Dat's too big.  But you bring La Folle one good fat squirrel fo' her dinner to-morrow, an' she goin' be satisfi'.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"One squirrel ain't a bite.  I'll bring you mo' 'an one, La Folle,\\\" he had boasted pompously as he went away.\\n\\nWhen the woman, an hour later, heard the report of the boy's rifle close to the wood's edge, she would have thought nothing of it if a sharp cry of distress had not followed the sound.\\n\\nShe withdrew her arms from the tub of suds in which they had been plunged, dried them upon her apron, and as quickly as her trembling limbs would bear her, hurried to the spot whence the ominous report had come.\\n\\nIt was as she feared.  There she found Cheri stretched upon the ground, with his rifle beside him.  He moaned piteously:-- \\\"I'm dead, La Folle!  I'm dead!  I'm gone!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Non, non!\\\" she exclaimed resolutely, as she knelt beside him.  \\\"Put you' arm 'roun' La Folle's nake, Cheri.  Dat's nuttin'; dat goin' be nuttin'.\\\" She lifted him in her powerful arms.\\n\\nCheri had carried his gun muzzle-downward.  He had stumbled,--he did not know how.  He only knew that he had a ball lodged somewhere in his leg, and he thought that his end was at hand. Now, with his head upon the woman's shoulder, he moaned and wept with pain and fright.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, La Folle!  La Folle!  it hurt so bad! I can' stan' it, La Folle!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't cry, mon bebe, mon bebe, mon Cheri!\\\" the woman spoke soothingly as she covered the ground with long strides. \\\"La Folle goin' mine you; Doctor Bonfils goin' come make mon Cheri well agin.\\\"\\n\\nShe had reached the abandoned field.  As she crossed it with her precious burden, she looked constantly and restlessly from side to side.  A terrible fear was upon her, --the fear of the world beyond the bayou, the morbid and insane dread she had been under since childhood.\",\"timestamp\":1639989037,\"title\":\"I'm not going to be forced into doing things.
