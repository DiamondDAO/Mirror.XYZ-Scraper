"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"This article is a step-by-step instruction written for Metaani holders who are new to VRoidHub.\\n\\n**What is VRoidHub?** VRoidHub is a platform that enables the use of various VR/AR services by registering 3D model avatars in VRM format. (This article is an explanation of how to register, so I will not go into details. Please refer to the [link](https://vroid.pixiv.help/hc/en-us/articles/360011648414-What-is-VRoid-Hub-) for more details.)\\n\\n## 4 Steps for registering a Metaani to VRoidHub\\n\\nThere are four major steps. If you want to refer only to the individual steps, please jump directly to that part.\\n\\n* Get your Metaani VRM file\\n* Create a VRoidHub account\\n* Change the language settings\\n* Register your Metaani avatar\\n\\n## Get your Metaani VRM file\\n\\nThe first step is to get the VRM file for your Metaani avatar. If you have not yet done so, please login to the [Conata World](https://conata.world/metaani/viewer) with your registered wallet to obtain the VRM file.\\n\\nDisplay the Metaani in MetaaniGEN Viewer and click the \\\"downloadAvatar\\\" button in the center-right corner to start download. It may take some time for the download to start, so please wait for it once you click on it.\\n\\n## Create a VRoidHub account\\n\\n**1: Open [VRoidHub Website](https://hub.vroid.com/)** and use your browser to translate the contents into English. (There is no language switch on the VRoidHub website, but later you can set language configuration in your account setting.)\\n\\n**2: Click the \\\"Log in with your pixiv ID\\\\*\\\" button** in the upper right corner.\\n\\\\*Since VRoidHub is operated by pixiv Inc., you need to create a pixiv ID when you use VRoidHub.\\n\\n**3: Choose “create an account”**\\nReview the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy and click \\\"Create an account\\\" button at the bottom.\\n\\n![\\\"Log in with your pixiv ID\\\" button.

If you register via SNS, pixiv will request access approval, so you will need to approve it with your SNS account.\\n\\nEnter your email address and password in the fields and click the \\\"to the next\\\" button.\\n\\n![Create an account image by VRoidHub](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bs9zLRkx4uAS0SYN7q-Zr.png?height=2400&width=6483)\\n\\n**5: Enter additional information**\\nEnter the name you wish to display as your account name in the Nickname field. (Ex: SoratabiT). The Gender and Birthday fields are optional, so you can leave them blank.\\n\\nCheck in the last two checkboxes. The first box confirms that you are not a bot. The second box is for agreeing to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy as indicated.\\n\\nThen, click on the blue \\\"Create an account\\\" button to complete your registration.\\nWhen the registration is complete, the screen will automatically switch to the home screen. The details can be viewed from \\\"Configuration\\\" in the upper right corner drop-down.\\n\\n![Create an account image by VRoidHub](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SOYsW_TOiMA6I14DwZ4DZ.png?height=2937&width=6483)\\n\\n## Change the language settings\\n\\nClick \\\"Configuration\\\" in the drop-down to open the account details screen.In the \\\"User Setting\\\" section, change the \\\"Language setting\\\" from Japanese to English, and click \\\"Save\\\". If the screen goes blank at this point, please reload your browser.\\n\\nNow, the language setting of the entire VRoidHub has been changed to English.\\n\\n![Account configuration image by VRoidHub](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7ej5nl4pLXnf_zoC0CLV0.png?height=3294&width=6483)\\n\\n## Register your Metaani avatar\\n\\n**1: Click \\\"Submit character\\\"** in the upper right corner while you are logged in.\\nNote: You cannot submit your avatar from a smartphone; you need to use a PC.\\n\\n**2: Enter a display name for your avatar and insert a VRM file** in the \\\"Drag & drop a VRM file\\\" field. Then, click the \\\"Upload\\\" button.\\n\\nThe VR model registration process will start, and as soon as the registration is complete, you will be switched to the screen with the avatar displayed.\\n\\n![\\\"Submit character\\\" button image by VRoidHub](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KumqzO553j10n8d3q4R0J.png?height=412&width=6483)\\n\\n![Submit a character image by VRoidHub](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/StE5JAa1u73z8q7tA49sw.png?height=775&width=1887)\\n\\n**3: Configure your avatar settings**\\nThis is where you can set the public/private disclosure range settings, thumbnails, and other motion settings.\\n\\n**As a Metaani holder, the** **disclosure range** **setting is probably the most important point to pay attention to.** In the right section, you see disclosure range settings, saying \\\"Can you use this model?\\\". What this means is that it asks if other users can use your avatar or not.\\n\\nIf you do not want to allow other users to use your Metaani registered, set \\\"NO\\\" as Private. If you want to allow other users to use it, set \\\"YES\\\" as Public.\\n\\nClick on the \\\"Edit condition of use\\\" button to display the detailed setting screen and select YES or NO for each item. (Below screenshot shows Private setting.)\\nClick the \\\"Edit\\\" button to confirm the changes.\\n\\n![Submit a character setting image by VRoidHub](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JV-INUILmG17paAntMFha.png?height=3281&width=6483)\\n\\n![Conditions of use setting image by VRoidHub](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9GMdcfRLYIp8jPu_ormYE.png?height=869&width=1906)\\n\\n**4: Save all the settings**\\nClick on the \\\"Save Privately\\\" button in the bottom right to save all the settings.\\n\\nFor more information about thumbnails and motion settings, please refer to [this instruction page](https://vroid.pixiv.help/hc/en-us/articles/4404654268953-How-can-I-post-a-model-). Also, since Metaani does not have face-parts, the face motion settings will not be reflected. Note: The above link explains avatar registration in the public settings, so please keep in mind that some of the instructions may differ from this article.\\n\\n**5: Check your settings** If you have configured your setting as Private, \\\"Private\\\" icon will be shown next to your avatar name and in the thumbnail box.\\n\\nYou can register multiple avatars by following the same steps above. They will be displayed in \\\"Your characters\\\" in the upper right drop-down menu.\\nNote: Settings must be configured for each avatar.\\n\\n**Congratulations! You are ready to play with your Metaani via VRoidHub.**\\n\\n![Avatar view image by VRoidHub](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nP-UMST6aI6PYZa6K5N7j.png?height=3292&width=6483)\\n\\n## What's Next?\\n\\nFrom [VRoidHub apps page](https://hub.vroid.com/apps), you can find apps and services that allow you to play with your avatars.\\n\\nYou can play on a variety of platforms such as metaverse, sandbox games, dance apps, camera apps, and more!\\n\\nI have also been posting on Twitter about how I have been playing with these apps.
