"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I was born in the country that ceased to exist in 1991. It was called Soviet Union. That's what my birth certificate states. It also has a hammer and sickle on it. It could make a good NFT, in a good sense.\\n\\nMy birth year 1985 was the year of perestroika. Gorbatschow initiated his social, political and economic reforms that will put a foundation to the tumultuous and irreversible changes and the end of the Soviet Union 6 years later.\\n\\nIn theory the philosophy of socialism was amazing: everyone was supposed to have an equal right to a share of a country's wealth. The means of **production, distribution and exchange were collectively owned and regulated by the community**. Sounds a bit familiar to the **web 3 philosophy**, right? I am a big fan, since it promises a better world for everyone, participation and a fair split. The question is how will the implementation look in practice once we are out of the early experimentation phase which I think is still the case?\\n\\nThe example of the Soviet Union (it´s a weird association, but I have it for some reason) was really challenging and did not work out as we all know since it's not easy to organise a **population of 280+ million people.** Especially if there are **no computers, blockchain, smart contracts, proper community management tools** etc. And also taking into account the human nature of our species, that is not 0% free of voracity, self interest and unjust enrichment attempts. Now with **over 4.6 billion people online** and with tech in place we will see how it works out.\\n\\nAt the end of the day there are always **elites that have privileged access to information and resources** - in the Soviet Union those were members of the communist party and the friends of the government**. In crypto you have to belong to the inner circles** ideally somewhere in California or New York  in order to know which coin to buy, when are cool NFT projects being released and what are interesting DAOs to participate in. You need **privileged information** and a decent **financial base** to start playing on the web 3 playground.\\n\\nSome price points:\\n\\n* Start playing [Axi Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/): 3 Axies (equivalent more or less to 450€)\\n* Set up an [Opensea](https://opensea.io/) account and list an NFT: 19 USDT (equivalent to 16€)\\n* [Play around with DiFi](https://www.coinbase.com/): the initial investment you might be willing to lose completely or grow to the unimaginable heights and associated gas fees (=transaction fees)\\n\\nSimilar to the Soviet Union, where the **safest way to store your money was under the mattress** (assuming the currency stored would be still in circulation), get a **cold wallet** for your crypto play budget to start. This should explain the art work of this post. :)\\n\\nReady to dive in?\",\"timestamp\":1638369881,\"title\":\"Setting the stage - parallels to the socialism\"},\"digest\":\"DdDZyyZdHJUcZGc1Hs6gHgX_3MLu258xfCjcNblIf6M\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5C29AE59Eb4F262eb5EE8326FEb4007163B0c6DC\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_t1VC03xG2ByRUghp1xxN6FUKHEkmbB6haDsZLfDB7c\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NSqRIpYeYq4fSfIGJxm8MXQpfxRcWkE43fAMWtRTL-8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ypEFpDErjzlgTZu5D99p2Mj6CVlZx8cdf6zVFwl1dB_nGyTnvBqwugLYhUjqwO69wCHJZeunyvC0QH_tfGB0tw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xffd55970827655e6e7e0f4ad8be4257bf182e5e4110eadd01405cba5227aa898527314c4e83d0f1a59512e6b8eecdc35f575b222d3ada1aa8a2966761f594d741c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_t1VC03xG2ByRUghp1xxN6FUKHEkmbB6haDsZLfDB7c\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NSqRIpYeYq4fSfIGJxm8MXQpfxRcWkE43fAMWtRTL-8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"mSMNFvInP0tcfPx_YoWSDOnPQQmkTHQufBqGE0OHyI8\"}"
