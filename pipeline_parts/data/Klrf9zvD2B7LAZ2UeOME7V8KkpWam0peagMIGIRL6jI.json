"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Overview\\n\\nWe make it easy for groups of people to ape-in together, and share ownership of NFTs. We're calling it \\\"troop\\\", which means \\\"a group of apes\\\".\\n\\nThe core mechanic is simple: start a “hunt” with a target NFT, share the link with your friends, add funds, and complete the purchase. You can think of it as a single-purpose DAO, without all the hassle of multi-sig wallets, writing smart contracts, and pricing tokens.\\n\\nWe support NFTs listed on OpenSea and private hunts.\\n\\nYou can try it out at [troop.gg](http://troop.gg). We really hope you like it!\\n\\n## The problem\\n\\nSome people like to talk about sports. Others about stocks. Other about politics. We like to talk about NFTs. Yes, there’s money involved — but it’s also just fun. It feels like a [massive multiplayer game across the Internet](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game).\\n\\nUnfortunately, the dynamics of the market keep a lot of people from participating.\\n\\nNFTs follow a pretty dramatic power-law distribution. Most NFTs are not worth anything, while the top 0.1% get all the attention, volume, and liquidity. As a result, the top NFTs can soar in price and quickly become inaccessible. Look at “blue chip” NFTs like Cryptopunks, Bored Apes, Autoglyphs, or even Loot and CrypToadz. They all cost upwards of $40k, with Autoglyphs’ floor hovering around $1.3M+.\\n\\nBecause of this, many people are staying on the sidelines. Some want exposure to the asset class, but they don’t feel comfortable spending $50k+ on top NFTs. Some have the capital, but want to diversify their investment across many NFTs, not just one or two. And some don’t want to risk buying a new, cheaper NFT that is not proven yet.\\n\\nAnd this trend is only going to continue: as more institutions and DAOs continue to buy NFTs, the prices of top NFTs will become more unreasonably expensive for individuals. Even for individuals with a lot of money.\\n\\nWith that context in mind, we noticed a nascent behavior start to emerge: buying NFTs with friends. The idea is simple: a group of friends pitch in and become fractional owners of an NFT they like.\\n\\nBut the existing solutions require too much faith and/or effort from people. You might need to trust one of your friends with a substantial amount of money. You might need to set up a multi-sig wallet. You might need to use complex software designed for full-fledged DAOs.\\n\\nGiven that, we saw an opportunity to build something useful for the community (and ourselves): an easy way to buy NFTs as a group. And so Troop was born.\\n\\n## Instructions\\n\\nCheck out this post for instructions on every action you can take in troop, from starting a hunt, to joining, to selling your tokens:\\n\\n[https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/edit/iYIMMEIxJRbLhamFxsgCjCV_U77XVRiPg9RGqoINO4o](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/edit/iYIMMEIxJRbLhamFxsgCjCV_U77XVRiPg9RGqoINO4o)\\n\\n## FAQs\\n\\n### What fees do you charge?\\n\\nZero — we currently don't charge any fees. As we continue to make Troop more useful and reliable, we may introduce a small fee in the future to help fund product development.\\n\\n### Is this like PartyBid?\\n\\nNo, the use case is different. We are huge fans of PartyBid and how they have made it possible for groups of hundreds of contributors to beat out even the largest whale at public auctions. However, PartyBid's emphasis on large, public, on-chain auctions didn't address our needs around buying NFTs on OpenSea with our friends. That is what Troop aims to address.\\n\\n### Is this safe?\\n\\nYes. During the hunt, we rely on smart contracts to secure your funds and ensure they can only be used to acquire your target NFT or be reclaimed by the original contributor. For fractionalization, we've partnered with [Fractional](https://fractional.art/) and are leveraging their battle-tested protocol. Check out our [Under the hood](https://www.notion.so/Welcome-to-Troop-a0a81d8a6be84e5bb4dfd5b5846e8a95) section to learn more about the system.\\n\\n## Under the hood\\n\\nTroop, at its core, is pretty simple. Each hunt is a standalone smart contract that tracks user contributions. Once the necessary funds have been raised, a transaction is required to swap the funds for the NFT (the \\\"Complete Purchase\\\" step). Any user can call into the contract to access the combined contributions, but the transaction is only valid if, by the end, the smart contract is the owner of the target NFT. We've written a smart contract helper for OpenSea and a helper for the seller to manually redeem the NFT. In the future, we plan to support every prominent on-chain marketplace.\\n\\nOnce the smart contract has acquired the NFT, we use the [Fractional protocol](https://fractional.art/) to deposit the NFT in a token vault. For every 1 ETH spent to acquire the NFT, we issue 1000 tokens. Tokens are made available proportional to the amount of the acquisition funds you contributed. For example, if you contributed 0.25 ETH to a hunt and the entire amount was used to acquire the NFT, you'll be able to claim 250 tokens. Because the NFT can drop in price during the hunt, it's possible that the amount spent to acquire the NFT was less than the amount raised by the hunt. In that case, the earliest contributors will be awarded tokens, and those who contributed above the acquisition price will receive partially tokens and partially ETH (if some of the contribution was used) or a refund of their entire ETH contribution (if none was used). Fractional owners can vote on a buyout price and use their tokens across the defi ecosystem. To learn more about the Fractional protocol, [please visit their documentation](notion://www.notion.so/troop-xyz/TODO).\\n\\nEvery hunt has a contribution cap, currently set at the original listing price. Without a cap, the seller of the NFT would be incentivized to contribute to the hunt while increasing the price of the NFT. Allowing this would dilute other contributors. Because each hunt can acquire the NFT at the original listing price or below, early contributors are guaranteed that they won't be diluted down in ownership.\\n\\nIf two or more contributors add funds at the same time or if the last contributor adds more than necessary, it's possible for the hunt's balance to exceed the contribution cap. Funds that exceed the cap cannot be used to acquire the NFT and will be available to be reclaimed by the original contributor once the NFT has been acquired or the hunt has expired.\\n\\nEvery hunt has an expiry date, after which anyone who contributed to the hunt can reclaim their entire contribution if the NFT has yet to be acquired. This means you can contribute to large hunts without worrying how long your funds may be locked in the hunt. In the cases where the hunt expires, no token is issued and the contributions can no longer be redeemed for the NFT.\\n\\n### Emergency methods\\n\\nTroop is a beta product and hasn't yet been officially audited. Balancing security with resilience, we've added three methods to the contract during the beta period that allow our multisig to perform admin actions on the contract. With these methods, our multisig can immediately expire any hunt, issue arbitrary calls, and rescue the balance of the smart contract.\\n\\nUse of these methods will be limited to extraordinary circumstances like if a bug or unforeseen issue leaves ETH, tokens, or an NFT at risk of loss. We will make all efforts to ensure that the funds are returned to their rightful owners.\\n\\nOur multisig is two-of-three, with the three addresses belonging to hardware wallets owned by Michael Douglas, Bruno De Martino, and Gabriel Bianconi.\\n\\nOur current plan is to remove these methods after the beta period, in the next upgrade to the protocol.\\n\\n## Leaving feedback\\n\\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on Troop and your ideas of how we can improve the product!
