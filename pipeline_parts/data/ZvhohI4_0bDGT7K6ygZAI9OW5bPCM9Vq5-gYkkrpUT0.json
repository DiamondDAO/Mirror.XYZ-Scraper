"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## “Is this my job?”\\n\\nI’ve wrestled with the idea of jobs for a while. I want to spend energy on the things I’m best at, but some of those things feel undervalued. This piece is an introduction, a question, and a coagulation of big feelings that have sat with me for a loooong time.\\n\\n**Please watch before reading on:**\\n\\n[https://youtu.be/a7MiAVMkDyk](https://youtu.be/a7MiAVMkDyk)\\n\\nI have/had many jobs. I think I’ll always have many “jobs” at once according to various interests, abilities, and context.\\n\\nCreating is a job I take very seriously - despite rarely getting paid for it.  However, the process of becoming a paid artist in the music platform/social media era has always felt a bit unnatural to me.\\n\\nI shared some thoughts with my friends/collaborators in the [songcamp](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/) community that I think are relevant here:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ppuNlAxPV5vVclNxWohbg.png?height=1314&width=1354)\\n\\n*“Is this my job”* is me stepping forward to communicate feelings that have been in me and (I think) a lot of us as we begin to accept a reality where finding work that aligns with our personal strengths/passions may be the most logical, most valuable, and best compensated action one could take (both for ourselves and our communities). Use it if it helps. \\n\\n## I NEED A JOB (Music Visual)\\n\\nVarious parts of “Is this my Job” will be available for auction over the coming months. If you think I should have a job creating art, you can make that happen by purchasing a piece (or contributing towards a [partybid](https://www.partybid.app/party/0xd674Ef8bD098b7C4F791d65cc7A679f3ac5855D0)). \\n\\n***“I NEED A JOB” is now up for auction as my first NFT.***\\n\\nI started creating I NEED A JOB in 2015 and finished it in September 2021.\\n\\nIt’s tried on a lot of different outfits from then to now but I think it’s finally found colors that suit it. I’m happy to feel this idea captured in a tangible way.\\n\\n*The reserve price is **8.8 ETH**.
