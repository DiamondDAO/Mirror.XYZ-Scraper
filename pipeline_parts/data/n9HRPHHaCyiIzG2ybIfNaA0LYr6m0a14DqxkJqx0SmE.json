For decades, we’ve worked under the assumption that mass culture follows a steadily declining path toward lowest-common denominator standards, presumably because the ‘masses’ want dumb, simple pleasures and big media companies want to give the masses what they want. But in fact, the exact opposite is happening: the culture is getting more intellectually demanding, not less.”`\\n\\nWhat Johnson means is that what we consider junk food is actually making us healthier. Forms of entertainment that we thought made us dumber and ruined are lives, could be making us smarter.\\n\\nTelevision shows now have significantly more plot threads than older shows like the Sopranos.\\n\\nIn this sense, I agree with Steven Johnson. Television dramas are getting more complex, and those involved in developing these forms of entertainment have to take a higher level of care otherwise we’re not interested.\\n\\nWe can tell when we’re being sold snake oil. We want our intelligence to be respected.\\n\\n## Making The Case For Television’s Complexity\\n\\nIn Part One of the book “Everything Bad Is Good For You,” Steven Johnson introduces Television drama as the most dramatic instance of the Sleeper Curve. In this section of the book he makes a distinction between show that:\\n\\n1. Reference the bare bones situation of a sitcom\\n2. Those that demand more knowledge (Ex. Biographical information, or supplementary information)\\n\\n`“The most telling way to measure these shows’ complexity” he says “is to consider how much external information the viewer must draw upon to ‘get’ the jokes in their entirety…The jokes in “run-of-the-mill sitcoms. . . make no reference to anything outside the frame of the conversation that contains them - beyond the bare-bones situation that the sitcom itself is grounded in.”`\\n\\nI would like to make a case that the best shows are the ones with a lot of these *“in-jokes”*. These jokes aren’t always jokes per se. They don’t always make you laugh. But they do make people bigger fans of TV shows, and they do add something to our understanding of the world if we decide to watch, and rewatch them.\\n\\nI’ve followed this exercise. I watched and rewatched a lot of my favorite shows. In particular, Ozark. And I noticed something. The in-jokes in Ozark contributed to my understanding of the Bible.\\n\\nThis may seem like a farfetched statement. But in order to show you that it is true, I will first clarify the definitions that Steven Johnson brings up in his book. He says that television shows contain two types of information:\\n\\n1. **Biographical Information:** where the script and the humor of nuanced shows demand you to know basic biographical information about the characters.\\n2. **Supplementary Information:** that which is deliberately withheld from the viewer.\\n\\nHe makes a distinction about references to this kind of information, and the tradition of soap opera plotlines that extend past the frame of individual episodes.\\n\\nThere is a difference between storytelling and the references needed to tell a joke. References don’t need to be known for you to understand the story. You don’t need to get the joke to follow the story. When watching Ozark you don’t have to understand the references to the Bible to follow the story. These references are a third kind of information that Steven Johnson does not address in his book.\\n\\n## Ozark and The Holy Bible\\n\\nI agree with Johnson in the context of this supplementary information, however, I would like to make an argument for an even wider frame of reference: the importance of **tertiary information** in understanding a show’s complexity.\\n\\nIf supplementary information as he describes it (related to the Art Vandelay references in Seinfeld) are callbacks to references within the context of multiple seasons of a show; then **tertiary information** are calls to references that exist solely outside of the show. Therefore this is an “in-joke” for one type of person.\\n\\nI believe Ozark has several tertiary references to the Bible. References that readers of the Bible will recognize and appreciate when they are pointed out.  To name a few, some of those references are:\\n\\nOver the course of several blog posts and videos I will make the case that the show paves the way for new understandings of the Bible.\",\"timestamp\":1642721831,\"title\":\"Insights About The Bible From The Show Ozark Pt. 1\"},\"digest\":\"pkvPLDVTb3l9hm7Gnpf5Xbdxe0Kr9A8B6mnl9vbDd0s\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x39665aF6A74f1ca25955Ef1744fE994E598E51a9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MN-zZwRcRIlVqaZZThAHwILM0lB3vk42jkFow4E-8jw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ffYC7MaiZkfE61W5g3E7KE0ES46F9XeW2H13bm1-mC0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"adrxHQd3ueDchsA7rxGlm9Jq_mTB8WvtMvMmT_Kuf60O968FoerJy3EWklYFTyk0CU91gSLZAAA0N1QOqWOL7A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf0e9486413e75fd9dd3a242a87815f481e1d7658395060c41d6c063f8d10cf2a5f729273af75098fcbfce1d84e959454538cdb08358ee7345a035cd0ba76cba51c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MN-zZwRcRIlVqaZZThAHwILM0lB3vk42jkFow4E-8jw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ffYC7MaiZkfE61W5g3E7KE0ES46F9XeW2H13bm1-mC0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Cj05C06uH3oQoD9Y4eLXaCmIDM1SCvt0z3YNZe_1Dwc\"}"
