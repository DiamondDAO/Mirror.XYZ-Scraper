"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Hi everyone, I am a newcomer and layman in Web3.0 and this is the first article I write here.\\n\\nLet me introduce myself at first. I am a mid-forties guy and had a company for traditional business (acted as a distributor and sold a backpack brand in China) before. I put all my effort hard to promote the brand to become the top 3 selling brands in Tmall (the best online platform in China) in this category.\\n\\nWhen my business started to make profit, unfortunately, I have mistakenly not taken much are about the legal side of my business. To make it short, the brand owner got back the distributorship and drove me away.\\n\\nThe sudden change let me feel depressed, but I need to find a way to overcome the situation and quickly earn the money for my beloved family.\\n\\nSo, I have started to explore the market and accidentally get in touch with the blockchain, cryptocurrency, and then NFT and DAO and more… for last few months. This amazed me a lot as it is a decentralized world and no authority can easily manipulate (may be still not 100% perfect at this moment).\\n\\nAs I am a layman in technology, it is hard for me even to set up a Metamask wallet. So, I gradually learned more about blockchain and related knowledge through youtube and then knew more updated information through different social media, like medium, reddit, telegram, discord… I only use facebook and instagram before and all is new for me.\\n\\nThis story is not any dramatic and special but it is important to me. I recently read a book called Life3.0 from Max Tegmark, it discusses the impact to our life by Artificial Intelligence. He classifies the life into Life 1.0 (refer to biological origins), Life 2.0 (refer to cultural developments in humanity) and Life 3.0 (referring to the technological age of humans). For our virtual world, we also have web1.0, web2.0 and 3.0.\\n\\nSometimes I feel confused as the world is changing so fast, all the new idea and thought comes out aggressively and they need a new skillset to handle into it. It I stand still, I will soonly be eliminated in this competitive market. So, why not, I evolve myself from previous Me.1.0 and Me2.0 to new Me3.0.\\n\\nHow to learn? The best is practice. Writing is one of the tools to help us for organizing what you have learnt. Luckily, I found the Mirror and this platform allow me to share freely.\\n\\nI will keep my dream to build my own brand in the real world but keep my continuous learning in the web3.0.\\n\\nThis my first time to write an English article publicly, hope I can express my feelings and through clearly. Although this article is not about technology, money, blockchain, NFT, DAO. Hope you will not mind reading it.\\n\\nThank you Mirror again to provide this platform\",\"timestamp\":1634040725,\"title\":\"Life3.0, Web3.0, and so Me3.0\"},\"digest\":\"vNi2HmngsIBkpcl8t9E0qi5XW4NFXsQtZSEWT9-PDSQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5EC3C2aA7ba40ff510Df8b767D32789F1280a796\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Hr-UxGNoA0WUA2bHWft5zoGDzX83uocpoKMRNQEnE9Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FC_jODvVL8NEbpZtTbFQI8z7B0nQqmvnWsJNjk_XBts\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"u33dvGUFxVZcxjH2P0jQtqDngztMiYgarN6mNUEyZqY03y69PMVbHgKXadHInaUtvOctwppen4wL7gRECG_w5w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xfa56f66660454c7f170de96885e6a604fd1776ef85b3fe395447ad18b9b4454903f6fc77233ef96e02623baee5f4c2d6a6b1d1275824016a266687b0adc15b271c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Hr-UxGNoA0WUA2bHWft5zoGDzX83uocpoKMRNQEnE9Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FC_jODvVL8NEbpZtTbFQI8z7B0nQqmvnWsJNjk_XBts\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"vNi2HmngsIBkpcl8t9E0qi5XW4NFXsQtZSEWT9-PDSQ\"}"
