"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**This is Imperfect Information - by Joe Lallouz**, a newsletter about sociology, crypto, startups, and thinking of the world as games, to make better decisions.\\n\\nFriends -\\n\\nI’ve been toying with the idea of longer-form writing for some time, but have yet to kick it into gear. Last year marked the [bar-mitzvah](https://twitter.com/JoeLallouz/status/1466416983658967058?s=20) of my Twitter account and I had an awakening, “2022 was going to be the year I gave long-form a go”!\\n\\nImperfect Information is a concept in game theory where players do not have all information at hand to make the optimal decision in a given scenario. This concept exists all around us, in macroeconomics, it’s often referred to as “asymmetric information” and in strategy video games usually “fog of war”. Often the best and hardest strategy games ( poker or starcraft, for instance) use imperfect information mechanics and master players are some of the best decision-makers in the world.\\n\\nFor years I’ve been obsessed with the idea that most decisions in life, can be broken down just like games (check out [my Twitter thread on Startup Founders are like Starcraft](https://twitter.com/JoeLallouz/status/1107682500757897216?s=20) pros). I hope this newsletter will explore and expand on that obsession as it applies to assembling teams, building products, and investing in disruptive tech.\\n\\nIf you subscribe to my newsletter, my promise is to be authentic, share my insights, certainly hand over as much imperfect information as I can. :)\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Joe](https://twitter.com/joelallouz)\\n\",\"timestamp\":1642095256,\"title\":\"What is Imperfect Information?\"},\"digest\":\"SAhWTZUenA0OlS8ytPav9PteUop1f4fJynaLCZVfNkU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x554ee647D41fc226Ba337ca4FB4b71f7e712099b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NAi6K4EqI8fI55YrOAXqVYHLNWQck7COSw_iGzasg68\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"O3ZQVYQQtyY-EDx87aJjc-9TUhrbk-jf1z5IUkvq7m8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"56FMKI6SgP0pUbHwtXOCGL7s4_YCQzMZvBgQmA4UtTiGweLVF4dfgUUda6lsBymSc6FfMwwCDNyL5zSdGfjdlw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2e5f5cbaa7c46fb4fcd68d2c2510a9e77865a50618be0c8be1a5fccca18a5c871c063a5fe40c213fb6f7fad92f1bce35f8ccc2efaed002be8773e63cbae02b791c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NAi6K4EqI8fI55YrOAXqVYHLNWQck7COSw_iGzasg68\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"O3ZQVYQQtyY-EDx87aJjc-9TUhrbk-jf1z5IUkvq7m8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"SAhWTZUenA0OlS8ytPav9PteUop1f4fJynaLCZVfNkU\"}"
