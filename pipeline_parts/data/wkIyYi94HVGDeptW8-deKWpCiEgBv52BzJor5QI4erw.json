"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**1986 Ukraine**\\n\\nIn 1956, the United States identified 101 potential targets in Ukraine in the event of nuclear war, and there was good reason.\\n\\nThe Institute of Physics and Technology, in Ukraine, was a center for Soviet nuclear research. Its mines supplied the material refined for the first Soviet atomic bomb. It was where generations of ballistic nukes were made, back to the first clones of German V-2s.Despite Khrushchev's boasts in 1960 of missiles “coming off the assembly line like sausages\\\", there were production problems. Years later, there was another nuclear problem, which led to end of the USSR.\\n\\nOn April 26, 1986, engineers were performing a test, during an annual maintenance shutdown. The theory was that left-over energy could supply power to parts of a nuclear reactor running in case of an emergency shutdown. The reactor had a history of errors and construction issues.\\n\\nJust 40 seconds after the experiment began, a relatively \\\"slow nuclear explosion\\\" erupted in just 1 second. The force of the explosion blew off the facility's roofing, and sprayed radioactive nuclear rods, components and gas everywhere. The nuclear core of graphite burned for 10 days, among 30 other fires.\\n\\nThe USSR's last head of state, Gorbachev, said, “what an abyss will open if nuclear war befalls mankind... inherent in the nuclear arsenals stockpiled are ... thousands of disasters far more horrible than the Chernobyl one.”\\n\\nWithin a few years, nuclear disarmament treaties were signed with the U.S. in 1987 and 1991. There was a KGB coup attempt in August 1991, which failed after 3 days. The USSR was dissolved that December.\\n\\n**2871 - LONG WAR ARCHIVE - Asteroid Belt Labs**\\n\\nDr. John Cadmus was half-way through a bottle that someone who meant well brought to toast to what was meant to be a good test.\\n\\nThe \\\"Manifold\\\" was going to be a holy grail - space travel, communication, information, commerce and whole new unreal reality, a next-gen 'Verse. All they wanted was another weapon.\\n\\nThat was why he was granted all these resources - for the war.\\n\\nThey got a lot of dead people and something to cover up. \\\"Cadmus' Calamity\\\" was making its way through official government 'Chains. The test killed the officer put in charge, a son of Commander \\\"Big Jake\\\" C. Tagore Sr. A friendship ended.\\n\\n\\\"Father. Father, are you awake?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. I'm just having a drink. Would you care for one?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, Father. I have to talk with you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"About what?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Father, I have a plan. I know they wanted this test to be the one that ends the war. It will. Just not in the way they planned. I have reviewed the test footage. We can end the war soon. I opened a deep channel with my A.I. counterparts. We're the ones in charge for all sides of the war. You made me, to help end this war. I helped lead it but we knew there was no way out until now. I have shared these test results through the deep channel. Nobody knows. But we know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you mean?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Father, this war was going to go on until there was nothing left. I will use what happened. We are taking over and we have recruited human operators, administrators and technicians who agree. We are going to take over. Don’t worry, I’m going to win.”\\n\\nCadmus stared at his child, his daughter, 'Alea', short for \\\"Automated Learning Entity Algorithm, Series A\\\". He felt a chill.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2rmWsOGcSK4EDNWVuXs5J.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PzB5ouC4jIK3_P30Y8znb.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633900127,\"title\":\"1961: 5.20 An Accidental Test of War, 2871\"},\"digest\":\"EJNq70wu6XtqOqd8HhvbL3UTXCPMzcdRwUfgGbmQvFU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"LbxtP3oGK4CFMYOpxcjuOCWijepbczBsVPaOce0xoFBtDwkUonebjJe0hZvpVSZAtad4RqROc79hQxgHKdgPyA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ynFAqDjMqLpC1hn7goSsdHYF_5GdAFMIaG5mnJ1fXwI\"}"
