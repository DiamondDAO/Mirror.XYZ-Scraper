How to talk [#Metaverse](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Metaverse?src=hashtag_click) like a Pro. \\n\\nA Thread\\n\\n1/ What is Metaverse?\\n\\nThe metaverse, in general, is the digital world, where anything we can imagine can exist. Everything that we represent in the physical world can have digital mirror.\\n\\n 2/ These two different worlds can interact with each other, bringing digital assets to the physical world with the help of Augmented Reality (AR). \\n\\n3/ The metaverse consists of many parts, but here are the basic foundations:\\n\\n* The internet\\n* Open standards for media\\n* Open programming language standards\\n* eXtended Reality (XR) hardware\\n* Decentralized ledgers and smart contract platforms\\n\\nLet further talk about these topics\\n\\n4/ The internet — a decentralized network of computers which is not owned by any single entity or government, and does not require the central permission of any such entity to use.\\n\\n5/ Open standards for media — including text, images, audio, video, 3D items, 3D scenes and geometry, vectors, sequences, and procedures to generate and combine any of these things. Pixar’s USD and NVIDIA’s MDL are great steps towards interoperability for 3D applications.\\n\\n6/ Open programming language standards — for any of the above. Such standards include HTML, JavaScript, WebAssembly, WebXR, WebGPU Shader Language, etc.\\n\\n7/ eXtended Reality (XR) hardware — such as smart glasses, haptics, and omni treadmills.\\n\\n8/ Decentralized ledgers and smart contract platforms — (e.g., Blockchains) for transparent, permissionless, and censorship-resistant transactions. Examples include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Flow, and Theta, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and many others.\\n\\n9/ These form important foundations for the ownership economy that will support the metaverse and make it a viable public good.\\n\\n10/ What is Multiverse? \\n\\nAs we go from Blockchain to MultiChain, the Metaverse will evolve into Multiverse, interoperable Metaverse built on top of Multichains. Interoperable is - an ability of function with multiple blockchain.\\n\\nThank you!\\n\\nIf you enjoyed it you can check some other Threads too.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/EtherSiim/status/1447492904730116096](https://twitter.com/EtherSiim/status/1447492904730116096)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638390126,\"title\":\"How to talk #Metaverse like a Pro\"},\"digest\":\"u44WrkuJzCoRgMnNDXv2l5Hy8tMkfO4f7dH06u3nQOw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6b3791AD79aCc2F412b25De89F00cfDa594f2625\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"B4nHyiFi9PhmMLCR5sUQF9_WDideZ9jEXb4nVBuh5Bo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1RJ68OZFPDOvDVdeek1AWV4QOoLPMdVzaCxfskqaTvg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"gwk6o53zvMm0axWeORqhWfI-tk6PfLvRL4B99nZwc6rxzvjZgzlrR6crTkwaEBZxYa-OhWGxWLaA2RztrwtbWg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd6f819f49157ab9155434a79d48ebbad555f89acb6062707d311f90dcc253d715e9fa0af7f14f0ae52be761c251ff6110db2e138e515a27528eeb5b3da429b8d1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"B4nHyiFi9PhmMLCR5sUQF9_WDideZ9jEXb4nVBuh5Bo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1RJ68OZFPDOvDVdeek1AWV4QOoLPMdVzaCxfskqaTvg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"u44WrkuJzCoRgMnNDXv2l5Hy8tMkfO4f7dH06u3nQOw\"}"
