"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Liverpool have requested the postponement of their Carabao Cup semi‑final at Arsenal on Thursday after more positive tests for Covid-19 at the club.\\n\\nThe club submitted the request to the EFL on Tuesday having cancelled a planned training session in response to a rising number of positive tests, other illnesses and injuries.\\n\\nJürgen Klopp, three members of his staff and three players – Alisson, Roberto Firmino and Joël Matip – missed the draw at Chelsea on Sunday having tested positive. The Liverpool manager has mild symptoms but is fine, according to the club.\\n\\nNine Liverpool players were missing at Stamford Bridge as a consequence of Covid, injuries and suspension, and Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané and Naby Keïta have subsequently reported for the Africa Cup of Nations.\\n\\nFurther positive tests on Tuesday prompted Liverpool to request the postponement. The club are awaiting a decision from the EFL and face more problems with the fixture schedule should the request be granted. The Carabao Cup final is scheduled to take place on 27 February and there is limited midweek availability for a rearranged game before that time. Klopp has stated he would prefer the semi-final to be decided over one leg.\\n\\n“The Reds have formally requested to the EFL that the fixture is rescheduled after further suspected positive tests were registered among players and staff, allied to other factors impacting selection, including illness and injury,” said Liverpool, referring to positive lateral flow tests, with PCR results awaited.\\n\\nIn response, the club halted preparations at the Axa Training Centre, meaning Tuesday’s first‑team training session was cancelled. Among the considerations which led to today’s application to the EFL is the need for travelling supporters to be given as much notice as possible of any potential postponement.\\n\\n“With no prospect of the current situation improving ahead of Thursday’s fixture and the potential for it to worsen, the club considers it both prudent and reasonable to ask for the fixture to be rescheduled.”\\n\\nThe EFL said the request would “be considered in accordance with the competition rules as set out at the start of the season alongside information submitted by the club” and a decision would be confirmed as soon as possible.\",\"timestamp\":1641356888,\"title\":\"Liverpool ask for Carabao Cup semi-final to be postponed amid more Covid cases\"},\"digest\":\"8LDovVbCfXjlfGigHX0FSaGgmy-z5HIul5zGgd2n7lQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5Bb1cfE4b0b9a5488B7d07A9A5BCD4dA6134f63b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HgoMR3wdzy02HvHWmoqZ17xCT_qrNu4EYP8yRnniHFo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kec-As0R63PfasVpjKkqNL4yNpHf6GGXg0cobRFVkXk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"FdHium3Vplxz4h4m7f93IFuow3-BlvjdLg2-EXdotwRL2jgQszS-pAVqPuoYCHF1n004F_FpBOHk1_mJzSK-NA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe74ebbecfa94c15b03c1992c5aea4c280ec6915e09510abbccc9090b3511c3193a318b1c8127b9b7bdd22210b4bb031952979e81ca08340634c73737683e03d71b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HgoMR3wdzy02HvHWmoqZ17xCT_qrNu4EYP8yRnniHFo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kec-As0R63PfasVpjKkqNL4yNpHf6GGXg0cobRFVkXk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"8LDovVbCfXjlfGigHX0FSaGgmy-z5HIul5zGgd2n7lQ\"}"
