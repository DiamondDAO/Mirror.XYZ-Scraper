"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"This article is a personal opinion and does not represent any official statement.\\n\\nI noticed this project Cuz I saw crazy reposts from my friends on Twitter. I thought it was just a marketing case of MEME coins. After studying carefully, I found that both the harmoney official Twitter and OlympusDao's official Twitter reposted Concave's Twitter, which aroused my great curiosity.\\n\\nIn the defi generation, many agreements have died in the trend of history, and some agreements have survived tenaciously. Among them, Olympusdao is one of the best。\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CokRUZek9t8pslCbb1WN7.png?height=1000&width=800)\\n\\nLooking back in history.\\n\\nThe market itself is the first to make the right choice when olympus appear, and most investors tend to realize later, and then beat their chests and feet, so the birth of the OHM fork is not without reason.\\n\\nBut since the development of OHM up to now, we can clearly see that OHM is not perfect，The damage is obvious. Liquidity is the core driving force of all DEFI projects. The funds shared by the forked project come from the FOMO sentiment of the market and the unsteady holders of OHM. The original agreement was taken by the forked project and lost liquidity. \\n\\nBut the appearance of Concave seems to have put an end to the fork. What exactly does Concave do?\\n\\nSo far, the official has not given an accurate answer,we do not have any display of the roadmap, but one thing is clear is that Concave serves OHM, aggregates the forked liquidity on multiple chains, increases the multi-chain accessibility of OHM, and breaks the limitations of the current DEFI2.0 project.\\n\\nTo some extent it may also mean that Concaves may lead us to the defi3.0 era.\\n\\nWhat I heard from the community is that Concave is gonna cooperate with Tokemak. \\n\\nThis reminds me whether Concave may use the Tokemak reactor mechanism, and the created assets have their own pools,  This can not only make up for any non-permanent losses incurred by the project, but also guarantee the benefits for staking users.besides Concave is deployed on multiple public chains of FTM, AVAX, CRO, and ONE. The deployment of multiple chains means the fact that funds are increasing. Any DEFI project that wants to become the leader of the track, in addition to a good operating mechanism, the depth of liquidity is also self-evident.To a certain extent, this means that concave is a combination of tokenmak and OHM, and at the same time has the attributes of meme.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NskEoWFqWvpBk72w7V_ME.png?height=572&width=682)\\n\\nI personally don't know whether the concave is the same as what i guess, but judging from the only information available so far, he may go in the direction of dao and bring more benifits to community memebers and real users\\n\\nDefi 3.0 is still at the conceptual stage and has not aroused the resonance of the entire cryptomarket. In the future, more advancers like Concave need to emerge, so that our digital world will have a brighter future, like ours.\\n\\n Respect to the developers of concave, they are the creators of history.\",\"timestamp\":1638448623,\"title\":\"My personal thoughts about Concave， For Reference Only\"},\"digest\":\"FKw1YcmVRm6B521F1auv7SNgv-yXovjb_4-3SSKOdno\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xE6bc40A1B7751722089bDd7c8b5BD544d6F43fe1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7YhqDAy1u4uOfuvW0RR_WVdOIzJ1YnLkAJbUZOmZhY8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"CMLP_GeDbUR0gzF8R682sBRyDLGvz-h_OH4-WPuc_dA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ydrSQ_9-rWXkXbNXvaoWmPdtecOdpMZVCkGHnaeR0tFDWTvHUxagiFsd3A6hZMhOMqAm4Ok-KqIAcq43jBPOgg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x85a83fb04d1ea4199122bc12be3213557556ff3e95868d075c92e11a8c962a1853a7b28ba9016a3c1a8b449f723d2d1f635df71e8ae96edde4475316dcad3b4d1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7YhqDAy1u4uOfuvW0RR_WVdOIzJ1YnLkAJbUZOmZhY8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"CMLP_GeDbUR0gzF8R682sBRyDLGvz-h_OH4-WPuc_dA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"FKw1YcmVRm6B521F1auv7SNgv-yXovjb_4-3SSKOdno\"}"
