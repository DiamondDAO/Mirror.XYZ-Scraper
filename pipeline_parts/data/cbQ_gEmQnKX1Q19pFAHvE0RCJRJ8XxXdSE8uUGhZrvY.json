"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The hardware components of Filecoin mining are not only hard disks and servers, but also AMD CPUs (which also gave birth to the demand for servers with this architecture) and higher-performance GPUs. AMD's CPUs and server market stocks are relatively comparable. In addition, the high-performance GPU has long been monopolized by Ethereum miners, and the hardware cost of Filecoin mining is also rising.\\n\\nHowever, even if the total amount of data in Filecoin's entire network exceeds 12EB, there is still a gap with the data centers of Internet giants such as Ali and Tencent that can easily accommodate 100,000+ servers. Therefore, the price fluctuation is not very large in theory, but according to the author's actual observation, it is not the case.\\n\\nFilecoin miners may have in-depth research on software technology, but most miners, especially small and medium-sized miners, have weak bargaining power with hardware brand agents, and even many miners do not understand the price of hardware at all. The author learned through a hardware procurement intermediary in the industry that according to his understanding, some agents’ server quotations to Filecoin vendors are basically \\\"extraordinary asking prices\\\", and the industry’s rule is that when a company makes an inquiry, it will \\\"lock\\\" that company The company’s right to inquire, that is, other agents can no longer make quotations.\\n\\nOn this basis, the final quotation given by the miner to the customer will give people the illusion that the market terminal price has risen sharply. Although this situation may be an isolated phenomenon, it has to be admitted that Filecoin mining has \\\"contributed part of the power\\\" to the return of AMD's server market share to 16% and the continuous increase in prices.\\nIn addition, due to the extremely high stability requirements of Filecoin mining, the IDC computer room has become the best choice. The author learned from a salesperson in an IDC computer room that many Filecoin miners and miners have come to consult about computer room leasing this year, and their requirements are relatively not so demanding, unlike previous customers who required bidding and so on. A series of procedures have caused them to be extremely busy in the first half of this year. They have to connect with customers while constantly looking for suitable computer rooms. \\\"\",\"timestamp\":1634479679,\"title\":\"Filecoin mining rises, rising hardware prices and amazing computer room sales\"},\"digest\":\"gW1-ULEMcypVTxQghDCnGIi6YDt0hxzal4-OtvW_Ir4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xdF0c3Db4f73e0D1c09b4c590BE88388731133bD3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"pMYwkYCn0SqcupFSCBhA92-wn7nuWfdvIMBbuvvkK7s\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QqPefL7YqtbuliT0-1AYiTvgd2gN6M5AlEvMoAZg8aA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"0BN_EStx0iz9SXqtTneWrO5jcG1MYFBK8DLGmGhIKtGb6afonrnvnA2-8R9RL47QXfuHh_m86hzeZCWDAadpPA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x27d8fc329db3cbe873cefae54af65044ba38de4879e9ea6710695592f46aa4f56d7ecc2521c144311103aceda2758e5f97894877eea15a6309d66429c9f012181c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"pMYwkYCn0SqcupFSCBhA92-wn7nuWfdvIMBbuvvkK7s\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QqPefL7YqtbuliT0-1AYiTvgd2gN6M5AlEvMoAZg8aA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"gW1-ULEMcypVTxQghDCnGIi6YDt0hxzal4-OtvW_Ir4\"}"
