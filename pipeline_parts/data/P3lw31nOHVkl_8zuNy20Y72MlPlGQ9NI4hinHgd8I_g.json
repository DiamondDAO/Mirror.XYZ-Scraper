"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"# Liquidity Mining Program end November 1st, 15:00 PM (UTC)\\n\\n### Overview\\n\\nWe are excited to announce the **BLVKHVND Liquidity Mining Program**. As we continue to build towards [community ownership of BLVKHVND](https://blvkhvnd.com), creating liquidity for HVND via the community is an important step. To do this, we worked with [Forefront](https://twitter.com/forefront__) to stand up our LP site and guide. \\n\\nBLVKHVND will allocate **10,130 HVND** from the treasury for this program that will get distributed to HVND/ETH Uniswap V2 liquidity providers over a period of 60 days, starting at **16:30PM on Sept 3rd, 2021 (EST Time)**.\\n\\n**The program is designed to further bootstrap HVND liquidity by giving the community an opportunity to earn rewards for providing liquidity to our current Uniswap pool, not for speculative purpose.**\\n\\nThe reward will be distributed proportionally to the amount of liquidity each person provides. i.e. if you provide $4,000 worth of liquidity ($2,000 HVND & $2,000 ETH) and there is a total of $100k liquidity in the HVND-ETH pool, for 10 days, then you are entitled to 10% of the distribution over that period.\\n\\n## Specification\\n\\n* The program will start on **September 3rd, 2021, 16:30 PM EST time.**\\n* The reward is available for [HVND/ETH Uniswap V2](https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0xc7e5e86e23a37b982d25fcab7cae105d7cff62cf) pool Liquidity Providers, shared proportionally to the staked amount;\\n* Users will be able to stake, accumulate, unstake and claim their rewards directly at will. There are no lockups on staked tokens.\\n* The liquidity mining program will run for **60 days**, Subsequent liquidity mining programs will be determined by HVND holders and community members.\\n\\n## Steps to Provide Liquidity to HVND/ETH Uniswap V2 Pool & Staking the LP token on BLVKHVND Staking Platform\\n\\n**Liquidity Mining Program end November 1st, 15:00 PM (UTC)**\\n\\nMake sure you have enough HVND and ETH to **add to the liquidity pool.**\\n\\nVisit **HVND/ETH liquidity pool on Uniswap V2**\\n\\n[https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0xc7e5e86e23a37b982d25fcab7cae105d7cff62cf](https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0xc7e5e86e23a37b982d25fcab7cae105d7cff62cf)\\n\\n**Connect** your web3 wallet to uniswap.\\n\\nInput the amount of ETH or HVND that you would like to provide (Uniswap requires 50/50 amount for both assets).\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f2ad7883-7cce-40d7-b162-39e56f9b6420.png?height=1502&width=1138)\\n\\nClick **Approve** HVND to grant uniswap permission to receive your tokens.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b6d4f3cd-24af-462e-bb1c-aafd964b75d9.png?height=1480&width=1178)\\n\\nOnce the transaction is approved, Click **Supply,** this will add the ETH and HVND to the liquidity pool.
