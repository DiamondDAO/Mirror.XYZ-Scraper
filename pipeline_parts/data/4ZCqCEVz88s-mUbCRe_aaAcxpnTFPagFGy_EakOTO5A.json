It‚Äôs a place where like-minded individuals can come together, pool resources, talent, and relationships to build a sustainable community where token holders can participate in the DAO‚Äôs cultural and financial growth.\\n\\nLearn more about DAOs [here](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw).\\n\\n## Who are we?\\n\\nWe‚Äôre a team of music lovers with a lifelong passion for unearthing the world‚Äôs best new talent.\\n\\nSince 2007, we‚Äôve been finding, sharing, and working alongside many of music‚Äôs best new artists, whether it be through our record label (Dreams Never Die), our curation platform ([Before The Data](https://beforethedata.mirror.xyz/-_F5qE3jGx5rdFN4bsv4Gsm_qQu1j3SvCcxpaFyIjiM), FKA Hillydilly), or other outlets.\\n\\nWe earned our reputation in the industry by discovering and helping break some enormously influential artists ([Billie Eilish](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/11/magazine/billie-eilish-profile.html), [LANY](https://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2016/03/27/new-noise-lany/), Lorde, Two Feet, Yellow Days, Kygo, Chelsea Cutler, Tom Misch, [healy](https://www.memphisflyer.com/listen-up-ethan-healy-on-returning-to-his-memphis-roots-new-single-and-video-released-july-23rd), [joan](https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/interviews/joan-on-the-rise), V√âRTI√â + many more). Despite our successes, we learned that pure music discovery wasn‚Äôt sustainable; in the process, though, we had unintentionally put ourselves in the perfect position to form a record label.\\n\\nIn our first two years, Dreams Never Die has signed over 23 new acts, and through our daily practice of sifting through hundreds of songs in every corner of the web, we intend to continue finding and developing the world‚Äôs best new talent.\\n\\nYou can read more about the label [here](https://mirror.xyz/dreamsneverdie.eth/E4tDOA4XgiCcq6R5PcQc7VV3jHFJAsbNDCVp7HJRgXY).\\n\\n## What are we building?\\n\\nSince its inception, Dreams Never Die‚Äôs mission has been to position artists for success by providing resources and guidance in the very early stages, while concurrently amassing a diverse catalog of forward-thinking songs from potential stars.\\n\\nNow, DAOs are expanding our scope.\\n\\nWe intend for Dreams Never Die to become an incubator for brand-new artists and aspiring music business talent alike, built around an incentivized and aligned community that participates in discovering, developing, distributing, and promoting the roster.\\n\\nSimilarly to the existing label, the music will be the backbone of the DAO.\\n\\n## Why are we building it?\\n\\nThe music industry‚Äôs current, data-driven structure makes it incredibly difficult for even the very best new artists to get heard and begin making money, especially without signing an often-exploitative deal with a big company. Not only are great new artists suffering from the current paradigm, but many passionate, talented minds wanting to work on the industry side are finding it equally difficult, especially without compromising their passion for great music itself.\\n\\nWeb3 presents new opportunities and solutions to these problems.\\n\\nWe want the Dreams Never Die Records DAO to form the building blocks of a Web3 community that can become sustainable around artist discovery, early-stage development, and making sure the best music gets heard.\\n\\nWe envision many of the world‚Äôs best new artists and aspiring music professionals aligning to explore new routes toward sustainability; we hope the DAO allows people who are great at what they do to make a living doing what they love.\\n\\n## Team:\\n\\n### Chad Hillard (Project Co-lead)\\n\\n* Founded Dreams Never Die Records, Before The Data, and Hillydilly.\\n* 14+ years of additional industry experience as manager, A&R, promoter, and label owner.\\n\\n### Cole Ryan (Project Co-lead)\\n\\n* VP of A&R, Creative Director at Dreams Never Die Records.\\n* Co-Founder, Editor, Creative Director at Before The Data (former Senior Writer at Hillydilly).\\n* Artist Manager, DJ, Graphic Designer.\\n\\n### Ben Frigeri (Project Co-lead)\\n\\n* Senior Writer and Curator at Before The Data.\\n* A&R, Manager.\\n* Macro music trend analyst.\\n\\n### Chris Anokute (advisor)\\n\\n[Chris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Anokute) is a veteran music industry executive and founder of artist development company Young Forever.
