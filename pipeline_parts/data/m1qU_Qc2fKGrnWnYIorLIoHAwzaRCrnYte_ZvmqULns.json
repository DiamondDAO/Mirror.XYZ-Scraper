"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Why do we have sex?\\nMany people’s answers may refer to the reproduction of offspring. Sexuality is the basic method of creating human beings.\\nBut if sex has little to do with reproduction, how do we think about it?\\nIn 1978, the world's first \\\"test-tube baby\\\" was born. Since then, about 8 million people have come to this world through in vitro fertilization. And in the future, as tools for identifying genetic risks of embryos become more mature, this number may increase dramatically.\\nIn such a world-babies are born in the laboratory; only a few women choose to conceive through sexual intercourse; sexual morality has nothing to do with fertility-what is the meaning of sexual behavior?\\n\\\"What is the purpose of sex?\\\"\\n(David Halperin) There is a paper on this topic, boldly published, which also raises this question. We believe that there is always a \\\"reason\\\" for sex. This view is not necessarily a bad thing. After all, humans need to be mentally and emotionally curious. As an animal that spends most of its time on high-level criticism, it seems natural to experience sexual behavior and summarize the possible meaning of such behavior into a theory.\",\"timestamp\":1640706421,\"title\":\"Are we ready for the sexual liberation movement?（Brandon Ambrosino）\"},\"digest\":\"8N-ZO4Yoc7JatJq2sTfZ6ZdBeBPg9l6oBowAJvOGpJ4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xEdcbD853d8A2661cBbfc1BA2D132DD3E1652Cc79\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7Y7oi5Q0Or2u5U5mRhtasfIrICWMSpJWMjvHYdQi4C8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8sXRX0UCE2kh0i4kXflUOohfPUcRAKEIpxKD7tUtODE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"tVFJQGfV1pjuP8cikAzdF0eNGhb3f-qqJ7rvNOKVBMWykXEBF2_kWSsCW6wJdM0jSmvp6xeyMSw30EbgJP2wFA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4ba116df2da30f8716874bad2dbc4df1562ba2df48e4020d36145fe8ac222c4c3cf716c17613e5a8a483163c5e9b5784b086db0d1022dabd5392b450954c05a31c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7Y7oi5Q0Or2u5U5mRhtasfIrICWMSpJWMjvHYdQi4C8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8sXRX0UCE2kh0i4kXflUOohfPUcRAKEIpxKD7tUtODE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"8N-ZO4Yoc7JatJq2sTfZ6ZdBeBPg9l6oBowAJvOGpJ4\"}"
