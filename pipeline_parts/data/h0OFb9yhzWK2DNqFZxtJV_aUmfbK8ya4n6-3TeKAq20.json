"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"YokaiSwap ([yokaiswap.com](http://yokaiswap.com/)) officially launched in Godwoken, the second-tier network of Nervos block chain, at the end of 2021. In a short period of more than a month, it successfully broke through the $110 million TVL. The price of its token YOK has also risen, currently stabilizing at $0.45, which is about 25 times higher than the initial price of 0.84 CKB at IDO. As a \\\"nova\\\" with a short debut time, YokaiSwap has performed well.\\n\\n![微信图片_20220106211659.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641475059706/npNUfKe4c.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp)\\n\\nAs YokaiSwap evolved, more people began to understand and want to participate. What is the innovation of YokaiSwap? How do the chain assets of different block chains cross the chain? And the most important question: How do we make money with YokaiSwap?\\n\\nIf you also have these questions or more about YokaiSwap, read on. Today, I will explain it in this article. Of course, I need to remind you that investments are risky, so be careful.\\n\\n![46b2d4e897933bce60f0c5fe93734f0.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641475925029/_QG5ILoXn5.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp)\\n\\n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641476185930/36Fx8Rc9P.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp)\\n\\nSpeak back to YokaiSwap.\\n\\nYokaiSwap is the first innovative cross-chain de-centralized trading platform to come online in the Nervos chain.\\n\\n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641476228585/4BPanvjzC.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp)\\n\\nYOK (YokaiSwap Token) is a platform pass for YokaiSwap, totaling 1 billion. $ YOK's capabilities include purchasing platform NFTs, getting IDOs for other projects, and drawing prizes.\\n\\nHere's the core of our article: How to earn $YOK\\n\\n**Core ideas:**\\n\\n1. Obtain a $YOK reward (pledge $YOK or LP) by providing liquidity to YokaiSwap\\n2. Earn other earnings from YokaiSwap in exchange for $YOK (activity, band, price difference, etc.)\\n\\nAround the core idea, we can achieve the specific operation through the following increasing difficulty of the play.\\n\\n**Fundamental Play**: Earn $YOK by entering $CKB on the gold Nervos chain\\n\\nThis is the basic way to make money.\\n\\nWe deposit the native token $CKB in the Nervos chain into YokaiSwap by direct transfer.\\n\\nThen exchange $YOK with $CKB, mortgage $YOK to the pool, and get a $YOK reward automatically or manually. Or you can exchange $CKB for various other assets to form a pledge of the LPs needed on the farm to obtain the transaction's service fee dividend and $YOK award.\\n\\n**Upgrade Play**: Earn $YOK from assets across the Ethereum chain\\n\\nThis is a more difficult way to make money.\\n\\nThrough the cross-chain bridge ForceBridge, we will cross-chain the Taifang assets through smart contracts to Nervos and then recharge them to YokaiSwap.\\n\\nWe pledged the LPs we needed to make up the farm with our own assets, and then received the deal's service fee dividend and $YOK award.\\n\\n**More Plays**: Participate in activities, capture price differentials\\n\\nIn addition to the above two, we can also use the platform's rules and activities to achieve other ways of making money.\\n\\nFor example, IDO at the end of last December and IFO a few days ago, participants can buy $YOK at a lower price.\\n\\nFor example, YokaiSwap once co-hosted an airdrop event with SafePal to receive free $YOK Award for completing the tasks requested by the project party.\\n\\nSince YokaiSwap is a decentralized trading platform, under certain circumstances, a certain pass price on YokaiSwap may differ from that on other trading platforms. At this time, we can obtain profits by buying low and selling high, then buying the proceeds as $YOK.\\n\\n**Specific tutorials for some steps:**\\n\\n**Cross Chain**: (Ethereum→Nervos)\\n\\n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641476345681/-SlWoTpRA.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp)\\n\\n1. Open the ForceBridge web address [forcebridge.com](https://forcebridge.com/) , open MetaMask and select the Ethernet home network.\\n2. Confirm that the cross-link path from \\\"Ethereum\\\" to \\\"Nervos\\\" is selected.\\n3. Select currency such as USDC or ETH\\n4. Open YokaiSwap Page [yokaiswap.com/bridge/deposit](https://www.yokaiswap.com/bridge/deposit) ，Copy the Layer1 recharge address from YokaiSwap and paste it into the Recipient box of ForceBridge. Make sure the address is correct.\\n5. Perform cross-chain operations, complete authorization and interoperability in turn, which requires two fuel charges in ETH.\\n6. After the operation is completed, wait for the transaction to succeed. The slide-down page can query the cross-chain process on the History page, showing that the Pending status requires a few moments and succeeds within the Succeed status. The number of arrivals will be reduced slightly from the start, and this portion of the USDC will be converted into 400 CKBs and eventually returned automatically.\\n\\n**Income**: (Nervos→YokaiSwap，L1→L2)\\n\\n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641475324278/b6tRnlH0h.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp)\\n\\n1. Open YokaiSwap and enter the Page URL: [yokaiswap.com/bridge/deposit](https://www.yokaiswap.com/bridge/deposit)\\n2. Search within the \\\"sUDT\\\" to select currencies requiring payment, such as \\\"CKB\\\", \\\"USDC\\\", \\\"ETH\\\"\\n3. Put the selected currency into the two-tier network of YokaiSwap and at least 464 CKBs are required in the account.\\n4. After signing, wait for about a minute. Successful recharging assets can be found on the YokaiSwap transaction page.\\n\\n**Assets withdrawn**: (YokaiSwap→Nervos，L2→L1)\\n\\n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641478472602/Y4YK1rWbL.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp)\\n\\n1. Open YokaiSwap and enter the web address of the prompt page: [yokaiswap.com/bridge/withdrawal](https://www.yokaiswap.com/bridge/withdrawal)\\n2. Search within the \\\"sUDT\\\" to select the currency to be remitted, such as \\\"CKB\\\", \\\"USDC\\\", \\\"ETH\\\"\\n3. Launch a withdrawal of the selected assets, at which point there needs to be at least 64 CKBs in the L1 account.\\n4. After signing, wait for about 3 days. You can find the option to withdraw assets on the YokaiSwap Tip page and click to enter the Nervos wallet address.\\n\\nI am ROEDEER (roedeer.bit), a member of CKBFans,（a Nervos community organization）.
