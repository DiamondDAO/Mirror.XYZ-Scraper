"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### ARCATA POLICE DEPARTMENT\\n\\n*\\\\*For Immediate Release - October 1st\\\\**\\n\\n**ARCATA, CA -** During the early morning hours of October 1st, the Arcata Police Department received multiple calls voicing concerns of a disturbance at the Arcata Community Greenhouse located at **\\\\[address redacted\\\\]**. Two officers arrived at the location to discover that the back gate had been blown open by what appears to be a localized explosive. Upon further investigation and corroboration with the greenhouse's owners, the Indigo Purple Vampire Fern is missing. No other plants or belongings appear to have left with it, but some show signs of distress having fallen from hanging receptacles.\\n\\nCCTV \\\\[*image included below*\\\\] confirms that the potted plant housing the fern was stolen by two unidentified robbers. It is important to note that the Vampire Fern cannot be seen in any image. However, it is clear that while invisible on CCTV monitors, the fern impacted its physical environment as the robbers left with the pot. This explains the receptacles on the ground.\\n\\nWorth noting, the robbers each wore orca whale Halloween costumes, covering their faces and bodies entirely. CCTV cameras only monitored the surrounding area of the Vampire Fern, and we do not have any leads regarding a possible getaway vehicle or license plate number. As it stands, there are no leads at this time.\\n\\n![Image Description: Two people dressed in orca whale Halloween costumes steal an invisible plant from a greenhouse.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nIPfwFiRxjGyIE669fwvB.png?height=512&width=512)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nFollow the **Legend of the Vampire Fern** and follow me on Twitter [@anthjgibson](https://twitter.com/anthjgibson).\\n\\nThis Hidden Mystery is brought to the denizens of the Internet by \\n\\n[https://hiddenones.io/](https://hiddenones.io/)\\n\\nInstallments released once a week. \",\"timestamp\":1642110421,\"title\":\"The Vampire Fern is Missing | Press Release\"},\"digest\":\"kPu9d-81cU9CTAXr2ARymY9sNMsdG7isFveV_wzTcMw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7DC7f3932E621A65e5Fb7D0cF521C64372DB1A92\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"pSQ7Xe1oZgyylrldAOjB1QU2-Nz4DhZcF7wW0IfrQRA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"R6IuCt6MYcycMFsmkV4OOD5wgbm9ET7qosEwCQL3ulE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"K0Pvyan19YS9t4zLkQupEbLEo2CJyvJ_TOy4kJHl9lJ0cn9IvhRLaZq76zf8IpSt23eMNtm6gP54R8TGcW9_qg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1bf6460d9195a7eda2246f8164fe11740bfe19a8a8b2414bfa5f61fd2a9971891579da6495ede374dd6cddb7a2b0735d471fb6f09f56032025e201785670dbce1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"pSQ7Xe1oZgyylrldAOjB1QU2-Nz4DhZcF7wW0IfrQRA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"R6IuCt6MYcycMFsmkV4OOD5wgbm9ET7qosEwCQL3ulE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"kPu9d-81cU9CTAXr2ARymY9sNMsdG7isFveV_wzTcMw\"}"
