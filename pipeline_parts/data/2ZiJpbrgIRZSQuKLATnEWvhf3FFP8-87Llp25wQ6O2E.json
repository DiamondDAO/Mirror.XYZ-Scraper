"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**I am of increasing conviction that Ethereum will enter a prolonged winter in the Q2 of 2022. The summer blimp-on-the-radar draw-down of 2021 will seem nothing compared to what is about to come.**\\n\\nI believe commenting on the price action is unhelpful on its own, but we need to be aware of the grander trends in the ecosystem. Those trends will define the web3 job market and the projects which will get funded or will be forced to shut down during this cycle.\\n\\nIn this article, I will argue that there will be several narratives at play in 2022 that will result in Ethereum entering a bear market.\\n\\nThere’s been a widespread narrative pushed by ConsenSys that Ethereum “achieved its network effects” and became the most important EVM. While not being usable for all use cases, with alternative L1s such as Solana/BSC/Avalanche filling the niche for cheaper DeFi (higher frequency/full order book DeXs, GameFi), Ethereum remained the “king” among them and spearheaded the DeFi revolution. Hot NFT space also underpinned its importance as the rule maker.\\n\\nBut what is about to change?\\n\\n## The IBC ecosystem and the advent of cross-chain\\n\\nWith the advent of the IBC ecosystem and the recent rise of Cosmos, we see Internet of Blockchains to be an increasingly more bullish thesis inside web3. People see that as an erosion of Ethereum’s network effects and its subsequent decrease in importance.\\n\\nWe can have a quick look at <https://mapofzones.com/> to realise all the links that have been brought up recently between the different blockchains which support the IBC protocol. With Cosmos and Osmosis leading the pack, and also with Terra (Terra Bridge) and Solana (Wormhole bridge) having the bridges to the Ether liquidity, we might see more and more value being locked in tokens native to those blockchains.\\n\\nWith easy interop between the blockchains, upcoming DeFi projects will not need to be constrained by the shortcomings of Ethereum to get the coveted liquidity. They will simply build on the right blockchain for the job and bridge over to Ethereum to allow investors to come in.\\n\\nEven though Vitalik believes that cross-chain does not provide enough security, I think for most of the use cases it will simply be enough. Do GameFi, low-cap OlympusDAO forks and other “toy” DeFi use cases really need the same protections Ethereum L1 gets? I doubt it.\\n\\n## The Merge\\n\\nIt’s hard not to find a person in Web3 Twitter who is not hyping up The Merge. I take a contrarian view that The Merge will cause The Great Sell-Off that will come into effect when all the staked Ether in the Beacon Chain will be unlocked. There’s currently 9 million Ether (7% of the total supply) locked in Beacon. Once it gets unlocked, we will see mainly two types of trades: investors looking to cash-out back into fiat, greatly depressing the Ether price, and investors looking to deploy their capital into new projects causing what we used to call “the alt season”. As we know from previous cycles, this causes alternative crypto asset classes to rise with a subsequent blow-off top and for the whole market to go into a winter straight after.\\n\\nThe alternative asset classes we might see this time could be NFTs, L2s (#L222) and of course the IBC ecosystem. On the NFT side, I predict that we might see top 10% NFTs going up significantly in value, trickling down into smaller collections. On L2s, we will see a lot of value going into L2 tokens and into L2s themselves, but probably not much more than that since there won't be enough use cases built out on L2s yet. In regards to the IBC ecosystem, Cosmos and Terra might see a rapid rise again as the cross-chain sentiment is rising.\\n\\n## Macro headwinds\\n\\nA lot is to be said about tapering and the upcoming rate hikes. My overall view is that it will take at least 2 to 3 years for the rate hikes to fully come into effect and start affecting the top line of meatspace companies. This gives equities 2 to 3 more years of a bull run. On the other hand, crypto markets are more sentiment-driven and generally trade on any comment that Jerome Powell makes. This sets us up for an environment where equities will be outperforming crypto markets which will also drive more people back into fiat and depress prices.\\n\\n## The Importance of the VC ecosystem (again)\\n\\nWe love to hate on the VCs. But as we will be entering the upcoming bear market, they will be our loathed saviours.\\n\\nThe grade of retail investment activity in the crypto ecosystem hasn't been all that good. Retail in crypto is known to pick either terrible, technically infeasible, or just straight up overhyped projects. Not to say we can’t pick winners or make a return. But we’re notoriously terrible at funding projects with deep protocol-market fit.\\n\\nProbably not due to the diligence but by simply having a bigger checkbook, VCs managed to fund great web3 infrastructure projects which greatly advanced the state of our ecosystem. Case-in-point being the Uniswap protocol and Solana. Granted, we should avoid centralization and move away from using that particular tech. But nothing stops us from enjoying the fruits of the VCs capital without actually sacrificing any of the decentralization in the ecosystem.\\n\\nHere’s how it goes: VCs fund an innovative protocol. Founders work hard on bringing it to life and achieving the protocol-market fit. We use it and we like it. We make the protocol enough money to give the founders and VCs a 100x return. We fork it and run a community version of it.\\n\\nIt happened to Uniswap/Sushiswap and it will happen again. Multiple times over.\\n\\nAnd here’s the kicker, we will need the VC funds in the upcoming bear market. The best, deep innovation is built in a bear market, when all the hype has died down and bad actors are not around to make a quick buck. The best VCs invest in any weather, and they will fund the projects which will come out victorious during the next cycle.\\n\\n## Epilogue\\n\\nA lot of things depend on timing. The Merge has been delayed (again) to Q2 of 2022. If it’s delayed again, the prolonged scarcity might just be enough for us to enter another supercycle.\\n\\nGranted, the future might turn out differently. We might not see a full on-bear market, but a mere crypto recession where there’d be a prolonged period of little-to-no-growth at the current price levels.\\n\\nIt’s important to be aware of these trends. While I suggest anyone to avoid starting any trades based on the upcoming crypto environment, I plead you all to prepare. Don’t fall by the wayside. Keep BUIDLing and you will yet to see the greatest bull cycle of your lifetime.\",\"timestamp\":1642294917,\"title\":\"Ethereum winter and why we need to co-exist with VCs\"},\"digest\":\"tZfDzwxin10QY3RTfoyHEaZIwWR7N_XiUlWb-2GmOzM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x1F40f6cFe873536998e302BfEe85484e09e12E3B\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"00NYErLpDncpBxPKsos_j3dhKcZRRobmyW79xVOoXjk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Yd8taFaMsiznkJl_Ge7UJ_gRRpvbATp3G6cyjd9BQrE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Y_Lee8-19bx7E7v84umNbokcaqvighgq9wn8xZXe65EH4tFQSyWrLWELfwgPRmUcHNfBPQc3jaI3tcHXVCDYtg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4c9c8027c6a5f80b3d993c3c1fc1b885b913b5d7aa86329dae730a0c6a8f028e1ae1c5582e7470ebc308b3d7d0e0a8216e5aeb99609e4aa2686b1513a3d83ba11b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"00NYErLpDncpBxPKsos_j3dhKcZRRobmyW79xVOoXjk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Yd8taFaMsiznkJl_Ge7UJ_gRRpvbATp3G6cyjd9BQrE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"mXPlUygtACqD0vbBicNFaCmVSE_ZFhhRF5XgkDJsUq8\"}"
