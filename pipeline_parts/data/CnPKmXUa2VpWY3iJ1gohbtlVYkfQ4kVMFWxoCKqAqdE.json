"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Sergey Nazarov joined the crypto space in 2011, later becoming the co-founder and CEO of SmartContract in addition to founding the tokenized oracle network Chainlink. Nazarov, only in his early thirties, is the son of Russian immigrants who moved to New York in the early 1990s. He is currently based in San Francisco.\\n\\nNazarov first launched the SmartContract platform in 2014 as a way for users to build trustless, programmable agreements, and in 2016, he first revealed his oracle solution. At the time, Nazarov said that “Easily connecting smart contracts to the data sources, internal services and bank payment methods desired by users is the next step in making them truly useful for real world use cases.” In an attempt to solve the so-called “oracle problem” faced by centralized oracle networks, SmartContract announced the decentralized Chainlink network in 2017, which went live on the Ethereum mainnet in mid-2019.\",\"timestamp\":1639033801,\"title\":\"Once you achieve a certain level of security\"},\"digest\":\"o_8OkRFC3rwEO82e0f9USSIhBSO5L76DAjO_GiuU1EE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd85739516B1BdCDDFdf9aA7f6acAcb4307766A9b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"gEtc6JGXZyHP7lIzjcxT47e1Zycds3jn16VtrU9dMgw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"w4FLlCU9YBuepdbdttP1biwm0cVvkgxkCq3zoLUviz8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"nhDyoQcDPflCyTZi6OD3CZrQMQW8I43xnpJLOpEVG2RQv7Ml3QWlp6VMzCwGgMQmsef_j51w9ueZaP8rQT6TEw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe30de0a8027a77804fb73de63617ac7c34fbe8cd86b44a1d8627b4997c6c06e527120fd3043cd0bfab2b2a76cff0df570493c4d5d80931272b0a049e262b6c5e1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"gEtc6JGXZyHP7lIzjcxT47e1Zycds3jn16VtrU9dMgw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"w4FLlCU9YBuepdbdttP1biwm0cVvkgxkCq3zoLUviz8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"o_8OkRFC3rwEO82e0f9USSIhBSO5L76DAjO_GiuU1EE\"}"
