"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1946\\n\\nMany know about Apollo 11, it's a milestone in history, marking the period of humanity before and after landing on the Moon. Its origin was the end of WW II.\\n\\nThe Americans got Von Braun and his team. A new secret war began. A Cold War. The German team's past was blotted out by the glare of a Space Race and ballistic missiles upgraded for the moon. America was determined to win the next battlefield, Space.\\n\\nThere was another team however.\\n\\nStalin pulled Sergei Korolev out of imprisonment after 6 years - who was imprisoned on false charges of being a counter-revolutionary, later reduced to \\\"saboteur of military technology\\\". Korolev's identity was a state secret - he was only known as the \\\"Chief Designer\\\" of the Soviet space program. He was to “recruit” German engineers by force in 1946.\\n\\nHelmut Gröttrup, who studied under the inventor of the 'Geiger counter', worked under Werner Von Braun. At one point, Gröttrup was detained by the 'SS' for 'defeatist' statements because he complained that he wanted to build a spaceship. Korolev got his hands on him and over 2,000 technicians. They were secret “consultants” who enabled Soviet ambitions.\\n\\nGröttrup was allowed to move to East Germany in 1953. \\n\\nBritish and American intelligence soon helped him escape to Cologne. His debrief alerted them about rising Soviet rocket payloads and range, confirmed by Yuri Gagarin’s successful launch in 1957. No more spaceships for Gröttrup.\\n\\nHe began a second life in financial technology. \\n\\nHe built machine reading security technology to reduce counterfeiting. He automated banknote processing - which became a standard in Central Banking. Before he retired, Grottrup filed a patent for an 'Unforgeable Identification Switch', and created the world's first Smart Card. \\n\\nMillions would use it at gas stations daily.\\n\\n2911\\n\\n\\\"Where am I?\\\" asked Jacob's \\\"guest\\\", who was alive but afraid.\\n\\n\\\"Rest easy, you're in a safe house, Doctor. We got you a medical doctor. Something you ate at the place disagreed with you. A local bug that was just enough to trigger a reaction with the food. A fluke.\\\"\\n\\nJacob poured a drink and gave it to his guest. His guest paused.\\n\\n\\\"Here, I'll have one too. Cheers, Doctor. To your continued health.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's good.\\\" The guest drank, leaned back and sighed. \\\"What now?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It wasn't the 'mother' of that food place. The place was hidden in plain sight. As a precaution, I guess I won't be going back there any time soon. A shame, I liked the food. I am sorry about what happened. You look better, how are you feeling?\\\" Jacob pulled his a chair to sit closer.\\n\\n\\\"I'm okay, I think.\\\" The guest finished his drink.\\n\\n\\\"More? No? Okay. Doctor, I want you to know you are safe here. I need your help. We can help your family too. I know you're worried about them. We know the Triumvirate's enforcers are watching them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you need from me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Doctor, in a previous life, you helped design the DeepShips, as far back as the early days of the Long War, when it was supposed to be short.”\\n\\n\\\"They've been mothballed, the programs were shut down, after all those changes, they went from civilian and scientific to the war effort, then so on. Then shut down. Forgotten.” The guest shrugged shoulders.\\n\\n\\\"Mothballed, yes, Doctor. But not forgotten. Decent security, to the point they became floating warehouses collecting space dust. Interesting security and admin features. That's what you can help us with.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you want from me?\\\" The guest’s fear returned.\\n\\n\\\"Doctor, we need your help to take over these ships.\\\"\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/u5nKb3zRCKWhKa_F7HmCd.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/F6XLwzLuktSgWH7xzrn6o.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633890421,\"title\":\"1961: 5.5 Secret Ships, Smart Switches, 2911\"},\"digest\":\"eKRfULQ3X-JdDtBEIiIB2Q5PV6yht5QvBAlglXdG2gQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Ky5rLedO5D4MLt4Y8xbpejjoJJPjihrxUvN8qePI2HSgNNw4QLzbvuIbGpfoFzhpI02a8zpW35lgbZ_k6E6Xjg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"eKRfULQ3X-JdDtBEIiIB2Q5PV6yht5QvBAlglXdG2gQ\"}"
