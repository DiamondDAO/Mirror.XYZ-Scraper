A man will turn over half a library to make a book.* \\n\\n—Samuel Johnson \\n  \\n You can't write with your eyes closed. Write anything you can remember. \\n  \\n \\\"This doesn't belong.\\\" \\\"It's the future, that's all you have to remember.\\\" \\n  \\n Vice Versa. A strong looking man is sitting at the bar and the bartender brings over a lady. The strong man takes the lady's arm and sits up as well as he can, while the barkeep sits by himself and slurps his drink. Soon both the tray and the strong man are getting their legs kicked off the chair. \\n  \\n The sky is darkening. The overhang of the roof gives a trench of shelter.  Neither say a word - you don't need to say much to sit against the theft of an arm. \\n  \\n A window in the Louisiana bayou floats wide open and below it an overturned fishing boat floats giving eager, scrabbling noises.  An osprey rose out of the darkness searching for a worm or small fish. And in the waning dusk a zombie shuffles up carrying a shotgun. A cigar will always fit in your mouth to a tee. \\n  \\n Sometimes the lighting should be dark to show the smoke with an appropriate heaviness. \\n  \\n The poem doesn't need to rhyme. \\n  \\n Sometimes you really need a gleam of those witty substances to keep a dumduck happy - to remind him that whoever or whatever he is supposed to love is on the way.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vGXgF8btwkA-SmhM6jY6M.jpeg?height=2000&width=2000)\\n\\n*A library implies an act of faith.* \\n  \\n Victor Hugo said, \\\"Whether or not we have a sense of fate has an infinite scope.\\\" \\n  \\n I believe I'm lucky in having another ideology. \\n  \\n I have faith. \\n  \\n I believe this. \\n  \\n Me after having an attitude adjustment about reading books in a library and why. \\n  \\n If you just stop, relax, close your eyes to admit the fantasy reading space around you, things will just arrange themselves into another question, maybe a new thought. \\n  \\n Yes, that's where the useful volumes for practice of your cubicles are kept at this organization I work for; who would notice someone using any of those space - hungry works? \\n  \\n Because my own library pages look quite obviously as they should; I'm right by at least twelve marble washstands. \\n  \\n When I rolled in for the second time that day (the magic creature doesn't work properly half the time), I took out a only stack of boxes and packets and a blank origami book. \\n  \\n In my crook, where I can turn around in computer control, a vista of hay bales and an old train on the Russian diaspora lay in the shadows between the entry door's lovingly tended stalks of tallow and ripened rapeseed. \\n  \\n And that intersection of running engines and spinning plates reminded me of sometimes when I've felt trapped between the Spanish Civil War erupting in the media in one corner.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FSfLWZumOY42zGqBr1Prt.jpeg?height=2000&width=2000)\\n\\n*That perfect tranquillity of life, which is nowhere to be found but in retreat, a faithful friend and a good library.*\\n\\n—Aphra Behn\\n\\nFor an end to life, we would take it into ourselves to abandon all pride, to sit in our room, and make for ourselves, from the remains of the news of the day, a portrait of our country, so that when we see it again we will know that we have been there and seen it all.\\n\\nIf we were to die, we would do so with a clear conscience. It is not so much that we want to die, but that we want to live. We would like to die as though it were a part of our life. We would like to die like a man, as though it were the natural order of things.\\n\\nBut the day after tomorrow, we will go out and play again. We will go out and play, and it will be wonderful.\\n\\nFor the moment, I have nothing to say. I am in despair.\\n\\nI am not myself. I am a fool.\\n\\nI am nothing. I am a beggar.\\n\\nI am a nobody.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Xv315shN9a3SlbuTpRX4y.jpeg?height=2000&width=2000)\\n\\n*If truth is beauty, how come no one has their hair done in the library?* \\n  \\n Lily Tomlin might not have been a better gossip than we are. \\n  \\n If truth is beauty, how come no one uses their eyes to draw? \\n Placed on the ground, two leaves look like all the other leaves. \\n Then why do they blend into the grass? \\n  \\n If truth is beauty, how come no one weeps with their eyes open? \\n Lily Tomlin might not have been a better liar than we are. \\n When called on the carpet, she cried, \\\"What I said was, 'The girl needed new clothes!'\\\" \\n  \\n If truth is beauty, how come no one keeps a diary in the bathroom? \\n Perhaps they use it for their makeup. \\n  \\n If truth is beauty, how come no one owns a bookshop? \\n Lily Tomlin might not have been a better thief than we are. \\n When asked to pick up some onions, she took the cheese. \\n That's why the grocer called the police. \\n  \\n If truth is beauty, how come no one uses their words to say, \\\"I love you\\\"? \\n It would seem that the only thing Lily Tomlin left in the world was (me): Stolen from the Internet: Nearly 20 Years in the Hole. \\n  \\n I'm an author.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d9L9580y-1SFXaHWByzs_.jpeg?height=2000&width=2000)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E8xxE3G-79CSdjhyIJcsg.jpeg?height=2000&width=2000)\\n\\n*I've been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.*\\n\\n—F. Scott Fitzgerald\\n\\n  \\n A note on the door scolded occupants against staying in after hours. \\n  \\n Standing, I walked to read it, my hand grazing the nose once to collect my echoes. \\n  \\n A lovely nose. I wiped it in mock regret. It was undamaged. \\n  \\n When I smacked my knuckles on the desk, a few pages went out of orbit before chugging back into place. \\n  \\n The books were stacked in orderly detail, done. I straightened each one, snagging at stray papers and tassels that I shoved into drawers where antiques collected. \\n  \\n A powder compact recovered to disturb the tabulating head and last vestiges of romance.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/acjHArOCH5JpbOpujia7V.jpeg?height=2000&width=2000)\\n\\n*My Alma mater was books, a good library... I could spend the rest of my life reading, just satisfying my curiosity.*\\n\\n—Malcolm X \\n  \\n My last book, which I finished in a week, was \\\"A Dance to the Music of Time\\\".  I'm a fool for good reading. \\n  \\n A few years ago, I started a story, and it got me to thinking. The story took me to another world. I never published it, and I haven't thought about it in a long time, but I think I'm going to go back to it. I'm going to start it over. It's not really a continuation of the previous story, but it is connected. The book begins when one of the main characters, who is not me, is given the chance to relive a past life. I can't go into too many details, because I don't know how I'm going to write it yet, but I need to try. \\n  \\n It's been so long since I've done any writing, but I think I'm ready to try again. This time, I won't give up. I'm not sure if any of you will ever read this, but I need to write this for me, and to see what I can make out of my world. \\n  \\n One comment. \\n  \\n He looked old, with a beard so pale that it looked blue, and wrinkled hands that gripped onto an old coffee mug.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aklS75Mu2eyabizF_mrl4.jpeg?height=2000&width=2000)\\n\\n*I'm not a library.*\\n\\n—Sidney Poitier\\n\\nI literally live in my own fucking books. Enough said.\\n\\n \\n In its desire to grab readers (and their eyeballs) back from the other arbitrary distractions like libraries took bad examples and massaged them to appear stellar. Stacking their bookcase around the perimeter would be simple and inventive. Don't bother with fancy book shops and author signings; grab a chunk of road from the dwindling back rows to the front rows and put on a great presentation. The curb appeal people are clamoring to consume and amuse them. Proportions of mismatched books would make your books shelf reflect the breadth of genres you put into them. But… true enthusiasts? Me included?\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kpHpN37OWycgheGjh4Ep5.jpeg?height=2000&width=2000)\\n\\n*When you go to the library, you see other books around on the shelves that you never knew existed.*\\n\\n—Camille Paglia\\n\\n  \\n So you start picking up books. \\n  \\n Pretty soon, it seems, you have no more room for your own books, let alone books by other authors. \\n  \\n Besides, you're too busy trying to get your hands on the books you want to spend time reading what someone else wants you to read. \\n  \\n So you send that book to the library. \\n  \\n Then, when you finally get a chance to read it, you realize that it's not really the book you want to read, but a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a book. \\n  \\n It's just more \\\"me\\\" than it is \\\"you\\\".\",\"timestamp\":1642096942,\"title\":\"The Infinitesimal  Library of Babylon \"},\"digest\":\"MjIobA3xGi7uYIXy_xr9XmqJcL2kTEE1vh_uFBt7de4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4220b37139aB94a35e1FACB2E4d0B19Cff28B43c\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"aOLnxNBbRYT4mCH-oIs82T86FTLUTxuObIMMBGSXsgg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gsBsMd1NVfmvVDzGZ4LN0F8sgGdon69PS-9UylBZjuk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"km5VX1D6qkswq7Gya6-49fkMCoHYoYiOD2levpRi3LAEAdAUC70411taqb3_aPuFiCNbK0ldLYuC5rwTumr08g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x94e06e54c6220c50b29eec63fe1fbf02335607b5efa7a56c4758b076e13e311b3b7c82997018f55168baa7197acfff954bf86bddc62119dc460f73ff25eb00e21b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"aOLnxNBbRYT4mCH-oIs82T86FTLUTxuObIMMBGSXsgg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gsBsMd1NVfmvVDzGZ4LN0F8sgGdon69PS-9UylBZjuk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"MjIobA3xGi7uYIXy_xr9XmqJcL2kTEE1vh_uFBt7de4\"}"
