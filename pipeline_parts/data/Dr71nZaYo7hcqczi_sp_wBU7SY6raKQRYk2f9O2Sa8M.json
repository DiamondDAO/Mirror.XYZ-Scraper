"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"In the past three weeks, Wednesday has become my favorite weekday just because I finally get to share with you what’s occupied me for the past few days. 3/10 stories about Ivy are here, before You! As always, wish You joy and peace while reading the next lines, making those whits that one thing on mind, trying to get an answer to all questions that seem hard. Ther’s one biggest of them all: \\\\*\\\\*“How to make dreams come true in the real realm?” \\\\*\\\\***[#10bywednesday](https://yoo.rs/tag/10bywednesday)**\\n\\nThe fire was almost out when Ivy woke up, shivering. “The Sun did not still show its face, but soon it will, go back and sleep” — buzzed the Rhythm Bee in Ivy’s ear. The boy feels in deep sleep, coldness keeping his arms and feet. But someone there’s shouting his name, on the line between reality and dream, shouting so loud he woke up a few times, looking around who’s there. Jet his Bee friend is only there repeating the line: “go sleep, child!”- gently buzzing the fear away in the air, while the New Moon was showing the last of his magnificent water dance, showing the lights magnificent glance. Waterfall going downstream in a loud rush in silence space, creating sound harmony only the water can make, the boy was watching in peace, and listen to Rythm Bee advice — he’s finally closed his eyes and there it is- beautiful antique door just in front of him. Slowly whispering a story curved in the hardwoods, the child did not hesitate anymore to enter a different realm, he marched courageously forward to see where are his bare feet. The sky was purple, and the grass red, there was no bird’s nest, only giant eggs. And shrooms so big one can use as an umbrella or a raft, dragonfly that can take you on a ride:\\n\\n**“ Hoop on my back, let’s go for a ride, you still do not recognize where You are?**\\n\\n**Look around and try to find any familiar sign on perspective high,**\\n\\n**It’s life’s greatest surprise, come on, don’t be shy.”**\\n\\nThe boy was not hesitating for too long, the friendly familiar bug face and voice, but did not have time to think about that now, it’s a dragonfly calling him for a ride! Before his parents died, those bugs were his favorite thing to watch, back home, where the river’s wild, but it’s now placed so far. He came close and realise how big this bug is and how small he was while standing by the dragonflies side, courageously taking one more act, a small step back. Dragonfly just smiled and spread his enormous colorful wings out, shining on a warming sun in light aquamarine stile, hoping its size did not scare the child.\\n\\n**“Hey, don’t you recognize me, it’s me, Rithym Bee You call me.**\\n\\n**We are in Your dream, let me know when you are done with the fear,**\\n\\n**So we can enjoy and learn while we are here!”**\\n\\nIvy’s spine get right back up, stood their eyes full of surprise while bursts of happiness comes out of his mouth. “Who were knew it’s you! So, glad to see you here. How do you mean, we are in my dream? Tell me more, my dear Rithm Bee!” — jumping on the dragonfly’s back in ninja style and hitting the ground like an overripe fig from the tree, realizing where located is his dream — the island he was lost on, and the fig tree. Standing in his dream where the first time coastline was reached. “Rythm Bee, we are on the island in my dream, what does that mean? Can’t I simply have another better one?”\\n\\n**“Come on, already, do not waste time complaining of what you do not know about, rather let your body do the walking part, come on my back to see and feel for Yourself, how powerful in reality can be simple belief in hearts dream.”**\\n\\nAs he started to climb on the top of the huge bug, and comfortably sat, his wings started to clap in order to get Ivy high, where he can even touch the sky. “ Forward, Dragons Eyes, catch that big pink cloud, I would like to jump from one to another pink cloud! Please, tell me I can do that!” — exclaims the boy loud while Dragon Eyes set his course speeding like a rocket leaving a sparkly sound behind, reaching the cloud really fast. Ivy holds tight on the bug’s back, experiencing the excitement floating rapidly in waves starting on the forehead, ending on toes, because the boy was standing right where he’s wished for — the pink cloud is all his to jump from one to another, and back on one, just like a trampoline mode. **“This is even better than the real one I tried before!”** — thought laughter concludes the boy, taking one last jump before he decides it’s time for a rest, landing in his little pink cushion nest. Crossing his legs and putting his arms behind the head, like he had finished whit important work he was doing, he hears the voice talking once again:\\n\\n“ **What made you think I’m not real? Look at me, I’m a trampoline You were playing with, although I’m just a pink cloud in Your dream, does not mean you can’t find me where the line was drawn, a blurry line separates dream and real, my child dear.**\\n\\n**How come You think trampoline is not real?**\\n\\nIvy did not get scared, he was pleased to know, and at this point, he was sure, how everything wants to help find the special cure. The cure that will make there’s no inside pain, no grief or loneliness, because Ivy learned once You let go, You’ll starting make room for something more. “I can’t find an explanation for the riddle, Pinky Cloud of mine, but this is a dream. How can be real?\\n\\n**If this is not real, being in Your dream while you sleep, Are You even real? What does it even mean? One must find the courage to change in balance by looking at the ocean within, so blue and deep. When You do that, share whit me, what do you see? And then, tell me, do you still think this trampoline is not real?**\\n\\nIvy gladly took the challenge, bravely closing his eyes and taking a few breaths, wondering about the deep ocean. Child’s imagination started to go wild, he was in the submarine determinant going deeper and deeper, and going down was followed by his heart bouncing on his chest really hard, as surface light was almost gone. As he reaches the maximum darkness point “I’m lost!” crosses his mind, jet knows enough to keep resilient calm, controlling one thing currently he’s aware of. “I’m still breathing, I’m alive. Let’s see what’s this about?!” — exclaims he almost irritated on the black nothingness he was seeing, slowly in the far noticed shred of red-blue light, coming to him right. At the moment next, simply like someone pull the switch and Ivy witness the magical nature trick- looking at the deepest ocean florescent floor — corals, jellyfishes, shellfishes and many other fishes ware there, in lightning colors of yellow, green, and blue, moving and living in its own home.\\n\\n**“Now, my dear Ivy boy come right back up “ — heard he from the sky while going up on Pinky Cloud, “I would like to tell you a story, so just listen for a while. Here the story starts.**\\n\\nOne can find an anchor in a dream and follow reality silver line,\\n\\nDo not stop until you see and touch your dream is being material and alive at the same time. Usually, It’s never as it seems. Nor good nor bad. And things change, it’s perfectly O.K!\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*Jet feelings are the same — gratitude, joy and love You should share. \\\\*\\\\*There is just one rule you have to follow — do not let any hollow or shallow be your shadow.\\n\\nRemain true, respectful, and wisely choose, even spoken words are there to be used — everything is here to be used — in Higher Good.

There are here in the far because You created that. Work’s the same way another way around, if you know what I mean, dreaming can be scary or beautiful, depending on how one truly sees it. Do not be afraid now about that wolfs, my dear boy, I can smell that fear from afar — You are afraid of Yourself — accept how powerful You are, and be at peace with You knowing you’re dreaming huge for You, as much for others, too.

You got one life it’s worth, on Earth, dare to bloom while Sun warms you up, knowing how natural fertilizer smell’s like, it’s here only to make Your grow more up. **Be respectful about that. And it’s no joke all this story of mine, you know, take a look on the west now, please, and tell me what do you, my boy, see?”**\\n\\nIvy was for a second there fell asleep from this story, but he did not mind stretch his body to the west to see, and ooh, It’s a Tree on a Westside. A huge tree, only one in around. The grass was had white spots, but still red, mushrooms started to be color-changing instead, jet only one tree and a lot of huge eggs. “Question remains, why’s there glowing treetop on the west and what’s there? What did I build there?” — and just in a moment Ivy put that words in the air, he knew the answer, well this is his dream to dream too — “Treehouse, I wish to see! Can we go there, Dragon Eyes?”\\n\\n**“Takes no long for that dragonfly to come, in a blink of an eye, just like his name seas, Dragon Eyes!”** — celebrated the Ivy his victory and good friendship while friends wing clapped with sparkly ringing softly sound to make an exit fast. Off they go toward the tree and Ivy just could not believe the site he’s seeing. Up in the treetop branches, so high. And house so big with the bed in it, “I planned to build one exactly like that, but smaller one”- seas Ivy with no complaint at all, “So I’ll do it finally on my own!”\\n\\nThe echo of his voice woke him up from sleep — “Rhythm Bee, I had a dream! Let’s go find a tree!”\\n\\nBy the end of the day, Ivy had a halter, but under a tree, of his favorite fig tree. But the wind..blowhard and the rooftop just fell off.\\n\\nBoy was sad looking at the night’s sky, still wondering about the treehouse, and how to make it better next time, like the star he was looking at, spoke to him:\\n\\n**“Look now, sweet child, witness the magic pure as a heart full of fire,**\\n\\n**and one tree growth overnight to become what you truly desire. “**\\n\\nIvy waited, but nothing happens, and tired finally gets to him. In the morning the boy is shining and rising, and what a surprise to see: Its treehouse is made of tree branches itself, like tree choose to crumble them to make a little house on the tree, a beautiful morning for Ivy, **even better than the dream!**\\n\\n**[#poetry](https://yoo.rs/tag/poetry)[#story](https://yoo.rs/tag/story)[#storyteling](https://yoo.rs/tag/storyteling)[#ivyandislandoflovestories](https://yoo.rs/tag/ivyandislandoflovestories)**\",\"timestamp\":1634810203,\"title\":\"Ivy and the island of Love stories #3 — Ivy and Dreams Realm!\"},\"digest\":\"uCPPx1PVmj5qQOG9aPMUf9jItWxTKtNIKfeMAQZRdtQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xB4218984c104dA7b6F96877C3343150E23D4f5a0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"5UwzB5SRz0-Ex5geH0abDyURrtmfTWv7d4aGAS2JrI0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qs5bm6qZ8wHmYTNGVo9vyOu6KVyZwOZhE6bqnijyLBU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"T0lMtt4-X9k8GLTGCHJ7gBnKop9bdAEfDYykGgtZjZXidB3uHkkO5UgtLnHW2toqHVgMOtd4LaQLgD0aymdgRA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x87255f5d24a428b63e20eb5708610e1b9a18f05e91219c72dfb61b42fda189e8228d7592fc9b7332b6fbf762e6d0425e3eaa1bfea56c850abfd9c94c7b1e5ea21b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"5UwzB5SRz0-Ex5geH0abDyURrtmfTWv7d4aGAS2JrI0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qs5bm6qZ8wHmYTNGVo9vyOu6KVyZwOZhE6bqnijyLBU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"uCPPx1PVmj5qQOG9aPMUf9jItWxTKtNIKfeMAQZRdtQ\"}"
