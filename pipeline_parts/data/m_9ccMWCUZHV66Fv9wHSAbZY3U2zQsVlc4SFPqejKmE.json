"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"> Mirror World is a world of multiple games, a world of interoperable assets, a world of open economies, a world of imagination.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*5Ih_cpXyn4OhRUKO4aUSHw.png)\\n\\nMany people have asked me before: Does Play to Earn money grow on trees?\\n\\nYes. And no.\\n\\nPlay to earn is not a new term. A long time ago, in many games, many people played games to earn money. For example, World of Warcraft, or League of Legends. There are two ways to do this, one is by spending long hours in the game, earning a lot of game currency, resources, or materials, and then selling these things to other players for a profit in the form of cash transactions; one is to help other players rank to get a better season ranking, or help poorly equipped accounts to get high-level equipment.\\n\\nGold farmers have existed since the first day of online games. And until now, their business is still prosperous, and even organized professional organizations such as studios — the team owners provide the gold farmers with accommodation, computers, internet, and some other necessary inputs, and the only thing the gold farmers need to do every day is to play the game -. They enjoy a fixed salary and commission, no different from those white-collar workers sitting in office buildings.\\n\\nIs this your dream job, getting paid for playing games every day? But in reality, their life is not as easy as it seems. They are mainly troubled in three aspects, which are also the common problems of game companies in the Web 2.0 era.\\n\\n* Game companies enjoy absolute power over the game, and they can manipulate the value of equipment, material production, and tokens in the game at will. They can often bring down the entire economic system of the game through a random small modification;\\n* The income of a gold farmer is often strongly correlated with the number of players in the game. This is quite understandable because the income of the gold farmer comes from the payment of players. If there are fewer players in a particular game, the economic system will quickly collapse;\\n* On top of everything else, game companies often have a hostile attitude towards gold farmers — game companies want to make money, but gold farmers may reduce the willingness of other players to pay. Gold farmers are often at risk of being blocked — if they are blocked, all their assets will be wiped out.\\n\\nNo one has ever protected the rights of gold farmers, who have suffered many injustices, but no one has ever cared. They are like the grass on the side of the road. They provide greenery for the city objectively, but they suffer from people’s wanton trampling.\\n\\nBut the good thing is, even so, they can still earn a significant income through the game. By playing games, many people have earned their first life-changing fortune, including certain tycoons — like the rich Thai businessman Itthipat Peeradechapan, who accumulated his entrepreneurial fortune by playing games.\\n\\nTherefore, the first day when the blockchain game that preaches “Play to Earn” was born, it was greatly welcomed.\\n\\nRight now, I mean, as of the moment, as you read this article, there are hundreds of thousands on the planet that are earning money by playing games. Even if most of them don’t have a high level of education or gaming experience, the money they make through chain games is enough to provide for a family. And there are more and more people who are fleeing traditional games and turning to blockchain games.\\n\\nI don’t know if you’ve ever played any blockchain games, but if you know anything about them, you should be able to understand my opinion of them:\\n\\nThese blockchain games have no gameplay to speak of.\\n\\nThe vast majority of chain games you see on the market now are not even qualified to be called “games”. They have boring gameplay, simple UI, poor game graphics, and yet they dare to call themselves “games”. If these badly made games are in the APPSTORE, no one will take a second look at them. But this is also the most amazing part: even though these games are so boring, there are still a lot of people playing them, and a good part of the players are making money by playing them!\\n\\nThis is exactly where the appeal of blockchain games lies. Compared with traditional games, blockchain games have several main advantages:\\n\\n* Asset preservation, all assets can be exchanged for cash\\n* Assets are confirmed, blockchain technology can protect each player’s assets\\n\\nAnd the governance of blockchain games has a subversive difference from traditional games. In the past, game companies were the gods of the game and could do anything they wanted with impunity; **whereas blockchain game players living in Web 3.0 can personally participate in every decision about the game, and they are not only respected but also have power.**\\n\\nTherefore, even though blockchain games are currently mostly crudely made, they are already far better than traditional games as far as people who want to make money are concerned.\\n\\nHowever,\\n\\nWill such a game truly be enough?\\n\\nOf course not. In addition to the problem of crude production, the current blockchain games still haven’t managed to get rid of one important issue: the value of assets fluctuates drastically by the number of players. As we all know, all games have a life cycle, and if the game is no longer played by as many players, then all game assets will eventually be worthless — like Axie Infinity, for example, where almost every player can’t help but worry about the floor price of AXIE all day long.\\n\\nSo, this is what the Mirror World project team truly wants to do.\\n\\nWe want to make some blockchain games that are **sophisticated and well-made**. And please note that the definite word is “some” and not “one”, **we will completely solve the problem of “asset insecurity”, through the way of “asset interoperability”**.\\n\\nWhat is asset interoperability? Simply put, it means that\\\\*\\\\* the assets you have in one game can be used in another game.\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nIt’s relatively simple like tokens, where the money you earn in game A can be used directly in game B as well — but obviously, we’re not settling for that. \\\\*\\\\*What we want to do is to asset every character, equipment, prop, card, and everything in the game and allow every player to circulate them in any game. \\\\*\\\\*Like a character in an adventure game that you can control as an optional hero in another fighting game or a weapon in an RPG that you can play as a card in another card game.\\n\\nAnd we have designed an **economic framework that is open and inclusive enough to embrace game developers who will join us over time to create Mirror World.**\\n\\nWe have a grand plan for this and can’t wait to share it with more people, but, you know, there are a lot of scammers nowadays who easily raise a large amount of money by promoting the concept and then just disappear with no further progress of the project.\\n\\nAnd we firmly believe that **doing things on the ground is far more important than hyping concepts and visions**. So we don’t want to reveal too many details about the project until the game is finished and ready to go live. This way there will be more surprises in the future, right?\\n\\nWhat we can tell you is that we currently have very many types of games planned, and the first three games to go online will be:\\n\\n1, An AFK-like card adventure game;\\n\\n2, A wasteland-style simulation game;\\n\\n3, A Smash-like game full of spoof spirits — oh I personally like this one the most, the process of playing is quite fun.\\n\\nAnd in all games, assets that contain value attributes will include:\\n\\n1, Game characters.\\n\\n2, Non-character assets such as props and equipment.\\n\\n3, Tokens.\\n\\n4, Land.\\n\\nWe would love to welcome more players to join our games in the future, and we would love to provide careers for more people through our games, but it’s still too early.\\n\\nIf you’re interested, you’re welcome to stay tuned to Mirror World, and we’ll continue to update you more about the project in the coming period.\\n\\nWelcome aboard on a journey to a new world!\",\"timestamp\":1638157994,\"title\":\"Worlds As Games - Mirror World - Medium\"},\"digest\":\"PJcUf5ESUZR0_L8E2fAYrHkWfzjzgs3XX6-ZGsGz_sk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9219220269444aB10DA27BeBd17475edA40D43bb\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BMwwms1ZYx9hNFCEiq1EQew5PuMXq2pYsiULeqJqKas\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kuaylE4iQvR3Z-2RJYaTnGq6JLxiyN2jL0G7dpOfU4Q\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"NQcScxG5ll6asLloWxmwmTSCCwP5R5h1pTzQ06WN7-ZTA5wQ625JaMP7NgEk53X8_HNsLXm02BlzIXg9IIzTZw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x51d8e2eb07b59e8ac0214c6e77627ed7901ae8414c54021368391ba63d2b2a947e21dee38cdd58555c6d41708205956f834ef1b25e4c67bc5cc913d145e0ba151b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BMwwms1ZYx9hNFCEiq1EQew5PuMXq2pYsiULeqJqKas\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kuaylE4iQvR3Z-2RJYaTnGq6JLxiyN2jL0G7dpOfU4Q\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"PJcUf5ESUZR0_L8E2fAYrHkWfzjzgs3XX6-ZGsGz_sk\"}"
