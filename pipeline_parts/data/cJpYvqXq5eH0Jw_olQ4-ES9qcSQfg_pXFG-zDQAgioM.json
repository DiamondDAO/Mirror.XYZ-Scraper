It serves two main roles: governance, and staking to receive a share in network fees.\\n\\n## **Governance**\\n\\nAs Tempus moves towards full decentralization, TEMP holders will be responsible for governance.\\n\\nTEMP holders can propose changes to the protocol, including adjusting protocol-level fees, and either minting, or burning TEMP tokens. If TEMP holders don’t want to participate in governance, they will have the opportunity to delegate their voting rights.\\n\\nTEMP holders will be able to vote on how to spend funds that have accrued to the Tempus Treasury. Tempus will aim to participate as a liquidity provider in its own pools and build a significant treasury of diversified protocol-owned liquidity. This will also be controlled by TEMP holders.\\n\\n## **Staking to Receive Fees**\\n\\nTempus will earn fees from underlying trading activity in its pools. TEMP holders will be able to enable fees on deposits, withdrawals, and swaps on Tempus.\\n\\nA portion of these fees will accrue to the Tempus Treasury, while some of them will accrue directly to those who stake their TEMP for xTEMP. The exact staking and value accrual mechanism will be agreed upon by TEMP holders at a later date.\\n\\n## **TEMP Allocation**\\n\\n1 billion TEMP will be minted at genesis and will become made available over the course of three years. The initial three year allocation is as follows:\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*cqJwTD_B1fHAi-MG.png)\\n\\n*   52.00% to Tempus community members (see more detailed breakdown below) `520,000,000 TEMP`\\n*   26.00% to current and future team members with 3-year vesting (which starts after mainnet launch) `260,000,000 TEMP`\\n*   22.00% to investors and advisors with 2.5 to 3-year vesting (which starts after mainnet launch) `220,000,000 TEMP`\\n\\nToken inflation of 2% per year can be triggered by governance after 4 years. This is to make sure there is long-term development and community support available for Tempus.\\n\\nWe are strong believers in decentralization and we have allocated 52% of our initial token supply to benefit the whole Tempus ecosystem. In addition, we find it extremely important to properly incentivize the early community, users, liquidity providers, and other partners.\\n\\nThe 520,000,000 TEMP which is allocated to Tempus community members will be divided as follows:\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*8YBIZIxmTeSCoRrR.png)\\n\\n*   48.07% to liquidity mining and community incentives `250,000,000 TEMP`\\n*   38.46% to the Tempus Treasury `200,000,000 TEMP`\\n*   13.47% to our public token sale `70,000,000 TEMP`\\n\\nStay tuned for more details about our public token sale!\\n\\n## **TEMP Launch**\\n\\nWe’re excited to bring this update to our community of more than 7,000 users! We will be announcing the details of our token launch very soon so please stay tuned for announcements on this.\\n\\nIn the meantime, to learn more about Tempus, read our resources here:\\n\\n[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6gauHECShr) |[ Github](https://github.com/tempus-finance) |[ Medium](https://medium.com/@tempusfinance) |[ Twitter](https://twitter.com/tempusfinance) |[ Website](https://tempus.finance/)\\n\\n## **About Tempus**\\n\\nTempus will offer capital-efficient fixed rate yields and high variable yields on various assets. For example, Tempus will be the first team to release fixed rate ETH 2.0 staking through [Lido](https://lido.fi/). Tempus will also integrate with [Compound](https://compound.finance/), [Aave](https://aave.com/), [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/), and [Rari](https://rari.capital/).\\n\\nTempus is [live on Goerli testnet](https://testnet.tempus.finance/) and will be launching on mainnet next month. Join us on our journey to become the leading fixed-rate protocol in DeFi!\\n\",\"timestamp\":1640875372,\"title\":\"Introducing TEMP - tempus - Medium\"},\"digest\":\"1chTRDqyzQTSQieecaIL7LnqvtW2n_mk3sGMXMO8ldA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xec9c8676F97d6B8FD6972527E2A3B45B8f64A366\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JpbreEJZhaWzu4xE6HskBy_ItdFpT624SUr732XxYlc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"UODXNFhOCTh1THhYaBODz3XyUgdSI9FVuLzjwmdtBMo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"IqSXYNaQjjWPYxsTQb7b-pFXlngVnayJZxJ1Q5VkppMSs8_yACUNhN0nIUC-MC_YYtd_GAKpLgNtdY-D2TibzQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x243b08c56ec9ea4b72cbdd88aecd455342f3be17c4d227d6a278bf4e1c24b3394e25e2c9b13f46b8077775e2510954851763c9327a9640eb994a61045cc5ef121b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JpbreEJZhaWzu4xE6HskBy_ItdFpT624SUr732XxYlc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"UODXNFhOCTh1THhYaBODz3XyUgdSI9FVuLzjwmdtBMo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"1chTRDqyzQTSQieecaIL7LnqvtW2n_mk3sGMXMO8ldA\"}"
