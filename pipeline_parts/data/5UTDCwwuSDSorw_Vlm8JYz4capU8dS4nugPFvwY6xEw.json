Effortful, but not effective. Our purpose in this book is to deal with the pig of what is an urgent need for true innovation thinking. Our purpose is not to present new and shiny but essentially useless ways to put lipstick on the poor animal – the lipstick of glossy PR announcements, “corporate visioning” and high-profile conferences at which everyone agrees that, yes, innovation is a vitally important good thing and we must all do it. Speeches are made, brochures handed out, sponsors tick the audience numbers and everyone goes home happy to have “done innovation.” \\n\\nIf you are looking for ways to seed and sustain practical innovation thinking within your team, this book is for you – based, as it is, on practices, approaches and defining processes common in the creative industries, all designed to draw out the natural creativity of your team. Unfortunately, many company leaders still perform a sort of a complicated innovation dance, which may look interesting, but does not get them any closer to dealing with the hard work of implementing a programme which ensures that actual innovation will take place. Case in point: towards the end of 2016, after a year of correspondence just to arrange a time to meet, I finally got to make a presentation to (too) many of the decision makers of a large construction company that bills itself as the Apple of the construction business. They wanted to look at ways they could become more, you know, innovative. \\n\\nAnother month then went by and I was eventually told that they were “not going to pursue innovation this year.” An interesting statement, I thought, which opened up a whole raft of possibilities when trying to deconstruct its full significance. Quite how they defined being “the Apple of the construction business” is unclear and is in itself an indication of “innovation theatre” – pretending to innovate while trumpeting about it but not actually innovating very much at all.\\n\\nNot wanting to pursue innovation is fine, really. If that is what you wish, so be it. But that definition of the time period in which innovation was not going to be pursued really did puzzle me. Would they pursue it next year? If they were, did it not make sense to start to think about it at least? Would some other time bring the perfect conditions for innovation to ensue, perhaps? Conditions not present at the end of 2016 but perhaps expected to make themselves known around the end of 2017? Or 2018? What would need to happen for them to change their minds? I shall never know, probably, but the questions which the situation brought up were really useful in probing how we define innovation in traditional industries, especially those ripe for technological disruption, such as construction – where little productivity has been gained over the last five or six decades, in comparison to other industries. Entire industries are being disrupted by players who come in from outside of the circle of incumbents, proceed to direct their focus at solving one large problem at a time, and do not rest until it is done. \\n\\nI suspect, my not-quite client and their competitors and colleagues are in for an awakening, while waiting for perfect conditions for innovation to come around. Alas, there is no time left to ponder the question. In the very near future, the difference between great success and total irrelevance will be defined by how well companies integrate innovation as another standard business activity, next to planning and execution. We have done this with Total Quality Management. There is no reason, not to do it with Innovation.\\n\\nUnderstandably, the emotional state of the leadership is one of deep unease about innovation as a process, while being generally aware that it ought to be, at least, considered. Let them not think about it too long. The cold, hard reality is that the majority of companies operating today will not exist by half-way through the next decade. Those that survive will have altered how they work, and will be using many methods borrowed from the world of creative industries to fuel their internal innovation effort.\\n\\n### A time of, and for, visionaries\\n\\nVisionary leaders see the current rapidly changing context as a major, epochal, opportunity. This includes leaders of companies in traditional industries looking at the entire business as an opportunity to innovate, not just the production or marketing. John Beck, CEO of Canada’s major construction group Aecon, has been quoted as saying “There has always been a mismatch between the need for infrastructure assets and the capital to fund them. By leveraging all the remarkable innovations that have emerged in recent years, we have a new opportunity to narrow the gap.” An indication of how such composite leverage might be applied to infrastructure very soon comes from the American entrepreneur Elon Musk. As if he wasn’t quite busy enough rewriting the rules for the car industry, energy storage, mass transport and space travel, Musk looking at alternative infrastructure solutions. Having tweeted angrily in December 2016: “Traffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging...”\\n\\nAt the time of writing, in early 2017, his new venture was already working on solutions. Regardless of whether you consider it is a fundamentally good idea or not, if you think about it, it is entirely logical that he should be thinking about tunnels, given his existing interests. Hyperloop, the high-speed mass transport system is one long tunnel. SolarCity understands energy storage (and both the digging and the use of tunnels require a sophisticated understanding of energy.) SpaceX understands the economics of working with large, expensive projects and high-value components. And then there is Tesla, and the fact that electric vehicles require far less ventilation in tunnels than those powered by the internal combustion engine. Could this be used as a tactical tool; one cannot help but wonder? We can imagine the promotional texts: “Yes, you may use our tunnels but only if you drive an electric vehicle, and we happen to make some good ones...”\\n\\nThe opportunity to innovate may be focused on an individual issue, or it may be system–wide. If we see Musk’s new project as a technology company looking to solve an infrastructure problem, rather than an infrastructure company looking to solve problems with technology, we will also realise that the odds of the game are suddenly stacked against every incumbent, not least because their unspoken line of defence – regulation and compliance – is also under attack. Car industry, mass transport, energy and space travel are all heavy with regulation. Having dealt with those authorities in all those areas obviously makes the prospect of dealing with people responsible for infrastructure not a particularly intimidating prospect for Musk’s new tunnel venture.\\n\\nTo be able to connect all those apparently disparate components and ideas, individuals and companies need to think creatively, in ways well beyond those that have allowed them to get to where they are now. A culture of innovation is what is required in organisations if they are, indeed, to narrow that gap, to use John Beck’s words, and to catapult themselves into the next stage of development. This is a book about the reasons why a culture of creativity and innovation is vital, and the ways to start and sustain such a culture. It outlines an organic methodology of making it happen. It is not a book of “brilliant new brainstorming techniques”. Rather, we will be looking at practical suggestions of how to subtly redesign your company and its culture to deal with the rapidly shifting context that surrounds us, so you can deal more effectively with the tectonic shifts in where and how value is created, stored and consumed. Nor is it a book of futuristic predictions. I find those particularly difficult for a writer, since we live in a world where such predictions become reality faster than the ink with which they are printed can dry. What is required to succeed in this world is a whole new mindset, one based on creativity as a strategic asset and imagination as a tactical weapon. That is what we will be working on in this book.\\n\\n### Not all is well in Innovation Land\\n\\nUnfortunately, however, as much as “innovation” has been put on a pedestal, enshrined in corporate vision statements and funded by private, state and transnational investors alike, most companies continue to do the thing they have always done, in the way they have always done it. The norm continues to be happily trumpeting innovation as the magic potion to cure all ills while doing little to foster real innovation thinking. Countless events, exultant magazine articles and blog posts by overexcited government agency wonks have inflated the expectations of many and given them a hunger for innovation in its pure, uncut form. As for satisfying that hunger, or even coming close to setting down workable principles that lead to unlocking innovation, things are less than rosy. We keep talking about innovation while hanging on to the coattails of the status quo. The central premise of this book, and the methodology which it outlines, concentrate on the need for, and ways to nurture, a network of highly connected individuals who emerge within your company. Curious and creative, these people will be your agents of change in the context of rapid digital transformation. As we go through the reasons why constant innovation is the new normal, where to look for it, and how to sustain it, it will become progressively more and more clear that such an internal network of people is your best defence against the four riders of the digital apocalypse: Complacency, Inattention, Myopia and the big ugly monster, Hierarchic Thwarter of Imagination.\\n\\n### This book is for...\\n\\nThis is a book for leaders who want to install innovation thinking right into the heart of what their companies do, and are looking for a practical way to do it. It is not a book for those looking for a quick fix, because there aren’t any. Though I do have a quick piece of advice for you: if anybody tells you that they have that magic bullet, run. You are about to be robbed.\\n\\nFour key components of what we call creativity have been identified through research over the last few decades: the creative person, the creative process, the creative situation and the creative product. The last item on this list is entirely up to you. The first three we will work on in this book.\\n\\nWe will also work through the relationship of creativity (which is set of thought processes) to innovation (which looks for results.) Many executives and decision makers have been aware for a long time that innovation should be a tangible thing, set in a “real” process, but have not been able to put their finger on the right way to start. Others have started, perhaps multiple times, but the effort has not yielded quite the results that were hoped for.\\n\\nThe aim of this book is to describe methods and approaches which may help your organisation’s processes of innovation begin to be self-sustaining and, indeed, self-propelling: where the effort required to innovate can be concentrated on speeding towards the horizon, not on constantly looking for the gas pedal, or the steering wheel. It does not, of course, mean that you will be able to put innovation on auto pilot, as that is not ever going to be possible, but our aim here is to find out where and how innovation thinking can happen naturally. The time to begin is now. Every company that does not consciously create a functioning and sustainable culture of innovation within the next few years will be staring at the abyss before too long, as technology will change business more in the next few decades than it has in the last few centuries. As branding and innovation consultant Filiberto Amati commented to me in a recent conversation: “When you rely on market research to predict the future, and not on creative intuition and insight, research is modelled around insights from the past an the abyss is right in front of you.”\\n\\nThis is a book for leaders of those companies who are noticing that demand is softening, that they are finding it difficult to recruit “the right people” (more difficult than usual; recruitment is tough on a good day), that there is this feeling of something very large and very important changing. This is a book about processes which can help bring positive change in the long run.\\n\\n…\\n\\nInstalment 02 coming on January 30.\",\"timestamp\":1642700869,\"title\":\"The Pig not the Lipstick: 01\"},\"digest\":\"JxYxH1ZlyzK4rtinNeg2LBdn5ITafhPkTpmf2jUOXGM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x105dA96d744B68972D591037DE7A243ec1a05d20\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bappbACVhXAu5sekIN58MGuzfTtOn-GZ5eOcTRPEtbc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"otTEurrG9CWngkWUsMPlsDeuZIXs4yXFku7XGEPtV2E\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"cVwBn1GM_ba2dMSSQzMtaFXMrjy8Qd-ZleKxj8HGsTRA-rH9qt6igufB9T2L8dHDwTlSH-tjkrY98Abu90zsug\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xefc0f68e024a635d1d086edea418c4baba006bdf4f4e831a25180c666bfbffcb24e96612c0afcbe870225f3272ce566ed489cb9758495458751fccd5d408115a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bappbACVhXAu5sekIN58MGuzfTtOn-GZ5eOcTRPEtbc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"otTEurrG9CWngkWUsMPlsDeuZIXs4yXFku7XGEPtV2E\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"JxYxH1ZlyzK4rtinNeg2LBdn5ITafhPkTpmf2jUOXGM\"}"
