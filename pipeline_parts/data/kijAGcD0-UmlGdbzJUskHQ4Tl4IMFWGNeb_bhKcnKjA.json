"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"2876, Mars, The Peace Summit \\n\\nThe Great War took millions of lives. It upended vestiges of an older global order. The insurance against war promised by the royal houses was an illusion. A debtor nation of former colonists began its ascent as world leader. Victors pressed hard at the peace table for money, and laid the seeds for new horrors to come. Everyone wanted peace and quiet. The victors' people wanted fun.\\n\\nAn empty peace began, a dead man's zone between the trenches of 1914 and 1939's Maginot Line.\\n\\nYEAR 2X21 MINUS 45, MARS\\n\\nThe Treaty of Mars was consecrated on the Whole'Chain and its protocols were executed Systemwide. The Long War was over and the mess was being settled as fast as possible.\\n\\nJacob C. Tagore, Sr. stepped onto the dais, to face the leadership, civilian and military, of Mars.\\n\\n\\\"Commander, in recognition of your service, we confer upon you the medal, Protector of Mars. Your people, your world...\\\"\\n\\nTrapped by formalities in the ballroom, Jacob found a table.\\n\\n\\\"Jacob.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"June. Sit down. You look lovely.\\\"\\n\\nDr. June Birmingham, former director of the Musk Shipyards, was dressed in Mars formal. Jacob flashed his medal. She smiled. Medals were cheaper than money and pensions.\\n\\n\\\"A hearty handshake too, June.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Jacob, he wants to talk to you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. He killed my boy. Everyone was doing their duty, I don't care. the “great” Dr. John C. Cadmus should rot.”\\n\\n”How many times did he save your life, since the Academy?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's why I haven't killed him. You might be saying the right words but I don't feel that way.\\\"\\n\\nThere was talk of a \\\"Grand Vote\\\" to reduce ship traffic to prevent a new war. \\n\\nBesides, advances in the Whole'Verse could provide escapism and employment for billions. Many hoped to abandon their bodies and live on the Stream instead. Jacob and June were surrounded in a sea of people who wanted peace, quiet and fun.\",\"timestamp\":1633969393,\"title\":\"2921: 3.11 An Empty Peace, 2876\"},\"digest\":\"iANrUEo0g5g3Fno-1hjEFwmEoO0R9YMNUx6htStfWqA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Lgvmux3ZOGuzTGMlPfpWuj1X3P5M0Cz4uGHYJdGAqvBZ2byVZKy9fuANrrpqQWFD4ZAD8mbDoHB7DpWzpnyeTg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"BU4fzPTYvmkXhbddoWy3lkpLpCnUlKY7v4w9LLZ1waY\"}"
