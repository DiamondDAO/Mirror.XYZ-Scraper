"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"of the tenderness generally accorded to an invalid.\\n\\n\\\"You have not asked him?\\\" Tom said to his mother shortly afterwards. \\\"Not yet, my dear. His mind is so disturbed by this unfortunate affair.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And is not my mind disturbed? You may tell him that I will not go, though he should turn me out a dozen times, unless I know more about it than I do now.\\\"\\n\\nSir Thomas came home again that evening, very sour in temper, and nothing could be said to him. He was angry with everybody, and Lady Tringle hardly dared to go near him, either then or on the following morning. On the Tuesday evening, however, he returned somewhat softened in his demeanour. The millions had perhaps gone right, though his children would go so wrong. When he spoke either to his younger daughter or of her he did so in that jeering tone which he afterwards always assumed when allusion was made to Captain Batsby, and which, disagreeable as it was, seemed to imply something of forgiveness. And he ate his dinner, and drank his glass of wine, without making any allusion to the parsimonious habits of his son-in-law, Mr Traffick. Lady Tringle, therefore, considered that she might approach him with Tom's request.\\n\\n\\\"You go to Stalham!\\\" he exclaimed.\\n\\n\\\"Well, my dear, I suppose I could see her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And what could you learn from her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't suppose I could learn much. She was always a pigheaded, stiff-necked creature. I am sure it wouldn't be any pleasure to me to see her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What good would it do?\\\" demanded Sir Thomas.\\n\\n\\\"Well, my dear; he says that he won't go unless he can get a message from her. I am sure I don't want to go to Stalham. Nothing on earth could be so disagreeable. But perhaps I could bring back a word or two which would make him go upon his journey.\\\" \\\"What sort of word?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why -- if I were to say that she were engaged to this Colonel Stubbs, then he would go. He says that he would start at once if he knew that his cousin were really engaged to somebody else.\\\" \\\"But if she be not?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps I could just colour it a little. It would be such a grand thing to get him away, and he in this miserable condition! If he were once on his travels, I do think he would soon begin to forget it all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course he would,\\\" said Sir Thomas.\\n\\n\\\"Then I might as well try. He has set his heart upon it, and if he thinks that I have done his bidding then he will obey you. As for turning him out, Tom, of course you do not really mean that!\\\"\\n\\nIn answer to this Sir Thomas said nothing. He knew well enough that Tom couldn't be turned out. That turning out of a son is a difficult task to accomplish, and one altogether beyond the power of Sir Thomas. The chief cause of his sorrow lay in the fact that he, as the head of Travers and Treason, was debarred from the assistance and companionship of his son. All Travers and Treason was nothing to him, because his son would run so far away from the right path. There was nothing he would not do to bring him back. If Ayala could have been bought by any reasonable, or even unreasonable, amount of thousands, he would have bought her willingly for his boy's delight. It was a thing wonderful to him that Tom should have been upset so absolutely by his love. He did appreciate the feeling so far that he was willing to condone all those follies already committed if Tom would only put himself in the way of recovery. That massacreing of the policeman, those ill-spent nights at the Mountaineers and at Bolivia's, that foolish challenge, and the almost more foolish blow under the portico at the Haymarket, should all be forgiven if Tom would only consent to go through some slight purgation which would again fit him for Travers and Treason. And the purgation should be made as pleasant as possible. He should travel about the world with his pocket full of money and with every arrangement for luxurious comfort. Only he must go. There was no other way in which he could be so purged as to be again fit for Travers and Treason. He did not at all believe that Ayala could now be purchased. Whether pigheaded or not, Ayala was certainly self-willed. No good such as Tom expected would come from this projected visit to Stalham. But if he would allow it to be made in obedience to Tom's request -- then perhaps some tidings might be brought back which, whether strictly true or not, might induce Tom to allow himself to be put on board the ship. Arguing thus with himself, Sir Thomas at last gave his consent.\\n\\nIt was a most disagreeable task which the mother thus undertook. She could not go from Merle Park to Stalham and back in one day. It was necessary that she should sleep two nights in London. It was arranged, therefore, that she should go up to London on the Thursday; then make her journey down to Stalham and back on the Friday, and get home on the Saturday. There would then still remain nearly a fortnight before Tom would have to leave Merle Park. After much consideration it was decided that a note should be written to Ayala apprising her of her aunt's coming. \\\"I hope Lady Albury will not be surprised at my visit,\\\" said the note, \\\"but I am so anxious to see you, just for half an hour, upon a matter of great importance, that I shall run my chance.\\\" She would prefer to have seen the girl without any notice; but then, had no notice been given, the girl would perhaps have been out of the way. As it was a telegram was received back in reply. \\\"I shall be at home. Lady Albury will be very glad to see you at lunch. She says there shall be a room all ready if you will sleep.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I certainly shall not stay there,\\\" Lady Tringle said to Mrs Traffick, \\\"but it is as well to know that they will be civil to me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They are stuck-up sort of people I believe,\\\" said Augusta; \\\"just like that Marchesa Baldoni, who is one of them. But, as to their being civil, that is a matter of course. They would hardly be uncivil to anyone connected with Lord Boardotrade!\\\"\\n\\nThen came the Thursday on which the journey was to be commenced. As the moment came near Lady Tringle was very much afraid of the task before her. She was afraid even of her niece Ayala, who had assumed increased proportions in her eyes since she had persistently refused not only Tom but also Colonel Stubbs and Captain Batsby, and then in spite of her own connexion with Lord Boardotrade -- of whom since her daughter's marriage she had learned to think less than she had done before -- she did feel that the Alburys were fashionable people, and that Ayala as their guest had achieved something for herself. Stalham was, no doubt, superior in general estimation to Merle Park, and with her there had been always a certain awe of Ayala which she had not felt in reference to Lucy. Ayala's demand that Augusta should go upstairs and fetch the scrap-book had had its effect -- as had also her success in going up St Peter's and to the Marchesa's dance; and then there would be Lady Albury herself -- and all the Alburys! Only that Tom was very anxious, she would even now have abandoned the undertaking.\\n\\n\\\"Mother,\\\" said Tom, on the last morning, \\\"you will do the best you can for me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes, my dear.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do think that, if you would make her understand the real truth, she might have me yet. She wouldn't like that a fellow should die.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am afraid that she is hardhearted, Tom.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do not believe it, mother. I have seen her when she wouldn't kill even a fly. It she could only be made to see all the good she could do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am afraid she won't care for that unless she can bring herself really to love you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why shouldn't she love me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, my boy; how am I to tell you? Perhaps if you hadn't loved her so well it might have been different. If you had scorned her -- \\\"\\n\\n\\\"Scorn her! I couldn't scorn her. I have heard of that kind of thing before, but how is one to help oneself? You can't scorn a friend just because you choose to say so to yourself. When I see her she is something so precious to me that I could not be rough to her to save my life. When she first came it wasn't so. I could laugh at her then. But now -- ! They talk about goddesses, but I am sure she is a goddess to me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you had made no more than a woman of her it might have been better, Tom.\\\" All that was too late now. The doctrine which Lady Tringle was enunciating to her son, and which he repudiated, is one that has been often preached and never practised. A man when he is conscious of the presence of a mere woman, to whom he feels that no worship is due, may for his own purpose be able to tell a lie to her, and make her believe that he acknowledges a divinity in her presence. But, when he feels the goddess, he cannot carry himself before her as though she were a mere woman, and, as such, inferior to himself in her attributes. Poor Tom had felt the touch of something divine, and had fallen immediately prostrate before the shrine with his face to the ground. His chance with Ayala could in no circumstances have been great; but she was certainly not one to have yielded to a prostrate worshipper.\\n\\n\\\"Mother!\\\" said Tom, recalling Lady Tringle as she was leaving the room.\\n\\n\\\"What is it, my dear? I must really go now or I shall be too late for the train.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mother, tell her, tell her -- tell her that I love her.\\\" His mother ran back, kissed his brow, and then left the room.\\n\\nLady Tringle spent that evening in Queen's Gate, where Sir Thomas remained with her. The hours passed heavily, as they had not much present to their mind with which to console each other. Sir Thomas had no belief whatever in the journey except in so far as it might help to induce his son to proceed upon his travels -- but his wife had been so far softened by poor Tom's sorrows as to hope a little, in spite of her judgment, that Ayala might yet relent. Her heart was soft towards her son, so that she felt that the girl would deserve all manner of punishment unless she would at last yield to Tom's wishes. She was all but sure that it could not be so, and yet, in spite of her convictions, she hoped.\\n\\nOn the next morning the train took her safely to the Stalham Road Station, and as she approached the end of her journey her heart became heavier within her. She felt that she could not but fail to give any excuse to the Alburys for such a journey -- unless, indeed, Ayala should do as she would have her. At the station she found the Albury carriage, with the Albury coachman, and the Albury footman, and the Albury liveries, waiting for her. It was a closed carriage, and for a moment she thought that Ayala might be there. In that case she could have performed her commission in the carriage, and then have returned to London without going to the house at all. But Ayala was not there. Lady Tringle was driven up to the house, and then taken through the hall into a small sitting-room, where for a moment she was alone. Then the door opened, and Ayala, radiant with beauty, in all the prettiness of her best morning costume, was in a moment in her arms. She seemed in her brightness to be different from that Ayala who had been known before at Glenbogie and in Rome. \\\"Dear Aunt,\\\" said Ayala, \\\"I am so delighted to see you at Stalham!'\\n\\nCHAPTER 55 IN THE CASTLE THERE LIVED A KNIGHT\\n\\nAyala was compelled to consent to remain at Stalham. The \\\"I don't think\\\" which she repeated so often was, of course, of no avail to her. Sir Harry would be angry, and Lady Albury would be disgusted, were she to go -- and so she remained. There was to be a week before Colonel Stubbs would come, and she was to remain not only for the week but also for some short time afterwards -- so that there might be yet a few days left of hunting under the Colonel. It could not, surely, have been doubtful to her after she had read that letter -- with the postscript -- that if she remained her happiness would be ensured! He would not have come again and insisted on her being there to receive him if nothing were to come of it. And yet she had fought for permission to return to Kingsbury Crescent after her little fashion, and had at last yielded, as she told Lady Albury -- because Sir Harry seemed to wish it. \\\"Of course he wishes it,\\\" said Lady Albury. \\\"He has got the pony on purpose, and nobody likes being disappointed when he has done a thing so much as Sir Harry.\\\" Ayala, delighted as she was, did not make her secret known. She was fluttered, and apparently uneasy -- so that her friend did not know what to make of it, or which way to take it. Ayala's secret was to herself a secret still to be maintained with holy reticence. It might still be possible that Jonathan Stubbs should never say another word to her of his love. If he did -- why then all the world might know. Then there would be no secret. Then she could sit and discuss her love, and his love, all night long with Lady Albury, if Lady Albury would listen to her. In the meantime the secret must be a secret. To confess her love, and then to have her love disappointed -- that would be death to her!\\n\\nAnd thus it went on through the whole week, Lady Albury not quite knowing what to make of it. Once she did say a word, thinking that she would thus extract the truth, not as yet understanding how potent Ayala could be to keep her secret. \\\"That man has, at any rate, been very true to you,\\\" she said. Ayala frowned, and shook her head, and would not say a word upon the subject. \\\"If she did not mean to take him now, surely she would have gone,\\\" Lady Albury said to her husband.\\n\\n\\\"She is a pretty little girl enough,\\\" said Sir Harry, \\\"but I doubt whether she is worth all the trouble.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course she is not. What pretty little girl ever was? But as long as he thinks her worth it the trouble has to be taken.\\\" \\\"Of course she'll accept him?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am not at all so sure of it. She has been made to believe that you wanted her to stay, and therefore she has stayed. She is quite master enough of herself to ride out hunting with him again and then to refuse him.\\\" And so Lady Albury doubted up to the Sunday, and all through the Sunday -- up to the very moment when the last preparations were to be made for the man's arrival. The train reached the Stalham Road Station at 7 p.m., and the distance was five miles. On Sundays they usually dined at Stalham at 7.30. The hour fixed was to be 8 on this occasion -- and even with this there would be some bustling. The house was now nearly empty, there being no visitors there except Mr and Mrs Gosling and Ayala. Lady Albury gave many thoughts to the manner of the man's reception, and determined at last that Jonathan should have an opportunity of saying a word to Ayala immediately on his arrival if he so pleased. \\\"Mind you are down at half past seven,\\\" she said to Ayala, coming to her in her bedroom.\\n\\n\\\"I thought we should not dine till eight.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is no knowing. Sir Harry is so fussy. I shall be down, and I should like you to be with me.\\\" Then Ayala promised. \\\"And mind you have his frock on.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You'll make me wear it out before anyone else sees it,\\\" she said, laughing. But again she promised. She got a glimmer of light from it all, nearly understanding what Lady Albury intended. But against such intentions as these she had no reason to fight. Why should she not be ready to see him? Why should she not have on her prettiest dress when he came? If he meant to say the word -- then her prettiest dress would be all too poor, and her readiest ears not quick enough to meet so great a joy. If he were not to say the other word -- then should she shun him by staying behind, or be afraid of the encounter? Should she be less gaily attired because it would be unnecessary to please his eye?\\n\\nOh, no! \\\"I'll be there at half past seven,\\\" she said. \\\"But I know the train will be late, and Sir Harry won't get his dinner till nine.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then, my dear, great as the Colonel is, he may come in and get what is left for him in the middle. Sir Harry will not wait a minute after eight.\\\"\\n\\nThe buxom woman came and dressed her. The buxom woman probably knew what was going to happen -- was perhaps more keenly alive to the truth than Lady Albury herself. \\\"We have taken great care of it, haven't we, Miss?\\\" she said, as she fastened the dress behind. \\\"It's just as new still.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"New!\\\" said Ayala. \\\"It has got to be new with me for the next two years.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know much about that, Miss. Somebody will have to pay for a good many more new dresses before two years are over, I take it.\\\" To this Ayala made no answer, but she was quite sure that the buxom woman intended to imply that Colonel Stubbs would have to pay for the new dresses.\\n\\nPunctually at half past seven she was in the drawing-room, and there she remained alone for a few minutes. She endeavoured to sit down and be quiet, but she found it impossible to compose herself. Almost immediately he would be there, and then -- as she was quite sure -- her fate would be known to her instantly. She knew that the first moment of his presence in the room with her would tell her everything. If that were told to her which she desired to hear, everything should be re-told to him as quickly. But, if it were otherwise, then she thought that when the moment came she would still have strength enough to hide her sorrow. If he had come simply for the hunting -- simply that they two might ride a-hunting together so that he might show to her that all traces of his disappointment were gone -- then she would know how to teach him to think that her heart towards him was as it had ever been. The thing to be done would be so sad as to call from her tears almost of blood in her solitude; but it should be so done that no one should know that any sorrow such as this had touched her bosom. Not even to Lucy should this secret be told.\\n\\nThere was a clock on the mantelpiece to which her eye was continually turned. It now wanted twenty minutes to eight, and she was aware that if the train was punctual he might now be at the hall door. At this moment Lady Albury entered the room. \\\"Your knight has come at last,\\\" she said; \\\"I hear his wheels on the gravel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is no knight of mine,\\\" said Ayala, with that peculiar frown of hers.\\n\\n\\\"Whose ever knight he is, there he is. Knight or not, I must go and welcome him.\\\" Then Lady Albury hurried out of the room and Ayala was again alone. The door had been left partly open, so that she could hear the sound of voices and steps across the inner hall or billiard-room. There were the servants waiting upon him, and Sir Harry bidding him to go up and dress at once so as not to keep the whole house waiting, and Lady Albury declaring that there was yet ample time as the dinner certainly would not be on the table for half an hour. She heard it all, and heard him to whom all her thoughts were now given laughing as he declared that he had never been so cold in his life, and that he certainly would not dress himself till he had warmed his fingers. She was far away from the door, not having stirred from the spot on which she was standing when Lady Albury left her; but she fancied that she heard the murmur of some slight whisper, and she told herself that Lady Albury was telling him where to seek her. Then she heard the sound of the man's step across the billiard-room, she heard his hand upon the door, and there he was in her presence! When she thought of it all afterwards, as she did so many scores of times, she never could tell how it had occurred. When she accused him in her playfulness, telling him that he had taken for granted that of which he had had no sign, she never knew whether there had been aught of truth in her accusation. But she did know that he had hardly closed the door behind him when she was in his arms, and felt the burning love of his kisses upon her cheeks. There had been no more asking whether he was to have any other answer. Of that she was quite sure. Had there been such further question she would have answered him, and some remembrance of her own words would have remained with her. She was quite sure that she had answered no question. Some memory of mingled granting and denying, of repulses and assents all quickly huddled upon one another, of attempts to escape while she was so happy to remain, and then of a deluge of love terms which fell upon her ears -- \\\"his own one, his wife, his darling, his Ayala, at last his own sweet Ayala,\\\" -- this was what remained to her of that little interview. She had not spoken a word. She thought she was sure of that. Her breath had left her -- so that she could not speak. And yet it had been taken for granted -- though on former occasions he had pleaded with slow piteous words! How had it been that he had come to know the truth so suddenly? Then she became aware that Lady Albury was speaking to Mrs Gosling in the billiard-room outside, detaining her other guest till the scene within should be over. At that moment she did speak a word which she remembered afterwards. \\\"Go -- go; you must go now.\\\" Then there had been one other soft repulse, one other sweet assent and the man had gone. There was just a moment for her, in which to tell herself that the Angel of Light had come for her, and had taken her to himself.\\n\\nMrs Gosling, who was a pretty little woman, crept softly into the room, hiding her suspicion if she had any. Lady Albury put out her hand to Ayala behind the other woman's back, not raising it high, but just so that her young friend might touch it if she pleased. Ayala did touch it, sliding her little fingers into the offered grasp. \\\"I thought it would be so,\\\" whispered Lady Albury. \\\"I thought it would be so.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What the deuce are you all up to?\\\" said Sir Harry, bursting into the room. \\\"It's eight now, and that man has only just gone up to his room.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He hasn't been in the house above five minutes yet,\\\" said Lady Albury, \\\"and I think he has been very quick.\\\" Ayala thought so too.\\n\\nDuring dinner and afterwards they were very full of hunting for the next day. It was wonderful to Ayala that there should be thought for such a trifle when there was such a thing as love in the world. While there was so much to fill her heart, how could there be thoughts of anything else? But Jonathan -- he was Jonathan to her now, her Jonathan, her Angel of Light -- was very keen upon the subject. There was but one week left. He thought that Croppy might manage three days as there was to be but one week. Croppy would have leisure and rest enough afterwards. \\\"It's a little sharp,\\\" said Sir Harry.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, pray don't,\\\" said Ayala.\\n\\nBut Lady Albury and Jonathan together silenced Sir Harry, and Mrs Gosling proved the absurdity of the objection by telling the story of a pony who had carried a lady three days running. \\\"I should not have liked to be either the pony, or the owner, or the lady,\\\" said Sir Harry. But he was silenced. What did it matter though the heavens fell, so that Ayala was pleased? What is too much to be done for a girl who proves herself to be an angel by accepting the right man at the right time?\\n\\nShe had but one moment alone with her lover that night. \\\"I always loved you,\\\" she whispered to him as she fled away. The Colonel did not quite understand the assertion, but he was contented with it as he sat smoking his cigar with Sir Harry and Mr Gosling. But, though she could have but one word that night with her lover, there were many words between her and Lady Albury before they went to bed. \\\"And so, like wise people, you have settled it all between you at last,\\\" said Lady Albury.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know whether he is wise.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We will take that for granted. At any rate he has been very true.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you -- you knew all about it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No -- I knew nothing. I did not think he would ever ask again. I only hoped.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But why on earth did you give him so much trouble?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can't tell you,\\\" said Ayala, shaking her head.\\n\\n\\\"Do you mean that there is still a secret?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, not that. I would tell you anything that I could tell, because you have been so very, very good to me. But I cannot tell. I cannot explain even to myself. Oh, Lady Albury, why have you been so good to me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Shall I say because I have loved you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes -- if it be true.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But it is not true.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Lady Albury!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do love you dearly. I shall always love you now. I do hope I shall love you now, because you will be his wife. But I have not been kind to you as you call it because I loved you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then why?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because I loved him. Cannot you understand that? Because I was anxious that he should have all that he wanted. Was it not necessary that there should be some house in which he might meet you? Could there have been much of a pleasant time for wooing between you in your aunt's drawing-room in Kingsbury Crescent?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no,\\\" said Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"Could he have taken you out hunting unless you had been here? How could he and you have known each other at all unless I had been kind to you? Now you will understand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Ayala, \\\"I understand now. Did he ask you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well -- he consulted me. We talked you all over, and made up our minds, between us, that if we petted you down here that would be the best way to win you. Were we not right?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It was a very nice way. I do so like to be petted.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sir Harry was in the secret, and he did his petting by buying the frock. That was a success too, I think.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did he care about that, Lady Albury?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What he?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Jonathan,\\\" said Ayala, almost stumbling over the word, as she pronounced it aloud for the first time.\\n\\n\\\"I think he liked it. But whether he would have persevered without it you must ask yourself. If he tells you that he would never have said another word to you only for this frock, then I think you ought to thank Sir Harry, and give him a kiss.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am sure he will not tell me that,\\\" said Ayala, with mock indignation. \\\"And now, my dear, as I have told you all my secret, and have explained to you how we laid our heads together, and plotted against you, I think you ought to tell me your secret. Why was it that you refused him so pertinaciously on that Sunday when you were out walking, and yet you knew your mind about it so clearly as soon as he arrived today?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can't explain it,\\\" said Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"You must know that you liked him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I always liked him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You must have more than liked on that Sunday.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I adored him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then I don't understand you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lady Albury, I think I fell in love with him the first moment I saw him. The Marchesa took me to a party in London, and there he was.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did he say anything to you then?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. He was very funny -- as he often is. Don't you know his way? I remember every word he said to me. He came up without any introduction and ordered me to dance with him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you did?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh yes. Whatever he told me I should have done. Then he scolded me because I did not stand up quick enough. And he invented some story about a woman who was engaged to him and would not marry him because he had red hair and his name was Jonathan. I knew it was all a joke, and yet I hated the woman.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That must have been love at first sight.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think it was. From that day to this I have always been thinking about him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And yet you refused him twice over?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"At ever so long an interval?\\\" Ayala bobbed her head at her companion. \\\"And why?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah -- that I can't tell. I shall try to tell him some day, but I know that I never shall. It was because  -- . But, Lady Albury, I cannot tell it. Did you ever picture anything to yourself in a waking dream?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Build castles in the air?\\\" suggested Lady Albury. \\\"That's just it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very often. But they never come true.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Never have come true -- exactly. I had a castle in the air, and in the castle lived a knight.\\\" She was still ashamed to say that the inhabitant of the castle was an Angel of Light. \\\"I wanted to find out whether he was the knight who lived there. He was.\\\" \\\"And you were not quite sure till today?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have been sure a long time. But when we walked out on that Sunday I was such an idiot that I did not know how to tell him. Oh, Lady Albury, I was such a fool! What should I have done if he hadn't come back?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sent for him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Never -- never! I should have been miserable always! But now I am so happy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is the real knight?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes; indeed. He is the real -- real knight, that has always been living in my castle.\\\"\\n\\nAyala's promotion was now so firmly fixed that the buxom female came to assist her off with her clothes when Lady Albury had left her. From this time forth it was supposed that such assistance would be necessary. \\\"I take it, Miss,\\\" said the buxom female, \\\"there will be a many new dresses before the end of this time two years.\\\" From which Ayala was quite sure that everybody in the house knew all about it.\\n\\nBut it was now, now when she was quite alone, that the great sense of her happiness came to her. In the fulness of her dreams there had never been more than the conviction that such a being, and none other, could be worthy of her love. There had never been faith in the hope that such a one would come to her -- never even though she would tell herself that angels had come down from heaven and had sought in marriage the hands of the daughters of men. Her dreams had been to her a barrier against love rather than an encouragement. But now he that she had in truth dreamed of had come for her. Then she brought out the Marchesa's letter and read that description of her lover. Yes; he was all that; true, brave, tender -- a very hero. But then he was more than all that -- for he was in truth the very \\\"Angel of Light\\\".\\n\\nCHAPTER 56 GOBBLEGOOSE WOOD AGAIN\\n\\nThe Monday was devoted to hunting. I am not at all sure that riding about the country with a pack of hounds is an amusement specially compatible with that assured love entertainment which was now within the reach of Ayala and her Angel. For the rudiments of love-making, for little endearing attentions, for a few sweet words to be whispered with shortened breath as one horse gallops beside another, perhaps for a lengthened half hour together, amidst the mazes of a large wood when opportunities are no doubt given for private conversation, hunting may be very well. But for two persons who are engaged, with the mutual consent of all their friends, a comfortable sofa is perhaps preferable. Ayala had heard as yet but very little of her lover's intentions -- was acquainted only with that one single intention which he had declared in asking her to be his wife. There were a thousand things to be told -- the how, the where, and the when. She knew hitherto the why, and that was all. Nothing could be told her while she was galloping about a big wood on Croppy's back. \\\"I am delighted to see you again in these parts, Miss,\\\" said Larry Twentyman, suddenly.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Mr Twentyman; how is the baby?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The baby is quite well, Miss. His mamma has been out ever so many times.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I ought to have asked for her first. Does baby come out too?\\\" \\\"Not quite. But when the hounds are near mamma comes for an hour or so. We have had a wonderful season -- quite wonderful. You have heard, perhaps, of our great run from Dillsborough Wood. We found him there, close to my place, you know, and run him down in the Brake country after an hour and forty minutes. There were only five or six of them. You'd have been one, Miss, to a moral, if you'd have been here on the pony. I say we never changed our fox.\\\"\\n\\nAyala was well disposed towards Larry Twentyman, and was quite aware that, according to the records and established usages of that hunt, he was a man with whom she might talk safely. But she did not care about the foxes so much as she had done before. There was nothing now for which she cared much, except Jonathan Stubbs. He was always riding near her throughout the day, so that he might be with her should there arise anything special to be done; but he was not always close to her -- as she would have had him. He had gained his purpose, and he was satisfied. She had entered in upon the fruition of positive bliss, but enjoyed it in perfection only when she heard the sound of his voice, or could look into his eyes as she spoke to him. She did not care much about the great run from Dillsborough, or even for the compliment with which Mr Twentyman finished his narrative. They were riding about the big woods all day, not without killing a fox, but with none of the excitement of a real run. \\\"After that Croppy will be quite fit to come again on Wednesday,\\\" suggested the Colonel on their way home. To which Sir Harry assented.\\n\\n\\\"What do you folks mean to do today?\\\" asked Lady Albury at breakfast on the following morning. Ayala had her own little plan in her head, but did not dare to propose it publicly. \\\"Will you choose to be driven, or will you choose to walk?\\\" said Lady Albury, addressing herself to Ayala. Ayala, in her present position, was considered to be entitled to special consideration. Ayala thought she would prefer to walk. At last there came a moment in which she could make her request to the person chiefly concerned. \\\"Walk with me to the wood with that absurd name,\\\" suggested Ayala. \\\"Gobblegoose Wood,\\\" suggested the Colonel. Then that was arranged according to Ayala's wishes.\",\"timestamp\":1639991675,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"You start on the nineteenth,\\\" said Sir Thomas.
