Smart contracts, zk-snarks, quadratic voting, non fungible tokens, lending pools, stable coins.\\n\\nIn the next posts I'll try to distill the most recent and promising whitepapers and point to some \\\"reasonable asymmetric bets\\\" ([Subscribe to receive the updates](https://amaca.substack.com/subscribe?)). With that I mean tokens and projects that could return 10x in a few years. I think the crypto market will go down when the the interest rates rise, but there will be nonetheless great opportunities for the patient investor.\\n\\nBut today I'll just run an experiment.\\n\\n**Try to come up with words, any word.** Then prepend or append \\\"coin\\\", “NFT” or \\\"token\\\" to that word and Google it.\\n\\nThese are the words that came up to me:\\n\\n* park => [coinpark.com](http://coinpark.com/): it's a digital assets trading platform\\n* box => [nftboxes.io](https://www.nftboxes.io/): *amazing NFTs every month*\\n* fun => [fun token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/funtoken/): online gambling token of some sort\\n* mark=> [coinmarks.io](http://coinmarks.io/): used to be an exchange\\n* pickle => [pickle.finance](https://www.pickle.finance/): *\\\"Pickle Finance helps users to maximize their DeFi yields by auto-compounding their rewards, saving them time and gas\\\"*\\n* car => not found\\n* sand => [sandbox.game](https://www.sandbox.game/en/about/sand/): SAND token for the Sandbox “ecosystem”\\n* coyote => [coyote.ai](https://www.coyote.ai/): Blockchain analysis company\\n* burp => [coinburp.com](https://www.coinburp.com/): Crypto exchange, I kid you not.\\n* tree => [cointree.com](https://www.cointree.com/): Australian crypto exchange\\n* rope => [ropesolana.com](https://ropesolana.com/): *A next gen ecosystem* apparently. *\\\"$ROPE is a full-scale decentralized ecosystem that brings the well known \\\"market volatility index\\\" to the crypto market”*\\n* truck => [TruckCoin token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/truckcoin/) and [Crypto Trucks NFT](https://opensea.io/collection/crypto-trucks)\\n* duck => [duckdao.io](https://duckdao.io/): *\\\"Who will win? A VC or a thousand ducks?\\\".* Can't make this up.\\n\\nSome of these are obvious scams, but some are legit recent projects with big teams.\\n\\nI probably biased it for short words, which of course work much better. Anyhow, this should give us a sense of how big and wild the crypto space is right now.\\n\\nNFTs especially are very frothy right now.\\n\\nWhen you start seeing crypto ads on billboards in New York or in the London underground, you might be in a bubble:\\n\\n![Irresponsible&#39; London Underground Bitcoin advert banned - BBC News](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14e97fb3-ecd6-4498-aee3-9b3036ca65ee_2048x1530.jpeg)\\n\\n![Seen on the London tube this March morning - feels properly mainstream  already : r/Crypto_com](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78537524-9d25-460d-b408-04df8ceaac9d_3750x2109.jpeg)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1636289183,\"title\":\"Proof of Excitement\"},\"digest\":\"Mi_SRrwJ61iPxSMDvwbCapUkRxHRVZ8lNqZVKzsxGgA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xC5661cA45A6e7370775Ee2c9C1F66Be899762E72\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hvlXy6vWimxpSmNEB-34aDaGJGxNGAFgTIRLNV2CMdM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xlcGgGUqeqz5TJSD0R3qzIcZP9uf4gCgonRq1outwVE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"2B-TIZfXBY2ZQaJ-1aAGpDnhM4BBYDUFCkwq5tHl22BW2X7FIth02ayK0kHVJGGWlkUjVfRDL7bHxcLZShkIWQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0d51253736726540de66a92df03205181105e952cfd25ac071a77ee9fbe8440f483270c611fe7d31b69cb70cbe3a2354d0ebd67758976a7c16e6adecd63cbc5c1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hvlXy6vWimxpSmNEB-34aDaGJGxNGAFgTIRLNV2CMdM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xlcGgGUqeqz5TJSD0R3qzIcZP9uf4gCgonRq1outwVE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Mi_SRrwJ61iPxSMDvwbCapUkRxHRVZ8lNqZVKzsxGgA\"}"
