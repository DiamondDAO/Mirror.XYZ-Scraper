"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## We must save Elektra. \\n\\nIn the faraway world of Elektra, **music is energy**. And it is dying. \\n\\nLuckily, a brave group of explorers — nay, *warriors* — grabbed Portal Tickets one month ago and jumped through the Portal to Elektra to help save her from extinction. \\n\\nSince then, they have been journeying through the world of Elektra and learning about its history. They've also managed to collect 3 Energy Capsules along their way. \\n\\nToday, **these brave warriors have unlocked 3 songs that were hidden on Elektra by a mysterious group called *The Zeph***. These songs have been placed into the Energy Capsules, which is the first big step in saving Elektra from extinction! \\n\\nWe now have the honor of getting to know some of the mysterious members of *The Zeph*, and get a small taste of the divine sonic masterpieces they hid in this world.\\n\\n***These 3 songs [will premiere on auction](https://elektra.camp/#/) as 1/1 Catalog NFTs, Monday August 16th at 4pm ET.

They are relatively younger members of the Zeph. They have never spoken, and only communicate to themselves and others through music. Initially they were coddled and talked down to as they were mistaken as lost and weak due to their silence. Through their music they eventually demanded respect and are now valued as some of the strongest, most capable members of the Zeph. Upon leaving Elektra they devoted themselves to creating music that encourages others to communicate their truth in whatever medium they wish. \\n\\nINSPIRED BY: Communicating truth confidently. \\nSONG HIDDEN IN: Sound\\n\\n**Water Signs' \\\"Don't Worry\\\" is created by [Kathleen Regan](https://twitter.com/kathleenrmusic), [Tyler Lombard](https://www.instagram.com/tylerlombardmusic/) and [Yuri Beats](https://twitter.com/Yuri_Beats).**\\n\\n**Water Signs Capsule visual credits:**\\nCapsule Model by [Porke](https://twitter.com/PorkeDesign) \\n3d Render and Animation by [Metsä](https://twitter.com/madebymetsa)\\nCapsule Contents illustration by [Private Woman](https://twitter.com/privatewoman777)\\nCapsule Contents animated by [Ivana](https://twitter.com/ive77i)\\nType Design by [Peace Node](https://twitter.com/peace_node)\\n\\n## Finch-3S - “Outer Boroughs”\\n\\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/4528)\\n\\nFinch is a member of the Zeph who cloned himself and sent the clones to different planets/timelines in the hopes that they would be able to garner the unique experiences of each planet’s inhabitants, and create music to bring back and restore Elektra.
