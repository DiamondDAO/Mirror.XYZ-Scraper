"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Since the successful completion of the Twin Flames #49 Party Bid, and the precipitous drop in price of $FLAMES tokens, you may have some questions. My goal is to provide some more clarity to what is going on, and express some personal opinions as to the future of RAW DAO by addressing some common questions.\\n\\n## What is a $FLAMES\\n\\nOne $FLAMES token, is one very small fraction of the total *ownership* of the Twin Flames #49 NFT. You received $FLAMES tokens in proportion to the amount of ETH you contributed to the total purchase price of the piece following a tiered system outlined by the RAW DAO. An explanation of this tiered system is available in the public #party-bid-faq channel on the discord.\\n\\n## Why are $FLAMES trading for so much less\\n\\nIf anyone ever gives you a definitive answer as to “Why” a token price has gone up or down, they’re either a swindler or very naive. So I’ll try to provide some clarity, knowing full well that it’s probably a combination of many reasons.\\n\\n1. $FLAMES are a speculative proportional value of the piece of art purchased. They are ***not*** equal to the purchase price.\\n2. Twin Flames #49 was not worth 850ETH (The final purchase price). Membership to the DAO for 300+ people ***plus*** the artwork itself was worth 850ETH. They were linked on purpose for marketing (cool use of Party Bid) and fund raising for RAW DAO.\\n3. Paradoxically, the more people who purchased a fraction of Twin Flames #49 hoping to immediately flip it, the quicker and more intense the initial price drop would be.\\n4. People who sold their $FLAMES immediately do not believe the resale price will be greater than the purchase price ever, or by the time they will need that liquidity again.\\n\\n## How do $RAW tokens increase in value\\n\\nYour $RAW tokens are a proportional ownership stake in the RAW DAO. The value of the token and the value of the DAO are linked. Additionally, beyond a certain $RAW token threshold, you are given governance rights. This means that you will be able to play an important part in shaping the direction of this DAO\\n\\nTo increase the value of $RAW you must increase the value of RAW DAO. I cannot speak for the DAO, because the DAO is a collection of hundreds of individuals, so this is not exactly how it will pan out, but just ***some personal ideas*** on how it could.\\n\\n1. Additional fund raising.\\n2. Purchasing appreciating assets. In this case photography NFTs.\\n3. Sell “access” NFTs or hold in person events.\\n4. Use a portion of treasury funds to capture DeFi yields\\n5. Hold appreciating currencies, ETH\\n\\nRAW DAO can also be seen as a marketing lever for many up and coming artists. Giving them exposure, a crowd of loyal advocates (DAO members) and strong brand association. As such I see the following scenarios as possible win-wins:\\n\\n1. Onboard new artists to the DAO, take a small commission for each sale make while a part of the DAO.\\n2. Write into the smart contracts a small 1-2% royalty to be paid to the DAO.\\n3. Purchase a few pieces of each artist drop at a discount from the artists themselves\\n\\n## How Does RAW DAO actually help photographers?\\n\\nThere is more to this world than simply increasing the size of our wallets, and in this case the size of the treasury. The purpose, as explicitly stated of RAW DAO is to:\\n\\n> “RAW is a new photography-focused DAO bootstrapped by Fingerprints DAO and top photographers, with the aim to curate the best collection and build the best community in the space, where artists, collectors and art enthusiasts can gather to discuss, curate and produce the best art.”\\n\\nAnother description was the following:\\n\\n> “To become the largest collection of historically important and influential photography in the world by the end of this decade.”\\n\\nSo it appears that first, and most centrally, RAW DAO will be building an extensive collection. As a result, many artists will be directly financially supported. It would also make sense, and be in the best interest of the DAO, to expand the popularity of photography NFTs in general. This has the capacity to not only advance the interest of the DAO, but photographers at large.\\n\\nDoes this turn into something more explicit in the future, rather than strictly “support by patronage”? Only time will tell, but I don’t think it’s off base to imagine the DAO supporting artists through equipment purchases, education on how to create NFTs, and donating to art foundations or schools. \\n\\n## Final Thoughts\\n\\nRAW DAO was just created, and it’s still in its infancy. As a member of the DAO it’s now your responsibility to see this organization grow and realize its potential.\\n\\nThe reason this organization was “DAO-ified” is because your voice and your perspective are valuable. It may immediately appear to you what you have to offer, or how you can contribute to the DAO in general, but stay a part of the conversation and the opportunity will present itself.\",\"timestamp\":1637771397,\"title\":\"Thoughts on RAW DAO\"},\"digest\":\"Zuvmxs7hv_xAr6JcQJnY4SF5cgxViJCUFUeWLAZ5zLo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x405b7b42C0F700b4D83Cdd1a565a1c21EDdE3310\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"d_Y0lOX1Y3DOxdB9Bgqy6lmCTV0SWIfll-VD590Q9Ps\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"VB0moj8ip6OqW5uri18lIt8jlLq9tjooFAteLCNF868\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"WGFoQY3xtNp1kt_hXjri-A8pPKcNgVBDBphz1-TT5LjhM9kvyMUozGZKJUWSzSicscrOA0dqrlKrw8ItJDpu7w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5a3db9ee064a35c5a2b7fa0f9372408d7bcba5f75e64c8f6cd4cb7d0b13ee9417b0de2b29f3a449b182a16e3f8aaeef907f28d6695e21dd663f38e6b89b0cf581b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"d_Y0lOX1Y3DOxdB9Bgqy6lmCTV0SWIfll-VD590Q9Ps\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"VB0moj8ip6OqW5uri18lIt8jlLq9tjooFAteLCNF868\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"JuBMi1zAUpdtXg7xcnSW2OqiYCMH7DqWAGenUDlkLx8\"}"
