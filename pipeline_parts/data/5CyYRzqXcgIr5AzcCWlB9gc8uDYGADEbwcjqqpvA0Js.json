For this reason, the Brazilian artist creates unruly images and sounds in a place of disobedience and makes their works a counter-hegemonic fissure, liberating themself in subjectivities.\\n\\nFind them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/occult3d), [Foundation](https://foundation.app/@occulted) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/occulted/).\\n\\n***\\n\\n## About MintFund\\n\\nMintFund is a community project created with the sole purpose to build a support network for artists interested in bringing their art into the world of NFTs/cryptomedia. MintFund provides artists with the funds to mint NFTs (known as gas costs), and offers guidance, mentorship and advice for the growing community of cryptomedia artists.
