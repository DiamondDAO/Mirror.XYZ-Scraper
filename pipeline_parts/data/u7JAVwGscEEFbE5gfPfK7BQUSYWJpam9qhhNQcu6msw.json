[CertiK has now raised over $140 million](https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-security-firm-certik-raises-37m-to-combat-defi-and-crypto-risks) over the past four months, [bringing](https://twitter.com/Cointelegraph/status/1427601365468020746) its valuation closer to $1 billion, the company said.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/Cointelegraph/status/1427601365468020746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1427601365468020746%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fblockchain-security-firm-certik-approaches-unicorn-status-following-80m-raise](https://twitter.com/Cointelegraph/status/1427601365468020746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1427601365468020746%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fblockchain-security-firm-certik-approaches-unicorn-status-following-80m-raise)\\n\\nThe cash infusion will be used by CertiK to further expand its product suite, especially in the software-as-a-service, or SaaS, market, according to company co-founder professor Ronghui Gu. The company is currently developing new SaaS products centered around security auditing, formal verification and the protection of client blockchain and smart contracts.\\n\\nCertiK has seen its revenue grow by 20 times over the past year as more blockchain companies look to safeguard their infrastructure against active threats. Professor Gu told Cointelegraph that the growing demand for security services is a byproduct of wider crypto adoption and continued innovation in the industry. \\\"Rapid development to market for these \\\\[crypto\\\\] projects opens up susceptibility to exploits, and attacks,\\\" he said, adding that \\\"securing these projects against such exploits is — more than ever — an important element of the project development process.”\\n\\nA key element of securing these emerging networks is blockchain and smart contract auditing, which Professor Gu described as a \\\"rigorous process that involves \\\\[a\\\\] review of the code implementation\\\" before a project is launched. He continued:\\n\\n>  \\\"In the blockchain world, code is law and enforces the logic of transactions. Code implementation, however, is not trustworthy and may contain bugs that lead to vulnerabilities. As an example of a vulnerability \\\\[...\\\\] Take a look at the DAO exploit which is related to a recursive pattern vulnerability and resulted in a $150 million hack.\\\"\\n\\nThe growth of decentralized finance, or DeFi, appears to have elevated the risk blockchain companies and users face in this rapidly evolving market. DeFi has become infamous for its multi-million-dollar exploits, [token distribution bugs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/compound-supply-bug-mistakenly-rewarded-users-with-70m-in-tokens) and unforeseen errors. Cointelegraph documented a total of [169 blockchain hacking incidents](https://cointelegraph.com/news/cointelegraph-consulting-recounting-2021-s-biggest-defi-hacking-incidents) in the year through November, which resulted in nearly $7 billion in lost funds. DeFi exploits were all too common.\\n\\n***Related: [How to enhance DeFi security](https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-enhance-defi-security)***\\n\\n![The explosive growth of DeFi has made the sector a prime target for cybercriminals.
