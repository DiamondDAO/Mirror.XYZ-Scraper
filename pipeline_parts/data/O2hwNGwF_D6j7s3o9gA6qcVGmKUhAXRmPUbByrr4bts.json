This is what we can call the familiar picture of things broadly understood. Thus, the initial point of the story takes place at a scale we are already inhabiting in our ordinary and quotidian picture of the world. We can call this the scale zero of any terrestrial story.\\n\\nThe film then scales up this familiar picture every ten seconds, from one square meter to ten square meters, then one hundred and then one thousand, until it reaches 100 million light years. By this simple procedure of adding a zero to our index of scale-length every ten seconds, we soon find ourselves at the brink of an empty universe littered with scanty piles of dust we call galaxies. \\n\\nThe film then reverses direction and hurtles back towards the couples at the Michigan lakeside. This time we scale down from a patch of the man’s skin to the scale of elementary particles and scales for which we have not yet developed robust and confirmed theories of physics. \\n\\n![Stills from \\\"Powers of Ten\\\".

We will begin by talking about artificial intelligence and general intelligence as we know them today. This is the scale zero of our dialogue. From our ordinary understanding of intelligence, we can move up and down the scales. We will assess the idea of AI and general intelligence at political and trans-generational levels as we travel higher in scales. At the same time, we’ll begin to talk about intelligence at lower scales such as neural and biochemical levels. Our commitment is to nothing but drastic shifts in perspective when it comes to talking about intelligence. \\n\\nSuch changes of perspective demand us to engineer new concepts—more refined, more fruitful and more robust—for the scale at which we address the problems. Conceptual engineering that replaces or repairs our everyday concepts with better ones will be a guiding principle in our exploration.\\n\\nAll in all, this book promises to deal with the questions of artificial intelligence and general intelligence using a host of different perspectives at different scales, from the question of modeling complex phenomena to planetary-scale engineering, education and global pedagogy, trans-generational politics to the intersection of the computational mind and the social mind.\\n\\nWhat happens when the social account of mind meets the computational account of mind, when we realize that we have always been artifacts of our decisions, thoughts and actions?\\n\\n[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0)\\n\",\"timestamp\":1621779734,\"title\":\"Negarestani on \\\"Conversations\\\"\",\"publication\":\"r\"},\"digest\":\"EE2uDL07IpVHbbBjZCKqf2Zoc_nFWsmPS1uOGg-oWBE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xc46E9a66FDdC8D1a69529d86E668236f02957F1b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2gOreeFuSTzHTbTHh9VLYOVAbQObud6uGR8QKO8hX68\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mIcvZP41c-qLBmjZN1LVVaBuBBW6rZ4AdumfCBqht0c\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"KBtd9s0QC2n7GO_N6kjn_zyFEUd0JoIamIFCrVuO4EvsBRb89onYb6Q4L0TGqC9vDjB_OwxEzOjMc5w_V7gQMQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa12ba6931bea4c7bc2184de485923a78b6af767e47b5366ba29378cf7e8f474c40cd9c51f95dc6b0f445745db5e88230c78ae1e3421b36703b7d474fbda0c57f1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on r.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2gOreeFuSTzHTbTHh9VLYOVAbQObud6uGR8QKO8hX68\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mIcvZP41c-qLBmjZN1LVVaBuBBW6rZ4AdumfCBqht0c\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"zghnOjS2aVlowlZ5D7ocnswHVSLSe04ZG-ubaMFBHmI\"}"
