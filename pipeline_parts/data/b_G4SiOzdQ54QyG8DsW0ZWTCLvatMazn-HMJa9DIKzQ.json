"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Hello everyone.\\n\\nWelcome to my space to learn and explore. I’m going to write about the topics I’m interested in to help distill my thoughts and guide my learning. I think of this blog as a repository of information I think is cool. Currently, that focus is on Web3, crypto, NFTs, and other decentralized tech. Looking forward to diving in with you all.\\n\\n## Why does gas matter?\\n\\nGas is what allows the Ethereum network to function. It is the currency of work on the blockchain. Without gas, miners would not be paid for the computational effort they provide when validating blocks. Additionally, gas provides a deflationary mechanism to balance the uncapped supply of Ethereum.\\n\\n## What is gas?\\n\\nGas is a transaction fee for any operation on the blockchain. It is denoted in gwei, which is 0.000000001 ETH. Gwei is a unit of ETH measurement, similar to the relationship between kilometers and meters.\\n\\nGas occurs when there is a computation on the blockchain. Examples of transactions necessitating computation are: transferring ETH to a different wallet, making purchases, minting NFTs, listing NFTs for sale and so on.\\n\\n### How is gas calculated?\\n\\nGas is made up of two parts:\\n\\n* Base fee\\n* Tip (priority fee)\\n\\nGas is calculated as follows:\\n\\n```\\nGas = (gas units * base fee) + (gas units * tip)\\n```\\n\\nThe **base fee** is the fee per unit of computation. Think of this as the cost that the gas station shows on their sign. The base fee ETH is burned (destroyed) on every transaction.\\n\\nThe **tip** is what compensates the miners for the computation they provide. The higher the tip, the quicker your transaction will be completed. Because the base fee is burned in a transaction and the miners can only be paid through tipping, they prioritize transactions with higher tips. A tip occurs per gas unit (more gas units burned, higher tip).\\n\\n**Gas units** correspond to the amount of computational power needed to complete a transaction. Some transactions are more complicated than others and need more gas to complete.\\n\\n### An analogy for thinking about gas\\n\\nWhen I think of gas, I think of taking a bus ride on a greyhound-like bus. You need to pay the bus driver for the gas they burn on the trip. That cost would be the price of gas multiplied by the gallons of gas used on your trip. Additionally, the bus driver likes to make money, so they demand a tip per mile driven. If you want to get picked up sooner, you need to offer a higher per-mile tip.\\n\\n**In summary**, gas is what makes the ETH network function, providing miners with incentives to continue mining. It also allows for an economically efficient deflationary mechanism to ETH’s uncapped supply and an option for higher-priority transactions that need to go through more quickly. Without gas, we would not have crypto!\",\"timestamp\":1634511595,\"title\":\"Ethereum Gas - A Primer\"},\"digest\":\"u7WUn_zQ2gt_WmMZUqggpFEhMN83Nl1ffVNJ5MlLxM0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9840a0d53944936144ff2DD85a43acFD68cd4cC6\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ps6Nr77lzv2yYjJovdfpKB_p3kKi3vTCJvLZLKOL3m0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"bgCDnrFWslsP2VQD2I2NXYFUbG1ee0sHM9rYgO_U8ME\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"hRCd6Q1j-WmqDi9e6Iy8VifcXYmACFQUfpsRlKxtfQaAPSBaxUbnGJxhveiI19xi8s2HHy3NLro7kEXd-xO9Zg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x68477b828e6c0084d9c49b62f6ce7b0802d576203c87c5488eafc8864c65ef5c645c7bdc584cac9d96ca08bb1ffbdd0ad4a3b5e7af3acf4bae3fcbbb5fd33e3c1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ps6Nr77lzv2yYjJovdfpKB_p3kKi3vTCJvLZLKOL3m0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"bgCDnrFWslsP2VQD2I2NXYFUbG1ee0sHM9rYgO_U8ME\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"fnQgvZeF7lvjtC9ZBwH6y785s458r5MDmZ7s_s-_M4M\"}"
