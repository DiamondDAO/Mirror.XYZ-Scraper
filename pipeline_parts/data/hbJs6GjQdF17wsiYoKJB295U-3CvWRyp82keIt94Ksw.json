Is there also any minimum amount to hold requierement?\\n\\nernst\\nGnosis\\n13d\\nGNO on Gnosis Chain \\\\[xDai\\\\] counts! No minimum amount (I think – @Anna?) but proportional to your holdings ofc.\\n\\n2 Replies\\n1\\n\\njosakiras\\n13d\\nThanks. Im asking becuse i have bought GNO on xDAI (i swapped on cowswap last week), about $50 of GNO, if thats enough and if xdai is ok.\\n\\njosakiras\\n\\nernst\\n13d\\nWhere can i stake GNO please? i read that i can be entitled to all airdrops if i stake\\n\\nernst\\nGnosis\\n11d\\nThere are instructions for staking here 37 :ok_hand:.\\n\\n2 Replies\\n1\\n\\nStraightForWard\\n\\n1\\n9d\\nGiven these numbers, it seems unlikely that more than 3M GNO will ever be needed to maintain a thriving Gnosis ecosystem\\n\\n“The possibility to burn the remaining GNO should be considered.”\\n\\nI have to agree, this idea is quiet appealing. That 7M GNO as you state above is most likely not needed, and all it would bring on us is heavy inflation. Instead, we should cut the max supply to the 3M GNO stated above. Even that sounds more than enough for Gnosis to develope forward.\\nSo many ex-stake holders were afraid of holding GNO long term due Gnosis has a lot of inflation that can negatively impact the price. I have a bad mouth taste when I am thinking about that too, as an investor, it simply a lot more appealing, if the 3M GNO max supply cut would happen & get a greenlight by the community. It is truly a good chance to grow the community, and bring back those ex- xdai community members who were afraid of that heavy \\\\~85% inflation on the GNO supply.\\nWould be wise, to do it asap, before they find something else more appealing. The bigger our Gnosis community, the better goals we can achieve. Waiting is not the best option atm, the more we wait, the less we can bring back, and the whole point was merging the communities too. Great chances to be the ‘canary network for eth’ in the upcoming months!\\nBtw: This is the best written proposition I ve seen yet. Thank you ernst :slight_smile:\\n\\n4\\n\\nitsencrypted\\n\\nernst\\n4d\\nthanks for the reply. I’m also interested in staking my GNO. However, no docker experience here and no idea of how to start.\\nI think I can do the bridging part as a developer. Is there any validator delegation I could do as a noob?\\n\\nCan I stake on Mainnet?\\n\\nHavenmeester\\n3d\\nThanks for the post about the utility! For the validator part, do I understand correctly that to be a validator on the GBC a piece of hardware and some technical understanding is needed to do this? Is there some more information about this how to start from scratch (step 1: which hardware do I need).\\nAre there ideas for some pools so that also the non-technical users can deposit their GNO and be a validator? Or are there more ways to utilize GNO?\\n\\nViszla\\n1d\\nVery soon a [DappNode.io](http://DappNode.io) package will be released, which will allow a much-simplified validator user experience for everyone.\\n\\nDo we have a timeline for this release? Personally very interested in staking on the GNO beacon chain and would love to use a simplified DappNode program rather than CLI. It would probably also make sense to have DappNode setup a telegram channel for those interested. Avado already has one with people pushing the team there to release a package (although they seem at capacity so one is not imminent)\\n\\nLanski\\n19h\\nHey @Viszla! The package is already operational and there’s a dedicated channel in the DAppNode Discord Server 2 bridged to the Gnosis Chain http s://discord.gg/ gnosischain server too (can’t put too many links).\\nYou can follow this guide 3 to set it up, but you if you get stuck at doing the deposits, know that there’s a webUI coming up that’s going to make this step easier!\\n\\n1 Reply\\n1\\n\\neveryday\\n17h\\nHi, is it possible to stake GNO without running a validator? Or it will be only after the merge? Amazing job!\\n\\n1 Reply\\n\\nViszla\\n\\nLanski\\n16h\\nAmazing, thanks! Looking forward to spinning up many a validator. Love the work being done and really glad to support the chain early.\\n\\nViszla\\n\\neveryday\\n16h\\nEventually centralized services might start offering staking (ie as coinbase does for the beacon chain) and there could even be decentralized services (like rocket pool) but i believe at this point we are so early its validating on your own hardware or nothing. Feel free to correct if anyone knows differently or knows plans in the works.\\n\\nykplayer8\\n13h\\nFor GNO Token holders the snapshot will be taken January 9th. If you want to participate in the potential airdrop of COW Tokens, you must swap your STAKE on January 9th at the latest (you have time until January 9th midnight UTC). All GBC validators will be eligible, as well as following LP Token holders:\\n\\nBalancer v2 (Mainnet)\\nUniswap v3 (Mainnet)\\nHoneySwap (GnosisChain)\\nSymmetric (GnosisChain)\\nSwapr (GnosisChain)\\nElk (GnosisChain)\\nSushiSwap (GnosisChain)\\nCould we add Balancer (Arbitrum) LP to the list too?\\n\\norhnkyr07\\n\\nernst\\n10h\\nIs there any other easy method for staking ? I really could not do it and also I joined to Gnosisdao what should I do to participate of dao airdrop ?\\n\\nReply\\nSuggested Topics\\nTopic\\tReplies\\tViews\\tActivity\\nShould Gnosis DAO partner with DXdao and jointly work on Omen\\nGnosisDAO\\nphase-1\\n2\\t629\\tJan 21\\nNext GnosisDAO Community Call: Monday, September 27 at 16:00 CEST/10:00 EST\\nGnosisDAO\\ncommunity-call\\n1\\t108\\tSep 29\\nSeeking team and grant\\nGnosisDAO\\n0\\t43\\t15d\\nNext GnosisDAO Community Call: Monday, September 13 at 16:00 CEST/10:00 EST\\nGnosisDAO\\ncommunity-call\\n0\\t147\\tSep 7\\nUnable to link multiple apps to Gnosis Safe via WalletConnect\\nSupport\\n0\\t146\\tJun 9\\nWant to read more?
