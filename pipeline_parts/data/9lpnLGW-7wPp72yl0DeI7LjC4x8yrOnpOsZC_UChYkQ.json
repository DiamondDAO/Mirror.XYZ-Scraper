"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## **1. buzzing**\\n\\nWhen we’re talking about web3, we are buzzing on p2p context, decentralized network, immutable infrastructure, code theory, network coding scheme, consensus mechanism , dapp, smart contract, layer 2 construction, cryptographic best practices, DiFi, NFT, blockchain interoperability, privacy and anonymizing, etc.\\n\\nHere I choose several topics and make a glance.\\n\\n## 1.1 p2p context and code theory\\n\\nThere are four types of coding:\\n\\n* [Data compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression) (or *source coding*)\\n* [Error control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction) (or *channel coding*)\\n* [Cryptographic coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography)\\n* [Line coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_code)\\n\\nNow let’s make a new-tech prediction on data compression and Error control.\\n\\nwe’ll have improved fixed-length codes\\\\*\\\\* \\\\*\\\\*known as “hashes”, new variable-length coding strategies for  NFT items and adaptive error control  algorithm.\\n\\n## 1.2 decentralized network issues\\n\\nWill a lower price for peering and traffic improve the eco-system?\\n\\n## 1.3 immutable infrastructure  and  software distribution\\n\\nCommonly, immutable infrastructure in a p2p system  are  known as hash address.\\n\\n**[Email is our only reliable communication method between different organizations.](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/\\\\~cks/space/blog/tech/EmailCriticalInfrastructure)**\\n\\nWill a web3 email immutable infrastructure make sense?\\n\\nIn case of software distribution, I learn a lot from the arch linux community and think that it’s urgent for web3 to improve the usability on interactivity of building open source software.\\n\\nWhen we build the immutable infrastructure, can we consider to provide with some mutable version?\\n\\n## 1.4   Consensus\\n\\nThere are dozen of Consensus mechanism.\\n\\nNakamoto consensus looks more like some fundamentalism.\\n\\nEthereum’s Proof of stake (PoS) attracts more gold rushes.\\n\\n## 1.5   privacy and anonymizing\\n\\nWe always care bout privacy and anonymizing.\\n\\nBut most time people on the web are too vulnerable to fade tracking and the lynchpin.\\n\\nWhat left is theoretically impossible and computationally unworthy.\\n\\nOK, **let’s bypass it**.\\n\\n## 2. Web3 in the community\\n\\nWeb3 in the community sounds like a **decentralisation movement.**\\n\\nThere’re two\\\\*\\\\* \\\\*\\\\*Ideological decentralization that was promoted by many sociologists and economists.\\n\\n* Libertarian socialism\\n* Free market\\n\\n**I don’t want to say too much about them**.\\n\\nI just make an alert that  web3 adopter should beware that  any strategy implementation  should not  destroy  the economy and impoverish people.\\n\\nIn the near future,  maybe there’re web3 organisations like  telecom operators,  even dedicated chip and  special operation system.\\n\\n## 3. The void art\\n\\nNew art forms that comes with NFTs may be in style of games or other interactive media.\\n\\nAt a first glance,  I thought  that NFT was some glitch art.\\n\\nFor example, [missing.no](http://missing.no/) ,  due to the programming of certain in-game events, pokemon players can encounter MissingNo. via a glitch.\\n\\nWhen I check more and more NFT assets, I see the void and make a second thought.\\n\\nMost people don’t create art to make a professional career.\\n\\nIn most theme, people act as what fill in the void.\\n\\nSo I call it the void art.  People  are more likely immersed in some kind of time and space, the vibe, sampling  emotions.\\n\\nNFTs state an established work of [fanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MissingNo.#cite_note-27) \\\\[fan canon\\\\].\\n\\n## 4. The business model and product strategy\\n\\n## 4.1  The internet is broken\\n\\n\\\"The web is broken,\\\" GW - because it is\\n\\nincreasingly becoming a slave to corporate and establishment interests, raising barriers, enforcing limitations, slowing innovation, and creating a new class of rent-seeking 'aristocracy.'\\n\\nThe web is full of [Disciplinary Power and Consumer](http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/11679/volumes/e05/E-05).\\n\\nThe reality is more and more  disciplinary techniques that have been invested and large-scale feathering the web consumer.\\n\\nIn some strange sense, when a web3 entrepreneur make a web3 business in a centralized way, promoting the mechanism of decentralization act as product strategies in a centralized platform. That is embarrassing.\\n\\n## 4.2  suffix\\n\\nA long time ago, we are talking about  modern,  modernity, modernist,  all \\\\*ist.\\n\\nThen we get post, post-modern.\\n\\nNow we are the universe,   \\\\*verse.\\n\\nThe influence of suffix -ism and post-ism has decreased.\\n\\nSuffix ‘-verse’ arises. So does web3. More decentralised eco-systems arises.\\n\\nI have got to known many comparable concepts for years.\\n\\nI’d like to list some similar topics, semantic web, scuttlebutt, dat, duniter, [unposted.org](http://unposted.org/), just to name a few.\\n\\n* semantic web, Web 3.0\\n* non-profit decentralized tech activism with no cryptocurrency and incentives.\\n* web of trust\\n\\n  ```\\n  OpenUDC\\n  \\n  uCoin\\n  \\n  Duniter\\n  ```\\n* concept on p2p economy and data-bank\\n\\n  ```\\n  I don’t like the databank idea.\\n  ```\\n* the liberty community\\n* DAO vs. co-op / open company\\n\\n## 5. Web3 the truth: NFT,   [Modes of Exchange](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Evolution_of_the_Modes_of_Exchange) and immutable infrastructure\\n\\nNFT may act as a new rich media client with offline working mode.\\n\\nOld computer and digital device can have a boutique value, not just been depreciated.\\n\\nWhen your [kindle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle) was degraded as instant noodle tools, take web3 NFT as a true retro loaded into your digital boutique.\\n\\nIn my opinion, NFT core value consists of three part, basic media elements, [mode of exchange](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Evolution_of_the_Modes_of_Exchange) and immutable infrastructure.\\n\\nI recommend a glance on NFT with mode D.\\n\\n## 6.   [Social peer-to-peer processes ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_peer-to-peer_processes)\\n\\nThere are two important aspects to the emergence of P2P in the economic sphere. On the one hand, as a format for peer production processes, it is emerging as a 'third mode of production' based on the cooperation of autonomous agents. Indeed, if the first mode of production was [laissez-faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire) based [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism), and the second mode was the model of a [centrally-planned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_planning) economy, then the third mode is defined neither by the motor of profit, nor by central planning: to allocate resources and make decisions, it does not use market and pricing mechanisms, or managerial commands, but instead uses [social relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relations). Peer production is a significant part of the [mainstream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream) economy, even if it is not much advertised as such in mainstream economic literature.\\n\\nJust take “web3 p2p” as an open source movement and the open source should stretch to real world wetware and wet meta.\\n\\nWe are on the way to a post-capitalism era.\\n\\nI hope that web3 will be a fundamental tech stack of the future and provide us with welfare gliding away from the gold rush.\\n\\n## 7. The plan\\n\\n**[The Web is Still Small After More Than a Decade.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04623.pdf)**\\n\\nHow will the web be growing ?\\n\\n**Why not web3?**\\n\\nAt last but not least,  I’d to share a draft for web3 infrastructure and system maturity checklist.\\n\\n* easy to grok\\n* hash-addressable\\n* immutable infrastructure and provide mutable version\\n* coding strategy optimizing\\n* rich media client handling\\n* native experience\\n* resist tracking and the lynchpin\\n* p2p applications and vuls\\n* cryptographic best practices\\n* open company and co-op\\n\\nAnd one fret buzzing, here’s the plan. [\\\\[1\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here%27s_the_Plan)\\n\\nI am planning on building a [NFTRTC.org](http://nftrtc.org/).\\n\\nAnyone who is interested in **NFTRTC** could make a donation\\n\\n(**Bitcoin address**:  **bc1q6jqyjr09exyehxth7shw0hexdh64e9qdnvr4e4**  ,\\n\\n**Ethereum address**:   **0xCd861F299Fa6B732a3036c24016444A0183353C9**)\\n\\nto be an early founding member in **NFTRTC** and attach your email address with related stuff(social id, twitter, etc) to [nftrtc@gmail.com](https://mailto:nftrtc@gmail.com), although a wallet address sounds good.
