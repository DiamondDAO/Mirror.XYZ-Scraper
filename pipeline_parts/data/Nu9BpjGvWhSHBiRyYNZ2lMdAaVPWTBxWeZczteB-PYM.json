"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"An old servitor cried, \\\"A miracle! a miracle!\\\" and all the Spaniards echoed, \\\"A miracle! a miracle!\\\"\\n\\nDona Elvira, too pious to attribute this to magic, sent for the Abbot of San-Lucar; and the Prior beholding the miracle with his own eyes, being a clever man, and withal an Abbot desirous of augmenting his revenues, determined to turn the occasion to profit. He immediately gave out that Don Juan would certainly be canonized; he appointed a day for the celebration of the apotheosis in his convent, which thenceforward, he said, should be called the convent of San Juan of Lucar. At these words a sufficiently facetious grimace passed over the features of the late Duke.\\n\\nThe taste of the Spanish people for ecclesiastical solemnities is so well known, that it should not be difficult to imagine the religious pantomime by which the Convent of San-Lucar celebrated the translation of the blessed Don Juan Belvidero to the abbey- church. The tale of the partial resurrection had spread so quickly from village to village, that a day or two after the death of the illustrious nobleman the report had reached every place within fifty miles of San-Lucar, and it was as good as a play to see the roads covered already with crowds flocking in on all sides, their curiosity whetted still further by the prospect of a Te Deum sung by torchlight. The old abbey church of San- Lucar, a marvelous building erected by the Moors, a mosque of Allah, which for three centuries had heard the name of Christ, could not hold the throng that poured in to see the ceremony. Hidalgos in their velvet mantles, with their good swords at their sides, swarmed like ants, and were so tightly packed in among the pillars that they had not room to bend the knees, which never bent save to God. Charming peasant girls, in the basquina that defines the luxuriant outlines of their figures, lent an arm to white-haired old men. Young men, with eyes of fire, walked beside aged crones in holiday array. Then came couples tremulous with joy, young lovers led thither by curiosity, newly-wedded folk; children timidly clasping each other by the hand. This throng, so rich in coloring, in vivid contrasts, laden with flowers, enameled like a meadow, sent up a soft murmur through the quiet night. Then the great doors of the church opened.\\n\\nLate comers who remained without saw afar, through the three great open doorways, a scene of which the theatrical illusions of modern opera can give but a faint idea. The vast church was lighted up by thousands of candles, offered by saints and sinners alike eager to win the favor of this new candidate for canonization, and these self-commending illuminations turned the great building into an enchanted fairyland. The black archways, the shafts and capitals, the recessed chapels with gold and silver gleaming in their depths, the galleries, the Arab traceries, all the most delicate outlines of that delicate sculpture, burned in the excess of light like the fantastic figures in the red heart of a brazier. At the further end of the church, above that blazing sea, rose the high altar like a splendid dawn. All the glories of the golden lamps and silver candlesticks, of banners and tassels, of the shrines of the saints and votive offerings, paled before the gorgeous brightness of the reliquary in which Don Juan lay. The blasphemer's body sparkled with gems, and flowers, and crystal, with diamonds and gold, and plumes white as the wings of seraphim; they had set it up on the altar, where the pictures of Christ had stood. All about him blazed a host of tall candles; the air quivered in the radiant light. The worthy Abbot of San-Lucar, in pontifical robes, with his mitre set with precious stones, his rochet and golden crosier, sat enthroned in imperial state among his clergy in the choir. Rows of impassive aged faces, silver-haired old men clad in fine linen albs, were grouped about him, as the saints who confessed Christ on earth are set by painters, each in his place, about the throne of God in heaven. The precentor and the dignitaries of the chapter, adorned with the gorgeous insignia of ecclesiastical vanity, came and went through the clouds of incense, like stars upon their courses in the firmament.\\n\\nWhen the hour of triumph arrived, the bells awoke the echoes far and wide, and the whole vast crowd raised to God the first cry of praise that begins the Te Deum. A sublime cry! High, pure notes, the voices of women in ecstasy, mingled in it with the sterner and deeper voices of men; thousands of voices sent up a volume of sound so mighty, that the straining, groaning organ-pipes could not dominate that harmony. But the shrill sound of children's singing among the choristers, the reverberation of deep bass notes, awakened gracious associations, visions of childhood, and of man in his strength, and rose above that entrancing harmony of human voices blended in one sentiment of love.\\n\\nTe Deum laudamus!\\n\\nThe chant went up from the black masses of men and women kneeling in the cathedral, like a sudden breaking out of light in darkness, and the silence was shattered as by a peal of thunder. The voices floated up with the clouds of incense that had begun to cast thin bluish veils over the fanciful marvels of the architecture, and the aisles were filled with splendor and perfume and light and melody. Even at the moment when that music of love and thanksgiving soared up to the altar, Don Juan, too well bred not to express his acknowledgments, too witty not to understand how to take a jest, bridled up in his reliquary, and responded with an appalling burst of laughter. Then the Devil having put him in mind of the risk he was running of being taken for an ordinary man, a saint, a Boniface, a Pantaleone, he interrupted the melody of love by a yell, the thousand voices of hell joined in it. Earth blessed, Heaven banned. The church was shaken to its ancient foundations.\\n\\nTe Deum laudamus! cried the many voices.\\n\\n\\\"Go to the devil, brute beasts that you are! Dios! Dios! Garajos demonios! Idiots! What fools you are with your dotard God!\\\" and a torrent of imprecations poured forth like a stream of red-hot lava from the mouth of Vesuvius.\\n\\n\\\"Deus Sabaoth! . . . Sabaoth!\\\" cried the believers.\\n\\n\\\"You are insulting the majesty of Hell,\\\" shouted Don Juan, gnashing his teeth. In another moment the living arm struggled out of the reliquary, and was brandished over the assembly in mockery and despair.\\n\\n\\\"The saint is blessing us,\\\" cried the old women, children, lovers, and the credulous among the crowd.\\n\\nAnd note how often we are deceived in the homage we pay; the great man scoffs at those who praise him, and pays compliments now and again to those whom he laughs at in the depths of his heart.\\n\\nJust as the Abbot, prostrate before the altar, was chanting \\\"Sancte Johannes, ora pro noblis!\\\" he heard a voice exclaim sufficiently distinctly: \\\"O coglione!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What can be going on up there?\\\" cried the Sub-prior, as he saw the reliquary move.\\n\\n\\\"The saint is playing the devil,\\\" replied the Abbot.\\n\\nEven as he spoke the living head tore itself away from the lifeless body, and dropped upon the sallow cranium of the officiating priest.\\n\\n\\\"Remember Dona Elvira!\\\" cried the thing, with its teeth set fast in the Abbot's head.\\n\\nThe Abbot's horror-stricken shriek disturbed the ceremony; all the ecclesiastics hurried up and crowded about their chief.\\n\\n\\\"Idiot, tell us now if there is a God!\\\" the voice cried, as the Abbot, bitten through the brain, drew his last breath.\\n\\nPARIS, October 1830.\",\"timestamp\":1636532042,\"title\":\"An old servitor cried\"},\"digest\":\"2VLHuDtjac4YczMhLsN1SqkYC6-xbJgUdeB5gzWRVic\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x50DFA4f326C8D0666AE39431f220915FC37dECA8\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"egbkGVb1_2tUNZs2aPUrFOMJb-pEoETFXOdmrbS8mAY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ti2cU75nie_1DHaDfozVmIf7RXLSRd5IiwXZ8F-HG1E\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"OQV5U0DStk7YNMh4qT7KUZknozvvbaGjlz4JeOoXjuAbKJcLfSGg2TJ6jwn0fETFjZCIaZsJdlNRV3bhF0knog\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa9491d876d56618b3c46cbacd6c4d438e6c2a4aa4ea1f75e631623aa12faffb5116107e86030fe95a028ed9f8c9813d79ece563539e3f09b46ee1e95715ba3ba1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"egbkGVb1_2tUNZs2aPUrFOMJb-pEoETFXOdmrbS8mAY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ti2cU75nie_1DHaDfozVmIf7RXLSRd5IiwXZ8F-HG1E\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"2VLHuDtjac4YczMhLsN1SqkYC6-xbJgUdeB5gzWRVic\"}"
