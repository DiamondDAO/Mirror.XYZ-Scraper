"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Nowadays, working overtime is so common in many companies, especially in foreign companies, private companies, and joint ventures. As far as I am concerned, there are two main reasons of working overtime. For one thing, there is indeed too much work to do. If it is so, the boss should compensate staffs by paying them as overtime salary or giving them vacations. For another, some staffs are not suitable for their positions. In that case, the boss ought to help them to improve their working efficiency. If they are still not qualified, boss may change the positions for them, or to the worst, dismiss them. That's all what I think about working overtime.\",\"timestamp\":1639119505,\"title\":\"My View on Working Overtime\"},\"digest\":\"TwLceLL2HwzT5Eivo6d1cRosHrM6D0-ia5gbMKe9TPI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x44b94D203F9000b4EE7e5932CCE9c016eDc01155\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"dSS-fuQECdntZYHGwTe0ZkzmYW3lSVVoaRwgo5d2-1M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AnBvV4DgQncxGFy7jI5tU6cwSXfuPkgSLBWlkATQqv0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"kR50PrFS1lsHqDdmTRZJWY2cMDFvYwmV3JB1m-Hmez9ga8luQMlmv-yXONhMYTAQ5ONkk9SjDa01xJC9k7-ghg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x46acc088002757ab4a65a1d5a449e74c1401849f58dd044bf886002abba1db1d677cc3bb2ace7ca8c8558fa9f71a7b496b76d01e3265190cf1fbedd1ae26fd3f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"dSS-fuQECdntZYHGwTe0ZkzmYW3lSVVoaRwgo5d2-1M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AnBvV4DgQncxGFy7jI5tU6cwSXfuPkgSLBWlkATQqv0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"TwLceLL2HwzT5Eivo6d1cRosHrM6D0-ia5gbMKe9TPI\"}"
