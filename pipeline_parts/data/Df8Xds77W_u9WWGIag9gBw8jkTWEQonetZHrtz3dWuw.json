"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"About the track, sometimes it's hard to tell if there's a future. 1. DEX track is crowded and competitive. Is it really promising, or is everyone piling in because UNI has opened the market cap? How many projects are there in THE same period of UNI? Few; How many subsequent projects? A lot of. I mean, UNI's success has increased the value of the circuit. Because in '17,' 18, the DEX was a dead-end track. So it's hard to tell if a track has a future or not. For example, to go to the center to renew the contract, there are few projects at the moment, but if DYDX opens the ceiling, then it will become a quality track again. 2. Ten ministries event led to CEX being squeezed and DEX being sought after. So is CEX out of business? But I guess you and I are still mostly trading Cex right now. The bottom line is, don't label a track a sunset industry. \\n\\nIn short, \\\"good industries\\\" are hard to judge.\",\"timestamp\":1633573258,\"title\":\"CEX and DEX\"},\"digest\":\"bRwdu0Li0Yo1Xv5XBJxwrhKbCBePt0X4de83e4oD100\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4A9d3df36F0043d45CF68C08ED9bbe671DcBC6d6\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7zq_D9tFZUodn9_LN4FoePtYABiEtViLG2hJSQDsHoE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xfhTeixZMcgUq-M0vUPb_EtxzRYb49N9SqjGwE4egb4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"m_Xpy9YGGfg2Ew7PyLeocbCiChS-Jn-pPpqRAPiYUMAA-Q9iCtOqTqhUMT8qQ7RjWfl6gQpuEWzk6P-U2UivNw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe912be2b23a7cac53a1af9838781d449ced473de5beb172750971940473869a80bdd34116b5e0ea44f593e512bedf35a24704e333ee97e92d28ebdfad4bb28381c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7zq_D9tFZUodn9_LN4FoePtYABiEtViLG2hJSQDsHoE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xfhTeixZMcgUq-M0vUPb_EtxzRYb49N9SqjGwE4egb4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"bRwdu0Li0Yo1Xv5XBJxwrhKbCBePt0X4de83e4oD100\"}"
