"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"When I am sure of your co-operation, I will let you know my hopes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He doubts my friendship,\\\" said Rhoda sorrowfully.\\n\\n\\\"No; only your discretion.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will be discreet.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, then, sooner or later, he is sure to form some improper connection or other; and then I hope you will aid me in persuading her to divorce him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is not so easy in this country. It is not like our Western States, where, the saying is, they give you five minutes at a railway station for di--vorce.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You forget she is a German Protestant and the marriage was in that country. It will be easy enough.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well; dismiss it from your mind. She will never come before the public in that way. Nothing you nor I could urge would induce her.\\\"\\n\\nVizard replied, doggedly, \\\"I will never despair, so long as she keeps him out of her house.\\\"\\n\\nRhoda told Ina Klosking this, and said, \\\"Now it is in your own hands. You have only to let your charming villain into your house, and Mr. Vizard will return to Islip.\\\"\\n\\nIna Klosking buried her face in her hands, and thought.\\n\\nAt night, Vizard in his box, as usual. Severne behind the scenes with his bouquet. But this night he stayed for the ballet, to see a French danseuse who had joined them. He was acquainted with her before, and had a sprightly conversation with her. In other words, he renewed an old flirtation.\\n\\nThe next opera night all went as usual. Vizard in the box, looking sadder than usual. Rhoda's good sense had not been entirely wasted. Severne, with his bouquet, and his grave humility, until the play ended, and La Klosking passed out into the hall. Her back was hardly turned when Mademoiselle Lafontaine, dressed for the ballet, in a most spicy costume, danced up to her old friend, and slapped his face very softly with a rose, then sprung away and stood on her defense.\\n\\n\\\"I'll have that rose,\\\" cried Severne.\\n\\n\\\"Nenni.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And a kiss into the bargain.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Jamais.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"C'est ce que nous verrons.\\\"\\n\\nHe chased her. She uttered a feigned \\\"Ah!\\\" and darted away. He followed her; she crossed the scene at the back, where it was dark, bounded over an open trap, which she saw just in time, but Severne, not seeing it, because she was between him and it, fell through it, and, striking the mazarine, fell into the cellar, fifteen feet below the stage.\\n\\nThe screams of the dancers soon brought a crowd round the trap, and reached Mademoiselle Klosking just as she was going out to her carriage. \\\"There!\\\" she cried. \\\"Another accident!\\\" and she came back, making sure it was some poor carpenter come to grief, as usual. On such occasions her purse was always ready.\\n\\nThey brought Severne up sensible, but moaning, and bleeding at the temple, and looking all streaky about the face.\\n\\nThey were going to take him to the infirmary; but Mademoiselle Klosking, with a face of angelic pity, said, \\\"No; he bleeds, he bleeds. He must go to my house.\\\"\\n\\nThey stared a little; but it takes a good deal to astonish people in a theater.\\n\\nSeverne was carried out, his head hastily bandaged, and he was lifted into La Klosking's carriage. One of the people of the theater was directed to go on the box, and La Klosking and Ashmead supported him, and he was taken to her lodgings. She directed him to be laid on a couch, and a physician sent for, Miss Gale not having yet returned from Liverpool, whither she had gone to attend a lecture.\\n\\nAshmead went for the physician. But almost at the door he met Miss Gale and Mr. Vizard.\\n\\n\\\"Miss,\\\" said he, \\\"you are wanted. There has been an accident. Mr. Severne has fallen through a trap, and into the cellar.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No bones broken?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not he: he has only broken his head; and that will cost her a broken heart.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where is he?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where I hoped never to see him again.\\n\\n\\\"What! in her house?\\\" said Rhoda and, hurried off at once.\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Ashmead,\\\" said Vizard, \\\"a word with you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"By all means, sir,\\\" said Ashmead, \\\"as we go for the doctor. Dr. Menteith has a great name. He lives close by your hotel, sir.\\n\\nAs they went, Vizard asked him what he meant by saying this accident would cost her a broken heart.\\n\\n\\\"Why, sir,\\\" said Ashmead, \\\"he is on his good behavior to get back; has been for months begging and praying just to be let live under the same roof. She has always refused. But some fellows have such luck. I don't say he fell down a trap on purpose; but he has done it, and no broken bones, but plenty of blood. That is the very thing to overcome a woman's feelings; and she is not proof against pity. He will have her again. Why, she is his nurse now; and see how that will work. We have a week's more business here; and, by bad luck, a dead fortnight, all along of Dublin falling through unexpectedly. He is as artful as Old Nick; he will spin out that broken head of his and make it last all the three weeks; and she will nurse him, and he will be weak, and grateful, and cry, and beg her pardon six times a day, and she is only a woman, after all: and they are man and wife, when all is done: the road is beaten. They will run upon it again, till his time is up to play the rogue as bad as ever.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You torture me,\\\" said Vizard.\\n\\n\\\"I am afraid I do, sir. But I feel it my duty. Mr. Vizard, you are a noble gentleman, and I am only what you see; but the humblest folk will have their likes and dislikes, and I have a great respect for you, sir. I can't tell you the mixture of things I feel when I see you in the same box every night. Of course, I am her agent, and the house would not be complete without you; but as a man I am sorry. Especially now that she has let him into her house. Take a humble friend's advice, sir, and cut it. Don't you come between any woman and her husband, especially a public lady. She will never be more to you than she is. She is a good woman, and he must keep gaining ground. He has got the pull. Rouse all your pride, sir, and your manhood, and you have got plenty of both, and cut it; don't look right nor left, but cut it--and forgive my presumption.\\\"\\n\\nVizard was greatly moved. \\\"Give me your hand,\\\" he said; \\\"you are a worthy man. I'll act on your advice, and never forget what I owe you. Stick to me like a leech, and see me off by the next train, for I am going to tear my heart out of my bosom.\\\"\\n\\nLuckily there was a train in half an hour, and Ashmead saw him off; then went to supper. He did not return to Ina's lodgings. He did not want to see Severne nursed. He liked the fellow, too; but he saw through him clean; and he worshiped Ina Klosking.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXX.\\n\\nAT one o'clock next day, Ashmead received a note from Mademoiselle Klosking, saying, \\\"Arrange with Mr. X---- to close my tour with Manchester. Pay the fortnight, if required.\\\" She was with the company at a month's notice on either side, you must understand.\\n\\nInstead of going to the manager, he went at once, in utter dismay, to Mademoiselle Klosking, and there learned in substance what I must now briefly relate.\\n\\nMiss Gale found Edward Severne deposited on a sofa. Ina was on her knees by his side, sponging his bleeding temple, with looks of gentle pity. Strange to say, the wound was in the same place as his wife's, but more contused, and no large vein was divided. Miss Gale soon stanched that. She asked him where his pain was. He said it was in his head and his back; and he cast a haggard, anxious look on her.\\n\\n\\\"Take my arm,\\\" said she. \\\"Now, stand up.\\\"\\n\\nHe tried, but could not, and said his legs were benumbed. Miss Gale looked grave.\\n\\n\\\"Lay him on my bed,\\\" said La Klosking. \\\"That is better than these hard couches.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are right,\\\" said Miss Gale. \\\"Ring for the servants. He must be moved gently.\\\"\\n\\nHe was carried in, and set upon the edge of the bed, and his coat and waistcoat taken off. Then he was laid gently down on the bed, and covered with a down quilt.\\n\\nDoctress Gale then requested Ina to leave the room, while she questioned the patient.\\n\\nIna retired. In a moment or two Miss Gale came out to her softly.\\n\\nAt sight of her face, La Klosking said, \\\"Oh, dear; it is more serious than we thought.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very serious.\\n\\n\\\"Poor Edward!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Collect all your courage, for I cannot lie, either to patient or friend.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you are right,\\\" said La Klosking, trembling. \\\"I see he is in danger.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Worse than that. Where there's danger there is hope. Here there is none. HE IS A DEAD MAN!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no! no!\\\"\\n\\n[ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/12](ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/12)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637672661,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"And love brings men down to this.
