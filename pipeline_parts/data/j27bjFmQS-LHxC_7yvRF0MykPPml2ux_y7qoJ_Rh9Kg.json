In [an op-ed for the ](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-11-01/ucsb-megadorm-santa-barbara-charles-munger-design)*[Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-11-01/ucsb-megadorm-santa-barbara-charles-munger-design)*[,](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-11-01/ucsb-megadorm-santa-barbara-charles-munger-design) McFadden explained why, calling the building “a misguided experiment that will affect the health and safety of multiple generations of undergraduates who will be forced to negotiate the design’s gross miscalculations and unintended consequences.”\\n\\nMany were quick to agree. Architecture critic Paul Goldberger [called](https://twitter.com/paulgoldberger/status/1453921647736541187?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1453927747277840388%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.curbed.com%2F2021%2F10%2Fyes-build-the-windowless-uc-santa-barbara-dorm-in-my-yard.html) the proposed building a “jail masquerading as a dorm.” Others [likened](https://twitter.com/profmusgrave/status/1454072429509218304?s=20) it to a “human rights violation.” \\n\\n[More from](https://www.bloomberg.com/citylab?in_source=postr_index)\\n\\n[Who Gets to Be Mayor?

This would transform a corner of the UCSB campus into the eighth-densest neighborhood on the planet. Students would get small bedrooms, with eight units sharing a kitchen and bathroom. Much of the building is reserved for common study, dining and recreation areas. Instead of windows and natural light, most interior rooms would be lit only by porthole-like fixtures. Parking is strictly limited to bicycles.\\n\\nAt $1.5 billion — a mind-boggling per-unit cost of $330,687 — the dorm is partially [funded](https://www.wsj.com/articles/buffett-partner-charlie-munger-has-a-side-gig-designing-college-dorms-11556807102) by its mastermind, billionaire investor Charlie Munger, who donated $200 million to the university, with the caveat that his building design must be followed. A vice chairman at [Berkshire Hathaway Inc](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BRK%7CA:US). with a side passion for architecture, the 97-year-old businessman has made similar arrangements at other schools, including Stanford and the University of Michigan. The residence hall for Michigan graduate students that Munger helped fund and design is among the more [popular](https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1454201794620375042) housing options on campus. \\n\\nAnd if you can get past its monolithic [city-in-a-cube](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-10/one-planet-one-city-one-building) scale, bring the costs down, and hammer out minor issues like fire safety and what to do if the power goes out, Dormzilla is *fine*. \\n\\nIt’s perhaps best understood as an extreme but necessary response to the deepening student housing crisis that [leaves](http://transformschools.ucla.edu/stateofcrisis/) one in 20 UC students homeless. As KCRW [reported](https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/greater-la/van-life-street-medicine-shirley-raines/ucsb-housing-students?utm_campaign=gla&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=kcrw-tweet&utm_content=gla-ucsb-housing-students), the problem is especially acute at UCSB, where many students have taken to sleeping in cars and crashing on couches, if not dropping out altogether. The university could [soon face legal penalties](https://www.independent.com/2021/06/30/as-ucsb-grows-it-falls-way-behind-on-building-housing/) if it doesn’t build more student housing. Dormzilla would help to solve that.\\n\\nSay what you will about Munger’s architecture chops, but the man has a plan.\\n\\nNor are the proposed living standards particularly egregious. Dormzilla’s units may lack windows, but each student gets a private room with a desk, bed and space for personal belongings. (Down at the University of California, Los Angeles, many undergraduates sleep three to a room on bunk beds, and pay [handsomely](https://portal.housing.ucla.edu/my-housing/rates-contracts-rules/2020-2021-residential-suite-plaza-triple-room-shared-bath-rates) for the privilege.) And for all the [stink](https://twitter.com/jbarro/status/1454208400531853316?s=20) that has been made over four students sharing a bathroom, this is hardly an unusual [ratio](https://thehostelhelper.com/hostel-bathroom/) for communal living. It may not sound dreamy, but it beats living in a car.\\n\\n“It’s a game of tradeoffs,” [Munger told ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-29/charlie-munger-defends-design-for-dorm-bashed-by-architect)*[Bloomberg News](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-29/charlie-munger-defends-design-for-dorm-bashed-by-architect)*. “If you build a big square building, everything is conveniently near to everybody in the building. If you maximize the light, you get fewer people in the building.”\\n\\nIndeed, say what you will about Munger’s architecture chops, but the man has a plan: With its sparse private accommodations and lavish public spaces, the building is conceived to coax students out of their rooms and into the community. That was once understood to be the entire point of the more-spartan dormitories of the past. You go there to sleep and shower, but otherwise, you’re out and about on campus. With many new student residences resembling [luxury apartments](https://www.uky.edu/housing/residence-halls/woodland-glen-ii) — with astronomical boarding fees to boot — Munger’s design is an earnest, if outlandish, attempt to return to that vision of dorm life.\\n\\nCities are changing fast.

Like moving into Munger Hall, choosing a dense urban environment over a suburban one often means settling for a cramped apartment and giving up your car, yard and a measure of privacy. In exchange, the restaurants are your dining room, the libraries your office, the bars your parlor, the theater your entertainment room, and the public parks your lawn. In other housing contexts — see Los Angeles’ inward-looking [bungalow courts](https://archive.curbed.com/2020/6/23/21294285/bungalow-court-los-angeles-history) — urbanists rightly pine for this space-efficient style of communal living. Is Dormzilla really so different?\\n\\nOf course, the root cause of this student housing crisis — the reason the university finds itself needing a behemoth like Dormzilla — is the [refusal](https://www.pacificresearch.org/ceqa-holds-up-affordable-housing-student-housing/) of UCSB’s neighbors to allow housing construction. Like so many towns and cities in California, the communities around the university are in the thrall of single-family zoning policies that make multifamily developments all but impossible, forcing students and staff to either live far from campus or pay inflated housing prices. In neighboring Goleta, a segregationist zoning code [bans](https://nebula.wsimg.com/674d8d671f7ed1ef6387b66b49f353eb?AccessKeyId=8B11547F66E8794DD29E&disposition=0&alloworigin=1) apartments nearly citywide, while in unincorporated Isla Vista, densities are strictly [capped](http://www.goletazoning.com/documents.html) at 20 units per acre. The city of Santa Barbara has [permitted](https://housingdata.app/places/CA/Santa%20Barbara) fewer than 500 apartments over the past half-decade — half as many units as down-and-out Detroit built last year — despite enormous demand. (For further context: Each *floor* of Munger Hall would have more than 500 units.) \\n\\nTo go out on a limb, Dormzilla is hardly a perfect project. Its [location](https://twitter.com/alfred_twu/status/1454173132374220800?s=20) on the periphery of campus is far from ideal. Its costs are comically high, even by California [standards](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/us/California-housing-costs.html). The long corridors seem dreary and repetitive. It’s not the dorm that I — or evidently many other people, trained architects or otherwise — would design. \\n\\nBut when you follow housing fights for long enough, you start to realize that there are a million reasons to oppose every new development. This building requires more facade articulation or fewer stories; that one lacks yards and parking. The NIMBY impulse is an unlimited renewable resource, forever coming up with superficially convincing reasons for why nothing should ever be built anywhere. The only way to overcome it is to remain true to one simple fact: We need housing. If we made it easier to build, there would be more to go around. And perhaps some of those new apartments could even come with windows.  \\n  \\n *M.
