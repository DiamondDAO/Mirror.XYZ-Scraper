"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### TLDR: openPool is a site that you can use to set up and manage pools of cryptocurrencies with your friend’s and community in less than 10 minutes.\\n\\nWith openPool, you can:\\n\\n1. Set up a pool with your friends or family to learn more about crypto together\\n2. Seamlessly create your own “rolling fund” for your community to pool along-side you\\n3. Find and join pools with customized allocations of cryptocurrencies\\n\\n### How it works\\n\\n**openPool** allows for you to build a customized DAO on the Ethereum blockchain focused in pooling cryptocurrencies and tokens.\\n\\n**Creating a group**\\n\\nWhen setting up a pool, you will be able to choose:\\n\\n1. If your pool is public, open to anyone to see and deposit to, or private and only accessible to those who are invited\\n2. If your pool is private, who to invite to your pool\\n3. Your group token’s name, image and ticker\\n4. What cryptocurrencies and tokens you’d like to add to your pool, as of now you can choose from any ERC20 token and Ethereum\\n5. What allocations you would like to have for the cryptocurrencies and tokens in your pool\\n6. When people would be able to deposit or withdraw from it\\n7. How changes can be made by setting rules on how voting will work\\n\\nOnce you provide these details, all you need to do to create your group is deploy it.\\n\\nAfter its deployed, you will then be able to send Ethereum to your group’s address and receive back a corresponding number of your group’s ERC20 tokens, representing your share of the pool.\\n\\nIf at any point you would like to sell your tokens, you will be able to cash them out from your group and receive the corresponding amount of Ethereum, back in the wallet you’ve connected to your group.\\n\\n**Joining a group**\\n\\nAll you need to do is connect your wallet address to your group’s contract.\\n\\n**Managing your group**\\n\\nOnce your group is deployed, you will be able to track its performance in a dashboard, where you’ll be able to also propose and vote on changes to its respective rules. In the dashboard, you’ll also be able to deposit & withdraw from the group, as well as see the respective members within it.\\n\\n### When can I get started?\\n\\nWhile openPool is still in development, you can check out the landing page [here](https://www.openpool.co/), where you can sign up for early access!\\n\\n**Have a question or some feedback?** We’d love to hear it! please either message us in our discord, or reach out to me personally at joe@openpool.co.\",\"timestamp\":1636395256,\"title\":\"Introducing openPool\"},\"digest\":\"6SYitoQYUgA17b5afL7HJoEqukDc2dstwMj40DOHhZQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xC1f1314dC057C960D76DEbd209E920cd6F72615F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hGXJuJJjXQtOyfm7mJj1Slw_NguWNBcU1UPdtdKLASQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dUIPOXvu5UekP65zuna1uE_WFMcHLo3PG7n4-VpnWhM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ZNKEDSMbZ9eFcG3q_4y6PPWvJzwzv5i0ximkKKEb2a7mfLKlSdlTs7RBHNgXnc0jKhQwIyMpexkjLsXxpzTLng\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0b397d825a12c0cf4bab386e22b72c4c8968145857d87e9077b5717cf0b2e234638a2636eebd83b677594a998d7d9a1ca80b01c57336e04690776bc26a1df9081c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hGXJuJJjXQtOyfm7mJj1Slw_NguWNBcU1UPdtdKLASQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dUIPOXvu5UekP65zuna1uE_WFMcHLo3PG7n4-VpnWhM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"8nDkhSDkj4tupCbsHTX79EX9gpiY74BLlQWKKuzdwag\"}"
