I intended to start writing these weekly newsletters for people new to web3 from a non-technical perspective. With that in mind, let’s dive into the past week’s content.\\n\\nIf you already own some ETH and BTC, one of the first things I would suggest doing is getting your [ENS domain](https://app.ens.domains/). Obvious first question would be, but why should I get this?👇\\n\\n* The simplest use case is that your .ETH name becomes your username across all web3 platforms. Instead of creating different usernames and passwords as we do now on web2 applications, **your ENS domain will be your single source of entry into any web3 application.**\\n* It can also be used to store all of your addresses and receive any cryptocurrency, token, or NFT. **So instead of copying out that long coded address, you can just type your ENS domain (mehak.eth in my case).**\\n\\n## Top Articles of the week\\n\\n* I often hear people ask (including myself) “[Am I too late?”](https://www.hootie.xyz/post/am-i-too-late) and this article points out exactly why we are still so early.\\n\\n  > ***“if crypto adoption were mapped to the history of internet usage, we'd be in the mid-90s.”***\\n* Anything you currently post on a web2 platform (pictures on Instagram, videos on TikTok etc) don’t actually belong to you soon as they are uploaded. Solution? [NFTs make the internet ownable](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo)\\n\\n  > ***\\\"A common critique is that because digital art and digital collectibles can be copied, they don’t carry much value. But NFTs introduce a new possibility that enables true ownership to exist while a work continues to freely circulate online.\\\"***\\n\\n## Tweet of the week + Follow recommendation\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/jarroddicker/status/1465410042186903565?s=20](https://twitter.com/jarroddicker/status/1465410042186903565?s=20)\\n\\n[Kinjal Shah](https://twitter.com/_kinjalbshah?s=20) is an investor at Blockchain Capital and also writes a [blog](https://t.co/UcGM211uZZ)!
