"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"# What is this about\\n\\nThis is being written to hopefully address any questions that an individual may have in regard to the world of today's up and coming financial overhaul with DeFi and Cryptocurrency. I will end up focusing on the Ethereum blockchain as a whole and dig more specifically into how Loopring, which is built on top of the ETH blockchain functions from a new user's perspective.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, I plan to hand something like this off to my older relatives to see if they can use this document to grasp what all of this means and what the future holds in store.\\n\\n## Why bother writing this?\\n\\nUltimately, I am writing this so that I can get a better grasp of how this work myself while hopefully bringing sense to others as well. I am by no means a programmer or coder in a technical regard. I want feedback from the public eye to correct me where I am wrong so that I can get a better understanding of this as well as expand the adoption of the idea of DeFi. I don’t plan on going much into DeFi in this article but is an important idea in regard to crypto.\\n\\nMy career has been in and around IT for more than a decade now and have recently received my Bachelor's in Systems Administration with a focus in Cybersecurity. If there is something running in an enterprise, I have touched it at some point in time. This includes Servers, Phone Systems, Networking, Cybersecurity, etc. Log4J has been real fun the last few weeks...\\n\\nAny videos or anything like that are from Loopring themselves I am just trying to get this all into a single document. You can find a lot of this same information within the Loopring site and their discord server as well.\\n\\n## Full Disclosure\\n\\nI am an Ape from reddit, and I do own both GME and LRC and while of course I would love to have the money to buy a home for myself and my family, I also strongly believe in the ideology of DeFi and crypto. DeFi is what will allow the individual to have control of their assets. I also mention Coinbase a lot through this document as they are the only CEX I use and thus I am most familiar with. Any CEX you use I imagine would operate similarly.\\n\\nObligatory that this is not financial advice and **to do your own research**. There is so much depth into the world of cryptocurrency and I have only been deep into it for a few years. Also never spend any more money than you are willing to lose.\\n\\n# Vocabulary\\n\\nWithin the world of crypto there are many acronyms that to many are completely lost in the sauce. Acronym soups are always staggering and can mean many things in regards to the context of what you are reading. It is **imperative** that you have at least a basic understanding of the verbiage used throughout this document.\\n\\n**Blockchain:**\\n\\nThink of this as a glorified ledger, that depending on which Blockchain technology used dictates how the ledger is handled. When you hear of blockchain you think of things like Bitcoin or Ethereum as these are public blockchain technologies. There are others from the likes of companies like [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/) that are focused on being a private blockchain(s). Use cases for these various blockchain technologies differ from one to the other.\\n\\n**Cryptocurrency:**\\n\\nThese are a currency built on the technology of blockchain, think Bitcoin or Ethereum. Every crypto currency has a blockchain but not every blockchain has a cryptocurrency.\\n\\n**LRC:**\\n\\nLRC is the token for LoopRing. Token being the keyword here. Token meaning that it was built on top of another blockchain, in this case that is Ethereum; more specifically LRC utilizes the ERC-20 token standard.\\n\\n**Fiat Money:**\\n\\nFiat money is a legal tender, which is a currency declared legal by the government, and its value is backed by the issuer (the government).\\n\\n**CEX/DEX (Centralized Exchange/Decentralized Exchange):**\\n\\nA CEX is what most people are familiar with, this is something like Coinbase where you can buy and exchange cryptocurrencies through an intermediary party; I.E. Coinbase.\\n\\nWhereas a DEX is an exchange where you can trade/swap with individuals directly eliminating the need for a third party.\\n\\n**Smart Contracts:**\\n\\nSmart contracts are code that are written that dictate what and how an application interacts with the ETH blockchain. Think of it like signing a document; the ETH blockchain is a fancy, digital notary that also outlines details of an agreement between parties.\\n\\nIf you want a deeper understanding here is a great article on it: [What is a smart contract? | Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-smart-contract)\\n\\n**Transaction:**\\n\\nA move of an asset from one location to another. I want to send 1 LRC from wallet Y to wallet X. I want to move my assets from a CEX to my wallet. Note that a Smart contract, swap contract, etc. is much different than a traditional transaction of a cryptocurrency.\\n\\n**ETH Layer 1:**\\n\\nThis is the base level that the ETH blockchain operates on, each transaction is costly and 'slow' compared to other solutions.\\n\\n**ETH Layer 2:**\\n\\nThese are applications that are built on top of the existing ETH blockchain, each application providing their own unique benefits. There are different ways of going about a second layer on top of Ethereum. I.E. Polygon is a chain all of its own on top of the Ethereum blockchain. While Loopring utilizes zkRollup, explained below.\\n\\n**zkRollup (What Loopring uses):**\\n\\nThis is what allows Loopring to keep its TPS (transactions per second) so high with also extremely low fees. You can think of this simply as Loopring is bundling 100 if not 1000s of transactions on their side into one single transaction that is then written to the ETH blockchain.\\n\\nImagine Starbucks; they have 1000 customers come to the store every day and without zkRollup each of those customers would have a L1 gas fee associated with them. With zkRollup Starbucks can do all of their transactions in-house (Starbucks being Loopring in this scenario) and then send a final transaction to the bank (Eth L1) at the end of the day.  Starbucks knows they served 1000 customers and did that ledger in house, then at the end of the day they send a transaction to the bank saying they are up or down an amount of LRC.\\n\\nThis works with Ethereum because transaction fees are based on gas and demand on the chain and not a static percentage of each purchase. Which is why something like this doesn’t work with a credit card company like Visa or Mastercard where they just charge a 3% fee on everything.\\n\\n**NFTs (Non-fungible tokens):**\\n\\nThe big buzzword now-a-days, NFTs! This is a way to tie a digital asset to a unique individual (technically a wallet) that is on the ETH blockchain. We currently see these used a lot with Artwork on sites like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) but we are only just beginning to get into the potential of what a NFT has to offer.\\n\\n**Wallet:**\\n\\nA wallet is a private key that you/your device contains that gives it unique access to your publicly known wallet address. Without your private key your assets in the wallet would be lost. There are many different wallets out there. Always remember; not your keys not your coin.\\n\\n**Gas/GWEI:**\\n\\nIt costs gas to transact on Layer 1 of the Ethereum blockchain. Deploying a smart contract, sending crypto, activating features within the Loopring smart wallet, etc. You can view gas prices here: [ETH Gas.watch.](https://ethgas.watch/)\\n\\nDifferent types of transactions can cost more than others. I.E. Moving ETH from Coinbase to your wallet may cost $5. But deploying a smart contract (like the looping smart wallet) costs a lot more gas.\\n\\n**Swap:**\\n\\nThis is swapping one crypto, say USDC to another, say LRC. You can do this on really any exchange. Some exchanges like Loopring ONLY allow swaps between cryptocurrencies while a CEX like Coinbase lets you use fiat directly to purchase/swap crypto.\\n\\n## Ethereum\\n\\n[https://ethereum.org/en/](https://ethereum.org/en/)\\n\\nI don’t want to get into too much detail of what and how Ethereum itself works as this is focused on Loopring, but as Loopring is based on Ethereum it is important to understand the basic.\\n\\n### Current State\\n\\nEthereum currently computes transactions with Proof of Work (PoW), this requires a lot of computational power on the network. When you are paying gas, you are paying for a CPU cycle on a machine within the network.  This price fluctuates wildly depending on the current demand on the network.\\n\\nYou can see gas prices here:\\n\\n[https://etherscan.io/gastracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker)\\n\\n### Future State (aka Eth 2.0, hopefully)\\n\\nEthereum is going to move to a proof of work model, where people will stake their own ETH coins for this computation. As this does not require near as much computational power the gas price of each transaction will decline.\\n\\nEven if gas prices on L1 dropped to $1 each, Loopring still benefits from this because of the way zkRollup works. If L1 ETH transaction costs $1 each the cost of Loopring’s L2 transaction cost wouldn’t even cost $.01. Ethereum 2.0 also does not solve for the TPS problem while Loopring would still be capable of the 2000+ TPS.\\n\\n### Token Standards\\n\\nThere are multiple token standards in use on the Ethereum chain. The main being ERC-20, which are other tokens based on Ethereum (Loopring being one of them). There is also ERC-721 and ERC-1155, which are both NFT standards in use on the Ethereum blockchain. Remember, smart contracts are just code that are run on the Ethereum network.\\n\\n## Loopring\\n\\nWhy hype Loopring, what makes it so special?\\n\\nThere are already so many individuals focusing and talking about LRC and my plan was to never go in-depth into the technology itself in this document but to explain how to use their platform as of today.\\n\\n## Helpful Links\\n\\n[Loopring Discord](https://discord.com/invite/KkYccYp)\\n\\n[Loopring Main Website](https://loopring.org/#/)\\n\\n[Loopring DEX](https://loopring.io/)\\n\\n[Loopring Reddit Community](https://www.reddit.com/r/loopringorg/)\\n\\n[Loopring Blog](https://loopring.org/#/blog)\\n\\n[LoopringBot - Twitter](https://twitter.com/LoopringBot)\\n\\n## Purchasing Loopring\\n\\nThis is the most important part for a new user as there are multiple ways to go about purchasing LRC but depending on what your end goal is can vary slightly on what you may want to do.\\n\\n### Small One-Time Purchases (<$300 USD)\\n\\nIf you are wanting to make a small purchase of LRC and the end goal is to get them directly onto Layer 2 you should use the fiat on-ramp method. This can be done within the Loopring Smart Wallet found under add assets. This can be done with a credit/debit cards and bank transfers; keep in mind that this will vary on country AND the bank you use.\\n\\nWhen you purchase through ramp you will be avoiding the two fees that plagues the traditional method of getting LRC onto Layer 2. HOWEVER, ramp does have fees of their own which is why if you want something onto L2 quickly and a small amount they are the best method. From my experience every $100 USD comes with \\\\~$5 in fees.\\n\\n### Medium Purchases ($300-$999)\\n\\nIf it was me? I would be purchasing on a CEX as small amounts over time and once I have a considerable amount or assets I would then xfer them to my Loopring Smart Wallet. Then of course move from Layer 1 to Layer 2.\\n\\n### Large Purchases (>$1000)\\n\\nYou will want to purchase assets on a CEX like Coinbase, yes you will have to pay two L1 fees. One from Coinbase to your wallet, and another to move them from L1 to L2.\\n\\n### How I do it\\n\\nIf you plan to HODL your LRC until it is a DeFacto way to exchange goods and services I would [DCA.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp) Purchase small amounts (I.E., $300/m) every so often from a CEX like Coinbase and when it becomes a large amount (I stick with >$1500) I would then transfer it to the Loopring smart wallet. You can still then leave it on L1 and time your L1 to L2 move as well. From my experience transferring from Coinbase is cheap.\\n\\nOnce you have the LRC in your L1 account on your Loopring Smart Wallet. I would try to time the move from L1 to L2 accordingly, as the gas + swap contract price varies as well. It tends to be the lowest around Sunday night or very early Monday morning (PST).\\n\\n## Selling Loopring\\n\\nI hate to tell you the best way to do it but I understand, sometimes you need to have that filthy fiat in your hands to buy a pack of smokes while the world implodes around us. There are future plans to make this process a lot smoother from L2 assets.\\n\\n### Selling to Fiat\\n\\nUnfortunately, I DO NOT recommend do this now if you plan to withdraw <$300 dollars.\\n\\nThe only way you can do this is to transfer assets to L1 (a fee if they are on L2) and then another fee to transfer those to a CEX to then sell into your native currency. If the assets are on layer 2 that means you have two large transactions and depending on the current prices can get expensive quick.\\n\\nIt is on Looprings’ roadmap to have a solution that would let an individual off-ramp their assets directly from Layer 2 to fiat.\\n\\n## Loopring DEX - [Loopring - Ethereum Layer2](https://loopring.io/#/layer2)\\n\\nThere are two ways to access Looprings' DEX. You can access it through their webapp ([loopring.io](http://loopring.io)) utilizing a wallet like MetaMask, MetaMask having the ability to access Layer 2 as well. You can also access it directly within your Loopring Wallet on your phone itself however if you want to use it to do serious trading and for things like limit orders let me explain WalletConnect.\\n\\nWhy a DEX > CEX? Well with Loopring's DEX you can utilize assets on Layer 2 resulting in a massive discount in swap fees and trades. They also have some fun other quirks like their swap tournaments. You CANNOT sell your assets on Loopring's DEX directly to a fiat currency.\\n\\n## WalletConnect\\n\\nOnce you are looking at the Layer 2 application in your browser\\n\\n1. Click Connect Wallet\\n2. In the window that pops up, click WalletConnect.\\n3. A QR code should show up in the browser, **MAKE SURE YOU ARE ON <HTTPS://LOOPRING.IO>**\\n4. In your Loopring Smart Wallet app on your phone, select Scan.\\n5. Scan the QR code, your phone will then ask for you to approve this.\\n6. Once approved your wallet is connected to the web application, but your wallet is still locked.\\n7. Where you previously clicked connect wallet, you should see unlock wallet, click that.\\n8. You should have another prompt on your phone, click unlock.\\n9. Now you can trade/swap your crypto within the Web App.\\n\\n## Loopring Smart Wallet\\n\\n### Layer 1\\n\\nWhat is Layer 1? This is the bare Ethereum blockchain where everything you do is an expensive gas fee. If you want the full functionality of the Loopring smart wallet than you must pay a few fees for various actions.\\n\\nFunctions that require a fee within the Loopring Smart Wallet\\n\\n* Guardian Addition\\n* Layer 1 Wallet Activation\\n  * If you wanted to xfer assets from the Loopring Smart Wallet to a CEX like Coinbase you would have to transfer them from Layer 1 or send assets to other not already on Loopring.\\n* ENS name registration\\n  * A simple name to address your wallet by.\\n\\n### Layer 2\\n\\nThe Loopring smart wallet allows you to utilize Layer 2 with LRC as well as access to the Loopring DEX from a mobile device. Full functionality of this wallet requires that you have a L1 and L2 account open. If you only want to utilize Layer 2, which is cheaper and can be on ramped directly read about the counter factual wallet below.\\n\\nActivating your L1 wallet does provide more functionality within your wallet. Namely around recovery of your wallet and a few other various features. When it comes to account protection and recovery L1 will allow you to add guardians, as well as be a guardian yourself.\\n\\n### AMM Liquidity\\n\\nIf you want to take part in Liquidity your assets MUST belong on Layer 2. What you are doing is providing liquidity from your own market into the Loopring system. This allows your crypto to be used within the Loopring DEX for trades, swaps, etc.\\n\\nWhat do you get from contributing to the liquidity pools? You get a percentage of all swaps based on what percentage of liquidity you are providing.\\n\\nSay you provide liquidity for LRC/ETH; if there was a total liquidity of $10000 in value and you are providing $1000 of that, you would get a part of the trading fee (.20% in Loopring’s AMM Liquidity) and then 10% of that. Effectively meaning you would get .02% of every swap of ETH/LRC.\\n\\n### ENS Address – L1 transaction fee\\n\\nThis is a simple name for your wallet. Would you rather memorize seattle.loopring.eth (my ENS address) or 0xec62aaf37b10ad286fc86c3e9b662c75a958b40c?\\n\\n### Guardians – L1 transaction per Guardian\\n\\nA guardian is a third party that can lock/unlock your wallet address, help recover your wallet, and allow you to spend over your daily quota (daily quota is set by oneself).\\n\\nFor any of the operations above to be put in place the is a formula: (N/2) + 1. This means that more than half of your guardians must agree on what is being requested. Loopring themselves are a guardian free of charge when you make your wallet, unsure if that will continue into the foreseeable future or not.\\n\\nYou can protect others, and you can request others protect you. The wallet requesting to be protected is the one that must pay the L1 gas fee.\\n\\n## Counter Factual Wallet\\n\\n[Create a free (Loopring L2) Counterfactual Wallet (+ stop paying Ethereum gas fees!)](https://youtu.be/saeEeMC6Q_0) \\\\[QUICK GUIDE\\\\]\\n\\nThis is the same exact application as the existing Loopring Smart Wallet. However, you can utilize the app without the L1 functionality. Which means that (at the time of writing) to activate this wallet you need to deposit 50 LRC that ALREADY exist on Layer 2 to activate this wallet. There are two ways to achieve this, have a friend send your address 50 LRC or you can purchase L2 LRC directly with Ramp. In the (hopefully) near future you may be able to use a DEX to purchase LRC directly on L2, but it is currently not an option.\\n\\nOnce the wallet receives the 50 LRC that WERE ALREADY on Layer 2, your wallet will be active, and you will now be able to transact directly on Layer 2.\\n\\nWhen you are ready you can activate your L1 wallet with funds from L2, but it will require a L1 transaction cost (gas) to do so, which can be costly depending on the current gas fees.\\n\\n# Possibilities\\n\\nWow great, I have been rambling on this whole time.... so, what can we do as a society with technology like this? There are obviously many other use cases that my tiny smooth brain cannot comprehend.\\n\\n## NFTs\\n\\nDigital licensing... this is huge. Imagine if you were to purchase something like a Video Game, Song, Audiobook as a platform agnostic NFT. That copy of Assassin's Creed you bought with LRC and is now tied to your unique wallet could then be tied to your Steam account, PlayStation account, Microsoft account. That single purchase would allow you to play that game on any platform.\\n\\nWhat if we were able to get rid of these various middlemen platforms like Steam and were able to purchase games directly from developers. What if you were done with the game and then you were able to sell your own NFT back to someone else, allowing you to sell your digital content.\\n\\nNFTs are after all just standards (smart contracts) written on the Ethereum Blockchain. There can be new standards that are made for their own specific use cases.\\n\\n## BYOB (Be your own Bank)\\n\\nNo, not beer. Ya bunch of alcoholic apes.\\n\\nThis is what excites me the most, the ability to no longer rely on a centralized form of finance (Ya, DeFi duh). It kills me that I must pay a charge to pull out cash from an ATM that is not my own bank, it is my money why must I pay to have my own thing given to me. I have a distrust in the financial system as a whole and giving me the ability to control my own assets digitally, anywhere, and instantly would give me comfort that before this kind of technology was impossible minus stuffing cash in your mattress.\\n\\n# FAQs\\n\\n## Crypto Questions\\n\\nAlright boomer, let's do this.\\n\\n* Why is crypto worth anything at all?\\n  * Why is the USD worth anything at all? Because people BELIEVE it does (and it's backed by the US government). Imagine what would happen if tomorrow the rest of the world refused to take USD and only accepted Euro? That wouldn't end well for the US at all. Crypto has it's worth because the people behind it give it its worth.\\n* Why should I care?\\n  * Crypto could become the future of finance. Remember when the USD was actually backed by gold? I don't.... but you probably do. Money is an everchanging landscape just like anything else. It should be everyone's responsibility to stay relevant in today's world.\\n* How is crypto a finite resource?\\n  * Unlike the USD there is a finite amount of each cryptocurrency. Each one has their own limit and SOME do not. Just like commodities crypto very much deals with supply and demand, especially the longer it is in existence. There can only EVER be 21 million bitcoin in existence, each bitcoin being able to be broken down into a satoshi ( one one-millionth of a single BTC). Currently there are nearly 19 million in circulation.\\n\\n## Loopring\\n\\nLoopring it a crypto token on the Ethereum blockchain. It’s own Layer 2 application, the token being LRC.\\n\\n* How many total LRC tokens are there?\\n  * There are a total supply of 1,373,873,440 LRC, while 1,245,991,468 of those are in circulation. Maximum supply of LRC that could possibly ever exist is 1,374,513,896 LRC.\\n* What can I do with my LRC once I have it?\\n  * You can utilize the Loopring CEX as well as have access to things like AMM liquidity and Red Packets. At some point once Loopring has established partners you would be able to utilize LRC with them as well.\\n\\n## Loopring Smart Wallet Questions\\n\\nMost of the questions below have to do with transaction fees. I just want to state that Loopring is actively working on more and more ways to avoid L1 transaction fees at all costs. As time goes on it will only improve. I cannot also state enough how great the community is on the Loopring discord server; if you have a question, ask!  You can also open a ticket directly with Loopring here:\\n\\n[https://loopring.zohodesk.com/portal/loopring/en/home](https://loopring.zohodesk.com/portal/loopring/en/home)\\n\\n* I have sent funds from my Layer 2 account to Coinbase, but I have not seen them come across.\\n  * Unfortunately, Coinbase does **NOT** support Layer 2 transactions and in this scenario your precious LRC/ETH may be lost in the abyss. Your best bet is to reach out to Coinbase support and see if they can do anything.\\n* I sent crypto from Coinbase to my Looping CF Wallet, why don't I see the funds in my wallet?\\n  * What you did in this situation is activate your L1 account within the application, good for you! If you did not mean to do this it is too late as you have already paid the gas fee for moving the crypto.\\n* I have the CF wallet setup, but I need to off-ramp my crypto to fiat.\\n  * Loopring is working on a way to off-ramp L2 crypto directly to Fiat but now you would have to xfer funds to L1 and then xfer those assets to a CEX like Coinbase. This would cost two layer 1 transactions to get them to Coinbase, but there is the added benefit of doing this the first time would activate your L1 account.\\n* Why do I have to pay to move assets from L1 to L2?\\n  * First off, I would not do a L1 to L2 transfer until you have a good amount of assets to move. That way the gas fees are a smaller percentage of what it costs to move everything. But this is a requirement of any asset move from L1 to L2 and vice versa. Loopring is working on way to avoid L1 fees as often as possible.\\n* Why do Layer 1 transaction fees change?\\n  * The transaction fee is a moving target, you can track the current gas fee here: [ETH Gas.watch.](https://ethgas.watch/) If you scroll down on the page, you can see historical pricing and try to time your next move based on that data.\\n* Why are certain features so expensive to setup?\\n  * This is a great question. It is because not everything is a simple transaction on the Layer 1 blockchain. The deployment of a smart contract (adding a guardian, ENS name, activating Layer 1 wallet, move from L1 to L2) costs a lot more than say sending ETH from L1 to another L1 account as that is a simple transaction.\\n* Do I have to pay to setup my Loopring Smart Wallet?\\n  * Yes. If you want to start with the counterfactual wallet, you must deposit \\\\~50 LRC into the account. This can be done via ramp and right now would cost \\\\~$100. Ramp has a few fees but the remainder of that money is then put directly into the wallet .The only money you pay are the fees to Ramp. If you want to setup the Layer 1 wallet then yes this will require the deployment of a smart contract on L1 and costs a good chunk of change.\\n* What is a red packet?\\n  * I'm not sure if this is only in the loopring smart wallet for the holiday season, but it is a gift. It's a way to send someone an amount of assets. You can send someone a QR code and make it private or you can make it public and some lucky ape will get some free assets! It's called Holiday spirit!\\n\\n# Speculation\\n\\n## GameStop\\n\\nYou did not think I would go all this time and no mention how GameStop could play a role in all of this? It is one thing to be a middleman for the purchase of new games but there could be a huge potential for the reselling of existing digital assets; think of it like Amazon versus Ebay. You do not go searching on Amazon for that old collectible that is not manufactured anymore but you can find things like that on Ebay.\\n\\nIf GameStop got their foot down on the floor in regards to NFTs and digital rights to video games there is room for huge potential there. This level of digital licensing will require a lot more than collaboration between LRC and GameStop, but is a future I would welcome to see.\\n\\n# Future Features\\n\\nThis is a highly active project. The best way to keep up with this would be to follow the discord server, twitter, website, etc. I will note exciting features coming that will improve the adoption of Loopring for the average person as well as the usability of Loopring itself.\\n\\n### L2 Withdrawals from CEX to Fiat\\n\\nJust like being able to on-ramp directly to L2 with Fiat, there are plans to have an off-ramp solution as well. Loopring knows we would like to avoid L1 gas fees at all cost.\\n\\n### CEX Layer 2 Integration\\n\\nWouldn't it be great if a CEX like Coinbase themselves were able to work on Layer 2? I think this will only come with time and more requests from the community to setup that king of integration.\\n\\n# TL DR:\\n\\nBuy Loopring and HODL, and welcome to the future.\",\"timestamp\":1641778754,\"title\":\"Welcome to LoopRing\"},\"digest\":\"HpomMknArowDKDvK0U1JR3SkKJN7uLBOey5Jpp7r_4s\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xcBeE95C232969adB91aa0a8ad47cb2EDf705220a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"XvnrfYrNoA5IGreNC44N4y0iwTLgW7Zl9PJsbQ2nSj4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"IYShTBAYweeRtn4768YF3MahpDO9nTN_vSrWr-Qg55Q\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"4OvU4fyVtf1IY4reB9qkjFGneubaSrOvLZ7-JRm8EYdkKO5kkO476YXb9zekhEfRaQQkBiFBGixjgHE7LOieYg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x218c4f2765e772459b5795fc674cea6222de7ba6e461b87debd0ee9524bfe7cd1b4c435ddecf381ba4e62597359322ed12d4fae006986ed23d6a09f0a3d4da3f1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"XvnrfYrNoA5IGreNC44N4y0iwTLgW7Zl9PJsbQ2nSj4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"IYShTBAYweeRtn4768YF3MahpDO9nTN_vSrWr-Qg55Q\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"X7GxD7LM9NKMwCxYyk98F1mpRr-AG4YYEyebg5K18qM\"}"
