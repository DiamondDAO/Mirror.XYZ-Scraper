"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"But how did it happen?\\\" he asked.  \\\"Weren't they rather quick in selling the Martha?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Had to.  You know the reef at Poonga-Poonga.  She's not worth tuppence on it if any kind of a sea kicks up, and it's ripe for a nor'wester any moment now.  The crowd abandoned her completely. Didn't even dream of auctioning her.  Morgan and Raff persuaded them to put her up.  They're a co-operative crowd, you know, an organized business corporation, fore and aft, all hands and the cook.  They held a meeting and voted to sell.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But why didn't they stand by and try to save her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Stand by!  You know Malaita.  And you know Poonga-Poonga.  That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.  There was nothing to do but take to the boats.  The Martha missed stays going in, and inside five minutes she was on the reef and in possession.  The niggers swarmed over her, and they just threw the crew into the boats.  I talked with some of the men.  They swear there were two hundred war canoes around her inside half an hour, and five thousand bushmen on the beach.  Said you couldn't see Malaita for the smoke of the signal fires.  Anyway, they cleared out for Tulagi.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But why didn't they fight?\\\" Sheldon asked.\\n\\n\\\"It was funny they didn't, but they got separated.  You see, two- thirds of them were in the boats, without weapons, running anchors and never dreaming the natives would attack.  They found out their mistake too late.  The natives had charge.  That's the trouble of new chums on the coast.  It would never have happened with you or me or any old-timer.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But what is Miss Lackland intending to do?\\\" Captain Auckland grinned.\\n\\n\\\"She's going to try to get the Martha off, I should say.  Or else why did she pay fifty-five quid for her?  And if she fails, she'll try to get her money back by saving the gear--spars, you know, and patent steering-gear, and winches, and such things.  At least that's what I'd do if I was in her place.  When I sailed, the little girl had chartered the Emily--'I'm going recruiting,' says Munster--he's the skipper and owner now.  'And how much will you net on the cruise?' asks she.  'Oh, fifty quid,' says he.  'Good,' says she; 'you bring your Emily along with me and you'll get seventy-five.'  You know that big ship's anchor and chain piled up behind the coal-sheds?  She was just buying that when I left. She's certainly a hustler, that little girl of yours.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She is my partner,\\\" Sheldon corrected.\\n\\n\\\"Well, she's a good one, that's all, and a cool one.  My word! a white woman on Malaita, and at Poonga-Poonga of all places!  Oh, I forgot to tell you--she palavered Burnett into lending her eight rifles for her men, and three cases of dynamite.  You'd laugh to see the way she makes that Guvutu gang stand around.  And to see them being polite and trying to give advice!  Lord, Lord, man, that little girl's a wonder, a marvel, a--a--a catastrophe.  That's what she is, a catastrophe.  She's gone through Guvutu and Tulagi like a hurricane; every last swine of them in love with her--except Raff. He's sore over the auction, and he sprang his recruiting contract with Munster on her.  And what does she do but thank him, and read it over, and point out that while Munster was pledged to deliver all recruits to Morgan and Raff, there was no clause in the document forbidding him from chartering the Emily.\\n\\n\\\"'There's your contract,' says she, passing it back.  'And a very good contract it is.  The next time you draw one up, insert a clause that will fit emergencies like the present one.'  And, Lord, Lord, she had him, too.\\n\\n\\\"But there's the breeze, and I'm off.  Good-bye, old man.  Hope the little girl succeeds.  The Martha's a whacking fine boat, and she'd take the place of the Jessie.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII--\\\"YOUR\\\" MISS LACKLAND\\n\\nThe next morning Sheldon came in from the plantation to breakfast, to find the mission ketch, Apostle, at anchor, her crew swimming two mares and a filly ashore.  Sheldon recognized the animals as belonging to the Resident Commissioner, and he immediately wondered if Joan had bought them.  She was certainly living up to her threat of rattling the dry bones of the Solomons, and he was prepared for anything.\\n\\n\\\"Miss Lackland sent them,\\\" said Welshmere, the missionary doctor, stepping ashore and shaking hands with him.  \\\"There's also a box of saddles on board.  And this letter from her.  And the skipper of the Flibberty-Gibbet.\\\"\\n\\nThe next moment, and before he could greet him, Oleson stepped from the boat and began.\\n\\n\\\"She's stolen the Flibberty, Mr. Sheldon.  Run clean away with her. She's a wild one.  She gave me the fever.  Brought it on by shock. And got me drunk, as well--rotten drunk.\\\"\\n\\nDr. Welshmere laughed heartily.\\n\\n\\\"Nevertheless, she is not an unmitigated evil, your Miss Lackland. She's sworn three men off their drink, or, to the same purpose, shut off their whisky.  You know them--Brahms, Curtis, and Fowler. She shipped them on the Flibberty-Gibbet along with her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She's the skipper of the Flibberty now,\\\" Oleson broke in.  \\\"And she'll wreck her as sure as God didn't make the Solomons.\\\"\\n\\nDr. Welshmere tried to look shocked, but laughed again.\\n\\n\\\"She has quite a way with her,\\\" he said.  \\\"I tried to back out of bringing the horses over.  Said I couldn't charge freight, that the Apostle was under a yacht license, that I was going around by Savo and the upper end of Guadalcanar.  But it was no use.  'Bother the charge,' said she.  'You take the horses like a good man, and when I float the Martha I'll return the service some day.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And 'bother your orders,' said she to me,\\\" Oleson cried.  \\\"'I'm your boss now,' said she, 'and you take your orders from me.' 'Look at that load of ivory nuts,' I said.  'Bother them,' said she; 'I'm playin' for something bigger than ivory nuts.  We'll dump them overside as soon as we get under way.'\\\"\\n\\nSheldon put his hands to his ears.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know what has happened, and you are trying to tell me the tale backwards.  Come up to the house and get in the shade and begin at the beginning.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What I want to know,\\\" Oleson began, when they were seated, \\\"is IS she your partner or ain't she?  That's what I want to know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She is,\\\" Sheldon assured him.\\n\\n\\\"Well, who'd have believed it!\\\"  Oleson glanced appealingly at Dr. Welshmere, and back again at Sheldon.  \\\"I've seen a few unlikely things in these Solomons--rats two feet long, butterflies the Commissioner hunts with a shot-gun, ear-ornaments that would shame the devil, and head-hunting devils that make the devil look like an angel.  I've seen them and got used to them, but this young woman of yours--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Miss Lackland is my partner and part-owner of Berande,\\\" Sheldon interrupted.\\n\\n\\\"So she said,\\\" the irate skipper dashed on.  \\\"But she had no papers to show for it.  How was I to know?  And then there was that load of ivory nuts-eight tons of them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For heaven's sake begin at the--\\\" Sheldon tried to interrupt.\",\"timestamp\":1638930778,\"title\":\"Sheldon experienced a sudden thrill.
