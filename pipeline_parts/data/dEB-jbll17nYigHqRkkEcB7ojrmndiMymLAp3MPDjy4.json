"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"He is obedient; further I know not. Once he made request of me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For what?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He wished me to change him alternately from the right to the left.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did he give a reason?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He had observed that the men who are confined to one side become misshapen. He also said that some day of storm or battle there might be sudden need to change him, and he might then be unserviceable.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perpol! The idea is new. What else hast thou observed of him?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is cleanly above his companions.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In that he is Roman,\\\" said Arrius, approvingly. \\\"Have you nothing of his history?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not a word.\\\"\\n\\nThe tribune reflected awhile, and turned to go to his own seat.\\n\\n\\\"If I should be on deck when his time is up,\\\" he paused to say, \\\"send him to me. Let him come alone.\\\"\\n\\nAbout two hours later Arrius stood under the aplustre of the galley; in the mood of one who, seeing himself carried swiftly towards an event of mighty import, has nothing to do but wait--the mood in which philosophy vests an even-minded man with the utmost calm, and is ever so serviceable. The pilot sat with a hand upon the rope by which the rudder paddles, one on each side of the vessel, were managed. In the shade of the sail some sailors lay asleep, and up on the yard there was a lookout. Lifting his eyes from the solarium set under the aplustre for reference in keeping the course, Arrius beheld the rower approaching.\\n\\n\\\"The chief called thee the noble Arrius, and said it was thy will that I should seek thee here. I have come.\\\"\\n\\nArrius surveyed the figure, tall, sinewy, glistening in the sun, and tinted by the rich red blood within--surveyed it admiringly, and with a thought of the arena; yet the manner was not without effect upon him: there was in the voice a suggestion of life at least partly spent under refining influences; the eyes were clear and open, and more curious than defiant. To the shrewd, demanding, masterful glance bent upon it, the face gave back nothing to mar its youthful comeliness--nothing of accusation or sullenness or menace, only the signs which a great sorrow long borne imprints, as time mellows the surface of pictures. In tacit acknowledgment of the effect, the Roman spoke as an older man to a younger, not as a master to a slave.\\n\\n\\\"The hortator tells me thou art his best rower.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The hortator is very kind,\\\" the rower answered.\\n\\n\\\"Hast thou seen much service?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"About three years.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"At the oars?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I cannot recall a day of rest from them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The labor is hard; few men bear it a year without breaking, and thou--thou art but a boy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The noble Arrius forgets that the spirit hath much to do with endurance. By its help the weak sometimes thrive, when the strong perish.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"From thy speech, thou art a Jew.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My ancestors further back than the first Roman were Hebrews.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The stubborn pride of thy race is not lost in thee,\\\" said Arrius, observing a flush upon the rower's face.\\n\\n\\\"Pride is never so loud as when in chains.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What cause hast thou for pride?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That I am a Jew.\\\"\\n\\nArrius smiled.\\n\\n\\\"I have not been to Jerusalem,\\\" he said; \\\"but I have heard of its princes. I knew one of them. He was a merchant, and sailed the seas. He was fit to have been a king. Of what degree art thou?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I must answer thee from the bench of a galley. I am of the degree of slaves. My father was a prince of Jerusalem, and, as a merchant, he sailed the seas. He was known and honored in the guest-chamber of the great Augustus.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"His name?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ithamar, of the house of Hur.\\\"\\n\\nThe tribune raised his hand in astonishment.\\n\\n\\\"A son of Hur--thou?\\\"\\n\\nAfter a silence, he asked,\\n\\n\\\"What brought thee here?\\\"\\n\\nJudah lowered his head, and his breast labored hard. When his feelings were sufficiently mastered, he looked the tribune in the face, and answered,\\n\\n\\\"I was accused of attempting to assassinate Valerius Gratus, the procurator.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thou!\\\" cried Arrius, yet more amazed, and retreating a step. \\\"Thou that assassin! All Rome rang with the story. It came to my ship in the river by Lodinum.\\\"\\n\\nThe two regarded each other silently.\\n\\n\\\"I thought the family of Hur blotted from the earth,\\\" said Arrius, speaking first.\\n\\nA flood of tender recollections carried the young man's pride away; tears shone upon his cheeks.\\n\\n\\\"Mother--mother! And my little Tirzah! Where are they? O tribune, noble tribune, if thou knowest anything of them\\\"--he clasped his hands in appeal--\\\"tell me all thou knowest. Tell me if they are living--if living, where are they? and in what condition? Oh, I pray thee, tell me!\\\"\\n\\nHe drew nearer Arrius, so near that his hands touched the cloak where it dropped from the latter's folded arms.\\n\\n\\\"The horrible day is three years gone,\\\" he continued--\\\"three years, O tribune, and every hour a whole lifetime of misery--a lifetime in a bottomless pit with death, and no relief but in labor--and in all that time not a word from any one, not a whisper. Oh, if, in being forgotten, we could only forget! If only I could hide from that scene--my sister torn from me, my mother's last look! I have felt the plague's breath, and the shock of ships in battle; I have heard the tempest lashing the sea, and laughed, though others prayed: death would have been a riddance. Bend the oar--yes, in the strain of mighty effort trying to escape the haunting of what that day occurred. Think what little will help me. Tell me they are dead, if no more, for happy they cannot be while I am lost. I have heard them call me in the night; I have seen them on the water walking. Oh, never anything so true as my mother's love! And Tirzah--her breath was as the breath of white lilies. She was the youngest branch of the palm--so fresh, so tender, so graceful, so beautiful! She made my day all morning. She came and went in music. And mine was the hand that laid them low! I--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dost thou admit thy guilt?\\\" asked Arrius, sternly.\\n\\nThe change that came upon Ben-Hur was wonderful to see, it was so instant and extreme. The voice sharpened; the hands arose tight-clenched; every fibre thrilled; his eyes inflamed.\\n\\n\\\"Thou hast heard of the God of my fathers,\\\" he said; \\\"of the infinite Jehovah. By his truth and almightiness, and by the love with which he hath followed Israel from the beginning, I swear I am innocent!\\\"\\n\\nThe tribune was much moved.\\n\\n\\\"O noble Roman!\\\" continued Ben-Hur, \\\"give me a little faith, and, into my darkness, deeper darkening every day, send a light!\\\"\\n\\nArrius turned away, and walked the deck.\\n\\n\\\"Didst thou not have a trial?\\\" he asked, stopping suddenly.\\n\\n\\\"No!\\\"\\n\\nThe Roman raised his head, surprised.\\n\\n\\\"No trial--no witnesses! Who passed judgment upon thee?\\\"\\n\\nRomans, it should be remembered, were at no time such lovers of the law and its forms as in the ages of their decay.\\n\\n\\\"They bound me with cords, and dragged me to a vault in the Tower. I saw no one. No one spoke to me. Next day soldiers took me to the seaside. I have been a galley-slave ever since.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What couldst thou have proven?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I was a boy, too young to be a conspirator. Gratus was a stranger to me. If I had meant to kill him, that was not the time or the place. He was riding in the midst of a legion, and it was broad day. I could not have escaped. I was of a class most friendly to Rome. My father had been distinguished for his services to the emperor. We had a great estate to lose. Ruin was certain to myself, my mother, my sister. I had no cause for malice, while every consideration--property, family, life, conscience, the Law--to a son of Israel as the breath of his nostrils--would have stayed my hand, though the foul intent had been ever so strong. I was not mad. Death was preferable to shame; and, believe me, I pray, it is so yet.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who was with thee when the blow was struck?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I was on the house-top--my father's house. Tirzah was with me-- at my side--the soul of gentleness. Together we leaned over the parapet to see the legion pass. A tile gave way under my hand, and fell upon Gratus. I thought I had killed him. Ah, what horror I felt!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where was thy mother?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In her chamber below.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What became of her?\\\"\\n\\nBen-Hur clenched his hands, and drew a breath like a gasp.\\n\\n\\\"I do not know. I saw them drag her away--that is all I know. Out of the house they drove every living thing, even the dumb cattle, and they sealed the gates. The purpose was that she should not return. I, too, ask for her. Oh for one word! She, at least, was innocent. I can forgive--but I pray thy pardon, noble tribune! A slave like me should not talk of forgiveness or of revenge. I am bound to an oar for life.\\\"\\n\\nArrius listened intently. He brought all his experience with slaves to his aid. If the feeling shown in this instance were assumed, the acting was perfect; on the other hand, if it were real, the Jew's innocence might not be doubted; and if he were innocent, with what blind fury the power had been exercised! A whole family blotted out to atone an accident! The thought shocked him.\\n\\nThere is no wiser providence than that our occupations, however rude or bloody, cannot wear us out morally; that such qualities as justice and mercy, if they really possess us, continue to live on under them, like flowers under the snow. The tribune could be inexorable, else he had not been fit for the usages of his calling; he could also be just; and to excite his sense of wrong was to put him in the way to right the wrong. The crews of the ships in which he served came after a time to speak of him as the good tribune. Shrewd readers will not want a better definition of his character.\\n\\nIn this instance there were many circumstances certainly in the young man's favor, and some to be supposed. Possibly Arrius knew Valerius Gratus without loving him. Possibly he had known the elder Hur. In the course of his appeal, Judah had asked him of that; and, as will be noticed, he had made no reply.\\n\\nFor once the tribune was at loss, and hesitated. His power was ample. He was monarch of the ship. His prepossessions all moved him to mercy. His faith was won. Yet, he said to himself, there was no haste--or, rather, there was haste to Cythera; the best rower could not then be spared; he would wait; he would learn more; he would at least be sure this was the prince Ben-Hur, and that he was of a right disposition. Ordinarily, slaves were liars.\\n\\n\\\"It is enough,\\\" he said aloud. \\\"Go back to thy place.\\\"\\n\\nBen-Hur bowed; looked once more into the master's face, but saw nothing for hope. He turned away slowly, looked back, and said,\\n\\n\\\"If thou dost think of me again, O tribune, let it not be lost in thy mind that I prayed thee only for word of my people--mother, sister.\\\"\\n\\nHe moved on.\\n\\nArrius followed him with admiring eyes.\\n\\n\\\"Perpol!\\\" he thought. \\\"With teaching, what a man for the arena! What a runner! Ye gods! what an arm for the sword or the cestus!--Stay!\\\" he said aloud.\\n\\nBen-Hur stopped, and the tribune went to him.\\n\\n\\\"If thou wert free, what wouldst thou do?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The noble Arrius mocks me!\\\" Judah said, with trembling lips.\\n\\n\\\"No; by the gods, no!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then I will answer gladly. I would give myself to duty the first of life. I would know no other. I would know no rest until my mother and Tirzah were restored to home. I would give every day and hour to their happiness. I would wait upon them; never a slave more faithful. They have lost much, but, by the God of my fathers, I would find them more!\\\"\\n\\nThe answer was unexpected by the Roman. For a moment he lost his purpose.\\n\\n\\\"I spoke to thy ambition,\\\" he said, recovering. \\\"If thy mother and sister were dead, or not to be found, what wouldst thou do?\\\"\\n\\nA distinct pallor overspread Ben-Hur's face, and he looked over the sea. There was a struggle with some strong feeling; when it was conquered, he turned to the tribune.\\n\\n\\\"What pursuit would I follow?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tribune, I will tell thee truly. Only the night before the dreadful day of which I have spoken, I obtained permission to be a soldier. I am of the same mind yet; and, as in all the earth there is but one school of war, thither I would go.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The palaestra!\\\" exclaimed Arrius.\\n\\n\\\"No; a Roman camp.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But thou must first acquaint thyself with the use of arms.\\\"\\n\\nNow a master may never safely advise a slave. Arrius saw his indiscretion, and, in a breath, chilled his voice and manner.\\n\\n\\\"Go now,\\\" he said, \\\"and do not build upon what has passed between us. Perhaps I do but play with thee. Or\\\"--he looked away musingly-- \\\"or, if thou dost think of it with any hope, choose between the renown of a gladiator and the service of a soldier. The former may come of the favor of the emperor; there is no reward for thee in the latter. Thou art not a Roman. Go!\\\"\\n\\nA short while after Ben-Hur was upon his bench again.\\n\\nA man's task is always light if his heart is light. Handling the oar did not seem so toilsome to Judah. A hope had come to him, like a singing bird. He could hardly see the visitor or hear its song; that it was there, though, he knew; his feelings told him so. The caution of the tribune--\\\"Perhaps I do but play with thee\\\"--was dismissed often as it recurred to his mind. That he had been called by the great man and asked his story was the bread upon which he fed his hungry spirit. Surely something good would come of it. The light about his bench was clear and bright with promises, and he prayed.\\n\\n\\\"O God! I am a true son of the Israel thou hast so loved! Help me, I pray thee!\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nIn the Bay of Antemona, east of Cythera the island, the hundred galleys assembled. There the tribune gave one day to inspection. He sailed then to Naxos, the largest of the Cyclades, midway the coasts of Greece and Asia, like a great stone planted in the centre of a highway, from which he could challenge everything that passed; at the same time, he would be in position to go after the pirates instantly, whether they were in the AEgean or out on the Mediterranean.\\n\\nAs the fleet, in order, rowed in towards the mountain shores of the island, a galley was descried coming from the north. Arrius went to meet it. She proved to be a transport just from Byzantium, and from her commander he learned the particulars of which he stood in most need.\\n\\nThe pirates were from all the farther shores of the Euxine. Even Tanais, at the mouth of the river which was supposed to feed Palus Maeotis, was represented among them. Their preparations had been with the greatest secrecy. The first known of them was their appearance off the entrance to the Thracian Bosphorus, followed by the destruction of the fleet in station there. Thence to the outlet of the Hellespont everything afloat had fallen their prey. There were quite sixty galleys in the squadron, all well manned and supplied. A few were biremes, the rest stout triremes. A Greek was in command, and the pilots, said to be familiar with all the Eastern seas, were Greek. The plunder had been incalculable. The panic, consequently, was not on the sea alone; cities, with closed gates, sent their people nightly to the walls. Traffic had almost ceased.\\n\\nWhere were the pirates now?\\n\\nTo this question, of most interest to Arrius, he received answer.\\n\\nAfter sacking Hephaestia, on the island of Lemnos, the enemy had coursed across to the Thessalian group, and, by last account, disappeared in the gulfs between Euboea and Hellas.\\n\\nSuch were the tidings.\\n\\nThen the people of the island, drawn to the hill-tops by the rare spectacle of a hundred ships careering in united squadron, beheld the advance division suddenly turn to the north, and the others follow, wheeling upon the same point like cavalry in a column. News of the piratical descent had reached them, and now, watching the white sails until they faded from sight up between Rhene and Syros, the thoughtful among them took comfort, and were grateful. What Rome seized with strong hand she always defended: in return for their taxes, she gave them safety.\\n\\nThe tribune was more than pleased with the enemy's movements; he was doubly thankful to Fortune. She had brought swift and sure intelligence, and had lured his foes into the waters where, of all others, destruction was most assured. He knew the havoc one galley could play in a broad sea like the Mediterranean, and the difficulty of finding and overhauling her; he knew, also, how those very circumstances would enhance the service and glory if, at one blow, he could put a finish to the whole piratical array.\\n\\nIf the reader will take a map of Greece and the AEgean, he will notice the island of Euboea lying along the classic coast like a rampart against Asia, leaving a channel between it and the continent quite a hundred and twenty miles in length, and scarcely an average of eight in width. The inlet on the north had admitted the fleet of Xerxes, and now it received the bold raiders from the Euxine. The towns along the Pelasgic and Meliac gulfs were rich and their plunder seductive. All things considered, therefore, Arrius judged that the robbers might be found somewhere below Thermopylae. Welcoming the chance, he resolved to enclose them north and south, to do which not an hour could be lost; even the fruits and wines and women of Naxos must be left behind. So he sailed away without stop or tack until, a little before nightfall, Mount Ocha was seen upreared against the sky, and the pilot reported the Euboean coast.\\n\\nAt a signal the fleet rested upon its oars. When the movement was resumed, Arrius led a division of fifty of the galleys, intending to take them up the channel, while another division, equally strong, turned their prows to the outer or seaward side of the island, with orders to make all haste to the upper inlet, and descend sweeping the waters.\\n\\nTo be sure, neither division was equal in number to the pirates; but each had advantages in compensation, among them, by no means least, a discipline impossible to a lawless horde, however brave. Besides, it was a shrewd count on the tribune's side, if, peradventure, one should be defeated, the other would find the enemy shattered by his victory, and in condition to be easily overwhelmed.\\n\\nMeantime Ben-Hur kept his bench, relieved every six hours. The rest in the Bay of Antemona had freshened him, so that the oar was not troublesome, and the chief on the platform found no fault.\\n\\nPeople, generally, are not aware of the ease of mind there is in knowing where they are, and where they are going. The sensation of being lost is a keen distress; still worse is the feeling one has in driving blindly into unknown places. Custom had dulled the feeling with Ben-Hur, but only measurably. Pulling away hour after hour, sometimes days and nights together, sensible all the time that the galley was gliding swiftly along some of the many tracks of the broad sea, the longing to know where he was, and whither going, was always present with him; but now it seemed quickened by the hope which had come to new life in his breast since the interview with the tribune. The narrower the abiding-place happens to be, the more intense is the longing; and so he found. He seemed to hear every sound of the ship in labor, and listened to each one as if it were a voice come to tell him something; he looked to the grating overhead, and through it into the light of which so small a portion was his, expecting, he knew not what; and many times he caught himself on the point of yielding to the impulse to speak to the chief on the platform, than which no circumstance of battle would have astonished that dignitary more.\\n\\nIn his long service, by watching the shifting of the meager sunbeams upon the cabin floor when the ship was under way, he had come to know, generally, the quarter into which she was sailing. This, of course, was only of clear days like those good-fortune was sending the tribune. The experience had not failed him in the period succeeding the departure from Cythera. Thinking they were tending towards the old Judean country, he was sensitive to every variation from the course. With a pang, he had observed the sudden change northward which, as has been noticed, took place near Naxos: the cause, however, he could not even conjecture; for it must be remembered that, in common with his fellow-slaves, he knew nothing of the situation, and had no interest in the voyage. His place was at the oar, and he was held there inexorably, whether at anchor or under sail. Once only in three years had he been permitted an outlook from the deck. The occasion we have seen. He had no idea that, following the vessel he was helping drive, there was a great squadron close at hand and in beautiful order; no more did he know the object of which it was in pursuit.\\n\\nWhen the sun, going down, withdrew his last ray from the cabin, the galley still held northward. Night fell, yet Ben-Hur could discern no change. About that time the smell of incense floated down the gangways from the deck.\\n\\n\\\"The tribune is at the altar,\\\" he thought. \\\"Can it be we are going into battle?\\\"\\n\\nHe became observant.\\n\\nNow he had been in many battles without having seen one. From his bench he had heard them above and about him, until he was familiar with all their notes, almost as a singer with a song. So, too, he had become acquainted with many of the preliminaries of an engagement, of which, with a Roman as well as a Greek, the most invariable was the sacrifice to the gods. The rites were the same as those performed at the beginning of a voyage, and to him, when noticed, they were always an admonition.\\n\\nA battle, it should be observed, possessed for him and his fellow-slaves of the oar an interest unlike that of the sailor and marine; it came, not of the danger encountered but of the fact that defeat, if survived, might bring an alteration of condition--possibly freedom--at least a change of masters, which might be for the better.\\n\\nIn good time the lanterns were lighted and hung by the stairs, and the tribune came down from the deck. At his word the marines put on their armor. At his word again, the machines were looked to, and spears, javelins, and arrows, in great sheaves, brought and laid upon the floor, together with jars of inflammable oil, and baskets of cotton balls wound loose like the wicking of candles. And when, finally, Ben-Hur saw the tribune mount his platform and don his armor, and get his helmet and shield out, the meaning of the preparations might not be any longer doubted, and he made ready for the last ignominy of his service.\\n\\nTo every bench, as a fixture, there was a chain with heavy anklets. These the hortator proceeded to lock upon the oarsmen, going from number to number, leaving no choice but to obey, and, in event of disaster, no possibility of escape.\\n\\nIn the cabin, then, a silence fell, broken, at first, only by the sough of the oars turning in the leathern cases. Every man upon the benches felt the shame, Ben-Hur more keenly than his companions. He would have put it away at any price. Soon the clanking of the fetters notified him of the progress the chief was making in his round. He would come to him in turn; but would not the tribune interpose for him?\\n\\nThe thought may be set down to vanity or selfishness, as the reader pleases; it certainly, at that moment, took possession of Ben-Hur. He believed the Roman would interpose; anyhow, the circumstance would test the man's feelings. If, intent upon the battle, he would but think of him, it would be proof of his opinion formed--proof that he had been tacitly promoted above his associates in misery--such proof as would justify hope.\\n\\nBen-Hur waited anxiously. The interval seemed like an age. At every turn of the oar he looked towards the tribune, who, his simple preparations made, lay down upon the couch and composed himself to rest; whereupon number sixty chid himself, and laughed grimly, and resolved not to look that way again.\\n\\nThe hortator approached. Now he was at number one--the rattle of the iron links sounded horribly. At last number sixty! Calm from despair, Ben-Hur held his oar at poise, and gave his foot to the officer. Then the tribune stirred--sat up--beckoned to the chief.\\n\\nA strong revulsion seized the Jew. From the hortator, the great man glanced at him; and when he dropped his oar all the section of the ship on his side seemed aglow. He heard nothing of what was said; enough that the chain hung idly from its staple in the bench, and that the chief, going to his seat, began to beat the sounding-board. The notes of the gavel were never so like music. With his breast against the leaded handle, he pushed with all his might--pushed until the shaft bent as if about to break.\\n\\nThe chief went to the tribune, and, smiling, pointed to number sixty.\\n\\n\\\"What strength!\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"And what spirit!\\\" the tribune answered. \\\"Perpol! He is better without the irons. Put them on him no more.\\\"\\n\\nSo saying, he stretched himself upon the couch again.\\n\\nThe ship sailed on hour after hour under the oars in water scarcely rippled by the wind. And the people not on duty slept, Arrius in his place, the marines on the floor.\\n\\nOnce--twice--Ben-Hur was relieved; but he could not sleep. Three years of night, and through the darkness a sunbeam at last! At sea adrift and lost, and now land! Dead so long, and, lo! the thrill and stir of resurrection. Sleep was not for such an hour. Hope deals with the future; now and the past are but servants that wait on her with impulse and suggestive circumstance. Starting from the favor of the tribune, she carried him forward indefinitely. The wonder is, not that things so purely imaginative as the results she points us to can make us so happy, but that we can receive them as so real. They must be as gorgeous poppies under the influence of which, under the crimson and purple and gold, reason lies down the while, and is not. Sorrows assuaged, home and the fortunes of his house restored; mother and sister in his arms once more--such were the central ideas which made him happier that moment than he had ever been. That he was rushing, as on wings, into horrible battle had, for the time, nothing to do with his thoughts. The things thus in hope were unmixed with doubts--they WERE. Hence his joy so full, so perfect, there was no room in his heart for revenge. Messala, Gratus, Rome, and all the bitter, passionate memories connected with them, were as dead plagues--miasms of the earth above which he floated, far and safe, listening to singing stars.\\n\\nThe deeper darkness before the dawn was upon the waters, and all things going well with the Astroea, when a man, descending from the deck, walked swiftly to the platform where the tribune slept, and awoke him. Arrius arose, put on his helmet, sword, and shield, and went to the commander of the marines.\\n\\n\\\"The pirates are close by. Up and ready!\\\" he said, and passed to the stairs, calm, confident, insomuch that one might have thought, \\\"Happy fellow! Apicius has set a feast for him.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nEvery soul aboard, even the ship, awoke. Officers went to their quarters. The marines took arms, and were led out, looking in all respects like legionaries. Sheaves of arrows and armfuls of javelins were carried on deck. By the central stairs the oil-tanks and fire-balls were set ready for use. Additional lanterns were lighted. Buckets were filled with water. The rowers in relief assembled under guard in front of the chief. As Providence would have it, Ben-Hur was one of the latter. Overhead he heard the muffled noises of the final preparations--of the sailors furling sail, spreading the nettings, unslinging the machines, and hanging the armor of bull-hide over the side. Presently quiet settled about the galley again; quiet full of vague dread and expectation, which, interpreted, means READY.\\n\\nAt a signal passed down from the deck, and communicated to the hortator by a petty officer stationed on the stairs, all at once the oars stopped.\\n\\nWhat did it mean?\\n\\nOf the hundred and twenty slaves chained to the benches, not one but asked himself the question. They were without incentive. Patriotism, love of honor, sense of duty, brought them no inspiration. They felt the thrill common to men rushed helpless and blind into danger. It may be supposed the dullest of them, poising his oar, thought of all that might happen, yet could promise himself nothing; for victory would but rivet his chains the firmer, while the chances of the ship were his; sinking or on fire, he was doomed to her fate.\\n\\nOf the situation without they might not ask. And who were the enemy? And what if they were friends, brethren, countrymen? The reader, carrying the suggestion forward, will see the necessity which governed the Roman when, in such emergencies, he locked the hapless wretches to their seats.\\n\\nThere was little time, however, for such thought with them. A sound like the rowing of galleys astern attracted Ben-Hur, and the Astroea rocked as if in the midst of countering waves. The idea of a fleet at hand broke upon him--a fleet in manoeuvre-- forming probably for attack. His blood started with the fancy.\\n\\nAnother signal came down from the deck. The oars dipped, and the galley started imperceptibly. No sound from without, none from within, yet each man in the cabin instinctively poised himself for a shock; the very ship seemed to catch the sense, and hold its breath, and go crouched tiger-like.\\n\\nIn such a situation time is inappreciable; so that Ben-Hur could form no judgment of distance gone. At last there was a sound of trumpets on deck, full, clear, long blown. The chief beat the sounding-board until it rang; the rowers reached forward full length, and, deepening the dip of their oars, pulled suddenly with all their united force. The galley, quivering in every timber, answered with a leap. Other trumpets joined in the clamor--all from the rear, none forward--from the latter quarter only a rising sound of voices in tumult heard briefly. There was a mighty blow; the rowers in front of the chief's platform reeled, some of them fell; the ship bounded back, recovered, and rushed on more irresistibly than before. Shrill and high arose the shrieks of men in terror; over the blare of trumpets, and the grind and crash of the collision, they arose; then under his feet, under the keel, pounding, rumbling, breaking to pieces, drowning, Ben-Hur felt something overridden. The men about him looked at each other afraid. A shout of triumph from the deck-- the beak of the Roman had won! But who were they whom the sea had drunk? Of what tongue, from what land were they?\\n\\nNo pause, no stay! Forward rushed the Astroea; and, as it went, some sailors ran down, and plunging the cotton balls into the oil-tanks, tossed them dripping to comrades at the head of the stairs: fire was to be added to other horrors of the combat.\\n\\nDirectly the galley heeled over so far that the oarsmen on the uppermost side with difficulty kept their benches. Again the hearty Roman cheer, and with it despairing shrieks. An opposing vessel, caught by the grappling-hooks of the great crane swinging from the prow, was being lifted into the air that it might be dropped and sunk.\\n\\nThe shouting increased on the right hand and on the left; before, behind, swelled an indescribable clamor. Occasionally there was a crash, followed by sudden peals of fright, telling of other ships ridden down, and their crews drowned in the vortexes.\\n\\nNor was the fight all on one side. Now and then a Roman in armor was borne down the hatchway, and laid bleeding, sometimes dying, on the floor.\\n\\nSometimes, also, puffs of smoke, blended with steam, and foul with the scent of roasting human flesh, poured into the cabin, turning the dimming light into yellow murk. Gasping for breath the while, Ben-Hur knew they were passing through the cloud of a ship on fire, and burning up with the rowers chained to the benches.\\n\\nThe Astroea all this time was in motion. Suddenly she stopped. The oars forward were dashed from the hands of the rowers, and the rowers from their benches. On deck, then, a furious trampling, and on the sides a grinding of ships afoul of each other. For the first time the beating of the gavel was lost in the uproar. Men sank on the floor in fear or looked about seeking a hiding-place. In the midst of the panic a body plunged or was pitched headlong down the hatchway, falling near Ben-Hur. He beheld the half-naked carcass, a mass of hair blackening the face, and under it a shield of bull-hide and wicker-work--a barbarian from the white-skinned nations of the North whom death had robbed of plunder and revenge. How came he there? An iron hand had snatched him from the opposing deck--no, the Astroea had been boarded! The Romans were fighting on their own deck? A chill smote the young Jew: Arrius was hard pressed--he might be defending his own life. If he should be slain! God of Abraham forefend! The hopes and dreams so lately come, were they only hopes and dreams? Mother and sister--house--home--Holy Land--was he not to see them, after all? The tumult thundered above him; he looked around; in the cabin all was confusion--the rowers on the benches paralyzed; men running blindly hither and thither; only the chief on his seat imperturbable, vainly beating the sounding-board, and waiting the orders of the tribune--in the red murk illustrating the matchless discipline which had won the world.\\n\\nThe example had a good effect upon Ben-Hur. He controlled himself enough to think. Honor and duty bound the Roman to the platform; but what had he to do with such motives then? The bench was a thing to run from; while, if he were to die a slave, who would be the better of the sacrifice? With him living was duty, if not honor. His life belonged to his people. They arose before him never more real: he saw them, their arms outstretched; he heard them imploring him. And he would go to them. He started--stopped. Alas! a Roman judgment held him in doom. While it endured, escape would be profitless. In the wide, wide earth there was no place in which he would be safe from the imperial demand; upon the land none, nor upon the sea. Whereas he required freedom according to the forms of law, so only could he abide in Judea and execute the filial purpose to which he would devote himself: in other land he would not live. Dear God! How he had waited and watched and prayed for such a release! And how it had been delayed! But at last he had seen it in the promise of the tribune. What else the great man's meaning? And if the benefactor so belated should now be slain! The dead come not back to redeem the pledges of the living. It should not be--Arrius should not die. At least, better perish with him than survive a galley-slave.\\n\\nOnce more Ben-Hur looked around. Upon the roof of the cabin the battle yet beat; against the sides the hostile vessels yet crushed and grided. On the benches, the slaves struggled to tear loose from their chains, and, finding their efforts vain, howled like madmen; the guards had gone upstairs; discipline was out, panic in. No, the chief kept his chair, unchanged, calm as ever--except the gavel, weaponless. Vainly with his clangor he filled the lulls in the din. Ben-Hur gave him a last look, then broke away--not in flight, but to seek the tribune.\\n\\nA very short space lay between him and the stairs of the hatchway aft. He took it with a leap, and was half-way up the steps--up far enough to catch a glimpse of the sky blood-red with fire, of the ships alongside, of the sea covered with ships and wrecks, of the fight closed in about the pilot's quarter, the assailants many, the defenders few--when suddenly his foothold was knocked away, and he pitched backward. The floor, when he reached it, seemed to be lifting itself and breaking to pieces; then, in a twinkling, the whole after-part of the hull broke asunder, and, as if it had all the time been lying in wait, the sea, hissing and foaming, leaped in, and all became darkness and surging water to Ben-Hur.\\n\\nIt cannot be said that the young Jew helped himself in this stress. Besides his usual strength, he had the indefinite extra force which nature keeps in reserve for just such perils to life; yet the darkness, and the whirl and roar of water, stupefied him. Even the holding his breath was involuntary.\\n\\nThe influx of the flood tossed him like a log forward into the cabin, where he would have drowned but for the refluence of the sinking motion. As it was, fathoms under the surface the hollow mass vomited him forth, and he arose along with the loosed debris. In the act of rising, he clutched something, and held to it. The time he was under seemed an age longer than it really was; at last he gained the top; with a great gasp he filled his lungs afresh, and, tossing the water from his hair and eyes, climbed higher upon the plank he held, and looked about him.\\n\\nDeath had pursued him closely under the waves; he found it waiting for him when he was risen--waiting multiform.\\n\\nSmoke lay upon the sea like a semitransparent fog, through which here and there shone cores of intense brilliance. A quick intelligence told him that they were ships on fire. The battle was yet on; nor could he say who was victor. Within the radius of his vision now and then ships passed, shooting shadows athwart lights. Out of the dun clouds farther on he caught the crash of other ships colliding. The danger, however, was closer at hand. When the Astroea went down, her deck, it will be recollected, held her own crew, and the crews of the two galleys which had attacked her at the same time, all of whom were ingulfed. Many of them came to the surface together, and on the same plank or support of whatever kind continued the combat, begun possibly in the vortex fathoms down. Writhing and twisting in deadly embrace, sometimes striking with sword or javelin, they kept the sea around them in agitation, at one place inky-black, at another aflame with fiery reflections. With their struggles he had nothing to do; they were all his enemies: not one of them but would kill him for the plank upon which he floated. He made haste to get away.\\n\\nAbout that time he heard oars in quickest movement, and beheld a galley coming down upon him. The tall prow seemed doubly tall, and the red light playing upon its gilt and carving gave it an appearance of snaky life. Under its foot the water churned to flying foam.\\n\\nHe struck out, pushing the plank, which was very broad and unmanageable. Seconds were precious--half a second might save or lose him. In the crisis of the effort, up from the sea, within arm's reach, a helmet shot like a gleam of gold. Next came two hands with fingers extended--large hands were they, and strong-- their hold once fixed, might not be loosed. Ben-Hur swerved from them appalled. Up rose the helmet and the head it encased--then two arms, which began to beat the water wildly--the head turned back, and gave the face to the light. The mouth gaping wide; the eyes open, but sightless, and the bloodless pallor of a drowning man--never anything more ghastly! Yet he gave a cry of joy at the sight, and as the face was going under again, he caught the sufferer by the chain which passed from the helmet beneath the chin, and drew him to the plank.\\n\\nThe man was Arrius, the tribune.\\n\\nFor a while the water foamed and eddied violently about Ben-Hur, taxing all his strength to hold to the support and at the same time keep the Roman's head above the surface. The galley had passed, leaving the two barely outside the stroke of its oars. Right through the floating men, over heads helmeted as well as heads bare, she drove, in her wake nothing but the sea sparkling with fire. A muffled crash, succeeded by a great outcry, made the rescuer look again from his charge. A certain savage pleasure touched his heart--the Astroea was avenged.\\n\\nAfter that the battle moved on. Resistance turned to flight. But who were the victors? Ben-Hur was sensible how much his freedom and the life of the tribune depended upon that event. He pushed the plank under the latter until it floated him, after which all his care was to keep him there. The dawn came slowly. He watched its growing hopefully, yet sometimes afraid. Would it bring the Romans or the pirates? If the pirates, his charge was lost.\\n\\nAt last morning broke in full, the air without a breath. Off to the left he saw the land, too far to think of attempting to make it. Here and there men were adrift like himself. In spots the sea was blackened by charred and sometimes smoking fragments. A galley up a long way was lying to with a torn sail hanging from the tilted yard, and the oars all idle. Still farther away he could discern moving specks, which he thought might be ships in flight or pursuit, or they might be white birds a-wing.\\n\\nAn hour passed thus. His anxiety increased. If relief came not speedily, Arrius would die. Sometimes he seemed already dead, he lay so still. He took the helmet off, and then, with greater difficulty, the cuirass; the heart he found fluttering. He took hope at the sign, and held on. There was nothing to do but wait, and, after the manner of his people, pray.\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nThe throes of recovery from drowning are more painful than the drowning. These Arrius passed through, and, at length, to Ben-Hur's delight, reached the point of speech.\\n\\nGradually, from incoherent questions as to where he was, and by whom and how he had been saved, he reverted to the battle. The doubt of the victory stimulated his faculties to full return, a result aided not a little by a long rest--such as could be had on their frail support. After a while he became talkative.\\n\\n\\\"Our rescue, I see, depends upon the result of the fight. I see also what thou hast done for me. To speak fairly, thou hast saved my life at the risk of thy own. I make the acknowledgment broadly; and, whatever cometh, thou hast my thanks. More than that, if fortune doth but serve me kindly, and we get well out of this peril, I will do thee such favor as becometh a Roman who hath power and opportunity to prove his gratitude. Yet, yet it is to be seen if, with thy good intent, thou hast really done me a kindness; or, rather, speaking to thy good-will\\\"--he hesitated--\\\"I would exact of thee a promise to do me, in a certain event, the greatest favor one man can do another--and of that let me have thy pledge now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If the thing be not forbidden, I will do it,\\\" Ben-Hur replied.\\n\\nArrius rested again.\\n\\n\\\"Art thou, indeed, a son of Hur, the Jew?\\\" he next asked.\\n\\n\\\"It is as I have said.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I knew thy father--\\\"\\n\\nJudah drew himself nearer, for the tribune's voice was weak--he drew nearer, and listened eagerly--at last he thought to hear of home.\\n\\n\\\"I knew him, and loved him,\\\" Arrius continued.\\n\\nThere was another pause, during which something diverted the speaker's thought.\\n\\n\\\"It cannot be,\\\" he proceeded, \\\"that thou, a son of his, hast not heard of Cato and Brutus. They were very great men, and never as great as in death. In their dying, they left this law--A Roman may not survive his good-fortune. Art thou listening?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hear.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is a custom of gentlemen in Rome to wear a ring. There is one on my hand. Take it now.\\\"\\n\\nHe held the hand to Judah, who did as he asked.\\n\\n\\\"Now put it on thine own hand.\\\"\\n\\nBen-Hur did so.\\n\\n\\\"The trinket hath its uses,\\\" said Arrius next. \\\"I have property and money. I am accounted rich even in Rome. I have no family. Show the ring to my freedman, who hath control in my absence; you will find him in a villa near Misenum. Tell him how it came to thee, and ask anything, or all he may have; he will not refuse the demand. If I live, I will do better by thee. I will make thee free, and restore thee to thy home and people; or thou mayst give thyself to the pursuit that pleaseth thee most. Dost thou hear?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I could not choose but hear.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then pledge me. By the gods--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nay, good tribune, I am a Jew.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"By thy God, then, or in the form most sacred to those of thy faith--pledge me to do what I tell thee now, and as I tell thee; I am waiting, let me have thy promise.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Noble Arrius, I am warned by thy manner to expect something of gravest concern. Tell me thy wish first.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Wilt thou promise then?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That were to give the pledge, and-- Blessed be the God of my fathers! yonder cometh a ship!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In what direction?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"From the north.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Canst thou tell her nationality by outward signs?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. My service hath been at the oars.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hath she a flag?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I cannot see one.\\\"\\n\\nArrius remained quiet some time, apparently in deep reflection.\\n\\n\\\"Does the ship hold this way yet?\\\" he at length asked.\\n\\n\\\"Still this way.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Look for the flag now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She hath none.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nor any other sign?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She hath a sail set, and is of three banks, and cometh swiftly-- that is all I can say of her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A Roman in triumph would have out many flags. She must be an enemy. Hear now,\\\" said Arrius, becoming grave again, \\\"hear, while yet I may speak. If the galley be a pirate, thy life is safe; they may not give thee freedom; they may put thee to the oar again; but they will not kill thee. On the other hand, I--\\\"\\n\\nThe tribune faltered.\\n\\n\\\"Perpol!\\\" he continued, resolutely. \\\"I am too old to submit to dishonor. In Rome, let them tell how Quintus Arrius, as became a Roman tribune, went down with his ship in the midst of the foe. This is what I would have thee do. If the galley prove a pirate, push me from the plank and drown me. Dost thou hear? Swear thou wilt do it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will not swear,\\\" said Ben-Hur, firmly; \\\"neither will I do the deed. The Law, which is to me most binding, O tribune, would make me answerable for thy life. Take back the ring\\\"--he took the seal from his finger--\\\"take it back, and all thy promises of favor in the event of delivery from this peril. The judgment which sent me to the oar for life made me a slave, yet I am not a slave; no more am I thy freedman. I am a son of Israel, and this moment, at least, my own master. Take back the ring.\\\"\\n\\nArrius remained passive.\",\"timestamp\":1640142698,\"title\":\"But our best rower,\\\" said the other. \\\"I have seen his oar bend almost to breaking.\"},\"digest\":\"TzJie28PjFnglwADb_ot8_YWLj_pvD6clhccp7pLHrI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x64C49f050417521e14CDAd1447c72F8234716Cd7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"V1q06qKzGn96flq17rScYGdVtWlCdDHtnIB_6uc8rNU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"9BwcyLVFt0eSRSm494PlCk312yczpm27HgReGNsRnnM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"BYk30OsEk8FmnogfnmAMX43kVoYBRsFRdQAMcqoHwoCy4zcpRZsD7k9wu2GoxPIX3LzULg3seQ5iRInHDA7_aQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x15584020b0a9bde8f283a328236fa5913ddc711868963002b9e0226ee8b9486e7107fd3d88a8f48cd20e52a012cbe86e65526ab1feec0d27e03075a7b8e1b9d61b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"V1q06qKzGn96flq17rScYGdVtWlCdDHtnIB_6uc8rNU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"9BwcyLVFt0eSRSm494PlCk312yczpm27HgReGNsRnnM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"TzJie28PjFnglwADb_ot8_YWLj_pvD6clhccp7pLHrI\"}"
