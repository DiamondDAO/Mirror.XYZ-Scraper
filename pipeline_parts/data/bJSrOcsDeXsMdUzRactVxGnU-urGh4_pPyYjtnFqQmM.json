"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"ã€€Yesterday afternoon I left the house at about three o'clock and did not get home until 5:30. I Went to see a friend of mine. My friend, Nancy Huang, was in the hospital. We talked, all after- noon. We talked about a lot of different subjects. We talked about the weather, and we talked about our old friends. I asked a lot of questions. She answered all of my questions. Then she asked me if I spoke French, and I said I spoke Little French. She wanted to know if I spoke French with an accent, and I said I did. Finally, I asked her if she wanted to watch television for and then I said good-bye. She said good bye. And I left the hospital at about five o'clock.\",\"timestamp\":1639034350,\"title\":\"A Visit to the Hospital\"},\"digest\":\"6hZVMy3faZvXhfYVxAOA9K8PW9UxoIbe8cILac-9v-4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xB8cF4633E4E88CA6675ED1ebD4C62528F9870148\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hXfzedBEny8l9DYUIJuDxZPBso2F7luRsKkakPWbivI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mIdPaoe7zKkty2Rd7HtuSQT55CBkSM3qY9bvZUtFVZQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"TPIKJwUfEkUXkzbXGyTgwHAvFNXqIbZH4JWkggd0gTIo6QAsshCbahrHXP0se7_x4eJ87VQEW46p1q6nEA2bPQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xcaf791b3fdf2329dc6792b27f33c9aa91aefc0193d9d75b0d741a5e7c63def6c7ba76e6ac38e57a604ca6c43aeab6e18f3740fe6a685d393a88da4d3001eb7731b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hXfzedBEny8l9DYUIJuDxZPBso2F7luRsKkakPWbivI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mIdPaoe7zKkty2Rd7HtuSQT55CBkSM3qY9bvZUtFVZQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"6hZVMy3faZvXhfYVxAOA9K8PW9UxoIbe8cILac-9v-4\"}"
