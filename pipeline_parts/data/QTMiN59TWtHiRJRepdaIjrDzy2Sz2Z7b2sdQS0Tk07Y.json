"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Recently, the concept of DeFi 2.0 has become popular with a batch of new design logic protocols. DeFi 2.0 has better composability, more efficient execution speed, higher capital utilization, and a more original organization and governance structure. Olympus DAO is currently the most concerned protocol of DeFi 2.0. Olympus DAO does not use liquidity provider LP mining to attract liquidity for the protocol, but uses the concept of r protocol to control value, and its innovative binding mechanism, subverting the tradition DeFi liquidity model. However, like the meta-universe concept discussed in the previous circle, so far, there is no universally recognized unified concept for DeFi 2.0 in the industry. Most of them are based on the so-called DeFi 1.0, which is the original DeFi smart contract, on the current significant problems-such as the low utilization rate of funds, the form of community organization and the governance structure.\\n\\nThe general term for smart contracts that propose further solutions for unreasonable points. And under this idea, some common characteristics are summarized, such as reputation system, linking the real world, realizing a real community governance structure, providing higher capital utilization, and smoothing or transferring risks.\\n\\nFrom the characteristics summarized above, in fact, it can be roughly found that the key to DeFi 2.0 lies in whether the characteristics summarized above are actually used. In fact, it can be roughly found that the key to DeFi 2.0 lies in whether DeFi can really play the biggest role. Advantage-that is, the composability of financial Lego. According to this key indicator, the combination of NFT+ DeFi+ games created by GameFi represented by Axie nfinity can be called DeFi.\\n\\n2\\\\.0 Boldly innovate. As an unprecedented innovation experiment in the history of human finance, DeFi will inevitably have more subversive concepts and gameplays in the future. This requires every currency investor to keep up with the times. A learning attitude can better grasp investment opportunities.\",\"timestamp\":1634578273,\"title\":\"Ride the horse, DEFI 2.0!\"},\"digest\":\"EC_IvAbjs7dK79rlIvwz1q7nA54NSyCf1xqII_ENVAM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD4bb7f64c14E8Fdc02AA7c53153F7eD4Bb8d1744\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3sbnZiCM2e49JSXz6cny_WtotrutWNT8fgix_eyYR44\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"sxXE2PePI_jdm5HYqSJD0EbPBfjsL3935wSw-FQP8F8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"rsBs8jdnLmMRZc8ixOuxiHenF1C7IZzkPyS7yBcFhu2_WfpT-byINDm9fMj1Vh7X37tl2wRikesddppoOz9LBQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xecbfef621de0c56a2a11469cd0225c6d199b6fbd0b5e2249a676b02031906f8127df8cd93b49b79132ad4347a3662f00572f25bd824e078bfaa0fdb60da1026b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3sbnZiCM2e49JSXz6cny_WtotrutWNT8fgix_eyYR44\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"sxXE2PePI_jdm5HYqSJD0EbPBfjsL3935wSw-FQP8F8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"EC_IvAbjs7dK79rlIvwz1q7nA54NSyCf1xqII_ENVAM\"}"
