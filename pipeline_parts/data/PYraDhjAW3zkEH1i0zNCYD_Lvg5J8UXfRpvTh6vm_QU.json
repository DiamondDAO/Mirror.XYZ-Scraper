"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"We have been coming to Paris regularly for about 15 years and back in 2008, I started using the Velib bike share system and wrote about it [here](https://avc.com/2008/06/velib-is-awesom/).\\n\\nA lot has changed in a decade and a half when it comes to biking in Paris. There are more bikes, more bike lanes, and more bikers.\\n\\nVelib is still a big piece of the Paris bike scene and they have a ton of pedal assist e-bikes in the system now. At most kiosks I see about half regular and half e-bikes. I wish NYC’s Citibike system had that mix in their kiosks.\\n\\nBut I’ve been using a service called DOTT this stay in Paris. Every morning I like to go out to a coffee shop that is a twelve minute walk but a four minute bike ride. So I launch the DOTT app and find the nearest bike which is usually less than a block away and unlock it with my app.\\n\\nI took this one for coffee this morning:\\n\\n![](https://avc.com/content/uploads/2021/11/PXL\\\\_20211108\\\\_074243545-scaled.jpg)\\n\\nThere are bike parking stations on almost every block in Paris and so it is easy to find a good and appropriate place to leave your bike.\\n\\nThere are also a ton of scooters in Paris but that’s always been the case here. It does seem like the use of car transport is down a bit since we were here two years ago.\\n\\nBiking around Paris is great. It’s a wonderful city to see in slow motion. Walking is certainly the best way to get around Paris but biking is a close second.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1636531172,\"title\":\"Biking In Paris\",\"publication\":\"avc\"},\"digest\":\"tOyqEBI4tq5PtSfhbqpYPu7_zchNDOtmi-mhyLKZnPo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xB8332710AB60A1B2e8FE6D775d83524C9E0cE136\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"G4zYfkpcj2_OViGlk8zlUX3DHdayO3TJ-781S3eud_k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DhednLO2HMS8h7FkGMTpgGhPiw2cbLGmh2l7x17zYJY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"JsCbdHre8HRFZH4Nb0an2POm68Q7Pyl82ZOryBTC27Ua8o749lYoeRTf0Jug4MJuJwE1npo7qZaj6xDO1QHGFQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xecabbe68f396aae1427f5971898f7fe2b013fa130d216dcf250eba219792d3653aecc90eb45518d05b73702fbd93ee558b056569727c256e9cd3f5df50e2cbff1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"G4zYfkpcj2_OViGlk8zlUX3DHdayO3TJ-781S3eud_k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DhednLO2HMS8h7FkGMTpgGhPiw2cbLGmh2l7x17zYJY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"tOyqEBI4tq5PtSfhbqpYPu7_zchNDOtmi-mhyLKZnPo\"}"
