The treatment is simply waiting for the body's immune system to recover by itself.\\n\\nI checked the universal prescription for my syndrome online, I was a kind obsession with the concept of ***node,*** as it has linkage to almost everything in our world:\\n\\n*By Medical definition*: one of many small organs in the body that remove infectious cells, germs.\\n\\nI do feel like “we” just live inside of my body, instead of owning it, if so, there are more insightful questions waiting to be answered:\\n\\n* What is calling all those lymph nodes to gather together to reflect the infection in the body as a form of swollen node?\\n* How did they can respond to the infection warning sign in such a prompt manner without our consciousness?\\n* Has our body been programmed, so it automatically coordinates and computes what we have been experienced externally?\\n\\nSimilar to virus and immune system, about our social connections:\\n\\n* If each of us is just sole node in a giant social network?\\n* What could bond random people in this giant social network?\\n* Is there any chance that every connection has been evenly randomized?\\n\\nIn James Gleick's Chaos, everything is the consequences of the **complexity**.\\n\\nIn Linked by Barabási Albert-László, he addressed **random networks**, **clusters,** and **Six Degrees of Separation and Small Worlds.** To some extends, the world is evenly constructed by each person as a node, and the whole web included everyone inside, only 6 links can connect two irrelevant nodes within this giant web.\\n\\nTo recall all those distant nodes, the mechanism is simple as to make an order, or describe it in a more humane way, to give a purpose/mission/consensus, you name it.\\n\\nSomehow the search of the answer was paused for a while until the inspiration from DAO popped up on my screen one day, why would we form an organization is why all the clusters would gathered at certain point in the history.\\n\\n![By Aragon](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-xbmactjnr2OOjZD9-y3R.png?height=802&width=1448)\\n\\n![By Aragon](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4NhtOM-Xkb9SSVAKt0CSK.png?height=781&width=1715)\\n\\n![By Aragon](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZrxxLoCVtZhEfvQkv9aIl.png?height=734&width=1479)\\n\\nIf you can interprete those terms in this order: O-A-D, the storyline would be: We to are gathered under certain mission-We agree on “freedom and individual thinking matters the most”- The best way for us to work together is equally controlled by one mission as that is why we are here.\\n\\nYou can try to make other orders of the words and make another story like O-D-A, it is fun and insipiring!\\n\\nFor now I would end this node study on one sentence:\\n\\n> *Nullius in verba*\\n\\n*— Motto of the Royal Society*\",\"timestamp\":1639110718,\"title\":\"Node —>Linkage} Reductionism\"},\"digest\":\"JoygVuwG1DXpC-AhyQy1L4les7slIPAL1j7ulW1y4jo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xb12e31D8F7DdA2Dd3733c25cB3B01F6924cd3497\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"IVw9oxXKrPubzSeWpxXOzSGflg8dgGrvl2PWPbIzYoo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"oRvoZPkyCAlpv8guIC9ao3HPxqAUWbjTSHD_HuuCtVE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"v_pEG6qMvBuAYbIHNbatJuQTc-JDljopKOJpo82wZZXbtYVyATSPQDxmXB-fcCTJGLmxTviHMRZPy1fdLuM5uQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0d35a3bd48babe454461538c9abf69d4e9420435a7619d776c3f6047d9eaba952093344eb00609caf031f94b2470dfc5eec64dd8c6aeb99d2013ed70c6a32b431b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"IVw9oxXKrPubzSeWpxXOzSGflg8dgGrvl2PWPbIzYoo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"oRvoZPkyCAlpv8guIC9ao3HPxqAUWbjTSHD_HuuCtVE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"agfIJRcSALhnAkOz4YQjs8OmyXeDtcGU7jum8X8Es00\"}"
