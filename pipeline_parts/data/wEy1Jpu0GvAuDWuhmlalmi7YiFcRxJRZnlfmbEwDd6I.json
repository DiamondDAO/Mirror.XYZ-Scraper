"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MbXstMn2zIYLDADzBYSYr.png?height=420&width=830)\\n\\nWe are very excited to announce that [Dataverse ](https://dataverse.art/)has successfully joined Ceramic mainnet and integrated its key technologies for building the Beta software. We are looking forward to collaborating with one of the most innovative teams in the Web3.0 space to build the decentralized curation layer. At present, users can curate favorite NFTs into their own private space from multiple platforms (e.g., Opensea).\\n\\nThanks to the Web3.0 technologies users can again be the central actors controlling everything related to their identity, and this is a precious and complex concept. We choose the Ceramic Network mainly because:\\n\\n* Easy-to-use decentralized identity solutions, 3ID-connect. With just a few clicks, users can create universal identities via wallets(e.g., Metamask), and connect their web2 social accounts (e.g., Twitter, Discord). Dataverse integrates this function and thus users can open their data space via identities whenever they want.\\n* User-centered data cloud, IDX. This replaces centralized user tables and enables developers to break down silos and freely share usersâ€™ data between applications. Flexible encryption options are also supported. Dataverse integrates this function to build the NFT curation standard. Users can create collections, write tags and notes. To return data ownership, users can directly encrypt and decrypt their favorite NFTs in the browser and export data to Filecoin Network.\\n\\n**Ceramic Network**\\n\\nCeramic is a decentralized network for managing and processing mutable information on the open web. By combining IPFS, libp2p, blockchain, DIDs, and standards for authenticated data, Ceramic gives developers the ability to build completely serverless and silo-free applications using dynamic, verifiable, decentralized data.\\n\\n[Website](https://ceramic.network/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork) | [Discord](http://chat.ceramic.network/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic) | [Documentation](https://developers.ceramic.network/) | [Blog](https://blog.ceramic.network/) | [IDX Identity](http://idx.xyz/)\\n\\n**What is Dataverse**\\n\\nThe Dataverse is developed by **Ownership Labs**, which is the user-centered private space for sorting and displaying your interests in one place. Users can download the chrome extension and save NFTs from several NFT websites with one-click, including Opensea, Rarible, Superare, Foundation, Zora, Async Art, Nifty Gateway, and more. Dataverse is also your DIGITAL mind. Easily track NFTs in your private space for better decision-makings. Unleash your creativity and connect with like-minded people.\\n\\n[Website](https://dataverse.art/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OwnershipLabs) | [Discord](http://discord.gg/s3K5ds8FY2) | [GitHub](https://github.com/ownership-labs) | [ownershiplabs](https://ownershiplabs.com/#/) | [Telegram](https://t.me/OwnershipLabs)\",\"timestamp\":1640849819,\"title\":\"Dataverse successfully joined the Ceramic mainnet\"},\"digest\":\"1tw-8Y7a-FU4KNsJRsMH0ET9rPS2FtCOp86cgyG645I\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xAEf0A1BA868A4Ce5465eE7244408FD1bc5EA6083\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"d9HdjxVHJJFCFIdtBMgtk1RBYe9l-GpdKPF7RKZ7qIY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Rx2n_991_Zk4Y9VRv8Wpf0-dkoqdLGffGBv6BwnnEwg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ltyXF5wKCqbnfzDSGQYFb4GswF0EmpY1NcDB0RJ_CvgRf1HUBo9aJPizJcnFRjufQg_0WC8i4IRQQMhOHXU7nw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9d6b934c7ffe08b59b6eeb8894eee461e34112a9d5607ff5d04436015e50720605f44d3bb227bf0a7a1eccc153018f4a627b7f6f150ca36db3f35246de63f6e91c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"d9HdjxVHJJFCFIdtBMgtk1RBYe9l-GpdKPF7RKZ7qIY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Rx2n_991_Zk4Y9VRv8Wpf0-dkoqdLGffGBv6BwnnEwg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"G28dIuHFIjA9Bjx5IhvikQQHg6-jTL4HdSE4haArZZ0\"}"
