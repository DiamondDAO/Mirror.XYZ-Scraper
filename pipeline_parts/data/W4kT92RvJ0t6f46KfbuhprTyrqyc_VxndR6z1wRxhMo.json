"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"But Timon would none of it, and began to insult the women.  They, however, when they found he had discovered a gold mine, cared not a jot for his opinion of them, but said, \\\"Give us some gold, good Timon.  Have you more?\\\"\\n\\nWith further insults, Timon filled their aprons with gold ore.\\n\\n\\\"Farewell,\\\" said Alcibiades, who deemed that Timon's wits were lost; and then his disciplined soldiers left without profit the mine which could have paid their wages, and marched towards Athens.\\n\\nTimon continued to dig and curse, and affected great delight when he dug up a root and discovered that it was not a grape.\\n\\nJust then Apemantus appeared.  \\\"I am told that you imitate me,\\\" said Apemantus.  \\\"Only,\\\" said Timon, \\\"because you haven't a dog which I can imitate.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are revenging yourself on your friends by punishing yourself,\\\" said Apemantus.  \\\"That is very silly, for they live just as comfortably as they ever did.  I am sorry that a fool should imitate me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If I were like you,\\\" said Timon, \\\"I should throw myself away.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have done so,\\\" sneered Apemantus.  \\\"Will the cold brook make you a good morning drink, or an east wind warm your clothes as a valet would?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Off with you!\\\" said Timon; but Apemantus stayed a while longer and told him he had a passion for extremes, which was true. Apemantus even made a pun, but there was no good laughter to be got out of Timon.\\n\\nFinally, they lost their temper like two schoolboys, and Timon said he was sorry to lose the stone which he flung at Apemantus, who left him with an evil wish.\\n\\nThis was almost an \\\"at home\\\" day for Timon, for when Apemantus had departed, he was visited by some robbers.  They wanted gold.\\n\\n\\\"You want too much,\\\" said Timon.  \\\"Here are water, roots and berries.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We are not birds and pigs,\\\" said a robber.\\n\\n\\\"No, you are cannibals,\\\" said Timon.  \\\"Take the gold, then, and may it poison you!  Henceforth rob one another.\\\"\\n\\nHe spoke so frightfully to them that, though they went away with full pockets, they almost repented of their trade.  His last visitor on that day of visits was his good steward Flavius.  \\\"My dearest master!\\\" cried he.\\n\\n\\\"Away!  What are you?\\\" said Timon.\\n\\n\\\"Have you forgotten me, sir?\\\" asked Flavius, mournfully.\\n\\n\\\"I have forgotten all men,\\\" was the reply; \\\"and if you'll allow that you are a man, I have forgotten you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I was your honest servant,\\\" said Flavius.\\n\\n\\\"Nonsense!  I never had an honest man about me,\\\" retorted Timon.\\n\\nFlavius began to cry.\\n\\n\\\"What! shedding tears?\\\" said Timon.  \\\"Come nearer, then.  I will love you because you are a woman, and unlike men, who only weep when they laugh or beg.\\\"\\n\\nThey talked awhile; then Timon said, \\\"Yon gold is mine.  I will make you rich, Flavius, if you promise me to live by yourself and hate mankind.  I will make you very rich if you promise me that you will see the flesh slide off the beggar's bones before you feed him, and let the debtor die in jail before you pay his debt.\\\"\\n\\nFlavius simply said, \\\"Let me stay to comfort you, my master.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you dislike cursing, leave me,\\\" replied Timon, and he turned his back on Flavius, who went sadly back to Athens, too much accustomed to obedience to force his services upon his ailing master.\\n\\nThe steward had accepted nothing, but a report got about that a mighty nugget of gold had been given him by his former master, and Timon therefore received more visitors.  They were a painter and a poet, whom he had patronized in his prosperity.\\n\\n\\\"Hail, worthy Timon!\\\" said the poet.  \\\"We heard with astonishment how your friends deserted you.  No whip's large enough for their backs!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We have come,\\\" put in the painter, \\\"to offer our services.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You've heard that I have gold,\\\" said Timon.\\n\\n\\\"There was a report,\\\" said the painter, blushing; \\\"but my friend and I did not come for that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good honest men!\\\" jeered Timon.  \\\"All the same, you shall have plenty of gold if you will rid me of two villains.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Name them,\\\" said his two visitors in one breath.  \\\"Both of you!\\\" answered Timon.  Giving the painter a whack with a big stick, he said, \\\"Put that into your palette and make money out of it.\\\"  Then he gave a whack to the poet, and said, \\\"Make a poem out of that and get paid for it.  There's gold for you.\\\"\\n\\nThey hurriedly withdrew.\\n\\nFinally Timon was visited by two senators who, now that Athens was threatened by Alcibiades, desired to have on their side this bitter noble whose gold might help the foe.\\n\\n\\\"Forget your injuries,\\\" said the first senator.  \\\"Athens offers you dignities whereby you may honorably live.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Athens confesses that your merit was overlooked, and wishes to atone, and more than atone, for her forgetfulness,\\\" said the second senator.\\n\\n\\\"Worthy senators,\\\" replied Timon, in his grim way, \\\"I am almost weeping; you touch me so!  All I need are the eyes of a woman and the heart of a fool.  \\\"\\n\\nBut the senators were patriots.  They believed that this bitter man could save Athens, and they would not quarrel with him.  \\\"Be our captain,\\\" they said, \\\"and lead Athens against Alcibiades, who threatens to destroy her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let him destroy the Athenians too, for all I care,\\\" said Timon; and seeing an evil despair in his face, they left him.\\n\\nThe senators returned to Athens, and soon afterwards trumpets were blown before its walls.  Upon the walls they stood and listened to Alcibiades, who told them that wrong-doers should quake in their easy chairs.  They looked at his confident army, and were convinced that Athens must yield if he assaulted it, therefore they used the voice that strikes deeper than arrows.\\n\\n\\\"These walls of ours were built by the hands of men who never wronged you, Alcibiades,\\\" said the first senator.\\n\\n\\\"Enter,\\\" said the second senator, \\\"and slay every tenth man, if your revenge needs human flesh.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Spare the cradle,\\\" said the first senator.\\n\\n\\\"I ask only justice,\\\" said Alcibiades.  \\\"If you admit my army, I will inflict the penalty of your own laws upon any soldier who breaks them.\\\"\\n\\nAt that moment a soldier approached Alcibiades, and said, \\\"My noble general, Timon is dead.\\\"  He handed Alcibiades a sheet of wax, saying, \\\"He is buried by the sea, on the beach, and over his grave is a stone with letters on it which I cannot read, and therefore I have impressed them on wax.\\\"\\n\\nAlcibiades read from the sheet of wax this couplet--\\n\\n\\\"Here lie I, Timon, who, alive,         all living men did hate.     Pass by and say your worst; but pass,         and stay not here your gait.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dead, then, is noble Timon,\\\" said Alcibiades; and be entered Athens with an olive branch instead of a sword.\\n\\nSo it was one of Timon's friends who was generous in a greater matter than Timon's need; yet are the sorrow and rage of Timon remembered as a warning lest another ingratitude should arise to turn love into hate.\\n\\nOTHELLO\\n\\nFour hundred years ago there lived in Venice an ensign named Iago, who hated his general, Othello, for not making him a lieutenant. Instead of Iago, who was strongly recommended, Othello had chosen Michael Cassio, whose smooth tongue had helped him to win the heart of Desdemona.  lago had a friend called Roderigo, who supplied him with money and felt he could not be happy unless Desdemona was his wife.\\n\\nOthello was a Moor, but of so dark a complexion that his enemies called him a Blackamoor.  His life had been hard and exciting. He had been vanquished in battle and sold into slavery; and he had been a great traveler and seen men whose shoulders were higher than their heads.  Brave as a lion, he had one great fault--jealousy. His love was a terrible selfishness.  To love a woman meant with him to possess her as absolutely as he possessed something that did not live and think.  The story of Othello is a story of jealousy.\\n\\nOne night Iago told Roderigo that Othello had carried off Desdemona without the knowledge of her father, Brabantio.  He persuaded Roderigo to arouse Brabantio, and when that senator appeared Iago told him of Desdemona's elopement in the most unpleasant way. Though he was Othello's officer, he termed him a thief and a Barbary horse.\\n\\nBrabantio accused Othello before the Duke of Venice of using sorcery to fascinate his daughter, but Othello said that the only sorcery he used was his voice, which told Desdemona his adventures and hair-breadth escapes.  Desdemona was led into the council-chamber, and she explained how she could love Othello despite his almost black face by saying, \\\"I saw Othello's visage in his mind.\\\"\\n\\nAs Othello had married Desdemona, and she was glad to be his wife, there was no more to be said against him, especially as the Duke wished him to go to Cyprus to defend it against the Turks.  Othello was quite ready to go, and Desdemona, who pleaded to go with him, was pernutted to join him at Cyprus.\\n\\nOthello's feelings on landing in this island were intensely joyful. \\\"Oh, my sweet,\\\" he said to Desdemona, who arrived with Iago, his wife, and Roderigo before him, \\\"I hardly know what I say to you. I am in love with my own happiness.\\\"\\n\\nNews coming presently that the Turkish fleet was out of action, he proclaimed a festival in Cyprus from five to eleven at night.\\n\\nCassio was on duty in the Castle where Othello ruled Cyprus, so Iago decided to make the lieutenant drink too much.  He had some difficulty, as Cassio knew that wine soon went to his head, but servants brought wine into the room where Cassio was, and Iago sang a drinking song, and so Cassio lifted a glass too often to the health of the general.\\n\\nWhen Cassio was inclined to be quarrelsome, Iago told Roderigo to say something unpleasant to him.  Cassio cudgeled Roderigo, who ran into the presence of Montano, the ex-governor.  Montano civilly interceded for Roderigo, but received so rude an answer from Cassio that he said, \\\"Come, come, you're drunk!\\\"  Cassio then wounded him, and Iago sent Roderigo out to scare the town with a cry of mutiny.\\n\\nThe uproar aroused Othello, who, on learning its cause, said, \\\"Cassio, I love thee, but never more be officer of mine.\\\"\\n\\nOn Cassio and Iago being alone together, the disgraced man moaned about his reputation.  Iago said reputation and humbug were the same thing.  \\\"O God,\\\" exclaimed Cassio, without heeding him, \\\"that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains!\\\"\\n\\nIago advised him to beg Desdemona to ask Othello to pardon him. Cassio was pleased with the advice, and next morning made his request to Desdemona in the garden of the castle.  She was kindness itself, and said, \\\"Be merry, Cassio, for I would rather die than forsake your cause.\\\"\\n\\nCassio at that moment saw Othello advancing with Iago, and retired hurriedly.\\n\\nIago said, \\\"I don't like that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What did you say?\\\" asked Othello, who felt that he had meant something unpleasant, but Iago pretended he had said nothing. \\\"Was not that Cassio who went from my wife?\\\" asked Othello, and Iago, who knew that it was Cassio and why it was Cassio, said, \\\"I cannot think it was Cassio who stole away in that guilty manner.\\\"\\n\\nDesdemona told Othello that it was grief and humility which made Cassio retreat at his approach.  She reminded him how Cassio had taken his part when she was still heart-free, and found fault with her Moorish lover.  Othello was melted, and said, \\\"I will deny thee nothing,\\\" but Desdemona told him that what she asked was as much for his good as dining.\\n\\nDesdemona left the garden, and Iago asked if it was really true that Cassio had known Desdemona before her marriage.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Othello.\\n\\n\\\"Indeed,\\\" said Iago, as though something that had mystified him was now very clear.\\n\\n\\\"Is he not honest?\\\" demanded Othello, and Iago repeated the adjective inquiringly, as though he were afraid to say \\\"No.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you mean?\\\" insisted Othello.\\n\\nTo this Iago would only say the flat opposite of what he said to Cassio.  He had told Cassio that reputation was humbug.  To Othello he said, \\\"Who steals my purse steals trash, but he who filches from me my good name ruins me.\\\"\\n\\nAt this Othello almost leapt into the air, and Iago was so confident of his jealousy that he ventured to warn him against it.  Yes, it was no other than Iago who called jealousy \\\"the green-eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on.\\\"\\n\\nIago having given jealousy one blow, proceeded to feed it with the remark that Desdemona deceived her father when she eloped with Othello.  \\\"If she deceived him, why not you?\\\" was his meaning.\\n\\nPresently Desdemona re-entered to tell Othello that dinner was ready.  She saw that he was ill at ease.  He explained it by a pain in his forehead.  Desdemona then produced a handkerchief, which Othello had given her.  A prophetess, two hundred years old, had made this handkerchief from the silk of sacred silkworms, dyed it in a liquid prepared from the hearts of maidens, and embroidered it with strawberries.  Gentle Desdemona thought of it simply as a cool, soft thing for a throbbing brow; she knew of no spell upon it that would work destruction for her who lost it.  \\\"Let me tie it round your head,\\\" she said to Othello; \\\"you will be well in an hour.\\\"  But Othello pettishly said it was too small, and let it fall.  Desdemona and he then went indoors to dinner, and Emilia picked up the handkerchief which Iago had often asked her to steal.\\n\\nShe was looking at it when Iago came in.  After a few words about it he snatched it from her, and bade her leave him.\\n\\nIn the garden he was joined by Othello, who seemed hungry for the worst lies he could offer.  He therefore told Othello that he had seen Cassio wipe his mouth with a handkerchief, which, because it was spotted with strawberries, he guessed to be one that Othello had given his wife.\\n\\nThe unhappy Moor went mad with fury, and Iago bade the heavens witness that he devoted his hand and heart and brain to Othello's service.  \\\"I accept your love,\\\" said Othello.  \\\"Within three days let me hear that Cassio is dead.\\\"\\n\\nIago's next step was to leave Desdemona's handkerchief in Cassio's room.  Cassio saw it, and knew it was not his, but he liked the strawberry pattern on it, and he gave it to his sweetheart Bianca and asked her to copy it for him.\\n\\nIago's next move was to induce Othello, who had been bullying Desdemona about the handkerchief, to play the eavesdropper to a conversation between Cassio and himself.  His intention was to talk about Cassio's sweetheart, and allow Othello to suppose that the lady spoken of was Desdemona.\\n\\n\\\"How are you, lieutenant?\\\" asked Iago when Cassio appeared.\\n\\n\\\"The worse for being called what I am not,\\\" replied Cassio, gloomily.\\n\\n\\\"Keep on reminding Desdemona, and you'll soon be restored,\\\" said Iago, adding, in a tone too low for Othello to hear, \\\"If Bianca could set the matter right, how quickly it would mend!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Alas! poor rogue,\\\" said Cassio, \\\"I really think she loves me,\\\" and like the talkative coxcomb he was, Cassio was led on to boast of Bianca's fondness for him, while Othello imagined, with choked rage, that he prattled of Desdemona, and thought, \\\"I see your nose, Cassio, but not the dog I shall throw it to.\\\"\\n\\nOthello was still spying when Bianca entered, boiling over with the idea that Cassio, whom she considered her property, had asked her to copy the embroidery on the handkerchief of a new sweetheart. She tossed him the handkerchief with scornful words, and Cassio departed with her.\\n\\nOthello had seen Bianca, who was in station lower, in beauty and speech inferior far, to Desdemona and he began in spite of himself to praise his wife to the villain before him.  He praised her skill with the needle, her voice that could \\\"sing the savageness out of a bear,\\\" her wit, her sweetness, the fairness of her skin. Every time he praised her Iago said something that made him remember his anger and utter it foully, and yet he must needs praise her, and say, \\\"The pity of it, Iago!  O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!\\\"\\n\\nThere was never in all Iago's villainy one moment of wavering.  If there had been he might have wavered then.\\n\\n\\\"Strangle her,\\\" he said; and \\\"Good, good!\\\" said his miserable dupe.\\n\\nThe pair were still talking murder when Desdemona appeared with a relative of Desdemona's father, called Lodovico, who bore a letter for Othello from the Duke of Venice.  The letter recalled Othello from Cyprus, and gave the governorship to Cassio.\\n\\nLuckless Desdemona seized this unhappy moment to urge once more the suit of Cassio.\\n\\n\\\"Fire and brimstone!\\\" shouted Othello.\\n\\n\\\"It may be the letter agitates him,\\\" explained Lodovico to Desdemona, and he told her what it contained.\\n\\n\\\"I am glad,\\\" said Desdemona.  It was the first bitter speech that Othello's unkindness had wrung out of her.\\n\\n\\\"I am glad to see you lose your temper,\\\" said Othello.\\n\\n\\\"Why, sweet Othello?\\\" she asked, sarcastically; and Othello slapped her face.\\n\\nNow was the time for Desdemona to have saved her life by separation, but she knew not her peril--only that her love was wounded to the core.  \\\"I have not deserved this,\\\" she said, and the tears rolled slowly down her face.\\n\\nLodovico was shocked and disgusted.  \\\"My lord,\\\" he said, \\\"this would not be believed in Venice.  Make her amends;\\\" but, like a madman talking in his nightmare, Othello poured out his foul thought in ugly speech, and roared, \\\"Out of my sight!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will not stay to offend you,\\\" said his wife, but she lingered even in going, and only when he shouted \\\"Avaunt!\\\" did she leave her husband and his guests.\\n\\nOthello then invited Lodovico to supper, adding, \\\"You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.  Goats and monkeys!\\\"  Without waiting for a reply he left the company.\\n\\nDistinguished visitors detest being obliged to look on at family quarrels, and dislike being called either goats or monkeys, and Lodovico asked Iago for an explanation.\\n\\nTrue to himself, Iago, in a round-about way, said that Othello was worse than he seemed, and advised them to study his behavior and save him from the discomfort of answering any more questions.\\n\\nHe proceeded to tell Roderigo to murder Cassio.  Roderigo was out of tune with his friend.  He had given Iago quantities of jewels for Desdemona without effect; Desdemona had seen none of them, for Iago was a thief.\\n\\nIago smoothed him with a lie, and when Cassio was leaving Bianca's house, Roderigo wounded him, and was wounded in return.  Cassio shouted, and Lodovico and a friend came running up.  Cassio pointed out Roderigo as his assailant, and Iago, hoping to rid himself of an inconvenient friend, called him \\\"Villain!\\\" and stabbed him, but not to death.\\n\\nAt the Castle, Desdemona was in a sad mood.  She told Emilia that she must leave her; her husband wished it.  \\\"Dismiss me!\\\" exclaimed Emilia.  \\\"It was his bidding, said Desdemona; we must not displease him now.\\\"\\n\\nShe sang a song which a girl had sung whose lover had been base to her--a song of a maiden crying by that tree whose boughs droop as though it weeps, and she went to bed and slept.\\n\\nShe woke with her husband's wild eyes upon her.  \\\"Have you prayed to-night?\\\" he asked; and he told this blameless and sweet woman to ask God's pardon for any sin she might have on her conscience. \\\"I would not kill thy soul,\\\" he said.\\n\\nHe told her that Cassio had confessed, but she knew Cassio had nought to confess that concerned her.  She said that Cassio could not say anything that would damage her.  Othello said his mouth was stopped.\\n\\nThen Desdemona wept, but with violent words, in spite of all her pleading, Othello pressed upon her throat and mortally hurt her.\\n\\nThen with boding heart came Emilia, and besought entrance at the door, and Othello unlocked it, and a voice came from the bed saying, \\\"A guiltless death I die.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who did it?\\\" cried Emilia; and the voice said, \\\"Nobody--I myself. Farewell!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"'Twas I that killed her,\\\" said Othello.\\n\\nHe poured out his evidence by that sad bed to the people who came running in, Iago among them; but when he spoke of the handkerchief, Emilia told the truth.\\n\\nAnd Othello knew.  \\\"Are there no stones in heaven but thunderbolts?\\\" he exclaimed, and ran at Iago, who gave Emilia her death-blow and fled.\\n\\nBut they brought him back, and the death that came to him later on was a relief from torture.\\n\\nThey would have taken Othello back to Venice to try him there, but he escaped them on his sword.  \\\"A word or two before you go,\\\" he said to the Venetians in the chamber.  \\\"Speak of me as I was--no better, no worse.  Say I cast away the pearl of pearls, and wept with these hard eyes; and say that, when in Aleppo years ago I saw a Turk beating a Venetian, I took him by the throat and smote him thus.\\\"\\n\\nWith his own hand he stabbed himself to the heart; and ere he died his lips touched the face of Desdemona with despairing love.\\n\\nTHE TAMING OF THE SHREW\\n\\nThere lived in Padua a gentleman named Baptista, who had two fair daughters.  The eldest, Katharine, was so very cross and ill-tempered, and unmannerly, that no one ever dreamed of marrying her, while her sister, Bianca, was so sweet and pretty, and pleasant-spoken, that more than one suitor asked her father for her hand.  But Baptista said the elder daughter must marry first.\\n\\nSo Bianca's suitors decided among themselves to try and get some one to marry Katharine--and then the father could at least be got to listen to their suit for Bianca.\\n\\nA gentleman from Verona, named Petruchio, was the one they thought of, and, half in jest, they asked him if he would marry Katharine, the disagreeable scold.  Much to their surprise he said yes, that was just the sort of wife for him, and if Katharine were handsome and rich, he himself would undertake soon to make her good-tempered.\\n\\nPetruchio began by asking Baptista's permission to pay court to his gentle daughter Katharine--and Baptista was obliged to own that she was anything but gentle.  And just then her music master rushed in, complaining that the naughty girl had broken her lute over his head, because he told her she was not playing correctly.\\n\\n\\\"Never mind,\\\" said Petruchio, \\\"I love her better than ever, and long to have some chat with her.\\\"\\n\\nWhen Katharine came, he said, \\\"Good-morrow, Kate--for that, I hear, is your name.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You've only heard half,\\\" said Katharine, rudely.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no,\\\" said Petruchio, \\\"they call you plain Kate, and bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the shrew, and so, hearing your mildness praised in every town, and your beauty too, I ask you for my wife.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your wife!\\\" cried Kate.  \\\"Never!\\\"  She said some extremely disagreeable things to him, and, I am sorry to say, ended by boxing his ears.\\n\\n\\\"If you do that again, I'll cuff you,\\\" he said quietly; and still protested, with many compliments, that he would marry none but her.\\n\\nWhen Baptista came back, he asked at once--\\n\\n\\\"How speed you with my daughter?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How should I speed but well,\\\" replied Petruchio--\\\"how, but well?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How now, daughter Katharine?\\\" the father went on.\\n\\n\\\"I don't think,\\\" said Katharine, angrily, \\\"you are acting a father's part in wishing me to marry this mad-cap ruffian.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah!\\\" said Petruchio, \\\"you and all the world would talk amiss of her.  You should see how kind she is to me when we are alone.  In short, I will go off to Venice to buy fine things for our wedding--for--kiss me, Kate! we will be married on Sunday.\\\"\\n\\nWith that, Katharine flounced out of the room by one door in a violent temper, and he, laughing, went out by the other.  But whether she fell in love with Petruchio, or whether she was only glad to meet a man who was not afraid of her, or whether she was flattered that, in spite of her rough words and spiteful usage, he still desired her for his wife--she did indeed marry him on Sunday, as he had sworn she should.\\n\\nTo vex and humble Katharine's naughty, proud spirit, he was late at the wedding, and when he came, came wearing such shabby clothes that she was ashamed to be seen with him.  His servant was dressed in the same shabby way, and the horses they rode were the sport of everyone they passed.\\n\\nAnd, after the marriage, when should have been the wedding breakfast, Petruchio carried his wife away, not allowing her to eat or drink--saying that she was his now, and he could do as he liked with her.\\n\\nAnd his manner was so violent, and he behaved all through his wedding in so mad and dreadful a manner, that Katharine trembled and went with him.  He mounted her on a stumbling, lean, old horse, and they journeyed by rough muddy ways to Petruchio's house, he scolding and snarling all the way.\\n\\nShe was terribly tired when she reached her new home, but Petruchio was determined that she should neither eat nor sleep that night, for he had made up his mind to teach his bad-tempered wife a lesson she would never forget.\\n\\nSo he welcomed her kindly to his house, but when supper was served he found fault with everything--the meat was burnt, he said, and ill-served, and he loved her far too much to let her eat anything but the best.  At last Katharine, tired out with her journey, went supperless to bed.  Then her husband, still telling her how he loved her, and how anxious he was that she should sleep well, pulled her bed to pieces, throwing the pillows and bedclothes on the floor, so that she could not go to bed at all, and still kept growling and scolding at the servants so that Kate might see how unbeautiful a thing ill-temper was.\\n\\nThe next day, too, Katharine's food was all found fault with, and caught away before she could touch a mouthful, and she was sick and giddy for want of sleep.  Then she said to one of the servants--\\n\\n\\\"I pray thee go and get me some repast.  I care not what.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What say you to a neat's foot?\\\" said the servant.\\n\\nKatharine said \\\"Yes,\\\" eagerly; but the servant, who was in his master's secret, said he feared it was not good for hasty-tempered people.  Would she like tripe?\\n\\n\\\"Bring it me,\\\" said Katharine.\\n\\n\\\"I don't think that is good for hasty-tempered people,\\\" said the servant.  \\\"What do you say to a dish of beef and mustard?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I love it,\\\" said Kate.\\n\\n\\\"But mustard is too hot.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, then, the beef, and let the mustard go,\\\" cried Katharine, who was getting hungrier and hungrier.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said the servant, \\\"you must have the mustard, or you get no beef from me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then,\\\" cried Katharine, losing patience, \\\"let it be both, or one, or anything thou wilt.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, then,\\\" said the servant, \\\"the mustard without the beef!\\\"\\n\\nThen Katharine saw he was making fun of her, and boxed his ears.\\n\\nJust then Petruchio brought her some food--but she had scarcely begun to satisfy her hunger, before he called for the tailor to bring her new clothes, and the table was cleared, leaving her still hungry.  Katharine was pleased with the pretty new dress and cap that the tailor had made for her, but Petruchio found fault with everything, flung the cap and gown on the floor vowing his dear wife should not wear any such foolish things.\\n\\n\\\"I will have them,\\\" cried Katharine.  \\\"All gentlewomen wear such caps as these--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"When you are gentle you shall have one too,\\\" he answered, \\\"and not till then.\\\"  When he had driven away the tailor with angry words--but privately asking his friend to see him paid--Petruchio said--\\n\\n\\\"Come, Kate, let's go to your father's, shabby as we are, for as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds, so honor peereth in the meanest habit.  It is about seven o'clock now.  We shall easily get there by dinner-time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's nearly two,\\\" said Kate, but civilly enough, for she had grown to see that she could not bully her husband, as she had done her father and her sister; \\\"it's nearly two, and it will be supper-time before we get there.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It shall be seven,\\\" said Petruchio, obstinately, \\\"before I start. Why, whatever I say or do, or think, you do nothing but contradict. I won't go to-day, and before I do go, it shall be what o'clock I say it is.\\\"\\n\\nAt last they started for her father's house.\\n\\n\\\"Look at the moon,\\\" said he.\\n\\n\\\"It's the sun,\\\" said Katharine, and indeed it was.\\n\\n\\\"I say it is the moon.  Contradicting again!  It shall be sun or moon, or whatever I choose, or I won't take you to your father's.\\\"\\n\\nThen Katharine gave in, once and for all.  \\\"What you will have it named,\\\" she said, \\\"it is, and so it shall be so for Katharine.\\\" And so it was, for from that moment Katharine felt that she had met her master, and never again showed her naughty tempers to him, or anyone else.\\n\\nSo they journeyed on to Baptista's house, and arriving there, they found all folks keeping Bianca's wedding feast, and that of another newly married couple, Hortensio and his wife.  They were made welcome, and sat down to the feast, and all was merry, save that Hortensio's wife, seeing Katharine subdued to her husband, thought she could safely say many disagreeable things, that in the old days, when Katharine was free and froward, she would not have dared to say.  But Katharine answered with such spirit and such moderation, that she turned the laugh against the new bride.\\n\\nAfter dinner, when the ladies had retired, Baptista joined in a laugh against Petruchio, saying \\\"Now in good sadness, son Petruchio, I fear you have got the veriest shrew of all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are wrong,\\\" said Petruchio, \\\"let me prove it to you.  Each of us shall send a message to his wife, desiring her to come to him, and the one whose wife comes most readily shall win a wager which we will agree on.\\\"\\n\\nThe others said yes readily enough, for each thought his own wife the most dutiful, and each thought he was quite sure to win the wager.\\n\\nThey proposed a wager of twenty crowns.\\n\\n\\\"Twenty crowns,\\\" said Petruchio, \\\"I'll venture so much on my hawk or hound, but twenty times as much upon my wife.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A hundred then,\\\" cried Lucentio, Bianca's husband.\\n\\n\\\"Content,\\\" cried the others.\\n\\nThen Lucentio sent a message to the fair Bianca bidding her to come to him.  And Baptista said he was certain his daughter would come. But the servant coming back, said--\\n\\n\\\"Sir, my mistress is busy, and she cannot come.\\\"'\\n\\n\\\"There's an answer for you,\\\" said Petruchio.\\n\\n\\\"You may think yourself fortunate if your wife does not send you a worse.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hope, better,\\\" Petruchio answered.  Then Hortensio said--\\n\\n\\\"Go and entreat my wife to come to me at once.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh--if you entreat her,\\\" said Petruchio.\\n\\n\\\"I am afraid,\\\" answered Hortensio, sharply, \\\"do what you can, yours will not be entreated.\\\"\\n\\nBut now the servant came in, and said--\\n\\n\\\"She says you are playing some jest, she will not come.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Better and better,\\\" cried Petruchio; \\\"now go to your mistress and say I command her to come to me.\\\"\\n\\nThey all began to laugh, saying they knew what her answer would be, and that she would not come.\\n\\nThen suddenly Baptista cried--\\n\\n\\\"Here comes Katharine!\\\"  And sure enough--there she was.\\n\\n\\\"What do you wish, sir?\\\" she asked her husband.\\n\\n\\\"Where are your sister and Hortensio's wife?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Talking by the parlor fire.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Fetch them here.\\\"\\n\\nWhen she was gone to fetch them, Lucentio said--\\n\\n\\\"Here is a wonder!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I wonder what it means,\\\" said Hortensio.\\n\\n\\\"It means peace,\\\" said Petruchio, \\\"and love, and quiet life.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Baptista, \\\"you have won the wager, and I will add another twenty thousand crowns to her dowry--another dowry for another daughter--for she is as changed as if she were someone else.\\\"\\n\\nSo Petruchio won his wager, and had in Katharine always a loving wife and true, and now he had broken her proud and angry spirit he loved her well, and there was nothing ever but love between those two.  And so they lived happy ever afterwards.\\n\\nMEASURE FOR MEASURE\\n\\nMore centuries ago than I care to say, the people of Vienna were governed too mildly.  The reason was that the reigning Duke Vicentio was excessively good-natured, and disliked to see offenders made unhappy.\\n\\nThe consequence was that the number of ill-behaved persons in Vienna was enough to make the Duke shake his head in sorrow when his chief secretary showed him it at the end of a list.  He decided, therefore, that wrongdoers must be punished.  But popularity was dear to him.  He knew that, if he were suddenly strict after being lax, he would cause people to call him a tyrant.  For this reason he told his Privy Council that he must go to Poland on important business of state.  \\\"I have chosen Angelo to rule in my absence,\\\" said he.\\n\\nNow this Angelo, although he appeared to be noble, was really a mean man.  He had promised to marry a girl called Mariana, and now would have nothing to say to her, because her dowry had been lost.  So poor Mariana lived forlornly, waiting every day for the footstep of her stingy lover, and loving him still.\\n\\nHaving appointed Angelo his deputy, the Duke went to a friar called Thomas and asked him for a friar's dress and instruction in the art of giving religious counsel, for he did not intend to go to Poland, but to stay at home and see how Angelo governed.\\n\\nAngelo had not been a day in office when he condemned to death a young man named Claudio for an act of rash selfishness which nowadays would only be punished by severe reproof.\\n\\nClaudio had a queer friend called Lucio, and Lucio saw a chance of freedom for Claudio if Claudio's beautiful sister Isabella would plead with Angelo.\\n\\nIsabella was at that time living in a nunnery.  Nobody had won her heart, and she thought she would like to become a sister, or nun.\\n\\nMeanwhile Claudio did not lack an advocate.\\n\\nAn ancient lord, Escalus, was for leniency.  \\\"Let us cut a little, but not kill,\\\" he said.  \\\"This gentleman had a most noble father.\\\"\\n\\nAngelo was unmoved.  \\\"If twelve men find me guilty, I ask no more mercy than is in the law.\\\"\\n\\nAngelo then ordered the Provost to see that Claudio was executed at nine the next morning.\\n\\nAfter the issue of this order Angelo was told that the sister of the condemned man desired to see him.\\n\\n\\\"Admit her,\\\" said Angelo.\\n\\nOn entering with Lucio, the beautiful girl said, \\\"I am a woeful suitor to your Honor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well?\\\" said Angelo.\\n\\nShe colored at his chill monosyllable and the ascending red increased the beauty of her face.  \\\"I have a brother who is condemned to die,\\\" she continued.  \\\"Condemn the fault, I pray you, and spare my brother.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Every fault,\\\" said Angelo, \\\"is condemned before it is committed. A fault cannot suffer.  Justice would be void if the committer of a fault went free.\\\"\\n\\nShe would have left the court if Lucio had not whispered to her, \\\"You are too cold; you could not speak more tamely if you wanted a pin.\\\"\\n\\nSo Isabella attacked Angelo again, and when he said, \\\"I will not pardon him,\\\" she was not discouraged, and when he said, \\\"He's sentenced; 'tis too late,\\\" she returned to the assult.  But all her fighting was with reasons, and with reasons she could not prevail over the Deputy.\\n\\nShe told him that nothing becomes power like mercy.  She told him that humanity receives and requires mercy from Heaven, that it was good to have gigantic strength, and had to use it like a giant. She told him that lightning rives the oak and spares the myrtle. She bade him look for fault in his own breast, and if he found one, to refrain from making it an argument against her brother's life.\\n\\nAngelo found a fault in his breast at that moment.  He loved Isabella's beauty, and was tempted to do for her beauty what he would not do for the love of man.\\n\\nHe appeared to relent, for he said, \\\"Come to me to-morrow before noon.\\\"\\n\\nShe had, at any rate, succeeded in prolonging her brother's life for a few hours.'\\n\\nIn her absence Angelo's conscience rebuked him for trifling with his judicial duty.\\n\\nWhen Isabella called on him the second time, he said, \\\"Your brother cannot live.\\\"\\n\\nIsabella was painfully astonished, but all she said was, \\\"Even so. Heaven keep your Honor.\\\"\\n\\nBut as she turned to go, Angelo felt that his duty and honor were slight in comparison with the loss of her.\\n\\n\\\"Give me your love,\\\" he said, \\\"and Claudio shall be freed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Before I would marry you, he should die if he had twenty heads to lay upon the block,\\\" said Isabella, for she saw then that he was not the just man he pretended to be.\\n\\nSo she went to her brother in prison, to inform him that he must die.  At first he was boastful, and promised to hug the darkness of death.  But when he clearly understood that his sister could buy his life by marrying Angelo, he felt his life more valuable than her happiness, and he exclaimed, \\\"Sweet sister, let me live.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"O faithless coward!  O dishonest wretch!\\\" she cried.\\n\\nAt this moment the Duke came forward, in the habit of a friar, to request some speech with Isabella.  He called himself Friar Lodowick.\\n\\nThe Duke then told her that Angelo was affianced to Mariana, whose love-story he related.  He then asked her to consider this plan. Let Mariana, in the dress of Isabella, go closely veiled to Angelo, and say, in a voice resembling Isabella's, that if Claudio were spared she would marry him.  Let her take the ring from Angelo's little finger, that it might be afterwards proved that his visitor was Mariana.\\n\\nIsabella had, of course, a great respect for friars, who are as nearly like nuns as men can be.  She agreed, therefore, to the Duke's plan.  They were to meet again at the moated grange, Mariana's house.\\n\\nIn the street the Duke saw Lucio, who, seeing a man dressed like a friar, called out, \\\"What news of the Duke, friar?\\\"  \\\"I have none,\\\" said the Duke.\",\"timestamp\":1640141473,\"title\":\"\\nAlcibiades knew his voice, and offered him help and money.  \"},\"digest\":\"NpjqxJc0rTD27WGSdSMKSClJ6T0dCuKCzn_ivKi57Ek\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6e15513EBD81b8159946378511dF1E78276e74F2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"aKtQbEuvI2KrrG2I7IhXOCZdBeAFto3x9FGDAxZ46O0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"T5a4E_3hqW-HWG45g1a2XX5ien7_o5iLwEjCmw4aZPE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"hfhjxMlgKAKgNNUgd4NgJCH8g0wDchdpCzkkgZZPEuFZPnD7hEcT41A7T8VDiT_DNOIeMOJ2mqQY8xqsY5yfGQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb9e6d275eda03bc38b1bf9f142ec4b1512b34f106977c3f29739b70130c3210271af2ce9f6973fd5475564b476a54589beacffffde330c6ddb22e8962e912f9f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"aKtQbEuvI2KrrG2I7IhXOCZdBeAFto3x9FGDAxZ46O0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"T5a4E_3hqW-HWG45g1a2XX5ien7_o5iLwEjCmw4aZPE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"NpjqxJc0rTD27WGSdSMKSClJ6T0dCuKCzn_ivKi57Ek\"}"
