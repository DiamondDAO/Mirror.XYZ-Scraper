"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"TL;DR #WAGMI\\n\\nTomorrow we are launching $DAMO. The first step in establishing a DeFi ecosystem designed to support the future of DAO-operated asset management. With the future of the economy shifting towards a digital era, HAI DAMO is positioning itself to offer a decentralized investment solution for as long as assets exist. If you are already in the crypto space, there is not much convincing to do on the digital economy shift. If you are new and need some convincing, well maybe we can start here.\\n\\nSince the inception of DeFi summer in 2020, the crypto asset class has seen tremendous growth in terms of adoption as well as the inflow of trillions of dollars. Many niche ideas have sprouted since, making crypto live up to its name of the unregulated wild west. From PFPs trading in the millions, meme coins being worth billions, ohm forks, and most recently DaaS, it has been quite the obstacle course of rug pulls for those trying to catch up on these crazy % they are hearing about. While many tend to block out the noise and are able to do proper due diligence, we cannot ignore the masses in which we drive true adoption to. As there has been quite the obstacle course for some, there has been a very large upside for many. The reasoning for this is the underlying technology in which makes a digital economy make sense. Aside from the crazy % gains, DeFi has offered users something the traditional finance system has not been able to. The ability to really put your idle assets to work.\\n\\n**Introducing HAI DAMO**\\n\\nWhile the the economy shifts towards a digital future, the less crypto savvy participants are going to need proper means to get involved. The current state of DeFi and most blockchain applications are not able to attain true mass adoption. There will remain technical hoops until the technology can truly catch up with the market. So where do we go from here?\\n\\nThe benefits of using blockchain technology are undeniable. While we shift towards a digital economy, applications with decentralized backend infrastructures will remain to grow in popularity. HAI DAMO recognizes the challenges ahead for true mass adoption and is shaping an ecosystem that sees fit to ideology.\\n\\nIn order to complete the most scalable and optimal solution for the short-term while positioning ourselves for long-term sustainability, it requires a community backed ecosystem. As the DAO will be voting on the composition of the decentralized investment vehicles, we also rely on the more crypto savvy users to mint and seed the secondary markets with DIVs.\\n\\n**What are DIVs and why?**\\n\\nDecentralized Investment Vehicles (DIVs) are tokenized derivative that tracks a basket of assets giving users diverse exposure to the top crypto assets. DIVs will allow users to gain exposure to top crypto assets in the few clicks of a button.\\n\\n***How are they made?***\\n\\nComposition\\n\\nThe DAO will initially launch $HAIBC or “Blue Chip”. The $HAIBC token is a tokenized derivative that tracks a basket of assets giving users exposure to the top “Blue Chip” crypto assets. Members of the DAO will be able to vote on the composition of the basket based upon the models displayed from our partner QAImera, an AI risk analytic and optimization tool. This prevents potential malicious proposals and protects the integrity of each basket. For ex: a meme coin like doge, will not be allowed in a Blue Chip basket.\\n\\n*Minting*\\n\\nThe protocol allows for users to mint decentralized investment vehicles by depositing collateral in user-controlled vaults. Collateral will be only approved erc-20s that are voted upon by the DAO based upon the metrics provided by QAImera and _______.\\n\\nWhile we set out to solve many of the issues that arise for newer users, we do not anticipate them to interact with our vaults directly. We aim to seed the secondary markets with deep liquidity in similar manner to DAI. We believe we can do so by establishing a DeFi ecosystem of aligned incentives that will be a strong backbone for seeding the secondary markets.\\n\\n**The Backbone**\\n\\nOn January 10th, the $DAMO token will offer an initial liquidity mining campaign for 30d to allow the community to bootstrap liquidity. (Blog coming later today) From there we will begin to roll out the platform in phases over the course of the next 4 months.\\n\\n*Phase 1* will begin with the launch of our staking platform. Staking will initially be designed to align incentives across the HAI DAMO ecosystem as well as establish a structure for a well balanced governance model.\\n\\n*Phase 2* will roll out capitalization for liquidity providers. At the end of our initial liquidity mining campaign, Liquidity Providers will have the option to remain providing liquidity or exchange their LP tokens to our treasury for discounted DAMO tokens.\\n\\n*Phase 3* will roll out our initial Blue Chip or $HAIBC token in which users will be able to provide collateral to mint $HAIBC. The $HAIBC token is a tokenized derivative that tracks a basket of assets giving users exposure to the top “Blue Chip” crypto assets.\\n\\nLet's build frens. $DAMO\",\"timestamp\":1641671661,\"title\":\"The Future of DAMO\"},\"digest\":\"c7O0NnoNHVocTO1yjqnb3ysVmace6oIpACfgIuPBjHU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x35d0e6fCf7Efd80f4fa978A4887cbFa30B201D19\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"lW5DRMjZWvRRFMnxj2oc2c1cuGNeC8I8nxPVRDB_cpA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"6hde8uhRugIPVHIhNbbTX25hJtrGtbVtQqwAIcjcrIc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"a7oc8oaf297Exujz9qrOxGg54f-0EvZJCPv52-8tNOWVuqxBWImgy3pjfvEvIF6DKcU6ECRLAayjQwiA5qm7PA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x51e3ce1803fb6b9dd1ac1a74cb1658f3c91bd0ad8b82fa390e3f46aaa17910775fc7e3a2316f0b38308031b035b2e2e7a5c8e326c24b87f1b4c9fa1290e16c4f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"lW5DRMjZWvRRFMnxj2oc2c1cuGNeC8I8nxPVRDB_cpA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"6hde8uhRugIPVHIhNbbTX25hJtrGtbVtQqwAIcjcrIc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"v-FJcDGWqM1eyPEi2_k4zo3sF0rPykp7LKLfLXZ5w-8\"}"
