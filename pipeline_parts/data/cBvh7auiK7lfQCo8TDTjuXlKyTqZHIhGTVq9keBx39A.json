He made the tools, toys, and weapons of the Pantheon. Once, he made inescapable traps for his mother, Hera, who disowned him, and his wife, Aphrodite, who he caught in bed with Ares. But he released them.\\n\\nFor someone who could build anything, his broken heart was beyond repair. His workshop was his home. The royal courts of the gods were avoided.\\n\\nFather of the machine, he built wonders such as golden mechanical assistants.
