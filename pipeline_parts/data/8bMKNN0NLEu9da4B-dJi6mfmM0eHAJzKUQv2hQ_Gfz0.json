Because of his strength, his slightly sharp nails were deeply pierced into his palms. In the middle, it brings a burst of pain in the heart...\\n\\n\\\"Xiao Yan, fighting power, three stages! Level: low level!\\\" A middle-aged man looked at the information displayed on the monument and announced it indifferently...\\n\\nAs soon as the middle-aged man talked, he unsurprisingly caused a mocking commotion in the crowded square.\\n\\n\\\"Three paragraphs? Hey, as expected, this \\\"genius\\\" has been standing still again this year!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hey, this rubbish really smashes the family's face.\\\"\\n\\\"If it weren't for the patriarch to be his father, this kind of waste would have been driven out of the family long ago, letting it fend for itself, and there would be no chance to stay in the family for nothing.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"Hey, how did the genius boy who was famous in Wutan City in the past become so downhearted?\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"Who knows, maybe you have done something wrong that caused the gods to anger...\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe disdain, ridicule and regret and sigh from the surroundings fell in the ears of the young man who stayed in place like a wooden stake, as if sharp thorns were pierced into the heart, causing the young boy to breathe slightly.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe young man slowly raised his head, revealing a somewhat delicate and immature face, and his dark eyes swept across the mocking peers around him. The self-deprecating at the corners of the young man's mouth seemed to become even more bitter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"Are these people so mean? Maybe it's because they had the most humble smile in front of them three years ago, so now you want to get it back...\\\" With a bitter smile, Xiao Yan turned lonely, quietly Back in the last row of the team, the lonely figure was a bit out of tune with the world around him.\\n\\\"Next, Xiao Mei!\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nListening to the voice of the tester, a young girl ran out of the crowd quickly. The girl had just appeared on the stage, and the discussion nearby was much quieter. A pair of slightly fiery eyes locked firmly on the girl's cheeks...\\n\\n\\n\\nThe girl's age is only about fourteen, although she is not stunning, but that childish little face contains a touch of charm, innocence and charm, and a collection of contradictions, which made her succeed in becoming the audience's attention. Focus…\\n\\n\\n\\nThe girl hurried forward, touching the dark magic stone stele with her familiarity, and then slowly closing her eyes...\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the girl closed her eyes for a while, the dark magic stone stele lit up again...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"Fighting Qi: Seven segments!\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"Xiao Mei, fighting spirit: Seventh stage! Level: Advanced!\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"Yeah!\\\" Listening to the results shouted by the tester, the girl smiled triumphantly on her cheeks...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"Tsk tsk, seven stages of fighting spirit, really amazing, according to this progress, I am afraid it only takes three years at most, she can become a real fighter...\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"It's worthy of being a seed-level figure in the family...\\\"\\nListening to the waves of envy from the crowd, the smile on the girl’s cheeks became a little bit more, vanity, this is the temptation that many girls can’t resist...\\n\\n\\n\\nSmiling and talking with a few sisters on weekdays, Xiao Mei's gaze suddenly passed through the surrounding crowd and stopped on the lonely figure outside the crowd...\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter frowning and thinking for a moment, Xiao Mei gave up the thought of the past. The two of them are no longer in the same class. Based on Xiao Yan's performance in recent years, when he grows up, he can only serve as lower-level members of the family. And she with excellent talents will become the strongest cultivated by the family, and her future can be said to be limitless.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"Oh...\\\" With a light sigh inexplicably, Xiao Mei suddenly saw the spirited young man three years ago. He was practicing Qi at the age of four, possessing nine stages of fighting energy at the age of ten, and breaking through ten stages of fighting energy at the age of eleven. Successfully condensed the cyclone of fighting and became the youngest fighter in the family in a hundred years!\\n\\n\\n\\nThe boy was self-confident and had inestimable potential. I don't know how many young girls were excited about him. Of course, this also includes the former Xiao Mei.\\nHowever, the path of genius seems to be always tortuous. Three years ago, this genius teenager who reached the peak of his prestige suddenly received the cruelest blow in his life. , Overnight, vanished, and the fighting energy in the body became less and less weird with the passage of time.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe direct result of the disappearance of the fighting spirit is to cause its strength to continue to retreat.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom the altar of genius, he fell overnight to the point where it was inferior to ordinary people. This kind of blow has left the young man in despair. The name of genius is gradually replaced by disdain and ridicule.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe higher you stand, the harder you fall. In this fall, you may never have a chance to get up again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"Next, Xiao Xun'er!\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the noisy crowd, the voice of the tester rang again.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith the sound of this somewhat elegant name, the crowd suddenly fell silent, and all eyes suddenly shifted.\\nAt the place where everyone's eyes converge, a young girl in a purple dress is standing elegantly, with a calm and tender face, and has not changed anything because of everyone's attention.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe girl’s cool and indifferent temperament is like the first bloom of a clear lotus. At a young age, she has already begun to have a refined temperament. It is unimaginable. If she grows up in the future, how the girl will be all over the country...\\n\\n\\n\\nIn terms of beauty and temperament, this purple skirt girl is undoubtedly better than the previous Xiao Mei, and it is no wonder that everyone present is acting like this.\\n\\n\\n\\nLianbu moved slightly, a girl named Xiao Xun'er walked to the magic stone tablet, her little hand stretched out, and the purple sleeves studded with black gold thread slipped down, revealing a white and delicate wrist, and then lightly touched the stone tablet...\\n\\n\\n\\nSlightly quiet, on the stone tablet, the dazzling light bloomed again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"Fighting Qi: Nine Duan! Level: Advanced!\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nLooking at the font on the stone tablet, there was a moment of silence in the field.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"...It's ninth dan, it's really scary! The first person in the younger generation in the family, I am afraid it must be Miss Xun'er.\\\" After the silence, the surrounding teenagers swallowed involuntarily, their eyes full of awe...\\n\\n\\n\\nFighting Qi is the only way for every combatant. Elementary Fighting Qi is divided into one to ten stages. When the fighting Qi in the body reaches ten stages, it can condense the fighting cyclone and become a respected fighting. By!\\nIn the crowd, Xiao Mei frowned and stared at the girl in the purple dress in front of the stone tablet, a touch of jealousy flashed on her cheek...\\n\\n\\n\\nLooking at the information on the stone tablet, the indifferent face of the middle-aged tester on the side showed a rare smile, and said to the girl in a slightly respectful voice: \\\"Miss Xun'er, after half a year, you should be able to gather a grudge. Xuan, if you succeed, then at the age of fourteen to become a real fighter, you are the second person in the Xiao family in a hundred years!\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nYes, the second person, the first person, is Xiao Yan who has lost his genius aura.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"Thank you.\\\" The girl nodded slightly, her flat face did not show joy due to his praise, she turned around quietly, and then slowly walked to the decadent young man at the end of the crowd under the fierce attention of everyone. before…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"Brother Xiao Yan.\\\" As she passed by the teenager, the girl paused, bending over respectfully towards Xiao Yan, her beautiful pretty face actually showed an elegant smile that made the girls around her jealous.\\n\\\"Am I still qualified to make you call that?\\\" Looking at the jewel in front of me that has grown into the most brilliant jewel in the family, Xiao Yan said bitterly. After she fell down, very few still maintained respect for herself. People.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"Brother Xiao Yan, you have said to Xun'er before that you need to be able to put it down before you can pick it up. It is easy to lift and release!\\\" Xiao Xun'er smiled and said softly, but his slightly tender voice was heart-warming. .\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"Haha, Freeman? I will only say, do you look at me now, like a freeman? And...this world doesn't belong to me at all.\\\" Xiao Yan smiled self-deprecatingly and said with a sense of excitement.\\n\\n\\n\\nFacing Xiao Yan's decadence, Xiao Xun'er's slender eyebrows wrinkled slightly, and said seriously: \\\"Brother Xiao Yan, although I don't know what is going on with you, Xun'er believes that you will stand up again. , Get back your glory and dignity...\\\" At this point, there was a slight pause, and the girl's fair and pretty face showed a faint blush for the first time: \\\"Brother Xiao Yan back then was indeed very attractive...\\\"\\n\\\"Haha...\\\" Faced with the girl's unconcealed frank words, the young man laughed awkwardly, but he didn't say anything. He is not a fan of a young man, but now he really does not have the qualifications and mood, and he has turned back lonely. Facing the outside of the square, walking slowly...\\n\\n\\n\\nStanding in place looking at the young boy’s lonely back, Xiao Xun'er hesitated for a while, and then, amidst the howling of jealous wolves behind him, quickly chased up and walked side by side with the young man...\\n```\",\"timestamp\":1639580771,\"title\":\"Fight to break the sky\"},\"digest\":\"cakx_OS7YA3-2MhOI7n0l8kWgBvLnJjMZnKkOp5vuYI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xCBCda62ad56791f9A3f8Ab16E0a45Ca376cf5C9c\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"5Xv4UOnOr5aFTh0xyjKD4L2PPGUcfF5_DBV9O_EwAOw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"UoDZkvm-BhF3EM91h7vX4HHaMVzEKlpziukmk817Iyk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"hBjBgDL9GzQbUEi84XiF3JU3GLy5J-EH6uQDRmYhSdnmECO9NWcfDp8KE7owQaAbJdVpOBBGpETi0w717MPf-g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb9c93b416038936af30b67fab4b047829908f259d558d2e6feee66a51b122b434dcb6f8555951d2e5429a59b4b4640df895c69e4545f2a84ae9d6190bd49f00c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"5Xv4UOnOr5aFTh0xyjKD4L2PPGUcfF5_DBV9O_EwAOw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"UoDZkvm-BhF3EM91h7vX4HHaMVzEKlpziukmk817Iyk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Rt3gPjWSUuqtvzT8iEI-3Ull6avaen16YpoXW-IAS8k\"}"
