The overuse of the spread increase demand and production proving the perfect foil for money laundering endeavours.\\\\\\n“It seems obvious now, but for the longest time we couldn’t figure out why deli workers would willingly place the equivalent weight of a small car in butter on a roll, it was madness but it makes sense now – they were fearing for their lives and directed by Russian mobsters,” shared one money laundering expert.\\n\\nThe Celtic Tiger proved to be the perfect storm as breakfast roll demand as well as prices increased twenty-fold and made it the laundering scheme an unheralded success for gangs.\\n\\nHowever, gangs exited the market with the advent of other dark web based methods for money laundering with crypto currencies most recently proving an excellent way to launder money. However, the infuriating practice of loading butter onto rolls remain.\\n\\n“Despite the absence of violent threats the method sort of became hardwired in the brains of deli workers, it’s not something that is easy to reverse even with coaching and therapy, it has a lingering presence – it would be like trying to get an attack dog to unlearn mauling the postman,” added an expert.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1642158568,\"title\":\"The Reason Deli Workers Spread Too Much Butter On Breadrolls — Hive\"},\"digest\":\"FRcjZYR8fa1PLuU8ttx1J8Ar1JDhGIi9HhqIMHM3u3M\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x47B440b41CEEa0Ad93080C04e8dd15476cd06ECa\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7GNJaZ43QrLqLcs6MuhwIy9jBxxYvWgGysM-WIYLcss\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Cu2aWFbK2gVKtePCpgIiXTFLYOcwPAv7-ZxE2tUHv6M\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"yP4mLtM7Y-IjyzJHWt4f6vDZsKloU5gXmSzysDf3Nptpx7mlxG2QkH0WG-ZsfTmdJv93UXMkr6TuttVQGR-Tww\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x7370e8416c0957a074b89f3fcccebcce1087edf00b076124fdba6a820cdb22033cb8c9524ff21a68d53083760f2b8c48815dd464cb7af4995ddde19b1f63c4c01c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7GNJaZ43QrLqLcs6MuhwIy9jBxxYvWgGysM-WIYLcss\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Cu2aWFbK2gVKtePCpgIiXTFLYOcwPAv7-ZxE2tUHv6M\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"FRcjZYR8fa1PLuU8ttx1J8Ar1JDhGIi9HhqIMHM3u3M\"}"
