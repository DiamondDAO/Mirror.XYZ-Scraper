In fact, perhaps *too many* things have happened this year.\\n\\nAs we all start to live more of our lives online, and embrace the idea of this shared ethereal space and time, it’s increasingly clear that it’s simply impossible to keep up with everything going on. This probably shouldn’t be a surprise, after all the last time anyone was able to [read every book](https://what-if.xkcd.com/76/) was prior to the invention of the printing press.\\n\\nThe key (and clearly only) difference I see between now and the 1400s is there was no real pressure to know everything (often much of anything). Distinct fields of study had their distinct subcultures, and although there was some intersection, information was largely siloed (which of course, had many problems in and of itself). Arguably though, over the last century and moreso the last decade the increase in pressure within specific groups (subcultures, fandoms, or otherwise) to have complete information (at least from my incomplete information) has been exponential.\\n\\nMore than any other reason, the combined global/local (glocal?) nature of how we live online has made this so. On the one hand, we now have a global community filled with shared memes and loosely tied values; on the other we have hyperlocal, squad-driven neighborhoods (and sometimes those neighborhoods have a local [Olive Garden](https://twitter.com/sadlyoddisfying/status/1473835146776391686)).\\n\\nThese overlapping groups with their own shared [lore](https://otherinter.net/research/lore/), [language](https://twitter.com/_kinjalbshah/status/1472954415850078215), and liminal sense of [belonging](https://www.othersidepod.xyz/episode/11) become lattices of mutual support, but simultaneously pull our attention in so many directions that it becomes easy to find people losing their sense of self and becoming the punctuation in a much larger story (what some call the [algorithmized version of self](https://twitter.com/boop/status/1415208337226928129)). Somewhere in the metaverse right now there are purity-testing knock-off yield farm reply guys, overzealous Harry Potter fanfiction moderators, and more.\\n\\nAs much as we might want to escape it, or alternatively as much as we often forget it, our memory and attention is the defining factor of our time, and it’s compounded by just how many overlapping spheres of study and interest there are in front of us, by how tightly they’re all interconnected / interwoven, and by cultural factors that constantly urge us (or urge others to urge us) to pay attention.\\n\\nIn web3 where economies are attached to these groups (and so to culture) there are exponentially greater opportunities to author our collective future, but potentially also greater risks when it comes to how we collectively managing this problem. [“NGMI” culture](https://twitter.com/richerd/status/1457585366790119429) for example creates a strong incentive to be able to signal yourself as part of the in-group, and to constantly stay vigilant for new opportunities. Similarly, [\\\"looks rare” commentary](https://twitter.com/muratpak/status/1437455167398498304) encourages chasing and uncovering scarcity.\\n\\nPerhaps it’s no surprise then that in light of this we see so many returning to thinkers, like [Illich](https://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/bitstream/handle/10535/5962/Silence%252520is%252520a%252520Commons.html?sequence=1&isAllowed=y), who urge us back to intentionality. Without this focus, it’s too easy for us to get caught up, and lose the ability to carefully reflect. And, without reflection, we cannot see ourselves.\\n\\nIn Shadow Work (1981) Illich writes: “The identification of that which is desirable with that which is scarce has deeply shaped our thinking, our feeling, our perception of reality itself.” In almost every case, chasing scarcity in turn creates a scarcity of attention. But as with all means, attention is only scarce in relation to the infinite ends we apply it to.\\n\\nThese infinite ends, as [Polanyi](https://inctpped.ie.ufrj.br/spiderweb/pdf_4/Great_Transformation.pdf) argues in The Great Transformation (1944), largely come from the emergence of modern *market societies* in which we increasingly detach means from their specific contexts, while simultaneously closing the distance between the economic and the [vernacular](http://www.davidtinapple.com/illich/1980_vernacular_values.html). As with above, there are ways web3 can help and hurt this problem too. On the one hand, just as before NGMI culture is almost certainly related to the economic incentives around being in the “in-group”. On the other hand (and this is, I think, novel) by giving hyperlocal groups control over the ways in which the economic and vernacular become one in the same it’s possible for them to in turn reclaim their attention from other areas that were previously dominating their lives.\\n\\nBut a failure to focus our attention doesn’t only create risks around our own sense of self, or how we author our collective future. In [Hair and the History of the City](http://backpalm.blogspot.com/2011/09/lice-hair-and-city-space.html) (not to be confused with the popular early 2000s show), Illich notes:\\n\\n`A typical tree on the commons of a village has by custom very different uses for different people. The widows may take the dry branches for burning. The children may collect the twigs, and the pastor gets the flowers when it flowers, and the nuts from it are assigned to the village poor, and the shadow may be for the shepherds who come through, except on Sundays, when the Council is held in the shadow of the tree.`\\n\\nMuch like market societies collapsed our experiences of and the ways in which we appreciate a tree, when our attention is scattered, it can be easy to think of communities as at best fungible objects within their own dark forests, or at worst as disconnected resources that can be leveraged to achieve ends totally unrelated to their local environment. I think beyond the risks that can be articulated around doing this, it’s something we largely understand to be *bad* at a visceral, more ineffable level. It’s out of scope, but perhaps there’s a similar reason we find *language* (in web3 or otherwise) so cringeworthy outside its hyperlocal context ([gm](https://twitter.com/sequoia/status/1468609078624620552) to the [pepsiverse](https://twitter.com/pepsi/status/1470836189238280194)). By better focusing our attention, we recapture the richness and beauty of the world around us.\\n\\nAll of this isn’t to say we should [shut down](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-16/solana-network-of-top-10-sol-token-applies-fixes-after-outage) the web3, as Box founder [Aaron Levie](https://twitter.com/jacksondame/status/1473823798575214596) or [Kara Swisher](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/16/opinion/web3-big-tech.html) might so obviously want to. Progress is incremental, and honestly movies like [Office Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space) are great time capsules (out of many) of the kind of banal evil that existed in early internet office culture and our expectations of/for society at large. I think most would agree we’ve come a long way since the idea of watercoolers or hip open workspaces as forms of collective expression or the notion that a 10% bonus is an effective form of validation. But the meta point (reflection?) we should recognize is that even with all of the freedoms these new models afford us, fundamentally every economy is an attention economy.\\n\\nAnyway, the holidays are upon us and so this note has to end, but here’s the tl;dr:\\n\\nWe should think carefully about how we navigate our creation of new economic models, and in what circumstances we tie our search for belonging to a kind of economic value that sustains our physical selves. DAOs or other internet-native communities that allow us to think about these questions, through periods of [radical rest](https://twitter.com/sourcecred/status/1470600403293253641) are leading the way here.\\n\\nIn 2022, I hope we can have more of these conversations (often associated with the [liberal arts](https://twitter.com/0xJim/status/1473712438667198464)), whether in new forms, or through emerging programs like [KERNEL](https://twitter.com/kernel0x), [Crypto, Culture, and Society](https://twitter.com/CryptoSocietyS1), or the [Public Library](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/GitcoinDAO-22431fe7c9794d99986a028c23ce56b5). In the interim, enjoy this time of rest and reflection.\",\"timestamp\":1641078610,\"title\":\"Attention and Intention in the Metaversal Age\",\"publication\":\"scott\"},\"digest\":\"IM_iSK-Z8raTyOE8JPeySjmCMmQmj8YhpsrdQ6wynBo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x48A63097E1Ac123b1f5A8bbfFafA4afa8192FaB0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qtosW3E_kfiSrJewypqbc9VN7pE3tSEHcjY6c-xyw_Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"oA5rn9oRxF93rpepEObhw3GbSchGZJaf3Ba6is8zxmg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"WpDOz68220yY5JsF-_H6gPOOOwxGqLemoGL80KsbT4cjcWpQQuNi52VieBxL92R9uiztmNxWP-AhD6YVbcSslw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x08f67a08999d2ddaca9afcb71648eb0c8684c846cea60b77a3deac81858fa810101f8c5993dfdc67cf528135523d88278f460ed0aa60b23c7843ffe504cad0801b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qtosW3E_kfiSrJewypqbc9VN7pE3tSEHcjY6c-xyw_Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"oA5rn9oRxF93rpepEObhw3GbSchGZJaf3Ba6is8zxmg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"U8aWHSX_HHHYcN1GvbTcBnZbAR7eNeJ_61WIOuSguF8\"}"
