To us, he was the expert”.\\n\\nMcCartney was only 21 and Lennon was 23 at this time.\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UzAdfjS0Zk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UzAdfjS0Zk)\\n\\n### Northern Songs Pre-IPO Equity\\n\\nThe equity of Northern Songs (Publisher’s Share of Music Publishing) was broken down as follows.\\n\\n![Northern Songs Pre-IPO Equity](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U84ysymsqSGbICFTpagGn.png?height=1000&width=1000)\\n\\n### Northern Songs Post-IPO Equity\\n\\nIn 1965, in an effort to reduce their tax burden, Northern Songs was floated on the London Stock Exchange.\\n\\nThe equity was broken down as indicated in the picture.\\n\\nThis time, Ringo Starr and George Harrison were each given **0.8%** each of the newly public company.\\n\\n![Northern Songs Post-IPO Equity](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HOHk7TFtLu686-84PF-0b.png?height=1000&width=1000)\\n\\n### George Harrison & Ringo Starr Were Cheated\\n\\nAs you might have suspected, George Harrison wasn’t a fan of this deal and felt he had been cheated of the copyright of his songs.\\n\\nAs you might have suspected, George Harrison wasn’t a fan of this deal. Here’s what he said, “It was at the point that I realized Dick James had conned me out of the copyrights for my own songs by offering to become my publisher.\\n\\nAs an 18- or 19-year-old kid, I thought, ‘Great, somebody’s gonna publish my songs!’ But he never said, ‘And incidentally, when you sign this document here, you’re assigning me the ownership of the songs,’ which is what it is. It was just a blatant theft. By the time I realized what had happened, when they were going public and making all this money out of this catalog, I wrote ‘Only A Northern Song’ as what we call a ‘piss-take,’ just to have a joke about it.”\\n\\n![George Harrison & Dick James](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dwxK9yJMYhzfMUxwt0Snf.jpeg?height=282&width=300)\\n\\n### Brian Epstein Passing Away\\n\\nIn 1967, Beatles manager Brian Epstein died of an accidental drug overdose. \\n\\nLennon-McCartney hoped to renegotiate a fairer deal but this caused tension between them and Northern Songs majority equity owner Dick James.\\n\\n![Brian Epstein](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5ugjYgIQb5PjYdysV1RvT.jpeg?height=366&width=500)\\n\\n### Associated Television (ATV)\\n\\nIn 1969, Dick James and his partners secretly sold their entire stake in Northern Songs to Lew Grade’s Associated Television (ATV) without informing Lennon-McCartney, owned by Associated Communications Corporation (ACC). \\n\\nATV also owned the copyright to 4,000 other songs.\\n\\n![Lew Grade](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6vDyIK9Bhr0sDSOtPE1BO.jpeg?height=378&width=468)\\n\\n### Northern Songs Equity - April 1969\\n\\nUpon hearing of the sale, Lennon-McCartney set out to regain control of the Northern Songs.\\n\\nThey also needed to convince a consortium of investors to sell them their shares and buy back NEMS Enterprises, their ex-managers company which contained shares in Northern Songs.\\n\\n![Northern Songs Equity - April 1969](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vKXbf-fx9v4gGrTho2mMv.png?height=1000&width=1000)\\n\\n### Investors Siding with ATV\\n\\nDuring one of the board meetings with the consortium of investors, Lennon remarked, “I'm sick to death of being fucked about by men in suits sitting on their fat arses in the City!” It’s safe to say this did not please the investors.\\n\\n![John Lennon](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FPQKnYb47dRlrtcPmu_FN.jpeg?height=383&width=680)\\n\\n### Northern Songs Equity - September 1969\\n\\nLew Grade from ATV approached Peter Donald, a major shareholder in the consortium with an offer of 40 shillings (£2) per share for the consortium’s 15% holding, which was accepted.\\n\\nThis resulted in Lew Grade’s ATV effectively owning 54% of Northern Songs.\\n\\n![Northern Songs Equity - September 1969](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/itM5YxMbb04Vn21oVV51K.png?height=1000&width=1000)\\n\\n### Northern Songs Equity - December 1969\\n\\nTo regain control over Northern Songs and go up against Lew Grade no longer made sense.

To Michael, it was just business.\\n\\n[https://youtu.be/VMr5bXdSsY8](https://youtu.be/VMr5bXdSsY8)\\n\\n### McCartney Asking Michael Jackson for a Raise\\n\\nMcCartney tried writing letters to Michael Jackson asking for a raise.
