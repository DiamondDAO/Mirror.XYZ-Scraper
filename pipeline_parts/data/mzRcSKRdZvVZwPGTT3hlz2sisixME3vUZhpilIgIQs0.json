Here’s how to do it within Mundo Lingo.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uJ_Vx4JmVOxwXBk1pwLiI.png?height=704&width=1478)\\n\\n## Internal Communication\\n\\n### Telegram\\n\\nInternal communication is via Telegram (not FB or any other platform). Telegram direct messages are responded quickly, under 24hs, anything over 2 days is kind of [rude](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/4brsyN2C8nGxW-8a8BTfpgOMpBKwr_Fp3MSPXBmtrKo).\\n\\n### Policy changes.\\n\\nIf the rules change, something breaks, or there’s an emergency, it will be announced on Telegram and/or in the community guides. It’s your responsibility to check these sources regularly.\\n\\n### Stonewalling\\n\\n`Stonewalling is avoiding, ignoring or being highly ambiguous in communication with someone in order to delay or prevent resolution of a problem.`\\n\\nIt’s [rude](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/4brsyN2C8nGxW-8a8BTfpgOMpBKwr_Fp3MSPXBmtrKo) to ignore someone’s question or answer in an indirect nature. For this reason, if you ask a direct question, you will receive a direct ‘to-the-point’ answer the first time you ask in order to save you time and stress. The same is expected of every member of this community.\\n\\n### Question the Community\\n\\nDirect your questions in this order:\\n\\n1. Google (if applicable)\\n2. The Guides (usually the EOM)\\n3. The [Scrums](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/63i6GPIBoYjId039yeEXMwNFTWVVL0Mjjj6WPrrJhDE)\\n\\n### Questions from Ambassadors or local city teams\\n\\nAll requests and inquiries from city teams are asked within the [Embassy](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/GUZj246f3hBt927EWv_XtirgExr-3Xm97nI8nak8BY0). If unable to get an adequate answer there, the Manager should relay the question in the next [Scrum](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/63i6GPIBoYjId039yeEXMwNFTWVVL0Mjjj6WPrrJhDE).\\n\\n## Email\\n\\nUse of Email is optional. However, official communications with venues or associates must be made via an @mundolingo.org Email address. \\\\*\\\\*Disputes between Managers and venues or other 3rd parties in which a personal Email is used will not receive any community support.\\\\*\\\\*There’s an account available for you to set up following [these instructions](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/C6xC0RpDtCoFOc6atGcC5dMtvfXBBLcnOe_xS3KyeFs)\\n\\n## Public Service Announcements\\n\\nTo suspend, move, change the time of, launch or cancel an event you can request a [Green-Light](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/4brsyN2C8nGxW-8a8BTfpgOMpBKwr_Fp3MSPXBmtrKo) from your Community Team no less than 10 days in advance. If you’re given the green light, you’ll be given a reminder list of where to announce the service disruption.\\n\\n### Monthly Review\\n\\nCommunications is one of the criteria in the monthly review. Your team and our participants or other members of the general public all deserve to be heard and responded to regardless of how “silly” or inconvenient their question may seem. For this reason, team members who repeatedly leave other team members or our public waiting without an answer are marked as a fail on the monthly review. Emails, Telegram messages or any other official medium that we use must be responded with 3 days.\",\"timestamp\":1640059516,\"title\":\"EOM | Communications\"},\"digest\":\"V54_oVt16vEgefv_tP4brs3q_iRKbjFJf-vYuimfp4w\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"34suyCfnLUoFM02SOhmJJJ9iXgiiL5kC6iPH6Fv3LXk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"jtVAiplEVAd0RPMj7L2P0umm9wTPdvk-kh1vAJTvwJc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"8AM6tRQx8mjpPOoyc3uHXjd6aXUQEVKrL84ZYNIP0gR3BoDmM8qbfv4yZ8OXf9LO0aV0BpY9pDpx79lI5fKxMA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x57d0f7cbea22222afabed23e09ac819f759269ea4cca2a83cdd992ddf3ffe88d22a7afd325b70c3c1ae7dee6f5fc8e22188ba69c589cf1f0528e258261121ae51b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"34suyCfnLUoFM02SOhmJJJ9iXgiiL5kC6iPH6Fv3LXk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"jtVAiplEVAd0RPMj7L2P0umm9wTPdvk-kh1vAJTvwJc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"QqxhcUkKracAP2iHqr0dOFiVCDuQiSiAVcEGSv_xD7E\"}"
