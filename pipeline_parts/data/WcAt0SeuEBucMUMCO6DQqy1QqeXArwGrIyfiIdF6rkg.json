"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"There are two grandparents living on the farm in the mountains. Every morning, grandpa gets up early and reads a scripture at the dinner table. Grandson also followed suit to imitate. One day, my grandson couldn't help asking, \\\"Grandpa, I tried to read this scripture like you, but I couldn't read it all, and I forgot all about the part I read when I closed the book. Do you think reading this is useful? \\\" Grandpa didn't answer his question. Instead, he turned and put coal into the stove from the basket containing coal. He told his grandson, \\\"Take this basket to the river and bring me a basket of water.\\\" The boy did as grandpa told him, but before he got home, the water leaked out of the basket. Grandpa smiled and said, \\\"You should go faster next time.\\\" Then, he asked his grandson to go back to the river and make a second attempt. The boy ran very fast this time, but the basket was empty again before he went home. Out of breath, he told grandpa that bamboo baskets can't beat water, and he wanted a bucket to fetch water. The old man said, \\\"I don't want a bucket of water, but a basket of water. You still haven't tried your best. \\\" This time he came to the door and supervised the boy to try again. It's not empty to draw water from a basket. Although he knows it is an impossible task, the boy still wants his grandfather to see that he has done his best. The boy dipped the basket deeply into the river, picked it up and ran home desperately. But when I ran to grandpa, there was still no water left in the basket. He gasped and said to the old man, \\\"Grandpa, look, it's no use at all!\\\" \\\"Do you think it's useless?\\\" The old man said, \\\"Look at this basket.\\\" Only then did the boy look at the basket doubtfully, and suddenly he realized that it was different from when he first got it in his hand-this is not the dirty basket with coal in it, it has become clean from the inside out. Grandpa just said to the boy, \\\"Son, you may not understand or remember what the scripture says, but when you read it, it changes subtly from the inside to the outside.\\\" There is nothing useless in the world, and it is not empty to draw water in a bamboo basket. \\\" \\n \",\"timestamp\":1642491851,\"title\":\"It is not empty to draw water from a basket.\\n\"},\"digest\":\"yWzl0IryALhZ1BRWx0TeQNmZoTwP2hhuMXY9q0erA_o\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x24b0340164049ABcd2B7c899D94E341aBfA2134d\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tKAy4Gp8cKQS8Py-pWSR2R35PMAHQGHL7d5DoXpelP0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"H4yF367ddIiiXfjZtpWxzT9ey4dFHr9_6_03z6lhdzc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"rVWyOnPNx_gHixqeSjhAh3Pbo7OiQ3EDMTXJgQXt1raCy6iXS6Ctf69Wig1WTPeMC6tOfrJIMDJf23W-s12DsA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x36b63bd4b3001e8b531d3ad57d6d2688535f4085c182afa8ceb3050245fb595a33f09dba1e2ab10b861bff2c7010df75bd6946e14d18dd02da42c570e76d870c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tKAy4Gp8cKQS8Py-pWSR2R35PMAHQGHL7d5DoXpelP0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"H4yF367ddIiiXfjZtpWxzT9ey4dFHr9_6_03z6lhdzc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"yWzl0IryALhZ1BRWx0TeQNmZoTwP2hhuMXY9q0erA_o\"}"
