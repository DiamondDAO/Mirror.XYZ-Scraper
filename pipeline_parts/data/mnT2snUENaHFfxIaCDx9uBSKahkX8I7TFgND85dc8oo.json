So stay tuned for a sweet and epic 2022.\\n\\nOh and don’t forget to follow us here for the latest news!\\n\\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/karameladao)  [Notion](https://karameladao.notion.site/karameladao/KaramelaDAO-Townhall-f3ecf03d27e246dea8c03f4d6aae3088)\\n\\n## Mission / Vision and other Ideas\\n\\nThis week during our community there was an interesting conversation around the mission and vision of the DAO. It’s very clear that there are lots of good ideas but not a concrete plan yet.\\n\\nFrom ideas around Web3 education and awareness to crazy moonshots like **buying an island in Greece**, this DAO is full of energy and ready to conquer the metaverse.\\n\\nWhat if we were able to educate the world and subsequently educate our way into a Greek island? Sounds crazy right?\\n\\nThis girl managed [to trade herself up from a 1c pin to a $80,000 house!](https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/tiktoker-traded-way-bobby-pin-dream-house-rcna8552) Dreams do come true sometimes!\\n\\nCrazy stories aside, it's becoming more and more clear that we need a strategy team that will help guide this DAO into finding and executing around its mission! Now we have an official proposal about it, so if you like the idea [go vote](https://snapshot.org/#/karameladao.eth/proposal/0xffca907693eef49e9ded372b07b47a0520cc0fd1237d1ebef79040944b0108bd)!\\n\\n## Governance / Citizenship / Logistics\\n\\nIt’s really so amazing to see how vibrant this community is! And also how fast it’s growing! More people join, more people participate in the community calls and more people vote every week! But most importantly, more talented people dedicate the time to help this DAO grow by contributing ideas about projects, helping with strategy, building the website and promoting the DAO all the time.\\n\\n## The website is HERE! \\n\\nThe website is the first successful KaramelaDAO project! \\n\\nFor this we need to thank @CryptoPablo who acted as the maestro and @lefteris who were the creative geniuses behind it!\\n\\nAlso huge thanks to @BigManDrewski for the branding and marketing guidelines!\\n\\nThe website was the first real project to demonstrate what a collective of people who don’t know each other, who are not even in the same country or time zone can do when they work methodically into achieving a goal! It's a true testament to the talent and dedication of this community.\\n\\n## KaramelaDAO’s new proposals are here!\\n\\nWe finally had our second proposal go through which resulted into a brand new discord server dedicated to the KaramelaDAO!
