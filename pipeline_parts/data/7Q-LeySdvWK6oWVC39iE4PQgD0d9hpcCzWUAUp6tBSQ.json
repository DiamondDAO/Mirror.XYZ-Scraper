"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*A DeFi wallet is a solution that provides users with complete ownership over their assets and is positioned as one of the safest storage methods available today.*\\n\\nAs an access point, a DeFi wallet provides users with a solution that leaves the power completely in the hands of their owner. This contrasts greatly with a traditional bank, which retains control of all of the userâ€™s assets in its holdings and requires user verification and other related information to do so.\\n\\nDeFi wallets eliminate the need for a third party, a concept that further revolutionizes the financial industry. Looking at DeFi wallets generally, most operate as [Web 3.0](https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-three-traits-of-web-3-0-that-fix-what-went-wrong-with-today-s-internet) wallets with compatibility on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain (although this may vary).\\n\\nOther similarities across these wallets include their compatibility with DeFi applications and their position as a key-based solution requiring users to retain responsibility for the safekeeping of their private key. DeFi wallets also operate with a non-custodial background, ensuring only the wallet owner has access to the funds.\\n\\nFor these reasons, DeFi wallets are among the safest solutions on the market. However, their security becomes a product of the user, who then may find themselves out of luck if they lose their login information.\",\"timestamp\":1639039369,\"title\":\"What is a DeFi wallet?\"},\"digest\":\"6K1Oz7s1JkyFxOwsISS5vxKhi3C21jH4RKgq6DN4GHg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xAF94eb5cE3d3380b509322aa9BAa5Dcef07eB44f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"gqh8y23G7pFR83PEGL7oYncFoe3MSPv2kkw0-rPnxgk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gi9F7oROXZckDT6SlL8hkB8mWMBPjZjJdd3noxuEIRw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"4crrMrvcCdTpcPmLVARMve7nrRX44FyXf-0Nlosnmi2Jpqpy7u3H1e9r63HmjIBQToBbC6QEMuSijDzVnv7FMQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa9a60a1790e78a95342e44b54c61600623232162e322f8b763db5916828b79e222e8a307f1081e6b1181749816ed2ea5f25690d17c5164ddc384ec38fef918081b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"gqh8y23G7pFR83PEGL7oYncFoe3MSPv2kkw0-rPnxgk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gi9F7oROXZckDT6SlL8hkB8mWMBPjZjJdd3noxuEIRw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"6K1Oz7s1JkyFxOwsISS5vxKhi3C21jH4RKgq6DN4GHg\"}"
