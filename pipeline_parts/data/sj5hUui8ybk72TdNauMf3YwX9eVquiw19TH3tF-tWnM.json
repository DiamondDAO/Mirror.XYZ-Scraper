Spectre DAO, a DAO in development\\n\\nFirst, Spectre will be launch on Fantom, more precisely on Opera, and their token will be the $GHAST. The main goal is, you have guessed, to become the reserve currency on FTM. Spectre has said it, it wants to demystify decentralised finance.\\n\\nLeads by King TuT, a renowned crytpo-dev, former developer of Giza DAO, this project wants to simplify DAO and DeFi. Yes we need clarity for the newcomers, and simplicity for beginners. But how Spectre will revolutionize the DAO leads by OHM ? Opera is maybe an answer.\\n\\n![Spectre DAO logo](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gnMYK_yfSD-PAN947QkC3.jpg?height=343&width=343)\\n\\n### But what's opera ?\\n\\nOpera is a secure and fast environment to build decentralized applications. It is fully permissionless and open-source. Powered by Fantom’s aBFT consensus algorithm, it leverages its speed and fast finality, and is ready for real-world applications with no risks of congestion or long confirmation times.\\nThe Fantom Opera mainnet is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and provides full smart contracts support through Solidity.\\n\\nWe designed Opera to overcome the limitations of older generations of blockchains, keeping the compatibility with Ethereum for seamless dApp porting.\\n\\n### The proof of stake on Opera\\n\\nUnlike traditional Proof-of-Stake systems, where some validators decide on the validity of the transactions, Opera is completely leaderless. In other words, the validators do not determine which blocks are valid.\\nRemoving leaders increases network security substantially.\\n\\nYou can stake on Opera with a minimum of 1 FTM.\\n\\nIf you have a strong technical background and at least 1,000,000 FTM, you can run a validator node.\\nRead how to become a validator.\\n\\n### And what about fast transaction\\n\\nOpera’s strong point is its fast time to finality, thanks to the underlying Lachesis aBFT consensus mechanism.\\n\\nPrevious consensus mechanisms such as Proof-of-Work, used by Bitcoin and Ethereum, are based on probabilistic finality and require a certain amount of time for transactions to be considered irreversible.\\n\\nBitcoin has an average time to finality of 60 minutes or six confirmations. Ethereum has a faster block time than Bitcoin, and its average time to finality is 6 minutes or 25 confirmations.\\n\\nOn Opera, a transaction is considered finalized and settled in 1 second.\\n\\n### EVM compatibility and Solidity compiler support\\n\\nBy being fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, developers can write, deploy, and run smart contracts as they would on Ethereum, but on top of a faster consensus mechanism.\\n\\nThe EVM currently used by Opera is the default go-ethereum VM implementation. It does not include the enhancements we have proposed in the paper “The Economics of Smart Contracts.”\\n\\n### A map not fully revealed\\n\\nWe have tried to contact administrators and core team, the roadmap is finished for Spectre but they havn't released any informations. So this part will be upgrade later.\\n\\n## 2. Phantom DAO, not another fork OHM\\n\\n![Phantom DAO logo](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DZCJKUG19xOaTlFFdrWbK.jpg?height=466&width=1400&&size=medium)\\n\\nPhantom is another fork OHM on DAO, more basic, but if something works, why should you change it ? That’s the mentality of Phantom, classic but solid.\\n\\nNevertheless, Phantom is more like a family, they have said it “ we are only using organic methods to grow our community. No influencers, no bots — nada.”. So Phantom wants to gather a community, at the beginning like a tiny family, but that proves what Phantom wants to achieve ; to become a true DAO given to its community.\\n\\n### About liquidity\\n\\nRisk Free Value (RFV) and Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) will function almost entirely as designed originally by Olympus. Phantom treasury will include more coins from the outset as proposed below:\\n\\n* \\n* FRAX — 60%\\n* DAI — 25%\\n* gOHM — 10%\\n* FTM — 5%\\n\\n![POL](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Phe7mjhaatiJ54bI5kiqq.png?height=387&width=430)\\n\\n### Have you said tokenomics ?\\n\\nDue to launching DAO-first, the initial supply and bootstrapping process will be different to most forks on Phantom. Here is the initial mix according to the Medium articles :\\n\\n* Early Contributors: 15%\\n* Investor: 5%\\n* Olympus: 3.33% — TBD, pending approval by Olympus and under the proviso that Olympus does not dispose of these tokens\\n* Community: 76.67%\\n\\n![Tokens distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/R22HsWJ3s2T0iPJxPdqKJ.png?height=437&width=512)\\n\\n### Let's talk about the contract\\n\\nIn Phantom, the Olympus smart contracts code will remain largely intact except for necessary edits needed for the code to function on the Fantom network and moving to **Solidity 0.8 and Open Zepplin 0.4**. Other than that, there will be minor edits required to allow for a 90/10 split between treasury and VC fund.\\n\\nPhantom will have a code audit performed prior to launch. It has been announced in their medium articles !\\n\\nNow let's see the smart-contracts built by the team. Phantom has built 3 important points in the contract, **first**, the Eternal Storage.\\n\\nGlobally, the storage of data has been separated away from the contracts that hold the protocol “logic” such that the logic contracts can be improved without disruption of service.\\n\\n**Secondly**, the Hexagon Layers.\\n\\nAt the core of the protocol is a set of generic contracts that will never need to change. This has three key advantages. First, the contracts that are of the highest value (think the treasury and the Accelerator) exist at the core of the protocol with very strict security checks to ensure there is no unintended access. Secondly, because the contracts at the core are generic, they likely never need to be upgraded. As things get more specific and less generic, they sit at the outer layers of the protocol and are implemented as a series of operations using the generic contracts from the core. This makes upgrades and improvements much easier to enact. Finally, small, modular contracts with a clearly understood purpose are easier to audit.\\n\\n**And last but not least**, Strict access checks.\\n\\nBecause the storage is separated into different contracts from the business logic, a system of strict access checks are easily added to that storage ensuring only authorized callers are allowed to access and modify that storage.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pb0NO6OjTsVpX62iZY-Mc.jpg?height=787&width=1400)\\n\\n### Partnerships\\n\\nPhantom like Spectre, has announced a partnership with Spirit Swap. This partnership will benefit the whole Fantom ecosystem, increasing TVL, volume and Phantom token holders’ returns. SpiritSwap will be creating a PHM-Stable (TBD) LP gauge where we will earn high APY rewards on our Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL).\\n\\nAbout PHM (Phantom) holders, the creation of a PHM-Stable (TBD) LP gauge on SpiritSwap will allow Phantom to farm much higher yields than traditionally possible on its POL. We are expecting APYs north of 60% with the ability to significantly increase these yields through governance voting once SpiritSwap completes its transition to on-chain governance of gauges “boosted farms”.\\n\\n### A link between Phantom and Concave ?\\n\\nPhantom seems to represent a lot of Concave’s ideas, a tight-knit community, which is not manipulated by bots, clarity and franchise on the part of developers, an enticing Roadmap.\\n\\nA partnership between Concave and Phantom seems unavoidable. It will serve bot Phantom and Concave, since both are qualitative, and built to last.\\n\\n**Spectre DAO Links:** \\n\\nMedium: <https://spectredao.medium.com/> \\n\\nTwitter: <https://twitter.com/SpectreDAO?t=PM3JpwnC320gt697ip9_kA&s=09>\\n\\nDiscord: <https://discord.gg/spectredao>\\n\\n**Phantom DAO Links:**\\n\\nWebsite: [www.phantomdao.com]()\\n\\nMedium: [https://medium.com/phantom-dao]()\\n\\nTwitter: <https://twitter.com/xPhantomDAO>\\n\\nDiscord: <https://discord.gg/ZAQX75htEb>\\n\\nCredits : Medium articles from Phantom and Spectre DAO, gitbook and twitter from both, Paul_DRX and Campina.\",\"timestamp\":1639520818,\"title\":\"Spectre and Phantom study for Concave\"},\"digest\":\"Trigu1DrQRHu3LluNiPLJbXG82rE_p3_8CRdyrEdYpU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x74E74B9e023382DdD5066d82682eF5E954ec15A2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"AYS3YHzJEdRAfR4YGZN24vhs9hvXMZbgCUcuviv3lmo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8YYzcu1rQDL29mQVvb4LyJZxlecPTFqd_Pv0swc7o5c\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Tt020MlG4I8FqM1hCbFVjJB8hD0137tF0xRYVYBFido-yzSqh3Frne0KxZ43VMqFNkHvXAbnitHzRAQRbdFwaw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc53d3ab5275c8a96bdd669e1e934e8cf7005c8f28211f94db612057612cdc08e2cd4aca179b2620f0236e52bc2f76680ea0c42fd9b620b131f22c3051ccbac011b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"AYS3YHzJEdRAfR4YGZN24vhs9hvXMZbgCUcuviv3lmo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8YYzcu1rQDL29mQVvb4LyJZxlecPTFqd_Pv0swc7o5c\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"LpYT11BoxHISzf7YPVRask1Z6UmrI0i8fPFoF5pkuRY\"}"
