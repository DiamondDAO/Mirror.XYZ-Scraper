"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Experiment OverviewÂ \\n\\nOn November 5th, we laid out the details of [our first experiment](https://mirror.xyz/0x3138165f8d21d4869dbD406CD8bc8055CAC8fb6E/t4G_DWaDeNyaBcmrTLBsDgfIhi6uJM4revXfw8plLus) towards building an effective bounty program: the question vault. Focused on OlympusDAO, this first experiment was aimed at collecting bounty questions from the community, and then voting on them. The most upvoted questions would then be turned into paid bounties for analysts to work on.\\n\\nUsers who submitted a question via the question vault received a POAP.Â \\n\\n# OutcomesÂ \\n\\n### Great TurnoutÂ ðŸ™Œ\\n\\nThe turnout was awesome. Over 40 questions were submitted for OlympusDAO and enough people voted that 11 top submissions were selected as bounties for the project.Â \\n\\n### ðŸ“š A Need for More Educational Material \\n\\nSeveral people said they didnâ€™t know enough about Olympus to engage with it. We recognize that itâ€™s hard to come up with analytics questions when you are still trying to grasp what the project is about.Â \\n\\nWith that in mind, we want to provide more educational content and training about the protocol that weâ€™re launching ahead of time.Â \\n\\n### Next Up: HarmonyÂ \\n\\nWe are currently generating questions for Harmony! Head over to [the question vault](https://bounty.metricsdao.xyz/bounty-programs/harmony) to submit your ideas for bounty questions.Â \\n\\nWhat educational material should we provide for Harmony? Weâ€™d love to hear your thoughts in [Discord](https://discord.gg/ND9gKWb8dx)! \\n\\n** \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n **\",\"timestamp\":1640278340,\"title\":\"Experiment #1: Outcomes and Next StepsÂ \"},\"digest\":\"IRz3HMVRt_Ra6DH_pFLwHso_iQ-m2e0G1_Js5ahJzj8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3138165f8d21d4869dbD406CD8bc8055CAC8fb6E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jAXBanRqUOkavnuZvTXYUuUcpCMf9fiQBWeRL2pMeeA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"pSQj5JQpiEcsaJ9oDGGHugNHlbhCBFn70_gMfo7LOdM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"VzPOAHuvYQEWPxyAGbg5k5lrH4wshYEWiXwsGqh4swrL1lBbhKho2W8PRkQ6iuWZhhEOJMl6w8DfLVRiR7N-6w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4259314b883736c34cdf351b3de9fc02f8736b484e1c30718a736f2119e91b67685349c189e28a9057eb8a0e6e273a17b94c5aa7ab59e53c1bfafc25f8618ba41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jAXBanRqUOkavnuZvTXYUuUcpCMf9fiQBWeRL2pMeeA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"pSQj5JQpiEcsaJ9oDGGHugNHlbhCBFn70_gMfo7LOdM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"IRz3HMVRt_Ra6DH_pFLwHso_iQ-m2e0G1_Js5ahJzj8\"}"
