"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"re-establishing the Small Arms Factory at Enfield.  The wonderful success of the needle gun in the war between Prussia and Denmark in 1848 occasioned some alarm amongst our military authorities as to the state of affairs at home.  The Duke of Wellington to the last proclaimed the sufficiency of \\\"Brown Bess\\\" as a weapon of offence and defence; but matters could no longer be deferred. The United States Government, though possessing only a very small standing army, had established at Springfield a small arms factory, where, by the use of machine tools specially designed to execute with the most unerring precision all the details of muskets and rifles, they were enabled to dispense with mere manual dexterity, and to produce arms to any amount.  It was finally determined to improve the musketry and rifle systems of the English army.  The Government resolved to introduce the American system, by which Arms might be produced much more perfectly, and at a great diminution of cost. It was under such circumstances that the Small Arms Committee was appointed.\\n\\nColonel Colt had brought to England some striking examples of the admirable machine tools used at Springfield, and he established a manufactory at Pimlico for the production of his well-known revolvers. The committee resolved to make a personal visit to the United States Factory at Springfield.  My own business engagements at home prevented me accompanying the members who were selected; but as my friend John Anderson (now Sir John), acted as their guide, the committee had in him a most able and effective helper.  He directed their attention to the most important and available details of that admirable establishment. The United States Government acted most liberally in allowing the committee to obtain every information on the subject; and the heads of the various departments, who were intelligent and zealous, rendered them every attention and civility.\\n\\nThe members of the mission returned home enthusiastically delighted with the results of their inquiry.The committee immediately proceeded with the entire re-modelling of the Small Arms Factory at Enfield. The workshops were equipped with a complete series of special machine tools, chiefly obtained from the Springfield factory. The United States Government also permitted several of their best and workman and superintendents to take service under the English Government. Such was the origin of the Enfield rifle.  The weapon came as near to absolute perfection as possible, It was perfect in action, durable and excellent in every respect even in it's conversion to the breechloader it is still one of the best weapons.  It is impossible to give too much praise to Sir John Anderson and Colonel Dixon for the untiring and intelligent zeal with which they carried out the plans, as well as for the numerous improvements which they introduced.  These have rendered the Enfield Small Arms Factory one of the most perfect and best regulated establishments in the kingdom.\\n\\nCHAPTER 20.  Retirement from Business.\\n\\nI had been for some time contemplating the possibility of retiring altogether from business.  I had got enough of the world's goods, and was willing to make way for younger men.  But I found it difficult to break loose from old associations.  Like the retired tallow-chandler, I might wish to go back \\\"on melting days.\\\"  I had some correspondence with my old friend David Roberts, Royal Academician, on the subject. He wrote to me on the 2d June 1853, and said:\\n\\n\\\"I rejoice to learn, from the healthy tone that breathes throughout your epistle, that you are as happy as every one who knows you wishes you to be, and as prosperous as you deserve.  Knowing, also, as I do, your feeling for art and all that tends to raise and dignify man, I most sincerely congratulate you on the prospect of your being able to retire, in the full vigour of manhood, to follow out that sublime pursuit, in comparison with which the painter's art is but a faint glimmering.  'The Landscape of other worlds' you alone have sketched for us, and enlightened us on that with which the ancient world but gazed upon and worshipped in the symbol of Astarte, Isis, and Diana. We are matter-of-fact now, and have outlived childhood.  What say you to a photograph of those wonderful drawings?  It may come to that.\\\"\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... It did indeed \\\"come to that,\\\" for I shortly after learned the art of photography, chiefly for this special purpose.  ...\\\\]\\n\\nBut I had something else yet to do in my special vocation. In 1854 I took out a patent for puddling iron by means of steam. Many of my readers may not know that cast-iron is converted into malleable iron by the process called puddling.  The iron, while in a molten state, is violently stirred and agitated by a stiff iron rod, having its end bent like a hoe or flattened hook, by which every portion of the molten metal is exposed to the oxygen of the air, and the supercharge of carbon which the cast iron contains is thus \\\"burnt out.\\\"  When this is effectually done the iron becomes malleable and weldable.\\n\\nThis state of the iron is indicated by a general loss of fluidity, accompanied by a tendency to gather together in globular masses. The puddler, by his dexterous use of the end of the rabbling bar, puts the masses together, and, in fact, welds the new-born particles of malleable iron into puddle-balls of about three-quarters of a hundredweight each.  These are successively removed from the pool of the puddling furnace, and subjected to the energetic blows of the steam hammer, which drives out all the scoriae lurking within the spongy puddle-balls, and thus welds them into compact masses of malleable iron. When reheated to a welding heat, they are rolled out into flat bars or round rods, in a variety of sizes, so as to be suitable for the consumer.\\n\\nThe manual and physical labour of the puddler is tedious, fatiguing, and unhealthy.  The process of puddling occupies about an hour's violent labour, and only robust young men can stand the fatigue and violent heat.  I had frequent opportunities of observing the labour and unhealthiness of the process, as well as the great loss of time required to bring it to a conclusion.  It occurred to me that much of this could be avoided by employing some other means for getting rid of the superfluous carbon, and bringing the molten cast-iron into a malleable condition.\\n\\nThe method that occurred to me was the substitution of a small steam pipe in the place of the puddler's rabbling bar.  By having the end of this steam pipe bent downwards so as to reach the bottom of the pool, and then to discharge a current of steam beneath the surface of the molten cast iron, I thought that I should by this simple means supply a most effective carbon-oxidating agent, at the same time that I produced a powerful agitating action within the pool.  Thus the steam would be decomposed and supply oxygen to the carbon of the cast-iron, while the mechanical action of the rush of steam upwards would cause so violent a commotion throughout the pool of melted iron as to exceed the utmost efforts of the labour of the puddler.  All the gases would pass up the chimney of the puddling furnace, and the puddler would not be subject to their influence.  Such was the method specified in my patent of l854\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... Specification of James Nasmyth--Employment of steam in the process of puddling iron.  May 4, 1854; No. 1001.  ...\\\\]\\n\\nMy friend, Thomas Lever Rushton, proprietor of the Bolton Ironworks, was so much impressed with the soundness of the principle, as well as with the great simplicity of carrying the invention into practical effect, that he urged me to secure the patent, and he soon after gave me the opportunity of trying the process at his works.  The results were most encouraging.  There was a great saving of labour and time compared with the old puddling process; and the malleable iron produced was found to be of the highest order as regarded strength, toughness, and purity.  My process was soon after adopted by several iron manufacturers with equally favourable results.  Such, however, was the energy of the steam, that unless the workmen were most careful to regulate its force and the duration of its action, the waste of iron by undue oxidation was such as in a great measure to neutralise its commercial gain as regarded the superior value of the malleable iron thus produced.\\n\\nBefore I had time or opportunity to remove this commercial difficulty, Mr. Bessemer had secured his patent of the l7th of October, 1855. By this patent he employed a blast of air to do the same work as I had proposed to accomplish by means of a blast of steam, forced up beneath the surface of the molten cast iron.  He added some other improvements, with that happy fertility of invention which has always characterised him.  The results were so magnificently successful as to totally eclipse my process, and to cast it comparatively into the shade. At the same time I may say that I was in a measure the pioneer of his invention, that I initiated a new system, and led to one of the most important improvements in the manufacture of iron and steel that has ever been given to the world.\\n\\nMr. Bessemer brought the subject of his invention before the meeting of the British Association at Cheltenham in the autumn of 1856.  There he read his paper \\\"On the Manufacture of Iron into Steel without Fuel.\\\"\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... On the morning of the day on which the paper was to be read, Mr. Bessemer was sitting at breakfast at his hotel, when an ironmaster (to whom he was unknown) said, laughing, to a friend within his hearing, \\\"Do you know that there is somebody come down from London to read us a paper on making steel from cast iron without fuel?  Did you ever hear of such nonsense?\\\" The title of the paper was perhaps a misnomer, but the correctness of the principles on which the pig iron was converted into malleable iron, as explained by the inventor, was generally recognised, and there seemed every reason to anticipate that the process would before long come into general use.  ...\\\\]\\n\\nI was present on the occasion, and listened  to his statement with mingled feelings of regret and enthusiasm--of regret, because I had been so clearly superseded and excelled in my performances; and of enthusiasm--because I could not but admire and honour the genius who had given so great an  invention to the mechanical world. I immediately took the opportunity of giving my assent to the principles which he had propounded.  My words were not reported at the time, nor was Mr. Bessemer's paper printed by the Association, perhaps because it was thought of so little importance but, on applying to Mr. (now Sir Henry) Bessemer, he was so kind as to give me the following as his recollection of the words which I used on the occasion.\\n\\n\\\"I shall ever feel grateful,\\\" says Sir Henry, \\\"for the noble way in which you spoke at the meeting at Cheltenham of my invention. If I remember rightly, you held up a piece of my malleable iron, saying words to this effect:  'Here is a true British nugget!  Here is a new process that promises to put an end to all puddling; and I may mention that at this moment there are puddling furnaces in successful operation where my patent hollow steam Rabbler is at work, producing iron of superior quality by the introduction of jets of steam in the puddling process.  I do not, however, lay any claim to this invention of Mr. Bessemer; but I may fairly be entitled to say that I have advanced along the road on which he has travelled so many miles, and has effected such unexpected results that I do not hesitate to say that I may go home from this meeting and tear up my patent, for my process of puddling is assuredly superseded.'\\\"\\n\\nAfter giving an account of the true origin of his process, in which he had met with failures as well as successes, but at last recognised the decarburation of pig iron by atmospheric air, Sir Henry proceeds to say:\\n\\n\\\"I prepared to try another experiment, in a crucible having no hole the the bottom, but which was provided with an iron pipe put through a hole in the cover, and passing down nearly to the bottom of the crucible. The small lumps and grains of iron were packed around fit, so as nearly to fill the crucible.  A blast of air was to be forced down the pipe so as to rise up among the pieces of granular iron and partially decarburise them.  The pipe could then be withdrawn, and the fire urged until the metal with its coat of oxyde was fused, and cast steel thereby produced.\\n\\n\\\"While the blowing apparatus for this experiment was being fitted up, I was taken with one of those short but painful illnesses to which I was subject at that time.  I was confined to my bed, and it was then that my mind, dwelling for hours together on the experiment about to be made, suggested that instead of trying to decarburise the granulated metal by forcing the air down the vertical pipe among the pieces of iron, the air would act much more energetically and more rapidly if I first melted the iron in the crucible, and forced the air down the pipe below the surface of the fluid metal, and thus burn out the carbon and silicum which it contained.\\n\\n\\\"This appeared so feasible, and in every way so great an improvement, that the experiment on the granular pieces was at once abandoned, and, as soon as I was well enough, I proceeded to try the experiment of forcing the air under the fluid metal.  The result was marvellous. Complete decarburation was effected in half an hour.  The heat produced was immense, but, unfortunately more than half the metal was blown out of the pot.  This led to the use of pots with large hollow perforated covers, which effectually prevented the loss of metal. These experiments continued from January to October 1855.  I have by me on the mantelpiece at this moment, a small piece of rolled bar iron which was rolled at Woolwich arsenal, and exhibited a year later at Cheltenham.\\n\\n\\\"I then applied for a patent, but before preparing my provisional specification (dated October 17, 1855), I searched for other patents to ascertain whether anything of the sort had been done before. I then found your patent for puddling with the steam rabble, and also Martin's patent for the use of steam in gutters while molten iron was being conveyed from the blast furnace to a finery, there to be refined in the ordinary way prior to puddling.\\n\\n\\\"I then tried steam in my cast steel process, alone, and also mixed with air.  I found that it cooled the metal very much, and of itself could not be used, as it always produced solidification. I was nevertheless advised to claim the use of steam as well as air in my particular process (lest it might be used against me), at the same time disclaiming its employment for any purpose except in the production of fluid malleable iron or steel.  And I have no doubt it is to this fact that I referred when speaking to you on the occasion you mention.  I have deemed it best that the exact truth--so far as a short history can give it--should be given at once to you, who are so true and candid.  Had it not been for you and Martin I should probably never have proposed the use of steam in my process, but the use of air came by degrees, just in the way I have described.\\\"\\n\\nIt was thoroughly consistent with Mr. Bessemer's kindly feelings towards me, that, after our meeting at Cheltenham, he made me an offer of one-third share of the value of his patent.  This would have been another fortune to me.  But I had already made money enough. I was just then taking down my signboard and leaving business. I did not need to plunge into any such tempting enterprise, and I therefore thankfully declined the offer.\\n\\nMany long years of pleasant toil and exertion had done their work. A full momentum of prosperity had been given to my engineering business at Patricroft.  My share in the financial results accumulated with accelerated rapidity to an amount far beyond my most sanguine hopes. But finding, from long continued and incessant mental efforts, that my nervous system was beginning to become shaken, especially in regard to an affection of the eyes, which in some respects damaged my sight, I thought the time had arrived for me to retire from commercial life.\\n\\nSome of my friends advised me to \\\"slack off,\\\" and not to retire entirely from Bridgewater Foundry.  But to do so was not in my nature. I could not be indifferent to any concern in which I was engaged. I must give my mind and heart to it as before.  I could not give half to leisure, and half to business.  I therefore concluded that a final decision was necessary.  Fortunately I possessed an abundant and various stock of hobbies.  I held all these in reserve to fall back upon.  They would furnish me with an almost inexhaustible source of healthy employment.  They might give me occupation for mind and body as long as I lived.  I bethought me of the lines of Burns:                                 \\\"Wi' steady aim some Fortune chase;  Keen hope does ev'ry sinew brace;  Thro' fair, thro' foul, they urge the race,  And seize the prey:  Then cannie, in some cosy place,  They close the day.\\\"\\n\\nIt was no doubt a great sorrow for me and my dear wife to leave the Home in which we had been so happy and prosperous for so many years. It was a cosy little cottage at Patricroft.  We had named it \\\"Fireside.\\\" It was small, but suitable for our requirements. We never needed to enlarge it, for we had no children to accommodate. It was within five minutes' walk of the Foundry, and I was scarcely ever out of reach of the Fireside, where we were both so happy. It had been sanctified by our united love for thirteen years. It was surrounded by a nice garden, planted with trees and shrubs. Though close to the Bridgewater Canal, and a busy manufacturing population was not far off, the cottage was perfectly quiet. It was in this garden, when I was arranging the telescope at night, that I had been detected by the passing boatman as \\\"The Patricroft Ghost\\\"\\n\\nWhen we were about to leave Patricroft, the Countess of Ellesmere, who, as well as the Earl, had always been our attached friends, wrote to my wife as follows:  \\\"I can well understand Mr. Nasmyth's satisfaction at the emancipation he looks forward to in December next. But I hope you do not expect us to share it! for what is so much natural pleasure to you is a sad loss and privation to us. I really don't know how we shall get on at Worsley without you. You have nevertheless my most sincere and hearty good wishes that the change may be as grateful to you both as anything in this world can be.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1639290720,\"title\":\"\\nIn 1853 I was appointed a member of the Small Arms Committee for the purpose of re-modelling and, \"},\"digest\":\"WRSu60yojdTh7gvZk0nHzUg7vRrITDiuZdBZR_OS4dg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa216D8906Acd104a8EC6a31f93e945DFe15768c1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1AzE5dQtflq3DjQDSrGWZHByI7xQ7nD0w6dkZ-JmsV0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"VOt4u_DAldiw8WgInueoWm89yxNRwwx1jNBJG5TYXng\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"etiwOciW4Yhr-SPyainecjIRdA2KrqN9H-mWUbruSS6nnRv4a19jP1qPWJDPs16snTn4P4p0Yioj-b5U5kBOEA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe8cdd3e99854c0a542b8bd9f60ca4dd94594f1dac5f5eea7d6b77867a6897c4156e9d1c502b2f2358d17a1152d62ae653a605260aedff847e8a5a174351e46581b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1AzE5dQtflq3DjQDSrGWZHByI7xQ7nD0w6dkZ-JmsV0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"VOt4u_DAldiw8WgInueoWm89yxNRwwx1jNBJG5TYXng\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"WRSu60yojdTh7gvZk0nHzUg7vRrITDiuZdBZR_OS4dg\"}"
