"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"Others may pretend to oblige people merely from motives of friendship,\\\" he remarked.  \\\"But I am more honest.  If I do anything in the way of business, I expect to be paid for it; and I vary my terms according to my clients' need.  It would be impossible to have a fixed price for services like mine.  When, on two different occasions, I saved a gentleman of your acquaintance from bankruptcy, I asked ten thousand francs the first time, and fifteen thousand the second.  Was that an exaggerated estimate of my services? I might boast with truth that I once assured the marriage of a brilliant viscount by keeping his creditors quiet while his courtship was in progress.  The day after the wedding he paid me twenty thousand francs.  Didn't he owe them to me? If, instead of being a trifle short of money, you happened to be ruined, I should not ask you merely for a thousand francs.  I should study your position, and fix my terms according to the magnitude of the peril from which I rescued you.\\\"\\n\\nThere was not a sentence, not a word of this cynical explanation which had not been carefully studied beforehand.  There was not an expression which was not a tempting bait to the marquis's evil instincts.  But M de Valorsay made no sign.  \\\"I see that you are a shrewd man, Monsieur Maumejan,\\\" said he, \\\"and if I am ever in difficulty I shall apply to you.\\\"\\n\\nPascal bowed with an air of assumed modesty; but he was inwardly jubilant, for he felt that his enemy would certainly fall into the trap which had been set for him.  \\\"And now, when shall I have this money?\\\" inquired the marquis.\\n\\n\\\"By four o'clock.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And I need fear no disappointment as in the baron's case?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certainly not.  What interest would M. Trigault have in lending you a hundred thousand francs? None whatever.  With me it is quite a different thing.  The profit I'm to realize is your security.  In business matters distrust your friends.  Apply to usurers rather than to them.  Question people who are in difficulties, and ninety-five out of a hundred will tell you that their worst troubles have been caused by those who called themselves their best friends.\\\"\\n\\nHe had risen to take leave, when the door of the smoking-room opened, and a servant appeared and said in an undertone: \\\"Madame Leon is in the drawing-room with Dr. Jodon.  They wish to see you, monsieur.\\\"\\n\\nThough Pascal had armed himself well against any unexpected mischance, he changed color on hearing the name of the worthy housekeeper.  \\\"All is lost if this creature sees and recognizes me!\\\" he thought.\\n\\nFortunately the Marquis was too much engrossed in his own affairs to note the momentary agitation of Baron Trigault's envoy.  \\\"It is strange that I can't have five minutes' peace and quietness,\\\" he said.  \\\"I told you that I was at home to no one.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Enough! Let the lady and gentleman wait.\\\"\\n\\nThe servant withdrew.\\n\\nThe thought of passing out through the drawing-room filled Pascal with consternation.  How could he hope to escape Madame Leon's keen eyes? Fortunately M. de Valorsay came to his relief, for as Pascal was about to open the same door by which he had entered, the marquis exclaimed: \\\"Not that way! Pass out here--this is the shortest way.\\\"\\n\\nAnd leading him through his bedroom the marquis conducted him to the staircase, where he even feigned to offer him his hand, saying: \\\"A speedy return, dear M. Maumejan.\\\"\\n\\nIt is not at the moment of peril that people endure the worst agony; it is afterward, when they have escaped it.  As he went down the staircase, Pascal wiped the cold sweat from his forehead.  \\\"Ah! it was a narrow escape!\\\" he exclaimed, under his breath.\\n\\nHe felt proud of the manner in which he had sustained a part so repugnant to his nature.  He was amazed to find that he could utter falsehoods with such a calm, unblushing face--he was astonished at his own audacity.  And what a success he had achieved! He felt certain that he had just slipped round M. de Valorsay's neck the noose which would strangle him later on.  Still he was considerably disturbed by Madame Leon's visit to the marquis.  \\\"What is she doing here with this physician?\\\" he asked himself again and again.  \\\"Who is this man? What new piece of infamy are they plotting to require his services?\\\" One of those presentiments which are prompted by the logic of events, told him that this physician had been, or would be, one of the actors in the vile conspiracy of which he and Mademoiselle Marguerite were the victims.  But he had no leisure to devote to the solution of this enigma.  Time was flying, and before returning to the marquis's house he must find out what had aroused the suspicions of the purchaser of those horses, the biographies of which had been so rigidly exacted.  Through the baron, he might hope to obtain an interview with Kami-Bey--and so it was to the baron's house that Pascal directed his steps.\\n\\nAfter the more than cordial reception which the baron had granted him that morning, it was quite natural that the servants should receive him as a friend of the household.  They would scarcely allow him to explain what he desired.  It was the pompous head valet in person who ushered him into one of the small reception- rooms, exclaiming: \\\"The baron's engaged, but I'm sure he would be annoyed if he failed to see you; and I will inform him at once.\\\"\\n\\nA moment later, the baron entered quite breathless from his hurried descent of the staircase.  \\\"Ah! you have been successful,\\\" he exclaimed, on seeing Pascal's face.\\n\\n\\\"Everything is progressing as favorably as I could wish, Monsieur le Baron, but I must speak with that foreigner whom I met here this morning.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Kami-Bey?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\" And in a few words, Pascal explained the situation.\\n\\n\\\"Providence is certainly on our side,\\\" said the baron, thoughtfully.  \\\"Kami is still here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is it possible?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's a fact.  Did you think it would be easy to get rid of this confounded Turk! He invited himself to breakfast without the slightest ceremony, and would give me no peace until I promised to play with him for two hours.  I was closeted with him, cards in hand, when they told me you were here.  Come, we'll go and question him.\\\"\\n\\nThey found the interesting foreigner in a savage mood.  He had been winning when the servant came for the baron, and he feared that an interruption would change the luck.  \\\"What the devil took you away?\\\" he exclaimed, with that coarseness of manner which was habitual with him, and which the flatterers around him styled \\\"form.\\\"  \\\"A man should no more be disturbed when he's playing than when he's eating.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come, come, prince,\\\" said the baron, good-naturedly, \\\"don't be angry, and I'll give you three hours instead of two.  But I have a favor to ask of you.\\\"\\n\\nThe foreigner at once thrust his hand into his pocket, with such a natural gesture, that neither the baron nor Pascal could repress a smile, and he himself understanding the cause of their merriment broke into a hearty laugh.  \\\"It's purely from force of habit,\\\" said he.  \\\"Ah! since I've been in Paris---- But what do you wish?\\\"\\n\\nThe baron sat down, and gravely replied: \\\"You told us scarcely an hour ago that you had been cheated in the purchase of some horses.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Cheated! it was worse than highway robbery.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Would it be indiscreet to ask you by whom you have been defrauded?\\\"\\n\\nKami-Bey's purple cheeks became a trifle pale.  \\\"Hum!\\\" said he, in an altered tone of voice, \\\"that is a delicate question.  My defrauder appears to be a dangerous fellow--a duellist--and if I disclose his knavery, he is quite capable of picking a quarrel with me--not that I am afraid of him, I assure you, but my principles don't allow me to fight.  When a man has an income of a million, he doesn't care to expose himself to the dangers of a duel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, prince, in France folks don't do a scoundrel the honor to cross swords with him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's just what my steward, who is a Frenchman, told me; but no matter.  Besides, I am not sufficiently sure of the man's guilt to noise it abroad.  I have no positive proofs as yet.\\\"\\n\\nHe was evidently terribly frightened, and the first thing to be done was to reassure him.  \\\"Come,\\\" insisted the baron, \\\"tell us the man's name.  This gentleman here\\\"--pointing to Pascal--\\\"is one of my most esteemed friends.  I will answer for him as I would for myself; and we will swear upon our honor not to reveal the secret we ask you for, without your permission.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Truly?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have our word of honor,\\\" replied both the baron and Pascal in a breath.\\n\\nAfter casting a half-frightened glance around him, the worthy Turk seemed to gather courage.  But no! He deliberated some time, and then rejoined: \\\"Really, I'm not sufficiently convinced of the accuracy of my suspicions to incur the risk of accusing a man who belongs in the very best society; a man who is very rich and very highly respected, and who would tolerate no imputations upon his character.\\\"\\n\\nIt was plain that he would not speak.  The baron shrugged his shoulders, but Pascal stepped bravely forward.  \\\"Then I will tell you, prince,\\\" he said, \\\"the name that you are determined to hide from us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you must allow me to remark that the baron and myself retract the promise we made you just now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Naturally.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then, your defrauder is the Marquis de Valorsay!\\\"\\n\\nIf Kami-Bey had seen an emissary of his sovereign enter the room carrying the fatal bow-string he would not have seemed more terror-stricken.  He sprang nervously on to his short, fat legs, his eyes wildly dilating and his hands fluttering despairingly.  \\\"Don't speak so loud! don't speak so loud!\\\" he exclaimed, imploringly.\\n\\nAs he did not even attempt to deny it, the truth of the assertion might be taken for granted.  But Pascal was not content with this.  \\\"Now that we know the fact, I hope, Prince, that you will be sufficiently obliging to tell us how it all happened,\\\" he remarked.\\n\\nPoor Kami.  He was in despair.  \\\"Alas!\\\" he replied, reluctantly, \\\"nothing could be more simple.  I wanted to set up a racing stable.  Not that I care much for sport.  I can scarcely distinguish a horse from a mule--but morning and evening, everybody says to me: 'Prince, a man like you ought to make your name celebrated on the turf.'  Besides I never open a paper without reading: 'Such a man ought to be a patron of the noblest of sports.'  At last, I said to myself: 'Yes, they are right.  I ought to take part in racing.'  So I began to look about for some horses.  I had purchased several, when the Marquis de Valorsay proposed to sell me some of his, some that were very well known, and that had--so he assured me--won at least ten times the amount they had cost him.  I accepted his offer, and visited his stables, where I selected seven of his best horses and paid for them; and I paid a good round price, I assure you.  Now comes the knavery.  He has not given me the horses I purchased.  The real animals, the valuable ones--have been sold in England under false names, and although the horses sent to me may be like the others in appearance, they are really only common animals, wanting both in blood and speed.\\\"\\n\\nPascal and the baron exchanged astonished glances.  It must be confessed that frauds of every description are common enough in the racing world, and a great deal of dishonest manoeuvring results from greed for gain united with the fever of gambling.  But never before had any one been accused of such an audacious and impudent piece of rascality as that which Kami-Bey imputed to Valorsay.\\n\\n\\\"How did you fail to discover this at the outset, prince?\\\" inquired Pascal in an incredulous tone.\\n\\n\\\"Because my time was so much occupied.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But your servants?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah! that's another thing.  I shouldn't be at all surprised if it were proved that the man who has charge of my stables had been bribed by the marquis.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then, how were your suspicions aroused?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It was only by the merest chance.  A jockey whom I thought of employing had often ridden one of the animals which I fancied myself the owner of.  Naturally, I showed him the horse, but he had no sooner set eyes on it than he exclaimed: 'That the horse! Never! You've been cheated, prince!' Then we examined the others, and the fraud became apparent.\\\"\\n\\nKnowing Kami's character better than Pascal, the baron had good reason to distrust the accuracy of these statements.  For the Turkish millionaire's superb contempt of money was only affected.  Vanity alone unloosed his purse-strings.  He was quite capable of presenting Jenny Fancy with a necklace costing five-and-twenty thousand francs for the sake of seeing his generosity recorded in the Gaulois or the Figaro the next day; but he would refuse to give a trifle to the mother of a starving family.  Besides, it was his ambition to be regarded as the most swindled man in Europe.  But though he was shamefully imposed upon, it was not voluntarily-- for there was a strong dose of Arabian avarice and distrust in his composition.\\n\\n\\\"Frankly, prince,\\\" said the baron, \\\"your story sounds like one of the wild legends of your native land.  Valorsay is certainly no fool.  How is it possible that he could have been guilty of so gross a fraud--a fraud which might be, which could not fail to be discovered in twenty-four hours--and which, once proven, would dishonor him forever?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Before perpetrating such a piece of deception upon any one else, he would have thought twice; but upon me it's different.  Isn't it an established fact that a person incurs no risk in robbing Kami- Bey?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Had I been in your place I should have quietly instituted an investigation.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What good would that have done? Besides, the sale was only conditional, and took place under the seal of secrecy.  The marquis reserved the right to take his horses back on payment of a stipulated sum, and the time he was to have for consideration only expired on the day before yesterday.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Eh! why didn't you tell us that at first?\\\" cried the baron.\\n\\nThe marquis's rascality was now easily explained.  Finding himself in a desperate strait, and feeling that his salvation was certain if he could only gain a little time, he had yielded to temptation, saying to himself, like unfaithful cashiers when they first appropriate their employers' money: \\\"I will pay it back, and no one will ever know it!\\\" However, when the day of settlement came he had found himself in as deplorable a plight as on the day of the robbery, and he had been compelled to yield to the force of circumstances.\\n\\n\\\"And what do you intend to do, prince?\\\" asked Pascal.\\n\\n\\\"Ah! I am still in doubt.  I have compelled the marquis to give me the papers in which the exploits of these horses are recorded.  These statements will be of service in case of a law-suit.  But shall I or shall I not enter a complaint against him? If it were a mere question of money I should let the matter drop; but he has defrauded and deceived me so outrageously that it annoys me.  On the other hand, to confess that he has cheated me in this fashion would cover me with ridicule.  Besides, the man is a dangerous enemy.  And what would become of me if I happened to side against him? I should be compelled to leave Paris.  Ah! I'd give ten thousand francs to any one who'd settle this cursed affair for me!\\\"\\n\\nHis perplexity was so great, and his anger so intense, for that once he tore off his eternal fez and flung it on to the table, swearing like a drayman.  However, controlling himself at last, he exclaimed in a tone of assumed indifference: \\\"No matter, there's been enough said on this subject for one day--I'm here to play--so let us begin, baron.  For we are wasting precious time, as you so often remark.\\\"\\n\\nPascal had nothing more to learn; so he shook hands with the baron, made an appointment with him for the same evening, and went away.\\n\\nIt was only half-past two; a good hour and a half remained at his disposal.  \\\"I will profit by this opportunity to eat something,\\\" he thought; a sudden faintness reminding him that he had taken nothing but a cup of chocolate that day.  Thereupon perceiving a cafe near by, he entered it, ordered breakfast, and lingered there until it was time to return to the Marquis de Valorsay's.  He would have gone there before the appointed time if he had merely listened to the promptings of his impatience, so thoroughly was he persuaded that this second interview would be decisive.  But prudence advised him not to expose himself to the danger of an encounter with Madame Leon and Dr.  Jodon.\\n\\n\\\"Well! Monsieur Maumejan,\\\" cried the marquis, as soon as Pascal made his appearance.  He had been counting the seconds with intense anxiety, as his tone of voice unmistakably revealed.\\n\\nIn reply Pascal gravely drew from his pocket twenty-four bank- notes, of a thousand francs each, and he placed them upon the table, saying: \\\"Here is the amount, Monsieur le Marquis.  I have, of course, deducted my commission.  Now, if you will write and sign a note for twenty-five thousand francs, payable to my order two months hence, our business for to-day will be concluded.\\\"\\n\\nM. de Valorsay's hand trembled nervously as he penned the desired note, for, until the very last moment, he had doubted the promises of this unknown agent who had made his appearance so opportunely Then, when the document was signed, he carelessly slipped the money into a drawer and exclaimed: \\\"So here's the needful to pay my debt of honor; but my embarrassment is none the less great.  These twenty-four thousand francs won't take the place of the hundred thousand which Baron Trigault promised me.\\\"\\n\\nAnd, as Pascal made no reply, the marquis began a desultory tramp up and down the smoking-room.  He was very pale, his brows were knit; he looked like a man who was meditating a decisive step, and who was calculating the consequences.  But having no time to waste in hesitation, he soon paused in front of Pascal, and exclaimed: \\\"Since you have just lent me twenty-four thousand francs, why won't you lend me the rest?\\\"\\n\\nBut Pascal shook his head.  \\\"One risks nothing by advancing twenty-five thousand francs to a person in your position, Monsieur le Marquis.  Whatever happens, such a sum as that can always be gathered from the wreck.  But double or triple the amount! The deuce! that requires reflection, and I must understand the situation thoroughly.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And if I told you that I am--almost ruined, what would you reply?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I shouldn't be so very much surprised.\\\"\\n\\nM. de Valorsay had now gone too far to draw back.  \\\"Ah, well!\\\" he resumed, \\\"the truth is this--my affairs are terribly involved.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The devil! You should have told me that sooner.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Wait; I am about to retrieve my fortune--to make it even larger than it has ever been.  I am on the point of contracting a marriage which will make me one of the richest men in Paris; but I must have a little time to bring the affair to a successful termination, and I need money--and my creditors are pressing me unmercifully.  You told me this morning that you once assisted a man who was in a similar position.  Will you help me? You can set your own price on your services.\\\"\\n\\nMore easily overcome by joy than by sorrow, Pascal almost betrayed himself.  He had attained his object.  Still, he succeeded in conquering his emotion, and it was in a perfectly calm voice that he replied: \\\"I can promise nothing until I understand the situation, Monsieur le Marquis.  Will you explain it to me? I am listening.\\\"\\n\\nXIV.\\n\\nIt was nearly midnight when M. Wilkie left the Hotel d'Argeles after the terrible scene in which he had revealed his true character.  On seeing him pass out with haggard eyes, colorless lips, and disordered clothing, the servants gathered in the vestibule took him at first for another of those ruined gamblers who not unfrequently left the house with despair in their hearts.\\n\\n\\\"Another fellow who's had bad luck!\\\" they remarked sneeringly to one another.\\n\\n\\\"No doubt about that.  He is pretty effectually used up, judging from appearances,\\\" one of them remarked.\\n\\nIt was not until some moments later that they learned a portion of the truth through the servants who had been on duty upstairs, and who now ran down in great terror, crying that Madame d'Argeles was dying, and that a physician must be summoned at once.\\n\\nM. Wilkie was already far away, hastening up the boulevard with an agile step.  Any one else would have been overcome with shame and sorrow--would have been frightened by the thought of what he had done, and have striven to find some way to conceal his disgrace; but he, not in the least.  In this frightful crisis, he was only conscious of one fact--that just as he raised his hand to strike Madame Lia d'Argeles, his mother, a big, burly individual had burst into the room, like a bombshell, caught him by the throat, forced him upon his knees, and compelled him to ask the lady's pardon.  He, Wilkie, to be humiliated in this style! He would never endure that.  This was an affront he could not swallow, one of those insults that cry out for vengeance and for blood.  \\\"Ah! the great brute shall pay for it,\\\" he repeated, again and again, grinding his teeth.  And if he hastened up the boulevard, it was only because he hoped to meet his two chosen friends, M. Costard and the Viscount de Serpillon, the co-proprietors of Pompier de Nanterre.\\n\\nFor he intended to place his outraged honor in their care.  They should be his seconds, and present his demand for satisfaction to the man who had insulted him.  A duel was the only thing that could appease his furious anger and heal his wounded pride.  And a great scandal, which he would be the hero of, was not without a certain charm for him.  What a glorious chance to win notoriety at an epoch when newspapers have become public laundries, in which every one washes his soiled linen and dries it in the glare of publicity! He saw his already remarkable reputation enhanced by the interest that always attaches to people who are talked about, and he could hear in advance the flattering whisper which would greet his appearance everywhere: \\\"You see that young man?--he is the hero of that famous adventure,\\\" etc.  Moreover, he was already twisting and turning the terms of the notice which his seconds must have inserted in the Figaro, hesitating between two or three equally startling beginnings: \\\"Another famous duel,\\\" or \\\"Yesterday, after a scandalous scene, an encounter,\\\" etc., etc.\",\"timestamp\":1640139792,\"title\":\"\\nThis gave Pascal an opportunity to present his programme, and he availed himself of it\"},\"digest\":\"UejmMNw2eiO6hk4Pavh897lVG2M6V8ZtSjlKQbqiu7w\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xADCB4dF6dDE8773EbfDdd36e426C63f9732738c9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ru2uFUDjHFBO7atJ6TkmDv0O1fC04YCpsRm2DuJLWYY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"LCfEW6Co8oAUNVSpy44h9wk_HsbzoVczfAXcUWon7g0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"3neREfOcIW1MAv-ZE994-4k50C32-Fcu6rhmo-WPotIlFUbq0s6n44tFFDH_DCYlMvSEV0GtNFgFQKVrLyUADQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa60fe45e8f3f227b38de1f3da4c2aeeb6d42df82348177a8f3291ac74c1869546acdfdb74fd35692c273a1f5cc7d78be0461734a73129332120874d08e30616b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ru2uFUDjHFBO7atJ6TkmDv0O1fC04YCpsRm2DuJLWYY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"LCfEW6Co8oAUNVSpy44h9wk_HsbzoVczfAXcUWon7g0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"UejmMNw2eiO6hk4Pavh897lVG2M6V8ZtSjlKQbqiu7w\"}"
