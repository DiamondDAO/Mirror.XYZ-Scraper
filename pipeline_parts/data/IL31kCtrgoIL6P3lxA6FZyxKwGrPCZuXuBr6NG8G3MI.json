"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"were intertwined with her own.  Ma'ame Pelagie remained unchanged and motionless. No human eye could penetrate so deep as to see the satisfaction which her soul felt.  She said: \\\"What do you mean, Petite? Your father has sent you to us, and I am sure it is his wish that you remain.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My father loves me, tante Pelagie, and such will not be his wish when he knows.  Oh!\\\" she continued with a restless, movement, \\\"it is as though a weight were pressing me backward here.  I must live another life; the life I lived before.  I want to know things that are happening from day to day over the world, and hear them talked about.  I want my music, my books, my companions.  If I had known no other life but this one of privation, I suppose it would be different.  If I had to live this life, I should make the best of it.  But I do not have to; and you know, tante Pelagie, you do not need to.  It seems to me,\\\" she added in a whisper, \\\"that it is a sin against myself.  Ah, Tan'tante!--what is the matter with Tan'tante?\\\"\\n\\nIt was nothing; only a slight feeling of faintness, that would soon pass.  She entreated them to take no notice; but they brought her some water and fanned her with a palmetto leaf.\\n\\nBut that night, in the stillness of the room, Mam'selle Pauline sobbed and would not be comforted.  Ma'ame Pelagie took her in her arms.\\n\\n\\\"Pauline, my little sister Pauline,\\\" she entreated, \\\"I never have seen you like this before.  Do you no longer love me? Have we not been happy together, you and I?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes, Sesoeur.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is it because La Petite is going away?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Sesoeur.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then she is dearer to you than I!\\\" spoke Ma'ame Pelagie with sharp resentment.  \\\"Than I, who held you and warmed you in my arms the day you were born; than I, your mother, father, sister, everything that could cherish you.  Pauline, don't tell me that.\\\"\\n\\nMam'selle Pauline tried to talk through her sobs.\\n\\n\\\"I can't explain it to you, Sesoeur.  I don't understand it myself. I love you as I have always loved you; next to God.  But if La Petite goes away I shall die.  I can't understand,--help me, Sesoeur.  She seems--she seems like a saviour; like one who had come and taken me by the hand and was leading me somewhere-somewhere I want to go.\\\"\\n\\nMa'ame Pelagie had been sitting beside the bed in her peignoir and slippers.  She held the hand of her sister who lay there, and smoothed down the woman's soft brown hair.  She said not a word, and the silence was broken only by Mam'selle Pauline's continued sobs.  Once Ma'ame Pelagie arose to mix a drink of orange-flower water, which she gave to her sister, as she would have offered it to a nervous, fretful child.  Almost an hour passed before Ma'ame Pelagie spoke again.  Then she said:--\\n\\n\\\"Pauline, you must cease that sobbing, now, and sleep.  You will make yourself ill.  La Petite will not go away.  Do you hear me? Do you understand? She will stay, I promise you.\\\"\\n\\nMam'selle Pauline could not clearly comprehend, but she had great faith in the word of her sister, and soothed by the promise and the touch of Ma'ame Pelagie's strong, gentle hand, she fell asleep.\\n\\nIII\\n\\nMa'ame Pelagie, when she saw that her sister slept, arose noiselessly and stepped outside upon the low-roofed narrow gallery. She did not linger there, but with a step that was hurried and agitated, she crossed the distance that divided her cabin from the ruin.\\n\\nThe night was not a dark one, for the sky was clear and the moon resplendent.  But light or dark would have made no difference to Ma'ame Pelagie.  It was not the first time she had stolen away to the ruin at night-time, when the whole plantation slept; but she never before had been there with a heart so nearly broken.  She was going there for the last time to dream her dreams; to see the visions that hitherto had crowded her days and nights, and to bid them farewell.\\n\\nThere was the first of them, awaiting her upon the very portal; a robust old white-haired man, chiding her for returning home so late.  There are guests to be entertained.  Does she not know it?  Guests from the city and from the near plantations.  Yes, she knows it is late.  She had been abroad with Felix, and they did not notice how the time was speeding.  Felix is there; he will explain it all.  He is there beside her, but she does not want to hear what he will tell her father.\\n\\nMa'ame Pelagie had sunk upon the bench where she and her sister so often came to sit.  Turning, she gazed in through the gaping chasm of the window at her side.  The interior of the ruin is ablaze.  Not with the moonlight, for that is faint beside the other one--the sparkle from the crystal candelabra, which negroes, moving noiselessly and respectfully about, are lighting, one after the other.  How the gleam of them reflects and glances from the polished marble pillars!\\n\\nThe room holds a number of guests.  There is old Monsieur Lucien Santien, leaning against one of the pillars, and laughing at something which Monsieur Lafirme is telling him, till his fat shoulders shake.  His son Jules is with him--Jules, who wants to marry her.  She laughs.  She wonders if Felix has told her father yet.  There is young Jerome Lafirme playing at checkers upon the sofa with Leandre.  Little Pauline stands annoying them and disturbing the game.  Leandre reproves her.  She begins to cry, and old black Clementine, her nurse, who is not far off, limps across the room to pick her up and carry her away.  How sensitive the little one is!  But she trots about and takes care of herself better than she did a year or two ago, when she fell upon the stone hall floor and raised a great \\\"bo-bo\\\" on her forehead. Pelagie was hurt and angry enough about it; and she ordered rugs and buffalo robes to be brought and laid thick upon the tiles, till the little one's steps were surer.\\n\\n\\\"Il ne faut pas faire mal a Pauline.\\\" She was saying it aloud --\\\"faire mal a Pauline.\\\"\\n\\nBut she gazes beyond the salon, back into the big dining hall, where the white crepe myrtle grows.  Ha! how low that bat has circled.  It has struck Ma'ame Pelagie full on the breast.  She does not know it.  She is beyond there in the dining hall, where her father sits with a group of friends over their wine.  As usual they are talking politics.  How tiresome!  She has heard them say \\\"la guerre\\\" oftener than once.  La guerre.  Bah!  She and Felix have something pleasanter to talk about, out under the oaks, or back in the shadow of the oleanders.\\n\\nBut they were right!  The sound of a cannon, shot at Sumter, has rolled across the Southern States, and its echo is heard along the whole stretch of Cote Joyeuse.\\n\\nYet Pelagie does not believe it.  Not till La Ricaneuse stands before her with bare, black arms akimbo, uttering a volley of vile abuse and of brazen impudence.  Pelagie wants to kill her.  But yet she will not believe.  Not till Felix comes to her in the chamber above the dining hall--there where that trumpet vine hangs--comes to say good-by to her.  The hurt which the big brass buttons of his new gray uniform pressed into the tender flesh of her bosom has never left it.  She sits upon the sofa, and he beside her, both speechless with pain.  That room would not have been altered.  Even the sofa would have been there in the same spot, and Ma'ame Pelagie had meant all along, for thirty years, all along, to lie there upon it some day when the time came to die.\\n\\nBut there is no time to weep, with the enemy at the door.  The door has been no barrier.  They are clattering through the halls now, drinking the wines, shattering the crystal and glass, slashing the portraits.\\n\\nOne of them stands before her and tells her to leave the house.  She slaps his face.  How the stigma stands out red as blood upon his blanched cheek!\\n\\nNow there is a roar of fire and the flames are bearing down upon her motionless figure.  She wants to show them how a daughter of Louisiana can perish before her conquerors.  But little Pauline clings to her knees in an agony of terror.  Little Pauline must be saved.\\n\\n\\\"Il ne faut pas faire mal a Pauline.\\\" Again she is saying it aloud--\\\"faire mal a Pauline.\\\"\\n\\nThe night was nearly spent; Ma'ame Pelagie had glided from the bench upon which she had rested, and for hours lay prone upon the stone flagging, motionless.  When she dragged herself to her feet it was to walk like one in a dream.  About the great, solemn pillars, one after the other, she reached her arms, and pressed her cheek and her lips upon the senseless brick.\\n\\n\\\"Adieu, adieu!\\\" whispered Ma'ame Pelagie.\\n\\nThere was no longer the moon to guide her steps across the familiar pathway to the cabin.  The brightest light in the sky was Venus, that swung low in the east.  The bats had ceased to beat their wings about the ruin.  Even the mocking-bird that had warbled for hours in the old mulberry-tree had sung himself asleep.  That darkest hour before the day was mantling the earth.  Ma'ame Pelagie hurried through the wet, clinging grass, beating aside the heavy moss that swept across her face, walking on toward the cabin-toward Pauline.  Not once did she look back upon the ruin that brooded like a huge monster--a black spot in the darkness that enveloped it.\\n\\nIV\\n\\nLittle more than a year later the transformation which the old Valmet place had undergone was the talk and wonder of Cote Joyeuse. One would have looked in vain for the ruin; it was no longer there; neither was the log cabin.  But out in the open, where the sun shone upon it, and the breezes blew about it, was a shapely structure fashioned from woods that the forests of the State had furnished.  It rested upon a solid foundation of brick.\\n\\nUpon a corner of the pleasant gallery sat Leandre smoking his afternoon cigar, and chatting with neighbors who had called.  This was to be his pied a terre now; the home where his sisters and his daughter dwelt.  The laughter of young people was heard out under the trees, and within the house where La Petite was playing upon the piano.  With the enthusiasm of a young artist she drew from the keys strains that seemed marvelously beautiful to Mam'selle Pauline, who stood enraptured near her.  Mam'selle Pauline had been touched by the re-creation of Valmet.  Her cheek was as full and almost as flushed as La Petite's.  The years were falling away from her.\\n\\nMa'ame Pelagie had been conversing with her brother and his friends.  Then she turned and walked away; stopping to listen awhile to the music which La Petite was making.  But it was only for a moment.  She went on around the curve of the veranda, where she found herself alone.  She stayed there, erect, holding to the banister rail and looking out calmly in the distance across the fields.\\n\\nShe was dressed in black, with the white kerchief she always wore folded across her bosom.  Her thick, glossy hair rose like a silver diadem from her brow.  In her deep, dark eyes smouldered the light of fires that would never flame.  She had grown very old. Years instead of months seemed to have passed over her since the night she bade farewell to her visions.\\n\\nPoor Ma'ame Pelagie!  How could it be different!  While the outward pressure of a young and joyous existence had forced her footsteps into the light, her soul had stayed in the shadow of the ruin.\\n\\nDesiree's Baby\\n\\nAs the day was pleasant, Madame Valmonde drove over to L'Abri to see Desiree and the baby.\\n\\nIt made her laugh to think of Desiree with a baby.  Why, it seemed but yesterday that Desiree was little more than a baby herself; when Monsieur in riding through the gateway of Valmonde had found her lying asleep in the shadow of the big stone pillar.\\n\\nThe little one awoke in his arms and began to cry for \\\"Dada.\\\" That was as much as she could do or say.  Some people thought she might have strayed there of her own accord, for she was of the toddling age.  The prevailing belief was that she had been purposely left by a party of Texans, whose canvas-covered wagon, late in the day, had crossed the ferry that Coton Mais kept, just below the plantation.  In time Madame Valmonde abandoned every speculation but the one that Desiree had been sent to her by a beneficent Providence to be the child of her affection, seeing that she was without child of the flesh.  For the girl grew to be beautiful and gentle, affectionate and sincere,--the idol of Valmonde.\\n\\nIt was no wonder, when she stood one day against the stone pillar in whose shadow she had lain asleep, eighteen years before, that Armand Aubigny riding by and seeing her there, had fallen in love with her.  That was the way all the Aubignys fell in love, as if struck by a pistol shot.  The wonder was that he had not loved her before; for he had known her since his father brought him home from Paris, a boy of eight, after his mother died there. The passion that awoke in him that day, when he saw her at the gate, swept along like an avalanche, or like a prairie fire, or like anything that drives headlong over all obstacles.\\n\\nMonsieur Valmonde grew practical and wanted things well considered: that is, the girl's obscure origin.  Armand looked into her eyes and did not care.  He was reminded that she was nameless. What did it matter about a name when he could give her one of the oldest and proudest in Louisiana?  He ordered the corbeille from Paris, and contained himself with what patience he could until it arrived; then they were married.\\n\\nMadame Valmonde had not seen Desiree and the baby for four weeks.  When she reached L'Abri she shuddered at the first sight of it, as she always did.  It was a sad looking place, which for many years had not known the gentle presence of a mistress, old Monsieur Aubigny having married and buried his wife in France, and she having loved her own land too well ever to leave it.  The roof came down steep and black like a cowl, reaching out beyond the wide galleries that encircled the yellow stuccoed house.  Big, solemn oaks grew close to it, and their thick-leaved, far-reaching branches shadowed it like a pall.  Young Aubigny's rule was a strict one, too, and under it his negroes had forgotten how to be gay, as they had been during the old master's easy-going and indulgent lifetime.\\n\\nThe young mother was recovering slowly, and lay full length, in her soft white muslins and laces, upon a couch.  The baby was beside her, upon her arm, where he had fallen asleep, at her breast.  The yellow nurse woman sat beside a window fanning herself.\\n\\nMadame Valmonde bent her portly figure over Desiree and kissed her, holding her an instant tenderly in her arms.  Then she turned to the child.\\n\\n\\\"This is not the baby!\\\" she exclaimed, in startled tones. French was the language spoken at Valmonde in those days.\\n\\n\\\"I knew you would be astonished,\\\" laughed Desiree, \\\"at the way he has grown.  The little cochon de lait!  Look at his legs, mamma, and his hands and fingernails,--real finger-nails.  Zandrine had to cut them this morning.  Isn't it true, Zandrine?\\\"\\n\\nThe woman bowed her turbaned head majestically, \\\"Mais si, Madame.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And the way he cries,\\\" went on Desiree, \\\"is deafening. Armand heard him the other day as far away as La Blanche's cabin.\\\"\\n\\nMadame Valmonde had never removed her eyes from the child. She lifted it and walked with it over to the window that was lightest.  She scanned the baby narrowly, then looked as searchingly at Zandrine, whose face was turned to gaze across the fields.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, the child has grown, has changed,\\\" said Madame Valmonde, slowly, as she replaced it beside its mother.  \\\"What does Armand say?\\\"\\n\\nDesiree's face became suffused with a glow that was happiness itself.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Armand is the proudest father in the parish, I believe, chiefly because it is a boy, to bear his name; though he says not,--that he would have loved a girl as well.  But I know it isn't true.  I know he says that to please me.  And mamma,\\\" she added, drawing Madame Valmonde's head down to her, and speaking in a whisper, \\\"he hasn't punished one of them--not one of them--since baby is born.  Even Negrillon, who pretended to have burnt his leg that he might rest from work--he only laughed, and said Negrillon was a great scamp. oh, mamma, I'm so happy; it frightens me.\\\"\\n\\nWhat Desiree said was true.  Marriage, and later the birth of his son had softened Armand Aubigny's imperious and exacting nature greatly.  This was what made the gentle Desiree so happy, for she loved him desperately.  When he frowned she trembled, but loved him.  When he smiled, she asked no greater blessing of God. But Armand's dark, handsome face had not often been disfigured by frowns since the day he fell in love with her.\\n\\nWhen the baby was about three months old, Desiree awoke one day to the conviction that there was something in the air menacing her peace.  It was at first too subtle to grasp.  It had only been a disquieting suggestion; an air of mystery among the blacks; unexpected visits from far-off neighbors who could hardly account for their coming.  Then a strange, an awful change in her husband's manner, which she dared not ask him to explain.  When he spoke to her, it was with averted eyes, from which the old love-light seemed to have gone out.  He absented himself from home; and when there, avoided her presence and that of her child, without excuse.  And the very spirit of Satan seemed suddenly to take hold of him in his dealings with the slaves.  Desiree was miserable enough to die.\\n\\nShe sat in her room, one hot afternoon, in her peignoir, listlessly drawing through her fingers the strands of her long, silky brown hair that hung about her shoulders.  The baby, half naked, lay asleep upon her own great mahogany bed, that was like a sumptuous throne, with its satin-lined half-canopy.  One of La Blanche's little quadroon boys--half naked too--stood fanning the child slowly with a fan of peacock feathers.  Desiree's eyes had been fixed absently and sadly upon the baby, while she was striving to penetrate the threatening mist that she felt closing about her. She looked from her child to the boy who stood beside him, and back again; over and over.  \\\"Ah!\\\"  It was a cry that she could not help; which she was not conscious of having uttered.  The blood turned like ice in her veins, and a clammy moisture gathered upon her face.\\n\\nShe tried to speak to the little quadroon boy; but no sound would come, at first.  When he heard his name uttered, he looked up, and his mistress was pointing to the door.  He laid aside the great, soft fan, and obediently stole away, over the polished floor, on his bare tiptoes.\\n\\nShe stayed motionless, with gaze riveted upon her child, and her face the picture of fright.\\n\\nPresently her husband entered the room, and without noticing her, went to a table and began to search among some papers which covered it.\\n\\n\\\"Armand,\\\" she called to him, in a voice which must have stabbed him, if he was human.  But he did not notice.  \\\"Armand,\\\" she said again.  Then she rose and tottered towards him.  \\\"Armand,\\\" she panted once more, clutching his arm, \\\"look at our child.  What does it mean? tell me.\\\"\\n\\nHe coldly but gently loosened her fingers from about his arm and thrust the hand away from him.  \\\"Tell me what it means!\\\" she cried despairingly.\\n\\n\\\"It means,\\\" he answered lightly, \\\"that the child is not white; it means that you are not white.\\\"\\n\\nA quick conception of all that this accusation meant for her nerved her with unwonted courage to deny it.  \\\"It is a lie; it is not true, I am white!  Look at my hair, it is brown; and my eyes are gray, Armand, you know they are gray.  And my skin is fair,\\\" seizing his wrist.  \\\"Look at my hand; whiter than yours, Armand,\\\" she laughed hysterically.\\n\\n\\\"As white as La Blanche's,\\\" he returned cruelly; and went away leaving her alone with their child.\\n\\nWhen she could hold a pen in her hand, she sent a despairing letter to Madame Valmonde.\\n\\n\\\"My mother, they tell me I am not white.  Armand has told me I am not white.  For God's sake tell them it is not true.  You must know it is not true.  I shall die.  I must die.  I cannot be so unhappy, and live.\\\"\\n\\nThe answer that came was brief:\\n\\n\\\"My own Desiree: Come home to Valmonde; back to your mother who loves you.  Come with your child.\\\"\\n\\nWhen the letter reached Desiree she went with it to her husband's study, and laid it open upon the desk before which he sat.  She was like a stone image: silent, white, motionless after she placed it there.\\n\\nIn silence he ran his cold eyes over the written words.\\n\\nHe said nothing.  \\\"Shall I go, Armand?\\\" she asked in tones sharp with agonized suspense.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, go.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you want me to go?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I want you to go.\\\"\\n\\nHe thought Almighty God had dealt cruelly and unjustly with him; and felt, somehow, that he was paying Him back in kind when he stabbed thus into his wife's soul.  Moreover he no longer loved her, because of the unconscious injury she had brought upon his home and his name.\\n\\nShe turned away like one stunned by a blow, and walked slowly towards the door, hoping he would call her back.\\n\\n\\\"Good-by, Armand,\\\" she moaned.\\n\\nHe did not answer her.  That was his last blow at fate.\\n\\nDesiree went in search of her child.  Zandrine was pacing the sombre gallery with it.  She took the little one from the nurse's arms with no word of explanation, and descending the steps, walked away, under the live-oak branches.\\n\\nIt was an October afternoon; the sun was just sinking.  Out in the still fields the negroes were picking cotton.\\n\\nDesiree had not changed the thin white garment nor the slippers which she wore.  Her hair was uncovered and the sun's rays brought a golden gleam from its brown meshes.  She did not take the broad, beaten road which led to the far-off plantation of Valmonde. She walked across a deserted field, where the stubble bruised her tender feet, so delicately shod, and tore her thin gown to shreds.\\n\\nShe disappeared among the reeds and willows that grew thick along the banks of the deep, sluggish bayou; and she did not come back again.\\n\\nSome weeks later there was a curious scene enacted at L'Abri. In the centre of the smoothly swept back yard was a great bonfire. Armand Aubigny sat in the wide hallway that commanded a view of the spectacle; and it was he who dealt out to a half dozen negroes the material which kept this fire ablaze.\\n\\nA graceful cradle of willow, with all its dainty furbishings, was laid upon the pyre, which had already been fed with the richness of a priceless layette.  Then there were silk gowns, and velvet and satin ones added to these; laces, too, and embroideries; bonnets and gloves; for the corbeille had been of rare quality.\",\"timestamp\":1639989081,\"title\":\"\\nA spasm passed through Mam'selle Pauline's delicate frame.
