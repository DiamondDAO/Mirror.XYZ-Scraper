ROSSETTI\\n\\nSongs light as these may sound, though deep and strong\\nThe heart spake through them, scarce should hope to please\\nEars tuned to strains of loftier thoughts than throng\\nSongs light as these.\\n\\nYet grace may set their sometime doubt at ease,\\nNor need their too rash reverence fear to wrong\\nThe shrine it serves at and the hope it sees.\\n\\nFor childlike loves and laughters thence prolong\\nNotes that bid enter, fearless as the breeze,\\nEven to the shrine of holiest-hearted song,\\nSongs light as these.\\n\\nIN HARBOUR\\n\\nI.\\n\\nGoodnight and goodbye to the life whose signs denote us\\nAs mourners clothed with regret for the life gone by;\\nTo the waters of gloom whence winds of the dayspring float us\\nGoodnight and goodbye.\\n\\nA time is for mourning, a season for grief to sigh;\\nBut were we not fools and blind, by day to devote us\\nAs thralls to the darkness, unseen of the sundawn's eye?\\n\\nWe have drunken of Lethe at length, we have eaten of lotus;\\nWhat hurts it us here that sorrows are born and die?\\nWe have said to the dream that caressed and the dread that smote us\\nGoodnight and goodbye.\\n\\nII.\\n\\nOutside of the port ye are moored in, lying\\nClose from the wind and at ease from the tide,\\nWhat sounds come swelling, what notes fall dying\\nOutside?\\n\\nThey will not cease, they will not abide:\\nVoices of presage in darkness crying\\nPass and return and relapse aside.\\n\\nYe see not, but hear ye not wild wings flying\\nTo the future that wakes from the past that died?\\nIs grief still sleeping, is joy not sighing\\nOutside?\\n\\nTHE WAY OF THE WIND\\n\\nThe wind's way in the deep sky's hollow\\nNone may measure, as none can say\\nHow the heart in her shows the swallow\\nThe wind's way.\\n\\nHope nor fear can avail to stay\\nWaves that whiten on wrecks that wallow,\\nTimes and seasons that wane and slay.\\n\\nLife and love, till the strong night swallow\\nThought and hope and the red last ray,\\nSwim the waters of years that follow\\nThe wind's way.\\n\\n'HAD I WIST'\\n\\nHad I wist, when life was like a warm wind playing\\nLight and loud through sundawn and the dew's bright trust,\\nHow the time should come for hearts to sigh in saying\\n'Had I wist' -\\n\\nSurely not the roses, laughing as they kissed,\\nNot the lovelier laugh of seas in sunshine swaying,\\nShould have lured my soul to look thereon and list.\\n\\nNow the wind is like a soul cast out and praying\\nVainly, prayers that pierce not ears when hearts resist:\\nNow mine own soul sighs, adrift as wind and straying,\\n'Had I wist.'\\n\\nRECOLLECTIONS\\n\\nI.\\n\\nYears upon years, as a course of clouds that thicken\\nThronging the ways of the wind that shifts and veers,\\nPass, and the flames of remembered fires requicken\\nYears upon years.\\n\\nSurely the thought in a man's heart hopes or fears\\nNow that forgetfulness needs must here have stricken\\nAnguish, and sweetened the sealed-up springs of tears.\\n\\nAh, but the strength of regrets that strain and sicken,\\nYearning for love that the veil of death endears,\\nSlackens not wing for the wings of years that quicken -\\nYears upon years.\\n\\nII.\\n\\nYears upon years, and the flame of love's high altar\\nTrembles and sinks, and the sense of listening ears\\nHeeds not the sound that it heard of love's blithe psalter\\nYears upon years.\\n\\nOnly the sense of a heart that hearkens hears,\\nLouder than dreams that assail and doubts that palter,\\nSorrow that slept and that wakes ere sundawn peers.\\n\\nWakes, that the heart may behold, and yet not falter,\\nFaces of children as stars unknown of, spheres\\nSeen but of love, that endures though all things alter,\\nYears upon years.\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nYears upon years, as a watch by night that passes,\\nPass, and the light of their eyes is fire that sears\\nSlowly the hopes of the fruit that life amasses\\nYears upon years.\\n\\nPale as the glimmer of stars on moorland meres\\nLighten the shadows reverberate from the glasses\\nHeld in their hands as they pass among their peers.\\n\\nLights that are shadows, as ghosts on graveyard grasses,\\nMoving on paths that the moon of memory cheers,\\nShew but as mists over cloudy mountain passes\\nYears upon years.\\n\\nTIME AND LIFE\\n\\nI.\\n\\nTime, thy name is sorrow, says the stricken\\nHeart of life, laid waste with wasting flame\\nEre the change of things and thoughts requicken,\\nTime, thy name.\\n\\nGirt about with shadow, blind and lame,\\nGhosts of things that smite and thoughts that sicken\\nHunt and hound thee down to death and shame.\\n\\nEyes of hours whose paces halt or quicken\\nRead in bloodred lines of loss and blame,\\nWrit where cloud and darkness round it thicken,\\nTime, thy name.\\n\\nII.\\n\\nNay, but rest is born of me for healing,\\n\\n* So might haply time, with voice represt,\\n  Speak:  is grief the last gift of my dealing?\\n  Nay, but rest.\\n\\nAll the world is wearied, east and west,\\nTired with toil to watch the slow sun wheeling,\\nTwelve loud hours of life's laborious quest.\\n\\nEyes forspent with vigil, faint and reeling,\\nFind at last my comfort, and are blest,\\nNot with rapturous light of life's revealing -\\nNay, but rest.\\n\\nA DIALOGUE\\n\\nI.\\n\\nDeath, if thou wilt, fain would I plead with thee:\\nCanst thou not spare, of all our hopes have built,\\nOne shelter where our spirits fain would be,\\nDeath, if thou wilt?\\n\\nNo dome with suns and dews impearled and gilt,\\nImperial:  but some roof of wildwood tree,\\nToo mean for sceptre's heft or swordblade's hilt.\\n\\nSome low sweet roof where love might live, set free\\nFrom change and fear and dreams of grief or guilt;\\nCanst thou not leave life even thus much to see,\\nDeath, if thou wilt?\\n\\nII.\\n\\nMan, what art thou to speak and plead with me?\\nWhat knowest thou of my workings, where and how\\nWhat things I fashion?  Nay, behold and see,\\nMan, what art thou?\\n\\nThy fruits of life, and blossoms of thy bough,\\nWhat are they but my seedlings?  Earth and sea\\nBear nought but when I breathe on it must bow.\\n\\nBow thou too down before me:  though thou be\\nGreat, all the pride shall fade from off thy brow,\\nWhen Time and strong Oblivion ask of thee,\\nMan, what art thou?\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nDeath, if thou be or be not, as was said,\\nImmortal; if thou make us nought, or we\\nSurvive:  thy power is made but of our dread,\\nDeath, if thou be.\\n\\nThy might is made out of our fear of thee:\\nWho fears thee not, hath plucked from off thine head\\nThe crown of cloud that darkens earth and sea.\\n\\nEarth, sea, and sky, as rain or vapour shed,\\nShall vanish; all the shows of them shall flee:\\nThen shall we know full surely, quick or dead,\\nDeath, if thou be.\\n\\nPLUS ULTRA\\n\\nFar beyond the sunrise and the sunset rises\\nHeaven, with worlds on worlds that lighten and respond:\\nThought can see not thence the goal of hope's surmises\\nFar beyond.\\n\\nNight and day have made an everlasting bond\\nEach with each to hide in yet more deep disguises\\nTruth, till souls of men that thirst for truth despond.\\n\\nAll that man in pride of spirit slights or prizes,\\nAll the dreams that make him fearful, fain, or fond,\\nFade at forethought's touch of life's unknown surprises\\nFar beyond.\\n\\nA DEAD FRIEND\\n\\nI.\\n\\nGone, O gentle heart and true,\\nFriend of hopes foregone,\\nHopes and hopeful days with you\\nGone?\\n\\nDays of old that shone\\nSaw what none shall see anew,\\nWhen we gazed thereon.\\n\\nSoul as clear as sunlit dew,\\nWhy so soon pass on,\\nForth from all we loved and knew\\nGone?\\n\\nII.\",\"timestamp\":1636103836,\"title\":\"\\nA Century of Roundels\\n\"},\"digest\":\"jp8AtEOm_1ZHaXa--xPO-dr9rY1zzJh-ExIj5_8IVsw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8B618F70Ab9b48034d51dD2B87eFEf243B118980\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"y7C6gtZ3SMrnzSQeGhXGxYIzZg-ikQmgy1L2BGKBpMM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"w_NbxM5lvDmgcwQm70FIK11nBvY24OCyzmvk5SbLY9o\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"fjdEU0sRbnzCSp5KZsSJzGd1khQBhfr0CAvCWLRYS50A_ASa2l6vDyLVVtgz5PxfC1q1MVoks4E3p5AXZmBk9w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe0e6699928bb478511dafa5928d65f87b559c6d506ffbe5e52223bf51798da4616a52649c0404ea79ea9b2c26b9f260d907cf83ba222e211ac106bbf1007732c1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"y7C6gtZ3SMrnzSQeGhXGxYIzZg-ikQmgy1L2BGKBpMM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"w_NbxM5lvDmgcwQm70FIK11nBvY24OCyzmvk5SbLY9o\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jp8AtEOm_1ZHaXa--xPO-dr9rY1zzJh-ExIj5_8IVsw\"}"
