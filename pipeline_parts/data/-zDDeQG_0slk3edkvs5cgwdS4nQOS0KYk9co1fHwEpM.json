The bar ***should*** be clean, staffed, fridges stocked, fruits cut and furniture set-up according to our agreement. However don‚Äôt take it for granted. Arrive early and help our host check they‚Äôre ready.\\n2. 1 out of 10 times **stuff goes wrong**. You need to be early to accommodate it. Live bands, water leaks, power cut, pigeon behind the bar‚Ä¶ you name it.\\n\\n## üëã Greet the Staff\\n\\nGreet every single worker, ignore nobody. Seriously.\\n\\n## The space\\n\\n### Tables\\n\\nMove tables to the walls. People shouldn‚Äôt get in-between the table and the wall, it breaks the ability of groups to mingle and flow.\\n\\n### Chairs\\n\\nIt‚Äôs a standing event. Seating for no more than 10% of participants.\\n\\n### Bar\\n\\nCheck the bar (and toilets) are clean and the staff have stocked their fridges, cut fruit, and are ready for an invasion.\\n\\n### Temperature\\n\\nCheck the venue is ready for 200 hot bodies. Crank the AC and fans.\\n\\n### Music\\n\\nNormal volume for a fun bar. Not silence. Not Night club.\\n\\n## Flag Table\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/w2-J4Nm7ueCvaeKqsn_EY.png?height=354&width=959)\\n\\n### Open Attendance Tally\\n\\nCount those local flags before starting. [More info.](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/UEnVxXFF-_9uZHZHrKI8C_KB5N6XPPiOypUTRM34Y6w)\\n\\n### Table Prep\\n\\nSet up near the entrance or somewhere participants inevitably pass on their way to the bar. Put the **5 ‚Äì 8** most common languages on the table so you don‚Äôt frequently flick through the event folder. You should have a cutter and a pen just in case. [More info.](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/UEnVxXFF-_9uZHZHrKI8C_KB5N6XPPiOypUTRM34Y6w)\\n\\n### Staff Drinks\\n\\nUsually bars offer courtesy drinks. 2 or 3 drinks for every 50 participants is reasonable. Only the Manager gets the drinks from the bar, not other team members.\\n\\n### During the event\\n\\nYour flag post is open around 3 hours, and staffed by [trained Residents](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/bBAbDlrE9FuubfgvCPYFl4l8BFsddtYNExCxqhBtrB4) only, not Ambassadors. If you leave someone else running the flag table return to it at least every 20 minutes to:\\n\\n* Check there‚Äôs one full sheet of each ‚Äòpopular‚Äô country out of the folder\\n* Ensure that empty flag sheets are removed from the table.\\n* Offer more drinks or allow toilet breaks to your Team.\\n\\nManagers spend **at least one hour** at the flag post, nobody is above it. You may like to arrange 20 minute turns between you and your Greeters to keep things interesting.\\n\\n### üí¶ Drinks on the flag table.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gKW3Ppn_y7_cWQUOIZk7E.png?height=366&width=1661)\\n\\nMaybe not the first time, nor the next, maybe not in 100 times, **but one day** that drink someone just rested on the flag table for a moment, will be knocked over *- not even by the same person who put it there ‚Äì* destroying your flags and throwing you into a crisis (and emergency flag order).Say: \\\\*\\\\*‚ÄúExcuse me, would you mind resting that drink on a different table‚Äù.\\\\*\\\\*People get it.\\n\\n### Leave the Flag Table\\n\\nThe flag table is set, team in place, now get out there, talk with people and learn their names. Find out why they‚Äôre here, suggest people they should meet. However, don‚Äôt let the conversation run over 30 minutes, you‚Äôre working! Interrupt them and let them know ‚ÄúI have to break a way for a while to do my rounds‚Äù, AKA your **‚ÄòMid-way checks‚Äô**.\\n\\n## Mid-Way Checks\\n\\nEvery 30 minutes stop what you‚Äôre doing; drop everything including your conversation. Choose 3 or 4 random points around the venue and go to each one making these checks. Avoid eye contact, come back to the people later.\\n\\n* ‚úÖ **Tables/Chairs**  \\n See any bottlenecks? Remove chairs, push tables to the sides.\\n* ‚úÖ **Broken things**  \\n Look for broken glasses, spilled drinks, rubbish on the floor. Toilets should have toilet roll especially in the Ladies.\\n* ‚úÖ **Waiting Time**\\n  Are people waiting a long time at the bar? Make sure access to the bar isn‚Äôt obstructed by bar stools or people socialising at the bar.\\n* ‚úÖ **Music, Lighting, Temperature**\\n  Music loud enough to hear without shouting in your ear. Lighting like a romantic candle-lit date.Temperature like a spring meadow.\\n* ‚úÖ **Shy People \\n **Look for people standing alone, if you see one, send an Ambassador or a [Cupid](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/sKQAXOKMUR7ruynT8iHu8IuCxI9kruvjl0cWp75AROI) if you have one.\\n* ‚úÖ **Random Survey \\n **Approach someone you don‚Äôt know, excuse yourself for interrupting them and ask what they think of the music, the ambience, bar waiting time, anything they would improve. If they don‚Äôt know you, they will be brutally honest (great right?!)\\n* ‚úÖ **Speech \\n **Listen in on your team when they give the speech. Don‚Äôt be obvious, but check they‚Äôre getting the key points of ‚Äò[The Speech](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/bBAbDlrE9FuubfgvCPYFl4l8BFsddtYNExCxqhBtrB4)‚Äô\\n\\n## Close Up\\n\\n### Close the Flag Table after 3 hours\\n\\n**Why?** Nobody wants to be a loner standing in the middle of an empty bar with flags on their chest at 7pm. Those who have that experience will come back at 9pm next week. Problem is, the one who arrives at 7.30pm is now a loner, and this cycle compounds over time until everyone is arriving at 10pm. Set an upper limit on the flag availability and tell late comers that they should arrive earlier in the future. It may feel counter-intuitive to refuse people the flags, but it works long term.\\n\\n**Close Attendance Tally**\\nCount those local flags before closing, figure out how many people came.

Collect the till receipt, take a photo for your Telegram group.
