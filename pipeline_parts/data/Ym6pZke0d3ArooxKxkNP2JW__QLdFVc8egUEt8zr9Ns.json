"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Mining is the business of Bitcoin, and initiating fund transfer in the Bitcoin world is also part of the business. I think digital currency does not come out of thin air. Aircoin is easy for people who understand, to judge the value of the business, the feasibility of the business, and the progress of the business. Can judge whether this currency is an air currency or not.\\n\\nBusiness monetization is a real product, not a concept of capital operation, but more a landed business.\\n\\nI think in the next few years, the track of digital currency is not a \\\"name\\\". After the bubble, it will eventually return to \\\"business\\\", creating value for users, people's lives, work, study, and entertainment.\\n\\nDigital currency is just a monetization concept for business.\\n\\nWhen we are in contact with some new coins, don't rush to look at the price, look at the business, and judge the conditions that need to be met to achieve this business, and the feasibility of the business. If the business is empty, this coin is basically an air coin.\\nThe name is not the point. I have heard a lot of coin names, but I rarely hear the business of coins.\\n\\nBusiness monetization is not just simple monetization.\\n\\nThe biggest difference between digital currency and points, one is currency, and the other is points, and it is very likely that there are only such differences. For example: Bitcoin is currency, while China Mobileâ€™s M points are points. When it comes to value, M points can also be used for shopping and business. The essential difference between the two is still the difference in definition.\\n\\nThe definition of the former is to compare real currencies, and the difference of the latter is only the additional points.\\n\\nCurrency has some characteristics. Value preservation and appreciation are two of the typical characteristics. When we try to monetize our business, these two characteristics should be considered first. Your currency must be able to maintain its value, not like a roller coaster.\\n\\nBitcoin's own industrial chain (excluding the part of capital speculation) should also have a similar mechanism.\\n\\nThis point is easy to correlate and speculate. The number of bitcoins issued is limited. According to known information, the number of bitcoins issued each year is decreasing, which means that it will be more and more difficult to obtain bitcoins through mining. If the cost paid by users increases, but the revenue decreases, users of this product will be lost.\\n\\nI think Satoshi Nakamoto will not allow this to happen, which is why many Bitcoin miners can increase the cost of buying mining machines, because his foundation is to maintain value.\\n\\nAnother core point of business monetization lies in business value empowerment.\\n\\nI have always believed that the so-called digital currency is actually a manifestation of the empowerment of real business to digital currency. When we talk about the value of digital currency, there is always an awkward link.\\n\\nWho is paying for the digital currency? When a \\\"miner\\\" digs a bitcoin, it is equivalent to getting a certain amount of cash. If the official withdrawal is made from the bitcoin, then the money is subsidized by Satoshi Nakamoto? (Excluding buying and selling in the capital market)\\n\\nObviously not. If you have a certain understanding of mining, I think you should know that what miners are mining is actually an \\\"information package\\\" and \\\"Bitcoin\\\" is just one element of this \\\"information package\\\". Simply put, mining itself is a complete business, and Bitcoin is just a reward mechanism for users to complete this business.\\n\\nThere is only one link that can empower Bitcoin, which is the income of the business itself.\\n\\nThere is a case that everyone is spreading-\\\"transfer\\\", which can be transferred without bank supervision. If we understand this case as the \\\"business\\\" of Bitcoin, can we understand the most essential source of value of \\\"Bitcoin\\\", that is, transfer fees.\\n\\nOf course, this is just my personal guess. In fact, there is not necessarily only one business that empowers a \\\"digital currency\\\". It can be multiple businesses to empower a digital currency, as long as we can find a combination. .\\n\\nThere is another business operation model behind the concept of digital currency, and we can even interpret digital currency as a manifestation of this business operation model.\\n\\nAs a company, I am willing to share part of my revenue with my users, and the value of the company will be tied to the value of users. The higher the value of the enterprise, the higher the value obtained by users, and the higher the value obtained by users, the more they will recognize and trust the enterprise.\\n\\nIn the Bitcoin world, all the \\\"handling fees\\\" can be eaten by the enterprise. In this way, the value of the user's harvest will be reduced, and I don't think there will be the current Bitcoin.\\n\\nBusiness monetization is a way for companies to deeply associate themselves with users. The current Internet is still in a separate state.\\n\\nEnterprises get benefits from users, and users get benefits from the services provided by the company, but this is not a balanced form. In fact, compared to the huge benefits that companies get, users get very little.\\n\\nEspecially seed users, loyal users in the initial stage of the product, fission users who bring new users to the product. On the surface, the proliferation of users seems to be induced by the product, and is not an employment relationship. However, we cannot deny that users have generated great value in the development of the enterprise.\",\"timestamp\":1634807443,\"title\":\"Business monetization\"},\"digest\":\"E8XHn3mc9ixB42VAwlrgZ5gz_V5APXgxxuaJPFfVjrs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd191aFE8C2Ac2423ffDa05DBd2493D8BE571197b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"psjFASI1OSV-wvHOmmDQMiz1TKscTZ0d0gxmb1fNQmQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"7Ey3AsXXrqjzccAZAV9276dc4UN0DaT3cOHdeHZURbY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"yv4NfJxx7O3qO4vLbtEz6bdfwgvDPPnAzkriNbU2AnD0GB1w0c4CM2PIDqVYd39PDHe0xauuP3EOx5Fesgw7mA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x34b6f7ac01d7a55271c82c902bf25bcd43d396e707897195e81b600b251f56215d54b17a6e4287a9c8a4e007a5d905d01ae15976bab9d8128f1ee7b6508ed4c11c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"psjFASI1OSV-wvHOmmDQMiz1TKscTZ0d0gxmb1fNQmQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"7Ey3AsXXrqjzccAZAV9276dc4UN0DaT3cOHdeHZURbY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"E8XHn3mc9ixB42VAwlrgZ5gz_V5APXgxxuaJPFfVjrs\"}"
