Memes to go\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What is CityDAO?\\n\\nThe CityDAO community is made up of ambitious and HIGHLY curious people exploring and building at the frontier of technology, governance and physical land.\\n\\nThe vision of CityDAO is to build the city of the future on the Ethereum blockchain by tokenizing land, rights, and governance.\\n\\n## 🔈CityDAO so far\\n\\nFirst, let’s do a quick recap of the CityDAO adventure so far:\\n\\n**Month 1: July - laying the groundwork**\\n\\n* **July 1** - DAOs can legally be recognized as an LLC in Wyoming\\n* **July 2** - CityDAO starts (Scott’s infamous tweet)\\n* **July 7** - First community call\\n* **July 15** - CityDAO Discord membership crosses 1000 people\\n* **July 23** - CityDAO officially registered as an LLC in Wyoming\\n* **July 28** - CityDAO gets voted in on Mirror’s $WRITE RACE\\n\\n**Month 2: August - bolstering the treasury**\\n\\n* **August 8** - The First Citizen NFT sells for 6.52 ETH\\n* **August 11** - Release Founding Citizen NFTs\\n* **August 12** - CityDAO treasury passes $30k\\n* **August 20** - CityDAO treasury passes $100k\\n* **August 25** - Founding Citizen NFT sells for 10 ETH live in a community call\\n* **August 25** - CityDAO treasury passes $250k\\n* **August 26** - Connect w/ real estate agent in Wyoming to help with land purchase\\n\\n**Month 3: September - voting on land acquisition**\\n\\n* **September 08** - CityDAO forum is added to aid governance discussions\\n* **September 15** - Dev & Design team demo the parcel viewer\\n* **September 21** - CityDAO citizens vote on first parcel purchase\\n* **September 27** - Citizens vote to make offer on “Parcel 6” (40 acres)\\n* **September 28** - CityDAO makes an offer on real land\\n* **September 28** - Offer accepted, land purchase process begins\\n\\n### Live footage of CityDAO going from tweet to citizens voting on putting an offer on 40 acres of real Wyoming land…in 3 months 😂 :\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vKOY51NA2DwmZbQoll1rV.gif?height=400&width=480)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 🔈News & Updates\\n\\n# 🗞 Annnnd our DAO has officially purchased land! 🎊\\n\\n![WAGMI vibes right here](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FmbW8L0eDN3hh_cUBjUlE.png?height=702&width=1043)\\n\\n![CityDAO flag going up on the land](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/H-C4tGhmdYUCcJalTF-H5.png?height=1398&width=1054)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k2kW3fYZebFAqQJTUNbuz.png?height=197&width=375)\\n\\n### 🗞 OpenSea de-listed CityDAO\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/chadfowler/status/1444365420388044806?s=20](https://twitter.com/chadfowler/status/1444365420388044806?s=20)\\n\\n**What happened?**\\n\\nWe found out the NFTs were de-listed from new members asking why they couldn’t buy a Citizen NFT. We received no notification, e-mail or information at all from OpenSea as to what happened. We sent multiple support tickets, reached out in their Discord server, and finally got some answers after utilizing our collective networks to get a hold of someone there.\\n\\n**Why did they de-list the NFTs?**\\n\\nSince land tokenization is central to our DAO and these NFTs would give access to land drops they believe the NFTs went against their terms. They explained its because OpenSea doesn't allow listing real estate. Our NFTs are not real estate but they don’t want to support anything that could be related.\\n\\n[OpenSea experienced controversy](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58585342) in September with an insider trading situation. They are likely highly risk-averse right now.\\n\\n### 🗞 What’s next? Solution: create independent smart contract (in development)\\n\\n1. The new one will be ERC721 and 100% independent of any exchange. Minting will be done through our site.\\n2. Once ready, previous NFTs can be exchanged 1:1 with the new ones at any time, and they have the same rights/value.\\n\\n### 🗞 When will Citizen NFTs be available again?\\n\\nTimeline TBD but we anticipate it being in the near-future. Please reach out if you have any questions or have experience in this space. We’ll post in #announcements once we have updates.\\n\\n### 🗞 Parcel Viewer - here’s a glimpse of the CityDAO parcel explorer! @Greg, @Bpetes, @odyslam and @scott have been on fire with this one 🔥\\n\\n> A web app to view & trade CityDAO land parcels\\n\\n[Here’s a link to a 45 second Loom for a better view](https://www.loom.com/share/a9adac738b2d4003a12ad3359e26f846).\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/snbdoc4j5qWBAm4A4Kf5O.gif?height=270&width=480)\\n\\n### 🗞 So… Balaji’s call-to-action sounds fun.

This looks so cool!\\n\\n> One using a regular grid and another more curved following the site contours. *They are colored based on the slope of the subparcel (red is steeper and green is flatter). Indeed, it seems that's nearly impossible to build on some places, especially the southwest part. These are done parametrically, so we can dynamically change a bunch of inputs like street width, parcel size, street path, etc.*\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bnXSxJCwdw96bjriQPl9X.png?height=1438&width=1762)\\n\\n### 🌆 Shout-out to this vote.\\n\\nIs this the first time something like this has happened? 👀\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wyAuaGL3f2GlahJ-thytO.png?height=1350&width=1814)\\n\\n### 🌆 @Ethsol’s has been experimenting and showing the community neat ways to visualize and think about land parcels\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HpXfBZYBdv_TRP8r1ss_T.png?height=611&width=903)\\n\\n[https://data.geospatialhub.org/](https://data.geospatialhub.org/)\\n\\n### 🌆 @alexthims showcased a bias to action and created this fantastic Welcome to CityDAO doc 🎉\\n\\nThis is going to be a game changer for helping people get a quick download of CityDAO.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cUfBIajipYCDKfZ2zoz0c.png?height=1328&width=1756)\\n\\n[https://blossom-harp-c4d.notion.site/Welcome-to-CityDAO-4a111e9e3aa94f2f8e705284816b31cf](https://blossom-harp-c4d.notion.site/Welcome-to-CityDAO-4a111e9e3aa94f2f8e705284816b31cf)\\n\\n### 🌆 Shout-out to @odyslam for getting the CityDAO forum up and running!\\n\\nNext up our goal is to find ways to improve visibility, discussion engagement, and governance process to make it easier to contribute.\\n\\n[https://forum.citydao.io/](https://forum.citydao.io/)\\n\\n### 🌆 Big thanks to @JAKE and @Scott for this intriguing episode on Pod of Jake!\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/blogofjake/status/1438116186101895178?s=20](https://twitter.com/blogofjake/status/1438116186101895178?s=20)\\n\\nAlso, highly recommend dipping into @JAKE’s backlog.
