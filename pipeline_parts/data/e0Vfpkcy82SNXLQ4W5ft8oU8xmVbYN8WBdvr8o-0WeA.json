"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"For the sake of oblivion from the yearning pain, most people look up to the sky. It helps to distance themselves from everyday life. I'm digging in other people's guts, it helps too.\\n\\nI did not ask for this nasty gift, but I feel everything: what their clothes smell like, what their words smell like, what their thoughts smell like; and when you smell others, you yourself become kinda odorless.\\n\\nWhat's your early baldness compared to thirteen-year-old Joshua's family crashed in a car accident? Do you want to know why he survived? Because he was punished and stayed at home. Behaving badly is bad, but it can save your life.\\n\\nEveryone is talking about how unlucky he is, and only Joshua, judging by the white sneakers and pink lips that do not have time to cool down from the girl's attention, thinks how lucky he is. Joshua will never admit it, but I can see it in his shiny eyes, in his half-lidded eyelids.\\n\\nBy smoking chokolate sigaretts at school, he not only saved his life, but also got an three-story house and savings for the future; no more oatmeal in the morning, no more screaming from a naughty little sister, no more restrictions. \\n\\nThe smell, I must say, is unapproachable. Everything was confused: tears, laughter, hysteria, calmness. And I have a lot of such cans. But - the strangest deal - no one likes them.\\n\\n“Ugh, how it stinks! And do you like it?\\\" Immediately it becomes so insulting for me that I really am doing something shameful. Then I go to the bathroom, filling up with water 37—39 °С, pinching my knees under me and trying to cry, trying my best, but I can't.\\n\\nDamn, I like these gases. What can I do with it? Each of these flasks is gold that I found somewhere, laundered and preserved so that one day I could plunge into another life: no literary dialogues, no paper decorations, no rented costumes.\\n\\nPeople do not like real smells, they like perfume; I prefer to listen to people, not their shoplists. For example, the woman in the coat that I put together last Sunday. Maybe there is little pleasant there, but, as we say, natural. \\n\\nThe sweet lady had her crotch combed, and she was in public, and even in line. And here she is, spinning, spinning, scratching herself, and I smell it and open the lid.\\n\\nNoticing that all the women, except for her to flaunt fur coats, I find one of the possible reasons for the fierce itching, but in a jar it will not fall, because even impurity. Course you can blame a woman for not taking good care of hygiene, or for wanting a fur coat, which are not obtained in the most humane way, but all this is not my business. I gather the main gas from the bowel and close the lid. And the smell of each recognized in their own way.\\n\\nHowever, I admit that most people therefore do not like gases, because they are very similar to their own. But I’m not saying that it should be liked, I’m saying that it must exist because it already exists, and if so, then there is no less sense in this than in sublimated stories that are drowning in praise. The truth is that the more truthful the story is, the more disgusting it is for everyone. People like stories that only pretend to be real.\\n\\n“Look how you made it up! Well done! How smart, decent we are here, and what a pleasant smell.\\\" But as they see something really real, it immediately \\\"stinks\\\".\",\"timestamp\":1641590110,\"title\":\"Gas collector, mocumentari\"},\"digest\":\"DQNl8D4r5uVVDMXPzpCrrWAS-tii379-q8Ovm7mhMKI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xe943BDF6385F3C5cf330364FF4C0a185cb46fff4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jdMsJmXEWgKz2R0E0ghi4VJ3zLPf59uUwfvR8L2XsRM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZuXLsWpC1_UFvJh9Jwtsqs9W2HHzJRFWG6Olp3hoJ88\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"BVYxOZlbcOTgn8I3L07ffxQodj3bpt0R-4_JZ_2uR5-7WSMd4-_j5U1KcFL80fT1BMPEiO-F8tFjee-INWur7g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe3278c1b0dbe3c07a53db1480feb4e08d8aaafbce58884bb2fb998201d67225c159a60d8167d70e832661d9b17177576ab3877d8b1c79bcaecc38a61c8d2bae21c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jdMsJmXEWgKz2R0E0ghi4VJ3zLPf59uUwfvR8L2XsRM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZuXLsWpC1_UFvJh9Jwtsqs9W2HHzJRFWG6Olp3hoJ88\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jfL012HaqsKV4oUgxxwQEdolaAtCN5hZiTHcQ49wbSI\"}"
