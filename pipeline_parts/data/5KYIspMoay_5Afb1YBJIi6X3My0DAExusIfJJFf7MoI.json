I do the exchange so that I have bolivares in my bank account and can pay for everything at the supermarket. But I also know that I can take my bolivares, turn them into Reserve dollars, and then into USDT.”\\n\\nMost customers use it to save their money. If they get paid in their local currency, they do not have to worry about its devaluation if it is in U.S. dollars. And if they need to buy something in a local currency, as Antunez described, they can always convert it back or pay directly with the RSV stablecoin if the merchant accepts it. Most don’t even realize that it has to do with cryptocurrency, like Stephany.\\n\\n“The Venezuelan bolivar loses value so fast that if you have bolivares, you need to change it as soon as you can to protect them,” she explained, adding the example that if she’s in Colombia and her father is in Venezuela, but “I needed to pay for his things, then instead of only exchanging what I needed at the supermarket, I was always looking for someone to buy extra dollars from me. So, I convinced the people from the supermarket and the pharmacy I use to download Reserve.”\\n\\n***Related: [Venezuelan international airport to accept Bitcoin payments: Report](https://cointelegraph.com/news/venezuelan-international-airport-to-accept-bitcoin-payments-report)***\\n\\nThe government [introduced](https://apnews.com/article/business-venezuela-caribbean-inflation-41edcf6e4a4c5010188a2921db642c39) a re-denomination of the currency in October, the third one since 2008, in order to ease computations. The economy, however, had already been increasingly unofficially dollarized. This means that prices in stores are marked in dollars, corresponding to the black market rate rather than the official exchange rate, as more and more merchants use PayPal, Zelle or, now, Reserve. With Reserve, users can exchange currencies at rates closer to those of the central bank.\",\"timestamp\":1639120265,\"title\":\"I have my Reserve dollars saved in the app. Sup\"},\"digest\":\"Ky2M9hXDKnCy8Oz4oXgacDpUMgL4lx_C3OSK3Df-Zmc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x84BBd884B158351c7c9F5F3EF066CB5d07BDD4f7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PU-Mgz-FZROYptIUYHBXmRMJmn7xqMa68dClD0uMHEs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"geWq8qwgQZ5ZKqPpZWzmwkkADaVyIVCeX9dTEpo_5Yw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Yp9MDPcW9ww36ZvUcS2hvyAzPlLuc_84HuNRTq0pP_UisscziR_SZph09zey_s5l9tl3eRsHVPtkgPid_gUsrg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x94a3a6104c34599945e3d7007693ed17b68e480fbc059405bfaa4f0c2dc1d29a0d688e82079f287f92253f3e4b40023aa241a1f5735571847e138f6061ecc3fb1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PU-Mgz-FZROYptIUYHBXmRMJmn7xqMa68dClD0uMHEs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"geWq8qwgQZ5ZKqPpZWzmwkkADaVyIVCeX9dTEpo_5Yw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Ky2M9hXDKnCy8Oz4oXgacDpUMgL4lx_C3OSK3Df-Zmc\"}"
