"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"I don't think they can last long because they are struggling.\\\"\\nFacing the last two blockbusters on earth, one in the United States and the other in Australia, Lynn, the owner of the Australian branch, reluctantly sighed at the beginning.\\nAfter years of hard struggle, blockbuster Australia has finally announced that it will completely close down at the end of this (March) month and end its 10-year operation.\\nThis means that blockbuster, located in Oregon, will be the last survivor on earth.\\nAnd this last one may not last long.\\nNo one expected that in its heyday, the film and television leasing giant, which had more than 9000 branches at home and abroad, stopped its efforts in just a few years and retreated to the last store in the United States, almost in a state of \\\"extinction\\\".\\nLooking back on the past, it is a sigh.\\nBlockbuster\\nFounded in 1985, blockbuster's first store is located in Texas.\\nAt that time, the Internet had not risen, and watching movies was not easy. People could only wait for the irregular broadcast of TV channels, or go to a few cinemas, with limited choices.\\nBlockbuster has made countless people refreshing by means of film rental.\\nWith strong bargaining power and crazy offline chain store layout, blockbuster quickly became the world's largest film rental company, mastered huge film resources, and even extended to video game rental for a time.\\nIf you want to see the latest film, the best choice is to rent it from blockbuster.\\nIn its heyday, blockbuster expanded at an amazing speed, opening a new store every 17 hours, all in the area with the highest passenger flow, with a total of more than 9000 stores and more than 84000 employees.\\nBlockbuster claims that 70% of people in the United States can find a blockbuster store as long as they drive for ten minutes.\\nBlockbuster is as deeply rooted in the hearts of countless consumers as Nokia is in mobile phones.\\nIt is even powerful enough to deceive customers.\\nBlockbuster has a rule that if consumers can't return the DVD within the agreed time, they must pay an \\\"overdue fee\\\".\\nOverdue fees alone account for 10% of blockbuster's total revenue. At most, they even reach US $800 million, accounting for 16% of total revenue.\\nAlthough consumers complain, many films are the only one and have to choose.\\nIts strength is staggering.\\nCompetitors kneel down for acquisition\\nWhere there is oppression, there is resistance, where there is interest, there are adventurers.\\nSeeing blockbuster's \\\"overdue fee\\\" dispute growing.\\nIn 1997, Netflix was founded. Its founder skillfully made up a story, claiming that he was angry and started a business because blockbuster forced him to charge a $40 overdue fee.\\nI will not charge overdue fee, order dishes online and send them by express mail.\\nThis move quickly aroused widespread resonance and started at one shot.\\nBut it's easy to make up stories, but it's not easy to challenge giants.\\nAlthough Netflix made a good start, Netflix began to fall into continuous losses. Its average order cost was as high as $6, which was completely unprofitable. Although it continued to optimize and reduce costs to $2 per order, it still couldn't make ends meet.\\nIn 1999, Netflix raised $100 million and lost $30 million that year.\\nIn 2000, the loss of Netflix expanded to 57 million 400 thousand US dollars, almost facing the risk of capital chain breaking and collapse. The number of users exceeded 120 thousand, Netflix wanted to go public, but it coincided with the collapse of the Internet technology bubble.\\nIn desperation, the founder of Netflix had to put down all his dignity and turn to blockbuster for help. He hoped that blockbuster could buy himself for $50 million, and he would be an ox and horse for blockbuster and take care of its online business.\\nHowever, in Blackstar's view, Netflix is not only too small. Compared with its 9000 stores, it is like an ant trying to shake a big tree. It is insignificant and worthless. What's more, it doesn't see the online rental market. It thinks it's just a small fight and it's difficult to become a climate.\\nNetflix had to continue to waver in difficulties. In order to survive, it even had to cut 40% of its staff.\\nHow would blockbuster feel if he knew that his insignificant and bankrupt opponent would not only surpass himself, but even kill himself in the future.\\nTransformation, one step away\\nOn the third day of their separation, they should look at each other with new eyes.\\nIn 2003, Netflix came out of the haze after a difficult period, with more than one million subscribers, and finally began to attract the attention of blockbuster.\\nIn a survey of Netflix users, antioco, the then CEO of blockbuster, found that online film rental customer loyalty was very high. Blockbuster also needed online rental, so it invested $1 million to establish a small online DVD rental company.\\nAlthough the scale is small and the investment is limited, it has finally begun.\\nThe new team copied Netflix directly.\\nIf we can integrate blockbuster's huge internal resources, film sources and customer base, it is not impossible for online business to soar and snipe the challenge of Netflix.\\nBut what's surprising is that at this time, blockbuster's internal quarrel broke out and firmly opposed blockbuster's entry into the online market.\\nNot only does the new team not be allowed to use blockbuster's internal resources, it is not even allowed to publicize \\\"no overdue fee\\\", because this means criticizing the stores for charging overdue fees, let alone cooperating with Internet companies such as Yahoo and Amazon.\\nEven with the strong support of the CEO, each store was required to set up a computer for customers to register online, which was refused by the store manager of each store.\\nSeeing that the battle of online transformation was about to fail, Netflix, which was under the pressure of loss, made a fatal mistake by raising the subscription price to $21.\\nAccording to Blackstar market research, the price ceiling acceptable to customers is no more than $20, and $21 is a wrong choice.\\nTaking this opportunity, blockbuster quickly announced that the online subscription price was no more than $20, and announced that the overdue fee was cancelled. At the same time, it made great publicity and even made a self blackened short film. In the short film, many consumers wept with joy when they heard that the overdue fee was cancelled.\\nA series of counterattacks stopped blockbuster's online decline, and users began to rise sharply.\\nNetflix was overwhelmed by pricing errors.\\nHowever, this move was unanimously opposed by many people within blockbuster, especially franchisees, who strongly expressed that they would rob their members from the development line, and the cancellation of overdue fees would reduce their income.\\nA verbal battle broke out between the two sides, which made blockbuster have to make a compromise and charge no overdue fee, but \\\"re launch fee\\\".\\nOne stone aroused thousands of waves. As soon as the news came out, it triggered fierce opposition from consumers.\\nBlockbuster made a solid public fool of countless consumers.\\nFor a time, consumers were disappointed, and blockbuster's share price fell sharply.\\nNetflix took advantage of the rise and quickly turned defeat into victory.\\nIt's over\\nA hundred footed insects die without stiffness.\\nA huge family is difficult to defeat from the outside. It must commit suicide from the inside in order to be completely defeated.\\nIn 2005, Naifei subscribers soared all the way, reaching an amazing 4.2 million people. The market situation was very good. The market value even exceeded blockbuster and became a new king.\\nHowever, blockbuster online has just exceeded 1 million subscribers.\\nIn the face of the rapid progress of competitors, blockbuster finally made up its mind to fight a war, reached an agreement from the top, and let the CEO go to reform.\\nAntioco quickly reduced its store business, slashed staff, made every effort to turn online, and completely eliminated overdue fees.\\nIn 2006, blockbuster finally opened up online and offline and withdrew from the omni-directional film rental scheme. Customers can choose online and offline freely.\\nWith powerful film and television resources, blockbuster's new deal has been a great success. In just over 40 days, more than 700000 new subscribers have been added, exceeding the total in the past few years.\\nThe growth rate of Netflix users, which had been advancing by leaps and bounds, fell by 17% year-on-year in 2007. The market expects that the new users of Netflix in the second quarter will be close to 0.5%\\nNetflix panicked and tried to settle with blockbuster. It wanted to buy blockbuster's online users at a sky high price of $200 per user, a total of $600 million.\\nBlockbuster is not stupid. Naturally, it won't.\\nSeeing that the situation was about to reverse, Netflix was terrified, blockbuster had a good prospect, but everything suddenly stopped.\\nAntioco, blockbuster's meritorious CEO, was dismissed.\\nOriginally, Antioch's reform has greatly improved blockbuster's performance, greatly increased the number of customers and perfectly completed online tasks. He hopes to get a bonus of $7.6 million.\\nBut the board thought it was too much and only offered 5.6 million.\\nEventually, blockbuster dismissed antioco and appointed a new CEO, who was replaced by Keith, the former CEO of 7-11.\\nIt's over.\\nAfter taking over, Keith's foundation was unstable. In order to please the Conservatives, he began to focus on the declining stores, and even positioned the stores as \\\"entertainment centers\\\". He believed that the stores were places to contact customers, and must not be reduced, and reduce the large amount of online funds invested due to competition with Netflix.\\nAs a result, blockbuster's online business gave up halfway, and half of its users lost in only half a year.\\nNetflix took off and could no longer be stopped. In 2009, users exceeded the 10 million mark, and in 2010, it exceeded the 20 million mark. The share price soared from $30 in 2009 to $53 at the end of the year, and it was as high as $175 / share in 2010.\\nBut blockbuster's death knell finally began to ring.\\nIn March 2010, blockbuster publicly announced bankruptcy warning and officially declared bankruptcy in September.\\nSo far, the king of film and television leasing has disappeared and fallen into the altar.\\nepilogue\\nTruth is often in the hands of a few people, and most people are just slaves to short-term interests.\\nWhether it is the uproar over brexit in the UK, the continuous riots in France, or blockbuster's shareholders and shopkeepers.\\nThey are not much smarter than ordinary people.\\nThey only have their own interests in their eyes. For them, the overall situation is not worth sacrificing their own interests.\\nBlockbuster fell into the gentle embrace of its own people rather than the wave of the times and the spear of competition. They were all thinking about their own interests. They knew that online was the future, but they refused to sacrifice their immediate interests, let alone cooperate with the company's strategy and move forward. Finally, everyone finished together.\\nIf blockbuster were not so arrogant, acquired nefi from the beginning and turned to online, it would still be a legend today.\\nIf he is not in the process of transformation and repeatedly misses good opportunities, it will still have the power of war today. It is a pity that arrogance has paid the price and stupidity has won the end, which is a sigh.\\nThe most sad thing in the world is not to die under the enemy's sword, nor in the narrowness of fate, but in your own stupidity.\\nNetflix has become a textbook model for ants to beat elephants in the business age.\\nBut if someone asked him how the ant knocked down the elephant, he would say that the best way is, of course, to let the elephant kill himself.\\nAs Sun Tzu's art of war said: better than the easy winner!\\n\\n(forward )\",\"timestamp\":1641198039,\"title\":\"The end of an era!
