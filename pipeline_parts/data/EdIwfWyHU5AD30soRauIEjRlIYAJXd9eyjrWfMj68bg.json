"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**The Project**\\n\\nThe collection was created for the GMX Community and we wanted to thank you all for your engagement and feedbacks to this initiative. What has been built since XVIX in terms of community and DeFi is just impressive. We are very proud and happy to be able to create this project linked to this whole ecosystem.\\n\\nGMX Blueberry Club is not just about NFT. Being part of this does not only give you access to a profile picture. Owning a GBC will give you many advantages in the future. We have huge ambitions for the long term and we hope that many of you will participate in this journey.\\n\\n**Launch, Treasury & Future**\\n\\nNFTs will be free for people who have Multiplier Points but the remaining ones will be sold in Public Sale. This means that many people will be able to join the Blueberry Club.\\n\\nPublic Sale funds will be used to create a GLP treasury which will provide benefits to the GMX platform and to the community.\\n\\nWhat is GLP? GLP consist of an index of assets used for swap and leverage transactions on [GMX.io](http://gmx.io/). GLP token earn escrowed GMX rewards and 50% of platform fees distributed in ETH.\\n\\nMost of the treasury rewards will be compounded automatically, which means that the treasury grows exponentially over time + there will be taxes on every GBC transaction. These fees will be transferred directly to the GLP Treasury (Every time you sell a GBC, you enrich the treasury, the community and the GMX platform).\\n\\nWhat will this treasury be used for? It will be up to the community to decide.\\nWe already have many ideas to propose\\n\\n* Creation of a decentralized marketplace for GBCs\\n* Entering the Metaverse\\n* Events\\n* NFT Utility linked with GMX\\n* Rewards\\n* Collaborations\\n\\nThe GMX ecosystem that X and his team have created offers a lot of possibilities and we are very confident about the future of the Blueberry Club.\\n\\nMore information on the launch date is coming in the next few days, we aim to release the collection in early December.\\n\\nHyped?
