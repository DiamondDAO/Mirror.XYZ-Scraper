"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"It is a lovely night for the Signore. I could take the Signore to Sorrento or to Capri to-night.\\\"\\n\\nHe held Artois by the right arm, gently assisting him into the broad- bottomed boat.\\n\\n\\\"I only want to go to Naples.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To which landing, Signore?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Vittoria. But go quietly and keep near the shore. Go round as near as you can to the Mergellina.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Va bene, Signore.\\\"\\n\\nThey slipped out, with a delicious, liquid sound, upon the moving silence of the sea.\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX\\n\\nHermione was not going to Mergellina, but to the Scoglio di Frisio. She had only come out of her room late in the afternoon. During her seclusion there she had once been disturbed by Gaspare, who had come to ask her if she wanted him for anything, and, if not, whether he might go over to Mergellina for the rest of the afternoon to see some friends he had made there. She told him he was free till night, and he went away quickly, after one searching, wide-eyed glance at the face of his Padrona.\\n\\nWhen he had gone Hermione told herself that she was glad he was away. If he had been on the island she might have been tempted to take one of the boats, to ask him to row her to the Scoglio that evening. But now, of course, she would not go. It was true that she could easily get a boatman from the village on the mainland near by, but without Gaspare's companionship she would not care to go. So that was settled. She would think no more about it. She had tea with Vere, and strove with all her might to be natural, to show no traces in face or manner of the storm that had swept over her that day. She hoped, she believed that she was successful. But what a hateful, what an unnatural effort that was!\\n\\nA woman who is not at her ease in her own home with her own girl-- where can she be at ease?\\n\\nIt was really the reaction from that effort that sent Hermione from the island that evening. She felt as if she could not face another meal with Vere just then. She felt transparent, as if Vere's eyes would be able to see all that she must hide if they were together in the evening. And she resolved to go away. She made some excuse--that she wished for a little change, that she was fidgety and felt the confinement of the island.\\n\\n\\\"I think I'll go over to the village,\\\" she said; \\\"and walk up to the road and take the tram.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Will you, Madre?\\\"\\n\\nHermione saw in Vere's eyes that the girl was waiting for something.\\n\\n\\\"I'll go by myself, Vere,\\\" she said. \\\"I should be bad company to-day. The black dog is at my heels.\\\"\\n\\nShe laughed, and added:\\n\\n\\\"If I am late in coming back, have dinner without me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well, Madre.\\\"\\n\\nVere waited a moment; then as if desiring to break forcibly through the restraint that bound them put out her hand to her mother's and said:\\n\\n\\\"Why don't you go to Naples and have dinner with Monsieur Emile? He would cheer you up, and it is ages since we have seen him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Only two or three days. No, I won't disturb Emile. He may be working.\\\"\\n\\nVere felt that somehow her eager suggestion had deepened the constraint. She said no more, and Hermione presently crossed over to the mainland and began her walk to the road that leads from Naples to Bagnoli.\\n\\nWhere was she going? What was she really about to do?\\n\\nCertainly she would not adopt the suggestion of Vere. Emile was the last person whom she wished to see--by whom she wished to be seen-- just then.\\n\\nThe narrow path turned away from the sea into the shadow of high banks. She walked very slowly, like one out for a desultory stroll; a lizard slipped across the warm earth in front of her, almost touching her foot, climbed the bank swiftly, and vanished among the dry leaves with a faint rustle.\\n\\nShe felt quite alone to-day in Italy, and far off, as if she had no duties, no ties, as if she were one of those solitary, drifting, middle-aged women who vaguely haunt the beaten tracks of foreign lands. It was sultry in this path away from the sea. She was sharply conscious of the change of climate, the inland sensation, the falling away of the freedom from her, the freedom that seems to exhale from wave and wind of the wave.\\n\\nShe walked on, meeting no one and still undecided what to do. The thought of the Scoglio di Frisio returned to her mind, was dismissed, returned again. She might go and dine there quietly alone. Was she deceiving herself, and had she really made up her mind to go to the Scoglio before she left the island? No, she had come away mainly because she felt the need of solitude, the difficulty of being with Vere just for this one night. To-morrow it would be different. It should be different to-morrow.\\n\\nShe saw a row of houses in the distance, houses of poor people, and knew that she was nearing the road. Clothes were hanging to dry. Children were playing at the edge of a vineyard. Women were washing linen, men sitting on the doorsteps mending /nasse/. As she went by she nodded to them, and bade them \\\"Buona sera.\\\" They answered courteously, some with smiling faces, others with grave and searching looks--or so she thought.\\n\\nThe tunnel that runs beneath the road at the point where this path joins it came in sight. And still Hermione did not know what she was going to do. As she entered the tunnel she heard above her head the rumble of a tram going towards Naples. This decided her. She hurried on, turned to the right, and came out on the highway before the little lonely ristorante that is set here to command the view of vineyards and of sea.\\n\\nThe tram was already gliding away at some distance down the road.\\n\\nA solitary waiter came forward in his unsuitable black into the dust to sympathize with the Signora, and to suggest that she should take a seat and drink some lemon water, or gazzosa, while waiting for the next tram. Or would not the Signora dine in the upper room and watch the /tramontare del sole/. It would be splendid this evening. And he could promise her an excellent risotto, sardines with pomidoro, and a bifteck such as certainly she could not get in the restaurants of Naples.\\n\\n\\\"Very well,\\\" Hermione answered, quickly, \\\"I will dine here, but not directly--in half an hour or three-quarters.\\\"\\n\\nWhat Artois was doing at the Ristorante della Stella she was doing at the Trattoria del Giardinetto.\\n\\nShe would dine quietly here, and then walk back to the sea in the cool of the evening.\\n\\nThat was her decision. Yet when evening fell, and her bill was paid, she took the tram that was going down to Naples, and passed presently before the eyes of Artois. The coming of darkness had revived within her much of the mood of the afternoon. She felt that she could not go home without doing something definite, and she resolved to go to the Scoglio di Frisio, have a cup of coffee there, look through the visitors' book, and then take a boat and return by night to the island. The sea wind would cool her, would do her good.\\n\\nNothing told her when the eyes of her friend were for an instant fixed upon her, when the mind of her friend for a moment wondered at the strange, new look in her face. She left the tram presently at the doorway above which is Frisio's name, descended to the little terrace from which Vere had run in laughing with the Marchesino, and stood there for a moment hesitating.\\n\\nThe long restaurant was lit up, and from it came the sound of music-- guitars, and a voice singing. She recognized the throaty tenor of the blind man raised in a spurious and sickly rapture:\\n\\n\\\"Sa-anta-a Lu-u-ci-ia! Santa Luci--a!\\\"\\n\\nIt recalled her sharply to the night of the storm. For a moment she felt again the strange, the unreasonable sense of fear, indefinable but harsh, which had come upon her then, as fear comes suddenly sometimes upon a child.\\n\\nThen she stepped into the restaurant.\\n\\nAs on the other night, there were but few people dining there, and they were away at the far end of the big room. Near them stood the musicians under a light--seedy, depressed; except the blind man, who lifted his big head, rolled his tongue, and swelled and grew scarlet in an effort to be impressive.\\n\\nHermione sat down at the first table.\\n\\nFor a moment no one saw her. She heard men's voices talking loudly and gayly, the clatter of plates, the clink of knives and forks. She looked round for the visitors' book. If it were lying near she thought she would open it, search for what Emile had written, and then slip away at once unobserved.\\n\\nThere was a furtive spirit within her to-night.\\n\\nBut she could not see the book; so she sat still, listening to the blind man and gazing at the calm sea just below her. A boat was waiting there. She could see the cushions, which were white and looked ghastly in the darkness, the dim form of the rower standing up to search for clients.\\n\\n\\\"Barca! Barca!\\\"\\n\\nHe had seen her.\\n\\nShe drew back a little. As she did so her chair made a grating noise, and instantly the sharp ears of the Padrone caught a sound betokening the presence of a new-comer in his restaurant. It might be a queen, an empress! Who could tell?\\n\\nWith his stiff yet alert military gait, he at once came marching down towards her, staring hard with his big, bright eyes. When he saw who it was he threw up his brown hands.\\n\\n\\\"The Signora of the storm!\\\" he exclaimed. He moved as if about to turn around. \\\"I must tell--\\\"\\n\\nBut Hermione stopped him with a quick, decisive gesture.\\n\\n\\\"One moment, Signore.\\\"\\n\\nThe Padrone approached aristocratically.\\n\\n\\\"The Marchese Isidoro Panacci is here dining with friends, the Duca di--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, yes. But I am only here for a moment, so it is not worth while to tell the Marchese.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are not going to dine, Signora! The food of Frisio does not please you!\\\"\\n\\nHe cast up his eyes in deep distress.\\n\\n\\\"Indeed it does. But I have dined. What I want is a cup of coffee, and --and a liqueur--une fine. And may I look over your wonderful visitors' book? To tell the truth, that is what I have come for, to see the marvellous book. I hadn't enough time the other night. May I?\\\"\\n\\nThe Padrone was appeased. He smiled graciously and turned upon his heels.\\n\\n\\\"At once, Signora.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And--not a word to the Marchese! He is with friends. I would rather not disturb him.\\\"\\n\\nThe Padrone threw up his chin and clicked his tongue against his teeth. A shrewd, though not at all impudent, expression had come into his face. A Signora alone, at night, in a restaurant! He was a man of the great world. He understood. What a mercy it was to be \\\"educato\\\"!\\n\\nHe came back again almost directly, bearing the book as a sacristan might bear a black-letter Bible.\\n\\n\\\"Ecco, Signora.\\\"\\n\\nWith a superb gesture he placed it before her.\\n\\n\\\"The coffee, the fine. Attendez, Signora, pour un petit momento.\\\"\\n\\nHe stood to see the effect of his French upon her. She forced into her face a look of pious admiration, and he at once departed. Hermione opened the book rather furtively. She had the unpleasant sensation of doing a surreptitious action, and she was an almost abnormally straightforward woman by nature. The book was large, and contained an immense number of inscriptions and signatures in handwritings that varied as strangely as do the characters of men. She turned the leaves hastily. Where had Emile written? Not at the end of the book. She remembered that his signature had been followed by others, although she had not seen, or tried to see, what he had written. Perhaps his name was near Tolstoy's. They had read together Tolstoy's /Vedi Napoli e poi Mori/.\\n\\nBut where was Tolstoy's name?\\n\\nA waiter came with the coffee and the brandy. She thanked him quickly, sipped the coffee without tasting it, and continued the search.\\n\\nThe voice of the blind man died away. The guitars ceased.\\n\\nShe started. She was afraid the musicians would come down and gather round her. Why had she not told the Padrone she wished to be quite alone? She heard the shuffle of feet. They were coming. Feverishly she turned the pages. Ah! here is was! She bent down over the page.\\n\\n\\\"La conscience, c'est la quantite de science innee que nous avons    en nous.
