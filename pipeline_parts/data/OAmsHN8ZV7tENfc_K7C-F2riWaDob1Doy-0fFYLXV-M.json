"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Much of our public comes to us from language schools, hostels, universities, cultural centres and all kinds of organisations. Individuals come and go via word-of-mouth, but Associates ensure a steady stream of regular attendance. Visiting and actively building in-real-life relationships with these organisations is your best marketing strategy.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2AGMubsOfQbC0wn9bUGdV.png?height=389&width=1041)\\n\\nThis is part of the ‚Äò**Get Started**‚Äô series in the [EOM](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/QhvLl3HKyYJ2Z1TVX-rwDjVhwLhwX-QNyRHawRUYZFE)\\n\\nüü° Find a Venue \\n üü° Order Flags \\n üü° Assemble a Team \\n üü° Speech \\n üü° First Date \\n üü† Outreach \\n üü° Go, Go, Go! \\n üü° Launch Day\\n\\n## Your City Map\\n\\nYou will be provided you with a City Map (please don‚Äôt create it yourself). \\n \\n\\n### Traffic Light System\\n\\nAs you find language schools and other organisations, add them to the map. Check reviews, photos, social media and mark each one down on your City Map as üü† Amber.\\n\\nüî¥ Red ‚Äì Reject\\n\\nüü† Amber ‚Äì Unvisited or unconfirmed\\n\\nüü¢ Green ‚Äì Visited and not rejected\\n\\n![Click the little pencil icon to add notes](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ohf4Erk_gXKLwsBreCehV.png?height=838&width=1865)\\n\\n## Research your Associates\\n\\n### Search in the map.\\n\\nPut yourself in the place of a foreigner and think what services they would look for in your city. The following search terms are great examples but try your own terms and combinations \\n  \\n `[Chinese/Spanish/German.etc]` **language school** \\n `[Chinese/Spanish/German.etc]` **cultural centre** \\n `[Chinese/Spanish/German.etc]` **embassy** \\n **‚ÄòLanguage cafe‚Äô \\n ‚ÄòStudent accommodation' \\n ‚ÄòHostel‚Äô, ‚ÄòHotel‚Äô**\\n\\n### Ask People\\n\\nAsk your foreign friends which language schools, institutions, schools or universities they‚Äôve heard about or attended to.\\n\\n## Plan Your Visits\\n\\n### Bring Moral Support\\n\\nYou don‚Äôt have to, but if you‚Äôre nervous it will help you shake off the jitters especially on your first visits. It also gives legitimacy to your pitch if you appear to be part of a team rather than a sole person.\\n\\n### Rock Up \\n\\nVisit the school in person unannounced. They‚Äôre not going to bite and it‚Äôs quite normal. Knock on the door, ring the bell, and ask to speak with the person in charge of **extra-curricular activities**, or the ‚Äò**Activity Calendar**‚Äô, so you can leave some posters and cards.\\n\\n### Repeat\\n\\nDon‚Äôt stop. Go back again 6 to 8 weeks later. Visit potential associates regularly and kindly greet all staff from the receptionist to the one in charge of the extracurricular activities.\\n\\n## Social Skills\\n\\n### Basics\\n\\n* Warm Smile and a straight back.\\n* Eye Contact\\n* Shake Hands\\n* Ask their name, offer yours.\\n* Sit if invited, stand when they stand.\\n* Talk about them first, about yourself later\\n* Let them speak uninterrupted. \\n \\n\\n### Make Friends \\n\\n* Be sweet to the receptionists, they‚Äôre your gateway to the school.\\n* However, don‚Äôt leave your posters with a receptionist, try to reach the person in charge of the **Activities Calendar**.\\n* Show interest in their organisation. Ask about its history and future aspirations.\\n* Don‚Äôt only talk work, engage their personal interests, take an interest in them as fellow human being and make it personal.\\n\\n### Make Allies \\n\\nWe love talking about ourselves, that‚Äôs a fact. We like people who make us feel important through telling our own story. If you show interest in your Associates and their organisations on a personal level and they will enjoy the conversation much more than if you just talk about Mundo Lingo. Feeling that the relationship is more personal, they will more likely support you personally.\\n\\n### Let them speak uninterrupted \\n\\nIf you know you sometimes interrupt people mid-sentence, try to be aware of it during this meeting. If you let other person speak non-stop for as long as they like, they will love you for it. During those moments of silence, as they desperately scramble to find silence-filling things to say, is when they‚Äôre more likely to offer to support.\\n\\n## The circle of (PR) life\\n\\nBuilding a friendship step by step:\\n\\n1. Courtesy Email\\n2. Visit next day\\n3. Use your Social skills (See above)\\n4. Explain the format and vibe of our event.\\n5. Leave flyers and cards.\\n6. Offer free drinks vouchers for teachers/organisers (optional).\\n7. If the organisers come to ML, get them a drink (optional).\\n8. Ask them if they would add us to their social calendar.\\n9. Repeat visit them. If they send you students, give them a small gift as a token of appreciation: Chocolates, wine, whatever you feel is appropriate (optional).\\n\\n## Sponsorship and cross promotion\\n\\nIncorporated in the Mundo Lingo philosophy is a zero-tolerance approach to advertising, sponsorships or any form of cross promotion.\\n\\nPlease refer to the guide ‚ÄúThe Mundo Lingo Philosophy‚Äù for further information **\\\\[Link Needed\\\\]**\\n\\n## Now what?\\n\\nNext up, it‚Äôs time to learn **Go, Go, Go! \\\\[link needed\\\\]**\\n\\n### Or Go Back\\n\\nüëà [Events Operations Manual](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/QhvLl3HKyYJ2Z1TVX-rwDjVhwLhwX-QNyRHawRUYZFE) \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1640148974,\"title\":\"EOM | Associates\"},\"digest\":\"y4LnW-8xgDzY6-9GgvAcA14DBFwT8zvyPzKI8KvSFto\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"34suyCfnLUoFM02SOhmJJJ9iXgiiL5kC6iPH6Fv3LXk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"jtVAiplEVAd0RPMj7L2P0umm9wTPdvk-kh1vAJTvwJc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"iWU3i-eQ4Heb7BdXx_38Dk11C0IEG-rJfXEQIHmHQ_uNSlO59VQRalE-LxPHTh9a1CGf03r1DGHdl_Gwb2qxRg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x57d0f7cbea22222afabed23e09ac819f759269ea4cca2a83cdd992ddf3ffe88d22a7afd325b70c3c1ae7dee6f5fc8e22188ba69c589cf1f0528e258261121ae51b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"34suyCfnLUoFM02SOhmJJJ9iXgiiL5kC6iPH6Fv3LXk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"jtVAiplEVAd0RPMj7L2P0umm9wTPdvk-kh1vAJTvwJc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"y4LnW-8xgDzY6-9GgvAcA14DBFwT8zvyPzKI8KvSFto\"}"
