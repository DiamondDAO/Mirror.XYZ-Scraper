"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The extreme dryness of the preceding summer has been noticed.  It had operated so far in the beginning of June that we dreaded a want of water for common consumption most of the little reservoirs in the neighbourhood of Sydney being dried up.  The small stream near the town was so nearly exhausted (being only the drain of a morass) that a ship could not have watered at it, and the 'Supply' was preparing to sink casks in a swamp when rain fell and banished our apprehensions.\\n\\nJune, 1791.  On the second instant, the name of the settlement, at the head of the harbour (Rose Hill) was changed, by order of the governor, to that of Parramatta, the native name of it.  As Rose Hill has, however, occurred so often in this book, I beg leave, to avoid confusion, still to continue the appellation in all future mention of it.\\n\\nOur travelling friend Boladeree, who makes so conspicuous a figure in the last chapter, about this time committed an offence which we were obliged to notice.  He threw a spear at a convict in the woods, and wounded him.  The truth was, some mischievous person belonging to us had wantonly destroyed his canoe, and he revenged the injury on the first of our people whom he met unarmed.  He now seemed to think the matter adjusted; and probably such is the custom they observe in their own society in similar cases.  Hearing, however, that an order was issued to seize him, or in case that could not be effected, to shoot him, he prudently dropped all connection with us and was for a long time not seen.\\n\\nBut if they sometimes injured us, to compensate they were often of signal benefit to those who needed their assistance:  two instances of which had recently occurred.  A boat was overset in the harbour Baneelon and some other natives, who saw the accident happen, immediately plunged in, and saved all the people.  When they had brought them on shore, they undressed them, kindled a fire and dried their clothes, gave them fish to eat and conducted them to Sydney.\\n\\nThe other instance was of a soldier lost in the woods, when he met a party of natives.  He at first knew not whether to flee from them, or to implore their assistance.  Seeing among them one whom he knew, he determined to communicate his distress to him and to rely on his generosity. The Indian told him that he had wandered a long way from home, but that he would conduct him thither, on the single condition of his delivering up a gun which he held in his hand, promising to carry it for him and to restore it to him at parting.  The soldier felt little inclination to surrender his arms, by which he would be put entirely in their power. But seeing no alternative, he at last consented; on which the whole party laid down their spears and faithfully escorted him to the nearest part of the settlement, where the gun was given up, and they took their leave without asking for any remuneration, or even seeming to expect it.\\n\\nThe distressful state of the colony for provisions continued gradually to augment until the 9th of July, when the Mary Anne transport arrived from England.  This ship had sailed from the Downs so lately as the 25th of February, having been only four months and twelve days on her passage.  She brought out convicts, by contract, at a specific sum for each person.  But to demonstrate the effect of humanity and justice, of 144 female convicts embarked on board only three had died, and the rest were landed in perfect health, all loud in praise of their conductor. The master's name was Munro; and his ship, after fulfilling her engagement with government, was bound on the southern fishery.  The reader must not conclude that I sacrifice to dull detail, when he finds such benevolent conduct minutely narrated.  The advocates of humanity are not yet become too numerous:  but those who practise its divine precepts, however humble and unnoticed be their station, ought not to sink into obscurity, unrecorded and unpraised, with the vile monsters who deride misery and fatten on calamity.\\n\\nJuly, 1791.  If, however, the good people of this ship delighted us with their benevolence, here gratification ended.  I was of a party who had rowed in a boat six miles out to sea, beyond the harbour's mouth, to meet them; and what was our disappointment, on getting aboard, to find that they had not brought a letter (a few official ones for the governor excepted) to any person in the colony!  Nor had they a single newspaper or magazine in their possession; nor could they conceive that any person wished to hear news; being as ignorant of everything which had passed in Europe for the last two years as ourselves, at the distance of half the circle.  \\\"No war--the fleet's dismantled,\\\" was the whole that we could learn.  When I asked whether a new parliament had been called, they stared at me in stupid wonder, not seeming to comprehend that such a body either suffered renovation or needed it.\\n\\n\\\"Have the French settled their government?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As to that matter I can't say; I never heard; but, damn them, they were ready enough to join the Spaniards against us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are Russia and Turkey at peace?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That you see does not lie in my way; I have heard talk about it, but don't remember what passed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For heaven's sake, why did you not bring out a bundle of newspapers? You might have procured a file at any coffee house, which would have amused you, and instructed us?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, really, I never thought about the matter until we were off the Cape of Good Hope, when we spoke a man of war, who asked us the same question, and then I wished I had.\\\"\\n\\nTo have prosecuted inquiry farther would have only served to increase disappointment and chagrin.  We therefore quitted the ship, wondering and lamenting that so large a portion of plain undisguised honesty should be so totally unconnected with a common share of intelligence, and acquaintance with the feelings and habits of other men.\\n\\nBy the governor's letters we learned that a large fleet of transports, with convicts on board, and His Majesty's ship Gorgon, (Captain Parker) might soon be expected to arrive.  The following intelligence which they contained, was also made public.\\n\\nThat such convicts as had served their period of transportation, were not to be compelled to remain in the colony; but that no temptation should be offered to induce them to quit it, as there existed but too much reason to believe, that they would return to former practices; that those who might choose to settle in the country should have portions of land, subject to stipulated restrictions, and a portion of provisions assigned to them on signifying their inclinations; and that it was expected, that those convicts who might be possessed of means to transport themselves from the country, would leave it free of all incumbrances of a public nature.\\n\\nThe rest of the fleet continued to drop in, in this and the two succeeding months.  The state of the convicts whom they brought out, though infinitely preferable to what the fleet of last year had landed, was not unexceptionable.  Three of the ships had naval agents on board to control them.  Consequently, if complaint had existed there, it would have been immediately redressed.  Exclusive of these, the 'Salamander', (Captain Nichols) who, of 155 men lost only five; and the 'William and Anne' (Captain Buncker) who of 187 men lost only seven, I find most worthy of honourable mention.  In the list of convicts brought out was Barrington, of famous memory.\\n\\nTwo of these ships also added to our geographic knowledge of the country. The 'Atlantic', under the direction of Lieutenant Bowen, a naval agent, ran into a harbour between Van Diemen's land, and Port Jackson, in latitude 35 degrees 12 minutes south, longitude 151 degrees east, to which, in honour of Sir John Jervis, Knight of the Bath, Mr. Bowen gave the name of Port Jervis.  Here was found good anchoring ground with a fine depth of water, within a harbour about a mile and a quarter broad at its entrance, which afterwards opens into a basin five miles wide and of considerable length.  They found no fresh water, but as their want of this article was not urgent, they did not make sufficient researches to pronounce that none existed there.\\\\*  They saw, during the short time they stayed, two kangaroos and many traces of inhabitants.  The country at a little distance to the southward of the harbour is hilly, but that contiguous to the sea is flat.  On comparing what they had found here afterwards, with the native produce of Port Jackson, they saw no reason to think that they differed in any respect.\\n\\n\\\\[\\\\*Just before I left the country, word was brought by a ship which had put into Port Jervis, that a large fresh water brook was found there.\\\\]\\n\\nThe second discovery was made by Captain Wetherhead, of the 'Matilda' transport, which was obligingly described to me, as follows, by that gentleman, on my putting to him the underwritten questions.\\n\\n\\\"When did you make your discovery?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"On the 27th of July, 1791.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In what latitude and longitude does it lie?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In 42 degrees 15 minutes south by observation, and in 148 1/2 east by reckoning\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is it on the mainland or is it an island?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is an island, distant from the mainland about eight miles.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did you anchor?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes; and found good anchorage in a bay open about six points.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did you see any other harbour or bay in the island?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"None.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Does the channel between the island and the main appear to afford good shelter for shipping?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, like Spithead.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did you find any water on the island?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, in plenty.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of what size does the island appear to be?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is narrow and long; I cannot say how long.  Its breadth is inconsiderable.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did you make any observations on the soil?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is sandy; and many places are full of craggy rocks.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you judge the productions which you saw on the island to be similar to those around Port Jackson?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do not think they differ in any respect.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did you see any animals?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I saw three kangaroos.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did you see any natives, or any marks of them?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I saw no natives, but I saw a fire, and several huts like those at Port Jackson, in one of which lay a spear.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What name did you give to your discovery?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I called it, in honour of my ship, Matilda Bay.\\\"\\n\\nNovember, 1791.  A very extraordinary instance of folly stimulated to desperation occurred in the beginning of this month among the convicts at Rose Hill.  Twenty men and a pregnant woman, part of those who had arrived in the last fleet, suddenly disappeared with their clothes, working tools, bedding, and their provisions, for the ensuing week, which had been just issued to them.  The first intelligence heard of them, was from some convict settlers, who said they had seen them pass, and had enquired whither they were bound.  To which they had received for answer, \\\"to China.\\\" The extravagance and infatuation of such an attempt was explained to them by the settlers; but neither derision, nor demonstration could avert them from pursuing their purpose.  It was observed by those who brought in the account that they had general idea enough of the point of the compass in which China lies from Port Jackson, to keep in a northerly direction.\\n\\nAn officer with a detachment of troops, was sent in pursuit of them; but after a harassing march returned without success.  In the course of a week the greatest part of them were either brought back by different parties who had fallen in with them, or were driven in by famine. Upon being questioned about the cause of their elopement, those whom hunger had forced back, did not hesitate to confess that they had been so grossly deceived as to believe that China might easily be reached, being not more than 100 miles distant, and separated only by a river. The others, however, ashamed of the merriment excited at their expense, said that their reason for running away was on account of being overworked and harshly treated, and that they preferred a solitary and precarious existence in the woods to a return to the misery they were compelled to undergo.  One or two of the party had certainly perished by the hands of the natives, who had also wounded several others.\\n\\nI trust that no man would feel more reluctant than myself to cast an illiberal national reflection, particularly on a people whom I regard in an aggregate sense as brethren and fellow-citizens; and among whom, I have the honour to number many of the most cordial and endearing intimacies which a life passed on service could generate.  But it is certain that all these people were Irish.\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\nTransactions of the colony until 18th of December 1791, when I quitted it, with an Account of its state at that time.\\n\\nThe Gorgon had arrived on the 21st of September, and the hour of departure to England, for the marine battalion, drew nigh.  If I be allowed to speak from my own feelings on the occasion, I will not say that we contemplated its approach with mingled sensations:  we hailed it with rapture and exultation.\\n\\nThe 'Supply', ever the harbinger of welcome and glad tidings, proclaimed by her own departure, that ours was at hand.  On the 26th of November she sailed for England.  It was impossible to view our separation with insensibility:  the little ship which had so often agitated our hopes and fears, which from long acquaintance we had learned to regard as part of ourselves, whose doors of hospitality had been ever thrown open to relieve our accumulated wants, and chase our solitary gloom!\\n\\nIn consequence of the offers made to the non-commissioned officers and privates of the marine battalion to remain in the country as settlers or to enter into the New South Wales corps, three corporals, one drummer and 59 privates accepted of grants of land, to settle at Norfolk Island and Rose Hill.  Of these men, several were undoubtedly possessed of sufficient skill and industry, by the assistance of the pay which was due to them from the date of their embarkation, in the beginning of the year 1787, to the day on which they were discharged, to set out with reasonable hopes of being able to procure a maintenance.  But the only apparent reason to which the behaviour of a majority of them could be ascribed was from infatuated affection to female convicts, whose characters and habits of life, I am sorry to say, promise from a connection neither honour nor tranquillity.\\n\\nThe narrative part of this work will, I conceive, be best brought to a termination by a description of the existing state of the colony, as taken by myself a few days previous to my embarkation in the Gorgon, to sail for England.\\n\\nDecember 2nd, 1791.  Went up to Rose Hill.  Public buildings here have not greatly multiplied since my last survey.  The storehouse and barrack have been long completed; also apartments for the chaplain of the regiment, and for the judge-advocate, in which last, criminal courts, when necessary, are held; but these are petty erections. In a colony which contains only a few hundred hovels built of twigs and mud, we feel consequential enough already to talk of a treasury, an admiralty, a public library and many other similar edifices, which are to form part of a magnificent square.  The great road from near the landing place to the governor's house is finished, and a very noble one it is, being of great breadth, and a mile long, in a strait line.  In many places it is carried over gullies of considerable depth, which have been filled up with trunks of trees covered with earth.  All the sawyers, carpenters and blacksmiths will soon be concentred under the direction of a very adequate person of the governor's household.  This plan is already so far advanced as to contain nine covered sawpits, which change of weather cannot disturb the operations of, an excellent workshed for the carpenters and a large new shop for the blacksmiths.  It certainly promises to be of great public benefit.  A new hospital has been talked of for the last two years, but is not yet begun.  Two long sheds, built in the form of a tent and thatched, are however finished, and capable of holding 200 patients. The sick list of today contains 382 names.  Rose Hill is less healthy than it used to be.  The prevailing disorder is a dysentery, which often terminates fatally.  There was lately one very violent putrid fever which, by timely removal of the patient, was prevented from spreading. Twenty-five men and two children died here in the month of November.\\n\\nWhen at the hospital I saw and conversed with some of the 'Chinese travellers'; four of them lay here, wounded by the natives.  I asked these men if they really supposed it possible to reach China.  They answered that they were certainly made to believe (they knew not how) that at a considerable distance to northward existed a large river, which separated this country from the back part of China; and that when it should be crossed (which was practicable) they would find themselves among a copper-coloured people, who would receive and treat them kindly. They added, that on the third day of their elopement, one of the party died of fatigue; another they saw butchered by the natives who, finding them unarmed, attacked them and put them to flight.  This happened near Broken Bay, which harbour stopped their progress to the northward and forced them to turn to the right hand, by which means they soon after found themselves on the sea shore, where they wandered about in a destitute condition, picking up shellfish to allay hunger.  Deeming the farther prosecution of their scheme impracticable, several of them agreed to return to Rose Hill, which with difficulty they accomplished, arriving almost famished.  On their road back they met six fresh adventurers sallying forth to join them, to whom they related what had passed and persuaded them to relinquish their intention.  There are at this time not less than thirty-eight convict men missing, who live in the woods by day, and at night enter the different farms and plunder for subsistence.\\n\\nDecember 3rd, 1791.  Began my survey of the cultivated land belonging to the public.  The harvest has commenced.  They are reaping both wheat and barley.  The field between the barrack and the governor's house contains wheat and maize, both very bad, but the former particularly so. In passing through the main street I was pleased to observe the gardens of the convicts look better than I had expected to find them. The vegetables in general are but mean, but the stalks of maize, with which they are interspersed, appear green and flourishing. The semicircular hill, which sweeps from the overseer of the cattle's house to the governor's house, is planted with maize, which, I am told, is the best here.  It certainly looks in most parts very good-- stout thick stalks with large spreading leaves--but I am surprised to find it so backward.  It is at least a month later than that in the gardens at Sydney.  Behind the maize is a field of wheat, which looks tolerably for this part of the world.  It will, I reckon, yield about twelve bushels an acre.  Continued my walk and looked at a little patch of wheat in the governor's garden, which was sown in drills, the ground being first mixed with a clay which its discoverers pretended was marle. Whatever it be, this experiment bespeaks not much in favour of its enriching qualities; for the corn looks miserably, and is far exceeded by some neighbouring spots on which no such advantage has been bestowed. Went round the crescent at the bottom of the garden, which certainly in beauty of form and situation is unrivalled in New South Wales. Here are eight thousand vines planted, all of which in another season are expected to bear grapes.  Besides the vines are several small fruit trees, which were brought in the Gorgon from the Cape, and look lively; on one of them are half a dozen apples as big as nutmegs.  Although the soil of the crescent be poor, its aspect and circular figure, so advantageous for receiving and retaining the rays of the sun, eminently fit it for a vineyard.  Passed the rivulet and looked at the corn land on its northern side.  On the western side of Clarke's\\\\* house the wheat and maize are bad, but on the eastern side is a field supposed to be the best in the colony.  I thought it of good height, and the ears well filled, but it is far from thick.\\n\\n\\\\[\\\\*Dod, who is mentioned in my former journal of this place, had died some months ago.  And Mr. Clarke, who was put in his room, is one of the superintendants, sent out by government, on a salary of forty pounds per annum.  He was bred to husbandry, under his father at Lewes in Sussex; and is, I conceive, competent to his office of principal conductor of the agriculture of Rose Hill.\\\\]\\n\\nWhile I was looking at it, Clarke came up.  I told him I thought he would reap fifteen or sixteen bushels an acre; he seemed to think seventeen or eighteen.  I have now inspected all the European corn. A man of so little experience of these matters as myself cannot speak with much confidence.  Perhaps the produce may average ten bushels an acre, or twelve at the outside.  Allowance should, however, be made in estimating the quality of the soil, for the space occupied by roots of trees, for inadequate culture, and in some measure to want of rain.  Less has fallen than was wished, but this spring was by no means so dry as the last. I find that the wheat grown at Rose Hill last year weighed fifty-seven pounds and a half per bushel.  My next visit was to the cattle, which consists of two stallions, six mares, and two colts; besides sixteen cows, two cow-calves, and one bull-calf, which were brought out by the Gorgon.  Two bulls which were on board died on the passage, so that on the young gentleman just mentioned depends the stocking of the colony.\\n\\nThe period of the inhabitants of New South Wales being supplied with animal food of their own raising is too remote for a prudent man to calculate. The cattle look in good condition, and I was surprised to hear that neither corn nor fodder is given to them.  The enclosures in which they are confined furnish hardly a blade of grass at present.  There are people appointed to tend them who have been used to this way of life, and who seem to execute it very well.\\n\\nSunday, December 4th, 1791.  Divine service is now performed here every Sunday, either by the chaplain of the settlement or the chaplain of the regiment.  I went to church today.  Several hundred convicts were present, the majority of whom I thought looked the most miserable beings in the shape of humanity I ever beheld.  They appeared to be worn down with fatigue.\\n\\nDecember, 5th.  Made excursions this day to view the public settlements. Reached the first, which is about a mile in a north-west direction from the governor's house.  This settlement contains, by admeasurement, 134 acres, a part of which is planted with maize, very backward, but in general tolerably good, and beautifully green.  Thirteen large huts, built in the form of a tent, are erected for the convicts who work here; but I could not learn the number of these last, being unable to find a superintendant or any person who could give me information. Ponds of water here sufficient to supply a thousand persons.\\n\\nWalked on to the second settlement, about two miles farther, through an uncleared country.  Here met Daveney, the person who planned and now superintends all the operations carried on here.  He told me that he estimated the quantity of cleared ground here at 300 acres. He certainly over-rates it one-third, by the judgment of every other person. Six weeks ago this was a forest.  it has been cleared, and the wood nearly burnt off the ground by 500 men, in the before-mentioned period, or rather in thirty days, for only that number have the convicts worked. He said it was too late to plant maize, and therefore he should sow turnips, which would help to meliorate and prepare it for next year.  On examining the soil, I thought it in general light, though in some places loamy to the touch.  He means to try the Rose Hill 'marle' upon it, with which he thinks it will incorporate well.  I hope it will succeed better than the experiment in the governor's garden.  I wished to know whether he had chosen this ground simply from the conveniency of its situation to Rose Hill, and its easy form for tillage, and having water, or from any marks which he had thought indicated good soil.  He said that what I had mentioned no doubt weighed with him, and that he judged the soil to be good, from the limbs of many of the trees growing on it being covered with moss.\\n\\n\\\"Are,\\\" said I, \\\"your 500 men still complete?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No; this day's muster gave only 460.  The rest are either sick and removed to the hospital, or are run away in the woods.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How much is each labourer's daily task?\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1636105900,\"title\":\"Transactions of the Colony to the end of November, 1791.\"},\"digest\":\"83X8SZ-xXp4MMAq1ayc-9aDDlyuULy2gPy8PjnWyy3s\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x597dC0Cb1F614AcabBee2715Af3A4c77AA88B2Ba\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"691PJXuntNf-If9-NVAWMzd-M9VVIDOdHFGG-etkyJQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"hzUnJS1Qi_sQefnT6K9MU02i7Dt1znOwLrlxqFyoOeE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"TU_G4pqUz4t03AqMyZbrVSkSOtV-RzQE9PaJTkxMUk3QajJuUrf18_fzxW9koJ7q0YbSgcJyXkntuC7lb767iw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x72a202ff60958efeaedc2cd57ea68427f2a7fc2ee0581283000502183b4a66675072b6b4d06e0c52703575c1824960be7f427d43bc65313a97ee008a32883b481c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"691PJXuntNf-If9-NVAWMzd-M9VVIDOdHFGG-etkyJQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"hzUnJS1Qi_sQefnT6K9MU02i7Dt1znOwLrlxqFyoOeE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"83X8SZ-xXp4MMAq1ayc-9aDDlyuULy2gPy8PjnWyy3s\"}"
