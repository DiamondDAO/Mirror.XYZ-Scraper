"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Last night, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin published an article titled \\\"Endgame\\\", describing the big blockchain competition chain and the next three possible development paths of the Ethereum roadmap with Rollup as the core. It's not long, but it reveals a lot of information.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gdVMndvbJWo9g5XvYR1o7.png?height=400&width=600)\\n\\nThe author tries to sort out some personal understandings for your reference.\\n\\nV God first mentioned the \\\"big block\\\" competition chain (no specific name mentioned), and he suggested that these \\\"big block\\\" competition chains should also adopt Ethereum's Rollup two-layer expansion plan, whether it is the introduction of fraud proofs. The Optimistic Rollup scheme is still the ZK Rollup scheme that uses zero-knowledge proof. In addition, he also mentioned the data availability sampling (data availability sampling) scheme, which allows users to check block availability. V God concluded that after adopting such a roadmap, these Although the competition chain of large blocks is still centralized in terms of block production, block verification is trustless and highly decentralized.\\n\\nThen, V God returned to the topic of Ethereum expansion, and he proposed two possible development paths for the Rollup Layer 2 network:\\n\\n1. A specific Rollup Layer 2 network, whether it is Arbitrum, Optimism, Zksync or something brand new, has really dominated the Rollup Layer 2 network track (every Individuals have migrated to this Rollup Layer 2 network), then the result is: block production is centralized, and block verification is trustless and highly decentralized.\\n\\nSo this roadmap is actually very similar to the rollup expansion scheme adopted by the competition chain.\\n\\n1. There is no Rollup Layer 2 network that can unify this track, but it is in a state of blooming. The tps of each Rollup Layer 2 network reaches hundreds of transactions per second, so we have an Ethereum with multiple Rollups. future. Then, God V mentioned that this is the expansion idea of ​​Cosmos. Seeing this, I remembered the suggestion that Georgios Konstantopoulos, research partner of Paradigm, mentioned in a podcast that the second-tier network of Ethereum Rollup can adopt the Cosmos IBC solution. According to this idea, users can avoid cumbersome bridges (no need to pay high fees on the main chain) by transferring users across chains between the Rollup Layer 2 network. Then the result is: decentralized verification, powerful Censorship resistance, even distributed block production (because Rollup is very small), but he also mentioned that because of the possibility of cross-domain MEV (new research direction), the decentralization of block production will gradually weaken , And eventually become centralized.\\n\\nThen we can find that these three roadmaps eventually lead to the same result: block production is centralized, block verification is trustless and highly decentralized, and it can still prevent censorship.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Kz4abPz8oco5rFDWeIbge.png?height=441&width=551)\\n\\nThen V God explained what this means for block producers and Ethereum. For the majority of Ethereum users, V God’s advice is not to comment too early on which Rollup path (1 or 2) will win. It is to explore openly. The translation is: \\\"Children do multiple-choice questions, and of course adults need them all\\\".\\n\\nFinally, V God also mentioned:\\n\\n**\\\"All of this may take years to complete. Sharding and data availability sampling are very complex techniques to implement. People need years of improvement and auditing to be able to safely store their assets in ZK- running a full EVM. In rollup. Cross-domain MEV research is still in its infancy. However, a realistic and bright future for scalable blockchains may emerge, which seems to be getting clearer.\\\"**\\n\\nJudging from this sentence, it seems that Rollup is more likely to follow path 2.
