"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1/ Topic: Going from Web 2 to Web 3 - ‚ÄúYour take rate is my opportunity‚Äù üßµ\\n\\n2/ Jeff Bezos famously said \\\"your margin is my opportunity\\\" referring to the way Amazon took market share by lowering prices and eating into competitor margins.\\n\\n3/ What Amazon did in commerce is what the internet did more generally. Lowering prices and redistributing value back to users has been the internet‚Äôs core economic dynamic since the 90s.\\n\\n4/ Craigslist did this with classifieds, Google and Facebook did this with media, TripAdvisor and Airbnb did this with travel, and so on.\\n\\n5/ Today this trend continues as Web 3 startups begin to eat into the margins of Web 2 incumbents. The higher the take rate, the more vulnerable the incumbent.\\n\\n6/ The video games industry does about $120B/year in sales, a significant portion of which is virtual goods. Most video games have 100% take rates.\\n\\n7/ Web 3 (aka crypto) games reduce the take rate dramatically. For example, Axie Infinity has generated over $1B in gross sales in the past year, most of which has gone back to users.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/Jihoz_Axie/status/1422772933680762887](https://twitter.com/Jihoz_Axie/status/1422772933680762887)\\n\\n8/ In most video games, some people pay to get ahead and other people work to get ahead. The difference in Web 3 is that the economy is peer to peer: players fund other players, not just the game developers.\\n\\n9/ Today there are over 8 million musicians on streaming services, yet less than 15,000 musicians (less that 0.2%) make more than $50K/year. That‚Äôs because the vast majority of the revenue is kept by the streaming services and music labels.\\n\\n10/ With NFTs, musicians keep over 90% of sales. By cutting out layers of intermediaries, musicians can credibly support themselves with just a thousand true fans:\\n\\n[https://cdixon.org/2021/02/27/NFTs-and-a-thousand-true-fans](https://cdixon.org/2021/02/27/NFTs-and-a-thousand-true-fans)\\n\\n11/ Social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok have take rates of 100% ‚Äî they don‚Äôt share any revenue at all with creators! That‚Äôs been great for them but bad for users.\\n\\n12/ In contrast, Web 3 social platforms like Rally, Mirror, and BitClout have effective take rates well below 10%. Most of the value is sent back to users and creators.\\n\\n13/ Web 2 platforms depend entirely on creators for content, yet give only scraps back. This is not sustainable. Web 2‚Äôs take rate is Web 3‚Äôs opportunity.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nOriginally published 8/11/21 on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1425645842552086532).\",\"timestamp\":1632241473,\"title\":\"Going from Web 2 to Web 3 - ‚ÄúYour take rate is my opportunity‚Äù \",\"publication\":\"cdixon\"},\"digest\":\"RoizwoGS7sh_5xG8rpDOlDyZnJStY6bxR9wSidf2ovU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xe11BFCBDd43745d4Aa6f4f18E24aD24f4623af04\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uyi3Gpaw0y5AZk868Az_3287B4IMzM2CNPEA3gLUzKs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"HdRGpF12UJ2pcxlSxrGXP7dH97lvUrnRkRTXAsiBIp0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"wY-JkZ6bcYi0BBDO5r1UY-0evwFDARHVHH_8ms4WegwpN5SNIRIwKEKP0_OlSjXmFjkGLavB1JTrq6RsMiPy3A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1cd820dd7265608c298b7dffbeafa9c444f006227d25590d34e5288af6a8920c7cab65d700c9fe76250b554dc3903c7b9eed000be4ed424386426241a6288f5f1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on cdixon.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uyi3Gpaw0y5AZk868Az_3287B4IMzM2CNPEA3gLUzKs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"HdRGpF12UJ2pcxlSxrGXP7dH97lvUrnRkRTXAsiBIp0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"RoizwoGS7sh_5xG8rpDOlDyZnJStY6bxR9wSidf2ovU\"}"
