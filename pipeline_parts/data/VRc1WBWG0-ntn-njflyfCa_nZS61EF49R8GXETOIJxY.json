"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1992 San Francisco\\n\\nBefore 1997 cryptographic code was a munition, a weapon, under the law. A tribe of strangers changed the law, and the world after 2007. They had been active since the late 80s.\\n\\nA trio of them founded a group in 1992. One hacker friend, as a joke, invented a name: \\\"Cypherpunk\\\" (Cipher + Cyberpunk).\\n\\nTheir mailing list was a gathering place grew to few hundred.The conversation was a decade ahead: cryptography.\\n\\nCryptography used to be a dark quantitative art of spies and soldiers. It began to open up with 2 publications on Data Encryption Standard and public-key cryptography. It required an export permit. Some sued the U.S. State Department to turn the ideas into free speech a few years later.\\n\\n\\\"A Cyperpunk's Manifesto\\\" in March 1993 detailed their values:\\n\\nPrivacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age, large organizations cannot grant it. If people expect privacy they must defend it. Cyberpunks write code to defend privacy - action over academics. Steven Levy wrote about the \\\"Crypto Rebels\\\" for \\\"Wired\\\" in May 1993.\\n\\nThey were involved in many projects and prototypes. The Electronic Frontier Foundation. Wikileaks. Digicash, Bitgold, Hashcash, B-Money, Z-Cash, Avalanche, Ethereum.\\n\\nThis was part of a long running quest to merge privacy with money. Years before, In 1985, there was key paper about privacy and money: “Security without Identification: Transaction Systems to Make Big Brother Obsolete” - about anonymous digital cash and pseudonymous reputation.\\n\\nOne wrote a whitepaper after the financial world imploded in 2008. True to the privacy ethos, the name used: Satoshi Nakamoto\\n\\n2877 Mars-Earth Diplomatic Trade Transport\\n\\n“Andreea, what brings you on this trip?”\\n\\n”I’m with the Mercantile Trade Association. Now that things have changed, we have to change with the times. They took over. They’re the hosts, and we have a seat at the ‘party’. If we want to be invited again, I guess we have to become good guests. And you? You’re an officer but the war’s over, why are you on this ship?”\\n\\n”I’m in charge of watering down the drinks. Just because the punch bowl is bottomless, it doesn’t mean we have to keep drinking.”\\n\\nShe laughed. More waters and we keep talking.\\n\\n\\\"You don't have to answer this question but I wanted to ask.\\\"\\n\\\"Go ahead, it's okay.\\\"\\n\\\"You were in the War. How do you feel about it ending the way it did?\\\"\\n\\nI pause. She hesitates but I reassure her the question was fine.\\n\\\"I'm acting okay but I know I'm not. You probably heard a lot of that.  Everything has changed except for ourselves. We're still going through the motions. And it's not just out of habit, it's because of those we lost. It's hard to change because inside maybe you feel like you were betraying those who weren't there to see this strange new peace. Who didn't make it. We got the seat at the table but they didn't.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who did you lose?\\\"\\nA bold question but sometimes you meet someone, and even if it's for a few minutes, it feels like forever, in a good way. Then it's okay.\\n\\nI was about to answer when someone came in looking for me. Before I get up to leave, I answer her. \\\"I lost almost everyone.\\\"\\n\\n[https://audius.co/Thecomebackkid/cypher-273104](https://audius.co/Thecomebackkid/cypher-273104)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZroPE8QaQptaUdStqoiZc.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3LYrPiuOOCJSiKNVMIWkd.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1634184310,\"title\":\"1999: 7.4 Code To Build A New World, 2877\"},\"digest\":\"WqR9ywDFrwKs0dSKyMqNomVvVVAPjVhNlifpXmib11Q\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ZS5-oFbSFaD4ft6Jq9ng9JQV8nnPhjphR_l4z7GfI1Kv0c9zrtMlMdLggBqP1kYfrwnhLjGjuNy-owoOcPnJ1w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"cYtoTg-Ki8TzUJk-UBJ5XxnjfVeO3H8GONdRvICrIHA\"}"
