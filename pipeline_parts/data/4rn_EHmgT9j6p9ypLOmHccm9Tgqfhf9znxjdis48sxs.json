"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Plutos Network, a multi-chain synthetic asset issuance and trading platform, announced that it has established a strategic partnership with Solana-based DEX Slope.Finance. Plutos Network plans to connect to Solana in late October and is expected to be integrated into the Slope wallet by then. Slope Wallet will also provide DApp support so that Solana users can more easily experience the Plutos Network on their mobile phones. In addition, the two parties will conduct a series of cooperation, including the joint creation of cross-chain asset bridging services, which will serve as a hub connecting ecosystems such as Solana, BSC, and Ethereum; and the joint establishment of a PLUT pool for users to trade through Slope DEX.\",\"timestamp\":1634314694,\"title\":\"Plutos Network, a multi-chain synthetic asset issuance and trading platform, and Slope.Finance reached a strategic cooperation\"},\"digest\":\"1xh4-GVysDSfVIR4dDb41rtQeW8-03yamz-nOv5Ersk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa3dfB93e0dD8204895993a107Cf1d49bd908C74e\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"f7BegqTL0S2p3cQsVJZZ_057jP_kmnsx7ggoy3cCEX8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"XUe9Na0MBuDn1X0bZ6qBmuY_HYtIDBZGnkQ2o3cMQIY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"RhE1Kp1U-jepGcOAO87EUQZfJOnLi4da-a-hVwS85o5ny8O-yoUOvpTcoQBVJ6f7LlbwZjT1jMohh5lrznKy-Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc7609aac2f6f0b3a95ba0d137980586433036dc613b488393ce545411c6a563313146a9670dadd0b01e209c6e89ec718a6ebb647adc4afc90abae32f6b52a14d1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"f7BegqTL0S2p3cQsVJZZ_057jP_kmnsx7ggoy3cCEX8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"XUe9Na0MBuDn1X0bZ6qBmuY_HYtIDBZGnkQ2o3cMQIY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"1xh4-GVysDSfVIR4dDb41rtQeW8-03yamz-nOv5Ersk\"}"
