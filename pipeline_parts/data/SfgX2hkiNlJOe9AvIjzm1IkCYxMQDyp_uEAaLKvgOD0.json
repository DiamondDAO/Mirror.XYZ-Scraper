"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"#### How Anchor Protocol could make the worldâ€™s most difficult social policy a breeze.\\n\\nAs the prospect of sufficient minimum wage grows bleaker for the poor and less educated, we have seen ideas such as Universal Basic Income catch some attention recently.\\n\\nA growing number of countries are looking at UBI as an alternative to welfare. But the key question everyone keeps asking:\\n\\n**How could it ever work?**\\n\\nIn this piece, I hope to present a possible scenario where the blockchain could become a realistic opportunity to implement universal basic income worldwide. I think you will notice that we are closer to that scenario than we think.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn the age of the pandemic, stimulus checks and unemployment programs have made Universal Basic Income a hot-button topic in the United States and other parts of the world. It has given us a sneak peek of the [benefits](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/taxes/how-the-child-tax-credit-and-other-stimulus-packages-benefit-the-full-economy-and-not-just-recipients/ar-AANsfVp) resulting from a universal basic income program and made people wonder what a world with it would be like.\\n\\nThis has made opinions grow louder than ever before, concerning the topic. However, in this piece I am going to break down an idea presented by a charity protocol on the [Terra](https://www.terra.money/) blockchain:\\n\\n**A universal basic income program that pays for itself.**\\n\\nI know, it sounds crazy. And, perhaps, I am naive for thinking it is possible. However, the numbers below speak for themselves. The math aligns. Maybe all we need is an open mind.\\n\\nThis [tweet](https://twitter.com/angelprotocol/status/1406077636053512200?s=20) from Angel Protocol lays everything out on a silver platter. It made me wonder if it could really be so simple.\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cJIfaM5rAKYyuV7LBiz-f.jpg?height=480&width=720)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638351630,\"title\":\"\\nA Realistic Look at UBI Powered by Terra\"},\"digest\":\"xdG2-P-ZXDaNOFaIUh7rWj_NUwAPeJNRoLkmR_iar4I\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x833b7bab3BF9d88Be7390D01EF6183C367F0400b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"g0iYr88nkjnMfeF8HsMX9uAh6T1JJbf2H96twCndV7g\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"W0HJialcMPxIEe_pM1H2GWk4oCqSiQzKi7DFgzLzy1o\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"3cOyZKhqsCZFi2IhlpSe5mRzxAnUUHNApV0F6Dy__wEQpn8_UVUTNoqkKsaSBYlNAtOvIP9oIowL5KG-2ZST7w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xfc19845f486edbac758e5a1064610eecae76851acab1644712c614d9d74193c26605d62cf556673c64943697d5d06ac8fff671010960cd2ee6a24459468151271b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"g0iYr88nkjnMfeF8HsMX9uAh6T1JJbf2H96twCndV7g\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"W0HJialcMPxIEe_pM1H2GWk4oCqSiQzKi7DFgzLzy1o\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"xdG2-P-ZXDaNOFaIUh7rWj_NUwAPeJNRoLkmR_iar4I\"}"
