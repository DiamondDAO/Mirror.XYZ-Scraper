"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"> **your biweekly look into the decentralized world of film üé•**\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Along came a good story... üéûÔ∏è\\n\\nIn the beginning, five strangers became five friends, hoping to shake up the film world with a strong storytelling community. We wanted to take filmmaking into the future and bring everyone along with us. We wanted to combine the best of creative minds and technology lovers to come together and seek out a new way of doing things. Mostly, we wanted to shake things up. The result? **FilmmakerDAO.**\\n\\nWe're at an interesting place in history, and nowhere is that more evident than in the arts. But who can help us cross over to the future? Using the community-focused advent of DAOs, FilmmakerDAO is set to build a unique space for film and web3 for the new era. And that starts with community, first and foremost. Instead of gatekeeping, you'll find trust. Instead of old ideas, you'll find a passionate group of like-minded cinephiles, eager to create something together.\\n\\nAll of that is based on community, which can be slow and patient. And as of right now, our community is growing fast! Our aim is to dive into this space with an eagerness to be heard and to make space for creativity. We've all been struggling to find our people, so we thought we'd make a place for them instead. \\n\\n> *\\\"Poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.\\\" -John Keating, Dead Poets Society*\\n\\n# FilmmakerDAOs' core team\\n\\n* [bt3gl](https://bt3gl.xyz/)\\n* [Chad Hugghins](https://www.chadhugghins.com/)\\n* [TheRealIanQ](https://twitter.com/TheRealIanQ)\\n* Oxhanamichi\\n* [Squigglybug](https://twitter.com/squigglybug)\\n* Damien\\n* Ants\\n\\n## Filmmaking on Web3 üìΩÔ∏è\\n\\n> *Think of a beautiful garden- it's a beautiful sanctuary, brimming with flowers and trees, in a small town and beloved by everyone. People pour their hearts and souls into tending to the garden, proud of their work and collaboration. They start to think of sharing it with the world, because it tells the story of their town and all they've been through. Only the town realizes it costs too much money to drive out of towners to the garden, house them, monitor the lights and sway of people. Too much money to go around telling people about it, getting the appropriate licenses. Even with the right license, there are so many other sites people want to go that the people start to give up. They start to think tourism is so saturated, no one will care about their lovely little garden. It's a lovely garden and everyone believes in its story, but in the end, they can't find a way to pull everything together. What do they do? How do they come together to share their story?*\\n\\nThat is what *FilmmakerDAO* is all about. Helping filmmakers share their gardens. Time has moved very fast, but over the course of a few months, we've documented our ethos, goals, and mission and welcomed in a ton of new community members.\\n\\nCommunity building takes time, and our Discord is at the heart of it. Our Discord will be token-gated for now, with the goal of informing how we will work together as web3 filmmakers. It's a nuanced, nascent process that requires cultivation. Still, we have aimed to keep this cost accessible to you, in order to ensure a welcome atmosphere. (LINK to Tokens)\\n\\nSince that time, we heard this question from someone in the film world whose interest peaked when they heard of what we were doing*‚Äî*\\n\\n`üí° \\\"We know we need to get into web3 as filmmakers. Can you help us?\\\"`\\n\\nBoom. That is it. You don't have a mission until you can succinctly answer a question. But we wanted to dig deeper so we invited them in and our first project idea was born*‚Äî**[Humans of Web 3.](https://mirror.xyz/0xf382eE4C0c752C41d083cBF2106506884787c190/crowdfunds/0x93c0D19A989CB4762522E782158D10265895977C)***\\n\\nNow we want the same for you.
