"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"When we look back from 2021 back to 20 years ago, I recall we were all in the rush of making things digital. Expense forms? ASP pages. Time cards? PHP sites. Invoices, visitor register books, any sort of form you can imagine was in a digitization rush despite the necessity. I am not intending to question the necessity nor the efficiency of this gold rush but want to fast forward few years.\\n\\nYou walk into your office in the morning; process your time sheets, finish filling in your last week's expense form and browse to other page and fill in travel authorization request for the next business trip. Then you get an email notification that your payroll cannot be processed because there are still unapproved travel expenses by your manager. You print these again and go to your manager's room got your reports signed, and you remind your manager to approve your timesheets and oh by they way, i need to go to customer again; can you also login to travel app and approve my travel form please? It is really a fantastic digital world, a world of easy to use solutions and you wonder how you have worked previously without all these paperwork.\\n\\nYou can remind many more similar examples for your good old days but let's stop nostalgia for now and come to the point. You were inn fact in the middle of a sense of missing out of a digitization. It was digitize or die times (and how does it feel today? this is for another article). You have ended up with so many users, and passwords for every single different application and plus, you have some many different apps which atomizes another business workflow you deal with every day.\\n\\nEvery problem creates its own solution. The business then created its own solution for the problems it has created. We witnessed integration solutions for different applications so that they can share some sort of data via API's (Mulesoft), automated workflow generators (ServiceNow), a single account to rule them all (Okta), .... all possible companies that solves your fragmentation problems.\\n\\nWhat makes me smile is a brilliant day, we have all these fragmentation issues resolved now, and we took our very important lesson and will not ever make the same mistake again, right? I'm sorry but that is not the case. That has never been the case. History of human beings is a spinning wheel, we first have some problems, we create tools to solve these problems, and the tools create their won problems that we to solve...\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OTTaMM2IBL_I4nsQXHsZg.png?height=366&width=833)\\n\\nIf we want to summarize;\\n\\n1. We started to improve our processes, workflows, businesses by digitizing them with software.\\n2. We have used different tools to solve our different problems; and created new problems.\\n3. We created a multi billion $ business to solve our new problems around integration, API management, fragmentation.\\n\\nNow when we fast forward to 2021; we have the all ingredients to live through the same digitalization revolution and created the next multi billion $ business to fix our **new** problems. I am talking about IOT, Internet Of Things.\\n\\nWe are exactly doing the same thing we have done previously, connecting everything to internet; which is great, because I can turn on the thermostat at home before arriving home and it is even greater that my smart thermostat monitors the activity and detect my patterns and starts turning my heating system on and off automatically. That looks like a great product, so let's start working on the next item to turn it into a smart thing; shall we make our pet feeder smart? Why not, we love our pets, don't we? And the next, and the next, and the next. This is a fascinating improvement; we just connect everything to Internet and digitize them so that we can control everything remotely, detect usage patterns convert them to actionable insights.\\n\\nWhat we do is in fact create a new ecosystem, an ecosystem of **things** which are all connected. It's already obvious that the new ecosystem is broken because the number of protocols at your home that are **connected** and **can not talk to eachother** is increasing everyday. I counted how many apps I have to use at my phone to control the smart things at my house, and I have 14 different apps. Wouldn't it be great if I had one and single app to control everything? Congrats, you have just found a billion $ business domain, this time it is not for IT systems, this time it is for internet connected devices. What you have just discovered is the tip of iceberg. Let's create some more billion $ valued tech companies:\\n\\n* Wouldn't it be great if your first gen smart switch that runs the back office on AWS could talk to our new Smart Switch which runs on Azure because we migrated to Azure and didn't have time to migrate the legacy devices.\\n* Wouldn't it be great to make every single IOT device secure?\\n* Wouldn't it be great to upgrade all these IOT devices from a centralized dashboard?\\n* Wouldn't it be great manage all your IOT devices with a single API?\\n* Wouldn't it be great integration to integrate your devices via IOT to your enterprise workflows?\\n\\nI can increase the number of examples here, but I think I don't have to because you all get it. I call this first stage of innovation strategy by benchmarking what has been disrupted and what is next?\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y18g_AYb9MnJ8uwJRzreA.png?height=145&width=835)\\n\\nThere are already billion $ companies in IOT market, but yet no one still didn't reach to the level of maturity and seamless integration at this market. AWS IoT, Azure IoT, Google Cloud IOT are some of the examples in this domain and they are all trying to solve these problems. If you're interested; you can check AWS IoT Things Graph/GreenGrass, Google IoT Core, Azure IoT Hub which are trying to be the next billion $ business lines for tech giants. However, Okta, ServiceNow, Mulesoft won when these tech giants existed...\\n\\nAlthough IOT and workflows and any business that will integrate, aggregate, manage smart devices around us will be the next big companies, the companies who will decentralize all these will be even bigger; yes I am talking about blockchain and Web 3.0; but this is a subject of another article.\\n\\nIf you could make it all the way here, thanks for reading.\\n\\n<crowdfund://undefined?features=overview,backers>\",\"timestamp\":1636446068,\"title\":\"Software, IOT and Déjà vu\"},\"digest\":\"vEqyi738Xui8cI0Kh0-gwtFXycCX-gbvZlsIyU1J3Bc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9Da408b7bf97F89b92102F848EED5234801D56fd\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"XE8Oe0rB0IN0evjSh1vCCjPaawb4N8KCShk5EvCZd5E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1ZU80c_kbKOtO2Zp7RZTbGgR7fwkiaetlxmZxc9AuMs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"_Xe3WQrRpqx2i7qk615C1euVabvx2NgKLvBETz4FH2-KM2ChIvbOfUz7HviTcyl6MoVad-N6cOcwPcoM-pG4CA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x92f89221f98312d936ed1f519e46d4e3ff35e9e75cb5903eee75ff52e71eea1e1feedb6842d548f835dce51077b05820e6f656606a4343e1fe9c871b14a5a23c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"XE8Oe0rB0IN0evjSh1vCCjPaawb4N8KCShk5EvCZd5E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1ZU80c_kbKOtO2Zp7RZTbGgR7fwkiaetlxmZxc9AuMs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"b9lOyhnR6Kj5DlNyVYzXMINko7GE1ZyHOFVZNigioC8\"}"
