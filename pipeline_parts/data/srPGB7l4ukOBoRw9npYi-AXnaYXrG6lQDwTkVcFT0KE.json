We‚Äôre all here to support you as we work together on building this projects future.\\n\\n## Who can be a Collaborator?\\n\\n**Anybody** - even if you don‚Äôt have a specific skill set. Sometimes all a project needs is moral support, community assistance answering questions in our groups, helping out at events, or running small tasks like giving your feedback on a document. If you have a useful skill, that‚Äôs great too.\\n\\n## üëã Introduce yourself\\n\\nThis is a **must**. Be noticed - Light up the sky üåü, don‚Äôt let anyone not-notice you arrived ‚ú®\\n\\n* Hash tag your skills (if any)- EG.\\\\* `#bizdev, #CSS, #illustration, #callhosting`\\n* Who are you?\\n* What are your passions, hobbies, interests?\\n* How did you get here?\\n* Why are you here?\\n* What are you interested in?\\n* Who are you interested in connecting with?\\n* What skills -if any- can you offer to other members?\\n\\n### Pro-Tips\\n\\n\\\\- It‚Äôs okay to observe the group, but try to make an intro within 5 days. \\n - Use a nice photo and a real name to get a warmer reception.\\n\\n## Types of Collaborators\\n\\n### Freshers and Lurkers\\n\\nFreshers are new kids on the block. Lurkers hang out not saying much and generally observing the group. Both are fine, try to participate however you can, vote and offer useful perspective occasionally when you can.\\n\\n### Residents\\n\\nResidents volunteer from time to time to help with crowd-tasking. For example, group admins, Ambassadors, or to help verify some venues. When you volunteer you‚Äôll be given a task that may take anything from 10 minutes to a couple of hours depending on various factors. These tasks may be random, or they can involve your special skill set.\\n\\n### High-Level Collabs AKA ‚ÄúLeads‚Äù\\n\\nFor Crowd-Tasking projects we have small specialised working groups. Each is headed by a **Lead** with a strong grasp of the tasks at hand.\\n\\n## Working Groups\\n\\nTo gain residency, members complete an online interview (links below). If you don‚Äôt see your skill set here, you can create a new group for it.\\n\\n* Web Development\\n* Design and Illustration\\n* Social Media Management\\n* [Online Assembly](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/YHiCb5_XaYGdpbRypQWQkl09ptcQ-gQ4z3xVB_ChbDc) - (Community Moderators - apply here)\\n* The Dark Room **\\\\[Link needed\\\\]**- (Photographers - apply here)\\n* The Venue Investigation Bureau - (Finding and/or verifying venues)\\n* The Incubator (Where Event Managers are made - [apply here](https://form.typeform.com/to/G1bjAQ?typeform-source=mundolingo.org))\\n\\n## Apply as an IRL Collaborator\\n\\n### Managers\\n\\nThis requires a high level of commitment.
