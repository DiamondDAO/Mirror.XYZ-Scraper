"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I soon heard the carriage roll out of the yard.\\n\\nIt seemed a long time before Ginger came back, and before we were left alone; and then she told me all that she had seen.\\n\\n\\\"I can't tell much,\\\" she said.  \\\"We went a gallop nearly all the way, and got there just as the doctor rode up.  There was a woman sitting on the ground with the lady's head in her lap. The doctor poured something into her mouth, but all that I heard was, \\\\`She is not dead.'  Then I was led off by a man to a little distance. After awhile she was taken to the carriage, and we came home together. I heard my master say to a gentleman who stopped him to inquire, that he hoped no bones were broken, but that she had not spoken yet.\\\"\\n\\nWhen Lord George took Ginger for hunting, York shook his head; he said it ought to be a steady hand to train a horse for the first season, and not a random rider like Lord George.\\n\\nGinger used to like it very much, but sometimes when she came back I could see that she had been very much strained, and now and then she gave a short cough.  She had too much spirit to complain, but I could not help feeling anxious about her.\\n\\nTwo days after the accident Blantyre paid me a visit; he patted me and praised me very much; he told Lord George that he was sure the horse knew of Annie's danger as well as he did.  \\\"I could not have held him in if I would,\\\" said he, \\\"she ought never to ride any other horse.\\\" I found by their conversation that my young mistress was now out of danger, and would soon be able to ride again.  This was good news to me and I looked forward to a happy life.\\n\\n25      Reuben Smith\\n\\nNow I must say a little about Reuben Smith, who was left in charge of the stables when York went to London.  No one more thoroughly understood his business than he did, and when he was all right there could not be a more faithful or valuable man. He was gentle and very clever in his management of horses, and could doctor them almost as well as a farrier, for he had lived two years with a veterinary surgeon. He was a first-rate driver; he could take a four-in-hand or a tandem as easily as a pair.  He was a handsome man, a good scholar, and had very pleasant manners.  I believe everybody liked him; certainly the horses did.  The only wonder was that he should be in an under situation and not in the place of a head coachman like York; but he had one great fault and that was the love of drink. He was not like some men, always at it; he used to keep steady for weeks or months together, and then he would break out and have a \\\"bout\\\" of it, as York called it, and be a disgrace to himself, a terror to his wife, and a nuisance to all that had to do with him.  He was, however, so useful that two or three times York had hushed the matter up and kept it from the earl's knowledge; but one night, when Reuben had to drive a party home from a ball he was so drunk that he could not hold the reins, and a gentleman of the party had to mount the box and drive the ladies home. Of course, this could not be hidden, and Reuben was at once dismissed; his poor wife and little children had to turn out of the pretty cottage by the park gate and go where they could.  Old Max told me all this, for it happened a good while ago; but shortly before Ginger and I came Smith had been taken back again.  York had interceded for him with the earl, who is very kind-hearted, and the man had promised faithfully that he would never taste another drop as long as he lived there. He had kept his promise so well that York thought he might be safely trusted to fill his place while he was away, and he was so clever and honest that no one else seemed so well fitted for it.\\n\\nIt was now early in April, and the family was expected home some time in May. The light brougham was to be fresh done up, and as Colonel Blantyre was obliged to return to his regiment it was arranged that Smith should drive him to the town in it, and ride back; for this purpose he took the saddle with him, and I was chosen for the journey. At the station the colonel put some money into Smith's hand and bid him good-by, saying, \\\"Take care of your young mistress, Reuben, and don't let Black Auster be hacked about by any random young prig that wants to ride him -- keep him for the lady.\\\"\\n\\nWe left the carriage at the maker's, and Smith rode me to the White Lion, and ordered the hostler to feed me well, and have me ready for him at four o'clock.  A nail in one of my front shoes had started as I came along, but the hostler did not notice it till just about four o'clock. Smith did not come into the yard till five, and then he said he should not leave till six, as he had met with some old friends.  The man then told him of the nail, and asked if he should have the shoe looked to.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said Smith, \\\"that will be all right till we get home.\\\"\\n\\nHe spoke in a very loud, offhand way, and I thought it very unlike him not to see about the shoe, as he was generally wonderfully particular about loose nails in our shoes.  He did not come at six nor seven, nor eight, and it was nearly nine o'clock before he called for me, and then it was with a loud, rough voice.  He seemed in a very bad temper, and abused the hostler, though I could not tell what for.\\n\\nThe landlord stood at the door and said, \\\"Have a care, Mr. Smith!\\\" but he answered angrily with an oath; and almost before he was out of the town he began to gallop, frequently giving me a sharp cut with his whip, though I was going at full speed.  The moon had not yet risen, and it was very dark.  The roads were stony, having been recently mended; going over them at this pace, my shoe became looser, and as we neared the turnpike gate it came off.\\n\\nIf Smith had been in his right senses he would have been sensible of something wrong in my pace, but he was too drunk to notice.\\n\\nBeyond the turnpike was a long piece of road, upon which fresh stones had just been laid -- large sharp stones, over which no horse could be driven quickly without risk of danger.  Over this road, with one shoe gone, I was forced to gallop at my utmost speed, my rider meanwhile cutting into me with his whip, and with wild curses urging me to go still faster. Of course my shoeless foot suffered dreadfully; the hoof was broken and split down to the very quick, and the inside was terribly cut by the sharpness of the stones.\\n\\nThis could not go on; no horse could keep his footing under such circumstances; the pain was too great.  I stumbled, and fell with violence on both my knees.  Smith was flung off by my fall, and, owing to the speed I was going at, he must have fallen with great force. I soon recovered my feet and limped to the side of the road, where it was free from stones.  The moon had just risen above the hedge, and by its light I could see Smith lying a few yards beyond me. He did not rise; he made one slight effort to do so, and then there was a heavy groan.  I could have groaned, too, for I was suffering intense pain both from my foot and knees; but horses are used to bear their pain in silence.  I uttered no sound, but I stood there and listened.  One more heavy groan from Smith; but though he now lay in the full moonlight I could see no motion. I could do nothing for him nor myself, but, oh! how I listened for the sound of horse, or wheels, or footsteps!  The road was not much frequented, and at this time of the night we might stay for hours before help came to us. I stood watching and listening.  It was a calm, sweet April night; there were no sounds but a few low notes of a nightingale, and nothing moved but the white clouds near the moon and a brown owl that flitted over the hedge.  It made me think of the summer nights long ago, when I used to lie beside my mother in the green pleasant meadow at Farmer Grey's.\\n\\n26      How it Ended\\n\\nIt must have been nearly midnight when I heard at a great distance the sound of a horse's feet.  Sometimes the sound died away, then it grew clearer again and nearer.  The road to Earlshall led through woods that belonged to the earl; the sound came in that direction, and I hoped it might be some one coming in search of us.  As the sound came nearer and nearer I was almost sure I could distinguish Ginger's step; a little nearer still, and I could tell she was in the dog-cart. I neighed loudly, and was overjoyed to hear an answering neigh from Ginger, and men's voices.  They came slowly over the stones, and stopped at the dark figure that lay upon the ground.\\n\\nOne of the men jumped out, and stooped down over it.  \\\"It is Reuben,\\\" he said, \\\"and he does not stir!\\\"\\n\\nThe other man followed, and bent over him.  \\\"He's dead,\\\" he said; \\\"feel how cold his hands are.\\\"\\n\\nThey raised him up, but there was no life, and his hair was soaked with blood.  They laid him down again, and came and looked at me. They soon saw my cut knees.\\n\\n\\\"Why, the horse has been down and thrown him!  Who would have thought the black horse would have done that?  Nobody thought he could fall. Reuben must have been lying here for hours!  Odd, too, that the horse has not moved from the place.\\\"\\n\\nRobert then attempted to lead me forward.  I made a step, but almost fell again.\\n\\n\\\"Halloo! he's bad in his foot as well as his knees.  Look here -- his hoof is cut all to pieces; he might well come down, poor fellow! I tell you what, Ned, I'm afraid it hasn't been all right with Reuben. Just think of his riding a horse over these stones without a shoe! Why, if he had been in his right senses he would just as soon have tried to ride him over the moon.  I'm afraid it has been the old thing over again. Poor Susan! she looked awfully pale when she came to my house to ask if he had not come home.  She made believe she was not a bit anxious, and talked of a lot of things that might have kept him. But for all that she begged me to go and meet him.  But what must we do? There's the horse to get home as well as the body, and that will be no easy matter.\\\"\\n\\nThen followed a conversation between them, till it was agreed that Robert, as the groom, should lead me, and that Ned must take the body. It was a hard job to get it into the dog-cart, for there was no one to hold Ginger; but she knew as well as I did what was going on, and stood as still as a stone.  I noticed that, because, if she had a fault, it was that she was impatient in standing.\\n\\nNed started off very slowly with his sad load, and Robert came and looked at my foot again; then he took his handkerchief and bound it closely round, and so he led me home.  I shall never forget that night walk; it was more than three miles.  Robert led me on very slowly, and I limped and hobbled on as well as I could with great pain. I am sure he was sorry for me, for he often patted and encouraged me, talking to me in a pleasant voice.\\n\\nAt last I reached my own box, and had some corn; and after Robert had wrapped up my knees in wet cloths, he tied up my foot in a bran poultice, to draw out the heat and cleanse it before the horse-doctor saw it in the morning, and I managed to get myself down on the straw, and slept in spite of the pain.\\n\\nThe next day after the farrier had examined my wounds, he said he hoped the joint was not injured; and if so, I should not be spoiled for work, but I should never lose the blemish.  I believe they did the best to make a good cure, but it was a long and painful one.  Proud flesh, as they called it, came up in my knees, and was burned out with caustic; and when at last it was healed, they put a blistering fluid over the front of both knees to bring all the hair off; they had some reason for this, and I suppose it was all right.\\n\\nAs Smith's death had been so sudden, and no one was there to see it, there was an inquest held.  The landlord and hostler at the White Lion, with several other people, gave evidence that he was intoxicated when he started from the inn.  The keeper of the toll-gate said he rode at a hard gallop through the gate; and my shoe was picked up among the stones, so that the case was quite plain to them, and I was cleared of all blame.\\n\\nEverybody pitied Susan.  She was nearly out of her mind; she kept saying over and over again, \\\"Oh! he was so good -- so good! It was all that cursed drink; why will they sell that cursed drink? Oh Reuben, Reuben!\\\"  So she went on till after he was buried; and then, as she had no home or relations, she, with her six little children, was obliged once more to leave the pleasant home by the tall oak-trees, and go into that great gloomy Union House.\\n\\n27      Ruined and Going Downhill\\n\\nAs soon as my knees were sufficiently healed I was turned into a small meadow for a month or two; no other creature was there; and though I enjoyed the liberty and the sweet grass, yet I had been so long used to society that I felt very lonely.  Ginger and I had become fast friends, and now I missed her company extremely.  I often neighed when I heard horses' feet passing in the road, but I seldom got an answer; till one morning the gate was opened, and who should come in but dear old Ginger.  The man slipped off her halter, and left her there. With a joyful whinny I trotted up to her; we were both glad to meet, but I soon found that it was not for our pleasure that she was brought to be with me.  Her story would be too long to tell, but the end of it was that she had been ruined by hard riding, and was now turned off to see what rest would do.\\n\\nLord George was young and would take no warning; he was a hard rider, and would hunt whenever he could get the chance, quite careless of his horse. Soon after I left the stable there was a steeplechase, and he determined to ride.  Though the groom told him she was a little strained, and was not fit for the race, he did not believe it, and on the day of the race urged Ginger to keep up with the foremost riders. With her high spirit, she strained herself to the utmost; she came in with the first three horses, but her wind was touched, besides which he was too heavy for her, and her back was strained. \\\"And so,\\\" she said, \\\"here we are, ruined in the prime of our youth and strength, you by a drunkard, and I by a fool; it is very hard.\\\" We both felt in ourselves that we were not what we had been.  However, that did not spoil the pleasure we had in each other's company; we did not gallop about as we once did, but we used to feed, and lie down together, and stand for hours under one of the shady lime-trees with our heads close to each other; and so we passed our time till the family returned from town.\\n\\nOne day we saw the earl come into the meadow, and York was with him. Seeing who it was, we stood still under our lime-tree, and let them come up to us.  They examined us carefully. The earl seemed much annoyed.\\n\\n\\\"There is three hundred pounds flung away for no earthly use,\\\" said he; \\\"but what I care most for is that these horses of my old friend, who thought they would find a good home with me, are ruined. The mare shall have a twelve-month's run, and we shall see what that will do for her; but the black one, he must be sold; 'tis a great pity, but I could not have knees like these in my stables.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, my lord, of course not,\\\" said York; \\\"but he might get a place where appearance is not of much consequence, and still be well treated.  I know a man in Bath, the master of some livery stables, who often wants a good horse at a low figure; I know he looks well after his horses.  The inquest cleared the horse's character, and your lordship's recommendation, or mine, would be sufficient warrant for him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You had better write to him, York.  I should be more particular about the place than the money he would fetch.\\\"\\n\\nAfter this they left us.\\n\\n\\\"They'll soon take you away,\\\" said Ginger, \\\"and I shall lose the only friend I have, and most likely we shall never see each other again. 'Tis a hard world!\\\"\\n\\nAbout a week after this Robert came into the field with a halter, which he slipped over my head, and led me away.  There was no leave-taking of Ginger; we neighed to each other as I was led off, and she trotted anxiously along by the hedge, calling to me as long as she could hear the sound of my feet.\\n\\nThrough the recommendation of York, I was bought by the master of the livery stables.  I had to go by train, which was new to me, and required a good deal of courage the first time; but as I found the puffing, rushing, whistling, and, more than all, the trembling of the horse-box in which I stood did me no real harm, I soon took it quietly.\\n\\nWhen I reached the end of my journey I found myself in a tolerably comfortable stable, and well attended to. These stables were not so airy and pleasant as those I had been used to. The stalls were laid on a slope instead of being level, and as my head was kept tied to the manger, I was obliged always to stand on the slope, which was very fatiguing.  Men do not seem to know yet that horses can do more work if they can stand comfortably and can turn about; however, I was well fed and well cleaned, and, on the whole, I think our master took as much care of us as he could. He kept a good many horses and carriages of different kinds for hire. Sometimes his own men drove them; at others, the horse and chaise were let to gentlemen or ladies who drove themselves.\\n\\n28      A Job Horse and His Drivers\\n\\nHitherto I had always been driven by people who at least knew how to drive; but in this place I was to get my experience of all the different kinds of bad and ignorant driving to which we horses are subjected; for I was a \\\"job horse\\\", and was let out to all sorts of people who wished to hire me; and as I was good-tempered and gentle, I think I was oftener let out to the ignorant drivers than some of the other horses, because I could be depended upon.  It would take a long time to tell of all the different styles in which I was driven, but I will mention a few of them.\\n\\nFirst, there were the tight-rein drivers -- men who seemed to think that all depended on holding the reins as hard as they could, never relaxing the pull on the horse's mouth, or giving him the least liberty of movement. They are always talking about \\\"keeping the horse well in hand\\\", and \\\"holding a horse up\\\", just as if a horse was not made to hold himself up.\\n\\nSome poor, broken-down horses, whose mouths have been made hard and insensible by just such drivers as these, may, perhaps, find some support in it; but for a horse who can depend upon his own legs, and who has a tender mouth and is easily guided, it is not only tormenting, but it is stupid.\\n\\nThen there are the loose-rein drivers, who let the reins lie easily on our backs, and their own hand rest lazily on their knees.  Of course, such gentlemen have no control over a horse, if anything happens suddenly. If a horse shies, or starts, or stumbles, they are nowhere, and cannot help the horse or themselves till the mischief is done. Of course, for myself I had no objection to it, as I was not in the habit either of starting or stumbling, and had only been used to depend on my driver for guidance and encouragement.  Still, one likes to feel the rein a little in going downhill, and likes to know that one's driver is not gone to sleep.\\n\\nBesides, a slovenly way of driving gets a horse into bad and often lazy habits, and when he changes hands he has to be whipped out of them with more or less pain and trouble. Squire Gordon always kept us to our best paces and our best manners. He said that spoiling a horse and letting him get into bad habits was just as cruel as spoiling a child, and both had to suffer for it afterward.\\n\\nBesides, these drivers are often careless altogether, and will attend to anything else more than their horses. I went out in the phaeton one day with one of them; he had a lady and two children behind.  He flopped the reins about as we started, and of course gave me several unmeaning cuts with the whip, though I was fairly off.  There had been a good deal of road-mending going on, and even where the stones were not freshly laid down there were a great many loose ones about.  My driver was laughing and joking with the lady and the children, and talking about the country to the right and the left; but he never thought it worth while to keep an eye on his horse or to drive on the smoothest parts of the road; and so it easily happened that I got a stone in one of my fore feet.\\n\\nNow, if Mr. Gordon or John, or in fact any good driver, had been there, he would have seen that something was wrong before I had gone three paces. Or even if it had been dark a practiced hand would have felt by the rein that there was something wrong in the step, and they would have got down and picked out the stone.  But this man went on laughing and talking, while at every step the stone became more firmly wedged between my shoe and the frog of my foot.  The stone was sharp on the inside and round on the outside, which, as every one knows, is the most dangerous kind that a horse can pick up, at the same time cutting his foot and making him most liable to stumble and fall.\\n\\nWhether the man was partly blind or only very careless I can't say, but he drove me with that stone in my foot for a good half-mile before he saw anything.  By that time I was going so lame with the pain that at last he saw it, and called out, \\\"Well, here's a go!  Why, they have sent us out with a lame horse!  What a shame!\\\"\\n\\nHe then chucked the reins and flipped about with the whip, saying, \\\"Now, then, it's no use playing the old soldier with me; there's the journey to go, and it's no use turning lame and lazy.\\\"\\n\\nJust at this time a farmer came riding up on a brown cob. He lifted his hat and pulled up.\\n\\n\\\"I beg your pardon, sir,\\\" he said, \\\"but I think there is something the matter with your horse; he goes very much as if he had a stone in his shoe. If you will allow me I will look at his feet; these loose scattered stones are confounded dangerous things for the horses.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He's a hired horse,\\\" said my driver.  \\\"I don't know what's the matter with him, but it is a great shame to send out a lame beast like this.\\\"\\n\\nThe farmer dismounted, and slipping his rein over his arm at once took up my near foot.\\n\\n\\\"Bless me, there's a stone!  Lame!  I should think so!\\\"\\n\\nAt first he tried to dislodge it with his hand, but as it was now very tightly wedged he drew a stone-pick out of his pocket, and very carefully and with some trouble got it out.  Then holding it up he said, \\\"There, that's the stone your horse had picked up. It is a wonder he did not fall down and break his knees into the bargain!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, to be sure!\\\" said my driver; \\\"that is a queer thing! I never knew that horses picked up stones before.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Didn't you?\\\" said the farmer rather contemptuously; \\\"but they do, though, and the best of them will do it, and can't help it sometimes on such roads as these.  And if you don't want to lame your horse you must look sharp and get them out quickly.  This foot is very much bruised,\\\" he said, setting it gently down and patting me.  \\\"If I might advise, sir, you had better drive him gently for awhile; the foot is a good deal hurt, and the lameness will not go off directly.\\\"\\n\\nThen mounting his cob and raising his hat to the lady he trotted off.\\n\\nWhen he was gone my driver began to flop the reins about and whip the harness, by which I understood that I was to go on, which of course I did, glad that the stone was gone, but still in a good deal of pain.\\n\\nThis was the sort of experience we job horses often came in for.\\n\\n29      Cockneys\\n\\nThen there is the steam-engine style of driving; these drivers were mostly people from towns, who never had a horse of their own and generally traveled by rail.\\n\\nThey always seemed to think that a horse was something like a steam-engine, only smaller.  At any rate, they think that if only they pay for it a horse is bound to go just as far and just as fast and with just as heavy a load as they please.  And be the roads heavy and muddy, or dry and good; be they stony or smooth, uphill or downhill, it is all the same -- on, on, on, one must go, at the same pace, with no relief and no consideration.\\n\\nThese people never think of getting out to walk up a steep hill.  Oh, no, they have paid to ride, and ride they will!  The horse?  Oh, he's used to it! What were horses made for, if not to drag people uphill?  Walk! A good joke indeed!  And so the whip is plied and the rein is chucked and often a rough, scolding voice cries out, \\\"Go along, you lazy beast!\\\" And then another slash of the whip, when all the time we are doing our very best to get along, uncomplaining and obedient, though often sorely harassed and down-hearted.\\n\\nThis steam-engine style of driving wears us up faster than any other kind. I would far rather go twenty miles with a good considerate driver than I would go ten with some of these; it would take less out of me.\\n\\nAnother thing, they scarcely ever put on the brake, however steep the downhill may be, and thus bad accidents sometimes happen; or if they do put it on, they often forget to take it off at the bottom of the hill, and more than once I have had to pull halfway up the next hill, with one of the wheels held by the brake, before my driver chose to think about it; and that is a terrible strain on a horse.\\n\\nThen these cockneys, instead of starting at an easy pace, as a gentleman would do, generally set off at full speed from the very stable-yard; and when they want to stop, they first whip us, and then pull up so suddenly that we are nearly thrown on our haunches, and our mouths jagged with the bit -- they call that pulling up with a dash; and when they turn a corner they do it as sharply as if there were no right side or wrong side of the road.\\n\\nI well remember one spring evening I and Rory had been out for the day. (Rory was the horse that mostly went with me when a pair was ordered, and a good honest fellow he was.)  We had our own driver, and as he was always considerate and gentle with us, we had a very pleasant day. We were coming home at a good smart pace, about twilight. Our road turned sharp to the left; but as we were close to the hedge on our own side, and there was plenty of room to pass, our driver did not pull us in.  As we neared the corner I heard a horse and two wheels coming rapidly down the hill toward us.  The hedge was high, and I could see nothing, but the next moment we were upon each other. Happily for me, I was on the side next the hedge.  Rory was on the left side of the pole, and had not even a shaft to protect him. The man who was driving was making straight for the corner, and when he came in sight of us he had no time to pull over to his own side. The whole shock came upon Rory.  The gig shaft ran right into the chest, making him stagger back with a cry that I shall never forget. The other horse was thrown upon his haunches and one shaft broken. It turned out that it was a horse from our own stables, with the high-wheeled gig that the young men were so fond of.\\n\\nThe driver was one of those random, ignorant fellows, who don't even know which is their own side of the road, or, if they know, don't care. And there was poor Rory with his flesh torn open and bleeding, and the blood streaming down.  They said if it had been a little more to one side it would have killed him; and a good thing for him, poor fellow, if it had.\\n\\nAs it was, it was a long time before the wound healed, and then he was sold for coal-carting; and what that is, up and down those steep hills, only horses know.  Some of the sights I saw there, where a horse had to come downhill with a heavily loaded two-wheel cart behind him, on which no brake could be placed, make me sad even now to think of.\\n\\nAfter Rory was disabled I often went in the carriage with a mare named Peggy, who stood in the next stall to mine.  She was a strong, well-made animal, of a bright dun color, beautifully dappled, and with a dark-brown mane and tail.  There was no high breeding about her, but she was very pretty and remarkably sweet-tempered and willing. Still, there was an anxious look about her eye, by which I knew that she had some trouble.  The first time we went out together I thought she had a very odd pace; she seemed to go partly a trot, partly a canter, three or four paces, and then a little jump forward.\\n\\nIt was very unpleasant for any horse who pulled with her, and made me quite fidgety.  When we got home I asked her what made her go in that odd, awkward way.\\n\\n\\\"Ah,\\\" she said in a troubled manner, \\\"I know my paces are very bad, but what can I do?  It really is not my fault; it is just because my legs are so short.  I stand nearly as high as you, but your legs are a good three inches longer above your knee than mine, and of course you can take a much longer step and go much faster. You see I did not make myself.  I wish I could have done so; I would have had long legs then.  All my troubles come from my short legs,\\\" said Peggy, in a desponding tone.\\n\\n\\\"But how is it,\\\" I said, \\\"when you are so strong and good-tempered and willing?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, you see,\\\" said she, \\\"men will go so fast, and if one can't keep up to other horses it is nothing but whip, whip, whip, all the time. And so I have had to keep up as I could, and have got into this ugly shuffling pace.  It was not always so; when I lived with my first master I always went a good regular trot, but then he was not in such a hurry. He was a young clergyman in the country, and a good, kind master he was. He had two churches a good way apart, and a great deal of work, but he never scolded or whipped me for not going faster. He was very fond of me.  I only wish I was with him now; but he had to leave and go to a large town, and then I was sold to a farmer.\\n\\n\\\"Some farmers, you know, are capital masters; but I think this one was a low sort of man.  He cared nothing about good horses or good driving; he only cared for going fast.  I went as fast as I could, but that would not do, and he was always whipping; so I got into this way of making a spring forward to keep up.  On market nights he used to stay very late at the inn, and then drive home at a gallop.\\n\\n\\\"One dark night he was galloping home as usual, when all of a sudden the wheel came against some great heavy thing in the road, and turned the gig over in a minute.  He was thrown out and his arm broken, and some of his ribs, I think.  At any rate, it was the end of my living with him, and I was not sorry.  But you see it will be the same everywhere for me, if men must go so fast.  I wish my legs were longer!\\\"\\n\\nPoor Peggy!  I was very sorry for her, and I could not comfort her, for I knew how hard it was upon slow-paced horses to be put with fast ones; all the whipping comes to their share, and they can't help it.\\n\\nShe was often used in the phaeton, and was very much liked by some of the ladies, because she was so gentle; and some time after this she was sold to two ladies who drove themselves, and wanted a safe, good horse.\\n\\nI met her several times out in the country, going a good steady pace, and looking as gay and contented as a horse could be.  I was very glad to see her, for she deserved a good place.\\n\\nAfter she left us another horse came in her stead.  He was young, and had a bad name for shying and starting, by which he had lost a good place.  I asked him what made him shy.\\n\\n\\\"Well, I hardly know,\\\" he said.  \\\"I was timid when I was young, and was a good deal frightened several times, and if I saw anything strange I used to turn and look at it -- you see, with our blinkers one can't see or understand what a thing is unless one looks round -- and then my master always gave me a whipping, which of course made me start on, and did not make me less afraid.  I think if he would have let me just look at things quietly, and see that there was nothing to hurt me, it would have been all right, and I should have got used to them. One day an old gentleman was riding with him, and a large piece of white paper or rag blew across just on one side of me. I shied and started forward.  My master as usual whipped me smartly, but the old man cried out, \\\\`You're wrong! you're wrong! You should never whip a horse for shying; he shies because he is frightened, and you only frighten him more and make the habit worse.' So I suppose all men don't do so.  I am sure I don't want to shy for the sake of it; but how should one know what is dangerous and what is not, if one is never allowed to get used to anything? I am never afraid of what I know.  Now I was brought up in a park where there were deer; of course I knew them as well as I did a sheep or a cow, but they are not common, and I know many sensible horses who are frightened at them, and who kick up quite a shindy before they will pass a paddock where there are deer.\\\"\\n\\nI knew what my companion said was true, and I wished that every young horse had as good masters as Farmer Grey and Squire Gordon.\\n\\nOf course we sometimes came in for good driving here.  I remember one morning I was put into the light gig, and taken to a house in Pulteney Street. Two gentlemen came out; the taller of them came round to my head; he looked at the bit and bridle, and just shifted the collar with his hand, to see if it fitted comfortably.\\n\\n\\\"Do you consider this horse wants a curb?\\\" he said to the hostler.\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said the man, \\\"I should say he would go just as well without; he has an uncommon good mouth, and though he has a fine spirit he has no vice; but we generally find people like the curb.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't like it,\\\" said the gentleman; \\\"be so good as to take it off, and put the rein in at the cheek.  An easy mouth is a great thing on a long journey, is it not, old fellow?\\\" he said, patting my neck.\\n\\nThen he took the reins, and they both got up.  I can remember now how quietly he turned me round, and then with a light feel of the rein, and drawing the whip gently across my back, we were off.\\n\\nI arched my neck and set off at my best pace.  I found I had some one behind me who knew how a good horse ought to be driven. It seemed like old times again, and made me feel quite gay.\\n\\nThis gentleman took a great liking to me, and after trying me several times with the saddle he prevailed upon my master to sell me to a friend of his, who wanted a safe, pleasant horse for riding. And so it came to pass that in the summer I was sold to Mr. Barry.\\n\\n30      A Thief\\n\\nMy new master was an unmarried man.  He lived at Bath, and was much engaged in business.  His doctor advised him to take horse exercise, and for this purpose he bought me.  He hired a stable a short distance from his lodgings, and engaged a man named Filcher as groom. My master knew very little about horses, but he treated me well, and I should have had a good and easy place but for circumstances of which he was ignorant.  He ordered the best hay with plenty of oats, crushed beans, and bran, with vetches, or rye grass, as the man might think needful.  I heard the master give the order, so I knew there was plenty of good food, and I thought I was well off.\\n\\nFor a few days all went on well.  I found that my groom understood his business.  He kept the stable clean and airy, and he groomed me thoroughly; and was never otherwise than gentle. He had been an hostler in one of the great hotels in Bath. He had given that up, and now cultivated fruit and vegetables for the market, and his wife bred and fattened poultry and rabbits for sale. After awhile it seemed to me that my oats came very short; I had the beans, but bran was mixed with them instead of oats, of which there were very few; certainly not more than a quarter of what there should have been. In two or three weeks this began to tell upon my strength and spirits. The grass food, though very good, was not the thing to keep up my condition without corn.  However, I could not complain, nor make known my wants. So it went on for about two months; and I wondered that my master did not see that something was the matter.  However, one afternoon he rode out into the country to see a friend of his, a gentleman farmer, who lived on the road to Wells.\\n\\nThis gentleman had a very quick eye for horses; and after he had welcomed his friend he said, casting his eye over me:\\n\\n\\\"It seems to me, Barry, that your horse does not look so well as he did when you first had him; has he been well?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I believe so,\\\" said my master; \\\"but he is not nearly so lively as he was; my groom tells me that horses are always dull and weak in the autumn, and that I must expect it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Autumn, fiddlesticks!\\\" said the farmer.  \\\"Why, this is only August; and with your light work and good food he ought not to go down like this, even if it was autumn.  How do you feed him?\\\"\\n\\nMy master told him.  The other shook his head slowly, and began to feel me over.\\n\\n\\\"I can't say who eats your corn, my dear fellow, but I am much mistaken if your horse gets it.  Have you ridden very fast?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, very gently.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then just put your hand here,\\\" said he, passing his hand over my neck and shoulder; \\\"he is as warm and damp as a horse just come up from grass. I advise you to look into your stable a little more. I hate to be suspicious, and, thank heaven, I have no cause to be, for I can trust my men, present or absent; but there are mean scoundrels, wicked enough to rob a dumb beast of his food.  You must look into it.\\\" And turning to his man, who had come to take me, \\\"Give this horse a right good feed of bruised oats, and don't stint him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dumb beasts!\\\"  Yes, we are; but if I could have spoken I could have told my master where his oats went to.  My groom used to come every morning about six o'clock, and with him a little boy, who always had a covered basket with him.  He used to go with his father into the harness-room, where the corn was kept, and I could see them, when the door stood ajar, fill a little bag with oats out of the bin, and then he used to be off.\\n\\nFive or six mornings after this, just as the boy had left the stable, the door was pushed open, and a policeman walked in, holding the child tight by the arm; another policeman followed, and locked the door on the inside, saying, \\\"Show me the place where your father keeps his rabbits' food.\\\"\\n\\nThe boy looked very frightened and began to cry; but there was no escape, and he led the way to the corn-bin.  Here the policeman found another empty bag like that which was found full of oats in the boy's basket.\\n\\nFilcher was cleaning my feet at the time, but they soon saw him, and though he blustered a good deal they walked him off to the \\\"lock-up\\\", and his boy with him.  I heard afterward that the boy was not held to be guilty, but the man was sentenced to prison for two months.\",\"timestamp\":1641282857,\"title\":\"\\nGinger was saddled and sent off in great haste for Lord George\"},\"digest\":\"oJ_hfW36L67Th8FpA07495eS_ilwjwUP0zadrApxxi4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x24afE23f920156bA8F2a4d44dC48E4796972746b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"T8_aVKG9WrFstT3ykGOQDnQdHKPxW3qb85AhXI7_VPI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AF2FoBieBQP0eZ8NP5EZafk_97VDshSJj9Nu7Az9r0o\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"kkwl_VKRy7B6YTXJ4BOnf-K_PeRaaz0e3av142cTsp0THv8US7FlJmDvgR0cxm8ADov-3y05xBqWcuuhWU6dNg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x84285a281dc6291e9f10f104e0722b9f79b38a729a063ead72e8589a9787add4259730f5d32a960fd5745a434aff86f7abb7a3512271408858f0f2f53fdbf6991b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"T8_aVKG9WrFstT3ykGOQDnQdHKPxW3qb85AhXI7_VPI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AF2FoBieBQP0eZ8NP5EZafk_97VDshSJj9Nu7Az9r0o\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"oJ_hfW36L67Th8FpA07495eS_ilwjwUP0zadrApxxi4\"}"
