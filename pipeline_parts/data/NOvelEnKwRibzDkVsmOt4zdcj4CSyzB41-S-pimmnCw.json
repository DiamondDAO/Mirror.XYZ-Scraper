"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"As we are approaching the end of our first week as a DAO the team has been preparing various project documents, including the first official draft of the Roadmap and Mission Statement. With growing demand for Founding Member tokens, it is critical to the project’s success that we establish our fundamental guiding documents.\\n\\n*These documents have been successfully ratified via [Snapshot vote.](https://snapshot.org/#/muse.eth/)*\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Uh2moBF_F3JzS7SY7dUnn.jpg?height=703&width=1716)\\n\\n## MUSE dao Mission Statement (draft until vote)\\n\\n> Our purpose as an organization is to revolutionize the human experience of art through the curation and production of multi-sensory virtual/physical hybrid exhibits, with the ultimate goal of connecting likeminded artists, musicians, programmers, entrepreneurs, and makers.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jMEDmmDzbtRYAjWsn-tTs.jpg?height=703&width=1716)\\n\\n## Roadmap\\n\\n### Q1 2021\\n\\nRegister MUSE.eth ENS domain, begin privately collecting and creating NFTs. (√)  Fund first external project as a centralized, Ethereum art gallery. (√)\\n\\nEstablish groundwork for physical realm art experiences by purchasing land in several locations around the USA. (√) This land is currently held in an LLC separate from the DAO, but it is our eventual goal to link the two so that MUSE dao has complete governance and ownership control over the land.\\n\\n### Q2 2021\\n\\nRe-visit NFT market with fresh funds and make a series of targeted acquisitions. (√)\\n\\nBegin solidifying in-house collections with additional artist input and initiation of a marketing budget. (√)\\n\\n### Q3 2021\\n\\nEstablish critical partnerships. (√)\\n\\nRecruit founding members to the team, solidify connections within the NFT space locally and globally, and learn as much as possible about achieving decentrality through the formation of a DAO. (√)\\n\\n### Q4 2021\\n\\nComplete final NFT acquisitions as a centralized gallery, with a primary focus on Metaverse real estate. (√)\\n\\nLaunch MUSE dao Founding Member tokens, granting ownership and governance rights over the DAO to a core group of up to one hundred hodlers. (√)\\n\\nLaunch Snapshot proposal creation and election system, with all Founding Member tokens granted one vote each. (√)\\n\\nPublish all project documentation, Roadmap, Mission Statement, and MUSE dao White Paper. (in progress)\\n\\n### Q1 2022\\n\\nAnnounce first luxury brand partnership with the dao and begin series of proposals to construct their brand experience in the metaverse.\\n\\nOnboard 3D artists to begin developing series of tokenized luxury goods, such as colognes, fine clothing, and bags.\\n\\nBecome fully decentralized by implementing multi-sig functionality on the muse.eth wallet, and voting on the eligible signers.\\n\\nPublicly launch the MUSE dao NFT World, contingent on the launch of multiplayer functionality by the dev team at NFT Worlds. All token holders will be eligible to claim ownership of virtual real estate air drops within our world, with holders of a larger quantity of tokens rewarded with more desirable air drops. The DAO will propose and vote on the fairest distribution formula, and we will propose to include a degree of randomness so that even holders of only one token can have a chance at top tier virtual real estate. Some examples of potential ownership include: apartment flat - most common, 800 available; house - rare, 150 available; mansion - ultra rare, 30 available; underground lair - legendary, 10 available; penthouse - elite, 7 available; castle - royal, 3 available.\\n\\nComplete sale of initial round of 100 Founding Member tokens. Propose and vote on quantity of regular member tokens to make available, list price, and distribution schedule.\\n\\nComplete construction of the Discord and build-out of a standardized proposal initiation process.\\n\\nComplete audit on wallet holdings to ensure funds are being invested and staked optimally.\\n\\n### Q2 2022\\n\\nBegin gathering proposals for the DAO’s first large investment, grant, or project of other sorts, likely 5-10 ETH.\\n\\nPropose and vote on launch of luxury brand experience on one of our metaverse real estate holdings, most likely Sandbox or NFT Worlds.\\n\\nPropose and vote on launch of tokenized luxury goods, powered by MUSE dao.\\n\\nPropose and vote on projects or staking to initiate on all unused metaverse holdings.\\n\\nRegister LLC in the State of Wyoming to be governed by the DAO, setting up the potential for tokenized land ownership distributed to all DAO members.\\n\\nEstablish panel within the DAO tasked with seeking and forming valuable relationships for the DAO.\\n\\nEstablish formal schedule and roadmap moving forward, perhaps adopting a ‘season’ structure popular amongst other DAOs.\\n\\n### Q3 2022 and Beyond\\n\\nContinue to grow as we move closer toward our goal of producing the most mind-melting, multi-sensory, reality bending art experience the world has ever witnessed. Join the team now and become a part of this exciting project by purchasing at least one Founding Member token.
