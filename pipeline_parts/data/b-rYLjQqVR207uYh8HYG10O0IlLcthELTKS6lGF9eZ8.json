"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"THE END OF THE BEGINNING\\n\\n1999 into 2000 - New Year’s Eve into New Year’s Day\\n\\nBoris Yeltsin survived multiple challenges to his authority. There was a coup attempt, several gun battles, a painful debt default, and turnover is his cabinet - Russia was a turbulent power in transition.\\n\\nYeltsin was not a saint but he was a survivor, and wanted to ensure a succession of his choice. His choice was Vladimir Putin. The system which followed when the handover was made at when the new year arrived was both a condemnation and reaffirmation of the change from the Soviet Union to the Russian Federation.\\n\\nThe Y2K Bug was the worry that a decision to save on computer memory would result in disaster for any major infrastructure which relied on aging computing software. All for saving 2 digits on dates.\\n\\nA generation of semi-retired COBOL programmers were called in over the preceding years to prevent disaster. The silence which followed when the new year arrived was proof to both sides of success and a nonissue.\\n\\nThe heat of the Nasdaq Tech hardware \\\"TMT\\\" market charged upwards, despite the worries, years before by the Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, of \\\"irrational exhuberance\\\".\\n\\nEven George Soros' one time successor, Stan Druckenmiller, struggled to both not chase and not be be led by the relentless rise of the ultra growth story market. The silence, without a crash so far, when the new year arrived was proof to both sides of success and mania.\\n\\nOne network was gone, the USSR passed into the Federation, and a divided Europe became the European Union and the united slavic states of Yugoslavia were divided into new countries.\\n\\nThe United States emerged as the sole superpower, with a peace dividend, and a generation with no memory of the bear markets and hardships of the late 1960s and 1970s post-Vietnam stagflation.\\n\\nIt was the end of the beginning of a new era, a great decentralization was beginning over the coming decades.\\n\\n**2877 Earth, The Necklace, Old Foundry District**\\n\\nThe fight was over the moment the doors were blasted open by the stranger. The ringing in my ears began to fade.\\n\\nAndreea was stunned but coming out of it. The Stranger towered over everyone.\\n\\n\\\"The 'Dowager' sent you all the way here?\\\", asked the Messenger. The Stranger answered, \\\"The Dowager knows you were responsible, and respects your initiative. But a message has to be sent to operators in the System. Nobody steals from us.\\n\\nThe Stranger's people took \\\"the Messenger\\\" away. The Stranger turned to me. \\\"Commander, we're leaving before Inspector Field, arrives. You could have left with the device, why didn't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I made a promise to Andreea, I wasn't leaving her to face this alone.\\\"\\n\\nI didn't bother explaining what it was like to dream of my wife and son, both dead, and that I couldn’t save them when they needed me.\\n\\nThe Stranger nodded good-bye to me and Andreea.\\n\\nThe Necklace, Spaceport, Earth to Mars departure gate:\\n\\nInspector Field walked with us, and gave me a gift of spring water.\\n\\n\\\"We got some of crew but not the real \\\"boss, that Dowager has her now. At least this crew is done. That will have to be enough. I wanted to ask on last thing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What is it Inspector?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A lot of trouble came with this peripheral. What kind of data is on this thing?\\\"\\n\\nI paused, then I shook hands with the Inspector. Andreea then shook his hand.\\n\\n\\\"Good-bye, Inspector.\\\"\\n\\nArrival at Mars:\\n\\nAndreea and I shared one last toast of Earth water. Almost home.\\n\\n\\\"I got a message from my grandfather, our family is safe, I'm grateful to your friends for watching over them. What will you do now?”\\n\\n\\\"I have an old friend who has an idea for me. We'll see.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"One more toast. I hope we'll meet again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We'll see.\\\"\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*EPILOGUE\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\\\*\\\\*THE TYRANNY OF PETTY THINGS\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\nAfter the Great War, fighter pilots returned home to a country that was just discovering the magic of flight.\\n\\nBarely 20 years had passed since Kitty Hawk, and for a few years there was an unregulated golden age of air daredevils.\\n\\nThe pilots bought military surplus planes, which they trained with years ago, and became entertainers, mail carriers, and smugglers - sometimes all three.\\n\\nThe barnstormers traveled from town to town, like travelling circuses - escapees from post-war prisons of day to day life.\\n\\n**\\\"I fly because it releases my mind from the tyranny of petty things.” — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry**\\n\\n**2X21 minus 41, 2880, MARS, The \\\"Graveyard of Wings\\\" (BlueX)** \\n\\nJacob's head hurt. June dumped water on him to wake him.\\n\\n\\\"Where are you taking me, June? Can I take this thing off?”\\n\\n\\\"Just a few more steps Jacob. That's it. Okay.\\\"\\n\\nJune Birmingham takes a sack off of Jacob C. Tagore Sr's helmet.\\n\\n\\\"Why are we here June?\\\"\\n\\nIn front of them is a medium sized ship, along side a flock of smaller mannable drones. Decommissioned military surplus.\\n\\n\\\"You remember. You flew a lot of birds during the War.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Flew a lot of things, a lot of places. Did a lot of things.\\\"\\n\\nJacob's mind drifted backwards to those places, things - it was too much. He turned away but June grabbed his arm.\\n\\n\\\"You can fly this. This time you can fly it for you and yours.”\\n\\\"What are you doing June?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Grand Vote meant a Grand Halt to some big things. But not all things. It's a free for all in the System now. The War tore our old lives apart. We can put it and ourselves back. We don't have to be trapped. Stimmed or streaming to help us sleep. We can live. On our terms. We choose.\\\"\\n\\n**\\\"Let's call \\\"her\\\" ‘Magpie’.\\\" Jacob had just christened his new life and new ship.**\\n\\n[https://audius.co/harrisonwillcox/a-decentralized-future](https://audius.co/harrisonwillcox/a-decentralized-future)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MW67xJtGaWVgqdkWvKKUi.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kfZbgde4NoTZG5Uac6CWS.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Xa-DwKLd0LV6I2jZd-E0u.png?height=2400&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1636268916,\"title\":\"1999 7.30 The End of the Beginning\"},\"digest\":\"HYaeMYzbT_IZcmanzyEnHALQPcgmGx5z3Yob2bhIbYs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cp69EkVmGPN56udTPoj_01QpW6eGaXZ1zbeS531jad8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zYwhIf2jaKC_Er3nNncHMRuE7eXBXlkdLz-3zM8ikGE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"kh_UCDk5-9-5TUEPwIO66h2rnq9pmRNaBE7m1Vd1WdSil3JiBHb9Nw_q2tyFyw8aQgeOsWexebGUiz48AqfwxQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe4c1bcaa88b6fe2c67d195f4a76d1a91640647a2c63ec8f8083673f941e8ee412d804077222237104c51130677298bdcb163cbc3b2eb0bb6193f6b825a8e06141c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cp69EkVmGPN56udTPoj_01QpW6eGaXZ1zbeS531jad8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zYwhIf2jaKC_Er3nNncHMRuE7eXBXlkdLz-3zM8ikGE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"2NtMDlhXY3IhTC57K4ZO-FpWHoTbBnqrxSB5uWz3-0c\"}"
