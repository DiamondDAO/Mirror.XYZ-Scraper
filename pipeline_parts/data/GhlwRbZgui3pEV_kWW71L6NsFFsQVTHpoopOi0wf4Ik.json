"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"My working spirit has gone through three stages: I am not afraid of being tired, I am not afraid of being tired, and I am not afraid of being tired! When some children are studying in school, they are in a mess. It’s okay.\\n\\nSociety, just become a workaholic. This is more rewarding than being a learning freak in school. All complicated money-making models are useless models and models that do not make money.\\n\\nWe entrepreneurs only pursue the simplest model. As long as this thing is complicated, we don't play it. Making money is to make things simple, not to pursue complexity. For example, Ma Yun's Taobao website makes it easy for small and medium-sized enterprises to sell things, so Ma Yun makes money.\\n\\nIt's just one thing for a company to make money. Do everything possible to improve your efficiency. You can make a lot of money, which is actually the idea of ​​looking for business opportunities. In other words, you can help others improve the efficiency of work, ok, you just wait to collect the money.\\n\\nWhat I tell you every day is to make money, but I hope you all know that successful companies are never made for the purpose of making money. I personally got it for the purpose of self-achievement, and I told you about these experiences to straighten out my own thinking. By the way, some people gave me money. I also made a QQ entrepreneurship circle, so I made a little money by the way. What is the ultimate goal for everyone to start a business? Think about it. But successful companies definitely make money.\\n\\nPeople who do not understand the value of exchange will never understand business. Yesterday someone asked me what is the nature of business? I think it is value exchange. The development history of civilization is the development history of transactions. The more frequent the transactions, the more developed they are. On the contrary, the poor have never traded with a few people in their lives, so they are poor. The more you trade, the richer you are. Whether it is an exchange of ideas or a material transaction, it will make you rich.\\n\\nWe live in a society and cannot survive independently. Therefore, we need to cooperate with each other. Use the strengths and achievements of others for your own use. Of course this requires you to pay for it\\n\\nEntrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs 115\\n\\nPrice in exchange for the fruits of other people’s labor, or in exchange for other people’s help. The essence of business society is exchange. It is impossible for a person who does not know how to give something that is valuable to others to make money. Because he does not understand the nature of business, he is unwilling to exchange. He only wants to ask for it, which is a typical brain damage. In other words, people who don't know how to contribute to society will definitely not make money.\\n\\nSomeone asked me, how can I make a lot of money, and I replied: \\\"Change yourself and always find ways to improve and correct yourself. If you are poor, why not learn, why not change your routine? Why not learn from the strong? Repeating those stupid life rhythms year after year. Then there is only no money, what else do you want?\\\" There is a saying in the biography: \\\"Easy to be poor will change, change will lead to success, and change will lead to long.\\\" Change it.\\n\\nWe entrepreneurs must conform to the market and never try to change things in the market. Although my most respected person, Jobs said: \\\"To live is to change the world!\\\" But I dare not say, I only dare to say: \\\"To live is to make money!\\\"\\n\\nAs a boss, a leader, never let the people who are with you look uncomfortable with you. In this case, it is useless for you to say anything. If this happens, either he gets out or you get out. If you are awesome, then he just has to roll, that's all.\\n\\nCommunicate with peers, communicate with subordinates, 70% are emotions, and 30% are content. So we can see a lot of leaders who are bull-breaking. In fact, what he said is useless. But everyone is passionate, why? Because he has 70% of things in play. This is the most awesome. Leaders must be masters who are good at mobilizing everyone's emotions. Humans are not robots, humans are animals with emotions.\\n\\nTherefore, learning psychology well is also a weapon for being a boss. Managing people is to solve people's psychological problems. If everyone's psychological problems can be solved, then everything will be easier to handle.\\n\\nI think leaders and entrepreneurs only solve two problems, the first problem is of course everyone\\n\\n116 Entrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs\\n\\nCan make money. The second problem is the atmosphere of the entire company, that is, the emotional problems of the team members. After the emotional problems of the team members are resolved, everyone's combat effectiveness has exploded. You don't have to worry about anything, just collect the money and go to sleep.\\n\\nEntrepreneurs must read more. Now I am reading, what I am most afraid of is reading books written in rubbish. Reading only the books of ancient philosophers at home and abroad is a bit unpleasant. I had to increase my discrimination, and if I bought a junk book, I would throw it away immediately. Some books have good introductions, but in fact, it is a waste of time to look at the contents.\\n\\nOur energies should be to discuss how to do things well, not to discuss strategies, the future of the company, and directions. These are all fucking things. Once the things are done well, we have everything, strategy, future, direction. No need to discuss. These things serve to make money, so what we have to do in the end is to do the work well and make money. It's okay, I'm an extremely pragmatic short-sighted person, but only with this kind of philosophy can I make some money.\\n\\nThe Chinese are very conservative. No matter what they do, it takes a long time to warm up, which is not bad. Some people have already passed the trend of the times, and they have only become hot, or in other words, they have not yet become hot. Yesterday someone asked me to talk about opening an online store and talking about Taobao. In this modern era, this knowledge is a waste of time. The era does not belong to Taobao entrepreneurs anymore.\\n\\nThere is only wisdom in this world that is the most valuable, mixed with the wisdom of society. If you still don’t have money, you have to exchange your poor little money for this wisdom. How many people can see through such a simple truth, and can do it!\\n\\nWhen we are bosses, we always have to think about a question, that is, why others are willing to mix with you. In fact, this is a question of wisdom, why others should take the initiative to work. Instead of you to manage him, force him. I am through decentralization of powers and interests. Divide the names, and try to get them out if you can. To satisfy the capable people, the leader is the one who must be followed by others, not the one who forces others to obey.\\n\\nOne of my beliefs is that I want people who follow me to be better than me. I become the most rubbish\\n\\nEntrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs 117\\n\\nThat person, but I have been working hard. I hope that the person I am mixing with is either talented or better than me. Isn't it just making money? Isn't it possible to do this well? Zhu Yuanzhang has beaten the world! Conquering the world is certainly not a matter of Zhu Yuanzhang alone. So, what you have to think about as a boss is how to let people mix with you.\\n\\nMany entrepreneurs think that their environment, employees, and business are not ideal. I think that my corporate environment and employees are ideal, and as a result everything has developed in the ideal direction. What you radiate from your heart will directly affect the atmosphere of the company and the emotions of employees. Therefore, entrepreneurs must adjust their mentality.\\n\\nMost of my energy is actually analyzing myself. Our human energy is very precious. We don't need to distribute our energy to others. If you analyze yourself thoroughly, you will understand when you look at other people. With heart-to-heart, making money is simple, and becoming a boss is smooth.\\n\\nWhy do I oppose the boss' emphasis on technology? Because a boss does not need to know a lot of technology to make money. The most important thing for the boss is to cultivate his own mentality, secondly to practice communication skills, and finally to learn skills and knowledge. So illiterate can be a big boss, as long as he has a good mentality.\\n\\nIt is not a bad thing for a person to have many thoughts, but if you think too much, things will not be done. You should think about how to do a good job of your own project instead of thinking about things that are not related to making money or the project.\\n\\nIn fact, everyone's potential is extremely huge. It is really easy to make money. It depends on whether you can get up with it, overcome your inertia, and dare to try.\\n\\nThere was a guy who wanted to start a business, and he asked me what I should learn. I said, you have to learn everything, because you are the boss. But the purpose of learning is not to do it, but to ask others to do it.\\n\\nThe purpose of learning is to shorten the gap with others. The more idiots, the poor, the less they like to learn, and they think that learning is useless. The brains of idiots and theories are more amusing. My philosophy is to communicate less than idiots.\\n\\n118 Entrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs\\n\\nFinally, I would like to say a few words to the students who are about to graduate: In the graduation season, many students said that they are very confused, in entrepreneurship, postgraduate entrance examination, civil servants and entering enterprises.\\n\\nIt is difficult to choose between industries. Greed makes you miserable. If you want to make money, you are afraid of risks. If you want to be stable, you feel poor. My suggestion is that if you still want to learn, don't give up the opportunity to learn. In society, there are almost no opportunities for systematic learning. At school, you are all about studying. Don't waste time participating in social practice. The time in the future will let you practice enough! Regarding employment and entrepreneurship, my advice is if your parents live above the middle class in society, you should listen to them, yes! If you live at the bottom of society, just listen to yourself. Too many parents impose their own wrong life experience on their children in the name of love.
