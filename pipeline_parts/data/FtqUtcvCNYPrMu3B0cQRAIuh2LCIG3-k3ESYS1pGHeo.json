"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"One of the best moments of my life was behind a microphone as a rapper. It was a rush of emotions unlike any other Iâ€™ve experienced - fully present and connected with a community of fans, friends, and family.\\n\\nNow Iâ€™m going to be behind a microphone again, but this time as a podcaster.\\n\\nHere is why Iâ€™m leaving code for content and how a childhood dream of being a rapper inspired me to take the leap into web3 full time.\\n\\n![Left: MJx Music | Right: Justwavyj](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/52HLxQcgHhqes9EPeJNVS.JPG?height=1367&width=2048)\\n\\nThe idea of being a rapper has always captured my imagination. The ability to build a community, be endlessly creative, and connect with people through your words in an educational and inspirational way were pillars of work that I was drawn to.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/justwavyj/status/388771942901501953?s=20](https://twitter.com/justwavyj/status/388771942901501953?s=20)\\n\\nIâ€™ve learned that making music is not my strong suit, but I do have skills that translate well to a creative role. I spent years working at the intersection of music and community in my free time - [making music videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJD9YcwJeRM) that have gotten hundreds of thousands of views, organizing shows, and being a hype-man / DJ at [MJx Music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3Cg0rSSfCzV3tJZQyaKlRX?si=urewkm7tTz2hCluHydkstw) concerts (ðŸ‘†  ðŸ“¸  ).\\n\\nThen in late 2020, I got a message from a friend starting a music NFT company, [Mint Songs](https://www.mintsongs.com/). He sent me the pitch deck and asked if I had any thoughts on it as well as if there were potential collaboration opportunities with artists in my network. That deck was my first in-depth exposure to NFTs and from that point on I became fascinated about the innovation coming from the web3 ecosystem. After a year of experimenting, learning, and collecting NFTs - I landed a part-time job with Mint Songs to create the [GM METAVERSE podcast.](https://open.spotify.com/show/23yd3fgjMkeIl3oskvFXsT?si=c25a2517c79f4f9c) I did this while still working full-time in web2.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/justwavyj/status/1447690839950381056?s=20](https://twitter.com/justwavyj/status/1447690839950381056?s=20)\\n\\nYears of experience creating music focused content led to my first web3 role. I kicked off season 1 of the podcast and had insightful conversations with leaders in the music NFT space ranging from artists, entrepreneurs, and investors. This experience has proved to be pivotal in my career. I experienced first hand how being a podcast host is similar to many of the qualities I admired from that of a rapper or musician. I built community by facilitating conversations that were informative and inspirational to artists around the world looking to break into web3. I expressed myself creatively through [writing on Twitter](https://twitter.com/justwavyj/status/1442149468795588608?s=20). And I connected with people who were curious and passionate about the same topic I was.  On top of all that - it led me to another opportunity and the reason behind why I am writing this article.\\n\\n**Iâ€™m stoked to announce that Iâ€™m now working full time in web3 at [Unstoppable Domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/)!**\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/justwavyj/status/1472006570695270400?s=20](https://twitter.com/justwavyj/status/1472006570695270400?s=20)\\n\\nI joined Unstoppable as their new[ Podcast Host](https://open.spotify.com/show/2ZlyOpkkprGKS5KODk1PSS?si=a007ea61ad4a4a75) with the goal of educating the world about web3 - the benefits to consumers, the rapid innovation happening across all industries, and the applications that will transform how we exist online and bridge our physical and digital lives.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/ReeseW/status/1480953798013054976?s=20](https://twitter.com/ReeseW/status/1480953798013054976?s=20)\\n\\nI believe in the ethos of crypto and the value that can be brought to people around the world through decentralized, trustless, and composable applications. **For web3 to reach its potential, education is foundational to driving global adoption.**\\n\\nThis is an exciting transition for me, but the decision also represents a big change from the career Iâ€™ve been developing in web2. Iâ€™m figuring a lot of things out as I go, but thought my experience might resonate with others.\\n\\nSince graduating college 5 years ago, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work at the edge of technologies that are changing our world. And honestly - going deep on any of them would lead to meaningful and impactful careers. I started my career working on VR experiences to optimize human performance and most recently was building AI models to unlock value and predictive insights for companies.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1476439747350253570?s=20](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1476439747350253570?s=20)\\n\\n**Now, Iâ€™ll be educating the world about the power of web3 and working for a company with the incredibly bold mission to transform how we exist online in the future.**\\n\\nIâ€™m making two big changes:\\n\\n1. Foundational technological change: AI â€”> crypto\\n2. Functional career change: code â€”> content\\n\\nIt was difficult to leave my technical data science and AI role for a content one. [Chris Dixonâ€™s essay](https://cdixon.org/2009/09/19/climbing-the-wrong-hill) on climbing the wrong hill really resonates with me. I was climbing the hill at a fast growing AI startup, ready to vest for 4 years, and climb an established and respected career path. But I noticed something - even though I had gotten what I thought was a fantastic job - my focus was elsewhere.\\n\\n**web3 captured my curiosity.**\\n\\nThe innovation and experimentation coming out of the crypto space on a daily basis is fascinating. I knew I wanted to be a part of it. I had identified the highest hill, and didnâ€™t want to waste any more time on my current one, regardless of how secure and opportunistic the next step appeared.\\n\\nIâ€™ve been fitting into the mold of the educational system and professional world for a long time. And while Iâ€™ve always had interests in creative work and dabbled in it on the side, the idea of being a content creator - whether that's making videos on YouTube, providing entertaining streams on Twitch, or educating people through podcasts - has traditionally been discounted as a career. I think thatâ€™s changing though and how we work, learn, and live in the future will not look as it did in the past.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/naval/status/1264438221741518848?s=20Â ](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1264438221741518848?s=20)\\n\\nSo with this opportunity at my fingertips, and a mind full of uncertainty and some self-doubt, I dmâ€™d[ Balaji](https://twitter.com/balajis) and he hit me with this:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/justwavyj/status/1467249844926312449?s=20](https://twitter.com/justwavyj/status/1467249844926312449?s=20)\\n\\nJust as code can run in the background and scale infinitely - so can content. And as the world upskills from a technical perspective, I think there's a massive opportunity to focus on building skills rooted in creativity. Being able to create meaningful content that is educational, inspirational, or entertaining is a skill that I am betting on (also Iâ€™m a pretty average data scientist lol).\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002107377598873600?s=20](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002107377598873600?s=20)\\n\\nIn a world where everything is a click away and attention is divided up among a million competing notifications and dopamine vampires, the content we consume and create becomes increasingly important.\\n\\n**web3 encapsulates a world of innovation that can touch lives globally. And for true impact to be felt across geographies, diverse demographics, and financial tiers - being a voice to amplify why web3 matters, teaching others to become crypto literate, and creating tools that empower people to become self-sovereign is an important role and one that Iâ€™m grateful to grow into in 2022.**\\n\\nIâ€™m sincerely looking forward to the work that needs to be done and to everyone who Iâ€™ll be able to connect with in the process. If youâ€™d like to follow along, Iâ€™ll be exploring web3 and sharing what I learn along the way on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/justwavyj) and on the [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/2ZlyOpkkprGKS5KODk1PSS?si=ada99408cfe34f66).\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nI also wanted to give a huge shoutout to [Diana Chen](https://twitter.com/ddwchen) who did a fantastic job growing The Unstoppable Podcast from 0 â†’ 1 over the last year.
