"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Statues tell stories.\\n\\nThey raise up particular people and events, visions and values, into figures of permanence for all to see.\\n\\nThey can inspire pride, harmony, resentment and hate.\\n\\nThey are often, but not always, installed by governments to record specific moments in time.\\n\\nThe idea that statues must be protected from protestors is now being promoted by certain factions. States will defend these stale expressions of historical opinion, even as they rankle, divide and drive citizens to deface them.\\n\\nYet the public arena that they occupy is a shared space, a commons which is curated by multiple actors in concert. The government is just one such actor, and one that recedes from the role as steward of culture when it cuts spending on public services.\\n\\n## Government puts statues before rights\\n\\nBoris Johnson’s government gives its idea of modern justice in the 2021 Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill.\\n\\nThis legislation, championed by Home Secretary Priti Patel, demolishes the rights of protestors, traveller communities, and others who already face serious harm from the police and state, whilst giving a boost to statues.\\n\\nA Daily Telegraph [commentator explains that](https://web.archive.org/web/20210318044548/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/15/policing-bill-affront-liberty-labour-right-oppose/) “…\\\\[Priti’s\\\\] bill…grants the police an unprecedented ability to proscribe fundamental freedoms of protest, association and speech.”\\n\\n[It is argued that](https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/16/under-priti-patels-rule-even-the-suffragettes-would-be-silenced-10927069/) this law would’ve silenced the suffragettes, who fought for women’s right to vote by disrupting our streets for what we know was right, and what the government forcefully denied them.\\n\\n![Study for what a statue of Priti Patel might look like.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iP_MlSh2D93pijfuFlPcx.jpg?height=1440&width=1770)\\n\\nIt bolsters protection for statues such that punishment for vandalising them [could become tougher than for rape](https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/kit-malthouse-sarah-everard-clapham-vigil-policing-bill-defending-statues).\\n\\nAll this as authorities fail to act on the urgent issues of our time, dawdling, for example, on climate change action that needs to be taken now.\\n\\nWhen government is unable to do what the public knows it must and, worse, legislates to stop protestors from forcing its hand, we say that the system is structurally broken – something must change.\\n\\n## New public services change the game\\n\\nToday, we are seeing the appearance of new kinds of public services, with [swarms of online citizens ever more equipped to manage resources, culture and social goods](https://otherinter.net/research/positive-sum-worlds/) in ways that governments fail to.\\n\\nWeb3 offers tools for this: From universal basic income trials, to governance software for businesses and local groups, these experiments are happening, stumbling along, facing criticism, learning, growing, and making progress that is currently blocked by backward-looking incumbents.\\n\\n![Whilst Patel stands as the ruthless face of this clampdown on rights, that nasty homunculus Boris Johnson mutters callous orders behind the scenes.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GMYryp3Kpat6UgA5NHN_P.jpg?height=1366&width=2048)\\n\\nTechnology alone will not save us, and that includes the rusty old technology of today’s democracies that chain us to our so-called democratic leaders.\\n\\nUnduloid Forms is an art network employing novel techniques to demonstrate just some of the ways we can build a new public realm.\\n\\nAnd we start with a monument to mark a politician who believes in offensive stone relics over human rights.\\n\\nAs they close in on the right to protest, we will find new ways of eluding the trap.\\n\\nWe invite you to join the demonstration.\\n\\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\nUnduloid is producing a real statue for public installation.
