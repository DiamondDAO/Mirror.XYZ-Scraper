"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"This is a simple idea I wrote at the invitation of my friend @Kong Nft Promoter. After it was sent out, it was loved by many friends. The title of the article was How to convert your 1 ETH to 10 ETH!! The article was published on July 27th. Come out, if you saw and invested in some NFTs of Artblocks, such as Chormie Squiggle or Frammentis,or Returns and Divisions then the goal of ETH 10 times should have been achieved.\\n\\nMy native language is not English, so I wrote the article using Google Translate. Now I make some simple changes for the first article.\\n\\nI am very good at writing in Chinese, but from now on, I will try to write my thoughts in English. I have founded many companies and have made great achievements in the field of digital currency. In the future, my time and life will be accompanied by mathematics and art. Therefore, Generative Art will always accompany me.\\n\\nNFT collection guide for newcomers\\n\\n1 The collection and purchase of NFT are new things in this world. It is different from digital currency and other works of art.\\n\\n2 Generally speaking, good digital currencies such as BTC and ETH will appreciate relative to the U.S. dollar, while NFT will appreciate relative to ETH. The appreciation of digital currency relative to the U.S. dollar also reduces liquidity, while the appreciation of NFT relative to ETH also greatly reduces liquidity.\\n\\n3 For people who own a lot of ETH, such as VincentVanDough, the best way to buy the existing NFT collections portfolio directly; for people who don’t have so many ETHs, don’t buy too much in the second-hand market at the beginning, because NFT’s Liquidity is not as good as digital currencies.\\n\\n4 The safest way is to participate in the first-hand market sales, and the better way is to only participate in the mint of Artblocks.\\n\\n5 I use my own values ​​and aesthetics to invest in NFTs, so I only own CryptoPunks and ArtBlocks.\\n\\n6 I like Generative Art very much. This is my main investment direction.\\n\\n7 At any time, price is the best measure of value. The best investment target, if the price is already high, then it is best to calm down, here I give up investing in Autoglyphs.\\n\\n8 The best portfolio I recommend for newcomers starting with is ArtBlocks Chromie Suqiggle, and keep minting ArtBlocks Cutared/Playground and ArtBlocks Factory projects.\\n\\n9 Programming and aesthetics are the two skills that make you even more powerful in the field of NFT collection.\\n\\n10 Human beings will always move forward, and the changes in art will never stop. In the future, everyone will have their own artwork, and only NFT can make this a reality. Because I believe, I see.\\n\\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c97b46e-825a-44a1-8579-13438abb3307_1467x1500.png)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1640146960,\"title\":\"How to convert your 1 ETH to 10 ETH!!\"},\"digest\":\"Zm7f2VQX7cAAH6Arhza8XMHuIVPkvJhXIKHKSNhFZrg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xe1994b2Fd8310218a06875b4B3D7CBca8ec83e4c\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JGqmavr_lT2OZ_qQrG-HnhuzOHLa3U3CgDIXW3Jimyc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"sDcdQ2dU3nbJvINfHNx1SPRiGgppl6nvtyF3ew1W9tQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"F6_PEnEP2QJw3HvfzkixScWJkSNRfuZ6DhaSHdBtD8HhnsEO5CwzKXFodyIdtmvXX2hLRHhcUM-4gFye-YbLFw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0edf82b6c3289d83135361b8f0713852f416e453fa901849c2e4732820dd492e040eb527d60fe777cee5c08ed1315f2a570362b3df4d2c8836aecf86d18f4c041b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JGqmavr_lT2OZ_qQrG-HnhuzOHLa3U3CgDIXW3Jimyc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"sDcdQ2dU3nbJvINfHNx1SPRiGgppl6nvtyF3ew1W9tQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Zm7f2VQX7cAAH6Arhza8XMHuIVPkvJhXIKHKSNhFZrg\"}"
