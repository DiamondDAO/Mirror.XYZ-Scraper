"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Research topic: ***Am I a line of code?***\\n\\nChapter 1. 12.02.2021\\n\\nM. Mitchell Waldrop, \\n\\nI tried to record my inspiration flow during one day, and it is what it looks like:\\n\\n1. I walked on my way to the gym and have been told its closed because of the close Covid case, and on my way back, my spotify played the song: \\n\\n   [https://open.spotify.com/track/2uG7RbrJSq5bZWv7ufDyTg?si=nFLN3B9zR8iSKfjUk7ILNA](https://open.spotify.com/track/2uG7RbrJSq5bZWv7ufDyTg?si=nFLN3B9zR8iSKfjUk7ILNA)\\n\\n2. Having a debate in head:  “We lived in such a variation, behind the massive changes and variation, there might just be just one equation, to produce and stimulate what we saw. If everything is changing, what is not changed? I kept testing the reality by putting myself in a conventional high-risk and unpredictable situation, I wish to compare the consequences to conventional lower-risk life choices, but what has been changed after I started going with the flow? I may never know. “\\n3. Dune movie discussion with Cali and archived it into Wechat favorites, where you can store all documents there, then I found it is Web3 logic in a Web 2 tool, Wechat had everything about what blockchain trend indicated: from personal data storage, NFT conversion, personal search engine to categorize database and build constructive category by Tag feature! It is a personal metaverse so to say, you have all your experience and memory recorded and archived in a social media platform!\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KikEKDA4-YDohiMTY5Tl0.jpeg?height=2393&width=1170)\\n\\n4\\\\. Then I browsed Twitter feeds and saw one response to a question: -What is feeling? - “We are entering a cultural reality where subjective experience supersedes objective consensus. ”\\n\\nIsn't it an indication that most things will be based on our individual conscious reflection in the very near future？\\n\\n5\\\\. MIng shared with me his work flow about buiIding a VR project, I looked into the product flow and told Ming my passion is about research on the most irrelevant and absurd topics now, then later on I found this link appeared in my chat group:\\n\\n<http://philosophyandtechnology.network/yuk-hui/>\\n\\nI found it is a research center on philosophy and tech, I saw their contact and write an email.\\n\\n I feel I have been receiving powerful and obvious hints from everywhere each time I have a strong feeling about doing certain things, I took it as a coincidence for most of the time until it became an ordinary phenomenon.\\n\\n6\\\\. Then I contacted a friend who was the DJ for an event I hosted, invited him for an interview, and said to him we will cover the transportation fee for him if he came along for the interview discussion. He answered like: you are a trusted friend so I will not ask you for the fee. I shared with Ming and he said I was credited with good quality, then I came to think what if we live in a world with credit from others just like the Black Mirror，with more sincere and authentic reviews from others, that world might be either too chaotic or ideal.\\n\\n7\\\\. I asked Jessie one question about my thinking flow, I was hit by so many ideas and inspiration conversations every day, I was wondering what I could do with it, and what I could make a better analysis about my logic and the thinking process.\\n\\nShe said she was trying to figure out the same thing but without little process now, she recommends using Roam as a tool to record thinking flow, and it is a much efficient way to communicate by showing people how do you thinking than simply using plain language to describe it. \\n\\nWhat if we show each other our logic flow and thinking process instead of finding away to express it, a lot of problems will be solved then. But how to make it analytical? \\n\\nAt the end, we both agree to work as single node is the best way to make big influence, as the coordination process is proved to be not efficient, most people nowadays are sick of the group coordination, simply because each has to compromise their initial goal and opinion in order to work better with others, a lot of talent is wasted during the process.  \\n 8. Later on, Cali came back to talk with me about her universal theory and shared her recent discovery on Twin Flame, and what she has been experienced on something beyond her knowledge, and she felt deliberated from giving up on persistent obsession over things and person. \\n \",\"timestamp\":1638451163,\"title\":\"The order and the complexity\"},\"digest\":\"jpEzEP0zMJHHV1_gb0QZ7VevbyctJzvhTYvCTkGFMcU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xb12e31D8F7DdA2Dd3733c25cB3B01F6924cd3497\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Lr5PDIM-7CYqjKY0FyUbQOdVAKZQxW4dWUFVQIH1V0E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MvcF9owt1yEKt107pZTz6dsxILIe3Lvjfh3Ydj7quqk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"TFt6zz7OjMHeQ2P7dc4S4CkjrDMaRwoLKyX8imqGqsH5zG9boMeoaoT6UYGQ93fpjUXPyOW-aUv4i7RMeDqwgQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x24935a61236472302068f0d7667525159380a54a71ce668a6c9841c372f9b4fc0a8b2384113da3d62cc57a62c2f23825765253cf48c700cc992e0d4024e392961c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Lr5PDIM-7CYqjKY0FyUbQOdVAKZQxW4dWUFVQIH1V0E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MvcF9owt1yEKt107pZTz6dsxILIe3Lvjfh3Ydj7quqk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"sRPcWKyhXehFBHguT9jCcPrcL2c4b_CVISX-wHT12HU\"}"
