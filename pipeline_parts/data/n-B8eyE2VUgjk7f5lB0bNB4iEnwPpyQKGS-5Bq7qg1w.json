"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1, Good morning｜早安\\n\\nThe rustle of cutting apple slices gently woke up my ears. I managed to open my wistful eyes, a gentle morning light shot in from the mysterious window, and the sun fell on my face, stinging my eyes in an instant. I turned my head to avoid the sunlight. The objects in the room became clear in the eyes. What caught your eyes was the pulsating red dress and the beautiful flesh tightly wrapped in that dress. She stood by the bar in the open kitchen, dancing with her slender fingers, elegantly and dexterously using a fruit knife to cut red apples. The delicate face, who was preparing for breakfast for the day, instantly activated the memory of a name in my mind.\\n\\n切苹果片的窸窣声轻轻敲醒我的耳朵。我勉力睁开惺忪的双眼，一缕温柔的晨光从玄窗外射了进来，阳光洒落在我的脸上，刹那间刺痛了我的眼睛。我扭扭头，让眼睛避开日光。屋里的物件在眼里清晰了起来，映入眼帘的是跃动的大红色连衣裙，以及那连衣裙里面紧裹着的美好的肉体。她站在开放式厨房的吧台旁，舞动着纤细的手指，优雅灵巧地拿水果刀切着红通通的苹果。那个正在准备一日早餐的娇好面容，瞬间在我脑海中激活了对于一个名字的记忆。\\n\\n\\\"Good morning, Nana.\\\" I looked at her tenderly and lovingly, with an affectionate smile at the corner of my mouth. My lips did not move, nor did I make any sound. Mankind in 2140 has already got rid of the speech technology that relies on air vibration to conduct sound for communication. I just used quantum brain waves to send Nana a string of data like this: \\\"GM Nana.\\\"\\n\\n“早安，娜娜。”我充满温柔爱意地看着她，嘴角泛起动情的微笑。我的嘴唇并没有动，也没有发出任何声音。2140年的人类，已经早已摆脱掉依靠空气振动传导声音进行沟通的说话技术了。我只是使用量子脑波给娜娜发过去了这样的数据串：“GM Nana.”\\n\\nThe data is encrypted with Nana's public key, and no one can decrypt it except that she possesses the private key to decrypt it. Moreover, quantum brainwaves are a quantum communication channel, once eavesdropped by a man in the middle, the quantum state is destroyed. Therefore, this kind of technology will never be like the Trisolaran in an ancient science fiction novel. Everyone will know what a person thinks, and there is no privacy at all.\\n\\n数据是用娜娜的公钥加密的，除了她拥有私钥可以解密之外，其他任何人都无法解开。而且，量子脑波是走的量子通信信道，一旦被中间人窃听，量子态就被破坏掉了。所以，这种技术绝对不会像某个古老的科幻小说里说的三体星人那样，一个人想什么，所有人就都知道了，毫无隐私可言。\\n\\nNana, who was busy attentively, was taken aback by me. She put down her work, raised her head and looked at me. The affectionate eyes blinked, as if responding to my good morning. However, she did not make any verbal expressions. And all of a sudden, it seemed as if a small deer crashed into her heart, and two blushes came to her cheeks. I received a signature message from her requesting divine friendship in my brain.\\n\\n正在聚精会神忙碌着的娜娜被我吓了一小跳。她放下了手里的工作，抬起头看向我这边。含情脉脉的双眸一眨，仿佛在回应我的早安。不过她并没有作出语言表达。而在忽然之间，仿佛有一头小鹿撞进了她的心房，两抹绯红浮上了她的双颊。我大脑里收到了她请求神交的签名信息。\\n\\nAt this time, we humans no longer need to rely on physical contact to complete a fun of fish and water. The sun is shining, I wake up early in the morning, and when I wake up, I am full of affection. The scene chosen by Nana is Van Gogh's famous work \\\"Flower Field\\\", which is exactly what I like. Zi Shi was very pleased to use the private key to sign the invitation, and went to the flower field together for some lingering. It is not Guan Songyu who has a slight remark, but it is Wang Mengjue late. Since the completion of Gaotang's Fu, Chu Tianyunyu has been suspicious.\\n\\n此时我们人类，也早已经不再需要依靠肉体接触来完成一场你侬我侬的鱼水之欢了。阳光明媚，清晨苏醒，起床时分，浓情蜜意。娜娜选的场景是梵高的名作《花田》，正合我的心意。自是欣然使用私钥签名应邀，共赴花田，一番缠绵。非关宋玉有微辞，却是襄王梦觉迟。一自高唐赋成后，楚天云雨尽堪疑。\\n\\nAfter a while, after calming down from the intracranial orgasm, I got up from the anti-gravity floating bed and stood up. The so-called anti-gravity suspended bed is actually quite different from the ancient bed. It just has a \\\"bed\\\" in its name, but it's actually just a thin film on the ground. This film is folded to less than 3 cm square, so it can be easily put in a pocket. It is as high as one person and as wide as two people when it is spread out. Of course, the size can also be customized. When you lie down when you sleep, your body will not fall to the ground, but will be suspended in mid-air under the action of anti-gravity.\\n\\n稍顷，待从颅内高潮中回复平静，我从反重力悬浮床上起身，站了起来。所谓的反重力悬浮床，其实和古代的床已然大不同。它只是名字里还有一个“床”字，而实际上只是铺在地上的一层薄薄的膜。这张膜折叠起来不到3厘米见方，可以很方便的装在口袋里。铺展开来却有一人多高、两人多宽，当然也可以定制尺寸。睡觉的时候躺上去，身体并不会落到地面，而是会在反重力作用下悬浮在半空中。\\n\\nThe force exerted by the anti-gravity bed on the body is different in each position, and the resolution is very fine. Just like the ancient independent pocket spring mattress, different parts of the head, back, waist and buttocks can be given different support, which is more in line with human mechanics to obtain the best sleep quality. As for things like pillows, they are naturally obsolete.\\n\\n反重力床施加在身体上的力在各个位置是不同的，而且分辨率非常精细。就像古代的独立袋式弹簧床垫，可以给予头部、背部、腰部和臀部等不同部位以不同的支撑，更符合人体力学，以获得最佳的睡眠质量。至于枕头这种东西，自然也是早就被淘汰的东西了。\\n\\n\\\"There is no coffee at home. You can buy two cups of hand punch.\\\" Nana told me when I got out of bed. I summoned Xiao Fei over. Signed a Bitcoin payment transaction of 2 satoshis, designated the payee to be the cafe at the end of the street, and entered the signed transaction to Xiao Fei. Xiao Fei gave me a sentence of \\\"Roger that\\\", just \\\"swish\\\" out of the superfluid film skylight on the roof. I shook my head gently and muttered to myself: This guy is always so panicky.\\n\\n“家里没有咖啡了。你买两杯手冲吧。”娜娜见我下了床，这样告诉我。我召唤了小飞过来。签署了一笔金额为2聪的比特币支付交易，指定收款方是街角尽头的咖啡馆，把签名交易输入给了小飞。小飞给我撂下一句“Roger that“，就”嗖”的一声从屋顶的超流体膜天窗处冲了出去。我轻轻的摇摇头，喃喃自语：这家伙总是这么急慌慌的。\\n\\nXiao Fei is a pet robot kept by Nana and I. It looks like a round flat plate. Naturally, it can use anti-gravity technology to fly, can help us run errands and transport things, of course, it can also carry bitcoin payment data to complete the delivery of transfer transactions. After a while, Xiao Fei came back. Two cups of fragrant coffee are steadily placed on the plate. It stretched out two fine hydraulic arms from the holes on both sides, and put two cups of coffee from the flat plate onto the table in front of me and Nana. After finishing, Xiao Fei replied playfully, \\\"Enjoy Love.\\\" This sentence was broadcast to both of us,Nana looked at me and smiled.\\n\\n小飞是我和娜娜养的宠物机器人，样子就是一个圆形的平板。自然，它可以利用反重力技术飞行，可以帮我们跑腿和运送东西，当然，也能携带比特币支付数据完成转账交易的递送。不一会儿，小飞就回来了。平板上稳稳地摆着两杯香气扑鼻的咖啡。它从两侧的孔中伸出两个精细液压臂，把两杯咖啡从平板上端到了我和娜娜面前的桌子上。完成之后，小飞调皮地回了我一句，“Enjoy Love.”这一句是广播给我俩的，娜娜听到后和我相视一笑。\\n\\nNana suddenly told me that she would pay for the coffee this morning. After that, she transferred 2 satoshis to me from her lightning wallet. I accidentally paid attention to the transfer record she just sent, and I was suddenly shocked, and my thoughts fell into an abyss...\\n\\n娜娜忽然和我说，今早的咖啡她来付。说着就从她的闪电钱包里把2聪转给了我。我不小心注意了一下她刚刚发出的转账记录，忽然感到大为惊骇，思绪一下子陷入到了万丈深渊之中……\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vPZCf6qtDQpQBAcv_0fcf.jpg?height=700&width=1920)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639141440,\"title\":\"Good morning, Nana｜早安，娜娜——Chapter One｜第一章\"},\"digest\":\"vcpYNpwhjKUqWOZAVyN3b6HmptVjqYnyuQZxptrpwW8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x43B004D591808B79cAe88F29C32Fff781Aee0e11\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"J0K6WSYCAiNsDyfYKfNQUBwz5Y2DHM1lClyZHsES8J8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"T756lTat5fLMyTAcCBeRUgArjhma_41p1QdFqw3bY4E\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"niBuRKx-tdCMM8maOCFm7M3GTf1YgH6T7J6BtcAU3pcTHMxbHVlnMCNCH4549-iOOYmCmeVnC5a7B2HQp-FUPQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4499ae3483ae8a062ad6bae21a5f5564218c00d5d5f042da8178ab89b45bad5221946568fb243bbb56120558dea32ce17d5fc49e7f8609949a27d439840d69591b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"J0K6WSYCAiNsDyfYKfNQUBwz5Y2DHM1lClyZHsES8J8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"T756lTat5fLMyTAcCBeRUgArjhma_41p1QdFqw3bY4E\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"35yO5tuhuWuVC9IkvO-_UozoTn3Ibdpq2GhzUngnCL0\"}"
