"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"A cowboy stood resolute at the edge of a grave.  Across the gap, a priest, a gravedigger, and a shovel mirrored the mood.  The priest eulogized empathy as scoops of brittle cloud scattered the evening blue above.  Beneath a lowered brim, tears broke heavy over eyelids.  Splat -- six feet below, striking a tiny coffin. \\n\\n“What is it you would like us to put on this here slab of granite, cowboy?”\\n\\n“Eight words, a comma, and a period.”\\n\\n“Say’em clear now.”\\n\\n“‘*From where you came, return with our love.’”*  Comma after came.  Period after love.*”* \\n\\n“Name?”\\n\\n“Poppy.”\\n\\n“Born?”\\n\\n“This morning.”\\n\\n“Died?”\\n\\n“Well, it’s still today ain’t it?”\\n\\n“My apologies, I didn’t mean…”\\n\\n“Say, can I have a moment alone before it’s engraved?”\\n\\n“With no limit.”  \\n\\nThe priest retreated into the limbs of a nearby oak.  The gravedigger set aside his shovel and set off on a stroll.  Thud -- dirt struck fresh cedar.  The cowboy contracted into himself at the sight of the small box.  He wanted to dissipate into the wind and never return.  Three requests from his wife, the grieving mother, held him together, and he repeated her pleas over and over in his head to drown out each scoop and thud. \\n\\n*“Pack the earth tight.*  *Plant poppy seeds.*  *Root life to the spot.”* \\n\\nAs soon as the last seed was snug, a snake slithered out and spoke clearly.\\n\\n“Would you like your daughter to live, cowboy?”\\n\\n“That split tongue don’t tempt me, serpent.”     \\n\\nThe snake relaxed with a reverent bow.  Two fangs emerged cloaked by a shy hiss, and a drop of venomous nectar plopped on the fresh mound of soil.  A sprout popped out, and a green sprig flowered golden.\\n\\n“I can give your Poppy a chance to bloom.”\\n\\n“With poison?  To what end?  Y’allkind ain’t got such a reputation.”   \\n\\n“Surrender, so that she can begin.  Offer your blood so hers can flow.  Is it not a fair price?”\\n\\n“You shed myths.”\\n\\nTwo more splashes dropped, and a garden blossomed.  Malevolence swayed in orange.  The strike was furious.  Venom seized the cowboy’s veins, and a race for his heart began.  He compounded into a speck of dust.  Frozen.  Exploding.  Yet, however suspended, the cowboy still was.  \\n\\n“Well, shit.”\\n\\n“Did you hold on?”\\n\\n“Say what now?”\\n\\n“When everything went boom?  Did you let go, or did you hold on?”\\n\\n“Is that you, snake?”\\n\\n“No, it’s me, the moon.  You must have held on.”\\n\\n“Held on?”\\n\\n“You’re stuck in-between.”\\n\\n“In-between what now, exactly?”\\n\\n“Here and there.”\\n\\n“Hell.  Weren’t there somewhere else I ought to be?”\\n\\n“Only if you are willing to let go.”  \\n\\n“You reckon the snake’ll bring back my Poppy?”\\n\\n“A tombsnake preys on desperation.” \\n\\n“I weren’t desperate.”\\n\\n‘No… then what were you?”\\n\\n“Resolute.”\\n\\n“With tears pouring?”\\n\\n“I was anticipating resoluteness.”\\n\\n“And?”\\n\\n“And now, I suppose, I’m stuck.”\\n\\n“You do seem to have a choice.”\\n\\n“Which is it then?”\\n\\n“With a slight snap, you can be released and cease to be.”\\n\\n“Would the grief cease to be?”\\n\\n“Yes.  The pain would wisp away.”\\n\\n“What happens with Poppy if we play it that way?”\\n\\n“She’ll remain below, and the snake will slither off.”\\n\\n“Damn tombsnakes.”\\n\\n“Tempting devils.”\\n\\n“Then my wife would lose her baby today and bury me tomorrow?  That ain’t no choice.  What’s the other rub?” \\n\\n“That, though grim, would be to return.”\\n\\n“How?”\\n\\n“Let go.”\\n\\n“Would I return to the edge of resolution?”\\n\\n“Indeed.”\\n\\n“With the poppies planted?”\\n\\n“You’ll awake to a cool breeze.”\\n\\n“And the snake?”\\n\\n“Will be a snake.”\\n\\n“What’s it like then?  To be released?”\\n\\n“A vibration into oblivion.”\\n\\n“Can I speak to Poppy, *here*?”\\n\\n“What would you like to say?”\\n\\n“You are loved.”\\n\\n“Are you ready for her reply?”\\n\\n“Damn near.”\\n\\n“*From where you came, return with my love.*”\\n\\nA polite breeze broke away from a shattered pearl sky.  Scales splashed in an orange pond at the bottom of the cowboy’s vision. He jabbed steel at lunging-slick-skin, and a severed head screeched.  Venom seethed out in a puddle, sizzling the snake’s skull to dust.   \\n\\n“Hot shit!” The gravedigger hollered. “Damn tombsnakes near everywhere this year!”\\n\\n“Ain’t a worry no more, its head has gone and dusted.”\\n\\n“You sure was quick, cowboy,” offered the priest.\\n\\n“Weren’t no other way to be.”\\n\\n“Which way was that then?”\\n\\n“Resolute, like the moon. Say now, solemn men, a beer each and this shovel for a ride back yonder?”\\n\\n“A fair deal for us both, and the preacher will drive.”\\n\\nIn the bed of a hearse that rumbled back toward town, empty coffins jostled, cedar chips clamored, and the cowboy, crammed in between the hollow boxes, encouraged a final tear to fall as the graveyard disappeared from view. Thoughts of holding his wife conjured a cleansing feeling that washed through his veins. Without hurry, clarity reappeared, and a vow took root within him.\\n\\n*From where she been then, I’ll carry her love from here.*\",\"timestamp\":1641354138,\"title\":\"Resolute like the Moon \"},\"digest\":\"r7D4Xh6XIAC4DunyC4TDkSzQMlwBoNw-Oqk9rSVH2L0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xF206B3B01c99660e43AA63a874D3785e343946E1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HcF116PzZ-fJcETxZhMk3X8BBqpLurS7WKCRMEWNtg8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"e4lf8uLROgKkBYSkUEiMxpLNxXMOTIuMBp935Hon6Bg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"GE65UpJRQQBQschCFkMMpdOm9a6rUc-s520h8zP4Pegf8AbbzvoDK2jZl1wg98HkplSRbIrXisgMLiEtSdJmPw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x560e1f82d0681d8816cbcc62d3fd439c42cac4a208f0732fe811d466605f8cea23491e4fd0d049a5482cab42c0c9231e6ef8a28a07802d6e9da595d0ca07ee781c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HcF116PzZ-fJcETxZhMk3X8BBqpLurS7WKCRMEWNtg8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"e4lf8uLROgKkBYSkUEiMxpLNxXMOTIuMBp935Hon6Bg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"r7D4Xh6XIAC4DunyC4TDkSzQMlwBoNw-Oqk9rSVH2L0\"}"
