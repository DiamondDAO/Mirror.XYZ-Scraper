"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Last week I did some travelling. While flying, I watched a couple of movies on the plane. One of them had a fight scene where the villain had his ear defaced by a kitchen grater. At this part in the film, I let out an audible gasp, causing the passenger next to me to inquire about my well being. I reassured them I was okay. That it was just some movie gore. \\n\\nWhile I had been startled by the violence, I wasn’t surprised my whole body reacted to the pain of a fictitious person. I have always covered my eyes when Hollywood displays blood and guts. Don’t get me wrong, some of my favourite movies contain gore, but I always look away. I have to for some reason. I literally can’t bear to watch. I have a similar visceral reaction to [Orbgasm’s](https://twitter.com/Orbtastic) artwork. This is why I wasn’t sure he would want to do the interview.\\n\\nJL: You know, I have been an Orb fan for a while, and I want to interview you for my blog, but I have to confess first. Your suspension artwork evokes such a strong response that I can’t look at it. I want to, I have tried, but it puts me in pseudo distress. I want to ask you about your work, but I’m not sure I’ll be able to include any images in my article. Would you still want to be interviewed?\\n\\nOrb: Oh, okay, that's new. My entire narrative is about the topographies of the mind and skin we inhabit. I have no idea if what I'm presenting to the world as an artist would make sense to present without the actual visual moments alongside the descriptions.\\n\\nThat strong response you are experiencing is partially the point of my work with suspension, and overcoming that feeling is part of facing who you are, but I'm curious to see where it goes, so let's do it!\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/Orbtastic/status/1467133417674481670?s=20](https://twitter.com/Orbtastic/status/1467133417674481670?s=20)\\n\\nJL:  When did you start making art, and what kind of art did you make at your beginnings?\\n\\nOrb: I started making visual art when doodling on things as a kid. Graffiti and geometric doodles were a big part of my teens. My first \\\"creative\\\" memories that I can go back to clearly, are when I would go to the bakery twice a week for my mom (she taught porcelain painting from home and wanted to have snacks for her students). As I walked, I would either skip or land my steps on the lines in the concrete, and in the process, ponder if there were microcosms I was accidentally stepping on, which in turn led me to think about how there's probably going to be one colossal foot one day, crushing us from above accidentally as well. I'm fairly confident this is what led me to draw some pretty bleak stuff like skulls and a bunch of weird little demons and ghouls. I was a pretty solitary kid, so that probably had a lot to do with it.\\n\\nJL: Do you still worry you might be crushing microcosms accidentally?\\n\\nOrb: I am pretty much convinced at this stage that micro and macrocosms are being snuffed out and coming into existence nonstop, ad infinitum, and the best thing to do is just accept this as the way things are. So uh, yes. Sorry, to whoever I just mashed on the enter key!\\n\\nJL: Do you have any formal art training?\\n\\nOrb: I have some academic background with art and art history from college, but to be perfectly honest, I have thrown almost everything I learned out in order to work in the mediums I have found myself thriving in.\\n\\nJL: What medium do you thrive in?\\n\\nOrb: I've come to find that I work really well with my hands and my words. In combining the two, I create living installations. So while my medium simultaneously falls under installation art and durational performance exploring the body suspension experience, I actually thrive at telling stories.\\n\\nJL: Whose narrative are you telling?\\n\\nOrb: The narratives I tell with my public installation and performative work are a combination of my own design and the person I am suspending. Every suspension is a journey of self-discovery, but given creative context, it is a powerful collaboration between the facilitator and the suspendee.\\n\\n[https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:472703?tab=owners](https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:472703?tab=owners)\\n\\nJL: What do you discover while exploring the body suspension experience?\\n\\nOrb: Everybody has a different experience with suspension, and every individual has a different experience each time they suspend. To answer this question accurately, I think I need to address why this is. A few different core processes are going on when a person suspends.\\n\\nThe first is the physical experience. We are essentially tricking the body into thinking there is more physical damage inflicted than actually is the case. The nervous system interprets this trauma as so severe that it pushes the body to produce excessive amounts of chemicals. The ones most important to us here are adrenaline and endorphins. Adrenaline is a hormone produced by the body when it is in a state of distress and increases blood circulation and breathing, among other bodily functions. It is also the name of my favorite Deftones album. Endorphins, on the other hand, are a group of chemicals that are essentially natural pain killers and are released during times of stress to deal with pain. Adrenaline speeds you up, and Endorphins cause euphoria.\\n\\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/129Jx52FwTa2pilZohst80?si=76de4c7230dd4c9b](https://open.spotify.com/track/129Jx52FwTa2pilZohst80?si=76de4c7230dd4c9b)\\n\\nThe second thing is the mental experience. This is intricately tied to the physical experience, insofar as the understanding that we are sentient beings having a human experience in a human body. As a general rule, our experiential understanding of the world is through our sensory interaction with the physical world around us. The idea that we can't do something is deeply rooted in what we are told we can and cannot do with our bodies and minds. This is a severely problematic invasion of both our bodily and mental autonomy. During suspension (*especially* during one's first time), one discovers their mental limitations. To get off the ground and let the body's chemical factory do its job is to push past these mental barriers and put trust not just in the facilitator(s) of the experience but also in oneself. You have to believe in yourself to get the full impact of suspension.\\n\\nThe third and last thing is what one might call the spiritual experience of suspension. Not everybody experiences this; in fact, many folks who suspend do it for the physical and mental experience alone. There are, however, those of us who experience something inexplicable when we enter liminal states during a suspension. There is a lot of self-improvement, suspension of disbelief, and profound detachment from material objects and institutions that occur in these spaces.\\n\\nAll of that being said, one can say that one discovers a form of naturally induced chemical euphoria, which in turn allows for a discovery of one's personal limits they previously may have been unaware of, and if the person is so inclined, a discovery of the higher self. The ultimate discovery for anybody, be it physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, or just fully in abstraction, is that of release. We let go of so much trauma and disbelief with suspension that it often brings individuals to uncontrollable tears. In cases where the person is open to it, they discover profound levels of cathartic healing.\\n\\n![Orb (right) and team (left) prepare a participant (centre) for suspension. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p4xNMDYnAEtFfDS9xk1jD.png?height=1200&width=1200)\\n\\nJL: The process sounds very personal to you and your suspendees. Why is the performance aspect necessary?\\n\\nOrb: Great question. I think it's important that things feel personal in art; it makes it more genuine and evokes a more \\\"real\\\" response. As with all performance and art, none of it is necessary. As artists, we have found a value in the practice worth exploring and sharing with others. I think the paradox of sharing a personal experience publicly is kind of what makes it more powerful, simply because the person performing is choosing to share their experience. It's a ritual offering of the self.\\n\\nFor my more complex installations that are much more involved (like in the [Phasing](https://foundation.app/@theskinproject) series), I only work with folks I have suspended before. We regularly book private sessions for people wanting to suspend with us throughout the year. This way, we provide a safe experience for those wanting to try it first hand or enthusiasts who suspend regularly. We can make informed decisions when it comes to choosing who can handle more challenging positions and durational suspension sessions. It helps that we believe in the folks who attempt suspension; I strongly believe anybody can transcend their physicality if they face some harsh truths.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/Orbtastic/status/1462434302545829890?s=20](https://twitter.com/Orbtastic/status/1462434302545829890?s=20)\\n\\nJL: Does it hurt?\\n\\nOrb: It absolutely hurts. In a way, it hurts less than getting a tattoo or a cosmetic piercing, but in many ways, it is a different kind of pain. The bottom line is that the rewards arrive once the person overcomes the pain - which is a combination of the endorphins kicking in and the suspendee letting go of the mental weight holding them back from breaking through to the other side. As Jim Morrison once said, \\\"The day destroys the night... Break on through to the other side!\\\" A tiny amount of pain is a small price to pay for the euphoria and dedicated space for introspection - turn your night into day.\\n\\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/6ToM0uwxtPKo9CMpbPGYvM?si=8e6f4814e8834853](https://open.spotify.com/track/6ToM0uwxtPKo9CMpbPGYvM?si=8e6f4814e8834853)\\n\\nJL: There are some parallels to bondage and masochism. Is there a sexual component to your process?\\n\\nOrb: There are absolutely some parallels there, but the relevance of BDSM/kink during the moment of suspension is determined by the suspendee and the facilitator's intentions. 99% of my work has nothing to do with bondage or masochism. I refuse to sexualize the experience in any way unless it is specifically the intention for the session. The 1% of my work that does explore this space is all private, and I do not share this aspect of my life with the public, for the most part.\\n\\nThe critical point here is that while BDSM and kinkspace are mighty realms in which to experience empowerment, hook suspension does not naturally fall in that space. The power dynamics are very different; suspension is about self-discovery without the spiritual or emotional guidance of a dominant player in one's headspace.\\n\\nJL: Have you suspended yourself?\\n\\nOrb: I have been suspending regularly since 2015. Some years I suspend less than others, and some years I go ham. It used to be a more recreational/physical release for me, and it sometimes still is. I have found that the older I get though, I seek calmer, and more liminal experiences. My last suspension was back in August for my birthday, and I hung from my knees in my birthday suit from a tree at the top of a hill overlooking a vista. It was the most Zen experience I've had in 3 years.\\n\\n![Orb's birthday view.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XIRYttHIPc-0DTUrmXS4f.png?height=3648&width=5472)\\n\\n[https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/71135657730827309651825356287642716968309812520093762399118830168109834305537](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/71135657730827309651825356287642716968309812520093762399118830168109834305537)\\n\\nJL: Are there any other artists that do this kind of work?\\n\\nOrb: There are not many artists that do my kind of work, but the ones that do are simply fucking phenomenal. In the suspension world, the work of [Wings of Desire](https://wingsofdesire.org/) (Norway) is my biggest influence, followed by [Constructs of Ritual Evolution](https://thepointjournal.org/2020/05/22/point-84-core-constructs-of-ritual-evolution/) (USA), [Skindependent](https://www.instagram.com/immersive.environments/) (New Zealand), and [Indigenak](https://www.instagram.com/indigenak/) (Spain/Germany)\\n\\nJL: Who are some non-suspension artists or art styles that also influence your work?\\n\\nOrb: My most significant influence as a conceptual artist is currently [Chiharu Shiota](https://www.chiharu-shiota.com/) of Japan. Her work makes me experience an inexplicable level of emotive response. I feel it in my bones it's so beautiful.\\n\\n![Photo by Ding Musa of INTERNAL LINE, an installation by Chiharu Shiota 2021](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eChbDFIbnRsp6g8kQPnVF.png?height=1216&width=2000)\\n\\nJL: Is your goal to have your viewer feel your performances in their bones?\\n\\nOrb: My goal is, and always will be to challenge the viewer, with all of my work. I dislike art that does not make me experience a different perspective or some form of discomfort. I think the power of suspension as a visual art-form is that the life-changing experience the suspendee is undergoing each time they suspend, translates to a transformation in the viewer's mind as well. My proudest moments with my work, have been watching people shed tears, and have cathartic experiences just standing in front of, and looking at my work. These aren't just steel and rope and flesh sculptures; they are real humans, having real experiences: Living Art.\\n\\nJL: Any advice for viewers that may find your art ‘disturbing’?\\n\\nOrb: My advice to anybody viewing art they find disturbing, is to ask themselves why *they* find it disturbing. They may find the answer to that is much more meaningful than they expected, and discover mechanisms to experiencing personal growth they were unaware of.\\n\\nJL: I am not sure I am ready to do the heavy lifting required to un-tease my aversion to all things bloody, but I am glad to have a better understanding of the art of suspension, and I promise I’ll keep trying not to look away.\\n\\n[https://linktr.ee/orbgasm](https://linktr.ee/orbgasm)\\n\\n[split://0xB4c5649951e77D253Fe165D78ff9261418649cE3](split://0xB4c5649951e77D253Fe165D78ff9261418649cE3)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638785928,\"title\":\"Trying Not to Look Away: An Interview with Orbgasm\"},\"digest\":\"t-_MWx3LuqFgeLkpdmg5ATT7324Irhoud-rXzHlJjJs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x23598F73b9fBD281bA5646e59Ad49d04456152aF\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tRkc5JohHeOL1hGesHFkpmJzAymIR_lavY5udzNyOvk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NvO6pSy__ddnp0kAlF2dmayP37SUDFWgIgN9Mw0neLk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ylMuKyJFvlSaNssVGdvgcgLhHE7vjiC9P1gqFWPW8ZYhYjuq8wC_CMMWQ9irIewCUnRJ5sLOJJYmRNr3gBB0TQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb88a654de055aa9b19645881716ebca148cdd63fa8ab43994b054a79d18abcfc288214239e7d0edebeaea52af4c429f8f54cf884d5b316f681c2d1ee0f32c7941b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tRkc5JohHeOL1hGesHFkpmJzAymIR_lavY5udzNyOvk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NvO6pSy__ddnp0kAlF2dmayP37SUDFWgIgN9Mw0neLk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"DH-fZuSdHJqp-n2CMlKuMrnp-CK-LUqV_RmCOhg1JVo\"}"
