"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I have been involved in the web3 community for the last months and I can express that I’m really surprised about all the support, collaboration, and good vibes around each web3 project.\\n\\nIt’s amazing!\\n\\n## Well, first of all: Let me share, WTH is web3?\\n\\nSo, web3 is an online ecosystem based on blockchain, a new phase of the Internet where pieces come together, technology adoption, and maturity on the digital society.\\n\\nBlockchain is a chain of encrypted blocks that store and transfer information (on a peer-to-peer network) in an encrypted and decentralized way guided by smart contracts that follows simple “if/when/then” statements and are written into code.\\n\\nBitcoin and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) “cryptocurrency” (mostly known as protocols/platforms/technologies, powers [dApps](https://decrypt.co/resources/dapps): Decentralized Applications) are created on the blockchain.\\n\\nIt means that there is no “data center” for the information and all people involved could be a co-provider on the ecosystem, because it is a Decentralized Technology too.\\n\\nIn a few words DAO’s.\\n\\n* [DAO](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/what-is-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-and-how-does-a-dao-work): Decentralized Autonomous Organization - **Community-led entity with no central authority**.\\n\\nAlso, there are Tokens = Cryptocurrency’s, or Crypto assets too on DeFi. \\n\\nTokenomics: The economic policy of a token for each DeFi project, such as the supply, allocation, distribution, utility, and governance measures.\\n\\n* [DeFi:](https://defipulse.com/) Decentralized Finance (Stable coins, Decentralized exchanges…) DeFi needs DAO’s to operate.\\n\\n### An example for :\\n\\n[NFT](https://www.investopedia.com/non-fungible-tokens-nft-5115211): Non-fungible Token - It means that this token is unique and can’t be replaced. NFT’s are certificates that show you own a digital item, which can be videos, tweets, music, images, gifs, papers, or memes: “A digital art”. These are collectibles items. Get inspired in some [oncyber.io](https://oncyber.io/) galleries.\\n\\n[ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/9765](ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/9765)\\n\\n### Looking for more interaction:\\n\\n[Metaverse:](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/15/inside-the-metaverse-economy-this-is-what-will-be-for-real-in-2022.html) A network of augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D holographic avatars, video and other elements focused on **social connection,** that creates a hole experience on how we interact with other people. This term exists since 1992. Of course, with new technologies, we have more and more pieces (mostly platforms, networks and development tools), to improve an experience in the virtual world as [Oculus](https://auth.oculus.com/referrals/link/GigiHamilton/?utm_source=messenger&utm_medium=xma) is doing.\\n\\n![Workspace by meta](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hjpqamn37nxfk2hbYBkOy.jpg?height=800&width=1200)\\n\\nA parallel world were we could coexist.\\n\\n> So web3 is the user experience inside an ecosystem between blockchain, smart contracts, decentralized applications, and communities.\\n\\n### My favorite web3 engagement/stickiness characteristics:\\n\\n1. Being welcome by founders.\\n2. Being part of a project from scratch to launch!\\n3. Meet diversity! People around the world in conversations, no barriers.\\n4. The ecosystem. There are a lot of people learning about web3 and it’s really comforting realizing that there is a lot of support everywhere. Twitter Spaces, Telegram Groups, Discord servers, Meetups, etc. So don’t worry, you are not the only one, let’s learn with others.\\n5. Collaboration between founders and teams. The quick response and willingness of others to promote your project or projects together in community is incredible.\\n6. It’s not a utopia, the entire Internet is reinventing NOW.\\n\\n   > And this is why, the community gives power to projects by making them alive: The creator’s economy, the curator’s economy and much more!\\n\\n![A lot of Twitter Spaces for sharing and learning!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pRMoEr9VZGme87vz6cfeJ.gif?height=810&width=1440)\\n\\nWell, as I mentioned before, is about improving the web3 User Experience to create a more pleasant life.\\n\\nJust be aware of:\\n\\n* Entering and giving access to your wallet to unknown websites.\\n* Avoid risky moves, if you are on vacations or holidays. (being away from your wallet for a long time).\\n* Get informed about mission, vision, founders and projects backgrounds before investing on them.\\n\\n### Are you ready to jump into web3?\\n\\n[Let me know your thoughts](https://twitter.com/agnamihira) about this and your journey!\",\"timestamp\":1642371570,\"title\":\"Some notes about my learning joruney in Web3\"},\"digest\":\"-0Bz4jFZmOawbmMBXkrMhXG96TKYmMAk7Om0Iap5ces\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7c392203406c0Dbf44C1E914bA1C3e0A9CeA87E1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"E1Su8TZj7HCuuOVH_lj9H3X-6X8gRQCNDuY_qn82wvo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"38Af9zE9wV65U769SebXmf_OUS_dRLRIlHf23q7KVMU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"vcbcbGQVsf_HH9gLtpc0sDi9wwwCpEJOoiq3s3-Xk-cXRGWqLXcInqv04V_90LYIjbtu4YOZ9iF9cUBioTFHpA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd9cf9a55ff089f0a5c623d9ec17011cd27736cb0033ce7a3ef5d586e4cfa623e47fbedb23a12246a248830bba84b6a1a17514f1efc76ba51d2b28e5e7abfc37a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"E1Su8TZj7HCuuOVH_lj9H3X-6X8gRQCNDuY_qn82wvo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"38Af9zE9wV65U769SebXmf_OUS_dRLRIlHf23q7KVMU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"1kQzy_G8xs1Ux3A3fecrsXoY4fMggxJMnhpJp0Ve6BU\"}"
