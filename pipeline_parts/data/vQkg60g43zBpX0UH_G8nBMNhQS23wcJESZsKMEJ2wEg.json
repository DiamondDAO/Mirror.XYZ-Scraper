"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### tl:dr ↓\\n\\nLadies and Gentlemen, Kings and Queens alike, we have finally arrived at **Chapter 4** of this musical journey.\\n\\nAn *excerpt* of my album ***ONCE YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF*** drops today, but not on streaming platforms. The full album is made up of 9 songs. **Two** of them are done, “ALRIGHT” which was released yesterday on all streaming platforms, and “EACH TIME” which was released in 2020. The other 7 songs are in demo form. I’d love for you to help me finish the project.\\n\\nYou can participate in this drop through 3 engagements:\\n\\n1.

(more info in *Collectibles* section below)\\n\\n\\n_______________________________\\n\\nWelcome to ***ONCE YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF*** — the 4th Chapter.\\n\\nThis 9-song body of work moves beyond the self-discovery themes of my previous works and explores the power within, the power in believing in one’s self. What happens when we make our minds up to be the greatest version of ourselves, for ourselves and all of humanity?\\n\\nWith the release of this project I decided to challenge some antiquated concepts revolving around music — what music is, how we value it, and how it’s been distributed traditionally.\\n\\nThis drop is broken down into 3 sections: **The One-of-One’s, The Collectibles, and The Editions**.\\n\\n### Here’s what’s happening:\\n\\n* There are 3 one-of-one NFTs on auction **below**\\n* There are 7 NFT *collectibles* now **[available on Rarible](https://rarible.com/tidus)**, which are explained in detail below\\n* There are 222 album bundle *copies* **[now available on my online shop](https://ko-fi.com/s/9b8d816e7b)**, which are also explained below\\n\\nAll collectors of any of the above will receive:\\n\\n1. A private download of the album excerpts’ songs + artwork\\n2. One (1) invite into the *HYER PWRS UNIVERSE Channel on my* discord server — which is a private community within our already growing public community\\n3. Two (2) tickets to any one (1) TiDUS show or event through 2022-2023. (more info in *Collectibles* section below)\\n\\n## The full ONCE YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF Tracklist is:\\n\\n1. ALRIGHT\\n2. BLESSINGS (Demo)\\n3. EACH TIME\\n4. PURPOSE (Demo)\\n5. WITHOUT YOU (Demo)\\n6. UNTITLED\\n7. UNTITLED\\n8. UNTITLED\\n9. UNTITLED\\n\\nAs you can see, **seven of the nine songs are unfinished**. I need your help to finish them, and you can see how in the *Collectibles* section below.\\n\\nLet’s GO..\\n\\n# The One-of-One’s\\n\\nOn auction are 2 one-of-one [Zora NFTs](https://zora.co/tidus) for tracks 1 and 3 — *ALRIGHT* and *EACH TIME*. There is also a one-of-one Zora NFT for the official *ALRIGHT* music video, auctioning off on Zora as well.\\n\\n## Track No. 1 — ALRIGHT\\n\\n*ALRIGHT* was written and produced by me.\\n\\nI wrote this song in the Nevada desert, shortly after hearing some heartbreaking news regarding friends back home in New Jersey. I wrote it like a mantra, a reminder to anyone listening that you are never alone. You have guidance and support amongst you always. Just ask for it.\\n\\nCheck [Zora](https://zora.co/tidus) throughout this weekend for the release of the “ALRIGHT” NFT\\n\\n## Track No. 3 — EACH TIME\\n\\n*EACH TIME* was written and produced by me.\\n\\nI recorded this song in Brooklyn, New York during the summer of 2019. The song is about trusting yourself and letting the soul guide you on this journey we call life.\\n\\nAlso an ode to where I grew up in New Jersey, I wanted to remind listeners of how far they’ve come - the challenges you’ve overcome, the ways you’ve grown spiritually, mentally and emotionally and how much further you can take it when you believe in yourself, EACH TIME.\\n\\n[https://zora.co/collections/zora/6772](https://zora.co/collections/zora/6772)\\n\\n## ALRIGHT — The Official Music Video\\n\\nThe official music video for \\\"ALRIGHT\\\" is **[now up for auction on Zora](https://zora.co/collections/zora/6766)**, directed by Wil Adamy + I. Editing and additional captured footage was provided by Nacho of NachoVision. We shot this in Trona, California at the Trona Pinnacles.

There are a few options that I really love, but I need your help to decide on which one to pursue. That is where we will start our collective decision making. Here’s how it works:\\n\\nThe 4 Untitled collectibles are a **10 edition** NFT on [Rarible](https://rarible.com/token/0xB66a603f4cFe17e3D27B87a8BfCaD319856518B8:17376299731391919579474122965768848280390497522586972161480416995944989458437?tab=owners), with each edition priced at **0.03 ETH**. I ask that you purchase a maximum of **1 edition per wallet**.\\n\\nThe Untitled collectible NFT’s will act as the access token into a gated set of channels on the HYER PWRS Universe Discord, where this community of 100 people will convene and begin the creative direction of the 4 remaining songs. Each untitled song will have it’s own gated channel on Discord for the creative directors to collectively advise in.\\n\\n**Each edition represents 1 vote in the *Untitled Creative Director Channel*  that will be formed to curate the completion of the remaining 4 songs on the album, as well as 1% of the master’s future earnings (through NFT sales, streaming royalties, etc). This means that 10 people will together own 10% of each UNTITLED song’s final master.**\\n\\n* 4 UTITLED NFT’s.\\n* 10 copies of each.\\n* Each owner becomes a creative director of the song, navigating decisions throughout the process of completing the song.\\n* Each owner of an UNTITLED Vinyl NFT will earn 1% of future royalties of the master recording.\\n* Limiti to (1) Vinyl per wallet\\n\\n[https://rarible.com/token/0xB66a603f4cFe17e3D27B87a8BfCaD319856518B8:17376299731391919579474122965768848280390497522586972161480416995944989458436?tab=owners](https://rarible.com/token/0xB66a603f4cFe17e3D27B87a8BfCaD319856518B8:17376299731391919579474122965768848280390497522586972161480416995944989458436?tab=owners)\\n\\n[https://rarible.com/token/0xB66a603f4cFe17e3D27B87a8BfCaD319856518B8:17376299731391919579474122965768848280390497522586972161480416995944989458437?tab=owners](https://rarible.com/token/0xB66a603f4cFe17e3D27B87a8BfCaD319856518B8:17376299731391919579474122965768848280390497522586972161480416995944989458437?tab=owners)\\n\\n[https://rarible.com/token/0xB66a603f4cFe17e3D27B87a8BfCaD319856518B8:17376299731391919579474122965768848280390497522586972161480416995944989458438?tab=owners](https://rarible.com/token/0xB66a603f4cFe17e3D27B87a8BfCaD319856518B8:17376299731391919579474122965768848280390497522586972161480416995944989458438?tab=owners)\\n\\n[https://rarible.com/token/0xB66a603f4cFe17e3D27B87a8BfCaD319856518B8:17376299731391919579474122965768848280390497522586972161480416995944989458439?tab=owners](https://rarible.com/token/0xB66a603f4cFe17e3D27B87a8BfCaD319856518B8:17376299731391919579474122965768848280390497522586972161480416995944989458439?tab=owners)\\n\\n## The Editions\\n\\nExcerpt is being released today is with **222 album bundle copies**, [available for purchase on my online shop here.](https://ko-fi.com/s/9b8d816e7b)\\n\\nThis bundle comes with:\\n\\n1.
