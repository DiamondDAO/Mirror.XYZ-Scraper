"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The growing importance of the NFT and the metaverse in general was explored in the first article. This time, we'd want to focus on NFT and gaming projects with a lot of user case potential.\\n\\nLot of exciting news are coming from the Enjin gaming powerhouse. Enjinstarter is the gaming launchpad focused on growing the Enjin ecosystem and the metaverse. There are a few interesting Initial Dex Offerings (IDO) worth paying attention for this month. Although Pixelverse has already been launched, there are still chances to get some gains on projects that still have to be displayed towards the public.\\n\\nFurthermore, there is another bullish outlook for potential Metaverse Projects below $30 million market cap. With more big players joining the game there are more opportunities to make a profit in the space. Metaverse projects like Mars 4, Revomon and Kalao are definitely worth to keep an eye on, considering their low market cap and high potential to become popular options to its users.\\n\\nAs far as NFTs are concerned, the Dare Nft ecosystem has done a major step in the world of NFT’s and Metaverse. The company plans to do so with the effective launch of the NFT 2.0 protocol. NFT 2.0 Protocol enables more than one holder to digital assets. The NFT 2.0 Protocol allows multiple holders to access digital assets. Two authors can now collaborate on a shared product, and two investors can contribute funds in exchange for asset co-ownership.\\n\\nAnother important aspect of the NFT 2.0 protocol is the multi-chain function. The client can mint their NFTs on their preferred networks, such as Ethereum, BSC, and Polkadot, for the highest level of security, transaction fee, and speed. This makes NFTs more usable and allows numerous NFT-based applications, such as NFT games, NFT entertainment, NFT arts, and so on, to join the protocol.\\n\\nDareNFT will be the initial edition of the open NFT Metaverse, with new NFT apps on the way. This is where people can play games with more practical features that reflect real life, consume, use, and reuse Internet content, and connect with one another.\\n\\nThe company has already established around 30 major gaming partnerships as well as  community & media backers. Major names like Gamefi, Knight war, Trade coin and Crypto holding show interest in the remarkable progress done by DareNft.\\n\\nFor the final topic of this post, we believe it's equally important to remember the rapid adoption of Web 3 gaming. The combination of blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and gaming is ushering in a new era for gamers. The game industry is increasingly integrating blockchain and cryptocurrencies, resulting in new user experiences and revenue streams.\\n\\nSome of the most well-known blockchain venture capital firms have launched GameFi, a new investment fund focused to Web 3 gaming, which could pave the way for a profitable business in which cryptocurrency and blockchain merge with traditional gaming.\\n\\nSolana Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and FTX, a derivatives exchange, launched a $100 million GameFi ecosystem fund. According to the companies, the cash would be used to invest in gaming studios, technology companies, and other projects \\\"at the nexus of blockchain and gaming.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1637535327,\"title\":\" Moonvember it is ! \"},\"digest\":\"Ln8bV1OYJ6s32gz_N-7bEkFHp0UqGqymxkYfW0HhtN4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd57722111412Bf8fD260827426202A04de47899F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Ce8zR4j3udL1cxOKHp3g6SS4tK3DX660ib10Kf-uDEI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"7nbkCw2_4M4-mRBCZWQuKHeQ5wdl8ZSyj_W9TlVDwkE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"8ABbHBKOJvP-pP5cNGWCWiALLCoXkzzfhpsmwZiRjbNld7noS2K4lOvR8NfltFJIqGHO3_Z-YCkkgQ4mWzKZIg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xed8568689e8dcde62de5d4be3a928815ae04db0a88e693ecc1b4482ea12a56cf295fc7d630b29645067bdaf83a8879dd2e79db259ecb4ad5319b800050a6a9161b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Ce8zR4j3udL1cxOKHp3g6SS4tK3DX660ib10Kf-uDEI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"7nbkCw2_4M4-mRBCZWQuKHeQ5wdl8ZSyj_W9TlVDwkE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Ln8bV1OYJ6s32gz_N-7bEkFHp0UqGqymxkYfW0HhtN4\"}"
