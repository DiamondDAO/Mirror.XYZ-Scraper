"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"December 28, 2021\\n\\nMy article yesterday was about where I think the future of NFTs is headed, and in short I believe a small number of artists selling 1 of 1 NFTs will dominate the market.  The question is, who are these artists? That is somewhat of a bad question because trying to predict which artists will explode in popularity is an exercise in futility, however I think a distinct style will emerge as the “NFT style”, and from there savvy art collectors and critics can play a Clement Greenberg-esque role in helping create the next Pollock.\\n\\nWhen looking to define a style, there is no better place to look than 19th and 20th century Germany.  IN the 19th Century, Heinrich Hübsch wrote the book, “In What Style Should We Build”, arguing for a rejection of the prevailing neoclassical and Greek revival architecture that dominated German architecture in the 18th century, for a more modern and German style.  While it was unsuccessful in defining a German style, it certainly inspired 20th century architects to a more successful change in German and broad European style.  The Dutch movement De Stijl, literally meaning “The style”, connected with The Bauhaus to create a style that influenced the International style that came to dominate architecture and furniture from post WWII to basically the end of the 20th Century.  Defining a style is important for continuity and influence, and agreed upon styles emerge naturally due to shared experiences, shared aesthetics, and social pressures to fit in.  I think especially because NFTs are in such a nascent stage, they will need to develop a common aesthetic style to grow in influence in the art world.\\n\\nThe lack of defined style for NFTs has hurt its adoption and mass appeal.  Many people’s first engagements with NFTs are through Bored Apes or CryptoPunks.  If the person is not incesetnly thinking about art, technology, and blockchain, the of course NFTs seem stupid.  Why should a horrible drawing of an Ape cost millions of dollars, and why is that the pinnacle of art in this community?  Looking at it from that perspective, it is actually insane that anyone would think NFTs have any real value and that they are more than just a ponzi scheme.  But for those of us interested in NFTs, we can imagine a world past this artistic dark age of digital art and the possibility of digital art coupled with the interesting economic properties of NFTs show lots of promise.  But first we must exit the Dark Age of NFTs, and I think the best way to do that is to define and support a more sophisticated style.\\n\\nWhile plenty of type of art will pass as successful NFTs, I think the most successful pieces will have these 3 traits\\n\\n3d models\\nDynamic\\nAbstract\\n\\nOne of the key critiques of NFTs is that they are no different than normal art, and they are even worse because they are just on a screen and are not real.  This is why I think the best NFTs will have to be unique to the medium in which they are displayed, and offer an artistic experience that cannot be had with current artwork.\\n\\n3d Models\\nThe most novel artistic offering computers offer through NFTs is the ability to interact with art and move it around.  The only way you can do that in real life is by taking a sculpture in your hands and moving it, but I have never had that opportunity, nor do I want to risk accidentally dropping and breaking a sculpture.  There is something really fun about moving an image in any direction and seeing how the experience changes looking at the art from a different perspective.\\n\\nDynamic\\nThe artwork should also be moving.  When paired with a 3d model, being able to see how an artwork moves from different angles creates an entirely new experience each time.  Again, movement is something that most non digital art cannot incorporate, or if the art has aspects that move, it is limited.  This makes the art more interesting to look at and helps differentiate it from the plethora of still digital and physical art.\\n\\nAbstract\\nFinally, the artwork should be abstract.  For some reason, a lot of NFT art is realistic or even hyper-realistic.  While Adolf Loos is not a good guy, his argument in “Ornament and Crime” still holds today for artwork.  The less ornamentation the better, and abstraction is more refined and mature.  Abstract art allows an artist to target the fundamental emotions and essential truths of life, not just represent it through an image or video.  I think this is the most important because most of the art world has been engaged with abstract and conceptual art as contemporary art for the past few decades, and NFTs will not be the vessel that changes contemporary artistic tastes.  While it may seem cynical, even if artists don't like making abstract art, it makes sense to fit in with the rest of the contemporary artists.\\n\\nAn Artist I believe fits all of these traits and represents what I think the “NFT style” will be is @vincemckelvie. His Echo Flow, Butterfly Swarm, and Crash collections on Foundation are perfect early examples of what I believe the most popular NFTs will be.  They are fun to explore, they engage the viewer in a way no other NFTs do, and offer a completely new artistic experience.  He is also very early to the 3d model art as there are only 108 on Foundation, and out of the ones I have seen, his are by far the best.  As the technology develops to allow artists to more seamlessly make 3d model art, we will see an explosion in that style.  Another artist I believe has the aesthetic sensibilities to become a major NFT artist is Chuck Anderson @nopattern.  While he does not make 3d models, his art is dynamic, abstract, and utterly beautiful.  He has the most museum worthy art I have seen in the NFT space, and I think will be one of the first new massive names in NFTs.\\n\\nWhile I believe there will be a dominant style as I outlined above, there is plenty of space for artists who do not fit that mold.  Currently the hottest NFT artist, Beple, does not.  He makes standard digital art that is not 3d, does not move, and is almost never abstract.  His work is exceptional and he has been building a brand for decades.  Another artist, Mad Dog Jones, creates these highly detailed landscapes with mini stories.  He has already seen great success being the most expensive living canadian artist, but I think he could take it to the next level and be one of the greatest landscape artists of all time if he was to expand the length of time of his landscape videos and tell much longer stories in the art work.\\n\\nOk that is it for my writing.  What the fuck is a conclusion just stop reading.\\n\\nWill update goals tomorrow.\\n\\nWC: 1167\",\"timestamp\":1640771929,\"title\":\"De Stijl\"},\"digest\":\"4XIExu9UwYDvzdDcndvTrCUjRzJYk-ZYlMeVlONW3ro\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x11CE580B7D64Fb08F73161AA95835202ae1C9417\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"j1jKRrjSsD3FM4saBPqJm78H5l1kG4hAk1d7jWdMycI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Tp7IvKX8tC_97S4Ce6wRmaSZa54E4F1Ru0OH1LaQI2U\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"pjuxaDKQThNupviGnfi8bQEQQ0ocwAveGtFKRVaInCFnKWro1y6mv-tvxvhiUIhydz30VfCzpYYr7twFLIkllw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa6949fadace177ef2e44a19c43ae6dc1969d58116cd54c8ebfb7b8884c536c837cdd375c62e68551d034b54a14cf9e0d2e1de62b66ff5707f6aba4f2b91073741b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"j1jKRrjSsD3FM4saBPqJm78H5l1kG4hAk1d7jWdMycI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Tp7IvKX8tC_97S4Ce6wRmaSZa54E4F1Ru0OH1LaQI2U\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"4XIExu9UwYDvzdDcndvTrCUjRzJYk-ZYlMeVlONW3ro\"}"
