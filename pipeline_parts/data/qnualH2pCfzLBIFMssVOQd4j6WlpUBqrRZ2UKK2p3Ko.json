"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"A tweet from [Suhail](https://twitter.com/Suhail) asked [“if things aren’t really decentralized on blockchains (due to distribution centralizing ala Coinbase, OpenSea, etc), what is the primary benefit of any web3 application otherwise?”](https://twitter.com/Suhail/status/1477719902811082753). It’s a fair question to ask, and I think there are three primary benefits. \\n\\n![Is there one? (Or three?)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rvbiL3AGd2lBL3eEFpXxL.png?height=440&width=1184)\\n\\n## Centralizing Forces in web3 Aren’t Proprietary\\n\\nEven if distribution is centralizing around services like Coinbase, OpenSea, etc, that centralization is driven only by network effects (mostly “hard side” scale of acquisition and engagement), not proprietary lock-in of digital assets being aggregated on web2 platforms. Proprietary lock-in doesn’t make web2 de facto bad - as many web3 critics have pointed out, proprietary experiences are often very good, otherwise people wouldn’t use them! \\n\\nThe forces that centralize some experiences won’t make them a one-way street. So far, centralized experiences in web3 haven’t been able to prevent a customer from taking things that have value from one platform (like an exchange, NFT auction site, etc) and moving to another. \\n\\n## Composable Compute and Storage > Composable Interfaces\\n\\nThe ability to compose computing resources (and pay for the compute and rent the storage) through gas or rent on a transaction will be superior to merely composing interactions via interfaces. We haven’t fully realized this benefit yet, partly because the economics and incentives with chains like Ethereum are distorted, though I think Avalanche and Solana get us closer.\\n\\nYes, it’s true that the same *infrastructure* can be replicated using web2 (or earlier!) software on any public cloud provider. But that’s like saying any public cloud solution can be replicated by building your own data center, or that you can get the functionality of Dropbox using rsync. It’s technically true, but there are benefits - for some use cases, anyway - to alternative economic and operating models. \\n\\n## Second Order Effects of Data Portability and Standards\\n\\nFinally, the data portability afforded by blockchains will have second order benefits. A parallel to this can be seen with products that were build around the open banking standards in the UK, or using API-based banking aggregators like Plaid in the US. Data portability or standards aren’t inherently useful, but augmented with products that take advantage of those characteristics allows for new, better customer experiences.\\n\\nOne of the advantages inherent in web3 is that this portability and standardization is both built in (by virtue of the distributed nature of how blockchain data is stored) and emergent (by virtue of standards built on top of the data, like the standards that are used for Ethereum coins or NFTs). \\n\\nOf course, we don’t *need* web3 to achieve this. Open banking standards achieved many of the same benefits, industry data standards like HL7 or OFX have been used to create interoperability, and so on. But the web3 approach is *a* way to achieve similar outcomes, while also providing additional benefits (along with some additional baggage).\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis list isn’t comprehensive, but the intersection of these three characteristics is why I believe web3 has value in spite of some centralizing forces. I don’t think we can judge the technology based solely on what we see today - there is still a lot of innovation left to happen. \\n\\nUltimately, we’ll discuss the centralization / decentralization spectrum as having multiple dimensions, and we’ll see benefits from some areas being decentralized while others may become centralized in new or different ways (like what motivated Suhail’s original question).\",\"timestamp\":1641306231,\"title\":\"\\\"If blockchains aren't really decentralized, what's the benefit?\\\"\"},\"digest\":\"Hiil8oBqDwG_46wM4mF7kEhRr2BjnjWao8Qik1SBJ5g\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x74EC61DD83a5948fa3747f5cDf9689E2aaCdfcfA\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tzmoPepMLNK7HiPtVMXet5W-yKkgGzCCfXj53TRqWco\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"GMET-EpWzc__Dx4Y734zNG9Y4mkIyP1_ZuxD02XSGw0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"8lpekIA2US8V4kQcw7GivZHc4jfUVGwVotADML00XVYHxT9Xua4hBwEd_5jQHPXcvhxr74fjPXb--7JsFgSwxw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x122e7fd8fbfcff948f944637155c60afd364d9c993e81071aef49341f5cf8c5f1b83233483d69dc7bd03023b6aa622ab34beea17dcf20a4b83ca7a36c6dae2441b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tzmoPepMLNK7HiPtVMXet5W-yKkgGzCCfXj53TRqWco\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"GMET-EpWzc__Dx4Y734zNG9Y4mkIyP1_ZuxD02XSGw0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"a3fE3zi_89Zj2f_Bc-TYu-xFP5qZNYjN3daSCBDxM_s\"}"
