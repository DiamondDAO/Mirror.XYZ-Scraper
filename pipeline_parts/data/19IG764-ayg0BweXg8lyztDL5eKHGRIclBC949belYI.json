"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Getting involved in web3 is probably the best career move one could do right now. But navigating web3 seas and its turmoils isn't an easy task. Worse than that, imagine buidling something in web3 with zero market visibility and drastic trend shifts happening from one week to another.\\n\\nDeFi, NFTs... So many products have been built the last couple of years for traders. Buidlers are still underserved in the ecosystem.\\n\\n## Signal > Noise\\n\\nAt [The Forge](https://www.theforge.land/), we are creating a **safe space for buidlers** whether they are DAO contributors, NFT collection launchers, crypto entrepreneurs, or VCs. Anyone contributing to moving this space forward.\\n\\nWe launched our Discord in September '21 and quickly felt the enthusiasm as 100 people organically joined it within a week. Based on wise community feedback, we decided to close our gates. We didn't want it to become yet another Discord server that you put in a folder, mark as read every day and finally mute forever. Nurturing quality and avoiding spam was our main priority as any buidler's scarcest resources are time and focus.\\n\\nIn the meantime, the community grew stronger. We structured our activity with first contributors, launched initiatives and invited world-class speakers to share their buidling experience with us. These were perfect foundations to work on an inclusive-yet-qualitative gatekeeping system.\\n\\n## Gates, not moats\\n\\nLearning and meeting like-minded people online shouldn't cost insane amounts of ETH. Still, ensuring quality and flow control is an absolute must to keep the community safe and engaged.\\n\\nWhat we came up with is a **double-gated NFT system**: A **Hammer** NFT to apply to The Forge and an **Anvil** NFT acting as a lifetime access to the community.\\n\\n![The Hammer](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fknMDy3YEUgp9uiLBG-JE.png?height=1600&width=1600)\\n\\nThis is how it all unfolds:\\n\\n* Every buidler in The Forge has 1 invite she can share with friends.\\n* Invites are Hammer NFTs minted on Polygon.\\n* The Hammer doesn't give access to The Forge. It's a pass to apply.\\n* Our knights review every application.\\n* Accepted members join as apprentices. After accomplishing simple quests, they get lifetime access in the form of an Anvil NFT.\\n* Declined applicants can transfer their Hammers to friends or [sell them on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/the-forge-hammer).\\n\\n## Three options to apply\\n\\n1. Get a Hammer from [one of our buidlers](https://www.theforge.land/public-register). You can [fill in this form](https://www.theforge.land/hammer) to notify them you‚Äôre looking for a Hammer.\\n2. [Buy a Hammer on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/the-forge-hammer) from former applicants.\\n3. Bring value to The Forge. Be inventive & make sure we notice.\\n\\nDMs are open on Twitter if you have any question.\\n\\nWe're excited about welcoming new members.\\nTime to BUIDL ‚öíÔ∏è\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nKudos to the stellar knights who made it all possible ü§ç\\n\\n[0xKipit](https://twitter.com/0xKipit) (tech), [0xMikado](https://twitter.com/0xMikado) (tech), [Bob_Lizewski](https://twitter.com/Bob_Lizewski) (community), [RIGHTCLCKSAVEAS](https://twitter.com/RIGHTCLCKSAVEAS) (community), [albiverse](https://twitter.com/albiverse) (community), [0xRoch](https://twitter.com/0xRoch) (community), [BoninTom](https://twitter.com/BoninTom) (community), [impresario_nft](https://twitter.com/impresario_nft) (community).\",\"timestamp\":1641279920,\"title\":\"The Forge opens its gates üö™\"},\"digest\":\"dZ-vjFISDGPbJ39sWrzkR7n5bpBYRwrW1THUOt-iEnk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xDDd22b816019a4E5Da5E048D5f07C4bCaa2Dd471\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GaR9lHOaeAxzjy0gkVImeS7Hv69JRy1E1v8ny5JIwrU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Qh29CCK5MS0D8k58z3HBG8JR5BZ1GVL2tQ58efpd2hw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"J9SlbnAekySNJJBsR87S8XKeLD_k9pPPAh3wiyFRDqYqYEiL4a28EkstLBssT5dPcZfN2xlJXak0lJGMG72x-g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x314fb1b673d12189b6a7b0e54e0745504318f26ec10665590f54ad6498a663af7ed1a4015638dca76d12eb57a8cbc2251efadc0b73a453b733a3ebbbeb36bfbb1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GaR9lHOaeAxzjy0gkVImeS7Hv69JRy1E1v8ny5JIwrU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Qh29CCK5MS0D8k58z3HBG8JR5BZ1GVL2tQ58efpd2hw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"_sZWnqtDlWcEMT3NxZ-gVOTHXhWP760HZMR3upSdJaU\"}"
