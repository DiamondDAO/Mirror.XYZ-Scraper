At the time, Blockdaemon had raised $5.5M since inception in 2017 through multiple seed and venture rounds. I get to know my new teammates virtually and immerse myself in learning Blockdaemon's value to the crypto industry. As a fully remote employee, I also decide to to leave Texas after 7 years and move to LA\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2169qQpEzzWPeM2KgqViu.jpeg?height=935&width=1524)\\n\\n**June 2021:** Blockdaemon announces its $28M Series A. I attend my first in-person crypto conference since the pandemic for Bitcoin Miami and meet many of my teammates in-person. Throughout the summer, more and more talented & passionate people join our weekly team call. At times, it feels chaotic, but the strong leadership and culture at Blockdaemon keeps the energy high.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ls--nhJ6-kIjAO6uFgJ-z.jpeg?height=687&width=916)\\n\\n**September 2021:** While attending the Messari Mainnet conference with my team in NYC, Blockdaemon announces its $155M Series B. I walk through Times Square and see our logo flashing on the big screens as I head to Blockdaemon's reception to meet with clients that are as excited as we are. It hits me again that I am part of growing a special team and still feel that wave of gratitude every day.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XgYAaLeZxWJnI9HmZVNnz.jpeg?height=793&width=1170)\\n\\n**November 2021:** Travel to Lisbon for Breakpoint Solana. I realize how many genuine friends I have made thanks to the crypto space where we have one important thing in common: **we love crypto and we want to change the world**. I find myself incapable of starting the day without tweeting \\\"GM\\\" and ending every conversation with \\\"WAGMI.\\\"\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GH3bT4BKZ-ZiMxK9cSiP0.jpeg?height=1149&width=1728)\\n\\nUpon return to the US, I learn Blockdaemon has secured an office space in Venice where a large number of Daemons reside from different teams. Sales and product convene at the new HQ in and I feel increasingly confident about my decision to move to the west coast.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oUUaYJd6ModUVw_vyLI-R.jpeg?height=1389&width=1986)\\n\\n**December 2021:** Blockdaemon's team has grown to **nearly 180 people.** The entire team is invited to attend the first ever company off-site in Miami. I meet excited, talented, kind, and smart people from all over the US, Europe, and Asia. We gather in beautiful South Beach to learn from each core team what we are building for the crypto industry and our mission to **enable any company to be a crypto company**. Our marketing team showers us with the ultimate swag, including a surprise gift of custom Air Pod Pros left in our rooms while we attend a reception on the final night.\\n\\nIt has been an incredible 9 months and every Daemon is more excited by the day to grow and build out Blockdaemon's products and services to help our existing and future clients. Coming from big tech, it's an unbelievable change to feel the collective genuine desire to help this company grow and succeed.\\n\\nHope everyone had a healthy, safe, and happy 2021 and is as excited as I am for what is to come in 2022! ðŸš€\",\"timestamp\":1640840447,\"title\":\"2021 in-review: joining a crypto start-up\"},\"digest\":\"4uflwFeJSm8l3TI30WOtvogNUT4VVjdtGM8IXxN65Cs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x922b65F0CfB2525ABDe2dfE8f5E488EB6e54893F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fe4BTpM_PPcVz4HDQWPKV-yVVpqu2uqru25mnQb9olk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"prrpi3RBfdTws1IWypU3P_7JBPZcVhQdLzPj69v3Ais\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"QY-zu4u0pPkxxcwOX3i4Cw_aOW34e58II_re-BgCAgO1Lsntf3Jb-llQpbGDaAw021EXPNM71Yil-B3Ns8nB1w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xffd2f4020aba9bbfecc06b63c618c61c6d5ebd1acda5a2bee37c5437d7f7a7b911d8776b63fc274eef8849f283341b3c78a356ef26e19315403b9e7a8bc6e8c11c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fe4BTpM_PPcVz4HDQWPKV-yVVpqu2uqru25mnQb9olk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"prrpi3RBfdTws1IWypU3P_7JBPZcVhQdLzPj69v3Ais\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"SG8P_jhwA1lAkRxeziK-f_xawV92M4pSjCh5Phw2QIg\"}"
