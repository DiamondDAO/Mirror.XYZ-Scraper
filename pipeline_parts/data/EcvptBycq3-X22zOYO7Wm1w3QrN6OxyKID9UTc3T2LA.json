"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1. We will start comparing valuations of Web3 companies to their competition in the legacy world.\\n   1. Example Telecommunication (HNT):\\n      1. HNT Current market cap: $3.8bn and Fully diluted market cap: $8.5bn.Top 10 legacy telecom market cap (as of Jan 2021): $1007.6bn <https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/030216/worlds-top-10-telecommunications-companies.asp> Total Telco market cap: $2.65tn\\n      2. At current token supply: HNT captures 1% of the top 10 market, HNT token price: $100.76. or 0.1% of total telco market cap, HNT token price: $2600\\n      3. Aside from telco’s, HNT is competing with Starlink, Amazon sidewalk etc. FedEx, UPS, Apple etc. could be Frens or foes.\\n      4. 444k hotspots owners (skin in the game). Free marketing, no ad spend, high-profit margins, cheaper service to customers.\\n   2. These comparisons will benefit Web3 startups in Multiple other industry verticals\\n      1. healthcare: MediBloc, Solve\\n      2. insurance:  Nexus Mutual, inSure Defi\\n      3. energy: Energy Web Token, Powerledger\\n      4. real estate: Propy, LABS Group\\n2. P2E will be an unstoppable force.\\n   1. Play to Earn + Great games = Massive Hit. Might not happen this year but the roots are planted.\\n   2. Apple, Google, Epic stand to lose and will start an anti-crypto PR offensive. Might pay game developers more, reduce their take.\\n   3. ETH L2 chain with big gaming push wins L2 race.\\n3. The NFT market will grow in value and we will stop comparing NFT valuations to “just“ the art market.  \\n   1. Majorly all utility NFTs will survive. Could be exclusive group memberships, staking models, token drops etc.\\n   2. Still expect ETH NFTs to big the biggest. Blue-chip NFTs will decrease in value. 99% of the projects will never recover.\\n   3. New entrants with huge marketing campaigns will kill the bubbly NFT market. Scarcity and exclusivity will become important. Won’t see the genesis projects bigger than 10K and might even see smaller numbers.\\n4. All chains including FTM / AVAX / Solana / Polygon will grow\\n   1. Bullish on all EVM chains. Less bullish on Solana. It’s a modular blockchain future.\\n   2. Fantom, Polygon become more decentralized with $STRONG nodes. Hope is the next generation of Degen's care about decentralization.\\n5. DeFi 2.0 will be way bigger than DeFi 1.0\\n   1. TVL in DeFi in 2021 is $246bn. Expect it to hit $2tn this year if a black swan hack doesn't happen.\\n   2. The market cap of OHM and forks will keep growing (if they survive). They sit on huge treasuries of ETH which will remain deflationary.\\n   3. NFTs will spill over to DeFi.\\n\\ncont…\",\"timestamp\":1640909173,\"title\":\"My crypto thoughts (not predictions) for 2022 - part 1\"},\"digest\":\"qfU2hAjIj8mpHb0RspZluEAefmfwVzKhfvEawYYuVVg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xaeaaB17d084beDC792A3CAEe3384F395F618fa7e\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0H1fEQMuyXxKO6Eq0r3ndqGuNq3dqIvs11EZt_6K4UY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"E4Ok-gSuLFo-TxTgTWuDif3TYM_gG7qpHhY_hBmgTZw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"EUb0ipjOqCG2ptvPTeSfclr2OreJgL0vlaQaTYMoAvW9vCLHTuGE9xPlSSwCbsy0btjy7gtiGeBtfABkIn30Vw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4de7264aebd60da710440fd3782d14f79a9862822709aa97ade170c32a1a970d2a80527aff78437381434dea784890b25f96f45f4c92bbf24a47d5b79d1893fb01\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0H1fEQMuyXxKO6Eq0r3ndqGuNq3dqIvs11EZt_6K4UY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"E4Ok-gSuLFo-TxTgTWuDif3TYM_gG7qpHhY_hBmgTZw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"qfU2hAjIj8mpHb0RspZluEAefmfwVzKhfvEawYYuVVg\"}"
