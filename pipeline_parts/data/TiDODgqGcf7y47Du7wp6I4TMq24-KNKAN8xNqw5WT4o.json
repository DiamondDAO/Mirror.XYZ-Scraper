On contrary, while using a non-custodial wallet, you have to secure your keys, seed phrases and password.\\n\\n**NEVER SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEYS!**\\n\\n“Not your keys, not your wallet” or “Don’t share your private keys with anyone!”.\\n\\nYou probably have heard one of the two warnings before. Deciding how to store your funds is a big concern. At that point, you must decide what type of wallet you will use to store. There are two types of wallets:\\n\\n***Non-Custodial Wallet***\\n\\nNon-custodial wallets give you full responsibility for your private keys, seed phrases and funds. Thanks to non-custodial wallets, you don’t have to trust a third party. Once you have created the wallet, you must secure your private keys and find a strong password to use non-custodial wallets. \\n\\nMost of the non-custodial wallets are browser-based or mobile apps like Go Pocket, this type of wallet is also called a hot wallet. On the other side, there are cold wallets like Ledger Nano, these are USB like wallets that store your private keys, offline. \\n\\nThe downside of the non-custodial wallets are that if you lose your seed phrase, forget the password or somehow can’t access your wallet, you can’t recover your wallet so you can’t use your funds anymore. \\n\\nMake sure that you have multiple copies of the seed phrase and password. Also, be sure that no one has physical access to those copies. Non-custodial wallets will play an integral role to achieve a fully decentralized world but it might be hard for newbies.\\n\\n***Custodial Wallets***\\n\\nCustodial Wallets If you have ever used a central exchange before, it means that you have used custodial wallets. In this case, central exchanges hold your funds as a custodian. The exchange has your private keys and seed phrase. It means that they can manage your funds whatever they like. Most exchanges do not abuse that but there are some bad examples in past such as Mt. Gox. Additionally, some central exchanges provide custody services to institutional customers. ETFs/ETPs are an example of custody services, as well as central exchanges.\\n\\n***Comparison***\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Y-w-EBveB2seumcELwGUK.png?height=1476&width=899)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639812384,\"title\":\"Tale of the Two Wallets: Custodial vs Non-Custodial\"},\"digest\":\"8Jd5aas3C1E1h4UTHEI7g-NVnOGWScmxz_t2DfOTG60\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xb4558718acd35B2f2Bc21Ad1a96FbE0E392d18ae\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"yryoX885myInZZ2KAlh2MC62JWbOMG5VMYFqYX0-F64\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"EIvqj7kRECJOasYbY45MB-s1YP0AkIjosfxh5C54y1c\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ox9sIORijAsW_3Hp2aE2tahjhkEK4jbbxcZZe4v3yJJP36an0pZ4W3_mbIRk7Nq6pmMnGD0RuIf6UN91_B-bKQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf0499c7c9dc4af603488c28d51405563f0ace0c39ba54c822c419452715e13e412f6303b4fb823c5a21b0c0e1031d4dc5ca1afd287b74d5666499a5f44b7ec241c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"yryoX885myInZZ2KAlh2MC62JWbOMG5VMYFqYX0-F64\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"EIvqj7kRECJOasYbY45MB-s1YP0AkIjosfxh5C54y1c\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"8Jd5aas3C1E1h4UTHEI7g-NVnOGWScmxz_t2DfOTG60\"}"
