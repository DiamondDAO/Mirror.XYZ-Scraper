"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"HEY APES - \\n  \\n WE’RE USING THE $WINNER TOKEN TO BUY ILLIQUID JPEGS FROM PEOPLE ON SUDOSWAP OR OTHER OTC METHODS (IF YOU’RE A TRUSTWORTHY WINNER).\\n\\nTHE TOKEN NEEDS LIQUIDITY ON UNISWAP FOR VARIOUS REASONS:\\n\\n1. PEOPLE SELLING THEIR MEMES TO THE DAO NEED A PRICE REPORTED ON ETHERSCAN SO THEY CAN CLAIM A TAX LOSS, IF NEEDED.\\n2. PEOPLE THAT WANT TO BUY THEIR NFTS BACK FROM THE DAO CAN DO SO, BUT THEY MUST BUY THEM BACK FOR 15% MORE THAN WHAT THE DAO PURCHASED THEM FOR (THUS THEY MUST BUY TOKENS FROM UNISWAP)\\n   1. EXAMPLE: TIGERBLOOD.ETH SELLS THREE (3) “LIL UZI” NFTS TO THE DAO FOR 30,000 TOKENS. IN 2023, LIL UZI IS FINALLY ARRESTED FOR HIS RUG PULL. THE “LIL UZI” NFTS SEE A PUMP AND TIGERBLOOD.ETH WANTS TO BUY BACK THEIR “LIL UZI” NFTS SO THEY CAN REJOIN THE COMMUNITY AND/OR SELL FOR PROFITS. IN ORDER TO BUY BACK THEIR “LIL UZI” NFTS, THEY MUST PAY THE DAO 34,500 $WINNER TOKENS.\\n   2. EXAMPLE: CSHEEN.ETH SELLS TWO (2) “WINNING!” NFTS TO THE DAO. OBVIOUSLY THESE NFTS ARE EPIC AND INCREDIBLY VALUABLE AT THE TIME OF SALE. THE FLOOR PRICE FOR THESE NFTS IS 2ETH. HE IS SELLING TO THE WINNER DAO BECAUSE THE DAO IS HOSTING AN EPIC CONCERT/GALLERY IN THE SANDBOX. HE RECKONS THIS EVENT WILL PROVIDE HIS “WINNING!” NFTS A TON OF EXPOSURE AND THUS INCREASE THE FLOOR PRICE EVEN MORE. SO HE SELLS THEM TO THE DAO FOR 2,000,000 TOKENS. WHEN THE EVENT IS OVER, HE MUST BUY THEM BACK FROM THE DAO FOR 2,300,000 $WINNER TOKENS.\\n\\nAT A LATER DATE, THE DAO WILL HAMMER DOWN A PRICE CHART FOR DIFFERENT NFTS BASED ON FLOOR PRICE, RARITY AND LIQUIDITY. FOR NOW, WE’RE JUST APING INTO ANYTHING WE CAN GET OUR HANDS ON. SO HIT US UP IF YOU HAVE NFTS TO SELL. AND STOP BUYING OUR TOKEN SO THE PRICE STAYS LOW AND PEOPLE CAN TAKE TAX LOSSES IF NEEDED.\\n\\n**WARNING** IF PRICE CONTINUES TO RISE, WE WILL PULL THE RUG ON LIQUIDITY AND RE-ADD AT A LOWER PRICE. EACH WEEK WE WILL MAKE THIS ADJUSTMENT SO THAT NEW DAO MEMBERS CAN REALIZE LOSSES ON THEIR ILLIQUID JPEGS.\",\"timestamp\":1637213822,\"title\":\"QUICK TOKENOMICS FOR APES\"},\"digest\":\"T52wl1UkDe-Us5_Ns_j4hxzXhbKXzRZzzR9s9X9xRYU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xA77906D1F174eA6800A1F404e17FF652a70dC99b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"mi_Ojy9tsPffZdHAfX3HkyfKHQ4aNtj3zDbGMXtuROQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"OKkyri0OTgPY2qUbTczYazv59nM9n5xuyp6QekBhfMk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"gwejIWALh4jA2GGe0oPovKAaAIo9obcBjnJQy8TyBreZqvOohnkEJclh7-OWuvo7zaP1Ej9Puud-yNuCMFVlBw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe433fa8a74abf71c8e9d5cd56a688508493b1907000d4320bb6184098213ba315ed7874e48ae7d88d036cca4e1fdc17ef69abc10475cdc38a4180eaac28b7ffb1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"mi_Ojy9tsPffZdHAfX3HkyfKHQ4aNtj3zDbGMXtuROQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"OKkyri0OTgPY2qUbTczYazv59nM9n5xuyp6QekBhfMk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"T52wl1UkDe-Us5_Ns_j4hxzXhbKXzRZzzR9s9X9xRYU\"}"
