"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"#### Collaborative art in action\\n\\nThese high ideals often form the basis of small communities, but what happens when the participants set ideals aside and get down to work?\\n\\n[Async Art](https://async.art/) put that to the test with “First Supper,” a collaborative artwork created by 13 separate artists. The piece is dynamic, evolving as the artists themselves decide to build on, or change, their own contributions.\\n\\n> *“We, cryptoartists, gather in this place to celebrate a new dawn for collaboration, creativity, and interaction between artist, collector, and art-lover alike. We hold these tokens to be self-evident, that all layers are created uniquely by individual artists, that each is endowed by their creator with specific immutable rights; that among these are state, rotation, scale, XY position, visibility, opacity, hue, and RGB. That whenever a token holder desires, it is their sole privilege to alter the value of these rights and constitute a new image.”*\\n\\n*“First Supper” by 13 artists, as rendered on March 23, 2020, at 8:23 a.m. EDT*\\n\\nThe way the artists come together online, many then creating physical art in their own locations, is the opposite of the way that traditional artistic movements and collectives have historically emerged. “You have artists from all over coming into it, rather than it spreading out to them,” Read continues.\\n\\nAnd the crypto art world is finding new ways to monetize for long-term sustainability too.\\n\\nArtists have always striven to find ways to fund creation as well while maintaining integrity and creative freedom, something that new crypto-based pull payments like PumaPay might facilitate soon, offering more of a patronage — or Patreon — approach, providing an income to creators while enabling them to maintain artistic liberty.\",\"timestamp\":1639041831,\"title\":\"-parties to digitize and automate any real-world financial derivative.\"},\"digest\":\"1GilTqfgUa8vbgDEZD3J5zsmdGK4D_N-vJ3EwXn4am0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3109FE2f94045e896D8dF765ca502D16BD9d3a23\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"pkssksCEJhHkBFfRvXmN2A7LB8r31nIGeTW-3DV2GBo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"6qmPBUj6oHzYdcJ_YNveNlXH_WBLpKXpz2yR6vf9z0c\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"1Y27EbM7olgbVLhjqq8ghz2MshcKtljC09TyO5iqJ74mOk66TymSu66Ny3wOxECDQhJI8uPZmmbnojq3eLDKsA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x900e19ef12f98d782cf8fe3ab11ebdae218034f9d2311c65c732f6c188fefa561f269f577e7f360fb855d10ed5b7deb798e22fc38c5eb6edb59613fb09c49f3e1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"pkssksCEJhHkBFfRvXmN2A7LB8r31nIGeTW-3DV2GBo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"6qmPBUj6oHzYdcJ_YNveNlXH_WBLpKXpz2yR6vf9z0c\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"1GilTqfgUa8vbgDEZD3J5zsmdGK4D_N-vJ3EwXn4am0\"}"
