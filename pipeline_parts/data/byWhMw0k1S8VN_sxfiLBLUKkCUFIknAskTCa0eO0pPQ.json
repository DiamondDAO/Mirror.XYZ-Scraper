"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"OpenSourceFutures (OSF) is an entity focused on the systematic exploration of possible futures that might unfold, based on understanding the trends that had been occurring. It looks backwards to try to perceive and re-perceive the present, and forwards to look at the possible trajectories. OSF is based in Singapore and writes at Medium as [Open Source Futures](www.medium.com/open-source-futures) and on the [Patreon](www.patreon.com/opensourcefutures). \\n\\nOSF uses foresight methodologies, such as scenarios analysis, causal layered analysis, and other tools. There are other times when OSF will lay out a conceptual framework or describe events that are happening. And sometimes, there are book reviews as well.\\n\\nOSF believes that the futures can be explored immersively, and sometimes the best way to learn about it is to try and use it, and thatâ€™s why OSF is on the Mirror platform.\",\"timestamp\":1640241872,\"title\":\"Who/What is OpenSourceFutures?\"},\"digest\":\"C_jKER6NfVulVIogTVQiUwjVKT6-EcFtnNCk3zCzb98\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xcC4B13f56E7697Ac6ab788CB192965F0F4caB02A\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7gTDz-OFM9F1ktnaTmb4QmRR8oXjVPLM7_WB3d07dlo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ba2zjwAY-qO7hMI0LXog08xFQSn8m73pllV8L_k_gRQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"uI_ImE_SK2eTI8ZujMguzlDCgc-hDZBOSRj2PUzzIJp7qYYMpVBoUi1U8dtci2-ibi4yWEQRR19DEANxWuVNgQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9268fe1afa3d86ec9a4471f17a27f83d78550bb3cc22fd3127ddda1b74afc15037db3ac1735c69cdaa34fba60597d90cd7c8c68dc041d8515f7c78c53041ea191b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7gTDz-OFM9F1ktnaTmb4QmRR8oXjVPLM7_WB3d07dlo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ba2zjwAY-qO7hMI0LXog08xFQSn8m73pllV8L_k_gRQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"MdrsSlaYOJsis5h-C4RDzP2tkSdaxlhSiIGwYs_zA1c\"}"
