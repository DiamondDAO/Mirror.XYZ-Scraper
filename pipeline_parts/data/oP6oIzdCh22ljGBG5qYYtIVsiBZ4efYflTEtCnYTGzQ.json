That’s why our DeBank team decided to contribute our long-term industry experience and redefine the user experience for extension wallets under real DeFi usage scenarios.\\n\\n## Smooth multi-chain user experience\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*u4i_Pmi_hqh75Q6F)\\n\\nToday’s DeFi has evolved into a multi-chain ecosystem and almost every DeFi user is using multiple chains at the same time. Traditional MetaMask-like extension wallets are designed with single-chain scenario initially, making it hard to bring truly user-friendly multi-chain experience to you.\\n\\nIt is a nightmare to frequently switch among different chains while using DeFi on multiple chains at the same time. This is really inconvenient and error-prone.\\n\\nRabby is designed for multi-chain scenarios and it associates corresponding chain settings for each DeFi Dapp. When you visit a DeFi Dapp for the first time, Rabby will automatically choose the corresponding chain for this site based on our database. You can also switch to another chain for a specific DeFi manually, but the settings will only work for that site.\\n\\nIn old days, when you open Uniswap (on Ethereum) and PancakeSwap (on BSC) in two tabs at the same time, you have to switch between Ethereum and BSC networks back and forth from time to time. This is really annoying.\\n\\nBut now Rabby has taken care all of that and will save you from these troublesome switching operations.\\n\\n## Understand what you are really signing\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*pAPQiEH2McubKjOw)\\n\\nNowadays, on-chain transactions are no longer simple token transfers any more. Almost every transaction involves complicated contract call operations. The confirmation pop-up window from traditional extension wallets does not clearly explain what does the transaction exactly do. 99% of DeFi users are blindly signing transactions they don’t really understand at all, which is extremely risky for their life savings.\\n\\nBased on DeBank’s previous experience in DeFi, we managed to parse the transaction content for you in Rabby’s signing confirmation pop-up window. Rabby helps you understand what you are really signing and show your estimated balance change before you sign.\\n\\n## Pre-transaction risk scanning\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*XRkBAT8ff7FRSqc7)\\n\\nWe find out that traditional extension wallets are not doing good enough to protect you from these massive security vulnerabilities come with the rapid growth of DeFi.\\n\\nRabby sends every transaction into a security engine for screening before you sign it to help you identify the potential risks hidden behind. Rabby will alert you if it finds potential vulnerabilities such as “The interacting contract has been attacked before”, “The recipient address does not exist on the chain”, etc.\\n\\nRabby will keep updating its security rules and work with security audit companies to expand our category of security rules to continuously help guarding your assets.\\n\\nUnlike other products, Rabby is designed and developed with a higher standard as it is directly involved in every transaction you sign and guards your assets security.\\n\\nRabby takes both security and user experience seriously and follows below rules:\\n\\n## Being open sourced\\n\\nOpen source is one of the most important things in the crypto world. Rabby insists on being open sourced and is the only one that uses the most friendly MIT license among mainstream extension wallets.\\n\\n## Being decentralized\\n\\nRabby firmly believes that your assets should always be entirely held in your hand. Your private keys are stored on the front-end side only and can be exported by you at any time, which is entirely independent on Rabby’s back-end services.\\n\\n## Less is more\\n\\nRabby only includes necessary functions for an extension wallet and you can use Rabby with other DeFi Dapps together to meet various needs in a very neat way.\\n\\nKeeping core functions only also makes Rabby much easier to be audited and safer for you to use.\\n\\n## Not involve in constructing any transaction\\n\\nRabby believes that a good extension wallet should act as an independent third-party gatekeeper from you and your visiting DeFi Dapp when you sign a transaction. If Rabby takes part in constructing the transaction itself, then Rabby is being both a player and a referee. Therefore, Rabby does not construct any transaction under any circumstance, but only helps you confirm and sign the transaction initiated by the DeFi Dapp you visit.\\n\\n## Security over user experience\\n\\nAll user experience optimizations in Rabby are made on the premise that no new security risk is introduced.\\n\\n1.  Rabby’s private key management module is developed based on the well-tested and proven components from MetaMask.\\n2.  Rabby’s security does not depend on back-end services (including the security rules API), and it does not introduce any new risks to transactions in case the back-end services are unavailable or compromised.\\n\\nAlso, Rabby’s source code has already been audited by the professional security audit company.\\n\\n## Privacy protection\\n\\nIn order to enhance user experience, Rabby send necessary information to our back-end servers in specific scenarios, but all related functions follow strict privacy protection principles:\\n\\n1.  Rabby will not upload any information about your current visiting page. Only when you visit a DeFi Dapp and clicks the “Connect” button or initiates a transaction, the domain name of your visiting site (without the full page path) is uploaded.\\n2.  Your signing content may include some private information. When Rabby handles security checks for such content, these information will not be uploaded unless you click the confirmation button.\\n3.  Rabby does not set any tracking parameters for all back-end services.\\n\\nYou can find Rabby in the Chrome Web Store. **Download link:**\\n\\nIn addition, Rabby supports a very cool “**Watcher Mode”**. You can start to experience Rabby’s features by simply adding any address without importing its private key. You can experience as this address owner’s view in a quite convenient and risk-free way.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1640875634,\"title\":\"Rabby Release Announcement - Rabby - Medium\"},\"digest\":\"syR1nTDDuuQ_VEuwyu3e_UTov1OsLZorHOQAXe6DIv0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x979AbfF1D6b676CeAC21AEeD3d800d48e6775be2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cSoZaS3NIR9wBfebiXTwpp2Hva-xOI6re1FeI7UAPUQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dub_a8maeTqLsSsviTJQFrw8USUEajKnAC-f_kIvRb8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"OZtdGvMlwkcq9rDL0z4wxlz5V2EnJkQp6FwY3k4Pzwo4MKpXN4PjfeG9u40b7Is48JwWyNM8BPQc2Hqfj0sWsw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xbcda843cba5d6834ab71f58153c5b4ef182b1b081a47b0447845e695377f89d513d5954d7d81ecb56c38981121a4d3f2a38d47b0a4394dc59fdbdcfa1ed153ab1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cSoZaS3NIR9wBfebiXTwpp2Hva-xOI6re1FeI7UAPUQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dub_a8maeTqLsSsviTJQFrw8USUEajKnAC-f_kIvRb8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"syR1nTDDuuQ_VEuwyu3e_UTov1OsLZorHOQAXe6DIv0\"}"
