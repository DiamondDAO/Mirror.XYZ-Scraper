And pause some of the things that aren’t. \\n\\nWe also hope to start eliciting more feedback and interaction from the community. That’s part of why we’re on Mirror and starting to move into the realm of blockchain-enabled community initiatives. \\n\\nMore on that, and our vision and plan for this thing in the coming weeks and months, as we fully embrace this building in public thing. \\n\\nOnward.\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1635326269,\"title\":\"Where we are with Bountiful.Work \"},\"digest\":\"aJBEHnWEsllH9We5xMadwpZRpfqNL2cpeJ62aMHSVnI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa003BAAa042eCAEEeB8720D02f459115aE6c96DF\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GkHpjGAWq8n9djN3lKbrmGfj2zH-wV0mz7amFRpW3xE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"bcC9SlpdRD9L28HL7hVGzTy8VrYE7drGg8LqgnStzWU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"yy8zSQyv7eK7IsZOzQU-qQ6iMjDA1k61KMiCepuStaPF6BI8GafpmwpgXyDdbFw0_ejjdvevk3j3nqaztMOMkA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9e2efac6f941059d5f20a6efc129dc03de0db7f9b930fad4fbf5333764874ee76deba99a44c29a29dea13b4f89b42d576c8fce4a23a47845498df61a9ed9e6d61c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GkHpjGAWq8n9djN3lKbrmGfj2zH-wV0mz7amFRpW3xE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"bcC9SlpdRD9L28HL7hVGzTy8VrYE7drGg8LqgnStzWU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"aJBEHnWEsllH9We5xMadwpZRpfqNL2cpeJ62aMHSVnI\"}"
