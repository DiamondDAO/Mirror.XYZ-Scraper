"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Many of our bosses also like to set posts and assign responsibilities. Let employees go to and from work on time, and the work is done in the company. Let me give you an example:\\n\\nWe hire an administrative clerk and give her 4000 yuan a month. Work 8 hours a day. Come to work in the morning, from 8 to 12, nothing to do, browse the web there and watch Taobao. During the lunch break, from 12 to 13 o’clock, it happens that a contract is needed. This time is the lunch break. Ask her to make a contract. She is emotional. Waiting until 1 o’clock in the afternoon to go to work and make a contract, it’s too late. The whole business chain is because This administrative clerk is going to take a lunch break, and the time has been pushed back by 1 hour. This problem arises because the boss himself has given time to death, and employees have developed the habit of having nothing to do with her when they go to work, when they go to work, and when they leave work.\\n\\nThis is actually the style of state-owned enterprises, public institutions, and a product of a planned economy. It is very outdated and backward. In the fierce market economy competition, if an enterprise operates under such a system, its competitiveness can be imagined.\\n\\nWhat will happen to this kind of job assignment and responsibilities? Is this clerk for a month\\n\\nShe had nothing to do, but there were a lot of things in the second month and she had to work overtime continuously. At this time, she would feel emotional. Sometimes, she has nothing to do during the day, but the company's business is received at 8 o'clock in the evening, and a contract is needed. She is off work, and the marketing department is waiting for the contract to be signed! Are you going to push the matter until tomorrow morning again? Another example is the company's driver. It's not clear when to leave the car. How can they learn from public institutions, state-owned enterprises, assign jobs, and assign responsibilities?\\n\\nSo how do you play? In fact, it’s very simple. Tell you everyone who comes to work in the company, saying that everyone comes to the company to complete the company’s goals. Do your best. Tell the driver that you are here to drive and help the company complete the tasks that require driving. The goals and tasks are not always certain when they appear, but they must be resolved when they do. The company's design department, marketing department, finance department, and production department all do this. This concept must be instilled in every employee's head.\\n\\nThe company must weaken the operating method of the job responsibility system. As long as the goal appears, everyone will cooperate and complete it as soon as possible. This is a flexible team and a competitive enterprise.\\n\\nDon’t talk about being people-oriented. If the goal is not achieved, the business will go bankrupt if things are not done well, and there will be no food to eat. For example, some drivers, he pulls goods to customers, and when they arrive, they don’t help customers move goods. The boss asks him Why not move the goods, he said that he is only responsible for driving. Regardless of the others. Such employees are actually cultivated by their bosses who embarrass themselves and offend customers. With so many employees, the company has no competitiveness. You need to find a driver who can help customers move goods or train drivers to do so, and those who do not do well will be fired directly.\\n\\nNatural selection, survival of the fittest. Every boss quickly replace the company’s job responsibility system with a target responsibility system, and replace the planned economy and political economy with the business philosophy of market economy. And instill this set of ideas to every employee.\",\"timestamp\":1634794170,\"title\":\"Please play goal accountability\"},\"digest\":\"NWwwpHlX2F-fu_EU4IuqW6Duxv7KWqUEtK457iwJyWY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"BU-KhB7xD5LNGgOE1cLXU5yyiFReVAxKPjag3OLHN71wnxdFWON7RHtaZt05RQEw1UHiRjZ_Iyx5e7HPtgTl-Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"NWwwpHlX2F-fu_EU4IuqW6Duxv7KWqUEtK457iwJyWY\"}"
