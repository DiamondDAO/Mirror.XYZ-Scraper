"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Dr. Welshmere nodded in reply to Sheldon's look of inquiry, and Viaburi was dispatched for the whisky and siphons.\\n\\n\\\"It is evident, Captain Oleson,\\\" Sheldon remarked to that refreshed mariner, \\\"that Miss Lackland has run away with your boat.  Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Right O; here goes.  I'd just come in on the Flibberty.  She was on board before I dropped the hook--in that whale-boat of hers with her gang of Tahiti heathens--that big Adamu Adam and the rest. 'Don't drop the anchor, Captain Oleson,' she sang out.  'I want you to get under way for Poonga-Poonga.'  I looked to see if she'd been drinking.  What was I to think?  I was rounding up at the time, alongside the shoal--a ticklish place--headsails running down and losing way, so I says, 'Excuse me, Miss Lackland,' and yells for'ard, 'Let go!'\\n\\n\\\"'You might have listened to me and saved yourself trouble,' says she, climbing over the rail and squinting along for'ard and seeing the first shackle flip out and stop.  'There's fifteen fathom,' says she; 'you may as well turn your men to and heave up.'\\n\\n\\\"And then we had it out.  I didn't believe her.  I didn't think you'd take her on as a partner, and I told her as much and wanted proof.  She got high and mighty, and I told her I was old enough to be her grandfather and that I wouldn't take gammon from a chit like her.  And then I ordered her off the Flibberty.  'Captain Oleson,' she says, sweet as you please, 'I've a few minutes to spare on you, and I've got some good whisky over on the Emily.  Come on along. Besides, I want your advice about this wrecking business. Everybody says you're a crackerjack sailor-man'--that's what she said, 'crackerjack.'  And I went, in her whale-boat, Adamu Adam steering and looking as solemn as a funeral.\\n\\n\\\"On the way she told me about the Martha, and how she'd bought her, and was going to float her.  She said she'd chartered the Emily, and was sailing as soon as I could get the Flibberty underway.  It struck me that her gammon was reasonable enough, and I agreed to pull out for Berande right O, and get your orders to go along to Poonga-Poonga.  But she said there wasn't a second to be lost by any such foolishness, and that I was to sail direct for Poonga- Poonga, and that if I couldn't take her word that she was your partner, she'd get along without me and the Flibberty.  And right there's where she fooled me.\\n\\n\\\"Down in the Emily's cabin was them three soaks--you know them-- Fowler and Curtis and that Brahms chap.  'Have a drink,' says she. I thought they looked surprised when she unlocked the whisky locker and sent a nigger for the glasses and water-monkey.  But she must have tipped them off unbeknownst to me, and they knew just what to do.  'Excuse me,' she says, 'I'm going on deck a minute.'  Now that minute was half an hour.  I hadn't had a drink in ten days.  I'm an old man and the fever has weakened me.  Then I took it on an empty stomach, too, and there was them three soaks setting me an example, they arguing for me to take the Flibberty to Poonga-Poonga, an' me pointing out my duty to the contrary.  The trouble was, all the arguments were pointed with drinks, and me not being a drinking man, so to say, and weak from fever . . .\\n\\n\\\"Well, anyway, at the end of the half-hour down she came again and took a good squint at me.  'That'll do nicely,' I remember her saying; and with that she took the whisky bottles and hove them overside through the companionway.  'That's the last, she said to the three soaks, 'till the Martha floats and you're back in Guvutu. It'll be a long time between drinks.'  And then she laughed.\\n\\n\\\"She looked at me and said--not to me, mind you, but to the soaks: 'It's time this worthy man went ashore'--me! worthy man!  'Fowler,' she said--you know, just like a straight order, and she didn't MISTER him--it was plain Fowler--'Fowler,' she said, 'just tell Adamu Adam to man the whale-boat, and while he's taking Captain Oleson ashore have your boat put me on the Flibberty.  The three of you sail with me, so pack your dunnage.  And the one of you that shows up best will take the mate's billet.  Captain Oleson doesn't carry a mate, you know.'\\n\\n\\\"I don't remember much after that.  All hands got me over the side, and it seems to me I went to sleep, sitting in the stern-sheets and watching that Adamu steer.  Then I saw the Flibberty's mainsail hoisting, and heard the clank of her chain coming in, and I woke up.  'Here, put me on the Flibberty,' I said to Adamu.  'I put you on the beach,' said he.  'Missie Lackalanna say beach plenty good for you.'  Well, I let out a yell and reached for the steering- sweep.  I was doing my best by my owners, you see.  Only that Adamu gives me a shove down on the bottom-boards, puts one foot on me to hold me down, and goes on steering.  And that's all.  The shock of the whole thing brought on fever.  And now I've come to find out whether I'm skipper of the Flibberty, or that chit of yours with her pirating, heathen boat's-crew.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Never mind, skipper.  You can take a vacation on pay.\\\"  Sheldon spoke with more assurance than he felt.  \\\"If Miss Lackland, who is my partner, has seen fit to take charge of the Flibberty-Gibbet, why, it is all right.  As you will agree, there was no time to be lost if the Martha was to be got off.  It is a bad reef, and any considerable sea would knock her bottom out.  You settle down here, skipper, and rest up and get the fever out of your bones.  When the Flibberty-Gibbet comes back, you'll take charge again, of course.\\\"\\n\\nAfter Dr. Welshmere and the Apostle departed and Captain Oleson had turned in for a sleep in a veranda hammock, Sheldon opened Joan's letter.\\n\\nDEAR MR. SHELDON,--Please forgive me for stealing the Flibberty- Gibbet.  I simply had to.  The Martha means everything to us. Think of it, only fifty-five pounds for her, two hundred and seventy-five dollars.  If I don't save her, I know I shall be able to pay all expenses out of her gear, which the natives will not have carried off.  And if I do save her, it is the haul of a life- time.  And if I don't save her, I'll fill the Emily and the Flibberty-Gibbet with recruits.  Recruits are needed right now on Berande more than anything else.\\n\\nAnd please, please don't be angry with me.  You said I shouldn't go recruiting on the Flibberty, and I won't.  I'll go on the Emily.\\n\\nI bought two cows this afternoon.  That trader at Nogi died of fever, and I bought them from his partner, Sam Willis his name is, who agrees to deliver them--most likely by the Minerva next time she is down that way.  Berande has been long enough on tinned milk.\\n\\nAnd Dr. Welshmere has agreed to get me some orange and lime trees from the mission station at Ulava.  He will deliver them the next trip of the Apostle.  If the Sydney steamer arrives before I get back, plant the sweet corn she will bring between the young trees on the high bank of the Balesuna.  The current is eating in against that bank, and you should do something to save it.\\n\\nI have ordered some fig-trees and loquats, too, from Sydney.  Dr. Welshmere will bring some mango-seeds.  They are big trees and require plenty of room.\",\"timestamp\":1638930790,\"title\":\"And then she's hired them drunken loafers, three of the worst scoundrels that ever disgraced the\"},\"digest\":\"pJSQkbiKcnGJHjcBJZefTiTvoL6BtjqiuNgEBFNBe_Q\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9657e9353C2fAbB7cFDcd22Fb91D23149b982AE8\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"K80vuj5LS1Cqm_Kr8jLcs8kvOx5b-YDKc5wdIwk6T-o\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"bArqblgQiv5lsMwgZntfICpRqZFUXvi1BOIDgFVJGKk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"5tiWNj5J5duRVOC7I3DyXGpKpT3W36S_wQ9WcOttzbqBP3agqCiT_K81e_XmybbCrVDLisl7TN9yBdx_-GN0kA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xbea0fa24b66f39ecd8edf2d7069a46fb4d3ecccbfe4817d8c9c01a29cdfb669e7ba1f571ebb76f503dc7b0fc6549c169214cfccfe32a20ba23d90fe1c8254c231b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"K80vuj5LS1Cqm_Kr8jLcs8kvOx5b-YDKc5wdIwk6T-o\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"bArqblgQiv5lsMwgZntfICpRqZFUXvi1BOIDgFVJGKk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"pJSQkbiKcnGJHjcBJZefTiTvoL6BtjqiuNgEBFNBe_Q\"}"
