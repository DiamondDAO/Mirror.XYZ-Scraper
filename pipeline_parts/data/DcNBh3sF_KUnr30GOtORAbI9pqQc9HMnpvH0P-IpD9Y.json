"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"My dad came to know about the plant from Mr. Rao, our neighbor, and his good\\nfriend. Mr. Rao claimed that the leaves of the plant will control diabetes if taken in\\nthe morning along with breakfast. So, dad got a couple of twigs from Mr.Rao and\\nplanted them in our garden. \\n \\nWhen dad became diabetic in his 60th year, he decided to try the plant along with\\nhis regular dose of Metformin. It had a heavy stench and was bitter as hell. Within a\\nweek of eating the leaves, his sugar levels came back to normal and he was back to\\nwalking the streets of Ambattur, meeting friends, making stops, and drinking tea\\nhis routine for several years. \\n \\nAlong the way, he told his friends about the magical plant and its powers, which led\\nto his friends coming home and getting leaves of the plant. And, a lot of them came\\nback for more. \\n \\nSoon, dad became the guardian of the plant as Mr.Rao sold his house and moved to\\nMangalore. My dad didn't know the name of the plant, or how it controlled diabetes.\\nBut, he decided whom to give and how much to give. Once he refused to give the\\nleaves to my friend's mom as she asked for a whole plant instead of the leaves. The\\nmadness of power I guess :) \\n \\nHe even had a plan to powder the leaves and sell them as capsules. I said it was a\\nbad idea and we'd go to jail. So, he dropped the plan. Once we went to Presidency\\ncollege's Botany department to ask for the scientific name of the plant and they told\\nus it was Clerodendrum inerme. But, for some reason, we didn't pursue any\\nresearch on the plant after that. \\n \\nWhen we sold our house, the only plant my dad decided to keep was the\\nClerodendrum. So, we cut a piece of it and planted it in the apartment we moved to.\\nThe plant grew well. \\n \\nSo many things have changed since then. Mr.Rao passed away. A new apartment\\ncomplex was built in our old place. My dad completed his course on this planet, I\\ngot married and moved to the far end of the city. But, the plant is still there, sitting in\\nour apartment, breathing life in the form of a stench that I always hated.\",\"timestamp\":1637811457,\"title\":\"#21 The Plant That Survived Time\"},\"digest\":\"eBSkhFSUunqE0s0WKL1VZUm8zBIl1K5ffHNQVDF3Ung\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5F882566e4B071Ec1565Ed633EDBFB5c902dCA74\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8_uGVGdfFjLSJWYd0zMXytofzonHacRrnRv2eKJFt2Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_ZD7ifRsXTRvXXBU3V2IkPZAMDhECIUxIelNusRyYms\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"UN11CiCWX3gHVLtbChxg_r4BwbR5nS8_nO_iEOkpB6Cmb4Mu3CtLYfKMOLbKgsEQxecGZH38qgrNq9Yd-pb77Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5dad564490ee162511d60b533a5ad5d7949efface30fb34d4338a146b02755d9025af55c5b65bcd4dbc7213a59304f21b2e17848f3ef96f5b0b359f3399243151c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8_uGVGdfFjLSJWYd0zMXytofzonHacRrnRv2eKJFt2Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_ZD7ifRsXTRvXXBU3V2IkPZAMDhECIUxIelNusRyYms\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"eBSkhFSUunqE0s0WKL1VZUm8zBIl1K5ffHNQVDF3Ung\"}"
