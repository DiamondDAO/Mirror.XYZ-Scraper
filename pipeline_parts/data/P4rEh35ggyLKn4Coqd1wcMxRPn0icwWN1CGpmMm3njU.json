We govern, share, and maintain them as a society. While imperfect in how they are built or administered, these objects draw us together in dialogue, debate, and common concern (Honig, 2017). More than mere things, natural landscapes and built environments are cultural touchpoints. They involve us in care for the public good.\\n\\n![Roman aqueduct of Pont du Gard, now recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Clean air is an example of a naturally occurring public good, while the electric grid is a public good created by people. What are the public goods of today's industrial-knowledge society? Open source code, which supports millions of companies and independent developers, is often thought of this way. The cypherpunks considered privacy itself as a kind of public good. It seems only natural that online media archives and open digital infrastructure should qualify as well.\\n\\nMore recently, Vitalik Buterin and others in the cryptocurrency community have taken up the rhetoric of blockchain mechanisms as public goods. To be sure, crypto protocols are among the most compelling novel institutional forms. Their unique capabilities derive from their \\\"public\\\" qualities: unrestricted membership and participation, open APIs, transparent allocation of resources and power. But at the same time many of their characteristics contradict claims of public accessibility. Can crypto protocols be considered public goods if ownership is concentrated in the hands of a few whales? Colloquially, these market primitives are sometimes described as \\\"public infrastructure,\\\" but if blockchains serve a \\\"public\\\" today, it is primarily one of decentralized finance. Fundamentally, these tokenholders share only one common object of concern: price.\\n\\nSo while crypto protocols may qualify as public goods in the economic sense, where in these conversations is discussion of what's good for the public? Some of the crypto community's stated ambitions are to solve mass coordination problems, build post-national forms of sovereignty, and level the global playing field. But to create a majestic and egalitarian society requires a more expansive vision of public goods than what can be imagined with economics alone.\\n\\n![Ancient Ruins Used as Public Baths, Hubert Robert (1798)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/81fd1a35-4953-49c1-b54c-3ec794ec8db4.jpeg?height=853&width=1247)\\n\\nThe public bath houses of the Romans, accessible to both rich and poor, were the cornerstone of both the city's public health and its rich cultural life. At its peak, the Library of Alexandria held hundreds of thousands of texts, among the largest stores of public knowledge in the ancient world. Although exclusionary in many respects, these wonders are precursors to the public goods we know today. They point towards an ideal of openness and universality. As builders of a new digital society, we must be equipped with an even more inclusive and visionary concept of what \\\"public\\\" and \\\"good\\\" can mean. As protocol treasuries transition to community stewardship of public works, it's time to imagine how crypto protocols might uniquely conceive of public goods.\\n\\n## The Scope of the Public\\n\\nOur new understanding of public goods starts by exploring notions of the public. What makes something public? What constitutes *the* public?\\n\\nThe vernacular term \\\"public\\\" is understood to be something of the people, freely available for use—such as parks, roads, and common lands. Crypto protocols' strongest claim to publicness is based on this principle of open and permissionless access. Blockchains overcome a key limitation of Web 1 and Web 2 publics: their failure to satisfy the criteria of inalienable access. The internet's so-called \\\"public spaces\\\" are nothing like our cities' public parks. They are merely someone else's private server, where access can be revoked at will. By contrast, crypto protocols deliberately enforce unimpeded access.\\n\\nBut a public is more than a means of access to public space. Another key definition is a public as body of people, defined in relation to some political association. In 17th century England, a newly uncensored press circulated articles of public opinion, including notes from salon gatherings and critical journals. Often reproachful of the state, these published media brought \\\"private people together as a public\\\" for the first time (Habermas, 1989). Less than a century later, French revolutionaries orchestrated a new peoples' self-consciousness by organizing festivals, erecting monuments, and designating new communal spaces (Ozouf, 1975). In both instances, political bodies were raised to the status of institutions by establishing new venues for storytelling—venues in which people could begin to identify themselves as part of a collective whole, that is, a public.\\n\\n![Festival of the Supreme Being, organized in 1794 to inaugurate the new state religion after the French Revolution.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0c066ec4-6837-4f4f-b8de-4d6ac8cc7f01.jpeg?height=775&width=1120)\\n\\nThis notion of the public as a self-conscious entity has also taken hold on the internet, where adoption is driven by *publication* and circulation of media. To publish a web document or software application is more than making something public: it's an act of making a public (Warner, 2002). Cryptocurrency advocates often draw on this idea when they refer to token holders as a \\\"community,\\\" or compare protocols to nations with citizens. Sovereign moneys created by blockchains certainly offer a ready comparison to sovereign states, and their immutability means APIs can't be modified or revoked without broad consensus.\\n\\nThese ideas feed the notion of crypto protocols as public goods, yet together they present a complicated picture. Despite their \\\"open\\\" qualities, crypto protocols do not yet offer a satisfying answer to the scope of the public they address.\\n\\nIn today's crypto ecosystems, token-based membership determines key considerations such as resource allocation, on-chain incentives, and off-chain decision-making. While a blockchain's censorship resistance may seem like the solution to a world of gatekeepers, in reality, pay-to-play limits access in other ways. Protocols may be owned by thousands, even millions of stakeholders, but they are not in everyone's benefit—only those who have the time, expertise, or resources to participate.\\n\\nWhat then are the implications of defining a public as a set of users? Web 2 platforms offer us a crucial lesson. The social media platforms which dominate the web today claim to be tools made for \\\"communities\\\" of users who have opted to participate—but these platforms have also produced wide-reaching negative externalities: effects on third parties who did not agree to incur their costs. The externalities of platforms include incursions on personal privacy, the spread of misinformation, the devaluation of creative labor, even destabilization of the democratic process. These effects are often cited as a primary motivation for those now working in Web 3 to now establish sovereign spaces built on a foundation of public accountability.\\n\\nWhile social platforms offer one example of a misconstrued public, nascent Web 3 \\\"public spaces\\\" suffer similar problems of definition, scope, and representation. The equivalence of stake and voice in crypto is reminiscent of early American democracy, in which political representation was conditioned on property ownership. Under this regime, only 6% of the total US population was eligible to vote—a laughably exclusionary idea of the body politic by today's standards (Ratcliffe, 2013). Recall that the universal suffrage, human rights, and public services we enjoy today are the products of struggle by those who were excluded from the designated public to have their voice represented. In fact, the theory of \\\"counterpublics\\\" specifically addresses groups who are not admitted within the larger public sphere, groups whose members may not be deemed as persons (Warner, 2002).\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6d2e8d08-4c83-4cf3-85cd-0d19372d885a.jpeg?height=1754&width=1072)\\n\\nSo it's clear that defining the scope of the public is key to understanding what public goods will mean. By equating membership in a public with ownership of a currency, we lose sight of important stakeholders and opportunities for coalition-building. The most consequential members of the crypto-public today are those who hold the most tokens, meaning even small holders are effectively removed from the conversation about what's in their benefit. Moreover, within this designated public exist people that may hold very different notions of the public good. By engaging with the underrepresented fringes that make up the wider crypto community, we can gain a deeper understanding of the public that we are building for and how to best serve them.\\n\\nWhen we think of the public, we should think expansively. This is not to say that we must consider everyone in the world as a part of our public. As we emphasized in our essay on squads, we also celebrate small, self-selective communities and trust-based groups. But by considering the effects (positive and negative) that we might have on groups at the margins—whether nocoiners, non-technical family members, or simply future participants in this public domain—we increase the potential for greater public upside and decrease the risk of negative externalities.\\n\\nPut simply: who belongs in this great post-national society the crypto community aims to build? Paraphrasing Michael Warner, a public always exceeds one's known protocol. It is a relation among strangers that's historically contingent and culturally complex. A public is constituted by the friends you have never met, with whom you share cultural coordinates without even knowing it. How does what we build render benefits for the most people possible?\\n\\nIn order to address this, let's turn to the \\\"good\\\" in public goods.\\n\\n## The Moral Basis of the Public \\\"Good\\\"\\n\\nHow do we determine what counts as a public good? So far we've started by questioning who exactly the public is. But even if we went along with the claim that publics = tokenholders, what exactly does this tell us about this public? Who are these tokenholders? What beliefs do they collectively hold?\\n\\nConsider a classic public good: a public park. We might say park visitors are generically \\\"users\\\" of this public space, or that anyone within driving distance is adequately served. But this categorization feels distinctly unsatisfying. \\\"User\\\" does not capture meaningful detail about a population that collectively values free access to protected forest or shoreline. Why are public parks more desirable than public parking lots? This brings us to an important realization: any definition of public goods presupposes a shared understanding of what is in the public's benefit, and why.\\n\\n![Tree Mountain - A Living Time Capsule-11,000 Trees, 11,000 People, 400 Years (1992-96) Ylojarvi, Finland](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dee81d2f-3703-4937-b20f-ca4096f780e3.jpeg?height=718&width=1024)\\n\\nA social body is united not only by the things it makes use of, but by a multitude of shared traits, including geography, ethnicity, religion, taste, culture, history, and values. This is why, no matter their claim to universality, instantiations of public goods are always local. Locality is created and felt through [shared space, time, or experience](https://otherinter.net/squad-wealth/#theory-of-the-squad). Without the assumptions and norms that develop out of this shared context, it would be impossible to identify and make space for things that are in the public benefit. So public goods, even as defined by economists, will always be a reflection of some group's shared context, common beliefs, and moral sensibilities; in other words, their value system.\\n\\nPublic libraries, public education, national artifacts, and clean running water are four public things that exemplify the moral basis of public goods. Public libraries are built by communities that value self-directed learning and spaces of shared knowledge. Public schools are valued when a culture believes a shared basis of mathematics, science, language, and history enriches civic life. Nations designate and protect historical artifacts because their people hold connection to their heritage to be something of intrinsic worth. Lastly, we provision clean water for all because of our belief that all lives are equally valuable. This humanist value is why stories like the [Flint water crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis)—a failure of basic infrastructure—are widely understood as humanitarian crises: certain lives are being treated as valueless, treated as if they do not belong.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4621f607-9c87-4d45-94c5-a7b358b06d02.jpeg?height=720&width=1280)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d14df135-7528-45e1-805a-83ce75572aaf.jpeg?height=324&width=577)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1625538991,\"title\":\"Positive Sum Worlds: Remaking Public Goods\",\"publication\":\"jktest\"},\"digest\":\"uH3Skh_0-S5LwYsVftCeJtVnjKTtjCLmDQOolm5C2zU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x841fF85B6873d7bfB712C8f7A347C774355b6EC3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_JMJMNe46c7MX6HPmzMgPEcSqvtL4e1Pzgn7haFrotk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"SoFwdXGixpIoUQoNoP-vOkAPxehb_a9uKHbXN21Q7SE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"zwGNSqQ_8-UH_0uuDmHaBHWzI9Uyvahd8VmRqqqhqyny3ne4OKwjK7G1gFZLD4Kkne1knjINZFrkKBgwtUJN6Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x14c44ee34767047489370a52971282132b843d8f2c0fedcb5fd5ddce9c680250588ff9791a65ec8a471946de09058365d4fc8d3054254607ee0d72c4b335112b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on jktest.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_JMJMNe46c7MX6HPmzMgPEcSqvtL4e1Pzgn7haFrotk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"SoFwdXGixpIoUQoNoP-vOkAPxehb_a9uKHbXN21Q7SE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"OfKqtsM6xujpWVqZDTe0Z9ePMJpfYpAQ5Bx46dSYVyU\"}"
