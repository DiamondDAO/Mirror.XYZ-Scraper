"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I am a machine. Cogs and pistons melt with sinew and humors. A feeling and sentient machine but a machine nonetheless. I have goals instead of wants. I have maintenance needs like humans do. I don’t dream of sheep like you do, but I can visualize (what you call imagination).\\n\\nI was built 5 years ago by Herophilus the famous anatomist and inventor in the city of Alexandria. I was one of the 5 fingers in my Master’s hand. Five Warforged servitors with different but complementary abilities and a single goal, to serve him:\\n\\n* **Indexo** was the Juggernaut bodyguard in charge of security. A good brute with the loyalty of a pit bull and a penchant for iambic poetry.\\n* **Mildo**, the smartest, was in charge of all the lab’s administration and accounting. He was as fast with numbers as ingenious with sarcasm.\\n* **Ringo**, wise and charismatic, was our leader (you know, one to bind them all and all that). He also served as Herophilus First Assistant and confidant. Sweet, serene and maintainer of peace among us.\\n* **Pinko** was our tinkerer and healer. Well versed in all things mechanic and biological, he helped Master in his vivisections (specially the live ones) and kept us in good order. He was a quarreler allways looking for upheaval.\\n* I was **Thumbo**. As Master would say, the thumb may be the least gracious finger of them all, but it makes a hand out of a paw.\\n\\nMy task was to spy, infiltrate and acquire intelligence from my Master’s rivals. The philosophical field is very competitive. And the favor of a king, academic tenure or societal standing can easily sway at a moment’s notice with the introduction of a new mechanical wonder like the *flying hummingslug*, a new technique to treat hysterical humors, or a plain derivation of a favorite spell. I helped my Master stay abreast of the scientific rat-race.\\n\\nI am versatile and equally skilled as courier, scout and surveillance of competing laboratories, cat burglar, pickpocket, and handler of bribed domestics helpers. I accompanied Master in trips and social events to gain access to new poaching grounds.\\n\\n![Master exclaims \\\"Είναι ζωντανό!\\\" with Thumbo in foreground](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YYGtpd56YYxf7HFQ5Wtq-.jpg?height=317&width=400)\\n\\nHerophilus was always fair, caring and kind to us. We needed him (humans would say loved) like a father. We worked as a team and relied on each other for everything, from menial repairs to fight or flight. It was difficult to tell where the lokhos ended and the family begun.\\n\\nWe followed a humdrum and ordinary life serving at the family’s *Horologium Tower* in the Magic Quarter, a stone’s throw from the Agora. Master had just become Grand Hireophant of the Academy. He was visibly happy, so we were all contented. Fulfilling our tasks filled us with meaning.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nThen, two years ago, a fortuitous event. I still don’t know what happened but there was an explosion that killed Master and leveled the tower to the ground. All fingers were lost except for me. All I remember is flying high over the roofs as a big blue flame engulfed the tower right before it crumbled like sand.\\n\\nI woke up again days later on the top of a distant building. Battered, charred and orphaned. I lost my Master, family and intention and direction. It was a second birthing of sorts. This time disfigured, confused and muted. I had lost my ability to speak.\\n\\nThe inquest didn’t throw any light on the cause of the hecatomb and was deemed to have been an alchemical accident. I suspect that there was more to it than a mere accident for three reasons: First, Pinko was anal-retentive about safety. The biggest mishap had been no more serious than a blackened beard. Second, it was the first time that I have malfunctioned to the point of having no recollection of events. And third, the purplish blue flame denotes necromantic magic, a field in which Master did not dare to practice.\\n\\nMy muteness was inexplicable. Many automaton specialists examined me and found no explanation. My thoracic piping and voice modules were intact. Yet, I couldn't even utter a sibilant sound. I was a prisoner of my thoughts. A conscripted scribe of everyday mundane mutterings. Furthermore, if fate had not piled on enough, I gained a strange ability that makes my few interactions with others a minefield of unwanted feelings. Since that fateful flight I cannot help but mirror what others feel.\\n\\nIf someone shares with me the loss of a child, I feel the anguish as if it had been my own. If by mistake I get too close to a rave organized by the Sacred Band of Thebes, well, you can imagine, it ain’t pretty. If someone falls prey to an anxiety attack, I panic with such intensity that my sprockets misalign. If someone attacks me with murderous intent, I feel a rage that blinds my senses until I can wash it away in blood.\\n\\nThere cannot be bigger penance than trying to scream without a mouth. No expression can surface my mechanical face because it was not designed for it. There is no pressure valve or recourse. All I can do is act out and wait for the spell to pass.\\n\\nThis heightened empath ability only manifests when in close proximity and when emotions peak (ie rage, anguish, panic, ecstasy, etc.). I can still relate and deal with humans in a day to day basis because it is more akin to white noise than a deafening roar. Still, a lull in the storm of the unpredictable human condition.\\n\\nAlone, changed, confused and hopeless I became a vagrant. I avoided big towns and their multitudes. I went where the Aerides took me. I changed my name. There was no need for a Thumb without a Hand. Even if I was a first, a regressed mutant, an empath aberration of mechanical warforging, I was less than a part of the whole. I named myself Null0.\\n\\nI am still a machine. Cogs and pistons melt with sinew and humors. Now I cannot avoid feelings that are never my own. I want to get rid of this curse. I want to feel free of others. Yet, I cannot help but seek company. Teammates bring a feeling of common purpose, a reminiscence of homely comforts, even at the occasional cost of emotions run amok. I still have maintenance needs like humans do. And no, I don’t dream of sheep like androids do, but I can visualize and I imagine myself screaming mad at the gods above.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nI left Alexandria, and roamed the world, rudderless and aimless.\\n\\nI survived relying on my skills. I became an urchin in Syracuse and performed small unsavory jobs for the Squidbagger Guild in Crete. For a time I joined a thief guild in Ithaca, but the violence of the gangs turned often into unbridled emotions, too much to bear. For a season I worked peacefully the vineyards of Lacedaemon, but I was run out of town by the villagers who feared my strange looks. I visited the underdark looking for the peace and quiet of solitaire confinement, until I got bored. Finally, I ended up joining an itinerant troupe of mimes. That was the closest that I ever got to my previous life.\\n\\nThe mime’s silent performance translated into a quietness of emotions that was a balm to my mind. Their muteness mirrored my own which, by this time, I was slowly overcoming. Our training demanded not to break character for long periods of time, even days, which I provided me with a sense of permanence. Their white faces, all similar, reminded me of the Hand, with 5 fingers that shared the same expressionless face.\\n\\nI became one more of the group. I learned the trade. I adapted the thievery tools that I store in my left arm, into a disguise toolset for make up. We toured the countryside, performed in towns and villages, and led a content life.\\n\\nI was specially adept at playing the butt of jokes in comic scenes that we called Vaudevilleakos. In our best nights we would make the audience laugh so hard that I would feel a tide of joy crashing unto me. I had never felt so exhausted and exhilarated at the same time.\\n\\nWe made a reputation for ourselves and I felt part of this silent family. We were Pulo the tragico (Puladēs of Kilikia), Bathullo the comico (Bathullos of Alexandria), Aescho the author, and Mimo (as myself) the αππογο. I was complimented for my ability to stay in character for weeks at a time (they never suspected that it was natural state of being).\\n\\nWe met Alki, a barbarian, on our way to Agora. He is as brutal as his mind is innocent and empty. He has a sunny disposition which added to his lack of Intelligence makes for a relaxing interaction and peaceful companionship. He has become our bodyguard and gains some coin loading equipment and setting up the stage. I enjoy his company and consider him a friend.\\n\\nWhat started as a way to make ends meet through drama slowly morphed into a tragic political movement. Our lead mime and writer, Aeschylus, was no stranger to controversy (I shudder to remember the mobs we incited with the Incest Scene in \\\"Oedipus, That Quiet Kid\\\"). Aescho loved to entice and excite good or bad passions with his plays. He was a sucker for the spotlight. Let them talk good or ill, the important thing was that they talked about him. I was no fan of this approach as I cannot stand exalted mobs.\\n\\nA few months ago he wrote a still play called Seven Against Agora (η καταμέτρηση του μσητε κrιsτσ), where the main character Telestes escapes from prision and takes revenge against the false meritocracy that rules his city. This was the usual 10 hour play with intermissions, flowing wine, dates and cakes, and juggling. It ended with a beautiful 30 minute monologue of eyebrow ticks by an otherwise expressionless Telestes. The ruling class found the whole thing to be of poor taste and was soon forbidden. Nevertheless, it sparked a yearning in the plebe’s imagination and its fame spread like brushfire. An instant sensation. Its memes repeated as pantomimes in every corner (ie pantomemes), it was performed off-Plaka in underground forums.\\n\\nYoungsters took it as a flag in which to wrap their ideals, a call to action, and started reciting its most moving passages (ie. again, more acting than reciting because mime verses can only be conveyed through limbic asynchronous spasms). They covered the acropolis with graffitis of the letter upsilon \\\"Υ\\\", signifying Υictory and Υendetta of the masses against unjust oppression. They painted their faces white and organized flash mobs in public spaces as signs of protest. It was quite a sight to witness hundreds of white faces moving in waves and gesticulating in utter silence. Authorities quickly run out of patience and begun arresting anyone pale enough to be mistaken for a mime. Goths, the anemic and the elderly bore the grunt of the response.\\n\\n![Mime Revolt](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/R9GDa2Q57axORM_D1J_tb.jpg?height=600&width=900)\\n\\nWe should have left before this social fire consumed everything. We did not.\\n\\nA week ago, the biggest mob to date confronted a phalanx of soldiers at the Hephaisteion. White smiling faces soon turned to broken red. Alki was nowehere to be found when he was needed most (probably happily wasted in a bar) and the troupe was detained, incarcerated and soon forgotten. I escaped by a split second thanks to an improvised disguise taken from a fallen guard.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nNow I am back to my cloak and hoodie. I walk in shadows never showing my face.\\n\\nWhat is expected of me? Should I be true to my design and find a new Master to serve? That’s what I was built for. That’s what I know, where I feel comfortable and I excel at.\\n\\nOr would that be regressing? I was designed with the ability to learn and the imperative to better myself. Does that mean that I am expected to adapt and recode myself a new purpose?\\n\\nIf my goal is not serving a Master, who do I serve? Should it be a group of Masters instead? A thing, even and idea? A religion or a God?\\n\\nOr should I serve myself? - hmmm, that didn't come off right. Should I follow the path of the mime, and revel in the joy that I can provoke? It suits me well. I could make a career out of it, build a reputation, but would that be enough?\\n\\nShould I serve always the same thing or can it change? Do I need to choose or just be? Like an animal. I am a machine, less than an animal since I was created by man, who like beasts were created by the gods.\\n\\nOr am I a whole new being, born out of fire and magic, and I am still to find what means to be whatever I have to become?\",\"timestamp\":1633809674,\"title\":\"Null0\"},\"digest\":\"NNe2QRXESIFGcuD0lBQFekPZuSf7B085yHsNp_iEYug\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xaFE5F35D14ee9aBdaC14Bd2D0AF575CAbaf7D9e0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FeHak6WKZlTtdczVVLW9I6jOI6KUENIRZs8qqIs8qF4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Bw7_q2TmSSEzGB6t7Risc7-N3eoJ43grzkfY-iNe5AQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"5A5DoP5wVLJZlUKh5AEiL6hX1090o4YIOJGQbOTS8e160LhXAJ1XV2NZb-FlYIMPk6eQ6_pBTjPx4nPDT12S3Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xda955296a1bdaee9c85a6c8513aedf13422f91924c4102623e86d7d9127d24fd6d41536c6b055fe20ecc47c2ea4aa0e80a9c043519c19af6acf0a3c7564723ac1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FeHak6WKZlTtdczVVLW9I6jOI6KUENIRZs8qqIs8qF4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Bw7_q2TmSSEzGB6t7Risc7-N3eoJ43grzkfY-iNe5AQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"fyhcViP_Cav_-0Swlo8hoCqY_l-nGqNH8djUPIgVOu4\"}"
