"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*Featuring a case study of [Instadapp's governance portal](https://app.boardroom.info/instadapp/overview) on Boardroom*\\n\\nBoardroom's mission is to make governance more efficient and effective for cryptonetworks and DAOs, which we believe represent a revolution in organizational design that will uproot traditional management and ownership structures.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6639c412-d570-4154-b0ba-519baf86d8a8.jpeg?height=500&width=1500)\\n\\nOver the past 12 months, the number of DAOs has increased dramatically, growing alongside and underpinning the DeFi and NFT booms that have made waves in mainstream culture. More importantly, than simply the quantity of DAOs, the sophistication, and importance of DAOs has accelerated as well. The [aggregate value of DAO treasuries](https://app.boardroom.info/screener) reached a peak of $16.5 billion in May 2021, growing from just a few hundred million dollars at the beginning of 2020. Moreover, many DAOs have begun to develop and experiment with novel operational structures as they pay contributors, align incentives of various stakeholders, and pioneer the future of work.\\n\\nThis growth has been powered by DAO members, who have both the privilege and responsibility to participate in the democratic governance of these open organizations. As of July 13, 2021, **39,491 voters** have [participated in DAO governance](https://app.boardroom.info/screener), casting a total of **136,557 ballots** on **5,330 proposals** across the ecosystem.\\n\\nHowever, the growth of DAOs over the past 12 months has not been uniform; there are **several emergent governance frameworks and smart contract designs**, from Moloch DAOs to Snapshot-based governance to custom governance implementations forked from projects like Compound and AAVE. In addition, a disparate ecosystem of tools has cropped up to serve DAOs' needs to communicate internally, safely disburse funds, and more.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Boardroom Governance portal, powered by Boardroom's API, is a governance framework-agnostic interface that provides DAOs and their members with the tools they need to make better decisions and accomplish their goals. No matter the governance framework DAOs elect to use, Boardroom's platform is designed to standardize common actions like voting and delegation and enable DAO members to easily participate in distributed governance.\\n\\nThat is why we are excited to announce that Boardroom now supports projects using Compound's Governor Alpha and Governor Bravo, among the most popular DAO governance frameworks in use today.\\n\\n[Instadapp](https://app.boardroom.info/instadapp/overview), [Gitcoin DAO](https://app.boardroom.info/gitcoin/overview), [Fei Protocol](https://app.boardroom.info/fei/overview), [Inverse Finance](https://app.boardroom.info/inverse/overview), [PoolTogether](https://app.boardroom.info/pooltogether/overview) and more are now live on Boardroom.\\n\\nIf you're a member of these DAOs and want to fill out missing information on the Overview or Calendar page(s), follow [these
