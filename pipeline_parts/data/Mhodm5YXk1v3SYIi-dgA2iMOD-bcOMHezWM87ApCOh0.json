"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"until it's dissolution on the 17th. of September, when the results of their labors were published all together.  I received a copy early in November, and read and contemplated it's provisions with great satisfaction.  As not a member of the Convention however, nor probably a single citizen of the Union, had approved it in all it's parts, so I too found articles which I thought objectionable.  The absence of express declarations ensuring freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of the person under the uninterrupted protection of the Habeas corpus, & trial by jury in civil as well as in criminal cases excited my jealousy; and the re-eligibility of the President for life, I quite disapproved.  I expressed freely in letters to my friends, and most particularly to Mr. Madison & General Washington, my approbations and objections.  How the good should be secured, and the ill brought to rights was the difficulty.  To refer it back to a new Convention might endanger the loss of the whole.  My first idea was that the 9. states first acting should accept it unconditionally, and thus secure what in it was good, and that the 4. last should accept on the previous condition that certain amendments should be agreed to, but a better course was devised of accepting the whole and trusting that the good sense & honest intentions of our citizens would make the alterations which should be deemed necessary. Accordingly all accepted, 6. without objection, and 7. with recommendations of specified amendments.  Those respecting the press, religion, & juries, with several others, of great value, were accordingly made; but the Habeas corpus was left to the discretion of Congress, and the amendment against the reeligibility of the President was not proposed by that body.  My fears of that feature were founded on the importance of the office, on the fierce contentions it might excite among ourselves, if continuable for life, and the dangers of interference either with money or arms, by foreign nations, to whom the choice of an American President might become interesting.  Examples of this abounded in history; in the case of the Roman emperors for instance, of the Popes while of any significance, of the German emperors, the Kings of Poland, & the Deys of Barbary.  I had observed too in the feudal History, and in the recent instance particularly of the Stadtholder of Holland, how easily offices or tenures for life slide into inheritances.  My wish therefore was that the President should be elected for 7. years & be ineligible afterwards.  This term I thought sufficient to enable him, with the concurrence of the legislature, to carry thro' & establish any system of improvement he should propose for the general good. But the practice adopted I think is better allowing his continuance for 8. years with a liability to be dropped at half way of the term, making that a period of probation.  That his continuance should be restrained to 7. years was the opinion of the Convention at an early stage of it's session, when it voted that term by a majority of 8. against 2. and by a simple majority that he should be ineligible a second time.  This opinion &c. was confirmed by the house so late as July 26. referred to the committee of detail, reported favorably by them, and changed to the present form by final vote on the last day but one only of their session. Of this change three states expressed their disapprobation, N. York by recommending an amendment that the President should not be eligible a third time, and Virginia and N. Carolina that he should not be capable of serving more than 8. in any term of 16. years.  And altho' this amendment has not been made in form, yet practice seems to have established it.  The example of 4 Presidents voluntarily retiring at the end of their 8th year, & the progress of public opinion that the principle is salutary, have given it in practice the force of precedent & usage; insomuch that should a President consent to be a candidate for a 3d.  election, I trust he would be rejected on this demonstration of ambitious views.\\n\\n```\\n    But there was another amendment of which none of us thought at the time and in the omission of which lurks the germ that is to destroy this happy combination of National powers in the General government for matters of National concern, and independent powers in the states for what concerns the states severally.  In England it was a great point gained at the Revolution, that the commissions of the judges, which had hitherto been during pleasure, should thenceforth be made during good behavior.  A Judiciary dependent on the will of the King had proved itself the most oppressive of all tools in the hands of that Magistrate.  Nothing then could be more salutary than a change there to the tenure of good behavior; and the question of good behavior left to the vote of a simple majority in the two houses of parliament.  Before the revolution we were all good English Whigs, cordial in their free principles, and in their jealousies of their executive Magistrate.  These jealousies are very apparent in all our state constitutions; and, in the general government in this instance, we have gone even beyond the English caution, by requiring a vote of two thirds in one of the Houses for removing a judge; a vote so impossible where (* 10) any defence is made, before men of ordinary prejudices & passions, that our judges are effectually independent of the nation.  But this ought not to be.  I would not indeed make them dependant on the Executive authority, as they formerly were in England; but I deem it indispensable to the continuance of this government that they should be submitted to some practical & impartial controul: and that this, to be imparted, must be compounded of a mixture of state and federal authorities.  It is not enough that honest men are appointed judges.  All know the influence of interest on the mind of man, and how unconsciously his judgment is warped by that influence.  To this bias add that of the esprit de corps, of their peculiar maxim and creed that \\\"it is the office of a good judge to enlarge his jurisdiction,\\\" and the absence of responsibility, and how can we expect impartial decision between the General government, of which they are themselves so eminent a part, and an individual state from which they have nothing to hope or fear.  We have seen too that, contrary to all correct example, they are in the habit of going out of the question before them, to throw an anchor ahead and grapple further hold for future advances of power.  They are then in fact the corps of sappers & miners, steadily working to undermine the independant rights of the States, & to consolidate all power in the hands of that government in which they have so important a freehold estate.  But it is not by the consolidation, or concentration of powers, but by their distribution, that good government is effected. Were not this great country already divided into states, that division must be made, that each might do for itself what concerns itself directly, and what it can so much better do than a distant authority.  Every state again is divided into counties, each to take care of what lies within it's local bounds; each county again into townships or wards, to manage minuter details; and every ward into farms, to be governed each by it's individual proprietor.  Were we directed from Washington when to sow, & when to reap, we should soon want bread.  It is by this partition of cares, descending in gradation from general to particular, that the mass of human affairs may be best managed for the good and prosperity of all.  I repeat that I do not charge the judges with wilful and ill-intentioned error; but honest error must be arrested where it's toleration leads to public ruin.  As, for the safety of society, we commit honest maniacs to Bedlam, so judges should be withdrawn from their bench, whose erroneous biases are leading us to dissolution.  It may indeed injure them in fame or in fortune; but it saves the republic, which is the first and supreme law.  In the impeachment of judge Pickering of New Hampshire, a habitual & maniac drunkard, no defence was made. Had there been, the party vote of more than one third of the Senate would have acquitted him.\\n\\n    (* 10) In the impeachment of judge Pickering of New Hampsire, a habitual & maniac drunkard, no defence was made.  Had there been, the party vote of more than one third of the Senate would have acquitted him.\\n\\n    Among the debilities of the government of the Confederation, no one was more distinguished or more distressing than the utter impossibility of obtaining, from the states, the monies necessary for the payment of debts, or even for the ordinary expenses of the government.  Some contributed a little, some less, & some nothing, and the last furnished at length an excuse for the first to do nothing also.  Mr. Adams, while residing at the Hague, had a general authority to borrow what sums might be requisite for ordinary & necessary expenses.  Interest on the public debt, and the maintenance of the diplomatic establishment in Europe, had been habitually provided in this way.  He was now elected Vice President of the U. S. was soon to return to America, and had referred our bankers to me for future councel on our affairs in their hands.  But I had no powers, no instructions, no means, and no familiarity with the subject.  It had always been exclusively under his management, except as to occasional and partial deposits in the hands of Mr. Grand, banker in Paris, for special and local purposes.  These last had been exhausted for some time, and I had fervently pressed the Treasury board to replenish this particular deposit; as Mr. Grand now refused to make further advances.  They answered candidly that no funds could be obtained until the new government should get into action, and have time to make it's arrangements.  Mr. Adams had received his appointment to the court of London while engaged at Paris, with Dr. Franklin and myself, in the negotiations under our joint commissions. He had repaired thence to London, without returning to the Hague to take leave of that government.  He thought it necessary however to do so now, before he should leave Europe, and accordingly went there.  I learned his departure from London by a letter from Mrs.  Adams received on the very day on which he would arrive at the Hague.  A consultation with him, & some provision for the future was indispensable, while we could yet avail ourselves of his powers.  For when they would be gone, we should be without resource.  I was daily dunned by a company who had formerly made a small loan to the U S. the principal of which was now become due; and our bankers in Amsterdam had notified me that the interest on our general debt would be expected in June; that if we failed to pay it, it would be deemed an act of bankruptcy and would effectually destroy the credit of the U S. and all future prospect of obtaining money there; that the loan they had been authorized to open, of which a third only was filled, and now ceased to get forward, and rendered desperate that hope of resource.  I saw that there was not a moment to lose, and set out for the Hague on the 2d. morning after receiving the information of Mr. Adams's journey.  I went the direct road by Louvres, Senlis, Roye, Pont St. Maxence, Bois le duc, Gournay, Peronne, Cambray, Bouchain, Valenciennes, Mons, Bruxelles, Malines, Antwerp, Mordick, and Rotterdam, to the Hague, where I happily found Mr. Adams.  He concurred with me at once in opinion that something must be done, and that we ought to risk ourselves on doing it without instructions, to save the credit of the U S.  We foresaw that before the new government could be adopted, assembled, establish it's financial system, get the money into the treasury, and place it in Europe, considerable time would elapse; that therefore we had better provide at once for the years 88. 89. & 90. in order to place our government at it's ease, and our credit in security, during that trying interval.  We set out therefore by the way of Leyden for Amsterdam, where we arrived on the 10th.  I had prepared an estimate showing that\\n\\n                        Florins.         there would be necessary for the year 88 -- 531,937 -- 10                                             89 -- 538,540                                             90 -- 473,540                                                 --------------------                                    Total,       1,544,017 -- 10                                                Flor.\\n\\nto meet this the bankers had in hand 79,268 -- 2 -- 8     & the unsold bonds would yield      542,800         622,068 -- 2 -- 8                                         --------        -----------------     we proposed then to borrow a million yielding. . .  900,000                                                         -----------------     which would leave a small deficiency of. . . . . .    1,949 -- 7 -- 4\\n\\n    Mr. Adams accordingly executed 1000. bonds, for 1000. florins each, and deposited them in the hands of our bankers, with instructions however not to issue them until Congress should ratify the measure.  This done, he returned to London, and I set out for Paris; and as nothing urgent forbade it, I determined to return along the banks of the Rhine to Strasburg, and thence strike off to Paris. I accordingly left Amsterdam on the 30th of March, and proceeded by Utrecht, Nimeguen, Cleves, Duysberg, Dusseldorf, Cologne, Bonne, Coblentz, Nassau, Hocheim, Frankfort, & made an excursion to Hanau, thence to Mayence and another excursion to Rude-sheim, & Johansberg; then by Oppenheim, Worms, and Manheim, and an excursion to Heidelberg, then by Spire, Carlsruh, Rastadt & Kelh, to Strasburg, where I arrived Apr. 16th, and proceeded again on the 18th, by Phalsbourg, Fenestrange, Dieuze, Moyenvie, Nancy, Toul, Ligny, Barleduc, St. Diziers, Vitry, Chalons sur Marne, Epernay, Chateau Thierri, Meaux, to Paris where I arrived on the 23d. of April; and I had the satisfaction to reflect that by this journey our credit was secured, the new government was placed at ease for two years to come, and that as well as myself were relieved from the torment of incessant duns, whose just complaints could not be silenced by any means within our power.\\n\\n    A Consular Convention had been agreed on in 84. between Dr. Franklin and the French government containing several articles so entirely inconsistent with the laws of the several states, and the general spirit of our citizens, that Congress withheld their ratification, and sent it back to me with instructions to get those articles expunged or modified so as to render them compatible with our laws.  The minister retired unwillingly from these concessions, which indeed authorized the exercise of powers very offensive in a free state.  After much discussion it was reformed in a considerable degree, and the Convention was signed by the Count Montmorin and myself, on the 14th. of Nov. 88 not indeed such as I would have wished; but such as could be obtained with good humor & friendship.\\n\\n    On my return from Holland, I had found Paris still in high fermentation as I had left it.  Had the Archbishop, on the close of the assembly of Notables, immediately carried into operation the measures contemplated, it was believed they would all have been registered by the parliament, but he was slow, presented his edicts, one after another, & at considerable intervals of time, which gave time for the feelings excited by the proceedings of the Notables to cool off, new claims to be advanced, and a pressure to arise for a fixed constitution, not subject to changes at the will of the King. Nor should we wonder at this pressure when we consider the monstrous abuses of power under which this people were ground to powder, when we pass in review the weight of their taxes, and inequality of their distribution; the oppressions of the tythes, of the tailles, the corvees, the gabelles, the farms & barriers; the shackles on Commerce by monopolies; on Industry by gilds & corporations; on the freedom of conscience, of thought, and of speech; on the Press by the Censure; and of person by lettres de Cachet; the cruelty of the criminal code generally, the atrocities of the Rack, the venality of judges, and their partialities to the rich; the Monopoly of Military honors by the Noblesse; the enormous expenses of the Queen, the princes & the Court; the prodigalities of pensions; & the riches, luxury, indolence & immorality of the clergy.  Surely under such a mass of misrule and oppression, a people might justly press for a thoro' reformation, and might even dismount their rough-shod riders, & leave them to walk on their own legs.  The edicts relative to the corvees & free circulation of grain, were first presented to the parliament and registered.  But those for the impot territorial, & stamp tax, offered some time after, were refused by the parliament, which proposed a call of the States General as alone competent to their authorization.  Their refusal produced a Bed of justice, and their exile to Troyes.  The advocates however refusing to attend them, a suspension in the administration of justice took place.  The Parliament held out for awhile, but the ennui of their exile and absence from Paris begun at length to be felt, and some dispositions for compromise to appear.  On their consent therefore to prolong some of the former taxes, they were recalled from exile, the King met them in session Nov. 19. 87. promised to call the States General in the year 92. and a majority expressed their assent to register an edict for successive and annual loans from 1788. to 92.  But a protest being entered by the Duke of Orleans and this encouraging others in a disposition to retract, the King ordered peremptorily the registry of the edict, and left the assembly abruptly.  The parliament immediately protested that the votes for the enregistry had not been legally taken, and that they gave no sanction to the loans proposed. This was enough to discredit and defeat them.  Hereupon issued another edict for the establishment of a cour pleniere, and the suspension of all the parliaments in the kingdom.  This being opposed as might be expected by reclamations from all the parliaments & provinces, the King gave way and by an edict of July 5. 88 renounced his cour pleniere, & promised the States General for the 1st. of May of the ensuing year: and the Archbishop finding the times beyond his faculties, accepted the promise of a Cardinal's hat, was removed [Sep. 88] from the ministry, and Mr. Necker was called to the department of finance. The innocent rejoicings of the people of Paris on this change provoked the interference of an officer of the city guards, whose order for their dispersion not being obeyed, he charged them with fixed bayonets, killed two or three, and wounded many. This dispersed them for the moment; but they collected the next day in great numbers, burnt 10.  or 12. guard houses, killed two or three of the guards, & lost 6. or 8. more of their own number. The city was hereupon put under martial law, and after awhile the tumult subsided. The effect of this change of ministers, and the promise of the States General at an early day, tranquillized the nation.  But two great questions now occurred.  1.  What proportion shall the number of deputies of the tiers etat bear to those of the Nobles and Clergy? And 2. shall they sit in the same, or in distinct apartments?  Mr. Necker, desirous of avoiding himself these knotty questions, proposed a second call of the same Notables, and that their advice should be asked on the subject.  They met Nov. 9. 88. and, by five bureaux against one, they recommended the forms of the States General of 1614. wherein the houses were separate, and voted by orders, not by persons.  But the whole nation declaring at once against this, and that the tiers etat should be, in numbers, equal to both the other orders, and the Parliament deciding for the same proportion, it was determined so to be, by a declaration of Dec. 27. 88.  A Report of Mr. Necker to the King, of about the same date, contained other very important concessions.  1. That the King could neither lay a new tax, nor prolong an old one.  2. It expressed a readiness to agree on the periodical meeting of the States.  3. To consult on the necessary restriction on lettres de Cachet.  And 4. how far the Press might be made free.  5. It admits that the States are to appropriate the public money; and 6. that Ministers shall be responsible for public expenditures.  And these concessions came from the very heart of the King.  He had not a wish but for the good of the nation, and for that object no personal sacrifice would ever have cost him a moment's regret.  But his mind was weakness itself, his constitution timid, his judgment null, and without sufficient firmness even to stand by the faith of his word.  His Queen too, haughty and bearing no contradiction, had an absolute ascendency over him; and around her were rallied the King's brother d'Artois, the court generally, and the aristocratic part of his ministers, particularly Breteuil, Broglio, Vauguyon, Foulon, Luzerne, men whose principles of government were those of the age of Louis XIV.  Against this host the good counsels of Necker, Montmorin, St. Priest, altho' in unison with the wishes of the King himself, were of little avail.  The resolutions of the morning formed under their advice, would be reversed in the evening by the influence of the Queen & court.  But the hand of heaven weighed heavily indeed on the machinations of this junto; producing collateral incidents, not arising out of the case, yet powerfully co-exciting the nation to force a regeneration of it's government, and overwhelming with accumulated difficulties this liberticide resistance.  For, while laboring under the want of money for even ordinary purposes, in a government which required a million of livres a day, and driven to the last ditch by the universal call for liberty, there came on a winter of such severe cold, as was without example in the memory of man, or in the written records of history.  The Mercury was at times 50;dg below the freezing point of Fahrenheit and 22;dg below that of Reaumur.  All out-door labor was suspended, and the poor, without the wages of labor, were of course without either bread or fuel.  The government found it's necessities aggravated by that of procuring immense quantities of fire-wood, and of keeping great fires at all the cross-streets, around which the people gathered in crowds to avoid perishing with cold.  Bread too was to be bought, and distributed daily gratis, until a relax-ation of the season should enable the people to work: and the slender stock of bread-stuff had for some time threatened famine, and had raised that article to an enormous price.  So great indeed was the scarcity of bread that from the highest to the lowest citizen, the bakers were permitted to deal but a scanty allowance per head, even to those who paid for it; and in cards of invitation to dine in the richest houses, the guest was notified to bring his own bread.  To eke out the existence of the people, every person who had the means, was called on for a weekly subscription, which the Cures collected and employed in providing messes for the nourishment of the poor, and vied with each other in devising such economical compositions of food as would subsist the greatest number with the smallest means.  This want of bread had been foreseen for some time past and M. de Montmorin had desired me to notify it in America, and that, in addition to the market price, a premium should be given on what should be brought from the U S.  Notice was accordingly given and produced considerable supplies.  Subsequent information made the importations from America, during the months of March, April & May, into the Atlantic ports of France, amount to about 21,000 barrels of flour, besides what went to other ports, and in other months, while our supplies to their West-Indian islands relieved them also from that drain.  This distress for bread continued till July.\\n\\n    Hitherto no acts of popular violence had been produced by the struggle for political reformation.  Little riots, on ordinary incidents, had taken place, as at other times, in different parts of the kingdom, in which some lives, perhaps a dozen or twenty, had been lost, but in the month of April a more serious one occurred in Paris, unconnected indeed with the revolutionary principle, but making part of the history of the day.  The Fauxbourg St. Antoine is a quarter of the city inhabited entirely by the class of day-laborers and journeymen in every line.  A rumor was spread among them that a great paper manufacturer, of the name of Reveillon, had proposed, on some occasion, that their wages should be lowered to 15 sous a day. Inflamed at once into rage, & without inquiring into it's truth, they flew to his house in vast numbers, destroyed everything in it, and in his magazines & work shops, without secreting however a pin's worth to themselves, and were continuing this work of devastation when the regular troops were called in.  Admonitions being disregarded, they were of necessity fired on, and a regular action ensued, in which about 100. of them were killed, before the rest would disperse. There had rarely passed a year without such a riot in some part or other of the Kingdom; and this is distinguished only as cotemporary with the revolution, altho' not produced by it.\\n\\n    The States General were opened on the 5th. of May 89. by speeches from the King, the Garde des Sceaux Lamoignon, and Mr. Necker.  The last was thought to trip too lightly over the constitutional reformations which were expected.  His notices of them in this speech were not as full as in his previous `Rapport au Roi.' This was observed to his disadvantage.  But much allowance should have been made for the situation in which he was placed between his own counsels, and those of the ministers and party of the court. Overruled in his own opinions, compelled to deliver, and to gloss over those of his opponents, and even to keep their secrets, he could not come forward in his own attitude.\\n\\n    The composition of the assembly, altho' equivalent on the whole to what had been expected, was something different in it's elements. It has been supposed that a superior education would carry into the scale of the Commons a respectable portion of the Noblesse.  It did so as to those of Paris, of it's vicinity and of the other considerable cities, whose greater intercourse with enlightened society had liberalized their minds, and prepared them to advance up to the measure of the times.  But the Noblesse of the country, which constituted two thirds of that body, were far in their rear. Residing constantly on their patrimonial feuds, and familiarized by daily habit with Seigneurial powers and practices, they had not yet learned to suspect their inconsistence with reason and right.  They were willing to submit to equality of taxation, but not to descend from their rank and prerogatives to be incorporated in session with the tiers etat.  Among the clergy, on the other hand, it had been apprehended that the higher orders of the hierarchy, by their wealth and connections, would have carried the elections generally.  But it proved that in most cases the lower clergy had obtained the popular majorities.  These consisted of the Cures, sons of the peasantry who had been employed to do all the drudgery of parochial services for 10. 20. or 30 Louis a year; while their superiors were consuming their princely revenues in palaces of luxury & indolence.\\n\\n    The objects for which this body was convened being of the first order of importance, I felt it very interesting to understand the views of the parties of which it was composed, and especially the ideas prevalent as to the organization contemplated for their government.  I went therefore daily from Paris to Versailles, and attended their debates, generally till the hour of adjournment. Those of the Noblesse were impassioned and tempestuous.  They had some able men on both sides, and actuated by equal zeal.  The debates of the Commons were temperate, rational and inflexibly firm.  As preliminary to all other business, the awful questions came on, Shall the States sit in one, or in distinct apartments?  And shall they vote by heads or houses?  The opposition was soon found to consist of the Episcopal order among the clergy, and two thirds of the Noblesse; while the tiers etat were, to a man, united and determined.  After various propositions of compromise had failed, the Commons undertook to cut the Gordian knot.  The Abbe Sieyes, the most logical head of the nation, (author of the pamphlet Qu'est ce que le tiers etat? which had electrified that country, as Paine's Common sense did us) after an impressive speech on the 10th of June, moved that a last invitation should be sent to the Nobles and Clergy, to attend in the Hall of the States, collectively or individually for the verification of powers, to which the commons would proceed immediately, either in their presence or absence.  This verification being finished, a motion was made, on the 15th. that they should constitute themselves a National assembly; which was decided on the 17th. by a majority of four fifths.  During the debates on this question, about twenty of the Cures had joined them, and a proposition was made in the chamber of the clergy that their whole body should join them.  This was rejected at first by a small majority only; but, being afterwards somewhat modified, it was decided affirmatively, by a majority of eleven.  While this was under debate and unknown to the court, to wit, on the 19th. a council was held in the afternoon at Marly, wherein it was proposed that the King should interpose by a declaration of his sentiments, in a _seance royale._ A form of declaration was proposed by Necker, which, while it censured in general the proceedings both of the Nobles and Commons, announced the King's views, such as substantially to coincide with the Commons.  It was agreed to in council, the _seance_ was fixed for the 22d. the meetings of the States were till then to be suspended, and everything, in the meantime, kept secret.  The members the next morning (20th.) repairing to their house as usual, found the doors shut and guarded, a proclamation posted up for a seance royale on the 22d. and a suspension of their meetings in the meantime.  Concluding that their dissolution was now to take place, they repaired to a building called the \\\"Jeu de paume\\\" (or Tennis court) and there bound themselves by oath to each other, never to separate of their own accord, till they had settled a constitution for the nation, on a solid basis, and if separated by force, that they would reassemble in some other place.  The next day they met in the church of St. Louis, and were joined by a majority of the clergy.  The heads of the Aristocracy saw that all was lost without some bold exertion.  The King was still at Marly.  Nobody was permitted to approach him but their friends.  He was assailed by falsehoods in all shapes.  He was made to believe that the Commons were about to absolve the army from their oath of fidelity to him, and to raise their pay.  The court party were now all rage and desperate.  They procured a committee to be held consisting of the King and his ministers, to which Monsieur & the Count d'Artois should be admitted.  At this committee the latter attacked Mr. Necker personally, arraigned his declaration, and proposed one which some of his prompters had put into his hands.  Mr. Necker was brow-beaten and intimidated, and the King shaken.  He determined that the two plans should be deliberated on the next day and the seance royale put off a day longer.  This encouraged a fiercer attack on Mr. Necker the next day.  His draught of a declaration was entirely broken up, & that of the Count d'Artois inserted into it.  Himself and Montmorin offered their resignation, which was refused, the Count d'Artois saying to Mr. Necker \\\"No sir, you must be kept as the hostage; we hold you responsible for all the ill which shall happen.\\\" This change of plan was immediately whispered without doors.  The Noblesse were in triumph; the people in consternation.  I was quite alarmed at this state of things.  The soldiery had not yet indicated which side they should take, and that which they should support would be sure to prevail.  I considered a successful reformation of government in France, as ensuring a general reformation thro Europe, and the resurrection, to a new life, of their people, now ground to dust by the abuses of the governing powers.  I was much acquainted with the leading patriots of the assembly.  Being from a country which had successfully passed thro' a similar reformation, they were disposed to my acquaintance, and had some confidence in me.  I urged most strenuously an immediate compromise; to secure what the government was now ready to yield, and trust to future occasions for what might still be wanting.  It was well understood that the King would grant at this time 1.  Freedom of the person by Habeas corpus.  2. Freedom of conscience.  3. Freedom of the press.  4. Trial by jury.  5. A representative legislature. 6. Annual meetings.  7. The origination of laws.  8. The exclusive right of taxation and appropriation.  And 9. The responsibility of ministers; and with the exercise of these powers they would obtain in future whatever might be further necessary to improve and preserve their constitution.  They thought otherwise however, and events have proved their lamentable error.  For after 30. years of war, foreign and domestic, the loss of millions of lives, the prostration of private happiness, and foreign subjugation of their own country for a time, they have obtained no more, nor even that securely.  They were unconscious of (for who could foresee?) the melancholy sequel of their well-meant perseverance; that their physical force would be usurped by a first tyrant to trample on the independance, and even the existence, of other nations: that this would afford fatal example for the atrocious conspiracy of Kings against their people; would generate their unholy and homicide alliance to make common cause among themselves, and to crush, by the power of the whole, the efforts of any part, to moderate their abuses and oppressions.\\n\\n    When the King passed, the next day, thro' the lane formed from the Chateau to the Hotel des etats, there was a dead silence.  He was about an hour in the House delivering his speech & declaration.  On his coming out a feeble cry of \\\"Vive le Roy\\\" was raised by some children, but the people remained silent & sullen.  In the close of his speech he had ordered that the members should follow him, & resume their deliberations the next day.  The Noblesse followed him, and so did the clergy, except about thirty, who, with the tiers, remained in the room, and entered into deliberation.  They protested against what the King had done, adhered to all their former proceedings, and resolved the inviolability of their own persons.  An officer came to order them out of the room in the King's name.  \\\"Tell those who sent you, said Mirabeau, that we shall not move hence but at our own will, or the point of the bayonet.\\\" In the afternoon the people, uneasy, began to assemble in great numbers in the courts, and vicinities of the palace.  This produced alarm.  The Queen sent for Mr. Necker.  He was conducted amidst the shouts and acclamations of the multitude who filled all the apartments of the palace.  He was a few minutes only with the queen, and what passed between them did not transpire.  The King went out to ride.  He passed thro' the crowd to his carriage and into it, without being in the least noticed.  As Mr. Neckar followed him universal acclamations were raised of \\\"vive Monsr. Neckar, vive le sauveur de la France opprimee.\\\" He was conducted back to his house with the same demonstrations of affection and anxiety.  About 200. deputies of the Tiers, catching the enthusiasm of the moment, went to his house, and extorted from him a promise that he would not resign.  On the 25th. 48. of the Nobles joined the tiers, & among them the D. of Orleans.  There were then with them 164 members of the Clergy, altho' the minority of that body still sat apart & called themselves the chamber of the clergy.  On the 26th. the Archbp. of Paris joined the tiers, as did some others of the clergy and of the Noblesse.\\n```\",\"timestamp\":1639988324,\"title\":\"This Convention met at Philadelphia on the 25th. of May '87.
