"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"***The first batch of songs out of Elektra drop on Monday August 16 at 4:30 PM ET in the [Songcamp Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wHsJD2sTpc) → Add Event Reminder [here](https://www.addevent.com/event/XZ8020000)***\\n\\nYou continue on to the fallen city of Edin Prodo, after hearing from Cat & Alpha in [the second Log](https://zora.co/songcamp/4280). It sounds like Cat & Alpha have collected a second Capsule. \\n\\nYou also learnt of The Prophecy Of The Elektra from Godina, who said they had “a vision that brave warriors from a space unknown will appear out of a portal”. It sounds like that's referring to us... \\n\\nBut how are we supposed to save Elektra? And how do we avoid ending up like the fallen warrior we just discovered?\\n\\nYou and the other travellers finally enter the destroyed city gates of Edin Prodo. You can sense that the energy here is different. Night has fallen, and sounds of distant rumbling creep into your ears — as if little earthquakes are shaking Elektra some miles away. \\n\\nYou see something glimmering softly in the distance.. another log device! The third one you've discovered. \\n\\nJust like [Log 1](https://zora.co/songcamp/4176) and [Log 2](https://zora.co/songcamp/4280), this one also has a recent message on it - recorded just 34 minutes ago. \\n\\nYou press play...\\n\\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/4435)\\n\\nYou can collect this 1/1 NFT by bidding on Zora: https://zora.co/songcamp/4435\\n\\nCollecting this 1/1 NFT also includes:\\n* A gift of 1000 $ELEKTRA\\n* Access to the ELEKTRA interactive web3 game on Discord\\n* One (1) invitation to Songcamp's Patron House -- a dedicated space for patrons of 1/1 Songcamp NFTs to receive deep + intimate access into the growing Songcamp community and activities.\\n\\n***Jump into the [Elektra Discord interactive game](https://elektra.camp/#/) to unlock the full audio story of Cat & Alpha as they journey with you through Elektra.***\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f9a97259-0279-4f2f-b87d-c841ff346c10.png?height=1080&width=1080)\\n\\n## *Descent To The Core* is the result of collective creation within Songcamp Elektra\\n\\nElektra is the second experiment powered by *Songcamp* — a web3 community interested in exploring at the edges of where music meets the new internet.\\n\\nThe audio-visual artwork for Log 3 was created by two teams within the Elektra camp — the Visual Sqaud and The Swarm. The latter is a team of ~10 musicians creating the script, voiceovers, and sound design for Elektra's story-based pieces.
