"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Hello, and welcome to[ The Future of Work](https://futurework.substack.com/welcome), **a newsletter for Makers (aspiring entrepreneurs, creators, bootstrappers, Indie Hackers...) looking for inspiration to help create more fulfilling, humane and equitable futures**.\\n\\nI’m *[Leandro](https://twitter.com/leandropinter)* and in each edition I aim to bring you content to help you on your journey.\\n\\nIn this first edition I decided to start with a topic that I’ve been intrigued and curious about lately - **The Makers Movement** and the communities of **creators, makers, bootstrappers, Indie Hackers** - hopefully like me this interests you also.  I have been learning about it for the last year or so and thought I would share some of my insights below.\\n\\nLet’s start with some definitions.\\n\\n### **Indie Hackers:**\\n\\nAs described on the [Indie Hackers website](https://www.indiehackers.com/)\\n\\n> You're an **indie hacke**r if you've set out to make money independently. That means you're generating revenue directly from your customers, not indirectly through an employer. Other than that, there are no requirements\\n\\n### **Bootstrappers**\\n\\nThe dictionary describes it as *“a person who relies on their own resources to solve a problem or pursue an undertaking” *and* “an entrepreneur who starts a business with minimal resources or capital”.*\\n\\nI don’t mind that definition but I prefer this one by [Seth Godin](https://twitter.com/ThisIsSethsBlog).\\n\\n> *The bootstrapper builds something from scratch, something you own and nurture and build around your customers, not your investors.*\\n\\n### **Makers & Creators**\\n\\nFirst, the dictionary definition:\\n\\nMaker: *“a person or thing that makes or produces something”*\\n\\nCreator: *“a person or thing that brings something into existence”*\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F822e3123-6da5-4622-ad7d-c3b4c43b897b\\\\_2212x1444.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F822e3123-6da5-4622-ad7d-c3b4c43b897b\\\\_2212x1444.png)\\n\\nApart from being three different concepts there is something that brings them all together: **the Maker Movement**.\\n\\nThere is not a single definition of the “Maker Movement” so let’s go with the [Wikipedia version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture): \\n\\n> *The maker movement is a social movement with an artisan spirit. Promoting equity in the maker movement is fundamental to its success in democratizing access to STEAM and other tech-rich and art domains.*\\n>\\n> *Maker culture emphasizes **learning-through-doing **(active learning) in a social environment. Maker culture **emphasizes informal, networked, peer-led, and shared learning motivated by fun and self-fulfilment.***\\n\\nAs one would expect, there are no clear answers on when this movement started and what it was/is about. I won’t concentrate on that and instead will focus on what it looks like nowadays.\\n\\nWhat fascinates me the most about the Makers communities is the **Maker’s motivations** for embarking on this unanimously rewarding and at the same time bumpy journey.\\n\\nAccording to [@csallen](https://twitter.com/csallen), based on what he’s been hearing from **Makers** during interviews in his [Indie Hackers Podcast](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast), [](https://twitter.com/csallen)their main motivation for starting their side project, startup etc is that:\\n\\n> ***People want freedom - They want to take/have control of their lives and the thing they are building.***\\n\\n## Get creating\\n\\nIf you, like me, believe in creating a better world, where work is more fulfilling, humane and equitable. A world where you can have more fun and at the same time make an impact on your community, city, country, I would encourage you to take the first step and join the movement.\\n\\nI am new to the Makers community and I took my first step a few weeks ago with the creation of [this newsletter](https://futurework.substack.com/welcome). \\n\\n**What is your creation?**\\n\\nThank you for reading this edition of[ The Future of Work](https://futurework.substack.com/).
