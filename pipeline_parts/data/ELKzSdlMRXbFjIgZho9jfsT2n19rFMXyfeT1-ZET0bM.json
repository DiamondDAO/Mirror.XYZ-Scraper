"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**TL;DR**: Screenbreak is looking to integrate with mirror, allowing everyone to curate and sell mirror-only based custom physical magazines, delivered globally. Each magazine will be a collectible NFT, distributing payouts to curators, creators, artists, and stakeholders.\\n\\n[Screenbreak](https://www.myscreenbreak.com/) was built with the intention to turn all web knowledge available into a format that’s designed for paper.\\n\\nWe believe that while content distribution should be 100% online, consumption should entail optionality. And while there are tons of ways to consume online in a personalized way (web and mobile), print versions exist only in fixed formats like newspapers, magazines, and books.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z-PTNsJ-8MSOEcYcb7i9q.png?height=1106&width=1980)\\n\\n\\\\\\\\n While we all know the fate of newspapers and magazines, books are still dominating.\\n\\nThis leads to the conclusion that it's not a medium (aka paper) issue, rather than a cost/customisation/personalization one.\\n\\nWhat if you could have your personal magazine delivered, out of content that is distributed and curated online?\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xWjwtZ2o6aKYiHqjaklvq.png?height=1096&width=1974)\\n\\nThis is where Screenbreak kicks in. We have built the v1 of the tools to turn a collection of web-native articles into a custom magazine in a few clicks. No design, typesetting, or design skills are needed and shipped globally.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/Screenbreak2/status/1390636621264003073](https://twitter.com/Screenbreak2/status/1390636621264003073)\\n\\nOur ideal scenario would look like this:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8oU6aM7ZwOyQSr1Bdzx2T.png?height=1100&width=1974)\\n\\nWhich leads us to the following problems to be solved:\\n\\n1. How to onboard creators\\n2. How to get permission for publication\\n3. How to build incentives for all stakeholders\\n4. How to distribute payments\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\* \\\\\\\\n \\\\*\\\\*All those are very hard problems that we felt weren’t addressed as we wished with the current options.\\n\\n## Enter Mirror\\n\\nMirror provides a great solution for our vision of on-demand physical magazines.\\n\\n* Content is created and signed by its creator\\n* Every creator has already a payment gateway (ETH wallet)\\n\\nWhich can enable us to build tools:\\n\\n* For creators to digitally sign/suggest payout on demand\\n* That distribute royalties to every participant proportionally\\n* Build NFTs that can benefit stakeholders and creators perpetually\\n\\nThese are the reasons we are looking to completely switch our current application to web3.\\n\\nWhile we understand that only a fraction of content currently lives within Mirror, we want to help build the tools needed to fulfill our vision and believe Mirror can be the perfect platform to do so (and bet that it will grow exponentially).\",\"timestamp\":1633530706,\"title\":\"Screenbreak: Transitioning to Web3\"},\"digest\":\"316uLbq5eqcEXYRoyatIAY0VCgNqLpCZpB-OEDprK28\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xC8C646e8bAEe44A82b622614FDe570DE91883E26\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jSPX2zcLmSqo04m87zdoXegpoyNPJyDg_PPNMmifM5Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KJpg6LlPC36HrNrqzbnp6-LyUfpAjy_VPCcKGkWqTFc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"iZll6nayYPdgMqUUGfGQOeILvSnCLrNbasBV4DoNcJkpN24XhNnGZCeoYQevK2VaK3tDBEJTOlYTLZslW4WMVQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1656f4b53f46bbf7d02aea8617191d1059b738342574479e909afcd5a71e85fd41f9bd4f497f527fc6459dfce9f5e7153f046b4d4d6656b315a48be1b5a1ef341c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jSPX2zcLmSqo04m87zdoXegpoyNPJyDg_PPNMmifM5Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KJpg6LlPC36HrNrqzbnp6-LyUfpAjy_VPCcKGkWqTFc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"glizDqLKLScnapqbIm77YOIW0HdCJloNOA6irL7PO6k\"}"
