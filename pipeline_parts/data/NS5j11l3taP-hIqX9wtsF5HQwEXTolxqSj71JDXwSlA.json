"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"This is my version of Turkish kebabs which I made 'off the cuff' after searching unsuccessfully for a recipe online. The original sandwiches are made from meat that is pressed into a loaf and grilled on a rotating spit. The meat is shaved off as it gets crispy and then put into a pita sandwich. My recipe calls for thin slices of meat to be marinated and then broiled to get the same effect without a huge rotating grill. Serve in a warmed pita with goat cheese, tzatziki sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and pepperoncinis.\\n\\n[ \\n ](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/1137765/)\\n\\nMarinade:\\n2 large onions, chopped\\n2 garlic cloves, crushed\\n½ cup olive oil\\n2 tablespoons lemon juice\\n1 teaspoon dried oregano\\n1 teaspoon ground black pepper\\n½ teaspoon ground turmeric\\n1 pinch curry powder\\n1 teaspoon salt\\n1 pound beef flank steak, thinly sliced\\n\\n## Directions\\n\\nInstructions Checklist\\n\\n* Step 1\\n\\n  Place the chopped onions in a large ceramic bowl and crush with the bottom of a glass until juice is rendered and onions look translucent. Stir in 2 crushed garlic cloves, 1/2 cup olive oil, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, oregano, 1 teaspoon black pepper, turmeric, curry powder, and 1 teaspoon salt. Mix well; add the sliced beef and toss to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator overnight.\\n* Step 2\\n\\n  Combine the sour cream, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, dill, and 1 crushed clove of garlic. Mix well; cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.\\n* Step 3\\n\\n  Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.\\n* Step 4\\n\\n  Remove the meat from the marinade mixture, brushing off extra onions. Spread the slices on a baking sheet without overlapping, and salt to taste. Broil about 3 minutes per side or until browned and crispy, turning halfway through cooking.\\n* Step 5\\n\\n  Divide the cooked meat between the pita breads, and drizzle with tzatziki sauce to serve.\",\"timestamp\":1640341440,\"title\":\"Turkish Kebabs\"},\"digest\":\"ttH2PPtvwC_J5-dibgrwEbjlFjSqTW79Y5kHJ1IuFi0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xAAC6A535Fb0d86d478199e868Cc9a19E2766aBE3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"vaHmQ-T-TzZJfv5wmgEuYbksmQbeOY_SZXtzEORdRsQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"v9euusM86amkfR7BqlqCId1c5cXT4gmD_QbQTZ5OxMg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"UuKKvo6Jif8nGZL283BaTKHyYWVsebnQ40zfmiFewu2vmxLIrwSHLJBogvtMEw1WVCPOb5bPm_oaM0LiSeZqtQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x092501b5c2c3179d6c72ea62801b3a310d06f41dac5b0533edeabeaef7e18a9f7c2164c362074add39c3086e81e66bdff86cbd63a8fbfb978c009e3b600e38761b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"vaHmQ-T-TzZJfv5wmgEuYbksmQbeOY_SZXtzEORdRsQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"v9euusM86amkfR7BqlqCId1c5cXT4gmD_QbQTZ5OxMg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ttH2PPtvwC_J5-dibgrwEbjlFjSqTW79Y5kHJ1IuFi0\"}"
