Her name was Barbara Allen.\\n\\nAll in the merry month of May,   When green buds they were swellin', Young Jemmy Grove on his death-bed lay   For love of Barbara Allen.\\n\\nHe sent his man unto her then,   To the town where she was dwellin'; \\\"You must come to my master dear,   Gif your name be Barbara Allen.\\n\\n\\\"For death is printed on his face,   And o'er his heart is stealin': Then haste away to comfort him,   O lovely Barbara Allen.\\\"\\n\\nThough death be printed on his face   And o'er his heart is stealin', Yet little better shall he be   For bonny Barbara Allen.\\n\\nSo slowly, slowly, she came up,   And slowly she came nigh him; And all she said, when there she came,   \\\"Young man, I think y'are dying.\\\"\\n\\nHe turned his face unto her straight,   With deadly sorrow sighing; \\\"O lovely maid, come pity me,   I'm on my deathbed lying.\\\"--\\n\\n\\\"If on your deathbed you do lie,   What needs the tale you are tellin'; I cannot keep you from your death:   Farewell,\\\" said Barbara Allen.\\n\\nHe turned his face unto the wall,   As deadly pangs he fell in: \\\"Adieu! adieu! adieu to you all!   Adieu to Barbara Allen!\\\"\\n\\nAs she was walking o'er the fields,   She heard the bell a knellin'; And every stroke did seem to say,--   UNWORTHY BARBARA ALLEN.\\n\\nShe turned her body round about,   And spied the corpse a coming: \\\"Lay down, lay down the corpse,\\\" she said,   \\\"That I may look upon him.\\\"\\n\\nWith scornful eye she look-ed down,   Her cheek with laughter swellin'; Whilst all her friends cried out amain,   UNWORTHY BARBARA ALLEN.\\n\\nWhen he was dead, and laid in grave,   Her heart was struck with sorrow, \\\"O mother, mother, make my bed,   For I shall die to-morrow!\\n\\n\\\"Hard-hearted creature him to slight,   Who lov-ed me so dearly: O that I had been more kind to him,   When he was alive and near me!\\\"\\n\\nShe, on her deathbed as she lay,   Begged to be buried by him; And sore repented of the day,   That she did e'er deny him.\\n\\n\\\"Farewell,\\\" she said, \\\"ye maidens all,   And shun the fault I fell in: Henceforth take warning by the fall   Of cruel Barbara Allen.\\\"\\n\\nSWEET WILLIAM'S GHOST.\\n\\nThere came a ghost to Margaret's door,   With many a grievous groan, And aye he tirl-ed at the pin;   But answer made she none.\\n\\n\\\"Is this my father Philip?

Or is't my true love Willie,   From Scotland new come home?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"'Tis not thy father Philip;   Nor yet thy brother John: But 'tis thy true love Willie   From Scotland new come home.\\n\\n\\\"O sweet Margret! O dear Margret!   I pray thee speak to me: Give me my faith and troth, Margret,   As I gave it to thee.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thy faith and troth thou'se never get,   Of me shalt never win, Till that thou come within my bower,   And kiss my cheek and chin.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If I should come within thy bower,   I am no earthly man: And should I kiss thy rosy lip,   Thy days will not be lang.\\n\\n\\\"O sweet Margret, O dear Margret,   I pray thee speak to me: Give me my faith and troth, Margret,   As I gave it to thee.\\\"--\\n\\n\\\"Thy faith and troth thou'se never get,   Of me shalt never win, Till thou take me to yon kirkyard,   And wed me with a ring.\\\"--\\n\\n\\\"My bones are buried in a kirkyard   Afar beyond the sea, And it is but my sprite, Margret,   That's speaking now to thee.\\\"\\n\\nShe stretch-ed out her lily-white hand,   As for to do her best: \\\"Hae there your faith and troth, Willie,   God send your soul good rest!\\\"\\n\\nNow she has kilted her robes of green,   A piece below her knee: And a' the live-lang winter night   The dead corpse followed she.\\n\\n\\\"Is there any room at your head, Willie?
