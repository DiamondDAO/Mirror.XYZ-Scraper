"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Because I started so early in the game I have a lot of Alpha cards. In total I have 272 types of cards, counting the golden ones, all with their respective levels. It was impossible for me to make a screenshot of all the cards so if you are interested, here I leave the [link to my profile in the game](https://splinterlands.com/?p=collection&a=juanmiguelsalas). It is one of the things of the blockchain, they are there for everyone to see.\\n\\nSometimes I don't know whether to think that this is something positive or negative.\\n\\nEspecially with the increase in the value of everything related to the game in general, not only the cards, but also the tokens (DEC, SPS, SPT) and the other things that can be acquired in the game (Lands, Plots, Totems) It seems a bit dangerous to be exhibiting what you have so openly but â€¦ this is how it works and that is how it was accepted from the beginning.\\n\\nTo be honest, I did not imagine that it was going to increase everything so much. Not only the value itself but also the number of users who are playing the game daily. It seems incredible but it is true. I even stopped playing for almost a year (for personal reasons I stayed away from the entire virtual world at that time).\\n\\nBut luckily I didn't sell the cards, I kept them and that has become a reward. Not only can I win tokens and other cards on a daily basis by playing, but I can also rent the cards in the rental market that the game has and have a passive entry of money. And it is not a small amount that is earned this way.\\n\\nThat's not counting the SPS token airdrop that is already in its 110th day.\\n\\nBut not only because of this is Splinterlands my favorite game, I also like to play it. I am a fan of playing with the beings of Water. They are the ones that I use the most, especially because they mostly use magic and it is my favorite power in the game.\\n\\nI also like beings from Earth and those of Fire, but my favorites are definitely those of Water.\\n\\nI have been in the \\\"Silver Gold Knights\\\" guild for several months now and have participated in many battles with them.\\n\\nSo many things that can be done in the game right now that it really is incredible.\\n\\nThe truth is that it is a game that I really enjoy!\",\"timestamp\":1638432402,\"title\":\"Splinterlands is one of my favorite games\"},\"digest\":\"R5UA1uVGBBLdQoA4M_l4pc1hncsajJ4bpqrWbz8t2qA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0f29Ecf7999a5c0e787e088909097C77c4dE49A5\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4YXlhiBQ7cUtnUzmYBFt59Ag6s3lmIhET3B01d3X6KY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qcRfiDSu_67UsohLCQ5gmFg1pAHXCOJJL1ryZAtuy2s\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"07E-CN2sphrY8Gw052O_Tg9A8FUwjpsgrfX2RudC-_PBo92yEEMelvFSZQ5suGEWG0Ifl9dOYrcWLaXiVwGhUw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x95855393c5dbc39ef573f4e1b0c80a0a1a80c880ba77409c612dc8a1f7b7a4e26df4fd63aa2240f1d5cf3ca5761dd65ad9578f865b1800d2cf42d58753b9ae731c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4YXlhiBQ7cUtnUzmYBFt59Ag6s3lmIhET3B01d3X6KY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qcRfiDSu_67UsohLCQ5gmFg1pAHXCOJJL1ryZAtuy2s\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"R5UA1uVGBBLdQoA4M_l4pc1hncsajJ4bpqrWbz8t2qA\"}"
