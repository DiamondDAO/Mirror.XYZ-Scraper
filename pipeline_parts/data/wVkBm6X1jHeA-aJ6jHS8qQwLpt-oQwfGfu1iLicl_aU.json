The two parties will jointly promote the widespread use of RAI, work together on lending market creation, liquidity building, cross-chain lending and other fields for mutual benefits of the two communities.\\n\\nReflexer is a platform where anyone can use their crypto collateral to issue true stablecoins which are not pegged or linked to fiat. The first stablecoin which can be minted on Reflexer is RAI, a pure ETH backed asset\\n\\nWePiggy focuses on building an open-source, non-custodial crypto-asset lending market protocol that helps users realize asset appreciation and maximize utilization across many blockchain networks. On the premise of giving priority to funding security, WePiggy actively creates a more diverse lending market, optimizes the execution efficiency of smart contracts, and expands more dimensions of the business logic. Under the WePiggy multi-chain deployment plan, WePiggy is covering Ethereum, OKExChain, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Huobi Eco Chain, and innovative public and Layer-2 networks.\\n\\n## WePiggy + Reflexer\\n\\nWePiggy community will evaluate RAI token and propose to list RAI on the lending market of Ethereum mainnet.\\n\\nThe Reflexer team will contribute to the liquidity building of RAI in WePiggy’s lending market, to eliminate systemic risk of WePiggy protocol as much as possible.\\n\\nMore cooperation, including diversified portfolio management, cross-chain asset transfer and lending, will be released to RAI token holders in the future.\\n\\n“Through this cooperation, we can expand WePiggy’s influence to a larger user base, expand the scale of high-quality assets of the WePiggy lending protocol on the Ethereum mainnet. If RAI gets listed on WePiggy, that will expand the use of RAI, make RAI more decentralized, and ensure the stability of RAI from the market environment. Also, token holders of RAI can enjoy the powerful and secure application of WePiggy. ”\\n\\n– Ron Zheng, Founder and CEO of WePiggy\\n\\n“This partnership with WePiggy will enhance RAI’s utility and reach, as well as give the community a great avenue to borrow other assets with it.
