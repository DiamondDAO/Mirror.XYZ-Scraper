But SMBs and startup marketing budget considerations often involve more hidden marketing costs.\\n\\n## But, is your SMB even ready for an agency to do your marketing efforts?\\n\\n![Photo by Dan Burton on Unsplash](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LF49CvrRYWKllhu-_IKnj.jpg?height=4160&width=6240)\\n\\nAnswer these questions about your marketing team:\\n\\n* Do they have a marketing process that involves measuring sales and marketing through smart tracking tools?\\n* Do they have a marketing spend in mind that leads to a growth path with digital marketing strategies?\\n* Do they need a new marketing strategy or someone to do just paid advertising?\\n\\nAgencies will continue to say their marketing channels lead to the highest marketing ROI. An agency's business objective is to maintain that retainer more often than to lower your marketing costs.\\n\\nTruth be told, if an SMB needs thought leadership of its marketing strategy from an agency to inform its marketing budget, more often than not you'll come away from agencies disappointed.\\n\\n## How to create a marketing budget with ad agencies\\n\\nSMBs should restructure retainers to pay a heavier upfront marketing cost to have a greater marketing budget.\\n\\nThe above example had its marketing budgets be $1,600 in fees + $900 in paid advertising. But, ask your agency what goes into a monthly management that alters the business and campaign goals.\\n\\nHeadline, not much.\\n\\nAgencies often spend the first couple of months setting a few strategies they've used for a sales and marketing process. Then, paid advertising occurs more on autopilot with way less minimal involvement since monitoring tools and algorithms allocates funds/optimize for campaign goals.\\n\\nThis isn't a win-win situation. Structure business objectives differently.\\n\\n## Structure 1: Incentive-based where SMBs provide bigger marketing budgets if agencies succeed — and they share profits\\n\\n![Photo by Cytonn Photography on Unsplash](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kp3F9Z8vqrFA1qljLi-Xl.jpg?height=4016&width=6016)\\n\\nAsk agencies to hit a specific gross revenue goal. For every revenue generated on top of that, agencies can get paid more.\\n\\nIn essence, figure out a way where business objectives on agency and client side are incentivized to do more.\\n\\nRemember that established companies can't do deals like this as extra gross revenue can't be redistributed into more marketing.\\n\\n## Structure 2: Heavier upfront marketing costs rather than a monthly retainer\\n\\nAgencies ask for retainers because it is guaranteed revenue for X months. It rarely is to do business as usual to achieve its sales and marketing for you. \\n\\nIn that example above, I'd say negotiate with them to do $4,800 upfront, with still 3-month minimum retainer and $900/month marketing budget. \\n\\nBut, then say you'll pay the agency a media commission of 15 percent for doing its management. \\n\\nThat way there is some structure for the agency to get a monthly revenue and also, especially if combined with the structure above, the agency is absolutely incentivized to increase your gross revenue.\\n\\nA startup marketing budget shouldn't be held hostage to a heavy maintenance fee.\\n\\n## How much does marketing cost for startups?\\n\\nAccording to a survey, the average marketing expenditure is around 7-11.2 percent from gross revenues. I've seen studies that small businesses spend 1-3 percent of their budget.\\n\\nBut rather than focusing on a percentage, I think SMBs can optimize how to structure deals to maximize their marketing budget. \\n\\nTraditional advertising will ask you to fund market research, find your customer lifetime value sooner than later, and build brand awareness to move your target audience down a funnel.\\n\\nI'm here to say don't create your marketing budget around that. Instead, restructure deals with agencies so both parties are aligned on business goals, where there is a data-driven approach to both share revenue.\\n\\n![Photo by Clay Banks on Unsplash](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Apq7a_bX6BRw3IsyJrePi.jpg?height=2002&width=3000)\\n\\n## Agency fees cannot be a huge part of your marketing budget for SMBs\\n\\nFeels like this post drove that home well, but we'll do it again.\\n\\nBest way to lower marketing costs is not to invest in more lead monitoring tools or diversify marketing channels or managing marketing expenses tightly.\\n\\nInstead, a startup marketing budget should be influenced more by a business structure, where a client's sales are highly incentivizing an agency's revenue. Marketing goals and business goals should align to both company's total revenue goals.\\n\\nAnd yes — sales, sales and more sales will address how much companies spend in marketing. But the biggest marketing decision a startup can have on its marketing budget may have nothing to do with paid ads and more to do with a business structure.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n*Tony Lee (aka [@sheckii](https://www.twitter.com/sheckii)) is a digital advertising entrepreneur who worked on brands like 20th Century Fox, Sam’s Club, ABC Entertainment, Nintendo, Starz, sweetgreen, outdoor voices, First Republic Bank, Kane’s Furniture and more.
