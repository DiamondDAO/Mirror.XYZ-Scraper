Time: 11.30.2021*\\n\\nI had brainstormed with Summer just like we used to do every time we met, she share one discovery from her discovery in Bible and language.\\n\\nStarting from “Word” inspiration in [John1:1 NIV](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/JHN.1.1.NIV):\\n\\n“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. \\n\\nHe was with God in the beginning.\\n\\nThrough him all things were made; without him, nothing was made that has been made.\\n\\nIn him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind.”\\n\\n\\\\*In Chinese, the Word is translated as Dao, meaning “way,” “road,” “path,” “course,” “speech,” or “method” also a Chinese philosophy called Dao, Confucius can be said to be “**Truth**”. The first sentence in Chinese is 太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神. Dao is God.\\n\\nDoes it imply that the language was generated by itself? Or anything beyond human beings’ imagination?\\n\\nIt reminded me of [Tower of ](https://blog.logos.com/really-happened-tower-babel/)**[Babel](https://blog.logos.com/really-happened-tower-babel/)**, (מִגְדַּל בָּבֶל‎，Migdal Bāḇēl), in [Genesis 11:1–9](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%2011.1%E2%80%939?webSyncID=7297b324-8dce-036a-a50d-c026055eb505&sessionGUID=9a095e90-0535-6bba-314e-2c87136a2c9c):\\n\\nAt first, the whole earth had **one language** and the same **words**. And as people migrated from the east they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. And they started to work and build the city together, then Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower that humankind was building. Then he decided to scatter people in different languages so they won’t understand each other.\\n\\nLanguage serves as the foundation in the genesis period of humankind, in general, communication consists of words, organized in a conventional way, which could be expressed through writing, speaking, and gesture. It is also very identical in each group, community, and nation. I found the fascinating part of language is when I try to fully understand it, I have to embrace the entire entity that a language carries, combining with culture, history, an essential spirit that is deeply rooted inside of it, that is what glues the individual in the community tightly. The language could be regarded as the spirit of a community, the blood of a body, the roots of a tree. \\n\\nMany see language just as a tool, it is undervalued in many cultures than a science major. I found it is because it has such a permeability, \",\"timestamp\":1638276744,\"title\":\"For us in many years\"},\"digest\":\"Bu8gXp76I1xwb0wIQf0m2ci4uKKcxwee2k4uQogZHnw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xb12e31D8F7DdA2Dd3733c25cB3B01F6924cd3497\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Lr5PDIM-7CYqjKY0FyUbQOdVAKZQxW4dWUFVQIH1V0E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MvcF9owt1yEKt107pZTz6dsxILIe3Lvjfh3Ydj7quqk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"B3hEW2b103xhyspJpqJgpPEGASucSaZLOuZnfaVqeMnX6BKBB3xOYn93SYh4lkEM1EJuh50ll6_fWP2z6DBYJA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x24935a61236472302068f0d7667525159380a54a71ce668a6c9841c372f9b4fc0a8b2384113da3d62cc57a62c2f23825765253cf48c700cc992e0d4024e392961c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Lr5PDIM-7CYqjKY0FyUbQOdVAKZQxW4dWUFVQIH1V0E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MvcF9owt1yEKt107pZTz6dsxILIe3Lvjfh3Ydj7quqk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"AVmw0g7OyPjkm8OIFrl7Ps631apCE35MIraeiE5rMxg\"}"
