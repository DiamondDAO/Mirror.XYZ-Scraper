"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Bonded by our shared values of maximum decentralization, we are excited to announce that decentralized indexing protocol The Graph is integrating with zkSync to provide an efficient way to query blockchain data.\\n\\nIn addition to EVM-Compatibility, many DeFi and NFT protocols rely on The Graph — a critical piece of infrastructure that will ensure a seamless porting experience from Ethereum to zkSync.\\n\\n[zkPorter](https://zksync.io/zkevm/#what-is-zkporter), zkSync’s off-chain data availability system that offers 1–3 cent transactions, will also unlock another class of applications that were previously not feasible to build on Ethereum. These applications, such as decentralized games and social media, will leverage The Graph to index and query endless possibilities of data.\\n\\nThis integration will allow indexed data from open APIs powered by The Graph, called subgraphs, to read and organize zkSync 2.0 data, allowing for faster and more efficient access.\\n\\n“We’re thrilled that zkSync will be the first ZK-protocol indexed by The Graph! Developers will be able to build on zk-rollups and easily retrieve data for their dapps with subgraphs. This is a feat for the entire Ethereum ecosystem to empower developers worldwide to build with zkSync.” says Eva Beylin, Director of The Graph Foundation.\\n\\n# About The Graph\\n\\n[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is the indexing and query layer of web3. Developers build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, that applications can query using GraphQL. The Graph currently supports indexing data from 25 different networks including Ethereum, NEAR, Arbitrium, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, Celo, Fantom, Moonbeam, IPFS, and PoA with more networks coming soon. To date, over [24,000 subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/explorer/) have been deployed on the hosted service and now subgraphs can be deployed directly on the network. Over 24,000 developers have built subgraphs for applications such as Uniswap, Synthetix, Foundation, Zora, KnownOrigin, Gnosis, Balancer, Livepeer, DAOstack, Audius, Decentraland, and many others.\\n\\nThe Graph Network’s self service experience for developers launched in July; since then over 200 subgraphs have migrated to the Network, with over 160 Indexers serving subgraph queries, 7,000+ delegators, and 2,000+ curators to date. More than 3 million GRT has been signaled to date with an average of 20K GRT per subgraph.\\n\\nIf you are a developer building an application or web3 application, you can use subgraphs for indexing and querying data from blockchains. [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) allows applications to efficiently and performantly present data in a UI and allows other developers to use your subgraph too! You can [deploy a subgraph](https://thegraph.com/docs/quick-start) to the network using the newly launched [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) or query existing subgraphs that are in the [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer/). The Graph would love to welcome you to be [Indexers](https://thegraph.com/blog/over-two-hundred-testnet-nodes), [Curators](https://thegraph.com/blog/curator-program-launch) and/or [Delegators](https://thegraph.com/docs/network#delegating) on The Graph’s mainnet. Join The Graph community by introducing yourself in The Graph [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/vtvv7FP) for technical discussions, join The Graph’s [Telegram](https://t.me/GraphProtocol) chat, and follow The Graph on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/graphprotocol?s=20)! The Graph’s developers and members of the community are always eager to chat with you, and The Graph ecosystem has a growing community of developers who support each other.\\n\\n[The Graph Foundation](https://thegraph.com/blog/announcing-the-graph-foundation) oversees The Graph Network. The Graph Foundation is overseen by the [Technical Council](https://thegraph.com/blog/inaugurating-council-and-grants). [Edge & Node](https://edgeandnode.com/), [StreamingFast](https://streamingfast.io/) and [Figment](http://figment.io/) are three of the many organizations within The Graph ecosystem.\\n\\n# About zkSync Protocol\\n\\nzkSync is a ZK rollup, a Layer-2 scaling solution that preserves the security properties of the underlying blockchain by leveraging the latest generation of succinct zero-knowledge proofs.\\n\\nzkSync v1 is a ZK rollup for payments, live on Ethereum mainnet since July 2020. Adopted by many protocols, wallets, and dapps, zkSync has powered over 4M transactions.\\n\\nzkSync v2 is a ZK rollup for generic smart contracts that preserves EVM-compatibility and composability. The upcoming testnet currently has more than 150 registrations from projects across DeFi, NFT, Games, DAOs, Exchanges, On-Ramps, Wallets, Developer Tools, Data Analytics.\\n\\nLearn more and keep up to date by visiting zkSync’s [Medium Blog](https://medium.com/matter-labs) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zksync).\\n\\n# About Matter Labs\\n\\nMatter Labs is the pioneer of Zero-Knowledge Proof technology on Ethereum. The company has launched the [first-ever public ZK rollup prototype](https://twitter.com/the_matter_labs/status/1081959506454695936) in early 2019, was [the first to implement recursive ZK proofs](https://medium.com/matter-labs/zksync-v1-1-reddit-edition-recursion-up-to-3-000-tps-subscriptions-and-more-fea668b5b0ff) on Ethereum, and created [the world’s first practical FPGA-based hardware for ZKP acceleration](https://medium.com/matter-labs/worlds-first-practical-hardware-for-zero-knowledge-proofs-acceleration-72bf974f8d6e) in 2020. Matter Labs recently [launched a zkEVM testnet](https://medium.com/matter-labs/unisync-a-port-of-uniswap-v2-on-the-zkevm-b12954748504), making zkSync the first ZK rollup capable of executing native Ethereum smart contracts.\\n\\nMatter Labs’ team is rooted in the belief that cryptography and blockchain are essential technologies for protecting and fostering freedom globally. They enable mutually distrusting counterparts to collaborate without relying on authorities or third parties. Blockchains enabled by zero-knowledge proofs promise a fairer and more efficient global digital economy.\\n\\nMatter Labs, a remote-first organization, is [actively hiring](https://boards.eu.greenhouse.io/matterlabs).\",\"timestamp\":1637809410,\"title\":\"zkSync will be the first ZK-Protocol indexed by The Graph\"},\"digest\":\"O60m1AN6KjOUg1KZpAYoYEsRdbC3EvzevZ_98FiitFQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x384659f8ECFFCbe49118aD29fB323DBF9DA2809F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LNmsdGVK6lSMmN15nMAJZBHYAdnbjfPvrxOKjiXcf6Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gewk56AsNPIO3UbM7AVM6cfCQCbN2v7vQWIDo8ULkb4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"C6SkuZdjvlDPW1mWXSoYv9B1NTMGYhS5iY-qJ2uzdFozcEXRAyOVRBPDRbHOl3I5BC8jPUghOHoFSc9xFy-0-w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x06619c0aa3bf05a476b2411efed71e558adabf68504425aa7bfc0107e65f2cf849853f6dfbaa31d3102f4c08bb6e040ca9f3ed025707a82f6086f5a516f7cd8f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LNmsdGVK6lSMmN15nMAJZBHYAdnbjfPvrxOKjiXcf6Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gewk56AsNPIO3UbM7AVM6cfCQCbN2v7vQWIDo8ULkb4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"O60m1AN6KjOUg1KZpAYoYEsRdbC3EvzevZ_98FiitFQ\"}"
