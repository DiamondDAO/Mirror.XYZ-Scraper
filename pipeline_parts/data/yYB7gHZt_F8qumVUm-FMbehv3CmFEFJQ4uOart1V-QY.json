"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I often tell my friends that as long as we make more money, we will immediately move to a richer place to live and work. If we are not rich, we will not go, because what we see in our eyes is all Poor people, poor houses, then input this information into our heads, and we will naturally become poor. Because a human being is actually a biological machine, what it inputs is what it outputs.\\n\\n```\\nLet me tell a story first.\\n\\nMr. Chen of a large company in Shenzhen, when recruiting talents for many years, at the last hurdle, she always asks a very strange question: \\\"If your current income is not very high, but it is enough to make a living, you are currently considering renting a house. There are two options. One is to rent a two-bedroom and one-living room in a high-end community with three other friends. The interior furniture and appliances are complete, and the surroundings are successful people. Spread the rent of 2000 yuan, property fees, and utilities; the other is a small single room in a village in the city, where small traders, migrant workers and unemployed people live together, but the rent is very cheap, as long as 500 yuan, the rent is paid one by one, but the room is small , Can't put down anything but a bed. How would you choose?\\\"\\n\\nOver the years, this question has been answered by many people, but it boils down to only four answers:\\n```\\n\\nThe first answer:\\n\\n```\\nI will choose a cheap house. I don't care about the environment. As for the opinions of others, it has nothing to do with me. Usually, for this kind of person, no matter how good the other party is, Mr. Chen will not hire him;\\n```\\n\\nThe second answer:\\n\\n```\\nI will choose to live in a high-end community, life is in a hurry, just learn to enjoy. She may stay with this kind of person, but she will not reuse it, and will assign clerks or miscellaneous jobs;\\n```\\n\\nThe third answer:\\n\\n```\\nIf everyone chooses to live in a high-end community, for everyone's common interests, I will consider renting together. The pressure of life will also motivate me to make money. In addition to the specific job requirements of candidates, she generally arranges them to be business or grassroots leaders;\\n```\\n\\nThe fourth answer:\\n\\n```\\nI will choose a high-end community, because the environment will affect a person's outlook on life and values. A good environment can cultivate an elegant life style, strive to live a better life, and be more clear about my goals and pursuits. For such people, they are usually assigned to important positions and given more opportunities for training and promotion.\\n\\nOne day, President Chen once again rejected a \\\"highly talented student\\\" from a well-known domestic university. Finally, the HR manager couldn't restrain his excitement. Holding the other party's resume, he opened the door of President Chen's office and \\\"questioned\\\": \\\"So Why don't outstanding talents be hired? What kind of talents does the company need?\\\" Mr. Chen was not angry. She motioned to the personnel manager to sit down and told her about a personal experience.\\n\\nIn the second year she came to work in Shenzhen, the community where she lived had to be demolished. She negotiated with three other villagers to rent a house together. After seeing a lot of houses, she finally settled on a two-bedroom and one-living room in a high-end community. The home appliances are all available. The monthly rent is 1,600 yuan, and each person only needs to share 400. Yuan. That night, the four of them were so excited that they couldn't sleep at night! However, on the day of signing the contract, fellow A suddenly changed his mind and said that he didn't want to rent anymore. The price was too expensive, so it would be better to live in a village in the city. Reluctantly, because the rent and deposit were difficult to bear, the four of them separated and never met again.\\n\\nSeven years later, President Chen met three other people by chance. When talking about renting a house that year, everyone had a different view. And fellow A is the one who made the first choice. Later, she met a boyfriend in the village in the city, and she still lived there after marriage. A few years later, the cruelty of life made A forget that she was a highly qualified person. Educated college students often have the same loud voice as others, arguing with their husbands on their hips, or even fighting; B is the person who made the second choice. She is an enjoymentist. Although the income from work is not bad, it is basically There is no money left on the site. On the surface, the scenery is boundless, but life is stretched. The credit card overdraft is very serious. I talked about it with a few boyfriends. C is the person who made the third choice. She is now a well-known company. The business manager of a foreign company bought a house in the center of Shenzhen with a loan, and talked about a boyfriend in the same industry, who was about to get married, and his life was very moist; and D, Mr. Chen himself, made the fourth choice. At that time, she was already the boss of a large cultural enterprise. She bought a house in Shenzhen and married a like-minded husband. She has a happy family and a wealth of life, and her childhood literary dreams have also come true! Having said that, the personnel manager seems to understand.\\n\\nMr. Chen told her: \\\"My Sihao didn't mean to look down on the village in the city. I just wanted to explain a truth. Your mentality and your choices determine your life.\\n\\nThe first kind of people are too selfish and only think about themselves, but today's society is an era that emphasizes cooperation and win-win, and only considers their own interests at all times. This kind of selfishness will affect the cohesion of a team;\\n\\nThe second kind of people are too good at enjoying, but don’t know how to work hard, but there is no free lunch in the world;\\n\\nThe third type of person, he understands what kind of life he wants to live, and will work hard and struggle, and because he has a strong sense of cooperation, he is more likely to get help from others and more likely to succeed; and the fourth type of person, Have a higher vision, a direction, a goal, an ideal, and a spirit of cooperation. Everything can proceed from the overall situation.\\n\\nTherefore, he will eventually become the master of his own destiny! \\\"\\n\\nHearing this, the HR manager already understood everything, and she rewritten the next sentence in her work notes: Mindset decides choice, choice decides life! What kind of mentality you have, what kind of life you have!\\n\\nMy short-term goal is to move our office to Lujiazui, the most expensive office building. I will choose an office above 80 floors and a luxurious villa facing the corner of the Huangpu River. I ask my partners to work hard to make money, and we will move step by step towards the most expensive environment for consumption.\\n```\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\n```\\nPeople are not successful all their lives, often because there are too few successful friends, and successful people are in good places. If your fate is not good, the only way to change your fate is to \\\"find someone with a good fate and make friends with him.\\\" Follow them and your fate will be fine. So you have to go to those rich places to work, live, and entertain. Choosing who to cooperate with and how to cooperate in life requires skills and methods. If you don't make friends with an expert, and you don't worship a teacher, your life will be regrettable.\\n\\nIf you want to have a good life, the best way is to find someone with a good life, make friends with him, and join his career. Only with the same flow can we communicate, only with exchanges, can we trade, and trade can change our destiny.\\n\\nNetworking is money, and relationship is strength. It depends on the strength of a person and the relationship around him. Whether the relationship is good or not, it depends on the community he lives in. It's ok to work in that office building. There are three cups of wine in the world, one pot of tea for Qianqiu Daye, who should drink this pot of tea, and who should drink this cup of wine. It’s only a matter of time to follow the leader to become an official; to follow a rich man, it’s a matter of time to make a fortune; when you enter the circle of the boss, you will gradually become a boss. If you enter the circle of the poor, you will gradually become poor.\\n\\nShanghai tycoon Du Yuesheng can make a fortune. He doesn’t enter the kitchen of the Huang’s compound to burn the fire. It’s impossible if he doesn’t follow Huang Jinrong. Therefore, you must choose a good environment to live in and work. Don’t worry about your money, not to mention. You have no money, what do you feel sorry for?\\n```\",\"timestamp\":1634803124,\"title\":\"Man is the product of the environment, and changing the environment can change the destiny\"},\"digest\":\"NC-FDGuAdHpaMs1WNyKdgIojvdjWNStmCEAIFSLjRu8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0B27cE1053585ef548Cd78618Ee0b73D84246712\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FWHKuUadZNUD2AcIaH2jGL63PlPKxJxdB2P-UVSGKyo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TGI_NAnOwHtvZb-9m7wqNj24YxnrIjurKisiIm7dHV0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"d6AqQnV-H0WViLIS93lfXqvnE2ZNHIqz5ibRQrj-72zo4dhcCZ194l0DxY-M89F8n4Ddkh19PP11NrUy9Q8qUg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9d86f85b2660a8cb6873525924f9adb0c5f51dfb6229fed7a757ade2793c2f19347cb8076af39b12116743e30b34d1bacb42c80a0030cd272dd62c1ad0ad21081b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FWHKuUadZNUD2AcIaH2jGL63PlPKxJxdB2P-UVSGKyo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TGI_NAnOwHtvZb-9m7wqNj24YxnrIjurKisiIm7dHV0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"NC-FDGuAdHpaMs1WNyKdgIojvdjWNStmCEAIFSLjRu8\"}"
