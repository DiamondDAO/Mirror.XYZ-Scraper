"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The main task of the boss is to think about how to make things easier. When the cheetah’s mother taught the little cheetah to kill the antelope, she couldn’t pursue it a hundred steps away.\\n\\nTouch it quietly within 5 steps. Then you just need to jump up from the grass and you will be able to pounce on the antelope. If the antelope does not catch it at once, the chance of catching up will be small as soon as the antelope runs.\\n\\nObviously, if the chase is a hundred paces away from the beginning, the antelope will take a long time to react and run directly, and the cheetah will never want to catch up with the antelope.\\n\\nWe have a word in ancient China called Baibu Chuanyang. It means that the archery can be shot within a hundred steps. This is called skill. But we are bosses, don't look for such capable people everywhere to be employees.\\n\\nOne is because it is difficult to find; the other is because of the high cost.\\n\\nIn fact, we can't find such an employee, and there is a solution, which is to run directly in front of the target and play two steps through Yang! You must be able to shoot. For example, you will understand this kind of thinking.\\n\\nThe Chinese are best at cooking, but there are few world-class chain Chinese restaurants? Why? Because Chinese cuisine is too complicated, the game is Baibu Chuanyang.\\n\\nWhy are McDonald's and KFC branches all over the world? Because their food, including the kitchen machines, are all custom-made products that are process-oriented, and the recruited employees will become masters with a little training, because the operation is very simple. Therefore, recruiting a few inexperienced college students can also run a McDonald's or KFC store. This is why McDonald's and KFC can open branches all over the world. Because it's simple. In Chinese restaurants, even if you want to open a branch, the tastes of the first store and the second store are different. The reason is that each chef's craftsmanship is different, so the taste is different. It is too difficult to make the taste of the dishes the same. This is why it is difficult for Chinese restaurants to scale up.\\n\\nSmart bosses do things not to show how strong they are, but to do their best to make the work simple. In fact, the same is true for smart bosses. They are all easy to understand, whether they are employees or customers. Everyone knows how to do it, instead of pretending to be advanced, the employees can't understand it after a lot of talk, and the result is no effect.\\n\\nTherefore, only simple things are easy to scale and teach employees. Enterprises can easily grow bigger.\\n\\nSun Tzu said: \\\"A person who is good at war, who has no wise name, has no courage, is better than an easy winner!\\\" In other words, a person who is good at war only does simple things and only fights enemies that can be fought. The same is true for the boss. All your thinking points are to make the enemy simple and make things simple. Let your troops get something with just one hand, instead of showing off their ability to do those difficult things. This is also the guideline for my options. I only do very, very simple projects; or make the project very, very simple and let the staff do it.\",\"timestamp\":1634795043,\"title\":\"The main task of the boss\"},\"digest\":\"bE_RQyojRBOFroa_Ab6spbNMk1GN-hLuJcdrhEk1ycY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ZY9WgNKs90pen7O4q5tuKnX42EhgOfsLPz9TkDUuVAF3olE5NR6xUrM2cnm3gHvqbdz38VmqXvt01s17YLxHtQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"bE_RQyojRBOFroa_Ab6spbNMk1GN-hLuJcdrhEk1ycY\"}"
