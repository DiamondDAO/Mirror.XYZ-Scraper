"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"He ordered his galley to be immediately prepared, and left his seraglio, casting a look of sadness on the beautiful gardens where only yesterday he had received the homage of his prostrate slaves. He bade farewell to his wives, saying that he hoped soon to return, and descended to the shore, where the rowers received him with acclamations.  The sail was set to a favourable breeze, and Ali, leaving the shore he was never to see again, sailed towards Erevesa, where he hoped to meet the Lord High Commissioner Maitland.  But the time of prosperity had gone by, and the regard which had once been shown him changed with his fortunes.  The interview he sought was not granted.\\n\\nThe sultan now ordered a fleet to be equipped, which, after Ramadan, was to disembark troops on the coast of Epirus, while all the neighbouring pashas received orders to hold themselves in readiness to march with all the troops of their respective Governments against Ali, whose name was struck out of the list of viziers.  Pacho Bey was named Pasha of Janina and Delvino on condition of subduing them, and was placed in command of the whole expedition.\\n\\nHowever, notwithstanding these orders, there was not at the beginning of April, two months after the attempted assassination of Pacho Bey, a single soldier ready to march on Albania.  Ramadan, that year, did not close until the new moon of July.  Had Ali put himself boldly at the head of the movement which was beginning to stir throughout Greece, he might have baffled these vacillating projects, and possibly dealt a fatal blow to the Ottoman Empire.  As far back as 1808, the Hydriotes had offered to recognise his son Veli, then Vizier of the Morea, as their Prince, and to support him in every way, if he would proclaim the independence pf the Archipelago.  The Moreans bore him no enmity until he refused to help them to freedom, and would have returned to him had he consented.\\n\\nOn the other side, the sultan, though anxious for war, would not spend a penny in order to wage it; and it was not easy to corrupt some of the great vassals ordered to march at their own expense against a man in whose downfall they had no special interest.  Nor were the means of seduction wanting to Ali, whose wealth was enormous; but he preferred to keep it in order to carry on the war which he thought he could no longer escape.  He made, therefore, a general appeal to all Albanian warriors, whatever their religion. Mussulmans and Christians, alike attracted by the prospect of booty and good pay, flocked to his standard in crowds.\\n\\nHe organised all these adventurers on the plan of the Armatous, by companies, placing a captain of his own choice at the head of each, and giving each company a special post to defend.  Of all possible plans this was the best adapted to his country, where only a guerilla warfare can be carried on, and where a large army could not subsist.\\n\\nIn repairing to the posts assigned to them, these troops committed such terrible depredations that the provinces sent to Constantinople demanding their suppression.  The Divan answered the petitioners that it was their own business to suppress these disorders, and to induce the Klephotes to turn their arms against Ali, who had nothing to hope from the clemency of the Grand Seigneur.  At the same time circular letters were addressed to the Epirotes, warning them to abandon the cause of a rebel, and to consider the best means of freeing themselves from a traitor, who, having long oppressed them, now sought to draw down on their country all the terrors of war.  Ali, who every where maintained numerous and active spies, now redoubled his watchfulness, and not a single letter entered Epirus without being opened and read by his agents.  As an extra precaution, the guardians of the passes were enjoined to slay without mercy any despatch-bearer not provided with an order signed by Ali himself; and to send to Janina under escort any travellers wishing to enter Epirus. These measures were specially aimed against Suleyman Pacha, who had succeeded Veli in the government of Thessaly, and replaced Ali himself in the office of Grand Provost of the Highways. Suleyman's secretary was a Greek called Anagnorto, a native of Macedonia, whose estates Ali had seized, and who had fled with his family to escape further persecution.  He had become attached to the court party, less for the sake of vengeance on Ali than to aid the cause of the Greeks, for whose freedom he worked by underhand methods.  He persuaded Suleyman Pacha that the Greeks would help him to dethrone Ali, for whom they cherished the deepest hatred, and he was determined that they should learn the sentence of deprivation and excommunication fulminated against the rebel pacha.  He introduced into the Greek translation which he was commissioned to make, ambiguous phrases which were read by the Christians as a call to take up arms in the cause of liberty.  In an instant, all Hellas was up in arms.  The Mohammedans were alarmed, but the Greeks gave out that it was in order to protect themselves and their property against the bands of brigands which had appeared on all sides.  This was the beginning of the Greek insurrection, and occurred in May 1820, extending from Mount Pindus to Thermopylae.  However, the Greeks, satisfied with having vindicated their right to bear arms in their own defence, continued to pay their taxes, and abstained from all hostility.\\n\\nAt the news of this great movement, Ali's friends advised him to turn it to his own advantage.  \\\"The Greeks in arms,\\\" said they, \\\"want a chief: offer yourself as their leader.  They hate you, it is true, but this feeling may change.  It is only necessary to make them believe, which is easily done, that if they will support your cause you will embrace Christianity and give them freedom.\\\"\\n\\nThere was no time to lose, for matters became daily more serious. Ali hastened to summon what he called a Grand Divan, composed of the chiefs of both sects, Mussulmans and Christians.  There were assembled men of widely different types, much astonished at finding themselves in company: the venerable Gabriel, Archbishop of Janina, and uncle of the unfortunate Euphrosyne, who had been dragged thither by force; Abbas, the old head of the police, who had presided at the execution of the Christian martyr; the holy bishop of Velas, still bearing the marks of the chains with which Ali had loaded him; and Porphyro, Archbishop of Arta, to whom the turban would have been more becoming than the mitre.\\n\\nAshamed of the part he was obliged to play, Ali, after long hesitation, decided on speaking, and, addressing the Christians, \\\"O Greeks!\\\" he said, \\\"examine my conduct with unprejudiced minds, and you will see manifest proofs of the confidence and consideration which I have ever shown you.  What pacha has ever treated you as I have done?  Who would have treated your priests and the objects of your worship with as much respect?  Who else would have conceded the privileges which you enjoy? for you hold rank in my councils, and both the police and the administration of my States are in your hands.  I do not, however, seek to deny the evils with which I have afflicted you; but, alas! these evils have been the result of my enforced obedience to the cruel and perfidious orders of the Sublime Porte.  It is to the Porte that these wrongs must be attributed, for if my actions be attentively regarded it will be seen that I only did harm when compelled thereto by the course of events.  Interrogate my actions, they will speak more fully than a detailed apology.\\n\\n\\\"My position with regard to the Suliotes allowed no half-and-half measures.  Having once broken with them, I was obliged either to drive them from my country or to exterminate them.  I understood the political hatred of the Ottoman Cabinet too well not to know that it would declare war against me sooner or later, and I knew that resistance would be impossible, if on one side I had to repel the Ottoman aggression, and on the other to fight against the formidable Suliotes.\\n\\n\\\"I might say the same of the Parganiotes.  You know that their town was the haunt of my enemies, and each time that I appealed to them to change their ways they answered only with insults and threats.  They constantly aided the Suliotes with whom I was at war; and if at this moment they still were occupying Parga, you would see them throw open the gates of Epirus to the forces of the sultan.  But all this does not prevent my being aware that my enemies blame me severely, and indeed I also blame myself, and deplore the faults which the difficulty of my position has entailed upon me.  Strong in my repentance, I do not hesitate to address myself to those whom I have most grievously wounded.  Thus I have long since recalled to my service a great number of Suliotes, and those who have responded to my invitation are occupying important posts near my person.  To complete the reconciliation, I have written to those who are still in exile, desiring them to return fearlessly to their country, and I have certain information that this proposal has been everywhere accepted with enthusiasm.  The Suliotes will soon return to their ancestral houses, and, reunited under my standard, will join me in combating the Osmanlis, our common enemies.\\n\\n\\\"As to the avarice of which I am accused, it seems easily justified by the constant necessity I was under of satisfying the inordinate cupidity of the Ottoman ministry, which incessantly made me pay dearly for tranquillity.  This was a personal affair, I acknowledge, and so also is the accumulation of treasure made in order to support the war, which the Divan has at length declared.\\\"\\n\\nHere Ali ceased, then having caused a barrel full of gold pieces to be emptied on the floor, he continued:\\n\\n\\\"Behold a part of the treasure I have preserved with so much care, and which has been specially obtained from the Turks, our common enemies: it is yours.  I am now more than ever delighted at being the friend of the Greeks.  Their bravery is a sure earnest of victory, and we will shortly re-establish the Greek Empire, and drive the Osmanlis across the Bosphorus.  O bishops and priests of Issa the prophet! bless the arms of the Christians, your children.  O primates!  I call upon you to defend your rights, and to rule justly the brave nation associated with my interests.\\\"\\n\\nThis discourse produced very different impressions on the Christian priests and archons.  Some replied only by raising looks of despair to Heaven, others murmured their adhesion.  A great number remained uncertain, not knowing what to decide.  The Mirdite chief, he who had refused to slaughter the Kardikiotes, declared that neither he nor any Skipetar of the Latin communion would bear arms against their legitimate sovereign the sultan.  But his words were drowned by cries of \\\"Long live Ali Pasha!  Long live the restorer of liberty!\\\" uttered by some chiefs of adventurers and brigands.\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\nYet next day, May 24th, 1820, Ali addressed a ,circular letter to his brothers the Christians, announcing that in future he would consider them as his most faithful subjects, and that henceforth he remitted the taxes paid to his own family.  He wound up by asking for soldiers, but the Greeks having learnt the instability of his promises, remained deaf to his invitations.  At the same time he sent messengers to the Montenegrins and the Servians, inciting them to revolt, and organised insurrections in Wallachia and Moldavia to the very environs of Constantinople.\\n\\nWhilst the Ottoman vassals assembled only in small numbers and very slowly under their respective standards, every day there collected round the castle of Janina whole companies of Toxidae, of Tapazetae, and of Chamidae; so that Ali, knowing that Ismail Pacho Bey had boasted that he could arrive in sight of Janina without firing a gun, said in his turn that he would not treat with the Porte until he and his troops should be within eight leagues of Constantinople.\\n\\nHe had fortified and supplied with munitions of war Ochrida, Avlone, Cannia, Berat, Cleisoura, Premiti, the port of Panormus, Santi-Quaranta, Buthrotum, Delvino, Argyro-Castron, Tepelen, Parga, Prevesa, Sderli, Paramythia, Arta, the post of the Five Wells, Janina and its castles.  These places contained four hundred and twenty cannons of all sizes, for the most part in bronze, mounted on siege-carriages, and seventy mortars.  Besides these, there were in the castle by the lake, independently of the guns in position, forty field-pieces, sixty mountain guns, a number of Congreve rockets, formerly given him by the English, and an enormous quantity of munitions of war.  Finally, he endeavoured to establish a line of semaphores between Janina and Prevesa, in order to have prompt news of the Turkish fleet, which was expected to appear on this coast.\\n\\nAli, whose strength seemed to increase with age, saw to everything and appeared everywhere; sometimes in a litter borne by his Albanians, sometimes in a carriage raised into a kind of platform, but it was more frequently on horseback that he appeared among his labourers.  Often he sat on the bastions in the midst of the batteries, and conversed familiarly with those who surrounded him. He narrated the successes formerly obtained against the sultan by Kara Bazaklia, Vizier of Scodra, who, like himself, had been attained with the sentence of deprivation and excommunication; recounting how the rebel pacha, shut up in his citadel with seventy-two warriors, had seen collapse at his feet the united forces of four great provinces of the Ottoman Empire, commanded by twenty-two pachas, who were almost entirely annihilated in one day by the Guegues.  He reminded them also, of the brilliant victory gained by Passevend Oglon, Pacha of Widdin, of quite recent memory, which is celebrated in the warlike songs of the Klephts of Roumelia.\\n\\nAlmost simultaneously, Ali's sons, Mouktar and Veli, arrived at Janina.  Veli had been obliged, or thought himself obliged, to evacuate Lepanto by superior forces, and brought only discouraging news, especially as to the wavering fidelity of the Turks.  Mouktar, on the contrary, who had just made a tour of inspection in the Musache, had only noticed favourable dispositions, and deluded himself with the idea that the Chaonians, who had taken up arms, had done so in order to aid his father.  He was curiously mistaken, for these tribes hated Ali with a hatred all the deeper for being compelled to conceal it, and were only in arms in order to repel aggression.\\n\\nThe advice given by the sons to their father as to the manner of treating the Mohammedans differed widely in accordance with their respective opinions.  Consequently a violent quarrel arose between them, ostensibly on account of this dispute, but in reality on the subject of their father's inheritance, which both equally coveted. Ali had brought all his treasure to Janina, and thenceforth neither son would leave the neighbourhood of so excellent a father.  They overwhelmed him with marks of affection, and vowed that the one had left Lepanto, and the other Berat, only in order to share his danger. Ali was by no means duped by these protestations, of which he divined the motive only too well, and though he had never loved his sons, he suffered cruelly in discovering that he was not beloved by them.\\n\\nSoon he had other troubles to endure.  One of his gunners assassinated a servant of Vela's, and Ali ordered the murderer to be punished, but when the sentence was to be carried out the whole corps of artillery mutinied.  In order to save appearances, the pacha was compelled to allow them to ask for the pardon of the criminal whom he dared not punish.  This incident showed him that his authority was no longer paramount, and he began to doubt the fidelity of his soldiers. The arrival of the Ottoman fleet further enlightened him to his true position.  Mussulman and Christian alike, all the inhabitants of Northern Albania, who had hitherto concealed their disaffection under an exaggerated semblance of devotion, now hastened to make their submission to the sultan.  The Turks, continuing their success, laid siege to Parga, which was held by Mehemet, Veli's eldest son.  He was prepared to make a good defence, but was betrayed by his troops, who opened the gates of the town, and he was compelled to surrender at discretion.  He was handed over to the commander of the naval forces, by whom he was well treated, being assigned the best cabin in the admiral's ship and given a brilliant suite.  He was assured that the sultan, whose only quarrel was with his grandfather, would show him favour, and would even deal mercifully with Ali, who, with his treasures, would merely be sent to an important province in Asia Minor.  He was induced to write in this strain to his family and friends in order to induce them to lay down their arms.\\n\\nThe fall of Parga made a great impression on the Epirotes, who valued its possession far above its real importance.  Ali rent his garments and cursed the days of his former good fortune, during which he had neither known how to moderate his resentment nor to foresee the possibility of any change of fortune.\\n\\nThe fall of Parga was succeeded by that of Arta of Mongliana, where was situated Ali's country house, and of the post of the Five Wells. Then came a yet more overwhelming piece of news Omar Brionis, whom Ali, having formerly despoiled of its wealth, had none the less, recently appointed general-in-chief, had gone over to the enemy with all his troops!\\n\\nAli then decided on carrying out a project he had formed in case of necessity, namely, on destroying the town of Janina, which would afford shelter to the enemy and a point of attack against the fortresses in which he was entrenched.  When this resolution was known, the inhabitants thought only of saving themselves and their property from the ruin from which nothing could save their country. But most of them were only preparing to depart, when Ali gave leave to the Albanian soldiers yet faithful to him to sack the town.\\n\\nThe place was immediately invaded by an unbridled soldiery.  The Metropolitan church, where Greeks and Turks alike deposited their gold, jewels, and merchandise, even as did the Greeks of old in the temples of the gods, became the first object of pillage.  Nothing was respected.  The cupboards containing sacred vestments were broken open, so were the tombs of the archbishops, in which were interred reliquaries adorned with precious stones; and the altar itself was defiled with the blood of ruffians who fought for chalices and silver crosses.\\n\\nThe town presented an equally terrible spectacle; neither Christians nor Mussulmans were spared, and the women's apartments, forcibly entered, were given up to violence.  Some of the more courageous citizens endeavoured to defend their houses arid families against these bandits, and the clash of arms mingled with cries and groans. All at on e the roar of a terrible explosion rose above the other sounds, and a hail of bombs, shells, grenade's, and rockets carried devastation and fire into the different quarters of the town, which soon presented the spectacle of an immense conflagration.  Ali, seated on the great platform of the castle by the lake, which seemed to vomit fire like a volcano, directed the bombardment, pointing out the places which must be burnt.  Churches, mosques, libraries, bazaars, houses, all were destroyed, and the only thing spared by the flames was the gallows, which remained standing in the midst of the ruins.\\n\\nOf the thirty thousand persons who inhabited Janina a few hours previously, perhaps one half had escaped.  But these had not fled many leagues before they encountered the outposts of the Otto man army, which, instead of helping or protecting them, fell upon them, plundered them, and drove them towards the camp, where slavery awaited them.  The unhappy fugitives, taken thus between fire and. sword, death behind and slavery before, uttered a terrible cry, and fled in all directions. Those who escaped the Turks were stopped in the hill passes by the mountaineers rushing down to the>> rey; only large numbers who held together could force a passage.\\n\\nIn some cases terror bestows extraordinary strength, there were mothers who, with infants at the breast, covered on foot in one day the fourteen leagues which separate Janina from Arta.  But others, seized with the pangs of travail in the midst of their flight, expired in the woods, after giving birth to babes, who, destitute of succour, did not survive their mothers.  And young girls, having disfigured themselves by gashes, hid themselves in caves, where they died of terror and hunger.\\n\\nThe Albanians, intoxicated with plunder and debauchery, refused to return to the castle, and only thought of regaining their country and enjoying the fruit of their rapine.  But they were assailed on the way by peasants covetous of their booty, and by those of Janina who had sought refuge with them.  The roads and passes were strewn with corpses, and the trees by the roadside converted into gibbets.  The murderers did not long survive their victims.\",\"timestamp\":1639209164,\"title\":\"\\nThe sultan now ordered a fleet to be equipped, which, after Ramadan, was to disembark troops on the coast \"},\"digest\":\"F_HOa2UXJ9m3lAQpHnoBgPlJsXZey79X1nknHZ5R3lw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x51D393CD2fE363A89232ff9D8Ac75A13bD6a52e7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8IVc4MChpD-TrhRSqGesXJbrp-LQNKNIWzR57Ww44mE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"VAU5mM_i1qGQqzHgVEx3hKU_MF1-e2a6MZGEvuM3z28\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"WfeuGYfGwF8qstGaCYL8LlrUDhlusoorcX9bT16t6vdmZSa5Sn9w5_YqxJPRDP5GpWHk8Q6FTqtVHPG4hq970A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xdc5d6214b14e5c5cac476dec7c2e388e85384908087837d957d9277379fac05e5cfa48fd2aa71ce4476c77609affa038955ba5adf44153e4f8996d513844eb061c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8IVc4MChpD-TrhRSqGesXJbrp-LQNKNIWzR57Ww44mE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"VAU5mM_i1qGQqzHgVEx3hKU_MF1-e2a6MZGEvuM3z28\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"F_HOa2UXJ9m3lAQpHnoBgPlJsXZey79X1nknHZ5R3lw\"}"
