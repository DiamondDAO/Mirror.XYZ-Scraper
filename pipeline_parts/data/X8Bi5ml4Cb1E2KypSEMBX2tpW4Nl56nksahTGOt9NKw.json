"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I personally think that as the popularity of encrypted assets becomes higher and higher, this situation is becoming less and less likely to happen, because we have seen that more funds/users are currently flowing into the crypto field than in any previous period. In my opinion, there are too many funds and active development activities that have been shelved, making it impossible for prices to fall continuously for many years.\\nWe saw that this year's derivatives premium/open interest (OI) overheated + bubble burst, all of which fell by about 70+%, but then we only traded sideways for three months and then rebounded. Since alt currency assets become parabolic at such a rapid rate, the price retracement is usually very steep.\\nThis has not happened at any other stage since the birth of cryptocurrency, because cryptocurrency is now receiving widespread public attention, so I believe that 2022 will not hit the low point set in 2021 again. It must happen once in decades like the new crown pneumonia epidemic to cause this situation and lead to a serious crash. I believe that if the market overheats again, a -70% retracement + sideways again is possible, but I think this is unlikely to happen before a more significant increase. Due to SBF’s public image and his repeated active emphasis on cooperation with regulators, FTX will become a core topic and attract the attention of the public. This is a huge boon for cryptocurrencies. This is also what I think SOL is better than others. Another reason L1 has an advantage. From a development perspective, a public perception perspective, an institutional perspective, or a regulatory perspective, it is meaningless to compare 2017 with 2021 now.\\nThe maturity of crypto as an asset class means that as long as the economy is healthy, crypto assets should eventually start to rise together with the S&P 500 index. The upside of crypto is much larger than any other asset class at present, but even if its scale is already To catch up with other asset classes, as we have seen in companies such as FAANG, encryption can still achieve steady growth. I believe that as people hope to reap profits beyond the traditional market, we will see more and more institutions/hedge funds enter the crypto field. Professionals responsible for investing in high-net-worth individuals will inevitably be asked: why they don’t The allocation of cryptocurrencies means that the volatility of crypto assets should begin to narrow in the next few years.\",\"timestamp\":1633629298,\"title\":\"How likely is a multi-year bear market?\"},\"digest\":\"zVJgV04ze8RjkeKWSOCpm5Xyx47TBFiq1Sq9hf1q4Yc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x80a20347b912dC538639112754320C016812a554\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"y3KHNpeoVoagi20SG5PcsVb3sVA3yRqWjsyORBE0oVk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kgr3brbxTpx3_njV6alGaSdqWHsa9-n7JHsN5iWV46M\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"cjZ6Fude3TFJsyZCpAbLD1Yl9wgqZSSRtV83wgZxNJ0yMQPk0az-9fw1lvIJ1R8eWSuL1WwnRb6dnsvFXJgoVQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0c27af5b430916972d877d6a26b04f27f86dbe9dffb94686daf3f589a1aa099b01fbcdff2ad678eec9a17e9642116ebbb579313e7f64241048e0603a927706e91b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"y3KHNpeoVoagi20SG5PcsVb3sVA3yRqWjsyORBE0oVk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kgr3brbxTpx3_njV6alGaSdqWHsa9-n7JHsN5iWV46M\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"zVJgV04ze8RjkeKWSOCpm5Xyx47TBFiq1Sq9hf1q4Yc\"}"
