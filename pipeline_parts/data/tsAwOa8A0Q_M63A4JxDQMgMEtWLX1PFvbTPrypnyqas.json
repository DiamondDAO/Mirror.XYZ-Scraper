Users can log in to the Airdrop DApp,verify whether they have the qualification of airdrops and claim the airdrop without paying a handling fee.\\n\\nAt present, the development of Airdrop DApp is drawing to a close and entering the internal testing session. After the test, it will be launched timely with the result of the airdrop.\\n\\n> **AmaraLend v1 has been improved and continues to optimize**\\n\\nAfter the launch of the AmaraLend beta, the Amara technical team immediately started the development of the AmaraLend v1 version.

It is determined to become the top underlying infrastructure payment tool in the Polkadot ecosystem and truly bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital finance. Currently, the Amara team is still demonstrating the lending through technical research. It will officially be a milestone.\\n\\n> **The AmaraLend NFT point system will be released after AmaraLend v1 goes online.**\\n\\nThe AmaraLend NFT is made according to Zapper’s point system. Users can earn points and improve the level by doing daily or weekly tasks. Users can receive NFT after reaching the corresponding level. Users don’t need to burn their tokens to mint NFT, but receive it with a negligible handling fee being charged.\\n\\nFor now, Amara NFT is still in the finalization stage of the design. NFT is an important tag of Amara core users, and also an important passport to the graded rights of the platform. Amara NFT holders will be considered as the core members .\\n\\nAmbassadors who have already passed the 1st round selection and perform well will enjoy the opportunity to directly get NFT without using points.\\n\\n## **Chapter 2 Ecological operation**\\n\\n> **AmaraLink made its way to the finals of Shanghai Wanxiang Blockchain Hackathon and will have a project roadshow**\\n\\nWanxiang Blockchain Hackathon has been incubating talents and ideas for the global blockchain industry since 2016.
