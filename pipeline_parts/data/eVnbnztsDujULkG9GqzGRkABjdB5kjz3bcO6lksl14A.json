"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Of all whose crowning bay-leaves crown their mother\\nRome, in the notes first heard of thine I read\\nMy brother.\\n\\nNo dust that death or time can strew may smother\\nLove and the sense of kinship inly bred\\nFrom loves and hates at one with one another.\\n\\nTo thee was Caesar's self nor dear nor dread,\\nSong and the sea were sweeter each than other:\\nHow should I living fear to call thee dead\\nMy brother?\\n\\n'INSULARUM OCELLE'\\n\\nSark, fairer than aught in the world that the lit skies cover,\\nLaughs inly behind her cliffs, and the seafarers mark\\nAs a shrine where the sunlight serves, though the blown clouds hover,\\nSark.\\n\\nWe mourn, for love of a song that outsang the lark,\\nThat nought so lovely beholden of Sirmio's lover\\nMade glad in Propontis the flight of his Pontic bark.\\n\\nHere earth lies lordly, triumphal as heaven is above her,\\nAnd splendid and strange as the sea that upbears as an ark,\\nAs a sign for the rapture of storm-spent eyes to discover,\\nSark.\\n\\nIN SARK\\n\\nAbreast and ahead of the sea is a crag's front cloven asunder\\nWith strong sea-breach and with wasting of winds whence terror is\\nshed\\nAs a shadow of death from the wings of the darkness on waters that\\nthunder\\nAbreast and ahead.\\n\\nAt its edge is a sepulchre hollowed and hewn for a lone man's bed,\\nPropped open with rock and agape on the sky and the sea thereunder,\\nBut roofed and walled in well from the wrath of them slept its dead.\\n\\nHere might not a man drink rapture of rest, or delight above wonder,\\nBeholding, a soul disembodied, the days and the nights that fled,\\nWith splendour and sound of the tempest around and above him and\\nunder,\\nAbreast and ahead?\\n\\nIN GUERNSEY\\nTO THEODORE WATTS\\n\\nI.\\n\\nThe heavenly bay, ringed round with cliffs and moors,\\nStorm-stained ravines, and crags that lawns inlay,\\nSoothes as with love the rocks whose guard secures\\nThe heavenly bay.\\n\\nO friend, shall time take ever this away,\\nThis blessing given of beauty that endures,\\nThis glory shown us, not to pass but stay?\\n\\nThough sight be changed for memory, love ensures\\nWhat memory, changed by love to sight, would say -\\nThe word that seals for ever mine and yours\\nThe heavenly bay.\\n\\nII.\\n\\nMy mother sea, my fostress, what new strand,\\nWhat new delight of waters, may this be,\\nThe fairest found since time's first breezes fanned\\nMy mother sea?\\n\\nOnce more I give me body and soul to thee,\\nWho hast my soul for ever:  cliff and sand\\nRecede, and heart to heart once more are we.\\n\\nMy heart springs first and plunges, ere my hand\\nStrike out from shore:  more close it brings to me,\\nMore near and dear than seems my fatherland,\\nMy mother sea.\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nAcross and along, as the bay's breadth opens, and o'er us\\nWild autumn exults in the wind, swift rapture and strong\\nImpels us, and broader the wide waves brighten before us\\nAcross and along.\\n\\nThe whole world's heart is uplifted, and knows not wrong;\\nThe whole world's life is a chant to the sea-tide's chorus;\\nAre we not as waves of the water, as notes of the song?\\n\\nLike children unworn of the passions and toils that wore us,\\nWe breast for a season the breadth of the seas that throng,\\nRejoicing as they, to be borne as of old they bore us\\nAcross and along.\\n\\nIV.\\n\\nOn Dante's track by some funereal spell\\nDrawn down through desperate ways that lead not back\\nWe seem to move, bound forth past flood and fell\\nOn Dante's track.\\n\\nThe grey path ends:  the gaunt rocks gape:  the black\\nDeep hollow tortuous night, a soundless shell,\\nGlares darkness:  are the fires of old grown slack?\\n\\nNay, then, what flames are these that leap and swell\\nAs 'twere to show, where earth's foundations crack,\\nThe secrets of the sepulchres of hell\\nOn Dante's track?\\n\\nV.\\n\\nBy mere men's hands the flame was lit, we know,\\nFrom heaps of dry waste whin and casual brands:\\nYet, knowing, we scarce believe it kindled so\\nBy mere men's hands.\\n\\nAbove, around, high-vaulted hell expands,\\nSteep, dense, a labyrinth walled and roofed with woe,\\nWhose mysteries even itself not understands.\\n\\nThe scorn in Farinata's eyes aglow\\nSeems visible in this flame:  there Geryon stands:\\nNo stage of earth's is here, set forth to show\\nBy mere men's hands.\\n\\nVI.\\n\\nNight, in utmost noon forlorn and strong, with heart athirst and\\nfasting,\\nHungers here, barred up for ever, whence as one whom dreams affright\\nDay recoils before the low-browed lintel threatening doom and casting\\nNight.\\n\\nAll the reefs and islands, all the lawns and highlands, clothed with\\nlight,\\nLaugh for love's sake in their sleep outside:  but here the night\\nspeaks, blasting\\nDay with silent speech and scorn of all things known from depth to\\nheight.\\n\\nLower than dive the thoughts of spirit-stricken fear in souls\\nforecasting\\nHell, the deep void seems to yawn beyond fear's reach, and higher\\nthan sight\\nRise the walls and roofs that compass it about with everlasting\\nNight.\\n\\nVII.\\n\\nThe house accurst, with cursing sealed and signed,\\nHeeds not what storms about it burn and burst:\\nNo fear more fearful than its own may find\\nThe house accurst.\\n\\nBarren as crime, anhungered and athirst,\\nBlank miles of moor sweep inland, sere and blind,\\nWhere summer's best rebukes not winter's worst.\\n\\nThe low bleak tower with nought save wastes behind\\nStares down the abyss whereon chance reared and nursed\\nThis type and likeness of the accurst man's mind,\\nThe house accurst.\\n\\nVIII.\\n\\nBeloved and blest, lit warm with love and fame,\\nThe house that had the light of the earth for guest\\nHears for his name's sake all men hail its name\\nBeloved and blest.\\n\\nThis eyrie was the homeless eagle's nest\\nWhen storm laid waste his eyrie:  hence he came\\nAgain, when storm smote sore his mother's breast.\\n\\nBow down men bade us, or be clothed with blame\\nAnd mocked for madness:  worst, they sware, was best:\\nBut grief shone here, while joy was one with shame,\\nBeloved and blest.\\n\\nENVOI\\n\\nFly, white butterflies, out to sea,\\nFrail pale wings for the winds to try,\\nSmall white wings that we scarce can see\\nFly.\\n\\nHere and there may a chance-caught eye\\nNote in a score of you twain or three\\nBrighter or darker of tinge or dye.\\n\\nSome fly light as a laugh of glee,\\nSome fly soft as a low long sigh:\\nAll to the haven where each would be\\nFly.\\n\\nEnd\",\"timestamp\":1636103896,\"title\":\"My brother, my Valerius, dearest
