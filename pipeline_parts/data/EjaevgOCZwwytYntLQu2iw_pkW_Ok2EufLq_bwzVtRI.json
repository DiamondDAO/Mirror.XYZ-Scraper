"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"What may sorrow send\\nToward thee now from lips that said\\n'Friend'?\\n\\nSighs and songs to blend\\nPraise with pain uncomforted\\nThough the praise ascend?\\n\\nDarkness

heart\\nDear.\\n\\nTime and chance may sear\\nHope with grief, and death may part\\nHand from hand's clasp here:\\n\\nMemory, blind with tears that start,\\nSees through every tear\\nAll that made thee, as thou art,\\nDear.\\n\\nIV.\\n\\nTrue and tender, single-souled,\\nWhat should memory do\\nWeeping o'er the trust we hold\\nTrue?\\n\\nKnown and loved of few,\\nBut of these, though small their fold,\\nLoved how well were you!\\n\\nChange, that makes of new things old,\\nLeaves one old thing new;\\nLove which promised truth, and told\\nTrue.\\n\\nV.\\n\\nKind as heaven, while earth's

blown\\nWhom thy love held fast.\\n\\nDead thy king, and void his throne:\\nYet for grief at last\\nLove makes music of his own\\nPast.\\n\\nPAST DAYS\\n\\nI.\\n\\nDead and gone, the days we had together,\\nShadow-stricken all the lights that shone\\nRound them, flown as flies the blown foam's feather,\\nDead and gone.\\n\\nWhere we went, we twain, in time foregone,\\nForth by land and sea, and cared not whether,\\nIf I go again, I go alone.\\n\\nBound am I with time as with a tether;\\nThee perchance death leads enfranchised on,\\nFar from deathlike life and changeful weather,\\nDead and gone.\\n\\nII.\\n\\nAbove the sea and sea-washed town we dwelt,\\nWe twain together, two brief summers, free\\nFrom heed of hours as light as clouds that melt\\nAbove the sea.\\n\\nFree from all heed of aught at all were we,\\nSave chance of change that clouds or sunbeams dealt\\nAnd gleam of heaven to windward or to lee.\\n\\nThe Norman downs with bright grey waves for belt\\nWere more for us than inland ways might be;\\nA clearer sense of nearer heaven was felt\\nAbove the sea.\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nCliffs and downs and headlands which the forward-hasting\\nFlight of dawn and eve empurples and embrowns,\\nWings of wild sea-winds and stormy seasons wasting\\nCliffs and downs,\\n\\nThese, or ever man was, were:  the same sky frowns,\\nLaughs, and lightens, as before his soul, forecasting\\nTimes to be, conceived such hopes as time discrowns.\\n\\nThese we loved of old:  but now for me the blasting\\nBreath of death makes dull the bright small seaward towns,\\nClothes with human change these all but everlasting\\nCliffs and downs.\\n\\nAUTUMN AND WINTER\\n\\nI.\\n\\nThree months bade wane and wax the wintering moon\\nBetween two dates of death, while men were fain\\nYet of the living light that all too soon\\nThree months bade wane.\\n\\nCold autumn, wan with wrath of wind and rain,\\nSaw pass a soul sweet as the sovereign tune\\nThat death smote silent when he smote again.\\n\\nFirst went my friend, in life's mid light of noon,\\nWho loved the lord of music:  then the strain\\nWhence earth was kindled like as heaven in June\\nThree months bade wane.\\n\\nII.\\n\\nA herald soul before its master's flying\\nTouched by some few moons first the darkling goal\\nWhere shades rose up to greet the shade, espying\\nA herald soul;\\n\\nShades of dead lords of music, who control\\nMen living by the might of men undying,\\nWith strength of strains that make delight of dole.\\n\\nThe deep dense dust on death's dim threshold lying\\nTrembled with sense of kindling sound that stole\\nThrough darkness, and the night gave ear, descrying\\nA herald soul.\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nOne went before, one after, but so fast\\nThey seem gone hence together, from the shore\\nWhence we now gaze:  yet ere the mightier passed\\nOne went before;\\n\\nOne whose whole heart of love, being set of yore\\nOn that high joy which music lends us, cast\\nLight round him forth of music's radiant store.\\n\\nThen went, while earth on winter glared aghast,\\nThe mortal god he worshipped, through the door\\nWherethrough so late, his lover to the last,\\nOne went before.\\n\\nIV.\\n\\nA star had set an hour before the sun\\nSank from the skies wherethrough his heart's pulse yet\\nThrills audibly:  but few took heed, or none,\\nA star had set.\\n\\nAll heaven rings back, sonorous with regret,\\nThe deep dirge of the sunset:  how should one\\nSoft star be missed in all the concourse met?\\n\\nBut, O sweet single heart whose work is done,\\nWhose songs are silent, how should I forget\\nThat ere the sunset's fiery goal was won\\nA star had set?\\n\\nTHE DEATH OF RICHARD WAGNER\\n\\nI.\\n\\nMourning on earth, as when dark hours descend,\\nWide-winged with plagues, from heaven; when hope and mirth\\nWane, and no lips rebuke or reprehend\\nMourning on earth.\\n\\nThe soul wherein her songs of death and birth,\\nDarkness and light, were wont to sound and blend,\\nNow silent, leaves the whole world less in worth.\\n\\nWinds that make moan and triumph, skies that bend,\\nThunders, and sound of tides in gulf and firth,\\nSpake through his spirit of speech, whose death should send\\nMourning on earth.\\n\\nII.\\n\\nThe world's great heart, whence all things strange and rare\\nTake form and sound, that each inseparate part\\nMay bear its burden in all tuned thoughts that share\\nThe world's great heart -\\n\\nThe fountain forces, whence like steeds that start\\nLeap forth the powers of earth and fire and air,\\nSeas that revolve and rivers that depart -\\n\\nSpake, and were turned to song:  yea, all they were,\\nWith all their works, found in his mastering art\\nSpeech as of powers whose uttered word laid bare\\nThe world's great heart.\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nFrom the depths of the sea, from the wellsprings of earth, from the\\nwastes of the midmost night,\\nFrom the fountains of darkness and tempest and thunder, from heights\\nwhere the soul would be,\\nThe spell of the mage of music evoked their sense, as an unknown\\nlight\\nFrom the depths of the sea.\\n\\nAs a vision of heaven from the hollows of ocean, that none but a god\\nmight see,\\nRose out of the silence of things unknown of a presence, a form, a\\nmight,\\nAnd we heard as a prophet that hears God's message against him, and\\nmay not flee.\\n\\nEye might not endure it, but ear and heart with a rapture of dark\\ndelight,\\nWith a terror and wonder whose core was joy, and a passion of thought\\nset free,\\nFelt inly the rising of doom divine as a sundawn risen to sight\\nFrom the depths of the sea.\\n\\nTWO PRELUDES\\n\\nI.\\n\\nLOHENGRIN\\n\\nLove, out of the depth of things,\\nAs a dewfall felt from above,\\nFrom the heaven whence only springs\\nLove,\\n\\nLove, heard from the heights thereof,\\nThe clouds and the watersprings,\\nDraws close as the clouds remove.\\n\\nAnd the soul in it speaks and sings,\\nA swan sweet-souled as a dove,\\nAn echo that only rings\\nLove.\\n\\nII.\\n\\nTRISTAN UND ISOLDE\\n\\nFate, out of the deep sea's gloom,\\nWhen a man's heart's pride grows great,\\nAnd nought seems now to foredoom\\nFate,\\n\\nFate, laden with fears in wait,\\nDraws close through the clouds that loom,\\nTill the soul see, all too late,\\n\\nMore dark than a dead world's tomb,\\nMore high than the sheer dawn's gate,\\nMore deep than the wide sea's womb,\\nFate.\\n\\nTHE LUTE AND THE LYRE\\n\\nDeep desire, that pierces heart and spirit to the root,\\nFinds reluctant voice in verse that yearns like soaring fire,\\nTakes exultant voice when music holds in high pursuit\\nDeep desire.\\n\\nKeen as burns the passion of the rose whose buds respire,\\nStrong as grows the yearning of the blossom toward the fruit,\\nSounds the secret half unspoken ere the deep tones tire.\\n\\nSlow subsides the rapture that possessed love's flower-soft lute,\\nSlow the palpitation of the triumph of the lyre:\\nStill the soul feels burn, a flame unslaked though these be mute,\\nDeep desire.\\n\\nPLUS INTRA\\n\\nI.\\n\\nSoul within sense, immeasurable, obscure,\\nInsepulchred and deathless, through the dense\\nDeep elements may scarce be felt as pure\\nSoul within sense.\\n\\nFrom depth and height by measurers left immense,\\nThrough sound and shape and colour, comes the unsure\\nVague utterance, fitful with supreme suspense.\\n\\nAll that may pass, and all that must endure,\\nSong speaks not, painting shews not:  more intense\\nAnd keen than these, art wakes with music's lure\\nSoul within sense.\\n\\nCHANGE\\n\\nBut now life's face beholden\\nSeemed bright as heaven's bare brow\\nWith hope of gifts withholden\\nBut now.\\n\\nFrom time's full-flowering bough\\nEach bud spake bloom to embolden\\nLove's heart, and seal his vow.\\n\\nJoy's eyes grew deep with olden\\nDreams, born he wist not how;\\nThought's meanest garb was golden;\\nBut now!\\n\\nA BABY'S DEATH\\n\\nI.\\n\\nA little soul scarce fledged for earth\\nTakes wing with heaven again for goal\\nEven while we hailed as fresh from birth\\nA little soul.\\n\\nOur thoughts ring sad as bells that toll,\\nNot knowing beyond this blind world's girth\\nWhat things are writ in heaven's full scroll.\\n\\nOur fruitfulness is there but dearth,\\nAnd all things held in time's control\\nSeem there, perchance, ill dreams, not worth\\nA little soul.\\n\\nII.\\n\\nThe little feet that never trod\\nEarth, never strayed in field or street,\\nWhat hand leads upward back to God\\nThe little feet?\\n\\nA rose in June's most honied heat,\\nWhen life makes keen the kindling sod,\\nWas not so soft and warm and sweet.\\n\\nTheir pilgrimage's period\\nA few swift moons have seen complete\\nSince mother's hands first clasped and shod\\nThe little feet.\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nThe little hands that never sought\\nEarth's prizes, worthless all as sands,\\nWhat gift has death, God's servant, brought\\nThe little hands?\\n\\nWe ask:  but love's self silent stands,\\nLove, that lends eyes and wings to thought\\nTo search where death's dim heaven expands.\\n\\nEre this, perchance, though love know nought,\\nFlowers fill them, grown in lovelier lands,\\nWhere hands of guiding angels caught\\nThe little hands.\\n\\nIV.\\n\\nThe little eyes that never knew\\nLight other than of dawning skies,\\nWhat new life now lights up anew\\nThe little eyes?\\n\\nWho knows but on their sleep may rise\\nSuch light as never heaven let through\\nTo lighten earth from Paradise?\\n\\nNo storm, we know, may change the blue\\nSoft heaven that haply death descries\\nNo tears, like these in ours, bedew\\nThe little eyes.\\n\\nV.\\n\\nWas life so strange, so sad the sky,\\nSo strait the wide world's range,\\nHe would not stay to wonder why\\nWas life so strange?\\n\\nWas earth's fair house a joyless grange\\nBeside that house on high\\nWhence Time that bore him failed to estrange?\\n\\nThat here at once his soul put by\\nAll gifts of time and change,\\nAnd left us heavier hearts to sigh\\n'Was life so strange?'\\n\\nVI.\\n\\nAngel by name love called him, seeing so fair\\nThe sweet small frame;\\nMeet to be called, if ever man's child were,\\nAngel by name.\\n\\nRose-bright and warm from heaven's own heart he came,\\nAnd might not bear\\nThe cloud that covers earth's wan face with shame.\\n\\nHis little light of life was all too rare\\nAnd soft a flame:\\nHeaven yearned for him till angels hailed him there\\nAngel by name.\\n\\nVII.\\n\\nThe song that smiled upon his birthday here\\nWeeps on the grave that holds him undefiled\\nWhose loss makes bitterer than a soundless tear\\nThe song that smiled.\\n\\nHis name crowned once the mightiest ever styled\\nSovereign of arts, and angel:  fate and fear\\nKnew then their master, and were reconciled.\\n\\nBut we saw born beneath some tenderer sphere\\nMichael, an angel and a little child,\\nWhose loss bows down to weep upon his bier\\nThe song that smiled.\\n\\nONE OF TWAIN\\n\\nI.\\n\\nOne of twain, twin-born with flowers that waken,\\nNow hath passed from sense of sun and rain:\\nWind from off the flower-crowned branch hath shaken\\nOne of twain.\\n\\nOne twin flower must pass, and one remain:\\nOne, the word said soothly, shall be taken,\\nAnd another left:  can death refrain?\\n\\nTwo years since was love's light song mistaken,\\nBlessing then both blossoms, half in vain?\\nNight outspeeding light hath overtaken\\nOne of twain.\\n\\nII.\\n\\nNight and light?  O thou of heart unwary,\\nLove, what knowest thou here at all aright,\\nLured, abused, misled as men by fairy\\nNight and light?\\n\\nHaply, where thine eyes behold but night,\\nSoft as o'er her babe the smile of Mary\\nLight breaks flowerwise into new-born sight.\\n\\nWhat though night of light to thee be chary?\\nWhat though stars of hope like flowers take flight?\\nSeest thou all things here, where all see vary\\nNight and light?\\n\\nDEATH AND BIRTH\\n\\nDeath and birth should dwell not near together:\\nWealth keeps house not, even for shame, with dearth:\\nFate doth ill to link in one brief tether\\nDeath and birth.\\n\\nHarsh the yoke that binds them, strange the girth\\nSeems that girds them each with each:  yet whether\\nDeath be best, who knows, or life on earth?\\n\\nIll the rose-red and the sable feather\\nBlend in one crown's plume, as grief with mirth:\\nIll met still are warm and wintry weather,\\nDeath and birth.\\n\\nBIRTH AND DEATH\\n\\nBirth and death, twin-sister and twin-brother,\\nNight and day, on all things that draw breath,\\nReign, while time keeps friends with one another\\nBirth and death.\\n\\nEach brow-bound with flowers diverse of wreath,\\nHeaven they hail as father, earth as mother,\\nFaithful found above them and beneath.\\n\\nSmiles may lighten tears, and tears may smother\\nSmiles, for all that joy or sorrow saith:\\nJoy nor sorrow knows not from each other\\nBirth and death.\\n\\nBENEDICTION\\n\\nBlest in death and life beyond man's guessing\\nLittle children live and die, possest\\nStill of grace that keeps them past expressing\\nBlest.\\n\\nEach least chirp that rings from every nest,\\nEach least touch of flower-soft fingers pressing\\nAught that yearns and trembles to be prest,\\n\\nEach least glance, gives gifts of grace, redressing\\nGrief's worst wrongs:  each mother's nurturing breast\\nFeeds a flower of bliss, beyond all blessing\\nBlest.\\n\\nETUDE REALISTE\\n\\nI.\\n\\nA Baby's feet, like sea-shells pink,\\nMight tempt, should heaven see meet,\\nAn angel's lips to kiss, we think,\\nA baby's feet.\\n\\nLike rose-hued sea-flowers toward the heat\\nThey stretch and spread and wink\\nTheir ten soft buds that part and meet.\\n\\nNo flower-bells that expand and shrink\\nGleam half so heavenly sweet\\nAs shine on life's untrodden brink\\nA baby's feet.\\n\\nII.\\n\\nA baby's hands, like rosebuds furled\\nWhence yet no leaf expands,\\nOpe if you touch, though close upcurled,\\nA baby's hands.\\n\\nThen, fast as warriors grip their brands\\nWhen battle's bolt is hurled,\\nThey close, clenched hard like tightening bands.\\n\\nNo rosebuds yet by dawn impearled\\nMatch, even in loveliest lands,\\nThe sweetest flowers in all the world -\\nA baby's hands.\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nA baby's eyes, ere speech begin,\\nEre lips learn words or sighs,\\nBless all things bright enough to win\\nA baby's eyes.\\n\\nLove, while the sweet thing laughs and lies,\\nAnd sleep flows out and in,\\nSees perfect in them Paradise.\\n\\nTheir glance might cast out pain and sin,\\nTheir speech make dumb the wise,\\nBy mute glad godhead felt within\\nA baby's eyes.\\n\\nBABYHOOD\\n\\nI.\\n\\nA baby shines as bright\\nIf winter or if May be\\nOn eyes that keep in sight\\nA baby.\\n\\nThough dark the skies or grey be,\\nIt fills our eyes with light,\\nIf midnight or midday be.\\n\\nLove hails it, day and night,\\nThe sweetest thing that may be\\nYet cannot praise aright\\nA baby.\\n\\nII.\\n\\nAll heaven, in every baby born,\\nAll absolute of earthly leaven,\\nReveals itself, though man may scorn\\nAll heaven.\\n\\nYet man might feel all sin forgiven,\\nAll grief appeased, all pain outworn,\\nBy this one revelation given.\\n\\nSoul, now forget thy burdens borne:\\nHeart, be thy joys now seven times seven:\\nLove shows in light more bright than morn\\nAll heaven.\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nWhat likeness may define, and stray not\\nFrom truth's exactest way,\\nA baby's beauty?  Love can say not\\nWhat likeness may.\\n\\nThe Mayflower loveliest held in May\\nOf all that shine and stay not\\nLaughs not in rosier disarray.\\n\\nSleek satin, swansdown, buds that play not\\nAs yet with winds that play,\\nWould fain be matched with this, and may not:\\nWhat likeness may?\\n\\nIV.\\n\\nRose, round whose bed\\nDawn's cloudlets close,\\nEarth's brightest-bred\\nRose!\\n\\nNo song, love knows,\\nMay praise the head\\nYour curtain shows.\\n\\nEre sleep has fled,\\nThe whole child glows\\nOne sweet live red\\nRose.\\n\\nFIRST FOOTSTEPS\\n\\nA little way, more soft and sweet\\nThan fields aflower with May,\\nA babe's feet, venturing, scarce complete\\nA little way.\\n\\nEyes full of dawning day\\nLook up for mother's eyes to meet,\\nToo blithe for song to say.\\n\\nGlad as the golden spring to greet\\nIts first live leaflet's play,\\nLove, laughing, leads the little feet\\nA little way.\\n\\nA NINTH BIRTHDAY\\nFEBRUARY 4, 1883\\n\\nI.\\n\\nThree times thrice hath winter's rough white wing\\nCrossed and curdled wells and streams with ice\\nSince his birth whose praises love would sing\\nThree times thrice.\\n\\nEarth nor sea bears flower nor pearl of price\\nFit to crown the forehead of my king,\\nHoney meet to please him, balm, nor spice.\\n\\nLove can think of nought but love to bring\\nFit to serve or do him sacrifice\\nEre his eyes have looked upon the spring\\nThree times thrice.\\n\\nII.\\n\\nThree times thrice the world has fallen on slumber,\\nShone and waned and withered in a trice,\\nFrost has fettered Thames and Tyne and Humber\\nThree times thrice,\\n\\nFogs have swoln too thick for steel to slice,\\nCloud and mud have soiled with grime and umber\\nEarth and heaven, defaced as souls with vice,\\n\\nWinds have risen to wreck, snows fallen to cumber,\\nShips and chariots, trapped like rats or mice,\\nSince my king first smiled, whose years now number\\nThree times thrice.\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nThree times thrice, in wine of song full-flowing,\\nPledge, my heart, the child whose eyes suffice,\\nOnce beheld, to set thy joy-bells going\\nThree times thrice.\\n\\nNot the lands of palm and date and rice\\nGlow more bright when summer leaves them glowing,\\nLaugh more light when suns and winds entice.\\n\\nNoon and eve and midnight and cock-crowing,\\nChild whose love makes life as paradise,\\nLove should sound your praise with clarions blowing\\nThree times thrice.\\n\\nNOT A CHILD\\n\\nI.\\n\\n'Not a child:  I call myself a boy,'\\nSays my king, with accent stern yet mild,\\nNow nine years have brought him change of joy;\\n'Not a child.'\\n\\nHow could reason be so far beguiled,\\nErr so far from sense's safe employ,\\nStray so wide of truth, or run so wild?\\n\\nSeeing his face bent over book or toy,\\nChild I called him, smiling:  but he smiled\\nBack, as one too high for vain annoy -\\nNot a child.\\n\\nII.\\n\\nNot a child? alack the year!\\nWhat should ail an undefiled\\nHeart, that he would fain appear\\nNot a child?\\n\\nMen, with years and memories piled\\nEach on other, far and near,\\nFain again would so be styled:\\n\\nFain would cast off hope and fear,\\nRest, forget, be reconciled:\\nWhy would you so fain be, dear,\\nNot a child?\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nChild or boy, my darling, which you will,\\nStill your praise finds heart and song employ,\\nHeart and song both yearning toward you still,\\nChild or boy.\\n\\nAll joys else might sooner pall or cloy\\nLove than this which inly takes its fill,\\nDear, of sight of your more perfect joy.\\n\\nNay, be aught you please, let all fulfil\\nAll your pleasure; be your world your toy:\\nMild or wild we love you, loud or still,\\nChild or boy.\\n\\nTO DORA DORIAN\\n\\nChild of two strong nations, heir\\nBorn of high-souled hope that smiled,\\nSeeing for each brought forth a fair\\nChild,\\n\\nBy thy gracious brows, and wild\\nGolden-clouded heaven of hair,\\nBy thine eyes elate and mild,\\n\\nHope would fain take heart to swear\\nMen should yet be reconciled,\\nSeeing the sign she bids thee bear,\\nChild.\\n\\nTHE ROUNDEL\\n\\nA roundel is wrought as a ring or a starbright sphere,\\nWith craft of delight and with cunning of sound unsought,\\nThat the heart of the hearer may smile if to pleasure his ear\\nA roundel is wrought.\\n\\nIts jewel of music is carven of all or of aught -\\nLove, laughter, or mourning--remembrance of rapture or fear -\\nThat fancy may fashion to hang in the ear of thought.\\n\\nAs a bird's quick song runs round, and the hearts in us hear\\nPause answer to pause, and again the same strain caught,\\nSo moves the device whence, round as a pearl or tear,\\nA roundel is wrought.\\n\\nAT SEA\\n\\n'Farewell and adieu' was the burden prevailing\\nLong since in the chant of a home-faring crew;\\nAnd the heart in us echoes, with laughing or wailing,\\nFarewell and adieu.\\n\\nEach year that we live shall we sing it anew,\\nWith a water untravelled before us for sailing\\nAnd a water behind us that wrecks may bestrew.\\n\\nThe stars of the past and the beacons are paling,\\nThe heavens and the waters are hoarier of hue:\\nBut the heart in us chants not an all unavailing\\nFarewell and adieu.\\n\\nWASTED LOVE\\n\\nWhat shall be done for sorrow\\nWith love whose race is run?\\nWhere help is none to borrow,\\nWhat shall be done?\\n\\nIn vain his hands have spun\\nThe web, or drawn the furrow:\\nNo rest their toil hath won.\\n\\nHis task is all gone thorough,\\nAnd fruit thereof is none:\\nAnd who dare say to-morrow\\nWhat shall be done?\\n\\nBEFORE SUNSET\\n\\nLove's twilight wanes in heaven above,\\nOn earth ere twilight reigns:\\nEre fear may feel the chill thereof,\\nLove's twilight wanes.\\n\\nEre yet the insatiate heart complains\\n'Too much, and scarce enough,'\\nThe lip so late athirst refrains.\\n\\nSoft on the neck of either dove\\nLove's hands let slip the reins:\\nAnd while we look for light of love\\nLove's twilight wanes.\\n\\nA SINGING LESSON\\n\\nFar-fetched and dear-bought, as the proverb rehearses,\\nIs good, or was held so, for ladies:  but nought\\nIn a song can be good if the turn of the verse is\\nFar-fetched and dear-bought.\\n\\nAs the turn of a wave should it sound, and the thought\\nRing smooth, and as light as the spray that disperses\\nBe the gleam of the words for the garb thereof wrought.\\n\\nLet the soul in it shine through the sound as it pierces\\nMen's hearts with possession of music unsought;\\nFor the bounties of song are no jealous god's mercies,\\nFar-fetched and dear-bought.\\n\\nFLOWER-PIECES\\n\\nI.--LOVE LIES BLEEDING\\n\\nLove lies bleeding in the bed whereover\\nRoses lean with smiling mouths or pleading:\\nEarth lies laughing where the sun's dart clove her:\\nLove lies bleeding.\\n\\nStately shine his purple plumes, exceeding\\nPride of princes:  nor shall maid or lover\\nFind on earth a fairer sign worth heeding.\\n\\nYet may love, sore wounded scarce recover\\nStrength and spirit again, with life receding:\\nHope and joy, wind-winged, about him hover:\\nLove lies bleeding.\\n\\nII.--LOVE IN A MIST\\n\\nLight love in a mist, by the midsummer moon misguided,\\nScarce seen in the twilight garden if gloom insist,\\nSeems vainly to seek for a star whose gleam has derided\\nLight love in a mist.\\n\\nAll day in the sun, when the breezes do all they list,\\nHis soft blue raiment of cloudlike blossom abided\\nUnrent and unwithered of winds and of rays that kissed.\\n\\nBlithe-hearted or sad, as the cloud or the sun subsided,\\nLove smiled in the flower with a meaning whereof none wist\\nSave two that beheld, as a gleam that before them glided,\\nLight love in a mist.\\n\\nTHREE FACES\\n\\nI.--VENTIMIGLIA\\n\\nThe sky and sea glared hard and bright and blank:\\nDown the one steep street, with slow steps firm and free,\\nA tall girl paced, with eyes too proud to thank\\nThe sky and sea.\\n\\nOne dead flat sapphire, void of wrath or glee,\\nThrough bay on bay shone blind from bank to bank\\nThe weary Mediterranean, drear to see.\\n\\nMore deep, more living, shone her eyes that drank\\nThe breathless light and shed again on me,\\nTill pale before their splendour waned and shrank\\nThe sky and sea.\\n\\nII.--GENOA\\n\\nAgain the same strange might of eyes, that saw\\nIn heaven and earth nought fairer, overcame\\nMy sight with rapture of reiterate awe,\\nAgain the same.\\n\\nThe self-same pulse of wonder shook like flame\\nThe spirit of sense within me:  what strange law\\nHad bid this be, for blessing or for blame?\\n\\nTo what veiled end that fate or chance foresaw\\nCame forth this second sister face, that came\\nAbsolute, perfect, fair without a flaw,\\nAgain the same?\\n\\nIII.--VENICE\\n\\nOut of the dark pure twilight, where the stream\\nFlows glimmering, streaked by many a birdlike bark\\nThat skims the gloom whence towers and bridges gleam\\nOut of the dark,\\n\\nOnce more a face no glance might choose but mark\\nShone pale and bright, with eyes whose deep slow beam\\nMade quick the twilight, lifeless else and stark.\\n\\nThe same it seemed, or mystery made it seem,\\nAs those before beholden; but St. Mark\\nRuled here the ways that showed it like a dream\\nOut of the dark.\\n\\nEROS\\n\\nI.\\n\\nEros, from rest in isles far-famed,\\nWith rising Anthesterion rose,\\nAnd all Hellenic heights acclaimed\\nEros.\\n\\nThe sea one pearl, the shore one rose,\\nAll round him all the flower-month flamed\\nAnd lightened, laughing off repose.\\n\\nEarth's heart, sublime and unashamed,\\nKnew, even perchance as man's heart knows,\\nThe thirst of all men's nature named\\nEros.\\n\\nII.\\n\\nEros, a fire of heart untamed,\\nA light of spirit in sense that glows,\\nFlamed heavenward still ere earth defamed\\nEros.\\n\\nNor fear nor shame durst curb or close\\nHis golden godhead, marred and maimed,\\nFast round with bonds that burnt and froze.\\n\\nEre evil faith struck blind and lamed\\nLove, pure as fire or flowers or snows,\\nEarth hailed as blameless and unblamed\\nEros.\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nEros, with shafts by thousands aimed\\nAt laughing lovers round in rows,\\nFades from their sight whose tongues proclaimed\\nEros.\\n\\nBut higher than transient shapes or shows\\nThe light of love in life inflamed\\nSprings, toward no goal that these disclose.\\n\\nAbove those heavens which passion claimed\\nShines, veiled by change that ebbs and flows,\\nThe soul in all things born or framed,\\nEros.\\n\\nSORROW\\n\\nSorrow, on wing through the world for ever,\\nHere and there for awhile would borrow\\nRest, if rest might haply deliver\\nSorrow.\\n\\nOne thought lies close in her heart gnawn thorough\\nWith pain, a weed in a dried-up river,\\nA rust-red share in an empty furrow.\\n\\nHearts that strain at her chain would sever\\nThe link where yesterday frets to-morrow:\\nAll things pass in the world, but never\\nSorrow.\\n\\nSLEEP\\n\\nSleep, when a soul that her own clouds cover\\nWails that sorrow should always keep\\nWatch, nor see in the gloom above her\\nSleep,\\n\\nDown, through darkness naked and steep,\\nSinks, and the gifts of his grace recover\\nSoon the soul, though her wound be deep.\\n\\nGod beloved of us, all men's lover,\\nAll most weary that smile or weep\\nFeel thee afar or anear them hover,\\nSleep.\\n\\nON AN OLD ROUNDEL\\nTRANSLATED BY D.

ROSSETTI FROM THE FRENCH OF VILLON\\n\\nI.\\n\\nDeath, from thy rigour a voice appealed,\\nAnd men still hear what the sweet cry saith,\\nCrying aloud in thine ears fast sealed,\\nDeath.\\n\\nAs a voice in a vision that vanisheth,\\nThrough the grave's gate barred and the portal steeled\\nThe sound of the wail of it travelleth.\\n\\nWailing aloud from a heart unhealed,\\nIt woke response of melodious breath\\nFrom lips now too by thy kiss congealed,\\nDeath\\n\\nII.\\n\\nAges ago, from the lips of a sad glad poet\\nWhose soul was a wild dove lost in the whirling snow,\\nThe soft keen plaint of his pain took voice to show it\\nAges ago.\\n\\nSo clear, so deep, the divine drear accents flow,\\nNo soul that listens may choose but thrill to know it,\\nPierced and wrung by the passionate music's throe.\\n\\nFor us there murmurs a nearer voice below it,\\nKnown once of ears that never again shall know,\\nNow mute as the mouth which felt death's wave o'erflow it\\nAges ago.\\n\\nA LANDSCAPE BY COURBET\\n\\nLow lies the mere beneath the moorside, still\\nAnd glad of silence:  down the wood sweeps clear\\nTo the utmost verge where fed with many a rill\\nLow lies the mere.\\n\\nThe wind speaks only summer:  eye nor ear\\nSees aught at all of dark, hears aught of shrill,\\nFrom sound or shadow felt or fancied here.\\n\\nStrange, as we praise the dead man's might and skill,\\nStrange that harsh thoughts should make such heavy cheer,\\nWhile, clothed with peace by heaven's most gentle will,\\nLow lies the mere.\\n\\nA FLOWER-PIECE BY FANTIN\\n\\nHeart's ease or pansy, pleasure or thought,\\nWhich would the picture give us of these?\\nSurely the heart that conceived it sought\\nHeart's ease.\\n\\nSurely by glad and divine degrees\\nThe heart impelling the hand that wrought\\nWrought comfort here for a soul's disease.\\n\\nDeep flowers, with lustre and darkness fraught,\\nFrom glass that gleams as the chill still seas\\nLean and lend for a heart distraught\\nHeart's ease.\\n\\nA NIGHT-PIECE BY MILLET\\n\\nWind and sea and cloud and cloud-forsaking\\nMirth of moonlight where the storm leaves free\\nHeaven awhile, for all the wrath of waking\\nWind and sea.\\n\\nBright with glad mad rapture, fierce with glee,\\nLaughs the moon, borne on past cloud's o'ertaking\\nFast, it seems, as wind or sail can flee.\\n\\nOne blown sail beneath her, hardly making\\nForth, wild-winged for harbourage yet to be,\\nStrives and leaps and pants beneath the breaking\\nWind and sea.\\n\\n'MARZO PAZZO'\\n\\nMad March, with the wind in his wings wide-spread,\\nLeaps from heaven, and the deep dawn's arch\\nHails re-risen again from the dead\\nMad March.\\n\\nSoft small flames on rowan and larch\\nBreak forth as laughter on lips that said\\nNought till the pulse in them beat love's march.\\n\\nBut the heartbeat now in the lips rose-red\\nSpeaks life to the world, and the winds that parch\\nBring April forth as a bride to wed\\nMad March.\\n\\nDEAD LOVE\\n\\nDead love, by treason slain, lies stark,\\nWhite as a dead stark-stricken dove:\\nNone that pass by him pause to mark\\nDead love.\\n\\nHis heart, that strained and yearned and strove\\nAs toward the sundawn strives the lark,\\nIs cold as all the old joy thereof.\\n\\nDead men, re-risen from dust, may hark\\nWhen rings the trumpet blown above:\\nIt will not raise from out the dark\\nDead love.\\n\\nDISCORD\\n\\nUnreconciled by life's fleet years, that fled\\nWith changeful clang of pinions wide and wild,\\nThough two great spirits had lived, and hence had sped\\nUnreconciled;\\n\\nThough time and change, harsh time's imperious child,\\nThat wed strange hands together, might not wed\\nHigh hearts by hope's misprision once beguiled;\\n\\nFaith, by the light from either's memory shed,\\nSees, radiant as their ends were undefiled,\\nOne goal for each--not twain among the dead\\nUnreconciled.\\n\\nCONCORD\\n\\nReconciled by death's mild hand, that giving\\nPeace gives wisdom, not more strong than mild,\\nLove beholds them, each without misgiving\\nReconciled.\\n\\nEach on earth alike of earth reviled,\\nHated, feared, derided, and forgiving,\\nEach alike had heaven at heart, and smiled.\\n\\nBoth bright names, clothed round with man's thanksgiving,\\nShine, twin stars above the storm-drifts piled,\\nDead and deathless, whom we saw not living\\nReconciled.\\n\\nMOURNING\\n\\nAlas my brother! the cry of the mourners of old\\nThat cried on each other,\\nAll crying aloud on the dead as the death-note rolled,\\nAlas my brother!\\n\\nAs flashes of dawn that mists from an east wind smother\\nWith fold upon fold,\\nThe past years gleam that linked us one with another.\\n\\nTime sunders hearts as of brethren whose eyes behold\\nNo more their mother:\\nBut a cry sounds yet from the shrine whose fires wax cold,\\nAlas my brother!\\n\\nAPEROTOS EROS\\n\\nStrong as death, and cruel as the grave,\\nClothed with cloud and tempest's blackening breath,\\nKnown of death's dread self, whom none outbrave,\\nStrong as death,\\n\\nLove, brow-bound with anguish for a wreath,\\nFierce with pain, a tyrant-hearted slave,\\nBurns above a world that groans beneath.\\n\\nHath not pity power on thee to save,\\nLove? hath power no pity?
