"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Joseph reflected, then replied, \\\"My wife and a friend with his family, from Beth-Dagon, a little town over by Joppa; in all, six of us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well. You shall not lie out on the ridge. Bring your people, and hasten; for, when the sun goes down behind the mountain, you know the night comes quickly, and it is nearly there now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I give you the blessing of the houseless traveller; that of the sojourner will follow.\\\"\\n\\nSo saying, the Nazarene went back joyfully to Mary and the Beth-Dagonite. In a little while the latter brought up his family, the women mounted on donkeys. The wife was matronly, the daughters were images of what she must have been in youth; and as they drew nigh the door, the keeper knew them to be of the humble class.\\n\\n\\\"This is she of whom I spoke,\\\" said the Nazarene; \\\"and these are our friends.\\\"\\n\\nMary's veil was raised.\\n\\n\\\"Blue eyes and hair of gold,\\\" muttered the steward to himself, seeing but her. \\\"So looked the young king when he went to sing before Saul.\\\"\\n\\nThen he took the leading-strap from Joseph, and said to Mary, \\\"Peace to you, O daughter of David!\\\" Then to the others, \\\"Peace to you all!\\\" Then to Joseph, \\\"Rabbi, follow me.\\\"\\n\\nThe party were conducted into a wide passage paved with stone, from which they entered the court of the khan. To a stranger the scene would have been curious; but they noticed the lewens that yawned darkly upon them from all sides, and the court itself, only to remark how crowded they were. By a lane reserved in the stowage of the cargoes, and thence by a passage similar to the one at the entrance, they emerged into the enclosure adjoining the house, and came upon camels, horses, and donkeys, tethered and dozing in close groups; among them were the keepers, men of many lands; and they, too, slept or kept silent watch. They went down the slope of the crowded yard slowly, for the dull carriers of the women had wills of their own. At length they turned into a path running towards the gray limestone bluff overlooking the khan on the west.\\n\\n\\\"We are going to the cave,\\\" said Joseph, laconically.\\n\\nThe guide lingered till Mary came to his side.\\n\\n\\\"The cave to which we are going,\\\" he said to her, \\\"must have been a resort of your ancestor David. From the field below us, and from the well down in the valley, he used to drive his flocks to it for safety; and afterwards, when he was king, he came back to the old house here for rest and health, bringing great trains of animals. The mangers yet remain as they were in his day. Better a bed on the floor where he has slept than one in the court-yard or out by the roadside. Ah, here is the house before the cave!\\\"\\n\\nThis speech must not be taken as an apology for the lodging offered. There was no need of apology. The place was the best then at disposal. The guests were simple folks, by habits of life easily satisfied. To the Jew of that period, moreover, abode in caverns was a familiar idea, made so by every-day occurrences, and by what he heard of Sabbaths in the synagogues. How much of Jewish history, how many of the many exciting incidents in that history, had transpired in caves! Yet further, these people were Jews of Bethlehem, with whom the idea was especially commonplace; for their locality abounded with caves great and small, some of which had been dwelling-places from the time of the Emim and Horites. No more was there offence to them in the fact that the cavern to which they were being taken had been, or was, a stable. They were the descendants of a race of herdsmen, whose flocks habitually shared both their habitations and wanderings. In keeping with a custom derived from Abraham, the tent of the Bedawin yet shelters his horses and children alike. So they obeyed the keeper cheerfully, and gazed at the house, feeling only a natural curiosity. Everything associated with the history of David was interesting to them.\\n\\nThe building was low and narrow, projecting but a little from the rock to which it was joined at the rear, and wholly without a window. In its blank front there was a door, swung on enormous hinges, and thickly daubed with ochreous clay. While the wooden bolt of the lock was being pushed back, the women were assisted from their pillions.  Upon the opening of the door, the keeper called out,\\n\\n\\\"Come in!\\\"\\n\\nThe guests entered, and stared about them. It became apparent immediately that the house was but a mask or covering for the mouth of a natural cave or grotto, probably forty feet long, nine or ten high, and twelve or fifteen in width. The light streamed through the doorway, over an uneven floor, falling upon piles of grain and fodder, and earthenware and household property, occupying the centre of the chamber. Along the sides were mangers, low enough for sheep, and built of stones laid in cement. There were no stalls or partitions of any kind. Dust and chaff yellowed the floor, filled all the crevices and hollows, and thickened the spider-webs, which dropped from the ceiling like bits of dirty linen; otherwise the place was cleanly, and, to appearance, as comfortable as any of the arched lewens of the khan proper. In fact, a cave was the model and first suggestion of the lewen.\\n\\n\\\"Come in!\\\" said the guide. \\\"These piles upon the floor are for travellers like yourselves. Take what of them you need.\\\"\\n\\nThen he spoke to Mary.\\n\\n\\\"Can you rest here?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The place is sanctified,\\\" she answered.\\n\\n\\\"I leave you then. Peace be with you all!\\\"\\n\\nWhen he was gone, they busied themselves making the cave habitable.\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\nAt a certain hour in the evening the shouting and stir of the people in and about the khan ceased; at the same time, every Israelite, if not already upon his feet, arose, solemnized his face, looked towards Jerusalem, crossed his hands upon his breast, and prayed; for it was the sacred ninth hour, when sacrifices were offered in the temple on Moriah, and God was supposed to be there. When the hands of the worshippers fell down, the commotion broke forth again; everybody hastened to bread, or to make his pallet. A little later, the lights were put out, and there was silence, and then sleep.\\n\\n\\n******\\n\\nAbout midnight some one on the roof cried out, \\\"What light is that in the sky? Awake, brethren, awake and see!\\\"\\n\\nThe people, half asleep, sat up and looked; then they became wide-awake, though wonder-struck. And the stir spread to the court below, and into the lewens; soon the entire tenantry of the house and court and enclosure were out gazing at the sky.\\n\\nAnd this was what they saw. A ray of light, beginning at a height immeasurably beyond the nearest stars, and dropping obliquely to the earth; at its top, a diminishing point; at its base, many furlongs in width; its sides blending softly with the darkness of the night, its core a roseate electrical splendor. The apparition seemed to rest on the nearest mountain southeast of the town, making a pale corona along the line of the summit. The khan was touched luminously, so that those upon the roof saw each other's faces, all filled with wonder.\\n\\nSteadily, through minutes, the ray lingered, and then the wonder changed to awe and fear; the timid trembled; the boldest spoke in whispers.\\n\\n\\\"Saw you ever the like?\\\" asked one.\\n\\n\\\"It seems just over the mountain there. I cannot tell what it is, nor did I ever see anything like it,\\\" was the answer.\\n\\n\\\"Can it be that a star has burst and fallen?\\\" asked another, his tongue faltering.\\n\\n\\\"When a star falls, its light goes out.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have it!\\\" cried one, confidently. \\\"The shepherds have seen a lion, and made fires to keep him from the flocks.\\\"\\n\\nThe men next the speaker drew a breath of relief, and said, \\\"Yes, that is it! The flocks were grazing in the valley over there to-day.\\\"\\n\\nA bystander dispelled the comfort.\\n\\n\\\"No, no! Though all the wood in all the valleys of Judah was brought together in one pile and fired, the blaze would not throw a light so strong and high.\\\"\\n\\nAfter that there was silence on the house-top, broken but once again while the mystery continued.\\n\\n\\\"Brethren!\\\" exclaimed a Jew of venerable mien, \\\"what we see is the ladder our father Jacob saw in his dream. Blessed be the Lord God of our fathers!\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\nA mile and a half, it may be two miles, southeast of Bethlehem, there is a plain separated from the town by an intervening swell of the mountain. Besides being well sheltered from the north winds, the vale was covered with a growth of sycamore, dwarf-oak, and pine trees, while in the glens and ravines adjoining there were thickets of olive and mulberry; all at this season of the year invaluable for the support of sheep, goats, and cattle, of which the wandering flocks consisted.\\n\\nAt the side farthest from the town, close under a bluff, there was an extensive marah, or sheepcot, ages old. In some long-forgotten foray, the building had been unroofed and almost demolished. The enclosure attached to it remained intact, however, and that was of more importance to the shepherds who drove their charges thither than the house itself. The stone wall around the lot was high as a man's head, yet not so high but that sometimes a panther or a lion, hungering from the wilderness, leaped boldly in. On the inner side of the wall, and as an additional security against the constant danger, a hedge of the rhamnus had been planted, an invention so successful that now a sparrow could hardly penetrate the overtopping branches, armed as they were with great clusters of thorns hard as spikes.\\n\\nThe day of the occurrences which occupy the preceding chapters, a number of shepherds, seeking fresh walks for their flocks, led them up to this plain; and from early morning the groves had been made ring with calls, and the blows of axes, the bleating of sheep and goats, the tinkling of bells, the lowing of cattle, and the barking of dogs. When the sun went down, they led the way to the marah, and by nightfall had everything safe in the field; then they kindled a fire down by the gate, partook of their humble supper, and sat down to rest and talk, leaving one on watch.\\n\\nThere were six of these men, omitting the watchman; and afterwhile they assembled in a group near the fire, some sitting, some lying prone. As they went bareheaded habitually, their hair stood out in thick, coarse, sunburnt shocks; their beard covered their throats, and fell in mats down the breast; mantles of the skin of kids and lambs, with the fleece on, wrapped them from neck to knee, leaving the arms exposed; broad belts girthed the rude garments to their waists; their sandals were of the coarsest quality; from their right shoulders hung scrips containing food and selected stones for slings, with which they were armed; on the ground near each one lay his crook, a symbol of his calling and a weapon of offence.\\n\\nSuch were the shepherds of Judea! In appearance, rough and savage as the gaunt dogs sitting with them around the blaze; in fact, simple-minded, tender-hearted; effects due, in part, to the primitive life they led, but chiefly to their constant care of things lovable and helpless.\\n\\nThey rested and talked, and their talk was all about their flocks, a dull theme to the world, yet a theme which was all the world to them. If in narrative they dwelt long upon affairs of trifling moment; if one of them omitted nothing of detail in recounting the loss of a lamb, the relation between him and the unfortunate should be remembered: at birth it became his charge, his to keep all its days, to help over the floods, to carry down the hollows, to name and train; it was to be his companion, his object of thought and interest, the subject of his will; it was to enliven and share his wanderings; in its defense he might be called on to face the lion or robber--to die.\\n\\nThe great events, such as blotted out nations and changed the mastery of the world, were trifles to them, if perchance they came to their knowledge. Of what Herod was doing in this city or that, building palaces and gymnasia, and indulging forbidden practises, they occasionally heard. As was her habit in those days, Rome did not wait for people slow to inquire about her; she came to them. Over the hills along which he was leading his lagging herd, or in the fastnesses in which he was hiding them, not unfrequently the shepherd was startled by the blare of trumpets, and, peering out, beheld a cohort, sometimes a legion, in march; and when the glittering crests were gone, and the excitement incident to the intrusion over, he bent himself to evolve the meaning of the eagles and gilded globes of the soldiery, and the charm of a life so the opposite of his own.\\n\\nYet these men, rude and simple as they were, had a knowledge and a wisdom of their own. On Sabbaths they were accustomed to purify themselves, and go up into the synagogues, and sit on the benches farthest from the ark. When the chazzan bore the Torah round, none kissed it with greater zest; when the sheliach read the text, none listened to the interpreter with more absolute faith; and none took away with them more of the elder's sermon, or gave it more thought afterwards. In a verse of the Shema they found all the learning and all the law of their simple lives--that their Lord was One God, and that they must love him with all their souls. And they loved him, and such was their wisdom, surpassing that of kings.\\n\\nWhile they talked, and before the first watch was over, one by one the shepherds went to sleep, each lying where he had sat.\\n\\nThe night, like most nights of the winter season in the hill country, was clear, crisp, and sparkling with stars. There was no wind. The atmosphere seemed never so pure, and the stillness was more than silence; it was a holy hush, a warning that heaven was stooping low to whisper some good thing to the listening earth.\\n\\nBy the gate, hugging his mantle close, the watchman walked; at times he stopped, attracted by a stir among the sleeping herds, or by a jackal's cry off on the mountain-side. The midnight was slow coming to him; but at last it came. His task was done; now for the dreamless sleep with which labor blesses its wearied children! He moved towards the fire, but paused; a light was breaking around him, soft and white, like the moon's. He waited breathlessly. The light deepened; things before invisible came to view; he saw the whole field, and all it sheltered. A chill sharper than that of the frosty air--a chill of fear--smote him. He looked up; the stars were gone; the light was dropping as from a window in the sky; as he looked, it became a splendor; then, in terror, he cried,\\n\\n\\\"Awake, awake!\\\"\\n\\nUp sprang the dogs, and, howling, ran away.\\n\\nThe herds rushed together bewildered.\\n\\nThe men clambered to their feet, weapons in hand.\\n\\n\\\"What is it?\\\" they asked, in one voice.\\n\\n\\\"See!\\\" cried the watchman, \\\"the sky is on fire!\\\"\\n\\nSuddenly the light became intolerably bright, and they covered their eyes, and dropped upon their knees; then, as their souls shrank with fear, they fell upon their faces blind and fainting, and would have died had not a voice said to them,\\n\\n\\\"Fear not!\\\"\\n\\nAnd they listened.\\n\\n\\\"Fear not: for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.\\\"\\n\\nThe voice, in sweetness and soothing more than human, and low and clear, penetrated all their being, and filled them with assurance. They rose upon their knees, and, looking worshipfully, beheld in the centre of a great glory the appearance of a man, clad in a robe intensely white; above its shoulders towered the tops of wings shining and folded; a star over its forehead glowed with steady lustre, brilliant as Hesperus; its hands were stretched towards them in blessing; its face was serene and divinely beautiful.\\n\\nThey had often heard, and, in their simple way, talked, of angels; and they doubted not now, but said, in their hearts, The glory of God is about us, and this is he who of old came to the prophet by the river of Ulai.\\n\\nDirectly the angel continued:\\n\\n\\\"For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Savior, which is Christ the Lord!\\\"\\n\\nAgain there was a rest, while the words sank into their minds.\\n\\n\\\"And this shall be a sign unto you,\\\" the annunciator said next. \\\"Ye shall find the babe, wrapped in swaddling-clothes, lying in a manger.\\\"\\n\\nThe herald spoke not again; his good tidings were told; yet he stayed awhile. Suddenly the light, of which he seemed the centre, turned roseate and began to tremble; then up, far as the men could see, there was flashing of white wings, and coming and going of radiant forms, and voices as of a multitude chanting in unison,\\n\\n\\\"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will towards men!\\\"\\n\\nNot once the praise, but many times.\\n\\nThen the herald raised his eyes as seeking approval of one far off; his wings stirred, and spread slowly and majestically, on their upper side white as snow, in the shadow vari-tinted, like mother-of-pearl; when they were expanded many cubits beyond his stature, he arose lightly, and, without effort, floated out of view, taking the light up with him. Long after he was gone, down from the sky fell the refrain in measure mellowed by distance, \\\"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will towards men.\\\"\\n\\nWhen the shepherds came fully to their senses, they stared at each other stupidly, until one of them said, \\\"It was Gabriel, the Lord's messenger unto men.\\\"\\n\\nNone answered.\\n\\n\\\"Christ the Lord is born; said he not so?\\\"\\n\\nThen another recovered his voice, and replied, \\\"That is what he said.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And did he not also say, in the city of David, which is our Bethlehem yonder. And that we should find him a babe in swaddling-clothes?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And lying in a manger.\\\"\\n\\nThe first speaker gazed into the fire thoughtfully, but at length said, like one possessed of a sudden resolve, \\\"There is but one place in Bethlehem where there are mangers; but one, and that is in the cave near the old khan. Brethren, let us go see this thing which has come to pass. The priests and doctors have been a long time looking for the Christ. Now he is born, and the Lord has given us a sign by which to know him. Let us go up and worship him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But the flocks!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Lord will take care of them. Let us make haste.\\\"\\n\\nThen they all arose and left the marah.\\n\\n\\n******\\n\\nAround the mountain and through the town they passed, and came to the gate of the khan, where there was a man on watch.\\n\\n\\\"What would you have?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\\"We have seen and heard great things to-night,\\\" they replied.\\n\\n\\\"Well, we, too, have seen great things, but heard nothing. What did you hear?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let us go down to the cave in the enclosure, that we may be sure; then we will tell you all. Come with us, and see for yourself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is a fool's errand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, the Christ is born.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Christ! How do you know?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let us go and see first.\\\"\\n\\nThe man laughed scornfully.\\n\\n\\\"The Christ indeed! How are you to know him?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He was born this night, and is now lying in a manger, so we were told; and there is but one place in Bethlehem with mangers.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The cave?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. Come with us.\\\"\\n\\nThey went through the court-yard without notice, although there were some up even then talking about the wonderful light. The door of the cavern was open. A lantern was burning within, and they entered unceremoniously.\\n\\n\\\"I give you peace,\\\" the watchman said to Joseph and the Beth Dagonite. \\\"Here are people looking for a child born this night, whom they are to know by finding him in swaddling-clothes and lying in a manger.\\\"\\n\\nFor a moment the face of the stolid Nazarene was moved; turning away, he said, \\\"The child is here.\\\"\\n\\nThey were led to one of the mangers, and there the child was. The lantern was brought, and the shepherds stood by mute. The little one made no sign; it was as others just born.\\n\\n\\\"Where is the mother?\\\" asked the watchman.\\n\\nOne of the women took the baby, and went to Mary, lying near, and put it in her arms. Then the bystanders collected about the two.\\n\\n\\\"It is the Christ!\\\" said a shepherd, at last.\\n\\n\\\"The Christ!\\\" they all repeated, falling upon their knees in worship. One of them repeated several times over,\\n\\n\\\"It is the Lord, and his glory is above the earth and heaven.\\\"\\n\\nAnd the simple men, never doubting, kissed the hem of the mother's robe, and with joyful faces departed. In the khan, to all the people aroused and pressing about them, they told their story; and through the town, and all the way back to the marah, they chanted the refrain of the angels, \\\"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will towards men!\\\"\\n\\nThe story went abroad, confirmed by the light so generally seen; and the next day, and for days thereafter, the cave was visited by curious crowds, of whom some believed, though the greater part laughed and mocked.\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\nThe eleventh day after the birth of the child in the cave, about mid-afternoon, the three wise men approached Jerusalem by the road from Shechem. After crossing Brook Cedron, they met many people, of whom none failed to stop and look after them curiously.\\n\\nJudea was of necessity an international thoroughfare; a narrow ridge, raised, apparently, by the pressure of the desert on the east, and the sea on the west, was all she could claim to be; over the ridge, however, nature had stretched the line of trade between the east and the south; and that was her wealth. In other words, the riches of Jerusalem were the tolls she levied on passing commerce. Nowhere else, consequently, unless in Rome, was there such constant assemblage of so many people of so many different nations; in no other city was a stranger less strange to the residents than within her walls and purlieus. And yet these three men excited the wonder of all whom they met on the way to the gates.\\n\\nA child belonging to some women sitting by the roadside opposite the Tombs of the Kings saw the party coming; immediately it clapped its hands, and cried, \\\"Look, look! What pretty bells! What big camels!\\\"\\n\\nThe bells were silver; the camels, as we have seen, were of unusual size and whiteness, and moved with singular stateliness; the trappings told of the desert and of long journeys thereon, and also of ample means in possession of the owners, who sat under the little canopies exactly as they appeared at the rendezvous beyond the Jebel. Yet it was not the bells or the camels, or their furniture, or the demeanor of the riders, that were so wonderful; it was the question put by the man who rode foremost of the three.\\n\\nThe approach to Jerusalem from the north is across a plain which dips southward, leaving the Damascus Gate in a vale or hollow. The road is narrow, but deeply cut by long use, and in places difficult on account of the cobbles left loose and dry by the washing of the rains. On either side, however, there stretched, in the old time, rich fields and handsome olive-groves, which must, in luxurious growth, have been beautiful, especially to travellers fresh from the wastes of the desert. In this road, the three stopped before the party in front of the Tombs.\\n\\n\\\"Good people,\\\" said Balthasar, stroking his plaited beard, and bending from his cot, \\\"is not Jerusalem close by?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" answered the woman into whose arms the child had shrunk. \\\"If the trees on yon swell were a little lower you could see the towers on the market-place.\\\"\\n\\nBalthasar gave the Greek and the Hindoo a look, then asked,\\n\\n\\\"Where is he that is born King of the Jews?\\\"\\n\\nThe women gazed at each other without reply.\\n\\n\\\"You have not heard of him?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, tell everybody that we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.\\\"\\n\\nThereupon the friends rode on. Of others they asked the same question, with like result. A large company whom they met going to the Grotto of Jeremiah were so astonished by the inquiry and the appearance of the travellers that they turned about and followed them into the city.\\n\\nSo much were the three occupied with the idea of their mission that they did not care for the view which presently rose before them in the utmost magnificence: for the village first to receive them on Bezetha; for Mizpah and Olivet, over on their left; for the wall behind the village, with its forty tall and solid towers, superadded partly for strength, partly to gratify the critical taste of the kingly builder; for the same towered wall bending off to the right, with many an angle, and here and there an embattled gate, up to the three great white piles Phasaelus, Mariamne, and Hippicus; for Zion, tallest of the hills, crowned with marble palaces, and never so beautiful; for the glittering terraces of the temple on Moriah, admittedly one of the wonders of the earth; for the regal mountains rimming the sacred city round about until it seemed in the hollow of a mighty bowl.\\n\\nThey came, at length, to a tower of great height and strength, overlooking the gate which, at that time, answered to the present Damascus Gate, and marked the meeting-place of the three roads from Shechem, Jericho, and Gibeon. A Roman guard kept the passage-way. By this time the people following the camels formed a train sufficient to draw the idlers hanging about the portal; so that when Balthasar stopped to speak to the sentinel, the three became instantly the centre of a close circle eager to hear all that passed.\\n\\n\\\"I give you peace,\\\" the Egyptian said, in a clear voice.\\n\\nThe sentinel made no reply.\\n\\n\\\"We have come great distances in search of one who is born King of the Jews. Can you tell us where he is?\\\"\\n\\nThe soldier raised the visor of his helmet, and called loudly. From an apartment at the right of the passage an officer appeared.\\n\\n\\\"Give way,\\\" he cried, to the crowd which now pressed closer in; and as they seemed slow to obey, he advanced twirling his javelin vigorously, now right, now left; and so he gained room.\\n\\n\\\"What would you?\\\" he asked of Balthasar, speaking in the idiom of the city.\\n\\nAnd Balthasar answered in the same,\\n\\n\\\"Where is he that is born King of the Jews?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Herod?\\\" asked the officer, confounded.\\n\\n\\\"Herod's kingship is from Caesar; not Herod.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is no other King of the Jews.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But we have seen the star of him we seek, and come to worship him.\\\"\\n\\nThe Roman was perplexed.\\n\\n\\\"Go farther,\\\" he said, at last. \\\"Go farther. I am not a Jew. Carry the question to the doctors in the Temple, or to Hannas the priest, or, better still, to Herod himself. If there be another King of the Jews, he will find him.\\\"\\n\\nThereupon he made way for the strangers, and they passed the gate. But, before entering the narrow street, Balthasar lingered to say to his friends, \\\"We are sufficiently proclaimed. By midnight the whole city will have heard of us and of our mission. Let us to the khan now.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\nThat evening, before sunset, some women were washing clothes on the upper step of the flight that led down into the basin of the Pool of Siloam. They knelt each before a broad bowl of earthenware. A girl at the foot of the steps kept them supplied with water, and sang while she filled the jar. The song was cheerful, and no doubt lightened their labor. Occasionally they would sit upon their heels, and look up the slope of Ophel, and round to the summit of what is now the Mount of Offence, then faintly glorified by the dying sun.\\n\\nWhile they plied their hands, rubbing and wringing the clothes in the bowls, two other women came to them, each with an empty jar upon her shoulder.\\n\\n\\\"Peace to you,\\\" one of the new-comers said.\\n\\nThe laborers paused, sat up, wrung the water from their hands, and returned the salutation.\\n\\n\\\"It is nearly night--time to quit.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is no end to work,\\\" was the reply.\\n\\n\\\"But there is a time to rest, and--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To hear what may be passing,\\\" interposed another.\\n\\n\\\"What news have you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then you have not heard?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They say the Christ is born,\\\" said the newsmonger, plunging into her story.\\n\\nIt was curious to see the faces of the laborers brighten with interest; on the other side down came the jars, which, in a moment, were turned into seats for their owners.\\n\\n\\\"The Christ!\\\" the listeners cried.\\n\\n\\\"So they say.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Everybody; it is common talk.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Does anybody believe it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This afternoon three men came across Brook Cedron on the road from Shechem,\\\" the speaker replied, circumstantially, intending to smother doubt. \\\"Each one of them rode a camel spotless white, and larger than any ever before seen in Jerusalem.\\\"\\n\\nThe eyes and mouths of the auditors opened wide.\\n\\n\\\"To prove how great and rich the men were,\\\" the narrator continued, \\\"they sat under awnings of silk; the buckles of their saddles were of gold, as was the fringe of their bridles; the bells were of silver, and made real music. Nobody knew them; they looked as if they had come from the ends of the world. Only one of them spoke, and of everybody on the road, even the women and children, he asked this question--'Where is he that is born King of the Jews?' No one gave them answer--no one understood what they meant; so they passed on, leaving behind them this saying: 'For we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.' They put the question to the Roman at the gate; and he, no wiser than the simple people on the road, sent them up to Herod.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where are they now?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"At the khan. Hundreds have been to look at them already, and hundreds more are going.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who are they?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nobody knows. They are said to be Persians--wise men who talk with the stars--prophets, it may be, like Elijah and Jeremiah.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do they mean by King of the Jews?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Christ, and that he is just born.\\\"\\n\\nOne of the women laughed, and resumed her work, saying, 'Well, when I see him I will believe.\\\"\\n\\nAnother followed her example: \\\"And I--well, when I see him raise the dead, I will believe.\\\"\\n\\nA third said, quietly, \\\"He has been a long time promised. It will be enough for me to see him heal one leper.\\\"\\n\\nAnd the party sat talking until the night came, and, with the help of the frosty air, drove them home.\\n\\n\\n******\\n\\nLater in the evening, about the beginning of the first watch, there was an assemblage in the palace on Mount Zion, of probably fifty persons, who never came together except by order of Herod, and then only when he had demanded to know some one or more of the deeper mysteries of the Jewish law and history. It was, in short, a meeting of the teachers of the colleges, of the chief priests, and of the doctors most noted in the city for learning--the leaders of opinion, expounders of the different creeds; princes of the Sadducees; Pharisaic debaters; calm, soft-spoken, stoical philosophers of the Essene socialists.\\n\\nThe chamber in which the session was held belonged to one of the interior court-yards of the palace, and was quite large and Romanesque. The floor was tessellated with marble blocks; the walls, unbroken by a window, were frescoed in panels of saffron yellow; a divan occupied the centre of the apartment, covered with cushions of bright-yellow cloth, and fashioned in form of the letter U, the opening towards the doorway; in the arch of the divan, or, as it were, in the bend of the letter, there was an immense bronze tripod, curiously inlaid with gold and silver, over which a chandelier dropped from the ceiling, having seven arms, each holding a lighted lamp. The divan and the lamp were purely Jewish.\\n\\nThe company sat upon the divan after the style of Orientals, in costume singularly uniform, except as to color. They were mostly men advanced in years; immense beards covered their faces; to their large noses were added the effects of large black eyes, deeply shaded by bold brows; their demeanor was grave, dignified, even patriarchal. In brief, their session was that of the Sanhedrim.\\n\\nHe who sat before the tripod, however, in the place which may be called the head of the divan, having all the rest of his associates on his right and left, and, at the same time, before him, evidently president of the meeting, would have instantly absorbed the attention of a spectator. He had been cast in large mould, but was now shrunken and stooped to ghastliness; his white robe dropped from his shoulders in folds that gave no hint of muscle or anything but an angular skeleton. His hands, half concealed by sleeves of silk, white and crimson striped, were clasped upon his knees. When he spoke, sometimes the first finger of the right hand extended tremulously; he seemed incapable of other gesture. But his head was a splendid dome. A few hairs, whiter than fine-drawn silver, fringed the base; over a broad, full-sphered skull the skin was drawn close, and shone in the light with positive brilliance; the temples were deep hollows, from which the forehead beetled like a wrinkled crag; the eyes were wan and dim; the nose was pinched; and all the lower face was muffed in a beard flowing and venerable as Aaron's. Such was Hillel the Babylonian! The line of prophets, long extinct in Israel, was now succeeded by a line of scholars, of whom he was first in learning--a prophet in all but the divine inspiration! At the age of one hundred and six, he was still Rector of the Great College.\\n\\nOn the table before him lay outspread a roll or volume of parchment inscribed with Hebrew characters; behind him, in waiting, stood a page richly habited.\\n\\nThere had been discussion, but at this moment of introduction the company had reached a conclusion; each one was in an attitude of rest, and the venerable Hillel, without moving, called the page.\\n\\n\\\"Hist!\\\"\\n\\nThe youth advanced respectfully.\\n\\n\\\"Go tell the king we are ready to give him answer.\\\"\\n\\nThe boy hurried away.\\n\\nAfter a time two officers entered and stopped, one on each side the door; after them slowly followed a most striking personage-- an old man clad in a purple robe bordered with scarlet, and girt to his waist by a band of gold linked so fine that it was pliable as leather; the latchets of his shoes sparkled with precious stones; a narrow crown wrought in filigree shone outside a tarbooshe of softest crimson plush, which, encasing his head, fell down the neck and shoulders, leaving the throat and neck exposed. Instead of a seal, a dagger dangled from his belt. He walked with a halting step, leaning heavily upon a staff. Not until he reached the opening of the divan, did he pause or look up from the floor; then, as for the first time conscious of the company, and roused by their presence, he raised himself, and looked haughtily round, like one startled and searching for an enemy--so dark, suspicious, and threatening was the glance. Such was Herod the Great--a body broken by diseases, a conscience seared with crimes, a mind magnificently capable, a soul fit for brotherhood with the Caesars; now seven-and-sixty years old, but guarding his throne with a jealousy never so vigilant, a power never so despotic, and a cruelty never so inexorable.\\n\\nThere was a general movement on the part of the assemblage--a bending forward in salaam by the more aged, a rising-up by the more courtierly, followed by low genuflections, hands upon the beard or breast.\\n\\nHis observations taken, Herod moved on until at the tripod opposite the venerable Hillel, who met his cold glance with an inclination of the head, and a slight lifting of the hands.\",\"timestamp\":1640142507,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"If I cannot make room for you,\\\" he said, \\\"I cannot turn you away.
