"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"He knew why. Encouraged by his former observation of her, she had scented a client in him and had been deceived, and this deception had bred within her an acrid hatred of him. To-night he would chase away that hatred. For he meant to speak to her. The old woman looked away from him, holding her head down as if in cold disdain. Artois read easily what was passing in her mind. She believed him wicked, but nervous in his wickedness, desirous of her services but afraid to invite them. And she held him in the uttermost contempt. Well, to-night he would undeceive her on one point at least. He kept his eyes upon her so firmly that she looked at him again. This time he made a sign of recognition, of understanding. She stared as if in suspicious amazement. He glanced towards the dome, then at her once more. At this moment the waiter came up. Artois paid his bill slowly and ostentatiously. As he counted out the money upon the little tray he looked up once, and saw the eyes in the long, pale face of the venerable temptress glitter while they watched. The music ceased, the crowd before the platform broke up, and began quickly to melt away. Only the woman waited, holding her little bag and her cheap Japanese fan.\\n\\nArtois drew out a cigar, lit it slowly, then got up, and began to move out among the tables.\\n\\nThe priest looked after him, spoke rapidly to his companions, and burst into a throaty laugh which was loudly echoed.\\n\\n\\\"Maria Fortunata is in luck to-night!\\\" said some one.\\n\\nThen the band began again, the waiter came with more ices, and the tall, long-bearded forestiere was forgotten.\\n\\nWithout glancing at the woman, Artois strolled slowly on. Many people looked at him, but none spoke to him, for he was known now, as each stranger who stays long in Naples is known, summed up, labelled, and either ignored or pestered. The touts and the ruffiani were aware that it was no use to pester the Frenchman, and even the decrepit and indescribably seedy old men who hover before the huge plate-glass windows of the photograph shops, or linger near the entrance to the cinematograph, never peeped at him out of the corners of their bloodshot eyes or whispered a word of the white slaves in his ear.\\n\\nWhen he was beneath the dome, and could see the light gleaming upon the wings of the pointing angels, Artois seemed to be aware of an individual step among the many feet behind him, a step soft, furtive, and obstinate, that followed him like a fate's. He glanced up at the angels. A melancholy and half-bitter smile came to his lips. Then he turned to the right and made his way still slowly towards the Via Roma, always crowded from the early afternoon until late into the night. As he went, as he pushed through the mob of standing men at the entrance of the Galleria, and crossed the street to the far side, from which innumerable narrow and evil-looking alleys stretch away into the darkness up the hill, the influence of the following old woman increased upon him, casting upon him like a mist her hateful eagerness. He desired to be rid of it, and, quickening his walk, he turned into the first alley he came to, walked a little way up it, until he was in comparative solitude and obscurity, then stopped and abruptly turned.\\n\\nThe shiny, grayish mauve gown and the white-trimmed bonnet were close to him. Between them he faintly perceived a widely smiling face, and from this face broke at once a sickly torrent of speech, half Neapolitan dialect, half bastard French.\\n\\n\\\"Silenzio!\\\" Artois said, sternly.\\n\\nThe old harridan stopped in surprise, showing her tooth.\\n\\n\\\"What has become of Peppina?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Maria Santissima!\\\" she ejaculated, moving back a step in the darkness.\\n\\nShe paused. Then she said:\\n\\n\\\"You know Peppina!\\\"\\n\\nShe came forward again, quite up to him, and peered into his face, seeking there for an ugly truth which till now had been hidden from her.\\n\\n\\\"What had you to do with Peppina?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nothing. Tell me about her, and--\\\"\\n\\nHe put his hand to the inside pocket of his coat, and showed her the edge of a little case containing paper notes. The woman misunderstood him. He knew that by her face, which for the moment was as a battle- field on which lust fought with a desperate anger of disappointment. Then cunning came to stop the battle.\\n\\n\\\"You have heard of Peppina, Signore? You have never seen her?\\\"\\n\\nArtois played with her for a moment.\\n\\n\\\"Never.\\\"\\n\\nHer smile widened. She put up her thin hands to her hair, her bonnet, coquettishly.\\n\\n\\\"There is not a girl in Naples as beautiful as Peppina. Mother of--\\\"\\n\\nBut the game was too loathsome with such a player.\\n\\n\\\"Beautiful! Macche!\\\"\\n\\nHe laughed, made a gesture of pulling out a knife and smashing his face with it.\\n\\n\\\"Beautiful! Per Dio!\\\"\\n\\nThe coquetry, the cunning, dropped out of the long, pale face.\\n\\n\\\"The Signore knows?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ma si! All Naples knows.\\\"\\n\\nThe old woman's face became terrible. Her two hands shot up, dropped, shot up again, imprecating, cursing the world, the sky, the whole scheme of the universe, it seemed. She chattered like an ape. Artois soothed her with a ten-lire note.\\n\\nThat night, when he went back to the hotel, he had heard the aunt's version of Peppina, and knew--that which really he had known before-- that Hermione had taken her to live on the island.\\n\\nHermione! What was she? An original, clever and blind, great-hearted and unwise. An enthusiast, one created to be carried away.\\n\\nNever would she grow really old, never surely would the primal fires within her die down into the gray ashes that litter so many of the hearths by which age sits, a bleak, uncomely shadow.\\n\\nAnd Peppina was on the island, a girl from the stews of Naples; not wicked, perhaps, rather wronged, injured by life--nevertheless, the niece of that horror of the Galleria.\\n\\nHe thought of Vere and shuddered.\\n\\nNext day towards four o'clock the Marchesino strolled into Artois' room, with a peculiarly impudent look of knowledge upon his face.\\n\\n\\\"Buon giorno, Caro Emilio,\\\" he said. \\\"Are you busy?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not specially.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Will you come with me for a stroll in the Villa? Will you come to see the gathering together of the geese?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Che Diavolo! What's that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This summer the Marchesa Pontini has organized a sort of club, which meets in the Villa every day except Sundays. Three days the meeting is in the morning, three days in the afternoon. The silliest people of the aristocracy belong to this club, and the Marchesa is the mother goose. Ecco! Will you come, or--or have you some appointment?\\\" He smiled in his friend's face.\\n\\nArtois wondered, but could not divine, what was at the back of his mind.\\n\\n\\\"No, I had thought of going on the sea.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Or to the Toledo, perhaps?\\\"\\n\\nThe Marchesino laughed happily.\\n\\n\\\"The Toledo? Why should I go there?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Non lo so. Put on your chapeau and come. Il fait tres beau cet apres- midi.\\\"\\n\\nDoro was very proud of his French, which made Artois secretly shiver, and generally spoke it when he was in specially good spirits, or was feeling unusually mischievous. As they walked along the sea-front a moment later, he continued in Italian:\\n\\n\\\"You were not at the island yesterday, Emilio?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. Were you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I naturally called to know how the ladies were after that terrible storm. What else could I do?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And how were they?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Signora was in Naples, and of course the Signorina could not have received me alone. But the saints were with me, Emilio. I met her on the sea; quite by herself, on the sea of the Saint's pool. She was lying back in a little boat, with no hat on, her hands behind her head --so, and her eyes--her beautiful eyes, Emilio, were full of dreams, of dreams of the sea.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How do you know that?\\\" said Artois, rather sharply.\\n\\n\\\"Cosa?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How do you know the Signorina was dreaming of the sea? Did she--did she tell you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, but I am sure. We walked together from the boats. I told her she was an enchantress of the sea, the spirit of the wave--I told her!\\\"\\n\\nHe spread out his hands, rejoicing in the remembrance of his graceful compliments.\\n\\n\\\"The Signorina was delighted, but she could not stay long. She had a slight headache and was a little tired after the storm. But she would have liked to ask me to the house. She was longing to. I could see that.\\\"\\n\\nHe seized his mustache.\\n\\n\\\"She turned her head away, trying to conceal from me her desire, but--\\\"\\n\\nHe laughed.\\n\\n\\\"Le donne! Le donne!\\\" he happily exclaimed.\\n\\nArtois found himself wondering why, until Doro had made the acquaintance of the dwellers on the island, he had never wished to smack his smooth, complacent cheeks.\\n\\nThey turned from the sea into the broad walk of the Villa, and walked towards the kiosk. Near it, on the small, green chairs, were some ladies swathed in gigantic floating-veils, talking to two or three very smart young men in white suits and straw hats, who leaned forward eying them steadily with a determined yet rather vacuous boldness that did not disconcert them. One of the ladies, dressed in black-and-white check, was immensely stout. She seemed to lead the conversation, which was carried on with extreme vivacity in very loud and not melodious voices.\\n\\n\\\"Ecco the gathering of the geese!\\\" said the Marchesino, touching Artois on the arm. \\\"And that\\\"--he pointed to the stout lady, who at this moment tossed her head till her veil swung loose like a sail suddenly deserted by the wind--\\\"is the goose-mother. Buona sera, Marchesa! Buona sera--molto piacere. Carlo, buona sera--a rivederci, Contessa! A questa sera.\\\"\\n\\nHe showed his splendid teeth in a fixed but winning smile, and, hat in hand, went by, walking from his hips. Then, replacing his hat on his head, he added to his friend:\\n\\n\\\"The Marchesa is always hoping that the Duchessa d'Aosta will come one day, if only for a moment, to smile upon the geese. But--well, the Duchessa prefers to climb to the fourth story to see the poor. She has a heart. Let us sit here, Emilio.\\\"\\n\\nThey sat down under the trees, and the Marchesino looked at his pointed boots for a moment in silence, pushing forward his under lip until his blond mustache touched the jaunty tip of his nose. Then he began to laugh, still looking before him.\\n\\n\\\"Emilio! Emilio!\\\"\\n\\nHe shook his head repeatedly.\\n\\n\\\"Emilio mio! And that you should be asking me to show you Naples! It is too good! C'est parfait!\\\"\\n\\nThe Marchesino turned towards Artois.\\n\\n\\\"And Maria Fortunata! Santa Maria of the Toledo, the white-haired protectress of the strangers! Emilio--you might have come to me! But you do not trust me. Ecco! You do not--\\\"\\n\\nArtois understood.\\n\\n\\\"You saw me last night?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ma si! All Naples saw you. Do you not know that the Galleria is full --but full--of eyes?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Va bene! But you don't understand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Emilio!\\\"\\n\\nHe shrugged his shoulders, lifted his hands, his eyebrows. His whole being seemed as if it were about to mount ironically towards heaven.\\n\\n\\\"You don't understand. I repeat it.\\\"\\n\\nArtois spoke quietly, but there was a sound in his voice which caused his frivolous companion to stare at him with an inquiry that was, for a moment, almost sulky.\\n\\n\\\"You forget, Doro, how old I am.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What has that to do with it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You forget--\\\"\\n\\nArtois was about to allude to his real self, to point out the improbability of a man so mental, so known, so travelled as he was, falling like a school-boy publicly into a sordid adventure. But he stopped, realizing the uselessness of such an explanation. And he could not tell the Marchesino the truth of his shadowy colloquy in a by-street with the old creature from behind the shutter.\\n\\n\\\"You have made a mistake about me,\\\" he said. \\\"But it is of no consequence. Look! There is another goose coming.\\\"\\n\\nHe pointed with his cane in the direction of the chatterers near the kiosk.\\n\\n\\\"It is papa! It is papa!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Pardon! I did not recognize--\\\"\\n\\nThe Marchesino got up.\\n\\n\\\"Let us go there. The Marchesa with papa--it is better than the Compagnia Scarpetta! I will present you.\\\"\\n\\nBut Artois was in no mood for a cataract of nothingness.\\n\\n\\\"Not now,\\\" he said. \\\"I have--\\\"\\n\\nThe Marchesino shot a cruel glance of impudent comprehension at him, and touched his left hand in token of farewell.\\n\\n\\\"I know! I know! The quickest horse to the Toledo. A-ah! A-ah! May the writer's saint go with you! Addio, mio caro!\\\"\\n\\nThere was a hint of real malice in his voice. He cocked his hat and strutted away towards the veils and the piercing voices. Artois stared after him for a moment, then walked across the garden to the sea, and leaned against the low wall looking towards Capri. He was vexed at this little episode--unreasonably vexed. In his friend Doro he now discerned a possible enemy. An Italian who has trusted does not easily forgive if he is not trusted in return. Artois was conscious of a dawning hostility in the Marchesino. No doubt he could check it. Doro was essentially good-tempered and light-hearted. He could check it by an exhibition of frankness. But this frankness was impossible to him, and as it was impossible he must allow Doro to suspect him of sordid infamies. He knew, of course, the Neapolitan's habitual disbelief in masculine virtue, and did not mind it. Then why should he mind Doro's laughing thought of himself as one of the elderly crew who cling to forbidden pleasures? Why should he feel sore, angry, almost insulted?\\n\\nVere rose before him, as one who came softly to bring him the answer to his questionings. And he knew that his vexation arose from the secret apprehension of a future in which he would desire to stand between her and the Marchesino with clean hands, and tell Doro certain truths which are universal, not national. Such truths would come ill from one whom the lectured held unclean.\\n\\nAs he walked home to the hotel his vexation grew.\\n\\nWhen he was once more in his room he remembered his remark to Hermione, \\\"We shall have many quiet, happy evenings together this summer, I hope,\\\" and her strange and doubtful reply. And because he felt himself invaded by her doubts he resolved to set out for the island. If he took a boat at once he could be there between six and seven o'clock.\\n\\nAnd perhaps he would see the new occupant of the Casa del Mare. Perhaps he would see Peppina.\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\n\\\"I have come, you see,\\\" said Artois that evening, as he entered Hermione's room, \\\"to have the first of our quiet, happy evenings, about which you were so doubtful.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Was I?\\\"\\n\\nShe smiled at him from her seat between the big windows.\\n\\nOutside the door he had, almost with a sudden passion, dismissed the vague doubts and apprehensions that beset him. He came with a definite brightness, a strong intimacy, holding out his hands, intent really on forcing Fate to weave her web in accordance with his will.\\n\\n\\\"We women are full of little fears, even the bravest of us. Chase mine away, Emile.\\\"\\n\\nHe sat down.\\n\\n\\\"What are they?\\\"\\n\\nShe shook her head.\\n\\n\\\"Formless--or almost. But perhaps that adds to the uneasiness they inspire. To put them into words would be impossible.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Away with them!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Willingly.\\\"\\n\\nHer eyes seemed to be asking him questions, to be not quite satisfied, not quite sure of something.\\n\\n\\\"What is it?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\\"I wonder if you have it in you to be angry with me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Make your confession.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have Peppina here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You knew--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have known you as an impulsive for--how many years? Why should you change?\\\"\\n\\nHe looked at her in silence for a moment. Then he continued:\\n\\n\\\"Sometimes you remind me--in spots, as it were--of George Sand.\\\"\\n\\nShe laughed, not quite without bitterness.\\n\\n\\\"In spots, indeed!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She described herself once in a book as having 'a great facility' for illusions, a blind benevolence of judgment, a tenderness of heart that was inexhaustible--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Wait! From these qualities, she said, came hurry, mistakes innumerable, heroic devotion to objects that were worthless, much weakness, tremendous disappointments.\\\"\\n\\nHermione said nothing, but sat still looking grave.\\n\\n\\\"Well? Don't you recognize something of yourself in the catalogue, my friend?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have I a great facility for illusions? Am I capable of heroic devotion to worthless objects?\\\"\\n\\nSuddenly Artois remembered all he knew and she did not know.\\n\\n\\\"At least you act hastily often,\\\" he said evasively. \\\"And I think you are often so concentrated upon the person who stands, perhaps suffering, immediately before you, that you forget who is on the right, who is on the left.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Emile, I asked your advice yesterday, and you would not give it me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A fair hit!\\\" he said. \\\"And so Peppina is here. How did the servants receive her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think they were rather surprised. Of course they don't know the truth.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They will within--shall we say twenty-four hours, or less?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How can they? Peppina won't tell them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are sure? And when Gaspare goes into Naples to 'fare la spesa'?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I told Gaspare last night.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That was wisdom. You understand your watch-dog's character.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You grant that Gaspare is not an instance of a worthless object made the recipient of my heroic devotion?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Give him all you like,\\\" said Artois, with warmth. \\\"You will never repent of that. Was he angry when you told him?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think he was.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I heard him saying 'Testa della Madonna!' as he was leaving me.\\n\\nArtois could not help smiling.\\n\\n\\\"And Vere?\\\" he said, looking directly at her.\\n\\n\\\"I have not told Vere anything about Peppina's past,\\\" Hermione said, rather hastily. \\\"I do not intend to. I explained that Peppina had had a sad life and had been attacked by a man who had fallen in love with her, and for whom she didn't care.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And Vere was all sympathy and pity?\\\" said Artois, gently.\\n\\n\\\"She didn't seem much interested, I thought. She scarcely seemed to be listening. I don't believe she has seen Peppina yet. When we arrived she was shut up in her room.\\\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she was looking at him, and she saw a slight change come over his face.\\n\\n\\\"Do you think--\\\" she began, and paused. \\\"I wonder if she was reading,\\\" she added, slowly, after a moment.\\n\\n\\\"Even the children have their secrets,\\\" he answered. As he spoke he turned his head and looked out of the window towards Ischia. \\\"How clear it is to-night! There will be no storm.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. We can dine outside. I have told them.\\\" Her voice sounded slightly constrained. \\\"I will go and call Vere,\\\" she added.\\n\\n\\\"She is in the house?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think so.\\\"\\n\\nShe went out, shutting the door behind her.\\n\\nSo Vere was working. Artois felt sure that her conversation with him had given to her mind, perhaps to her heart, too, an impulse that had caused an outburst of young energy. Ah! the blessed ardors of youth! How beautiful they are, and, even in their occasional absurdity, how sacred. What Hermione had said had made him realize acutely the influence which his celebrity and its cause--the self that had made it --must have upon a girl who was striving as Vere was. He felt a thrill of pleasure, even of triumph, that startled him, so seldom now, jealous and careful as he was of his literary reputation, did he draw any definite joy from it. Would Vere ever do something really good? He found himself longing that she might, as the proud godparent longs for his godchild to gain prizes. He remembered the line at the close of Maeterlinck's \\\"Pelleas and Melisande,\\\" a line that had gone like a silver shaft into this soul when he first heard it--\\\"Maintenant c'est au tour de la pauvre petite\\\" (Now it's the child's turn.)\\n\\n\\\"Now it's the child's turn,\\\" he said it to himself, forming the words with his lips. At that moment he was freed entirely from the selfishness of age, and warm with a generous and noble sympathy with youth, its aspirations, its strivings, its winged hopes. He got up from his chair. He had a longing to go to Vere and tell her all he was feeling, a longing to pour into her--as just then he could have poured it--inspiration molten in a long-tried furnace. He had no need of any one but Vere.\\n\\nThe doors opened and Hermione came back.\\n\\n\\\"Vere is coming, Emile,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"You told her I was here?\\\"\\n\\nShe looked at him swiftly, as if the ringing sound in his voice had startled her.\\n\\n\\\"Yes. She is glad, I know. Dear little Vere!\\\"\\n\\nHer voice was dull, and she spoke--or he fancied so--rather mechanically. He remembered all she did not know and was conscious of her false position. In their intercourse she had so often, so generally, been the enthusiastic sympathizer. More than she knew she had inspired him.\\n\\n\\\"Dear Hermione! How good it is to be here with you!\\\" he said, turning towards her the current of his sympathy. \\\"As one grows old one clings to the known, the proved. That passion at least increases while so many others fade away, the passion for all that is faithful in a shifting world, for all that is real, that does not suffer corruption, disintegration! How adorable is Time where Time is powerless!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is Time ever powerless?\\\" she said. \\\"Ah, here is Vere!\\\"\\n\\nThey dined outside upon the terrace facing Vesuvius. Artois sat between mother and child. Vere was very quiet. Her excitement, her almost feverish gayety of the evening of the storm had vanished. To-night dreams hung in her eyes. And the sea was quiet as she was, repentant surely of its former furies. There seemed something humble, something pleading in its murmur, as if it asked forgiveness and promised amendment.\\n\\nThe talk was chiefly between Hermione and Artois. It was not very animated. Perhaps the wide peace of the evening influenced their minds. When coffee was carried out Artois lit his pipe, and fell into complete silence, watching the sea. Giulia brought to Hermione a bit of embroidery on which she was working, cleared away the dessert and quietly disappeared. From the house now and then came a sound of voices, of laughter. It died away, and the calm of the coming night, the calm of the silent trio that faced it, seemed to deepen as if in delicate protest against the interference. The stillness of Nature to-night was very natural. But was the human stillness natural? Presently Artois, suddenly roused, he knew not why, to self- consciousness, found himself wondering. Vere lay back in her wicker chair like one at ease. Hermione was leaning forward over her work with her eyes bent steadily upon it. Far off across the sea the smoke from the summit of Vesuvius was dyed at regular intervals by the red fire that issued from the entrails of the mountain. Silently it rose from its hidden world, glowed angrily, menacingly, faded, then glowed again. And the life that is in fire, and that seems to some the most intense of all the forces of life, stirred Artois from his peace. The pulse of the mountain, whose regular beating was surely indicated by the regularly recurring glow of the rising flame, seemed for a moment to be sounding in his ears, and, with it, all the pulses that were beating through the world. And he thought of the calm of their bodies, of Hermione's, of Vere's, of his own, as he had thought of the calm of the steely sky, the steely sea, that had preceded the bursting of the storm that came from Ischia. He thought of it as something unnatural, something almost menacing, a sort of combined lie that strove to conceal, to deny, the leaping fires of the soul.\\n\\nSuddenly Vere got up and went quietly away. While she had been with them silence had been easy. Directly she was gone Artois felt that it was difficult, in another moment that it was no longer possible.\\n\\n\\\"Am I to see Peppina to-night?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\\"Do you wish to?\\\"\\n\\nHermione's hands moved a little faster about their work when he spoke.\\n\\n\\\"I feel a certain interest in her, as I should in any new inhabitant of the island. A very confined space seems always to heighten the influence of human personality, I think. On your rock everybody must mean a good deal, perhaps more than you realize, Hermione.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am beginning to realize that,\\\" she answered, quietly. \\\"Perhaps they mean too much. I wonder if it is wise to live as we do?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In such comparative isolation, you mean?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\nShe laid her work down in her lap.\\n\\n\\\"I'm afraid that by nature I am a monopolist,\\\" she said. \\\"And as I could never descend into the arena of life to struggle to keep what I have, if others desired to take it from me, I am inclined jealously to guard it.\\\"\\n\\nShe took up her work again.\\n\\n\\\"I've been thinking that I am rather like the dog that buries his bone,\\\" she added, bending once more over the embroidery.\\n\\n\\\"Are you thinking of--of your husband?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, and of Vere. I isolated myself with Maurice. Now I am isolating myself with Vere. Perhaps it is unwise, weak, this instinct to keep out the world.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are you thinking of changing your mode of life, then?\\\" he asked.\\n\\nIn his voice there was a sound of anxiety which she noticed.\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps. I don't know.\\\"\\n\\nShe glanced at him and away, and he thought that there was something strange in her eyes. After a pause, she said:\\n\\n\\\"What would you advise?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Surely you are happy here. And--and Vere is happy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Vere is happy--yes.\\\"\\n\\nHe realized the thoughtlessness of his first sentence.\\n\\n\\\"But I must think of Vere's development. Lately, in these last days, I have been realizing that Vere is moving, is beginning to move very fast. Perhaps it is time to bring her into contact with more people. Perhaps--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You once asked my advice,\\\" he interrupted. \\\"I give it now. Leave Vere alone. What she needs she will obtain. Have no fear of that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are sure?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Quite sure. Sometimes, often, the children know instinctively more than their elders know by experience.\\\"\\n\\nHermione's lips trembled.\\n\\n\\\"Sometimes,\\\" she said, in a low voice, \\\"I think Vere knows far more than I do. But--but I often feel that I am very blind, very stupid. You called me an impulsive--I suppose I am one. But if I don't follow my impulses, what am I to follow? One must have a guide.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, and reason is often such a dull one, like a verger throwing one over a cathedral and destroying its mystery and its beauty with every word he speaks. When one is young one does not feel that one needs a guide at all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sometimes--often--I feel very helpless now,\\\" she said.\\n\\nHe was acutely conscious of the passionate longing for sympathy that was alive within her, and more faintly aware of a peculiar depression that companioned her to-night. Yet, for some reason unknown to him, he could not issue from a certain reserve that checked him, could not speak to her as he had spoken not long ago in the cave. Indeed, as she came in her last words a little towards him, as one with hands tremblingly and a little doubtfully held out, he felt that he drew back.\\n\\n\\\"I think we all feel helpless often when we have passed our first youth,\\\" he answered.\\n\\nHe got up and stretched himself, towering above her.\\n\\n\\\"Shall we stroll about a little?\\\" he added. \\\"I feel quite cramped with sitting.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You go. I'll finish this flower.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll take a turn and come back.\\\"\\n\\nAs he went she dropped her embroidery and sat staring straight before her at the sea.\\n\\nArtois heard voices in the house, and listened for a new one, the voice of Peppina. But he could not distinguish it. He went down into the tiny garden. No one was there, and he returned, and passing through the house came out on its farther side. Here he met Gaspare coming up from the sea.\\n\\n\\\"Good-evening, Gaspare,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Good-evening, Signore.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hear there's a new-comer in the house.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Signore?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A new servant.\\\"\\n\\nGaspare lifted his large eyes towards heaven.\\n\\n\\\"Testa della Madonna?\\\" said Artois.\\n\\n\\\"Signore?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have a cigar, Gaspare?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Grazie, Signore.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is she a good sort of girl, do you think?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who, Signore?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This Peppina.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She is in the kitchen, Signore. I have nothing to do with her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I see.\\\"\\n\\nEvidently Gaspare did not mean to talk. Artois decided to change the subject.\\n\\n\\\"I hear you had that boy, Ruffo, sleeping in the house the other night,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signore; the Signorina wished it.\\\"\\n\\nGaspare's voice sounded rather more promising.\\n\\n\\\"He seems popular on the island.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He had been ill, Signore, and it was raining hard. Poveretto! He had had the fever. It was bad for him to be out in the boat.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So Ruffo's getting hold of you too!\\\" thought Artois.\\n\\nHe pulled at his cigar once or twice. Then he said:\\n\\n\\\"Do you think he looks like a Sicilian?\\\"\\n\\nGaspare's eyes met his steadily.\\n\\n\\\"A Sicilian, Signore?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Signore, he is a Sicilian. How should he not look like one?\\\"\\n\\nGaspare's voice sounded rebellious.\\n\\n\\\"Va bene, Gaspare, va bene. Have you seen the Signorina?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think she is at the wooden seat, Signore. The Signorina likes to look at the sea from there.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will go and see if I can find her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Va bene, Signore. And I will go to speak with the Signora.\\\"\\n\\nHe took off his hat and went into the house. Artois stood for a moment looking after him and pulling at his beard.
