"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"It’s good to be the bitcoin 1%. The top bitcoin holders control a greater share of the cryptocurrency than the most affluent American households control in dollars, according to a study by the National Bureau of Economica Research.\\n\\nThe study showed that the top 10,000 bitcoins accounts hold 5 million bitcoins, the equivalent of approximately $232 billion.\\n\\nWith an estimated 114 million people globally holding the cryptocurrency, according to crypto.com, that means that approximately 0.01% of bitcoin holders control 27% of the 19 million bitcoin in circulation.\\n\\nBy comparison, in the U.S., where wealth inequality is at its most extreme in decades, the top 1% of households hold about one-third of all wealth, according to the Federal Reserve.\\n\\nThe study, conducted by finance professors Antoinette Schoar at MIT Sloan School of Management and Igor Makarov at the London School of Economics, for the first time, mapped and analyzed every transaction in bitcoin’s more than 13 years history.\\n\\nThe ramifications of that centralization are mainly twofold, the paper argues. \\n\\nFirst, it makes the entire bitcoin network more susceptible to systemic risk.\\n\\nSecond, it means the majority of the gains from the rising price and increased adoption go to a disproportionately small group of investors.\\n\\n“Despite having been around for 14 years and the hype it has watched up, it’s still the case that it’s a very concentrated ecosystem,” Ms. Schoar said about bitcoin.\\n\\nBitcoin was unveiled in 2008 as an open-source software project intended to be an electronic form of physical cash without gatekeepers. Anybody could download the software, become a “node” on the network, and “mine” for bitcoin.\\n\\nIn practice, though, bitcoin has become highly centralized. Most people who trade do so through exchanges. The costs of mining have become so high that only a small group of enterprise-level firms can afford to do it.\\n\\nThe wealth of bitcoin miners and exchanges has skyrocketed over the past two years as the price of a single bitcoin jumped from $5,000 in March 2020 to as high as $68,990 last month. The number of people holding bitcoin more than doubled and now includes a number of well-known investors, hedge-fund manager Paul Tudor Jones, entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Mark Cuban, and celebrities such as actress Maisie Williams.\\n\\nYet the vast majority of bitcoin transactions, about 90%, are derived from two activities that have no actual economic function, the researchers said.\\n\\nThe first activity is simply the way the network processes bitcoin transactions-think of it as the equivalent of making change for $20 when you buy coffee. The second are transactions sent between wallets by the same user trying to obfuscate their identity, a common tactic for those seeking anonymity.\\n\\nOf the remaining 10% of volume, that the researcher called “real volume,” trading dominates. Transactions between exchanges and trading desks accounted for roughly 75% of total volume, they said.\\n\\nBy comparison, scams, gambling sites, and other illicit uses, which concern law enforcement and lawmakers, accounted for less than 3%.\\n\\nThis type of analysis is possible, more so than with physical cash, because bitcoin runs on a network that records every transaction in a publicly viewable ledger. While user identities aren’t tied to those transactions, it is still possible to track and analyze those transactions, determine their use and discern whether the accounts represent institutions or individuals.\",\"timestamp\":1640361764,\"title\":\"Bitcoin's Ultra-Elite Dominate Its Wealth\"},\"digest\":\"5sINI1SOwHBcPyRYaP8frt7MZehWsS3tSMVbmIMowvQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x1586775eEF0E4F992FBdc206fe78d33fBD2B8696\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MZtRjDiy5eabs1knoU4SE2vvJFCjjVzEYm2xOWB4ObU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qqi3-qPgFsPPi_U9AvK7xyMVMqAJQ_BhSB5PqafW4E8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"2Kxuz-wJJzO0TGlbrVnLS2IaBPKml6kl43le5CZys7yEbjp460_KYfDZKzT6nuvoDPoFMadce1nlx0_bml94_w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xecb982d1d8aeb5c00c6ec86bc9d4d5a8455370672b81017c05d27b2360c173b814b4d4cbc4f7b496c07288289e44fc8477761a587beec3ef4a835762cefe52f71b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MZtRjDiy5eabs1knoU4SE2vvJFCjjVzEYm2xOWB4ObU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qqi3-qPgFsPPi_U9AvK7xyMVMqAJQ_BhSB5PqafW4E8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"5sINI1SOwHBcPyRYaP8frt7MZehWsS3tSMVbmIMowvQ\"}"
