We work with **independent** bars who nurture their venueâ€™s vibe. **Chains** **are lame.**\\n\\n![Happy participants outside an excellent independent bar in Cologne](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IRxqMZ010wAcKzkYh8hiY.png?height=605&width=908)\\n\\nIt seems there are dozens of perfect venues in your city, but as you look closer, it becomes clear that finding that truly compatible match takes love and patience.\\n\\n### Invite your friends\\n\\nAs part of **[Decentralise Mundo Lingo](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/Bz8plTeNzVaYGOvJ7utPNUn41k6G4HSh3fnhOxzWjb8)** we recommend making this as much a public affair as possible. You can do so by sharing this guide, the venue onboarding form via [mundolingo.org/join](https://mundolingo.org/join) and the City Map (see below) so that members can add their own venues.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZIZDPBnluEw3_BO7r8EBL.png?height=600&width=600)\\n\\n## Strategy\\n\\nEverybody knows that language schools, universities and big train stations are in the centre of the city as they are in every city around the world. However, the aim is open 3, 4 or more weekly events in your city. To open 1 event in the centre of a mega-city is incredibly short-sighted.\\n\\n**Ask yourself**; if you were to open 5 events in your city tomorrow, where would they be?\\n**And then, read this:**\\n\\n**Why the CBD / Centre, will only waste your time**\\n\\n1. High Prices\\n2. Bars are already busy - They donâ€™t need us\\n3. Full of office workers in suits. Suits kill vibe\\n4. Bars with no character\\n5. Only generic penny-pinching airport-style chain bars survive.\\n6. People working/studying in the centre go home at 5pm. After taking an hour to get home and change, they wont come back to the centre.\\n\\n### The Fringe\\n\\nWhere cool bars hang out. These bars are friendly and cultivate their community in order to survive,  just like us! **Independents** are often run by open-minded owners rather than the corporate office policies of **chains**. The fringe has trendy bars, sweet vibes, lower prices, less suits and more authentic smiles.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DRRunSL2TrpnaVqsEAell.png?height=800&width=800)\\n\\n### Your City Map\\n\\nA City Map is provided (please donâ€™t create a new one). Use the City Map to mark businesses (bars, hostels and language schools) and take notes on them. If you canâ€™t find your City Map, ask your Lead.\\n\\n![Bars in Bangkok marked green, yellow and red (Traffic Light System)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4gu4q8WH2hYpPdfNbQ6Gj.png?height=444&width=655)\\n\\n### 100 Venues\\n\\nMark every potential venue you can find in your city. If your city has over 2 million people you should get 100 venues.\\n\\n### Traffic Light System\\n\\nCheck reviews, photos, social media and mark each one down on your City Map as **Red or Yellow** according to its candidacy.\\n\\n```\\nðŸ”´ Red\\t     â€“  Fail\\nðŸŸ¡ Yellow    â€“  Possible Candidate, will research or visit.\\nðŸŸ¢ Green     â€“  Criteria confirmed by in-person visit\\n```\\n\\n### Brute Force\\n\\nAdd all the bars you can find as yellow! Next, go through those yellows and check their social media and photos. if you see that they fail, mark them as red.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s-U4oat20vwmM-ZwiOXdu.png?height=428&width=816)\\n\\n### Dig Deep\\n\\nIf youâ€™re not finding bars that meet criteria itâ€™s because you need to dig deeper. Google independent articles and blogs on bars in your city.\\n\\nSome example search terms to find spacious/unique bars:\\n\\n`Hidden Gems in [City]`\\n`Hipster hang outs [City]`\\n`Arty bars [City]`\\n`Unique bars [City]`\\n`Bars to dance swing [City]`\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IUq88nereCFpMEyIN5ipD.png?height=493&width=930)\\n\\n## Visiting Time\\n\\nAt this point, your map should have lots of red and yellow markers. Letâ€™s turn those yellows into greens.\\n\\n### You need\\n\\n1. Your City Map open on your phone\\n2. â€˜Add Venueâ€™ form ready on your phone (4th option on the [join page](https://mundolingo.org/join))\\n3. Grab a friend (or victim)\\n4. A notepad or note taking app\\n\\n![You can plan a route on your custom Google Map](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QcmZvMeu76bg4uMUOXHS_.png?height=768&width=1366)\\n\\nHave a drink in each venue preferably on a Monday to Thursday night. Be prepared to spread the search over 2 or even 3 weeks. If you planned a route, follow it with GPS on your smartphone.\\n\\n**Donâ€™t** â€¦ tell the venue staff youâ€™re from ML. Just scout the place out and absorb the ambience as an anonymous customer.\\n\\n### ðŸ”´ Fail?\\n\\nWrite it down so you can update your notes on the map later.\\n\\n### ðŸŸ¡ Maybe?\\n\\nWrite it down so you can update your notes on the map later.\\n\\n### ðŸŸ¢ Like it?\\n\\nIf first impressions are good, continue to:\\n\\n1. **Buy a drink** â€“ Howâ€™s the service?\\n2. **Talk with your friend** â€“ Can you hear each other comfortably?\\n3. **Go to the bathroom** â€“ Are they clean?\\n4. **Look at the food** â€“ does it look nice? Take a photo of the menu!\\n\\n### ðŸŸ¢ Still Good?\\n\\n1. Fill out the Add Venue form (4th option on the [join page](https://mundolingo.org/join)).\\n2. Take a video to share with your Leaders Assembly on Telegram\\n\\n## Venue Presentation\\n\\nYour Map needs:\\n\\n```\\nðŸ”´ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¢    - 100 venues total\\nðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¢      - 20 venues Green or yellow\\nðŸŸ¢        - 5 venues Green\\n```\\n\\nAll venues should have notes:\\nâ€¢ Links to website / social media.\\nâ€¢ Link to photos of the target space\\nâ€¢ If target space is different from public space, clarify this.\\nâ€¢ For extra easy processing, record a video as you visit the venue\\nâ€¢ Your personal experience of the venue and its ambience\\nâ€¢ Capacity, price range, closing time, distinguishing factors.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nxy2wywTkjAIWpF044Kt3.png?height=533&width=697)\\n\\n**Submit |** Use the [Venue Presentation](https://form.typeform.com/to/MstQmu?typeform-source=admin.typeform.com) form to present your finalists.\\n\\n### Judgement Day\\n\\n**Judges will try to answer â€˜noâ€™ to one of the following:**\\n\\n1. Does the map have enough venues?\\n2. Do the map have sufficient notes for top 10 items?\\n3. Search for good venues not on the map. Is the Map complete?\\n\\nIf judges can answer â€˜Noâ€™, we ask you to keep searching and wait 7 days before re-submitting.\\n\\nIf all 3 are a â€˜Yesâ€™, the judges check the Greens against criteria. If a bar meets criteria, itâ€™s marked with a tick as seen here below.\\n\\n![Those 3 were Green-Lighted](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/q1puHaprJ6lOkKpz5ZM_t.png?height=309&width=401)\\n\\nThose ticks are â€˜Green Lightsâ€™. Managers now have full authority to enter into negotiations with those venues and even confirm launch dates. Read more about that in the â€˜First Dateâ€™ guide. **\\\\[Link Needed\\\\]**\\n\\n## Well Done!\\n\\nItâ€™s a lot of work. If you did this properly, it will pay dividends for years to come every time you donâ€™t have to search for a new venue because of one problem after another. Well done to you!\\n\\n## Now what?\\n\\nNext up, itâ€™s time to [Make a Flag Order](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/xTansKsBjo462mukYF2qo8W0jJ7auH4hB9Of9aiGpBk)\\n\\n### Or Go Back \\n\\nðŸ‘ˆ [Events Operations Manual](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/QhvLl3HKyYJ2Z1TVX-rwDjVhwLhwX-QNyRHawRUYZFE)\",\"timestamp\":1639396370,\"title\":\"EOM | Venue Investigation\"},\"digest\":\"r2vf1Yu9YjAEw3bI9wk2Jqah8G1PiupIFv680NxqlX8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"34suyCfnLUoFM02SOhmJJJ9iXgiiL5kC6iPH6Fv3LXk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"jtVAiplEVAd0RPMj7L2P0umm9wTPdvk-kh1vAJTvwJc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"5CdwpD4LlReUagWA2wNWBhHlWmN9vgUccaBXtyRwTGdW9XXI1cnIen-NJpxt3CZEeWLqJCZvaZQrEO7ifNM7Lg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x57d0f7cbea22222afabed23e09ac819f759269ea4cca2a83cdd992ddf3ffe88d22a7afd325b70c3c1ae7dee6f5fc8e22188ba69c589cf1f0528e258261121ae51b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"34suyCfnLUoFM02SOhmJJJ9iXgiiL5kC6iPH6Fv3LXk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"jtVAiplEVAd0RPMj7L2P0umm9wTPdvk-kh1vAJTvwJc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"nFMsZt_ViKSjqZ3tQz4vQtexfLzzjnod8Kp3GOZvS9M\"}"
