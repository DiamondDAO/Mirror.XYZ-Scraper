We are keen to explore the underlying logic and cutting-edge tracks in the field of digital encryption. Welcome to our Twitter: sparkdao_io\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7Zh49vwAeTblIZX5xWlrS.jpg?height=388&width=900)\\n\\nThe Metaverse represents another world in the virtual space, where users can live a normal life.By creating avatars, users can gain unique identities in the virtual world and can sport, work, make money, and entertain.NFT is an integral part of the metaverse that user ownership of digital assets.As the value of these NFT increases, users can generate revenue by selling them at higher prices.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fOnZ1dbgq177Vr-FNk3aX.jpg?height=320&width=652)\\n\\nThe Metaverse supports GameFi and P2E —— users who can play their favorite games and generate revenue.The P2E model is an open economy that allows people to enjoy the ultimate experience while also making money.In addition to games, other revenue sources in the digital world include renting land in the virtual world, participating in different events, and opening online shopping stores in the virtual space.\\n\\n### The GameFi Natural Adapter Meta-Universe\\n\\nThe GameFi and the meta-universe of the Earn-Play-to (P2E) mode have been bundled together in the blockchain gaming space.The Mettaverse has shareable features consistent with the ultimate goal of the P2E model seeking to revolutionize the game industry through blockchain.As the Mettaverse explodes innovations and the birth of consumer-centric projects, the P2E model will revolutionize games in the Mettaverse.In this way, the possibility of obtaining mainstream adoption will increase.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kvIbvtpZqCEPkNYMrqWet.jpg?height=211&width=400)\\n\\nSo GameFi directly uses cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to build a metacosmic economic framework.Gamers will also enjoy a wide range of benefits in the metaverse.For example, players can collect cryptocurrencies, NFT, and other virtual assets while playing various games on the blockchain.\\n\\nIt's worth mentioning that the Play-to-Earn (P2E) game mode has a huge advantage over traditional game platforms.This synergy takes it to the mainstream.At the same time, while functionally competitive, many people are still interested in the traditional game style; including the pleasure of the 2D traditional experience.\\n\\n### What is the difference between the GameFi?\\n\\nDetails may vary, but GameFi is by far the basic and most successful model to date.In some cases, playing games is very beneficial.Essentially, if you earn tokens in increasingly popular games, the value of these tokens could grow dramatically: the AXS price rose from 54 cents to $94 in 2021.This means that playing games is not only a contest with digital games, but also a form of currency speculation.Whether or not this is a sustainable model, it was enough during the Axie rise to attract players in low-income countries such as the Philippines.Those who can't afford the upfront cost of the game usually rent existing Axies from early players.In many cases, they pay by sharing the game revenue.Last year, there were tons of social media posts about Filipinos making more money through Axie than their traditional daily work.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wrO2RI9t9OX0l5evJNKFh.jpg?height=318&width=640)\\n\\nOf course, holding volatile assets can mean huge losses and gains, and players can face difficulties if they try to cash in during a sharp decline.Some tokens can also be used in countless DeFi dapp that can earn interest by using as collateral for loans, and game developers usually get tokens for their work, so the more people who play and trade tokens, push up the tokens, the more money they make.Some games also charge certain transactions that flow into the relevant company or treasury from which developers get paid.\\n\\nThe convergence of DeFi and NFT with gaming applications has brought tremendous innovation to the metaverse market, as P2E games accelerate in both the number of new users and the number of upcoming projects.It's no exaggeration to say that GameFi will soon capture the heights of the mainstream gaming market.That said, the cryptocurrency industry is known for its rapid turnover cycle of boom and depression, which could drag down the GameFi track.\\n\\nUltimately, with blockchain further evolving and merging with other related technologies like AR, VR, and AI over the next decade, GameFi is likely to be incorporated into the exploding multiverse, changing the face of the crypto space and digital industry again.\\n\\n\\\\*The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of SparkDAO.
