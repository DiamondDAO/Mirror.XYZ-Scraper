"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Ordinary people just need to have a job, and they are satisfied if they can earn the basic material to support themselves.\\n\\nNS!\\n\\nBusinessmen can make money as long as they can do business.\\n\\nBusinessmen are principled. For example, even if they are not illegal, they will not do things that are unlawful. For example, some businessmen do not operate the profitable online game industry in today's society, because the game industry has caused too many students to delay their studies.\\n\\nWhat about entrepreneurs? I want to bring some beauty to this world and change the lives of mankind. Contribute to society.\\n\\nTechnicians or artists always want the world to revolve around themselves. If such a person wants to be rich, it is dreaming.\\n\\nEntrepreneurs, businessmen, businessmen, and bosses are always looking at what the world needs, what they can contribute, and what people's needs can be met. They revolve around this world, and the world will of course give back to these people a lot of wealth.\\n\\nOrdinary people are the display of their own nature, do whatever they like, and they think the world is just what it is like. The boss controls his own nature, satisfies the nature of others, and then makes money.\\n\\nAnyone who has achieved something in this world is changing themselves to adapt to others. The more people they adapt, the higher they will climb. Therefore, the bosses are slick people. If someone needs to ignite hope, he gives people hope, someone needs money, he gives people money, someone needs beauty, and he doesn't have beauty, so he will look for beauty. The boss is a person who creates conditions for others to give full play to their strengths.\\n\\nNormally, there are few people he adapts to, so he can only be at the bottom of society. To be a boss, you must be wronged, and ordinary people such as technicians and artists often\\n\\nI think that Laozi is the number one in the world and can't stand grievances, so he can't be the boss. Who is better to be a boss or an ordinary person? Think about it yourself, but as a person,\\n\\nI hope everyone will think about three questions!\\n\\n1. What do you have now?\\n2. What do you want?\\n3. What are you willing to give up? When you ask yourself these three questions clearly, you know that you should choose to be the boss?\\n\\nStill have to choose to be an ordinary person. Of course, I’m talking about entrepreneurship here. Of course I hope you choose to be the boss, because it’s good for the society.\\n\\nYes, you contribute more, to yourself, you enjoy more.\",\"timestamp\":1634794963,\"title\":\"The difference between the boss and ordinary people\"},\"digest\":\"lSrgxMowIEjFGt9DfFfKhHqAVS7yFsFOvpK645nor_M\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"0Vp-XNcyA2YqsXZBAydzx6MYo1uqiKM5eofOPbYOhKYsLf8oulGnq-FsFALRZgKoS9YEJ_TK11nAjAekXpHgMA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"lSrgxMowIEjFGt9DfFfKhHqAVS7yFsFOvpK645nor_M\"}"
