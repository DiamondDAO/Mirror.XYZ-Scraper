"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"My dream was to become a writer. In my job search, I tried to get a job at a publishing company. But I decided not to apply.\\nIn my home country, Japan, the number of books published is decreasing every year, replaced by more visualized content. The old supply chain of family company publishers, distributors, and bookstores monopolizes much of the profit, with novelists receiving only less than 10%. As a result, even the most popular writers are paid far less than other professions. Countless writers work long hours and live below the average income.\\nWeb articles, on the other hand, are expected to produce a large number of poorly written articles with eye-catching titles and content, because PV numbers lead to revenue. In addition, many articles are written by university student interns, and a public company have withdrawn from the media business after being bashed for publishing articles with unclear citations or false content.\\n<https://www.wsj.com/articles/japans-dena-shelves-information-sites-after-criticism-over-accuracy-1480593544>\\n\\nWhy is this the case? Is there a case for an online advertising model or a subscription model that works well?\\n\\nI love Substack.\\nI also send out a weekly newsletter to my Japanese readers that summarizes the top tier VC investments in the Bay Area. <https://toptier.substack.com/>\\n\\nBeyond that, there are web3 \\\"creator communities\\\" like Mirror and ForeFront. I don't dare call them platforms.\\nBy holding tokens, creators themselves become share holders of the community, and can think about and create the direction of the community and the rights regarding revenue.\\nOf course, we are still in the development stage, and tokens will be bought and sold on the market, and may be driven by speculative momentum.\\nHowever, I believe that with time, there will come a world where only those who really want to be part of this community, only those who want to read and write this article, will own it.\\n\\nI also get a token for writing this article, and I can belong to the community. By continuing to write articles, I can also fulfill an old dream of mine, albeit part-time.\\nI am looking forward to the future.\",\"timestamp\":1637001022,\"title\":\"Why do we need Mirror.xyz?\"},\"digest\":\"69VeKL0FbhSolj_eT7WqANfdQDV0eMifSKcF4nUz5TA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD30Fb00c2796cBAD72f6B9C410830Dc4FF05bA71\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"iww9uQIMQMziCMMkfjgw4kCTxur1Q4Xr7YDdbDUJHQY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ylusCGbSQ_fjHIuXBaXXg5-lIOlo-detnFrb76Nn7Xc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"9ljdzJwvnx-LM7TzxFqcyV-Xs80JLzdR3sdcjihCZDR9yJo8Vn-ar_eXckpjBmTT6NHMwrd_AjyHBEV89Pl6Jw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xec0440b2667657a4a87ba5b8b0cbc78eeceb2e5e388cd6a231d6bdc71aa9c80a7949d8810bed3cba3e76c82d56c2222d7a6dbfcd514406ad0433dd56242745b31b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"iww9uQIMQMziCMMkfjgw4kCTxur1Q4Xr7YDdbDUJHQY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ylusCGbSQ_fjHIuXBaXXg5-lIOlo-detnFrb76Nn7Xc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"69VeKL0FbhSolj_eT7WqANfdQDV0eMifSKcF4nUz5TA\"}"
