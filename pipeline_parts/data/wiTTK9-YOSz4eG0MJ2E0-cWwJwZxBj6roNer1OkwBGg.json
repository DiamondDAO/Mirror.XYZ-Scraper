"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"that it would be possible to write a kind of bibliomaniac\\nhistory of that country.  All her rulers, kings, cardinals, and\\nladies have had time to spare for collecting.  Without going too far\\nback, to the time when Bertha span and Charlemagne was an amateur,\\nwe may give a few specimens of an anecdotical history of French\\nbibliolatry, beginning, as is courteous, with a lady.  \\\"Can a woman\\nbe a bibliophile?\\\" is a question which was once discussed at the\\nweekly breakfast party of Guilbert de Pixerecourt, the famous book-\\nlover and playwright, the \\\"Corneille of the Boulevards.\\\"  The\\ncontroversy glided into a discussion as to \\\"how many books a man can\\nlove at a time;\\\" but historical examples prove that French women\\n(and Italian, witness the Princess d'Este) may be bibliophiles of\\nthe true strain.  Diane de Poictiers was their illustrious\\npatroness.  The mistress of Henri II. possessed, in the Chateau\\nd'Anet, a library of the first triumphs of typography.  Her taste\\nwas wide in range, including songs, plays, romances, divinity; her\\ncopies of the Fathers were bound in citron morocco, stamped with her\\narms and devices, and closed with clasps of silver.  In the love of\\nbooks, as in everything else, Diane and Henri II. were inseparable.\\nThe interlaced H and D are scattered over the covers of their\\nvolumes; the lily of France is twined round the crescents of Diane,\\nor round the quiver, the arrows, and the bow which she adopted as\\nher cognisance, in honour of the maiden goddess.  The books of Henri\\nand of Diane remained in the Chateau d'Anet till the death of the\\nPrincesse de Conde in 1723, when they were dispersed.  The son of\\nthe famous Madame de Guyon bought the greater part of the library,\\nwhich has since been scattered again and again.  M. Leopold Double,\\na well-known bibliophile, possessed several examples. {15}\\n\\nHenry III. scarcely deserves, perhaps, the name of a book-lover, for\\nhe probably never read the works which were bound for him in the\\nmost elaborate way.  But that great historian, Alexandre Dumas,\\ntakes a far more friendly view of the king's studies, and, in 'La\\nDame de Monsoreau,' introduces us to a learned monarch.  Whether he\\ncared for the contents of his books or not, his books are among the\\nmost singular relics of a character which excites even morbid\\ncuriosity.  No more debauched and worthless wretch ever filled a\\nthrone; but, like the bad man in Aristotle, Henri III. was \\\"full of\\nrepentance.\\\"  When he was not dancing in an unseemly revel, he was\\non his knees in his chapel.  The board of one of his books, of which\\nan engraving lies before me, bears his cipher and crown in the\\ncorners; but the centre is occupied in front with a picture of the\\nAnnunciation, while on the back is the crucifixion and the breeding\\nheart through which the swords have pierced.  His favourite device\\nwas the death's-head, with the motto Memento Mori, or Spes mea Deus.\\nWhile he was still only Duc d'Anjou, Henri loved Marie de Cleves,\\nPrincesse de Conde.  On her sudden death he expressed his grief, as\\nhe had done his piety, by aid of the petits fers of the bookbinder.\\nMarie's initials were stamped on his book-covers in a chaplet of\\nlaurels.  In one corner a skull and cross-bones were figured; in the\\nother the motto Mort m'est vie; while two curly objects, which did\\nduty for tears, filled up the lower corners.  The books of Henri\\nIII., even when they are absolutely worthless as literature, sell\\nfor high prices; and an inane treatise on theology, decorated with\\nhis sacred emblems, lately brought about 120 pounds in a London\\nsale.\\n\\nFrancis I., as a patron of all the arts, was naturally an amateur of\\nbindings.  The fates of books were curiously illustrated by the\\nstory of the copy of Homer, on large paper, which Aldus, the great\\nVenetian printer, presented to Francis I.  After the death of the\\nlate Marquis of Hastings, better known as an owner of horses than of\\nbooks, his possessions were brought to the hammer.  With the\\ninstinct, the flair, as the French say, of the bibliophile, M.\\nAmbroise Firmin Didot, the biographer of Aldus, guessed that the\\nmarquis might have owned something in his line.  He sent his agent\\nover to England, to the country town where the sale was to be held.\\nM. Didot had his reward.  Among the books which were dragged out of\\nsome mouldy store-room was the very Aldine Homer of Francis I., with\\npart of the original binding still clinging to the leaves.  M. Didot\\npurchased the precious relic, and sent it to what M. Fertiault (who\\nhas written a century of sonnets on bibliomania) calls the hospital\\nfor books.\\n\\nLe dos humide, je l'eponge;\\nOu manque un coin, vite une allonge,\\nPour tous j'ai maison de sante.\\n\\nM. Didot, of course, did not practise this amateur surgery himself,\\nbut had the arms and devices of Francis I. restored by one of those\\nfamous binders who only work for dukes, millionnaires, and\\nRothschilds.\\n\\nDuring the religious wars and the troubles of the Fronde, it is\\nprobable that few people gave much time to the collection of books.\\nThe illustrious exceptions are Richelieu and Cardinal Mazarin, who\\npossessed a \\\"snuffy Davy\\\" of his own, an indefatigable prowler among\\nbook-stalls and dingy purlieus, in Gabriel Naude.  In 1664, Naude,\\nwho was a learned and ingenious writer, the apologist for \\\"great men\\nsuspected of magic,\\\" published the second edition of his 'Avis pour\\ndresser une Bibliotheque,' and proved himself to be a true lover of\\nthe chase, a mighty hunter (of books) before the Lord.  Naude's\\nadvice to the collector is rather amusing.  He pretends not to care\\nmuch for bindings, and quotes Seneca's rebuke of the Roman\\nbibliomaniacs, Quos voluminum suorum frontes maxime placent\\ntitulique,--who chiefly care for the backs and lettering of their\\nvolumes.  The fact is that Naude had the wealth of Mazarin at his\\nback, and we know very well, from the remains of the Cardinal's\\nlibrary which exist, that he liked as well as any man to see his\\ncardinal's hat glittering on red or olive morocco in the midst of\\nthe beautiful tooling of the early seventeenth century.  When once\\nhe got a book, he would not spare to give it a worthy jacket.\\nNaude's ideas about buying were peculiar.  Perhaps he sailed rather\\nnearer the wind than even Monkbarns would have cared to do.  His\\nfavourite plan was to buy up whole libraries in the gross,\\n\\\"speculative lots\\\" as the dealers call them.  In the second place,\\nhe advised the book-lover to haunt the retreats of Libraires\\nfripiers, et les vieux fonds et magasins.  Here he truly observes\\nthat you may find rare books, broches,--that is, unbound and uncut,-\\n\\\\-just as Mr. Symonds bought two uncut copies of 'Laon and Cythna' in\\na Bristol stall for a crown.  \\\"You may get things for four or five\\ncrowns that would cost you forty or fifty elsewhere,\\\" says Naude.\\nThus a few years ago M. Paul Lacroix bought for two francs, in a\\nParis shop, the very copy of 'Tartuffe' which had belonged to Louis\\nXIV.  The example may now be worth perhaps 200 pounds.  But we are\\ndigressing into the pleasures of the modern sportsman.\\n\\nIt was not only in second-hand bookshops that Naude hunted, but\\namong the dealers in waste paper.  \\\"Thus did Poggio find Quintilian\\non the counter of a wood-merchant, and Masson picked up 'Agobardus'\\nat the shop of a binder, who was going to use the MS. to patch his\\nbooks withal.\\\"  Rossi, who may have seen Naude at work, tells us how\\nhe would enter a shop with a yard-measure in his hand, buying books,\\nwe are sorry to say, by the ell.  \\\"The stalls where he had passed\\nwere like the towns through which Attila or the Tartars had swept,\\nwith ruin in their train,--ut non hominis unius sedulitas, sed\\ncalamitas quaedam per omnes bibliopolarum tabernas pervasisse\\nvideatur!\\\"  Naude had sorrows of his own.  In 1652 the Parliament\\ndecreed the confiscation of the splendid library of Mazarin, which\\nwas perhaps the first free library in Europe,--the first that was\\nopen to all who were worthy of right of entrance.  There is a\\npainful description of the sale, from which the book-lover will\\navert his eyes.  On Mazarin's return to power he managed to collect\\nagain and enrich his stores, which form the germ of the existing\\nBibliotheque Mazarine.\\n\\nAmong princes and popes it is pleasant to meet one man of letters,\\nand he the greatest of the great age, who was a bibliophile.  The\\nenemies and rivals of Moliere--De Vise, De Villiers, and the rest--\\nare always reproaching him--with his love of bouquins.  There is\\nsome difference of opinion among philologists about the derivation\\nof bouquin, but all book-hunters know the meaning of the word.  The\\nbouquin is the \\\"small, rare volume, black with tarnished gold,\\\"\\nwhich lies among the wares of the stall-keeper, patient in rain and\\ndust, till the hunter comes who can appreciate the quarry.  We like\\nto think of Moliere lounging through the narrow streets in the\\nevening, returning, perhaps, from some noble house where he has been\\nreading the proscribed 'Tartuffe,' or giving an imitation of the\\nrival actors at the Hotel Bourgogne.  Absent as the contemplateur\\nis, a dingy book-stall wakens him from his reverie.  His lace\\nruffles are soiled in a moment with the learned dust of ancient\\nvolumes.  Perhaps he picks up the only work out of all his library\\nthat is known to exist,--un ravissant petit Elzevir, 'De Imperio\\nMagni Mogolis' (Lugd.  Bat. 1651).  On the title-page of this tiny\\nvolume, one of the minute series of 'Republics' which the Elzevirs\\npublished, the poet has written his rare signature, \\\"J. B. P.\\nMoliere,\\\" with the price the book cost him, \\\"1 livre, 10 sols.\\\"  \\\"Il\\nn'est pas de bouquin qui s'echappe de ses mains,\\\" says the author of\\n'La Guerre Comique,' the last of the pamphlets which flew about\\nduring the great literary quarrel about \\\"L'Ecole des Femmes.\\\"\\nThanks to M. Soulie the catalogue of Moliere's library has been\\nfound, though the books themselves have passed out of view.  There\\nare about three hundred and fifty volumes in the inventory, but\\nMoliere's widow may have omitted as valueless (it is the foible of\\nher sex) many rusty bouquins, now worth far more than their weight\\nin gold.  Moliere owned no fewer than two hundred and forty volumes\\nof French and Italian comedies.  From these he took what suited him\\nwherever he found it.  He had plenty of classics, histories,\\nphilosophic treatises, the essays of Montaigne, a Plutarch, and a\\nBible.\\n\\nWe know nothing, to the regret of bibliophiles, of Moliere's taste\\nin bindings.  Did he have a comic mask stamped on the leather (that\\ndevice was chased on his plate), or did he display his cognizance\\nand arms, the two apes that support a shield charged with three\\nmirrors of Truth?  It is certain--La Bruyere tells us as much--that\\nthe sillier sort of book-lover in the seventeenth century was much\\nthe same sort of person as his successor in our own time.  \\\"A man\\ntells me he has a library,\\\" says La Bruyere (De la Mode); \\\"I ask\\npermission to see it.  I go to visit my friend, and he receives me\\nin a house where, even on the stairs, the smell of the black morocco\\nwith which his books are covered is so strong that I nearly faint.\\nHe does his best to revive me; shouts in my ear that the volumes\\n'have gilt edges,' that they are 'elegantly tooled,' that they are\\n'of the good edition,' . . . and informs me that 'he never reads,'\\nthat 'he never sets foot in this part of his house,' that he 'will\\ncome to oblige me!'  I thank him for all his kindness, and have no\\nmore desire than himself to see the tanner's shop that he calls his\\nlibrary.\\\"\\n\\nColbert, the great minister of Louis XIV., was a bibliophile at whom\\nperhaps La Bruyere would have sneered.  He was a collector who did\\nnot read, but who amassed beautiful books, and looked forward, as\\nbusiness men do, to the day when he would have time to study them.\\nAfter Grolier, De Thou, and Mazarin, Colbert possessed probably the\\nrichest private library in Europe.  The ambassadors of France were\\ncharged to procure him rare books and manuscripts, and it is said\\nthat in a commercial treaty with the Porte he inserted a clause\\ndemanding a certain quantity of Levant morocco for the use of the\\nroyal bookbinders.  England, in those days, had no literature with\\nwhich France deigned to be acquainted.  Even into England, however,\\nvaluable books had been imported; and we find Colbert pressing the\\nFrench ambassador at St. James's to bid for him at a certain sale of\\nrare heretical writings.  People who wanted to gain his favour\\napproached him with presents of books, and the city of Metz gave him\\ntwo real curiosities--the famous \\\"Metz Bible\\\" and the Missal of\\nCharles the Bald.  The Elzevirs sent him their best examples, and\\nthough Colbert probably saw more of the gilt covers of his books\\nthan of their contents, at least he preserved and handed down many\\nvaluable works.  As much may be said for the reprobate Cardinal\\nDubois, who, with all his faults, was a collector.  Bossuet, on the\\nother hand, left little or nothing of interest except a copy of the\\n1682 edition of Moliere, whom he detested and condemned to \\\"the\\npunishment of those who laugh.\\\"  Even this book, which has a curious\\ninterest, has slipped out of sight, and may have ceased to exist.\\n\\nIf Colbert and Dubois preserved books from destruction, there are\\ncollectors enough who have been rescued from oblivion by books.  The\\ndiplomacy of D'Hoym is forgotten; the plays of Longepierre, and his\\nquarrels with J. B. Rousseau, are known only to the literary\\nhistorian.  These great amateurs have secured an eternity of gilt\\nedges, an immortality of morocco.  Absurd prices are given for any\\ntrash that belonged to them, and the writer of this notice has\\nbought for four shillings an Elzevir classic, which when it bears\\nthe golden fleece of Longepierre is worth about 100 pounds.\\nLongepierre, D'Hoym, McCarthy, and the Duc de la Valliere, with all\\ntheir treasures, are less interesting to us than Graille, Coche and\\nLoque, the neglected daughters of Louis XV.  They found some pale\\nconsolation in their little cabinets of books, in their various\\nliveries of olive, citron, and red morocco.\\n\\nA lady amateur of high (book-collecting) reputation, the Comtesse de\\nVerrue, was represented in the Beckford sale by one of three copies\\nof 'L'Histoire de Melusine,' of Melusine, the twy-formed fairy, and\\nancestress of the house of Lusignan.  The Comtesse de Verrue, one of\\nthe few women who have really understood book-collecting, {16} was\\nborn January 18, 1670, and died November 18, 1736.  She was the\\ndaughter of Charles de Luynes and of his second wife, Anne de Rohan.\\nWhen only thirteen she married the Comte de Verrue, who somewhat\\ninjudiciously presented her, a fleur de quinze ans, as Ronsard says,\\nat the court of Victor Amadeus of Savoy.  It is thought that the\\ncountess was less cruel than the fleur Angevine of Ronsard.  For\\nsome reason the young matron fled from the court of Turin and\\nreturned to Paris, where she built a magnificent hotel, and received\\nthe most distinguished company.  According to her biographer, the\\ncountess loved science and art jusqu'au delire, and she collected\\nthe furniture of the period, without neglecting the blue china of\\nthe glowing Orient.  In ebony bookcases she possessed about eighteen\\nthousand volumes, bound by the greatest artists of the day.\\n\\\"Without care for the present, without fear of the future, doing\\ngood, pursuing the beautiful, protecting the arts, with a tender\\nheart and open hand, the countess passed through life, calm, happy,\\nbeloved, and admired.\\\"  She left an epitaph on herself, thus rudely\\ntranslated:-\\n\\nHere lies, in sleep secure,\\nA dame inclined to mirth,\\nWho, by way of making sure,\\nChose her Paradise on earth.\\n\\nDuring the Revolution, to like well-bound books was as much as to\\nproclaim one an aristocrat.  Condorcet might have escaped the\\nscaffold if he had only thrown away the neat little Horace from the\\nroyal press, which betrayed him for no true Republican, but an\\neducated man.  The great libraries from the chateaux of the nobles\\nwere scattered among all the book-stalls.  True sons of freedom tore\\noff the bindings, with their gilded crests and scutcheons.  One\\nrevolutionary writer declared, and perhaps he was not far wrong,\\nthat the art of binding was the worst enemy of reading.  He always\\nbegan his studies by breaking the backs of the volumes he was about\\nto attack.  The art of bookbinding in these sad years took flight to\\nEngland, and was kept alive by artists robust rather than refined,\\nlike Thompson and Roger Payne.  These were evil days, when the\\nbinder had to cut the aristocratic coat of arms out of a book cover,\\nand glue in a gilt cap of liberty, as in a volume in an Oxford\\namateur's collection.\\n\\nWhen Napoleon became Emperor, he strove in vain to make the troubled\\nand feverish years of his power produce a literature.  He himself\\nwas one of the most voracious readers of novels that ever lived.  He\\nwas always asking for the newest of the new, and unfortunately even\\nthe new romances of his period were hopelessly bad.  Barbier, his\\nlibrarian, had orders to send parcels of fresh fiction to his\\nmajesty wherever he might happen to be, and great loads of novels\\nfollowed Napoleon to Germany, Spain, Italy, Russia.  The conqueror\\nwas very hard to please.  He read in his travelling carriage, and\\nafter skimming a few pages would throw a volume that bored him out\\nof the window into the highway.  He might have been tracked by his\\ntrail of romances, as was Hop-o'-my-Thumb, in the fairy tale, by the\\nwhite stones he dropped behind him.  Poor Barbier, who ministered to\\na passion for novels that demanded twenty volumes a day, was at his\\nwit's end.  He tried to foist on the Emperor the romances of the\\nyear before last; but these Napoleon had generally read, and he\\nrefused, with imperial scorn, to look at them again.  He ordered a\\ntravelling library of three thousand volumes to be made for him, but\\nit was proved that the task could not be accomplished in less than\\nsix years.  The expense, if only fifty copies of each example had\\nbeen printed, would have amounted to more than six million francs.\\nA Roman emperor would not have allowed these considerations to stand\\nin his way; but Napoleon, after all, was a modern.  He contented\\nhimself with a selection of books conveniently small in shape, and\\npacked in sumptuous cases.  The classical writers of France could\\nnever content Napoleon, and even from Moscow in 1812, he wrote to\\nBarbier clamorous for new books, and good ones.  Long before they\\ncould have reached Moscow, Napoleon was flying homeward before\\nKotousoff and Benningsen.\\n\\nNapoleon was the last of the book-lovers who governed France.  The\\nDuc d'Aumale, a famous bibliophile, has never \\\"come to his own,\\\" and\\nof M. Gambetta it is only known that his devotional library, at\\nleast, has found its way into the market.  We have reached the era\\nof private book-fanciers:  of Nodier, who had three libraries in his\\ntime, but never a Virgil; and of Pixerecourt, the dramatist, who\\nfounded the Societe des Bibliophiles Francais.  The Romantic\\nmovement in French literature brought in some new fashions in book-\\nhunting.  The original editions of Ronsard, Des Portes, Belleau, and\\nDu Bellay became invaluable; while the writings of Gautier, Petrus\\nBorel, and others excited the passion of collectors.  Pixerecourt\\nwas a believer in the works of the Elzevirs.  On one occasion, when\\nhe was outbid by a friend at an auction, he cried passionately, \\\"I\\nshall have that book at your sale!\\\" and, the other poor bibliophile\\nsoon falling into a decline and dying, Pixerecourt got the volume\\nwhich he so much desired.  The superstitious might have been excused\\nfor crediting him with the gift of jettatura,--of the evil eye.  On\\nPixerecourt himself the evil eye fell at last; his theatre, the\\nGaiete, was burned down in 1835, and his creditors intended to\\nimpound his beloved books.  The bibliophile hastily packed them in\\nboxes, and conveyed them in two cabs and under cover of night to the\\nhouse of M. Paul Lacroix.  There they languished in exile till the\\naffairs of the manager were settled.\\n\\nPixerecourt and Nodier, the most reckless of men, were the leaders\\nof the older school of bibliomaniacs.  The former was not a rich\\nman; the second was poor, but he never hesitated in face of a price\\nthat he could not afford.  He would literally ruin himself in the\\naccumulation of a library, and then would recover his fortunes by\\nselling his books.  Nodier passed through life without a Virgil,\\nbecause he never succeeded in finding the ideal Virgil of his\\ndreams,--a clean, uncut copy of the right Elzevir edition, with the\\nmisprint, and the two passages in red letters.  Perhaps this failure\\nwas a judgment on him for the trick by which he beguiled a certain\\ncollector of Bibles.  He INVENTED an edition, and put the collector\\non the scent, which he followed vainly, till he died of the sickness\\nof hope deferred.\\n\\nOne has more sympathy with the eccentricities of Nodier than with\\nthe mere extravagance of the new haute ecole of bibliomaniacs, the\\nschool of millionnaires, royal dukes, and Rothschilds.  These\\namateurs are reckless of prices, and by their competition have made\\nit almost impossible for a poor man to buy a precious book.  The\\ndukes, the Americans, the public libraries, snap them all up in the\\nauctions.  A glance at M. Gustave Brunet's little volume, 'La\\nBibliomanie en 1878,' will prove the excesses which these people\\ncommit.  The funeral oration of Bossuet over Henriette Marie of\\nFrance (1669), and Henriette Anne of England (1670), quarto, in the\\noriginal binding, are sold for 200 pounds.  It is true that this\\ncopy had possibly belonged to Bossuet himself, and certainly to his\\nnephew.  There is an example, as we have seen, of the 1682 edition\\nof Moliere,--of Moliere whom Bossuet detested,--which also belonged\\nto the eagle of Meaux.  The manuscript notes of the divine on the\\nwork of the poor player must be edifying, and in the interests of\\nscience it is to be hoped that this book may soon come into the\\nmarket.  While pamphlets of Bossuet are sold so dear, the first\\nedition of Homer--the beautiful edition of 1488, which the three\\nyoung Florentine gentlemen published--may be had for 100 pounds.\\nYet even that seems expensive, when we remember that the copy in the\\nlibrary of George III. cost only seven shillings.  This exquisite\\nHomer, sacred to the memory of learned friendships, the chief\\noffering of early printing at the altar of ancient poetry, is really\\none of the most interesting books in the world.  Yet this Homer is\\nless valued than the tiny octavo which contains the ballades and\\nhuitains of the scamp Francois Villon (1533).  'The History of the\\nHoly Grail' (L'Hystoire du Sainct Greaal:  Paris, 1523), in a\\nbinding stamped with the four crowns of Louis XIV., is valued at\\nabout 500 pounds.  A chivalric romance of the old days, which was\\ntreasured even in the time of the grand monarque, when old French\\nliterature was so much despised, is certainly a curiosity.  The\\nRabelais of Madame de Pompadour (in morocco) seems comparatively\\ncheap at 60 pounds.  There is something piquant in the idea of\\ninheriting from that famous beauty the work of the colossal genius\\nof Rabelais. {17}\\n\\nThe natural sympathy of collectors \\\"to middle fortune born\\\" is not\\nwith the rich men whose sport in book-hunting resembles the battue.\\nWe side with the poor hunters of the wild game, who hang over the\\nfourpenny stalls on the quais, and dive into the dusty boxes after\\nliterary pearls.  These devoted men rise betimes, and hurry to the\\nstalls before the common tide of passengers goes by.  Early morning\\nis the best moment in this, as in other sports.  At half past seven,\\nin summer, the bouquiniste, the dealer in cheap volumes at second-\\nhand, arrays the books which he purchased over night, the stray\\npossessions of ruined families, the outcasts of libraries.  The old-\\nfashioned bookseller knew little of the value of his wares; it was\\nhis object to turn a small certain profit on his expenditure.  It is\\nreckoned that an energetic, business-like old bookseller will turn\\nover 150,000 volumes in a year.  In this vast number there must be\\npickings for the humble collector who cannot afford to encounter the\\nchildren of Israel at Sotheby's or at the Hotel Drouot.\\n\\nLet the enthusiast, in conclusion, throw a handful of lilies on the\\ngrave of the martyr of the love of books,--the poet Albert Glatigny.\\nPoor Glatigny was the son of a garde champetre; his education was\\naccidental, and his poetic taste and skill extraordinarily fine and\\ndelicate.  In his life of starvation (he had often to sleep in\\nomnibuses and railway stations), he frequently spent the price of a\\ndinner on a new book.  He lived to read and to dream, and if he\\nbought books he had not the wherewithal to live.  Still, he bought\\nthem,--and he died!  His own poems were beautifully printed by\\nLemerre, and it may be a joy to him (si mentem mortalia tangunt)\\nthat they are now so highly valued that the price of a copy would\\nhave kept the author alive and happy for a month.\\n\\nOLD FRENCH TITLE-PAGES\\n\\nNothing can be plainer, as a rule, than a modern English title-page.\\nIts only beauty (if beauty it possesses) consists in the arrangement\\nand 'massing' of lines of type in various sizes.  We have returned\\nalmost to the primitive simplicity of the oldest printed books,\\nwhich had no title-pages, properly speaking, at all, or merely gave,\\nwith extreme brevity, the name of the work, without printer's mark,\\nor date, or place.  These were reserved for the colophon, if it was\\nthought desirable to mention them at all.  Thus, in the black-letter\\nexample of Guido de Columna's 'History of Troy,' written about 1283,\\nand printed at Strasburg in 1489, the title-page is blank, except\\nfor the words,\\n\\nHystoria Troiana Guidonis,\\n\\nstanding alone at the top of the leaf.  The colophon contains all\\nthe rest of the information, 'happily completed in the City of\\nStrasburg, in the year of Grace Mcccclxxxix, about the Feast of St.\\nUrban.'  The printer and publisher give no name at all.\\n\\nThis early simplicity is succeeded, in French books, from, say,\\n1510, and afterwards, by the insertion either of the printer's\\ntrademark, or, in black-letter books, of a rough woodcut,\\nillustrative of the nature of the volume.  The woodcuts have\\noccasionally a rude kind of grace, with a touch of the classical\\ntaste of the early Renaissance surviving in extreme decay.\\n\\n\\\\[Illustration with title page:  Les demandes tamours auec les\\nrefpofesioyeufes.
