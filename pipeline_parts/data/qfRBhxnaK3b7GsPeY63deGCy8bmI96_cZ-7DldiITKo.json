"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"She had decided that it would be best to mention Dick Moore occasionally as an accepted fact, and not give undue morbidness to the subject by avoiding it.  She was right, for Leslie's air of constraint suddenly vanished.  Evidently she had been wondering how much Anne knew of the conditions of her life and was relieved that no explanations were needed.  She allowed her cap and jacket to be taken, and sat down with a girlish snuggle in the big armchair by Magog.  She was dressed prettily and carefully, with the customary touch of color in the scarlet geranium at her white throat.  Her beautiful hair gleamed like molten gold in the warm firelight.  Her sea-blue eyes were full of soft laughter and allurement. For the moment, under the influence of the little house of dreams, she was a girl again--a girl forgetful of the past and its bitterness.  The atmosphere of the many loves that had sanctified the little house was all about her; the companionship of two healthy, happy, young folks of her own generation encircled her; she felt and yielded to the magic of her surroundings--Miss Cornelia and Captain Jim would scarcely have recognized her; Anne found it hard to believe that this was the cold, unresponsive woman she had met on the shore--this animated girl who talked and listened with the eagerness of a starved soul.  And how hungrily Leslie's eyes looked at the bookcases between the windows!\\n\\n\\\"Our library isn't very extensive,\\\" said Anne, \\\"but every book in it is a FRIEND.  We've picked our books up through the years, here and there, never buying one until we had first read it and knew that it belonged to the race of Joseph.\\\"\\n\\nLeslie laughed--beautiful laughter that seemed akin to all the mirth that had echoed through the little house in the vanished years.\\n\\n\\\"I have a few books of father's--not many,\\\" she said.  \\\"I've read them until I know them almost by heart.  I don't get many books.  There's a circulating library at the Glen store--but I don't think the committee who pick the books for Mr. Parker know what books are of Joseph's race--or perhaps they don't care.  It was so seldom I got one I really liked that I gave up getting any.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hope you'll look on our bookshelves as your own,\\\" said Anne.\\n\\n\\\"You are entirely and wholeheartedly welcome to the loan of any book on them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are setting a feast of fat things before me,\\\" said Leslie, joyously.  Then, as the clock struck ten, she rose, half unwillingly.\\n\\n\\\"I must go.  I didn't realise it was so late.  Captain Jim is always saying it doesn't take long to stay an hour.  But I've stayed two--and oh, but I've enjoyed them,\\\" she added frankly.\\n\\n\\\"Come often,\\\" said Anne and Gilbert.  They had risen and stood together in the firelight's glow.  Leslie looked at them--youthful, hopeful, happy, typifying all she had missed and must forever miss.  The light went out of her face and eyes; the girl vanished; it was the sorrowful, cheated woman who answered the invitation almost coldly and got herself away with a pitiful haste.\\n\\nAnne watched her until she was lost in the shadows of the chill and misty night.  Then she turned slowly back to the glow of her own radiant hearthstone.\\n\\n\\\"Isn't she lovely, Gilbert?  Her hair fascinates me.  Miss Cornelia says it reaches to her feet.  Ruby Gillis had beautiful hair--but Leslie's is ALIVE--every thread of it is living gold.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She is very beautiful,\\\" agreed Gilbert, so heartily that Anne almost wished he were a LITTLE less enthusiastic.\\n\\n\\\"Gilbert, would you like my hair better if it were like Leslie's?\\\" she asked wistfully.\\n\\n\\\"I wouldn't have your hair any color but just what it is for the world,\\\" said Gilbert, with one or two convincing accompaniments.\\n\\nYou wouldn't be ANNE if you had golden hair--or hair of any color but\\\"--\\n\\n\\\"Red,\\\" said Anne, with gloomy satisfaction.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, red--to give warmth to that milk-white skin and those shining gray-green eyes of yours.  Golden hair wouldn't suit you at all Queen Anne--MY Queen Anne--queen of my heart and life and home.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then you may admire Leslie's all you like,\\\" said Anne magnanimously.\\n\\nCHAPTER 13\\n\\nA GHOSTLY EVENING\\n\\nOne evening, a week later, Anne decided to run over the fields to the house up the brook for an informal call.  It was an evening of gray fog that had crept in from the gulf, swathed the harbor, filled the glens and valleys, and clung heavily to the autumnal meadows.  Through it the sea sobbed and shuddered.  Anne saw Four Winds in a new aspect, and found it weird and mysterious and fascinating; but it also gave her a little feeling of loneliness.  Gilbert was away and would be away until the morrow, attending a medical pow-wow in Charlottetown.  Anne longed for an hour of fellowship with some girl friend.  Captain Jim and Miss Cornelia were \\\"good fellows\\\" each, in their own way; but youth yearned to youth.\\n\\n\\\"If only Diana or Phil or Pris or Stella could drop in for a chat,\\\" she said to herself, \\\"how delightful it would be!  This is such a GHOSTLY night.  I'm sure all the ships that ever sailed out of Four Winds to their doom could be seen tonight sailing up the harbor with their drowned crews on their decks, if that shrouding fog could suddenly be drawn aside.  I feel as if it concealed innumerable mysteries--as if I were surrounded by the wraiths of old generations of Four Winds people peering at me through that gray veil.  If ever the dear dead ladies of this little house came back to revisit it they would come on just such a night as this.  If I sit here any longer I'll see one of them there opposite me in Gilbert's chair.  This place isn't exactly canny tonight.  Even Gog and Magog have an air of pricking up their ears to hear the footsteps of unseen guests.  I'll run over to see Leslie before I frighten myself with my own fancies, as I did long ago in the matter of the Haunted Wood.  I'll leave my house of dreams to welcome back its old inhabitants.  My fire will give them my good-will and greeting--they will be gone before I come back, and my house will be mine once more.  Tonight I am sure it is keeping a tryst with the past.\\\"\\n\\nLaughing a little over her fancy, yet with something of a creepy sensation in the region of her spine, Anne kissed her hand to Gog and Magog and slipped out into the fog, with some of the new magazines under her arm for Leslie.\\n\\n\\\"Leslie's wild for books and magazines,\\\" Miss Cornelia had told her, \\\"and she hardly ever sees one.  She can't afford to buy them or subscribe for them.  She's really pitifully poor, Anne.  I don't see how she makes out to live at all on the little rent the farm brings in.  She never even hints a complaint on the score of poverty, but I know what it must be.  She's been handicapped by it all her life.  She didn't mind it when she was free and ambitious, but it must gall now, believe ME.  I'm glad she seemed so bright and merry the evening she spent with you.  Captain Jim told me he had fairly to put her cap and coat on and push her out of the door.  Don't be too long going to see her either.  If you are she'll think it's because you don't like the sight of Dick, and she'll crawl into her shell again.  Dick's a great, big, harmless baby, but that silly grin and chuckle of his do get on some people's nerves.  Thank goodness, I've no nerves myself.  I like Dick Moore better now than I ever did when he was in his right senses--though the Lord knows that isn't saying much.  I was down there one day in housecleaning time helping Leslie a bit, and I was frying doughnuts.  Dick was hanging round to get one, as usual, and all at once he picked up a scalding hot one I'd just fished out and dropped it on the back of my neck when I was bending over.  Then he laughed and laughed.  Believe ME, Anne, it took all the grace of God in my heart to keep me from just whisking up that stew-pan of boiling fat and pouring it over his head.\\\"\\n\\nAnne laughed over Miss Cornelia's wrath as she sped through the darkness.  But laughter accorded ill with that night.  She was sober enough when she reached the house among the willows.  Everything was very silent.  The front part of the house seemed dark and deserted, so Anne slipped round to the side door, which opened from the veranda into a little sitting room.  There she halted noiselessly.\\n\\nThe door was open.  Beyond, in the dimly lighted room, sat Leslie Moore, with her arms flung out on the table and her head bent upon them.  She was weeping horribly--with low, fierce, choking sobs, as if some agony in her soul were trying to tear itself out.  An old black dog was sitting by her, his nose resting on his lap, his big doggish eyes full of mute, imploring sympathy and devotion.  Anne drew back in dismay.  She felt that she could not intermeddle with this bitterness.  Her heart ached with a sympathy she might not utter.  To go in now would be to shut the door forever on any possible help or friendship.  Some instinct warned Anne that the proud, bitter girl would never forgive the one who thus surprised her in her abandonment of despair.\\n\\nAnne slipped noiselessly from the veranda and found her way across the yard.  Beyond, she heard voices in the gloom and saw the dim glow of a light.  At the gate she met two men--Captain Jim with a lantern, and another who she knew must be Dick Moore--a big man, badly gone to fat, with a broad, round, red face, and vacant eyes.  Even in the dull light Anne got the impression that there was something unusual about his eyes.\\n\\n\\\"Is this you, Mistress Blythe?\\\" said Captain Jim.  \\\"Now, now, you hadn't oughter be roaming about alone on a night like this.  You could get lost in this fog easier than not.  Jest you wait till I see Dick safe inside the door and I'll come back and light you over the fields.  I ain't going to have Dr. Blythe coming home and finding that you walked clean over Cape Leforce in the fog.  A woman did that once, forty years ago.\\n\\n\\\"So you've been over to see Leslie,\\\" he said, when he rejoined her.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't go in,\\\" said Anne, and told what she had seen.  Captain Jim sighed.\\n\\n\\\"Poor, poor, little girl!  She don't cry often, Mistress Blythe-- she's too brave for that.  She must feel terrible when she does cry.  A night like this is hard on poor women who have sorrows.  There's something about it that kinder brings up all we've suffered--or feared.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's full of ghosts,\\\" said Anne, with a shiver.  \\\"That was why I came over--I wanted to clasp a human hand and hear a human voice.\\n\\nThere seem to be so many INHUMAN presences about tonight.  Even my own dear house was full of them.  They fairly elbowed me out.  So I fled over here for companionship of my kind.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You were right not to go in, though, Mistress Blythe.  Leslie wouldn't have liked it.  She wouldn't have liked me going in with Dick, as I'd have done if I hadn't met you.  I had Dick down with me all day.  I keep him with me as much as I can to help Leslie a bit.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Isn't there something odd about his eyes?\\\" asked Anne.\\n\\n\\\"You noticed that?  Yes, one is blue and t'other is hazel--his father had the same.  It's a Moore peculiarity.  That was what told me he was Dick Moore when I saw him first down in Cuby.  If it hadn't a-bin for his eyes I mightn't a-known him, with his beard and fat.  You know, I reckon, that it was me found him and brought him home.  Miss Cornelia always says I shouldn't have done it, but I can't agree with her.  It was the RIGHT thing to do--and so 'twas the only thing.  There ain't no question in my mind about THAT.  But my old heart aches for Leslie.  She's only twenty-eight and she's eaten more bread with sorrow than most women do in eighty years.\\\"\\n\\nThey walked on in silence for a little while.  Presently Anne said, \\\"Do you know, Captain Jim, I never like walking with a lantern.  I have always the strangest feeling that just outside the circle of light, just over its edge in the darkness, I am surrounded by a ring of furtive, sinister things, watching me from the shadows with hostile eyes.  I've had that feeling from childhood.  What is the reason?  I never feel like that when I'm really in the darkness--when it is close all around me--I'm not the least frightened.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've something of that feeling myself,\\\" admitted Captain Jim.  \\\"I reckon when the darkness is close to us it is a friend.  But when we sorter push it away from us--divorce ourselves from it, so to speak, with lantern light--it becomes an enemy.  But the fog is lifting.\\n\\nThere's a smart west wind rising, if you notice.  The stars will be out when you get home.\\\"\\n\\nThey were out; and when Anne re-entered her house of dreams the red embers were still glowing on the hearth, and all the haunting presences were gone.\\n\\nCHAPTER 14\\n\\nNOVEMBER DAYS\\n\\nThe splendor of color which had glowed for weeks along the shores of Four Winds Harbor had faded out into the soft gray-blue of late autumnal hills.  There came many days when fields and shores were dim with misty rain, or shivering before the breath of a melancholy sea-wind--nights, too, of storm and tempest, when Anne sometimes wakened to pray that no ship might be beating up the grim north shore, for if it were so not even the great, faithful light whirling through the darkness unafraid, could avail to guide it into safe haven.\\n\\n\\\"In November I sometimes feel as if spring could never come again,\\\" she sighed, grieving over the hopeless unsightliness of her frosted and bedraggled flower-plots.  The gay little garden of the schoolmaster's bride was rather a forlorn place now, and the Lombardies and birches were under bare poles, as Captain Jim said.  But the fir-wood behind the little house was forever green and staunch; and even in November and December there came gracious days of sunshine and purple hazes, when the harbor danced and sparkled as blithely as in midsummer, and the gulf was so softly blue and tender that the storm and the wild wind seemed only things of a long-past dream.\\n\\nAnne and Gilbert spent many an autumn evening at the lighthouse.  It was always a cheery place.  Even when the east wind sang in minor and the sea was dead and gray, hints of sunshine seemed to be lurking all about it.  Perhaps this was because the First Mate always paraded it in panoply of gold.  He was so large and effulgent that one hardly missed the sun, and his resounding purrs formed a pleasant accompaniment to the laughter and conversation which went on around Captain Jim's fireplace.  Captain Jim and Gilbert had many long discussions and high converse on matters beyond the ken of cat or king.\\n\\n\\\"I like to ponder on all kinds of problems, though I can't solve 'em,\\\" said Captain Jim.  \\\"My father held that we should never talk of things we couldn't understand, but if we didn't, doctor, the subjects for conversation would be mighty few.  I reckon the gods laugh many a time to hear us, but what matters so long as we remember that we're only men and don't take to fancying that we're gods ourselves, really, knowing good and evil.  I reckon our pow- wows won't do us or anyone much harm, so let's have another whack at the whence, why and whither this evening, doctor.\\\"\\n\\nWhile they \\\"whacked,\\\" Anne listened or dreamed.  Sometimes Leslie went to the lighthouse with them, and she and Anne wandered along the shore in the eerie twilight, or sat on the rocks below the lighthouse until the darkness drove them back to the cheer of the driftwood fire.  Then Captain Jim would brew them tea and tell them\\n\\n```\\n  \\\"tales of land and sea     And whatsoever might betide   The great forgotten world outside.\\\"\\n```\\n\\nLeslie seemed always to enjoy those lighthouse carousals very much, and bloomed out for the time being into ready wit and beautiful laughter, or glowing-eyed silence.  There was a certain tang and savor in the conversation when Leslie was present which they missed when she was absent.  Even when she did not talk she seemed to inspire others to brilliancy.  Captain Jim told his stories better, Gilbert was quicker in argument and repartee, Anne felt little gushes and trickles of fancy and imagination bubbling to her lips under the influence of Leslie's personality.\\n\\n\\\"That girl was born to be a leader in social and intellectual circles, far away from Four Winds,\\\" she said to Gilbert as they walked home one night.  \\\"She's just wasted here--wasted.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Weren't you listening to Captain Jim and yours truly the other night when we discussed that subject generally?  We came to the comforting conclusion that the Creator probably knew how to run His universe quite as well as we do, and that, after all, there are no such things as `wasted' lives, saving and except when an individual wilfully squanders and wastes his own life--which Leslie Moore certainly hasn't done.  And some people might think that a Redmond B.A., whom editors were beginning to honor, was `wasted' as the wife of a struggling country doctor in the rural community of Four Winds.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Gilbert!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you had married Roy Gardner, now,\\\" continued Gilbert mercilessly, \\\"YOU could have been \\\\`a leader in social and intellectual circles far away from Four Winds.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Gilbert BLYTHE!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You KNOW you were in love with him at one time, Anne.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Gilbert, that's mean--\\\\`pisen mean, just like all the men,' as Miss Cornelia says.  I NEVER was in love with him.  I only imagined I was.  YOU know that.  You KNOW I'd rather be your wife in our house of dreams and fulfillment than a queen in a palace.\\\"\\n\\nGilbert's answer was not in words; but I am afraid that both of them forgot poor Leslie speeding her lonely way across the fields to a house that was neither a palace nor the fulfillment of a dream.\\n\\nThe moon was rising over the sad, dark sea behind them and transfiguring it.  Her light had not yet reached the harbor, the further side of which was shadowy and suggestive, with dim coves and rich glooms and jewelling lights.\\n\\n\\\"How the home lights shine out tonight through the dark!\\\" said Anne.  \\\"That string of them over the harbor looks like a necklace.  And what a coruscation there is up at the Glen!  Oh, look, Gilbert; there is ours.  I'm so glad we left it burning.  I hate to come home to a dark house.  OUR homelight, Gilbert!  Isn't it lovely to see?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Just one of earth's many millions of homes, Anne--girl--but ours-- OURS--our beacon in \\\\`a naughty world.'  When a fellow has a home and a dear, little, red-haired wife in it what more need he ask of life?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, he might ask ONE thing more,\\\" whispered Anne happily.  \\\"Oh, Gilbert, it seems as if I just COULDN'T wait for the spring.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER 15\\n\\nCHRISTMAS AT FOUR WINDS\\n\\nAt first Anne and Gilbert talked of going home to Avonlea for Christmas; but eventually they decided to stay in Four Winds.  \\\"I want to spend the first Christmas of our life together in our own home,\\\" decreed Anne.\\n\\nSo it fell out that Marilla and Mrs. Rachel Lynde and the twins came to Four Winds for Christmas.  Marilla had the face of a woman who had circumnavigated the globe.  She had never been sixty miles away from home before; and she had never eaten a Christmas dinner anywhere save at Green Gables.\\n\\nMrs. Rachel had made and brought with her an enormous plum pudding.  Nothing could have convinced Mrs. Rachel that a college graduate of the younger generation could make a Christmas plum pudding properly; but she bestowed approval on Anne's house.\\n\\n\\\"Anne's a good housekeeper,\\\" she said to Marilla in the spare room the night of their arrival.  \\\"I've looked into her bread box and her scrap pail.  I always judge a housekeeper by those, that's what.  There's nothing in the pail that shouldn't have been thrown away, and no stale pieces in the bread box.  Of course, she was trained up with you--but, then, she went to college afterwards.  I notice she's got my tobacco stripe quilt on the bed here, and that big round braided mat of yours before her living-room fire.  It makes me feel right at home.\\\"\\n\\nAnne's first Christmas in her own house was as delightful as she could have wished.  The day was fine and bright; the first skim of snow had fallen on Christmas Eve and made the world beautiful; the harbor was still open and glittering.\\n\\nCaptain Jim and Miss Cornelia came to dinner.  Leslie and Dick had been invited, but Leslie made excuse; they always went to her Uncle Isaac West's for Christmas, she said.\\n\\n\\\"She'd rather have it so,\\\" Miss Cornelia told Anne.  \\\"She can't bear taking Dick where there are strangers.  Christmas is always a hard time for Leslie.  She and her father used to make a lot of it.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Cornelia and Mrs. Rachel did not take a very violent fancy to each other.  \\\"Two suns hold not their courses in one sphere.\\\"  But they did not clash at all, for Mrs. Rachel was in the kitchen helping Anne and Marilla with the dinner, and it fell to Gilbert to entertain Captain Jim and Miss Cornelia,--or rather to be entertained by them, for a dialogue between those two old friends and antagonists was assuredly never dull.\\n\\n\\\"It's many a year since there was a Christmas dinner here, Mistress Blythe,\\\" said Captain Jim.  \\\"Miss Russell always went to her friends in town for Christmas.  But I was here to the first Christmas dinner that was ever eaten in this house--and the schoolmaster's bride cooked it.  That was sixty years ago today, Mistress Blythe--and a day very like this--just enough snow to make the hills white, and the harbor as blue as June.  I was only a lad, and I'd never been invited out to dinner before, and I was too shy to eat enough.  I've got all over THAT.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Most men do,\\\" said Miss Cornelia, sewing furiously.  Miss Cornelia was not going to sit with idle hands, even on Christmas.\\n\\nBabies come without any consideration for holidays, and there was one expected in a poverty-stricken household at Glen St. Mary.  Miss Cornelia had sent that household a substantial dinner for its little swarm, and so meant to eat her own with a comfortable conscience.\\n\\n\\\"Well, you know, the way to a man's heart is through his stomach, Cornelia,\\\" explained Captain Jim.\\n\\n\\\"I believe you--when he HAS a heart,\\\" retorted Miss Cornelia.  \\\"I suppose that's why so many women kill themselves cooking--just as poor Amelia Baxter did.  She died last Christmas morning, and she said it was the first Christmas since she was married that she didn't have to cook a big, twenty-plate dinner.  It must have been a real pleasant change for her.  Well, she's been dead a year, so you'll soon hear of Horace Baxter taking notice.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I heard he was taking notice already,\\\" said Captain Jim, winking at Gilbert.  \\\"Wasn't he up to your place one Sunday lately, with his funeral blacks on, and a boiled collar?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, he wasn't.  And he needn't come neither.  I could have had him long ago when he was fresh.  I don't want any second-hand goods, believe ME.  As for Horace Baxter, he was in financial difficulties a year ago last summer, and he prayed to the Lord for help; and when his wife died and he got her life insurance he said he believed it was the answer to his prayer.  Wasn't that like a man?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have you really proof that he said that, Cornelia?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have the Methodist minister's word for it--if you call THAT proof.  Robert Baxter told me the same thing too, but I admit THAT isn't evidence.  Robert Baxter isn't often known to tell the truth.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come, come, Cornelia, I think he generally tells the truth, but he changes his opinion so often it sometimes sounds as if he didn't.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It sounds like it mighty often, believe ME.  But trust one man to excuse another.  I have no use for Robert Baxter.  He turned Methodist just because the Presbyterian choir happened to be singing \\\\`Behold the bridegroom cometh' for a collection piece when him and Margaret walked up the aisle the Sunday after they were married.  Served him right for being late!  He always insisted the choir did it on purpose to insult him, as if he was of that much importance.  But that family always thought they were much bigger potatoes than they really were.  His brother Eliphalet imagined the devil was always at his elbow--but *I* never believed the devil wasted that much time on him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I--don't--know,\\\" said Captain Jim thoughtfully.  \\\"Eliphalet Baxter lived too much alone--hadn't even a cat or dog to keep him human.  When a man is alone he's mighty apt to be with the devil--if he ain't with God.  He has to choose which company he'll keep, I reckon.  If the devil always was at Life Baxter's elbow it must have been because Life liked to have him there.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Man-like,\\\" said Miss Cornelia, and subsided into silence over a complicated arrangement of tucks until Captain Jim deliberately stirred her up again by remarking in a casual way:\\n\\n\\\"I was up to the Methodist church last Sunday morning.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You'd better have been home reading your Bible,\\\" was Miss Cornelia's retort.\\n\\n\\\"Come, now, Cornelia, *I* can't see any harm in going to the Methodist church when there's no preaching in your own.  I've been a Presbyterian for seventy-six years, and it isn't likely my theology will hoist anchor at this late day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's setting a bad example,\\\" said Miss Cornelia grimly.\\n\\n\\\"Besides,\\\" continued wicked Captain Jim, \\\"I wanted to hear some good singing.  The Methodists have a good choir; and you can't deny, Cornelia, that the singing in our church is awful since the split in the choir.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What if the singing isn't good?  They're doing their best, and God sees no difference between the voice of a crow and the voice of a nightingale.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come, come, Cornelia,\\\" said Captain Jim mildly, \\\"I've a better opinion of the Almighty's ear for music than THAT.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What caused the trouble in our choir?\\\" asked Gilbert, who was suffering from suppressed laughter.\",\"timestamp\":1639709812,\"title\":\"Of course it must be hard for you to leave Mr. Moore,\\\" said Anne, in a matter-of-fact tone\"},\"digest\":\"iprrfM0sAlKxQaL6xAkeEb3AyXFhIqFgcw3lb3MrJrk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa216D8906Acd104a8EC6a31f93e945DFe15768c1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"OVl7dAgAUHD1vWC8X8d_CjW96L6DAS4oxUDyn_xOUbM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"T9wD5z4P426vzVxyERlG924kogyWWCHf4lrQSczrXNs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"bl5lWETN8jeEoaSZiXZKp1TGoA2XcVxtRmzfaH-A54qB35vBkWynq2ulbMCRZg59XqjiNDoH_W8yagXXDgm2ag\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe5f33542d53bcfd3961d05b874a0634d28f0962e7eba574e26d5a470815f490d4b45959185c378986ca54408bd89b8fcf4faed62f1154bc7ff7bc52ce59482111b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"OVl7dAgAUHD1vWC8X8d_CjW96L6DAS4oxUDyn_xOUbM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"T9wD5z4P426vzVxyERlG924kogyWWCHf4lrQSczrXNs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"iprrfM0sAlKxQaL6xAkeEb3AyXFhIqFgcw3lb3MrJrk\"}"
