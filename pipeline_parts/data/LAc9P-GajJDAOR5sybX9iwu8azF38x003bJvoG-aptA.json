"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"Well,\\\" said Ayrault, finally, \\\"since we have nothing but\\nmotions to lay on the table, I move we adjourn.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The only motion I shall make,\\\" said Cortlandt, who was already\\nundressed, \\\"will be that of getting into bed,\\\" saying which, he\\nrolled himself in his blanket and soon was fast asleep.\\n\\nHaving decided that, on account of the proximity of the dragons,\\na man must in any event be on the watch, they did not set the\\nprotection-wires.  From the shortness of the nights, they divided\\nthem into only two watches of from two hours to two and a half\\neach, so that, even when constant watch duty was necessary, each\\nman had one full night's sleep in three.  On this occasion\\nAyrault and Cortlandt were the watchers, Cortlandt having the\\nmorning and Ayrault the evening watch.  Many curious quadruped\\nbirds, about the size of large bears, and similar in shape,\\nhaving bear-shaped heads, and several creatures that looked like\\nthe dragons, flew about them in the moonlight; but neither\\nwatcher fired a shot, as the creatures showed no desire to make\\nan attack.  All these species seemed to belong to the owl or bat\\ntribe, for they roamed abroad at night.\\n\\n```\\n                       CHAPTER V.\\n\\n                    AYRAULT'S VISION.\\n```\\n\\nWhen Ayrault's watch was ended, he roused Cortlandt, who took his\\nplace, and feeling a desire for solitude and for a last long look\\nat the earth, he crossed the top of the ridge on the slope of\\nwhich they had camped, and lay down on the farther side.  The\\nSouth wind in the upper air rushed along in the mighty whirl,\\noccasionally carrying filmy clouds across the faces of the moons;\\nbut about Ayrault all was still, and he felt a quiet and serene\\nrepose.  He had every intention of remaining awake, and was\\npondering on the steadfastness of the human heart and the\\nconstancy of love, when his meditations began to wander, and,\\nwith his last thoughts on Sylvia, he fell asleep.  Not a branch\\nmoved, nor did a leaf fall, yet before Ayrault's, sleeping eyes a\\nstrange scene was enacted.  A figure in white came near and stood\\nbefore him, and he recognized in it one Violet Slade, a very\\nattractive girl to whom he had been attentive in his college\\ndays.  She was at that time just eighteen, and people believed\\nthat she loved him, but for some reason, he knew not why, he had\\nnot proposed.\\n\\n\\\"I thought you had died,\\\" he said, as she gazed at him, \\\"but you\\nare now looking better than ever.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"From the world's point of view I AM dead,\\\" she replied.  \\\"I died\\nand was buried.  It is therefore permissible that I should show\\nyou the truth.  You never believed I loved you.  I have wished\\nearnestly to see you, and to have you know that I did.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I did you an injustice,\\\" Ayrault answered, perceiving all that\\nwas in her heart.  \\\"Could mortals but see as spirits do, there\\nwould be no misunderstandings.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am so glad to see you,\\\" she continued, \\\"and to know you are\\nwell.  Had you not come here, we could probably not have met\\nuntil after your death; for I shall not be sufficiently advanced\\nto return to earth for a long time, though my greatest solace\\nwhile there was my religion, which is all that brought me here.\\nWe, however, know that as our capacity for true happiness\\nincreases we shall be happier, and that after the resurrection\\nthere will be no more tears.  Farewell,\\\" she whispered, while her\\neyes were filled with love.\\n\\nAyrault's sleep was then undisturbed for some time, when suddenly\\nan angel, wreathed in light, appeared before him and spoke these\\nwords:  \\\"He that walked with Adam and talked with Moses has sent\\nme to guard you while you sleep.  No plague or fever, wild beast\\nor earthquake, can molest you, for you are equally protected from\\nthe most powerful monster and the most insidious disease-germ.\\n'Blessed is the man whose offences are covered and whose sins are\\nforgiven.'  Sleep on, therefore, and be refreshed, for the body\\nmust have rest.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A man may rest indeed,\\\" replied Ayrault, \\\"when he has a guardian\\nangel.  I had the most unbounded faith in your existence before I\\nsaw you, and believe and know that you or others have often\\nshielded me from danger and saved my life.  Why am I worthy of so\\nmuch care?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"'Whoso dwelleth under the defence of the Most High shall abide\\nunder the shadow of the Almighty,'\\\" answered the angel, and\\nthereupon he became invisible, a diffused light taking his place.\\nShortly afterwards this paled and completely vanished.\\n\\n\\\"Not only am I in paradise,\\\" thought Ayrault; \\\"I believe I am\\nalso in the seventh heaven.  Would I might hear such words\\nagain!\\\"\\n\\nA group of lilies then appeared before the sleeper's eyes.  In\\nthe midst was one lily far larger than the rest, and of a\\ndazzling white.  This spoke in a gentle voice, but with the tones\\nof a trombone:\\n\\n\\\"Thy thoughts and acts are a pleasure to me.  Thou hast raised no\\nidols within thy heart, and thy faith is as incense before me.\\nThy name is now in the Book of Life.  Continue as thou hast\\nbegun, and thou shalt live and reign forever.\\\"\\n\\nHereupon the earth shook, and Ayrault was awakened.  Great\\nboulders were rolling and crashing down the slope about him,\\nwhile the dawn was already in the east.\\n\\n\\\"My mortal eyes and senses are keener here while I sleep than\\nwhen I wake,\\\" he thought, as he looked about him, \\\"for spirits,\\nunable to affect me while waking, have made themselves felt in my\\nmore sensitive state while I was asleep.  Nevertheless, this is\\nnone other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.\\n\\n\\\"The boulders were still in motion when I opened my eyes,\\\" he\\nmused; \\\"can it be that there is hereabouts such a flower as in my\\ndreams I seemed to see?\\\" and looking beyond where his head had\\nlain, he beheld the identical lily surrounded by the group that\\nhis closed eyes had already seen.  Thereupon he uncovered his\\nhead and departed quickly.  Crossing the divide, he descended to\\ncamp, where he found Cortlandt in deep thought.\\n\\n\\\"I cannot get over the dreams,\\\" said the doctor, \\\"I had in the\\nfirst part of the night.  Notwithstanding yesterday's excitement\\nand fatigue, my sleep was most disturbed, and I was visited by\\nvisions of my wife, who died long ago.  She warned me against\\nskepticism, and seemed much distressed at my present spiritual\\nstate.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I,\\\" said Bearwarden, who had been out early, and had succeeded\\nin bringing in half a dozen birds, \\\"was so disturbed I could not\\nsleep.  It seemed to me as though half the men I have ever known\\ncame and warned me against agnosticism and my materialistic\\ntendencies.  They kept repeating, 'You are losing the reality for\\nthe shadow.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am convinced,\\\" said Ayrault, \\\"that they were not altogether\\ndreams, or, if dreams indeed, that they were superinduced by a\\nhigher will.  We know that angels have often appeared to men in\\nthe past.  May it not be that, as our appreciativeness increases,\\nthese communications will recur?\\\"  Thereupon he related his own\\nexperiences.\\n\\n\\\"The thing that surprised me,\\\" said Cortlandt, as they finished\\nbreakfast, \\\"was the extraordinary realism of the scene.  We must\\nsee if our visions return on anything but an empty stomach.\\\"\\n\\n```\\n                       CHAPTER VI.\\n\\n            A GREAT VOID AND A GREAT LONGING.\\n```\\n\\nResuming their march, the travellers proceeded along the\\ncircumference of a circle having a radius of about three miles,\\nwith the Callisto in the centre.  In crossing soft places they\\nobserved foot-prints forming in the earth all around them.  The\\nimpressions were of all sizes, and ceased when they reached\\nrising or hard ground, only to reappear in the swamps, regulating\\ntheir speed by that of the travellers. The three men were greatly\\nsurprised at this.\\n\\n\\\"You may observe,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"that the surface of the\\nimpression is depressed as you watch it, as though by a weight,\\nand you can see, and even hear, the water being squeezed out,\\nthough whatever is doing it is entirely invisible.  They must be\\nmade by spirits sufficiently advanced to have weight, but not\\nadvanced enough to make themselves visible.\\\"\\n\\nMoved by a species of vandalism, Bearwarden raised his\\ntwelve-bore, and fired an ordinary cartridge that he had not\\nprepared for the dragons, at the space directly over the nearest\\nforming prints.  There was a brilliant display of prismatic\\ncolours, as in a rainbow, and though the impressions already made\\nremained, no new ones were formed.\\n\\n\\\"Now you have done it!\\\" said Cortlandt.  \\\"I hoped to be able to\\ninvestigate this further.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We shall doubtless see other and perhaps more wonderful things,\\\"\\nreplied Bearwarden.  \\\"I must say this gives me an uncanny\\nfeeling.\\\"\\n\\nWhen they had completed a little over half their circle, they\\ncame upon another of the groves with which Saturn seemed to\\nabound, at the edge of which, in a side-hill, was a cave, the\\nentrance of which was composed of rocky masses that had\\napparently fallen together, the floor being but little higher\\nthan the surface outside.  The arched roof of the vestibule was\\nrendered watertight by the soil that had formed upon it, which\\nagain was overgrown by vines and bushes.\\n\\n\\\"This,\\\" said Bearwarden, \\\"will be a good place to camp, for the\\ncave will protect us from dragons, unless they should take a\\nnotion to breathe at us from the outside, and it will keep us dry\\nin case of rain.  To-morrow we can start with this as a centre,\\nand make another circuit.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We can explore Saturn on foot,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"and far more\\nthoroughly than Jupiter, on account of its comparative freedom\\nfrom monsters.  Not even the dragons can trouble us, unless we\\nmeet them in large numbers.\\\"\\n\\nThereupon they set about getting fuel for their fire.  Besides\\ncollecting some of the dead wood that was lying all about, they\\nsplit up a number of resinous pine and fir trees with explosive\\nbullets from their revolvers, so that soon they not only had a\\nroaring fire, but filled the back part of the cave with logs to\\ndry, in case they should camp there again at some later day.\\nNeither Cortlandt nor Bearwarden felt much like sleeping, and so,\\nafter finishing the birds the president had brought down that\\nmorning, they persuaded Ayrault to sit up and smoke with them.\\nWrapping themselves in their blankets--for there was a chill in\\nthe air--they sat about the camp-fire they had built in the mouth\\nof the cave.  Two moons that were at the full rose rapidly in the\\nclear, cold sky.  On account of their distance from the sun, they\\nwere less bright than the terrestrial moon, but they shone with a\\nmarvellously pure pale light.  The larger contained the exact\\nfeatures of a man.  There was the somewhat aquiline nose, a\\nclear-cut and expressive mouth, and large, handsome eyes, which\\nwere shaded by well- marked eyebrows.  The whole face was very\\nstriking, but was a personification of the most intense grief.\\nThe expression was indeed sadder than that of any face they had\\never seen.  The other contained the profile of a surpassingly\\nbeautiful young woman.  The handsome eyes, shaded by lashes,\\nlooked straight ahead.  The nose was perfect, and the ear small,\\nwhile the hair was artistically arranged at the top and back of\\nthe head.  This moon also reflected a pure white ray.  The former\\nappeared about once and a quarter, the latter but three quarters,\\nthe size of the terrestrial moon, and the travellers immediately\\nrecognized them by their sizes and relative positions as Tethys\\nand Dione, discovered by J. D. Cassini in March, 1684.  The sad\\nface was turned slightly towards that of its companion, and it\\nlooked as if some tale of the human heart, some romance, had been\\nengraved and preserved for all time on the features of these dead\\nbodies, as they silently swung in their orbits forever and anon\\nwere side by side.\\n\\n\\\"In all the ages,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"that these moons have\\nwandered with Saturn about the sun, and with the solar system in\\nits journey through space, they can never have gazed upon the\\nscene they now behold, for we may be convinced that no mortal man\\nhas been here before.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We may say,\\\" said Ayrault, \\\"that they see in our bodies a type\\nof the source from which come all the spiritual beings that are\\nhere.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If, as the writers of mythology supposed,\\\" replied Cortlandt,\\n\\\"inanimate objects were endowed with senses, these moons would\\ndoubtless be unable to perceive the spiritual beings here; for\\nthe satellites, being material, should, to be consistent, have\\nonly those senses possessed by ourselves, so that to them this\\nplanet would ordinarily appear deserted.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I shall be glad,\\\" said Bearwarden, gloomily, \\\"when those moons\\nwane and are succeeded by their fellows, for one would give me an\\nattack of the blues, while the other would subject me to the\\ninconvenience of falling in love.\\\"\\n\\nAs he spoke, the upper branches of the trees in the grove began\\nto sway as a cold gust from the north sighed among them.  \\\"Lose\\nno more opportunities,\\\" it seemed to cry, \\\"for life is short and\\nuncertain.  Soon you will all be colder than I, and your future,\\nstill as easily moulded as clay, will be set as Marpesian marble,\\nmore fixed than the hardest rock.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Paradise,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"contains sights and sounds that\\nmight, I should think, arouse sad reminiscences without the aid\\nof the waters of Lethe, unless the joy of its souls in their new\\nresources and the sense of forgiveness outweigh all else.\\\"\\n\\nWith a parting look at the refined, silvery moon, and its\\nsorrow-laden companion, they retired to the sheltering cave,\\npiled up the fire, and talked on for an hour.\\n\\n\\\"I do not see how it is,\\\" said Bearwarden, \\\"that these moons,\\nconsidering their distance from the sun, and the consequently\\nsmall amount of light they receive, are so bright.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A body's brightness in reflecting light,\\\" replied Cortlandt,\\n\\\"depends as much on the colour and composition of its own surface\\nas on the amount it receives.  It is conceivable that these\\nmoons, if placed at the earth's distance from the sun, would be\\nfar brighter than our moon, and that our familiar satellite, if\\nremoved to Saturn, would seem very dim.  We know how much more\\nbrilliant a mountain in the sunlight is when clad in snow than\\nwhen its sides are bare.  These moons evidently reflect a large\\nproportion of the light they receive.\\\"\\n\\nWhen they came out shortly after midnight the girl's-face moon\\nhad already set, leaving a dark and dreary void in the part of\\nthe sky it had so ideally filled.  The inexpressibly sad\\nsatellite (on account of its shorter distance and more rapid rate\\nof revolution) was still above the horizon, and, being slightly\\ntilted, had a more melancholy, heart-broken look than before.\\nWhile they gazed sadly at the emptiness left by Dione, Cortlandt\\nsaw Ayrault's expression change, and, not clearly perceiving its\\ncause, said, wishing to cheer him:  \\\"Never mind, Dick; to-morrow\\nnight we shall see it again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, prosaic reasoner,\\\" retorted Bearwarden, who saw that this,\\nlike so many other things, had reminded Ayrault of Sylvia, \\\"that\\nis but small consolation for having lost it now, though I suppose\\nour lot is not so hard as if we were never to see it again.  In\\nthat moon's face I find the realization of my fancied ideal\\nwoman; while that sad one yonder seems as though some celestial\\nlover, in search of his fate, had become enamoured of her, and\\ntried in vain to win her, and the grief in his mind had impressed\\nitself on the then molten face of a satellite to be the monument\\nthroughout eternity of love and a broken heart.  If the spirits\\nand souls of the departed have any command of matter, why may not\\ntheir intensest thoughts engrave themselves on a moon that, when\\ndead and frozen, may reflect and shine as they did, while\\nimmersed in the depths of space?  At first Dione bored me; now I\\nshould greatly like to see her again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"History repeats itself,\\\" replied Cortlandt, \\\"and the same phases\\nof life recur.  It is we that are in a changed receptive mood.\\nThe change that seems to be in them is in reality in us.  Remain\\nas you are now, and Dione will give you the same pleasure\\ntomorrow that she gave to-day.\\\"\\n\\nTo Ayrault this meant more than the mere setting to rise again of\\na heavenly body.  The perfume of a flower, the sighing of the\\nwind, suggesting some harmony or song, a full or crescent moon,\\nrecalled thoughts and associations of Sylvia.  Everything seemed\\nto bring out memory, and he realized the utter inability of\\nabsence to cure the heart of love.  \\\"If Sylvia should pass from\\nmy life as that moon has left my vision,\\\" his thoughts continued,\\n\\\"existence would be but sadness and memory would be its cause,\\nfor the most beautiful sounds entail sorrow; the most beautiful\\nsights, intense pain.  \\\"Ah,\\\" he went on with a trace of\\nbitterness,  while his friends fell asleep in the cave, \\\"I might\\nbetter have remained in love with science; for whose studies\\nNature, which is but a form of God, in the right spirit, is not\\ndependent for his joy or despair on the whims of a girl.  She, of\\ncourse, sees many others, and, being only twenty, may forget me.\\nMust I content myself with philosophical rules and mathematical\\nformulae, when she, whose changefulness I may find greater than\\nthe winds that sigh over me, now loves me no longer?  O love,\\nwhich makes us miserable when we feel it, and more miserable\\nstill when it is gone!\\\"\\n\\nHe strung a number of copper wires at different degrees of\\ntension between two trees, and listened to the wind as it ranged\\nup and down on this improvised AEolian harp.  It gradually ran\\ninto a regular refrain, which became more and more like words.\\nAyrault was puzzled, and then amazed.  There could be no doubt\\nabout it.  \\\"You should be happy,\\\" it kept repeating--\\\"you should\\nbe happy,\\\" in soft musical tones.\\n\\n\\\"I know I should,\\\" replied Ayrault, finally recognizing the voice\\nof Violet Slade in the song of the wind, \\\"and I cannot understand\\nwhy I am not.  Tell me, is this paradise, Violet, or is it not\\nrather purgatory?\\\"\\n\\nThe notes ranged up and down again, and he perceived that she was\\ncausing the wind to blow as she desired--in other words, she was\\nmaking it play upon his harp.\\n\\n\\\"That depends on the individual,\\\" she replied. \\\"It is rather\\nsheol, the place of departed spirits.  Those whose consciences\\nmade them happy on earth are in paradise here; while those good\\nenough to reach heaven at last, but in whom some dross remains,\\nare further refined in spirit, and to them it is purgatory.\\nThose who are in love can be happy in but one way while their\\nlove lasts.  What IS happiness, anyway?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is the state in which desires are satisfied, my fair Violet,\\\"\\nanswered Ayrault.\\n\\n\\\"Say, rather, the state in which desire coincides with duty,\\\"\\nreplied the song.  \\\"Self-sacrifice for others gives the truest\\njoy; being with the object of one's love, the next.  You never\\nbelieved that I loved you.  I dissembled well; but you will see\\nfor yourself some day, as clearly as I see your love for another\\nnow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" replied Ayrault, sadly, \\\"I am in love.  I have no reason\\nto believe there is cause for my unrest, and, considering every\\nthing, I should be happy as man can be; yet, mirabile dictu, I am\\nin--hades, in the very depths!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your beloved is beyond my vision; your heart is all I can see.\\nYet I am convinced she will not forget you.  I am sure she loves\\nyou still.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have always believed in homoeopathy to the extent of the\\nsimilia similibus curantur, Violet, and it is certain that where\\nnothing else will cure a man of love for one woman, his love for\\nanother will.  You can see how I love Sylvia, but you have never\\nseemed so sweet to me as to-day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is a sacrilege, my friend, to speak so to me now.  You are\\ndone with me forever.  I am but a disembodied spirit, and escaped\\nhades by the grace of the Omnipotent, rather than by virtue of\\nany good I did on earth.  So far as any elasticity is left in my\\nopportunities, I am dead as yon moon.  You have still the gift\\nthat but one can give.  Within your animal body you hold an\\nimmortal soul.  It is pliable as wax; you can mould it by your\\nwill.  As you shape that soul, so will your future be.  It is the\\nark that can traverse the flood.  Raise it, and it will raise\\nyou.  It is all there is in yourself.  Preserve that gift, and\\nwhen you die you will, I hope, start on a plane many thousands of\\nyears in advance of me.  There should be no more comparison\\nbetween us than between a person with all his senses and one that\\nis deaf and blind.  Though you are a layman, you should, with\\nyour faith and frame of mind, soon be but little behind our\\nspiritual bishop.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I supposed after death a man had rest.  Is he, then, a bishop\\nstill?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The progress, as he told you, is largely on the old lines.  As\\nhe stirred men's hearts on earth, he will stir their souls in\\nheaven; and this is no irksome or unwelcome work.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You say he WILL do this in heaven.  Is he, then, not there yet?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He was not far from heaven on earth, yet technically none of us\\ncan be in heaven till after the general resurrection.  Then, as\\nwe knew on earth, we shall receive bodies, though, as yet,\\nconcerning their exact nature we know but little more than then.\\nWe are all in sheol--the just in purgatory and paradise, the\\nunjust in hell.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Since you are still in purgatory, are you unhappy?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, our state is very happy.  All physical pain is past, and can\\nnever be felt again.  We know that our evil desires are overcome,\\nand that their imprints are being gradually erased.  I\\noccasionally shed an intangible tear, yet for most of those who\\nstrove to obey their consciences, purgatory, when essential,\\nthough occasionally giving us a bitter twinge, is a joy-producing\\nstate.  Not all the glories imaginable or unimaginable could make\\nus happy, were our consciences ill at ease.  I have advanced\\nslowly, yet some things are given us at once.  After I realized I\\nhad irrevocably lost your love, though for a time I had hoped to\\nregain it, I became very restless; earth seemed a prison, and I\\nlooked forward to death as my deliverer.  I bore you no malice;\\nyou had never especially tried to win me; the infatuation--that\\nof a girl of eighteen--had been all on my side.  I lived five sad\\nand lonely years, although, as you know, I had much attention.\\nPeople thought me cold and heartless.  How could I have a heart,\\nhaving failed to win yours, and mine being broken?  Having lost\\nthe only man I loved, I knew no one else could replace him, and I\\nwas not the kind to marry for pique.  People thought me handsome,\\nbut I felt myself aged when you ceased to call.  Perhaps when you\\nand she who holds all your love come to sheol, she may spare you\\nto me a little, for as a spirit my every thought is known; or\\nperhaps after the resurrection, when I, too, can leave this\\nplanet, we shall all soar through space together, and we can\\nstudy the stars as of old.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your voice is a symphony, sweetest Violet, and I love to hear\\nyour words.  Ah, would you could once more return to earth, or\\nthat I were an ethereal spirit, that we might commune face to\\nface!  I would follow you from one end of Shadowland to the\\nother.  Of what use is life to me, with distractions that draw my\\nthoughts to earth as gravitation drew my body?  I wish I were a\\nshade.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are talking for effect, Dick--which is useless here, for I\\nsee how utterly you are in love.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I AM in love, Violet; and though, as I said, I have no reason to\\ndoubt Sylvia's steadfastness and constancy, I am very unhappy.  I\\nhave always heard that time is a balsam that cures all ills, yet\\nI become more wretched every day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do all you can to preserve that love, and it will bring you joy\\nall your life.  Your happiness is my happiness.  What distresses\\nyou, distresses me.\\\"\\n\\nThe tones here grew fainter and seemed about to cease.\\n\\n\\\"Before you leave me,\\\" cried Ayrault, \\\"tell me how and when I may\\nsee or hear you again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"While you remain on this planet, I shall be near; but beyond\\nSaturn I cannot go.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yet tell me, Violet, how I may see you?  My love unattained, you\\nperceive, makes me wretched, while you always gave me calm and\\npeace.  If I may not kiss the hand I almost asked might be mine,\\nlet me have but a glance from your sweet eyes, which will comfort\\nme so much now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you break the ice in the pool behind you, you shall see me\\ntill the frame melts.\\\"\\n\\nAfter this the silence was broken only by the sighing of the wind\\nin the trees.  The pool had suddenly become covered with ice\\nseveral inches thick.  Taking an axe, Ayrault hewed out a\\nparallelogram about three feet by four and set it on end against\\nthe bank.  The cold grey of morning was already colouring the\\neast, and in the growing light Ayrault beheld a vision of Violet\\nwithin the ice.  The face was at about three fourths, and had a\\ncontemplative air.  The hair was arranged as he had formerly seen\\nit, and the thoughtful look was strongest in the beautiful grey\\neyes, which were more serious than of yore.  Ayrault stood\\nriveted to the spot and gazed.  \\\"I could have been happy with\\nher,\\\" he mused, and to think she is no more!\\\"\\n\\nAs drops fell from the ice, tears rose to his eyes.\\n\\n```\\n  .      .      .      .      .      .      .\\n```\\n\\n\\\"What a pretty girl!\\\" said Bearwarden to Cortlandt, as they came\\nupon it later in the day.  \\\"The face seems etched or imprinted by\\nsome peculiar form of freezing far within the ice.\\\"\\n\\nThe next morning they again set out, and so tramped, hunted, and\\ninvestigated with varying success for ten Saturnian days.  They\\nfound that in the animal and plant forms of life Nature had\\noften, by some seeming accident, struck out in a course very\\ndifferent from any on the earth.  Many of the animals were bipeds\\nand tripeds, the latter arranged in tandem, the last leg being\\nevidently an enormously developed tail, by which the creature\\npropelled itself as with a spring.  The quadrupeds had also\\nsometimes wings, and their bones were hollow, like those of\\nbirds.  Whether this great motive and lifting power was the\\nresult of the planet's size and the power of gravitation, or\\nwhether some creatures had in addition the power of developing a\\ndegree of apergetic repulsion to offset it, as they suspected in\\nthe case of the boa-constrictor that fell upon Cortlandt on\\nJupiter, they could not absolutely ascertain.  Life was far less\\nprolific on Saturn than on Jupiter, doubtless as a result of its\\ngreater distance from the sun, and of its extremes of climate,\\nalmost all organic life being driven to the latitudes near the\\nequator.  There were, as on Jupiter, many variations from the\\nforms of life to which they were accustomed, and adaptations to\\nthe conditions in which they found themselves; but, with the\\nexception of the strange manifestations of spirit life, they\\nfound the workings of the fundamental laws the same.  Often when\\nthey woke at night the air was luminous, and they were convinced\\nthat if they remained there long enough it would be easy to\\ndevise some telegraphic code of light-flashes by which they could\\ncommunicate with the spirit world, and so get ideas from the host\\nof spirits that had already solved the problem of life and death,\\nbut who were not as yet sufficiently developed to be able to\\nreturn to the earth.  One day they stopped to investigate what\\nthey had supposed to be an optical illusion.  They observed that\\nleaves and other light substances floated several inches above\\nthe surface of the water in the pools.  On coming to the edge and\\nmaking tests, they found a light liquid, as invisible as air,\\nsuperimposed upon the water, with sufficient buoyancy to sustain\\ndry wood and also some forms of life.  They also observed that\\ninsects coming close to the surface and apparently inhaling it,\\nrapidly increased in size and weight, from which they concluded\\nit must throw off nitrogen, carbon, or some other nourishment in\\nthe form of gas.  The depth upon the water was unaffected by\\nrain, which passed through it, but depended rather on the\\ncondition of the atmosphere, from which it was evidently\\ncondensed.  There seemed also to be a relation between the amount\\nof this liquid and the activity of the spirits.  Finally, when\\ntheir ammunition showed signs of running low, they decided to\\nreturn to the Callisto, go in it to the other side of the planet,\\nand resume their investigations there.  Accordingly, they set out\\nto retrace their steps, returning by a course a few miles to one\\nside of the way they had come, and making the cave their\\nobjective point.  Arriving there one evening about sunset, they\\npitched their camp.  The cave was sheltered and comfortable, and\\nthey made preparation for passing the night.\\n\\n\\\"I shall be sorry,\\\" said Ayrault, as they sat near their fire,\\n\\\"to leave this place without again seeing the bishop.  He said we\\ncould impress him anywhere, but it may be more difficult to do\\nthat at the antipodes than here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It does seem,\\\" said Bearwarden, \\\"as though we should be missing\\nit in not seeing him again, if that is possible.  Nothing but a\\npoison-storm brought him the first time, and it is not certain\\nthat even in such an emergency would he come again uncalled.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think,\\\" said Ayrault, \\\"as none of the spirits here are\\nmalevolent, they would warn us of danger if they could.  The\\nbishop's spirit seems to have been the only one with sufficiently\\ndeveloped power to reappear as a man.  I therefore suggest that\\nto-morrow we try to make him feel our thought and bring him to\\nus.\\\"\\n\\n```\\n                      CHAPTER VII.\\n\\n               THE SPIRIT'S SECOND VISIT.\\n```\\n\\nAccordingly, the next morning they concentrated their minds\\nsimultaneously on the spirit, wishing with all their strength\\nthat he should reappear.\\n\\n\\\"Whether he be far or near,\\\" said Ayrault, \\\"he must feel that,\\nfor we are using the entire force of our\\nminds.\\\"\\n\\nShadows began to form, and dancing prismatic colours appeared,\\nbut as yet there was no sign of the deceased bishop, when\\nsuddenly he took shape among them, his appearance and\\ndisappearance being much like that of stereopticon views on the\\nsheet before a lantern.  He held himself erect, and his\\nthoughtful, dignified face had the same calm expression it had\\nworn before.\\n\\n\\\"We attracted your attention,\\\" said Ayrault, \\\"in the way you said\\nwe might, because we longed so to see you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" added Bearwarden and Cortlandt, \\\"we felt we MUST see you\\nagain.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am always at your service,\\\" replied the spirit, \\\"and will\\nanswer your questions.  With regard to my visibility and\\ninvisibility\\\"--he continued, with a smile, \\\"for I will not wait\\nfor you to ask the explanation of what is in your minds--it is\\nvery simple.  A man's soul can never die; a manifestation of the\\nsoul is the spirit; this has entity, consciousness, and will, and\\nthese also live forever.  As in the natural or material life, as\\nI shall call it, will affects the material first.  Thus, a child\\nhas power to move its hand or a material object, as a toy, before\\nit can become the medium in a psychological seance.  So it is\\nhere.  Before becoming visible to your eyes, I, by my will, draw\\ncertain material substances in the form of gases from the ground,\\nwater, or air around me.  These take any shape I wish--not\\nnecessarily that of man, though it is more natural to appear as\\nwe did on earth--and may absorb a portion of light, and so be\\nable to cast a shadow or break up the white rays into prismatic\\ncolours, or they may be wholly invisible.  By an effort of the\\nwill, then, I combine and condense these gases--which consist\\nprincipally of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon--into\\nflesh, blood, water, or anything else.  You have already learned\\non earth that, by the application of heat, every solid and every\\nliquid substance, which is solid or liquid simply because of the\\ntemperature at which you find it, can be expanded into gas or\\ngases; and that by cold and pressure every gas can be reduced to\\na liquid or a solid.  On earth the state of a substance, whether\\nsolid, liquid, or gaseous, depends simply upon those two\\nconditions.  Here neither thermal nor barometric changes are\\nrequired, for, by mastering the new natural laws that at death\\nbecome patent to our senses, we have all the necessary control.\\nIt requires but an effort of my will to be almost instantly\\nclothed in human form, and but another effort to rearrange the\\nmolecules in such a way as to make the envelope visible.  Some\\nwho have been dead longer, or had a greater natural aptitude than\\nI, have advanced further, and all are learning; but the\\ndifference in the rate at which spirits acquire control of\\npreviously unknown natural laws varies far more than among\\nindividuals on earth.\\n\\n\\\"These forms of organic life do not disintegrate till after\\ndeath; here in the natural state they break down and dissolve\\ninto their structural elements in full bloom, as was done by the\\nfungi.  The poisonous element in the deadly gust, against which I\\nwarned you, came from the gaseous ingredients of toadstools,\\nwhich but seldom, and then only when the atmosphere has the\\ngreatest affinity for them, dissolve automatically, producing a\\ndeath-spreading wave, against which your meteorological\\ninstruments in future can warn you.  The slight fall you noticed\\nin temperature was because the specific heat of these gases is\\nhigh, and to become gas while in the solid state they had to\\nwithdraw some warmth from the air.  The fatal breath of the\\nwinged lizards--or dragons, as you call them--results from the\\nsame cause, the action of their digestion breaking up the fungus,\\nwhich does not kill them, because they exhale the poisonous part\\nin gaseous form with their breath.  The mushrooms dissolve more\\neasily; the natural separation that takes place as they reach a\\ncertain stage in their development being precipitated by\\nconcussion or shock.\\n\\n\\\"Having seen that, as on earth, we gain control of the material\\nfirst, our acquisitiveness then extends to a better understanding\\nand appreciation of our new senses, and we are continually\\nfinding new objects of beauty, and new beauties in things we\\nsupposed we already understood.  We were accustomed on earth to\\nthe marvellous variety that Nature produced from apparently\\nsimple means and presented to our very limited senses; here there\\nis an indescribably greater variety to be examined by vastly\\nkeener senses.  The souls in hell have an equally keen but\\ndistorted counterpart of our senses, so that they see in a\\nmagnified form everything vile in themselves and in each other.\\nTo their senses only the ugly and hateful side is visible, so\\nthat the beauty and perfume of a flower are to them as loathsome\\nas the appearance and fumes of a toadstool.  As evolution and the\\ntendency of everything to perpetuate itself and intensify its\\npeculiarities are invariable throughout the universe, these\\nunhappy souls and ourselves seem destined to diverge more and\\nmore as time goes on; and while we constantly become happier as\\nour capacity for happiness increases, their sharpening senses\\nwill give them a worse and worse idea of each other, till their\\nmutual repugnance will know no bounds, and of everything\\nconcerning which they obtain knowledge through their senses.\\nThus these poor creatures seem to be the victims of circumstances\\nand the unalterable laws of fate, and were there such a thing as\\ndeath, their misery would unquestionably finally break their\\nhearts.  That there will be final forgiveness for the condemned,\\nhas long been a human hope; but as yet they have experienced\\nnone, and there is no analogy for it in Nature.\\n\\n\\\"But while you have still your earthly bodies and the\\nopportunities they give you of serving God, you need not be\\nconcerned about hell; no one on earth, knowing how things really\\nare, would ever again forsake His ways.  The earthly state is the\\nmost precious opportunity of securing that for which a man would\\ngive his all.  Even from the most worldly point of view, a man is\\nan unspeakable fool not to improve his talents and do good.  What\\nwould those in sheol not give now for but one day in the flesh on\\nearth, of which you unappreciatives may still have so many?  The\\nwell-used opportunities of even one hour might bring joy to those\\nin paradise forever, and greatly ease the lot of those in hell.\\nIn doing acts of philanthropy, however, you must remember the\\ntext of the sermon the doctor of divinity preached to Craniner\\nand Ridley just before they perished at the stake:  'Though I\\ngive my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me\\nnothing'--which shows that even good deeds must be performed in\\nthe proper spirit.\\n\\n\\\"A new era is soon to dawn on earth.  Notwithstanding your great\\nmaterial progress, the future will exceed all the past.  Man will\\nfind every substance's maximum use, thereby vastly increasing his\\ncomfort.  Then, when advanced in science and reason, with the\\npower of his senses increased by the delicate instruments that\\nyou, as the forerunners of the coming man, are already learning\\nto make, may he cease to be a groveller, like our progenitors the\\nquadrupeds, and may his thoughts rise to his Creator, who has\\nbrought him to such heights through all the intricacies of the\\nway.  Your preparation for the life to come can also be greatly\\naided by intercourse with those who have already died.  When you\\nreally want to associate spiritually with us, you can do so; for,\\nthough perhaps only one in a hundred million can, like me, so\\nclothe himself as to be again visible to mortal eyes, many of us\\ncould affect gelatine or extremely sensitive plates that would\\nshow interruptions in the ultra-violet chemical rays that, like\\nthe thermal red beyond the visible spectroscope, you know exist\\nthough you can neither see nor feel them.  Spirits could not\\naffect the magnetic eye, because magnetism, though immaterial\\nitself, is induced and affected only by a material substance.\\nThe impression on the plate, however, like the prismatic colours\\nyou have already noticed, can be produced by a slight rarefaction\\nof the hydrogen in the air, so that, though no spirit could be\\nphotographed as such, a code and language might be established by\\nmeans of the effect produced on the air by the spirit's mind.  I\\nam so interested in the subject of my disquisition that I had\\nalmost forgotten that your spirits are still subject to the\\nrequirements of the body.  Last time I dined with you; let me now\\nplay the host.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We shall be charmed to dine with you,\\\" said Ayrault, \\\"and shall\\nbe only too glad of anything that will keep you with us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then,\\\" said the spirit, \\\"as the tablecloth is laid, we need only\\nto have something on it.  Let each please hold a corner,\\\" he\\ncontinued, taking one himself with his left hand, while he passed\\nhis right to his brow.  Soon flakes as of snow began to form in\\nthe air above, and slowly descended upon the cloth; and, glancing\\nup, the three men saw that for a considerable height this process\\nwas going on, the flakes increasing in size as they fell till\\nthey attained a length of several inches.  When there was enough\\nfor them all on the table-cloth the shower ceased.  Sitting down\\non the ground, they began to eat this manna, which had a\\ndelicious flavour and marvellous purity and freshness.\\n\\n\\\"As you doubtless have already suspected,\\\" said the spirit, \\\"the\\nbasis of this in every case is carbon, combined with nitrogen in\\nits solid form, and with the other gases the atmosphere here\\ncontains.  You may notice that the flakes vary in colour as well\\nas in taste, both of which are of course governed by the gas with\\nwhich the carbon, also in its visible form, is combined.  It is\\nalmost the same process as that performed by every plant in\\nwithdrawing carbon from the air and storing it in its trunk in\\nthe form of wood, which, as charcoal, is again almost pure\\ncarbon, only in this case the metamorphosis is far more rapid.\\nThis is perhaps the natural law that Elijah, by God's aid,\\ninvoked in the miracle of the widow's cruse, and that produced\\nthe manna that fed the Israelites in the desert; while apergy\\ncame in play in the case of the stream that Moses called from the\\nrock in the wilderness, which followed the descendants of Abraham\\nover the rough country through which they passed.  In examining\\nmiracles with the utmost deference, as we have a right to, we see\\none law running through all.  Even in Christ's miracle of\\nchanging the water to wine, there was a natural law, though only\\none has dwelt on earth who could make that change, which, from a\\nchemist's standpoint, was peculiarly difficult on account of the\\nrequired fermentation, which is the result of a developed and\\nmatured germ.  Many of His miracles, however, are as far beyond\\nmy small power as heaven is above the earth.  Much of the\\nsubstance of the loaves and fishes with which He fed the\\nmultitude--the carbon and nitrogenous products--also came from\\nthe air, though He could have taken them from many other sources.\\nThe combination and building up of these in the ordinary way\\nwould have taken weeks or months, but was performed\\ninstantaneously by His mighty power.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1636793155,\"title\":\"So they sat and smoked for an hour, till the stars twinkled and\\nthe rings shone in their glory.\"},\"digest\":\"_qK0aV8JruSnUnqdsBv7EuUzfEiE-x9EUbL7e83ZFFI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xfbd725612A5299FAE5cea4725fAb05072Fc51050\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"gBJzU3GahCHJzWqQ684K00Q872aUKY3etwe47PL3yvU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"waWLWizi0CCGMiHh6ZVlwUA2l3UnHYx6Lq7apITcu8Q\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"NDw5wuIUXiIklHG6anQpQx58VRrvHIgRWnyQ5CZ6mhyt4eFTV61LrrMdbbo-tWKN0xBuy4nRVf7GUzQXIwIQUw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa2590e8fbbf1ae52f5c0155aa59e4f1873fbc2dfd17b646afc7b66802157ea3d477168e546822cc870194b44177f9dd659caa6af61be11847733177c06c509b31b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"gBJzU3GahCHJzWqQ684K00Q872aUKY3etwe47PL3yvU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"waWLWizi0CCGMiHh6ZVlwUA2l3UnHYx6Lq7apITcu8Q\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"_qK0aV8JruSnUnqdsBv7EuUzfEiE-x9EUbL7e83ZFFI\"}"
