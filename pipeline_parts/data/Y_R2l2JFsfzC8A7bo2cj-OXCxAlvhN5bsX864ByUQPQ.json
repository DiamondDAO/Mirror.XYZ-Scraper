Now it will be called ‚ÄúMETA,‚Äù a name which reveals the company's intention to focus on developing a meta-world or Metaverse. In this cyber world, with the help of gadgets such as headsets and sensors, we will be able to virtually enter it and interact rather than just using the web from the outside as we do today.\\n\\nAccording to wikipedia: The **metaverse** (a portmanteau of \\\"meta-\\\" and \\\"universe\\\") is the hypothesized next iteration of the internet, supporting decentralized, persistent online 3-D virtual environments.\\n\\nThis virtual space will be accessible through virtual reality headsets, augmented reality glasses, smartphones, PCs, and game consoles. The metaverse has well-defined use cases within the video game, business, education, retail, and real-estate sectors. The largest limitation for wide-scale adoption of the metaverse comes from technological limitations with current devices and sensors needed to interact with real-time virtual environments. Numerous companies, such as Meta, Roblox, Epic Games and Microsoft, are investing in research in metaverse-related technologies to make it more cost effective and more widely available.\\n\\n> Metaverse can not only refer to virtual worlds, but to the multidimensional experiences of use and application of the Internet as a whole, especially the combining spectrum of web 2.0, augmented reality, third-dimensional technology and virtual reality.\\n\\nThese companies are not and will not be the only ones to launch virtual worlds where we can socialize, own assets, be our own chosen avatars, transact and be part of cyber economies.\\n\\nCompanies such as Nike, Disney, record companies and film producers, among others, are ready to monetize their products and services in the meta-universe. Crypto will be the currencies of this world and NFTs, the way to record transactions and ownership. Many other innovations will be born thanks to these technologies.\\n\\nCareers and jobs will also revolutionize, the metaverse needs designers, developers, cryptocurrencies, cyber security, cloud development, as well as the creation of physical equipment and devices to allow this immersion.\\n\\n> ***A fascinating world awaits us, and it is the ‚ÄúMETA‚Äù World.***\\n\\n#### üóÇÔ∏è Directory\\n\\n*   [Alchemy](http://alchemy.com/) - Quickly becoming the AWS for blockchains.
