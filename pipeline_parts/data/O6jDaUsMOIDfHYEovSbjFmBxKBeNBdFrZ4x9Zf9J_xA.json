It’s the first item of my **Videogame Music** collection — you can add it to your watchlist and expect more drops to come soon.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XRdpDTy3kV2n2kmCetPWs.png?height=764&width=764)\\n\\nFor this tiny song, I tried to convey the feeling of going for a joyride against the wind, on a sunny day. But there are some differences compared to the original game that inspired me: the nostalgic retrowave theme — the game was released in 1986 — and the updated (and vectorized) red convertible car. The couple in the artwork was rendered from the actual game sprites.\\n\\nBut the nostalgic retrowave references are also in the song, with the harmony conducted by a synth and the 8 bit horn as the lead instrument.\\n\\n[https://soundcloud.com/ultimateactx/out-runner](https://soundcloud.com/ultimateactx/out-runner)\\n\\n***Out Runner*** was created in FL Studio and miniBit then mastered in Audacity. You can also listen to the streaming version on Soundcloud, whose artwork was based on an Out Run fanart illustration that I created in 2016.\\n\\n**Out Runner is available now on OpenSea.**\\n\\n[https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/10284962081527437766293049917638158830084136213135864973295502529959779368970](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/10284962081527437766293049917638158830084136213135864973295502529959779368970)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1642439667,\"title\":\"Out Runner\"},\"digest\":\"8LKXca98XfXvVwNJI8lYQix5pFyUpB0t5Y8pYG50pIU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x16bD150e1fb6E973b06B465d8dc853b8cb69A975\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bGTIV2LBUEBJGZFwoRKP2xmrqAUHxxMdw_mEkli80k4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"-ztq1Rt8hJQywr5i6WtOwKmUOQ-zJknV_NtovMwLmUI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"cldihZ9O4DCd0C-6pP-eLBYZ0NzyWD6aP5MVpOhoy6JvZ4cnRXw3yHRGWnM_UBIVI6h7ku5217mSnT1KtHUgxA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x223b4b67f09c29011731938e06690eecbc5da2abbcd15a5db672efd8b63fb7f83eaa54a1da3c2951019e175034c76d398b938104fddc187743f964f6fbb7fecb1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bGTIV2LBUEBJGZFwoRKP2xmrqAUHxxMdw_mEkli80k4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"-ztq1Rt8hJQywr5i6WtOwKmUOQ-zJknV_NtovMwLmUI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"5QoLPsDDDMpuLOnJP-Rj4U1g-tHUTI7A9izRWKVVu14\"}"
