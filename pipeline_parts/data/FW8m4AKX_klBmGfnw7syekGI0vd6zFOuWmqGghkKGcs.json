"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"After a person died, he passed a magnificent palace on the way to see the king. The owner of the palace begged him to stay and live. This person said: \\\"I have been busy all my life in the world, I only want to eat, I just want to sleep, I hate work.\\\" The palace owner replied: \\\"If this is the case, then there is nothing like me in the world. It is more suitable for you to live in. I have the delicacies of the mountains and the sea. You can eat whatever you want. No one will stop you. I have a comfortable bed. You can sleep for as long as you want. No one will disturb you; and , I promise that there is nothing you need to do.\\\"  So, this person stayed.  In the first few days, this person ate and slept, and slept, and felt very happy. Gradually, he felt a little lonely and empty, so He went to see the owner of the palace and complained: \\\"This kind of day of eating, sleeping and sleeping every day is not interesting at all. I am now full of brains, and I have no interest in this kind of life. You Can I find a job?\\\" The owner of the palace replied: \\\"I'm sorry, we have never had a job here.\\\" After a few months, this man really couldn't stand it anymore, and went to see the owner of the palace again:\\\" I really can’t stand this kind of day. If you don’t work for me, I would rather go to hell than live here.\\\" The master of the palace smiled contemptuously: \\\"Do you think this is heaven? This is hell originally. !\\\" An easy life turns out to be a kind of hell! Although it has no sword mountain to go up, no fire to go down, no pan to go, but it can gradually destroy your ideals, corrode your soul, and even make you change Into a walking dead. Doing nothing is also a kind of hard pain, and everything is sometimes a kind of fulfilling happiness; to be born in sorrow and die in happiness is probably the common destiny of mankind. Look at those wealthy people, who can't spend much money long ago, and are still working hard, why? For their own vitality.\",\"timestamp\":1634476525,\"title\":\"Another hell\"},\"digest\":\"wzwtqrUo5bcLWZAnoLW0lvG7bTMfZ4J8dCcNI2mh6OU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xff38255d0E28f118922a5dEa71E4fB6A6F49e61A\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qI7J8T_Tmajo_Q6P4tIpRRkrQONid1Kwn7eP2d-4HA0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QIOBaw4sYOmzxrlIzf8RvsqksY4bKkFrSU_Xp5PUv7I\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"P7BYEz-f2FEBAyFabCmD0q1uqyiXJQ42i8VBOOBdY9AnSbqHq8Ctf6NnuwqCf3BZ6TNBEwiil3lBUCvUlz-HFQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc8ed4dccc656b5a456123f52b2ad618fd5b68d5cc4f59453ad6fd1ed65a7720017d69cbc82853c5d4263c33b56432ec1edd21620e23ff3209f277f5763acd6531c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qI7J8T_Tmajo_Q6P4tIpRRkrQONid1Kwn7eP2d-4HA0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QIOBaw4sYOmzxrlIzf8RvsqksY4bKkFrSU_Xp5PUv7I\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wzwtqrUo5bcLWZAnoLW0lvG7bTMfZ4J8dCcNI2mh6OU\"}"
