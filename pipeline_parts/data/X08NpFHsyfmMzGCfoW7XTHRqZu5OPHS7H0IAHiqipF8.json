Code has been uploaded on Github.\\n\\nMaraLink is an assets cross-chain protocol supporting the underlying infrastructure of Polkadot ecosystem into which it aims at introducing more assets.\\n\\n> **Meaning of MaraLink: Underlying infrastructure of Polkadot**\\n\\nAs a Multi-chain assets lending protocol, Amara needs to connect with assets outside Polkadot. Without Maralink, MaraLend will be an isolated island in Polkadot ecosystem.\\n\\nMaraLink is the bridge to connect quality assets outside Polkadot such as Ethereum, Polygon, Solana into MaraLend.\\n\\nIt is because of the crucial value of MaraLink that MaraLink won the grant from Polygon and realized asset connection between Polkadot and Polygon.\\n\\n> **MaraLink progress: How far to commercialization?**\\n\\nIn June, Amara Technical team conducted an extensive investigation and research on design goal and techinical path of MaraLink, and launched it jointly with Phala Network.\\n\\nNow MaraLink has completed integration with code uploaded on Github. Next, MaraLink will move forward to distributed deployment and be officially commercized succeeding the test.\\n\\nLet’s stay tuned.\\n\\n**Amara team is now among one of the few exceptional teams capable of developing both products and underlying infrastructure after the launch of MaraLink, which endorse Amara to be a multi-chain asset financial platform on Polkadot.**\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639118605,\"title\":\"MaraLink Completed Integration and Uploaded on Github\"},\"digest\":\"Xycw1TLC7sZ2djMIMqLpVvizvvjKoP-HQLpDsnve9c8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x540f582115209Dce1475FadBa786ab7a5B9c989D\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fLf8M8UI49yf2mn135fq1UauyCNZ-XAzwRPkXrMO2GQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"faD67GGNd4N5upaKGd4-82Ed-f9k0cOyq3lwa24N_Sc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"c-jk40JBcaH8BdcWHG9tNg78hfsMlNy9Iq21rub9--8AhbSHLBFeEtkfIpqJTC6_rZkoqQSjTptbpnloilXoKg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x619ef74586f0891e901bc1927ed762aec1426a6bcfe921c72887652e8b5af9df6ec58b8e654351703f2a69a252b8ae486b7d889c4aedf3f72e023b1e37b7d0651b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fLf8M8UI49yf2mn135fq1UauyCNZ-XAzwRPkXrMO2GQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"faD67GGNd4N5upaKGd4-82Ed-f9k0cOyq3lwa24N_Sc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Xycw1TLC7sZ2djMIMqLpVvizvvjKoP-HQLpDsnve9c8\"}"
