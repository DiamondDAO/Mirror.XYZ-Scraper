"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Dear Creators,\\n\\nNow‚Äôs the time to collaborate with creators you admire. Collabs in the form of visual art, music, product, code, fashion, and other forms of virtual or live experiences.\\n\\nArtist led DAOs can be formed to align the [squad](https://otherinter.net/research/squad-wealth/).\\n\\nWho‚Äôs on the team?  Specialists who possess the skills to make the things you want to make. For recording artists, the team may include producers, musicians, songwriters, a videographer, content creators, and business + technical partnership from [Team Phlote](https://twitter.com/teamphlote).  ü§ù\\n\\nSome of these roles may be filled by your fan community. Over time, you‚Äôll also bring collectors into the fold.\\n\\nThose who are invested in your success will be most interested in their best strategic advice. Think of collectors as a form of activist investors who‚Äôs input is highly valued.  Target collectors who produce great ideas and keep those around who have real skin in the game.\\n\\n[Social tokens and NFTs](https://blog.opensea.io/guides/non-fungible-tokens/) are the best Web3 tools to create team alignment.  It‚Äôs important to make sure everyone on squad understands how the system works:\\n\\n1. Team agrees on collaborative project\\n2. Each contributions are rewarded with tokens\\n3. Revenues are pooled and distributed to contributors based on their token holdings\\n4. Repeat\\n\\nClear tangible win because they‚Äôre easy to contribute too. The more ambitious, the more room there is for anyone to participate. The more epic the better.\\n\\nProceeds from each project can be reserved to fund the creation of the next bigger project, enabling the team to double down.\\n\\nThis is how collaborative teams are being structured within Phlote and how we‚Äôre choosing who to support as a DAO. The two questions we ask any partner of rip are:\\n\\n1. What the dream?\\n2. Who‚Äôs on the team?\\n\\nThe clarity with which these two questions can be answered tells us a lot about who‚Äôs organized, focused, and ready.\\n\\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a squad, pull up on us and say hi.\\n\\n\\\\- Team Phlote\\n\\nüå© ONLY GOOD ENERGY ALLOWED üå©\",\"timestamp\":1637800369,\"title\":\"How to DAO (for Creatives)\",\"publication\":\"phlote\"},\"digest\":\"pcynwlNbcKl-Vqs6fJTp0w05oDPWyZnym9bJKoLeFu0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xEf58304E292fBAeacFdeC25b67b3438031FdE313\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PXJLDXOqBueEKO0E1SD7_f-pNsTzIJlK2D7w1kzK15Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xA1U5hyNE0GIB_b-tI60UEZ6Nq_yLY_JiJiI3_Ie_vI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"umO9v3lec9PyRdxrok_gr4J8Bc8E-YtyD-GndWv-P0pbAYbLoVvlkxyp8XzRHDOh8Ho1M_7r0Qd6Dk4LdpF4eA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa8789d7fc1370553d76d4969a047e88ce852f449d94c3bcc04a298db6b4886516b348f5a0989d3e958ddbd9e68046c4f622388cda684bc6b8de8fb7af96ca88e1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PXJLDXOqBueEKO0E1SD7_f-pNsTzIJlK2D7w1kzK15Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xA1U5hyNE0GIB_b-tI60UEZ6Nq_yLY_JiJiI3_Ie_vI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"7HB9oG6nQQWEv94L93XxuDb2DYLxXADiAApK0E01VlY\"}"
