She did, because she had faith, she gave up her millions of family wealth; Because of her faith, she became a village cadre bravely; Building houses for the villagers in the heavy rain, and still caring for the villagers in the disease.\\n\\n \\n\\nShe is Duan Aiping, the \\\"most beautiful village cadre\\\".\\n\\n \\n\\nThe dream of a village sprouts and thrives because of her faith!

Little girl Baochai came to the world to play in the Grand View Garden at sunrise. Only then did she find that the world had many criticisms against me. Little girl, I was really wronged!\\n\\n \\n\\nPeople prefer the weak sister Lin. when they mention me, they gnash their teeth one by one. Some scold me for being hypocritical, some point to my greed for fame and wealth, and some blame me for destroying other people's good feelings. This is because they look at me with colored glasses.\\n\\n \\n\\nI admit that compared with sister Lin, I am a bit sophisticated, but it's not my fault. I lived in Jia's house with my mother and brother. My mother was gentle and my brother was a lawless devil. Later, I married a ferocious sister-in-law. If I didn't pay attention to everything and be careful, how could my mother and I survive in such a vortex? But some people call me hypocritical and buy people's hearts. Is it wrong for me to care about everyone? I just hope my mother and myself can live in peace with everyone around me.\\n\\n \\n\\nSomeone found out the \\\"good wind\\\" I had written and sent me to Qingyun, saying that I was full of fame, wealth and honor. This is another big prejudice against me. Have you forgotten that I went to Beijing for a draft girl? As a young lady who has been taught three obediences and four virtues since childhood, when I face an opportunity to change my destiny, can't I have some vision and expectation for my future? Moreover, I also expressed my hatred for the dark world in crab poetry, which made my sisters shout happy. This is also my poetry. Why did people ignore it?\\n\\n \\n\\nThe former alliance of wood and stone is really moving, but I didn't plan the golden and jade marriage. I'm also pursuing my own love! When Baoyu was beaten, didn't I show my true feelings? But sister Lin's red and swollen eyes won everyone's sympathy, and people naturally turned a blind eye to me. The switch scheme brought me a curse, but who knows that when I heard Baoyu's voice, sister Lin, my heart was also very painful? I can't get the love I pursue and bear the curse of destroying others' feelings. Who has said a fair word for me?\\n\\n \\n\\nThe reason why people have many prejudices against me is that they all come to see me with the mood of liking sister Lin and hating me. They see my words and deeds and my words. In fact, even sister Lin can look at me with fair eyes and regret misunderstanding me before. Why can't others? I hope the world will not alienate people with their feelings, so that the little woman can be vindicated!\",\"timestamp\":1639148798,\"title\":\"NICE\"},\"digest\":\"BXH-wsZk_oi2-qUzhv2m9OvCfQT3kFUBTBsi9igueog\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5a5db2E87f60d3C9EE448F7B187B847bd1c2d2ac\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NRt-KYE4bzXmrTuDTEvU6Sd0SlhltEGERo2YgRFsaVg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MnRFUwpYWfPspzkpGr55aOL2i2PDN-WoeWhJT9oz5ac\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"JzT6Ef0DVyz74r3KkFAZ5HnLWrijbgWn_HM2t6FvNQsDyqqz4wWvV1cVJ1su6d5hu9ifNfrVsnm6FxSvzRo_jw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9db9337efac9219f0b116b481aa91db285636f91ca79310649aaf42bd8ead7e8363dc7b745cf429c01ce7775bc37cdc593d68aecee375819d823a7e82b52cdeb1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NRt-KYE4bzXmrTuDTEvU6Sd0SlhltEGERo2YgRFsaVg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MnRFUwpYWfPspzkpGr55aOL2i2PDN-WoeWhJT9oz5ac\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"BXH-wsZk_oi2-qUzhv2m9OvCfQT3kFUBTBsi9igueog\"}"
