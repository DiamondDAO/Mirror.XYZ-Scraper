It empowers individuals to indulge in shopping, working, learning, as well as investing in property, essentially performing all actions/tasks as they would do in real life but within a digital construct. \\n\\nUnderstandably, the concept is still being explored and is yet to evolve to its true potential and practical application. However, it has garnered the attention of big names like Facebook and has succeeded in taking on the role of serving as a marketing platform.\\n\\nWhile a single metaverse seems like a distant reality, the growth of content, product placement, and other forms of advertisements within the space is gaining immense popularity. This popularity can be attributed to its appeal to the emerging young and technologically-savvy consumer base dominated by Millenials who have no qualms in browsing and buying online.\\n\\nOne cannot ignore the inevitability of the metaverse coming to its full form given the technology bolstering, it is witnessing significant growth at a lightning-fast speed.\\n\\nWhile many think the hype around the metaverse will fade, it is difficult to ignore the myriad opportunities the space has created for the advertising sector. \\n\\n**Enter Adshares.** \\n\\nAdshares is the answer to how to monetize metaverse. It is a **Web3 protocol for Metaverse space monetization.**\\n\\nAdshares is a peer-to-peer platform that allows the wider community to participate in DAO-style governance with the ability to earn the $ADS coin. The platform is a decentralized advertisement marketplace, not owned or centrally controlled by one entity, rather by the community that uses it. Users are rewarded for holding the ADS coin. Adshares started about four years ago when developers introduced the protocol enabling anyone to build their own adserver using available open-source blockchain code. The team at Adshares has managed to create a transparent and fair ecosystem for all participants.\\n\\n*\\\"Adshares Adserver platforms allow users to rent space inside Metaverse, blockchain games, NFT exhibitions and websites.\\\"*\\n\\nThe marketing industry has seen phenomenal changes just like any other industry and over time, the power seems to be vested with the likes of a select few. Amazon, Google, Facebook- ring any bells? For example, Google Adsense takes roughly a third of the money when it comes to their advertisers' budget to simply connect the ads to their publisher.\\n\\n**A closer look at Adshares**\\n\\nSince its inception in 2017, the Adshares platform has been responsible for providing a direct connection between Publishers and Advertisers through the use of blockchain technology enabling contracts to be entered without intermediaries. A monthly ad impression surpassing 200 million is testimony to its offering and its commitment to expand the Adshares ecosystem.\\n\\nAdshares' ultimate goal is to place ads in games, events, billboards, etc. that form part of the metaverse. Pledged to end Google’s monopoly within the advertising space, Adshares allows anyone to enter without a start-up fee. Moreover, it permits users to choose ads they wish to see sans restrictions and with low fees. \\n\\n“Adshares network currently has more than **500 publishers**. The platform uses blockchain technology to connect publishers and advertisers in one ecosystem allowing them to make direct contracts within the network. Using Adshares open-source software, anyone can join the ecosystem and start their ad-related services in a just, transparent, and egalitarian marketplace “, a statement made by the CEO of Adshares Network, Krzysztof Bochenek.\\n\\nMoreover, the network operates on its own blockchain (referred to as an Enterprise Service Chain) developed by the founders. It offers PM, CPA, popup, and pop-under campaigns enabling advertisers to reach a larger audience adding to their earnings.\\n\\nWeb3 provides the perfect platform for marketers to better match their products to people. While we’re still in the midst of transitioning to this new digital ecosystem it has the potential to disrupt the entire advertising industry. And Adshares isn't aimed at being a mere alternative to Google it is \\\"**likely to become GoogleAds successor\\\".** No other project has approached the advertising sector with the aim of decentralization. Furthermore, recognizing Web3 solutions powered by blockchain technology and high throughput, Adshares has emerged as the front runner.\\n\\n \\n\\n**Features**\\n\\n* **Speed**: AdShares can process 1M tx/s\\n* **High Performance**: AdShares can maintain very low transactions fees\\n* **Privacy**: AdShares runs ads without using your private data\\n* **Staking**: AdShares lets you earn staking rewards\\n* **Middleman Elimination**: AdShares allows direct contacts between Advertisers & Publishers\\n* **Cross-chain**: Users can stake ADS on different chains\\n\\n \\n\\n**Advantages**\\n\\n* Highly resistant to censorship issues and transparent\\n* Imposition of low fees when compared to mainstream counterparts\\n* Instant approval ad network requiring only an email address\\n* Increased freedom as Publishers get to decide what content can be displayed\\n* Ease of joining the network as no minimum budget is required \\n* Highly secure (inbuilt 2FA and a distinct two-tier node structure) and fully operational network \\n\\n \\n\\nThe digital advertising space apart from being monopolized is plagued by high fees, hidden charges, censorship, and lack of transparency. Blockchain-based advertising solutions are aimed at alleviating the vulnerability and concerns associated with this space. One often gets to hear how blockchain technology will solve the looming data privacy issues and clean up the supply chain, but Adshares delivers on these promises. It assures no intermediaries, brings transparency to the supply chain, and eliminates fraud.\\n\\nIt's evident that we're transitioning towards a new, user-controlled Web3 Internet. And, the Web3 revolution is bound to positively impact the ever-complex digital marketing space. *Adshares appears as the perfect Web3 protocol for programmable advertisement with more than 200M ad impressions per month and 500+ publishers.*\\n\\n \\n\\n**Socials**\\n\\n[Substack](https://everythingblockchain.substack.com/account?utm_source=menu-dropdown),  [Loop](https://www.loop.markets/?ref=39055), [Torum](https://www.torum.com/signup?referral_code=cyekmyster), [Odysee](https://odysee.com/$/invite/@Cyekmyster:3), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cyekmyster), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkcc6EceEAu1sMoi2dKczCQ), [Read.cash](https://read.cash/r/Cyekmyster), [Publish0x](https://www.publish0x.com/?a=QBeXonk5dy),[ Presearch](https://www.presearch.org/signup?rid=2491437), [Medium](https://medium.com/@everythingblockchain), [Noisecash](https://noise.cash/u/Everythingblockchain)\\n\\nCrypto Taps [Pipeflare](https://pipeflare.io/r/9d5x), [GlobalHive](https://globalhive.io/r/148547), [GetZen](https://getzen.cash/auth/register?ref=443574) for some free crypto\\n\\nExchange on [SwapSpace](https://swapspace.co?ref=155495dbc33364ec9a4631bd)\\n\\nFor price updates, check [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/?utm_source=cmckol&utm_medium=multi&utm_campaign=boa417wqp60w) or download the app on [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/app/coinmarketcap/id1282107098)/ [Google](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinmarketcap.android)\\n\\nJoin CMC for [Airdrops](https://coinmarketcap.com/airdrop/?utm_source=cmckol&utm_medium=multi&utm_campaign=boa417wqp60w), [Diamonds](https://coinmarketcap.com/account/my-diamonds/?utm_source=cmckol&utm_medium=multi&utm_campaign=boa417wqp60w), [Learn&Earn](https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/?utm_source=cmckol&utm_medium=multi&utm_campaign=boa417wqp60w)\\n\\nOn [Telegram(G)](https://t.me/CoinMarketCap), [Telegram(EN)](https://t.me/CoinMarketCapEN), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CoinMarketCap), [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/CoinMarketCap), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/CoinMarketCap), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/CoinMarketCap)\\n\\nCreate your crypto [Watchlist](https://coinmarketcap.com/watchlist/?utm_source=cmckol&utm_medium=multi&utm_campaign=boa417wqp60w) or track your [Portfolio](https://coinmarketcap.com/portfolio-tracker/?utm_source=cmckol&utm_medium=multi&utm_campaign=boa417wqp60w) on Coinmarketcap\",\"timestamp\":1642050921,\"title\":\"AdShares - Give network to the community\"},\"digest\":\"bI0ZkCuqjfqAc0h7XZBeVdpMc9xPx0Kuo_SkfLhIehQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x48c7e0db3DAd3FE4Eb0513b86fe5C38ebB4E0F91\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wjr3N2azxpZUe4PTP7snGoP9ffUQymG1cgrAtosGfUU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TO3T0NURhy9b553JpyKsEH5WqpnrHjOs6F1a3wY6P-I\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"x-xUhpw66ICfcSgPVKwvz4iKqC9LNQGE3hQy3wjAV70D1awFLWVlHyodFoCoEeFH-_2CYnZhflvjtIWOGNmesQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4e50174caab57b1b32cbb7dcf669e680a7c8fc4739c8cbe579a8ac073fae55d6553f26ee0af8f3b1e1de20850ec1d6d47134c220ae68bfcaf6dd08d4e80021331b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wjr3N2azxpZUe4PTP7snGoP9ffUQymG1cgrAtosGfUU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TO3T0NURhy9b553JpyKsEH5WqpnrHjOs6F1a3wY6P-I\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"bI0ZkCuqjfqAc0h7XZBeVdpMc9xPx0Kuo_SkfLhIehQ\"}"
