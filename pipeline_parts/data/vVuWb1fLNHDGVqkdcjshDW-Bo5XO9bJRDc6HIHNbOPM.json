"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"It has been 144 days since my last day at Facebook (sorry, Meta 😉), but where I’ve been, it feels like I’m coming back up for air after years away. I have become completely obsessed with the emerging trends of web3 and how NFTs/crypto will continue to disrupt the systems around us. so much so that I’ve taken the leap to dedicate my full time and energy to educating, building, and shaping the ecosystem. more to come on this ;) \\n\\nTLDR on what I've been up to:\\n\\n* Started a new job at Reddit 141 days ago 🥳 \\n* Completely fell down the web3 rabbit hole 🐇 🕳 \\n* Used [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ldf_gm) for the first time in 10 years 🐦 \\n* Spent an embarrassing amount of money on jpegs 💰 \\n* [Sold my first NFT artwork](https://foundation.app/@ldf/\\\\~/91474) 🖼 \\n* Made lifelong friends with people whose real names I do not know 🫂 \\n* Created the [@womeninnfts](https://twitter.com/womeninnfts) Twitter to support increased diversity in the web3 ecosystem 👧 \\n* Interviewed a few of my personal heroes in the NFT space (links below) 🎙 \\n* [Minted my resignation letter](https://opensea.io/assets/0xa564503e679ad08576ffe973d512470d95d2f24b/1) from Reddit on my own custom smart contract 🥂\\n* Saw my artwork displayed in [digital galleries](https://oncyber.io/6529gm) and Times Square 🌆 \\n* Spoke at Miami Crypto World (my first conference!) about the digital in-between 🔊 \\n* Helped numerous friends find their way into web3 full-time 🤗 \\n* And more I can’t discuss (yet)…. 🤫 \\n\\nI have been especially bad at keeping up with all of the various communication channels over the last few months, and am going to begin writing more frequently to better distill all of the trends, implications and notable updates coming out of web3.\\n\\nIn particular, a few that might be relevant to many of you:\\n\\n* The evolution of brand building in this next era of the internet (community, contribution, ownership, and creator economies)\\n* The rising importance of digital identity and implications for consumer expectations and experiences (especially the evolution of what data privacy means)\\n* DAOs and the future of work/decentralization of human capital\\n* Building loyalty through NFTs and the gamification of everything\\n* The power of memes and role of storytelling in an increasingly automated world\\n* The decentralization and gig-ification of supply chains and impact of interoperability (ie curation and remixing of IP)\\n* The importance of maintaining an open metaverse and what this means for the monetization models of the future\\n* Social currency, the collateralization of culture and the financialization of reputation\\n* And so much more….\\n\\nI can’t wait to share what I’ve learned, catch up with what you’ve been up to and bring you into the constantly evolving conversations around our shared future. The biggest thing I’ve learned is how much there is still to learn. Anyone who professes to be an expert in this space is a sure red flag 🚩. Those who are curious will succeed long term, and I believe many of you have so much wisdom, insight, and perspective to offer - should you be open to it.\\n\\nWhere to start:\\n\\n* Follow me on Twitter [@ldf_gm](https://twitter.com/ldf_gm)\\n* [Schedule some time](https://calendly.com/delfabz) for us to catch up\\n* Let me know what you’d like to see from me!
