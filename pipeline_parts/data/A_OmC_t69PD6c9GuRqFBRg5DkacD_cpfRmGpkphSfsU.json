"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"MEME.COM is a perfect example of the “MEME economy”, which uses cryptocurrency and entertainment to measure the value of Internet content.Meme.com can be considered a child of Wikipedia and Dogecoin-a place where people explore different memes and trends on the Internet. It enables users to create MEME tokens based on the trends they represent or the perceived value of MEME. The content of each MEME is determined by the community. The best MEME will be rewarded every month, and the reward also includes a special NFT.\\n\\n$MEM is the native token of Meme.com along with all its products. It includes the following utilities:\\n\\n* Buy Meme tokens in the Meme market\\n* Create and upgrade Marble cards\\n* Pay platform fees, such as content submission\\n* Staking\\n* DAO Governance\\n\\nThe total token supply of $MEM is 100,000,000, which will be broken down by community, investors, teams, and consultants.\\n\\n## Token Distribution\\n\\n* **Community/Ecosystem**\\n\\n46% of the $MEM supply is reserved for community distribution, including platform staking rewards, airdrops, and other activities hat benefit the community and projects.\\n\\n* **Investor**\\n\\n27% of the total supply of $MEM is reserved for early investors. Unlock between 6 and 36 months.\\n\\n* **Team**\\n\\nThe Meme.com team is allocated with 25% of the total supply of $MEM.\\n\\n* **Consultant**\\n\\nThe project consultants have received 1.1% of the total supply of $MEM.\\n\\n## Why Meme.com?\\n\\n* **Cryptocurrency Section**\\n\\nDespite its controversy, the success of Dogecoin shows that MEME can be monetized and has financial value.MEME derives value from their remixes, reposts, and re-editing. They have the ability to spread from person to person in the culture of imitation. It usually follows with symbolic meanings that represent specific phenomena or themes. Let us take Pepe The Frog as an example. Although the original artist Matt Furie was rewarded for creating one of the most famous MEME, the original work did not give it real value in the beginning. It is a MEME, emoji, stickers, etc. created with Pepe The Frog as the theme.\\n\\nHowever, it is well known that MEME is difficult to monetize. Anyone can create a MEME with little control over how it will be used later. Most people monetize with MEME through social media (by converting MEME into content for advertising purposes) and MEME sales (creating MEME on demand). Normally, the original creators of MEME cannot benefit from the subsequent success of their MEME.\\n\\nJamie Burke said: “MEME is a meta-narrative that promotes today’s culture. They may be the ultimate language and social currency, driving most of the sharing, following, and final advertising expenditures on the Internet. However, their creators, whether they are the initiators or participants of MEME evolution, usually get very little economic gain from their success.\\n\\n* **Project Advantage**\\n\\n***Early Advantages and Uniqueness***\\n\\nMeme.com (formerly Marble. Cards) was launched by Johan Unger and Mattias Tyrberg in January 2019. It is one of the oldest NFT projects on the Ethereum blockchain. Currently, there are more than 100,000 NFT cards minted by users on the platform.Meme.com enables people to use meme coins and encrypted collectibles to quantify the value of trends. People can use Meme.com and “marbling” to express appreciation for a given webpage by adding a unique frame to the link of that webpage. The most significant benefits for creators include:\\n\\n* Encourage fans to create and collect stories around the creator’s content.\\n* When fans show off their favorite cards, creators are encouraged to sign the cards and gain positive visibility.\\n* Enable creators to earn money when they sell verified cards or perform well in the game.\\n* Enable verification of cards that the creator thinks resonate with their image.\\n* Allows the cards to be verified and use the bidding system to achieve monetization.\\n\\nMEME.COM is the first multi-dimensional project aimed at MEME economy around the content generation and NFT. It should have the early advantage of the track. On the one hand, it uses speculation and token/NFTrewards to build a market around the popularity of MEMEs so as to be able to determine which MEMEs people like most. On the other hand, charging the fees generated by the platform and rewarding the best meme creation can empower meme creators and artists.\\n\\n**Products Highlight**\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QghbmPCD9ifZUVvmcCFeP.png?height=866&width=1024)\\n\\nOn the Meme market page, the project is gradually launching all top Meme tokens on the Meme market page.\\n\\nMeme Token is a membership badge whose value comes from the perceived value of this trend.\\n\\nClicking any token image will take the user to the Meme Token page:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VQDdg1uIi7pF1cT2PPaPt.png?height=852&width=1024)\\n\\nUsers can interact with Meme Token here:\\n\\n* Buying and selling;\\n* View statistics and data;\\n* Find the highest-ranked Marble Cards;\\n* When buying or selling Meme tokens, there is a 2.5% fee. The money enters the treasure house of Meme Token and is used for voting by Token holders.\\n\\nUsers can track the Meme tokens they hold on their portfolio pages. In subsequent versions, users will be able to use the Meme tokens they hold to earn rare NFTs and other tokens.\\n\\n## Founder and Investment Team\\n\\nThe two founders of Meme.com are serial entrepreneurs, and Johan Unger founded his first company in the field of online content when he was in college. Meme.com is his third company. And Mattias has more than 10 years of continuous entrepreneurial experience in the field of technology and online content. The founding team has always been interested in how people consume and share content on the Internet. Based on this vision, Meme.com, a platform that uses encryption technology to measure the value of content, was born.\\n\\nSince the value of this platform and its ability to positively influence people who create and share excellent content, more than a dozen investors, including Moon Capital, Digital Finance Group, Morningstar, Blockhype, and Spark Digital Capital, participated in the first round of financing of Meme.com.In addition, there are two angel investors, Gabby Dizon, CEO of Altitude Games, and Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon, whose personal investments have been invested in supporting the development of Meme.com.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe prevalence of Meme culture around the world makes the prospect of the MEME section full of potentials. Hope that Meme.com combined with NFT will bring us more surprises on the road of future development.\",\"timestamp\":1633685003,\"title\":\"Moon Capital Portfolio-Meme.com\"},\"digest\":\"LlZa13mWTiTRLd74cFQgIChbufEsHa13nO4_UzLGVxM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xDF55bBE2e152E55644C531eCf8697752BcCdb0C0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ehT7SjZdpNLNKWMgEbkx4QtHLRkpociE5zfpMJr0190\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"l2S51I8wSX03KzqYqpqkhUx7uSEIe6EDdWkr7dxC3M8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ghHVtajQlnar9UeCTcAHOAPJwToD3LNMjXCL6zyrZveVZIshln5cQV4CZBYCZJAQf4XUpn7bL_tx42hGmyFwiw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x99612e522cb568fd49a8a487325fa05fbd00864af2eee43af2b060317f266c9c73e167fb8aefb3e8215ad19f7720cd61afb54f7e45a3b98b2fdbee0e73dac6d81c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ehT7SjZdpNLNKWMgEbkx4QtHLRkpociE5zfpMJr0190\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"l2S51I8wSX03KzqYqpqkhUx7uSEIe6EDdWkr7dxC3M8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"LlZa13mWTiTRLd74cFQgIChbufEsHa13nO4_UzLGVxM\"}"
