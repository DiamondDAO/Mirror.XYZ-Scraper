"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1993 The Internet\\n\\nIt was a million machine landscape of 3 dozen nations.\\n\\nA long secret war, the Cold War, was ending. The USSR was gone, POTUS 42 wanted to invest a \\\"peace dividend\\\" on a network. Less than a quarter of the US had computers, and only 3 percent of schools were connected.\\n\\nThe new network was like a young solar system growing from the dust of an older system. Information archives had accumulated for 20 years. Layers of information sediment were building.\\n\\nThere were hundreds of archives but no-one bothered to track them. How could users find and mine the deposits of data that were multiplying? There were \\\"internet hunts\\\" for information.\\n\\n\\\"Until recently, only intrepid researchers and networking gurus understood enough about network addressing, user command interfaces, and technical tricks to use the Internet for more than electronic mail.\\n\\nNew navigation tools--easy to use, widely available, and free--have dramatically changed this. Now anyone can, in a matter of minutes, learn to explore from Sweden to Singapore\\\" (U. Penn Online Magazine, February 1993)\\n\\nThe tools had names foreign to most: Archie, Gopher, Veronica, WAIS, and World-Wide Web. The name of the last one stuck the longest but there were doubts. There were skeptics.\\n\\n\\\"Although much admired by many in the Internet community for the elegance of its design, WWW has not proliferated as has Gopher....\\\"\\n\\nThat would change, the system was growing and evolving, fast.\\n\\nThe hunt was on.\\n\\n**2877 EARTH, THE NECKLACE, MARS CONSULATE**\\n\\nA few months ago, friends found me at my hangouts, where we drank in memory of comrades we lost and loved ones caught in the crossfire between the powers-that-be. I was a mess.\\n\\nFriends cleaned me up, it worked for awhile. It wouldn't last long.\\n\\nAfter one too many times of a friend bailing me out of a constable's holding cell, out of respect for the uniform and the \\\"story\\\" of who I was, and in memory of my boy, they sat me down with a choice.\\n\\n\\\"Big Jake, we love you, we loved your boy too, many of us owe our lives to you. Your boy gave his life for many. But you need to work.\\n\\nThe Long War is over, the one thing we wanted most of all. Only problem is it wasn't on our terms. It wasn't on anyone's terms. The 'Boxes' on both sides took over.\\n\\nJake, we pulled some strings. You're going to Earth. Not marching in a victory parade. After Mother Mars cleaned the dust from her vents, she’s starting over. Our job is to win the new peace.\\n\\nThe 'Boxes' are forming a new government. It looks like they took a new name for themselves, \\\"The Fosters\\\". There will be 2 other arms of a new government, made of regular humans. Rumor is it will be called 'The Triumvirate'.\\n\\nAnyway, we can't let the Earthers get the edge. We have a seat at the new table. You're going as an \\\"attache\\\", posted on Earth. There’s a new race. Nobody wants to be left out of the party.\\\"\\n\\nA few weeks later, in a new uniform, I was on a transport to Earth.\\n\\nThat's when I met the girl.
