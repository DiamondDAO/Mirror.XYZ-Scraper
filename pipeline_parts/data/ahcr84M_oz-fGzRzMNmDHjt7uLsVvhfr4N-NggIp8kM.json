"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"shiny that rolled back again as the wave receded.  The next influx beached it clear, and Geddie picked it up.  The thing was a long-necked wine bottle of colorless glass.  The cork had been driven in tightly to the level of the mouth, and the end covered with dark-red sealing-wax.  The bottle contained only what seemed to be a sheet of paper, much curled from the manipulation it had undergone while being inserted.  In the sealing-wax was the impression of a seal--probably of a signet-ring, bearing the initials of a monogram; but the impression had been hastily made, and the letters were past anything more certain than a shrewd conjecture.  Ida Payne had always worn a signet-ring in preference to any other finger decoration.  Geddie thought he could make out the familiar \\\"I P\\\"; and a queer sensation of disquietude went over him.  More personal and intimate was this reminder of her than had been the sight of the vessel she was doubtless on. He walked back to his house, and set the bottle on his desk.\\n\\nThrowing off his hat and coat, and lighting a lamp--for the night had crowded precipitately upon the brief twilight--he began to examine his piece of sea salvage.\\n\\nBy holding the bottle near the light and turning it judiciously, he made out that it contained a double sheet of note-paper filled with close writing; further, that the paper was of the same size and shade as that always used by Ida; and that, to the best of his belief, the handwriting was hers.  The imperfect glass of the bottle so distorted the rays of light that he could read no word of the writing; but certain capital letters, of which he caught comprehensive glimpses, were Ida's, he felt sure.\\n\\nThere was a little smile both of perplexity and amusement in Geddie's eyes as he set the bottle down, and laid three cigars side by side on his desk.  He fetched his steamer chair from the gallery, and stretched himself comfortably.  He would smoke those three cigars while considering the problem.\\n\\nFor it amounted to a problem.  He almost wished that he had not found the bottle; but the bottle was there.  Why should it have drifted in from the sea, whence come so many disquieting things, to disturb his peace?\\n\\nIn this dreamy land, where time seemed so redundant, he had fallen into the habit of bestowing much thought upon even trifling matters.\\n\\nHe bagan to speculate upon many fanciful theories concerning the story of the bottle, rejecting each in turn.\\n\\nShips in danger of wreck or disablement sometimes cast forth such precarious messengers calling for aid.  But he had seen the \\\\~Idalia\\\\~ not three hours before, safe and speeding.  Suppose the crew had mutinied and imprisoned the passengers below, and the message was one begging for succor!  But, premising such an improbable outrage, would the agitated captives have taken the pains to fill four pages of note-paper with carefully penned arguments to their rescue.\\n\\nThus by elimination he soon rid the matter of the more unlikely theories, and was reduced--though aversely--to the less assailable ones that the bottle contained a message to himself.  Ida knew he was in Coralio; she must have launched the bottle while the yacht was passing and the wind blowing fairly toward the shore.\\n\\nAs soon as Geddie reached this conclusion a wrinkle came between his brows and a stubborn look settled around his mouth.  He sat looking out through the doorway at the gigantic fire-flies traversing the quiet streets.\\n\\nIf this was a message to him from Ida, what could it mean save an overture at reconciliation?  And if that, why had she not used the same methods of the post instead of this uncertain and even flippant means of communication?  A note in an empty bottle, cast into the sea!  There was something light and frivolous about it, if not actually contemptuous.\\n\\nThe thought stirred his pride, and subdued whatever emotions had been resurrected by the finding of the bottle.\\n\\nGeddie put on his coat and hat and walked out.  He followed a street that led him along the border of the little plaza where a band was playing and people were rambling, care-free and indolent.  Some timorous \\\\~senoritas\\\\~ scurrying past with fire-flies tangled in the jetty braids of their hair glanced at him with shy, flattering eyes. The air was languorous with the scent of jasmin and orange-blossoms.\\n\\nThe consul stayed his steps at the house of Bernard Brannigan.  Paula was swinging in a hammock on the gallery.  She rose from it like a bird from its nest.  The color came to her cheeck at the sound of Geddie's voice.\\n\\nHe was charmed at the sight of her costume--a flounced muslin dress, with a little jacket of white flannel, all made with neatness and style.  He suggested a stroll, and they walked out to the old Indian well on the hill road.  They sat on the curb, and there Geddie made the expected but long-deferred speech.  Certain though he had been that she would not say him nay, he was still thrilled at the completeness and sweetness of her surrender.  Here was surely a heart made for love and steadfastness.  Here was no caprice or questionings or captious standards of convention.\\n\\nWhen Geddie kissed Paula at her door that night he was happier than he had ever been before.  \\\"Here in this hollow lotus land, ever to live and lie reclined\\\" seemed to him, as it has seemed to many mariners, the best as well as the easiest.  His future would be an ideal one.  He had attained a Paradise without a serpent.  His Eve would be indeed a part of him, unbeguiled, and therefore more beguiling.  He had made his decision tonight, and his heart was full of serene, assured content.\\n\\nGeddie went back to his house whistling that finest and saddest love song, \\\"La Golondrina.\\\"  At the door his tame monkey leaped down from his shelf, chattering briskly.  The consul turned to his desk to get him some nuts he usually kept there.  Reaching in the half-darkness, his hand struck against the bottle.  He started as if he had touched the cold rotundity of a serpent.\\n\\nHe had forgotten that the bottle was there.\\n\\nHe lighted the lamp and fed the monkey.  Then, very deliberately, he lighted a cigar, and took the bottle in his hand, and walked down the path to the beach.\\n\\nThere was a moon, and the sea was glorious.  The breeze had shifted, as it did each evening, and was now rushing steadily seaward.\\n\\nStepping to the water's edge, Geddie hurled the unopened bottle far out into the sea.  It disappeared for a moment, and then shot upward twice its length.  Geddie stood still, watching it.  The moonlight was so bright that he could see it bobbing up and down with the little waves.  Slowly it receded from the shore, flashing and turning as it went.  The wind was carrying it out to sea.  Soon it became a mere speck, doubtfully discerned at irregular intervals; and then the mystery of it was swallowed up by the greater mystery of the ocean. Geddie stood still upon the beach, smoking and looking out upon the water.\\n\\n\\\"Simon!--Oh, Simon!--Wake up there, Simon!\\\" bawled a sonorous voice at the edge of the water.\\n\\nOld Simon Cruz was a half-breed fisherman and smuggler who lived in a hut on the beach.  Out of his earliest nap Simon was thus awakened.\\n\\nHe slipped on his shoes and went outside.  Just landing from one of the \\\\~Valhalla's\\\\~ boats was the third mate of that vessel, who was an acquaintance of Simon's, and three sailors from the fruiter.\\n\\n\\\"Go up, Simon,\\\" called the mate, \\\"and find Doctor Gregg or Mr. Goodwin or anybody that's a friend to Mr. Geddie, and bring 'em here at once.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Saints of the skies!\\\" said Simon, sleepily, \\\"nothing has happened to Mr. Geddie?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He's under that tarpauling,\\\" said the mate, pointing to the boat, \\\"and he's rather more than half drowned.  We seen him from the steamer nearly a mile out from shore, swimmin' like mad after a bottle that was floatin' in the water, outward bound.  We lowered the gig and started for him.  He nearly had his hand on the bottle, when he gave out and went under.  We pulled him out in time to save him, maybe; but the doctor is the one to decide that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A bottle?\\\" said the old man, rubbing his eyes.  He was not yet fully awake.  \\\"Where is the bottle?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Driftin' along out there some'eres,\\\" said the mate, jerking his thumb toward the sea.  \\\"Get on with you, Simon.\\\"\\n\\nIII\\n\\nSmith\\n\\nGoodwin and the ardent patriot, Zavalla, took all the precautions that their foresight could contrive to prevent the escape of President Miraflores and his companion.  The sent trusted messengers up the coast to Solitas and Alazan to warn the local leaders of the flight, and to instruct them to patrol the water line and arrest the fugitives at all hazards should they reveal themselves in that territory.  After this was done there remained only to cover the district about Coralio and await the coming of the quarry. The nets were well spread.  The roads were so few, the opportunities for embarkation so limited, and the two or three probable points of exit so well guarded that it would be strange indeed if there should slip through the meshes so much of the country's dignity, romance, and collateral.  The president would, without doubt, move as secretly as possible, and endeavor to board a vessel by stealth from some secluded point along the shore.\\n\\nOn the fourth day after the receipt of Englehart's telegram the \\\\~Karlsefin\\\\~, a Norwegian steamer chartered by the New Orleans fruit trade, anchored off Coralio with three horse toots of her siren. The \\\\~Karlesfin\\\\~ ws not one of the line operated by the Vesuvius Fruit Company.  She was something of a dilettante, doing odd jobs for a company that was scarcely important enough to figure as a rival to the Vesuvius.  The movements of the \\\\~Karlesfin\\\\~ were dependent upon the state of the market.  Sometimes she would ply steadily between the Spanish Main and New Orleans in the regular transport of fruit; next she would be maing erratic trips to Mobile or Charleston, or even as far north as New York, according to the distribution of the fruit supply.\\n\\nGoodwin lounged upon the beach with the susual crowd of idlers that had gathered to view the steamer.  Now that President Miraflores might be expected to reach the borders of his abjured country at any time, the orders were to keep a strict and unrelenting watch.  Every vessel that approached the shores might now be considered a possible means of escape for the fugitives; and an eye was kept even on the slopes and dories that belonged to the sea-going contingent of Coralio.  Goodwin and Zavalla moved everywhere, but without ostentation, watching the loopholes of escape.\\n\\nThe customs official crowded importantly into their boat and rowed out to the \\\\~Karlesfin\\\\~.  A boat from the steamer landed her purser with his papers, and took out the quarantine doctor with his green umbrella and clinical thermometer.  Next a swarm of Caribs began to load upon lighters the thousands of bunches of bananas heaped upon the shore and row them out to the steamer.  The \\\\~Karlesfin\\\\~ had no passenger list, and was soon done with the attention of the authorities.  The purser declared that the steamer would remain at anchor until morning, taking on her fruit during the night. The \\\\~Karlesfin\\\\~ had come, he said, from New York, to which port her latest load of oranges and coconuts had been conveyed.  Two or three of the freighter sloops were engaged to assist in the work, for the captain was anxious to make a quick return in order to reap the advantage offered by a certain dearth of fruit in the States.\\n\\nAbout four o'clock in the afternoon another of those marine monsters, not very familiar in those waters, hove in sight, following the fateful \\\\~Idalia\\\\~--a graceful steam yacht, painted a light buff, clean-cut as a steel engraving.  The beautiful vessel hovered off shore, see-sawing the waves as lightly as a duck in a rain barrel. A swift boat manned by a crew in uniform came ashore, and a stocky- built man leaped to the sands.\\n\\nThe newcomer seemed to turn a disapproving eye upon the rather motley congregation of native Anchurians, and made his way at once toward Goodwin, who was the most conspicuously Anglo-Saxon figure present. Goodwin greeted him with courtesy.\\n\\nConversation developed that the newly landed one was named Smith, and that he had come in a yacht.  A meagre biography, truly; for the yacht was most apparent; and the \\\"Smith\\\" not beyond a reasonable guess before the revelation.  Yet to the eye of Goodwin, who has seen several things, there was a discrepancy between Smith and his yacht.  A bullet-headed man Smith was, with an oblique, dead eye and the moustache of a cocktail-mixer.  And unless he had shifted costumes before putting off for shore he had affronted the deck of his correct vessel clad in a pearl-gray derby, a gay plaid suit and vaudeville neckwear.  Men owning pleasure yachts generally harmonize better with them.\\n\\nSmith looked business, but he was no advertiser.  He commented upon the scenery, remarking upon its fidelity to the pictures in the geography; and then inquired for the United States consul.  Goodwin pointed out the starred-and-striped bunting hanging from above the little consulate, which was concealed behind the orange-trees.\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Geddie, the consul, will be sure to be there,\\\" said Goodwin. \\\"He was very nearly drowned a few days ago while taking a swim in the sea, and the doctor has ordered him to remain indoors for some time.\\\"\\n\\nSmith ploughed his way through the sand to the consulate, his haberdashery creating violent discord against the smooth tropical blues and greens.\\n\\nGeddie was lounging in his hammock, somewhat pale of face and languid in pose.  On that night when the \\\\~Valhalla's\\\\~ boat had brought him ashore apparently drenched to death by the sea, Doctor Gregg and his other friends had toiled for hours to preserve the little spark of life that remained to him.  The bottle, with its impotent message, was gone out to sea, and the problem that it had provoked was reduced to a simple sum in addition--one and one make two, by the rule of arithmetic; one by the rule of romance.\\n\\nThere is a quaint old theory that man may have two souls--a peripheral one which serves ordinarily, and a central one which is stirred only at certain times, but then with activity and vigor. While under the domination of the former a man will shave, vote, pay taxes, give money to his family, buy subscription books and comport himself on the average plan.  But let the central soul suddenly become dominant, and he may, in the twinkling of an eye, turn upon the partner of his joys with furious execration; he may change his politics while you could snap your fingers; he may deal out deadly insult to his dearest friend; he may get him, instanter, to a monastery or a dance hall; he may elope, or hang himself--or he may write a song or poem, or kiss his wife unasked, or give his funds to the search of a microbe.  Then the peripheral soul will return; and we have our safe, sane citizen again.  It is but the revolt of the Ego against Order; and its effect is to shake up the atoms only that they may settle where they belong.\\n\\nGeddie's revulsion had been a mild one--no more than a swim in a summer sea after so inglorious an object as a drifting bottle. And now he was himself again.  Upon his desk, ready for the post, was a letter to his government tendering his resignation as consul, to be effective as soon as another could be appointed in his place. For Bernard Brannigan, who never did things in a half-way manner, was to take Geddie at once for a partner in his very profitable and various enterprises; and Paula was happily engaged in plans for refurnishing and decorating the upper story of the Brannigan house.\\n\\nThe consul rose from his hammock when he saw the conspicuous stranger at this door.\\n\\n\\\"Keep your seat, old man,\\\" said the visitor, with an airy wave of his large hand.  \\\"My name's Smith; and I've come in a yacht.  You are the consul--is that right?  A big, cool guy on the beach directed me here. Thought I'd pay my respects to the flag.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sit down, said Geddie.  \\\"I've been admiring your craft ever since it came in sight.  Looks like a fast sailer.  What's her tonnage?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Search me!\\\" said Smith.  \\\"I don't know what she weighs in at.  But she's got a tidy gait.  The \\\\~Rambler\\\\~--that's her name--don't take the dust of anything afloat.  This is my first trip on her.  I'm taking a squint along this coast just to get an idea of the countries where the rubber and red pepper and revolutions come from.  I had no idea there was so much scenery down here.  Why, Central Park ain't in it with this neck of the woods.  I'm from New York.  They get monkeys, and coconuts, and parrots down here--is that right?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We have them all,\\\" said Geddie.  \\\"I'm quite sure that our fauna and flora would take a prize over Central Park.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Maybe they would,\\\" admitted Smith, cheerfully.  \\\"I haven't seen them yet.  But I guess you've got us skinned on the animal and vegetation question.  You don't have much travel here, do you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Travel?\\\" queried the consul.  \\\"I suppose you mean passengers on steamers.  No; very few people land in Coralio.  An investor now and then--tourists and sightseers generally go further down the coast to one of the larger towns where there is a harbor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I see a ship out there loading up with bananas,\\\" said Smith.  \\\"Any passengers come on her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's the \\\\~Karlesfin\\\\~,\\\" said the consul.  \\\"She's a tramp fruiter-- made her last trip to New York, I believe.  No; she brought no passengers.  I saw her boat come ashore, and there was no one.  About the only exciting recreation we have here is watching steamers when they arrive; and a passenger on one of them generally causes the whole town to turn out.  If you are going to remain in Coralio a while, Mr. Smith, I'll be glad to take you around to meet some people.  There are four or five American chaps that are good to know, besides the native high-fliers.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thanks,\\\" said the yachtsman, \\\"but I wouldn't put you the trouble. I'd like to meet the guys you speak of, but I won't be here long enough to do much knocking around.  That cool gent on the beach spoke of a doctor; can you tell me where to find him?  The \\\\~Rambler\\\\~ ain't quite as steady on her feet as a Broadway hotel; and a fellow gets a touch of seasickness now and then.  Thought I'd strike the croaker for a handful of the little sugar pills, in case I need 'em.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You will be apt to find Doctor Gregg at the hotel,\\\" said the consul. \\\"You can see it from the door--it's that two-story building with the balcony, where the orange-trees are.\\\"\\n\\nThe Hotel de los Extranjeros was a dreary hostelry, in great disuse both by strangers and friends.  It stood at a corner of the Street of the Holy Sepulchre.  A grove of small orange-trees crowded against one side of it, enclosed by a low, rock wall over which a tall man might easily step.  The house was of plastered adobe, stained a hundred shades of color by the salt breeze and the sun.  Upon its upper balcony opened a central door and two windows containing broad jalousies instead of sashes.\\n\\nThe lower floor communicated by two doorways with the narrow, rock-paved sidewalk.  The \\\\~pulperia\\\\~--or drinking shop--of the proprietess, Madama Timotea Ortiz, occupied the ground floor.  On the bottles of brandy, \\\\~anisada\\\\~, Scotch \\\"smoke,\\\" and inexpensive wines behind the little counter the dust lay thick save where the fingers of infrequent customers had left irregular prints.  The upper story contained four or five guest-rooms which were rarely put to their destined use.  Sometimes a fruitgrower, riding in from his plantation to confer with his agent, would pass a melancholy night in the dismal upper story; sometimes a minor native official on some trifling government quest would have his pomp and majesty awed by Madama's sepulchral hospitality.  But Madama sat behind her bar content, not desiring to quarrel with Fate.  If any one required meat, drink or lodging at the Hotel de los Extranjeros they had but to come, and be served.  \\\\~Esta bueno\\\\~.  If they came not, why, then, they came not.  \\\\~Esta bueno\\\\~.\\n\\nAs the exceptional yachtsman was making his way down the precarious sidewalk of the Street of the Holy Sepulchre, the solitary permanent guest of that decaying hotel sat at its door, enjoying the breeze from the sea.\\n\\nDoctor Gregg, the quarantine physician, was a man of fifty or sixty, with a florid face and the longest beard between Topeka and Terra del Fuego.  He held his position by virtue of an appointment by the Board of Health of a seaport city in one of the Southern states. That city feared the ancient enemy of every Southern seaport--the yellow fever--and it was the duty of Doctor Gregg to examine crew and passengers of every vessel leaving Coralio for preliminary symptoms. The duties were light, and the salary, for one who lived in Coralio, ample.  Surplus time there was in plenty; and the good doctor added to his gains by a large private practice among the residents of the coast.  The fact that he did not know ten words of Spanish was no obstacle; a pulse could be felt and a fee collected without one being a linguist.  Add to the description the facts that the doctor had a story to tell concerning the operation of trepanning which no listener had ever allowed him to conclude, and that he believed in brandy as a prophylactic; and the special points of interest possessed by Doctor Gregg will have become exhausted.\\n\\nThe doctor had dragged a chair to the sidewalk.  He was coatless, and he leaned back against the wall and smoked, while he stroked his beard.  Surprise came into his pale blue eyes when he caught sight of Smith in his unusual and prismatic clothes.\\n\\n\\\"You're Doctor Gregg--is that right?\\\" said Smith, feeling the dog's head pin in his tie.  \\\"The constable--I mean the consul, told me you hung out at this caravansary.  My name's Smith; and I came in a yacht.  Taking a cruise around, looking at the monkeys and pineapple- trees.  Come inside and have a drink, Doc.  This cafe looks on the blink, but I guess it can set out something wet.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will join you, sir, in just a taste of brandy,\\\" said Doctor Gregg, rising quickly.  \\\"I find that as a prophylactic a little brandy is almost a necessity in this climate.\\\"\\n\\nAs they turned to enter the \\\\~pulperia\\\\~ a native man, barefoot, glided noiselessly up and addressed the doctor in Spanish.  He was yellowish-brown, like an over-ripe lemon; he wore a cotton shirt and ragged linen trousers girded by a leather belt.  His face was like an animal's, live and wary, but without promise of much intelligence. This man jabbered with animation and so much seriousness that it seemed a pity that his words were to be wasted.\\n\\nDoctor Gregg felt his pulse.\\n\\n\\\"You sick?\\\" he inquired.\\n\\n\\\"\\\\~Mi mujer es enferma en la casa,\\\\~\\\" said the man, thus endeavoring to convey the news, in the only language open to him, that his wife lay ill in her palm-thatched hut.\\n\\nThe doctor drew a handful of capsules filled with a white powder from his trousers pocket.  He counted out ten of them into the native's hand, and held up his forefinger impressively.\\n\\n\\\"Take one,\\\" said the doctor, \\\"every two hours.\\\"  He then held up two fingers, shaking them emphatically before the native's face.  Next he pulled out his watch and ran his finger round the dial twice.  Again the two fingers confronted the patient's nose.  \\\"Two--two--two hours,\\\" repeated the doctor.\\n\\n\\\"\\\\~Si, Senor,\\\\~\\\" said the native, sadly.\\n\\nHe pulled a cheap silver watch from his own pocket and laid it in the doctor's hand.  \\\"Me bring,\\\" said he, struggling painfully with his scant English, \\\"other watchy tomorrow,\\\" then he departed downheartedly with his capsules.\\n\\n\\\"A very ignorant race of people, sir,\\\" said the doctor, as he slipped the watch into his pocket.  \\\"He seems to have mistaken my directions for taking the physic for the fee.  However, it is all right.  He owes me an account, anyway.  The chances are that he won't bring the other watch.  You can't depend on anything they promise you.  About that drink, now?  How did you come to Coralio, Mr. Smith?  I was not aware that any boats except the \\\\~Karlesfin\\\\~ had arrived for some days.\\\"\\n\\nThe two leaned against the deserted bar; and Madama set out a bottle without waiting for the doctor's order.  There was no dust on it.\\n\\nAfter they had drank twice Smith said:\\n\\n\\\"You say there were no passengers on the \\\\~Karlesfin\\\\~, Doc?  Are you sure about that?  It seems to me I heard somebody down on the beach say that there was one or two aboard.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They were mistaken, sir.  I myself went out and put all hands through a medical examination, as usual.  The \\\\~Karlesfin\\\\~ sails as soon as she gets her bananas loaded, which will be about daylight in the morning, and she got everything ready this afternoon.  No, sir, there was no passenger list.  Like that Three-Star?  A French schooner landed two slooploads of it a month ago.  If any customs duties on it went to the distinguished republic of Anchuria you may have my hat.  If you won't have another, come out and let's sit in the cool a while.  It isn't often we exiles get a chance to talk with somebody from the outside world.\\\"\\n\\nThe doctor brought out another chair to the sidewalk for his new acquaintance.  The two seated themselves.\\n\\n\\\"You are a man of the world,\\\" said Doctor Gregg; \\\"a man of travel and experience.  Your decision in a matter of ethics and, no doubt, on the points of equity, ability and professional probity should be of value.  I would be glad if you will listen to the history of a case that I think stands unique in medical annals.\\n\\n\\\"About nine years ago, while I was engaged in the practice of medicine in my native city, I was called to treat a case of contusion of the skull.  I made the diagnosis that a splinter of bone was pressing upon the brain, and that the surgical operation known as trepanning was required.  However, as the patient was a gentleman of wealth and position, I called in for consultation Doctor--\\\"\\n\\nSmith  rose from his chair, and laid a hand, soft with apology, upon the doctor's shirt sleeve.\\n\\n\\\"Say, Doc,\\\" he said, solemnly, \\\"I want to hear that story.  You've got me interrested; and I don't want to miss the rest of it.  I know it's a loola by the way it begins; and I want to tell it at the next meeting of the Barney O'Flynn Association, if you don't mind. But I've got one or two matters to attend to first.  If I get 'em attended to in time I'll come right back and hear you spiel the rest before bedtime--is that right?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"By all means,\\\" said the doctor, \\\"get your business attended to, and then return.  I shall wait up for you.  You see, one of the most prominent physicians at the consultation diagnosed the trouble as a blood clot; another said it was an abscess, but I--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't tell me now, Doc.  Don't spoil the story.  Wait till I come back.  I want to hear it as it runs off the reel--is that right?\\\"\\n\\nThe mountains reached up their bulky shoulders to receive the level gallop of Apollo's homing steeds, the day died in the lagoons and in the shadowed banana groves and in the mangrove swamps, where the great blue crabs were beginning to crawl to land for their nightly ramble.  And it died, at last, upon the highest peaks.  Then the brief twilight, ephemeral as the flight of a moth, came and went; the Southern Cross peeped with its topmost eye above a row of palms, and the fire-flies heralded with their torches and approach of soft-footed night.\\n\\nIn the offing the \\\\~Karlesfin\\\\~ swayed at anchor, her lights seeming to penetrate the water to countless fathoms with their shimmering, lanceolate reflections.  The Caribs were busy loading her by means of the great lighters heaped full from the piles of fruit ranged upon the shore.\\n\\nOn the sandy beach, with his back against a coconut-tree and the stubs of many cigars lying around him, Smith sat waiting, never relaxing his sharp gaze in the direction of the steamer.\\n\\nThe incongruous yachtsman had concentrated his interest upon the innocent fruiter.  Twice had he been assured that no passengers had come to Coralio on board of her.  And yet, with a persistence not to be attributed to an idling voyager, he had appealed the case to the higher court of his own eyesight.  Surprisingly like some gay-coated lizard, he crouched at the foot of the coconut palm, and with the beady, shifting eyes of the selfsame reptile, sustained his espionage on the \\\\~Karlesfin\\\\~.\\n\\nOn the white sands a whiter gig belonging to the yacht was drawn up, guarded by one of the white-ducked crew.  Not far away in a \\\\~pulperia\\\\~ on the shore-following Calle Grande three other sailors swaggerred with their cues around Coralio's solitary billiard-table.  The boat lay there as if under orders to be ready for use at any moment. There was in the atmosphere a hint of expectation, of waiting for something to occur, which was foreign to the air of Coralio.\\n\\nLike some passing bird of brilliant plumage, Smith alights on this palmy shore but to preen his wings for an instant and then to fly away upon silent pinions.  When morning dawned there was no Smith, no waiting gig, no yacht in the offing, Smith left no intimation of his mission there, no footprints to show where he had followed the trail of his mystery on the sands of Coralio that night.  He came; he spake his strange jargon of the asphalt and the cafes; he sat under the coconut-tree, and vanished.  The next morning Coralio, Smithless, ate its fried plantain and said:  \\\"The man of pictured clothing went himself away.\\\"  With the \\\\~siesta\\\\~ the incident passed, yawning, into history.\\n\\nSo, for a time, must Smith pass behind the scenes of the play. He comes no more to Coralio, nor to Doctor Gregg, who sits in vain, wagging his redundant beard, waiting to enrich his derelict audience with his moving tale of trepanning and jealousy.\\n\\nBut prosperously to the lucidity of these loose pages, Smith shall flutter among them again.  In the nick of time he shall come to tell us why he strewed so many anxious cigar stumps around the coconut palm that night.  This he must do; for, when he sailed away before the dawn in his yacht \\\\~Rambler\\\\~, he carried with him the answer to a riddle so big and preposterous that few in Anchuria had ventured even to propound it.\\n\\nIV\\n\\nCaught\\n\\nThe plans for the detention of the flying President Miraflores and his companion at the coast line seemed hardly likely to fail.  Doctor Zavalla himself had gone to the port of Alazan to establish a guard at that point.  At Solitas the Liberal patriot Varras could be depended upon to keep close watch.  Goodwin held himself responsible for the district about Coralio.\\n\\nThe news of the president's flight had been disclosed to no one in the coast towns save trusted members of the ambitious political party that was desirous of succeeding to power.  The telegraph wire running from San Mateo to the coast had been cut far up on the mountain trail by an emissary of Zavalla's.  Long before this could be repaired and word received along it from the capital the fugitives would have reached the coast and the question of escape or capture been solved.\\n\\nGoodwin had stationed armed sentinels at frequent intervals along the shore for a mile in each direction from Coralio.  They were instructed to keep a vigilant lookout during the night to prevent Miraflores from attempting to embark stealthily by means of some boat or sloop found by chance at the water's edge.  A dozen patrols walked the streets of Coralio unsuspected, ready to intercept the truant official should he show himself there.\\n\\nGoodwin was very well convinced that no precautions had been overlooked.  He strolled about the streets that bore such high- sounding names and were but narrow, grass-covered lanes, lending his own aid to the vigil that had been intrusted to him by Bob Englehart.\\n\\nThe town had begun the tepid round of its nightly diversions.  A few leisurely dandies, cald in white duck, with flowing neckties, and swinging slim bamboo canes, threaded the grassy by-ways toward the houses of their favored senoritas.  Those who wooed the art of music dragged tirelessly at whining concertinas, or fingered lugubrious guitars at doors and windows.  An occasional soldier from the \\\\~cuartel\\\\~, with flapping straw hat, without coat or shoes, hurried by, balancing his long gun like a lance in one hand.  From every density of the foliage the giant tree frogs sounded their loud and irritating clatter.  Further out, the guttural cries of marauding baboons and the coughing of the alligators in the black estuaries fractured the vain silence of the wood.\\n\\nBy ten o'clock the streets were deserted.  The oil lamps that had burned, a sickly yellow, at random corners, had been extinguished by some economical civic agent.  Coralio lay sleeping calmly between toppling mountains and encroaching sea like a stolen babe in the arms of its abductors.  Somewhere over in that tropical darkness--perhaps already threading the profundities of the alluvial lowlands--the high adventurer and his mate were moving toward land's end.  The game of Fox-in-the-Morning should be coming soon to its close.\\n\\nGoodwin, at his deliberate gait, passed the long, low \\\\~cuartel\\\\~ where Coralio's contingent of Anchuria's military force slumbered, with its bare toes pointed heavenward.  There was a law that no civilian might come so near the headquarters of that citadel of war after nine o'clock, but Goodwin was always forgetting the minor statutes.\\n\\n\\\"\\\\~Quien vive,\\\\~\\\" shrieked the sentinel, wrestling prodigiously with his lengthy musket.\\n\\n\\\"\\\\~Americano,\\\\~\\\" growled Goodwin, without turning his head, and passed on, unhalted.\\n\\nTo the right he turned, and to the left up the street that ultimately reached the Plaza Nacional.  When within the toss of a cigar stump from the intersecting Street of the Holy Sepulchre, he stopped suddenly in the pathway.\\n\\nHe saw the form of a tall man, clothed in black and carrying a large valise, hurry down the cross-street in the direction of the beach. And Goodwin's second glance made him aware of a woman at the man's elbow on the farther side, who seemed to urge forward, if not even to assist, her companion in their swift but silent progress.  They were no Coralians, those two.\\n\\nGoodwin followed at increased speed, but without any of the artful tactics that are so dear to the heart of the sleuth.  The American was too broad to feel the instinct of the detective.  He stood as an agent for the people of Anchuria, and but for political reasons he would have demanded then and there the money.  It was the design of his party to secure the imperilled fund, to restore it to the treasury of the country, and to declare itself in power without bloodshed or resistance.\\n\\nThe couple halted at the door of the Hotel de los Extranjeros, and the man struck upon the wood with the impatience of one unused to his entry being stayed.  Madama was long in response, but after a time her light showed, the door was opened, and the guests housed.\\n\\nGoodwin stoodin the quiet street, lighting another cigar.  In two minutes, a faint gleam began to show between the slats of the jalousies in the upper story of the hotel.  \\\"They have engaged rooms,\\\" said Goodwin to himself.  \\\"So, then, their arrangements for sailing have yet to be made.\\\"\\n\\nAt the moment there came along one Esteban Delgado, a barber, an enemy to existing government, a jovial plotter against stagnation in any form.  This barber was one of Coralio's saddest dogs, often remaining out of doors as late as eleven, post meridian.  He was a partisan Liberal; and he greeted Goodwin with flatulent importance as a brother in the cause.  But he had something important to tell.\\n\\n\\\"What think you, Don Frank!\\\" he cried, in the universal tone of the conspirator.  \\\"I have tonight shaved \\\\~la barba\\\\~--what you call the 'weeskers' of the \\\\~Presidente\\\\~ himself, of this countree!  Consider! He sent for me to come.  In the poor \\\\~casita\\\\~ of an old woman he awaited me--in a verree leetle house in a dark place.  \\\\~Carramba!\\\\~ --el Senor Presidente to make himself thus secret and obscured! I shave a man and not see his face?  This gold piece he gave me, and said it was to be all quite still.  I think, Don Frank, there is what you call a chip over the bug.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have you ever seen President Miraflores before?\\\" asked Goodwin.\\n\\n\\\"But once,\\\" answered Esteban.  \\\"He is tall; and he had weeskers, verree black and sufficient.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Was any one else present when you shaved him?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"An old Indian woman, Senor, that belonged with the \\\\~casa\\\\~, and one senorita--a ladee of so much beautee!--\\\\~ah, Dios!\\\\~\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All right, Esteban,\\\" said Goodwin.  \\\"It's very lucky that you happened along with your tonsorial information.  The new administration will be likely to remember you for this.\\\"\\n\\nThen in a few words he made the barber acquainted with the crisis into which the affairs of the nation had culminated, and instructed him to remain outside, keeping watch upon the two sides of the hotel that looked upon the street, and observing whether any one should attempt to leave the house by any door or window.  Goodwin himself went to the door through which the guests had entered, opened it and stepped inside.\\n\\nMadama had returned downstairs from her journey above to see after the comfort of her lodgers.  Her candle stood upon the bar.  She was about to take a thimbleful of rum as a solace for having her rest disturbed.  She looked up without surprise or alarm as her third caller entered.\\n\\n\\\"Ah! it is the Senor Goodwin.  Not often does he honor my poor house with his presence.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I must come oftener,\\\" said Goodwin, with a Goodwin smile.  \\\"I hear that your cognac is the best between Belize to the north and Rio to the south.  Set out the bottle, Madama, and let us have the proof in \\\\~un vasito\\\\~ for each of us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My \\\\~aguardiente\\\\~,\\\" said Madama, with pride, \\\"is the best.  It grows, in beautiful bottles, in the dark places among the banana-trees. \\\\~Si, Senor\\\\~.  Only at midnight can they be picked by sailor-men who bring them, before daylight comes, to your back door.  Good \\\\~aguardiente\\\\~ is a verree difficult fruit to handle, Senor Goodwin.\\\"\\n\\nSmuggling, in Coralio, was much nearer than competition to being the life of trade.  One spoke of it slyly, yet with a certain conceit, when it had been well accomplished.\\n\\n\\\"You have guests in the house tonight,\\\" said Goodwin, laying a silver dollar upon the counter.\\n\\n\\\"Why not?\\\" said Madama, counting the change.  \\\"Two; but the smallest while finished to arrive.  One senor, not quite old, and one senorita of sufficient hadsomeness.  To their rooms they have ascended, not desiring the to-eat nor the to-drink.  Two rooms--\\\\~Numero\\\\~9 and \\\\~Numero\\\\~ 10.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I was expecting that gentleman and that lady,\\\" said Goodwin.  \\\"I have important \\\\~negocios\\\\~ that must be transacted.  Will you allow me to see them?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why not?\\\" sighed Madama, placidly.  \\\"Why should not Senor Goodwin ascend and speak to his friends?  \\\\~Esta bueno\\\\~.  Romm \\\\~Numero\\\\~ 9 and romm \\\\~Numero\\\\~ 10.\\\"\\n\\nGoodwin loosened in his coat pocket the American revolver that he carried, and ascended the steep, dark stairway.\\n\\nIn the hallway above, the saffron light from a hanging lamp allowed him to select the gaudy numbers on the doors.  He turned the knob on Number 9, entered and closed the door behind him.\\n\\nIf that was Isabel Guilbert seated by the table in that poorly furnished room, report had failed to do her charms justice.  She rested her head upon one hand.  Extreme fatigue was signified in every line of her figure; and upon her countenance a deep perplexity was written.  Her eyes were gray-irised, and of that mold that seems to have belonged to the orbs of all the famous queens of hearts. Their whites were singularly clear and brilliant, concealed above the irises by heavy horizontal lids, and showing a snowy line between them.  Such eyes denote great nobility, vigor, and, if you can conceive of it, a most generous selfishness.  She looked up when the American entered, with an expression of surprised inquiry, but without alarm.\\n\\nGoodwin took off his hat and seated himself, with his characteristic deliberate ease, upon a corner of the table.  He held a lighted cigar between his fingers.  He took this familiar course because he was sure that preliminaries would be wasted upon Miss Guilbert.  He knew her history, and the small part that the conventions had played in it.\\n\\n\\\"Good evening,\\\" he said.  \\\"Now, madame, let us come to business at once.  You will observe that I mention no names, but I know who is in the next room, and what he carries in that valise.  That is the point which brings me here.  I have come to dictate terms of surrender.\\\"\\n\\nThe lady neither moved nor replied, but steadily regarded the cigar in Goodwin's hand.\\n\\n\\\"We,\\\" continued the dictator, thoughtfully regarding the neat buckskin shoe on his gently swinging foot--\\\"I speak for a considerable majority of the people--demand the return of the stolen funds belonging to them.  Our terms go very little further than that.  They are very simple.  As an accredited spokesman, I promise that our interference will cease if they are accepted.  Give up the money, and you and your companion will be permitted to proceed wherever you will.  In fact, assistance will be given you in the matter of securing a passage by any outgoing vessel you may choose.  It is on my personal responsibility that I add congratulations to the gentleman in Number 10 upon his taste in feminine charms.\\\"\\n\\nReturning his cigar to his mouth, Goodwin observed her, and saw that her eyes followed it and rested upon it with icy and significant concentration.  Apparently she had not heard a word he had said. He understood, tossed the cigar out the window, and, with an amused laugh, slid from the table to his feet.\\n\\n\\\"That is better,\\\" said the lady.  \\\"It makes it possible for me to listen to you.  For a second lesson in good manners, you might now tell me by whom I am being insulted.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am sorry,\\\" said Goodwin, leaning one hand on the table, \\\"that my time is too brief for devoting much of it to a course of etiquette. Come, now; I appeal to you good sense.  You have shown yourself, in more than one instance, to be well aware of what is to your advantage.  This is an occasion that demands the exercise of your undoubted intelligence.  There is no mystery here.  I am Frank Goodwin; and I have come for the money.  I entered this room at a venture.  Had I entered the other I would have had it before me now. Do you want it in words?  The gentleman in Number 10 has betrayed a great trust.  He has robbed his people of a large sum, and it is I who will prevent their losing it.  I do not say who that gentleman is; but if I should be forced to see him and he should prove to be a certain high official of the republic, it will be my duty to arrest him.  The house is guarded.  I am offering you liberal terms.  It is not absolutely necessary that I confer personally with the gentleman in the next room.  Bring me the valise containing the money, and we will call the affair ended.\\\"\\n\\nThe lady arose from her chair and stood for a moment, thinking deeply.\\n\\n\\\"Do you live here, Mr. Goodwin?\\\" she asked, presently.\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What is your authority for this intrusion?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am an instrument of the republic.  I was advised by wire of the movements of the--gentleman in Number 10.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"May I ask you two or three questions?  I believe you to be a man more apt to be truthful than--timid.  What sort of town is this-- Coralio, I think they call it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not much of a town,\\\" said Goodwin, smiling.  \\\"A banana town, as they run.  Grass huts, 'dobes, five or six two-story houses, accomodations limited, population half-breed Spanish and Indian, Caribs and blackamoors.  No sidewalks to speak of, no amusements.  Rather unmoral.  That'a an offhand sketch, of course.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are there any inducements, say in a social or in a business way, for people to reside here?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes,\\\" answered Goodwin, smiling broadly.  \\\"There are no afternoon teas, no hand-organs, no department stores--and there is no extradition treaty.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He told me,\\\" went on the lady, speaking as if to herself, and with a slight frown, \\\"that there were towns on this coast of beauty and importance; that there was a pleasing social order--especially an American colony of cultured residents.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is an American colony,\\\" said Goodwin, gazing at her in some wonder.  \\\"Some of the members are all right.  Some are fugitives from justice from the States.  I recall two exiled bank presidents, one army paymaster under a cloud, a couple of manslayers, and a widow-- arsenic, I believe, was the suspicion in her case.  I myself complete the colony, but, as yet, I have not distinguished myself by any particular crime.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do not lose hope,\\\" said the lady, dryly; \\\"I see nothing in your actions tonight to guarantee you further obscurity.  Some mistake has been made; I do not know just where.  But \\\\~him\\\\~ you shall not disturb tonight.  The journey has fatigued him so that he has fallen asleep, I think, in his clothes.  You talk of stolen money!  I do not understand you.  Some mistake has been made.  I will convince you. Remain where you are and I will bring you the valise that you seem to covet so, and show it to you.\\\"\\n\\nShe moved toward the closed door that connected the two rooms, but stopped, and half turned and bestowed upon Goodwin a grave, searching look that ended in a quizzical smile.\\n\\n\\\"You force my door,\\\" she said, \\\"and you follow your ruffianly behavior with the basest accusations; and yet\\\"--she hesitated, as if to reconsider what she was about to say--\\\"and yet--it is a puzzling thing--I am sure there has been some mistake.\\\"\\n\\nShe took a step toward the door, but Goodwin stayed her by a light touch upon her arm.  I have said before that women turned to look at him in the streets.  He was the viking sort of man, big, good- looking, and with an air of kindly truculence.  She was dark and proud, glowing or pale as her mood moved her.  I do not know if Eve were light or dark, but if such a woman had stood in the garden I know that the apple would have been eaten.  This woman was to be Goodwin's fate, and he did not know it; but he must have felt the first throes of destiny, for, as he faced her, the knowledge of what report named her turned bitter in her throat.\\n\\n\\\"If there has been any mistake,\\\" he said, hotly, \\\"it was yours.  I do not blame the man who has lost his country, his honor, and is about to lose the poor consolation of his stolen riches as much as I blame you, for, by Heaven! I can very well see how he was brought to it. I can understand, and pity him.  It is such women as you that strew this degraded coast with wretched exiles, that make men forget their trusts, that drag--\\\"\\n\\nThe lady interrupted him with a weary gesture.\\n\\n\\\"There is no need to continue your insults,\\\" she said, coldly. \\\"I do not understand what you are saying, nor do I know what mad blunder you are making; but if the inspection of the contents of a gentleman's portmanteau will rid me of you, let us delay it no longer.\\\"\\n\\nShe passed quickly and noiselessly into the other room, and returned with the heavy leather valise, which she handed to the American with an air of patient contempt.\\n\\nGoodwin set the valise quickly upon the table and began to unfasten the straps.  The Lady stood by, with an expression of infinite scorn and weariness upon her face.\",\"timestamp\":1641298428,\"title\":\"\\nA miniature breaker, spreading with a soft \\\"swish\\\" upon the sand brought with its something round\"},\"digest\":\"Vi4QCdRIaY21aK2VQ3egixI1Xf3RjWSik86vEEDZ5xw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x81227527cbBb507F7E0b85be26187C02C5D953E3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ypyLwABFHonaGYvG82w04ARmpsw4XQEWLZjj7cuAcxw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Nl-7qdJLgW45vcHkb-R02oCyo-tAPIX_0IwU9qZqhJ4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"2r_FvWouSkIGHcBLtIF8NNX83OdJSRKLjbsjSiSYl7M0ew0sju_tSQ-e8wZnpESq_a5FdQdtDvgXRtT-1-eSrQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x80ec7d3414d0503d526f33d82cf2951e85ce3f511713fec0ef35d0d70483a3dd4f2c796935df29e963d886df6a1b5a4423c8907bb74925f75b0a63cee8e4628c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ypyLwABFHonaGYvG82w04ARmpsw4XQEWLZjj7cuAcxw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Nl-7qdJLgW45vcHkb-R02oCyo-tAPIX_0IwU9qZqhJ4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Vi4QCdRIaY21aK2VQ3egixI1Xf3RjWSik86vEEDZ5xw\"}"
