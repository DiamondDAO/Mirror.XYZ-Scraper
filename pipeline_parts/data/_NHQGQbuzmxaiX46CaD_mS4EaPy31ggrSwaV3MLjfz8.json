"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1976 / 1997 California, New Mexico, Washington\\n\\nYou each dropped out and started a new business with a best friend.\\n\\nYour best friend had the first idea, you fanned the flames.\\nYour businesses fed on the mothers’ milk of that first idea and grew.\\nThe early days are a wide open field.\\n\\nThere was no competition, you played different games with rules you each invented. Everybody won.\\n\\nWhat happens when you are both playing in the same game?\\n\\nOne day, you visited the other, and suggested that everyone wanted a piece but that you could squeeze the other in on the action. Your pitch: ”I don’t need you but I might let you get involved”.\\n\\nYou had a new thing to sell, you wanted the other to make things to go with it. Deal done. Years of playing on the same side followed.\\n\\nSomething happened. The other made something like what you made.\\n\\nCooperation became comparison, and comparison is competition. You were furious but to be fair that “new new thing” you bragged about was from someone else. The game became war.\\n\\nA few years later the other guy won. Your business lost at playing his game. Then you lost again, you were exiled for losing too many times.\\n\\nYou started over.\\n\\nYou had the new thing but no sales, your old business had sales but not the new thing. You made a deal and you were back with your old business but it was in trouble. You decided to change the rules.\\n\\nYou made a deal with your old rival but now it was all business. The other guy gave you money, and your old business sold your new new thing.\\n\\nYou left behind your old game, you reinvented the rules, and turned rivals into comrades.\\n\\nGame on again.\\n\\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/15BQ7vEDv2LJuh8TxWIhtd?si=3ec68e6c3cd249d4&nd=1](https://open.spotify.com/track/15BQ7vEDv2LJuh8TxWIhtd?si=3ec68e6c3cd249d4&nd=1)\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVtxEA7AEHg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVtxEA7AEHg)\\n\\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/64OgtT0bUgm0Ks9NOWu4rZ?si=cc2754d7a1d34bfd](https://open.spotify.com/track/64OgtT0bUgm0Ks9NOWu4rZ?si=cc2754d7a1d34bfd)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/er3d7Cvpy1EjnR_Km6sjQ.png?height=1612&width=1201)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1642372550,\"title\":\"1976: 8.9 Stop Competing In The Same Game, Change The Rules, Turn Rivals Into Comrades \"},\"digest\":\"VD5583REuVRvDC1YuBoUrGG-HG_1KsWoDqCJD70X_mo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zPVtMyaQpDsDDVMjJesiMZMonuGdwDy-z4GiCoW285I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Sj1MexBfn8IhGL2V2t3MueP6MdvJoUFmyRgdO4ow8wQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"16WGableqkiaopassXDMt0gwcHMmGuvdhm7gV0lXkVouNoDJs5KcsCFXUZJOM8Wyl41GUUNQzRXBFeJ3SUH8Lw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x939c3e74a74214d6af1d91162bfa0388ffcf1810af9855b8880f77fac5246e92763b9303b41ee3fbd48236f8d0f8e555ab6e872cb7d0c6983323d6d9cc5c151c1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zPVtMyaQpDsDDVMjJesiMZMonuGdwDy-z4GiCoW285I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Sj1MexBfn8IhGL2V2t3MueP6MdvJoUFmyRgdO4ow8wQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"2aMBW5-vHMb1g7hNMPyqnkWNpc8DKu9KLR0tHy9cbz8\"}"
