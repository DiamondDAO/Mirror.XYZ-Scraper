"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The essence of business is trading, and if others are willing to pay you, it is obvious that you have created the value they want. If you don't create the value he wants, it is impossible for him to have any loyalty to you, any feelings. Some bosses like to talk about loyalty. Whether it is to employees or customers, Luo Ji's thinking is pure confusion.\\n\\nIt is not so much that there is \\\"loyalty\\\" in business as it is to have \\\"integrity\\\" in transactions. Don't deceive customers. The customer needs this thing next time, his choice cost is low, because he doesn't know if other merchants will deceive.\\n\\nThe reason why people can't see the truth clearly is because they are too greedy. If they want to take advantage of others, they will blind their own eyes. As a boss, in a company, we serve employees. Only when employees can develop, learn new things, and make money, employees will work hard. Some bosses try to get employees to take less money and do more work through meetings and continuous gratitude training. The boss who does this often steals the chicken and loses the rice. What we really should do is to directly allocate a certain percentage of money to employees. This ratio is much higher than that of peers, and the outstanding talents of the entire peers will come to you. When we started a business, why did several founders work overtime and work hard? To put it bluntly, it means that there is a lot of money.\\n\\nAs long as a person is not hypocritical, tells the truth, and divides the money, the enterprise can actually do a good job. You don’t even need that much system. In the past, when there was a large collective in the countryside, everyone didn't work hard. Why? No matter how much I do, I can't tell myself much. But then, after the household contract, why did everyone work so hard? The answer is simple, although a portion of the tax is required. But if you do more, you can divide more.\\n\\n156 Entrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs\\n\\nTherefore, the way I do business is to pay high salaries, divide money, divide benefits, and be honest.\\n\\nDon't talk about loyalty, don't talk about feelings. If employees and customers treat me badly, it means I am\\n\\nI have a problem. I need to correct. Instead of asking employees, customers must be loyal.\\n\\nIn ancient times, the weak needed the strong to provide reasons before they would sell\\n\\nLife\\n\\nAs the boss, why do we tell new salespeople that we are to provide users with the products they need and to help them, instead of saying that we are selling and making money? In fact, it is to deceive the novices who have just entered the industry because they are afraid that they are too pure to be embarrassed to make money. Therefore, we have to say something brilliant to mislead our subordinates, so that they can make money for us with peace of mind.\\n\\nThis is like in ancient times, when a country wanted to launch a war against another country, it had to give its soldiers and people a great excuse to protect their homes, maintain peace, and liberate the oppressed, and so on. But the real reason is for two words: profit.\\n\\nMoreover, in many cases, the war between two countries in ancient times was only for the benefit of the leaders of the country. But when mobilized to fight. You can never say to the frontline soldiers who are about to go to the battlefield: \\\"The purpose of this war is because the boss of our country dislikes the boss of the enemy country. After the enemy country is occupied, the boss can have the woman of the enemy country’s boss.\\\" In this way, what would the soldiers think?\\n\\nTherefore, as a strong person, you must learn to make up excuses, because ordinary people need good reasons to sell their lives for you.\",\"timestamp\":1634798085,\"title\":\"Don't require employees to be loyal\"},\"digest\":\"OOOC7e7DtOwsruk-eDWc4gzRJcolb3dSHrONFOb6uSI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"vc8dyQMgImJWR6INWZHWc0xK0ZKk5ynLHdtdccYIKVrIntPJ2h3ZLIVpb9GkjP5XTkzA4zkmhctLXGwsyEseBw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"OOOC7e7DtOwsruk-eDWc4gzRJcolb3dSHrONFOb6uSI\"}"
