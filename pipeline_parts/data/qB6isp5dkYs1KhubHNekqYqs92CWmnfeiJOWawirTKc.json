"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\n---\\n\\nLong before the pandemic, we were being bombarded with a constant stream of predictions, prescriptions and speculation about the “future of work.”\\n\\nTechnologists urged us to notice that all work is being “disrupted,” proclaiming that “every company is a tech company.” They assured us that “automation and AI will transform work for the better, helping workers become more efficient, productive and avoid drudgery.”\\n\\nAnd yet, amidst this race to the tech-enabled future of work, we seem to have accepted a set of outdated and highly problematic assumptions about what “work” means in the first place, especially when it comes to the new class of creative and knowledge work that powers the information and attention economy.\\n\\n**What creative work means right now: cash for creation**\\n\\nThe default definition of work is that someone who can do something (a “worker”) does something (let’s call that a “job”) in exchange for payment from someone who needs something done and can pay someone to do that something (let’s call that payer a “company”).\\n\\nIn the U.S., there are two primary categories of workers: employees and independent contractors. These categories of workers are distinguished by the degree of control and supervision the company has over them.\\n\\nAn employee generally does a job for a company from within the company in a way that’s controlled by the company.\\n\\nAn independent contractor generally does a job for a company from outside of the company in a way that is not controlled by the company.\\n\\nThis distinction serves as the the cornerstone of many labor and employment disputes in the sharing economy. Indeed, the correct classification of workers as employees or independent contractors has vast economic and practical implications for companies and their workers. But because the impact of this one distinction carries such high stakes, it’s easy to forget that both conceptions of working are functionally identical in one key respect when it comes to creative professionals and knowledge workers:\\n\\n**In exchange for cash payments, creative workers grant the companies they work for exclusive rights to all the upside generated by their creations.**\\n\\nThe legal mechanics of achieving this outcome vary, but the outcome remains the same, irrespective of worker classification. If a worker is classified as an employee, this exclusive rights transfer typically occurs through the combination of the default “work for hire” doctrine and contractual invention assignment agreements contained in employment paperwork. If a worker is an independent contractor, despite the default assumption that independent contractors own the intellectual property they create, contracting companies accomplish the exclusive assignment of intellectual property through an assignment agreement, typically contained in the engagement agreement.\\n\\nThe common denominator is that creative workers are not collaborating with coequals but acting as servants whose creations belong to their principals. Creative workers trade their stake in their creations for cash.\\n\\nSome might assume that the “create for cash” model has always been the harsh reality of creative work, especially in the United States. But that is simply not true. Before the Copyright Act of 1909, the courts were reluctant to hold that companies employing creative workers owned the intellectual property created by the worker. In cases dealing with court reporters and playwrights, courts found that, despite being paid for their creative work, these workers retained and were free to monetize their creative workproduct. The assumption that intellectual property of a creative worker should belong to the company that contracts for the work is barely a century old.\\n\\nWhat about company incentive equity plans? The innovation permitting employees to participate in employee equity plans is a positive one and it does change the dynamic of the “creation for cash” model; however, it does so by expanding the category of equity-holder, not by questioning the foundational assumption that work means means to trade your creations for cash. In addition, for a variety of legal and logistical reasons, participation in these types of plans is rarely available to creative workers who are classified as independent contractors or those who work for companies that are organized as limited liability companies. And even when workers do obtain equity in the company they work for, they still do not have a direct stake in their actual creations.\\n\\n**What creative work could mean in the future: equitable creation.**\\n\\nWhat if there were a way to break away from the “create for cash” model by building a decentralized framework where workers can authentically choose what work they wish to bring into being in exchange for a percentage of the potential rewards associated with the work they make?\\n\\nCould a new framework of equitable creation motivate creative workers to joyfully bring their work into the world for nothing more than the identity-driven desire to maintain a lasting connection with their creations? What if decentralized applications could substantially shift the balance of creative power from static sources of capital and staid assignments of inventions — which mobilize creativity into centralized captivity — to emerging new waves of decentralized agency?\\n\\nCould a more equitable framework for creative work empower a widespread reevaluation of cultural capital and potentially serve as a springboard for freshly experimental approaches to address the growing alienation, desperation and burnout that is all-too-often associated with our work for cash culture?\\n\\nThese are the questions we should be asking if our goal is to move beyond a “future of work” discourse that privileges the introduction of *new means of work* over the development of *new meanings of work.*\",\"timestamp\":1637090981,\"title\":\"The Future of Work Could Use a New Job Description \"},\"digest\":\"VQeCP3fUOaxFKIYptlWp7osOHlY8EWbBfCA9N4XXEZs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x368f593244F04C599b3328a23493680b23818Fa6\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"x3tHKPIB2oeaKo1kct4KMWpiON0ax4hPm7gh_FDmoL4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"iKXALiyeFwqy6RJjVlXjajoYHrEKVQQagm2aegeSVUM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Az-EPcx98st_WIyv3GwUgiQ_yA3whqFnvwqnStuZOlHoP4egKi7PXwYkgVfVNj4jf1I7PbAI_fa5LnYKS7Uppg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x499e1d7d5d8710bc6ff3754ccff127dc7b2c9169a97d69cb6ed2a94cbcb23f11414c3f7b47744e63d3f85b105076110823e5fc6920c98e82d7890c903fca78071b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"x3tHKPIB2oeaKo1kct4KMWpiON0ax4hPm7gh_FDmoL4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"iKXALiyeFwqy6RJjVlXjajoYHrEKVQQagm2aegeSVUM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"zYJHQfDQbKsgmPSlp1gghL35sT518j-83OTg1ec13zY\"}"
