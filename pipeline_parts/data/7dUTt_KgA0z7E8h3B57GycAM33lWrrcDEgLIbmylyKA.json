They huddle together in a Barn and are sheared regularly by their owners to farm the $SW. With more $SW, the farmers can purchase more Sheep! But outside lurk dangers the Sheep are terrified of ...The Wolves.\\n\\nThe Wolves are on the hunt for Sheep and their precious $SW. They’ll take it by any means necessary. They’ll kidnap Sheep or catch them unaware and steal all of their $SW. So the farmers struck a deal with the Wolves: they pay the Wolves a tax on all $SW production. In return, the Wolves don’t attack Sheep who are safe in the Barn.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8yQO4VRbICUYIjucAqX8t.png?height=1038&width=1920)\\n\\nBut when a Sheep leaves the farm or new Sheep are born... The Wolves don’t back\\n\\nShepherd planet is a risk protocol for NFTs with novel tokenomics. It shows what’s possible with interactions between the ERC-20 and ERC-721 protocols. For the very first time, your NFT can steal other NFTs (ERC-721 tokens) for you. The rarer your NFT, the more tokens you'll accumulate probabilistically. Shepherd planet is pioneering new types of NFT mechanics. Fully decentralized. No roadmaps or empty promises. Just a game in the metaverse that’s ready to play at launch.\\n\\nThe tl;dr:\\n\\n```\\n - There will only ever be 10,000 Gen 0, it costs 0.5 BNB each to mint for whitelist members, and 0.8 BNB each to mint for other members. \\n\\n - The Gen 1 can be minted by $SW that are earned by farming. - Sheep can be staked in the Barn to earn $SW and pay a tax anytime they claim their $SW earnings\\n\\n - If a Sheep is unstaked from the Barn, the Wolves try to steal all of its accumulated $SW\\n\\n - When a new Sheep is born, the Wolves attempt to kidnap it. If they’re successful, it’s given to a randomly selected Wolf, instead of the owner who minted it \\n```\\n\\n**Contract Addresses**\\n\\n* Sheep / Wolf NFT:\\n* Barn / Gang Staking:\\n* $SW Token:\\n\\n**Minting**\\n\\nToken ID ——Minting Cost\\n\\n1 to 10,000 (Gen 0) —— 0.5/0.8 BNB\\n\\n10,001 to 20,000 —— 20,000 $SW\\n\\n20,001 to 40,000 —— 40,000 $SW\\n\\n40,001 to 50,000 —— 80,000 $SW\\n\\nThe total cost to mint all of the Sheep and Wolves in existence will be 1,800,000,000 $SW.\\n\\n**Land**\\n\\nEach Shepherd requires to have a land to play the game. The land will become the most essential resource in the future phases of the game. Users who own a land enjoy the supreme power and beneficial conditions of the game.\\n\\n**Sheep**\\n\\nYou have a 90% chance of minting a Sheep, each with unique traits. Here are the actions they can take：\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1BcBHujksCWpS9iQKmEGp.png?height=579&width=1178)\\n\\n**$SW**\\n\\nThe maximum $SW supply is 2,400,000,000 $SW: When supply reaches 2,400,000,000 $SW earned for staking, the staking“faucet”will be turned off.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rDogiVTFBcAnpboqwOT2g.png?height=231&width=1186)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UG3W1S-axTjQHxpsCUwYF.png?height=1025&width=575)\\n\\nWolves You have a 10% chance of minting a Wolf, each with unique traits, including an Alpha value ranging from 5 to 8. The higher the Alpha value:\\n\\n\\\\- The higher the portion of $SW that the Wolf earns from taxes\\n\\n\\\\- The higher chance of stealing a newly minted Sheep or Wolf Example: Wolf A has an Alpha of 8 and Wolf B has an Alpha of 6, and they are staked.\\n\\n\\\\- If 70,000 $SW total have been accumulated as taxes, Wolf A will be able to claim 40,000 $SW and Wolf B will be able to claim 30,000 $SW\\n\\n\\\\- If a newly minted Sheep or Wolf is stolen, Wolf A has a 57% chance of receiving it and Wolf B has a 43% chance of receiving it\\n\\nOnly staked Wolves are able to steal a Sheep or earn the $SW tax：\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vb1jNZ3CdziEqGYr_G90f.png?height=231&width=1172)\\n\\n**Why this tech is novel？**\\n\\nProtocol-level risk is ripe for exploration in NFTs. Many projects are implementing stake-to-earn, but haven’t cracked the code on users making choices in the face of risk.\\n\\nIn the case of Shepherd planet’s Wolf-eat-Sheep world, your NFT can steal ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens for you. This is entirely new.\\n\\nEverything in Shepherd planet happens on-chain: the decisioning, the results, the generation of the NFTs themselves. It’s split between 4 different smart contracts so that anyone can read through and get a sense of how it all talks to each other.\\n\\nThere are a number of techniques in these contracts that make this all possible while maintaining accuracy, keeping gas costs down, and not exceeding the EVM contract size limit.\\n\\nData Packing:\\n\\nStorage is expensive on the blockchain! One 256 bit integer costs 20,000 gas to save, which at today’s costs is about $7.50… for one number! Efficiently packing data types by designing around smaller max values can save users hundreds of thousands of dollars over the lifetime of the project\\n\\nConstant Time Algorithms & DeFi Math:\\n\\nA lot of contracts use architectures that require significant looping to accomplish tasks. Those make contracts inefficient and add to gas costs. It’s imperative to remove things like the need to search through arrays or loop through stakes. This means you can do things like unlimited simultaneous stakes while keeping things cheaper. As an example, the minting contract uses AJ Walker’s Alias Method to efficiently select traits in constant time.\\n\\nAnother example: tracking Wolf $SW earnings (taxes) proved to be very complex, requiring math used by DeFi liquidity pool protocols.\\n\\n100% On-chain:\\n\\nNot the first, and certainly not the last. But as long as Ethereum is running, your Sheep and Wolves will survive. Always available and always yours. Your traits and all the pixel art reside in the contracts themselves, nowhere else. UI at launch:\\n\\nYou can use the entirety of Shepherd planet by directly interacting with the blockchain (like through Etherscan). But Shepherd planet is launching with a custom UI to make it easy for people to enjoy the game on day 1.\\n\\nIn conclusion...\\n\\nWith Shepherd planet, everyone can play with their own level of risk… Pay the tax? Stay liquid on the market? Take a chance to keep all your $SW, but have a chance to lose it all? The choices and this game have to be engaging.\\n\\nWolves preying on Sheep feels almost like a parallel to the NFT community itself: A select few with alpha among all of us, and many others following the pack\\n\\n[https://cointelegraph.com/](https://cointelegraph.com/)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1641892999,\"title\":\"Shepherd Planet Rules\"},\"digest\":\"NEPvXNJt9FlgogxVtvNzmgjToqQ7hiFEDTV086cx8nc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xf742e165366352d790AB9b6E796dCDB5f79eb440\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"pvfzJNTaw6Zh18N-z-DWihDdRhK9Z27IqHC2urzR2Ss\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mEau4Pa950DrE0Yjupk8w7z5AanuBd_ldhczwHsbmW0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"k1UYIRMLb2DumqIMBg4QaPe7jVzAmrIx7e8pZkFnOYncUSJkH2kfwLRGRxGqrR-Pw_i2Hh6RmgTv7smAQf4-nQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5aa7bc83f54ab757ecf783706c8f77cf190befb38e35f24a521d224c51a98e583040146a0e99b9b7c6986f764c6ddac1caf701014ac27d4eed061e03e4c53afb1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"pvfzJNTaw6Zh18N-z-DWihDdRhK9Z27IqHC2urzR2Ss\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mEau4Pa950DrE0Yjupk8w7z5AanuBd_ldhczwHsbmW0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"7t7yd7d9XQoRBBzOGAMucn46IqxWQY2Dp4vH7QiJaYo\"}"
